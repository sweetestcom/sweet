    <p>I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.</p>
<p>I was in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<p>One day I had stolen the night before</p>
<p>and stolen 160K out of ATMs.</p>
<p>Went in the next morning, I woke up,</p>
<p>signed on to cartersmarket.com,</p>
<p>which was ran by Max Butler, the Iceman.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s my name, US Most Wanted on it.</p>
<p>And that gets your attention.</p>
<p>That was my real name with US Most Wanted beside of it.</p>
<p>Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all,</p>
<p>but then they did.</p>
<p>And it was talking about me being part</p>
<p>of the Secret Service, Operation Anglerfish,</p>
<p>everything else.</p>
<p>So of course, they&rsquo;re all like.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s after you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna get this son of a bitch.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Brett Johnson,</p>
<p>a former cyber criminal who built the first</p>
<p>organized cybercrime community called Shadow Crew</p>
<p>that is the precursor to today&rsquo;s Darknet</p>
<p>and Darknet markets.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s referred to by the United States Secret Service</p>
<p>as quote, the original internet godfather.</p>
<p>He has been the central figure in the cybercrime world</p>
<p>for almost 20 years.</p>
<p>Placed on the US Most Wanted list in 2006</p>
<p>before being convicted of 39 felonies for cybercrime,</p>
<p>escaped from prison, and then eventually being locked up,</p>
<p>served his time, and now is helping people understand</p>
<p>and fight cybercrime.</p>
<p>This was a raw, honest, emotional, and real episode.</p>
<p>Brett has caused a lot of pain to a lot of people,</p>
<p>and yet his own story is full of trauma and pain,</p>
<p>and also redemption and love.</p>
<p>This is a good time to say that I have and I will</p>
<p>talk to people who have served time in prison,</p>
<p>and perhaps people who currently are in prison.</p>
<p>I will try to do my best to both empathize</p>
<p>with the person across from me and not let them sugarcoat,</p>
<p>explain away, or dismiss the crimes they committed.</p>
<p>This is a tough line to walk,</p>
<p>because if you close your heart to the other person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never fully understand their mind and their story.</p>
<p>But if you open the heart too much,</p>
<p>you can be manipulated to where the conversation</p>
<p>reveals nothing honest or real.</p>
<p>This requires skill and willingness to take the risk.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the skill part,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to take the risk.</p>
<p>I always wear my heart on my sleeve.</p>
<p>If I get hurt for it, that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, I want to understand</p>
<p>what makes a person do these crimes,</p>
<p>the particular characteristics of their temporary</p>
<p>or permanent madness, their justifications,</p>
<p>but also their humanity.</p>
<p>I believe each of us have the capacity</p>
<p>to become both the criminal and the victim,</p>
<p>the predator and the prey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to us to avoid these paths</p>
<p>or to find the path to redemption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on each of us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our responsibility and burden</p>
<p>of being human in a complicated and dangerous world.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Brett Johnson.</p>
<p>You were convicted of 39 felonies for cybercrime</p>
<p>placed on the US most wanted list in 2006,</p>
<p>escaped from prison.</p>
<p>You built the first organized cybercrime community</p>
<p>called Shadow Crew that is the precursor</p>
<p>to today&rsquo;s darknet and darknet markets.</p>
<p>And for all this, the US intelligence service</p>
<p>called you the original internet godfather.</p>
<p>So first question, how did your career</p>
<p>as a cybercrime criminal begin?</p>
<p>My life of crime begins when I&rsquo;m 10 years old.</p>
<p>10 years old, man, think about that.</p>
<p>I mean, you were probably playing the robots</p>
<p>when you were 10.</p>
<p>You know, usually kids are doing the Lego bit,</p>
<p>getting involved with sports, everything else.</p>
<p>And with me, it wasn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>With me, I&rsquo;m from Eastern Kentucky.</p>
<p>Eastern Kentucky is one of these,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like parts of Texas, parts of Louisiana,</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re not fortunate enough to have a job,</p>
<p>you may be involved in a scam, hustle, fraud,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call it, man.</p>
<p>I was, my parents, my mom was basically</p>
<p>the captain of the entire fraud industry.</p>
<p>So this is a woman that at one point,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s stealing a 108,000 pound Caterpillar D9 bulldozer,</p>
<p>tramming it down the road.</p>
<p>You know, at another point, she&rsquo;s taking a slip</p>
<p>and falling a convenience store trying to sue the owner.</p>
<p>We had a neighbor she acted as a pimp for at one point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my mom, my dad.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, the neighbor acted as a pimp?</p>
<p>My mom prostituted, I mean,</p>
<p>she acted as a pimp for a neighbor.</p>
<p>Her name was Debbie and my mom used to sell her out.</p>
<p>Debbie needed money and my mom would find men</p>
<p>for her to sleep with for cash</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d take a part of the cash.</p>
<p>So Sauna&rsquo;s like she diversified the methodologies</p>
<p>by which she hustled.</p>
<p>Very, had that entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You know, we see that a lot with cyber criminals,</p>
<p>you know, that sense of being that entrepreneur.</p>
<p>So what was the motivation you think for her?</p>
<p>Is it money?</p>
<p>Is it basically the rush of playing with the system</p>
<p>or being able to know the rules</p>
<p>and break the rules and get away with it?</p>
<p>My mom&rsquo;s a complex character.</p>
<p>She is, there&rsquo;s no one single motivation.</p>
<p>So my mom was the individual, she&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>My mom was the individual who tested people.</p>
<p>She wanted to know how far she could abuse you</p>
<p>and you come back and still love her.</p>
<p>So, and that was with every relationship she&rsquo;s ever had.</p>
<p>She would cheat on the men she was involved with.</p>
<p>She would abuse her children, me and Denise.</p>
<p>She would&hellip;</p>
<p>Psychological, physical?</p>
<p>Oh, it was mental, emotional, physical,</p>
<p>everything, everything.</p>
<p>I mean, she used to beat me and Denise with belt buckles,</p>
<p>you know, and that ended when she was,</p>
<p>I forgot what we had done.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t much.</p>
<p>I think that it may have been the part</p>
<p>where she accused me of stealing her marijuana,</p>
<p>but she was hitting me and Denise.</p>
<p>We were living in a single wide trailer at that point.</p>
<p>She was hitting me and Denise.</p>
<p>We were on the bed trying to get away from it.</p>
<p>And Denise kicks her through a closet is what happens.</p>
<p>And Denise stands up and she said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re through hitting me.</p>
<p>And that was the last time that mom hit us at that point.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>So sorry to take us there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, for people who know you</p>
<p>and people should definitely watch</p>
<p>some of your lectures online.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re extremely charismatic and fun and jolly</p>
<p>and whatever word you want to use.</p>
<p>But, you know, if we look at that kind of life,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s darkness there, there&rsquo;s a struggle there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of darkness.</p>
<p>So if you, how did you feel?</p>
<p>If you go back to the mind of the kid you were</p>
<p>with your mom, was there sadness?</p>
<p>Was there things like depression, self doubt,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things, or did you see this crime,</p>
<p>this chaos as ultimately exciting?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>back then I didn&rsquo;t view it as exciting.</p>
<p>Now it becomes exciting when I start being involved</p>
<p>in cyber crime, all right?</p>
<p>But back then it was simply a means to an end</p>
<p>was all it was.</p>
<p>So you take a 10 year old kid</p>
<p>and the way I get involved in crime is,</p>
<p>like I said, my mom was the fraudster.</p>
<p>My dad was a good guy.</p>
<p>He just forgot he was this good guy.</p>
<p>You know, he was always, he always had these principles,</p>
<p>but his issue was is he loved my mom so much,</p>
<p>he was scared of her leaving.</p>
<p>So if she wanted to do something, commit crime,</p>
<p>cheat on him, whatever,</p>
<p>he would pretty much just put up with it the one instant.</p>
<p>So, I mean, this woman used to,</p>
<p>she used to bring men home in front of him,</p>
<p>tell him that, hey, I&rsquo;m leaving you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love you anymore.</p>
<p>I want you to die, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>This was my mom.</p>
<p>There were two instances where the man,</p>
<p>where he can&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p>
<p>And the first instance, I was,</p>
<p>I guess I was seven or eight.</p>
<p>My sister Denise is a year younger than I am.</p>
<p>My dad actually files for divorce,</p>
<p>files for divorce at that point.</p>
<p>My mom kind of goes crazy.</p>
<p>My dad, I was with my dad.</p>
<p>My sister was with my mother</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s that Eastern Kentucky mentality.</p>
<p>You know, men stay with men, women stay with women.</p>
<p>So he was filing for divorce.</p>
<p>Me and my dad, we were living in an apartment.</p>
<p>My mom was living with her grandparents</p>
<p>and with her parents bouncing back and forth</p>
<p>between the two.</p>
<p>And I remember I was sleeping in the bed.</p>
<p>We had a single wide bed.</p>
<p>My dad slept on the sofa.</p>
<p>I woke up one night</p>
<p>and there was some sort of ruckus in the living room.</p>
<p>So I wake up and I walk into the living room</p>
<p>and my mom has a knife to my dad&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>And basically you&rsquo;re not going to steal my son from me.</p>
<p>My mom was this individual</p>
<p>that when she knew she went so far,</p>
<p>like I said, she was always this person that tested.</p>
<p>What can I do this to you?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll still come back.</p>
<p>She knew, she was always also this person</p>
<p>that if she went too far, she knew it.</p>
<p>And she would always try to divert that into something else.</p>
<p>All right, so she knew at that point she&rsquo;d went too far.</p>
<p>So what does she do?</p>
<p>She gets up crying, goes to the bathroom</p>
<p>and pretends to slit her wrists</p>
<p>so that my dad Ray will respond to that,</p>
<p>not respond to what she&rsquo;s just done to him.</p>
<p>That was my mom in a nutshell.</p>
<p>She had a history of doing this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Motivations as far as fraud with her,</p>
<p>I think with her it was, she was an LPN.</p>
<p>She had a very good nurse, but she didn&rsquo;t want to work.</p>
<p>It was a lot of it.</p>
<p>So with her, it was easier for her to commit fraud.</p>
<p>And when I say commit fraud,</p>
<p>it was against businesses, against people.</p>
<p>I remember at one point she&rsquo;s buying</p>
<p>over the counter capsules and emptying the capsules out</p>
<p>and putting some other crap in there</p>
<p>and selling at a speed and people were buying it.</p>
<p>She did anything she could for money.</p>
<p>And of course I get involved with that.</p>
<p>What happens is we were in Panama City at that point</p>
<p>and my mom leaves my dad and the way she left my dad,</p>
<p>my great grandfather had died.</p>
<p>My mom tells all three of us, hey, I&rsquo;m taking the kids</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going back to Eastern Kentucky</p>
<p>to attend the funeral.</p>
<p>Well, that was her leaving.</p>
<p>Me and Denise didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t pack any of our clothes at all.</p>
<p>She stows her clothes in the trunk of the car</p>
<p>and she leaves my dad and I don&rsquo;t get to see my dad again</p>
<p>for I think five, six years, something like that.</p>
<p>My mom, like I said, she used to bring men home</p>
<p>in front of my dad.</p>
<p>She would, he&rsquo;d sit there and cry and beg her not to do it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d do it anyway.</p>
<p>When she leaves him, she kept up that.</p>
<p>So we were living at my grandparents house.</p>
<p>My grandfather, he had converted the house.</p>
<p>He had raised the house up</p>
<p>and built apartments underneath of it.</p>
<p>So me and my sister and my mom lived</p>
<p>in one of the apartments underneath</p>
<p>and that whole side of the family was just nuts, was nuts.</p>
<p>My granddad, Paul, he would,</p>
<p>this is a man that he didn&rsquo;t want you</p>
<p>to eat any of his food.</p>
<p>So, you know, there was no such thing</p>
<p>as me and Denise going upstairs to eat.</p>
<p>If he found out me and Denise was taking a bath,</p>
<p>we were allowed to bath and bathe in two inches of water</p>
<p>one time a week</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t want to have to pay the water bill.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s rules.</p>
<p>There are rules.</p>
<p>You know, if you couldn&rsquo;t have the TV on,</p>
<p>when he went to bed at night,</p>
<p>you had to have the television, the volume.</p>
<p>You could watch it, but without volume</p>
<p>because if he heard it, he would get up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and he would kick the power breaker,</p>
<p>turn off all the power on you.</p>
<p>This is my, this is my, the family, right?</p>
<p>So my mom, she used to leave me and Denise at home</p>
<p>for days, man, for days.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d go out and, you know, party.</p>
<p>And I mean, sometimes she&rsquo;d take me into these with her.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d wait in the car.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;d wait in the living room</p>
<p>as she went and partied and everything else.</p>
<p>Most of the time she left us at home</p>
<p>and my entry into crime, Denise walks in one day,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s nine years old, man.</p>
<p>She walks in one day</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s got a pack of pork chops in her hand</p>
<p>and looked at her and I said, where&rsquo;d you get that?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I stole it.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s like, show me how you did that.</p>
<p>So she takes me over</p>
<p>and she shows me how she steals food,</p>
<p>how she&rsquo;s stuffing it down her pants.</p>
<p>So we start stealing food.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, hell yeah, let&rsquo;s do that shit.</p>
<p>So start stealing food.</p>
<p>And we get to the point where we&rsquo;re wanting a sandwich.</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t stuff a loaf of bread down your pants.</p>
<p>So there was a Kmart in the shopping center.</p>
<p>I go over to the Kmart, get a hoodie off the rack,</p>
<p>take the tags off of it, wear it out, work just fine.</p>
<p>And the way you steal bread</p>
<p>is you put the hoodie over your shoulder,</p>
<p>stuff a loaf of bread down the sleeve</p>
<p>and you walk out with it.</p>
<p>So we started doing that.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you figure that out?</p>
<p>Just thought pattern.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like strategic thinking here.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, you can&rsquo;t wear the hoodie</p>
<p>and put the bread down here</p>
<p>cause you might mash the bread when you zip it up</p>
<p>or they might notice the bread.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have to think through that.</p>
<p>You gotta think through it.</p>
<p>But you gotta realize by this point,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already seeing what my parents are doing.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m already seeing the plotting.</p>
<p>That kind of puzzle solving</p>
<p>was something you were already developing yourself</p>
<p>individually cause you&rsquo;re pretty young.</p>
<p>Yeah, 10 years old, pretty young.</p>
<p>But seeing how they act, how they respond to things.</p>
<p>And my mom, I guess you could call it a good thing,</p>
<p>they never kept any of that hidden from the kids.</p>
<p>You know, there was no discussions behind closed doors.</p>
<p>All that happened in front of everybody.</p>
<p>And from your young minds perspective,</p>
<p>seeing that kind of crime, you basically,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of us kind of grow up</p>
<p>thinking there&rsquo;s rules you&rsquo;re not supposed to break.</p>
<p>If you see other humans breaking those rules,</p>
<p>then you realize those rules are just human made.</p>
<p>But it gets worse than that.</p>
<p>I was in an environment where there were no decent people.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really meet my first decent person</p>
<p>until I was 16 years old.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>That was a high school teacher.</p>
<p>So what happens is, you know, we start shoplifting food.</p>
<p>My mom finds out that we&rsquo;ve been stealing stuff</p>
<p>and you know, she joins us.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>She joins us.</p>
<p>Yeah, she comes in, you know, I&rsquo;ve got the television,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the Atari 2600, play the hell out of it.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>She starts seeing this shit.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, where&rsquo;d this come from?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, we found it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, you didn&rsquo;t find that.</p>
<p>Denise, Denise stands up, we stole it.</p>
<p>My mom, show me how you did that.</p>
<p>And she gets her mom too, to join in.</p>
<p>And she used to run me and Denise</p>
<p>as these little shoplifters.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d take, you know, we&rsquo;d steal stuff for her.</p>
<p>We would distract security</p>
<p>and her and my grandmother would steal stuff.</p>
<p>They got caught doing that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the entry into crime.</p>
<p>And Denise, you know, I&rsquo;m adamant and I kind of mean it.</p>
<p>But the truth is I say, and I do mean it,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m responsible for my choices as an adult, all right?</p>
<p>I believe that when you&rsquo;re a child, you can&rsquo;t control that.</p>
<p>The adults in your environment control what you do.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re an adult though, your choices are yours.</p>
<p>Now that being said, there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t dismiss that childhood</p>
<p>influencing what I did as an adult.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I mean, it was kind of written on slate that,</p>
<p>hey, this guy&rsquo;s gonna be this guy when he grows up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like sometimes that one person you meet,</p>
<p>that decent person can turn the tide of your life.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>So what happens is, you know, the abuse,</p>
<p>everything continues on, when I&rsquo;m 15,</p>
<p>my dad was in Panama City, Florida.</p>
<p>My mom was in, you know, we were in Hazard, Kentucky.</p>
<p>She was dating this guy.</p>
<p>My mom was this woman that the abuse would,</p>
<p>it was crazy abuse, man, just crazy stuff.</p>
<p>She would tell me and my sister, you know,</p>
<p>that she gave up her life for us,</p>
<p>that she was gonna leave one day and never come back,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;d find her dead in a ditch someplace.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d go out and date these men and she&rsquo;d come back</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d talk about how these men were abusing her.</p>
<p>You know, so she&rsquo;d be dating this guy</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d come back and she&rsquo;d, you know,</p>
<p>start talking about how he had tried to rape her,</p>
<p>you know, trying to get me to respond to that.</p>
<p>And I would respond to that.</p>
<p>Make no doubt, I would respond to that.</p>
<p>Well, what happens is, and I knew that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I knew it was abuse at that age, all right,</p>
<p>but I knew things were fucked up.</p>
<p>And I was talking to my dad in Panama City</p>
<p>and I really had it in my head</p>
<p>that I was gonna go down and live with my dad.</p>
<p>And I called my dad one day.</p>
<p>I was set to go to, me and my cousins</p>
<p>were gonna go see Return of the Jedi.</p>
<p>It had came out again in the theaters.</p>
<p>So I called my dad, it was a Sunday,</p>
<p>called my dad and he told me,</p>
<p>he had either gotten married</p>
<p>or he was about to get married to this woman.</p>
<p>And basically Brett Johnson</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t gonna go down to Florida.</p>
<p>You know, I was gonna stay in Hazard.</p>
<p>I had to call my dad from payphone,</p>
<p>but the result of that was I walked him into a hospital,</p>
<p>got in an elevator and a woman got in the elevator</p>
<p>at the same time and I snapped</p>
<p>and beat the hell out of her right there.</p>
<p>And I was 15, didn&rsquo;t really know what the fuck happened.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t really know, but.</p>
<p>Just anger came from somewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, the elevator,</p>
<p>beat the hell out of this lady.</p>
<p>Turned out she looked a shitload like my mom,</p>
<p>but the elevator doors open.</p>
<p>And one of the security guards,</p>
<p>I played basketball with his son.</p>
<p>So he saw me immediately.</p>
<p>I knocked the hell out of him, took off running,</p>
<p>made it back to the house where my grandparents were.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know what had happened.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>About an hour later, Kentucky state police,</p>
<p>they pull up in the front yard and two of them get out</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sitting on the front porch and me and my cousins are</p>
<p>and they start walking up where everybody starts walking</p>
<p>out of the house.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I just remember saying, what do you want?</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>Well, you know what they wanted.</p>
<p>They wanted to arrest Brett Johnson and they arrested me.</p>
<p>I went in and I told them everything.</p>
<p>Spent three months in a county jail.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have juvenile facilities in that county.</p>
<p>So I spent three months in solitary, went to trial,</p>
<p>pled guilty to assault in the first degree.</p>
<p>The judge sentenced me to time served</p>
<p>and a psychological evaluation</p>
<p>where they sent me to Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
<p>Spent 30 days up there and they cut me loose.</p>
<p>They wanted me to have counseling after that</p>
<p>and never went to counseling.</p>
<p>You know, I wanted to, but mom was like, don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>And so never went to counseling.</p>
<p>And I became this pariah in the county. It&rsquo;s crazy, man.</p>
<p>I mean, not a day goes by that I don&rsquo;t think about that.</p>
<p>That moment in the elevator.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what happens is, you know, you&rsquo;re 15.</p>
<p>Fuck man, you&rsquo;re 15.</p>
<p>So I go back to the high school that I was in</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m this piece of shit.</p>
<p>So everybody, you&rsquo;re not the outcast.</p>
<p>Everybody knows.</p>
<p>So I moved, we moved, we were in Whitesburg at that point.</p>
<p>I finished up the year there and moved back to Perry County,</p>
<p>which is where Hazard is.</p>
<p>So we moved there and they&rsquo;ve got three high schools here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got MC Napier, they&rsquo;ve got Hazard High School</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ve got Dills Combs High School.</p>
<p>So I was within, me and Denise were within</p>
<p>half mile of MC Napier.</p>
<p>Show up there the first day of school</p>
<p>and I met me and my mom and my sister</p>
<p>were walking into the school and the kids won&rsquo;t let me in.</p>
<p>The kids stand out there, he&rsquo;s not coming in.</p>
<p>So my mom starts raising hell and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>nah, let&rsquo;s just go, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>So from there it was, we went down to the city school,</p>
<p>Hazard and the principal tells my mom,</p>
<p>Denise can come, he can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So my mom wants to raise hell and I&rsquo;m like, no,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just take me to this other school.</p>
<p>So this other school was like 15 miles away</p>
<p>and country high school.</p>
<p>So I go there and they accept me</p>
<p>and I walked in the first day</p>
<p>and this English teacher</p>
<p>name&rsquo;s Carol Combs, I walked in</p>
<p>and handed her the paper, she was my homeroom teacher</p>
<p>and she heard this voice,</p>
<p>that is the way she explains it today,</p>
<p>she heard this voice and she looks up</p>
<p>and she was like, son, have you ever done any drama before?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no maam,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m interested in the academic team,</p>
<p>I was this quick recall guy, right?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, no.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, drama.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, I&rsquo;m not interested in theater,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in academics.</p>
<p>Well, she was the head of the drama department</p>
<p>and head of the academics department.</p>
<p>So the deal was, tell you what,</p>
<p>you can get on the academics team</p>
<p>if you start with theater too.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay.</p>
<p>So what happens is she was the only,</p>
<p>she was the first decent person I met in my life</p>
<p>and she became this kind of surrogate mother to me.</p>
<p>So under her tutelage,</p>
<p>I become one of the top academic team guys in the state.</p>
<p>Around there, I was captain of the team,</p>
<p>I was this just scourge across all the counties</p>
<p>in that part of Kentucky.</p>
<p>If we had a meet, it was like,</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, that&rsquo;s Brett Johnson.</p>
<p>And it was like, she used to tell people</p>
<p>they would, the high school that I came from was Whitesburg</p>
<p>and the first time that Whitesburg came against us,</p>
<p>she told me, I was talking to her about a year ago</p>
<p>and she told me, she&rsquo;s like, Brett,</p>
<p>she said, that first meet against Whitesburg,</p>
<p>she said, the captain came in, looked at you and said,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;ve got that Johnson boy on your team?</p>
<p>And she said, my response was that Johnson boy is our team.</p>
<p>So, but I did that and then with theater,</p>
<p>I ended up, my senior year,</p>
<p>I won best actor and actress in the state.</p>
<p>Only guy to ever do that in the state.</p>
<p>So, did pretty well, man, did pretty well.</p>
<p>Had scholarships coming out of high school</p>
<p>and everything else and I&rsquo;m the idiot that turned them down.</p>
<p>Ask you a funny question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d make a hell of a, I mean,</p>
<p>of all the many things you could probably do,</p>
<p>you would make a hell of a actor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very good on stage.</p>
<p>Have you acted professionally anywhere or not?</p>
<p>Not professionally.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done the college circuit and stuff like that.</p>
<p>What happened was is, so I turned down the scholarships,</p>
<p>you know, scared of leaving, I guess is what it was.</p>
<p>Started in community college</p>
<p>and the community college there hires</p>
<p>a new theater director out of California.</p>
<p>Well, he knew the guy</p>
<p>that ran the San Jose State Theater program.</p>
<p>A guy named Edward Emmanuel was his name.</p>
<p>His claim to fame, he had written the Three Ninjas movie.</p>
<p>Remember that, the three little ninja kids</p>
<p>back in the eighties, he had written this damn film</p>
<p>and it had made a shitload of money.</p>
<p>So, he invites Ed Emmanuel to come down and see the play</p>
<p>and Ed had written this Civil War piece.</p>
<p>So, we put that on.</p>
<p>I was doing like, it was a multiple role thing.</p>
<p>I was doing like 18 different roles in the show.</p>
<p>So, Ed sees the show and he was like, scholarship.</p>
<p>He said, look, he said,</p>
<p>right now you&rsquo;re a big fish in a small pond.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make you a big fish in a big pot.</p>
<p>And I was like, deal.</p>
<p>So, I took the scholarship, man.</p>
<p>And he was like, I&rsquo;ll be back in two weeks.</p>
<p>So, he flies out.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, this guy flies back in.</p>
<p>He drives down to where I&rsquo;m living.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out shooting ball with one of my cousins and friends.</p>
<p>He pulls up and he gets out of the car</p>
<p>and I was like, I&rsquo;m walking over to him.</p>
<p>I was like, hey man, I&rsquo;ll walk you in.</p>
<p>You can meet my parents.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, I got it.</p>
<p>I was like, okay.</p>
<p>So, I keep shooting ball.</p>
<p>He walks in the house, stays about 15 minutes,</p>
<p>walks out, white as a sheet, doesn&rsquo;t say a word to me,</p>
<p>gets in the car, leaves.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hear from him again.</p>
<p>Had no idea what went on.</p>
<p>Takes me a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>What happened is my mom, he walks in and introduces himself.</p>
<p>My mom pulls a knife on the guy.</p>
<p>I will kill you.</p>
<p>You are not going to steal my goddamn son from me.</p>
<p>Scares the guy to death.</p>
<p>He bugs out and kind of broke my spirit at that point.</p>
<p>I was like, okay.</p>
<p>So, went into, just full fledged into scams,</p>
<p>crimes, everything else.</p>
<p>I had already been, when I was a minor,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d already been kind of brought up</p>
<p>on that side of the family with the crimes</p>
<p>that they were doing.</p>
<p>My mom was drug trafficking, the pimp stuff,</p>
<p>illegally mining coal, charity fraud.</p>
<p>Illegally mining coal?</p>
<p>Yeah, wildcatting coal.</p>
<p>So, you&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you explain that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, to properly mine coal,</p>
<p>you have to get a permit, all right?</p>
<p>Eastern Kentucky, a lot of people don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t afford the permits.</p>
<p>They can get them a piece of equipment.</p>
<p>You get a dozer or a loader or whatever you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>or an auger or what have you.</p>
<p>So, you start mining, but you don&rsquo;t get the permit.</p>
<p>So, you don&rsquo;t have to do the, you don&rsquo;t have to pay.</p>
<p>Back then, it was like $3,500 for a two acre permit</p>
<p>or $5,000 for a two acre permit.</p>
<p>Let you strip mine the coal on that.</p>
<p>Then you have to pay for the reclamation on top of that.</p>
<p>So, once you uncover the pit, take the coal out,</p>
<p>you have to cover back up the pit, sow grass,</p>
<p>make sure everything is environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>You got a silt pond, everything else at that point.</p>
<p>So, the whole idea is you buy an acre of land</p>
<p>or some area of land and then you can,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole process you&rsquo;re supposed to go through.</p>
<p>Entire process.</p>
<p>How many people involved in a mining,</p>
<p>the smallest number of people required</p>
<p>for a mining operation?</p>
<p>You can do it with three or four people.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve got your loader operator,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got your dozer operator.</p>
<p>You need, you can farm out the trucking to someone</p>
<p>if you need that or trucking company if you need to do that.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got your, whoever owns the business as well.</p>
<p>So, very few people can run an operation like that</p>
<p>and profit fairly well as long as</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to do the reclamation,</p>
<p>all that crap on top of it, all right?</p>
<p>The reclamation gets pretty expensive.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re uncovering a pit of coal,</p>
<p>a pit, so a ton of coal is basically about 36 cubic inches</p>
<p>is what a 2000 pounds of coal weighs</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in Eastern Kentucky</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s at the weight of the bituminous coal</p>
<p>and everything.</p>
<p>The fact that you know this is awesome.</p>
<p>The fact that you know exactly the volume</p>
<p>of a ton of coal, I mean, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Yeah, you learn this shit, right?</p>
<p>Can you rattle this shit off?</p>
<p>So, you uncover the pit and then you&rsquo;ve got to sell the pit.</p>
<p>Well, the thing is, is that,</p>
<p>where are you gonna sell the coal?</p>
<p>Well, you sell it to one of these other coal tipples</p>
<p>that knows that they&rsquo;re buying the shit illegally.</p>
<p>So, back then a ton of coal was,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d give you like 36 bucks per ton is what that is.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d have to go out and you&rsquo;d test the BTUs on it.</p>
<p>You take a sample to the lab, test the BTUs,</p>
<p>you take that into the company.</p>
<p>What BTU?</p>
<p>British Thermal Unit.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;d test what the BTU on the coal was.</p>
<p>How pure the coal is.</p>
<p>How pure the coal is, what BTU it burns at.</p>
<p>Back then, a good BTU was around 12.9</p>
<p>was what you&rsquo;d get, all right?</p>
<p>So, 12.9 coal, $36 a ton.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d take that sample over to the coal tipple.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d say, okay, we&rsquo;ll buy this for you.</p>
<p>How many trucks you got or how many tons you got?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d say, this is what we&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;d hire the trucking company.</p>
<p>And where you get it out because you&rsquo;ve got the agents</p>
<p>that are looking for you by this point</p>
<p>because the people that you&rsquo;ve bought the rights</p>
<p>to whoever the landowner is,</p>
<p>you said you&rsquo;re gonna give them $2 a ton or whatever this is.</p>
<p>Well, the other people there,</p>
<p>are you paying them off or are you not?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re not paying them off, guess what?</p>
<p>They know your ass is mining it illegally.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna report you.</p>
<p>Well, all of a sudden, you&rsquo;ve got all these inspectors</p>
<p>that are coming around and everything.</p>
<p>Hey, we know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re looking for you to get the pit out.</p>
<p>So, when do you get the pit out?</p>
<p>Right in dead of night.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re loading it up two o clock in the morning,</p>
<p>hauling this ass out is what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You sell it out from there.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And your mom ran operations like this?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And you said you worked the mine too when you were younger?</p>
<p>Yeah, I learned how to run a loader, run a dozer,</p>
<p>learn how to clean off a pit, everything like that.</p>
<p>So, this is the lifestyle you grow up in.</p>
<p>You learn how to do this stuff.</p>
<p>And so, I knew how to do charity fraud as well,</p>
<p>insurance fraud, so.</p>
<p>Charity fraud.</p>
<p>Can we break down some of these?</p>
<p>Charity fraud, it&rsquo;s much more romantic than what it sounds.</p>
<p>It was basically, it was basically standing beside the road</p>
<p>with a sign and a bucket taking up collections</p>
<p>for homeless shelters, for abused women,</p>
<p>for children, stuff like that.</p>
<p>Then later on, I branched off.</p>
<p>When I started off on my own,</p>
<p>I would set up my own charity company</p>
<p>and do some telemarketing and go on by</p>
<p>and collect checks and things like that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna talk about that.</p>
<p>But actually, can we just step back</p>
<p>and talk about your mom and your dad?</p>
<p>Given all of that, given all the abuse,</p>
<p>the complex ways that she played with love,</p>
<p>to see how far she can push you and the people around her,</p>
<p>and they still love her.</p>
<p>Today, do you love her?</p>
<p>You know, I called my dad yesterday.</p>
<p>My dad, he&rsquo;s dying now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a heart condition.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna get the operation to fix it.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, fuck it, I&rsquo;m ready to go.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I looked at him,</p>
<p>because hell, I&rsquo;m 52 now.</p>
<p>Prior to 52, I&rsquo;d have been like, no, you need to do this.</p>
<p>But I looked at him and I was like, I understand.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s not gonna get the operation.</p>
<p>I was talking to him yesterday and he asked me,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, have you seen your mom?</p>
<p>And I was like, dad, I&rsquo;ve not talked to her</p>
<p>for about two years.</p>
<p>And I told him, I was like, I love my mom,</p>
<p>but my mom is not a good person.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And he told me, I was talking to him on the phone yesterday,</p>
<p>and he told me that it took him several years</p>
<p>to really understand that.</p>
<p>You know, he loved her too,</p>
<p>but it takes, when you&rsquo;re getting abused like that,</p>
<p>especially my dad, my dad came from a good family,</p>
<p>everything else, and, you know, upstanding family.</p>
<p>And I think that when you&rsquo;re that victim of abuse,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;ve never seen it before,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never encountered it, and then it happens,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re like that frog in water all of a sudden.</p>
<p>You know, you get to the point where it gradually increases</p>
<p>until how do you get out of it?</p>
<p>Everybody else sees what&rsquo;s happening, but you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I grew up in that environment though, you know,</p>
<p>so it took me a long time to come to terms with that.</p>
<p>My sister came to terms with it long before I did.</p>
<p>You know, my sister, she&rsquo;s been a decade</p>
<p>without talking to my mom,</p>
<p>like she had tried to commit suicide, I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>What got me so bad is she said at one point</p>
<p>that she always thought someone was gonna come in</p>
<p>and save us, and my response, just immediate response,</p>
<p>not even thinking about it, my response was,</p>
<p>well, Denise, I knew no one ever was.</p>
<p>And looking at things now,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where our paths diverged.</p>
<p>Me, it was, if you wanna do it,</p>
<p>if anybody&rsquo;s gonna take care of you,</p>
<p>you gotta take care of yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on your own.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on your own, you know, it&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>And Denise has always been that child</p>
<p>that has expected someone to come in and save her.</p>
<p>Well, and almost like it&rsquo;s all going to be okay, somebody.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I knew it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, no, you go.</p>
<p>Unless you.</p>
<p>Unless you make it okay, it ain&rsquo;t gonna be okay.</p>
<p>So, you know, I was.</p>
<p>Are you able to forgive her, your mom?</p>
<p>My boundary with my mom, the reason I&rsquo;ve not spoken with her,</p>
<p>over two years ago, I started this legal career of mine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been the guy who has,</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time thinking about my past</p>
<p>and those choices and what brought those choices around.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m big about taking responsibility for my actions.</p>
<p>I truly am.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important you have to do that.</p>
<p>Well, my mom, not so much.</p>
<p>So I was talking to her, you know,</p>
<p>and I would start saying, you know,</p>
<p>she would start the conversation talking about,</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>why Denise wouldn&rsquo;t speak to her anymore.</p>
<p>That was one of her tropes.</p>
<p>So, and my response started to become,</p>
<p>well, because you were the abuser</p>
<p>and you spent your life doing that to her.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more healthy for her not to talk to you.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s still not able to see the flaws</p>
<p>in her ways of the past.</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>So my ultimatum to my mom was, look,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re able to admit</p>
<p>that you abused the people in your life,</p>
<p>accept that responsibility</p>
<p>and be able to discuss it with me, we&rsquo;ll have a talk.</p>
<p>Other than that, I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you anymore.</p>
<p>So for the first year it was, you know,</p>
<p>calling, cussing my wife out, cussing me out,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t need you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And then finally it started to taper off</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s never really contacted me after that point.</p>
<p>And your dad is dying.</p>
<p>What do you take from the way he&rsquo;s taken on death?</p>
<p>Just saying, fuck it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the man.</p>
<p>And what have you learned from your dad?</p>
<p>What do you love about your dad?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of these guys that, you know, like I told him,</p>
<p>I told my dad about the abuse and everything else.</p>
<p>And there was a point.</p>
<p>So, you know, I told you about the elevator stuff,</p>
<p>but before that, man, it was,</p>
<p>it took me 40 years to talk about that,</p>
<p>but it also took me 40 years to talk about,</p>
<p>there was a point that my mom and dad would leave the house</p>
<p>and I would urinate in the floor.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Is that like out of anger?</p>
<p>No, no idea why.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But I would.</p>
<p>Piss on the carpet.</p>
<p>Carpet pissers like the Lebowski, right?</p>
<p>It really tied the room together, dude.</p>
<p>It really tied the room together.</p>
<p>I was talking about that</p>
<p>and this lady comes up to me after the presentation</p>
<p>and she had a career previous to that</p>
<p>where she dealt with abused kids.</p>
<p>And she told me, she was like,</p>
<p>Brett, she&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a control mechanism.</p>
<p>The only control you had was that.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, kids do that.</p>
<p>And I was like, so I&rsquo;m not unique.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, no, you&rsquo;re not unique in that.</p>
<p>So that, you know, this whole history of abuse,</p>
<p>Denise dealt with it by drinking,</p>
<p>by trying to commit suicide, things like that.</p>
<p>And then finally she escapes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the kid that didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And not only that, my wife pointed out to me that,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s that Eastern Kentucky mentality stuff.</p>
<p>You know, the male&rsquo;s expected to do things.</p>
<p>So with me, it was almost like I stepped up</p>
<p>to take part in those crimes</p>
<p>so that Denise didn&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>And she was able to avoid all that.</p>
<p>Other than that one shoplifting stuff,</p>
<p>Denise doesn&rsquo;t break the law anymore.</p>
<p>She goes off to be a, she&rsquo;s a good parent.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an angry parent.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a good parent.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a teacher, a good citizen overall.</p>
<p>I was just the guy that kept right on going with it.</p>
<p>Kept on going.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about that.</p>
<p>So your life of cyber crime.</p>
<p>In describing some of the things you did or knew about,</p>
<p>you said, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I once stole several thousand dollars worth of coins</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;from a family trying to sell them</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;to put a new roof on their home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Another time, I sent a counterfeit cashier&rsquo;s check</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;to a victim and he ended up being arrested for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I lied to family, friends, everyone I knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was a truly despicable person.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One of my Ukrainian associates script</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;had someone who owed him money kidnapped and tortured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He posted pictures of it online.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Another member, Iceman,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;used to flood his enemy&rsquo;s email addresses</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;with child pornography, then called the police on them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some stories.</p>
<p>Can you tell some of these stories that stand out to you</p>
<p>that are particularly despicable or representative</p>
<p>or interesting when you look back</p>
<p>that defined your approach and who you were at that time?</p>
<p>Let me say that I did not care about my victim, all right?</p>
<p>I cared about me, is what I cared about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rough to admit that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t give a shit what you&rsquo;re doing to anybody else,</p>
<p>you only care about you.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t care about the victims.</p>
<p>The lady, that wasn&rsquo;t even at the beginning of my career</p>
<p>as a cyber criminal, that was right at the last of it.</p>
<p>Which lady?</p>
<p>The coin lady.</p>
<p>By that point, Shadow Crew had made</p>
<p>the front cover of Forbes, August of 04.</p>
<p>October 26th of 04, Secret Service had shut us down,</p>
<p>33 people arrested, six countries in six hours.</p>
<p>I was the guy that was publicly mentioned as getting away.</p>
<p>What happened was is I was the guy who was,</p>
<p>I had kind of invented this crime</p>
<p>called tax return identity theft</p>
<p>and was stealing a lot of money.</p>
<p>I went through all my stateside savings</p>
<p>and Shadow Crew gets shut down.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any way to come in with any money,</p>
<p>so I start running counterfeit cashier&rsquo;s checks,</p>
<p>defrauding people with that,</p>
<p>having them send products or bullion collections,</p>
<p>what have you, by COD, collect on delivery,</p>
<p>and I would pay with it</p>
<p>with a counterfeit cashier&rsquo;s check.</p>
<p>This lady was on eBay.</p>
<p>She had been collecting these silver coins all of her life.</p>
<p>You know, the U.S. currency used to be,</p>
<p>the coins used to be silver,</p>
<p>so she had a whole collection of these things,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know, 80, 90 pounds of this stuff,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a very good social engineer.</p>
<p>So, convinced her that I was a legitimate person,</p>
<p>that, you know, hey, send it to COD,</p>
<p>you can use my FedEx account to do that</p>
<p>or my UPS account to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pay with a cashier&rsquo;s check,</p>
<p>you can take it in, same as cash.</p>
<p>She believed that, she was, even on the ad,</p>
<p>and we talked on the phone and everything else,</p>
<p>she had told me that she was a single parent,</p>
<p>and it was the only money that she had</p>
<p>to put a roof on the house for her and her kids,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t give a damn.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t give a damn.</p>
<p>What was more important was me at that point.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question about the social engineering aspect?</p>
<p>So maybe specifics like the methodology,</p>
<p>email, you said phone,</p>
<p>maybe you could discuss this process</p>
<p>from a bigger philosophical perspective</p>
<p>of what is it about human beings</p>
<p>that makes it possible to be social engineer,</p>
<p>to be victims of fraud?</p>
<p>So, first let me say that I became a social engineer</p>
<p>as a child, all right, because the adults in my environment,</p>
<p>as a child, I had to know exactly what they were thinking</p>
<p>and be able to try to manipulate that for survival.</p>
<p>So I became a social engineer for survival initially,</p>
<p>all right, and one of the things that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>with a lot of cyber criminals is the exact same thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really expert ones.</p>
<p>They become a social engineer as a child,</p>
<p>then later on, they use those tools to victimize others.</p>
<p>Which is fascinating because you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>in order to understand what others are thinking,</p>
<p>you have to be extremely good at empathy.</p>
<p>So you have to like really put yourself</p>
<p>in the shoes of the other person.</p>
<p>And yet, in order to do cyber crime,</p>
<p>you have to not care about the pain</p>
<p>that might cause them once you manipulate them.</p>
<p>So you have to empathize and yet not care.</p>
<p>Exactly, and I would argue,</p>
<p>I would argue that that is not a sociopath</p>
<p>because a cyber criminal, and I was no different,</p>
<p>most cyber criminals justify those actions.</p>
<p>So the justification becomes what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>With me, the justification was why I did it for my family,</p>
<p>did it for my wife, did it for my stripper girlfriend.</p>
<p>So, and I believe those justifications.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good story, I heard that one.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>I like that, because I care about love a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the big picture of that is trust.</p>
<p>How do you establish trust with a potential victim?</p>
<p>All right, now I would argue online</p>
<p>that that trust is established through a combination</p>
<p>of technology, tools, social engineering.</p>
<p>All right, so we trust our tech.</p>
<p>We trust our cell phones, we trust our laptops.</p>
<p>A lot of times we don&rsquo;t understand how they operate,</p>
<p>but we trust the news that comes across the line.</p>
<p>We trust the phone numbers that show up.</p>
<p>We trust IP addresses if we&rsquo;re advanced enough</p>
<p>to look at an IP address or a domain</p>
<p>or anything else like that.</p>
<p>Criminals use tools to manipulate that,</p>
<p>spoof phone numbers, spoof browser fingerprints,</p>
<p>whatever that may be, whatever the tool may be.</p>
<p>Then that lays a base level of trust.</p>
<p>At that point, you shoot in with the social engineering</p>
<p>and lay whatever story that is in order to manipulate</p>
<p>that victim to act not out of reason,</p>
<p>but out of emotion all of a sudden.</p>
<p>This is fascinating about the way humans interact</p>
<p>with the world, which is you&rsquo;re almost too afraid</p>
<p>to not trust the world.</p>
<p>You have to find a balance.</p>
<p>You have a lot of conspiracy theories now</p>
<p>about distrusting institutions and thinking</p>
<p>like everything around us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve been listening to people</p>
<p>who believe the earth is flat.</p>
<p>And that conspiracy theory is fascinating to me</p>
<p>because it basically says that you can&rsquo;t trust anybody.</p>
<p>Like everything you hear is a lie.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one, you can live that life</p>
<p>or you can live a life</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just naively trusting everything.</p>
<p>And we as humans have to,</p>
<p>because that life is kind of full of happiness</p>
<p>if nobody screws you over.</p>
<p>Cause you meet people with the joyful heart</p>
<p>and you get excited and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But if you do that too much, you&rsquo;re gonna get burned.</p>
<p>So you have to find some kind of balance</p>
<p>in terms of optimizing happiness where you trust,</p>
<p>I mean, but verify and on the internet</p>
<p>that becomes really tricky.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re almost too afraid to distrust everything</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ll never get anything done on the internet.</p>
<p>But then if you trust too much, you can get screwed over.</p>
<p>And so the social engineering comes in where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I should trust this.</p>
<p>You kind of help them build the narrative</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So in a lot of the times that social engineering</p>
<p>is just feeding into what the victim wants to believe.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really coming up with a brand new story at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just knowing what that victim is,</p>
<p>what the motivations of that victim is</p>
<p>feeding into it at that point.</p>
<p>So you have to, again,</p>
<p>that social engineer has to almost immediately know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s driving that person that they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m working on a phone,</p>
<p>talking to someone over the phone,</p>
<p>I have to know within seconds what I need to say,</p>
<p>how I need to act to interact</p>
<p>with that customer service agent</p>
<p>or whoever I&rsquo;m talking to on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>So fascinating because you truly are empathizing</p>
<p>with the other person.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Who is it?</p>
<p>This business man, Steven Schwarzman.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked to a few times.</p>
<p>He mentioned this thing that,</p>
<p>the way you build deep relationships</p>
<p>is you really kind of notice</p>
<p>the things that people are telling you.</p>
<p>Like what they want and what they&rsquo;re bothered by,</p>
<p>what are their big problems in their lives?</p>
<p>Because everybody&rsquo;s saying that all the time</p>
<p>and most of us are just ignoring it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But if you take the time to listen,</p>
<p>you know somebody at that point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely you do.</p>
<p>Then you have to be able to dismiss it.</p>
<p>You have to dismiss it after.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking for that just to see</p>
<p>how I can manipulate that is what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>So the lady was one story,</p>
<p>another truly despicable story.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to script in a second.</p>
<p>But another truly despicable story.</p>
<p>We were one of the really first groups</p>
<p>that started phishing attacks.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s phishing?</p>
<p>So that is a social engineering attack.</p>
<p>PH by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, PH.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another social engineering attack.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sending that fake email out</p>
<p>that looks like it&rsquo;s coming from a website</p>
<p>or your financial organization or whatever</p>
<p>and saying, hey, we&rsquo;ve got a security problem.</p>
<p>We need you to update your account information.</p>
<p>Well, back then no one had ever seen a phishing attack.</p>
<p>So you could ask for all the information.</p>
<p>You were getting just complete identity profiles</p>
<p>on a phishing email.</p>
<p>Nowadays you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Nowadays you look for basically credentials</p>
<p>because everyone is aware of phishing.</p>
<p>But back then it was complete information.</p>
<p>We had phished out, I don&rsquo;t know, 200,000 eTrade accounts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we had the login credentials for.</p>
<p>The login password, yeah.</p>
<p>Login password, complete social, date of birth,</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s maiden account information, everything else.</p>
<p>So we had access to those eTrade accounts.</p>
<p>eTrade initially had no security in place.</p>
<p>So you could cash out the account,</p>
<p>ACH the money out to whatever account you wanted to,</p>
<p>went through just fine.</p>
<p>Made them alive on that for four to six months.</p>
<p>eTrade got to the point where you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do any ACH coming out.</p>
<p>They locked everything down.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re still sitting on thousands of eTrade accounts.</p>
<p>How do you make money on that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>So what you do is you find some fat cat that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got his retirement invested in blue chips.</p>
<p>Same time you find a penny stock,</p>
<p>you open up a brand new account, buy into that penny stock,</p>
<p>cash the fat cat out, buy into that same penny stock,</p>
<p>bump and dump schemes all of a sudden.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re destroying people&rsquo;s retirement accounts</p>
<p>for just a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Bam, bam, bam.</p>
<p>And of course, eTrade&rsquo;s response is, not our problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your problem.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t give up your password</p>
<p>or what have you at that point.</p>
<p>And you still see that issue today with Zelle scams</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>Which scam?</p>
<p>Zelle.</p>
<p>So you know, the instant payment that they have.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same kind of operation,</p>
<p>same type of difference with different payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>You find an easy way to exploit a system,</p>
<p>and typically the financial organization, not our problem.</p>
<p>Our system&rsquo;s secure, it&rsquo;s the humans, it&rsquo;s their errors.</p>
<p>Well, not really.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got some culpability in that,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just trying to avoid paying the part of the bill</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>One of the things, just to stand fishing for a bit,</p>
<p>is it really makes me sad because there&rsquo;s been people</p>
<p>on all kinds of platforms, including YouTube comments,</p>
<p>but emails too.</p>
<p>They figured out emails somehow.</p>
<p>So people are now seeing the followers</p>
<p>of this particular podcast who are fans,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re finding them on platforms like LinkedIn and YouTube</p>
<p>and so on, and they are figuring out</p>
<p>ways to get to those people by another channel, which</p>
<p>I suppose seems more authentic to those people.</p>
<p>So they send them an email from what looks like me,</p>
<p>and with this kind of loving message.</p>
<p>The interesting thing, the emails</p>
<p>sound like something I would write.</p>
<p>So these aren&rsquo;t even, at this stage, it&rsquo;s not even,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t feel automated.</p>
<p>Or if it&rsquo;s automated, there&rsquo;s a human in the loop</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really fine tuning it to a specific,</p>
<p>or maybe I&rsquo;m very predictable.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very loving in the way I would write that message.</p>
<p>So think about that, all right?</p>
<p>So when Phishing first comes out,</p>
<p>you could look at the language of the text or the website</p>
<p>and say, eh, if you were paying attention, that&rsquo;s so OK.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not an English speaker who wrote that, typically.</p>
<p>But as time has went on, as the awareness of what a Phishing</p>
<p>attack looks like, we have people</p>
<p>that are sitting down now and making sure</p>
<p>that the language is proper.</p>
<p>It gets worse than that, though.</p>
<p>If you look at business email compromise,</p>
<p>so the way a business email compromise typically works</p>
<p>is the attacker will find a payroll person, find a CEO.</p>
<p>He will fashion a spear phishing email, which</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s a Phishing attack that&rsquo;s targeting</p>
<p>one specific individual.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;ll fashion a spear phishing email.</p>
<p>And the way he does that is he pulls all the information</p>
<p>he possibly can on that person, that CEO.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;ll spear that CEO just to get their login credentials</p>
<p>to their email, just to read the emails.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll go in there, and he&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>reading all these emails.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll specifically read the emails to the payroll</p>
<p>department, see what that relationship is.</p>
<p>Are they talking about their kids,</p>
<p>talking about relationships, talking about vacation?</p>
<p>What are they talking about?</p>
<p>How are they talking?</p>
<p>Are they friendly?</p>
<p>Are they sterile?</p>
<p>What are they doing, all right?</p>
<p>So then he decides, well, I&rsquo;m going to go ahead</p>
<p>and spear phish the payroll department as well.</p>
<p>So then he spear phishes in, gets those credentials.</p>
<p>At the same time, he creates a Unicode domain</p>
<p>in whatever the company name is, all right?</p>
<p>So instead of that English alphabet I,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got that Russian letter that looks like an I</p>
<p>but without the dot on top, all right?</p>
<p>Comes back into the email, into the payroll email,</p>
<p>blocks the real CEO&rsquo;s email, replaces that with the Unicode</p>
<p>email that he&rsquo;s got, and then sends out a message</p>
<p>using the correct language, the correct relationships,</p>
<p>everything else, and says, hey, we&rsquo;re updating</p>
<p>our account status, I need you to send this payment</p>
<p>instead of over here, they&rsquo;ve set up a new account,</p>
<p>send all payments over here now.</p>
<p>And that is business email compromise in a nutshell,</p>
<p>all right, works great.</p>
<p>Probably the larger the organization,</p>
<p>the more susceptible to that kind of attack</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s like a distribution of responsibility</p>
<p>to where you&rsquo;re more likely to believe that,</p>
<p>okay, this other person is responsible,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they secured everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay listening to this.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s business email compromise,</p>
<p>and those crimes, and that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>you see about cybercrime.</p>
<p>Cybercrime&rsquo;s not really sophisticated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, the attacks are not sophisticated.</p>
<p>The stat is 90% of every single attack uses a known exploit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not zero day attacks, they&rsquo;re out there,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re a criminal waiting on a zero day to profit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna starve to death.</p>
<p>The meat and potatoes are that 90%, known exploits.</p>
<p>And then the rest is, well, you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>maybe you mean it&rsquo;s not technically sophisticated,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s social engineering sophisticated.</p>
<p>Very sophisticated on that end, very sophisticated.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a fascinating study of that.</p>
<p>That establishment of trust and then using that trust</p>
<p>to defraud that victim.</p>
<p>That is something.</p>
<p>I wish, obviously, all of these folks</p>
<p>are really good at hiding.</p>
<p>I wish you could tell their stories in a way,</p>
<p>which is why you&rsquo;re fascinating,</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re able to tell these stories now,</p>
<p>because it is studying human nature by exploiting it,</p>
<p>but you get to understand our weak points,</p>
<p>our hope, our desire to trust others.</p>
<p>Also, the weak points and the failures of digital systems</p>
<p>and at scale, humans have to connect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>This is a weird question, asking for a friend.</p>
<p>Is spear phishing itself illegal?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the legality here?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s all illegal.</p>
<p>Absolutely it is.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what, okay, let me construct an example.</p>
<p>So if my friend were to spear phish like a CEO, right,</p>
<p>and get their information and after they get control,</p>
<p>say, of their Twitter account,</p>
<p>they tweet something loving and positive, what&rsquo;s the crime?</p>
<p>Unauthorized access of advice.</p>
<p>What will be the punishment, do you think?</p>
<p>That becomes questionable.</p>
<p>So no monetary loss, or was there a monetary loss?</p>
<p>Probably not, all right?</p>
<p>So you have to figure out who the victim is</p>
<p>before charges are pressed.</p>
<p>Now, the crime would be unauthorized access, all right?</p>
<p>But no real victim on that,</p>
<p>unless the person whose account you took over</p>
<p>takes exception to that.</p>
<p>No monetary loss.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not really standard fines.</p>
<p>Probably nothing&rsquo;s gonna happen, right.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So, I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of interesting,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, so when I got the ransomware,</p>
<p>when I got the zero day attack on the QNAP mass,</p>
<p>they basically say the criminal is QNAP, the company,</p>
<p>for having so many security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, you are the victim of QNAP&rsquo;s incompetence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way they kind of phrase it.</p>
<p>And see, I don&rsquo;t agree with that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with that at all.</p>
<p>So, SolarWinds.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, so I&rsquo;ve got 130 page class action lawsuit</p>
<p>printed out at the house, I&rsquo;ve been going through it,</p>
<p>that catalogs how SolarWinds lied for years</p>
<p>about their vulnerabilities, and they lied to investors.</p>
<p>The people who came in, the honorees who they would hire,</p>
<p>would, you know, they would not pay attention to them</p>
<p>when they said, you know, you&rsquo;ve got these issues,</p>
<p>they would say, go away, shit like that for years,</p>
<p>until SolarWinds, you know, the attacks become apparent.</p>
<p>My view on that is that the only person</p>
<p>responsible for the crime are the criminals</p>
<p>who did the attacking, the actual criminals, not SolarWinds.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean that SolarWinds isn&rsquo;t all fucked up?</p>
<p>They are, and there needs to be some accounting in place.</p>
<p>But the only individual, the only people responsible</p>
<p>for crime are the criminals, and that&rsquo;s either online,</p>
<p>in the physical world, what have you.</p>
<p>Being an idiot is not a crime.</p>
<p>Not a crime.</p>
<p>You know, being criminally negligent is,</p>
<p>and I think that SolarWinds is certainly responsible,</p>
<p>not responsible, they&rsquo;re culpable for what happened.</p>
<p>Can you actually tell folks about SolarWinds?</p>
<p>What is it, what are some interesting things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re aware of?</p>
<p>SolarWinds was very, it provided a backbone of security</p>
<p>for hundreds, thousands of different companies.</p>
<p>If you looked at, a lot of security companies</p>
<p>were using SolarWinds that would allow you</p>
<p>to get a snapshot of the entire system</p>
<p>that they were working on.</p>
<p>So what happens is, is you get a Russian group that comes in</p>
<p>and they basically, they hack into SolarWinds</p>
<p>and get access to it, and it allows them</p>
<p>to view every single thing, I mean, every single thing</p>
<p>about every single client that SolarWinds had at that point.</p>
<p>So entire snapshots of all the IP that was going on,</p>
<p>all the emails, all the communications,</p>
<p>every single secret that was going on with those companies.</p>
<p>If a company had software like Microsoft,</p>
<p>it allowed them to look at the source code</p>
<p>of everything that was going on.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just a complete and total nightmare, all right?</p>
<p>And something that you are not going to recover from.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s done at that point.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s not been a lot of news lately about it,</p>
<p>but the fact of the matter is, is that&rsquo;s the type of attack</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a catastrophic attack.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge amount of information</p>
<p>that was read, saved elsewhere probably.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>And so now there&rsquo;s people sitting on information.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So think about one of the attack vectors</p>
<p>has been Microsoft Outlook 365, things like that.</p>
<p>This allowed the attackers to look</p>
<p>at the source codes of that.</p>
<p>So they have the source code now,</p>
<p>so they go through it line by line.</p>
<p>Where are the vulnerabilities?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find new vulnerabilities, new zero days.</p>
<p>You know, I said zero days aren&rsquo;t common,</p>
<p>but this opens up an entire new threat surface</p>
<p>all of a sudden.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a completely catastrophic attack.</p>
<p>Once all the chips are down, everything&rsquo;s tallied up,</p>
<p>people are going to be like, yeah, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, this whole computer thing,</p>
<p>we tried it and we&rsquo;re walking away.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that there&rsquo;s not been obvious</p>
<p>big negative impact from that yet.</p>
<p>So, but like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of negative impact,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re just starting.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So the capacity for destruction is huge here.</p>
<p>How much involvement from nation states</p>
<p>do you think there is on this?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got Iran, you&rsquo;ve got North Korea,</p>
<p>China, Russia, you got the big four.</p>
<p>You also got Brazil.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got all these other countries</p>
<p>that are interested in the United States as well.</p>
<p>Nation states are interesting</p>
<p>depending on who the nation state is.</p>
<p>All right, so Russia is very good about working</p>
<p>with the type of criminal that I used to be.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;ll enlist these guys</p>
<p>and steal information or what have you,</p>
<p>then Russia will take the information they want to,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll basically go off and sell whatever you want to</p>
<p>and make some money.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s all about IP.</p>
<p>North Korea is about stealing money</p>
<p>because they really don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the hell else to do right now, but&hellip;</p>
<p>So North Korea is actively involved in cybercrime.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve stolen a shitload of Bitcoin, everything else.</p>
<p>So absolutely, they&rsquo;re actively involved with that.</p>
<p>Very, very skilled attackers, very skilled.</p>
<p>But even if you look at, you know,</p>
<p>I told you that stat about 90%, all right?</p>
<p>So even though SolarWinds is going to be</p>
<p>the number one attack,</p>
<p>the followup to that is this NotPetya attack that happened.</p>
<p>And so that was the most sophisticated attack</p>
<p>launched by the Russian Sandworm Group</p>
<p>using all known exploits throughout.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, again, it&rsquo;s not&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right in the sophistication</p>
<p>is typically not technical sophistication,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a social engineering sophistication.</p>
<p>How do you get these things put together</p>
<p>in line to attack and succeed?</p>
<p>But when you get access to the source code,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where technical sophistication could really do</p>
<p>a lot of damage.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you find out real quick,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what separates the men from the boys in this game.</p>
<p>All right, because all of a sudden it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to worry about social engineering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got source codes and I&rsquo;ve got professionals</p>
<p>that are looking at that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s your ass.</p>
<p>Which then enables probably even more powerful</p>
<p>social engineering methods too.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just the cascade of&hellip;</p>
<p>Is this terrifying to you, by the way?</p>
<p>That this world that we&rsquo;re living in,</p>
<p>as we put more and more of ourselves on the internet,</p>
<p>into the metaverse, that there&rsquo;s so many more</p>
<p>attack vectors on our wellbeing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s terrifying to me, I used to preach it on Shadow Crew,</p>
<p>is the idea that the perception of truth</p>
<p>is more important than the truth itself.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the facts are,</p>
<p>it matters what I can convince you of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s terrifying to me.</p>
<p>So you look at deep fakes, you look at fake news,</p>
<p>all this stuff that&rsquo;s going out,</p>
<p>that becomes truly terrifying.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s an angle where it&rsquo;s freeing,</p>
<p>if nothing is true and you can&rsquo;t trust anything.</p>
<p>But you see, we as human beings, we wanna trust.</p>
<p>We do, we need human interaction.</p>
<p>And for that human interaction,</p>
<p>you have to have a degree of trust.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more like you let go of an idea of absolute truth</p>
<p>and it more becomes like a blockchain style consensus.</p>
<p>So you let go of like, you know what?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this human dream, you get this on the internet,</p>
<p>you get like facts, as if there&rsquo;s at the bottom,</p>
<p>at the bottom, there&rsquo;s one turtle that&rsquo;s holding</p>
<p>this scroll that says, these are the truths of the world.</p>
<p>The problem is, I mean, maybe believing</p>
<p>that is counterproductive.</p>
<p>Maybe human civilization is an ongoing process of consensus.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s always going to be, everything is shrouded</p>
<p>and you can call them lies or you can call them inaccuracies</p>
<p>or you can call them delusions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s constantly going to be, it&rsquo;s going to be a sea of lies</p>
<p>and delusions, but our hope is to over time</p>
<p>develop bigger and bigger islands of consensus</p>
<p>that allows us to live a stable and happy society.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t call it true, call it a stable consensus</p>
<p>that creates a high quality of life</p>
<p>for the inhabitants of the island.</p>
<p>I like it, I mean, I like it.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re going to agree on this.</p>
<p>And then don&rsquo;t use outlook, no, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>So maybe a step back, you mentioned, I&rsquo;d love to talk</p>
<p>about ShadowCrew, maybe this is the right time</p>
<p>to actually, yeah, let&rsquo;s go to ShadowCrew</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a fascinating story.</p>
<p>So tell me the story of building ShadowCrew,</p>
<p>the precursor to today&rsquo;s darknet and darknet markets.</p>
<p>This is why you&rsquo;re the original Godfather.</p>
<p>This is it, this is it.</p>
<p>So I get married.</p>
<p>I faked a car accident to get married,</p>
<p>got the money from that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re romantic.</p>
<p>I remember, like my dad, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the guy that, you know, I get from mom,</p>
<p>I get the criminal mindset.</p>
<p>From dad, I get that, don&rsquo;t want him to leave.</p>
<p>So, you know, so.</p>
<p>To get married, what&rsquo;s that story?</p>
<p>Oh, dude, I was.</p>
<p>How did you fall in love there?</p>
<p>My first girlfriend was a preacher&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>and crazy over her, dated her for five years.</p>
<p>And she figured out pretty quickly that,</p>
<p>well, not quickly, it took her five years</p>
<p>to figure out that Brett Johnson is not the man of God.</p>
<p>I could talk it, but more that agnostic than anything,</p>
<p>she breaks up with me.</p>
<p>So I was at the community college.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d make one hell of a preacher by the way.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got that Langston Hughes problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for Jesus to show up and he just doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I was at the community college</p>
<p>and I was a straight asshole.</p>
<p>I was arrogant, conceited, everything else.</p>
<p>And I had posted an advertisement</p>
<p>on one of the billboards looking for an adult babysitter,</p>
<p>hot blonde, you know, come visit me in the library.</p>
<p>Buddy of mine shows up and he&rsquo;s like, Brett.</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, hottest girl in school, right down the hall.</p>
<p>And I was like, serious?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>And I was like, let&rsquo;s go see.</p>
<p>Walk over and there&rsquo;s these two guys that are hitting on her.</p>
<p>So I just walk up and me and Todd, that was my buddy,</p>
<p>walk up and I&rsquo;m just sitting there and listening.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re giving the spill and everything.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s just kind of taking it in.</p>
<p>Finally, I looked over and I was like,</p>
<p>you want to get out of here?</p>
<p>And one of the guys looks at me and he&rsquo;s like, hey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking to you.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, you&rsquo;re talking at her.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not talking to her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to save her ass from you.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a smooth pick up line, by the way.</p>
<p>If I ever heard one, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>You want to get out of here?</p>
<p>So start dating, and she was the girl</p>
<p>that screwed my brains out.</p>
<p>And I fell head over heels.</p>
<p>We got married six months later.</p>
<p>Six months.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what love does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it does.</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t know I was a crook.</p>
<p>She had no idea.</p>
<p>She knew I was very bright.</p>
<p>She knew I did a lot of theater, stuff like that.</p>
<p>Got a job at, I was in hazard.</p>
<p>There was no jobs to be had, so I got a job in Lexington,</p>
<p>because we were going to be moving to the UK.</p>
<p>Got a job in Lexington at Lexmark testing printer boards,</p>
<p>circuit boards.</p>
<p>So I would leave on a Thursday night,</p>
<p>work three 18 hour shifts at Lexmark,</p>
<p>come back home on Monday.</p>
<p>Got married, faked a car accident</p>
<p>to get the rest of the money that I needed to get married.</p>
<p>And the faking on that, man, I had bought a Chevy Spectrum</p>
<p>at a car auction.</p>
<p>Gave like $500 for it.</p>
<p>My aunt had previously defrauded USAA insurance</p>
<p>on a car accident, and she was telling me all about it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, look, go down to this chiropractor.</p>
<p>Make sure you get the insurance where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll pay for a rental car.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll pay lost wages.</p>
<p>I was like, they pay lost wages?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, yeah, they pay lost wages.</p>
<p>I was like, hmm.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, by the way, you work for me.</p>
<p>And I was like, I work for you.</p>
<p>And you get to define the wage.</p>
<p>And you could also define how long you were unable to work.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And the chiropractor will sign off on any damn thing.</p>
<p>So my cousin, Ronnie, he figures out that I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>He finds out I&rsquo;m going to fake this car accident.</p>
<p>So he comes to me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, hey, man, can I get in on that?</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, man, you get on that.</p>
<p>So this kid, he&rsquo;s five days younger than I am.</p>
<p>This kid, he goes to the dentist the day</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re faking it, has a tooth pulled,</p>
<p>tells the dentist not to numb it, not to stitch it,</p>
<p>just pull it.</p>
<p>So he shows up.</p>
<p>He shows up the day that we&rsquo;re driving out</p>
<p>to fake the accident.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got blood all over his shirt.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still bleeding out of the mouth and everything else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, are you OK?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, man, it&rsquo;s going to be good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, OK.</p>
<p>My mom, by this point, I&rsquo;m living with my grandparents.</p>
<p>My mom is up in the head of a hollow.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;ll just do it up there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go act like we&rsquo;re visiting my mom on the way back out,</p>
<p>ran over a mountain.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>So we go visit and everything, come back out that night,</p>
<p>run over the side of the hill.</p>
<p>Me and Ronnie walk back up.</p>
<p>Of course, it totals the car.</p>
<p>Walk back to my mom&rsquo;s, acting like we&rsquo;ve wrecked.</p>
<p>She knows what time it is and everything else.</p>
<p>And file the claims.</p>
<p>So that gets the money to get married.</p>
<p>And me and my wife moved from Hazard to Lexington.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m the kid that my crime, usually, if I was a single guy,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t break the law.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I would be all right.</p>
<p>But females involved, oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Got to spend the money.</p>
<p>Got to show them gifts.</p>
<p>Everything else was never enough to show love</p>
<p>in some sort of healthy way.</p>
<p>Always had to go overboard.</p>
<p>And typically, it was buying or stealing</p>
<p>some sort of expensive crap.</p>
<p>So that was the thing.</p>
<p>That was the way you show love is by buying expensive gifts.</p>
<p>Or something overboard.</p>
<p>Back then, with Susan, initially, it was,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about working.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>You just worry about going to school.</p>
<p>She was a music major.</p>
<p>I was like, you just worry about going to school.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t worry about cooking and cleaning.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>So not only was I this guy that was going overboard,</p>
<p>but I was kind of a control freak, too.</p>
<p>So no, I got it.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>So here I am, 60 hour a week job, 18 hour class load,</p>
<p>cooking and cleaning.</p>
<p>Something had to give.</p>
<p>I quit the job.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Quit the job and start back in fraud.</p>
<p>And trying to hide that from her at the same time.</p>
<p>So it was initially telemarketing fraud.</p>
<p>The first job I had was a telemarketer at a cemetery,</p>
<p>selling gravesites.</p>
<p>And then that ended.</p>
<p>Went over to work for the Shriners Circus, Shriners</p>
<p>Hospital.</p>
<p>And it was a third party company that</p>
<p>was doing all the telemarketing.</p>
<p>Made really good money doing that.</p>
<p>That job ended.</p>
<p>And then they pivoted over to working with Kiwanis Clubs,</p>
<p>selling food baskets to the food banks and everything.</p>
<p>So I stole the phone list and started at my own Kiwanis Club</p>
<p>and would do the telemarketing, go out twice a week</p>
<p>and pick up checks.</p>
<p>Well, what happened was is I&rsquo;m going out picking up checks,</p>
<p>go knock on a door.</p>
<p>Turns out one of the persons that I had called</p>
<p>was a law enforcement officer.</p>
<p>So he was like, who are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with the Kiwanis Club.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, no, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So got arrested, spent three months in a county jail</p>
<p>for theft by deception.</p>
<p>Got out.</p>
<p>And we had to move from Lexington back to Hazard</p>
<p>and live with Susan&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>They had gotten a desktop computer, HP.</p>
<p>And I started surfing around online.</p>
<p>Found eBay.</p>
<p>And didn&rsquo;t really know how to make money on eBay.</p>
<p>At about the same time, I&rsquo;m committing low level frauds</p>
<p>online.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t really talk about that in the past.</p>
<p>The first time I&rsquo;ve really talked about that.</p>
<p>But I would pay for it with bad checks.</p>
<p>So more person, so not using a platform like eBay and more.</p>
<p>I would find somebody that had like a stereo system on eBay,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d pay for it with a bad check</p>
<p>and would rely on them not to chase me</p>
<p>because they were out of state at that point.</p>
<p>And the dollar amounts were very low.</p>
<p>So got the money to move to finally</p>
<p>did those schemes enough to get the money</p>
<p>to move back to Lexington.</p>
<p>Got to Lexington.</p>
<p>And by this point, I&rsquo;m doing, like I said,</p>
<p>these schemes on eBay.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, there&rsquo;s got to be a better way</p>
<p>to make money on eBay.</p>
<p>Got to be.</p>
<p>So didn&rsquo;t really know how.</p>
<p>One night, I&rsquo;m watching Inside Edition with Bill Riley.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re profiling Beanie Babies.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sitting there watching.</p>
<p>The one they&rsquo;re profiling is this one called Peanut,</p>
<p>the Royal Blue Elephant.</p>
<p>Selling for $1,500 on eBay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting there going like, shit,</p>
<p>I need to find me a peanut.</p>
<p>My initial thought was, well, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got to be one in one of these Hallmark stores</p>
<p>in Kentucky someplace.</p>
<p>So I skip class the next day.</p>
<p>Went out around all the Hallmark stores looking for peanut.</p>
<p>No, idiot.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on eBay for $1,500.</p>
<p>So after a few hours of that, I&rsquo;m like, hmm.</p>
<p>Turns out they had a little gray Beanie Baby elephants</p>
<p>for $8.</p>
<p>Picked up one of those for $8.</p>
<p>Stopped by Kroger on the way home.</p>
<p>Picked up a pack of Blue Rit dye.</p>
<p>Went home, tried to dye the little guy.</p>
<p>So that was a nightmare.</p>
<p>Turns out they&rsquo;re made out of polyester.</p>
<p>Get them out of the bath.</p>
<p>Looks like they&rsquo;ve got the mange.</p>
<p>And what happens is, so I&rsquo;m trying to dye the damn thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, that&rsquo;s not going to work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not going to work.</p>
<p>So I got online, found a picture of a real one,</p>
<p>posted it on eBay, and I was like, well, what I can do</p>
<p>is I can claim that&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>and then maybe claim that it got messed up in the mail</p>
<p>and work out like that.</p>
<p>So posted a picture of a real one online.</p>
<p>Woman thought I had the real thing.</p>
<p>She wins the bid.</p>
<p>That social engineering kicks in immediately.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to be on the defensive.</p>
<p>I wanted to put her on the defensive.</p>
<p>So as soon as she wins the bid, I send her a message.</p>
<p>Hey, we&rsquo;ve not done any business before.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if I can trust you.</p>
<p>What I need you to do, protects us both.</p>
<p>Go down the US Postal Service.</p>
<p>Get two money orders totaling $1,500.</p>
<p>Send them to me issued by the US government.</p>
<p>That way we&rsquo;re both protected.</p>
<p>Soon as I get the money orders, I&rsquo;ll send you your animal.</p>
<p>She believed that.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t ask any questions at all.</p>
<p>She believed that.</p>
<p>Sent me the money orders.</p>
<p>I cashed them out.</p>
<p>Sent her the creature.</p>
<p>Immediately got a phone call.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t order this.</p>
<p>My response, lady, you ordered a blue elephant.</p>
<p>I sent you a blue fish elephant.</p>
<p>And she got pissed.</p>
<p>And she kept calling.</p>
<p>What I found out, and that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>the first lesson of cybercrime that most of these criminals,</p>
<p>including self, learns.</p>
<p>If you delay a victim long enough,</p>
<p>just keep putting them off.</p>
<p>A lot of them, they get exasperated,</p>
<p>throw their hands in the air, walk away.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hear from them.</p>
<p>And none of them, to this day, none of them</p>
<p>complain to law enforcement.</p>
<p>They eat it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a mixture of you&rsquo;re exhausted by the process,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just easier to walk away,</p>
<p>and second, almost like an embarrassment.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole slew of reasons, all right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the exhaustion, certainly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the embarrassment.</p>
<p>So if you figure out, if you look at it today,</p>
<p>where does the embarrassment come from?</p>
<p>Well, the media, family members,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all very good about blaming the victim for crimes.</p>
<p>Why would you click on the link?</p>
<p>Why would you send money to somebody you don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got that that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the issue of, who do you complain to?</p>
<p>Back then, you didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Do you complain to local police?</p>
<p>Because she&rsquo;s in another state, so which local police</p>
<p>do you complain to?</p>
<p>Do you complain to the feds?</p>
<p>Well, the dollar amounts aren&rsquo;t high enough</p>
<p>to complain to feds.</p>
<p>Feds are going to tell you to go local.</p>
<p>Local&rsquo;s going to tell you, hey, it happened in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Complain to them.</p>
<p>Kentucky&rsquo;s going to tell you, well, shit, you&rsquo;re over there.</p>
<p>We need you to come in.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this whole issue of the jurisdiction,</p>
<p>of the blame factor, everything else.</p>
<p>So I got away with that crime and did it under my own name</p>
<p>at that point.</p>
<p>I kept going and got better at it,</p>
<p>started to understand how to hide identities,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>Started selling pirated software.</p>
<p>Pirated software led into installing mod chips.</p>
<p>The initial pirated software was Sega Saturn, PlayStation 1.</p>
<p>Well, you had to have a mod chip in those</p>
<p>to play the pirated disk, so I started</p>
<p>selling and installing mod chips.</p>
<p>That led into installing mod chips in the cable television</p>
<p>boxes so you could watch all the pay per view, which in turn</p>
<p>led into programming satellite DSS cards.</p>
<p>Those 18 inch RCA satellite systems,</p>
<p>pull the card out of it, program it, turns on all the channels.</p>
<p>Started doing that.</p>
<p>Can we just pause?</p>
<p>That is very entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>So just technically, so there&rsquo;s laws and rules</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re breaking nonstop.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also legitimate ways of doing</p>
<p>that, which is break the rules of the conventions of the past.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first principles thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Elon Musk and his ilk do all the time.</p>
<p>That is guts and brilliance.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s crossing the lines of the law,</p>
<p>actually sometimes the law is outdated.</p>
<p>The thing is, as a human being, you</p>
<p>have to then compute the ethical damage you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Like ethically, the damage you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing about other human beings, that is fundamentally</p>
<p>the thing that you&rsquo;re breaking, is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>adding to the suffering in the world in one way or another,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re justifying it.</p>
<p>But in terms of me sort of as an engineer,</p>
<p>that is some gutsy thinking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how Woz and Steve Jobs thought.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s innovation.</p>
<p>And maybe just think, if you can introspect your thinking</p>
<p>process here, this is a new, I like</p>
<p>how you remember this in HP, this</p>
<p>is a totally new thing to you.</p>
<p>Computers is another domain.</p>
<p>How were you figuring these puzzles out,</p>
<p>presumably mostly alone?</p>
<p>Alone.</p>
<p>When you were thinking through these problems, is there,</p>
<p>this is a strange question to ask,</p>
<p>but what is your thinking process?</p>
<p>What is your approach to solving these problems?</p>
<p>So the approach is you do something, and you fuck it up,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, you think back, OK, how do I fix that?</p>
<p>You fix that aspect, you commit the crime again.</p>
<p>And it goes a little bit further, and it screws up.</p>
<p>OK, how do I fix that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the issue on that?</p>
<p>How do I fix that?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not a deep design thinking like that?</p>
<p>Later on, it becomes that.</p>
<p>Once you lay that groundwork of the way</p>
<p>these schemes are working, it becomes that.</p>
<p>And you can apply that to other things in cybercrime</p>
<p>as a whole.</p>
<p>But initially, it&rsquo;s basically trial and error.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a problem, how do you solve that problem?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m committing these crimes under my name,</p>
<p>how do I solve that?</p>
<p>Well, one of the first principles</p>
<p>that we started to teach on Shadow Crew</p>
<p>is all crime should begin with identity theft.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the main first principles</p>
<p>that a lot of people to this day still don&rsquo;t really get.</p>
<p>All right, why would I commit a crime under my name</p>
<p>if I can do it under your name?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the big buffers.</p>
<p>And that takes trial and error to get</p>
<p>to that point where you start to understand</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way crime should operate if you&rsquo;re a criminal.</p>
<p>But with me, it&rsquo;s trial and error.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that childhood where that mindset</p>
<p>is kind of ingrained in you where you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>for ways, let&rsquo;s say nontraditional ways</p>
<p>of getting around things or getting through things.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the questions I&rsquo;ll probably ask this later</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s also a unique aspect to the outcome</p>
<p>of what you were doing, which is you weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t get caught for a very long time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about why that is.</p>
<p>And the thing is, it&rsquo;s so interesting,</p>
<p>all crime probably should, to be effective,</p>
<p>should start with identity theft.</p>
<p>I like that identity theft</p>
<p>because identity theft can take so many forms.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So yes, so Shadow Crew.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s, so as we&rsquo;re, you started with love.</p>
<p>Started with love.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re doing these schemes online.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m selling to these,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m programming these satellite DSS cards.</p>
<p>And one of the interesting things,</p>
<p>and you still see that to this day,</p>
<p>is something will happen</p>
<p>that will create an industry for criminals, all right?</p>
<p>So what happened is Canada, Canadian judge,</p>
<p>rules about the same time</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m doing these satellite cards,</p>
<p>Canadian judge comes out and says,</p>
<p>hey, it&rsquo;s legal for my citizens to pirate those signals.</p>
<p>And his reasoning was is since RCA</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sell the systems up here,</p>
<p>my citizens can pirate it.</p>
<p>Okay, so what happens is is overnight,</p>
<p>about the same time PayPal comes into play.</p>
<p>So PayPal is coming right online at about the same time.</p>
<p>Overnight, a little cottage industry</p>
<p>pops up in the United States.</p>
<p>You go down to Best Buy, buy the system for $100,</p>
<p>take it out in the parking lot, open system up,</p>
<p>pull it, open box up, pull the system out,</p>
<p>pull the card out, throw the system away,</p>
<p>program the card, ship its ass to Canada, $500 a pop.</p>
<p>Started doing that.</p>
<p>Business is good.</p>
<p>Making, you know, $3,000, $4,000 a week doing that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I have so many orders, I can&rsquo;t fill all the orders</p>
<p>and quickly think to myself,</p>
<p>why do I need to fill any of them?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in Canada.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m down here.</p>
<p>You know, who are they gonna complain to?</p>
<p>Because I already found out people don&rsquo;t complain, all right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna complain to anybody.</p>
<p>So I start not.</p>
<p>Especially in Canada.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m having them send money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when PayPal&rsquo;s first into play.</p>
<p>And it amazes me that everybody is using PayPal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t even have to really ask.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, can we pay by,</p>
<p>yeah, you can pay all day long by PayPal.</p>
<p>And PayPal had no clue what they were doing with security.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re sending money to PayPal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having the PayPal cashed out to bank accounts</p>
<p>in my name at that point.</p>
<p>And I get scared because by that point,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still in four to $6,000 a week.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, somebody&rsquo;s gonna be looking at money laundering.</p>
<p>So get it in my head.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, best thing that I can do</p>
<p>is get a fake driver&rsquo;s license,</p>
<p>open up a bank account using that driver&rsquo;s license,</p>
<p>cash out at the ATM.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>No idea where to get a fake ID.</p>
<p>Not a clue.</p>
<p>So I get online, looked around.</p>
<p>Spent a couple of weeks looking around.</p>
<p>Thought I found a guy.</p>
<p>He went by the screen name of Fake ID Man.</p>
<p>Thought I found a guy, sent him $200, sent him my picture.</p>
<p>Dude rips me off.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, what the hell, man?</p>
<p>Oh, I got played.</p>
<p>He had a little website set up with reviews.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, it&rsquo;s all legitimate.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s building that trust that I talked about.</p>
<p>So the end result, I got pissed.</p>
<p>And there was no site that dealt with anything</p>
<p>criminal or cyber crime related.</p>
<p>The only real avenue you had was an IRC chat session,</p>
<p>internet relay chat.</p>
<p>And that, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been on that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this rolling chat board.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know who the hell you&rsquo;re talking to.</p>
<p>Most of them are full of shit.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t trust anybody.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re sitting there trying to conduct business.</p>
<p>So if somebody claims they&rsquo;ve got a product or service,</p>
<p>do they have it?</p>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<p>Are they just gonna rip you off?</p>
<p>Because in those channels, everyone&rsquo;s a criminal.</p>
<p>I kept looking around and I&rsquo;ve happened upon a website</p>
<p>called Counterfeit Library.</p>
<p>And Counterfeit Library only dealt with counterfeit degrees</p>
<p>and certificates, degree mail type stuff.</p>
<p>But they had a forum and no one was using the forum.</p>
<p>So I basically get on there and bitch every day.</p>
<p>I got ripped off, don&rsquo;t know what to do,</p>
<p>bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.</p>
<p>About the same time I started doing that,</p>
<p>two other guys show up.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s named Mr. X, he&rsquo;s out of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Other guy&rsquo;s named Beelzebub,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>And we all become buddies.</p>
<p>So a few weeks of me bitching,</p>
<p>a few weeks of them responding.</p>
<p>Beelzebub gets me on ICQ and he sends me a message.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I went by the screen name of Gollum</p>
<p>at that point, Gollum Fun.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, Gollum, I can make you</p>
<p>a fake driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, motherfucker, do it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, I&rsquo;m gonna charge you for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, you are.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I am.</p>
<p>I was like, no, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, look, man, he said,</p>
<p>this business, if you&rsquo;re gonna do this,</p>
<p>you have to trust people or you&rsquo;re gonna fail.</p>
<p>He said, so I&rsquo;m gonna charge you $200,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna send you a driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>Well, by this point, I&rsquo;m friends with the people</p>
<p>who own Counterfeit Library.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re emailing, chatting, everything else.</p>
<p>And I tell him, I&rsquo;m like, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna send you $200.</p>
<p>That way, when you rip me off, I&rsquo;ll have them ban you</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have to deal with you anymore.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, bet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>So I sent him $200, sent him my picture.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, I get a driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>Name is Steven Schwecki out of Ohio.</p>
<p>And real guy, worked at ADP payroll to this day,</p>
<p>works at ADP, is where the guy works.</p>
<p>Got the driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>And to me, at that point in time,</p>
<p>it was the prettiest thing that I&rsquo;d ever seen.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;d never seen a fake ID before.</p>
<p>I thought it was great.</p>
<p>Turns out, you know, looking back, it was like, eh.</p>
<p>So, but.</p>
<p>That is kind of a strong first step</p>
<p>in creating a fake identity.</p>
<p>Very strong, very strong.</p>
<p>So this is. So that was like, Gasko just,</p>
<p>on the point he made, that if you&rsquo;re gonna be successful</p>
<p>in this, you should have people you trust.</p>
<p>Is he right on that?</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s absolute.</p>
<p>So you have to have, this is like mob.</p>
<p>You have to.</p>
<p>You have to have an inner circle that you trust.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve probably</p>
<p>heard me say this before.</p>
<p>Successful cyber crime, all right?</p>
<p>There are three necessities to being successful online</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a criminal.</p>
<p>Three necessities are gathering data,</p>
<p>committing the crime, and then cashing it out.</p>
<p>All three of those necessities have to work in conjunction.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t, the crime fails.</p>
<p>The problem, and it&rsquo;s a huge problem,</p>
<p>is that one guy can&rsquo;t do all three things.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got the people who gather the data.</p>
<p>Basically, the general store sells people</p>
<p>who sell PII, credit card logins, data tools.</p>
<p>They always sell the spoofed phone numbers</p>
<p>and the RDPs, stuff like that.</p>
<p>A lot of the times, those people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to commit the crime.</p>
<p>And those people certainly don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to launder the money out, put cash in pocket.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got, either because of a skill level,</p>
<p>sometimes a geographic location,</p>
<p>limits what that individual can do, all right?</p>
<p>So you have to rely on people who are good in areas</p>
<p>where you are not in order for that crime to succeed.</p>
<p>And that means you have to trust those people.</p>
<p>So what happens with Shadow Crew, all right?</p>
<p>So Counterfeit Library is the start, all right?</p>
<p>Counterfeit Library transitions over to Shadow Crew.</p>
<p>Right before that transition, there&rsquo;s a Ukrainian guy.</p>
<p>By the name of Dmitry Golubov.</p>
<p>He was a spammer at that point in time.</p>
<p>He saw what we were doing with Counterfeit Library</p>
<p>and he liked it.</p>
<p>He was getting all these credit card details</p>
<p>and this kid, I mean, he&rsquo;s a kid.</p>
<p>This kid has an idea.</p>
<p>And his idea was, I wonder if people would buy</p>
<p>stolen credit card details.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good Ukrainian Russian accent.</p>
<p>So he picks up the phone, he calls his buddies.</p>
<p>They call their buddies.</p>
<p>They have a physical conference in Odessa.</p>
<p>150 of these cyber criminals show up.</p>
<p>And they launched this idea,</p>
<p>this launches a website called Carter Planet,</p>
<p>which is the genesis of all modern credit card theft</p>
<p>as we know it, all right?</p>
<p>And so, remember I mentioned those three necessities</p>
<p>of cyber crime.</p>
<p>Dmitry had all the credit data in the world.</p>
<p>And he partnered with all these other Ukrainians</p>
<p>who had all this data as well.</p>
<p>The problem was, is so much fraud had been committed</p>
<p>on that Eastern side of Europe,</p>
<p>that every card had been shut down.</p>
<p>Even if you were a legitimate card holder</p>
<p>and tried to cash it out,</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t doing it at that point.</p>
<p>So again, those three necessities,</p>
<p>gathering data, committing crime, cashing out.</p>
<p>Dmitry had the data.</p>
<p>They could commit the crime.</p>
<p>They could not put cash in pocket.</p>
<p>So we were running counterfeit library.</p>
<p>One day I get this message,</p>
<p>or not a message, one day script shows up.</p>
<p>And he posts just on the general forum.</p>
<p>He posts, hey, I&rsquo;ve got credit card data.</p>
<p>Give me an address, give me a burner phone number,</p>
<p>wait five business days, order whatever you want to.</p>
<p>We had never seen anything like that.</p>
<p>We were a PayPal fraud and eBay fraud site,</p>
<p>is what we were, and fake driver&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
<p>So then, and we had,</p>
<p>I guess we had two, 3,000 members at that point.</p>
<p>So the response from the members was, that can&rsquo;t be real.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta be law enforcement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be trying to get us arrested and everything else.</p>
<p>What, let me backtrack a little bit.</p>
<p>So the driver&rsquo;s license that I had got,</p>
<p>Beelzebub had an idea.</p>
<p>What he wanted to do is he wanted to sell driver&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
<p>Mr. X wanted to sell social security cards.</p>
<p>He made a very passable social security card.</p>
<p>Me, I didn&rsquo;t, I had no skill level on that.</p>
<p>I knew PayPal fraud and eBay fraud.</p>
<p>So Beelzebub was like, I&rsquo;ll tell you what,</p>
<p>you be the reviewer.</p>
<p>That way you get every product or service that comes in.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have to send it to you or let you have access to it.</p>
<p>You can learn the entire game.</p>
<p>And because you&rsquo;re not selling anything,</p>
<p>it gives you legitimacy on the reviews, all right?</p>
<p>So I started out as a reviewer,</p>
<p>the only reviewer on Counterfeit Library.</p>
<p>So over the next year, Beelzebub turns out</p>
<p>he was a pot grower.</p>
<p>He goes back to growing pot</p>
<p>because he wasn&rsquo;t making shit selling driver&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
<p>Mr. X, about a year and a half in,</p>
<p>he gets arrested cashing out driver&rsquo;s, not credit cards,</p>
<p>cashing out to casinos, doing some shit with that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m the only guy left standing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m at the top of the heap.</p>
<p>And it becomes this thing where if I review somebody,</p>
<p>they make a lot of money.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t do business here.</p>
<p>So script shows up saying he&rsquo;s got this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the only reviewer on site.</p>
<p>People think he&rsquo;s law enforcement.</p>
<p>First week it goes like that.</p>
<p>After a while, I&rsquo;m like, okay, I gotta do something.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m scared, man,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, he may be law enforcement.</p>
<p>So I get him on ICQ and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>hey, you have to be reviewed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, what the hell is that?</p>
<p>So I tell him what it is, he&rsquo;s like, you reviewed me.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, that&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>So give him a drop address, give him a burner phone number,</p>
<p>wait five business days,</p>
<p>and I try to hit Dell for $5,000.</p>
<p>The order fails.</p>
<p>I get back on ICQ, hey man, it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, give me one more chance.</p>
<p>I was like, look, I&rsquo;ll give you one more chance,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s your ass after that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, one more chance.</p>
<p>I go, okay, give him another address, another phone number,</p>
<p>wait another five business days,</p>
<p>hit Thompson&rsquo;s Computer Warehouse for $4,000,</p>
<p>Dell for $5,000.</p>
<p>Order goes through, get the products in.</p>
<p>I post that review on Counterfeit Library,</p>
<p>and literally overnight,</p>
<p>we turn from an eBay PayPal fraud site</p>
<p>to a credit theft site.</p>
<p>And that becomes a lot of money really quickly for members.</p>
<p>So we were doing, now it&rsquo;s called CMP fraud,</p>
<p>card not present fraud.</p>
<p>So you hit an online merchant</p>
<p>with stolen credit card data.</p>
<p>Back then, a fairly experienced fraudster</p>
<p>could profit 30 to $40,000 a month, okay?</p>
<p>Just buying laptops, what have you,</p>
<p>and cashing out, put them on eBay for sale</p>
<p>and sell them like that.</p>
<p>And 30 to 40K a month was the profit on that.</p>
<p>Script had a lot of buddies.</p>
<p>He had people like Roman Vega,</p>
<p>these other guys that would sell</p>
<p>not just credit card data,</p>
<p>but counterfeit physical credit cards as well.</p>
<p>We had, and he.</p>
<p>Counterfeit, not stolen.</p>
<p>So counterfeit.</p>
<p>Counterfeit.</p>
<p>That must be tough to do.</p>
<p>So the connection.</p>
<p>That must be harder than driver&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So what BOA initially had,</p>
<p>and I became the United States salesperson for BOA,</p>
<p>but what he had was,</p>
<p>is he was the first dumps provider in the United States.</p>
<p>So on the back of your credit or debit card,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a magnetic stripe.</p>
<p>Three data tracks on the stripe.</p>
<p>There was the first data track is the customer&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Second data track is the card number,</p>
<p>forward slash 16 digit algorithm outside of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get back to that in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Third data track is called indiscriminate data.</p>
<p>No one uses it, all right?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s bought and sold is the second data track.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the dump.</p>
<p>And the reason that&rsquo;s sold is when you go into a shop,</p>
<p>you insert the card or you swipe the card,</p>
<p>the only information that&rsquo;s sent out for verification</p>
<p>is the second data track, all right?</p>
<p>That goes to the processor bank for verification.</p>
<p>The first data track, that customer&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p>shows up on the screen of the cashier in front of you.</p>
<p>So what typically happens is,</p>
<p>is you buy 10 of these dumps.</p>
<p>You get 10 counterfeit cards</p>
<p>in code track two on all 10 cards.</p>
<p>Track one, you create one fake driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>Track one is just the name</p>
<p>of that one fake driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>That way, when you go in the shop, swipe the card,</p>
<p>track two gets sent off for verification.</p>
<p>Track one shows up on the screen in front of the cashier.</p>
<p>If you ever ask for ID, you pull out the fake ID.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s a nice, warm, fuzzy.</p>
<p>You walk out with the cameras, Rolex.</p>
<p>And track one could be, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be connected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not connected to track two.</p>
<p>Not connected at all, all right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the big problems, all right?</p>
<p>So Scrip brought a host of technical people</p>
<p>into that type of environment,</p>
<p>all committing credit card theft.</p>
<p>We had proxy providers.</p>
<p>We had all these people that were doing this stuff.</p>
<p>We start making a lot of money, a lot.</p>
<p>And the reason that happens is, again,</p>
<p>Scrip did not have the ability to cash out.</p>
<p>So he was reduced to selling things.</p>
<p>And at the same time, he&rsquo;s looking for,</p>
<p>how do I make more money, all right?</p>
<p>The Ukrainians happened upon this thing</p>
<p>called the CVV1 breach, or hack,</p>
<p>is what they called it.</p>
<p>So what happens is, remember I told you track two,</p>
<p>card number forward slash 16 digit algorithm.</p>
<p>You gotta know the algorithm to encode it</p>
<p>so you can swipe the card or take it to the ATM machine.</p>
<p>All right, ATM.</p>
<p>You gotta know it.</p>
<p>Now we were fishing data from hell.</p>
<p>I mean, we were doing a lot of fishing, a lot.</p>
<p>We were getting pins, we were getting card numbers,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t get that algorithm.</p>
<p>So Ukrainians start testing stuff.</p>
<p>What they found out was no bank</p>
<p>had implemented the hash on track two.</p>
<p>So you take the card number forward slash any 16 digits,</p>
<p>it would encode.</p>
<p>Take it to the ATM, pull cash out,</p>
<p>because you got the pin, all right?</p>
<p>Started doing that.</p>
<p>Well, wait, sorry, I&rsquo;m trying to understand.</p>
<p>So that means, so if there&rsquo;s no hash,</p>
<p>are they generating random numbers</p>
<p>or do they have valid numbers for track two?</p>
<p>No numbers needed at all,</p>
<p>as long as just the track two was a complete track two.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a valid track two that doesn&rsquo;t match,</p>
<p>so the pin is the thing that gets you in?</p>
<p>So back then, all right, back then,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re talking about is you needed,</p>
<p>typically today you need a whole track two.</p>
<p>You need that valid track two.</p>
<p>All right, you need the 16 digit card number,</p>
<p>forward slash, and then whatever that algorithm</p>
<p>does, the other side of it, all right?</p>
<p>Back then, none of the banks had implemented that algorithm.</p>
<p>So while the algorithm was there,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t need it to encode.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So you can make a lot of money with physical of fake.</p>
<p>So much money that card not present fraud.</p>
<p>Card not present fraud, remember I told you,</p>
<p>was $30,000 to $40,000 a month, all right?</p>
<p>That turned into $30,000 to $40,000 a day.</p>
<p>The Ukrainians, again, they can&rsquo;t cash it out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got all the data on the planet,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t cash it out,</p>
<p>those three necessities of cybercrime.</p>
<p>So the deal became, you have to rely on the Americans.</p>
<p>Tell you what, we&rsquo;ll give you 40%.</p>
<p>So you had all these cashiers</p>
<p>that were 40% of $40,000 a day.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll take that, all right?</p>
<p>Send the rest of it over to buy Western Union</p>
<p>or what have you to your Ukrainian contact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s before cryptocurrency came into play.</p>
<p>Now you had a couple of forerunners</p>
<p>with eGold and Liberty Reserve, things like that.</p>
<p>But back then it starts out with Western Union,</p>
<p>then it becomes prepaid cards,</p>
<p>sending track information over,</p>
<p>loading the card up like that,</p>
<p>and then finally you get to eGold, Liberty Reserve,</p>
<p>and then today it&rsquo;s with crypto that&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p>Started stealing a lot of money, a lot.</p>
<p>And that got law enforcement attention.</p>
<p>So we started to see, I mean, it&rsquo;s a crazy ass story.</p>
<p>We started to see IPs coming in</p>
<p>from law enforcement agencies, government agencies,</p>
<p>because back then they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to shield their identity either.</p>
<p>So you saw Secret Service, you saw DoD,</p>
<p>you saw all these like, and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So, you know, and at the same time,</p>
<p>it was called a hack, but it wasn&rsquo;t a hack.</p>
<p>We had a guy that worked at T Mobile in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>This is the same guy that back then</p>
<p>published Paris Hilton&rsquo;s phone contact list.</p>
<p>That made a lot of news.</p>
<p>Not only did he do that, but it turned out</p>
<p>that the Los Angeles Secret Service Agency</p>
<p>was using T Mobile phones.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s getting text messages of the Secret Service</p>
<p>investigating Shadow Crew,</p>
<p>and he posts those damn things on Shadow Crew.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sitting there going, head of the pile,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting there going, this is not gonna end well.</p>
<p>This is not gonna end well.</p>
<p>So at the same time, I had access,</p>
<p>I started out with access</p>
<p>to the Indiana State Sex Offenders Registry,</p>
<p>and I was using that to create bank accounts,</p>
<p>launder the money out, and I would sell the bank accounts,</p>
<p>stuff like that.</p>
<p>They shut that down.</p>
<p>The next database I had access to</p>
<p>was the Texas Driver&rsquo;s License database,</p>
<p>and started using that to create fake driver&rsquo;s licenses,</p>
<p>what have you.</p>
<p>And then finally, we happened upon</p>
<p>the California Death Index, all right?</p>
<p>Complete information, mother&rsquo;s maiden,</p>
<p>socials, DOBs, all that, and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>gotta be a use for that.</p>
<p>Well, you can use it to create identities all day long.</p>
<p>My idea was, I wonder if you could take somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s died and then file for social security death benefit,</p>
<p>not death benefits, but social security benefits</p>
<p>for that individual, and get that recurring paycheck in.</p>
<p>So that takes a lot of research</p>
<p>to start seeing if you can do that.</p>
<p>How does the federal government know if you&rsquo;re dead?</p>
<p>Do federal indexes reference state indexes?</p>
<p>You got all these questions that pop up.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out, federal indexes</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t reference state indexes, it&rsquo;s against the law.</p>
<p>It also turns out, the only way the federal government</p>
<p>knows you&rsquo;re dead is prior to 1998,</p>
<p>the family had to file a social security death benefit</p>
<p>for that person, all right?</p>
<p>Prior to 98.</p>
<p>Which of course most people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right, prior to 98, it took the family.</p>
<p>After 98, the hospital can do it,</p>
<p>funeral home can do it, or the family can do it.</p>
<p>So a lot more people have it filed after,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;ve died after.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still, there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who probably don&rsquo;t. A lot of people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Because that death benefit&rsquo;s only like $219, okay?</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s thinking about that shit.</p>
<p>So I started to apply for social security benefits.</p>
<p>Nope, number&rsquo;s dormant.</p>
<p>So they want you to come in for a physical interview.</p>
<p>Here I am, you know, 32.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna pass as a 65 year old, so no.</p>
<p>So the next idea I had was,</p>
<p>I wonder if you could file income tax returns</p>
<p>on these people.</p>
<p>Turns out you can, all day long.</p>
<p>So I started doing that.</p>
<p>And I started to steal, once I got ramped up,</p>
<p>because you test everything.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re testing to make sure,</p>
<p>you gotta figure out what the deposit instrument is</p>
<p>and everything else.</p>
<p>And once you get all that lined out,</p>
<p>I started to steal $160,000 a week,</p>
<p>every week for 10 months out of the year.</p>
<p>By paying taxes?</p>
<p>By filing fake returns.</p>
<p>Yeah, filing fake tax returns.</p>
<p>So you find a business, and the way the system worked</p>
<p>is the IRS will issue a refund on somebody</p>
<p>before they&rsquo;re able to verify</p>
<p>that that person worked for an employer.</p>
<p>Still works like that today.</p>
<p>All right, so.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re keeping the amounts relatively low.</p>
<p>Keep them at $3,000.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Amounts are very low.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re still able to achieve scale</p>
<p>because this large index of real people.</p>
<p>I got to where, and I was manual.</p>
<p>Later on, a couple buddies of mine</p>
<p>went automated with it.</p>
<p>Wait, you were doing this by hand?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no code involved?</p>
<p>All manual.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d file a return once every six minutes.</p>
<p>Work 10 hours a day, three days a week.</p>
<p>So clicking on, so typing fast and clicking.</p>
<p>One return every six minutes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s changing IP.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s changing address.</p>
<p>Everything else, one return every six minutes.</p>
<p>For three days a week.</p>
<p>Fourth day, I would take a road trip,</p>
<p>plot out a map of ATMs.</p>
<p>And then the next two days, cash out.</p>
<p>Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Come back home, rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>Turns out that a backpack,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see anybody sitting around here,</p>
<p>but a backpack will hold $150,000 of 20s,</p>
<p>is what it will hold.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d put 150K and 20s in a backpack.</p>
<p>I had a spare bedroom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d come in, toss the backpack in the bedroom.</p>
<p>This is very, very important information.</p>
<p>And the fact that you know it is also very,</p>
<p>first we started with the volume of coal that weighs a ton,</p>
<p>and now a backpack holds $150,000 of 20s.</p>
<p>And then you can multiply that by five 400s.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also times 20s coming out of ATM, right?</p>
<p>Each 20 weighs a gram.</p>
<p>So you can actually go by weight,</p>
<p>which is what federal authorities do</p>
<p>when they get a pallet of cash, they just weigh it.</p>
<p>Oh, they just, they just weigh it.</p>
<p>So 150K is seven and a half keys of cash.</p>
<p>One and a half, 15, oh, that&rsquo;s pretty light.</p>
<p>Not bad, not bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, you get a big backpack,</p>
<p>go do a good run with David Goggins with it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>The fact that you know this is great.</p>
<p>So wait, where does that come in with the backpack?</p>
<p>So what happens is I didn&rsquo;t know how to launder money.</p>
<p>All right, so I&rsquo;m throwing cash in the spare bedroom.</p>
<p>One day you open up the bedroom and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>gotta do something with those backpacks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you start learning how to launder money,</p>
<p>cash based businesses, things like that.</p>
<p>I had a production company,</p>
<p>had a couple of detailing company.</p>
<p>I was thinking about going into food trucks,</p>
<p>things like that in Charleston.</p>
<p>Actually, can you pause on that to take a tangent there?</p>
<p>How does money laundering work?</p>
<p>I mean, at that time and what years are we talking about?</p>
<p>This is, by the time the tax return schemes go into play,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking 2002, 2003 is when tax returns start.</p>
<p>And so what, at that time and what you&rsquo;re aware of now,</p>
<p>how it evolved, how does money laundering work?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not that much different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not.</p>
<p>You get a cash based business,</p>
<p>start laundering the money or putting the money through that,</p>
<p>saying the transactions are legal.</p>
<p>You then start depositing into bank accounts.</p>
<p>From bank accounts, my thing was is</p>
<p>have bank accounts in the United States, Mexico, Canada,</p>
<p>and then finally bounce over to Estonia</p>
<p>was the final destination of all this stuff.</p>
<p>And the idea is to try to move them to so many places</p>
<p>that by the end of the day, it looks legal</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t trace it all if you&rsquo;re ever caught,</p>
<p>which you ultimately are.</p>
<p>But so cash based businesses, you know.</p>
<p>So when you say, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>the cash based businesses,</p>
<p>so you have money that needs to be moved to other people.</p>
<p>So how does that work?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the business?</p>
<p>Are people providing you a service</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re giving them money?</p>
<p>Right, so you do the Ozark thing if you wanna do that.</p>
<p>So you can gamble, cash out something like that.</p>
<p>So it trips to whatever casinos you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got your production company or your detail company.</p>
<p>So how many cars are you cleaning a day?</p>
<p>How many companies have you got to do that?</p>
<p>All right, whatever that company is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be cash based.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s paying you in cash is what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You have to have enough of those cash based businesses</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t look funny.</p>
<p>All right, because if you&rsquo;re a detail company</p>
<p>making $100,000 a month, that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Okay, so then you start depositing into that.</p>
<p>Well, because of the Patriot Act,</p>
<p>a suspicious activity report, SARS, came in at $2,500</p>
<p>instead of the 10K that it used to be.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve got multiple bank accounts</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got to set up, all right?</p>
<p>Fortunately, what you also had</p>
<p>is you had a bunch of prepaid debit cards</p>
<p>that were coming into play at the same time.</p>
<p>So a combination of bank accounts, prepaid debits</p>
<p>that had ACH abilities attached to those as well,</p>
<p>and you start running them all together.</p>
<p>Then once it&rsquo;s out of the United States,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to worry as much.</p>
<p>You can start funneling that into fewer bank accounts</p>
<p>until finally you&rsquo;ve got the one main account</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s over at Bank Letico in Estonia at that point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>So a bunch of hops that end up at a place</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t trace.</p>
<p>And to give you an idea, I was arrested February 8th, 2005.</p>
<p>My last seizure was 2010.</p>
<p>Got the last seizure notice.</p>
<p>So they got it, but it didn&rsquo;t took them that long</p>
<p>to get to it.</p>
<p>So how do stories like with Script that come into play here</p>
<p>where he had someone who owed him money</p>
<p>kidnapped and tortured.</p>
<p>So when does it turn darker?</p>
<p>It turns darker the more money you make.</p>
<p>Script was a kid that he was stealing enough money</p>
<p>that he was able to buy whatever estate he wanted to.</p>
<p>And he would brag about touring the countryside.</p>
<p>And if he saw property that he liked, he would buy it.</p>
<p>And that was not just a brag, he was doing that.</p>
<p>So this kid is stealing a lot of money.</p>
<p>At the same time, he&rsquo;s got connections politically</p>
<p>because of his family, he&rsquo;s got connections</p>
<p>and that family&rsquo;s got connections with a Ukrainian mob.</p>
<p>All right, so he&rsquo;s got these inroads</p>
<p>and people are looking out for him</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s stealing a lot of money at the same time.</p>
<p>Somebody doesn&rsquo;t pay him a decent amount of money.</p>
<p>Somebody doesn&rsquo;t pay him.</p>
<p>Now we had never, with Shadow Crew, with Carter Planet,</p>
<p>with Counterfeit Library, we were basically the geeks.</p>
<p>All right, we were just the fraudsters,</p>
<p>the social engineers.</p>
<p>We had never really considered violence.</p>
<p>The rules that I had in play were,</p>
<p>hey, we don&rsquo;t do child pornography,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t do counterfeit currency, we don&rsquo;t do drugs.</p>
<p>And the only thing we ended up really obeying</p>
<p>was the child porn stuff, except for Max Butler,</p>
<p>who you mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Script, someone rips the guy off.</p>
<p>And he comes online on Shadow Crew at that point</p>
<p>and he posts these pictures one day.</p>
<p>And I mean, it was a detailed narrative through the pictures.</p>
<p>Had the guy that rammed in the van,</p>
<p>he had the door open, rammed in the van,</p>
<p>had the guy tied up, had the guy being tortured.</p>
<p>And the response was, this is what happens</p>
<p>when you steal from me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the first time that violence came into play</p>
<p>at that point, and that&rsquo;s when things got,</p>
<p>you start realizing things are getting a little serious.</p>
<p>How did that make you feel?</p>
<p>The first response is, can&rsquo;t be real.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just doing that.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s wanting to send a message.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re like, no, that&rsquo;s real, that&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>Were you afraid in your own heart</p>
<p>that you might descend to that too?</p>
<p>Like if you see that, or was it pretty clear to you</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a line that some people can cross</p>
<p>and some can&rsquo;t and you&rsquo;re not one of those that can cross it?</p>
<p>You know, I gotta tell you, I joke with my wife.</p>
<p>The joke I tell my wife is, you know,</p>
<p>I knew some guy that had 8,000 Bitcoins.</p>
<p>I might be persuaded to ask him for access to that.</p>
<p>And she was like, how?</p>
<p>And I was like, well, hammer and toes.</p>
<p>And I say that as a joke,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s that line where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I remember who I used to be.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking at that kind of money,</p>
<p>I might be persuaded to do that back then.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s, and I think that was Scripps issue</p>
<p>is it was a lot of money to him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the money.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, you know, violence can also be gradual.</p>
<p>So over time you do a little more, a little more,</p>
<p>a little more, a little more.</p>
<p>You get used to what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and then I get desensitized.</p>
<p>And you figure, you take somebody like Ross Ulbricht,</p>
<p>the Silk Road guy, all right.</p>
<p>Ross was not a violent guy.</p>
<p>He was not.</p>
<p>But at that point in time, you know,</p>
<p>he was sitting on 24 million in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>He was the only game in town.</p>
<p>And that 24 now is like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>22, 24 billion, some crap like that.</p>
<p>But he felt in danger.</p>
<p>This guy was gonna turn him in.</p>
<p>You know, it was a black mountain and everything.</p>
<p>So Ross thinks he hires a couple hit men to kill the guy.</p>
<p>So it becomes that thing.</p>
<p>And I saw that over and over again.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to say I wasn&rsquo;t like that,</p>
<p>but given the same circumstances,</p>
<p>I would have probably done the same thing.</p>
<p>And also when you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s not just about money,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of other forces.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re threatened for your wellbeing</p>
<p>or for your wealth or for your power,</p>
<p>all of us operate under different motivations.</p>
<p>Plus that online aspect with those communities like that,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the head guy,</p>
<p>you really feel like you&rsquo;re the parent of these guys.</p>
<p>So somebody is starting to threaten them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, all right, what do I need to do?</p>
<p>So what do you make of Silk Road?</p>
<p>The Shadow Crew started something that today</p>
<p>you can call dark net and dark net markets.</p>
<p>So these markets that operate, that trade,</p>
<p>trade things, everything from child pornography to drugs,</p>
<p>to, I mean, what else?</p>
<p>Everywhere.</p>
<p>What are the dark things that humans want to do</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t want anyone to know about?</p>
<p>All of those things.</p>
<p>So can you maybe tell me, you know what?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just even step back.</p>
<p>What is the dark net?</p>
<p>How big is it?</p>
<p>What happens there?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s backtrack a little bit more before we get to that.</p>
<p>All right, what Shadow Crew did,</p>
<p>other than dealing in all these stolen wares,</p>
<p>what Shadow Crew did that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>Remember those three necessities that I talked about?</p>
<p>But the important thing is,</p>
<p>is it established trust among criminals, all right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s a necessity.</p>
<p>You have to be able to trust who you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>because you have to deal with somebody.</p>
<p>You have to, all right?</p>
<p>So how do you know you&rsquo;re not dealing with a cop?</p>
<p>How do you know you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with somebody that&rsquo;s skilled?</p>
<p>How do you know you&rsquo;re going to deal with somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to rip you off?</p>
<p>You have to be able to trust that individual.</p>
<p>The Shadow Crew provided</p>
<p>that trust mechanism for criminals.</p>
<p>You had that communication channel, the forums,</p>
<p>where you could reference conversations weeks, months old,</p>
<p>take part and learn from those conversations.</p>
<p>You had vouching systems and review systems in place,</p>
<p>escrow systems in place.</p>
<p>You knew by looking at someone&rsquo;s screen name,</p>
<p>if you could trust the individual,</p>
<p>network with the individual, all right?</p>
<p>And that community of just humans</p>
<p>provided that backbone of trust.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really interesting when you think about it.</p>
<p>You had the trust that was there,</p>
<p>but you also had this,</p>
<p>almost this instantaneous information</p>
<p>that was available about the community</p>
<p>or about cyber crime at large.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s still in play today, all right?</p>
<p>So that was the way things were</p>
<p>until a couple of things happened.</p>
<p>And one was cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The other one was the Tor browser, the dark web.</p>
<p>Now I was working with a secret service,</p>
<p>ripping the secret service off,</p>
<p>when Tor comes into play, all right?</p>
<p>So we got a memo in one day</p>
<p>and it was talking about the Tor browser.</p>
<p>And it was like, we really need to be careful with this.</p>
<p>This is going to be problem.</p>
<p>And so we all fired up the Tor browser</p>
<p>and it turns out it was, this was 2005, early six.</p>
<p>It turns out it was completely unusable,</p>
<p>could not use it at all,</p>
<p>simply because no one was using it</p>
<p>and it was extremely slow.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Tor browser is a way to be completely anonymous.</p>
<p>As long as you properly know how to use it, huge caveat.</p>
<p>All right, so developed by the United States Navy</p>
<p>and they developed it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the hackers that, interesting.</p>
<p>US Navy, to this day, the number one funder of Tor,</p>
<p>military, to this day, all right?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, the same, I guess with the internet,</p>
<p>the origins are the dark web and DOD.</p>
<p>It was developed so that operatives could communicate</p>
<p>with each other without being identified, all right?</p>
<p>That then goes open source.</p>
<p>They release it, EFF comes in,</p>
<p>start sponsoring and everything else like that.</p>
<p>The next idea was, well, you know,</p>
<p>people can get around their country&rsquo;s firewalls,</p>
<p>whistleblowers can use it, things like that.</p>
<p>Well, someone forgot to mention</p>
<p>that the first adoptees of tech,</p>
<p>if you can use it to launder money or remain anonymous,</p>
<p>are criminals.</p>
<p>And so criminals start to use the damn thing.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>So along the same time we get,</p>
<p>well, a few years later,</p>
<p>we get Satoshi Nakamoto pops up</p>
<p>with his ideas for Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and then Ross Ulbrich runs with it.</p>
<p>Ross Ulbrich decides he&rsquo;s gonna start up Silk Road.</p>
<p>So initially the people who were using Tor,</p>
<p>which later is the dark web,</p>
<p>people were using Tor or just talking with each other,</p>
<p>visiting websites, communicating like that.</p>
<p>Someone figured out,</p>
<p>hey man, we could host websites on this thing,</p>
<p>and they have a lot of trouble finding the box.</p>
<p>So that is the advent of Silk Road all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Ross Ulbrich has this idea</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s gonna change the world</p>
<p>by becoming the largest drug dealer on the planet.</p>
<p>So he opens up the Silk Road</p>
<p>and the only payment instrument he allows is Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So if those people out there are wondering</p>
<p>why Bitcoin is going at what, 44K today?</p>
<p>Yeah, and by the time this is out,</p>
<p>it could be 100,000 or 10,000.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s 10,000, I&rsquo;m going to buy some.</p>
<p>Which is a hilarious statement to make</p>
<p>because that statement would be ridiculously wrong</p>
<p>like five years ago, right?</p>
<p>I know, I know, I know.</p>
<p>People 100 years from now will be laughing,</p>
<p>wait, it was that low back then?</p>
<p>So he only accepts Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and of course the initial use case of crypto</p>
<p>is no one wants to admit it today,</p>
<p>but the initial use case is we&rsquo;re gonna buy a bunch of pot.</p>
<p>We need somebody, we need a way to pay for it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>Ross, it&rsquo;s really interesting to me.</p>
<p>If you look at motivations of cyber criminals,</p>
<p>the motivations are status, cash, ideology, all right?</p>
<p>My guys, all cash, across the board, all cash.</p>
<p>Ross is ideology.</p>
<p>He really believed he was gonna change the world.</p>
<p>He really didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate.</p>
<p>I actually know the guy who ran Silk Road 2</p>
<p>and have talked to the kid, everything else,</p>
<p>and I will tell you that those guys</p>
<p>who are motivated by ideology,</p>
<p>they are a completely different breed.</p>
<p>They really are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you know, the cash guy, it&rsquo;s low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>The ease of, it&rsquo;s hard to stop committing crime,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much easier for a cash motivated individual</p>
<p>to stop than it is that ideology guy.</p>
<p>That Silk Road 2 guy, he&rsquo;s still got it.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s not breaking the law,</p>
<p>but you can see it&rsquo;s like, he wants to, he wants to.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating that, I mean,</p>
<p>the worst atrocities in human history</p>
<p>are committed with people that operate under ideology.</p>
<p>All the other motivations are much weaker.</p>
<p>But you know, you think about it,</p>
<p>with Ross, I mean, very bright guy, very bright guy,</p>
<p>but think about the amount of cognitive dissonance</p>
<p>that the guy&rsquo;s got,</p>
<p>that he thinks he&rsquo;s gonna change the world</p>
<p>by running a drug site.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly, I mean, could he have changed the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, could he have done it like that?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Well, I can steel man those arguments.</p>
<p>I listened to quite a few libertarians</p>
<p>and you can push that to anarchists.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that argue&hellip;</p>
<p>So I actually talked to a professor at Columbia</p>
<p>who actually argues that all drugs should be legalized</p>
<p>and not at a philosophical level, political level,</p>
<p>but the fact that all the negative consequences of drugs</p>
<p>that people talk about actually have to do</p>
<p>with other factors in your life.</p>
<p>I would agree with that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, okay, but that&rsquo;s more like a argument</p>
<p>about negative aspects of drugs.</p>
<p>I think the ideology comes in where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, nobody should tell you what to do.</p>
<p>You should have the responsibility of your own actions.</p>
<p>Like the government or any other institution</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be the rule setters,</p>
<p>the constraints for how you live your life.</p>
<p>And so I could see that argument being made</p>
<p>and ultimately if you like create an open market for drugs,</p>
<p>how that could build a better society,</p>
<p>it might break down the outdated, the corrupt,</p>
<p>the bureaucratic institutions.</p>
<p>I mean, you can make that argument.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an argument and let&rsquo;s be fair.</p>
<p>I wanna be fair with it.</p>
<p>I mean, did he change the world?</p>
<p>We do have this whole thing called cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Yeah, in the long arc of history, perhaps.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do have that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a biggie.</p>
<p>And that might&rsquo;ve been for it to take hold in society.</p>
<p>Maybe the darker parts of society at first,</p>
<p>maybe that was necessary.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, maybe, we&rsquo;ll see how it pans out.</p>
<p>Shadow Crew, we had this guy, Albert Gonzalez,</p>
<p>Albert Gonzalez, that&rsquo;s the kid&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>We had, we were growing so big</p>
<p>that I had to start farming things out.</p>
<p>So the first thing I started farming,</p>
<p>I instituted this review system,</p>
<p>kind of establishing that trust mechanism</p>
<p>even further for criminals to use.</p>
<p>We needed somebody to take care of our tech aspects</p>
<p>of the forum.</p>
<p>So an associate of mine by the name of Kim Taylor,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re looking for a forum techie,</p>
<p>he comes to me one night and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>found our forum techie.</p>
<p>I was like, who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s this kid.</p>
<p>And I was like, is he any good?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, well, he knows the software.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, we&rsquo;ll just sign his ass on.</p>
<p>He went by the screen name of Kumbajonny,</p>
<p>was his screen name.</p>
<p>And he starts selling credit cards after a while</p>
<p>under a screen name of Scarface.</p>
<p>And that CB1 breach where you&rsquo;re cashing out</p>
<p>the track twos at ATMs, $40,000 a day.</p>
<p>So Albert&rsquo;s in New Jersey one day, broad daylight,</p>
<p>and stands at an ATM for 40 minutes, just standing there,</p>
<p>feeding in one ATM card after another, pulling out cash,</p>
<p>taking the 20s out, stuffing them in that backpack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just across the street,</p>
<p>a couple of cops just happened to be there.</p>
<p>And they start noticing this kid just standing there.</p>
<p>So 40 minutes, they watch this kid, 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Finally, one cop looks at the other,</p>
<p>let me see what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>
<p>Walks over across the street, Albert&rsquo;s wearing a wig.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got the disguise on, everything else like that.</p>
<p>Ask him, kid, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Albert falls apart.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know Albert had been arrested.</p>
<p>So Albert immediately goes in,</p>
<p>I wanna work for the Secret Service.</p>
<p>At that point in time, Secret Service,</p>
<p>I referred to, and I wanna make sure I don&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like that anymore.</p>
<p>But back then, they were fucking idiots, all right?</p>
<p>They had no clue what was going on.</p>
<p>So there was a competence issue</p>
<p>that they were working through is one way to put it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice euphemism.</p>
<p>So, or fucking idiots is another way to say it.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just not aware of the digital world.</p>
<p>They had no clue, no clue.</p>
<p>The way that Albert tells them how to catch us</p>
<p>because they looked at him, how do we catch them?</p>
<p>And Albert&rsquo;s like, Albert, I&rsquo;m serious, I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>So Albert&rsquo;s like, well, you could try a VPN.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a VPN?</p>
<p>So he explains it to them, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>So I quit Shadow Crew.</p>
<p>I was worried about all the news</p>
<p>that was coming in and everything like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stealing 160K a week.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know Albert had been arrested.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about being arrested.</p>
<p>I know the writing&rsquo;s on the wall.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m quitting.</p>
<p>Where did you see the writing?</p>
<p>The IPs that were coming in,</p>
<p>the text messages about the Secret Service investigators</p>
<p>I referred to.</p>
<p>So the pressure&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>This is not gonna end well.</p>
<p>This is going to be bad.</p>
<p>So I announced my retirement of February 15th,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, April 15th, 2004 is my retirement.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the 2004.</p>
<p>And I quit, I walk away.</p>
<p>Well, Albert had been arrested.</p>
<p>They cut him loose.</p>
<p>No one knows he&rsquo;s been arrested.</p>
<p>He comes back into Shadow Crew.</p>
<p>I leave Kim Taylor at the same time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kind of on the run, which if you wanna know that story,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a nightmare story in and of itself.</p>
<p>So my second in charge, Kim Taylor, this guy,</p>
<p>there was this guy named David, oh, what was his name?</p>
<p>He was, El Mariachi was the guy&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>David Thomas.</p>
<p>David, yeah, he was a film guy.</p>
<p>Scarface.</p>
<p>So El Mariachi, real name David Thomas,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s on the run out of Nebraska for check fraud.</p>
<p>He comes to us on Shadow Crew telling us this sad story.</p>
<p>We take up a collection for this guy.</p>
<p>Send it to him, all right?</p>
<p>I get him a job working with a low level carter</p>
<p>trying to make him some money, all right?</p>
<p>El Mariachi, Thomas does this for a few weeks,</p>
<p>comes to me one day and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>man, I&rsquo;m not making any money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, let me see what I can do.</p>
<p>Well, I had a Ukrainian guy by the name of Big Buyer.</p>
<p>He, a real friend of mine.</p>
<p>And I contacted him, I was like, look, man,</p>
<p>I got a guy that wants to do some work.</p>
<p>Can you help the guy out?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I got it.</p>
<p>I was like, okay.</p>
<p>So he sends Thomas enough money to go,</p>
<p>Thomas is in Texas at that point,</p>
<p>sends Thomas enough money to go from Texas</p>
<p>to Issaquah, Washington and rent an office space, all right?</p>
<p>So Thomas goes up there, rents his office space,</p>
<p>him and his girlfriend rents an office space.</p>
<p>And the plan is, is Big Buyer is going to place an order,</p>
<p>get product sent, Mariachi is going to get the product,</p>
<p>list it on eBay, cash out 50 50, easy enough, all right?</p>
<p>So Big Buyer places an order.</p>
<p>First order is outpost.com, $18,000.</p>
<p>The largest order outpost.com had ever received</p>
<p>at that point in time.</p>
<p>Order goes through.</p>
<p>It goes through still.</p>
<p>Goes through, he gets the product, all right?</p>
<p>Mariachi comes back, tells me,</p>
<p>tells my second in charge, Kim Taylor.</p>
<p>Kim Taylor at this point, I&rsquo;m 33, 34.</p>
<p>Kim Taylor&rsquo;s 46.</p>
<p>He works at the Tattered Cover Bookstore</p>
<p>in Denver, Colorado is where he works at this point.</p>
<p>And he fancies himself Jason Bourne, all right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s even got one of the screen names of Jason Bourne.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, all right, so Mariachi is telling us</p>
<p>how much money he&rsquo;s making, everything else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re all right.</p>
<p>Kim contacts me and he&rsquo;s like, I want to go to Issaquah.</p>
<p>And I was like, why?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, to make some money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re making money.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I want to go to Issaquah.</p>
<p>I was like, all right, go, be careful.</p>
<p>So he gets in the car, Saturn is what he&rsquo;s driving.</p>
<p>He drives his little piece of Saturn</p>
<p>all the way up to Issaquah.</p>
<p>Gets there, you know, midnight.</p>
<p>They party all night long</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve never met each other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just celebrating, partying, drinking,</p>
<p>everything else like that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Big Buyer has placed another order</p>
<p>with Outpost.com, $17,000.</p>
<p>The second largest order Outpost.com had ever received</p>
<p>at that point in time.</p>
<p>By this point in time, Outpost knows</p>
<p>the first order was fraudulent.</p>
<p>Guess where it&rsquo;s going?</p>
<p>The exact same address the first order goes.</p>
<p>So Outpost picks up the phone, calls Issaquah PD.</p>
<p>Hey, we got a fraudster.</p>
<p>Issaquah&rsquo;s like, would you mind sending some empty boxes?</p>
<p>And Outpost is like, be happy to.</p>
<p>So the rule was, is on credit card fraud,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got full account access,</p>
<p>you place the order.</p>
<p>The morning it&rsquo;s supposed to arrive,</p>
<p>you sign into the bank account or the credit card account.</p>
<p>If you can sign in, you go pick up your product.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t sign in, you go back to sleep that day.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>Well, Big Buyer was the guy who placed the order.</p>
<p>Mariachi and my second in charge are partying, all right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re supposed to contact Big Buyer, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Big Buyer is raising hell,</p>
<p>getting up with me like, hey, where are the guys?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t find them.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to pick up this product.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t get in touch with them.</p>
<p>They go down to pick up the,</p>
<p>so Mariachi&rsquo;s got a Cadillac, old 70s Cadillac.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a Cadillac, pulls into the complex.</p>
<p>Now Mariachi&rsquo;s driving,</p>
<p>Kim Taylor&rsquo;s in the passenger seat,</p>
<p>David Thomas&rsquo;s girlfriend&rsquo;s in the back seat.</p>
<p>As they pull into the complex,</p>
<p>going through the parking lot,</p>
<p>Mariachi just happens to glance over and he sees a van</p>
<p>with a guy sitting sideways in the van.</p>
<p>And he looks at Kim Taylor and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an undercover.</p>
<p>And Kim&rsquo;s like, ah, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>So they pull up to the office complex.</p>
<p>Kim&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ll go in and get the packages.</p>
<p>So he walks in, looks at the guy behind the counter.</p>
<p>I believe you have some packages for us.</p>
<p>Guy&rsquo;s like, one second.</p>
<p>So he disappears around the wall,</p>
<p>out pops the Issaquah PD, arrests Kim.</p>
<p>David Thomas is in the car watching all this happen.</p>
<p>He bugs out and they arrest him on the interstate</p>
<p>where he has three fake driver&rsquo;s licenses in his wallet</p>
<p>along with his real driver&rsquo;s license, another no, no,</p>
<p>but they get him.</p>
<p>So David Thomas had outstanding warrants out of Nebraska.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t bond him out.</p>
<p>Kim Taylor didn&rsquo;t have any warrants.</p>
<p>So we bonded him out.</p>
<p>My third in charge, kid, Seth Sanders was his name.</p>
<p>He bonds him out, uses his girlfriend&rsquo;s account</p>
<p>to bond him out.</p>
<p>And I get Kim Taylor to go to Utah</p>
<p>where another friend of mine agrees to house him,</p>
<p>him and his wife.</p>
<p>So I think everything&rsquo;s fine and all that.</p>
<p>About three weeks later, this guy in Utah</p>
<p>gets me on the phone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, hey, he&rsquo;s got to go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, well, the only thing he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>is popping ecstasy tablets every day, all day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, seriously?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, he&rsquo;s got to go.</p>
<p>So we kick him out of there.</p>
<p>By this point, I&rsquo;ve got another crew that&rsquo;s coming through.</p>
<p>I mean, I had all these crews running.</p>
<p>Had another crew that&rsquo;s coming through Denver.</p>
<p>Send Kim back to Denver to partner up with these guys.</p>
<p>Kim gets these guys arrested.</p>
<p>So by this point in time, I&rsquo;m exasperated.</p>
<p>I just want to throw my hands up in the air and walk away.</p>
<p>So my retirement&rsquo;s coming up at the same time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, fuck it, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>So I tell everybody, the rest of the admins</p>
<p>and the mods there, I&rsquo;m like, this is what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>You guys need to watch out for this.</p>
<p>We need to ban Kim, not let him back in.</p>
<p>Be careful what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I walk away.</p>
<p>At the same time I walk away,</p>
<p>Cumberjani, Albert Gonzalez, comes back into play.</p>
<p>He sees everything that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>He uses that to his advantage.</p>
<p>He starts banning everyone that&rsquo;s suspicious of him,</p>
<p>sets up the VPN at the same time and says,</p>
<p>hey, to make sure we&rsquo;re all secure,</p>
<p>I need all transactions to go through this VPN.</p>
<p>VPNs ran by the Secret Service.</p>
<p>All right, Secret Service ends up,</p>
<p>I think they ended up cataloging like $7 million</p>
<p>worth of transactions over the next four or five months.</p>
<p>Shadow Crew makes the front cover of Forbes, August, 2004.</p>
<p>Headline, Who&rsquo;s Stealing Your Identity.</p>
<p>October 26, 2004, United States Secret Service arrest,</p>
<p>33 people, six countries, six hours.</p>
<p>I was in Charleston, South Carolina when I saw it happen.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the one that got away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one public.</p>
<p>There were a couple other guys that got away</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t publicly mention.</p>
<p>One, his name was Tron.</p>
<p>He was a zero.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But he went by the screen name Tron.</p>
<p>He had access, almost unfettered access to Bank of America.</p>
<p>So what happens is they identified the guy,</p>
<p>Secret Service is in the air to go get him.</p>
<p>They call the Ukrainian police.</p>
<p>Hey, we&rsquo;re coming down to arrest this guy.</p>
<p>Ukrainian cops are like, oh, come on down.</p>
<p>So as soon as they got off the phone,</p>
<p>Ukrainian cops get in the car, go down and tell Tron,</p>
<p>hey, they&rsquo;re coming to get you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he bugs out down to South America</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t catch him I think for six or seven years</p>
<p>after that, something like that.</p>
<p>But caught him eventually.</p>
<p>Caught him eventually.</p>
<p>Well, let me actually ask you on this point.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said that if you do cyber crime eventually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna end well.</p>
<p>It does not end well.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t wanna say that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be arrested because honestly,</p>
<p>very few people are arrested, all right?</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t end well because of the type of person</p>
<p>that you become.</p>
<p>You quoted me earlier, you lie to everybody around you.</p>
<p>You lie to yourself, you lie to your friends,</p>
<p>you lie to your family.</p>
<p>Of course, you lie to your victims.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have any friends.</p>
<p>You know, I went 20 years without friends.</p>
<p>I had associates, I didn&rsquo;t have friends.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t truly trust anybody.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t trust anybody.</p>
<p>You know, I had my wife, I was married for nine years.</p>
<p>I lied to her every single day of those nine years.</p>
<p>And it took her nine years to give up on me,</p>
<p>to realize that I was that piece of shit.</p>
<p>And she leaves at that point.</p>
<p>Then from there, I started dating a stripper</p>
<p>and lied to her.</p>
<p>I thought I had friends.</p>
<p>I lied to all those people that I knew</p>
<p>that thought they were my friends.</p>
<p>I lied to them the entire time.</p>
<p>You become that individual.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people really understand</p>
<p>how bad that is.</p>
<p>You know, you talked about, you pointed out that woman</p>
<p>that I ripped off.</p>
<p>She was trying to put a roof on her house</p>
<p>for her freaking kids, man.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re that person.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re also lying to yourself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a mindset in which you can</p>
<p>grow as a person, find happiness,</p>
<p>find genuine, simple human affection,</p>
<p>which is what love is.</p>
<p>Simple, real friendship, all of those things.</p>
<p>So I went to prison, of course.</p>
<p>One of the things, one of the most important lessons</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve learned in prison,</p>
<p>because cyber crime as a whole,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a criminal, it&rsquo;s an addiction, all right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re addicted to something,</p>
<p>whether it be drugs, crime, gambling, what have you,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re addicted to something,</p>
<p>you cannot love anything else except the addiction.</p>
<p>The addiction comes first, all right?</p>
<p>And you pointed out some of those truly despicable things.</p>
<p>Script, for example, tortures that guy.</p>
<p>You get to the point where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, this is the business.</p>
<p>And I tried to convince myself that I&rsquo;m a businessman,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a good guy on the other end.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So those lies become part of it, everything else.</p>
<p>And yeah, the higher ups are usually arrested, they are.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve got millions of cyber criminals these days.</p>
<p>So most guys are not gonna be arrested.</p>
<p>So you may be arrested.</p>
<p>You may be like freaking Jonathan James.</p>
<p>He was a minor, a very, very talented individual,</p>
<p>very competent.</p>
<p>He had, as a kid, he had broke into NASA,</p>
<p>the OD, Pentagon.</p>
<p>He shut the NASA computers down for six weeks.</p>
<p>This is that kid.</p>
<p>Then he decides he wants to go into credit card theft,</p>
<p>partners with Albert, he&rsquo;s arrested with Albert.</p>
<p>Law enforcement, they were gonna blame him.</p>
<p>He was the only competent individual.</p>
<p>So this kid gets up one day, he wasn&rsquo;t in prison yet.</p>
<p>He gets up one day, goes in his dad&rsquo;s bedroom,</p>
<p>gets out his 45, walks in the bathroom,</p>
<p>and blows his brains out.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got things like that.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re gonna rip somebody off,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna end up like scripted with that guy,</p>
<p>the guy who ran Evolution Marketplace.</p>
<p>No one knew who, two people ran that guy and a girl.</p>
<p>And no one knew who they were.</p>
<p>He ends up stealing about $24 million,</p>
<p>a lot of it from Ukrainian mob,</p>
<p>and they found him about a year later</p>
<p>on a beach without his head in hands.</p>
<p>But you know, it always goes south.</p>
<p>But more than anything, to me,</p>
<p>the negative thing is you really become somebody that,</p>
<p>I mean, just truly a despicable human being.</p>
<p>When you get to the point when you&rsquo;re destroying</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s retirement accounts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stealing money from a woman</p>
<p>that simply wants to do something good for her family.</p>
<p>When you become that individual,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re okay with that, my God, man.</p>
<p>It got to the point, I had one guy I ripped off,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like for $900,</p>
<p>is when I first started the cybercrime stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when I was becoming competent.</p>
<p>And I ripped him off for like $900,</p>
<p>and he sent me an email, and he was like,</p>
<p>the email said something like,</p>
<p>I guess you needed the money, and it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You know, you keep it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m getting chills right now thinking about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that, where you become that individual.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can I actually backtrack?</p>
<p>Listen, I love love, okay?</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a story that you fell in love with a stripper.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to tell the story.</p>
<p>So how did you fall in love with somebody,</p>
<p>not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that profession,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s romantic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a true romance, by the way, great movie.</p>
<p>It is a great film.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly a great film.</p>
<p>Even Brad Pitt, who makes a brief appearance, is genius.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much good acting there.</p>
<p>Anyway, so tell me that love story.</p>
<p>All right, so like I said, from my dad,</p>
<p>I get that fear of being abandoned.</p>
<p>I lied to my wife for nine years until she leaves.</p>
<p>And I was in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
<p>And what happened was, I noticed that Susan,</p>
<p>she was not coming to bed like she used to.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d stay up all night long,</p>
<p>and sometimes she&rsquo;d go and be gone a few hours</p>
<p>and everything else.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, something&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d pass by her computer</p>
<p>and she would minimize the screens.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, gotta figure out</p>
<p>what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>So put a key logger on her system.</p>
<p>As anybody should in a relationship.</p>
<p>Absolutely, because you trust them, so why not?</p>
<p>You should be tracking all their movements,</p>
<p>all their stuff.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Like I said, I was the control freak too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s romantic.</p>
<p>So I found out she&rsquo;d been cheating on me.</p>
<p>And she was.</p>
<p>See, there you go, they had a reason.</p>
<p>They had a reason, I justified.</p>
<p>So I found out she was cheating on me.</p>
<p>She was asleep when I found it out.</p>
<p>And I sat there looking at it and I was like, well, shit.</p>
<p>So I got up, walked in the bedroom,</p>
<p>opened up the wardrobe, got a suitcase out,</p>
<p>started putting her clothes in it.</p>
<p>And she wakes up, she&rsquo;s like, where are you going?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m not, you are.</p>
<p>Well, my bravado disappeared pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I took about a week of both of us</p>
<p>crying and arguing and everything else.</p>
<p>And she finally left.</p>
<p>And I went through this depression.</p>
<p>I was in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
<p>I would just walk around the house kind of stumbling in a daze.</p>
<p>Realized I was getting suicidal.</p>
<p>And was smart enough to do something about it.</p>
<p>And picked up the phone book.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where there&rsquo;s always this sense of humor.</p>
<p>So I picked up the phone book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through the yellow pages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, psychologist, criminal psychologist,</p>
<p>because I need that.</p>
<p>Called the psychologist, crying to her.</p>
<p>I mean, crying on the phone.</p>
<p>Told her everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m this criminal.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, come in now.</p>
<p>So I go in, spill my guts.</p>
<p>And saw her for about four months.</p>
<p>And I joke about it, but it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>She was trying to get me to stop breaking the law</p>
<p>and to go into real estate.</p>
<p>And I remember telling her, is there a difference?</p>
<p>She was like, yes, there&rsquo;s a difference.</p>
<p>So I saw her for about four months.</p>
<p>I was 34.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t start drinking until I was 34.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never done drugs or anything else like that,</p>
<p>because my mom was an addict as well.</p>
<p>So I was this guy that always wanted to be in control.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t want to lose control of myself.</p>
<p>And had never been to a strip club.</p>
<p>So one night, I was getting lonely.</p>
<p>So I walked into the strip club.</p>
<p>Actually, I was researching the strip club.</p>
<p>And it was Joe&rsquo;s Roundup in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s Roundup.</p>
<p>Little bitty hole in the wall stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, real classy.</p>
<p>So I walked in, and I&rsquo;m literally</p>
<p>that guy, man, that fell in love with the first stripper</p>
<p>that he sees.</p>
<p>She walks by, I&rsquo;m like, that one.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t know the strip club game.</p>
<p>Again, criminal, naive as hell.</p>
<p>So belly up at the bar, order the beer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting there drinking it.</p>
<p>She comes over to me, and we start talking.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, would you like to get a bottle of champagne?</p>
<p>I was like, does that mean going in back or what?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, well, yeah, you need to do the bottle</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going back.</p>
<p>And I was like, sure, let&rsquo;s buy a bottle of champagne.</p>
<p>$400 bottle of Korbel.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, all right.</p>
<p>And again, that bravado disappears pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I get back there, and we talk for two hours.</p>
<p>And nowadays, I don&rsquo;t understand that most men</p>
<p>who go to strip clubs, the strippers</p>
<p>are their therapist most of the time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sitting there talking, we&rsquo;re talking.</p>
<p>And of course, she&rsquo;s sizing me up.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s looking at the watch.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, what kind of car do you drive?</p>
<p>Everything else.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m telling her and talking.</p>
<p>So at the end of the night, I&rsquo;m like, really nice meeting.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s so nice meeting you, too.</p>
<p>So I leave.</p>
<p>You guys just talked.</p>
<p>Just talked.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still this feeling of love and all of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so just talked.</p>
<p>Just got along pretty good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I like her.</p>
<p>I like her.</p>
<p>So come back in a week later.</p>
<p>Walk in and call her over.</p>
<p>And I was like, look, I said, that was my first time</p>
<p>to a strip club.</p>
<p>I said, don&rsquo;t know you.</p>
<p>I like you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know you more.</p>
<p>Would you like to go out to dinner?</p>
<p>And she was like, yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, where would you like to go?</p>
<p>So she says, Rue de Jon.</p>
<p>And I was like, don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ll go.</p>
<p>So I go back.</p>
<p>And I had a theater buddy at that point in time</p>
<p>because I was trying to get my life together.</p>
<p>JC was his name.</p>
<p>And I was like, I got a date.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you got a date?</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, man, I got a date.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, OK, where are you going?</p>
<p>I was like, Rue de Jon.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, take your wallet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, take your wallet.</p>
<p>I was like, all right.</p>
<p>So we start doing the lunch and the dinner thing.</p>
<p>And I get to where I really like her.</p>
<p>I was 34.</p>
<p>She was 23 and got along really well,</p>
<p>had common interest in music and arts and stuff like that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s stereotypical.</p>
<p>She had graduated college with a degree in religious studies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I was like, all right.</p>
<p>So yeah, you just fell in love.</p>
<p>We got along really well, really well.</p>
<p>So I ended up moving her in with me.</p>
<p>She hadn&rsquo;t quit her job.</p>
<p>And what was happening was she was working weekends.</p>
<p>And the club would close at 3 or 4.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t come home until 10 or 11 in the morning.</p>
<p>And most of the time, it would be a phone call saying,</p>
<p>come and pick me up.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t drive home.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d never used drugs, had never been around.</p>
<p>And my mom, Valium and pot and things like that.</p>
<p>But as far as interacting with her,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never done anything like that.</p>
<p>By this point in time, I&rsquo;m kind of getting head over heels</p>
<p>with her.</p>
<p>I moved her in with me and everything.</p>
<p>And I had never, I was 34, I had never</p>
<p>went through a woman&rsquo;s purse in my entire life.</p>
<p>And so she comes in, passes out.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I got to know what the fuck&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And went over and went through her purse.</p>
<p>Found cocaine and the straw, cut off straws and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, broke my heart.</p>
<p>I just sat there and started crying.</p>
<p>Got online, and I&rsquo;m the guy that can find information.</p>
<p>So I started looking for forums on strip clubs.</p>
<p>Found a forum, found that one, found</p>
<p>where it was talking about her prostituting herself</p>
<p>to support the habit.</p>
<p>And that got me, man.</p>
<p>That got me.</p>
<p>It was talking about everything she was doing to do that.</p>
<p>And I broke your heart there.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell her</p>
<p>that I knew she was prostituting.</p>
<p>But I went to her, and I was like, she&rsquo;s waking up.</p>
<p>And I was like, look, I found this in your purse.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, well, you think I&rsquo;m prostituting?</p>
<p>I was like, no, no, I don&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>I knew it, but I didn&rsquo;t mention it to her.</p>
<p>And I was like, I can&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a one time thing.</p>
<p>I was like, all right.</p>
<p>So she went back to work and continued</p>
<p>to do it for a couple more weeks.</p>
<p>And then finally, I was like, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I picked her up one morning.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t drive home.</p>
<p>Before I picked her up, I had written her a note,</p>
<p>left it on the pillow.</p>
<p>So I brought her home, tucked her in the bed,</p>
<p>and told her I&rsquo;d be back that night.</p>
<p>Told her she had a letter when she woke up.</p>
<p>And the letter was basically, I love you.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t stop this, don&rsquo;t be here when I get back.</p>
<p>And I went to Columbia that day, came back that night,</p>
<p>and she had quit her job.</p>
<p>And she quit drugs that night, really quit them.</p>
<p>And I got it in my head that I needed</p>
<p>to do whatever I needed to do to make sure she didn&rsquo;t go back</p>
<p>to that.</p>
<p>That became, to me, because of my background,</p>
<p>that meant spending a lot of money.</p>
<p>And so every night was $300 to $600 for dinner.</p>
<p>It was $1,000 shoes every week, $2,000 purse every week,</p>
<p>all that.</p>
<p>I had most of my money laundered out to Estonia.</p>
<p>And Elizabeth, at the same time, she quit.</p>
<p>But she didn&rsquo;t want me to go anywhere.</p>
<p>All right, she wanted me there all the time.</p>
<p>I guess that was that connection.</p>
<p>I guess she was scared she might go back to something.</p>
<p>So Shadow Crew gets busted.</p>
<p>I go through, basically, all my US funds.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t get anything from overseas.</p>
<p>Shadow Crew gets busted October.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t go into committing tax fraud because season&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t go back into credit fraud because Shadow Crew&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been busted.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who to trust online.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m left with running counterfeit cashier&rsquo;s checks</p>
<p>to get money in, trying to make it until I can start back</p>
<p>with some other fraud, and lying to her the entire time.</p>
<p>She knows about none of this.</p>
<p>None of it.</p>
<p>And she thinks I&rsquo;ve got a shitload of money.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s got expensive taste.</p>
<p>So at the same time, she couldn&rsquo;t be intimate.</p>
<p>I mean, the girl loved me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve really said that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s deep love there both ways.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Things we do.</p>
<p>So she couldn&rsquo;t be intimate unless she was stone cold drunk.</p>
<p>I mean, just shit.</p>
<p>Stone cold drunk.</p>
<p>And shit, I didn&rsquo;t mind her drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather have that than cocaine.</p>
<p>So that was the intimacy there.</p>
<p>And I kept thinking, if I continue to invest,</p>
<p>that it would work out, that just keep going,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll be all right, we&rsquo;ll be all right.</p>
<p>And what happens is, like I said, she thought I had money.</p>
<p>She thought I had money.</p>
<p>She wanted a couple of Tiffany engagement rings.</p>
<p>So I said, we can get married.</p>
<p>I figured of marriage, show her that I love her,</p>
<p>show her it&rsquo;s going to be all right.</p>
<p>So I was like, let&rsquo;s get married.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, well, I&rsquo;ve always wanted a Tiffany ring.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t have money to buy the Tiffany ring</p>
<p>because all my money was overseas.</p>
<p>So here I am.</p>
<p>I defraud.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s counterfeit cashiers.</p>
<p>I find like a three carat ring on eBay for 20 grand</p>
<p>and pay for it with a counterfeit cashiers check.</p>
<p>At the same time, because she doesn&rsquo;t want me to leave,</p>
<p>she needs me there, typically, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing that type of crime, you need to be traveling.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do it in one central area</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to be identified pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I knew that, but I didn&rsquo;t have much choice.</p>
<p>So start running counterfeit cashiers checks</p>
<p>to get the money to live and everything.</p>
<p>Get the engagement ring.</p>
<p>We were scheduled to be married. Our wedding date</p>
<p>was February 26, 2005.</p>
<p>February 8, 2005.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a Tiffany wedding band, a couple of them coming in.</p>
<p>And I get arrested in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I told her, I said, I&rsquo;ve got to go pick up those rings.</p>
<p>She thought I was just having them sent in.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;ve got to go get those rings.</p>
<p>And I said, we&rsquo;ll go out to dinner after that.</p>
<p>And I left at like 8 o clock in the morning.</p>
<p>And I was arrested at, I think, 1130, something like that.</p>
<p>Of course, I wanted to call her.</p>
<p>And the FBI got me.</p>
<p>It turns out it was controlled delivery.</p>
<p>There were like 30 agents in the parking lot.</p>
<p>FBI got me.</p>
<p>Charleston PD got me.</p>
<p>Within 45 minutes, the Secret Service</p>
<p>comes in, takes over that investigation.</p>
<p>They knew exactly who they had.</p>
<p>Along about 7 o clock at night, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, we want to search your house.</p>
<p>And I was like, look, I&rsquo;ll sign off on the search</p>
<p>if you let me go with you so I can see her.</p>
<p>And they were like, OK.</p>
<p>So I got to see my phone at that point.</p>
<p>I had like 140 calls where she had</p>
<p>been trying to call all that time.</p>
<p>She was worried.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so they load me up.</p>
<p>And hell, I mean, you talk about 10, 12 cars, 40 agents,</p>
<p>everything else.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got a dog at that point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared they&rsquo;re going to shoot the dog.</p>
<p>And it was dark.</p>
<p>And they had me walk up.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all behind me.</p>
<p>I knock on the door and tell her the police are there.</p>
<p>She needs to put the dog up.</p>
<p>So she does, and they come in and just</p>
<p>start ransacking them to put me in cuffs, set me down,</p>
<p>start berating her with questions.</p>
<p>She had no idea what the hell was going on.</p>
<p>Were you able to say a word or two to help her understand?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was trying to tell her.</p>
<p>And at the same time, they take a watch off her wrist.</p>
<p>They let her keep the ring.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re telling her that I&rsquo;m this guy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s my real name?</p>
<p>Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang across the board.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s probably terrified.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I tell her, I was like, look,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to arraign me tomorrow.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>I said, see what&rsquo;s going on, but don&rsquo;t show up.</p>
<p>Of course, she&rsquo;s there next morning.</p>
<p>Her and her dad.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s back in the back crying.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re reading off the charges.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m under $300,000 bond, everything else.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>They throw me in a cell.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more charges keep coming in.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like 10, 12 charges a day at that point.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to call her to make sure she&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>And does it get through?</p>
<p>So I spent three months in jail.</p>
<p>And during that three months, she visits twice.</p>
<p>I get like three or four phone calls to her.</p>
<p>Looking back now, I understand why.</p>
<p>Back then, it was like, I&rsquo;m the victim.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t she talk to me?</p>
<p>But now I understand why.</p>
<p>Hell, the girl loved me too.</p>
<p>She found out I was this piece of shit.</p>
<p>And after a week in county jail, two agents</p>
<p>fly in from New Jersey, two Secret Service guys.</p>
<p>Pulled me out of cell, looked at me, and they were like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got your laptop.</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, have you got anything on your laptop?</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re going to be charged for it.</p>
<p>I was like, I figured.</p>
<p>And then he looks at me, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>can you do anything for us?</p>
<p>And I told him my exact words were, look,</p>
<p>you let me get back with Elizabeth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do whatever you want me to do.</p>
<p>And he looks at me, he&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re going to get you out.</p>
<p>I was like, all right.</p>
<p>So they let me sit there for three months</p>
<p>to get a taste of it and get me out.</p>
<p>My sister, they have the bond reduced to $1,000.</p>
<p>My sister pays the $1,000 bond.</p>
<p>By this point, she&rsquo;s disowned me.</p>
<p>And because I&rsquo;m dating the stripper.</p>
<p>And Denise bonds me out.</p>
<p>The person that I call immediately is Elizabeth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ll be there.</p>
<p>I was like, OK.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like 11 o clock at night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the parking lot of the Charleston County jail.</p>
<p>Me and a Secret Service agent standing there.</p>
<p>And Elizabeth had a friend that owned a limo company.</p>
<p>So she pulls up in a limo, gets out, pops the trunk,</p>
<p>gets these two plastic containers out</p>
<p>that have my clothes in them, drops them off the pavement,</p>
<p>comes over, hugs me, call me later.</p>
<p>Gets in the car, drives off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting there crying like a baby.</p>
<p>Agent looks at me, is that your fiancee?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I am so sorry.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah.</p>
<p>I had to.</p>
<p>She sounds fascinating.</p>
<p>Pull up in a limo.</p>
<p>I had $30 in my name at that point, $30.</p>
<p>The agent had to pay for my hotel room that first night.</p>
<p>So he drops me off after paying for the hotel room,</p>
<p>buy me something to eat.</p>
<p>Soon as he drops me off, I take that $30,</p>
<p>walk a half mile to Walmart, buy a prepaid debit card</p>
<p>so I can start back in tax fraud.</p>
<p>Soon as I get back to the hotel room, call Elizabeth,</p>
<p>beg her to come see me.</p>
<p>She comes to see me, and we talk most of the night,</p>
<p>and convince her to give me a chance.</p>
<p>I tell her that everything&rsquo;s going to be all right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to hire me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be this big consultant.</p>
<p>Lies, lies, just so she&rsquo;d get back with me.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, OK.</p>
<p>And so we move from Charleston.</p>
<p>The field office is in Columbia, South Carolina.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m breaking the law.</p>
<p>Even before I start working with them, I&rsquo;m breaking the law.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve got me in the office, the field office.</p>
<p>They got this big war room in there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a laptop, outside line, laptops hooked up</p>
<p>to a 50 inch plasma monitor on the wall.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a desktop sitting directly next to me,</p>
<p>outside line, two Secret Service officers in the room</p>
<p>at all times with a South Carolina law enforcement officer.</p>
<p>My job is 46 hours a day, surfing the web,</p>
<p>picking up targets, intel, teaching them</p>
<p>how cybercrime operates, everything else like that.</p>
<p>For the first two weeks, they are extremely diligent.</p>
<p>They pay attention to everything that&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>ask questions, everything else.</p>
<p>But the problem is that that shit gets boring real quick,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m very fast online doing that.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re like, what the hell is he doing?</p>
<p>And it gets tiring looking at a guy just doing that shit.</p>
<p>So after two weeks, they get lazy and bored.</p>
<p>And they start watching porn instead of watching me.</p>
<p>At the same time, they&rsquo;ve got a keylogger.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve got Spectre Pro and Camtasia,</p>
<p>keyloggers and taking snapshots of everything that I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>Every night, it goes on a DVD rom on a spindle.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, they&rsquo;re not going to go through that shit.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, fuck it.</p>
<p>Start breaking the law from inside the Secret Service</p>
<p>offices while they&rsquo;re in the room.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>That continues for 10 months.</p>
<p>At the same time, the relationship with Elizabeth</p>
<p>fell apart, completely fell apart.</p>
<p>Do you have an understanding of why?</p>
<p>Because her heart got broken because there was lying.</p>
<p>It was the trust.</p>
<p>She felt like she did a lot to sacrifice for the relationship.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a woman there that she had even said it.</p>
<p>She was like, she had told one of her friends</p>
<p>we were out having dinner one night.</p>
<p>And this was before I got arrested.</p>
<p>She told one of her friends that I was the only guy that ever</p>
<p>asked her to stop using drugs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have to say that part of the story is so powerful.</p>
<p>And then that she chose to do it, and she chose to stop.</p>
<p>And she told me that there was one instance she told me</p>
<p>that if she didn&rsquo;t marry me, she&rsquo;d never be married.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, she&rsquo;s never been married.</p>
<p>And so it started to fall apart there.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I was that piece of shit.</p>
<p>Still, you didn&rsquo;t take a step.</p>
<p>By the way, can I just say how just moving it is,</p>
<p>how honest you are.</p>
<p>But thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for being that person.</p>
<p>But at that time, there&rsquo;s still that lying.</p>
<p>Oh, man, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s falling apart.</p>
<p>She wants to start going to strip clubs.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, fuck it.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go.</p>
<p>So we start going to strip clubs,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;ll come back and get wasted.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll have sex, what have you.</p>
<p>And one night, she looks at me, and she was like,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be funny if you got a blow job</p>
<p>from somebody else.</p>
<p>And that got me.</p>
<p>That got me.</p>
<p>I was like, to me, that was the final straw right there.</p>
<p>I was like, she doesn&rsquo;t care for me anymore or anything else</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been going to strip clubs, so I</p>
<p>started dating another stripper.</p>
<p>And she knew something was going on.</p>
<p>And she looks at me one day, and she&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you just tell me that it&rsquo;s over?</p>
<p>And I looked at her, and I said, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>And I told her, I was like, look, I said, whatever you want.</p>
<p>We were renting an apartment.</p>
<p>I was like, whatever you want in here, take it.</p>
<p>And I said, not only that, but I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make sure you got money for several months</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re all right.</p>
<p>And I was like, just leave me my TV</p>
<p>and leave me some plates and stuff.</p>
<p>So I go to work that day at the Secret Service,</p>
<p>come back that night, and she&rsquo;s taken everything</p>
<p>and left a picture of herself in the bedroom on the floor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, OK, I guess I deserve that.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got, I like her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Yeah, she was cool.</p>
<p>She was cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving her $1,000 every two weeks</p>
<p>or some shit like that.</p>
<p>And it gets to the point, because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing this tax fraud from inside the offices.</p>
<p>Well, the debit card companies are pinging the cards.</p>
<p>They start to realize that, hey, some son of a bitch</p>
<p>is stealing money using our debit card.</p>
<p>So they start to shut down the cards</p>
<p>before I can pull cash out.</p>
<p>So I start not to have the money to send to her.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, so she calls, and she&rsquo;s like, look,</p>
<p>I have to have money.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, look, I&rsquo;m doing what I can.</p>
<p>You promised money.</p>
<p>And I was like, look, if you knew</p>
<p>what I was doing to get this money,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be asking that.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, I need money.</p>
<p>My rent&rsquo;s behind by a month right now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, your rent&rsquo;s behind?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>So I was like, OK, so I pick up the phone,</p>
<p>call the rental office.</p>
<p>And I was like, I just want to make sure that I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m behind on the rent for this apartment number.</p>
<p>Oh, no, that rent&rsquo;s paid up three months.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, OK, hang up, call Elizabeth back.</p>
<p>I was like, you&rsquo;re behind on the rent.</p>
<p>And she was like, yeah.</p>
<p>And I was like, funny, they just said</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re up on it three months.</p>
<p>And she gets quiet, and she&rsquo;s like, well, you lied to me, too.</p>
<p>And I was like, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I did that.</p>
<p>I was like, but look, I can&rsquo;t do it anymore.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the last time I spoke to her right there.</p>
<p>What happens is I was breaking law</p>
<p>from inside the offices.</p>
<p>I had a buddy that his name was Sean Mims out of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>I had taught him how to do tax return fraud.</p>
<p>I had told Sean, I go missing, I go missing for three months.</p>
<p>I told him if I ever went missing not to contact me.</p>
<p>And so I go missing, then I show back up online.</p>
<p>First day, he contacts.</p>
<p>So he becomes a target.</p>
<p>And they identify him pretty quickly at that point.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s set to be arrested sometime in March of six.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when he&rsquo;s set to be arrested.</p>
<p>Operation Rolling Stone was the name of the operation.</p>
<p>Nine people were supposed to be arrested that night.</p>
<p>So Secret Service goes and arrests this guy.</p>
<p>They search his apartment and don&rsquo;t find anything.</p>
<p>The apartment manager comes out and explains to him</p>
<p>how Sean has done all kinds of work to the apartment.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he brought in $30,000 worth of Italian tile</p>
<p>to put in the apartment that he&rsquo;s renting.</p>
<p>And by the way, last night he had a UHaul out here</p>
<p>and took out a whole shitload of stuff.</p>
<p>So Secret Service comes back in.</p>
<p>They look at me and they&rsquo;re like, we</p>
<p>need you to take a polygraph.</p>
<p>And my answer was, I ain&rsquo;t taking a polygraph.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re like, well, we&rsquo;ll throw you back in jail</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I was like, call my lawyer.</p>
<p>Lawyer gets me on the phone.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t have to take the polygraph.</p>
<p>I was like, well, good, I&rsquo;m not going to.</p>
<p>But they will throw you back in jail.</p>
<p>And I was like, don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, have you done anything?</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, you can try to pass the polygraph.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, OK.</p>
<p>So I slipped out.</p>
<p>I was like, let&rsquo;s take the polygraph.</p>
<p>They asked three questions.</p>
<p>The questions were, have you talked to anybody?</p>
<p>Have you been on a computer outside of the offices?</p>
<p>Have you talked to the press, which</p>
<p>I was interviewing with a New York Times</p>
<p>writer the entire time?</p>
<p>And then have you contacted or warned anybody</p>
<p>about investigations?</p>
<p>And I failed polygraph completely.</p>
<p>So they revoked the bond, took me back down</p>
<p>to Charleston County, throw me into jail.</p>
<p>Three days later, Secret Service shows back up</p>
<p>and pulled me out of a cell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Jim Ramacone and Bobby Kirby.</p>
<p>And I mean, honestly, they were good men.</p>
<p>And they gave me chances upon chances to do the right thing.</p>
<p>And I was not ready to do that.</p>
<p>And Jim Ramacone and Bobby&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>And Bobby, I mean, Bobby was a friend.</p>
<p>I mean, he truly was.</p>
<p>Later on, a couple of years ago, I had a chance to have lunch</p>
<p>with a man.</p>
<p>And I told him I was sorry for everything I did to him</p>
<p>because I got him and another agent fired.</p>
<p>And I told him I was sorry for what happened.</p>
<p>And he told me then, he&rsquo;s like, we were your friends, man.</p>
<p>We were truly your friends.</p>
<p>So they were good men.</p>
<p>They wanted to help.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They wanted you to be a good man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What got me so damn bad is I told him,</p>
<p>I was like, man, I&rsquo;m trying to be a better guy.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, Brett, you always were a good guy.</p>
<p>You just didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>People like that, we need people like that in this world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You need somebody to basically believe that you</p>
<p>can be a good man.</p>
<p>So Jim Ramacone pulls me out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the second in charge in South Carolina.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got the Miranda waiver in front of him, right?</p>
<p>And he looks at me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m playing hard ass.</p>
<p>Bobby&rsquo;s over here looking distraught and like a hurt dog.</p>
<p>And Jim&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s the way this is going to work.</p>
<p>He said, you&rsquo;re going to tell me everything you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>the past six years, or I&rsquo;m going to make it my mission in life</p>
<p>to fuck over you and your family.</p>
<p>And he said, not just this case.</p>
<p>Once you get out of prison, I&rsquo;ll hound you</p>
<p>the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Then he slides the Miranda waiver over,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, now you want to talk?</p>
<p>And I looked at him, and I was like, nope.</p>
<p>He was like, he gets up, gets all red in the face,</p>
<p>storms out on the way out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, fuck you very much.</p>
<p>So I go back to the cell.</p>
<p>A week later, I was only under state charges.</p>
<p>A week later, judge rules they revoke the bond improperly.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Reinstates the bond.</p>
<p>Nobody calls the Secret Service to tell them I walk out.</p>
<p>I walk out.</p>
<p>I was dating this stripper, and I told my mom.</p>
<p>I was like, well, if they&rsquo;re going to fuck me,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to have to find me.</p>
<p>She just went on the move.</p>
<p>Yeah, I called this stripper girl up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d given her like 60K, some bullshit like that.</p>
<p>And I told her, I was like, Kim, I need some money.</p>
<p>And she was like, what?</p>
<p>I was like, look, I said, give me $1,000.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you back $3,000 in two weeks.</p>
<p>She was like, OK.</p>
<p>So I met her in Augusta, Georgia,</p>
<p>and got the $1,000 from her and started driving west on I20.</p>
<p>No idea where to go to, anything else.</p>
<p>Got to Dallas.</p>
<p>There was a prepaid debit card supplier in Dallas.</p>
<p>Went in, walked in the office, convinced the guy,</p>
<p>social engineering, convinced the guy</p>
<p>to give me 60 prepaid debit cards without a driver&rsquo;s</p>
<p>license, without payment, anything else he did.</p>
<p>And that started the run.</p>
<p>I ended up stealing.</p>
<p>From that, I stole like 160K profit,</p>
<p>used that to buy a Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>And the idea was to steal enough money</p>
<p>to bug out to Florianopolis, Brazil,</p>
<p>and set up shop down there, and do it again.</p>
<p>That was the dream.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>So I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.</p>
<p>I was in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<p>One day, I had stolen the night before.</p>
<p>I had stolen 160K out of ATMs.</p>
<p>Went in the next morning.</p>
<p>I woke up, signed on to cartersmarket.com,</p>
<p>which was ran by Max Butler, the ice man.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s my name, US Most Wanted on it.</p>
<p>And that gets your attention.</p>
<p>That was my real name with the US Most Wanted beside of it.</p>
<p>Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all.</p>
<p>But then they did.</p>
<p>And it was talking about me being</p>
<p>part of the Secret Service, Operation Anglerfish,</p>
<p>everything else.</p>
<p>So of course, they&rsquo;re all like, everybody&rsquo;s after you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, yeah, we&rsquo;re going to get this son of a bitch.</p>
<p>So I sat there looking at it.</p>
<p>And I was like, said it out loud.</p>
<p>I was like, well, Mr. Johnson, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>made the United States Most Wanted list.</p>
<p>What do you do now?</p>
<p>And I was like, I&rsquo;m going to Disney World.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>Said that out loud.</p>
<p>So loaded up the Jeep, drove from Las Vegas</p>
<p>to Orlando, Florida, and got the two annual passes,</p>
<p>one to Disney World, the other one to Universal Studios.</p>
<p>Paid for a timeshare.</p>
<p>They were building these new timeshares right off</p>
<p>Universal Drive, building these brand new timeshares,</p>
<p>paid for a timeshare in nine months, cash.</p>
<p>I was like, we take cash?</p>
<p>Yeah, we take cash.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s $12,900.</p>
<p>Then it wasn&rsquo;t furnished.</p>
<p>So I went down to a furniture store,</p>
<p>bought $30,000 in furniture.</p>
<p>They had seized a DVD collection of mine worth $30,000,</p>
<p>bought that back, and proceeded to go to Disney World</p>
<p>every day.</p>
<p>And that lasted about six weeks.</p>
<p>They used a trigger fish, is what they use.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it&rsquo;s called a stingray to find me.</p>
<p>So one day, it was like 1030 in the morning on Saturday.</p>
<p>September 16 was the day, 2006.</p>
<p>Yeah, 2006, September 16.</p>
<p>I was used to the builders coming around knocking,</p>
<p>making sure everything was all right.</p>
<p>So I was asleep, heard this knock at the door,</p>
<p>and get up, look through the keyhole, nobody&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>You know, people, nobody&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>I was like, huh.</p>
<p>Open the door, step out into the hallway.</p>
<p>Walking down the hall is Bobby Kirby,</p>
<p>another South Carolina guy and a Orlando Orange County cop.</p>
<p>And they turn around, and they&rsquo;re like, hey, Brett.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, hey, Bobby, how are you?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re good, how are you?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m fine, would you like to come in?</p>
<p>He was like, let&rsquo;s put you in cuffs first.</p>
<p>And I was like, that&rsquo;s probably a good idea.</p>
<p>He was like, he walks in, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>have you got anything in here?</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah, there&rsquo;s $120,000 in the bedroom.</p>
<p>And he was like, seriously?</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, that and an AK 47.</p>
<p>His face goes white, and he&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;ve got a rifle?</p>
<p>And I was like, no, I&rsquo;m kidding with you.</p>
<p>He was like, OK.</p>
<p>So they throw me in jail in Orange County,</p>
<p>and they give me diesel therapy.</p>
<p>And diesel therapy is, it took like two weeks</p>
<p>to transport me from Orange County, Orlando,</p>
<p>to Columbia, South Carolina.</p>
<p>And what happens is, is you stop at every county jail</p>
<p>you possibly can, go through the processing, which</p>
<p>is about six hours.</p>
<p>Once you get to your bunk, hey, time to transport you.</p>
<p>They do that on purpose?</p>
<p>On purpose, on purpose.</p>
<p>Wears you down mentally and physically and everything.</p>
<p>I get to Columbia, South Carolina.</p>
<p>Now, while I was at Orange County, what happens is,</p>
<p>this inmate, because we were in federal holding,</p>
<p>this inmate, he looks at me.</p>
<p>His name was Yeti.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, hey, man, you know,</p>
<p>the only time you get off in federal prison</p>
<p>is the drug program.</p>
<p>I was like, well, man, I don&rsquo;t use drugs.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, you can find a drug problem, can&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>And I was like, I can find a drug problem.</p>
<p>So what happens is, is every county jail I stop at</p>
<p>on the way to Columbia, I tell them I&rsquo;m alcoholic and cocaine.</p>
<p>So by the time I get to Columbia, South Carolina,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got this paper trail of Mr. Johnson</p>
<p>requesting help for drugs.</p>
<p>I had hired Strom Thurmond&rsquo;s son as an attorney.</p>
<p>They make me drop him because I paid for him</p>
<p>with illegal funds.</p>
<p>So they give me a public defender.</p>
<p>He gets a psychological evaluation order for me.</p>
<p>So psychologist comes in county jail, four hour interview.</p>
<p>About halfway through, he looks at me,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, you using these type of drugs?</p>
<p>I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>What do you use?</p>
<p>Cocaine.</p>
<p>Smoke or snort?</p>
<p>Snort.</p>
<p>How much?</p>
<p>An eight ball a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have any trouble out of that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get an erection.</p>
<p>And he looks at me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking at him like, because I had gotten</p>
<p>that shit from Boogie Nights.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;m like, is that right?</p>
<p>And he was like, it could happen.</p>
<p>I was like, OK.</p>
<p>That makes it into my pre sentence report.</p>
<p>So all federal inmates, probation office</p>
<p>and prosecutor, they do this detailed background check</p>
<p>to basically tell the judge how much time to give you.</p>
<p>So that drug bit with that interview makes it into the PSR.</p>
<p>So day of interview, I mean, day of sentencing.</p>
<p>I had pled guilty, day of sentencing.</p>
<p>The prosecutor, he stands up, and this dude</p>
<p>is screaming at this point.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s manipulated</p>
<p>the Secret Service.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s manipulated the prosecutor.</p>
<p>Then he points at the judge.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s manipulating you today, Your Honor.</p>
<p>We insist on the upper limits of the guidelines.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been telling everybody in the jail</p>
<p>that if they give me any more than 60 months,</p>
<p>I am not staying.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like, OK, sure.</p>
<p>So the judge looks at me.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, she says, 75 months.</p>
<p>So I looked at my lawyer, and I was like,</p>
<p>can you get the drug program for me?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know why I ask.</p>
<p>So he stands up.</p>
<p>Your Honor, will you order the drug program for Mr. Johnson?</p>
<p>The judge says, no, but I&rsquo;ll recommend he gets evaluated.</p>
<p>So the Secret Service had told her, hey, he&rsquo;s full of shit.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s like, no, but I&rsquo;ll recommend he gets evaluated.</p>
<p>I looked at my lawyer, and I was like, what does that mean?</p>
<p>He was like, you&rsquo;re probably not going to get it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how soon can you get me to the camp?</p>
<p>And he was like, well, if you don&rsquo;t appeal,</p>
<p>I can get you there pretty quick.</p>
<p>My exact words were, fuck the appeal.</p>
<p>Get me to the camp.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it from there.</p>
<p>He looks at me like I&rsquo;m the biggest idiot in the world.</p>
<p>I get sent to, because you can get a camp recommended.</p>
<p>I have friends, family members look</p>
<p>for camps that don&rsquo;t have a fence around them.</p>
<p>And we settle on Ashland, Kentucky.</p>
<p>Six weeks later, I&rsquo;m in Ashland, Kentucky,</p>
<p>and pull up there, 14 foot fence, a razor wire on top.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t climb fences, so I go in.</p>
<p>First question I ask is, are there any jobs</p>
<p>outside of the fence?</p>
<p>And he was like, guards like, well, you</p>
<p>can work in the national forest.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, I&rsquo;ll die out there.</p>
<p>He was like, well, you could do landscaping.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I can run a weed eater.</p>
<p>Two days later, I walk into the landscaping office,</p>
<p>and the cop, this is this genius of some</p>
<p>of these people and institutions.</p>
<p>The cop, behind his desk, the entire wall</p>
<p>is a blown up photo of the compound and the outlying area.</p>
<p>So I can literally sit there and plot where I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>My dad, I hadn&rsquo;t spoken to that man in years.</p>
<p>And he shows up at my sentencing and stands up</p>
<p>in front of the judge.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, Your Honor, I want to make</p>
<p>sure Brett gets a good start.</p>
<p>He can live with me when he gets out, everything else.</p>
<p>Looking back, the man meant that.</p>
<p>And I just thought it was bullshit at the time.</p>
<p>So he starts to visit me in prison.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, in prison, he starts to visit.</p>
<p>And about the third visit in, he looks at me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve been reading about you online.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s a lot of money you made.</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you think you can teach somebody</p>
<p>how to do that?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, so what I used to say,</p>
<p>and again, it&rsquo;s this thing of really coming</p>
<p>to terms with things.</p>
<p>What I used to say was I thought my dad was back in my life</p>
<p>and that he was just trying to use me.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter was is that my dad</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t really seen me except in that frame of crime,</p>
<p>being that criminal with my mom, everything else.</p>
<p>I really think that&rsquo;s how the man was trying</p>
<p>to communicate with me.</p>
<p>He wanted to connect with you in the places</p>
<p>where you know, where you love, where you&rsquo;re interested in,</p>
<p>where your addiction is, essentially.</p>
<p>And what I did is I manipulated the man</p>
<p>into helping me escape.</p>
<p>So I agreed to teach him how to do tax fraud.</p>
<p>And in return, the only money he had to his name,</p>
<p>he had $4,000 cash.</p>
<p>So I manipulated him into giving me that</p>
<p>and to dropping me off a change of clothes, a cell phone,</p>
<p>and a driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>The only driver&rsquo;s license he had was my driver&rsquo;s license,</p>
<p>Brett Johnson.</p>
<p>So I was at the camp for, I don&rsquo;t know, six, eight weeks.</p>
<p>And the hardest worker that landscaping had ever seen.</p>
<p>At one point, the cops got me on a mountainside</p>
<p>with a broom, sweeping off the mountain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, we&rsquo;ll do that, absolutely.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re building trust with the guys there.</p>
<p>Yeah, working my ass off.</p>
<p>And in six weeks, I take off.</p>
<p>And I lasted, I think, two, three weeks, something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>US Marshals, I made it 100.</p>
<p>They called you escaped.</p>
<p>Yeah, escaped.</p>
<p>Escaped.</p>
<p>US Marshals, they&rsquo;re canvassing a three state area.</p>
<p>They found me, I think, 250 miles away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Lexington, Kentucky.</p>
<p>They found me in Lexington because I had</p>
<p>to use my real driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>I had a laptop.</p>
<p>I had prepaid debit cards.</p>
<p>And I had stolen identity information.</p>
<p>And the way it got me was I had dyed my hair this flaming red.</p>
<p>I had this deep tan.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t look anything like myself.</p>
<p>And I was at a hotel, had the curtains open, saw this guy.</p>
<p>I was on the laptop, saw this guy walk by.</p>
<p>He walks by the window, and he stops.</p>
<p>And then he backs up.</p>
<p>He looks inside.</p>
<p>He knocks on the window.</p>
<p>I look up at him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you.</p>
<p>I was like, me?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you.</p>
<p>Then he pulls out this badge, and he points at it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, and then he points at the door.</p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p>So I was like, oh, OK.</p>
<p>So I open up the door.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, US Marshals Service.</p>
<p>So they arrest me.</p>
<p>How did they track you down?</p>
<p>They canvassed that area.</p>
<p>They talked to every hotel, everything else.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a traditional, like, they were just tracking?</p>
<p>Traditional police work is what it was.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t like, from the internet,</p>
<p>they kind of got something?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, just straight police work.</p>
<p>Good, good, good, good.</p>
<p>US Marshals are outstanding in everything they do.</p>
<p>So they arrest me.</p>
<p>I go to a, I&rsquo;m initially held at a county</p>
<p>jail in Moorhead, Kentucky.</p>
<p>And that, man, that was one hell of an experience there.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;m transferred after sentencing on that.</p>
<p>So sentencing, here&rsquo;s the weird thing.</p>
<p>So I spend like, I think, two or three months at the county</p>
<p>jail in Moorhead, Kentucky.</p>
<p>Get sentenced.</p>
<p>At my sentencing, it happens so quickly</p>
<p>after the initial sentencing that they</p>
<p>use the exact same presentence report.</p>
<p>The report that&rsquo;s got all that drug shit in there.</p>
<p>So at my sentencing, prosecutor&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>Secret Service is there, judge, me, and my attorney.</p>
<p>Prosecutor stands up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, Your Honor, we would like</p>
<p>it if you would consider that when Mr. Johnson was arrested,</p>
<p>he had a laptop, he had all this information with him,</p>
<p>looks like he was engaged in identity theft yet again.</p>
<p>Judge looks at the prosecutor, says no.</p>
<p>Says, hey, if you were going to charge him with it,</p>
<p>you should have charged him with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only considering the escape.</p>
<p>Then he looks at me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, Mr. Johnson.</p>
<p>He said, it looks like by you keeping your mouth shut right</p>
<p>now, you&rsquo;re really saving yourself</p>
<p>a pretty serious charge.</p>
<p>And my response was, yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p>And he was like, then he opens up the presentence report,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fingering through, and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it also looks like before you got</p>
<p>involved with all these drugs, you were a pretty good citizen.</p>
<p>I was like, yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, so here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m going to give you 18 months on the escape.</p>
<p>I was like, OK.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m also going to give you,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s 15 months on the escape.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m going to give you 15 months on the escape.</p>
<p>He said, and I&rsquo;m also going to order the drug program for you.</p>
<p>I was like, yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p>So the drug program gives you a year off,</p>
<p>and it gives you six months and halfway house.</p>
<p>So by escaping, I got out of prison three months earlier</p>
<p>than what I should have gotten out of it.</p>
<p>So the original thing about drugs worked in the long term.</p>
<p>The interesting thing with that, and this</p>
<p>was the best lie I ever told, honestly,</p>
<p>the best lie I ever told.</p>
<p>I spent eight months in solitary confinement, eight months.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an experience.</p>
<p>Because you ain&rsquo;t got no books for the first month or so,</p>
<p>then they give you a King James Bible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then for a month, no books.</p>
<p>No books for a month.</p>
<p>This is a pretty small and.</p>
<p>Six by nine room.</p>
<p>Six by nine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No books.</p>
<p>No books, no paper, no pen, no pencil.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re alone with your mind.</p>
<p>You got a mat, a toilet.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>You sleep as much as you can.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sleeping 16, 18 hours a day is what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>What about, were you thinking about even just going back</p>
<p>like Elizabeth?</p>
<p>You think about.</p>
<p>You go through all that.</p>
<p>The whole thing.</p>
<p>Through all that.</p>
<p>Every bit.</p>
<p>Your mom, too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Going through every single bit of that.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re supposed to get out an hour a day.</p>
<p>Law says you&rsquo;re supposed to get out an hour a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the law.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the way things actually happen.</p>
<p>What actually happens is you&rsquo;re lucky to get out an hour a week.</p>
<p>You take a shower twice a week, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>You get a phone call once a month.</p>
<p>Oh, so you don&rsquo;t get to see nature.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting solitary.</p>
<p>And it takes about a week.</p>
<p>The first week is the roughest.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re bouncing off the walls that first week</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t sleep, can&rsquo;t do anything else.</p>
<p>Then you start to adapt to it after a while.</p>
<p>When that book does arrive, you&rsquo;re happy as hell to have it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m well versed in King James Bible.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re happy to have it.</p>
<p>Then finally, you get other books</p>
<p>that come in from that point.</p>
<p>Spent eight months at that.</p>
<p>And they send me out to a real prison, Big Spring, Texas,</p>
<p>West Texas, where have you been out there?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Man.</p>
<p>But I could tell.</p>
<p>Prairie dogs and tarantulas is what it is.</p>
<p>No kidding, it gets so hot that warnings</p>
<p>come on the radio telling you not to drive on certain streets</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re melted.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Big Spring.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve seen the movie From Dusk</p>
<p>Till Dawn, the opening scene is in Big Spring, Texas.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hot.</p>
<p>Yeah, very hot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I find out what a real prison is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not ran by guards.</p>
<p>Prisons are ran by inmates.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re met at the door by whatever race you are</p>
<p>is what happens.</p>
<p>So Big Spring is a converted Air Force compound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a disciplinary prison.</p>
<p>So you get the bad guys are in there.</p>
<p>So I go through processing, and I&rsquo;m walking up to the unit,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m met at the door by a guy named Nick Sandifer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the treasurer of the Aryan Brotherhood.</p>
<p>And first question out of his mouth</p>
<p>is, any more white guys come in?</p>
<p>And shit, I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I was like, hell, I don&rsquo;t know, four or five?</p>
<p>Next question is, what are you in here for?</p>
<p>My answer was, because I&rsquo;m like, I got no worries.</p>
<p>My answer was, computer crime.</p>
<p>Smiled at him.</p>
<p>Turns out, wrong thing to say, because computer crime is not</p>
<p>credit card theft or hacking or any bullshit like that.</p>
<p>Computer crime in prison is child pornography.</p>
<p>So tell him that.</p>
<p>He looks at me like I&rsquo;m a piece of shit,</p>
<p>goes and gets his buddies.</p>
<p>They circle around.</p>
<p>What are you in here for?</p>
<p>I like how the Aryan Brotherhood has lines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, yeah, this is child porn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bad guy.</p>
<p>They circle around.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, what did you say you&rsquo;re in here for?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sitting there trying to explain it to them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, you tell a good story.</p>
<p>You still said this.</p>
<p>Computer crime basically really does</p>
<p>mean usually child pornography.</p>
<p>In prison, yeah.</p>
<p>And what you see, and that&rsquo;s one of things you find out,</p>
<p>the guys that are going in there for child porn,</p>
<p>they will tell them it&rsquo;s credit card theft.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m that guy.</p>
<p>But you also don&rsquo;t, I mean, for people</p>
<p>who are just listening to this, you don&rsquo;t exactly look</p>
<p>like the typical computer hacker.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very true.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t look like the pedophile either.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like it doesn&rsquo;t make it seem like you&rsquo;re, I mean,</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;re not wearing a hoodie,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not like emo, dark.</p>
<p>The way it actually works in prison,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t attack you until they know.</p>
<p>So they have to see paperwork, which now in federal prison,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get transported with paperwork because of that.</p>
<p>So they have to see paperwork, or a guard</p>
<p>will tell them what you&rsquo;re in there for.</p>
<p>Guards will tell who the pedophiles are.</p>
<p>So none of the guards told them that it was anything.</p>
<p>So for the first month, they think I am,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not doing anything because they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know for sure.</p>
<p>At the end of the first month, I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been talking to Kevin Polson over at Wired Magazine</p>
<p>about Max Butler.</p>
<p>He does an article about that.</p>
<p>It shows up in Wired Magazine.</p>
<p>So at the end of the first month,</p>
<p>Wired Magazine hits a compound, front cover, all the story.</p>
<p>You would think.</p>
<p>You would think it saved me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m reading the article, really happy about it.</p>
<p>So what happens is four o clock is mail call.</p>
<p>Four o clock&rsquo;s a stand up count nationwide.</p>
<p>After four o clock is your mail call.</p>
<p>They hand out all the mail for the day.</p>
<p>So the mail comes, I get the magazine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading through it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, shit, I&rsquo;m good to go.</p>
<p>Then it says, Brett Johnson, Secret Service informant</p>
<p>in the article.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re now a snitch.</p>
<p>Which is right up there with the pedophiles.</p>
<p>So we go to dinner after that.</p>
<p>At dinner, you can hear it.</p>
<p>You can hear the chat.</p>
<p>We got a snitch.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s that guy over there.</p>
<p>Warden, next day, shuts down the entire compound,</p>
<p>calls me into his office.</p>
<p>They got security there.</p>
<p>They got the counselors there and everything else.</p>
<p>Warden looks at me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, did you give an interview to Wired Magazine?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, do you not know they will kill you in here?</p>
<p>I was like, he was like, do you feel safe?</p>
<p>Well, I know if you tell me you don&rsquo;t feel safe,</p>
<p>they transport you.</p>
<p>Transport you means another eight months</p>
<p>in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>You start to see shit in solitary after a while.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, no, not gonna do that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, completely safe.</p>
<p>He was like, look, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if anybody says anything to you, immediately come to us</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll fucking kill you.</p>
<p>So they do a locker search,</p>
<p>try to confiscate the magazines.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The next day, I walk into the unit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Nick Sandefur laying on his bunk,</p>
<p>magazine wide open reading it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh shit.</p>
<p>Walked up to him.</p>
<p>I was like, hey, Nick, what are you doing?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh, doing some reading.</p>
<p>I was like, anything interesting?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s getting there.</p>
<p>I was like, let me save you the trouble.</p>
<p>Take the magazine, turn it over to the page.</p>
<p>I was like, right there is what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>He was like, man, I already knew.</p>
<p>I was like, do we have a problem?</p>
<p>And he looks at me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, is anyone on the compound you told on?</p>
<p>I was like, no.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, until someone gets here, you snitched on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p>I was like, okay.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, but I need you to do something for me.</p>
<p>All right, so in federal prison, you gotta have a job.</p>
<p>Everybody works.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do, but you gotta work.</p>
<p>I got a job in education teaching a lit class.</p>
<p>Every Wednesday, six to 8.30 PM, lit.</p>
<p>And had all, every area on the compound</p>
<p>signs up for the lit class.</p>
<p>Had a couple of guards every now and then popped in.</p>
<p>And did we teach lit?</p>
<p>No, we taught fraud.</p>
<p>Every Wednesday, six to 8.30 PM.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I didn&rsquo;t get my ass beaten.</p>
<p>And my other job, I had two jobs with them.</p>
<p>The other job, you get to the point, it&rsquo;s weird, man.</p>
<p>You get to the point, people walking off the bus,</p>
<p>you know immediately two groups of people.</p>
<p>You know who the bank robbers are immediately.</p>
<p>Just by them walking off the bus,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, that motherfucker&rsquo;s a bank robber.</p>
<p>And you know who the pedophiles are immediately.</p>
<p>So my job as the white guy was to approach</p>
<p>the white pedophiles and have a conversation.</p>
<p>And the conversation was basically,</p>
<p>hey, don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re in here for.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;re in here for.</p>
<p>But if you got some sort of fucked up charge,</p>
<p>you need to tell me.</p>
<p>If you tell me, everything&rsquo;s gonna be all right.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t tell me, you see those guys over there?</p>
<p>If you start to associate with them</p>
<p>or they start to talk to you,</p>
<p>and then they find out you&rsquo;re in here on something,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna kill you.</p>
<p>And what are the things, pedophile?</p>
<p>Pedophile, rapist, anything that harms children,</p>
<p>harms women, anything like that.</p>
<p>And there are, it&rsquo;s like the mob,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s rules, there&rsquo;s an ethical code.</p>
<p>Even if you have the division between races on all that,</p>
<p>you still have these lines drawn.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a hierarchy too.</p>
<p>Very, very much so.</p>
<p>And what that looks like in prison,</p>
<p>depending on the, it depends on the security class</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re in, what level prison.</p>
<p>But at that prison, what that looked like</p>
<p>was you&rsquo;re not allowed to talk to anybody.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to watch television.</p>
<p>You can go to the library.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t associate with anyone except your own type.</p>
<p>If you do anything like this, we will kill you.</p>
<p>If someone wants to extort you,</p>
<p>we will do that too and you won&rsquo;t tell on us</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ll kill you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way that works at that point.</p>
<p>And everybody quickly large this.</p>
<p>Quickly, quickly.</p>
<p>And so typically the guys would say,</p>
<p>I just wanna do my own time.</p>
<p>That would be the line.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, okay, don&rsquo;t mess with him, all right?</p>
<p>Every now and then you&rsquo;d have somebody lie</p>
<p>and that would come with those types of consequences.</p>
<p>I got to see, while I was there, saw two people murdered,</p>
<p>saw, went through three prison riots</p>
<p>and through my entire tenure in prison, saw four suicides.</p>
<p>The people who got killed, it was,</p>
<p>so we had, outside you had this track,</p>
<p>a third of a mile track.</p>
<p>You walk it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>And inside of the track, you got two handball courts.</p>
<p>So of an evening that happened both times,</p>
<p>all of us would be walking, doing our exercises.</p>
<p>And at the top of the key, like a flock of birds,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d see all the inmates start to migrate down</p>
<p>toward the gate.</p>
<p>So the first time you see that, you see that migration,</p>
<p>you look up in the distance and one of the inmates</p>
<p>got another inmate down and he&rsquo;s just hammering his head</p>
<p>right into the pavement, like that right there.</p>
<p>Well, guards don&rsquo;t stop that because a guard may get hurt.</p>
<p>So a guard is 15 minutes coming out to stop that</p>
<p>until everything&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>By that point, the guy doesn&rsquo;t have a head.</p>
<p>They shut the compound down and this is what happens.</p>
<p>So you shut the entire compound down.</p>
<p>They make two lines of the inmates.</p>
<p>And what happens is the inmate walks into a room,</p>
<p>they shut the door behind the inmate,</p>
<p>guard asks them two questions.</p>
<p>First question is, did you see anything?</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>Second question is, if you had seen anything,</p>
<p>would you say anything?</p>
<p>Answer is no.</p>
<p>Guard then says, get the fuck out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Anybody that stays in any longer than that</p>
<p>is automatically suspect.</p>
<p>So there was one incident, I remember this Hispanic guy,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in there for a few minutes.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>So his people then call him over,</p>
<p>explain to us what went on.</p>
<p>And it happens like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating because you talked about</p>
<p>the network of trust in the cyber crime community.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a network of trust</p>
<p>in the prison crime community.</p>
<p>And trust.</p>
<p>Trust matters.</p>
<p>Trust drives everything at the end of the day.</p>
<p>The riots that I went through,</p>
<p>the first riot, man, you&rsquo;re scared to death.</p>
<p>Scared to death.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got the cops dressed up</p>
<p>in the Ninja Turtle outfits,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the rubber bullets,</p>
<p>the tear gas canisters, all that crap.</p>
<p>You got the inmates that are raising hell.</p>
<p>Scared to death.</p>
<p>The second riot, you calm down.</p>
<p>Second riot, you start to notice.</p>
<p>This is racial riot.</p>
<p>This is typically, and almost always,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Hispanics and African Americans.</p>
<p>So you get to detect what is the motivation</p>
<p>for the riot, what is the reason,</p>
<p>and that gives you some calm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So the second riot, you start to notice this.</p>
<p>Hey, man, this ain&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>This ain&rsquo;t our group.</p>
<p>Third riot, no shit.</p>
<p>Third riot, you lay in your bunk.</p>
<p>You let them wage war all around you,</p>
<p>and every now and then you have an inmate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll run up to you and he&rsquo;ll point to a locker</p>
<p>and say, is that your locker?</p>
<p>And if you tell him yes, they leave it alone.</p>
<p>If you say it&rsquo;s not my locker,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll break into it and steal everything out of it</p>
<p>and go from there, and that&rsquo;s what happens, but.</p>
<p>So you did your time for five years.</p>
<p>Five and a half.</p>
<p>You made it out.</p>
<p>Made it out.</p>
<p>I went through, I told you it was a good lie that I told.</p>
<p>I went through the residential drug abuse program.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nine month intensive therapy,</p>
<p>and the way I got to that, this counselor at Big Spring,</p>
<p>he bought this.</p>
<p>He wanted inmates to be educated.</p>
<p>He was a really good guy.</p>
<p>So he wanted inmates to be educated.</p>
<p>He got a discount on a game theory class set.</p>
<p>So he gets all these discs and everything,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s asking, does anybody on the compound</p>
<p>know anything about game theory?</p>
<p>And somebody says, if anybody does, it&rsquo;ll be Brett Johnson.</p>
<p>So he comes up to me one day at my buggy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, are you Brett Johnson?</p>
<p>I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>He was like, do you know anything about game theory?</p>
<p>And I was like, yes, I do.</p>
<p>So I start rattling off Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma</p>
<p>and everything else.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, well, you teach a class?</p>
<p>So I start teaching that.</p>
<p>I start teaching inmates public speaking</p>
<p>and to make friends with this counselor.</p>
<p>So it gets time where I&rsquo;m supposed to be transferring out</p>
<p>to this drug program that they only had in Fort Worth,</p>
<p>and the transfers are taking like four or five months.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s four or five months I could be out free.</p>
<p>So I went up to him one day and I was like, look,</p>
<p>his name was Keely.</p>
<p>I was like, look, man, I said, is there any way</p>
<p>that I can get transferred out any sooner?</p>
<p>And he looks at me and he&rsquo;s like, Brett, I cannot help you.</p>
<p>And I was like, I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for even trying.</p>
<p>So he said that a week later, I&rsquo;m on a bus</p>
<p>by going to Fort Worth.</p>
<p>So he got me to Fort Worth.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So it was a nine month program,</p>
<p>24 hours a day of cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>Had nothing to do with drugs.</p>
<p>It was all peer study stuff and CBT training.</p>
<p>And honestly, it&rsquo;s the best thing that could ever happen.</p>
<p>Truly is.</p>
<p>So that part, what was the thing that changed you as a man?</p>
<p>Is it the solitary confinement?</p>
<p>Was it the years?</p>
<p>Was it losing the people you loved?</p>
<p>Or was it that behavioral therapy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination.</p>
<p>It was, so my sister disowns me.</p>
<p>The only person I had in my life.</p>
<p>I mean, me and my sister, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, I loved Elizabeth.</p>
<p>I love my wife now, but it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Me and my sister, we went through all that shit together.</p>
<p>So Denise disowns me.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t talk to me for an entire year</p>
<p>when all this stuff happens.</p>
<p>And after I get arrested on the escape,</p>
<p>she ends up driving seven hours</p>
<p>to come see me to tell me she loves me.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see her again for five and a half years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really the first turnaround.</p>
<p>Took me two and a half years in prison</p>
<p>to accept responsibility.</p>
<p>That was amazing that she did that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She did that.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>Yeah, she saw me for 10 minutes,</p>
<p>tell me she loves me and then I don&rsquo;t see her again.</p>
<p>Planted the seed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>But yeah, you had time to think over those years.</p>
<p>Took two and a half years to realize</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t commit crime</p>
<p>because of stripper girlfriends or wives or family.</p>
<p>I committed it because I wanted to, chose to.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the first turnaround.</p>
<p>Second turnaround is the CBT training.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really hit while I was in prison.</p>
<p>I went through it and they ingrained it in you,</p>
<p>but until you choose to make it work, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So I got out in 2011, didn&rsquo;t wanna break the law, did not.</p>
<p>And I was under three years probation,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t touch a computer.</p>
<p>I had a job offer from Deloitte</p>
<p>to run a cyber crime office in the UK,</p>
<p>which that was a no.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re not moving and that&rsquo;s a computer idiot.</p>
<p>So then I had a job offer from Know Before,</p>
<p>a phishing company, couldn&rsquo;t take that.</p>
<p>I got to where I was trying to apply for fast food jobs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a computer, can&rsquo;t touch that.</p>
<p>Okay, then what about a waiter&rsquo;s position?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a computer and access to credit cards, idiot.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t touch that either.</p>
<p>So literally could not get a job, could not.</p>
<p>Doing food stamps, I had a roommate</p>
<p>that paid half the rent.</p>
<p>They tell you when you leave prison</p>
<p>to get a job in something you care about</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t recidivate, couldn&rsquo;t get a job.</p>
<p>And what I had was a cat, and Monster the Cat,</p>
<p>that was the cat&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>And I had enough money to feed that little guy</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t have money to buy toilet paper for the apartment.</p>
<p>So I was on Panama City Beach.</p>
<p>How long were you living like this?</p>
<p>It was a steady decline,</p>
<p>because remember I taught my dad how to commit tax fraud.</p>
<p>So he bankrolled a lot of that until he couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then from there, it&rsquo;s like, what the fuck do you do?</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t want to go into computer crime at all.</p>
<p>And I ended up shoplifting toilet paper, man.</p>
<p>Shoplifting toilet paper.</p>
<p>Just like for the basics, the basics of survival.</p>
<p>So about the same time I had a friend that, this guy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been dating the same type of women I had been dating,</p>
<p>you know, the unhealthy ones, the hot unhealthy ones.</p>
<p>Yes, love, that&rsquo;s how that works.</p>
<p>So I had a friend post an ad for me on Plenty of Fish.</p>
<p>And this woman responds, my wife, she responds.</p>
<p>And the pictures I had taken were these prison type pictures,</p>
<p>you know, the serious like, they were there.</p>
<p>She sends me a message of, why aren&rsquo;t you smiling?</p>
<p>And my response was, that is my happy face.</p>
<p>So we start talking and we started dating.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s that second saving thing, man.</p>
<p>I ended up moving in with her.</p>
<p>I was going broke.</p>
<p>I was about to get kicked out of the apartment and everything</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t say it, but I think she knew it.</p>
<p>And moved in with her.</p>
<p>And I got a job.</p>
<p>And the job I got, my probation officer</p>
<p>let me have a cell phone.</p>
<p>I was going through Craigslist.</p>
<p>This guy was advertising for landscaping.</p>
<p>Called him up.</p>
<p>His name was Dustin DeRamus.</p>
<p>Called him up.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, come on down, talk to me.</p>
<p>So he was running this business, him and his brother</p>
<p>were, out of his house.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sitting there talking to him for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>He looks at me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, are you on the run or something?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, no, why?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, you just don&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>like the kind of guy that do this.</p>
<p>So I told him.</p>
<p>I was like, this is who I am.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>And he looks at me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, man, I got to think about that.</p>
<p>So he tells me to go on home.</p>
<p>That was a Friday.</p>
<p>Sunday evening, he gives me a call.</p>
<p>And he was like, Brett, if I hire you, will you actually work?</p>
<p>And I told him, I was like, Dustin, if you give me a job,</p>
<p>I promise I&rsquo;ll work my ass off.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, show up 6 o clock.</p>
<p>I was like, all right.</p>
<p>So my job was to push a lawnmower 10 hours a day,</p>
<p>five days a week for $400 a week, and busted my ass.</p>
<p>I hit it so hard, I would come in of a night and pass out,</p>
<p>wake up the next morning, and hit it again.</p>
<p>And it got to the point, this dude</p>
<p>ended up offering me to come in and partner with his business.</p>
<p>His brother dropped out.</p>
<p>And by that point, I&rsquo;d learned everything</p>
<p>on the business and everything.</p>
<p>And he was like, if you&rsquo;d like to come in,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll cut you in half.</p>
<p>And I was like, Dustin, I can&rsquo;t do it, man.</p>
<p>Because I wasn&rsquo;t making any money.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to pay me anymore until he was able to do more.</p>
<p>And I thought I found another job doing something else.</p>
<p>And in a speech, I say it got cold and the grass</p>
<p>started to stop growing.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter was I thought I found another job.</p>
<p>Guy was offering to pay me $1,500 a week doing the sales</p>
<p>for oil rig training, was what it was.</p>
<p>And I accepted the job.</p>
<p>I quit working for Dustin.</p>
<p>And the guy, I told him before he even offered me a job,</p>
<p>I told him my criminal history because I</p>
<p>was required to do that.</p>
<p>So I was supposed to start work.</p>
<p>Well, he calls me and tells me he can&rsquo;t hire me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m out of work.</p>
<p>And Dustin&rsquo;s already hired somebody else by that point,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t go back with him.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m that guy again, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for me to show value in a relationship.</p>
<p>So Michelle was the only one working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I got to do something.</p>
<p>And I get it in my head.</p>
<p>I was like, if nothing else, I can just</p>
<p>bring food in the house.</p>
<p>She was only making, I think she was, I mean,</p>
<p>we had it hard, it was just her working.</p>
<p>And I was like, if nothing else, I can bring food in the house</p>
<p>and get on the dark web, get some stolen credit cards,</p>
<p>start ordering food.</p>
<p>Well, it gets worse than that.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got two sons there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, well, they need clothes.</p>
<p>So they start stealing clothes.</p>
<p>And it continues like that.</p>
<p>I get arrested.</p>
<p>I get arrested on a food order.</p>
<p>And Michelle didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing.</p>
<p>So she had been to work, and she was coming back from work.</p>
<p>I get arrested.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, they let me make a phone call.</p>
<p>And I call her, and I say, come to the police station.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been arrested.</p>
<p>And she shows up.</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;d been doing that.</p>
<p>My probation officer, of course, he didn&rsquo;t know anything else.</p>
<p>At my sentencing for that, probation officer</p>
<p>was there, prosecutor, the judge, US Marshals, Michelle,</p>
<p>and me.</p>
<p>Michelle stands up, and she tells the judge</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m a better dad to her kids</p>
<p>than their actual father is.</p>
<p>And by that point, I&rsquo;m crying.</p>
<p>Probation officer stands up.</p>
<p>And he was like, we think Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s a good guy.</p>
<p>We think this is a one time thing.</p>
<p>Prosecutor says the same thing.</p>
<p>Judge sentences me to one year.</p>
<p>Probation officer stands back up.</p>
<p>And he was like, Mr. Johnson, Judge,</p>
<p>if you can give Mr. Johnson a year and a day,</p>
<p>he can get the good time and get back to his family sooner.</p>
<p>So the judge amends the sentence to a year and a day.</p>
<p>So I served 10 months.</p>
<p>They sent me back to Texas.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I find out that Michelle didn&rsquo;t need me</p>
<p>for what I could give her.</p>
<p>She just wanted me for me that entire time.</p>
<p>She stands by me the entire time.</p>
<p>I do my 10 months, get out.</p>
<p>We get married after that.</p>
<p>And they kill probation.</p>
<p>So I can touch a computer.</p>
<p>They tell you, they were like, you know,</p>
<p>inmates, a felon, if nothing else, he can sell cars.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You can sell cars if you&rsquo;re a drug dealer.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the guy that steals all the money and people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>information, no, fuck no.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get a job selling cars.</p>
<p>So can&rsquo;t get a job.</p>
<p>Cannot.</p>
<p>And to this day, Lex, I know what my triggers are.</p>
<p>I know what it would take to get me back</p>
<p>into committing crime.</p>
<p>So, and I knew I&rsquo;d go so far at that point.</p>
<p>So I looked at Michelle and I was like,</p>
<p>let me see what I can do.</p>
<p>Signed on to LinkedIn, reached out to this FBI super cop</p>
<p>named Keith Malarski out of the Pittsburgh office.</p>
<p>He was involved with my arrest and some associates</p>
<p>and everything else and sent him a message.</p>
<p>And the message was, you know,</p>
<p>hey, I respect everything you did.</p>
<p>Think you did a great job.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;d like to be legal.</p>
<p>And dude responded within two hours.</p>
<p>Two hours, he gives me references, advice,</p>
<p>takes me in under his wing, everything else like that.</p>
<p>And from that point, man, it was the head</p>
<p>of the identity theft council did the same thing.</p>
<p>Card not present group hires me to speak.</p>
<p>Microsoft hires me to consult with them.</p>
<p>And the Microsoft hire established enough trust</p>
<p>in the industry that I was all right from that point.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re helping in many ways,</p>
<p>fight the very guy that you used to be.</p>
<p>So big picture advice.</p>
<p>What, given that you were that guy,</p>
<p>how do we fight cyber crime today</p>
<p>and in the next five years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years?</p>
<p>What advice do you have to individuals, to companies,</p>
<p>to governments of what, and also to Elizabeth,</p>
<p>like the humans, human beings that love,</p>
<p>that live, that are friends with cyber criminals?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many lessons to really be had from that.</p>
<p>To me, the lesson, one of the big lessons to me</p>
<p>is you can&rsquo;t serve two masters.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re that guy that is committing crime</p>
<p>or that person that&rsquo;s addicted,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in love with somebody that&rsquo;s addicted or has that,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t love you.</p>
<p>They love that addiction that comes first.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always gonna come first.</p>
<p>So you have to realize that.</p>
<p>You have to know when to cut somebody off,</p>
<p>when to end something, that knowing</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not gonna change until they decide to change.</p>
<p>At the same time, you gotta realize</p>
<p>that the only reason I was able to turn my life around</p>
<p>is because people took that chance on me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the only reason.</p>
<p>They believe that there&rsquo;s a good person in there.</p>
<p>Yeah, if Malarski hadn&rsquo;t responded,</p>
<p>if I hadn&rsquo;t had my sister, my wife,</p>
<p>these companies that initially gave me that chance,</p>
<p>my ass would be back in prison for 20 years.</p>
<p>I have no doubt about that at all, all right?</p>
<p>So you have to realize that.</p>
<p>Cybercrime, a lot of companies that I talk to,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really understand or appreciate</p>
<p>that networking aspect, that trust aspect</p>
<p>of how criminals establish trust with each other,</p>
<p>how they work together.</p>
<p>A lot of companies think that it&rsquo;s a single player</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s out victimizing them.</p>
<p>And when you really break down how cybercrime operates,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got a group of individuals</p>
<p>that are working together to hit you,</p>
<p>but not only hit you,</p>
<p>but they share and exchange information freely.</p>
<p>Companies don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got privacy concerns,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got competitive edge concerns, everything else.</p>
<p>Companies don&rsquo;t share information across the board</p>
<p>like criminals do.</p>
<p>Criminals do that.</p>
<p>You have to appreciate that.</p>
<p>You have to understand that big statistic</p>
<p>that 90% of your tax use known exploits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the stuff we don&rsquo;t know about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the shit we do know about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not doing anything about.</p>
<p>So the way to defend against cybercrime</p>
<p>is like there&rsquo;s a lot of low hanging fruit</p>
<p>that you should fix.</p>
<p>A lot of that.</p>
<p>Sort of a lot of basic stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already vulnerabilities,</p>
<p>update the system security.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t take care of SolarWinds or CNAP</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But those instances, I mean, okay, that&rsquo;s a big instance.</p>
<p>I mean, it is.</p>
<p>But in the full spectrum of, especially in the future,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s more and more companies</p>
<p>that are coming online, they&rsquo;re becoming digital.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just more and more and more.</p>
<p>And those vulnerabilities in terms of human nature,</p>
<p>so for social engineering and the actual outdated systems,</p>
<p>all of it.</p>
<p>Some of it, I guess is, I mean, you&rsquo;re exceptionally good</p>
<p>at this is educating on the social engineering side,</p>
<p>is educating people in companies that like.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to do that.</p>
<p>And companies have to, you know, I made that point</p>
<p>that they never report to law enforcement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s companies and individuals.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve worked with Fortune 50 companies</p>
<p>that will not press charges.</p>
<p>Instead, they&rsquo;ll have that insider or that criminal</p>
<p>sign an NDA, they&rsquo;ll pay them off.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t mention this shit anymore.</p>
<p>You have to be, you have to press charges.</p>
<p>You have to report, you have to raise the awareness</p>
<p>of everyone in the group.</p>
<p>You have to be, it&rsquo;s that idea.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about that before</p>
<p>of understanding your place in that cyber crime spectrum.</p>
<p>The way a criminal will victimize you</p>
<p>depends on who you are and what you do</p>
<p>as a person and as a business.</p>
<p>So you have to understand that, design security around that.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve got 7,500 security companies out there.</p>
<p>A whole lot of them are snake oil salesmen.</p>
<p>A lot of them is going to tell you that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the one stop solution, but you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a tool, all right?</p>
<p>And you may have a very good tool,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the only tool that&rsquo;s needed</p>
<p>to protect against the attacks that are out there.</p>
<p>And we have to be open and honest</p>
<p>about that kind of stuff if we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So I guess defending defense is not just like one tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a process of just like a diversity</p>
<p>and just constantly educating people.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the social side, it&rsquo;s constantly,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many probably attack vectors</p>
<p>in terms of the software that you have.</p>
<p>If you look at it, that attack surface,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t plug everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too damn large to plug everything.</p>
<p>But you can do the best job you can possibly do,</p>
<p>but it takes a variety of tools to do that, all right?</p>
<p>The idea, and Arcos is big about that,</p>
<p>but the idea is to take the cost of fraud</p>
<p>to the fraudster so high that they basically</p>
<p>try to pick another target, all right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the idea that you want.</p>
<p>You want it to be not worth the criminal&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>to hit your company.</p>
<p>What about white hat hacking?</p>
<p>So like hacking for good,</p>
<p>sort of testing systems and then giving companies</p>
<p>the vulnerabilities as you find them?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s outstanding.</p>
<p>I do, I think that, I think pen testing,</p>
<p>white hat stuff is outstanding.</p>
<p>I truly do.</p>
<p>I think that you have to.</p>
<p>It has to be tempered with what is reality as well though.</p>
<p>All right, we&rsquo;ve got a whole industry of people</p>
<p>who try to sell RFID wallets,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know of many RFID hackers out there</p>
<p>on the criminal side, to be honest with you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so some of it is just like a psychological</p>
<p>safety blanket that&rsquo;s not actually providing any protection.</p>
<p>By the way, you wrote on LinkedIn something about ID me.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Why is it a problem?</p>
<p>I was going down a rabbit hole with you.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you were gonna mention that.</p>
<p>You know, they lost, I guess I was partially responsible</p>
<p>for them losing an $86 million contract.</p>
<p>What was the contract with the government?</p>
<p>With the IRS.</p>
<p>Just with the IRS.</p>
<p>So what is it?</p>
<p>So ID me is an identity, okay, backtrack.</p>
<p>ID me is a marketing company that wants to say</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re an identity verification company.</p>
<p>I just wanna bring this up to see you get angry.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what my issue is.</p>
<p>My issue is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a company that&rsquo;s used for authentication</p>
<p>by the IRS, I guess.</p>
<p>IRS, Social Security Administration, VA,</p>
<p>at 1.23 state unemployment offices, few other services.</p>
<p>So I guess the idea is that you would be able</p>
<p>to unlock your account or authenticate yourself</p>
<p>as a human being by using your face or something like that.</p>
<p>Or private information.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a tiered system with verification.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got, you can do, they&rsquo;ve got a free system</p>
<p>which is questionable where you submit an ID</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been shown, several bypasses have been shown.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna talk about their security horribly bad</p>
<p>because I wanna be honest, there are bypasses</p>
<p>for a lot of security systems out there.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>The issue that I have with ID me is that</p>
<p>their policies are somewhat questionable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re a private company</p>
<p>that has those policies in place.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re a government agency</p>
<p>and you as a citizen are entitled to a benefit</p>
<p>or a service of that government agency,</p>
<p>and then the government agency forces you</p>
<p>to give up your complete identity profile</p>
<p>to a private company.</p>
<p>And then that private company uses that profile</p>
<p>for marketing purposes, to further profit, things like that.</p>
<p>I have a huge issue with that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re a private company that does that.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think that citizens need to be forced</p>
<p>into doing that in order to get a benefit</p>
<p>or service that they&rsquo;re entitled to.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my big issue.</p>
<p>So that, I mean, given how much value,</p>
<p>how much we talked about the value of identity,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think that should be handed over lightly?</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>And who would have thought that Brett Johnson</p>
<p>would ever become a privacy advocate?</p>
<p>But here I am.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>or appreciate the value of who they are.</p>
<p>And certainly you&rsquo;ve got a host of companies,</p>
<p>ID means not the only one,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve got some of these companies that say,</p>
<p>well, we strip out the PII of the individual.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just using the biometrics</p>
<p>and the sites they&rsquo;re visiting and things like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>You can still ping that one unique individual</p>
<p>out of all, using that information.</p>
<p>Stripping out the PII,</p>
<p>you can still ping who that individual is.</p>
<p>So having lived a life of crime for many years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve connected indirectly</p>
<p>to a large number of very dangerous people.</p>
<p>Directly and directly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the network indirectly is even larger, right?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, oh yeah.</p>
<p>Are you, and I apologize for this question,</p>
<p>are you ever worried for your life, for your wellbeing?</p>
<p>Like having seen a world that&rsquo;s really dangerous</p>
<p>in ways that&rsquo;s not, that operates in the shadows.</p>
<p>Like I said, when we started Shadow Crew</p>
<p>and started that initial cybercrime business, that world,</p>
<p>violence wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>It came in later.</p>
<p>Now violence is inherent in the system,</p>
<p>to do the Monty Python bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the mob, the mafia are now part of this whole thing.</p>
<p>Cartels are part of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Drugs are inherently intertwined in cybercrime marketplaces</p>
<p>because of the profit potential.</p>
<p>And with that comes a lot of violence as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, the cartels already brought the violence</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re good at from the 20th century.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>Into the technology of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Now, do I worry about that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that my family worries about that.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I think I may be just too involved in it</p>
<p>to appreciate that type of danger.</p>
<p>But my family worries about that.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>Do I think it&rsquo;s a possibility?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the guy that says what needs to be said.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve built my trust in this industry</p>
<p>by not being scared of calling out companies and individuals</p>
<p>and not being scared of targeting criminals</p>
<p>or criminal groups.</p>
<p>Your honesty as a human being emotionally</p>
<p>and intellectually is really refreshing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gift and thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing that.</p>
<p>Is there a device you can give to young people today</p>
<p>about life?</p>
<p>You broke many rules, all the rules.</p>
<p>Some rules should be broken.</p>
<p>So if you look at somebody young today</p>
<p>in high school and college,</p>
<p>thinking how they can break the rules legally</p>
<p>and live a life that&rsquo;s something they could be really proud</p>
<p>of, what would you say?</p>
<p>Biggest lesson I&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>You want your life to be one where you&rsquo;re helping people</p>
<p>and not hurting people.</p>
<p>And that really hit me the first time I walked into Quantico.</p>
<p>You see the brightest minds in the United States</p>
<p>who give up a lot of money,</p>
<p>the opportunities of a lot of money</p>
<p>because they believe in helping people.</p>
<p>Where I spent a career just hurting and harming individuals,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a hell of a lesson.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m there,</p>
<p>but I would tell people out there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine to want money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine to test systems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine to circumvent the rules</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not breaking the law.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine to do all that.</p>
<p>I like doing that, all right?</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve got the mindset,</p>
<p>if you can just adhere to the mindset of helping people</p>
<p>and not hurting people,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll be all right at the end of the day.</p>
<p>What gives you, again, given the dark web,</p>
<p>given all the dangers out there,</p>
<p>what gives you hope about the future,</p>
<p>looking into five, 10 years, 50 years?</p>
<p>I mean, hope for human civilization.</p>
<p>If we do all right, if we make it out of this century,</p>
<p>what do you think would be the reason?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a damn good question.</p>
<p>Because I mean, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of bad stuff going on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>If I asked you the other question of</p>
<p>how do you think human civilization would destroy itself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you have a lot of answers.</p>
<p>You know what gives me hope is</p>
<p>that you see people working together.</p>
<p>The COVIDs have been a little bit different</p>
<p>because I think too many people</p>
<p>wanted to play politics with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been the heartbreaking thing about COVID</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s in many ways pulled people apart.</p>
<p>I mean, because a virus involves</p>
<p>kind of being afraid of each other</p>
<p>because I mean, that was a scary thing.</p>
<p>People talk about pandemics in that way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re afraid of other humans.</p>
<p>That is the most terrifying thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the destructive nature of what it does to your body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that it pulls people apart.</p>
<p>And then you realize how fundamental</p>
<p>that human connection is to human civilization.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>But you know, as human beings,</p>
<p>we do, when things really get bad,</p>
<p>when things really get bad,</p>
<p>we do tend to respond and group together.</p>
<p>We do that.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s injustice, we see it, we rise up.</p>
<p>I wake up every morning and I watch Fox News and CNN</p>
<p>so I can be pissed off at everyone.</p>
<p>All right, so the division, the outrage,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really feeding.</p>
<p>They want you, they want you to be angry.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what causes me to spare</p>
<p>and what I think that, you know, we just need to.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was very good.</p>
<p>She taught me one hell of a lesson</p>
<p>because before I met her, I was a news hound.</p>
<p>News would be on all the time.</p>
<p>A couple of channels of it.</p>
<p>And she was the woman who didn&rsquo;t watch the news at all.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t understand that back then, man.</p>
<p>But now I do.</p>
<p>You know, now I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s pretty smart, you know?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t need to listen to that bullshit as it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love reading history books.</p>
<p>I just, I feel like that&rsquo;s the right perspective</p>
<p>on take on modern times.</p>
<p>You know, how will this time be written about</p>
<p>in the history books and react to that?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t the daily ups and downs of the outrages,</p>
<p>which is getting worse and worse</p>
<p>in terms of how quick the turnaround is</p>
<p>in terms of the news.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what, I&rsquo;m sitting here.</p>
<p>I appreciate you talking to me.</p>
<p>I do, because, you know, I talk about that relationship</p>
<p>and everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really been this kind of realization</p>
<p>for me on a lot of things.</p>
<p>So I really appreciate you asking those questions</p>
<p>and everything, maybe be able to talk about that.</p>
<p>I love it that you value, first of all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re self aware how important love</p>
<p>is in a human being&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>It can make you do some of the best</p>
<p>and some of the worst things in this world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s good to think about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to think about that.</p>
<p>That is what makes us human, is that connection</p>
<p>and that love for each other.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>This big, ridiculous question.</p>
<p>Why the hell, what are we all here for?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is ridiculous, man.</p>
<p>To me, that meaning of life is finding out</p>
<p>that lesson that we need to help each other.</p>
<p>If you talk, you ask about security,</p>
<p>how do you get to say that?</p>
<p>But, you know, everybody&rsquo;s worried about themselves.</p>
<p>The way you solve that security problem</p>
<p>is it takes everybody looking out for everyone else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you solve that problem.</p>
<p>And however you take, whatever journey you take</p>
<p>to discovering that point.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, with me, I&rsquo;ve been asked a few times,</p>
<p>do you regret anything?</p>
<p>Would you change anything?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a shitload of despicable things in my life.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m at a point in my life where I like who I am.</p>
<p>And I know that I am doing exactly</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m supposed to be doing with my life.</p>
<p>So, would I change anything?</p>
<p>As bad as a lot of that shit has been, I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It made you who you are.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The whole of it, the whole mess.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s trite to say that, but it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the weird thing, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Also, you mentioned that you&rsquo;re thinking of launching a show.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it gonna be called?</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;ve done a couple of podcasts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re incredibly good at this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so good at this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a lot of podcasts and everything like that.</p>
<p>I had the fraud cast with a friend of mine,</p>
<p>Carice Hendrick.</p>
<p>And that ended because of a difference of opinion.</p>
<p>Depending on who you ask, one of us was an asshole.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it may have been me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But then I did the Anglerfish podcast,</p>
<p>which that was, I gotta be honest with you, Lex,</p>
<p>it was completely directionless.</p>
<p>And it was Brett Johnson getting lazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I ended that.</p>
<p>The Brett Johnson show is launching.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the new one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the new one&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>And, you know, I.</p>
<p>What do you think I&rsquo;m doing with it?</p>
<p>Making a difference, for one thing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s gonna be talking about cyber crime security,</p>
<p>helping people.</p>
<p>Interviews.</p>
<p>A lot of it&rsquo;s gonna be solo.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m calling it the Brett Johnson show.</p>
<p>I mean, because it&rsquo;s gonna handle crime,</p>
<p>talk to criminals and how they turn their lives around</p>
<p>to a degree as well.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some shit I wanna bitch about too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So figure it out.</p>
<p>I can tell you&rsquo;re good at this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan already.</p>
<p>I wanna listen.</p>
<p>I wanna subscribe.</p>
<p>You should too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re launching it soon.</p>
<p>Soon.</p>
<p>Next week.</p>
<p>Brett, you&rsquo;re an incredible human being.</p>
<p>The honesty, the love.</p>
<p>I could just see how much of yourself you put out there.</p>
<p>One of the best public speakers I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>Definitely you should be in a Scorsese film</p>
<p>about cyber crime.</p>
<p>100%, I could tell you&rsquo;re a good actor.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, I really, I&rsquo;m deeply honored</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll spend your time with me today.</p>
<p>I am, actually.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Brett Johnson.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from George R.R. Martin, from A Clash of Kings.</p>
<p>A good act does not wash out the bad,</p>
<p>nor a bad act the good.</p>
<p>Each should have its own reward.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
