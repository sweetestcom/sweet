    <p>0:13</p>
<p>Picture.</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>We open on a white Rolls Royce zipping down, a Beverly Hill Street on a hot afternoon.</p>
<p>Behind the wheel is a woman platinum, blond, and Oh, So Glamorous, but before long the fuzz show up a cop on a motorcycle signals to the woman to pull over.</p>
<p>0:40</p>
<p>He asks, if she knows her tags are expired and to see her license.</p>
<p>The officer asks her to step out of her car for almost an hour.</p>
<p>The impeccably dressed woman Waits on the pavement for the officer to run her tags.</p>
<p>0:56</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s baking and the hot California Sun.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>She asks if she can leave and the officer tells her fuck off.</p>
<p>And so she does.</p>
<p>She speeds off down Olympic Boulevard.</p>
<p>1:14</p>
<p>The officer hot on her tail.</p>
<p>They race two blocks down before she&rsquo;s pulled over again.</p>
<p>He tries to drag her out of her car.</p>
<p>They struggle for a few moments and then a slap, our heroine cuts the officer clean across the face and moments later.</p>
<p>1:34</p>
<p>He slapping handcuffs on her wrists.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not going to get away with it though.</p>
<p>She thought she would after all, she&rsquo;s famous actress and socialite, Zsa, Gabor, and this isn&rsquo;t a movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a story compiled from actual witness testimony.</p>
<p>1:51</p>
<p>The cop stopped you because she had a plate that had expired.</p>
<p>I slept him to get loose.</p>
<p>It was self-defense.</p>
<p>From gimlet media.</p>
<p>This is not passed it a show about the stories.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t quite leave behind every episode.</p>
<p>2:06</p>
<p>We take a moment from that very same week in history and tell you the story of how it shaped our world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Simone palana in Zsa.</p>
<p>Zsa Gabor the Hungarian American socialite and Hollywood star went on trial for slapping that cop on September 14th, 1989 32 years ago this week.</p>
<p>2:27</p>
<p>Oh Arguments began and Zsa stepped into the role.</p>
<p>She was born to play herself this week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re bringing you the True Hollywood drama of an aging.</p>
<p>Star who used her questionable Behavior to resurrect a Stalin career and set the stage for Celebrity Crime as public theater.</p>
<p>2:50</p>
<p>So all rise, the people versus Zsa Gabor begins after the break I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.</p>
<p>3:06</p>
<p>Zsa.</p>
<p>Zsa.</p>
<p>Gabor hasn&rsquo;t had this much air time since she held down the center spot on Hollywood Squares, but this is not your everyday TV.</p>
<p>Show.</p>
<p>What this is, is American Justice on display.</p>
<p>The former Miss hungry on the morning of September 11th. 1989 Hungarian American actress.</p>
<p>3:26</p>
<p>Zsa, Zsa, Gabor stepped out of a Chevrolet station, wagon.</p>
<p>And headed towards a Beverly Hills courthouse.</p>
<p>Breezing through a throng of reporters and photographers her platinum, blond locks, were pinned into a gravity-defying updo.</p>
<p>3:45</p>
<p>She were oversized black sunglasses with her designer dress.</p>
<p>This first day of the trial.</p>
<p>A simple yet business.</p>
<p>Like, Donna, Karan dress accentuates.</p>
<p>The black with a red silk corsage.</p>
<p>A is confident jovial, to say the least, telling reporters that she doesn&rsquo;t need the flood of publicity that has been generated since the arrest.</p>
<p>4:05</p>
<p>This is an unworried woman.</p>
<p>Joshua had been arrested three months prior for assaulting Beverly Hills police officer, Paul Kramer.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the only charge Zhao was also accused of disobeying.</p>
<p>4:22</p>
<p>A police officers orders driving with expired tags and an expired license, and having an open bottle of liquor in her car.</p>
<p>The media had been documenting her every move since then threw her indictment to jury selection.</p>
<p>Judge.</p>
<p>Do you think they can Find 12 people who can judge you standing next to her as she faced down.</p>
<p>4:46</p>
<p>The cameras was her Entourage, her attorney, William Grayson various supporters.</p>
<p>Daughter, Francesca Hilton, husband Prince Frederick of Germany and her hairdresser.</p>
<p>So an aging movie star, a European Prince, a Hilton heiress and a hairdresser.</p>
<p>5:02</p>
<p>Walk into a courtroom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no punch line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a fact.</p>
<p>This obviously wasn&rsquo;t going to be a normal trial.</p>
<p>It felt melodramatic.</p>
<p>It felt very Zsa.</p>
<p>Zsa.</p>
<p>Joshua was from day one.</p>
<p>5:24</p>
<p>Always about self-promotion.</p>
<p>So, you know, being discreet wasn&rsquo;t part of her nature.</p>
<p>This is Steven Silverman at the time of Jesus trial.</p>
<p>He just finished a decade, long run, as a correspondent for the New York Post.</p>
<p>Jacques had been a staple of his gossip column.</p>
<p>5:42</p>
<p>One of the main characters you might say, I mean she would talk about her marriages and her divorce is on television.</p>
<p>She took no prisoners and it was all about herself.</p>
<p>So sure she would never run from a camera or a microphone, you know.</p>
<p>They were her best friends.</p>
<p>6:03</p>
<p>From a young age, it seemed Zsa was destined for fame.</p>
<p>She was born into a wealthy, Jewish Hungarian family, the middle child to her sisters, Magda and Ava, their mother, a jewelry Eris encouraged her daughter&rsquo;s to climb the social ladder, even higher.</p>
<p>6:18</p>
<p>Josh.</p>
<p>I went back to an old sort of tradition of a courtesan and the mother trained all three women to make themselves attractive to rich men.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the stuff of which French novels were written, Joshua, married.</p>
<p>6:38</p>
<p>The first of her, nine husband&rsquo;s a Turkish Diplomat when she was still a teenager ill in 1936.</p>
<p>She competed for Miss Hungary and a few years later in 1941.</p>
<p>Shahji, and her sisters immigrated to the United States.</p>
<p>6:55</p>
<p>They brought their Glamour and their beauty with them and immediately sought out the Not light, Joshua headed for Hollywood.</p>
<p>Where she launched a film career.</p>
<p>She appeared in over a dozen films, mostly in the 1940s and 50s.</p>
<p>Most notably Orson, welles&rsquo;s Touch of Evil and John Huston&rsquo;s Moulin Rouge and an exciting supporting role is gorgeous.</p>
<p>7:17</p>
<p>Zsa Gabor as the grammar.</p>
<p>Is Jean available of the Moulin Rouge.</p>
<p>But at the time, what really made her famous where her appearances on the talk show circuit where she was charming over-the-top and told wild stories about her fabulous life like she did on this appearance from The Tonight Show back in the 60s.</p>
<p>7:39</p>
<p>Got here was just starting to tell us about the recent.</p>
<p>Hold up.</p>
<p>He holds a gun at mazes GitHub.</p>
<p>This is a holdup.</p>
<p>I just come back later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sleepy.</p>
<p>And she was reliably entertaining as the center square on Hollywood Squares, which of the following places consumes the most Cheez Whiz is a cheese.</p>
<p>8:02</p>
<p>Mr. But by the 80s Gabor star was fading that is until her arrest in 1989.</p>
<p>I heard about it on the news actually, before I got the case.</p>
<p>8:18</p>
<p>And just another in my respectful opinion silly celebrity piece of news that you listen to and are somewhat entertained by that&rsquo;s Judge, Charles Reuben.</p>
<p>He presided over the 1989 trial, he&rsquo;s retired now, but he&rsquo;d been a judge in Beverly Hills for a while.</p>
<p>8:35</p>
<p>By the time the Gabor case landed on his docket.</p>
<p>He thought he knew what he was in for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a whole number of celebrities come through the court for various reasons, and so it, Didn&rsquo;t anyway impressed me.</p>
<p>I was somewhat amused.</p>
<p>8:53</p>
<p>I thought that this is going to be just a routine case in a case.</p>
<p>Like this judge Rubin says that most celebrities would have just opted to get it all over with quickly and quietly.</p>
<p>What would normally be a plea agreement, which she could have gotten very easily or a very short trial.</p>
<p>9:13</p>
<p>Maybe 2-3 days.</p>
<p>It turned into a two-week debacle.</p>
<p>For those two weeks, the scene around the Beverly Hills courthouse, looked more like a red carpet event.</p>
<p>When I would come to the courthouse, there would be those vans of Television trucks with their telescoping antenna.</p>
<p>9:39</p>
<p>I stuck up in the air and with their monitors inside the truck, a number of people in there, getting ready to broadcast the proceedings, there would be crowds of people outside having to keep behind it.</p>
<p>It and it was just a circus.</p>
<p>Zsa Zsa, it wasn&rsquo;t a circus.</p>
<p>10:02</p>
<p>It was the stage setting for the role of a lifetime.</p>
<p>She sort of felt that life was like the movies of that genre from the 40s and 50s, you know, where they heroin slaps, the hero and then faints on to the sofa that you could script whatever you want, and you act the script and it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>10:20</p>
<p>So she scripted this trial in her own mind, Jean show, officially began when Court was called to Her on September 14th for opening statements may be seated and come to order.</p>
<p>Court is now in session with The Honorable Charles, you Reuben.</p>
<p>10:36</p>
<p>Judge presiding the Beverly Hills district attorney&rsquo;s office prosecuted, the case, the da, brought the man who was slapped officer Paul Kramer to court with them.</p>
<p>He, of course, arrived dressed in his full police uniform.</p>
<p>They laid out a straightforward case, GE assaulted an officer plain and simple.</p>
<p>10:57</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deputy district attorney in his opening.</p>
<p>Ting statements and as the evidence will show in this case and one motion with a right hand around and slapped him across side of the face, bending his sunglasses, the impact turning his head officer Cramer on the defense was Zsa and her lawyer, William Grayson.</p>
<p>11:19</p>
<p>He actually admitted in his own opening statement that his client did indeed slap the police officer.</p>
<p>He insisted.</p>
<p>It was self-defense though that officer Kramer was Excessively violent, when he pulled Jean out of the car, that&rsquo;s why she slapped him.</p>
<p>11:35</p>
<p>The trial proceeded with Witnesses called on both sides.</p>
<p>But, let&rsquo;s be real.</p>
<p>Everybody was here for Jacques testimony.</p>
<p>This court.</p>
<p>If you want to take a drink or something, I meant to drink water.</p>
<p>Jean told her version of the story.</p>
<p>11:57</p>
<p>The officer had been violent with her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little tough to hear this next clip.</p>
<p>But Jesus says, he put his hand inside of the window.</p>
<p>12:18</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll break your quote effing arm and your leg she says and remember how Jesus fled the scene?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>May I please go on his head.</p>
<p>F up that was just a misunderstanding over the definition of fuck off.</p>
<p>12:34</p>
<p>She thought that meant she was free to go.</p>
<p>So, when you told him, when you asked to may, I go?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>He said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you know what?</p>
<p>I know what that means, talk to me, like, him in my life.</p>
<p>12:50</p>
<p>She was also one to make.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call them outlandish statements.</p>
<p>She said that officer Kramer scared, her more than the Nazi invasion of Hungary.</p>
<p>She even described Kramer as Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin all in one.</p>
<p>13:08</p>
<p>And finally, there was the climactic face off.</p>
<p>When Jacques lawyer asked the five foot five actress to stand beside the six-foot-four Kramer and reenact the slap.</p>
<p>Where can you stand facing officer Kramer?</p>
<p>I am afraid of this man.</p>
<p>13:27</p>
<p>I know you but the confrontation inside the courtroom wasn&rsquo;t enough outside.</p>
<p>She To keep the drama going for the hordes of reporters who gathered to cover the trial standing next to him.</p>
<p>13:52</p>
<p>Did you catch that?</p>
<p>Joshua?</p>
<p>Says it was petrifying to me that you&rsquo;re happy with the line, the way it&rsquo;s going today.</p>
<p>I am the biggest lie on the police department.</p>
<p>14:11</p>
<p>Slide is on the road and judge Rubin says, it wasn&rsquo;t just reporters.</p>
<p>The Jesus stands were out in force.</p>
<p>It would be demonstrators or placards.</p>
<p>One of the ones that I remember the called Jaja, a Hungarian, freedom, fighter, and accused me of attacking a Hungarian, freedom fighter and they were even Hawking t-shirts, outside.</p>
<p>14:35</p>
<p>Some with the words free, Zsa, Zsa and some with hang Zsa, Zsa.</p>
<p>And New York Post correspondent Stephen Silverman.</p>
<p>Says the folks watching at home couldn&rsquo;t get enough.</p>
<p>14:52</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t online yet, but we would you know, usually pick up the phone and call it our best friend&rsquo;s a quick turn on channel, whatever and we would watch it together.</p>
<p>It was a running commentary, the general tone was sarcastic.</p>
<p>15:09</p>
<p>Like can you believe this is going on?</p>
<p>And the taxpayers are paying for this as the Jesus showed neared, its end, the jury began deliberation.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t touch that dial.</p>
<p>The Jean verdict is about to roll in after the break.</p>
<p>15:39</p>
<p>Welcome back before the break.</p>
<p>We brought you inside the trial of the people versus Zsa.</p>
<p>Zsa Gabor over two weeks.</p>
<p>Both sides had presented, their cases, with cameras, following at all.</p>
<p>And now, GE and the rest of the world waited as the 12.</p>
<p>15:56</p>
<p>Jurors deliberated after 14 hours.</p>
<p>The verdict was in Zsa.</p>
<p>Zsa, Gabor known mostly for being known guilty of slapping, a Beverly Hills policeman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re driving with an expired license, guilty of driving with an open container of an alcoholic beverage.</p>
<p>16:14</p>
<p>That was the verdict of a Beverly Hills jury late today and a trial that played out like a television sitcom guilty on three of four charges.</p>
<p>She was acquitted on one count, not guilty of disobeying an officer by driving away from the scene.</p>
<p>16:31</p>
<p>Guess that argument about what fuck off means really landed with the jury during the sentencing hearing a few weeks later judge.</p>
<p>Ruben, did not mince words as to how he felt about the case, Miss Gabor.</p>
<p>In this case.</p>
<p>Not only slapped the face of Officer cream right there on Olympic Boulevard.</p>
<p>16:48</p>
<p>She turned around and slap the face of every American by claiming that the United States is worse than communist.</p>
<p>Russia or Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Judge Rubin told me that Zsa Zsa didn&rsquo;t exactly take her sentence.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>She did have to stay in a jail cell at night.</p>
<p>17:05</p>
<p>I made her do maybe a hundred and twenty hours community service.</p>
<p>Which she violated?</p>
<p>Gabor served her time, three days in jail, but a Steven Silverman from the New York Post told me, she wasn&rsquo;t done milking her criminal drama for the cameras.</p>
<p>17:23</p>
<p>She want to serve her time in jail.</p>
<p>She refused to do her community service.</p>
<p>What is Yasha?</p>
<p>Do she goes on to her?</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense in the celebrity world.</p>
<p>She got a major book deal out of it and the book, you know, got attention.</p>
<p>17:40</p>
<p>And I read some of the reviews of the book last night and they were again generous, but they it&rsquo;s just said how funny it was.</p>
<p>Why the book now Zhao, why now?</p>
<p>An autobiography?</p>
<p>17:56</p>
<p>Because darling, I had to write it at all.</p>
<p>If I should tell my side of my story of my life.</p>
<p>So many nonsense was said and written about me.</p>
<p>So they should really know who I am Raja.</p>
<p>Last time.</p>
<p>We talked, you&rsquo;d been sentenced to prison for three days by slapping a cop.</p>
<p>18:12</p>
<p>Did you actually go to prison?</p>
<p>I was 3 days in prison.</p>
<p>I tell you, I don&rsquo;t advise anyone to go to prison.</p>
<p>I would say everybody talks badly about my would be the richest woman in the world.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I might always someone.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>No, no, I did a joke when you slapped a cop but I mean that&rsquo;s my job.</p>
<p>18:29</p>
<p>The judge said that I have to make a psychiatrist psychotic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to say it in English.</p>
<p>They have to check up if I&rsquo;m normal or insane.</p>
<p>18:49</p>
<p>It was in a way the best movie she ever made.</p>
<p>The country had fallen in love with Jacques abour all over again.</p>
<p>And soon enough Hollywood came knocking to and the early 1990s.</p>
<p>19:09</p>
<p>She smoothed her Infamous slap and several sitcoms and parody films.</p>
<p>She played herself on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.</p>
<p>There is something that I&rsquo;m just dying to know.</p>
<p>Yes, I did it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here deserve to be slapped.</p>
<p>And again, in The Beverly Hillbillies movie and some woman involved in a drive-by slapping.</p>
<p>19:31</p>
<p>So what happened?</p>
<p>Actually, he slapped me.</p>
<p>And again, in the opening credits of Naked Gun, 2 and a half every fucking time.</p>
<p>When I go shopping in the end, even though Zhao lost in court.</p>
<p>19:50</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d won Zsa, Zsa, Gabor.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the first celebrity to use her indiscretions, as a way to Garner media, attention for herself.</p>
<p>But this Celebrity Crime to PR pipeline.</p>
<p>She helped create is Alive.</p>
<p>20:06</p>
<p>And Well, the mugshots, the headlines, the outfits worn to court the inevitable Redemption Arc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s practically become a formula.</p>
<p>Look at what happened with the College admission Scandal that rocked the media and 2019, Full House star Lori Lachlan.</p>
<p>20:23</p>
<p>And her husband Massey mogea newly.</p>
<p>Of paying half a million dollars to get their two, daughters into USC.</p>
<p>Some very wealthy people, including several Hollywood celebrities paid enormous sums of money to falsify academic and athletic records to get their kids into college.</p>
<p>20:40</p>
<p>One of the more high-profile celebrities that got caught was Laurie Lachlan.</p>
<p>She played Aunt Becky in the TV show Full House while the Scandal didn&rsquo;t help resurrect Aunt Becky&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>It did help Propel her daughter.</p>
<p>Olivia Jade further into the spa.</p>
<p>20:56</p>
<p>Light Olivia Jade started out as YouTube famous, but the Scandal made her famous famous.</p>
<p>If Jesus come back to our stopped over at Larry King and Joan Rivers.</p>
<p>Olivia James version was to visit Willow and Jada Pinkett Smith on their show, red table, talk, where celebrities go to get vulnerable.</p>
<p>21:18</p>
<p>Hi, my heart is racing.</p>
<p>And now she&rsquo;ll be joining the cast of Dancing With the Stars alongside other celebs like Sporty Spice Mel C for the show&rsquo;s 30th season.</p>
<p>21:38</p>
<p>I think when I first got the opportunity, I definitely thought about it a little bit just like how would this look?</p>
<p>And is this something I should be doing?</p>
<p>But I also am a firm believer in second chances and redeeming your.</p>
<p>I feel like once you get to the point of being as commercially relevant as a Spice Girl.</p>
<p>21:56</p>
<p>No, your Redemption Arc is complete.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say for certain, but I&rsquo;m not so sure that the world would have been so interested to tune into Olivia Jade.</p>
<p>Had she not been the beneficiary of such a public criminal Scandal.</p>
<p>The other way.</p>
<p>22:13</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen celebrities flip their crimes into PR is almost more concerning its Scandal, as theater Scandal as Source, material Scandal as content.</p>
<p>In this case, you&rsquo;re not asking to be redeemed from your crime.</p>
<p>22:29</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking to be watched because of it.</p>
<p>My mind immediately goes to Bravo&rsquo;s Real Housewives franchise, entire Seasons long, narratives have revolved around cast members crimes.</p>
<p>Most recently, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills has dedicated an entire season to Erika Girardi.</p>
<p>22:50</p>
<p>She and her husband are wrapped up in several lawsuits for allegedly misusing money.</p>
<p>From a settlement fund for victims of a plane, crash misusing it by spending it on themselves.</p>
<p>The news about Erika, Girardi.</p>
<p>Finally broke on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</p>
<p>23:06</p>
<p>Last night.</p>
<p>Ladies were shocked and confused after reading wild accusations about Erika and Tom and the LA Times.</p>
<p>And the big question is, how much did Erica know if all publicity is good publicity than boy.</p>
<p>Are these women getting good publicity, but my question is even if the courts act as fairly Early as they can.</p>
<p>23:27</p>
<p>How can you possibly deliver Justice to someone who&rsquo;s bad behavior?</p>
<p>Only makes them more famous to be clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking this as someone who is fully bought into the Real Housewives.</p>
<p>Who was thoroughly entertained by Zsa, Zsa Gabor story.</p>
<p>23:44</p>
<p>I love to watch a rich white woman cry through the botox.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d call it a guilty pleasure, but I don&rsquo;t feel guilty.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s a harmless pleasure though.</p>
<p>Because as long as there&rsquo;s a market for stories of the Glamorous criminal, There&rsquo;s an opportunity to spin bad behavior into gold and why choose to be good when you can be famous instead.</p>
