    <p>What&rsquo;s called a sax LP meeting?</p>
<p>Is it an LP meeting or you go? Are you going to like Peter Thiel a little layer?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 9 a.m. You must be there must be a call going on. It&rsquo;s actually booted to Ben. Eh, it&rsquo;s a dish sacks</p>
<p>Every week that Chamath is in Italy another button guts undone</p>
<p>We open sources</p>
<p>Hey everybody, hey everybody, welcome to another episode of the all-in podcast episode 36 back with us today on the</p>
<p>program the queen of quinoa</p>
<p>science</p>
<p>Spectacular</p>
<p>Friedberg is with us again with leading off last episode Friedberg with a great</p>
<p>Friedberg science monologue the crowd went crazy for it. How does it feel coming off that an epic performance in episode 35?</p>
<p>tell us what were you thinking going into the game and</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I was thinking I would talk about the Alzheimer&rsquo;s drug approval at Biogen</p>
<p>I felt like I did it when we were done</p>
<p>Great. Yeah, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s like literally interviewing quiet Leonard. I feel like a 50-point game</p>
<p>Okay, and with us Rain Man David Sachs with layers for players</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been styled and groomed</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s in some random hotel room. How are you doing rain, man? Good good. I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not in a hotel room. I&rsquo;m oh</p>
<p>Your home just happens to look like a five-star resort. Got it. Forgot that</p>
<p>And give us an idea coming into today&rsquo;s game</p>
<p>With the layers you obviously are here to dominate and get your monologues up</p>
<p>Gotta be hard for you to look at the stat line and see yourself trailing in monologues behind the dictator</p>
<p>Referring to all in statistics. Yeah, where some maniac is breaking down how many minutes we each talk</p>
<p>Jason I&rsquo;m really happy with my performance for me. It&rsquo;s about quality not quantity. I like to stick and stick and jab</p>
<p>Okay, got it. Got it. What are we talking about right now? What what what?</p>
<p>Hell are you talking about right there is a Twitter account done</p>
<p>You know how this the all-in stands have a ton of skills</p>
<p>Like there is an audience for this podcast that has more skills</p>
<p>Then you know, it&rsquo;s like the 5% of the most skilled people in the world. Listen to this podcast. So</p>
<p>In addition to doing the merge in addition to doing who&rsquo;s the guy Henry who does all those incredible videos with animations?</p>
<p>in addition to those</p>
<p>Every time I start crushing those things are great. Those are amazing</p>
<p>Of course you have young Spielberg who led the charge dropping credible credible tracks and now we have this new crew that is</p>
<p>Analyzing somebody put you know, we&rsquo;ll put in the show notes a link to it, but they do</p>
<p>some type of AI analysis of</p>
<p>The audiophiles and they tell us who had the most monologues and then the running time and then historic running time</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re actually looking at it trying to figure out</p>
<p>You know who is speaking the most and they thought Friedberg was gonna run away with the episode</p>
<p>But it kind of disappeared in the second half of the game and Schmott obviously came around the corner and took his 27%</p>
<p>But they live a pie chart of how much we each talk. I have a I always have a very strong first and third quarter</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. Yeah, and then</p>
<p>He gets frustrated when he passes the ball and somebody misses a shot</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like LeBron in the early days</p>
<p>So kicking off today Lena Khan has been confirmed to the FTC with bipartisan support interesting</p>
<p>And this is obviously going to be a challenge for big tech on Tuesday</p>
<p>The Senate voted 69 to 28 to confirm Lena Khan who is a very well-established critic of big tech</p>
<p>And this is obviously really unique because she&rsquo;s 32 years old and she&rsquo;s leaving FTC, which is</p>
<p>Unbelievable. I did a little research on her and watch some videos</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s basically written two amazing papers and</p>
<p>The first paper came out in 2017 Amazon&rsquo;s antitrust paper the second one came out in June</p>
<p>And was about the separation of platforms and commerce and when you hear her speak, she is incredibly</p>
<p>Credible and knowledgeable it is as if</p>
<p>one of the four of us were discussing that she could come into this podcast and speak credibly about Amazon&rsquo;s businesses as opposed to the</p>
<p>charades we saw</p>
<p>At different hearings where the senators and Congress people just absolutely had no idea what they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>Some of the items I picked up from a talk. She gave in Aspen</p>
<p>is that</p>
<p>She she formed a lot of these opinions by talking to venture capitalists who were concerned about Amazon&rsquo;s dominance and other companies</p>
<p>And the competitive space and she is looking at consumer welfare</p>
<p>One of the lenses of antitrust, which will I&rsquo;m sure David Sachs will have some thoughts on as our resident attorney here</p>
<p>And the framing of those in terms of harm of the consumer. She believes there&rsquo;s other harm that happens</p>
<p>And she thinks one remedy is to kill Amazon basics because the marketplace shouldn&rsquo;t own the goods as well</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s concerned about cloud computing a consolidation because that creates fragility</p>
<p>And that is another type of consumer harm while she freely admits that prices have gone down services are free</p>
<p>And this is a consumer benefit. So she wants to rethink the entire</p>
<p>Concept and she is savvy. She brought up Facebook buying a novo the</p>
<p>Reportedly spyware VPN to give them a little advantage as to what was being used on phones and maybe give them a little product</p>
<p>roadmap information she also</p>
<p>Brought up Amazon studying the sales of other products to inform Amazon basics a claim that Amazon says they don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>But everybody knows they do do because all that information is publicly available</p>
<p>She talked about Amazon&rsquo;s VC arm using data to invest in and buying companies. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they that makes total sense?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great signal for them. She seems to want Amazon Web Services spun out which I think would just double</p>
<p>The value of it or maybe add 50% to the value of it and she gave very pragmatic</p>
<p>Examples like maybe separating Google Maps from Android and when you turn on your Android phone</p>
<p>You you would have to install maps or maybe you would pick from the different maps that are out there different</p>
<p>Programs and that there would be integration in them and people could swap out</p>
<p>You know MapQuest or Apple Maps in their Google searches</p>
<p>So a lot of actually very interesting pragmatic approaches and she doesn&rsquo;t think these need to be decade-long lawsuits</p>
<p>She thinks this is going to be a negotiation</p>
<p>and that people will kind of work together on it, but this is all with the backdrop of</p>
<p>Partisan politics and you know one group of people looking at this through the lens of wealth and</p>
<p>Inequality and another group looking at it through censorship sacks since you are our counsel here. What are your thoughts on this appointment?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean the interesting thing is that you know, Lena Khan is the the Bernie approved candidate</p>
<p>She is liked by the progressive left. But at the same time she got 21 Republicans to</p>
<p>Support her and so this</p>
<p>Nomination, you know sailed through confirmation. I think what she&rsquo;s saying it what she&rsquo;s saying. I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very good good argument to it that and I&rsquo;ve said similar things in the past</p>
<p>Which is you know, what she&rsquo;s basically saying especially in the case of Amazon is look you&rsquo;ve got this company Amazon that controls</p>
<p>essential</p>
<p>infrastructure AWS the whole distribution supply chain going all the way from the port to warehouses to</p>
<p>To logistics and distribution that is going to be owned by a scaled monopoly player. You have a massive economies of scale</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to dominate that and what they&rsquo;re doing is systematically going category by category and</p>
<p>using the monopoly monopoly profits they make by owning the sort of core infrastructure and</p>
<p>subsidizing their entry into each of these new categories that Amazon basics and others and</p>
<p>She calls that you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s predatory pricing and she&rsquo;s afraid that Amazon&rsquo;s is gonna end up dominating every category every</p>
<p>Category that you could build on top of this core infrastructure. I think it&rsquo;s actually a pretty valid concern</p>
<p>I think you see something analogous happening with Apple and Google and the app stores</p>
<p>We had a congressional hearing pretty recently in which you had Spotify on other apps</p>
<p>Complaining about what Apple was doing to them saying they are making our service non-viable with the 30% rake that they&rsquo;re charging</p>
<p>You remember Bill Gurley had a great post about this saying just because you can charge a 30% rake doesn&rsquo;t mean you should</p>
<p>Right now we&rsquo;re seeing this blowback from this massive 30% rake and you had Spotify saying look</p>
<p>Apple is doing this to basically make us</p>
<p>Infeasible relative to Apple Music. So I think there is a legit point here</p>
<p>Which is that if you own the monopoly platform the sort of essential infrastructure</p>
<p>You cannot use it to basically take over every application on top that can be built on top of that platform</p>
<p>That I think is a very appropriate</p>
<p>Use of of antitrust law and I think so. I think that&rsquo;s the good here now. I think that there there are some</p>
<p>some concerns or some potential downsides and</p>
<p>You know and the downside that I see is that we used to think we used to judge</p>
<p>antitrust law in terms of</p>
<p>Consumer welfare and so we so there was a limiting principle</p>
<p>To the actions of government, which is you would just look at prices and the effect on prices here</p>
<p>You know the the sort of movement that Lena Khan represents the so-called hipster antitrust movement</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re concerned about power and they want to restructure markets to avoid sort of concentrations of power</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the limiting principle there. And so I think what the</p>
<p>Market share be a limiting principle</p>
<p>Well, it would be a limiting principle in terms of who you could take action on but it wouldn&rsquo;t be a limiting principle in</p>
<p>Terms of how you would restructure the market</p>
<p>And I think what we&rsquo;re in for over the next few years is potentially a hyper politis</p>
<p>politicization of big tech markets</p>
<p>I think these 21 Republicans might soon feel like the dog who caught the bumper in the sense that yes</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re finally gonna have the regulation of big tech</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been calling for but they might not like all of the results because we because what could happen is a very intrusive meddling by</p>
<p>government in</p>
<p>the markets of technology and it could go well beyond sort of this this this gatekeeper principle</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;ve been talking about that. I think what would be a valid reason to regulate to mock</p>
<p>I think she has to be careful in focusing on Amazon. So if you break down antitrust law, there are really</p>
<p>Three big buckets where the attack vectors are and I&rsquo;m not going to claim to be an expert, but I think</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re relatively easy to understand. So you have the first principle body, which is called the Sherman Act</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that everybody&rsquo;s looked at and that&rsquo;s you know, sort of where</p>
<p>most current</p>
<p>Antitrust</p>
<p>Enforcement action has failed on tech companies because it largely looks at the predatory nature of pricing power that certain</p>
<p>Companies have and you have to remember this thing was written in the 1800s</p>
<p>And so, you know, what did people do when they control things? They just they drove prices up tech does the exact opposite, right?</p>
<p>they constantly drive prices down and</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s counterintuitive is it turns out that in the olden days driving prices up drove out competition</p>
<p>Today driving prices down drives out competition. Yes, right. So, you know you make gmail infinite storage</p>
<p>Nobody else can compete with why switch you why switch you make you know</p>
<p>Photos completely subsidized you make certain music products effectively free and you subsidize that you know</p>
<p>You create enormous amounts of content blah blah blah</p>
<p>So give the Sherman Act then somewhere along the way we realized okay, we need to add something</p>
<p>We created this thing called the Clayton Act that was around M&amp;A</p>
<p>Right. We added to that a lot of folks that are listening probably have heard of Hart Scott Rodino HSR</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all gone through it right on M&amp;A events. We have to file these HSR clearances when you make big investments</p>
<p>for example, you know, I just made a</p>
<p>Climate change thing. We had to file HSR</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this FTC a which is the Federal Trade Commission Act. That is where she can get, you know</p>
<p>If to use a poker term</p>
<p>You know a little frisky why because the FTC a</p>
<p>has these two specific things which says you can have an unfair method of competition or an unfair or</p>
<p>deceptive act or practice</p>
<p>now it falls on her and her team to basically build the strongest case around those two dimensions and</p>
<p>My only advice to her I wrote this in 2019 in my investor letter as well. Just thinking about the breakdown of big tech</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna go after these guys, that&rsquo;s the body of law that probably is the most</p>
<p>Defensible</p>
<p>But you probably have to start, you know, whether you like it or not with Facebook or Google</p>
<p>And the reason is there are more examples how you can use that language under the FTC a</p>
<p>To give those folks a hard time. I think it&rsquo;s much harder the example would be Chamath that</p>
<p>We are giving away this product losing money on it to keep you in our store and moat you into our</p>
<p>Advertising Network, etc</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example. Yeah, that&rsquo;s yeah or or you know, we then we then and</p>
<p>Because then when you have control then you can show that then the first part the Sherman Act part</p>
<p>Kicks in why so you&rsquo;ve seen 15 or 20 years of Google</p>
<p>Facebook less Apple by the way</p>
<p>Using their edge to decrease price and for the first time in the last quarter both of these two companies</p>
<p>And they were the only two of big tech that announced an increase in pricing, right?</p>
<p>They saw a diminishing of CPM inventory</p>
<p>And so they had to figure out ways to grow inventory as users started to stagnate and what they really said is we&rsquo;re ramping up</p>
<p>CPMs and CPMs. I think we&rsquo;re up 28 30 percent in a quarter. Yeah, and there&rsquo;s a lot of competition right now for it</p>
<p>Put these two ideas together</p>
<p>Which is step one is you surreptitiously basically take all the costs out of the system and then step to raise price over time</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably something there</p>
<p>Friedberg when we look at her age and her obvious</p>
<p>Deep deep knowledge. Do you see that as an overall plus?</p>
<p>I mean obviously if you know David framed her as the Bernie approved candidate</p>
<p>But then conceded that 20 Republicans are backing her. What do you what do you think about?</p>
<p>The massive credibility she has Friedberg in terms of she&rsquo;s actually understands this deeply</p>
<p>clearly</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s not dumb</p>
<p>If that if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re asking, I&rsquo;m not sure. I mean, it&rsquo;s a 32 year old</p>
<p>I mean, do we have we seen an appointment like that before? I mean, I don&rsquo;t know. Yeah, that&rsquo;s good for her. Um, yeah</p>
<p>So I just feel like there&rsquo;s a bit of a cycle underway</p>
<p>Where we have this kind of anti wealth anti wealth accumulation</p>
<p>Sentiment as an undercurrent right now, you know, obviously Bernie and Elizabeth Warren and others are our key vocal</p>
<p>Proponents of change that&rsquo;s needed to keep this kind of wealth disparity from continuing to grow and one of the solutions is to reduce the</p>
<p>monopolistic</p>
<p>Capacity of certain business models specifically in technology</p>
<p>The downside that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s realized and and that inevitably comes with</p>
<p>this action under this new kind of business model of the the technology age or the digital age is</p>
<p>the damage to consumers</p>
<p>And so, you know as as Chamath and David pointed out like historically antitrust has been about protecting the consumer</p>
<p>And the irony is the more monopoly or the more monopolistic or the more market share amazon gains</p>
<p>the cheaper things get for consumers</p>
<p>And um, and it&rsquo;s unfair to small businesses and to business owners and to competitors</p>
<p>But consumers do fundamentally benefit and so the the logical argument she made in her paper that was widely distributed a few years ago</p>
<p>Um what was around this notion?</p>
<p>That in this new world, it&rsquo;s not about consumer harm</p>
<p>And we need to look past the impact to consumers and look more at kind of the you know</p>
<p>The fact that this company maybe prevents innovation and prevents competition, but ultimately if the consumer is harmed</p>
<p>In the resolution of that concern</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to wake up to it for a while</p>
<p>And then consumers one day are going to wake up and they&rsquo;re going to be like wait a second</p>
<p>Why am I paying five bucks for gmail?</p>
<p>And you know, why am I paying an extra ten dollars for shipping to get my amazon products brought to me every day?</p>
<p>And you know all the things that I think we&rsquo;ve taken um</p>
<p>for granted</p>
<p>in the digital age</p>
<p>With the advent of these, you know</p>
<p>Call it monopolistic kind of business models where they accumulate market share and they can squeeze pricing and keep people out and the bigger</p>
<p>They get the cheaper they get and therefore it&rsquo;s harder to compete</p>
<p>Consumers have benefited tremendously. I I think all of us would be hard-pressed to say I would love to pay 10 bucks a month</p>
<p>For gmail i&rsquo;d love to pay for facebook</p>
<p>And at the end of the day these models i&rsquo;d love to pay more for shipping with amazon</p>
<p>Um, and so, you know, it becomes a value question, right? What do you value more?</p>
<p>Do you value the opportunity for competition and innovation in the business world or do you value as a consumer?</p>
<p>Better pricing and I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re really having that debate</p>
<p>And I think that that debate will inevitably kind of arise over the next couple of years if and as freeberg</p>
<p>How much this kind of played out?</p>
<p>And I think to be clear freeberg what you&rsquo;re saying is this is driven by the extraordinary wealth of jeff bezos zuckerberg, etc</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to pinpoint that problem</p>
<p>And then not involve the repercussions to consumers</p>
<p>If you try and change how business operates in a free market system</p>
<p>And these businesses are successful</p>
<p>Because they have customers that like competition</p>
<p>And they drive in a competitive way of pricing down and they prevent people from coming in and competing</p>
<p>Not by entering into contracts and antitrust enforcement all this sort of stuff</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing it because they&rsquo;re scaling and offering lower prices</p>
<p>I mean this like peter teal and mark andreessen have separately argued for this in really intelligent ways probably</p>
<p>In a far more articulated way than I can</p>
<p>But and they did this early on which is you know</p>
<p>We want to find businesses that can become monopolies because if you can reduce your pricing and improve your pricing power with scale</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be harder and harder for someone to compete and therefore</p>
<p>The capital theory is rush a bunch of capital into these businesses help them scale very quickly</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>This is obviously the basis of uber and others</p>
<p>And then get really big really fast create the moat create the moat drop the pricing and then no one can compete with you on</p>
<p>Pricing consumers benefit and you&rsquo;ve created the big business and you&rsquo;ve locked everyone</p>
<p>Okay, so let me go around the horn here and frame this for everybody. Let&rsquo;s assume that</p>
<p>Uh, big tech does get breaking up this broken up. This is uh an exercise</p>
<p>um, we assume it gets broken up and</p>
<p>YouTube and android are spun out instagram whatsapp are spun out aws is spun out</p>
<p>And you know app stores are allowed on</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s platform</p>
<p>Uh ios for the first time I want to know if this is good bad or neutral</p>
<p>For the following two people so these breakups occur</p>
<p>Is it good bad or neutral for consumers and then two is it good bad or neutral for startups sax?</p>
<p>I generally would lean towards saying yes</p>
<p>I mean a lot depends on better neutral for each party startups and for consumers</p>
<p>I I think it could ultimately be good for for both</p>
<p>But it really depends on how it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>And I think there is a big risk here that this just degenerates into</p>
<p>sort of hyper</p>
<p>politicization</p>
<p>You get intensive amounts of lobbying by big tech in washington</p>
<p>That what happens is, you know, you have a good cop bad cop where lena khan just becomes the bad cop</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s there to kind of keep big tech in line threatens to break them up</p>
<p>And then the good cop is you know biden</p>
<p>And the administration and then they they become the protection under the extortion racket they raise on</p>
<p>You know ungodly amounts of money and really it&rsquo;ll be a bonanza for for all elected officials because now</p>
<p>Big tech&rsquo;s gonna have to increase his donations even more super cynical. Wow. That&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the cynical take so we could end up</p>
<p>With something much worse than what we have now, but but I think the legit I think the words you&rsquo;re going to hear a lot</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>Are common carrier because what she seems to be saying is look</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a tech monopoly that controls core infrastructure, we need to regulate you like a common carrier</p>
<p>You cannot summarily deny service to your competitors who are downstream applications built on top of your platform</p>
<p>Conservatives can get behind that because that is the argument they&rsquo;ve been making about facebook cutting off free speech is you are a speech utility</p>
<p>You should be regulated as a common carrier. You cannot cut off people</p>
<p>Summarily, you cannot discriminate against people who should be allowed to have free speech on your platform</p>
<p>And so I think there is I think the left and the right here can cut a deal</p>
<p>Where they regulate these guys these big tech companies as common carriers. I think that is what we&rsquo;re headed towards</p>
<p>So a bakery can deny service as we talked about previous issue to a gay couple who wants a cake because it&rsquo;s a tiny little</p>
<p>Company and there&rsquo;s other choices</p>
<p>But when we&rsquo;re talking about facebook and twitter</p>
<p>There are not other choices and once you&rsquo;re removed like trump has been from the public square</p>
<p>There is no recourse you are essentially zeroed out chamath</p>
<p>Is it good for startups bad for startups neutral same thing for consumers if you know one chunk of every company got cleavered off</p>
<p>uh, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Unanimously good for startups in any</p>
<p>Scenario in which they get involved and I think in most cases in which the government gets involved. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for consumers as well</p>
<p>And why in both cases</p>
<p>So for startups, it&rsquo;s just because I think right now we have a massive</p>
<p>human capital sucking sound</p>
<p>um that big tech creates in the ecosystem</p>
<p>Which is that there is an entire generation of people?</p>
<p>That are basically unfortunately frittering away their most productive years</p>
<p>Getting paid what seems to them like a lot of money</p>
<p>Uh, but is what is effectively just you know</p>
<p>Um payola to not go to a competitor or go to a startup at by big tech</p>
<p>So to explain that clearly for example, like if you&rsquo;re a machine learning person</p>
<p>Right, uh those machine learning people</p>
<p>um, you know can get paid</p>
<p>750 to a million dollars a year to stay at google</p>
<p>And instead they won&rsquo;t go to a startup because they take sort of the bird in the hand, right?</p>
<p>You multiply that by a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand very talented, you know technical people</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually what you&rsquo;re seeing every day now</p>
<p>Those numbers are actually much higher, you know, if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re a specific ai person, you can get paid five ten million dollars a year</p>
<p>my point is</p>
<p>They could have started a startup and they could have and frankly</p>
<p>They they look let&rsquo;s be honest</p>
<p>They go to google facebook and whatever and I don&rsquo;t think anybody sees the real value of what they&rsquo;re doing in those places except getting</p>
<p>Paid now they&rsquo;re making a rational economic decision for themselves. And so nobody should blame them for that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But if startups had more access to those people</p>
<p>Um, or if you know those engineers finally said, you know what enough&rsquo;s enough i&rsquo;m actually going to go and try something new</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s net additive to the ecosystem. It&rsquo;s net additive to startups, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s for them and then for consumers. I think the reason why it&rsquo;s positive is that it&rsquo;ll start to show you</p>
<p>In which cases you had been giving away something that you didn&rsquo;t realize was either valuable or you didn&rsquo;t realize you were giving away</p>
<p>In return for all of these product subsidies that you were getting</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the next big thing that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>You can see it in the the enormous amount of investment apple for example</p>
<p>Is making in both advertising the push to privacy as well as implementing the push to privacy, you know this last</p>
<p>WWDC</p>
<p>You know, they really threw the gauntlet down, you know, they they were really trying to blow up</p>
<p>Um the advertising business models of google and facebook</p>
<p>And as consumers become more aware of that</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably willing to pay more</p>
<p>So a simple example is you know, there are a lot of people now who will pay higher prices for food</p>
<p>If they know it to be organic</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>There are people who will pay higher prices for electricity or for an electric car because of its impact or the lack thereof in</p>
<p>The climate so it&rsquo;s not to say that people always want cheaper faster better, right?</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes people will buy an iphone because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Obviously protecting their privacy and they know it&rsquo;s not an ad based model. And in fact apple is now</p>
<p>making that part of their process, so</p>
<p>Freeberg I asked the other gentlemen, uh, if they thought some large unit being chopped off of every company youtube aws</p>
<p>Uh instagram you pick it</p>
<p>Um would be a net positive for startups or negative or neutral and the same thing for consumers. What do you think?</p>
<p>Which gentleman did you ask you mean?</p>
<p>I was specifically referring to the ones who are wearing layers</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m using the term</p>
<p>Lightly, so if you guys go back a few years ago, you&rsquo;ll uh, remember there were these I think there were congressional hearings</p>
<p>And uh, jeremy stoppelman from yelp was pretty vocal</p>
<p>about how google</p>
<p>Um was redirecting</p>
<p>Search engine traffic to their own kind of reviews and they were pulling yelp content off the site</p>
<p>But then they said to yelp if you don&rsquo;t want us to pull your content, you can turn the web crawler</p>
<p>Toggle off and we won&rsquo;t crawl your site, but your site is publicly available. We can crawl it and we show snippets on our</p>
<p>Home page, but then their argument was well</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using our content to drive your own reviews</p>
<p>And they made this whole kind of case that google&rsquo;s kind of monopoly in search was harming their ability to do business</p>
<p>Um, you know the counter argument was well</p>
<p>If you guys have a great service consumers will go to your app directly or your website directly to get reviews</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t go to google and so it created a little bit of this kind of noise for a while</p>
<p>I think there was some follow-up and this is all very much related because</p>
<p>Ultimately if he was able to get google to stop</p>
<p>Providing a review service his business would do better</p>
<p>Because then google would effectively redirect search traffic to his site as opposed to their own internal site</p>
<p>So it is inevitably the case that in-house apps or in-house services that compete with third-party services when you&rsquo;re a platform business</p>
<p>um are</p>
<p>You know if they&rsquo;re removed, it&rsquo;s certainly going to benefit the competitive landscape, which is typically startups</p>
<p>You know imagine if apple didn&rsquo;t have apple maps pre-installed on the iphone</p>
<p>Everyone would download and use google maps, right? I mean, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Mapquest whatever or map quest or whatever and so, um, you know</p>
<p>Or whatever startup came along in like ways and said hey, we&rsquo;ve got a better map</p>
<p>But because they have this ability to kind of put that apple maps in front of you as a consumer</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a default on your phone. You&rsquo;re more likely to just click on it and start using it and you&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>it certainly opens up this window, but I think the question is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Ultimately best for the consumer if you believe that consumers will choose what&rsquo;s best for themselves</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to kind of manipulate with the market a bit and sax</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I think you&rsquo;ve got a different point of view on this but yeah</p>
<p>Well, i&rsquo;m a i&rsquo;m a free markets type of guy but</p>
<p>My experience at paypal really changed my thinking on this because paypal</p>
<p>You know was a startup that launched effectively as an involuntary app on top of the ebay market at that time ebay</p>
<p>Had a monopoly on the auction market and that was the key sort of beachhead market for online payments</p>
<p>So we launched on top of ebay. They were constantly trying to</p>
<p>Dislodge us and remove us from their platform and really the only thing keeping them from just switching us off</p>
<p>Was a was an antitrust thread. We actually spun up</p>
<p>You could call it a lobbying operation where we would send information to the ftc and the doj and say listen</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this auction monopoly here. That&rsquo;s taking anti-competitive actions</p>
<p>Against us this little startup</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>And so we were able to rattle the saber and and sort of brush them back from the plate</p>
<p>From taking a you know a much more dramatic action against us</p>
<p>and frankly</p>
<p>We did something kind of similar with visa mastercard because paypal was essentially an application on top of visa mastercard as well</p>
<p>We offered merchants the ability to accept visa mastercard, but also paypal payments which were gradually</p>
<p>Eating into and supplanting the the credit card payments</p>
<p>And so, you know visa mastercard had a very dim view of paypal and they were constantly</p>
<p>You know, they were constantly making noise about switching us off</p>
<p>And I I do think that without the threat of antitrust hanging over these big monopolies or duopolies</p>
<p>It would have been very hard for us as a startup</p>
<p>To get the access to these networks that we needed</p>
<p>and so it really kind of changed my thinking about it because</p>
<p>You know if you let these giant monopolies run</p>
<p>Wild run run amok. They will absolutely stifle innovation</p>
<p>They will become gatekeepers</p>
<p>And so you have to have the threat of antitrust action hanging over their heads or you will stifle innovation</p>
<p>Absolutely. I mean if you just look at the interesting google flights over time i&rsquo;m looking at a chart right now</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put it into the notes</p>
<p>Google flights, you know, I know some of us don&rsquo;t fly commercial anymore</p>
<p>But you know for somebody who&rsquo;s uh looking for flights on a regular basis</p>
<p>watching</p>
<p>Google intercept flight information put up google flights and it&rsquo;s an awesome product and</p>
<p>Just expedia and bookings.com</p>
<p>So jason that was a company called ita software based out of boston and ita was acquired by google</p>
<p>Ita was the search engine behind flight search for most companies. It was like 70 phds</p>
<p>They were all statistics guys, and they basically built this logistical model that identified, you know</p>
<p>Flights and pricing and all this sort of stuff. Oh, wow. So that should never been allowed. Well, they created a white label</p>
<p>uh search capability</p>
<p>That they then provided and they were making plenty of money providing this as a white label search capability to expedia and kayak and all</p>
<p>the online, uh travel agencies</p>
<p>And google wanted to be in that business because travel search was obviously such a big vertical</p>
<p>And rather than just buy a travel search site</p>
<p>They bought the engine that powers travel search for most of the other so gangster</p>
<p>And then they also revealed the results in their own search result homepage</p>
<p>uh, which effectively cut off the otas and the otas are big spenders on google ads, so</p>
<p>So basically google this is how nefarious it is if i&rsquo;m hearing what you&rsquo;re saying freeberg correctly</p>
<p>They watched all this money being made by those otas</p>
<p>They watched where they got their data from then they bought their data source and then they decided you know</p>
<p>What we won&rsquo;t take your cost per click money. We&rsquo;ll just take your entire business. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>So so let me just let me just say it another way</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s best for consumers? So does a consumer because what happens a lot in the dictatorships, I guess</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want to make money in online advertising. There are a lot of these ad arbitrage businesses</p>
<p>This is one way to think about it where um, you know</p>
<p>A service provider will pay for ads on google to get traffic</p>
<p>The ads will come to their site and then they will either make money on ads or you know</p>
<p>Kind of sell that consumer in another way, right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s effectively what the otas were is they were they became</p>
<p>intermediaries online search engine intermediaries that were arbitraging google&rsquo;s ad costs versus what they could get paid for the consumer</p>
<p>And so google right look at this and they&rsquo;re like wait a second</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only capturing half the pie</p>
<p>And consumers don&rsquo;t want to have to click through three websites to buy a flight or buy a hotel</p>
<p>And by the way, if they did they would keep doing it</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we just give them the end result right up front?</p>
<p>And then consumers will be happier the less time they have to spend clicking through sites and looking at other shitty ads</p>
<p>The happier they&rsquo;ll be and the product just works incredibly. Well consumers consumers lives less arduous</p>
<p>While building a power base that then could make their lives miserable</p>
<p>What I think lena khan is saying though is you can&rsquo;t just look at the short-term interests of consumers</p>
<p>You got to look at their long-term interests</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in the long-term interest of consumers is to have competition in the short term</p>
<p>These giant monopolies can engage in predatory pricing to lower the cost for consumers</p>
<p>And so just looking at the price on a short-term basis isn&rsquo;t enough</p>
<p>And they can trick people to giving them something else that they don&rsquo;t know to be valuable</p>
<p>So in the case of these, you know, a lot of these companies, what are they doing?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re tricking them to get enormous amounts of user information. Yep</p>
<p>personal information</p>
<p>User-generated content and they get nothing for it</p>
<p>And then on the back of that if you&rsquo;re able to build a trillion look at look at the value that youtube has generated</p>
<p>Um economic value and then try to figure out how much of that value is really shared</p>
<p>With the creator community inside of youtube i&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s less than 50 basis points</p>
<p>They get 55 percent of revenue. Yeah, but you&rsquo;re saying downstream with all that data</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s making a massive amount of money. I just want to if you if you impute the value of all of the pii that google</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information all the cookies that they drop all that information and you equate it to an economic enterprise value</p>
<p>Not necessarily yearly revenue like a discounted cash flow over 20 years</p>
<p>You would be in the trillions and trillions of dollars</p>
<p>And then if you discounted the same 20 years of revenue share that they give to their content producers</p>
<p>It will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars at best and so you&rsquo;re talking about an enormous trade-off where google</p>
<p>basically has</p>
<p>um built</p>
<p>You know a multi-trillion dollar asset and has leaked away less than 10 or 15 percent of the value</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an example where they are giving people something that they think is valuable</p>
<p>But in return they&rsquo;re able to build something much much more valuable</p>
<p>Hold on</p>
<p>I just want to address like sax&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>Which is the regulators are now going to start to think about the long-term interest consumer over the short-term interest of the consumer</p>
<p>as um effectively giving the regulatory throttle</p>
<p>uh to uh elected officials</p>
<p>And this means that you&rsquo;re now giving another throttle right another controlled, uh joystick</p>
<p>Um, uh to to folks that may not necessarily come from business</p>
<p>Um that may not necessarily have the the appropriate background</p>
<p>And that may have their own kind of political incentives and motivations to make decisions about what is right</p>
<p>And what is wrong for consumers over the long term and ultimately those are going to be value judgments, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no determinism here. There&rsquo;s no right or wrong</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be decisions based on the kind of opinion and nuance</p>
<p>Of of some elected people and so it is a very dangerous and kind of slippery slope to end up in this world</p>
<p>Where the judgment of some regulator about what&rsquo;s best for consumers long term versus the cold hard facts</p>
<p>Oh prices went up prices didn&rsquo;t you know, uh, but really saying well this could affect you in the future in this way</p>
<p>Um starts to become kind of a really, you know, scary and slippery slope</p>
<p>Uh, if we kind of embrace this, uh, this this new regulatory order</p>
<p>All right, moving on big news this week. Uh, apple had a gag order. It has been revealed</p>
<p>Um, this is unbelievable. It&rsquo;s pretty crazy. Um,</p>
<p>And we we only have partial information here, but the justice department subpoenaed apple in february of 2018</p>
<p>about an account that belonged to donald mcgann who obviously was the</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s white house counsel at the time and obviously was part of the campaign</p>
<p>He is very famously, uh known for being interviewed by mueller and at that</p>
<p>This is the time period by the way, we&rsquo;re talking about here in february of 2018</p>
<p>When mueller was investigating manafort who of course</p>
<p>Was super corrupt and went to jail and then was subsequently pardoned because they he was also involved in the campaign in 2016</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that this related to mueller. It&rsquo;s unknown at this time</p>
<p>Uh, many other folks were also caught up in this dragnet rod rosenstein was his second and it&rsquo;s um unclear if the fbi agents were investigating</p>
<p>uh, whether mcgann was the leaker, uh, or not trump, uh,</p>
<p>Had previously ordered mcgann the previous june to have the justice department remove mueller which mcgann</p>
<p>refused and threatened to resign and mcgann later</p>
<p>Revealed that he had in fact leaked his resignation threat to the washington post</p>
<p>Uh, according to the times disclosure that agents had collected data of a sitting white house counsel</p>
<p>Uh, which they kept secret for years is extraordinary. Go ahead sacks</p>
<p>Well, I I just think let&rsquo;s get all the facts out here. I think you&rsquo;re missing some of the key facts</p>
<p>So the the justice department under trump starts this investigation into leaks of classified information. They&rsquo;re on a mole hunt effectively</p>
<p>And they start uh making they subpoena the doj subpoenas records</p>
<p>From apple and it goes very broad and they end up subpoenaing the records</p>
<p>Not just of mcgann who&rsquo;s the white house counsel, which is very bizarre and curious</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;d be investigating their own white house counsel, but they also uh, well, it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ships</p>
<p>Yes, but they&rsquo;re all they also subpoena records of adam schiff and smallwell and members the house intelligence committee</p>
<p>And so you have now, um an accusation</p>
<p>Which is being breathlessly reported on cnn and msnbc that here you had the trump administration</p>
<p>Investigating its political enemies and using the subpoena power of the doj with apple&rsquo;s compliance</p>
<p>To now spy on their political enemies that that those are some big jumps</p>
<p>Those are some big jumps set up. Yeah, and and that those are some big jumps because</p>
<p>Um, according to preet bahara and some other folks who are in the industry</p>
<p>Um who who have done these actual subpoenas they could have been subpoenaing, you know, one of manafort&rsquo;s, you know corrupt, you know</p>
<p>partners in crime</p>
<p>And then those people he could have been talking to many people in the trump administration and then subsequently family members and others</p>
<p>So he might have not been the target. He could have been caught up in the metadata of other people</p>
<p>Yeah, so this might not be trump saying get me his iphone records it could be</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some dirty person</p>
<p>They know they&rsquo;re dirty and that person had reached out to other people and they might have even done one more hop from it</p>
<p>schmuck thoughts</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s one version. Yeah, and then you know the other the other version which is important is</p>
<p>You subpoena your own lawyer by going to apple</p>
<p>Getting basically god knows what data associated with this man&rsquo;s account</p>
<p>And then you know institutes a gag order on that company so that they can neither tell the person</p>
<p>Until now when the gag order expired nor tell anybody else nor have any recourse to the extent that they think that this is illegitimate</p>
<p>That to me smells really fishy</p>
<p>And so, you know like there are other mechanisms that that we know of like visa requests and other things that these big companies</p>
<p>Have to deal with all the time</p>
<p>This at least the way that it&rsquo;s written and how it&rsquo;s been reported is something outside of the pale</p>
<p>And so I think you have to deal with it with this question of like what the hell was going on over there</p>
<p>Yeah, it does seem like they were going</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>I mean, you know kindly maybe mole hunting more nefariously witch hunting</p>
<p>um, but they were trying to pin it on people and</p>
<p>They may have used this blanket</p>
<p>Sort of deniable plausibility of the russia, you know imbroglio</p>
<p>But really what these guys were doing was they were investigating anybody that they thought was a threat</p>
<p>And that is a really scary thing to have in a democracy</p>
<p>And then the fact that these big tech companies basically just turned it over and didn&rsquo;t have any recourse to protect the user</p>
<p>or to inform the public</p>
<p>Forget trump for a second. I think we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Necessarily want that to be the precedent that holds going forward</p>
<p>Yeah, and the interesting thing here is that sax</p>
<p>jeff sessions</p>
<p>Rosenstein and bar all say they&rsquo;re unaware of this. So what would be the charitable reason they were unaware of it?</p>
<p>or what would be the</p>
<p>Nefarious reason or is that important at all? Because that&rsquo;s really strange</p>
<p>Well, they would go after the white house council and adam schiff and those top three people would have no idea</p>
<p>Are they lying?</p>
<p>I mean what&rsquo;s next is the se you know, are we going to basically go to a point where like, you know</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>No, but I mean like every single post that one makes on facebook is basically surveilled</p>
<p>If you make an anonymous post on twitter, will you be tracked down?</p>
<p>I remember like as much as everybody thinks there&rsquo;s anonymity on the internet</p>
<p>There really isn&rsquo;t and you should just completely assume</p>
<p>That you are trackable are being tracked have been tracked. Everything is in the wide open</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of whether it&rsquo;s disclosed to you or not or whether it&rsquo;s brought back to you or not</p>
<p>So, yeah, so look I mean I I agree with jamath that this stinks</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an invasion of people&rsquo;s civil liberties, but I would not make it too partisan because</p>
<p>The obama administration was engaging in similar activity back in 2013</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think people realize this the there&rsquo;s an old saying in washington that the real scandal is what&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>And the fact of the matter is that what the trump administration did was certainly suspicious and it might have been politically motivated</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know but it was legal the doj convened a federal grand jury</p>
<p>Got these, uh got these subpoenas present them to apple and got this information</p>
<p>And in a similar way back in 2013, the obama administration did something similar. It&rsquo;s quite extraordinary</p>
<p>They subpoenaed the records of the ap they for they for two months. They got the records of reporters</p>
<p>and five branches of the ap and all their mobile records and they were on a</p>
<p>Mole hunt to try and find leakers of classified information</p>
<p>So the trump administration basically did exactly what the obama administration did the only new wrinkle</p>
<p>Is that they&rsquo;d only went after reporters. They actually subpoenaed records of members. You&rsquo;re missing one huge</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re missing one huge</p>
<p>Difference trump was under investigation</p>
<p>For espionage and treason at the time. So it is slightly different. Um,</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that different in the sense that trump used powers that were pioneered by the obama administration</p>
<p>They just took them. They just took them. Well one little step in addition to that sacks in addition to that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>When obama did it all the top brass at the department of justice were aware of this and in this case</p>
<p>You have three people who are running the department of administration all claiming. They don&rsquo;t know no</p>
<p>In 2013, there&rsquo;s a new york times article on this i&rsquo;m going to post on the in the show notes, but</p>
<p>It said that when first of all the ap was not informed about the subpoenas until a number of months later</p>
<p>So it was a secret</p>
<p>seizure of records same thing here with the gag order</p>
<p>And so you have people being investigated. They don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re being investigated</p>
<p>Investigated they can&rsquo;t even get a lawyer spun up to oppose the invasion of their rights</p>
<p>I agree with you, but the attorney general knew about that</p>
<p>Maybe the attorney general did but the white house claims that it didn&rsquo;t know so</p>
<p>In any event, I mean look what we I my view on this is that we shouldn&rsquo;t try to make this too partisan</p>
<p>What we have here is an opportunity to hopefully get some bipartisan</p>
<p>legislation to fix the issue and I think the fix should be this that</p>
<p>when you</p>
<p>Investigate somebody when you subpoena records from a big tech company, you have to notify them</p>
<p>You should not be able to do that secretly because the fact of the matter is that apple and these other big tech companies</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have an incentive to oppose the subpoena. They&rsquo;re not your lawyer</p>
<p>And actually brad smith the president of microsoft had a great op-ed</p>
<p>In the washington post that we should post that we should put in the show notes where he said these secret gag orders</p>
<p>Must stop he said that in the old way of the government subpoenaing records is that you would have</p>
<p>Essentially offline records you&rsquo;d have a file cabinet and the government would come with a search warrant</p>
<p>That present the search warrant to you and then you could get a lawyer to oppose it</p>
<p>Well, they don&rsquo;t do that anymore because your records aren&rsquo;t in a file cabinet somewhere</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the cloud. And so now they don&rsquo;t even go to the person who&rsquo;s being investigated, right?</p>
<p>They just go to a big tech company seize the records and then put a gag order on top of this</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even know you&rsquo;re being investigated. That&rsquo;s the part of it. That&rsquo;s and by the way, it&rsquo;s even more pernicious than that sacks because</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>Combine this with the previous story</p>
<p>What incentive does apple have to say to an administration that could break them up? We&rsquo;re not going to cooperate</p>
<p>of course</p>
<p>Zero incentive</p>
<p>They are not your agent in this and here&rsquo;s the thing. Those are your records</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the cloud, but they&rsquo;re your records and every other privacy context</p>
<p>We say those records belong to you not to big tech. So what they&rsquo;re not apples</p>
<p>This is why apple&rsquo;s moving everything to your phone, right?</p>
<p>But just this point why should the government be able to do an end run around you the target of the investigation?</p>
<p>Go to big tech get your records from because they&rsquo;re not your records. Well, first of all, they&rsquo;re not your records</p>
<p>These companies tricked all of us</p>
<p>By giving it to us for free so that we gave them all of our content</p>
<p>They are fair point just like they are not just the custodian. They are the trustee</p>
<p>of our content</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a huge distinction in what they&rsquo;re allowed to do and jason brings up an incredible point</p>
<p>which is which is that of course, they&rsquo;re now incentivized to have a back door and</p>
<p>Live under a gag order because their their defense</p>
<p>In a back room is you guys, you know when when in the light</p>
<p>Somebody says we should break you up in the dark. They can say guys. Come on</p>
<p>We got a back door. You just come in gag order us. Give us we&rsquo;ll give you what you want</p>
<p>You want a honeypot, right? You don&rsquo;t want this thing all over the internet</p>
<p>And can you imagine how credible david that is to your point?</p>
<p>because that is a body of</p>
<p>Concentrating power that I think is very scary in fairness to apple friedberg</p>
<p>They have locked down the phone and they&rsquo;ve moved all of this information from the cloud or they&rsquo;re starting this process and saying</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to keep some amounts of data encrypted on your phone</p>
<p>And of course with the san bernardino shooting they refused</p>
<p>In a terrorist shooting a known terrorist shooting to not give a back door</p>
<p>Um, well, that&rsquo;s a crazy standard. It&rsquo;s like, you know what?</p>
<p>Okay, there was a san bernardino shooter and they were like, nope. Sorry. That&rsquo;s a bridge too far</p>
<p>But you know don mcgann and basically like, you know</p>
<p>Political espionage they&rsquo;re like, here you go. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know. How do you make these decisions?</p>
<p>Let me ask you guys a question. Go ahead free bird. Would you be?</p>
<p>Could you see yourself?</p>
<p>thriving in a world</p>
<p>Where all of your information was completely publicly available</p>
<p>But also all of everyone else&rsquo;s information was completely publicly available</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Oh, everybody has all their nudes on the web is what you&rsquo;re saying. Everybody</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a book by stephen baxter called the light of other days</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my favorite sci-fi books. I sent it out to all of my uh investors this last</p>
<p>We do like a book thing every year</p>
<p>And I reread it recently</p>
<p>but the whole point of the book is that there&rsquo;s like a wormhole technology that they discover and they can figure out how to like</p>
<p>Look in you can boot up your computer and look in anywhere and see anything and hear anything you want</p>
<p>and so all of a sudden society has to transform under this kind of</p>
<p>New regime of hyper transparency where all information about everything is completely available</p>
<p>But I think the fear and the concern that we innately have with respect to loss of privacy</p>
<p>Is that there&rsquo;s a centralized or controlled power that has that information?</p>
<p>But what if there was a world that that you evolved to?</p>
<p>Where all of that information is generally available quite broadly and i&rsquo;m not advocating for this by the way</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, just pointing out that like the sensitivity we have is about our information being concentrated</p>
<p>In the hands of either a government or a business</p>
<p>um, and</p>
<p>I think you have to kind of accept the fact that more information is being generated about each of us every day</p>
<p>Than was being generated by us a few weeks ago or months ago or years ago, basically</p>
<p>Everybody everybody&rsquo;s the truma and everybody&rsquo;s the truman show is what you&rsquo;re saying. Well in a geometrically growing way</p>
<p>Information which we&rsquo;re calling pii or whatever is being generated about us and I think the genie&rsquo;s out of the bottle</p>
<p>Meaning like the the cost of sensors the access to digital the digital age and what it brings to us from a benefit perspective</p>
<p>Is creating information about us and a footprint about us that I don&rsquo;t think we ever kind of contemplated</p>
<p>But as that happens, the question is where does that information go?</p>
<p>Can you put that genie back in the bottle?</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a big philosophical point which is like if you try and put the genie back in the bottle</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really just trying to fight information wants to be free information wants to grow</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the name of the book you were talking about there?</p>
<p>The light of other days by stephen baxter and arthur c clark helped write it</p>
<p>But the book is most interesting about the philosophical implications of a world</p>
<p>Where all information is completely freely available</p>
<p>Any anyone? Yeah, completely transparent</p>
<p>And so like do we see ourselves because I think there&rsquo;s two paths one is you fight this and you fight it and you fight</p>
<p>It every which way which is I want my pii locked up. I don&rsquo;t want anyone having access to it</p>
<p>Yada, yada, yada</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll either see a diminishment of services or the other one is you do or you&rsquo;ll see a selfie on twitter</p>
<p>Where you take a shirt off or you&rsquo;ll see this concentration of power</p>
<p>Where we all kind of freak out where the government or or some business has all of our information</p>
<p>The other path is a path that society starts to recognize that this information&rsquo;s out there. There&rsquo;s you know, whatever</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about pii here. This is about due process</p>
<p>This is about our fifth amendment right to due process. You have the government secretly investigating people</p>
<p>They could never do this if they had to present you with a search warrant</p>
<p>They are doing an end run around that process by going to big tech just to put some numbers on this</p>
<p>Big tech is getting something like 400 subpoenas a week for people&rsquo;s records. They only oppose four percent of them</p>
<p>Why they have no incentive to how many of those?</p>
<p>Do you know how many of those are secret or not?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how many of them have a gag order</p>
<p>They are required to tell the target what happened but not if there&rsquo;s a gag order attached to it</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how many have a gag order</p>
<p>You should have the right to send your own lawyer to oppose the request not if you want to</p>
<p>For it if you want to see an amazing movie the lives of others, uh, which is about</p>
<p>the state security service in east berlin germany, uh</p>
<p>Also known as the stasi and the impact of literally in your apartment building</p>
<p>There are three people spying on the other 10 people</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re the postman and you know</p>
<p>the housewife and the teacher and they&rsquo;re all tapped and secretly recording to each other it leads to chaos and bad feelings and</p>
<p>obviously when east berlin, um</p>
<p>When the wall came down all of this came out and it was really dark and crazy</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean look let me connect this to the censorship issue actually because in my view they&rsquo;re both very similar civil liberties issues</p>
<p>Which is in the case of the censorship issue you have the government</p>
<p>Doing an end run around the first amendment by demanding that big tech companies engage in censorship that the government itself could not do</p>
<p>You have something very similar taking place here with these records. The government is demanding secrecy</p>
<p>About its seizure of records. They&rsquo;re imposing that on big tech. They&rsquo;re making big tech do its dirty work for them</p>
<p>They could never do that</p>
<p>Directly if they had to go to the target of the investigation and ask for their and and subpoena the records that way</p>
<p>So what you have here is a case where we not only need to be protected against the power of big tech</p>
<p>We need to be protected against the power of government</p>
<p>usurping</p>
<p>the powers of big tech to engage in</p>
<p>You know behavior they couldn&rsquo;t otherwise engage in and let&rsquo;s be honest big tech and the government are</p>
<p>uh overlapping and</p>
<p>in cahoots</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;re inside. Yeah, they&rsquo;re in some really crazy dance. The money is flowing freely from</p>
<p>Lobbyists and it&rsquo;s a very very complicated relationship. It&rsquo;s a very complicated. It&rsquo;s a very complicated relationship</p>
<p>All right, seven day average for covid deaths is uh now at</p>
<p>332</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Finding cases of people who have had covid</p>
<p>Um is now becoming like almost shocking. Uh, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw but uh, the point guard chris paul, uh,</p>
<p>Who is having an incredibly winning season in the nba? He basically got covid</p>
<p>They said he was vaccinated so it could be a mild case, but he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>Uh pulled out indefinitely and he&rsquo;s about to play in the western conference final. So it&rsquo;s pretty crazy and freeberg. Uh, obviously</p>
<p>california&rsquo;s opened up after 15 months and</p>
<p>We were the first to shut down the last to open up and we were hit the least I think of any state or amongst</p>
<p>the least of any</p>
<p>We were certainly the least of any large state</p>
<p>Um, and you&rsquo;re being asked</p>
<p>To still wear a mask at your office</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also being asked to take off my shoes when I get on an airplane</p>
<p>Yeah, 20 years later, and yeah, I don&rsquo;t think al-qaeda exists anymore</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, maybe some yeah parts of it explain what&rsquo;s happening to you in the presidio, which is a lovely state park</p>
<p>uh here in california</p>
<p>My office in the presidio in california san francisco county and the federal government have all removed mask mandates</p>
<p>But our our landlord has determined in their</p>
<p>Judgment that everyone should still wear a mask to go to work</p>
<p>And so to go into my rented office and work. I have to wear a mask</p>
<p>um, and I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an issue for a lot of people who like there&rsquo;s people that um,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>Probably a couple restaurants this week and you know</p>
<p>You go to some restaurants and everyone&rsquo;s just chilling the employees are not wearing masks</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other restaurants where they&rsquo;re being told they have to keep wearing masks by their manager or their boss</p>
<p>um, and so</p>
<p>this brings up this big question, which is like we&rsquo;ve now got the kind of</p>
<p>Psychic shadow of covid that that&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s gonna cast a very long shadow. You predicted it you predicted it and um,</p>
<p>And so people that that are in power</p>
<p>Want to continue to kind of impress upon, you know, whatever, you know employees or tenants or what have you they might have</p>
<p>Um in whatever they deem their judgment to be which is obviously in many cases an underinformed uninformed non-scientific</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>And non-mandated judgment about effectively what people should have to wear</p>
<p>So if the threat or the risk has been removed</p>
<p>And all of the health officials and all of the government agencies are saying the threat has been removed</p>
<p>You no longer need to kind of wear masks</p>
<p>But your boss or your manager or your landlord tells you you have to wear a mask</p>
<p>To conduct your business or to go to work</p>
<p>Um, you know, it&rsquo;s going to bring up this whole series of challenges and questions I foresee</p>
<p>For the next couple of months at least and maybe for several years about what&rsquo;s fair and what&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>And and there will always be the safety argument to be made on the other side</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very hard to argue against that and oh, well, the inconvenience is just a mask</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a big deal</p>
<p>But for you know a number of people to to now kind of be told, you know</p>
<p>What to do and what to wear it&rsquo;ll take a year</p>
<p>To sort all these things out because they&rsquo;ll all get prosecuted or not prosecuted but litigated</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to go to court they will get litigated for sure there will there will be lawsuits on this</p>
<p>And and what&rsquo;s going to happen is that you&rsquo;re going to basically have again jason back to that example of the the bakery in colorado</p>
<p>um private institutions will be allowed some level</p>
<p>of independence in establishing</p>
<p>um, you know certain employee guidelines and so on exactly and you you&rsquo;ll have to conform to those and</p>
<p>um, it is what it is. I mean, I I just it was very strange in austin</p>
<p>in terms of these</p>
<p>Covid uh dead enders who just will not let it go</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in austin where nobody is wearing a mask and then there were like I went into lululemon and</p>
<p>They like two people charged me with masks in hands</p>
<p>And they were like you have to wear a mask and I was like do I and they&rsquo;re like, yes, it&rsquo;s our policy</p>
<p>I was like fine. I&rsquo;ll put it on. I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>You know, no big deal thing. This thing has really fried a bunch of people&rsquo;s brains. I mean, it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s basically like you&rsquo;ve taken an entire group of folks and kidnapped them</p>
<p>And kidnapped them essentially. It&rsquo;s stockholm syndrome. It&rsquo;s incredible. No, everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s been held hostage, you know in a prison for the last year</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;ve kind of</p>
<p>Accepted that this is the new reality. I gotta wear a mask. I gotta wear gloves</p>
<p>um, and you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the similar sort of shift in reality that I think was needed going into this</p>
<p>Where people didn&rsquo;t believe what it was and now it&rsquo;s hard for them to believe what it&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>We flagged this human nature. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, we we flagged on this pod a few months ago the threat of zeroism. Yeah, which is that we wouldn&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>You know all the special rules and restrictions lift until there were zero cases of covet</p>
<p>And we all know that&rsquo;s never going to happen covet will always be around in the background</p>
<p>And just to add a layer to what&rsquo;s happening here in california is yeah on june 15th. We lifted the restrictions</p>
<p>But governor newsom has not given up his emergency powers and he&rsquo;s he says he will keep them until covet&rsquo;s been extinguished</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s now embraced zeroism</p>
<p>on behalf of uh</p>
<p>This sort of authoritarianism. Yeah, and you know, so we&rsquo;ve got this like golden state caesar</p>
<p>and now I</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is I don&rsquo;t think this is just because he&rsquo;s a tyrant. Although he&rsquo;s certainly been heavy-handed</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because that the I think it&rsquo;s more about corruption than ideology because</p>
<p>federal funds</p>
<p>Emergency funds from the federal government keep flowing to the state</p>
<p>As long as we have a state of emergency</p>
<p>And so the longer he keeps this thing going</p>
<p>The more money he gets from the federal government that he can then use in this recall year to pay people off</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve already seen he&rsquo;s been buying every vote he can right</p>
<p>He gave 600 bucks to everyone making under 35 000. He&rsquo;s forgiving all the traffic fines and parking tickets</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing this this lottery ticket, uh thing for getting the vaccine and so he just wants to keep the the um,</p>
<p>the gravy train from washington</p>
<p>California even though</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what government governor timoth would have done</p>
<p>I mean, it reminds me of 9 11 where people were just like hey, we can keep this gravy train. No, I mean like</p>
<p>9 11 is the perfect kind of psychic, you know scenario, uh, you know replaying itself with covid</p>
<p>There are behavioral changes that have lasted forever. There are regulatory changes this, you know department of homeland security</p>
<p>I mean you go through the amount of money that gets spent by the tsa every year</p>
<p>And the qualified risk and the qualified benefit</p>
<p>Completely unquantified right like the amount of money that flows into these programs because you can make the the subjective statement</p>
<p>There is a threat there is risk therefore spend infinite amounts of money right like it&rsquo;s because because you never kind of put</p>
<p>Pen to paper and say what is the risk? What is the probability?</p>
<p>What is the severity of loss and therefore let&rsquo;s make a value judgment about how much we should spend to protect against that downside</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now doing the same thing with covid</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not having a conversation about how many cases how many what&rsquo;s the risk?</p>
<p>Should we really still be spending billions of dollars of state funding?</p>
<p>To continue to protect a state where 70% of people are vaccinated and we and we have a massive surplus</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still giving people money</p>
<p>Who may or may not need it and we&rsquo;re doing it indiscriminately speaking of discussions and hard topics and being able to have them</p>
<p>YouTube which kicked off a ton of people on the platform for talking about things that were not approved by the who</p>
<p>Has taken professor brett weinstein&rsquo;s podcast down because he had a very reasonable discussion</p>
<p>About ivermectin and its efficacy or lack of efficacy. This is a doctor a phd talking to an md</p>
<p>Um, and the video was removed apple did not remove</p>
<p>This episode these people should not be the gatekeepers of the truth. They have no idea what the truth is</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the the john stewart appearance on steve</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I was about to don&rsquo;t tell this which is</p>
<p>Yeah, he killed he killed on steven colbert</p>
<p>But the things he was saying about the lab leak would not have been allowed on youtube</p>
<p>If it was three months ago that you would have been removed for it</p>
<p>Even as a comedian the performance was amazing. He basically says</p>
<p>You know the wuhan</p>
<p>Uh, covid lab is where the wuhan, you know, uh, no, the disease is named after the lab. So</p>
<p>Where do you think it came from was like a panel in you know mated with a bat</p>
<p>I mean this isn&rsquo;t and he goes on this whole diatribe. It&rsquo;s incredibly funny. Yes, but then at the end of it</p>
<p>Well, I I had two takeaways. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys felt this at first I was like</p>
<p>I had john stewart&rsquo;s a little unhinged here</p>
<p>Like I mean there was a part of it that was funny and then there was a part of it</p>
<p>Which is like wow, john stewart&rsquo;s been trapped indoors a little for 15 months</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so I I thought that as well to be honest, but then the second thing which I saw on twitter was</p>
<p>all these people reminding</p>
<p>Uh anybody who saw the tweet that this exact content would have not been allowed on big tech platforms</p>
<p>Were it said three or six months ago?</p>
<p>And I was like wow, this is this is really nuts meaning it takes a left-leaning</p>
<p>smart funny</p>
<p>Comedian to say something satire</p>
<p>If the if the right if the right would have said it would have just been instantly banished and that&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s kind of crazy</p>
<p>Yeah, the great quote was I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to science science has in many ways helped ease the suffering</p>
<p>of this pandemic</p>
<p>Uh, which was more than likely caused by science</p>
<p>yeah, well</p>
<p>It was a funny line where he said something like uh, if there was an outbreak of chocolatey goodness in hershey, pennsylvania</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be because you know, whatever the pangolin kissed the bat. It&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a fucking chocolate factory there</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t know maybe a steam shovel made it with a cocoa bean</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fucking chocolate factory</p>
<p>He was so funny, he&rsquo;s so he&rsquo;s so fun, so I I agree with jamal&rsquo;s takeaways, I mean this was</p>
<p>Great example of of censorship run amok at these big tech companies</p>
<p>but the other thing I saw that was really interesting was steven colbert lose control of his audience and</p>
<p>You know stewart killed on that show, but you could see steven colbert was I think visibly nervous very uncomfortable</p>
<p>Yeah, very uncomfortable. He did not know what was coming and he was trying to and when and when john stewart kept pushing this</p>
<p>He was like well, uh, he&rsquo;s not trying to qualify</p>
<p>Well, so what you&rsquo;re saying is now that falchi has said this might be a possibility</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying it might be a possibility and john stewart was having none of it</p>
<p>He ran right over that said no the name is the same. It&rsquo;s obvious. Come on</p>
<p>And yeah, like colbert kept challenging him. I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this part where he said hey listen</p>
<p>Is it possible that they have a lab in wuhan to study the coronavirus disease because one there are a lot of novel</p>
<p>Coronavirus diseases because it&rsquo;s a big bat population and then stewart is like no i&rsquo;m not standing for that</p>
<p>He goes I totally understand</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the local specialty and it&rsquo;s the only place to find bats. You won&rsquo;t find bats anywhere else</p>
<p>Oh, wait, austin, texas has thousands of people out of a cave every night at dusk</p>
<p>And he wouldn&rsquo;t let it go. So it&rsquo;s just great watching it was it was a reminder frankly of how funny</p>
<p>Both john stewart and stephen colbert were about 15 years ago</p>
<p>And I frankly I don&rsquo;t think stephen colbert is funny anymore because no because he&rsquo;s got to keep his job</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s carrying water. He&rsquo;s also too woke and and yeah, yes</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s become very polemical and and what stewart reminded us is that comedy is funny</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s making fun of the people who are pretentious and basically who aren&rsquo;t telling the truth and</p>
<p>Stephen colbert has become so polemical that he&rsquo;s lost sight of the comedy and john stewart brought it back and I hope you know</p>
<p>Colbert colbert had this element of satire which even stewart because stewart was in your face funny</p>
<p>Whereas colbert was like subtle and dry and you had to think about it. There was layered</p>
<p>And for sure, he&rsquo;s totally lost it totally totally lost</p>
<p>Well, if you know and then and then and then I thought stewart came out swinging hard</p>
<p>I do think though sax you have to agree</p>
<p>Did it seem to you though?</p>
<p>Like stewart had not like he just needed more human to human interaction. Absolutely. He was a caged tiger, man</p>
<p>He was a caged tiger. They let him out. He was like, you know going off. Absolutely</p>
<p>But it was the funniest thing john stewart&rsquo;s done in many years and the reason is because</p>
<p>He connected with the fact that here is this obvious thing that we&rsquo;re not allowed to say</p>
<p>And that is what comics should be doing. Yes, put a light on it</p>
<p>I mean if comedy is tragedy plus time, I think that this is a great moment for us to</p>
<p>Reflect on like I think we&rsquo;re gonna go back to normal pretty quick</p>
<p>Um, if you remember after 9 11, there was this idea that comedy was over forever</p>
<p>You were not going to be able to make fun of things and that this was the end of satire people were this is you know</p>
<p>Um a bridge too far etc. And I think we&rsquo;re back. We&rsquo;re back and that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>You know, we can joke about the coronavirus we can talk about it</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to censor people for having an opinion. We&rsquo;re all adults here</p>
<p>um, you know the idea that</p>
<p>You know, we have to take down people&rsquo;s tweets because they have some crazy theory or put a label on them</p>
<p>Like we went a little crazy during the pandemic</p>
<p>And tried to stifle discussions for what reason?</p>
<p>Exactly. Like when we look back on this, it&rsquo;s gonna look really strange that we</p>
<p>Demanded that we put labels on people questioning or having a debate including doctors</p>
<p>Doctors were not allowed to debate</p>
<p>to the public on youtube or twitter about</p>
<p>Uh, what was the drug that trump kept promoting?</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine chloroquine like remember that whole chloroquine. I think this uh,</p>
<p>Ivermectin or whatever it is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just triggering people because it feels like that last drug</p>
<p>Which is a drug that may or may not work to slow down the progression of covid</p>
<p>But anyway, this is all over if you haven&rsquo;t gotten your goddamn vaccine, please get it. Stop denying science</p>
<p>Stop denying science and climate change climate change is not real</p>
<p>Oh my god, the youtube just canceled their account javad. What are you doing?</p>
<p>We talk about science as if science is a definitive answer to a question</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a process a process by which you come to answers you test them and look hydroxychloroquine may have been completely wrong</p>
<p>But let the debate happen. The answers came out. Anyway, i&rsquo;ll tell you a fundamental premise of science. It&rsquo;s a challenge assumptions</p>
<p>and so when you challenge, um</p>
<p>An existing hypothesis or kind of an existing thing that we hold to be true</p>
<p>You are engaging in science and the rigorous debate around what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work was notably absent over the past year</p>
<p>Because everything became about the political truth</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either true or you&rsquo;re false based on your political orientation and we reduced everything down to kind of this one</p>
<p>Politics this one-dimensional framework, which we have a tendency</p>
<p>Let me just point this out to you guys. I was going to mention this a few weeks ago</p>
<p>But like think about every conversation you have</p>
<p>how um common it is now to immediately think about what the person on the other side that you&rsquo;re talking to just said</p>
<p>And then trying to put them on a blue or red spectrum</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve all kind of been reprogrammed over the past decade or so</p>
<p>Where it used to be about the topic itself?</p>
<p>And the objective truth finding or the or the specifics of what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s become about you immediately try and resolve them to being conservative or</p>
<p>Or not red or blue trump or not purple</p>
<p>And so every conversation you kind of try and orient around that simple</p>
<p>Ridiculous one-dimensional framework and it&rsquo;s a complete loss of the discovery of objective truth in all matters in life</p>
<p>And all matters in that affect all of us</p>
<p>Um, and it&rsquo;s uh, it&rsquo;s really quite uh stark and sad. This is why we need a new</p>
<p>Political party the reason party. I think it&rsquo;s less about that</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more about everyone just reorienting themselves when you have a conversation just notice yourself doing it</p>
<p>And then recognize that maybe that&rsquo;s not the way to make a decision about the conversation or about having an opinion or a point of</p>
<p>View but have an opinion or a point of view about the topic itself</p>
<p>Not about the orientation of the topic on a on a single dimensional spectrum</p>
<p>And then layer identity politics into that so not only your politics</p>
<p>But your gender your race your sexual preference the color of your skin</p>
<p>and now how is anybody supposed to have a reasonable argument when I have to process like</p>
<p>Oh chamath&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>You know sri lanka, but he went through canada and he worked for I mean, it&rsquo;s well</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so reductive that no one gets</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so reductive that no one gets to have an identity anymore</p>
<p>Right because we we are all complex and all issues are complex and they are all nuanced</p>
<p>And when you reduce everything down to kind of this one-dimensional framework</p>
<p>You lose any ability to have depth to have nuance to have said another way the issues are complex enough</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to put identity politics or political, you know leanings on top of it</p>
<p>All right, so we had the worst fire season, uh in california ever last year</p>
<p>Obviously as chamath said global warming is a conspiracy</p>
<p>um by the chinese, uh as per your guy trump, uh sacks and uh</p>
<p>There is climate change in switzerland. There is a center called the center for climate change</p>
<p>There is a reason that there&rsquo;s climate change in switzerland. It&rsquo;s coming from that lab. Ah, the center did it</p>
<p>Look at the side</p>
<p>Look at the side. It says</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting paid to propagate this conspiracy theory. Yeah. Uh, all right, so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s going to be the worst</p>
<p>Well, we are at risk more than ever right? So we&rsquo;re entering june</p>
<p>So as of june 1st, the california snowpack is down to zero percent of normal. That&rsquo;s never happened before</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the lowest it&rsquo;s ever been there. There is absolutely like no snowpack in the entire sierra in the entire state</p>
<p>40 of the state is in a state of extreme drought right now</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had 16 000 acres burned as of a few weeks ago up from 3600 during the same time period the same day of the year</p>
<p>last year</p>
<p>um, and so the the tinder is there now remember</p>
<p>uh last year was the highest um</p>
<p>Uh california has ever seen we burnt 4 million acres</p>
<p>Uh last year california has about 33 million acres of farmland of forest land representing about a third of our total land size in the state</p>
<p>Um, you know 60 of that land is federal 40 is private</p>
<p>um, and so the the big kind of variable drivers this year are going to be um,</p>
<p>You know a wind and heat and we&rsquo;re already seeing a few heat waves</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the wind that kind of kicks these things off, but the tinder is there right? So like the state is dry</p>
<p>um, the uh, the the the snowpack is gone. We&rsquo;re on severe water restrictions in a lot of counties throughout the state</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s worth I think talking about the carbon effect, you know last year</p>
<p>Um based on the forests that burnt in california</p>
<p>Uh, we released about one and a half times as much carbon into the atmosphere from our forest fires as we did from</p>
<p>cars burning fossil fuels in the state</p>
<p>um, and so</p>
<p>Wow, so here&rsquo;s some statistics for you guys, which I think are just worth highlighting</p>
<p>Um, there&rsquo;s about 2 billion metric tons of carbon stored in california forest land, which is about 60 tons per acre</p>
<p>um, so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>About 9 million new tons of carbon sequestered per uh</p>
<p>In california by our forest land per year when there&rsquo;s a fire</p>
<p>We release about 10 tons per acre. So about one sixth of the carbon in that in that forest land</p>
<p>The rest of the carbon doesn&rsquo;t burn up</p>
<p>So remember when there&rsquo;s a forest fire typically the outside of the tree burns the whole thing doesn&rsquo;t burn to ash</p>
<p>And so a forest fire can actually if you look at the longitudinal kind of effect of it</p>
<p>burning forests</p>
<p>Can actually preserve the carbon sequestration activity versus, you know, just removing forest or removing trees</p>
<p>And so there is to some extent, um, you know an effort that has been shut down several times</p>
<p>Which is to do these kind of controlled burns through the state, but it&rsquo;s met with such resistance</p>
<p>Uh given that it&rsquo;s so controversial. No one wants to have smoke in their in their neighborhood</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be it shouldn&rsquo;t be controversial</p>
<p>The problem is you can&rsquo;t present simple data and have people have a logical conversation about it and the cost per acre</p>
<p>To clear land and farm to forest land in california is it ranges depending on the complexity of the land</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s somewhere between 50 and a thousand dollars. So call it a couple hundred dollars per acre</p>
<p>So you can very quickly kind of do the math on a carbon credit basis chamath. So it&rsquo;s about 40 bucks per ton</p>
<p>Uh for for carbon credit today</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually you know</p>
<p>You can kind of preserve about four hundred dollars per ten per ton by not putting carbon into the atmosphere</p>
<p>And if you can actually manage farmland forest land clearance and forest land preservation</p>
<p>Uh from fire at a cost of four hundred dollars or less and there was an active carbon credit market</p>
<p>You should be able to cover the cost of managing that forest land back</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re at incredibly high risk this year</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re necessarily going to have a fire because weather is the key driver</p>
<p>The weather is highly very wind we need wind we need wind and we need a heat wave with wind and then there will be</p>
<p>Fires, but then what do they do when the when the wind kicks up right now, uh, the electric company turns off power</p>
<p>In california because they don&rsquo;t want to be blamed when a power line goes down and starts a fire</p>
<p>So we have these regular moments. This is where we just lose power. Yeah, this is not just a california problem</p>
<p>I know everyone wants to beat up on california, but like the whole western us go look at google maps</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see how much green stuff there is on google maps. It&rsquo;s green up and down the western half of the u.s. Friedberg</p>
<p>It was trump, right that um raking up the forests, uh to put it in</p>
<p>Uh layman&rsquo;s terms or simple terms is an actual thing that helps 60 percent of forest land in california is uh federal land</p>
<p>And uh, it was the federal government&rsquo;s responsibility to manage that that cost down to manage that risk down. What is the incentive?</p>
<p>What is the motivation? You know, what are the key drivers? Those are obviously it does work to clear it though</p>
<p>It theoretically when you reduce the amount of tinder you will reduce the risk of a burn, right?</p>
<p>And so the cost but the cost of doing so as we mentioned it probably a couple hundred dollars per acre</p>
<p>And so who&rsquo;s gonna let&rsquo;s say you want to do that on five million acres, you know</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t this create a bunch of jobs? Oh, wait, we&rsquo;re paying people to stay home</p>
<p>Yeah, like it would create a ton of jobs. I mean, I hate to be like that guy, but like could we</p>
<p>Thirty five dollar an hour jobs for people i&rsquo;ve heard scuttlebutt that</p>
<p>Newsom is so worried about fire season that they&rsquo;re going to try and accelerate the recall election</p>
<p>So it happens before there was you know, the conventional wisdom the conventional wisdom would do that too. He&rsquo;s so smart</p>
<p>No, if chamat did it it would be strategic</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom was that you&rsquo;d want to wait as long as possible to do the recall because the longer you wait the longer</p>
<p>You get the rebound of the economy from kovid, right?</p>
<p>But now they&rsquo;re talking about accelerating it to beat fire season because it&rsquo;s looking really bad</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>That we needed much more aggressive forest management. It&rsquo;s not just climate change. It&rsquo;s also forest management</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do it in california anymore. And so I think we are in for a really hellish fire season</p>
<p>We are going to have a terrible we&rsquo;re going to have a terrible fire season</p>
<p>Um, there&rsquo;s going to be brownouts</p>
<p>Probably throughout a lot of the western states</p>
<p>What played out in texas that affected folks a few months ago, I think will</p>
<p>Some version of that will happen</p>
<p>in many places in the u.s. This is</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all roughly avoidable</p>
<p>And the critical principle act this year is the progressive left</p>
<p>They need to marry</p>
<p>Their disdain for climate change</p>
<p>And their disdain</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>Uh the things that need to happen to prevent it because right now these two things</p>
<p>For them are just like it&rsquo;s cataclysmically</p>
<p>not possible</p>
<p>um for us to agree on for example as friedberg says a controlled burn program</p>
<p>as a mechanism of sort of like fighting climate change or you know, investing more in</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>The greenification of the economy so that we can actually eliminate the use of a lot of these</p>
<p>Non-sustainable energy sources all these things basically just come down to a group of individuals</p>
<p>deciding</p>
<p>That they can both have an opinion on something as important as climate change</p>
<p>But then are also willing to then go and act right now. They won&rsquo;t until they do</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s just going to spill over everywhere</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a very bad fire season</p>
<p>And the only reason I know that it is is that every year before it has been every single year has gotten warmer</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not you don&rsquo;t need to be a genius here better. Yes, by the way</p>
<p>Let me just correct a statistic. I said because the statistic I gave was a few weeks ago</p>
<p>um, but as of today we are actually at the average, uh,</p>
<p>The historical average in terms of number of acres that are burnt in california as we have seen historically</p>
<p>I will also say that you know close to one sixth</p>
<p>of um california&rsquo;s, uh, uh, uh forest land burnt last year</p>
<p>So there is a tremendous amount of tinder that has been removed from the risk equation</p>
<p>And we typically burn about a million acres a year. I think we burnt like four million last a little over four million last year</p>
<p>so, you know as you look at the the cumulative kind of um reduction of burnable acres, we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>The good thing that&rsquo;s going on is we&rsquo;re actually at a lower risk scenario going into this year in terms of total amount of tinder</p>
<p>The risk of the tinder catching is higher because it&rsquo;s drier</p>
<p>NASA, but but when you add this all up, there&rsquo;s certainly a high probability of a bad fire season</p>
<p>But there could be a scenario here where we end up with less than a million</p>
<p>Zero scenario that&rsquo;s going to happen. NASA publishes temperature studies. They do measured</p>
<p>measurements of how</p>
<p>Uh much warming there is in the earth</p>
<p>Last year we set yet another record. It was the seventh year in a row where it was</p>
<p>Warmer than all the previous successive years. It&rsquo;s just going in the same place</p>
<p>I mean and so if we&rsquo;re all of a sudden supposed to bet</p>
<p>That a trend that has effectively been reliable for the last decade is going to turn</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not sure that that&rsquo;s a bet you&rsquo;d want to make</p>
<p>Or that the wind is not going to blow that</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to make that bet. I mean, this is like betting on a one-outer</p>
<p>We need we need we need the left to take control of this issue and solve it get ready for martian skies over</p>
<p>california</p>
<p>Literally i&rsquo;m thinking about an escape plan from california</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;m putting a generator in this month. I bought six new air filters, you know, like beautiful</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s not good enough</p>
<p>Well, I have my house is totally sealed and I have the air purifiers in I have a built-in air purifier for the house</p>
<p>And I have six portable ones in each every bedroom</p>
<p>Are you coming back in august?</p>
<p>Uh in at the end of august, but by the way, let me let me tell you where it really the rubber meets the road</p>
<p>Uh, just again</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking to the progressive left. They care apparently so much</p>
<p>About minorities. I just want to make sure you guys understand that, you know air quality</p>
<p>disproportionately affects minorities why</p>
<p>Because we are not not me anymore, but you know minorities are the ones that typically live near</p>
<p>industrial output near transportation through ways and thoroughfares</p>
<p>Yeah, it is it is statistically proven that blacks brown other minority people are the worst people to suffer from</p>
<p>Respiratory diseases and airborne illnesses and these are things that are that are happening today</p>
<p>So again, I want to go back to the same group of individuals who apparently believe in climate change</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t believe in nuclear. They don&rsquo;t believe in control burns</p>
<p>They believe in inequality, but they don&rsquo;t want to do what&rsquo;s necessary to regulate emission</p>
<p>What are we doing guys?</p>
<p>Just at some point do the job do the job. I think do your fucking job</p>
<p>I I what you&rsquo;re saying is correct your mouth</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a sad statement about the progressive left that the only way to reach them through an argument is to argue for</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a disparate impact on a minority. The reality affects all americans. Yes, exactly. Exactly</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad red pill. Give me those red pills. Come on</p>
<p>Come on, sacks. You&rsquo;re holding out. No, but but</p>
<p>But chamath understands that audience. He is making the argument</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to respond to but the argument that they and everyone should be responding to is</p>
<p>Inequality is bad for everybody the planet all humans. Exactly. What are you guys going to do for fire season?</p>
<p>Do you actually i&rsquo;m thinking about renting a house?</p>
<p>Like I rented a house in chicago and lake michigan last year and I went there and it was a great escape for a month</p>
<p>To get away from fire season</p>
<p>But I I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m very scared to be in california during all of this to be completely honest with you</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just want to be there. Um, yeah, i&rsquo;m out</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try to figure out some come back in uh late of august and hopefully everything has calmed down by then</p>
<p>Although it won&rsquo;t because it gets very very hot at the end of august</p>
<p>September was the heart of it. It&rsquo;s typically the heart of it part of it</p>
<p>Jake, how do you think you&rsquo;re gonna go to miami or austin or something?</p>
<p>you know, I I I went back to austin for a wedding and uh, I met the governor, um, and</p>
<p>Uh, don&rsquo;t care you went this wedding and you met</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>You gotta beep that out you went to</p>
<p>Sweating about the governor. Yes. Um and</p>
<p>going to austin</p>
<p>In 2021 is like when I would come to san francisco and go to the battery</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>2003 and sack</p>
<p>2013 and sacks would say why don&rsquo;t you live here?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much going on in san francisco come to san francisco and I did</p>
<p>Uh, and I I got the last five years of the peak but uh, austin very appealing to me</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve been looking at beach houses in um, miami and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, uh, i&rsquo;m 50 of the way there folks. Oh my god. I mean the fact that you can now buy a beach house. I mean</p>
<p>God bless america</p>
<p>God bless america</p>
<p>And I forgot that I convinced you to move up to san francisco yet another way in which I</p>
<p>Have contributed to the monster your career towards. Absolutely. Absolutely. Okay. I&rsquo;m gonna use call-in every day</p>
<p>call-in syndicates underway</p>
<p>Everything you wouldn&rsquo;t even be a vc if it wasn&rsquo;t for me. You&rsquo;d still be a media figure. That&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be doing conference producing you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you and naval really pushed me towards it and then special</p>
<p>Thank you to you and chamath, uh billy</p>
<p>Uh for anchoring, uh, and dave goldberg. We love you. We love you. You know what?</p>
<p>I mean, I I tweeted the other day</p>
<p>At the end of the day</p>
<p>You know our lives are a collection when we look back on them of memories with our friends</p>
<p>And you know, I include family and friends</p>
<p>And this podcast not to get all gushy and and whatever is uh been a delight over the you know</p>
<p>Really hard pandemic that&rsquo;s now ending and it&rsquo;s I just i&rsquo;m really happy that we get to spend this time every week together every week</p>
<p>I get uh, you know a little bit of excitement</p>
<p>Uh, like I used to get when we go you host poker, uh sacks or chamath, you know those days when we&rsquo;d have a poker game</p>
<p>Uh sky dayton would tell me and you know, uh, I I get a little tingly feeling</p>
<p>Uh, like oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna see my friends tonight and play poker and laugh</p>
<p>And you know</p>
<p>We got that amazing note from the woman who said she was really having a hard time during the pandemic and that the podcast</p>
<p>All on podcast really helped her and you know shout out to sam. Thanks for that. Yeah, sam that really made our week. So shout out sam</p>
<p>Um, that was amazing long way of saying I love you sax. Well, I love you</p>
<p>Jake you are the stephen colbert to my john stewart</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the opposite. I think you know, I I have to call I have to come on your show and red pill you</p>
<p>And make sure that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re saying the truth and not getting too wrapped up in your trump derangement syndrome or whatever</p>
<p>at the end of the day</p>
<p>You know, we we are I think all of us working through</p>
<p>Complex issues to friedberg. I really loved your contribution today about how complex these issues are and layering more complexity onto them</p>
<p>Of our identities our wealth</p>
<p>You know our histories immigrants not whatever politics</p>
<p>These issues are so hard and in some ways also so easy with technology and world-class execution</p>
<p>That the world needs to have more reasonable conversations</p>
<p>And I think that what we&rsquo;ve demonstrated here is that four friends can have reasonable discussions and laugh about life and enjoy life</p>
<p>And that should be for everybody listening. That&rsquo;s what sam said in her note to us, which was very heartwarming. So thank you</p>
<p>Yeah, that was great. Yeah, I mean love you guys. Love you sax</p>
<p>Jesus fucking asperger</p>
