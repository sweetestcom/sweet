<p>Ôªøhey guys you hear me</p>
<p>right
awesome so as people are logging on I</p>
<p>saw a couple questions they&rsquo;re just
going to be recorded absolutely</p>
<p>absolutely
oh that&rsquo;s the one to make sure this</p>
<p>sound thing is working was working
before testing one two there we go how</p>
<p>was that
was that better how&rsquo;s that can you hear me</p>
<p>now yeah I just saw that I had it
muffled good great awesome okay we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get started guys um welcome
this is the first seminar of a series of</p>
<p>three seminars and I&rsquo;m going to break
down the endocrine system and try to</p>
<p>make it as simple as possible and what
we&rsquo;re going to do is it probably will</p>
<p>ask questions as we go through but
there&rsquo;s so many people on that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be hard to go back and forth I
won&rsquo;t get anything done um so this is</p>
<p>going to be recorded no problem and then
I&rsquo;m going to to make it really easy I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to send you the notes in the
morning so you have all the notes</p>
<p>because somehow I I don&rsquo;t think I could
send it with an attachment I have to</p>
<p>send it to your email so I want to send
the notes to everyone who watches this</p>
<p>now to the people registered who didn&rsquo;t
sign on so whoever&rsquo;s on this webinar</p>
<p>will get the notes as well okay now
here&rsquo;s the problem the problem and when</p>
<p>you go to a health care practitioner or
even a doctor is they&rsquo;ll look at your</p>
<p>blood test and they&rsquo;re going to look at
oh you have this deficiency of hormone</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s go ahead and give you a
hormone okay I like the thyroid hormone</p>
<p>or maybe growth hormone or maybe
estrogen or testosterone by identical</p>
<p>hormones the problem with that is that
every time you take a hormone you</p>
<p>inactivate the gland
that makes that hormone so you weaken</p>
<p>the system over time and then you become
more dependent on that format but they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really look at the whole picture
they don&rsquo;t look at what&rsquo;s behind it so I</p>
<p>want to really touch on that so the
first part of the seminar is just to</p>
<p>kind of give you an overview of the
endocrine system as a whole so you can</p>
<p>understand it and think with it
and then I&rsquo;m going to dive into parts of</p>
<p>the under consistent in this section and
then next week in the following week</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very large topic and I am
basically have too much information of</p>
<p>course in this presentation I&rsquo;m going to
try to cut it down I always have too</p>
<p>much information so I don&rsquo;t want to
overwhelm you with data so I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>try to kind of take bits and pieces that
are important and practical and things</p>
<p>that you can apply I want to talk about
the parts of inter consistent that show</p>
<p>up the most and then show you how you
can use this like for example with your</p>
<p>fatigue what hormone is that what&rsquo;s
wrong with that how can we get more</p>
<p>energy that type of thing so I want to
make it right</p>
<p>you know applicable to you and not just
kind of go through hormones for the sake</p>
<p>of understanding hormones so there&rsquo;s so
many different hormones you&rsquo;ll just like</p>
<p>go to sleep if I cover all of them so
we&rsquo;re going to cover all the different</p>
<p>glands but we&rsquo;re going to kind of give
you a summary and I&rsquo;m going to dive into</p>
<p>very specific things that I think are
important so in this presentation we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to definitely talk about the
adrenal and also the pancreas but as it</p>
<p>relates to other thing because it&rsquo;s when
you have one hormone it can affect this</p>
<p>and this Anessa you&rsquo;ll see as we go
through this so let&rsquo;s see here um what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do is I&rsquo;m going to open up
my powerpoint presentation let me go</p>
<p>right up here and pull it up for you</p>
<p>okay good now let me just there we go
perfect all right so the endocrine</p>
<p>system what is it it&rsquo;s basically a
communication system and the nervous</p>
<p>system is a communication system the
difference between the endocrine system</p>
<p>and the nervous system is that the
antico system uses hormones to</p>
<p>communicate through the blood and what
happens is that the glands are unique in</p>
<p>that they make hormones but organs
typically don&rsquo;t make hormones some of</p>
<p>them do so that would be the difference
between a gland and an organ glands make</p>
<p>hormones now what&rsquo;s a hormone a hormone
is a chemical message it&rsquo;s a trigger</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a communication it&rsquo;s sent from one
place to another so the whole thing</p>
<p>about hormones is that and glands is
that it&rsquo;s trying to create an effect at</p>
<p>a distance so the gland makes a
communication it&rsquo;s sent over across the</p>
<p>body through the blood and it kind of
connects into the cell like a radio wave</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re in your car and you turn
the radio and you can tune in different</p>
<p>stations and cheer different music the
exact same thing with the body so that</p>
<p>hormone has a might have like 15
functions but if it connects into for</p>
<p>example let&rsquo;s say estrogen connects into
the ovary it&rsquo;s going to tell the ovary</p>
<p>to release an egg or make an egg okay
but let&rsquo;s say that estrogen goes to your</p>
<p>hips it might say to make fat so the
purpose of a hormone is to create</p>
<p>trigger something in the called a target
organ or the endpoint and it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>group of cells that have already
pre-programmed functions and so</p>
<p>basically hormone triggers these this
little program but then the cell does</p>
<p>the work okay and then once it does the
the work</p>
<p>then what happens is that what happens
is that the cell then basically</p>
<p>activates the function does the work and
then sends another signal back up to the</p>
<p>original gland to tell it to turn off
the message so we constantly have this</p>
<p>on/off switch on/off switch back and
forth back and forth so you can see it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little bit of a communication cycle
now this is what the connector looks</p>
<p>like the receptor in the cell receives
the hormone and then what happens is</p>
<p>that that hormone once it&rsquo;s received
activates a whole chain reaction of</p>
<p>things so and that&rsquo;s important because
you have like tons and tons and tons of</p>
<p>little receptors in the glands that can
receive hormones the problem is that</p>
<p>these receptors can get blocked they can
get interfere with they can get blocked</p>
<p>with chemicals that mimic hormones they
can get just downgraded and they just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work anymore like in insulin like
if you have a high level of a hormone</p>
<p>over a period of time like let&rsquo;s say you
have insulin that&rsquo;s high that because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating too much sugar that
receptor that receives insulin is going</p>
<p>to stop receiving it okay so it&rsquo;s just
kind of like if let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>married and your husband&rsquo;s there and you
let&rsquo;s say the wife tells the husband</p>
<p>take the garbage out right and he
doesn&rsquo;t comply with that the wife might</p>
<p>continue to communicate in a higher
volume and if the if the that message is</p>
<p>ignored so anytime a message is ignored
the the communicator it starts to</p>
<p>increase more volume and so this is what
happens in in diabetes is that you have</p>
<p>all this excess hormone that&rsquo;s not
getting in to the cells it&rsquo;s not getting</p>
<p>into the blood and so you have something
called insulin resistance where you have</p>
<p>symptoms of high hormone on one side and
low hormone on the other side and so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really you test the blood you have
all this insolent</p>
<p>is not working okay so it really has to
deal with the communication one part of</p>
<p>the body is just is rejecting or not
wanting to listen and so there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>more more shouting so I guess it would
be really similar to here talk to</p>
<p>someone who just will not stop talking
they just go on and on and on and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing that because they&rsquo;re not
really being listened to</p>
<p>so really the same thing happens in the
body so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what receptor is</p>
<p>and then we have the last piece of the
puzzle that&rsquo;s called the hormone</p>
<p>feedback loop so in the body you have
these circuits which means circle or</p>
<p>connectors it starts at the brain and it
comes down into the body at different</p>
<p>levels and it&rsquo;s a chain reaction of
communications and so once let&rsquo;s say the</p>
<p>brain tells the thyroid what to do
once that&rsquo;s complied with a signal is</p>
<p>sent back to turn off that communication
so it&rsquo;s a very complex but very simple</p>
<p>because if you look at like your blood
test let&rsquo;s say you have high levels of a</p>
<p>certain hormone then you can kind of see
what&rsquo;s happening the feedback loops are</p>
<p>not getting around where it&rsquo;s not coming
around and completing the circuit to</p>
<p>turn it off it&rsquo;s very similar to when
you talk to someone if they acknowledge</p>
<p>you then you feel heard and then you can
stop talking okay so same thing in the</p>
<p>body now here&rsquo;s this this is interesting
did you realize that hormones are made</p>
<p>out of protein and cholesterol that&rsquo;s
right so your hormones are made from</p>
<p>cholesterol and this is what I want to I
want to kind of talk about this because</p>
<p>I become some people freak out about
cholesterol and they&rsquo;re like oh my gosh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so bad and everything but did you
realize that every single cell in your</p>
<p>body makes cholesterol your body makes
3,000 milligrams of cholesterol every</p>
<p>single day your liver makes 2,000 so the
rest of the body makes another thousand</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s 3,000 milligrams of
cholesterol and I basically just figured</p>
<p>out how much cholesterol that is four
sticks of butter 14 eggs or 333 strips</p>
<p>of bacon that&rsquo;s how much cholesterol
your body makes that&rsquo;s incredible so the</p>
<p>next time you&rsquo;re at your doctor&rsquo;s office
and he says oh we got to get you</p>
<p>cholesterol down ask them well if the
cholesterol is so bad why does the body</p>
<p>make so much why does it make 3,000
milligrams of cholesterol and just see</p>
<p>what they say because the cholesterol is
on a feedback loop too so if you</p>
<p>actually eat less your body makes more
if you eat more your body will make less</p>
<p>I eat a tremendous amount of cholesterol
my diet I do four eggs every single day</p>
<p>I do cheese I do bacon you don&rsquo;t have to
do that but what&rsquo;s happening is my body</p>
<p>my liver doesn&rsquo;t have to make as much
cholesterol but I have people that have</p>
<p>no cholesterol in the diet and their
cholesterol is off off the charts simply</p>
<p>because your body is trying to make more
and so especially all the different</p>
<p>steroid hormones the ones that actually
are the adrenal hormones or even the</p>
<p>thyroid hormones I&rsquo;m not talking just
about bodybuilding I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>most a lot of the hormones that are that
you&rsquo;re dealing with right now are</p>
<p>steroid hormones and they&rsquo;re all made
from cholesterol so when you&rsquo;re under</p>
<p>stress are you going to menopause huh
you better have the raw material to make</p>
<p>these hormones um so give you so give me
some cholesterol facts um consuming</p>
<p>cholesterol has never had been proven to
cause heart disease um you might want to</p>
<p>write this guy&rsquo;s name down um
he&rsquo;s amazing researcher he wrote a book</p>
<p>on cholesterol myths and he is like
seriously um like researched and he</p>
<p>basically he does massive research in
the literature and he condensed all the</p>
<p>studies and he got actually shows you
what they say in a simple way</p>
<p>fascinating so there&rsquo;s two things one is
that consuming cholesterol does not</p>
<p>cause heart disease and then consuming
cholesterol does not increase your</p>
<p>cholesterol that&rsquo;s amazing this is the
opposite of what we&rsquo;ve been taught I</p>
<p>mean even Time magazine said it&rsquo;s okay
to eat butter so we know it&rsquo;s true right</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being very sarcastic um so a lot of
the studies have been altered long ago</p>
<p>back in the 50s and 60s and and and some
of these current researchers that hold</p>
<p>on to this cholesterol idea idea they
just they can&rsquo;t be wrong so they have to</p>
<p>be right so what they&rsquo;ll do is they will
maintain this viewpoint and they won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look at the actual information so
they&rsquo;re very closed-minded and they have</p>
<p>a lot of fixed ideas but you&rsquo;ll have to
prove it to yourself really what</p>
<p>increases the cholesterol is the refined
sugars and the carbohydrates okay now</p>
<p>before I get into the summary the</p>
<p>summary of um the endocrine system I
just want to kind of scan to see if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s I always want to make sure that
people people can hear me and let me</p>
<p>just see here</p>
<p>okay okay so I&rsquo;m assuming you guys can
see those slides and I tell you what I</p>
<p>will send you the slides how about that
okay yeah because it could be kind of</p>
<p>small on your computer I&rsquo;ll send you the
slides all right I just want to see if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any questions now I&rsquo;m going to
open up something here so I can see your</p>
<p>questions a little bit better okay the
book okay so people are asking me what</p>
<p>is the book called the book is called a
cholesterol mist and yes I can see the</p>
<p>problem is so tiny you can&rsquo;t even see it
so I&rsquo;ll actually you can search this</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s name that out copy this into let
me just do this right now copy the guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>name right here and so I just pasted it
for everyone to see and you can look</p>
<p>them up later okay the point is that um
there&rsquo;s a lot of great um substantial</p>
<p>credible science scientific people that
are very sane that actually will alone</p>
<p>will show you the truth about the whole
cholesterol and you don&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>freaked out about it all right um
someone asked about what if I&rsquo;m holding</p>
<p>fluid okay I&rsquo;m going to talk about fluid
retention absolutely um let&rsquo;s see can</p>
<p>you address menopause
we&rsquo;re going to touch on some we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to touch on hot flashes a little touch
more menopause as we go through this um</p>
<p>okay how do bioidentical hormones work
with hormone balance good question</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the problem with bioidentical
hormones</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against them I just like to try
everything we can before you go I</p>
<p>bioidentical because what&rsquo;s happening is
you&rsquo;re taking hormones you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>feel better but your glands are going to
not have to work as hard and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to slowly inactivate your glands
which means that you&rsquo;re going to need</p>
<p>more and more hormone over time to the
point where it potentially it could stop</p>
<p>working so you know that&rsquo;s just my
viewpoint so I&rsquo;m not against you taking</p>
<p>them as long as you you can actually try
to first try to improve the gland</p>
<p>function because why don&rsquo;t we just fix
the gland there&rsquo;s a lot of things you</p>
<p>can do primarily for the gland itself
and we will cover some of those items</p>
<p>alright a lot of really good questions</p>
<p>some questions that are not really
related to what we&rsquo;re talking about but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get to some of these if I
can okay but very good questions I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to save a lot of these questions
too because I can see that there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of specific things that you guys want to
know about that pertain to your bodies</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll actually try to incorporate
that into the next seminar okay all</p>
<p>right yeah
post menopause so I&rsquo;m going to cover</p>
<p>that whole thing but let me just kind of
give you a summary of what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>okay with the endocrine system let me
just pull this thing up here and here we</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s start at the top with the
hypothalamus that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s this little</p>
<p>thing in the brain it&rsquo;s about the size
of a grape</p>
<p>now the hypothalamus is the is half
nervous system and half gland it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of small cells groups of cells all
combined that have very specific</p>
<p>functions like one little center would
cause um like your sex drive or your</p>
<p>stress response another one will be
fluid balance another one will be</p>
<p>sustained wakefulness another one would
be stimulating the gastrointestinal</p>
<p>system
shivering sweating blood pressure</p>
<p>maternal aggression protection so a
mother protecting their child right</p>
<p>feeding leptin that&rsquo;s the hormone that
is involved with with starvation and</p>
<p>hunger and things like that and the fat
makes it we&rsquo;ll get into that later lower</p>
<p>blood pressure their aging fighting
appetite water control and you actually</p>
<p>have a clock in your brain it&rsquo;s that
little Center has a name and called</p>
<p>super trasmit nuclei not that you need
to know that but that clock regulates</p>
<p>the timing mechanism and it syncs with
the rotation of the earth and the tides</p>
<p>and the Sun sun&rsquo;s light and darkness and
it&rsquo;s pretty cool so if you have sleeping</p>
<p>problems it could be a problem with that
area of the body and then we have sex</p>
<p>for most thermostat heart rate well this
little nuclei that is right to my left</p>
<p>right here that&rsquo;s involved in hot
flashes during menopause so the same</p>
<p>thing that controls thermostat is the
same thing that controls the heart rate</p>
<p>so that thing that&rsquo;s why your heart rate
kind of goes up but the hypothalamus has</p>
<p>all these prepreg up program things for
the brain and it&rsquo;s going to send the</p>
<p>message down it&rsquo;s kind of like the owner
of the football team it&rsquo;s or the owner</p>
<p>the CEO of a business and in this
message that goes from the hypothalamus</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several of them and it goes
right down to the pituitary</p>
<ul>
<li>cheering is kind of like uh management
it&rsquo;s like the coach of the football team</li>
</ul>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t do the work necessarily
buddies he actually works through other</p>
<p>people he takes the message from the
owner of the company or the the owner of</p>
<p>the football team and he translates that
translates that to the workers which are</p>
<p>the glands so the pituitary is the
middleman that kind of determines what</p>
<p>message goes where and you got a front
part in the back part of the pituitary</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the size of a pea it&rsquo;s really
small</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s hormones for your thyroid
your dream your ovary your liver your</p>
<p>breasts even the kidney ovary testicle
and so all these messages go down from</p>
<p>the pituitary and basically I want to
kind of cover some of these hormones</p>
<p>okay and give you a little summary right
now the first hormone one talked about</p>
<p>is something called growth hormone yes
it does make you grow if your child and</p>
<p>yes it&rsquo;s people buy it as an anti-aging
hormone and it&rsquo;s very expensive</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to take it because of those
major side effects if you take it</p>
<p>externally but it&rsquo;s an anti-aging
hormone in it it helps proteins build</p>
<p>and repair it helps you get lean body
mass and it&rsquo;s one of the major fat</p>
<p>burning hormones okay so it comes down
from the pituitary and it goes into the</p>
<p>liver and that&rsquo;s where it does its work
and really growth hormone doesn&rsquo;t do all</p>
<p>the work but it triggers another hormone
that does the work and if you want to</p>
<p>know the name of that one is called
insulin-like growth factor number one</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an IG F number one okay again you
don&rsquo;t really need to know that the name</p>
<p>just realize that IGF number one really
is an extension of growth hormone then</p>
<p>they work together and we&rsquo;ll be talking
more about this when we get into like</p>
<p>fat-burning
there&rsquo;s several things that trigger</p>
<p>growth hormone right especially if you
want to lose weight one is fasting</p>
<p>intermittent fasting that&rsquo;s a real
powerful trigger for growth hormone and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll cover that more later also a small
amount of protein will trigger growth</p>
<p>hormone not too much small amount and
then sleep will trigger it and intense</p>
<p>exercise will trigger it but there&rsquo;s
other things that block it like like</p>
<p>sugar like stress um sugar stress things
like that okay now we got the thyroid</p>
<p>hormone so the pituitary sends a signal
down to the thyroid tells it what to do</p>
<p>but really most of the thyroid hormone
comes out as an inactive form it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called t4 now the 4 and the 3
represent the number of iodine molecules</p>
<p>on that hormone so you get the t3 is 3 3
iodine and t4 is for iodine so so 80% of</p>
<p>the t4 is converted through the liver
and then 20% is converted through the</p>
<p>kidney and it&rsquo;s basically converted it
turns from t4 to t3 and now t3 is the</p>
<p>active form of the thyroid hormone and
that&rsquo;s where it controls the metabolism</p>
<p>also your hair nails collagen your skin
temperature digestion carbohydrate and</p>
<p>fat metabolism so the thyroid is
important we will be diving in deeper</p>
<p>probably next week on the thyroid but I
just you just need to know basically</p>
<p>what it does and just right here I want
to tell you some two things about the</p>
<p>thyroid hormone it&rsquo;s very rare to have a
primary thyroid problem it&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>secondary to a liver problem or an
estrogen problem from the ovary because</p>
<p>most people
have a problem with their lack of</p>
<p>conversion because either the gall
bladders blocked or missing or they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>constipated or they have liver problems
or fatty liver and that&rsquo;s why the fire</p>
<p>is not working and so every time they
take the thyroid hormone they don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>any results because the cause is in the
liver the other one is the estrogen</p>
<p>because estrogen has this thing where it
can get stuck in your thyroid and block</p>
<p>the thyroid and cause thyroid problem so
here&rsquo;s another indirect cause and here</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you get pregnant and you get this
massive dose of estrogen and then boom</p>
<p>your thyroid shuts down well that&rsquo;s you
got to fix the estrogen don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about the thyroid okay there&rsquo;s another
gland called the parathyroid basically</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just four tiny little glands
around the thyroid gland and that</p>
<p>controls calcium so when people have
their thyroid removed Wow</p>
<p>if you have your third move you better
make sure you keep your parathyroid</p>
<p>glands then we get to the adrenal glands</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure that if you watch my videos
you talk a lot about adrenal the adrenal</p>
<p>is unique and then it has an outside and
an inside the outside is all gland the</p>
<p>inside is all nerve tissue so it&rsquo;s
pretty cool and so it has functions from</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory effects to blood sugar
control to stress control hydration</p>
<p>control blood pressure control
cholesterol control and vitamin D</p>
<p>control so it does a lot the gonads
that&rsquo;s the ovary and the testicles so</p>
<p>the ovary is basically create female
characteristics um curvy your hips</p>
<p>thinner skin higher voice um where
whereas testosterone</p>
<p>gives the male characteristics facial
hair deeper voice things like that so</p>
<p>the ovary controls the menstrual cycle
through its hormones it makes eggs</p>
<p>controls fertility okay whereas the
testosterone produces helps produce the</p>
<p>sperm helps libido bone and muscle
influences and vitality okay then we get</p>
<p>the pancreas it controls blood sugars so
so you have another part of pancreas</p>
<p>that releases enzymes to help digest
food as well so if your pancreas is</p>
<p>dysfunctional you&rsquo;re gonna have a lot of
digestive problems and also diabetics</p>
<p>have a lot of digestive problems because
of the pancreas you can&rsquo;t have a bad</p>
<p>problem with the pancreas like insulin
and have a real happy enzymes that come</p>
<p>out and do all the great work of
digestion just when one goes down the</p>
<p>both they both go down okay now before
we get into this next topic I want to</p>
<p>make sure that I&rsquo;m answering questions
because we have to have I want to</p>
<p>actually have a two-way communication so
Karen says she has insomnia sleep apnea</p>
<p>I sleep for hours at night I stopped
sleeping and up all night fall asleep at</p>
<p>5:00 started to take supplements not
working I now take bioidentical hormones</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sleeping for hours but waking up
okay alright so let me do this hold on</p>
<p>one second</p>
<p>okay okay so um let&rsquo;s just touch on the
sleep right now okay the hormone that</p>
<p>triggers sleep problems let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s look
at this book right here this is that</p>
<p>this is an endocrine book right here and
there&rsquo;s a chapter here on the adrenal</p>
<p>gland
now the adrenal gland is a gland on top</p>
<p>of the Qt and it curled controls stress
but look at Laguna does especially</p>
<p>during menopause
instead of getting a deep deep sleep you</p>
<p>get a light sleep and that&rsquo;s because the
adrenal gland is too high it&rsquo;s like too</p>
<p>many hormones when the adrenal the
adrenal is the backup gland to lean over</p>
<p>so check this out these are your
adrenals</p>
<p>these are ovaries so during menopause
the ovaries go in retirement and the</p>
<p>adrenal actually has to back up the
ovary it&rsquo;s a backup organ so if your</p>
<p>adrenals are stressed out during
menopause it&rsquo;s going to and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to back it up so what&rsquo;s going to
happen it&rsquo;s going to stimulate something</p>
<p>right here and send signals up to the
brain and that little part that I showed</p>
<p>you that controls temperature and it&rsquo;s
going to send surges into the body and</p>
<p>cause hot flashes however this gland is
going to stress out during menopause and</p>
<p>be a little bit more energetic and so
the off switch is always on because this</p>
<p>is all this is all adrenaline here this
is flight-or-fight so it keeps your body</p>
<p>in a constant stress mode so you won&rsquo;t
be able to turn off and sleep there are</p>
<p>various things that you can do
nutritionally activation wise and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>show you some nutrition later but this
is a tool that can be gotten to and I</p>
<p>use this it goes right on the back of
the neck and you lean back and you hit</p>
<p>these two points that activate
the sleep centers that&rsquo;s one thing you</p>
<p>can do the other thing is you can do
acupressure on the adrenal glands as</p>
<p>well and that can be learned in my
little book here yeah there&rsquo;s a book</p>
<p>that you can get on the tool that shows
you how to do the adrenals so there are</p>
<p>actions that you can do to help sleep
but the cause of it is the adrenal okay</p>
<p>all right so I switched over the
messages to all private so only I can</p>
<p>see them so that way you guys can focus
a little bit better how about that I</p>
<p>think that will work out best all right
but I can still see your messengers um</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;m going to record this so
that&rsquo;s not going to be a problem someone</p>
<p>says where can I get the tool on the
website on my website dr. Berg calm um</p>
<p>all right so let&rsquo;s see here is there a
test for pancreatic problems</p>
<p>yes well the first thing you want to
test you can indirectly type the test</p>
<p>the pancreas by checking the blood
sugars and you can also do a test which</p>
<p>I think is invaluable and that would be
an insulin test you can also check Enza</p>
<p>enzyme test but I like to check the
insulin because you might have normal</p>
<p>blood sugars but your insulin is high
because you have a problem with the</p>
<p>insulin and that is a situation so I
think a lot of people have a problem</p>
<p>with insulin or they don&rsquo;t know and
that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to cover that today</p>
<p>okay so I&rsquo;m going to cover a very
important topic right now for you guys</p>
<p>and that is on this little thing called
electrolytes this is a very confusing</p>
<p>topic electro is a Latin word for Amber
because in the ancient times they would</p>
<p>take amber which is resin from the pine
tree and they would rub it on fur and it</p>
<p>generates this little static electricity
that you can take a feather and it</p>
<p>sticks to it so they call it electro and
then light is Greek word for loose so we</p>
<p>have this
this um kind of loose electrons that can</p>
<p>be generated in the body so let me just
show you I forgot to show you one thing</p>
<p>here I&rsquo;ll show you what electrolyte is
okay so we have some water right simple</p>
<p>water and we have some salt okay so I&rsquo;m
just going to take some salt and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to pour it in the water don&rsquo;t try
this at home</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding at a dry sensing one
I&rsquo;m just going to stir this up okay so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dissolving so the sodium chloride
and the other of minerals and this is</p>
<p>sea salt this is simulating salt are
disconnecting so now we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>sodium chloride together we have them
sodium chloride okay now this fluid is</p>
<p>now more electrically conductive so it
can conduct electricity so electrolytes</p>
<p>our minerals that are in a solution that
conduct electricity and it can generate</p>
<p>electricity okay so in your body your
cells are little batteries so the cells</p>
<p>use electrolytes to actually generate a
lot of your electricity and they have</p>
<p>little tiny electrolyte new minerals so
you have sodium you have potassium you</p>
<p>have calcium magnesium but the two big
ones that do most of the work are sodium</p>
<p>and potassium okay
sodium-potassium so there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>called the sodium and potassium pump and
it&rsquo;s in the membrane of the cell on the</p>
<p>outside so the cell is kind of like
distance sides which goes in and out</p>
<p>most of the goal of this this pump is to
keep the sodium on the outside of the</p>
<p>cell and keep the potassium on the
inside of the cell so when you keep two</p>
<p>different electrolytes separated like
that through a barrier you can create</p>
<p>electrical activity in charge so I let
these electrolytes this little sodium</p>
<p>potassium pump is there to generate
energy for you and to create something</p>
<p>called active transport which is
basically the ability to pull in</p>
<p>nutrients glucose amino acids vitamins
calcium controls calcium absorption so</p>
<p>it also helps generate energy so the
potassium pump you have like eight</p>
<p>hundred thousand to thirty million pumps
per cell and they&rsquo;re working hard in</p>
<p>fact they they use up 30% of your food
energy so they take a lot of energy to</p>
<p>work and so what happens is that those
little electrolytes that little pump is</p>
<p>working hard to give you energy so if
you&rsquo;re fatigued chances are those you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough of one of those
electrolytes so the reason why I talk</p>
<p>about electrolytes right now is because
the the biggest common problem that I</p>
<p>see with people is that they have an
electrolyte imbalance and it is related</p>
<p>to hormones and I&rsquo;ll show you that
related to one simple mineral okay and</p>
<p>that is well let me see if you can guess
can anyone guess what mineral is the</p>
<p>number one deficient mineral the mineral
that you need massive amounts but most</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t have in their body let&rsquo;s
see if you can guess what it is</p>
<p>okay so mrs. iodine magnesium magnesium
potassium calcium good so if you said</p>
<p>potassium you are correct
okay now potassium is kind of like the</p>
<p>most important electrolyte that you can
possibly have why because you need out</p>
<p>of all the vitamins and minerals and
everything you need the most potassium</p>
<p>out of anything anything at all you need
close to 5,000 milligrams per day of</p>
<p>potassium now why because it&rsquo;s essential
for this little pump so let me kind of</p>
<p>get into what this means and how you can
relate this to your own bodies okay so</p>
<p>this little electro of the sub sodium
potassium pump allows nutrition fluids</p>
<p>they go in and out of the body in other
cells it allows electrical activity go</p>
<p>through your nervous system and it
allows the muscles to work correctly</p>
<p>this is what it looks like right here so
we got the there&rsquo;s this content exchange</p>
<p>of these two minerals back and forth
back and forth and there&rsquo;s other pumps</p>
<p>too but this is like the main one that I
believe it&rsquo;s the biggest problem out</p>
<p>there right now especially for blood
pressure fluid retention and diabetes</p>
<p>okay so this is what it looks like and
you have a lot of these little pumps and</p>
<p>they create a lot of health for you if
you actually have enough of the mineral</p>
<p>now sodium is really really easy to get
and most people do not have a sodium</p>
<p>deficiency okay you have a potassium
deficiency so these little mineral</p>
<p>generator pumps convert chemical energy
into electrical energy and believe it or</p>
<p>not um
60% of your nerve cells use the sodium</p>
<p>potassium pumps and they basically need
a lot of energy to produce that so this</p>
<p>explains why
so many people have a nerve fatigue and</p>
<p>muscle fatigue okay it&rsquo;s because of this
and also even the calcium the calcium</p>
<p>that you use to help relax the muscles
it can&rsquo;t work if there&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>potassium
if this pump is not working interesting</p>
<p>so they control the energy in the cell
the muscle the nerve um blood pressure</p>
<p>nutrients in the cell fluid volume
calcium and hydration okay so let&rsquo;s take</p>
<p>a look at all the things that can create
a potassium deficiency or the effects of</p>
<p>the potassium deficiency first of all
you&rsquo;re going to prevent calcium from</p>
<p>being allowed for the muscles to relax
well guess what the arteries are muscles</p>
<p>they have contractile tissue and the
arteries will start to get tense from a</p>
<p>calcium problem and that&rsquo;s why they are
high blood pressure they have calcium</p>
<p>channel blockers so what&rsquo;s the solution
the solution is not to avoid salt like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re telling you it&rsquo;s to add
potassium to the diet not in a pill form</p>
<p>but through food or if we concentrate
okay I mean look at the sixty percent of</p>
<p>population adults have high blood
pressure that is insane it&rsquo;s so easy to</p>
<p>fix
also potassium efficiencies see</p>
<p>potassium is a relaxer of the body it
calms things down and then if you&rsquo;re low</p>
<p>on potassium you&rsquo;re automatically going
to have more sodium so you can have more</p>
<p>fluid because they work in a
teeter-totter effect low note low nerve</p>
<p>conduction that&rsquo;s a weak heart that&rsquo;s
arrhythmias that skip beats any type of</p>
<p>electrical problem with the heart I
recommend going with the potassium</p>
<p>sometimes magnesium as well low muscle
strength so this is interesting have you</p>
<p>ever like walked up the stairs and your
muscles kind of run out of endurance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a potassium deficiency now I&rsquo;ve
talked about the adrenal causing that</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll but that&rsquo;s really it boils
down to potassium deficiency so if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have endurance with your muscles
if you run it a gas and a cramp fast or</p>
<p>especially up incline you feel heavy
it&rsquo;s a potassium deficiency but the</p>
<p>biggest symptom would be fatigue people
are tired because they don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>electrical generators making the energy
for the cell so they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>tired because they don&rsquo;t have enough
potassium okay hearing loss is a</p>
<p>potassium deficiency because the hairs
on the inner ear need potassium you can</p>
<p>even actually have lowered mood like
depression from potassium or fluid</p>
<p>retention and this is it this is another
interesting thing too at aciem is needed</p>
<p>to generate stomach acids so if you
don&rsquo;t a potassium it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>release the acids in your stomach
amazing it okay interesting so here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>question I have for you what foods have
high in potassium does anyone know can</p>
<p>you tell me see if you can guess</p>
<p>bananas avocados green very good very
good you guys are smart</p>
<p>yeah very good yes so so potassium the
highest source of potassium is in B tops</p>
<p>the leaves of beets okay you have
potassium in all the leafy greens you</p>
<p>have potassium in seaweed in spinach yes
you have potassium in bananas but the</p>
<p>problem with bananas it&rsquo;s too high in
sugar okay</p>
<p>the problem with potassium in coconut
water it&rsquo;s too high in sugar</p>
<p>celery actually is a little bit lower on
potassium but avocados are huge now</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the next question how many cups
of salad you need to fulfil your</p>
<p>potassium requirement per day let&rsquo;s see
if you guys know this okay good you guys</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trekking with me seven eight ten
seven to ten very very well done someone</p>
<p>said to know a little more than that
okay here&rsquo;s the next question how many</p>
<p>cups of salad or vegetable do you
consume per day I want to know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually doing the seven or nine cups</p>
<p>okay someone said zero two six zero ten
not enough not enough three two four</p>
<p>okay cool alright not a problem
but what I want to impress on you is the</p>
<p>importance of why you&rsquo;re doing the salad
not just for potassium but for all the</p>
<p>nutrients but if for your own energy
level</p>
<p>prevent blood pressure and you&rsquo;re going
to see it&rsquo;s also going to prevent blood</p>
<p>blood sugar problems and blood pressure
problems and it&rsquo;s going to give your</p>
<p>cells that work materials to build the
sodium potassium pump so you have more</p>
<p>basically I&rsquo;m trying to find my better
my cell phone battery here my we charger</p>
<p>you need this is more with chargers okay
so then you can actually start building</p>
<p>things up um now let me show you my
salad okay what I you guys want to see</p>
<p>that let&rsquo;s see here um right there good</p>
<p>alright oh I forgot something why are we
so deficient yes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not eating of salad that&rsquo;s true
low dietary potassium but it can also be</p>
<p>because your dream ills are stressed out
it can also be because the thyroid is</p>
<p>not working do you know the thyroid
actually controls the production of</p>
<p>those little sodium potassium pumps so
it could be you just don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>so but we&rsquo;re going to assume that you
have enough okay check this out drinking</p>
<p>too much water also depletes your
electrolytes and this is interesting</p>
<p>because I people fight me at a fight me
honest even on live TV shows they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>call in a dietician will say oh yeah
you&rsquo;re going to drink so much water</p>
<p>yeah just flushing on your potassium out
drink when you&rsquo;re thirsty alcohol will</p>
<p>block but deplete potassium surgery will
deplete potassium that&rsquo;s why when they</p>
<p>do a surgery they give you a potassium
IV because of the trauma on the adrenal</p>
<p>this dumps all the potassium caffeine a
diuretic diarrhea vomiting sweating all</p>
<p>will deplete potassium sugar will do it
having insulin resistance that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>a pre-diabetic State will do it because
insulin triggers this little pump to</p>
<p>push the sugar into the cell so if
you&rsquo;re missing potassium insulin has and</p>
<p>you have insulin resistance oh my gosh
your cells are</p>
<p>really really really really depleted
okay so check this out this is how many</p>
<p>cups of salad you would need this is how
many avocados this is how many bananas</p>
<p>you would need okay but this is my salad
um now I have an entire avocado on there</p>
<p>I have some tomatoes at peppers and I
have probably about 8 cups of salad okay</p>
<p>and avocado so heavy it&rsquo;s waiting down
the salad this is a typical thing that I</p>
<p>do twice a day
I have probably more salad than most</p>
<p>people most most vegetarians okay okay
so now we talked about potassium but now</p>
<p>the question is what about hydration
like your tissue hydration just water</p>
<p>really hydrate you know it&rsquo;s
electrolytes that do you know you need</p>
<p>some water
but it&rsquo;s the electrolytes so I want you</p>
<p>guys to do a quick test to determine and
just so you know I&rsquo;m going to give you</p>
<p>the slides I&rsquo;m going to give you the
recording because somehow I think</p>
<p>somehow the when you&rsquo;re watching this
live it&rsquo;s kind of blocked you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>able to see it all the time okay so I
will give you the slides no worry about</p>
<p>them okay so this is what I want you to
do with your your back of your palm I</p>
<p>want you to pinch your skin like this
pinch it good and then I want you to let</p>
<p>it go and I want you to count how many
seconds it takes to to disappear back at</p>
<p>your hand okay go ahead and do that
right now pinch your back of your skin</p>
<p>and just let it go down and see him like
do this right here and count how long it</p>
<p>takes to go back into your your body it
should be within one less than one</p>
<p>second if it&rsquo;s there two or three or
four seconds it stays there you have a</p>
<p>serious electrolyte problem okay you
serious electrolyte problem and your</p>
<p>tissues are completely dehydrated okay
the way we&rsquo;re going to fix that is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a lot more
potassium and what that&rsquo;s going to do</p>
<p>with your skin like I&rsquo;m 51 years old I
know a lot of 51 year olds that look old</p>
<p>I think because they need more salad
because your skin the hydration the</p>
<p>potassium the electrolytes are essential
for healthy skin so if you have a</p>
<p>problem with that just work on that you
can keep testing that to have more</p>
<p>hydration into the tissues okay let me
just make sure I&rsquo;m answering any other</p>
<p>questions right here um let&rsquo;s see here</p>
<p>okay all right awesome now um let me go
back to the salad thing alright okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my salad the other thing that I
take is I take wheatgrass juice powder</p>
<p>now let me just explain something I
don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw in my last</p>
<p>video that I did with my wife on
wheatgrass it&rsquo;s kind of comical you</p>
<p>should check it out you can go to you my
youtube and just check for wheat grass</p>
<p>the most recent one but I want to show I
want to show you something here I just</p>
<p>want to show you something on wheat
grass this is the this is kind of what I</p>
<p>take I don&rsquo;t know if you can see that
maybe that you can&rsquo;t really see that let</p>
<p>me see this is some seriously dark green
aromatic raw</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s heated over 106 degrees the
wheatgrass juice is grown on ancient</p>
<p>seabeds in Utah which is basically an
old ocean floor so the poles in all the</p>
<p>trace moves
this is not a wheatgrass powder it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder and a lot of you
are already taking it and so what you do</p>
<p>is you mix this with water and I take
probably two teaspoons a day that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need more and for energy if I
don&rsquo;t take this I&rsquo;m not as energetic and</p>
<p>its really the potassium in here because
one teaspoon is equivalent to a trea 17</p>
<p>by 17 inches of wheatgrass so you&rsquo;re
getting a food base now I it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>extra I&rsquo;m doing enough salary I probably
don&rsquo;t need that but this gives me some a</p>
<p>lot of micro concentrated greens and
blood of other nutrition but mainly I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the electrolyte balance that
helps me the most because it builds up</p>
<p>my sodium potassium pump allows the
everything to go through so the people</p>
<p>that I have on that are starting to
notice more and more energy but the</p>
<p>point is that people that are fatigued
one-for-one you ask them how much</p>
<p>saladin doing how much green are you
doing how much potassium it&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>like small amounts if you go by
potassium which I never agree on a</p>
<p>recommend um it comes in 90 milligram
tablets you need 4700 milligrams</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to have a whole bottle of
that stuff so it&rsquo;s not practical divided</p>
<p>pills potassium Plus this is the complex
that like it&rsquo;s a whole complex of</p>
<p>nutrients that you can take but this is
I want to show you right here this is</p>
<p>the adrenal the adrenal gland causes
potassium loss okay so the adrenals</p>
<p>stress deplete your potassium
hormonal e insulin depletes your</p>
<p>potassium so by having enough potassium
in your bloodstream you can actually</p>
<p>improve the adrenals you can improve
insulin so the more stress the more</p>
<p>potassium it take to lower stress and
call the dreidels down when your stress</p>
<p>you deplete potassium when you eat sugar
and you&rsquo;re diabetic or pre-diabetic you</p>
<p>deplete potassium so you can imagine
we&rsquo;re dealing with the mineral that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this is something that in the reason I&rsquo;m
spending more time it&rsquo;s so common and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so easy to fix and almost everyone
they see has the problem and then you</p>
<p>fix it and it feels so much better okay
so I don&rsquo;t want to beat a dead horse but</p>
<p>that is something that you want to think
about and start increasing the potassium</p>
<p>and it gives you a reason to start
eating more salads okay</p>
<p>some of someone someone asks how how can
I get it in my seminars I always get</p>
<p>people a little discount on products so
at the end of the webinar well in fact</p>
<p>let me just post it right now just so
you can have that yeah</p>
<p>so if you wanted to get some wheatgrass
you get a discount 10% off but you also</p>
<p>get free shipping so you get you have to
buy three and it&rsquo;s good for 24 hours and</p>
<p>you can order it and there&rsquo;s a coupon
code in there that when you press the</p>
<p>button and you could basically get more
discounts off than you could normally</p>
<p>get and there&rsquo;s no shipping in the US
I can&rsquo;t ship to anything out of the u.s.</p>
<p>though for free shipping unfortunately
I&rsquo;m sorry so that&rsquo;s a little discount</p>
<p>there okay so now let me show you
something not now but later watch that</p>
<p>video and wheatgrass because I try to
make it entertaining okay</p>
<p>so adrenal the adrenal gland produces
three main hormones what is called</p>
<p>cortisol that&rsquo;s a stress hormone the
other one is the controls minerals it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called aldosterone and potassium in salt
and the other one is called antigens</p>
<p>which is like a testosterone so those
are the three main hormones we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to talk about cortisol in this
presentation okay when you have a</p>
<p>problem with cortisol you have blood
sugar problems you get a Buffalo Hump</p>
<p>you get belly fat must weakness low
vitamin D levels cataracts bone loss</p>
<p>high blood pressure high cholesterol
memory problems which I&rsquo;ll come back I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to come back to that in just a
little bit because I have some really</p>
<p>hot stuff on memory that you have to if
you have any type of people in your</p>
<p>family of dimension you have to stay
tuned for that</p>
<p>acne low tolerance to stress vertol ago
that&rsquo;s a loss of the pigment on the skin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a little white patches
inflammation cramps in the cat&rsquo;s heel</p>
<p>spurs allergies a need for coffee
acid reflux a high blood sugar immune</p>
<p>weakness round-faced anxiety so these
are just all the indicators of adrenal</p>
<p>problems um</p>
<p>now here&rsquo;s a here&rsquo;s the point that I
want to talk about um a lot of people</p>
<p>have diabetes a lot of people have high
insulin and they don&rsquo;t even know it and</p>
<p>their their diet isn&rsquo;t better you&rsquo;re
eating better but they still have the</p>
<p>problem I want to show you why okay</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s my favorite book again the
adrenal increases insulin because it</p>
<p>increases
sugar because for quick energy so you</p>
<p>can become a diabetic by having an
adrenal problem interesting you can have</p>
<p>blood sugar problems by having stress in
fact if you&rsquo;re a diabetic and you go</p>
<p>through stress your blood sugar goes out
of control okay so now that&rsquo;s a&ndash;that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a affect so how do you know they have
that if you clean up your diet and the</p>
<p>diabetes doesn&rsquo;t clear up did we know
the adrenal is involved so so let me</p>
<p>show you this right here so we have high
cortisol that&rsquo;s from the adrenal so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s activated by stress okay and then
that&rsquo;s going to increase glucose okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s sugar because your body makes your
liver mix it and now we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>increase insulin now insulin is a
hormone that prevents any chance of</p>
<p>burning fat it&rsquo;s a fat making hormone it
makes fat and it also if it&rsquo;s too high</p>
<p>or a long period of time it becomes
insulin resistant and I have to just</p>
<p>cover this because I would say the
majority of people that I see have this</p>
<p>never even really they have it and they
go through menopause to get a belly fat</p>
<p>and then they start getting a liver
problem and then they get insulin</p>
<p>resistance because that can see if you
have any of the fat in the belly that</p>
<p>you have is really insulin
yes it&rsquo;s coming from cortisol but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all it&rsquo;s cortisol is activating insulin
causing the belly fat so how do you know</p>
<p>if you have too much insulin just look
at your belly let&rsquo;s see that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>reason so check this out we have the
liver</p>
<p>you have the pancreas okay
the liver is a hundred times bigger than</p>
<p>the pancreas pancreas makes insulin but
over a period of time you get insulin</p>
<p>resistance and the receptors for insulin
get blocked okay so they can&rsquo;t absorb it</p>
<p>so now the insulin doesn&rsquo;t get through
so this is high insulin right here so</p>
<p>now in the liver we have low insulin</p>
<p>okay because it&rsquo;s not going in there in
the blood we have low insulin so if you</p>
<p>have low insulin in the blood guess
what&rsquo;s going to happen to the blood</p>
<p>sugar it&rsquo;s going to go up so we got high
sugar that&rsquo;s diabetes because insulin is</p>
<p>supposed to lower sugar but it&rsquo;s not
there because it&rsquo;s being blocked</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called insulin resistance and this
is being created by having too much</p>
<p>insulin over a long period of time make
sense now so now you can have symptoms</p>
<p>of a low insulin and high insulin all
right at the same time so you can&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>without skipping a meal without feeling
weird tired you have blood sugar</p>
<p>problems where you feel dizzy sometimes
your head hurts</p>
<p>you crave sweets you um you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re
tired after you eat sometimes you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>satisfied after you read this is insulin
resistance I&rsquo;m gonna show you to fix it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show you how to get rid of
the belly fat - so a lot of you have</p>
<p>heard of the glycemic index where
basically you um you eat sugar and it</p>
<p>activates insulin right and so you know
you need to have a low carb diet okay</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an insulin index and there&rsquo;s
a couple things that trigger the insulin</p>
<p>index one is protein not any kind of
protein</p>
<p>low fat protein so the more the low-fat
protein the more the insulin goes up so</p>
<p>whey protein powder is very high trigger
for insulin index so look at you go to</p>
<p>the grocery store and you look at the
wall of all these protein bars they all</p>
<p>have either soy protein isolates or whey
protein it&rsquo;s all very lean low fat</p>
<p>protein and sugar it&rsquo;s deadly
combination because if you had sugar to</p>
<p>this you&rsquo;re really going to spike it but
there&rsquo;s really only one food that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t activate insulin fat so what you
want to do is you want to include more</p>
<p>fat and you want to make sure your meat
that you eat or the protein is not too</p>
<p>lean get the fat of your piece of
something don&rsquo;t worry about the low fat</p>
<p>anything okay if you if you have morphed
out of your food you keep the instil low</p>
<p>the goal is to heal the system now I
talked about growth hormone and that</p>
<p>intermittent fasting also helps you lose
weight but it also intermittent fasting</p>
<p>helps insulin because when you don&rsquo;t eat
you don&rsquo;t trigger insulin because every</p>
<p>time you eat you and your insulin goes
up a little bit so what we want to do is</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to do snacks in between
the meal if you&rsquo;re not hungry for</p>
<p>breakfast you don&rsquo;t want to consume a
breakfast just keep going because the</p>
<p>breakfast that your body is eating is
your belly that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s we want to</p>
<p>eat right
so if we basically don&rsquo;t raise insulin</p>
<p>so much if we eat infrequent and maybe
have two meals or three meals a day with</p>
<p>no snacks you&rsquo;re going to heal the
insulin you&rsquo;re going to heal the the</p>
<p>belly fat it&rsquo;s going to go down
dramatically but the question is how are</p>
<p>you going to go for one meal to the next
without snacking you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>increase more fat with the meal you
don&rsquo;t have to go crazy but just start</p>
<p>increasing slowly to the point where you
can go longer longer long without eating</p>
<p>what kind of fad do I eat I do eat bacon
I also have</p>
<p>brie cheese I don&rsquo;t have low-fat cheese
brie cheese I have avocados I have nuts</p>
<p>olives peanut butter add little treats I
kind of priced you probably show you</p>
<p>what I have in the freezer of these
chocolate no sugar seeds they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>good so this is how you heal this
there&rsquo;s other things you can do as well</p>
<p>you can have apple cider vinegar with
lemon a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>or I like to do two tablespoons in water
with a little lemon and then I drink</p>
<p>that with each meal okay now for those
of you that are like like addicted to</p>
<p>soda I wanted to show you something that
I also get for my kids it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called Z BIA and this is a soda they
have different flavors and slavered with</p>
<p>the stevia I love it it&rsquo;s carbonated
it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no no sugar in this it</p>
<p>tastes like a soda so there are things
you can do okay so let me show you some</p>
<p>more on that right now</p>
<p>so insulin pulls the sugar out and
here&rsquo;s the thing when the insulin is</p>
<p>spiked you will not burn fat I&rsquo;m sorry
you won&rsquo;t burn fat in fact burning fat</p>
<p>is called ketosis you&rsquo;re in ketosis um
all it takes is a tiny bit of the wrong</p>
<p>food like sugar to completely knock you
completely out of ketosis it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>harder to get into ketosis and it&rsquo;s easy
to get out if you eat if you actually</p>
<p>have these foods refined sugars or
juices and things like that but you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>find that over about three days to a
week your cravings and your heart will</p>
<p>go down down down
that means the insulin is working okay</p>
<p>do you know that insulin also messes
with your bladder wetting bedwetting</p>
<p>leakage of urine through coughing
sneezing exercise um even men that think</p>
<p>they have a prostate problem it&rsquo;s really
an insulin problem they&rsquo;re getting up</p>
<p>all day all night long even women that
have leaky bladders it&rsquo;s not that it has</p>
<p>to do with insulin this is cool because
you can actually handle your bladder</p>
<p>problem if you fix insulin all right so
now this gets really interesting I want</p>
<p>to mention the vitamin b1 deficiency no
vadym B one is probably equivalent to</p>
<p>potassium in fixing blood sugar problems
fixing adrenal stress because vitamin b1</p>
<p>is one of probably one of the most
unique vitamins that I&rsquo;ve ever you know</p>
<p>learned about it acts as a helper to
help break down sugar so it&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in carbohydrate metabolism without b1
you won&rsquo;t break down sugar that well and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have sugar problems um
interesting the biggest symptom of b1 is</p>
<p>dementia and memory loss okay because
without b1 your brain actually atrophies</p>
<p>you get nerve damage in the feet in the
hands with diabetes and that&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>peripheral neuropathy I can be totally
corrected by the way that&rsquo;s why because</p>
<p>of the Beeville and deficiency lost some
nightmares is a classic b1 deficiency</p>
<p>very vivid dreams
deema irregular heartbeats increase</p>
<p>heart rate heart enlargement so the
cardiovascular in the brain and the</p>
<p>nervous system is the big one here&rsquo;s the
the thing when you go through stress you</p>
<p>deplete b1 and you also deplete
potassium when you go when you eat a lot</p>
<p>of sugar you deplete b1 and potassium so
the causes of low b1 are high dietary</p>
<p>sugar or diabetes or stress white rice
what right wife&rsquo;s they polish the rice</p>
<p>they take off all the B vitamins
the shell and then leave you with this</p>
<p>white rice if you eat a lot of white
rice you will become deficient and be</p>
<p>one big time so diabetes can cause a
deficiency of b1 alcohol caffeine so b1</p>
<p>is a really good thing to consume and
that&rsquo;s why I put it in my dream formula</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the problem with b1 if you
have b1 and you&rsquo;re and you try to buy it</p>
<p>most of the time it&rsquo;s synthetic it&rsquo;s
really hard to find a food base natural</p>
<p>b1 and that&rsquo;s what I put in this product
over 50% of the of this ingredient are</p>
<p>very specific natural food based B
vitamins to help heal a lot of the</p>
<p>adrenal problem so one of the
indications for taking this would be a</p>
<p>feeling of stress buildup of anxiety
can&rsquo;t relax nervous tension excessive</p>
<p>thinking so we use that to actually help
the adrenal so you also another way that</p>
<p>you want to handle the B vitamins is you
want to make sure you avoid eating sugar</p>
<p>so then you won&rsquo;t become deficient so
now I want to show you and I&rsquo;ll send you</p>
<p>this eating plan that I&rsquo;m going to
recommend this is what I want all of you</p>
<p>to start eating and again you can skip
the breakfast not a problem if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not hungry
but I just wanted to show you that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to have any snacking in
between the meals it&rsquo;s the myth that you</p>
<p>need a meal to stimulate your metabolism
you don&rsquo;t show here we have eggs avocado</p>
<p>again this is samples of foods that if
you don&rsquo;t like them you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>eat them just pick what you like but
look at I have eggs and bacon avocado I</p>
<p>have outside of integral lemon drink you
can do a hamburger patty or even a steak</p>
<p>you can do sardines you can do brie
cheese as a little font for breakfast to</p>
<p>get you to go from breakfast to lunch
without being terribly hungry now look</p>
<p>at when we get into the lunch this is
where we need our salad our vegetable</p>
<p>large quantities eat the salad first
then the protein then you need a little</p>
<p>bit of fat we have the brie cheese we
have peanut</p>
<p>olives avocado nuts pecans are really
really low on the insulin scale okay and</p>
<p>then we have fish and all the people who
are on this webinar I&rsquo;m going to send</p>
<p>you the insulin index if you guys want
it okay if you really want to I&rsquo;ll send</p>
<p>it to you okay I&rsquo;ll put it in the notes
so look at we have this drink again we</p>
<p>have this lunch and now the question is
did you have enough fat to be able to go</p>
<p>from lunch to dinner without needing for
snacks if you did great if you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>add more fat the next time the fat is
there to get you to go from one meal to</p>
<p>the next now if you&rsquo;re thinking in your
mind oh my gosh I might actually have</p>
<p>too many calories well you have to
realize that you&rsquo;re not going to lose</p>
<p>weight unless insulin is healed and if
you do this you&rsquo;re going to be less</p>
<p>hungry and you may need just two meals a
day now the key with this whole thing is</p>
<p>the vegetable in the potassium because I
don&rsquo;t know if I told you this yet but</p>
<p>ketosis or fat-burning also depletes
your potassium so that&rsquo;s why I always</p>
<p>recommend the vegetables because if you
do if you look up the ketosis diet and</p>
<p>you eat all this fat they don&rsquo;t really
recommend enough vegetables so you end</p>
<p>up with all these like reactions and
body problems and you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>unhealthily because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re
dumping all this fat into the liver so</p>
<p>you have to keep your vegetables very
very high if you don&rsquo;t like vegetables</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to have to blend them
um maybe with a little bit of a stevia</p>
<p>or something like that and then you can
actually drink your vegetables you can</p>
<p>do kale or spinach now for dinner we
have the salad we have protein and more</p>
<p>fat again right now what I do I have to
have breakfast I have to have a lunch</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t really have to have a dinner
I didn&rsquo;t have anything so far and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nine o&rsquo;clock right now I am I snack a
little bit but I don&rsquo;t really eat</p>
<p>anything and I don&rsquo;t have any snacks
other than these three meals or two</p>
<p>meals a day okay
I cover the hot flashes that&rsquo;s really an</p>
<p>adrenal but I didn&rsquo;t tell you what
nutritional thing that I use for that I</p>
<p>use what&rsquo;s called the ovary support
simply because it has adrenal extract</p>
<p>and it has ovary and uterus and
pituitary that seems to be the key</p>
<p>factor to turn off hot flashes and you
can take this before bed and get three</p>
<p>of those in you you won&rsquo;t have a hot
flash</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m really bad cases of hot flash
that like that need more support I will</p>
<p>use cortisol support now what does
course I&rsquo;ll support this is not</p>
<p>something for everyone it&rsquo;s not for
everyone it&rsquo;s only for people that are</p>
<p>severely burned out people that have
severe hot flashes severe asthma bad</p>
<p>allergies in terrible inflammation
that&rsquo;s what this really just works like</p>
<p>what I mean like magic so if you have
chronic autoimmune stuff or chronic</p>
<p>arthritis or joint stuff or pain or this
is what I would recommend and I also the</p>
<p>works great on hot flashes so it&rsquo;s for
the burnt the real burned out case</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really powerful it&rsquo;s very
strong and it&rsquo;s not for everyone so I</p>
<p>just wanted to mention that there&rsquo;s two
types of adrenal though there&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>adrenal and low adrenal now the
interesting thing when you have low</p>
<p>adrenal you&rsquo;re you you very very thin in
your tan but you&rsquo;re very sick you have a</p>
<p>lot of inflammation so with high adrenal
problems you start getting all sorts of</p>
<p>issues with blood pressure cholesterol
belly fat liver fat sleeping problems</p>
<p>etc and again because the inner
consistent is so broad I had to kind of</p>
<p>just chunk away at the adrenal but we&rsquo;re
going to be talking about the adrenal</p>
<p>more and then the other two seminars
okay so I just want to leave off with</p>
<p>this this little discount but there&rsquo;s
another one that for those of you that</p>
<p>already have the wheatgrass and you
wanted to do and not some other products</p>
<p>I
have another kit and you can do what you</p>
<p>want but this is a new kit that I put
together that has the adrenal Knight</p>
<p>formula which helps sleeping and how
it&rsquo;s adrenal de formula together and it</p>
<p>also has a wheatgrass in it as well and
it has my book and apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>plus um I think another real common
thing that I didn&rsquo;t talk about is the</p>
<p>stomach pH if your stomach does not have
enough pH and it&rsquo;s too alkaline you will</p>
<p>get heartburn or GERD so let me just go
ahead we just go ahead and add this</p>
<p>right here yeah so GERD acid reflux
bloating is really a lack of stomach</p>
<p>acid so as you age you lose the stomach
acid and your stomach can&rsquo;t digest so</p>
<p>one of the things that I recommend is
something to acidify the stomach in the</p>
<p>past I recommended gallbladder support
which is awesome but I recommend the</p>
<p>outside vinegar before you do the gall
better because gall bladder is alkaline</p>
<p>and if you try to fix the stomach and
you don&rsquo;t have enough acid you might</p>
<p>have you might neutralize the acid a
little bit more so I always like to sit</p>
<p>up on the stomach first make the person
really digest better here when the pH is</p>
<p>really good your stomach is good your
you can start absorbing proteins and</p>
<p>minerals so the apple cider vinegar plus
is a combination of like one pill is a</p>
<p>half a cup of apple cider vinegar and a
combination of betaine how to chloride</p>
<p>in one little pill now this person needs
like three with the meal but this is a</p>
<p>really good this is my latest
combination that I&rsquo;ve been using with</p>
<p>great success he would take go better
with meals the wheatgrass juice the</p>
<p>adrenal and it also comes with a really
cool bonus that you can have create your</p>
<p>own meals
exercise programs give you tools to pull</p>
<p>out stress it&rsquo;s an online program in my
book with some I show you also the</p>
<p>additional changes that occur that from
the recent addition which I&rsquo;m working on</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll get that as well but I wanted
to give you a little discount for those</p>
<p>people who wanted to get a kit and don&rsquo;t
have those already okay and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>discounted and there&rsquo;s free shipping as
well if you&rsquo;re in the u.s. okay now some</p>
<p>questions does apple cider vinegar
influence positively on the blood pH -</p>
<p>absolutely the thing about the adrenal
is the adrenal causes alkalosis that</p>
<p>means it causes your body to become too
alkaline</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you get acid reflux so by
acidifying the stomach you really get</p>
<p>the pH in you get the potassium in and
your stomach your system starts kind of</p>
<p>settling in there and these are the
things that I&rsquo;m finding most common with</p>
<p>most people is that they have page
problems they can&rsquo;t digest and someone</p>
<p>says does it contain pepsin know the
acidifier xin there will activate your</p>
<p>own body to make cuts of pepsin I do
have pepsin in my gall bladder formula</p>
<p>and pepsin is an enzyme a very powerful
protein enzyme how much do you take you</p>
<p>take about two to three with the meal
okay but I also if you get the kid I</p>
<p>explain how to take it um let&rsquo;s see all
right so got your book handle edition</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s cool does it contain
hydrochloric acid yes we pertain how to</p>
<p>court yes it contains something called
betaine hydrochloride and then in water</p>
<p>the petain separates from the
hydrochloric so you actually have how to</p>
<p>chloric acid in there it&rsquo;s a really good
stomach acidifier and I use it a lot and</p>
<p>I personally take it as well um okay
cool alright so someone that says no hot</p>
<p>flashes should I take delivery no if you
if you don&rsquo;t have hot flashes oh your</p>
<p>bladders waking you up
um yes yes if you have a bladder problem</p>
<p>I would take the ovary stuff so ovary
stuff is anything for female</p>
<p>reproductive problems if you&rsquo;re
menopausal it&rsquo;s not just for hot flashes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for menstrual problems heavy
periods and things like that but again</p>
<p>if you have a severe menopausal stuff we
do the course whole but not necessarily</p>
<p>for everyone can I take your gold butter
and HDL together no what you want to do</p>
<p>is you want to take the potato that the
acidifier is the episode of vinegar plus</p>
<p>before the meal take gall bladder after
the meal okay so that way your digestion</p>
<p>is perfect um with adrenal problems
cause low energy for someone trying to</p>
<p>go on keto yes because the adrenal
spikes cortisol so live with the adrenal</p>
<p>what we do is we try to support the
adrenal lower the cortisol help you</p>
<p>sleep at night
reduce stress during the day add the</p>
<p>potassium okay to help calm things
whether you do salads or up side of</p>
<p>integrity I&rsquo;m sorry the wheatgrass
that&rsquo;s fine but those combinations calm</p>
<p>the nervous system make you strong or
give you more endurance you have more</p>
<p>energy and you start healing it&rsquo;s a
really good combination we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be talking about polycystic ovarian
syndrome next week for sure</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s see my husband was low
testosterone yes we&rsquo;re going to talk</p>
<p>about testosterone X for testosterone we
want to heal the liver there&rsquo;s a product</p>
<p>called them the cruciferous food that&rsquo;s
the best thing for the liver function to</p>
<p>improve the liver function test
downstream goes up also you want to work</p>
<p>on sleep as well can you show the
wheatgrass this about discount again</p>
<p>yeah I can show that right here we press
ok there&rsquo;s a wheatgrass link how long</p>
<p>discounts for for 24 hours okay you can
get them you know in the future but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>giving you the most discount and free
shipping if you get it within the day</p>
<p>just as incentive also I do this on the
webinars kind of a give people a little</p>
<p>extra um what do you suggest without
without a gall bladder you need the you</p>
<p>need the outside of vinegar plus product
because that will allow the liver to</p>
<p>produce more bile and then you&rsquo;re going
to also about a week after that you can</p>
<p>eat the gall bladder formula and I&rsquo;m
completely out with that right now but</p>
<p>when I get that intake it because that
will give you a vial to help you digest</p>
<p>fats so the combination without a
gallbladder you don&rsquo;t have the sack so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be bio deficient so you
even need bile</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re going to
your visions going to go bad eventually</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have vitamin A the
skin goes bad vitamin D deficiencies</p>
<p>vitamin k2 deficiencies vitamin D
deficiencies other than that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>perfectly fine I have slightly elevated
estrogen and testosterone what would</p>
<p>cause that we are going to get into
Rachel we&rsquo;re going to get into that</p>
<p>topic next week you&rsquo;re going to love it
I&rsquo;m going to show you a lot of great</p>
<p>techniques hair loss we&rsquo;re going to
cover that as well</p>
<p>hair loss uh one thing that I use for
that is I use tres menos my liquid trace</p>
<p>minerals I have a guy that buys a case
of the liquid plant-based trace minerals</p>
<p>every month I&rsquo;m like what are you doing
with this he goes I sell it all on my</p>
<p>co-workers because my hair my nails my
skin it really gets the hair back if but</p>
<p>if you have high levels of adrenal
hormone that can also cause hair</p>
<p>problems too male pattern baldness
alopecia things like that um how much</p>
<p>good fat to eat every day it really
depends on your digestion go light and</p>
<p>start increasing it radiantly the goals
not beat a lot of fat the goal is seen</p>
<p>enough fat to go from one male to the
next so it&rsquo;s adjustable just play around</p>
<p>with it that&rsquo;s whatever you need at
first when you&rsquo;re healing insulin you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to need more but then as you heal
it you&rsquo;ll need less because your system</p>
<p>is more efficient and you&rsquo;re burning
your own</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you if you follow these
principles you can if not get rid of</p>
<p>diabetes improve it tremendously you can
get tremendous energy from this from</p>
<p>these recommendations as well the
workout that I&rsquo;m doing right now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>lifting logs this big around
this tall dead from from the ground 20</p>
<p>of them moving across my yard and then
moving them back every night because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like them my body craves like
lifting chopping wood it just loves it</p>
<p>so I like a baby when I do that what do
you do for loss of menstrual cycle I</p>
<p>would take I would do two things I would
take the ovary support formula for sure</p>
<p>and I would also add the seek help
because you need iodine okay those are</p>
<p>the two things that I would recommend
and then if that doesn&rsquo;t fully handle it</p>
<p>email us and I&rsquo;ll let you know what else
to do because there&rsquo;s several other</p>
<p>things you can do um okay
if you heal the adrenals can you reverse</p>
<p>long-term baldness it really depends if
its genetic I&rsquo;ve had people completely</p>
<p>bald get their hair back it&rsquo;s really a
50/50 chance I don&rsquo;t know sometimes you</p>
<p>can sometimes you can um period changes
on a taquito genetic diet not if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing enough vegetable and you&rsquo;re doing
enough nutrient because when you go on a</p>
<p>ketogenic diet you can lose potassium
and then calcium so you live to put</p>
<p>these electrolytes back as well it&rsquo;s
three eggs okay for women absolutely</p>
<p>your body just will make less
cholesterol it&rsquo;s a meeting ton of salad</p>
<p>no grain small portions of protein good
fats avocado turkey but haven&rsquo;t lost any</p>
<p>belly at all I&rsquo;ve been eating this way
for three weeks in advice so so what I</p>
<p>want to recommend is make sure you&rsquo;re
not snacking make sure there&rsquo;s no hidden</p>
<p>carbs no sugars no grains
make sure your digestion your digestion</p>
<p>is good and so here&rsquo;s the thing if I
think it&rsquo;s Renee</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing all the right things and
you&rsquo;re not losing weight in your belly I</p>
<p>have a question
are you losing any or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not losing any weight are you losing any
belly fat a lot of people lose size but</p>
<p>not weight so check on that check your
size if you&rsquo;re still not losing weight</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re eating when you&rsquo;re not hungry
like three meals a day then do go to two</p>
<p>meals then add exercise but I&rsquo;ll also
look at are you sleeping are you</p>
<p>sleeping okay do you have any other body
health problems you have any digestive</p>
<p>problems do you have any hot flashes do
you have any bad menstrual period those</p>
<p>are the things that we want to fix to
take your metabolism up to the next</p>
<p>level so there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s other things to
look at how much trace minerals one</p>
<p>dropper full a day is plenty what do you
do to clear cataracts that basically is</p>
<p>b1 I would do the adrenal day formula if
those vegetables are not available in</p>
<p>India then hat try to find a comparable
and maybe just spinach if you if you</p>
<p>could tell us how much calcium and easy
we need not to overdo it well the</p>
<p>calcium magnesium you have to be careful
in that because a lot of people have too</p>
<p>much calcium and they need more of the
vitamin d3 in the k2 to mobilize the</p>
<p>calcium so I only take calcium magnesium
if my calf&rsquo;s are tight or cramping other</p>
<p>than that I get my calcium magnesium
from a little bit of cheese okay um but</p>
<p>it some people need it to sleep but you
don&rsquo;t need as much as you think oh well</p>
<p>okay listen I want to thank all of you
for your attention your questions your</p>
<p>interest I know I kept going and oh and
an hour and a half I only meant to do</p>
<p>this an hour but I&rsquo;m going to be doing
this next Wednesday I&rsquo;m going to send</p>
<p>you guys the notes tomorrow morning okay
next Wednesday we&rsquo;re going to do another</p>
<p>seminar in the following Wednesday we&rsquo;ll
do another seminar I&rsquo;m taking all your</p>
<p>questions I&rsquo;m going to include those
into the seminars</p>
<p>okay so don&rsquo;t feel like you couldn&rsquo;t um
you know get that data by by feeling</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t answer all your questions
I will make sure that we try to get as</p>
<p>many of these as well okay because
you&rsquo;re just just a lot of questions and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re running out of time but I want to
thank you all for my your attention and</p>
<p>your wonderful comments and your
questions okay and I hope you learn</p>
<p>something I want to cover give you the
most important stuff and go ahead and</p>
<p>start applying this immediately if you
want some of the kits go ahead and take</p>
<p>advantage I&rsquo;ll send you the links as
well again but thank you and have a</p>
