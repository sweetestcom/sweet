    <p>you have to have the free markets</p>
<p>in order to build prosperity.</p>
<p>And prosperity means economic power.</p>
<p>If you have economic power, no one messes with you.</p>
<p>Or if they&rsquo;re gonna do it, they&rsquo;re gonna have to think twice</p>
<p>and when they do, they&rsquo;re gonna have to pay consequences.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Magat Wade,</p>
<p>an entrepreneur who&rsquo;s passionate</p>
<p>about creating positive change in Africa</p>
<p>through economic empowerment.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Magat Wade.</p>
<p>You were born in Senegal.</p>
<p>You have lived and traveled across the world.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, what is the soul of Senegal?</p>
<p>Like, its people, its culture, its history.</p>
<p>Can you try to sneak up on telling us</p>
<p>what is the spirit of its people?</p>
<p>Taranga, Taranga.</p>
<p>Taranga, it&rsquo;s a Wolof word.</p>
<p>Wolof is the main indigenous language of Senegal</p>
<p>and it means hospitality.</p>
<p>That is what us, the people of Senegal, are known for.</p>
<p>And it transpires in everything that we do,</p>
<p>everything that we say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place where, I guess with hospitality,</p>
<p>goes this concept of warmth.</p>
<p>So we are a very warm people.</p>
<p>So in a nutshell, that&rsquo;s us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s us, the place where you come</p>
<p>and everybody will just embrace you,</p>
<p>make you feel very comfortable,</p>
<p>make you feel like you&rsquo;re the only person in the world</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;ve been waiting for you our whole life, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my country.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for people in Senegal, people in Africa,</p>
<p>or also people across the world,</p>
<p>weird strangers from all walks of life.</p>
<p>So hospitality towards everyone.</p>
<p>For everyone, for everyone.</p>
<p>Especially towards the foreigner</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very ingrained in us,</p>
<p>this understanding that especially the foreigner,</p>
<p>the foreigner is called foreigner</p>
<p>because the foreigner is coming from somewhere else.</p>
<p>So if someone has taken the time and the energy,</p>
<p>whether in a forced manner or because it&rsquo;s a choice</p>
<p>to travel so far to come to a place that&rsquo;s not theirs,</p>
<p>to start where that&rsquo;s where the foreigners again,</p>
<p>then it is your duty to welcome them,</p>
<p>to be uber welcoming to them.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not a fear of the foreigner.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a suspicion of the foreigner.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>And I think this goes with the other way around.</p>
<p>Maybe it has to do with just,</p>
<p>you know, when you feel good about yourself,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re very grounded yourself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to open yourself to others.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m wondering if that&rsquo;s not, you know,</p>
<p>the other side of the equation in a way.</p>
<p>So no, we don&rsquo;t have a fear towards a foreigner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just no.</p>
<p>When you have a pride of your culture,</p>
<p>pride of your own people, it&rsquo;s easier to sort of embrace.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting how these kind of cultures emerge</p>
<p>because, you know, the Slavic countries</p>
<p>are sometimes colder.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re slower to trust others.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now here in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I fell in love with this place</p>
<p>when I showed up is there&rsquo;s that same hospitality</p>
<p>as compared to other cities I&rsquo;ve lived in,</p>
<p>sort of Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hesitation to open up, to be fragile,</p>
<p>to be caring before understanding</p>
<p>what I can gain from you kind of calculation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And I wonder how those kinds of dynamics emerge</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re certainly parts of the world.</p>
<p>Like Austin is one of them</p>
<p>where you just feel the kindness,</p>
<p>just radiate without knowing kindness from strangers.</p>
<p>You know, if I were to advance one thing,</p>
<p>and I had the same experience</p>
<p>after having lived in San Francisco first,</p>
<p>then we went to New York, then we came to Austin.</p>
<p>And when we came to Austin, I felt,</p>
<p>it took me a while to put my finger on it,</p>
<p>but what I found in Austin, people just hang.</p>
<p>People, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re real.</p>
<p>And like what you were saying, I feel like</p>
<p>in these other places, people are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a destination for people who want to come and perform.</p>
<p>I think maybe the early San Francisco people,</p>
<p>it was different for them.</p>
<p>But later as prosperity starts to come in</p>
<p>and success comes in, then you attract a different breed.</p>
<p>At first, we&rsquo;re the people who made it,</p>
<p>who made this place be what it is.</p>
<p>And then it attracts all the bling followers</p>
<p>and the bling attracted people.</p>
<p>And when those people show up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time for all of us to get out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of my worries about Austin too.</p>
<p>And I guess I&rsquo;m one of, I count myself in it,</p>
<p>but you know, because we&rsquo;re also new arrivees,</p>
<p>always been furious now.</p>
<p>But how are we gonna protect this place?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, these are, you know, the best possible version</p>
<p>of the Austin history.</p>
<p>This is the early days of Silicon Valley in Austin.</p>
<p>And so you get a chance to build</p>
<p>on top of this culture that&rsquo;s already been here</p>
<p>of the weirdos, the artists, the sort of the characters,</p>
<p>but also the general kindness and love</p>
<p>that just permeates the whole place,</p>
<p>build on top of that entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p>So like the tech companies, new startups,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And then you get a chance to build totally new ideas,</p>
<p>totally revolutionary ideas and make them a reality</p>
<p>and dream big and build it here.</p>
<p>I think Elon represents that with all the people</p>
<p>that kind of try to do the cutting edge stuff</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing at Tesla and SpaceX.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a bunch of other companies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like coming up.</p>
<p>I get to talk to a bunch of tech people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just incredible.</p>
<p>Versus San Francisco, there&rsquo;s a cynicism a bit.</p>
<p>And also some of the interaction with strangers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a bit of a calculation,</p>
<p>like how good is this going to be for my career?</p>
<p>Or how can, yeah.</p>
<p>How can hanging out with this person can advance me?</p>
<p>You go to a party, they&rsquo;re seizing up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not gonna talk to so and so</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not gonna advance me.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s gonna advance me next?</p>
<p>And so this is what I would not wanna see here in Austin.</p>
<p>And I think maybe there&rsquo;s one way to try to,</p>
<p>I really would like to see Austin</p>
<p>not go the way San Francisco did</p>
<p>and other towns before.</p>
<p>I like how you pronounce San Francisco with a French accent.</p>
<p>San Francisco?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one word you go with a French accent.</p>
<p>You have to.</p>
<p>It sounds beautiful.</p>
<p>San Francisco.</p>
<p>But you know, so now that you find that cute,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to forgive me when I mess up my English</p>
<p>because English is not my first language.</p>
<p>So I always try to make sure people know that.</p>
<p>But you know Lex, this is why I am very interested</p>
<p>in what some folks here are working on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just gonna be very selfish here</p>
<p>because I wanna help her with what she&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s someone like, you know, Nicole Nodzak and her project,</p>
<p>you know, with the housing project that they have right now,</p>
<p>making sure that Austin remains a town</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s affordable for people of all walks of lives.</p>
<p>If we can accomplish making sure that all walks of lives,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter how little or big you&rsquo;re making money wise,</p>
<p>that you can stay in this town</p>
<p>so the diversity at that level can remain,</p>
<p>then I think Austin stands a chance to really show the world</p>
<p>how to do things differently.</p>
<p>And what I love about, you know, her initiative</p>
<p>is just how they&rsquo;re really trying, you know,</p>
<p>to again work on keeping affordability down for most people.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to,</p>
<p>because it seems like it matters to you,</p>
<p>I know that it matters to me.</p>
<p>I absolutely would not wanna see Austin go away</p>
<p>that San Francisco did.</p>
<p>And I think the key to that is making sure</p>
<p>that true diversity,</p>
<p>not like the fluff, fluff crap diversity we&rsquo;re hearing over there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another thing by the way,</p>
<p>because San Francisco likes to pride itself in,</p>
<p>oh, you know, we are so into diversity,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m like, if diversity for you means gender,</p>
<p>difference of gender, skin color, you know,</p>
<p>maybe the different accents we have,</p>
<p>and you think check, check, check, check, check,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>Can we also add diversity of thoughts?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the other problem I have with that place,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>And I know some folks who are scared of saying much</p>
<p>around people, that&rsquo;s also another thing.</p>
<p>So not only they&rsquo;re sizing you up,</p>
<p>but everybody&rsquo;s also, there is this invisible,</p>
<p>this invisible, how should I say this?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this invisible agreement</p>
<p>that they all seem to have to stay on script.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a feeling like you&rsquo;re following</p>
<p>a certain kind of script that&rsquo;s very kind of shallow.</p>
<p>And there is a bit of a categorization going on,</p>
<p>which category do you belong to?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s put this into a simple math equation,</p>
<p>what comes out, as opposed to just the free, open embrace</p>
<p>of people, the weirdos, the characters, the interesting,</p>
<p>the full, deep sense of diversity.</p>
<p>Not just ideas, but backgrounds, and rich and poor.</p>
<p>Artists, engineers.</p>
<p>High school dropouts, PhDs, all of this.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s what makes for a rich society</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s gonna get ahead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned Nicole&rsquo;s efforts,</p>
<p>I know she really is passionate about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how complicated that work is,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s probably a big force trying to increase</p>
<p>how much it costs to live in Austin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you resist that.</p>
<p>Whenever I go to New York City,</p>
<p>just the fact that there&rsquo;s a giant park in the middle of it,</p>
<p>I wonder, how did they pull this off?</p>
<p>This is amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like to resist the force of the increasing price</p>
<p>of the land, and still to protect this idea</p>
<p>of having a park.</p>
<p>And then in the same way, protecting the ability</p>
<p>for people from all walks of life to live</p>
<p>in the center of the city, to live around the city,</p>
<p>to chase a dream when they don&rsquo;t get any money</p>
<p>in their pocket.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partly political, probably, regulation,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>A lot of it has to do with regulations.</p>
<p>And this is where her and I also very much see eye to eye</p>
<p>in terms of the free markets and also prosperity building,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s always the same problems most of the time,</p>
<p>most places.</p>
<p>Here, what you have is some people in the name of,</p>
<p>we gotta stand for, and I don&rsquo;t like to use this word,</p>
<p>but maybe you help me find a better one,</p>
<p>but at least that&rsquo;s a word that people can understand.</p>
<p>We gotta stand for the lesser fortunate among us.</p>
<p>Some people would call them, maybe oftentimes use the word,</p>
<p>maybe the underdogs, whatever it is.</p>
<p>I will just say maybe the lesser fortunate among us, right?</p>
<p>In the name of standing up for them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re promoting policies that are actually gonna backfire</p>
<p>and where they end up being the first ones</p>
<p>to suffer from it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take this whole housing issue</p>
<p>that Nicole and her team are working on.</p>
<p>We find that oftentimes the cost at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the good old supply and demand equation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna make it so hard</p>
<p>that the supply level of housing remains</p>
<p>below a certain threshold,</p>
<p>remains lower than the demand of people who need,</p>
<p>especially affordable housing, housing altogether,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen is scarcity, prices go up,</p>
<p>and who gets kicked out first?</p>
<p>The lesser fortunate among us.</p>
<p>And so, but I find that oftentimes people</p>
<p>in the name of We Care don&rsquo;t engage their mind.</p>
<p>And a friend of mine said this, and he said it so well.</p>
<p>He said, having a heart for the poor, that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>Having a mind for the poor, that&rsquo;s the challenge.</p>
<p>And oftentimes we all have a heart for the poor.</p>
<p>But when it comes then to, then what do we do</p>
<p>to have a real impact on making sure</p>
<p>that people get a chance at going up,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s where everything starts falling apart.</p>
<p>And then you have people who,</p>
<p>then they start pushing for policies, housing policies,</p>
<p>making it super hard for you to even renovate</p>
<p>or add one more store to your home or anything like that.</p>
<p>By doing that, you&rsquo;re messing up with the supply,</p>
<p>with the supply of housing.</p>
<p>And therefore the people who can&rsquo;t afford,</p>
<p>people get priced out of the market.</p>
<p>And so what people like Nicole are doing</p>
<p>are going back to where all of this is taking place</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going back to the regulation side.</p>
<p>And just like, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll talk about it here,</p>
<p>but people wonder today, why is Africa</p>
<p>the poorest region in the world?</p>
<p>We go back to the same culprit.</p>
<p>Bad laws and tons of senseless regulations.</p>
<p>If you make it so hard that in Berkeley,</p>
<p>for someone to build one more store to their home,</p>
<p>which means maybe one more unit</p>
<p>that could be rented out to someone.</p>
<p>And if many more people do that,</p>
<p>then you have a much bigger supply,</p>
<p>which means the prices will go down,</p>
<p>which means more people have access and among them,</p>
<p>especially the lesser fortunate among us,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re starting to see a winning proposal, aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>But instead, if you go the other way around,</p>
<p>then all of a sudden you&rsquo;re pricing them out of the market.</p>
<p>Same thing was done with us.</p>
<p>So oftentimes when I see problems of this nature,</p>
<p>you can betcha that regulations and census laws</p>
<p>are the heart of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re tackling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not popular, it&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>And people tend to not even understand</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>But this is a problem we have</p>
<p>with people not understanding economic econ 101.</p>
<p>Well, so it&rsquo;s the regulation and the laws</p>
<p>and the system that props them up</p>
<p>and increases the span of those laws.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about that,</p>
<p>the fascinating way those kinds of things develop</p>
<p>when it works, when it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Let me sort of step back</p>
<p>and ask you a question about Africa.</p>
<p>In the West, in many places in the world,</p>
<p>Africa is almost talked about like it&rsquo;s one country,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s one place.</p>
<p>So in what ways is Africa one community?</p>
<p>And in what ways is it many, many, many communities?</p>
<p>Just from your perspective from in Senegal and beyond.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So at the most basic of what makes us one</p>
<p>goes back to even what makes you African.</p>
<p>You are African, I&rsquo;m African.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re one big family.</p>
<p>Africa is very much at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the foundation and the birth of the human race.</p>
<p>So from that standpoint, at the most basic level,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all Africans.</p>
<p>Where this whole thing started.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Where this whole thing started</p>
<p>and how at some point humanity was hanging</p>
<p>by its fingernails.</p>
<p>Only 2000 of us were left on this earth.</p>
<p>And eventually we started, we went for survival.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we started to spread around</p>
<p>and some going up north, some going this way, that way.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;re traveling to different places</p>
<p>then features start to change to adapt</p>
<p>to where you are, right?</p>
<p>So hair gets lighter for some people,</p>
<p>eyes get different shape for others to adjust</p>
<p>to our new natural habitat.</p>
<p>You know, the genomics program,</p>
<p>I think at the National Geographic did that so well</p>
<p>for people who are interested in going back</p>
<p>to that work with Spencer Wells and such.</p>
<p>But yeah, so at the very basic, most basic level,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what unites us all first of all.</p>
<p>And then I would say that the continent, especially here</p>
<p>I will group it into black Africa, you know, black Africa.</p>
<p>Unfortunately our common stories, you know,</p>
<p>of having gone through this terrible, horrible period</p>
<p>of around the same time the whole continent being,</p>
<p>you know, enslaved and colonized.</p>
<p>So that in a way forms, not that we were ever</p>
<p>the first people or only people ever, you know,</p>
<p>enslaved in this world.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I mean, the word slaves comes</p>
<p>from esclav, you know, esclav, slave, slavs, les slavs,</p>
<p>right, from the Eastern block.</p>
<p>So the first slaves were actually people looking</p>
<p>more like you than looking like me, right?</p>
<p>So, but we don&rsquo;t necessarily remember all of that</p>
<p>because in our human psyche, the closest to us in history</p>
<p>of a big mass of people being enslaved is African people.</p>
<p>We were the last, you know, group like that.</p>
<p>You know, the pain of World War I and World War II</p>
<p>permeates Europe, but it certainly does</p>
<p>for the former Soviet Union, the countries</p>
<p>that made up the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Does in the same way, the pain of slavery</p>
<p>and empires using Africa, does that permeate the culture?</p>
<p>Is there still echoes of that?</p>
<p>In a way, yes, especially the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>in many different places, whether it&rsquo;s Ghana</p>
<p>or my country or Benin, where you have these places</p>
<p>that we call the door of no return or the places</p>
<p>of no return, which this was the last place</p>
<p>where the slaves were standing or, you know,</p>
<p>this is in Senegal, we call it the door of no return.</p>
<p>There is this one door, you&rsquo;re there in the slave house.</p>
<p>And once they go, they go, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be the last time they see back home.</p>
<p>So, you know, those, of course, of course,</p>
<p>it creates for a common lived experience,</p>
<p>which becomes a common lived history.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s gonna tire us up.</p>
<p>Is there a resentment, because you mentioned hospitality,</p>
<p>is there a kind of a resentment of the foreigner</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a rich, vibrant land?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many resources, there&rsquo;s powerful cultures.</p>
<p>Are they just going to show up and use us?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a way to see geopolitics in this modern world.</p>
<p>This is, okay, so where it plays very differently is,</p>
<p>so if you came to Senegal today,</p>
<p>there is not really a problem at that level.</p>
<p>Where people&rsquo;s resentment start to come from is,</p>
<p>of course, when bad behavior shows up,</p>
<p>meaning like you have so many white people who can show up</p>
<p>and just in the attitude,</p>
<p>they have an entitlement attitude, right?</p>
<p>And they think that in a way, we&rsquo;re all still servants.</p>
<p>Some people in your face, some people more,</p>
<p>but that can cause some little resentment,</p>
<p>but where really the resentment is.</p>
<p>And that can, the entitlement can take different forms,</p>
<p>like even pity.</p>
<p>Yes, don&rsquo;t even get me going on that one.</p>
<p>I was trying to be polite today.</p>
<p>So just don&rsquo;t, Lex, do not.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes I tell myself,</p>
<p>my God, today you&rsquo;re going to be all composed.</p>
<p>You know, Lex is all composed.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t go there and make a fool of yourself.</p>
<p>Just behave.</p>
<p>But if you get me on some grounds,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s all going to go to hell.</p>
<p>So yeah, let&rsquo;s move beyond that too.</p>
<p>So resentment, there&rsquo;s a dance</p>
<p>between hospitality and resentment.</p>
<p>And resentment.</p>
<p>So when you come in, you&rsquo;re you, you live your life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just a normal human being</p>
<p>and you treat me decently</p>
<p>like you would treat a friend, normal people.</p>
<p>I have no problem with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to come back and be like,</p>
<p>well, you and your ancestors have enslaved me.</p>
<p>You, you&rsquo;re not going to see that stuff.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m in this country where I feel like that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, it might look like that,</p>
<p>but we in Africa don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Now, if you come, you have this nasty attitude.</p>
<p>You think you&rsquo;re still serving servants around.</p>
<p>Well, you can have a problem with someone like me.</p>
<p>I might even grab you by the back of your neck</p>
<p>and, you know, take you back to the airport.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be you very quickly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But where things come up is,</p>
<p>especially nowadays with the African youth,</p>
<p>when we have to be reminded of the World Bank,</p>
<p>when we have to be reminded of even the world,</p>
<p>places like the World Economic Forum,</p>
<p>you know, like all of these places that seem to constitute,</p>
<p>they would, the way they describe them,</p>
<p>when I say they, it&rsquo;s primarily my Pan African friends.</p>
<p>So here maybe terms are worth describing.</p>
<p>So the Pan African movement goes way back when,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about, you know, way back when,</p>
<p>started in the thirties going on all the way from there.</p>
<p>So what you have there is people</p>
<p>who have started coming together</p>
<p>and dreaming up an emancipated Africa</p>
<p>away from the colonies,</p>
<p>because at that point there were still colonies</p>
<p>and dreaming up all of that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about people like Kwame Kuma of Ghana,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about Julius Nyerere of Tanzania,</p>
<p>talking about Blaise Diagne of Senegal</p>
<p>and other people like that, Bandi of Malawi.</p>
<p>So anyway, so, and the African youth of today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still hanging on to those,</p>
<p>onto some of these ideas of,</p>
<p>and on some of these dreams of a reunited Africa.</p>
<p>So when you were talking about what seems to unite you,</p>
<p>there is that, you know, also,</p>
<p>meaning like we all feel like we&rsquo;re part of the same family.</p>
<p>Is it only in our heads?</p>
<p>Is it in reality?</p>
<p>Many, for many different reasons,</p>
<p>there is definitely what we call a Pan African movement.</p>
<p>And I very much myself, consider myself one of them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree all the time with our,</p>
<p>where we want to go and how we want to go there,</p>
<p>but not where we want to go.</p>
<p>Where we want to go is we would love to see</p>
<p>a united Africa for sure.</p>
<p>But how to get that accomplished,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where oftentimes we have issues.</p>
<p>So on something like that,</p>
<p>so this Pan African, especially the Pan African youth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s beyond the Pan African youth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the youth in general in Africa,</p>
<p>World Bank, UN, all of these organizations</p>
<p>that they tend to qualify as imperialist organizations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not always a correct way to describe them,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure you get the sentiment.</p>
<p>And from that place, there is tons of resentment</p>
<p>because for the longest time,</p>
<p>these groups, organizations,</p>
<p>and some that preceded them,</p>
<p>have proceeded to actually decide</p>
<p>what even our new frontiers would be.</p>
<p>You see, when you go to a place like Senegal,</p>
<p>Mali, all of that, different countries,</p>
<p>but we were one people,</p>
<p>one group, one kingdom.</p>
<p>And then at some point they decided just,</p>
<p>when you look at Africa,</p>
<p>have you looked at how straight some of these borders are?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, did a robot just draw these?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>No offense to robots.</p>
<p>No offense to robot, especially this one,</p>
<p>he looks so cute.</p>
<p>But you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So they have continued deciding</p>
<p>what it would be to be us,</p>
<p>to live on our land,</p>
<p>and how do we even progress?</p>
<p>And it just keeps on going.</p>
<p>They get to decide how are we gonna,</p>
<p>which type of even economic development path</p>
<p>are we gonna choose or not?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very, so from that standpoint,</p>
<p>yes, there&rsquo;s a lot of resentment,</p>
<p>including even from people like me.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s interesting that the invader</p>
<p>and the oppressor and the empires</p>
<p>have actually created a force for unity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that in Ukraine and the invasion of Ukraine,</p>
<p>where it was a pretty divided,</p>
<p>not a pretty, a very divided country with many factions.</p>
<p>But the invasion really forced everyone to think</p>
<p>about the identity of this nation together,</p>
<p>beyond factions, beyond all of that.</p>
<p>It allowed it to look at its history and its future.</p>
<p>Like they all say that all great nations</p>
<p>have had to have a war of independence.</p>
<p>And this is our war to find our own identity.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, Africa as one place,</p>
<p>as one continent had to find multiple times its identity</p>
<p>through the resistance of the oppressor.</p>
<p>Especially subterranean Africa,</p>
<p>especially subterranean Africa, yes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an interesting aspect to this</p>
<p>because the president of Senegal is also</p>
<p>the head of the African Union.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about the fascinating geopolitics</p>
<p>of that whole situation.</p>
<p>But let me ask in general,</p>
<p>you talk about this question, this fascinating question,</p>
<p>what does it take for a country to prosper?</p>
<p>What does it take for a country to prosper?</p>
<p>You see many countries in the world that really struggle</p>
<p>and many that flourish.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not always obvious why</p>
<p>because some have natural resources, some don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Some have wars, some don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Some have sort of authoritarian regimes, some don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And some have democracies and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So the dynamics aren&rsquo;t exactly obvious.</p>
<p>Is there commonalities?</p>
<p>Is there fundamental ideas that result</p>
<p>in a prosperity of a nation?</p>
<p>Today, I can confidently say yes,</p>
<p>despite all the differences that you talked about.</p>
<p>And I think then this is where it becomes very important</p>
<p>that we are very clear about the question you asked me.</p>
<p>You said, what does it take to make a country prosperous?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna stick to prosperity</p>
<p>because prosperity doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean,</p>
<p>sometimes it has nothing to do with maybe how</p>
<p>you conduct yourself otherwise, socially speaking, right?</p>
<p>So you can be prosperous.</p>
<p>And still when it comes to your family laws,</p>
<p>all the way you approach the other aspects of your life,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re running a very communist lifestyle</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in a very liberal society.</p>
<p>So for me, when we talk about prosperity,</p>
<p>I just want to make sure that we&rsquo;re clear on that</p>
<p>because some people might say that,</p>
<p>might be somewhere and be like,</p>
<p>well, because I know what I&rsquo;m gonna talk to you about next.</p>
<p>And some people are gonna sit there and be like,</p>
<p>well, China is not like that.</p>
<p>Or even Dubai is not like that.</p>
<p>No, so what I&rsquo;m talking about is this thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I love about this.</p>
<p>If we just stick to the word prosperity.</p>
<p>To me, I see prosperity as this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, economically speaking,</p>
<p>what are we gonna be to be a prosperous nation?</p>
<p>Meaning we are a middle to high income nation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about what are the rights of your women</p>
<p>to vote or can people live like this?</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m not talking about any of that.</p>
<p>Economic, fundamentally economic prosperity.</p>
<p>Because I think that distinction is very important</p>
<p>because over the years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people push back on all types of things</p>
<p>and it occurred to me</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what the misunderstanding was there.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re gonna talk about prosperity,</p>
<p>making sure that the country can make money</p>
<p>so that it can take care of its needs</p>
<p>and the needs of its citizens,</p>
<p>then what I have come to find is that at the root of that</p>
<p>is gonna be what we call economic freedom</p>
<p>and what I call the toolkit of the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>In that you can put the rule of law,</p>
<p>you can put the concept of clear</p>
<p>and transferable property rights.</p>
<p>Economic freedom is at all the levels</p>
<p>that which will allow entrepreneurs</p>
<p>and business people to create value</p>
<p>and create value entrepreneurially.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about rent seeking or anything like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you found a pie to be this big</p>
<p>and you make it this big.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Create value.</p>
<p>Create value, yes.</p>
<p>So when it comes to that,</p>
<p>we have found that whether you&rsquo;re looking at two countries</p>
<p>that start out the same,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking the same people,</p>
<p>East Germany, West Germany,</p>
<p>South Korea, North Korea,</p>
<p>very similar people to start with, right?</p>
<p>But yet radical outcomes.</p>
<p>I know that today Germany is united,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re talking about back in the days</p>
<p>when you had East and Western block.</p>
<p>Same people, very different outcomes.</p>
<p>Like I said, South Korea, North Korea,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And at the same time, very different nations.</p>
<p>Dubai compared to Singapore or to England,</p>
<p>very different yet the same outcome.</p>
<p>So it seems to me like whenever we&rsquo;re looking at prosperity,</p>
<p>if a nation is prosperous,</p>
<p>regardless of whatever other shenanigan</p>
<p>they might be running,</p>
<p>whatever other operating software</p>
<p>they might be running for anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not related to business,</p>
<p>if on the business side,</p>
<p>they are proponents of a free markets</p>
<p>or at least a base level of free markets,</p>
<p>we know that such countries will create prosperity.</p>
<p>So what are the aspects of the operating systems</p>
<p>that lead to Singapore and to South Korea</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>So can you speak to different elements</p>
<p>that enable the toolkit for entrepreneurs?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>And maybe here,</p>
<p>let me just maybe illustrate it with my own story</p>
<p>and then I can take you back to&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s your&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh my God, tell us your story.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just because it started with me coming here.</p>
<p>You showed me the robot and everything</p>
<p>and now it looks like we know each other for too long.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, tell people.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>But so this is where this question,</p>
<p>even when you asked me,</p>
<p>how do some countries become prosperous?</p>
<p>That question, Lex, I had it when I was seven or so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when my family moved me to South Korea</p>
<p>to from Senegal for the first time of my life,</p>
<p>I left my country, I left my continent</p>
<p>and I was headed to Europe to go join my people,</p>
<p>my family, my parents who were there as economic migrants.</p>
<p>My parents had migrated for a better life</p>
<p>as so many people have to,</p>
<p>so many people have to coming from poorer places,</p>
<p>coming from low income countries.</p>
<p>You saw the difference?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Between the two places.</p>
<p>How else would you call it?</p>
<p>Here you are in Senegal,</p>
<p>minding your own business,</p>
<p>causing tons of trouble everywhere,</p>
<p>just being a happy free wrench kid that I was.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you were always a troublemaker, not just now.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Life wouldn&rsquo;t be fun without it.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, I agree.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So, because even you,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re all put together front,</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a lot of troublemaking behind you.</p>
<p>Desperately trying to keep it together.</p>
<p>I know you are, but with me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna totally bring it out.</p>
<p>So just, yeah.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So you saw the difference.</p>
<p>Right, I saw the difference.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m walking in here, back home,</p>
<p>and I tell people this story</p>
<p>because to me it&rsquo;s a defining story.</p>
<p>Back home, to take a shower, it takes time.</p>
<p>Grandma has to make the charcoal catch</p>
<p>on a little stove like you use when you go camping.</p>
<p>And then she puts a pot of water on it, it boils.</p>
<p>She takes it, puts it in a bigger bucket,</p>
<p>mixes it with some colder water.</p>
<p>Then we put a little pot in it,</p>
<p>and a stronger member of the family</p>
<p>has to drag it to the shower.</p>
<p>And then there, finally, I can proceed to take my shower.</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m in Germany in the middle of the winter,</p>
<p>and my mom&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>my god, time for your shower.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m not getting naked.</p>
<p>Where is the bottle?</p>
<p>Where is the bucket of hot water?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, oh, you silly, come on, just jump in.</p>
<p>And I jump in the shower, turn the buttons,</p>
<p>the water is coming down temperature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like playing with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, are you kidding me?</p>
<p>So amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been cheated out of life my whole life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, oh, and all of these roads,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re paved roads.</p>
<p>And like back home, everything is like sandy,</p>
<p>and my feet are always ash.</p>
<p>I always have to wash off when I go back home,</p>
<p>and your shoes get ruined most of the time.</p>
<p>And it started, and I had this question,</p>
<p>and it was just like, wow, how come they have this?</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I was not being like, oh, you know,</p>
<p>how come they have all of this money?</p>
<p>I was not, it was just like, how come?</p>
<p>And I think what I was alluding to was,</p>
<p>how come life is so easy here, and back home it&rsquo;s not?</p>
<p>And easy, not in a negative sense, in a beautiful sense.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get, you know, just having traveled</p>
<p>through the war zone, just to come back,</p>
<p>traveling through Europe, back to America,</p>
<p>it just, I&rsquo;ll just get emotional just looking</p>
<p>at the efficiency of things, like how easy it is,</p>
<p>how we can, first of all, in Ukraine,</p>
<p>you currently can&rsquo;t fly, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a war zone.</p>
<p>Just even the transportation, you said roads.</p>
<p>Yeah, the quality of roads in the United States is amazing.</p>
<p>Just not, you know, many of the places</p>
<p>that drive in Ukraine, you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>I mean, really bad conditions of roads.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure in many parts of Africa</p>
<p>and many parts of the world, the roads are even worse.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And outdoor, you know, having an indoor toilet</p>
<p>is a fascinatingly awesome luxury to have.</p>
<p>It is, it is.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t take me wrong, Lex.</p>
<p>Do we have some great roads now in many parts of Africa?</p>
<p>Yes, main arteries, great roads,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, whoa, this is moving.</p>
<p>Yes, we do.</p>
<p>But definitely more today than in my time growing up.</p>
<p>Do we have, you know, a country like Nigeria</p>
<p>that just birthed six unicorns last year alone?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do we have the African youth out there</p>
<p>being so amazing and, you know, living their lives?</p>
<p>Yes, we have all of that.</p>
<p>But it is still, unfortunately,</p>
<p>just like we&rsquo;re scratching the surface.</p>
<p>And those people still are getting all of that accomplished</p>
<p>literally swimming through molasses.</p>
<p>This is some of the most gross,</p>
<p>immoral, unfair waste of human capital.</p>
<p>And so that is the, started with you as a seven year old</p>
<p>asking, wait a minute,</p>
<p>how do amazing people in Europe do this</p>
<p>and the amazing people in Africa don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s a key word, amazing.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what I realized later</p>
<p>because it was not always like that for me,</p>
<p>amazing and amazing, right?</p>
<p>I knew instinctively that of course we are amazing too.</p>
<p>But so eventually the question became how,</p>
<p>so I went from how come they have this and we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>to the country as I&rsquo;m growing up and researching</p>
<p>because it stayed with me.</p>
<p>When I tell you I&rsquo;m obsessed, I&rsquo;m haunted.</p>
<p>I am haunted.</p>
<p>So you can laugh all you want, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>so the question became, the question became,</p>
<p>how come some countries like the United States,</p>
<p>Singapore are rich and some others like mine</p>
<p>and many others in Africa are poor?</p>
<p>That became the question.</p>
<p>And along the line, like along the road,</p>
<p>I continued on living my life, wondering about this question.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard all types of reasons</p>
<p>as to supposedly why that might be the case.</p>
<p>Some people with a very straight face</p>
<p>are still peddling the IQ fury, according to which,</p>
<p>come on, darling, it&rsquo;s not your fault.</p>
<p>You know, your skin color goes with a gene sequence</p>
<p>that just doesn&rsquo;t allow you to be as smart</p>
<p>as white people are.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not your fault, but just accept it.</p>
<p>That stuff is still out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very real.</p>
<p>I and I have to hear it.</p>
<p>And others would say to me, oh, it&rsquo;s just because,</p>
<p>you know, you guys don&rsquo;t have adequate level of education.</p>
<p>And I say, you know, maybe you gotta go say that</p>
<p>to most of the street sellers you go see in Senegal.</p>
<p>You go up to any of these,</p>
<p>to many of these street sellers in Senegal,</p>
<p>they are wading through cars and moving cars</p>
<p>under the hot sun, fumes thrown at their face,</p>
<p>trying to sell you anything that you think</p>
<p>you might be able to use.</p>
<p>Whether we&rsquo;re talking about an ironing board</p>
<p>to an umbrella, to Q tips,</p>
<p>to, you know, toothpicks,</p>
<p>selling you whatever you need from your car,</p>
<p>these are street sellers.</p>
<p>And you ask them, dear, do you have any degree?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have this great degree in math</p>
<p>or in literature or whatever.</p>
<p>Some very, very educated people.</p>
<p>Yet they&rsquo;re right there, this is what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just at scale wasted human potential.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So that has to do, the wasted human potential</p>
<p>has to do now with the system,</p>
<p>with something about the laws.</p>
<p>Which is, yeah.</p>
<p>Something about sort of the things that limit</p>
<p>or enable the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Yes, because at that point I&rsquo;ve heard this,</p>
<p>you know, I heard people say,</p>
<p>yeah, your IQ is no good.</p>
<p>Yeah, you don&rsquo;t have enough degrees</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not educated.</p>
<p>Yeah, some people would even say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because you guys are malnourished,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re malnourished, you need to be fed.</p>
<p>Others, oh, well, maybe I&rsquo;ll give you some shoes</p>
<p>and maybe something is gonna change, whatever.</p>
<p>And then, so I heard all of this nonsense, Lex,</p>
<p>but you guess what, but guess what?</p>
<p>None of them made sense.</p>
<p>You know why it didn&rsquo;t make sense?</p>
<p>Because if any of that crap was true,</p>
<p>why, oh, why is it that my parents</p>
<p>or any other people from these places,</p>
<p>and oh, and by the way,</p>
<p>some people call those places God forsaken land.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also the type of cred you always have to hear</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not just flat out,</p>
<p>SHIT whole countries from, you know,</p>
<p>one person a few years ago, president of this country.</p>
<p>That sentiment is sometimes there.</p>
<p>It is, it is.</p>
<p>As I go on with my life,</p>
<p>trying to find the answer to why are some countries</p>
<p>like mine poor while others are rich,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing all of these reasons thrown at me.</p>
<p>And then they make no sense because then how come then</p>
<p>if my parents move as it is usually anyone else</p>
<p>who moves from a poorer nation</p>
<p>to a nation that supposedly is rich,</p>
<p>all of a sudden they get to manifest the greatest potential.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m starting to think this has nothing to do</p>
<p>with a person per se,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about the same person,</p>
<p>same background, same name, features, everything.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m starting to think</p>
<p>maybe it doesn&rsquo;t have to do with a person.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re talking about something that has to do</p>
<p>with a place that they came from</p>
<p>or the place that they&rsquo;re going to.</p>
<p>So this little thing is starting to be in my mind.</p>
<p>Again, remember, this is not something</p>
<p>that I woke up to overnight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, voila, I got my question.</p>
<p>It took me for a long time.</p>
<p>And I had to face off</p>
<p>to have many different ideologies face each other.</p>
<p>I had to really have a reckoning</p>
<p>literally in my heart and in my mind.</p>
<p>And so then that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>
<p>It cannot be, no, no, no, it&rsquo;s the same people.</p>
<p>It has to be about the place.</p>
<p>It has to be about the place, but then what about this place?</p>
<p>But then even about the place, you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>again, two countries, different backgrounds, same outcome,</p>
<p>same background, different outcome.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>And then I go on.</p>
<p>I start, I am in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>in the late 90s, early 2000s,</p>
<p>that come boom, all of that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m starting to discover this concept</p>
<p>of this thing called entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>and just getting to experience what seems so cliche by now,</p>
<p>but you know, people getting together</p>
<p>in the back of a napkin, talking about an idea,</p>
<p>putting it out, and then they go out</p>
<p>and they talk to some of these investors</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna invest in it.</p>
<p>Then they have the lawyers</p>
<p>who get to put all of this stuff together.</p>
<p>And then they have the big four CPA firms,</p>
<p>this whole ecosystem of what they call entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>And then eventually this concept of entrepreneurship</p>
<p>being this idea of creating something out of nothing.</p>
<p>So there I am.</p>
<p>And at some point I become an entrepreneur myself.</p>
<p>And the way I became an entrepreneur was not like,</p>
<p>I woke up and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I wanna make money, so I&rsquo;m gonna become an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>No, and this is also another problem I have with people</p>
<p>who have a problem with entrepreneurs or business people.</p>
<p>Most entrepreneurs do not start a business to become rich.</p>
<p>Most entrepreneurs start a business</p>
<p>because they have found, identified a problem</p>
<p>that bothered them enough,</p>
<p>that they said, enough is enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do something about it.</p>
<p>What entrepreneurs are are people who criticize by creating.</p>
<p>Do they always get it right?</p>
<p>No, as a matter of fact,</p>
<p>the failure in entrepreneurship is humongous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kamikaze path to take the entrepreneurship path.</p>
<p>We lose our spouses.</p>
<p>My first husband passed away</p>
<p>as soon as I was about to sign my first term sheet.</p>
<p>And yet I had to keep going.</p>
<p>What force can keep you going</p>
<p>after you just lost the love of your life?</p>
<p>What force keeps you going?</p>
<p>The force of, oh, I just wanna be rich, really?</p>
<p>When your whole world is upside down,</p>
<p>your whole world is upside down and you just want to quit.</p>
<p>You just want to go meet him and join him in death.</p>
<p>I stayed, why?</p>
<p>Because of the same reason why I started my company.</p>
<p>I stayed because of the women</p>
<p>whom I had put back to work by then.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about some of the most vulnerable women</p>
<p>in my country.</p>
<p>These are women who grow the hibiscus,</p>
<p>which we need to make the bisap,</p>
<p>which is the juice of taranga, remember?</p>
<p>This is our national identity drink.</p>
<p>And for the longest time, women grow this hibiscus</p>
<p>that we use for the national drink, for this drink.</p>
<p>And now that Coca Cola, Pepsi, and all that</p>
<p>had made it through the marketing</p>
<p>that it is more cool to drink those beverages,</p>
<p>now there is no more market for the hibiscus.</p>
<p>And with that goes the livelihoods of these women.</p>
<p>And for me, that bothered me enough</p>
<p>because in that force, I saw two things.</p>
<p>One was a part of my culture.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about, I mean,</p>
<p>part of my cultural identity, for Christ&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>the juice of taranga.</p>
<p>You asked me, what defines you?</p>
<p>I said, taranga, there&rsquo;s a juice for it.</p>
<p>So my culture is disappearing.</p>
<p>And at the same time, these women</p>
<p>are sliding into abject poverty</p>
<p>because what they used to make no one needs anymore.</p>
<p>So that is what got me to start a company.</p>
<p>And the company was created just because of that.</p>
<p>I wanted to build a company that would allow me</p>
<p>to not only preserve this very important aspect</p>
<p>of my cultural identity,</p>
<p>and at the same time, put these women back to work.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s more difficult to put into words,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a kind of, it&rsquo;s a basic human spirit</p>
<p>where you see the place where you came from</p>
<p>breaking apart in some kind of way,</p>
<p>and you have the entrepreneurial fire</p>
<p>that dreams of helping.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that, sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to convert that into words.</p>
<p>You have to tell nice stories and so on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the basic human desire to help.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And like I said, criticized by creating.</p>
<p>Especially when you&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>especially when, and let&rsquo;s face it,</p>
<p>do we all, are we all a bundle of circumstances,</p>
<p>some happy, some worse?</p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p>And oftentimes I ask myself, my God, why you?</p>
<p>Why did you get to have the opportunities that you have?</p>
<p>What makes you different from, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>even your cousin that couldn&rsquo;t, that is still home, trapped?</p>
<p>Because we call ourselves trapped citizens.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re trapped in these countries that go nowhere,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like a bunch of trapped citizens.</p>
<p>So you see, Lex, when my husband passed away</p>
<p>and I wanted nothing more to do than to quit</p>
<p>and to send, investors had already said,</p>
<p>we understand if you want to stop.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide to do, we&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>And I wanted to quit and I was actually on my way.</p>
<p>I was in Senegal for a month,</p>
<p>trying to really get a bearing over myself.</p>
<p>And by the end of the month, I had decided I&rsquo;m letting go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p>The pain was too great, nothing made sense anymore.</p>
<p>It was too much.</p>
<p>So I went to see this woman and I talked to the one who,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re talking back then,</p>
<p>there were 400 of them, later on we grew to 9,000.</p>
<p>And I told the representative of all of them,</p>
<p>and I told her, this is very, this is her old lady.</p>
<p>And just looking at her,</p>
<p>I knew I was going through some pain,</p>
<p>but this woman has probably gone through 10 times,</p>
<p>not that pain is, you know, like measurable,</p>
<p>but you could tell this woman probably lost a child</p>
<p>as oftentimes happen in places, you know,</p>
<p>that are lower income countries.</p>
<p>Probably lost a husband also, probably who knows,</p>
<p>so many people, loss is part of our lives.</p>
<p>You can see the pain.</p>
<p>You can see the pain, yet she&rsquo;s so, so dignified.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s so dignified.</p>
<p>And that already kind of made me like,</p>
<p>my God, stop crying.</p>
<p>But, and I told her that I was quitting.</p>
<p>I could not look her in the eyes.</p>
<p>And she said, look at me.</p>
<p>I could not look her in the eyes.</p>
<p>She said, look at me, child.</p>
<p>And I looked at her and she said,</p>
<p>you know, I know you&rsquo;re in pain,</p>
<p>but where your husband is, where your beloved is,</p>
<p>is absolutely nothing that you can do for him.</p>
<p>But for us, you can change everything.</p>
<p>And I went back.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what entrepreneurs are at their best.</p>
<p>Did she help you find your strength?</p>
<p>Yes, and I was weak still,</p>
<p>but I said, you put that aside.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a job to do here.</p>
<p>And I went back and I fought with everything that I had.</p>
<p>And this company that I started in my kitchen</p>
<p>became this company that had the who&rsquo;s who</p>
<p>of the beverage world,</p>
<p>with at some point, Roger Enrico, the chairman of PepsiCo</p>
<p>sitting on my board.</p>
<p>And yeah, I went back because of that.</p>
<p>So the reason why I tell this story for me is important</p>
<p>because the world needs to understand</p>
<p>that there is a viable way of caring</p>
<p>and of being part of a solution</p>
<p>for the lesser fortunate</p>
<p>in terms of not keeping them where they are</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like the saviors coming</p>
<p>and giving them food and all that.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just like the leg up I got in my life.</p>
<p>Give somebody else a leg up.</p>
<p>What are the things you&rsquo;re fighting against in Africa</p>
<p>when you try to build a business like that?</p>
<p>So then we&rsquo;re building this company.</p>
<p>And back then, this was in 2004</p>
<p>that was when I built my first company.</p>
<p>We had to have two sister companies, one there, one here.</p>
<p>So the one in Africa was about the whole supply chain.</p>
<p>And the one in America was research and development,</p>
<p>sales and marketing, all of that good stuff.</p>
<p>And then at some point I look around,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wait a second.</p>
<p>Here, back in the days before we had the,</p>
<p>they would talk, they would say, oh, we have this one stop shop</p>
<p>for business registration.</p>
<p>But the truth is very quickly</p>
<p>you can set up an LLC in the US.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about less than, even then less than,</p>
<p>today it&rsquo;s super fast, 20 minutes online, done.</p>
<p>Back then it was less than few hours to get it done,</p>
<p>cost you almost nothing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a few hundred dollars,</p>
<p>three, two to 350 depending which state you are.</p>
<p>So LLC, starting a basic company takes almost no time.</p>
<p>No time, no time, no money, almost.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to know a guy that knows a guy</p>
<p>that slipped some money to the politician and so on.</p>
<p>No, none of that stuff, none of that stuff.</p>
<p>And so at the same time, also things like,</p>
<p>and this I can take you even to today&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Okay, Lex, I don&rsquo;t know if you have employees</p>
<p>on payroll or anything like that,</p>
<p>but do you have to go every month</p>
<p>or anybody listening to us right now,</p>
<p>do they have to go every single month</p>
<p>to three different type of agencies,</p>
<p>like governmental agencies to do one step?</p>
<p>This one is basically you&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>and give them your retirement money,</p>
<p>like the pension part of the salary</p>
<p>that you took out from your employee.</p>
<p>You have to go to this agency</p>
<p>and put that application through.</p>
<p>So you leave that money behind,</p>
<p>then you go to another agency.</p>
<p>This one is for the health, care, whatever.</p>
<p>You have three of those places</p>
<p>where you have to literally go to in person,</p>
<p>three times, three places every single month</p>
<p>to drop off these paperwork.</p>
<p>Do you have to do that anywhere in the US?</p>
<p>I mean, do we have that situation</p>
<p>anywhere that you know of right now?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>And do you think that&rsquo;s a business friendly</p>
<p>or do you think it&rsquo;s cumbersome in business?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not just cumbersome sort of physically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cumbersome psychologically,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a feeling like the system around you,</p>
<p>yeah, there&rsquo;s a feeling like you&rsquo;re trapped.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feeling like the system doesn&rsquo;t want you to succeed</p>
<p>versus a system that does want you to succeed.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a country like we&rsquo;re in Texas.</p>
<p>If you make less than a million bucks in revenues a year,</p>
<p>all you do, five minutes it takes you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re filing your franchise tax, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s below that number, tell them what it is,</p>
<p>then you have nothing to give them</p>
<p>or anything like that, you move on.</p>
<p>Us, even if I make this much,</p>
<p>there is a minimum tax that you have to pay,</p>
<p>which is $1,000 in Senegal right now.</p>
<p>For the listener, my guy was holding up a zero.</p>
<p>You make no money.</p>
<p>You still have to pay.</p>
<p>And then, oh, let me walk you through what happened to me</p>
<p>when we had to try to get the electricity hooked up</p>
<p>on our first office.</p>
<p>So we go, they say, oh, first you have to apply,</p>
<p>you know, like you normally you have to apply.</p>
<p>Then we apply, we pay the money.</p>
<p>Remember again, here you have to also go,</p>
<p>this was like, you know, you go to the office and you pay.</p>
<p>And then we wait, and we wait, and we wait.</p>
<p>And when I say we wait, I&rsquo;m not talking about</p>
<p>we waited 24 hours, we waited 48 hours.</p>
<p>A month, two months, three months, four months,</p>
<p>five months, you go, you send your assistant,</p>
<p>she goes, she comes back.</p>
<p>Well, they say we send it to wait.</p>
<p>At some point I&rsquo;m like, I gotta go there.</p>
<p>So I go there and I asked to speak</p>
<p>to the head of the district for, you know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just like going on and on and on and on</p>
<p>about how we&rsquo;ve been delayed.</p>
<p>This is gonna be a problem.</p>
<p>We have to produce, everything is delayed.</p>
<p>And I risk losing my business.</p>
<p>We already presold some of these products to our customers.</p>
<p>I gotta, something needs to happen.</p>
<p>So at some point the gentleman looks at me,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, lady, look over there.</p>
<p>I look over there, I see a pile of paper this high.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about maybe hundreds of applications.</p>
<p>Each one of them is a single sheet.</p>
<p>Each single sheet is an application</p>
<p>for getting the electricity.</p>
<p>And he says, do you see that?</p>
<p>I said, yeah.</p>
<p>And he said, look over there.</p>
<p>I look over there to the other side.</p>
<p>I see two meters.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, each of these applications needs one of those.</p>
<p>How many do you see?</p>
<p>I said, two.</p>
<p>Then I knew I was in trouble.</p>
<p>And then I said, what do I do?</p>
<p>And he said, lady, it&rsquo;s not at our level.</p>
<p>And I agreed with him.</p>
<p>It was not on his level.</p>
<p>But eventually, by now you can tell</p>
<p>that I pretty much get what I need because,</p>
<p>and at that point what I did was not threaten him</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even pay a bribe or anything,</p>
<p>but you could see why people pay bribes.</p>
<p>Because when you have a pile like that,</p>
<p>then the only way to advance your file,</p>
<p>and that by the way happens even at the passport office.</p>
<p>You come, you apply for your passport, which is your right.</p>
<p>They forced us to have passports.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your right as a citizen to have a passport.</p>
<p>And even there, if you want yours</p>
<p>to keep going through the process,</p>
<p>you have to bribe somebody so it can go</p>
<p>even the pace it&rsquo;s supposed to go, let alone faster.</p>
<p>So here, I&rsquo;m thinking I have a problem.</p>
<p>And at that point, I did what I do.</p>
<p>I talked to him about all the things I was trying to do.</p>
<p>I explained to him why I&rsquo;m here, why I&rsquo;m trying to do this.</p>
<p>And even him said, lady, someone like you,</p>
<p>you have no reason to even be here.</p>
<p>You could be back in America, living your life,</p>
<p>la vida loca, you don&rsquo;t have to be here.</p>
<p>So that I think gained a lot of his respect.</p>
<p>And I said, if you don&rsquo;t do, if you don&rsquo;t help me with this,</p>
<p>I understand I shouldn&rsquo;t be of a priority</p>
<p>or anything like that, but I beg you, I beg of you.</p>
<p>I need for this to go on this week.</p>
<p>And he said, okay, that&rsquo;s how I got my meter.</p>
<p>One of those two meters became mine.</p>
<p>So then he said, but we have a problem.</p>
<p>And I said, what?</p>
<p>He said, well, the truck, we need a truck to be here</p>
<p>to do it because of where you are from the poll,</p>
<p>we need long cable lines to get it all done.</p>
<p>But the truck is, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the truck was</p>
<p>because they had this one truck</p>
<p>for I don&rsquo;t know how many customers.</p>
<p>So I go to the mayor of a town</p>
<p>with whom I&rsquo;m quite friends, but you see, I know people,</p>
<p>but it shouldn&rsquo;t be this way.</p>
<p>So I go to the mayor of a town and I said, mayor,</p>
<p>he happens to have the same name as me,</p>
<p>first, last name, same, but except he&rsquo;s the ugly one,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the pretty one because, you know, he&rsquo;s, you know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so people can tell you apart, she&rsquo;s the pretty one.</p>
<p>Exactly, I&rsquo;m the pretty one and he&rsquo;s the whatever.</p>
<p>So I got to the mayor and I&rsquo;m like, mayor,</p>
<p>I need your help, you need to help me with this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, now what?</p>
<p>And I explained to him and he&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>you can take the truck from the city hall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell the guys that they can allow you to have it.</p>
<p>And then they come and then you guys can do this.</p>
<p>And then we arrived there.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>I thought I was done, Lex, but I was not done.</p>
<p>Because now the electricity company, by the way,</p>
<p>whom we paid, everything was there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been sitting on our money for nine months by now.</p>
<p>Well, we need a ladder long enough to, you know,</p>
<p>like one of the super, super professional ladders</p>
<p>that normally the electricity companies have.</p>
<p>Theirs was in some other village and they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if it was going to be back for another three days</p>
<p>or four days.</p>
<p>I said, are you kidding me?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no.</p>
<p>So I call mayor again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, mayor, do you have a ladder?</p>
<p>And I explained and he said,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how I got my electricity hooked up.</p>
<p>Otherwise I probably would still be waiting.</p>
<p>So Lex, you add all of these things together.</p>
<p>And also the fact that in my country, by the way,</p>
<p>the labor laws are so stringent.</p>
<p>Basically you are married to employees for good or for bad.</p>
<p>And some people say, oh no,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not married for good or for bad,</p>
<p>except that it will just cost you a lot of time and money</p>
<p>to get rid of any of them.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter the circumstances.</p>
<p>Do you think I really, an entrepreneur really need</p>
<p>to hear something like that?</p>
<p>You know, the head of the ILO,</p>
<p>I had an argument with him at the UN.</p>
<p>And I said to him, listen, and you listened to me very well.</p>
<p>The reason, if you want to protect employees,</p>
<p>as you claim, everything you&rsquo;re doing is to protect employees.</p>
<p>A, you know better of a human being than I am</p>
<p>in terms of wanting to make sure</p>
<p>that people are treated right and fairly.</p>
<p>But last time I checked, Google, for example,</p>
<p>is not offering their employees chef cooked meals,</p>
<p>super healthy, anything they want,</p>
<p>feeding them from morning till evening,</p>
<p>having some babysitters, having childcare on site,</p>
<p>all of these perks that come on top of really cozy salaries.</p>
<p>It did not happen because you, the ILO, told them,</p>
<p>you have to do this.</p>
<p>It happened because there are enough jobs created around</p>
<p>that now you&rsquo;re in an employee&rsquo;s market</p>
<p>and employers have to fall all over themselves</p>
<p>to attract the best talent among us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>And not with your nonsense that you&rsquo;re imposing me right now,</p>
<p>which the only results you&rsquo;re gonna get,</p>
<p>like in my country, do you know what we have to show</p>
<p>for all of these, the fact that the Senegalese employees,</p>
<p>the most protected employee on paper in the world?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re one of the 25 poorest countries in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it got us.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to just untangle this.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a system in place.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a momentum with that system.</p>
<p>Like you said, ladies, it&rsquo;s not my level,</p>
<p>which is for somebody who grew up in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>at least echoes some of the same sounds I heard</p>
<p>from people I knew there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of this helpless feeling like,</p>
<p>well, this is just part of the system,</p>
<p>this gigantic bureaucracy.</p>
<p>And the corruption that happens is just like the only way</p>
<p>to get around, to get anything done.</p>
<p>And so the corruption grows.</p>
<p>Maybe could you speak to the corruption?</p>
<p>Is there, to what degree is there corruption</p>
<p>in Senegal and Africa, and how do we fix it?</p>
<p>So when you said to which degrees there is corruption,</p>
<p>I will respond to you the same I respond to people.</p>
<p>I say, yeah, we have corruption,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost as bad as in Chicago, right?</p>
<p>So now what I want people to understand</p>
<p>when it comes to corruption,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because we are misguided with corruption.</p>
<p>We think corruption is the root cause of problems.</p>
<p>When corruption is simply a symptom</p>
<p>of the deeper root problem.</p>
<p>In this case, if you make the laws so senseless,</p>
<p>meaning, let me give you an example of senseless laws.</p>
<p>Every time I have to import something in my country,</p>
<p>I have a business, we&rsquo;re making lip balms in this case</p>
<p>and all those skincare products.</p>
<p>Some ingredients I&rsquo;m able to find in the country</p>
<p>at the standard that I need in order to remain competitive.</p>
<p>Because for example, our products are sold</p>
<p>at Whole Foods Market.</p>
<p>You can understand it&rsquo;s a pretty sophisticated</p>
<p>and really, they don&rsquo;t just put anybody on the shelves.</p>
<p>But the thing is, it means that on the other end,</p>
<p>my inputs has to be right.</p>
<p>So out of those, some, we have seven ingredients,</p>
<p>seven items that need to come from abroad</p>
<p>to go into the making of this product.</p>
<p>Some packaging and some raw material.</p>
<p>But guess what, Lex, for five of them,</p>
<p>I am paying a 40% tariff</p>
<p>and for the other two, almost 70% tariff.</p>
<p>That I call senseless laws.</p>
<p>These tariffs are senseless.</p>
<p>Yeah, corruption is just a symptom.</p>
<p>They reveal that something was broken about the laws.</p>
<p>And the laws are, so taxation,</p>
<p>this kind of restricting laws,</p>
<p>like laws that slow down the entrepreneurial momentum.</p>
<p>They do, they do.</p>
<p>Because in this case, when my product comes,</p>
<p>what do people have to do?</p>
<p>Because every time, if you add 40%,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically on the other end.</p>
<p>So every time you add,</p>
<p>if let&rsquo;s say my product normally costs a dollar</p>
<p>and with your 40%, by the time I&rsquo;m done,</p>
<p>I had to pay, now it&rsquo;s costing me 140.</p>
<p>By the time it arrives in my warehouse,</p>
<p>in my manufacturing facility, it&rsquo;s now at 140</p>
<p>because of a tariff I left behind.</p>
<p>That 40% you added to it,</p>
<p>do you know how much it&rsquo;s gonna add to my final cost</p>
<p>that once the product is finished,</p>
<p>I have to sell it to the customer?</p>
<p>I have to sell it for $1.60 more because of that 40 cents</p>
<p>extra you took from me.</p>
<p>In order for me at the end of the day</p>
<p>to have some type of profits,</p>
<p>because profits at the end of the day</p>
<p>is the blood of a business.</p>
<p>There are two people are misguided.</p>
<p>They say, oh, you dirty, greedy business people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all about profit, profit, profit, profit.</p>
<p>You know, I belong to this organization called,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a board member on the conscious capitalism.</p>
<p>It is the largest organization of purpose driven</p>
<p>businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The type of people I told you about,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve started our businesses because we see something</p>
<p>that needs to be taken care of in society.</p>
<p>Whole Foods Market is one of them.</p>
<p>The Container Store, you know,</p>
<p>all of these companies that are beloved in the US</p>
<p>that you can hear of.</p>
<p>We believe that the end goal of business is purpose.</p>
<p>But in order to do purpose,</p>
<p>you have to have profits to stay alive.</p>
<p>And the best way for people to think of profits</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re not all twisted about it.</p>
<p>Lex, if I asked you, what&rsquo;s your goal in the world?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably gonna tell me your dream.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna talk to me about what you&rsquo;re doing right now</p>
<p>and how you want to be uniting,</p>
<p>or you want a more harmonious world.</p>
<p>You want human flourishing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re working towards.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you say to me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna say, well, my biggest goal in the world</p>
<p>is to produce as many red blood cells as I can.</p>
<p>Except you need to produce those, otherwise no Lex.</p>
<p>And if no Lex, no one working.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how people need to stop</p>
<p>with this whole profit, non profit.</p>
<p>Do we have some psychopaths among us?</p>
<p>Yeah, one person of us in this world are psychopaths</p>
<p>in every field, anywhere you look.</p>
<p>And surely you&rsquo;ll find that in the entrepreneurial field.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs world as well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we have one person of us who are psychopath for sure.</p>
<p>But do they define the rest of us?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>And thankfully not.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just be clear on that.</p>
<p>So here, you know, you charge me 40% tariff,</p>
<p>which is outrageous.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re forcing me to sell it for $1.60 more</p>
<p>than my competitor who does not have to go</p>
<p>through that nonsense because she&rsquo;s an American woman</p>
<p>who is operating in America.</p>
<p>And she doesn&rsquo;t have that nonsense put on her.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m on this market competing against this woman</p>
<p>eye to eye.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re selling the same value product,</p>
<p>mine costs $1.60 more simply because of some stupid rules</p>
<p>from back home, then guess who is going to stay in business</p>
<p>and who doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>See, they want to talk about equality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the type of equality I want to see.</p>
<p>The playing field has to be leveled.</p>
<p>Told you English is my fourth language.</p>
<p>It was two people talking between us.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll have this English thing figured out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have it figured out.</p>
<p>So the idea of capitalism,</p>
<p>the idea of conscious capitalism is the thing</p>
<p>that in large part enables this level playing field.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we want.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re trying to say, so here,</p>
<p>so when I talked about census laws, that&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>So when you make the tariff so high</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to render me, you know, noncompetitive,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s where, for people who might make sense,</p>
<p>when the product arrives at port, they say,</p>
<p>hey, I give you this.</p>
<p>What I give you, maybe it&rsquo;s 10% of the price or 5%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surely not 40%, but you are happy with it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the government official.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we call a bribe.</p>
<p>And me, I&rsquo;m like, hey, I saved myself money.</p>
<p>And also I saved myself time.</p>
<p>But you see, if the laws where you pay 5%</p>
<p>or even the 10% that I just left behind or nothing,</p>
<p>you come, you pay it, you move on.</p>
<p>Because who has a business of fooling around</p>
<p>and staying behind?</p>
<p>And no, you do that when it&rsquo;s actually makes sense to do that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sitting here telling people</p>
<p>I engage in unlawful practices in my case,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m around saying the things I&rsquo;m saying right now.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a target.</p>
<p>You have to do things cleanly.</p>
<p>And I believe in doing things that way.</p>
<p>So what I had to do was go to the ask again mayor.</p>
<p>We have a problem.</p>
<p>Mayors, whenever he sees me, he&rsquo;s like, now what?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, we&rsquo;ve got a problem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re best friends now.</p>
<p>So I say, now it&rsquo;s the customs.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, what do you want me to do?</p>
<p>I said, do you know anybody at customs?</p>
<p>I need to hire up at customs,</p>
<p>because I got to explain to them what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>They all know, of course,</p>
<p>but I think they&rsquo;re not always maybe understanding</p>
<p>or maybe they understand.</p>
<p>And in this case, he understood.</p>
<p>So we went and he&rsquo;s like, yeah, I know this is not,</p>
<p>this is not very, yeah, this.</p>
<p>And I said, what do we do now?</p>
<p>And I saw him going through binders and binders</p>
<p>in his office, because he&rsquo;s going to try to go and look</p>
<p>where in the law can we find something</p>
<p>that can help me escape these rules.</p>
<p>And you know, the best he found Lex was,</p>
<p>oh, well here, see this one.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been in business for two years,</p>
<p>then we can allow you, there&rsquo;s a special term for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s French, it&rsquo;s technical.</p>
<p>We can allow you to bring your raw material,</p>
<p>but you have to tell us exactly how much you&rsquo;re bringing.</p>
<p>And it has to match your formulation because, you know,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want you to bring in more that we need</p>
<p>and maybe sell some of that to the rest of the market</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t make their money on it.</p>
<p>So there, it means I have to give them my recipe.</p>
<p>Imagine Coca Cola being asked to give their secret sauce</p>
<p>to government officials in a country</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t even know what might happen,</p>
<p>let alone even in business, you don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I mean, trade secrets are trade secrets,</p>
<p>but here you&rsquo;re asked to be putting it in front</p>
<p>of some people you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s going to go after that.</p>
<p>Because there they get to see, okay,</p>
<p>her recipe calls for X amount of Candelilla Wax,</p>
<p>X amount of coconut oil.</p>
<p>Okay, and on top of that,</p>
<p>we have to think about how much foliage might there be or not</p>
<p>because again, we don&rsquo;t want her to buffer it over there.</p>
<p>So you have to get naked in front of them</p>
<p>in terms of your recipe,</p>
<p>which might end up only God knows where tomorrow,</p>
<p>maybe competition or maybe even them,</p>
<p>they start a business and they compete with you</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve seen that.</p>
<p>So you have to do that.</p>
<p>And then each time fill out a paperwork,</p>
<p>get the approval, then it can come in.</p>
<p>So when it can come in, you don&rsquo;t have to pay the tax.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, you have one year,</p>
<p>one year to make this product and get it out.</p>
<p>And all of it needs to be back out</p>
<p>because if any of it stays here,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to pay the taxes that we held up.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically forced by these census laws</p>
<p>to be dishonest if you want to succeed.</p>
<p>All of this is so cumbersome</p>
<p>because it means more paperwork, paperwork everywhere,</p>
<p>maybe having to disclose your things.</p>
<p>So me, in my case, what I did is this person said,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re going to see how we can work with you.</p>
<p>But for the first two years,</p>
<p>we were more or less in the gray area.</p>
<p>Yeah, so even gray area is good.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what does it mean?</p>
<p>In a situation like that,</p>
<p>whenever they want to mess with you,</p>
<p>it means they can come and they will look</p>
<p>and they will find something.</p>
<p>So it means that every day I&rsquo;m trying to do business,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m running the risk of being harassed</p>
<p>and or maybe even put in jail, depending on what it is.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re an incredible person</p>
<p>because it seems like there&rsquo;s two ways to change this.</p>
<p>One is to become president or gain power in the country</p>
<p>and to try to change the laws,</p>
<p>which seems really difficult to do.</p>
<p>And the other way is fight through the laws</p>
<p>and create the business anyway,</p>
<p>build the business community and through that method,</p>
<p>create a huge amount of pressure to change the laws.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re totally getting it with your last part</p>
<p>because this is the other thing.</p>
<p>And this is where I get so upset sometimes</p>
<p>with my fellow Africans</p>
<p>because they get so disgusted by what they&rsquo;re seeing, right?</p>
<p>And they think the answer is to go for politics.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go be president.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go be this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go be that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna change everything.</p>
<p>I see that in the US too.</p>
<p>People thinking that presidents have all this power.</p>
<p>Do you know who has the least power in government?</p>
<p>The president.</p>
<p>I mean, people don&rsquo;t get that.</p>
<p>Your best bet, if you insist on going into politics,</p>
<p>stick to the local level.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where all the skeletons are buried and hidden.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you can make the most impact, local level.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not shiny.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not exciting, but that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>So if you must go into politics, but there&rsquo;s another way.</p>
<p>So in my case, what I do is two things.</p>
<p>I preach and I practice.</p>
<p>I preach, when I&rsquo;m here talking to you about this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m preaching.</p>
<p>I am sharing with people that is which I found.</p>
<p>And by the way, the answer was there.</p>
<p>I was doing these two businesses,</p>
<p>realizing the difference in treatment</p>
<p>of the doing business environment</p>
<p>of the US compared to the doing business environment</p>
<p>of Senegal.</p>
<p>And at first I was like, of course, us,</p>
<p>everything is messed up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re a poor country.</p>
<p>But when I started to put two and two together,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re poor because you have no money,</p>
<p>at least not enough money to take care of your basic needs.</p>
<p>You have no money because you have no source of income.</p>
<p>Where does a source of income come from for most of us?</p>
<p>It comes from a job, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>And then some people, sometimes at my UC Berkeley class,</p>
<p>they say, oh no, it comes from government too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I would like to think that even if you work</p>
<p>for government, you&rsquo;re going to be paid something, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yeah.</p>
<p>And then even before I can say something, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, because that money we use to pay our public officials</p>
<p>comes from taxes, you know, employers, employees,</p>
<p>we go back to the private sector for most of it,</p>
<p>from where this whole thing is created.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clear, you&rsquo;re poor because you have no money,</p>
<p>no money because no source of income,</p>
<p>source of income for most of us is a job.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about, so where do jobs come from?</p>
<p>The private sector, primarily small</p>
<p>and medium sized enterprises.</p>
<p>Then don&rsquo;t you think that we should make it easy,</p>
<p>that we should have a friendly doing business environment.</p>
<p>And also a lot of it comes not just from the small</p>
<p>and medium sized businesses, but I think a lot</p>
<p>of the values created from new ones being launched, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just like me, like saving somehow</p>
<p>through regulation, the ones that are already there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like letting the market,</p>
<p>letting the new better ideas flourish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about what I mean by doing business environment</p>
<p>is all the things that you and I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Even the access of electricity is part</p>
<p>of a doing business, but doing business.</p>
<p>So basically when I discovered all of that,</p>
<p>when I put all of those dots together,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m like, well, I guess the business,</p>
<p>and it makes sense, Lex.</p>
<p>If you want to grow tomatoes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to have two things.</p>
<p>One is a good seed, right, that has good attributes.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re gonna have to have a good environment</p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>Is the soil the right one?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your pH level?</p>
<p>All of those good nutrients that you&rsquo;re gonna put in it.</p>
<p>Is it in a place that has tons of sun?</p>
<p>How much sun exposure or not?</p>
<p>The climate in general, is it gonna be cold?</p>
<p>Not, not.</p>
<p>You can have some beautiful tomatoes</p>
<p>in the middle of Siberia, last time I checked.</p>
<p>So same thing here.</p>
<p>You know, Mohammed Yunus, the Nobel Laureate for Peace,</p>
<p>said, poor people are bonsai people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the same people.</p>
<p>If you put them in the normal, natural, friendly habitat</p>
<p>where they can thrive, they become the tallest tree</p>
<p>in the forest.</p>
<p>Poor people are bonsai people.</p>
<p>So you see that tiny pot you put around the bonsai tree?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the tiny pot that&rsquo;s created</p>
<p>by giving me such a hostile business environment</p>
<p>that basically we&rsquo;re put together by the set of laws</p>
<p>that you have put, that basically I have to jump through</p>
<p>as a business person, practicing business in my country.</p>
<p>If you turn that environment into a friendly environment</p>
<p>where I am not married to my employees,</p>
<p>I have flexibility of the labor laws</p>
<p>are simple, straightforward, clean,</p>
<p>where the tax code is very simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not worth truckloads of laws like in my country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so complicated.</p>
<p>You have to hire a CPA, which costs more money.</p>
<p>And even them tell them, girl, we&rsquo;re gonna make some mistakes.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t talk to me like that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t tell me, girl, they shouldn&rsquo;t, they better not.</p>
<p>But they say, whatever they say.</p>
<p>They say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re gonna,</p>
<p>but bottom line is we&rsquo;re gonna make mistakes.</p>
<p>This thing is so complicated, we&rsquo;re gonna make mistakes.</p>
<p>So, which means my ass is on the line.</p>
<p>So anyway, so if the tax code was so simple,</p>
<p>straightforward, like it is maybe in Texas,</p>
<p>where up till a threshold, you owe me nothing,</p>
<p>go online, five minutes, fill out your taxes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re compliant, keep building your business</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what we need from you.</p>
<p>If you made it so easy and straightforward,</p>
<p>then you know what?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you get all of these people,</p>
<p>Lex, that you&rsquo;re talking about saying, you know what?</p>
<p>My name is Aminata,</p>
<p>and I live in the middle of nowhere, Senegal.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this great idea for this really hot,</p>
<p>nice hot sauce that I know the Americans are gonna love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing that hot sauce is a big thing.</p>
<p>Let me bring it to them.</p>
<p>But everything is there for you to jump</p>
<p>into the ring of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to know someone like my God.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to even have the ability</p>
<p>to sell yourself maybe like I can sometimes.</p>
<p>You are someone with a great idea.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re willing to work hard for it</p>
<p>and pour everything you got into it.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>You can get into the race.</p>
<p>You can be a dreamer,</p>
<p>and you can be a dreamer in a rural little village.</p>
<p>And then that has ripple effects</p>
<p>throughout the entire country.</p>
<p>Young kids growing up, you know,</p>
<p>I wanna be the next X, whatever.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the next Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>That seems really far, far away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at all levels.</p>
<p>You create local heroes because representation matters.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So, and we are so badly in need of that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what all the things</p>
<p>that have been stolen from us</p>
<p>as long as things remain the same.</p>
<p>So Lex, once I found out that basically at the end of the day</p>
<p>the answer is economic freedom.</p>
<p>And that when it comes to that,</p>
<p>the indexes, economic indexes that measure that,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the doing business index ranking</p>
<p>of the World Bank,</p>
<p>or the Fraser Economic Freedom Index</p>
<p>of the Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>When you look at all of those indexes and others,</p>
<p>what do they have in common?</p>
<p>One after another they show you</p>
<p>that it is harder to do business</p>
<p>in almost anywhere in Sub Saharan Africa</p>
<p>than it is per se anywhere in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>So it is telling you that Scandinavian nations,</p>
<p>that socialist Americans tend to love so much</p>
<p>and take as an example,</p>
<p>although there too they&rsquo;re showing you</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on really in Scandinavia,</p>
<p>that Scandinavia is more capitalist.</p>
<p>Scandinavian nations are more capitalist</p>
<p>than almost any Sub Saharan African nations.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the political systems</p>
<p>actually don&rsquo;t even matter nearly as much</p>
<p>as the private sector being able</p>
<p>to operate the machinery of capitalism.</p>
<p>There you go, there you go, there you go.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like, like I said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like its own little widget within it.</p>
<p>You can have whatever type of society</p>
<p>you want to practice,</p>
<p>you want to exercise at whatever level you want to.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re serious about becoming a capitalist,</p>
<p>becoming a middle to high income nation,</p>
<p>there is no other pathway that we know of at this point.</p>
<p>And you know what made me super excited about that</p>
<p>beyond having finally found my answer.</p>
<p>I have to tell you when I found that answer,</p>
<p>I literally fell to my knees.</p>
<p>It was the type of feeling that,</p>
<p>you know, if something is not well with you,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s physical or mental,</p>
<p>something is not well, you&rsquo;re not well.</p>
<p>And you go around and you go to the so called specialists,</p>
<p>some of them, you know,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going around for years,</p>
<p>going around trying to get help for your ailment.</p>
<p>And here they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Here they tell you things that you can&rsquo;t tell why,</p>
<p>but you just know it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re this, they&rsquo;re that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going on for years after year after year.</p>
<p>And finally you meet this one person</p>
<p>and boom, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Not only the liberation,</p>
<p>but also this whole new world that comes with it.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m still ill, but guess what?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a path forward.</p>
<p>We know that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have a lot of work to do, but there&rsquo;s hope.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you&rsquo;re the beacon of hope actually,</p>
<p>for a lot of people in that part of the world.</p>
<p>And those beacons are actually really necessary.</p>
<p>So not only is there hope, but you can become,</p>
<p>I mean, the beacon for your people, your home,</p>
<p>this power that you see that you feel all around</p>
<p>to become, to escape the feeling of being trapped.</p>
<p>Is there a device you can give to people that,</p>
<p>to young girls and boys dreaming somewhere in Africa</p>
<p>of how to change the world?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And by the way, I want to say there are bigger beacons.</p>
<p>There are better beacons than me.</p>
<p>I just happen to be someone who has the chance</p>
<p>of talking to you right now.</p>
<p>And one of my goals is to open the same doors</p>
<p>that were opened for me, because together, our voice,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s such amazing stories out there.</p>
<p>And so bigger beacons, better beacons out there.</p>
<p>One thing here for me, the reason why I do</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing right now, and it&rsquo;s almost to a point</p>
<p>of self destructing my own health.</p>
<p>I feel invested with such the mission of,</p>
<p>I have been afforded the truth.</p>
<p>So it is my moral duty to try to take it around.</p>
<p>I know I sound, people sometimes say,</p>
<p>when I listen to you, I feel like I&rsquo;m talking to a priest.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, because the gospel, I receive the gospel.</p>
<p>So anyway, but the thing is, Lex,</p>
<p>who tells you these things to this day?</p>
<p>When they talk about the poverty of Africa,</p>
<p>what do they talk about?</p>
<p>They sit in front telling you,</p>
<p>oh yeah, it&rsquo;s because of colonialism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of racism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of imperialism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re stealing raw material, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Is any of those guilty to some level of where we are today?</p>
<p>Maybe part of the reason where we are today?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe.</p>
<p>Is that the only reason or the overwhelming reasons?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is that insurmountable?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>So for me, don&rsquo;t stay in that place</p>
<p>that steals and robs you of your agency.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s important for people to A,</p>
<p>get the right diagnosis as to why we are where we are.</p>
<p>Because what you and I just talked about,</p>
<p>the mainstream does not talk about this</p>
<p>when they even talk about Africa</p>
<p>in terms that are not the usual suspect of,</p>
<p>oh, famine is building over there.</p>
<p>War is building over here.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re having Ebola is coming.</p>
<p>All of that stuff.</p>
<p>Even when they were talking about the monkeypox,</p>
<p>which at first, in this wave,</p>
<p>it started with white people in Europe.</p>
<p>Well, even in the many newspapers you pull out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s black people with monkeypox on their skin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wait a second.</p>
<p>This time around, it did not start with us.</p>
<p>So why are you always showing us</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s right now happening to white people?</p>
<p>So all of that is happening.</p>
<p>So for me, the thing is,</p>
<p>we, the world simply right now,</p>
<p>does not have the right diagnosis</p>
<p>as to why this continent right now,</p>
<p>despite all of its riches,</p>
<p>because Lord knows it&rsquo;s got riches</p>
<p>starting it with its young population.</p>
<p>75% of the population in my country</p>
<p>is below the age of 25 years old.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re talking, I know we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>repopulation, it&rsquo;s an important,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to go for that.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll get me going about comments,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but anyway.</p>
<p>So here, my point is,</p>
<p>A, we need the right diagnosis</p>
<p>as to why this continent is the poorest continent</p>
<p>in the world, despite its riches</p>
<p>starting with its young people,</p>
<p>all the natural resources, diversity in land,</p>
<p>people, cultures, languages,</p>
<p>everything that make for great ingredient for awesomeness.</p>
<p>Despite all of that,</p>
<p>we are the poorest region in the world.</p>
<p>People need to know that the reason why that is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because we also happen to be</p>
<p>the most overregulated region in the world.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, what Africa,</p>
<p>and I dare to say Africa here,</p>
<p>and treated as one,</p>
<p>we are 54 countries, 55 depending on how you count,</p>
<p>yet we almost for a tiny minority of these countries,</p>
<p>we almost all lack one of the most crucial freedoms</p>
<p>that there are.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about prosperity building,</p>
<p>we lack economic freedom.</p>
<p>And economic freedom is the thing</p>
<p>that unlocks that human potential of the young people just.</p>
<p>Yes, for them to run,</p>
<p>to run with their ideas, to start businesses,</p>
<p>or to start initiative.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be for profit all the time, right?</p>
<p>But it is this thing that gets you to get up</p>
<p>and go and do something, criticize by creating.</p>
<p>Young people are naturally wired</p>
<p>to wanna criticize by creating.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not sitting around waiting or complaining usually,</p>
<p>unless you put them in a tiny box</p>
<p>and they have no other way to go.</p>
<p>And in this situation, what they do,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about precolonial Africa,</p>
<p>of four favors before slavery ever happened.</p>
<p>There were black people on the continent.</p>
<p>You see, when we talk about the story of black people</p>
<p>and Africans, black people in Africa,</p>
<p>for most of us, even me,</p>
<p>I noticed that unconsciously it starts with slavery.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re like, no, we were there before,</p>
<p>before white men ever set foot.</p>
<p>Who were we?</p>
<p>What were we doing in our diversity?</p>
<p>What economic systems were we running on?</p>
<p>And then you realize that for most of them,</p>
<p>they were free marketeers</p>
<p>and they were very much on the free trade,</p>
<p>on the free enterprise side.</p>
<p>So even that is a reinforcement.</p>
<p>This is a place where we do not understand our history.</p>
<p>So proper diagnosis, Africa is a poorest region in the world</p>
<p>because it happens to be</p>
<p>the most overregulated region in the world,</p>
<p>lacks economic freedom.</p>
<p>Number two, what do we do about that?</p>
<p>We gotta become serious about reforms, economic reforms,</p>
<p>so that we can become beacons of free markets.</p>
<p>Just like the Asian tigers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the Asian tigers did.</p>
<p>They had to become serious.</p>
<p>Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea,</p>
<p>those guys had to become serious about the free markets.</p>
<p>Lee Kuan Woo, he&rsquo;s just like, we gotta do something.</p>
<p>And he looked around and he realized at some point,</p>
<p>we gotta make these reforms.</p>
<p>And he went onto that journey of reforms,</p>
<p>making his country one of the most free market countries</p>
<p>in the world, and voila, the magic happened.</p>
<p>Back in the 30s, the stock market crash</p>
<p>and the Great Depression and everything,</p>
<p>the world and with all the lies that were told</p>
<p>to the world coming from the Soviet Union, Stalin,</p>
<p>while they were starving and dying over there,</p>
<p>but oh no, I mean, Durante was telling the world that,</p>
<p>oh no, no, everything is going well,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s dying when we know now</p>
<p>and getting political prices based on this stuff.</p>
<p>But then the world went on believing that,</p>
<p>oh no, capitalism failed.</p>
<p>This crash that you had in the stock market</p>
<p>is proof this is what late stage capitalism produces.</p>
<p>You guys always have your big ups and downs.</p>
<p>And by that time, it was so hard on people</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re done with this.</p>
<p>And at the same time, we were told the lies</p>
<p>coming out of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>that supposedly the communism was doing just fine.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re at the point where the free market concept</p>
<p>almost died and it&rsquo;s the Asian tigers</p>
<p>who kind of helped bring that idea back to life, right?</p>
<p>Their success having used the free markets.</p>
<p>And so for me, we gotta make a new commitment</p>
<p>to the free markets on this continent</p>
<p>if we wanna go anywhere, if we wanna go anywhere.</p>
<p>And the timing is perfect because the young people,</p>
<p>there is a kind of freedom</p>
<p>for the revolutionary free markets in this whole space.</p>
<p>Exactly, and you said something, oh, say that again,</p>
<p>because I wanna tell you what I&rsquo;m hearing in that,</p>
<p>because something&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>Say it again, come on, Lex.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which part, English is my second language too.</p>
<p>No, you said there&rsquo;s something revolutionary in that.</p>
<p>Because you know how young people are attached</p>
<p>to the revolution and how, I understand,</p>
<p>look Lex, I understand and I am willing</p>
<p>to give the benefits of a doubt</p>
<p>to some of these socialists who came to it</p>
<p>because they had to witness</p>
<p>some of the horrors of their times.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a revolutionary spirit behind that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately criticized by creating.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly, but violent revolution</p>
<p>is never the answer.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what they went for in 1789 in France,</p>
<p>the French Revolution, and Marx and Engels,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re promoting these ideas that usually,</p>
<p>for them, justifies violent revolution.</p>
<p>Then in all of these people,</p>
<p>I am with them when they say that they want</p>
<p>to see equal rights for people.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t agree with their,</p>
<p>therefore, we need to push for equal outcomes.</p>
<p>Equal rights is right, but equal outcomes is not right.</p>
<p>But I am with them for all the way to equal rights,</p>
<p>but this is where the two paths go this way.</p>
<p>And also, the fact that they have no issue</p>
<p>with violent revolution, people get killed.</p>
<p>People get put in gulags and people get, that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>So what you just said here, just give me goosebumps,</p>
<p>because there is revolution in the free markets,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the type of revolution we want.</p>
<p>The revolution that comes from people creating,</p>
<p>criticizing by creating, it&rsquo;s one of the best forms</p>
<p>of revolution.</p>
<p>If you ask me, that&rsquo;s the most sexy way of revolution.</p>
<p>Criticize by creating, but what,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go shoot people or be like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his name, Che Guevara, who tells you,</p>
<p>I love, it&rsquo;s in writing, I love nothing more</p>
<p>than to fry the brain of a man with his gun, really?</p>
<p>Well, in terms of sexy, there is power in that message</p>
<p>of the oppressor, the abuser, the enemy that has abused</p>
<p>their power, they need to be destroyed,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s power in the message of that violence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the lessons of history show</p>
<p>that the violence, one, doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>but it does the following.</p>
<p>There is something about human nature,</p>
<p>as the old cliche goes, that power corrupts</p>
<p>and absolute power corrupts absolutely,</p>
<p>is the people who are in charge of committing that violence</p>
<p>it does something to their head.</p>
<p>The first person you kill, the second person you kill,</p>
<p>for some reason, you lose your ability,</p>
<p>the compassion for other humans.</p>
<p>Even if you began as a revolutionary,</p>
<p>as the Soviets did, fighting for the worker,</p>
<p>for the rights and the basic humanity of the people</p>
<p>that really do the work, you lose the plot somehow</p>
<p>because of the violence.</p>
<p>So in that way, it seems like the lesson,</p>
<p>at least of this part of the human history,</p>
<p>until the robots take over, is that the economic freedom,</p>
<p>free markets, and protecting those,</p>
<p>and allowing anyone from your country to dream</p>
<p>and to make that dream a reality by creating it</p>
<p>with as few sort of roadblocks as possible.</p>
<p>Exactly, so that&rsquo;s why for me, the message is very clear,</p>
<p>is what we talked about today.</p>
<p>The reason why Africa is the poorest region in the world</p>
<p>is because it happens to be the most overregulated region</p>
<p>in the world, and for some people who might be put off by it</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like, oh, she&rsquo;s talking about laissez faire!</p>
<p>No, let me put it maybe in a way that you can understand.</p>
<p>Do you think that it should be as easy</p>
<p>for any person in Africa, for any entrepreneur in Africa</p>
<p>to enterprise than it is for any person in Scandinavia</p>
<p>to enterprise?</p>
<p>If your answer is yes, which I would hope it is,</p>
<p>then you have a moral obligation to work with me</p>
<p>to make my country, and as a whole, my continent,</p>
<p>more free markets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>At that point, there&rsquo;s no like, yes,</p>
<p>but on the other hand, uh uh, no.</p>
<p>And for me, on that question,</p>
<p>and I yet have to find somebody who claims to say no.</p>
<p>If you say no, then we have a whole nother problem</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not even talking to at that point anymore.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>So just to clarify, there&rsquo;s a perception in some reality</p>
<p>that the Scandinavian countries have elements of socialism</p>
<p>in their politics, in their society,</p>
<p>even in their economics.</p>
<p>So at the very least, Africa should have,</p>
<p>in terms of economic indices, should be as free</p>
<p>as the Scandinavian countries.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just giving that example.</p>
<p>As economically free, yes.</p>
<p>Because see, the Scandinavian, they do have</p>
<p>a subsidized, you know, like a welfare system,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what, a more socialized welfare system,</p>
<p>but the way they make their money</p>
<p>is very much the way of the free markets.</p>
<p>So there is how you make your money,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s how you maybe decide</p>
<p>as a country to redistribute it, right?</p>
<p>And so even there, even in Scandinavia,</p>
<p>again, yes, they have more economic freedom.</p>
<p>So then from there, Lex, where we go is my job</p>
<p>and my goal is for every single African, young and old,</p>
<p>to know what I have come to learn.</p>
<p>We are not doomed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not over for us.</p>
<p>We will never catch up.</p>
<p>The time for catch up is gone, but guess what?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a strong, strong possibility</p>
<p>and chance to leapfrog, and leapfrog we will.</p>
<p>It is still time, but for that to happen,</p>
<p>like I said, we need to know</p>
<p>what we just talked about today</p>
<p>because that is not what the mainstream</p>
<p>keeps us abreast with.</p>
<p>When you go to the World Bank,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t necessarily work along these lines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still, it&rsquo;s not, when you go to universities,</p>
<p>I will ask you, MIT, the MIT Econ Department,</p>
<p>or even some, most of the professors,</p>
<p>are they free market oriented?</p>
<p>We find that oftentimes in academia,</p>
<p>there is a strong anti capitalist bias.</p>
<p>There is a strong anti free market bias.</p>
<p>So this is a problem.</p>
<p>This is a problem.</p>
<p>Nobody cares about the economists anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we move forward.</p>
<p>In MIT, the spirit of the entrepreneur burns bright,</p>
<p>not in the economics department</p>
<p>because they just write op ed articles,</p>
<p>but in the dreamers, the young undergrads</p>
<p>that actually build something.</p>
<p>No, I get that.</p>
<p>But then we cannot be stifling their efforts</p>
<p>by putting these artificially made regulations and laws</p>
<p>that stand in the way and clip their wings.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why when you were saying,</p>
<p>what advice do you give to them?</p>
<p>The advice I give to them is each one of them,</p>
<p>they have to pay attention to this discourse we just had.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ask anybody to agree with me on face value.</p>
<p>Go back, do like I had to do.</p>
<p>I come very much from the left of the left,</p>
<p>if you can believe that.</p>
<p>But I had to have my own intellectual journey.</p>
<p>And in this case, my intellectual journey</p>
<p>was very much complimented by my own life.</p>
<p>Having to build these companies on two separate continents</p>
<p>and having to, I had front row seat of the differences.</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was this way just because we&rsquo;re poor</p>
<p>and therefore we must stop and therefore it&rsquo;s like this.</p>
<p>But eventually I learned that no,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re poor because we lack academic freedom.</p>
<p>And if a country allows its citizens</p>
<p>the academic freedom to enterprise, then they become rich.</p>
<p>So yeah, I had it upside down, you see.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s important for people to know that.</p>
<p>So number one, know your facts</p>
<p>because your facts will empower you.</p>
<p>In this case, I like to use that word,</p>
<p>facts will empower you and they will even furthermore,</p>
<p>they will power you, empower and power you.</p>
<p>Because empower is like inside</p>
<p>and power is like I push you forward and up.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what it does to know the facts.</p>
<p>And then go on and look around you.</p>
<p>Where are the best practices of this?</p>
<p>Who is at the cutting edge of a free markets?</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s done in a way there,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t necessarily be left behind</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in 2022 for Christ&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to do entrepreneurship</p>
<p>the same way maybe it was done 50 years ago,</p>
<p>100 years ago when as a community, as a people,</p>
<p>we were maybe less enlightened because of our times, right?</p>
<p>We can update this thing and move forward,</p>
<p>but update is definitely not build back,</p>
<p>what do they call it?</p>
<p>Build back new or whatever they&rsquo;re calling it at the WF,</p>
<p>whatever nonsense and stuff they&rsquo;re smoking over there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that.</p>
<p>There are some principles that are universal</p>
<p>and that stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Those we have to keep and on top add the new things</p>
<p>we learned from our times and from life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I want them to know.</p>
<p>Learn your facts, be empowered and powered,</p>
<p>and then look around, think about it</p>
<p>and look to see where the best practices are</p>
<p>around the world because the world is yours.</p>
<p>You might be African, but the world is yours.</p>
<p>So stop this nonsense of, oh, well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s done by white people, so we&rsquo;re not gonna do it.</p>
<p>Get the best that exists in humanity</p>
<p>for what you&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>And on top of that, put your own twist, right?</p>
<p>Bitcoin is all of ours to take.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is not the white man&rsquo;s thing,</p>
<p>so therefore, oh, come on, you know,</p>
<p>because we have a misguided pride,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna use Bitcoin because it&rsquo;s white man&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is math, you idiot.</p>
<p>Math is universal, so it belongs to all of us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no color.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>In the space of economics, in the space of ideas.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a chance to leapfrog too,</p>
<p>which is really, really powerful.</p>
<p>Exactly, because here we will leapfrog,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m not crazy, this is gonna happen.</p>
<p>You mark my words, but it&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>if as many people hear what we&rsquo;re talking about today,</p>
<p>because at some point, the solution is not gonna come.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not me, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna come from the wisdom of a crowd.</p>
<p>This is why I love the crowd.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no better wisdom than the crowd,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s also why I believe in the free markets.</p>
<p>This concept of emergent order, there&rsquo;s no way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no central planning that is smart enough,</p>
<p>that has the level of intel that street level people have,</p>
<p>trying to create something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, we just have to be humble.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just something at the bottom of a pyramid</p>
<p>that just bubbles up and happens.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the best.</p>
<p>I think the cynicism, the idea that people are dumb</p>
<p>is at the core of a lot of things</p>
<p>that prevent the flourishing of society.</p>
<p>You know, this kind of anecdotally,</p>
<p>people are like, ah, everyone is stupid,</p>
<p>and people say that jokingly.</p>
<p>But the reality is, people are incredible.</p>
<p>They have the capacity for kindness, for love,</p>
<p>for innovation, for brilliance, in all kinds of dimensions.</p>
<p>You might suck at math,</p>
<p>but you might be amazing at carpentry.</p>
<p>You have to find that thing,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something about,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a freedom to find that thing,</p>
<p>and people interact, they get excited about shit together,</p>
<p>and then they build.</p>
<p>If you look at authoritarian,</p>
<p>at places that limit that freedom,</p>
<p>at the core, I think, is the idea that people are dumb.</p>
<p>Let us take care of everything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come up with the rules and the regulations,</p>
<p>because people are too dumb to manage things themselves.</p>
<p>And then that idea builds on top of itself,</p>
<p>where you think that the entire populace</p>
<p>is much lesser than the wise sages sitting at the top.</p>
<p>Then you add violence on top of that,</p>
<p>and that leads to corruption,</p>
<p>to corrupting of just the human mind of the leaders,</p>
<p>and the whole thing becomes a giant mess.</p>
<p>The antidote to that is economic freedom.</p>
<p>For people to have a freedom to enterprise.</p>
<p>And look, Lex, when we allow for that to happen,</p>
<p>have you looked around lately</p>
<p>and looked at the level of niche</p>
<p>that has happened in this country?</p>
<p>I mean, you have clubs where, you have places</p>
<p>where people are into guitar strings,</p>
<p>you know, like some of the,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s all about guitar strings.</p>
<p>And others, it&rsquo;s all about these best cupcakes.</p>
<p>And others, it&rsquo;s all about this new crypto thing over here.</p>
<p>And others, like hair, best, you know, weight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, when you allow us, because seven billion geniuses,</p>
<p>each one of us, I believe,</p>
<p>came to this world with something,</p>
<p>something that only he or her possesses.</p>
<p>And that is the genius,</p>
<p>and it is their contribution to the human problem.</p>
<p>When you think about your identity today,</p>
<p>so it all started in Africa,</p>
<p>just like it did for the entirety of the human species.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of European flavor in there,</p>
<p>a little French, Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now, in part, a Texan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, you really are an American,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also an African.</p>
<p>Who are you, when you look in the mirror,</p>
<p>when you think about yourself,</p>
<p>when you listen, when everything gets quiet</p>
<p>and you listen to your heart, who are you?</p>
<p>Can you figure out that puzzle?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting question,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been a long time I haven&rsquo;t asked myself.</p>
<p>I have before.</p>
<p>What I have found is,</p>
<p>I think who I am today has been, for sure,</p>
<p>shaped by, I call it Dakar, Paris, San Francisco.</p>
<p>Dakar is Senegal, Paris, France,</p>
<p>and San Francisco, primarily.</p>
<p>And now, yeah, I think I might want to ask,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of Texan in there.</p>
<p>How do you say Texas in French?</p>
<p>Texas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>Austin.</p>
<p>Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>Not quite as good as San Francisco.</p>
<p>Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Us, Texas.</p>
<p>Us.</p>
<p>Texas, yeah.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>you, I was formed by those three.</p>
<p>I have to say that what I enjoy from my Senegalese roots</p>
<p>are our commitment to peace, love, and tolerance very much.</p>
<p>And Taranga, obviously.</p>
<p>And I like that it&rsquo;s a culture</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very much about reverence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re big on reverence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you could ever hear me tell an older person,</p>
<p>especially not my parents or my grandma or anybody like that,</p>
<p>for us to be able to tell an older person that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re lying would never cross my mind</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the most disrespectful thing</p>
<p>you can think of,</p>
<p>the most irreverent thing you can think of.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to agree</p>
<p>with everything that&rsquo;s said,</p>
<p>but there is a way to disagree.</p>
<p>There is a way to push back</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have to rob this person</p>
<p>who happens to be older than you,</p>
<p>especially from the dignity that older age normally provides.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s wisdom to their words</p>
<p>that you yourself may not see.</p>
<p>So the reverence is for the idea of wisdom, of tradition.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And again, so that is something that I really enjoy,</p>
<p>especially, and something I&rsquo;m very attached to,</p>
<p>to this day, and then from France,</p>
<p>what I really came to enjoy, of course,</p>
<p>is all the fineness that one can find</p>
<p>within French culture.</p>
<p>The fineness?</p>
<p>Yeah, the fineness.</p>
<p>Foods.</p>
<p>You mean like the intricacies, like the very&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, the soft sophistication in there.</p>
<p>I mean, French lingerie, for example.</p>
<p>I mean, la dentelle, the laces, all of that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super, it&rsquo;s exquisite.</p>
<p>So the&hellip;</p>
<p>The fashion, the food.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something to be said about all of that,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very beautiful.</p>
<p>And I love also, even when I talk about fineness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a meal is not about this big thing</p>
<p>they put in front of you,</p>
<p>but smaller portions, enjoy what you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>and spend time at a table.</p>
<p>Like the eating time is not necessarily</p>
<p>just this function of feeding yourself,</p>
<p>which I understand it,</p>
<p>but this is something that they share</p>
<p>with Senegalese culture,</p>
<p>is eating is a moment of communion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a moment of friendship, family.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a precious moment.</p>
<p>To this day, and my husband is American,</p>
<p>we eat our meals together all the time.</p>
<p>I would not have it any other way.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a prep time, all of that stuff.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how busy I am, but we&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Actually, to push back a little bit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting, because yeah,</p>
<p>the camaraderie over a meal is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I got, I mean, I was in a pretty dark place</p>
<p>because on the way to Ukraine,</p>
<p>I traveled to Paris, I stayed in Paris,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t able to enjoy the fineness</p>
<p>because it was almost a distraction</p>
<p>from the humanity for some reason to me,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s such a focus on the art of it all</p>
<p>that you lose the basic connection to humanity.</p>
<p>Now, that said.</p>
<p>Depends what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I think some of the lack of connection over humanity</p>
<p>was the fact that while I did know how to speak French</p>
<p>for a long time, I forgot most of the language.</p>
<p>And so part of it, there is a barrier.</p>
<p>You said hospitality.</p>
<p>There is a bit of a barrier in French culture</p>
<p>to where in order to be welcomed in,</p>
<p>you have to hear the music</p>
<p>and be able to play the music of the people.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a bit of a barrier.</p>
<p>I must admit on that end that it is true.</p>
<p>You would feel less that</p>
<p>if you were with a group of Senegalese people per se,</p>
<p>or I would even say if a group of Spanish people.</p>
<p>And I think this is maybe the other side</p>
<p>of it for the French people.</p>
<p>They can be a little bit uppity up there.</p>
<p>And I think maybe that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re sensing there.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the codes,</p>
<p>which is what you call if you don&rsquo;t sing the music,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s hard for you to be part of it.</p>
<p>But I was speaking here from the standpoint of your inn.</p>
<p>Yeah, from the inside.</p>
<p>Also, come on, coming from Texas and also Ukraine,</p>
<p>Ukraine, I should say some of the best steak and meat</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever had, cheap.</p>
<p>Texas, some of the greatest.</p>
<p>And the size of the meals in France,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, what are we doing here?</p>
<p>I mean, I get it&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to look at my art on the wall</p>
<p>and then eat my damn steak.</p>
<p>I just wanna cut the shit.</p>
<p>Did you go, so maybe, okay, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Okay, now here I have to defend them,</p>
<p>although sometimes I&rsquo;m the worst.</p>
<p>Now, did you go to some Michelin star restaurant?</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, because next time you go to France,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take you to the countryside or any French home.</p>
<p>They will serve you multiple times.</p>
<p>I mean, by the time you&rsquo;re done,</p>
<p>even if the portions are smaller,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re smaller if you want to,</p>
<p>but because that way you get a chance</p>
<p>to really feel what you&rsquo;re eating and then have more</p>
<p>and then all of that stuff, but not be like, ah, like this.</p>
<p>And then, but no, you&rsquo;ll eat plenty,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because you went to the Michelin places</p>
<p>where they were like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the warmth of the people is there.</p>
<p>It almost makes me sad that sometimes,</p>
<p>I think to properly be in a place,</p>
<p>you really should spend a long time there.</p>
<p>And also be emotionally ready.</p>
<p>Again, I was emotionally unavailable.</p>
<p>I was just like.</p>
<p>Well, I would imagine on the way to the Ukraine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, who can think about food?</p>
<p>But in your identity, a bit of Texas,</p>
<p>a bit of San Francisco, a bit of Africa.</p>
<p>Yeah, San Francisco.</p>
<p>And I guess from the America,</p>
<p>the defining thing for me for America is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the freedom and the entrepreneurial mindset.</p>
<p>See, very quickly when I moved from France</p>
<p>to the United States,</p>
<p>and I started becoming successful in the United States,</p>
<p>I found myself, me and my husband,</p>
<p>he was French and my first husband who passed away.</p>
<p>We found ourselves at some point,</p>
<p>we stopped talking to our friends in France</p>
<p>who stayed in France,</p>
<p>because we were talking to them about things</p>
<p>that were so outside of their comprehension.</p>
<p>What do you mean you&rsquo;re in your twenties</p>
<p>and you just raised, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a million dollars or $2 million,</p>
<p>especially from back in those days.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s easy here and there.</p>
<p>So even in France,</p>
<p>that entrepreneurial spirit didn&rsquo;t burn quite as bright.</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t take me wrong.</p>
<p>Do you have some entrepreneurial people in France?</p>
<p>Yeah, but to the level that you have it in the US,</p>
<p>absolutely not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I mean, in France, it&rsquo;s still very much,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re born in this area,</p>
<p>you go to school in that area,</p>
<p>your parents live around,</p>
<p>eventually you&rsquo;ll marry and be where your parents are</p>
<p>or maybe go to where your spouse&rsquo;s parents are</p>
<p>and you buy your house and you buy it once</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not gonna do like the Americans,</p>
<p>two years later, I sell my house, I go somewhere else.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have any of anything.</p>
<p>What do you mean, just stopping from nowhere,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do what?</p>
<p>Start a business and you have nothing to back you up</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>Oh, and even this idea of going and fundraising,</p>
<p>this venture cap, especially back in the days,</p>
<p>venture cap, all of that, it&rsquo;s very American.</p>
<p>We take it for granted, but it&rsquo;s very American.</p>
<p>Who would have made a bet on me in France?</p>
<p>The same person.</p>
<p>I would not have found the same people.</p>
<p>I would never in France have been able to raise,</p>
<p>at some point it was $32 million for my first business,</p>
<p>never would have been able to do that in France.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t mean that French people are bad people</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something that&rsquo;s just not so in the culture.</p>
<p>Just like this whole concept of philanthropy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that the French people don&rsquo;t do philanthropy,</p>
<p>but philanthropy in America is very different</p>
<p>from the level and also the magnitude</p>
<p>of maybe what the French people do.</p>
<p>And also they have this always like,</p>
<p>oh, let&rsquo;s do it behind the scene.</p>
<p>Money is suspicious, success is suspicious.</p>
<p>So at some point my husband and I just felt like</p>
<p>our friends actually were maybe thinking</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re maybe some drug dealers or something.</p>
<p>So we just stopped because it just was not flowing anymore.</p>
<p>And so yes, in America I found this entrepreneurial spirit,</p>
<p>but then I was able to link it with something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m very familiar with in my country.</p>
<p>See, back home in Senegal, I&rsquo;m part of this,</p>
<p>you have what we call the Mourid, I&rsquo;m a Mourid.</p>
<p>So what it is is one of the four brotherhoods in Senegal,</p>
<p>Mouridism is the most influential of them</p>
<p>and the biggest one.</p>
<p>And us, it&rsquo;s all about entrepreneurship as well.</p>
<p>I mean, of course there&rsquo;s the whole religious part,</p>
<p>but our mantra is,</p>
<p>pray as if you will die tomorrow</p>
<p>and work as if you will never die.</p>
<p>And the way we say,</p>
<p>the way somebody will say that somebody passed away,</p>
<p>we say, somebody has retired.</p>
<p>Somebody has retired from their work.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So, I think it&rsquo;s funny because in that community,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re very much entrepreneurial,</p>
<p>left to our own devices, we&rsquo;re entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>But then what happens is the minute that we die,</p>
<p>then what happens is the minute people start going to,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being educated through the education system,</p>
<p>you know, like the French, especially the system,</p>
<p>but tend to breed more like, you know,</p>
<p>the French bureaucrat mindset,</p>
<p>then you can see all the entrepreneurial mindset</p>
<p>kind of starting to dwindle down.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of very interesting.</p>
<p>So in a way, America helped me reunite</p>
<p>with that side of my roots,</p>
<p>where America tells me, reinforces that side of my roots</p>
<p>and also gives me more tools to practice</p>
<p>that side of my roots, if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>Through all of that, that&rsquo;s what brings out</p>
<p>the heart of a cheetah, which I think is a beautiful,</p>
<p>beautiful thing that encapsulates that whole trajectory,</p>
<p>which I think is the best possible answer</p>
<p>anyone could give.</p>
<p>It makes me want to really think about who I am,</p>
<p>because you really have brought together</p>
<p>so many cultures within yourself</p>
<p>that just talking to you makes you feel like</p>
<p>we are just all one people.</p>
<p>Because at the end we are, at the end we are.</p>
<p>And, you know, when you come from,</p>
<p>at the end we are, and also I think for me,</p>
<p>if people can take anything from my story,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at the end of the day, I am very clear about it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m all for harmony among people</p>
<p>and among us peoples.</p>
<p>If we can accept that we&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>I know this sounds so cliche, but for me it&rsquo;s so true,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all humans.</p>
<p>You know, when I left Senegal,</p>
<p>when I was about to leave Senegal for the first time</p>
<p>and to go to Europe to be reunited with my parents,</p>
<p>because now they had emigrated</p>
<p>and things were going to be fine.</p>
<p>And I was going to be, things were stable for them.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s time to be reunited with her.</p>
<p>They brought me over, but before I left Senegal,</p>
<p>my grandma sat me down.</p>
<p>She actually, she lowered herself down to my level</p>
<p>and she said, my god, you&rsquo;re about to go to this place</p>
<p>where most people will not look like you.</p>
<p>And most people speak a language</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be different from yours.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to realize that all the kids</p>
<p>are going to school and you&rsquo;ve never been to school</p>
<p>because, you know, I was, like I said, a free range kid</p>
<p>and I was just living my life.</p>
<p>And she said, but I don&rsquo;t want for any of that,</p>
<p>and she showed her words, she said,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want for any of that to intimidate you.</p>
<p>She said, you can be impressed by some of it if you want,</p>
<p>but no intimidation.</p>
<p>And she said, because the fact</p>
<p>that they might be different from you,</p>
<p>yeah, they&rsquo;re going to have a different skin color from you,</p>
<p>but it is still human skin.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re human, they&rsquo;re human.</p>
<p>And she said, this language you&rsquo;re going to speak,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different language from yours,</p>
<p>but it is still a language that humans speak.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re human, they&rsquo;re human.</p>
<p>Therefore, you&rsquo;re going to speak it.</p>
<p>And lastly, they have gone to school.</p>
<p>Going to school is what little humans do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a little human, so you&rsquo;ll be just fine.</p>
<p>And I went and grandma was right.</p>
<p>Right, she was right.</p>
<p>And that helped me.</p>
<p>And I think when you internalize that so early on,</p>
<p>it just makes you belong to the human family</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re part of.</p>
<p>I am part of a human family.</p>
<p>And I would have no problem going to Russia, for example,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take, and be totally open.</p>
<p>Maybe don&rsquo;t go right now, but.</p>
<p>No, not now.</p>
<p>Maybe not now, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But what I just.</p>
<p>Or at least don&rsquo;t bring weed if you go on the plane.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, right.</p>
<p>That girl, I don&rsquo;t know what she was thinking, but.</p>
<p>No, so, but what I&rsquo;m trying to say, Lex,</p>
<p>is I feel like I can go anywhere in the world,</p>
<p>including some of the most unfriendly places in the world</p>
<p>to someone like me, because there are places like that.</p>
<p>And yet I know, I know that somehow, somewhere,</p>
<p>someone will take care of me.</p>
<p>Someone will help me.</p>
<p>When I first came to this country,</p>
<p>I came as a tourist, but you had this amazing family</p>
<p>who had a business, a family business in Indiana,</p>
<p>Columbus, Indiana, the Wences, Carolyn Eldon Wence,</p>
<p>I owe them everything that I have in this country,</p>
<p>that I am in this country.</p>
<p>They are Americans in the mid America</p>
<p>from a place that most other Americans</p>
<p>would maybe look down on because,</p>
<p>and some people would be like, oh, you&rsquo;re going to this place</p>
<p>where they have more churches and cows than people,</p>
<p>that type of behavior, because the elite coastal elites,</p>
<p>but it is in Midwest, in the Midwest that I found,</p>
<p>that I, black young women coming out of nowhere,</p>
<p>found support.</p>
<p>They all rallied around me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even come from the same faith as they are from,</p>
<p>yet their whole church rallied around me</p>
<p>to find me an apartment.</p>
<p>My host family found me, got me a job,</p>
<p>and it was not a pity job.</p>
<p>They were like, we need, we are in serious needs</p>
<p>of getting our accounting under control</p>
<p>and our marketing and all of that.</p>
<p>And I had to catch up years of accounting like to the cent</p>
<p>and come up with marketing, all of that.</p>
<p>And I did it way faster than they thought</p>
<p>I would ever be able to do that.</p>
<p>At some point they look at me and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>look, there is a future for you.</p>
<p>And we are too small for that future.</p>
<p>And now we could be selfish and keep you here with us.</p>
<p>And we would want nothing more than that</p>
<p>because really they&rsquo;re like my parents to this day.</p>
<p>I just came back from seeing them.</p>
<p>And they said, but there&rsquo;s so much more for you</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>So we want you to go and find out what it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s eventually when I,</p>
<p>because something was brewing up in San Francisco</p>
<p>when I say I left my heart in San Francisco</p>
<p>because the man who would become my husband,</p>
<p>we went to the same business school in France,</p>
<p>but then he was older than me.</p>
<p>So he had come to San Francisco and started a business there.</p>
<p>And it just looked like there was something there.</p>
<p>And Scarola was like, you gotta go to San Francisco</p>
<p>and find out with Emmanuel what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So I went and I left my heart in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I came back and I&rsquo;m like, okay, I&rsquo;m leaving.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the keys to my apartment.</p>
<p>What, I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m out of here.</p>
<p>So no, but Carol, so this is it.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m saying, especially in these times</p>
<p>when this country loves to dwell on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bad because you have this skin color.</p>
<p>Here are people with a completely different skin color</p>
<p>than mine, completely different faith than mine,</p>
<p>yet embraced me, protected me, paid for my visa,</p>
<p>you know, for my lawyer, for my H1B, everything,</p>
<p>and also played emotional support for me.</p>
<p>And no one, no one asked them to do that.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>and this has been the story of my life,</p>
<p>everywhere I go, regardless of the hostility around me,</p>
<p>you betcha that there&rsquo;s always,</p>
<p>always gonna be somebody who shows up for you.</p>
<p>And somebody who&rsquo;s at the extremes,</p>
<p>at the antipodes of where you are and who you are.</p>
<p>And that tells me something.</p>
<p>In the end, we are good people.</p>
<p>Most people are good people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much power to that,</p>
<p>the internalizing of this idea that we&rsquo;re all just human</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s human kindness all around us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it a lot where people internalize that</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re able to walk lightly amidst hate</p>
<p>and walk past it and it doesn&rsquo;t stick to them</p>
<p>in a way that they build resentment and it paralyzes them.</p>
<p>If they internalize the world as human,</p>
<p>they can be in the, just like you said,</p>
<p>in the worst places in the world for them.</p>
<p>And someone, somewhere that human magic and touch is there.</p>
<p>Yeah, it will find them.</p>
<p>It will find, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, the other thing too, Lex is,</p>
<p>especially in these times we&rsquo;re walking in,</p>
<p>it is to remind yourself,</p>
<p>I think this is where we all are called</p>
<p>to practice more courage.</p>
<p>I call it courage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the courage to show up with curiosity,</p>
<p>with empathy and with love.</p>
<p>To me, those three are the antidote to pretty much anything.</p>
<p>Curiosity and love.</p>
<p>In the face of fear, can you show up with curiosity?</p>
<p>In the face of hate, can you say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna engage with love?</p>
<p>Even if I&rsquo;m scared to death</p>
<p>and even if I&rsquo;m pissed off to death by this,</p>
<p>but can you do that?</p>
<p>In the face of just like, you know, judgment or whatever,</p>
<p>can you show up with empathy?</p>
<p>And I had just found that when you try to do that,</p>
<p>you engage very different parts of your brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s proven by the way, by the brain scientists,</p>
<p>but you also can feel it in your body</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re engaging very different parts of your soul.</p>
<p>And so I try myself, I&rsquo;m not always good at it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a practice that I try to honor,</p>
<p>which is curiosity, empathy and love.</p>
<p>As I told you offline,</p>
<p>those, I agree with you 100% on that,</p>
<p>but there is, you know, when you go to Ukraine</p>
<p>and you can say, you can speak about the power of love,</p>
<p>but when you lose your family, when you lose your home,</p>
<p>all you have in your heart is hate.</p>
<p>Even if you know it, you&rsquo;re not supposed to have it.</p>
<p>You still, all you have is hate.</p>
<p>So sometimes it&rsquo;s a very human thing</p>
<p>to have resentment, to have hate.</p>
<p>But it is about trying not to stay there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s okay if it takes you years,</p>
<p>but it is about trying, and I mean the word trying,</p>
<p>it is about trying not to stay there.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about some of the things</p>
<p>you see in this country from your perspective</p>
<p>of everywhere you&rsquo;ve been in the world.</p>
<p>What do you think about the Black Lives Matter movement</p>
<p>here in America that does struggle</p>
<p>with the role of skin color today</p>
<p>and throughout the history of this country,</p>
<p>maybe even throughout the history of the world?</p>
<p>Well, Black Lives Matter has been a very hard one for me,</p>
<p>because do Black Lives Matter,</p>
<p>those three words together in that order,</p>
<p>what they mean, they mean everything,</p>
<p>because Black Lives do matter,</p>
<p>as any other lives do matter.</p>
<p>But I know in this case why they say Black Lives Matter,</p>
<p>because some of the context we have had.</p>
<p>Now, while I agree with the principles</p>
<p>that Black Lives Matter,</p>
<p>I have a big problem with the organization.</p>
<p>With the organization and what it stands for.</p>
<p>When I have an organization that pretends</p>
<p>to want to stand for Black lives to matter,</p>
<p>yet you are self proclaimed Marxist socialists,</p>
<p>I pause.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I pause and then I&rsquo;m like, have we learned nothing?</p>
<p>Have we learned nothing?</p>
<p>And the reason why I say that, Lex,</p>
<p>is because 60 some years ago,</p>
<p>it started before even 60 some years ago,</p>
<p>Black people, in this case,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the African people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the Black Africans</p>
<p>who would go on to really cement</p>
<p>this concept of African emancipation</p>
<p>and African liberation.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m taking us back to 1945.</p>
<p>They had four of them before that.</p>
<p>But in 1945, in Manchester, UK,</p>
<p>happened something that would become major</p>
<p>for Africa and its future,</p>
<p>especially subterranean Africa.</p>
<p>In Manchester, UK,</p>
<p>people like Blaise Diagne of my country,</p>
<p>Nyerere, Tanzania, Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana,</p>
<p>and others and others from different parts of the continent</p>
<p>got together with Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. Dubois.</p>
<p>And I say Dubois because that&rsquo;s how we say it in French.</p>
<p>He has a French name, French sounding name at least.</p>
<p>And Americans would say, so for Americans listening,</p>
<p>I know you say Duboy, but it&rsquo;s Dubois.</p>
<p>No, because just in case they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>who is he talking about?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>So all of those people got together in the UK</p>
<p>and with W.E.B. Dubois and Marcus Garvey,</p>
<p>big top African American intellectuals of their times.</p>
<p>W.E.B. Dubois had so many things happen to him,</p>
<p>starting from the North,</p>
<p>being more or more or less a liberal type guy.</p>
<p>You know, came to the South just to see at this time,</p>
<p>you know, people, black people being lynched</p>
<p>and some of the body parts been shown in store windows.</p>
<p>I mean, just for a second, we put ourselves in his shoes.</p>
<p>I put myself in his shoes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when he started to become radicalized, right?</p>
<p>Because at first it was like, oh, reforms,</p>
<p>and I was like, God darn it.</p>
<p>And I mean, these people, we don&rsquo;t talk to them.</p>
<p>We force, you know.</p>
<p>And eventually, little by little, things going through.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have these people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very much on the Marxist socialist train.</p>
<p>So do you think the sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the political movements that are just using?</p>
<p>Yeah, because what happened back in those days, it is true.</p>
<p>But to their credit, communist socialists</p>
<p>were fighting for equal rights.</p>
<p>They were fighting for equal rights.</p>
<p>They were fighting for the rights of black people</p>
<p>to have equal rights.</p>
<p>So of course, I could see why one could say,</p>
<p>especially in this times, you&rsquo;ve been lynched,</p>
<p>bodies burnt, body parts showcased at window stores.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Africa, under colonization,</p>
<p>in your own country, in your own land.</p>
<p>And you have this group that&rsquo;s saying,</p>
<p>your fight is part of what we fight.</p>
<p>And you have this group that&rsquo;s saying,</p>
<p>your fight is part of what we fight.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re gonna say I side with you,</p>
<p>especially if this is all happening at a time</p>
<p>where, you know, so 1945, these guys who would be</p>
<p>the liberators of various African nations,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re meeting with Garvey, with W. E. B. Du Bois.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where this meeting is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fifth Pan African Congress meeting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be the last one, but it&rsquo;s the most important one</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when they formed their plans</p>
<p>and really rallied around this concept</p>
<p>of African emancipation and African liberation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna liberate our countries.</p>
<p>Then later, so that&rsquo;s how all of these movements</p>
<p>started to happen.</p>
<p>And from there, Gandhi was already making some progress</p>
<p>with India, you know, getting them out of British rule</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>So all of this was happening and it really like,</p>
<p>this whole thing was bubbling, bubbling, bubbling,</p>
<p>you know, like there&rsquo;s like a new force going on.</p>
<p>And then we arrive in the late fifties</p>
<p>and, you know, Kuma with, you know,</p>
<p>them with the British as well,</p>
<p>they might manage to become their colonization is over.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the first one to go in, 57.</p>
<p>Then from there, it&rsquo;s what we call the independences.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what most of Sub Saharan African nation</p>
<p>are getting their independence is different dates.</p>
<p>Mine, April 4th, 1960.</p>
<p>So all over, so this is happening.</p>
<p>And now think about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking 57, you&rsquo;re talking 60.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like at this time now with the middle of a Cold War.</p>
<p>Because we have to put things in context</p>
<p>if we wanna understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Because people today ask me, why do you think,</p>
<p>because even now when they understand,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re right, it makes sense.</p>
<p>If you have no economic freedom, you&rsquo;re gonna be poor.</p>
<p>But why, why, why did they go for this?</p>
<p>Why did they go for this?</p>
<p>And then they don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>So beginning of day of times, pre colonial Africans</p>
<p>were free marketeers, free enterprise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty well recorded by someone like George Aite.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I got the cheat I think from</p>
<p>and Ghanaian economist.</p>
<p>And then slavery happened, colonialism happened.</p>
<p>And then the independences, late fifties, early sixties</p>
<p>for most sub Saharan African countries.</p>
<p>So there what you have is,</p>
<p>but then what happened there?</p>
<p>So I told you in 45, fifth Pan African Congress in the UK</p>
<p>with the liberators of Africa under the leadership</p>
<p>because he was the wise, you know, eldest man.</p>
<p>Dubois was, he was in his seventies back in the day.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s older than them, you know,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s coming with all of his ideas and everything.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re like, ooh.</p>
<p>So there they are.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re in the late fifties, early sixties.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting to make progress with the independences.</p>
<p>You know, India has gone there before.</p>
<p>So all of that is starting to happen.</p>
<p>And at that time, remember,</p>
<p>they already were being introduced</p>
<p>to the concept of socialism, Marxism,</p>
<p>all of that way before by some of these, you know,</p>
<p>black African American intellectuals of their time</p>
<p>who were very socialist Marxist by that time.</p>
<p>So now they&rsquo;re becoming independent</p>
<p>because I do independent like this</p>
<p>because I reckon that there&rsquo;s still neocolonism going on.</p>
<p>So now this is happening, they&rsquo;re becoming free.</p>
<p>But then you look around, what do you see?</p>
<p>That now most of these liberators of their nations</p>
<p>become the president of the nations.</p>
<p>But remember what I told you?</p>
<p>Most of them have dranken the Marxist socialism Koolaid.</p>
<p>So as these African nations become independent</p>
<p>with their first independent governments</p>
<p>and, you know, presidents, most of them,</p>
<p>most of them are socialist,</p>
<p>various forms of statist type of government.</p>
<p>And this is because at that point,</p>
<p>we had made a fatal mistake of going,</p>
<p>of saying we are Marxist socialist</p>
<p>because you guys fight for equal rights.</p>
<p>So in this case, there should be no colonialism</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>So not only you have that going on and the people,</p>
<p>so right now you had this battle of ideology going on</p>
<p>because on one end represented by freedom</p>
<p>and the economic, what do you call it?</p>
<p>The economic system they were using is capitalism.</p>
<p>And these are represented by the Western nations</p>
<p>facing off with Eastern block,</p>
<p>practicing various forms of statism,</p>
<p>socialism, communism, various forms of statism.</p>
<p>And these two are fighting for influence.</p>
<p>So, and we also have, it&rsquo;s also not, so two things there.</p>
<p>One is we&rsquo;re at a time where,</p>
<p>remember the free market concept was almost dead,</p>
<p>almost dead.</p>
<p>So almost every intellectual at that time</p>
<p>was social Marxist or Marxist socialist,</p>
<p>I put the name, that&rsquo;s what you were.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in a world where it was a normal thing,</p>
<p>it was just mainstream acceptance.</p>
<p>So not only you have that force,</p>
<p>but at the same time,</p>
<p>if these two forces are fighting one another,</p>
<p>it turns out that the one representing capitalism</p>
<p>and freedom, well, sorry,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t it you who enslaved us and colonized us?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re fighting with the people who represent,</p>
<p>supposedly people who are saying that</p>
<p>who had been fighting for equal rights for us,</p>
<p>with us for the longest time, these are our friends.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we made a fatal mistake</p>
<p>because while yes, there were maybe good things</p>
<p>to agree on with Marxist socialist of the times,</p>
<p>especially equal rights for all people and all of that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only thing we should have,</p>
<p>among the only things we should have agreed upon.</p>
<p>There are violent revolution tendencies, no way.</p>
<p>When it comes to the economic nonsense, no way.</p>
<p>We should not have thrown the baby out with the bathwater,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what we did.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we made a fatal mistake.</p>
<p>So then we became free, all of these nations,</p>
<p>and most of them started with socialist or communist leaders.</p>
<p>My country, socialist, L√©opold S√©dar Senghor,</p>
<p>he was a socialist.</p>
<p>And they stayed in power for 40 years,</p>
<p>the first 40 years of our freedom years.</p>
<p>And all over the continent, more or less,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you had.</p>
<p>And on top of that,</p>
<p>something else that the French don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the people don&rsquo;t know is France with its colonies said,</p>
<p>you cannot, not do,</p>
<p>you have to keep the French civil law.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about the Napoleonic civil code.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>So the reason why I go back to BLM is while I have</p>
<p>all the respect in the world</p>
<p>and all the compassion in the world</p>
<p>for people like Krummer, for people like Nyerere,</p>
<p>for people, all of us people of those times,</p>
<p>the liberators of Africa,</p>
<p>while I have so much love, compassion for them,</p>
<p>I am also able to say,</p>
<p>because I got the benefit of 60 some years time,</p>
<p>and where you get to do a debrief</p>
<p>and see what worked, what didn&rsquo;t work, what happened.</p>
<p>We have had the 60 years to look back and to reflect.</p>
<p>So yes, I can understand why they did what they did.</p>
<p>I can understand why they sided with these people</p>
<p>who on the surface, or at least some part of a fight</p>
<p>was the same fight as them when it came to equal rights.</p>
<p>I can excuse them,</p>
<p>but I will not excuse the BLM founders</p>
<p>because that mistake was tolerable 60 some years ago.</p>
<p>Today, no.</p>
<p>The blacks of today cannot be serious</p>
<p>about black lives mattering and saying in the same sentence,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to be socialist Marx, Marxist socialist.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So the BLM movement is too deeply integrated</p>
<p>with the ideas of Marxism.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re anti free market, anti capitalist.</p>
<p>And we do know that you have to have the free markets</p>
<p>in order to build prosperity.</p>
<p>And prosperity means economic power.</p>
<p>If you have economic power, no one messes with you,</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re gonna do it, they&rsquo;re gonna have to think twice.</p>
<p>And when they do, they&rsquo;re gonna have to pay consequences.</p>
<p>So if you want for blacks to be respected</p>
<p>anywhere in the world,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to be serious about black prosperity,</p>
<p>all mass, not just a few people,</p>
<p>Oprah over here and somebody over there, no.</p>
<p>We as a group have to be critical mass of prosperity</p>
<p>across the board.</p>
<p>And because we&rsquo;re talking critical mass of prosperity</p>
<p>across the board,</p>
<p>it means black people everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>We in Africa happen to represent 90% of our representatives</p>
<p>of a black race.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna be serious about black lives mattering</p>
<p>without being serious for Africa,</p>
<p>the 1 billion people in Africa that are black</p>
<p>and for them to have access to the free markets</p>
<p>and yes, fossil fuels,</p>
<p>so that they can rocket up prosperity wise.</p>
<p>And the resources of the young people, the young minds.</p>
<p>So that all of these young people, young minds</p>
<p>can finally manifest their greatness that I know they have</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re showing us every day</p>
<p>despite the obstacles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we need.</p>
<p>Senegal becomes rich and Senegal can become</p>
<p>and will be richer than France.</p>
<p>Singapore did it, we can do it.</p>
<p>Mali rich, Nigeria rich, functioning as well.</p>
<p>Malawi rich, Tanzania rich, Uganda rich,</p>
<p>Zimbabwe rich, Niger rich, everywhere rich prosperous</p>
<p>as prosperous, if not more prosperous than Switzerland</p>
<p>or Singapore or the U.S.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, or the Lichtenstein or Luxembourg,</p>
<p>places that have no natural resources.</p>
<p>We become rich and you watch the world</p>
<p>having a very different relationship with us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only time we will commend any type of respect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when people, even our common psyche will change</p>
<p>even about black people.</p>
<p>All of the stereotypes that they have of us</p>
<p>is gonna melt away.</p>
<p>And you may still not like us, but you will still respect us</p>
<p>because we are a force to be dealt with.</p>
<p>And only economic power does that.</p>
<p>It would be nice, of course, for us to respect people</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re people.</p>
<p>It would be nice, but let us not kid ourselves.</p>
<p>This is earth.</p>
<p>And someone said, nice people will make it to heaven,</p>
<p>but not to Harvard necessarily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that pity does not ever turn into respect.</p>
<p>It would be nice if it did.</p>
<p>It would be nice, but it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Prosperity is the only thing.</p>
<p>And the way we do that, there is no,</p>
<p>just like all of us humans have to inhale oxygen</p>
<p>and exhale carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a human way of breathing.</p>
<p>You bring me on, but you wanna be foolish</p>
<p>and be like, oh, well, sorry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how white people breathe.</p>
<p>So as black people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to do something different.</p>
<p>Well, good luck with that.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So this is here why I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>I have no patience for Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making a mistake that was made 60 some plus 60.</p>
<p>Years ago, even more than that.</p>
<p>Maybe even a hundred, you know,</p>
<p>when we were siding with the Marxist socialists</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the ones who&rsquo;ve been fighting</p>
<p>for equal rights.</p>
<p>Let me ask you though, about racism.</p>
<p>Do you, as you travel through this world,</p>
<p>as you travel through America,</p>
<p>feel the burn of hatred?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken about the revolutions</p>
<p>that have been fought throughout the 20th century</p>
<p>against racism.</p>
<p>But today, as people talk about educating,</p>
<p>reminding the world with the,</p>
<p>even with more philosophical ideas</p>
<p>of critical race theory, for example,</p>
<p>do you think this is still a battle</p>
<p>that needs to be fought</p>
<p>at the forefront of culture in the United States?</p>
<p>Um, does racism exist?</p>
<p>Yes, it does.</p>
<p>But all forms of isms exist.</p>
<p>Some people, it&rsquo;s about various forms of ableism.</p>
<p>Others, it&rsquo;s about size.</p>
<p>And racism, yes, is one of them.</p>
<p>Does it exist?</p>
<p>Yes, it does.</p>
<p>But is it what&rsquo;s gonna stop anyone</p>
<p>from manifesting their greatest potential?</p>
<p>I say no.</p>
<p>Many people in this country have showed it.</p>
<p>Whether they&rsquo;re African Americans</p>
<p>or African immigrant, I&rsquo;m an African immigrant.</p>
<p>You have African Americans like Oprah and others,</p>
<p>and other people even before her,</p>
<p>who despite the nastiness around them,</p>
<p>were able to make it.</p>
<p>So we do know, especially as black people,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I love about the human spirit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s resiliency.</p>
<p>But resiliency only can happen</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t allow yourself to be beaten down</p>
<p>and to lose yourself of agency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, of course, easier said than done.</p>
<p>And some among us need a little bit more help</p>
<p>to not succumb for it than others do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>It might be harder for you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somewhere in inner city,</p>
<p>inner city black America.</p>
<p>Maybe the environment might be a little bit tougher</p>
<p>for you to try and get your act together</p>
<p>and all of that stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But even in that situation,</p>
<p>we need to, I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>that we still do not rob you of your agency.</p>
<p>And this is where I am mad as heck</p>
<p>against those who supposedly care</p>
<p>and their idea of how to make sure</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t become or stay a victim of racism</p>
<p>is through all the things we talked about,</p>
<p>the CRT, the anti racism crap of, you know,</p>
<p>Ibrahim X. Kendi and what&rsquo;s her name, Robin DiAngelo.</p>
<p>I mean her, I&rsquo;m shocked.</p>
<p>The woman is making all of this money</p>
<p>supposedly fighting a war on our behalf.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, lady, I hear you loud and clear</p>
<p>that you are a true racist.</p>
<p>I know, but you told me you are.</p>
<p>And for you to think that your anti racism</p>
<p>makes you less racist and it&rsquo;s, that happens too.</p>
<p>She comes from a racist background.</p>
<p>Fine, she&rsquo;s saying it, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But this idea that every walking person on earth</p>
<p>belongs to one category or the other,</p>
<p>depending on what, you know, which skin color you came with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s problematic at its root.</p>
<p>So my point is, does racism exist?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s gonna stop me</p>
<p>from doing anything I have to do?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Might it make it harder, longer?</p>
<p>Maybe, but it will not stop me from doing anything.</p>
<p>But it will not stop me.</p>
<p>But for it not to stop me,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t engage in victimhood mentality.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t lose myself as self.</p>
<p>I got to use all the agency that I have</p>
<p>to fight back and fight beyond.</p>
<p>See, it&rsquo;s just a bit of fight back.</p>
<p>You fight back and you fight beyond.</p>
<p>Cause at some point, yeah and.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this concept of yes and.</p>
<p>So this is why I have loved the job.</p>
<p>So when I have somebody who is like,</p>
<p>oh, anti racism is a way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna go and tell all the white kids</p>
<p>that, you know, because they will happen to be white,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re really the oppressors and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And the black kids, because they&rsquo;re black, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not changing anything when you&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>Nothing except that you&rsquo;re causing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting problems</p>
<p>where there were no problems to start with.</p>
<p>All we had to do was maybe</p>
<p>go for a different route from there.</p>
<p>Kids are kids.</p>
<p>Kids are born kids.</p>
<p>And this, I&rsquo;m not sure if you want to get me going</p>
<p>onto the whole science of bias,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s something I spent years of my life on.</p>
<p>And my journey on the science of bias</p>
<p>started with the days of Philando Castile,</p>
<p>Eric Garner, that whole summer of 2016,</p>
<p>when we had this horrendous, horrendous situation</p>
<p>of black people being killed by the police,</p>
<p>where they shot before asking,</p>
<p>and people left to die in the most inhumane way</p>
<p>for the rest of us to watch from the social media.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when my George Floyd moment happened.</p>
<p>Not later than four years ago,</p>
<p>and the whole world is like, you know.</p>
<p>So that sent me on a journey</p>
<p>of understanding what discrimination is and bias is.</p>
<p>And in a way, that&rsquo;s the reason why I started this company</p>
<p>that I even called Skinny Skin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it came from.</p>
<p>Again, criticized by creating.</p>
<p>I needed to understand what discrimination was.</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>Is it true what Kendi is saying?</p>
<p>Is it true what DAngelo is saying?</p>
<p>Is it true that it could be that your race</p>
<p>is just because of the skin color you happen to be born in?</p>
<p>Is it true?</p>
<p>I needed to know, because I was at a time of my life</p>
<p>where at some point, you know,</p>
<p>when those killings were happening,</p>
<p>it was so hard for me being a black person in this country.</p>
<p>And wondering,</p>
<p>I mean, what is this?</p>
<p>And what do we do with this?</p>
<p>Yeah, is it true?</p>
<p>How much discrimination am I operating under in the system?</p>
<p>All of that.</p>
<p>You need to understand the full characteristics of,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re dreaming of making a big change</p>
<p>by building companies, you have to kind of intuit,</p>
<p>how much, what am I up against?</p>
<p>What am I up against, right?</p>
<p>And so this is why, you know,</p>
<p>spend all of this time on some of the work.</p>
<p>And then eventually I understood that discrimination,</p>
<p>if you wanted to understand it beyond,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, beyond the big lines of,</p>
<p>especially the clickbait lines</p>
<p>would make it very black and white.</p>
<p>Then I had to really take a moment and I spent time,</p>
<p>you know, with a world of brain scientists,</p>
<p>with behavioral psychologists,</p>
<p>with evolutionary biologists.</p>
<p>We have all of this ecosystem, but together form</p>
<p>what one might call the science of bias.</p>
<p>And especially I came across the work</p>
<p>of this team of scientists at the University of,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Wisconsin,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the only ones who made sense</p>
<p>in this sea of nonsense back then.</p>
<p>And this article was in Politico,</p>
<p>and it was saying something that I could relate to it.</p>
<p>And eventually what I learned was,</p>
<p>and this part comes from the evolutionary biologist people,</p>
<p>they in a way tell you that right around age three,</p>
<p>can happen sooner or later,</p>
<p>because you know, we&rsquo;re all different,</p>
<p>but you go from this person who has to rely</p>
<p>on these other people, usually your parents, to stay alive,</p>
<p>to be fed, to be housed, to be in your diaper change,</p>
<p>all of that stuff, right?</p>
<p>To now, something is kicking in.</p>
<p>Where you have to, in order for you to survive,</p>
<p>and this is all wired in,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t even understand it consciously,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m saying it now,</p>
<p>where in order for you to survive,</p>
<p>in order for you to go from this state of dependency</p>
<p>to the next stage and more and more and more,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to develop this ability</p>
<p>to make sense of the world.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s making sense of a world</p>
<p>at its most basic level means is,</p>
<p>can you determine if a situation</p>
<p>or a person is good or bad for you?</p>
<p>Failure, and you need to be able to do so ever so quickly,</p>
<p>because failure to be able to do that</p>
<p>means that you might not be alive the next second.</p>
<p>See, it&rsquo;s so wired in.</p>
<p>So this process is starting to kick in.</p>
<p>And at that point,</p>
<p>your brain is gonna be your best ally for that.</p>
<p>And what the brain is gonna do is it&rsquo;s gonna help you,</p>
<p>and the way the brain works is through,</p>
<p>it works with, it&rsquo;s all wired for efficiency.</p>
<p>And the way it goes for efficiency is through automation,</p>
<p>meaning that every time it has computed,</p>
<p>and you probably know these things way better than me,</p>
<p>every time it has computed one algorithm,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t want to do it again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like this, okay, got it, stored, stored, right?</p>
<p>And then it adds maybe some little levels of complexity to it,</p>
<p>but it has to be something new,</p>
<p>meaning the new level of complexity</p>
<p>for it to even be willing to reconsider.</p>
<p>Otherwise you have, so then all of a sudden</p>
<p>what you have is these neurons in the back of your head,</p>
<p>and they have created pathways, right?</p>
<p>So, and every time neurons have created pathway</p>
<p>among themselves, because basically they&rsquo;re attached,</p>
<p>and here is the pathway,</p>
<p>well, this pathway in the world of,</p>
<p>in the world of science of bias, it&rsquo;s a habit.</p>
<p>In general, it&rsquo;s a habit when they form two pathways,</p>
<p>when they form a pathway, it&rsquo;s a habit.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re willing to talk about unconscious bias,</p>
<p>because of course it&rsquo;s very different</p>
<p>from somebody who tells me to my face,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no world in which you or I could ever be equal,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re black and I&rsquo;m white,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a woman, I&rsquo;m a man, this, this and that,</p>
<p>that people like that, again, 1% of psychopaths in our world,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re out there, unfortunately,</p>
<p>by the time they do nasty things, it&rsquo;s pretty horrible,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what all we hear about,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m talking mostly about the rest of us.</p>
<p>Remember when I told you that most of us are good people,</p>
<p>bumbling along, making it up as we&rsquo;re going,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I have compassion for human nature.</p>
<p>So, but really, in the morning when I wake up,</p>
<p>do you really think that I&rsquo;m waking up and thinking,</p>
<p>how am I gonna go kill?</p>
<p>How am I gonna kill?</p>
<p>And I wake up and thinking, how am I gonna go kill?</p>
<p>How am I gonna go kill Lex?</p>
<p>That Lex guy needs to go down, he&rsquo;s a man, he&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take me wrong, I&rsquo;m sure there are some women</p>
<p>who feel like that, but I&rsquo;m not one of them,</p>
<p>and I do think a majority of us are not, whatever.</p>
<p>But you know, in the morning I&rsquo;m waking up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, gee, can I get my tea?</p>
<p>Oh, my dog is not looking okay today.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve got, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot going on, and so you&rsquo;re using these kind of,</p>
<p>just like you said, brilliantly,</p>
<p>it has a bunch of simplifications that&rsquo;s built up,</p>
<p>and it uses those simplifications to get through the day.</p>
<p>To get through the day, exactly.</p>
<p>So then here you are, needing to make sense of a world,</p>
<p>and then the brain is your best ally in that.</p>
<p>The way it&rsquo;s gonna do it is through efficiency,</p>
<p>efficiency done through automation.</p>
<p>So every time it thinks it&rsquo;s figured something out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never gonna think about it again,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s how you build all of these habits</p>
<p>of unconscious bias, because everything,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s somewhere along the line,</p>
<p>you come up with the information</p>
<p>that black man walking around with a hoodie equals danger.</p>
<p>So later, what do you see?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s Lex or my gut, I&rsquo;m walking in the dark alley,</p>
<p>I see a black man with a hoodie,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m gonna run away</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been given that information.</p>
<p>So the best way to think about it is the brain is a hardware,</p>
<p>and the software it runs on is, what do you call it?</p>
<p>Is a cultural imprint.</p>
<p>All of this information that we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>from the Disney movies that you&rsquo;re reading,</p>
<p>telling you that damsels are to be saved by the prince</p>
<p>and all of that stuff, and girls wear pink and all, whatever.</p>
<p>You watch the movies, and all the movies,</p>
<p>whenever you watch images about Africa,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking to you about the blood diamonds,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re talking to you about slavery,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re talking to you about this,</p>
<p>and then no wonder you walk away</p>
<p>thinking that all the ills of Africa are caused</p>
<p>because of resource extraction, the diamonds,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re always fighting each other,</p>
<p>look at Idi Amin in the movie,</p>
<p>or slavery all the time, you walk away and this is it.</p>
<p>And we all programmed along the same lines,</p>
<p>see that&rsquo;s the beauty of it.</p>
<p>All of us are, because even some black people</p>
<p>who are gonna claim that they didn&rsquo;t visit up</p>
<p>when they registered, really?</p>
<p>So the truth, so then when I learned all of this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wow, this concept of if you&rsquo;ve got the brain,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got biases, it comes with the territory,</p>
<p>that makes sense.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t transcend</p>
<p>that function of a brain and that we should transcend it.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>because once you understand that,</p>
<p>a little bit more peace is created among us</p>
<p>because this is not about a black and white,</p>
<p>or a yellow and green issue,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about we are human issue.</p>
<p>And these are part of things we develop to stay around.</p>
<p>Just like we no longer have to rely on this fear of flight,</p>
<p>like ability of a brain because bears over there</p>
<p>start running and running fast, right?</p>
<p>Today, where are the bears?</p>
<p>Show me where they are.</p>
<p>But we have kept this tendency to go for fear of flight.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how they say it.</p>
<p>And so we have this courtesan done by the stress,</p>
<p>stress triggers that back in the days,</p>
<p>we have a stress trigger, we run,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all expelled out.</p>
<p>But today we get triggers</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know what to do with it</p>
<p>because where do we run to?</p>
<p>What do we do?</p>
<p>The bear is not even here.</p>
<p>So same thing here with that.</p>
<p>And so then you realize there&rsquo;s this whole thing</p>
<p>that is now what you understand</p>
<p>is that this problem is not about anti racism BS,</p>
<p>but it is about can each one of us</p>
<p>do the work where the work is needed,</p>
<p>which is we look inside.</p>
<p>Can we go for this work of deprogrammation?</p>
<p>This concept of a mindful practice</p>
<p>of undoing the habit of bias.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to do</p>
<p>with a simple categorization of black and white.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all kinds of biases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about everything.</p>
<p>And when I started on that journey</p>
<p>and my friend back then built this practice</p>
<p>of undoing your habit of unconscious bias,</p>
<p>we had all types of people come and say,</p>
<p>wow, I discovered that my bias is against larger people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m more like, what do you mean?</p>
<p>Well, I think it seems to me like I felt</p>
<p>that larger people maybe are dumb.</p>
<p>No, we heard things and you don&rsquo;t judge.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t judge.</p>
<p>And you see it&rsquo;s at every level.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like there&rsquo;s even this one friend,</p>
<p>she was like, when I looked into the whole dating thing,</p>
<p>I absolutely didn&rsquo;t want to date the Asian men</p>
<p>because her mind was into some stereotypes</p>
<p>about the size of whatever.</p>
<p>And she was like, no.</p>
<p>But you see, once you start,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this whole thing of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the five step thing, bias awareness.</p>
<p>This, basically at this level,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>to spot the biases in our culture,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where the cultural imprint comes from.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re watching this movie and you&rsquo;re realizing,</p>
<p>just like I said, wow, gee, I realized once again,</p>
<p>the black person is portrayed like the fog of a movie.</p>
<p>Or, you know, the Latina lady,</p>
<p>this is how she&rsquo;s been portrayed.</p>
<p>And you see it everywhere.</p>
<p>Even the NPR, NPR is happening,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re listening to something like NPR.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be more liberal than that.</p>
<p>And this gentleman is asking these two candidates,</p>
<p>one of them is a woman, political candidates,</p>
<p>the other one is a man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing him asking the lady a question</p>
<p>that I know he&rsquo;s not gonna ask the man and he didn&rsquo;t ask her.</p>
<p>He said, how do you balance your race with a family?</p>
<p>Does a man not have a family?</p>
<p>Right there, you see, it&rsquo;s very subtle.</p>
<p>But you see, but because now my mind is kind of trained</p>
<p>to see things, I&rsquo;m like, interesting.</p>
<p>Or like when the media just says,</p>
<p>froze climate change issue on something</p>
<p>without even the choice of words.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>You open a book everywhere.</p>
<p>The interesting thing though,</p>
<p>I mean, even that man, woman example,</p>
<p>is I think it&rsquo;s really powerful</p>
<p>to bring that bias to the surface,</p>
<p>but not let that lead to kind of fear and paralysis.</p>
<p>You should almost, I mean, that&rsquo;s where humor is,</p>
<p>make fun of it, bring it to the surface,</p>
<p>like acknowledge the fact that those things</p>
<p>are a part of the conversation.</p>
<p>And a lot of them are, it is, it&rsquo;s a cultural imprint</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s part of culture.</p>
<p>And that might be, there could be,</p>
<p>I grew up in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>where the gender roles were stronger than in other places.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the culture.</p>
<p>We have to acknowledge that this is how,</p>
<p>this is affecting how I think.</p>
<p>We might like how that works, we might not,</p>
<p>but we have to acknowledge it and not get,</p>
<p>make it part of humor, make fun of yourself,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why this first step is bias awareness.</p>
<p>So you get, you train yourself, oh yeah, okay,</p>
<p>that was one or it&rsquo;s, you know, and it&rsquo;s about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in you, we&rsquo;re talking about you, we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And then from there, you&rsquo;re like replace the bias,</p>
<p>like bias replacement.</p>
<p>Then it is where you practice the empathy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, gee, wow, I wonder how I would feel</p>
<p>every day I walk into a store</p>
<p>and the guy thinks he should be following me</p>
<p>because maybe I might steal something because I&rsquo;m black.</p>
<p>Because once you try that,</p>
<p>to put yourself in the other person&rsquo;s shoes,</p>
<p>all of a sudden something else starts to click.</p>
<p>And then from there, you go on to making connection.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re making a connection</p>
<p>and then things start to change because now you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making, then you make cultural immersion.</p>
<p>So this is where we had some people like this one woman,</p>
<p>she was very quite, very feminist oriented.</p>
<p>And she had an issue with women wearing the hijab.</p>
<p>And because for her it was like, how come you,</p>
<p>how come, how come you just lower, you know,</p>
<p>like how come you&rsquo;re accepting this demeaning of yourself,</p>
<p>not understanding everything else that comes with it.</p>
<p>But through, as she understood that she even had that bias,</p>
<p>then she went on through all the different processes.</p>
<p>And then eventually when comes the next step,</p>
<p>cultural immersion, she started going to the mosque</p>
<p>during Ramadan when the Muslims are doing, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s the holy month of, you know, fasting</p>
<p>and then we break at night.</p>
<p>And she started understanding very different things.</p>
<p>And eventually happens the last step that happens naturally,</p>
<p>making a true, real, genuine connection.</p>
<p>And this is where friendships happen.</p>
<p>This is where that&rsquo;s it, your bias can go home now</p>
<p>because it has been challenged with reality</p>
<p>and understanding.</p>
<p>And so for me, that is what I was after.</p>
<p>And then, but then the world was just like,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to be told we&rsquo;re part of a problem.</p>
<p>So, but I still reckon that it is the type of mindfulness,</p>
<p>type of practice that&rsquo;s going to need to happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s very internal to you.</p>
<p>It is not, and it happens, everybody at their own pace.</p>
<p>So all of this, I take it back to the racism,</p>
<p>the question you were asking me.</p>
<p>Does racism exist?</p>
<p>Yes, it does.</p>
<p>Is it going to stop me from doing anything I want to do?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is it going to make it harder?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But this is where, for anybody who is serious</p>
<p>about making sure, about fighting racism,</p>
<p>I think the only job you have to do is to make sure</p>
<p>that people keep their sense of self agency</p>
<p>and B, can you help provide people with the tools</p>
<p>to stand up?</p>
<p>So this is why I have so much respect for Van Jones.</p>
<p>People like Van Jones,</p>
<p>although I disagree with him on so many things,</p>
<p>but people like Ms. Alice Johnson,</p>
<p>she was pardoned by President Trump</p>
<p>through the work of people like Van Jones</p>
<p>and Kim Kardashian and others.</p>
<p>They all joined forces.</p>
<p>This is a case where people of,</p>
<p>and those folks then went on to combine forces furthermore,</p>
<p>no regard given to their political belongings.</p>
<p>They said, if the issue is criminal justice reform,</p>
<p>then anybody who stands for it has to come together.</p>
<p>And so what they did in this situation</p>
<p>with what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>criminal justice reform in my mind</p>
<p>is a valid action to fight racism in my mind.</p>
<p>Because what are you doing there?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to get people out of jail</p>
<p>who really have no business being there.</p>
<p>And also when you have people like Bishop Omar</p>
<p>and the people, he passed away, unfortunately,</p>
<p>but today we have Anton Lucky,</p>
<p>who was in jail for having killed his cousin.</p>
<p>He had started,</p>
<p>I think he started the gang in South Dallas.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking really tough guy</p>
<p>who was reading the wrong side of the equation.</p>
<p>And then in jail, literally he found Plato,</p>
<p>the cave and all that.</p>
<p>So today these people, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we hear more about them?</p>
<p>The urban specialists.</p>
<p>Because these people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about the anti racism crap of Candy O&rsquo;Donoghue,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again, until the cows come home,</p>
<p>but it is about, we go where help is needed.</p>
<p>We go in urban, inner city,</p>
<p>inner city, black inner city neighborhoods</p>
<p>and block by block we change the culture.</p>
<p>And they say it like that, it&rsquo;s their words.</p>
<p>These are African American people</p>
<p>who have as many rights as anybody else</p>
<p>to talk about their own culture.</p>
<p>And they will tell you, we have to change the culture.</p>
<p>I have some videos like that on my YouTube</p>
<p>with Bishop Omar.</p>
<p>What these people are doing is what we need to do.</p>
<p>Bishop will explain and say,</p>
<p>sometimes people are their feet and feet</p>
<p>deep down in the mud.</p>
<p>And what we have to do is to try to pull them up.</p>
<p>And you cannot say you didn&rsquo;t pull them up</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not seeing their head out yet,</p>
<p>but how much progress have they made from the bottom</p>
<p>to where they are now and keep going.</p>
<p>So what I see these people doing,</p>
<p>you see, I have so much,</p>
<p>I love and respect Glen Lowry and company,</p>
<p>and Ian Rove and all of those guys.</p>
<p>I love them.</p>
<p>I love a lot of the things that they say.</p>
<p>This whole concept of personal responsibility,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just like, at some point,</p>
<p>it also needs to be matched up with real actions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the people like Anton Lucky,</p>
<p>urban specialist, Alice Johnson are doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going where it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Alice Johnson is getting people out of jail</p>
<p>every single day, literally.</p>
<p>And then people like Anton Lucky and his team</p>
<p>are giving them the tools to live the gang life,</p>
<p>to be better people, to go for a life of redemption.</p>
<p>This is happening right now.</p>
<p>But what I find is they&rsquo;re not getting</p>
<p>the bulk of the attention.</p>
<p>But anybody who&rsquo;s serious about this is why,</p>
<p>how I would love to see people do anti racism</p>
<p>is help lift people up for real.</p>
<p>Action.</p>
<p>Support school choice.</p>
<p>Support school choice.</p>
<p>Black mamas, they know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And when they tell you we want school choice,</p>
<p>they know what to talk about.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not idiots.</p>
<p>Especially at the local level.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Helping them at the local level.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So help them make sure that they can take their kids</p>
<p>out of these public schools that are doing</p>
<p>horrendous things to them.</p>
<p>You know, Miss Virginia, watch that movie.</p>
<p>How could you not support black moms in this country</p>
<p>to take the kids to safety when it comes to education?</p>
<p>How come not?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I want to see happen.</p>
<p>And not like some, yeah, let&rsquo;s go to some classrooms</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s white.</p>
<p>You go over here.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s a next date.</p>
<p>You go over here.</p>
<p>And kids, let us tell you about this.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>As a black person, I don&rsquo;t want you to do any of that crap.</p>
<p>Let me grow my wings.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you want, help put some fuel behind them</p>
<p>and let me take my flight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m asking for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way for you to be part of a racism battle</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you think is the most important battle</p>
<p>of our life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I have to say about that.</p>
<p>And so for me, I&rsquo;m keeping my head very straight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about what enables black people to thrive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need for you to be an activist on my behalf.</p>
<p>No, because when you&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing exactly what you&rsquo;ve been doing to us</p>
<p>black people in Africa our whole life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need your white savior complex</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what anti racism is.</p>
<p>White savior complex.</p>
<p>That stuff doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It only works to make you feel better</p>
<p>about how superior you are to me.</p>
<p>But it does nothing, absolutely nothing</p>
<p>to change my everyday life.</p>
<p>If it is not, if it is at least in the African side</p>
<p>to actually even change my,</p>
<p>turn me into somebody who&rsquo;s waiting for handouts.</p>
<p>So I would encourage people to really,</p>
<p>those people who are really serious</p>
<p>about wanting to be part of a solution.</p>
<p>And I know there are many out there</p>
<p>for the love of God and everything that&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>and we care about, stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about, think about what&rsquo;s gonna enable people.</p>
<p>Maybe the word is wrongly chosen,</p>
<p>but know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Give them the freedom to spread their wings.</p>
<p>Yes, give a person, teach a person how to fish</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t give them a fish.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re putting your stupid signs on the lawn</p>
<p>with Black Lives Matter and all that crap,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not helping.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re buying one more anti racism book</p>
<p>or as a company, financing one more DEI,</p>
<p>if it done along those lines, I think we&rsquo;ve got a problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you do think that the efforts of diversity,</p>
<p>equity and inclusion are often not effective.</p>
<p>Not only are they not effective,</p>
<p>but they also backfire and there are reports on all of this.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, it makes sense.</p>
<p>It makes sense.</p>
<p>So for me, I am very, very glad</p>
<p>that people have developed an enlightenment about this.</p>
<p>Very happy about that, very.</p>
<p>But let us not keep going</p>
<p>for the easy perceived solution to problems.</p>
<p>Again, they&rsquo;ve done this to us, the poor people of Africa.</p>
<p>They thought the solution was to give.</p>
<p>It does not work.</p>
<p>And then they say, oh, we&rsquo;re gonna do social entrepreneurship</p>
<p>on you, Tom shoes, buy one pair of shoes</p>
<p>and we give one pair of shoes</p>
<p>to some people in poor countries.</p>
<p>Then guess what happened to us?</p>
<p>You know, in the town where we operate in Senegal,</p>
<p>where I have my little manufacturing,</p>
<p>we have 2000 little mom and pop businesses.</p>
<p>And guess what they happen to be in Lex?</p>
<p>Shoemakers, right?</p>
<p>So every shoemakers, each one of them hires</p>
<p>at least five, 15 people.</p>
<p>Do the math, family businesses.</p>
<p>Guess what happens to them the day the Tom shoes truck</p>
<p>shows up with bunch of free shoes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who can compete against free?</p>
<p>Now, all of these people,</p>
<p>little by little gonna have to close their shops</p>
<p>because who can compete against free</p>
<p>because Tom shoes dumping all of his shoes on them.</p>
<p>And then they go out of business</p>
<p>and now instead of helping anybody,</p>
<p>you actually sent all the kids</p>
<p>who depended on these adults working in these places.</p>
<p>Now they have to join the rank of kids</p>
<p>who need to be given shoes</p>
<p>because you took their parents ability</p>
<p>to make money through their wages, buy them shoes.</p>
<p>You see?</p>
<p>So first they said, we just have to give.</p>
<p>So that was primarily, you know, the charity business.</p>
<p>And you still have foreign aid business going on.</p>
<p>So we just need to give.</p>
<p>And then the social entrepreneurs came in place,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m like, the only person for this business is good</p>
<p>is for Blake McCarthy, you know, the founder of Tom shoes.</p>
<p>But other than that, I&rsquo;m not sure really seeing</p>
<p>who else is winning from this.</p>
<p>And then they, and so today my whole thing is</p>
<p>we got a challenge to have a mind for the poor</p>
<p>or to have a mind for the lesser fortunate,</p>
<p>maybe in this country, it is easy.</p>
<p>And lesser fortunate, you know,</p>
<p>for anybody that you feel like is being trampled upon</p>
<p>because of something,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s because of economic circumstances,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s race in this case, whatever.</p>
<p>To have a heart for the lesser fortunate among us,</p>
<p>for whatever reason, that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>But to have a mind for them, that&rsquo;s the challenge.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a difficult question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As if we were not already asking difficult questions.</p>
<p>The president of Senegal, Macky Saw,</p>
<p>is also now the chair of the African Union.</p>
<p>He met with the president of Vladimir Putin on June 3rd.</p>
<p>I think primarily was to discuss food security.</p>
<p>Africa seems to be split halfway on their perspective</p>
<p>in the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>So broadly speaking, what do you think about this?</p>
<p>First of all, the geopolitics of Africa</p>
<p>and the geopolitical relationship of Africa</p>
<p>with the rest of the world and this current conflict</p>
<p>with the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts there?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve seen that many countries</p>
<p>when it was time to vote, some of them abstained,</p>
<p>which in a way says something.</p>
<p>I think for the Africans today,</p>
<p>especially as represented by the African Union,</p>
<p>because not all countries fall along the same lines,</p>
<p>I feel like, again, we&rsquo;re back to way back.</p>
<p>For the longest time, the West tries to tell us what to do.</p>
<p>They decide for us.</p>
<p>And here, there&rsquo;s trouble,</p>
<p>meaning there&rsquo;s definitely a rift, major one,</p>
<p>between most of the Western world</p>
<p>as represented by Europe and America primarily,</p>
<p>and you have Australia and all that.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>I think this is more or less an attempt</p>
<p>to stand on their own as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t tell us what to do as usual.</p>
<p>You always rope us in with, when it makes sense for you,</p>
<p>you try to rope us in,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re left hanging on our own.</p>
<p>So this goes back to the sentiment</p>
<p>you were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been challenging for me to watch this</p>
<p>because remember, I have one foot also,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s what I get to see and hear</p>
<p>from being in the Western world,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also what I get to see and hear</p>
<p>from when I&rsquo;m back home.</p>
<p>So I wear all hats.</p>
<p>And I think this is a situation</p>
<p>where the African Union and African nations in general</p>
<p>are saying, this is a case where almost like,</p>
<p>you guys are fighting, you guys are fighting.</p>
<p>Maybe for once, we have to watch out for ourselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a sense in which this is the embodiment</p>
<p>sort of abstaining from a vote on the war in Ukraine</p>
<p>is a political embodiment of a resistance</p>
<p>to the influence of the West.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the war between,</p>
<p>whatever you guys are fighting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s saying, we&rsquo;re not going to let this particular empire</p>
<p>that seems to be at the top right now,</p>
<p>which is the United States empire in Europe,</p>
<p>to dominate our political discourse,</p>
<p>our geopolitical considerations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like, no, we&rsquo;re not touching this.</p>
<p>Yeah, especially that given usually.</p>
<p>So when they need us, again, for influence,</p>
<p>which means more power,</p>
<p>oh, you guys vote the same way we do.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s all over and they go back to spreading,</p>
<p>they go back to, how do you say that?</p>
<p>They go back to exchanging and sharing between themselves</p>
<p>the goodies of their Halloween collection.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re no longer, we&rsquo;re not there</p>
<p>when the goodies are being shared.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s definitely one of those situations.</p>
<p>But for me, it still is hard</p>
<p>because I watch everything that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be complicated,</p>
<p>the ramifications of all of this.</p>
<p>I would like to see our African leaders also,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing is clear,</p>
<p>but this is a place where I&rsquo;m also tempted to say,</p>
<p>yes and.</p>
<p>Yes to the reasons you&rsquo;re advancing right now,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to be always siding because we&rsquo;re tired.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re tired of always being dragged around</p>
<p>and taken for granted and you vote our way.</p>
<p>Come on guys, when you need us,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re great and everything is good.</p>
<p>And then when it&rsquo;s time to go and share the goodies,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>And you actually go for policies that go against us.</p>
<p>But in this situation though,</p>
<p>I would like to still see us do the right thing.</p>
<p>In my case, I was not very happy to see us going</p>
<p>and more or less begging for,</p>
<p>what do you call it?</p>
<p>Cereals, oh, please let the cereals make it.</p>
<p>So at least we get them and we don&rsquo;t starve.</p>
<p>I can understand why a president would say something</p>
<p>like that or try to negotiate something like that.</p>
<p>But when it comes to an African president having to do that</p>
<p>with a non African president, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>but for me, it&rsquo;s too close to begging.</p>
<p>Listen, it&rsquo;s hard to be a leader,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a difficult dance because in some sense,</p>
<p>sort of the flip side of that is you&rsquo;re creating a market,</p>
<p>a geopolitical market of saying,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re willing to sit down at the table with America,</p>
<p>with European leaders, with Russian leaders, with China,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna let you guys convince us</p>
<p>who we should collaborate with.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what sort of great nations</p>
<p>and groups of nations do.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a cynical, of course,</p>
<p>a dark perspective on that because what&rsquo;s in that game</p>
<p>played by leaders, the people that hurt,</p>
<p>people of Ukraine hurt, people of Africa can hurt.</p>
<p>People of Russia.</p>
<p>People of Russia can hurt, people of China,</p>
<p>people of United States, but it is the way of the world.</p>
<p>And to earn, you have to earn respect</p>
<p>and sometimes earning respect leads to the suffering</p>
<p>of many.</p>
<p>Well, but except in this case, yes to all of that.</p>
<p>And the reason why I&rsquo;m actually upset</p>
<p>with going and being like, oh, can you let at least</p>
<p>the boats that are supposed to come to Africa</p>
<p>full of cereals come over, the wheat and all that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, look, Africa has the highest land</p>
<p>that you can do agriculture on.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>We have a larger surface, such surface in the world.</p>
<p>Why is this not a time for us to try</p>
<p>to win ourselves off of cereals that we don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>have on the ground?</p>
<p>But no, let us go and plead.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t beg, create instead.</p>
<p>Create instead, exactly.</p>
<p>This should have been, you know, just like how</p>
<p>the rest of the world when COVID happened</p>
<p>and China had to close off for different reasons</p>
<p>and since then has not, you know, completely reopened</p>
<p>and people have started to realize, wow,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got too much, we&rsquo;re too dependent on China</p>
<p>for a lot of what we need.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna have to bring back some production</p>
<p>to the US, the Europeans are doing the same, all of that.</p>
<p>This should have been a time for African leaders</p>
<p>to be like, we need to be serious now</p>
<p>about, you know, food security.</p>
<p>And maybe the stuff that maybe don&rsquo;t grow</p>
<p>under our climates necessarily,</p>
<p>can we work on coming up with different things?</p>
<p>Now I understand that it can take time,</p>
<p>but if I knew that that was happening at the same time</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re saying, oh, well, let the cereals come in,</p>
<p>maybe I would be a little bit easier with it.</p>
<p>But right now I&rsquo;m just like,</p>
<p>is it gonna be the same business as usual?</p>
<p>And in this case, I&rsquo;m just like, are we gonna go,</p>
<p>are we gonna keep going from one masa to another masa?</p>
<p>I mean, really?</p>
<p>The interesting aspect of all of this</p>
<p>is if we look at all of human history,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that the 21st century is defined by Africa.</p>
<p>It will be.</p>
<p>And the young people, the huge number of young people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the trajectory could be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much possibility to define</p>
<p>the future of human civilization in Africa.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean sort of in the next 10 years,</p>
<p>I mean in the next 50 years.</p>
<p>So some people are concerned about overpopulation.</p>
<p>Some people are concerned about us dying out</p>
<p>as a human species.</p>
<p>And both of those people live in us.</p>
<p>Talk to me often about that.</p>
<p>I know, I know, I know, I know who they are.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your, in Africa is at the center of this</p>
<p>because there is a vibrant, huge number,</p>
<p>probably over a billion people.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re 1.3 billion people</p>
<p>and of those, one billion blacks.</p>
<p>I mean that, where do you land on that?</p>
<p>There is a reason why I say I&rsquo;m haunted,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m obsessed, that I&rsquo;m monomaniacal</p>
<p>when it comes to the free markets</p>
<p>and that I have such a strong sense of urgency</p>
<p>to the point that literally it is affecting me.</p>
<p>And it has to do with the fact that yes,</p>
<p>you have the youngest region on earth</p>
<p>in terms of the age of its population</p>
<p>and the rate at which it&rsquo;s growing demographic wise,</p>
<p>I am not willing to stay there and say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a curse for humanity,</p>
<p>but it will be a curse for humanity</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t make sure that these people,</p>
<p>our youth gets to partake.</p>
<p>And what it takes to partake is not much.</p>
<p>So if the rest of the world thinks that</p>
<p>get to partake means you have to send more foreign aid,</p>
<p>you have to have more charity businesses,</p>
<p>I mean charity organizations sending stuff away,</p>
<p>of course, you&rsquo;re almost thinking parasites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say it this way,</p>
<p>if this is what you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing us as no more than parasites.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>I could see why some people might be worried about that.</p>
<p>Although humans should never be seen as parasites,</p>
<p>no matter, no matter, no matter.</p>
<p>But some people will go there.</p>
<p>Now, people are here.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do, dispose of them?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an option.</p>
<p>So the only option we have left</p>
<p>is to make sure that people partake.</p>
<p>And what partaking means is that</p>
<p>people get included in them</p>
<p>and are part of the systems that allow for human flourishing.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not much.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s about,</p>
<p>can we be serious about the reforms?</p>
<p>So we have free market zones,</p>
<p>areas where people,</p>
<p>where the flourishing can start to take place.</p>
<p>The wealth that people will need to flourish,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t need you to give it to them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all about, can I let you fly?</p>
<p>And you will make it happen for you and also for me.</p>
<p>Every young African I see today,</p>
<p>I realize how stupid the rest of the world is</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not supporting what I&rsquo;m trying to talk about.</p>
<p>Cause even if you don&rsquo;t wanna do it</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the right thing to do,</p>
<p>which I think it is the right thing to do,</p>
<p>your selfishness, maybe engage your selfishness.</p>
<p>Cause this person right there,</p>
<p>remember I told you seven billion geniuses,</p>
<p>everybody came to this world</p>
<p>with a piece of solution to the human problem.</p>
<p>This person and that person and that person</p>
<p>hold something for me because I&rsquo;m part of humanity.</p>
<p>This person might have a cure to a cancer</p>
<p>that might take my wife out, the wife I haven&rsquo;t met yet.</p>
<p>But this kid right here has it inside.</p>
<p>And if I help this,</p>
<p>if I make sure that this kid gets a chance to flourish</p>
<p>and to manifest his genius or her genius,</p>
<p>that trickle down many years later,</p>
<p>comes straight back to serve me and the love of my life.</p>
<p>If we can&rsquo;t see it any other way,</p>
<p>maybe let&rsquo;s try to think about it that way.</p>
<p>Cause it becomes a very good proposition at that point.</p>
<p>So in this case, by 2050,</p>
<p>Lagos, Nigeria will be the largest city in the world.</p>
<p>The future is African, whether we want it or not.</p>
<p>But is it going to be an African future</p>
<p>where you have a youth being a ticking bomb?</p>
<p>Because they have not, there&rsquo;s no hope.</p>
<p>They stay in poverty</p>
<p>because they belong to nations that don&rsquo;t even understand</p>
<p>sometimes the importance of common law versus civil law.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re trapped in countries that don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that you need to make the legal framework</p>
<p>to provide for better economic freedom.</p>
<p>So you can unleash the genuineness, the awesomeness,</p>
<p>the ingenuity, the industrious side of your young people,</p>
<p>especially of your women,</p>
<p>so that they build all the wealth</p>
<p>that your nation is gonna need you to build.</p>
<p>And with it, the respect that comes from that.</p>
<p>See, we have a choice to make.</p>
<p>And this is why I feel so, so, so restless about this</p>
<p>at this point of my life.</p>
<p>We just lost George Hayite.</p>
<p>George Hayite is one of the few Africans that I knew</p>
<p>who put this out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who I learned from.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And I feel a strong sense of urgency</p>
<p>to not only bring back to the table</p>
<p>that which he has been working on,</p>
<p>but to also make sure that it gets seen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why being here talking with you today,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you have no idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, people ask, if someone like you could say,</p>
<p>what can I do?</p>
<p>You did more than you could ever imagine</p>
<p>by just allowing me to take this message to one more person.</p>
<p>And because if we do this,</p>
<p>the change is gonna happen somewhere down the line.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah, the ripple effects of all of that</p>
<p>on the unlocking the human potential.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>All those people in Africa are building cool stuff,</p>
<p>amazing things.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>So some are gonna be built stuff,</p>
<p>others are gonna work on the reforms.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re working on reforms, by the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the head of the Africa Center for Prosperity</p>
<p>of the Atlas Network,</p>
<p>the largest organization in the world</p>
<p>working on taking down barriers of entry</p>
<p>for entrepreneurs around the world</p>
<p>in their respective countries.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re doing great work there.</p>
<p>I basically, all the, obviously all the think tanks</p>
<p>we have in Africa right now, free market think tanks,</p>
<p>and we wanna promote more of them to come up.</p>
<p>And these are local solutions by local people</p>
<p>for their local problems, always.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we draw the line.</p>
<p>And so there, so we&rsquo;re working on reforms primarily</p>
<p>and making people understand the free markets</p>
<p>and the importance of it.</p>
<p>But it is piecemeal legislation.</p>
<p>It takes time.</p>
<p>It is hard.</p>
<p>By the time you accomplish something here,</p>
<p>more crap has happened over here.</p>
<p>More laws have been pounded up</p>
<p>because you know how they fix a bad law most of the time.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s in the US or somewhere else.</p>
<p>Put other laws to kind of undo the law from before,</p>
<p>but it keeps stacking up.</p>
<p>And before you know it,</p>
<p>where you should have one thing and it&rsquo;s clear,</p>
<p>you have a hundred and they go against each other</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s all, it&rsquo;s worse.</p>
<p>So we have piecemeal legislation that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Our teams are doing really amazing, fantastic work,</p>
<p>especially the team in Imani in Ghana.</p>
<p>We have a group in Burundi, in the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>I mean, people are doing amazing work, amazing work,</p>
<p>but we need to run faster.</p>
<p>So while we keep, we help them running faster,</p>
<p>we also have to unlock other things.</p>
<p>And right now I&rsquo;m working</p>
<p>on one of my most craziest projects.</p>
<p>Something bold, radical, crazy for some people.</p>
<p>But I know we&rsquo;re not crazy</p>
<p>because before us, Singapore has done it.</p>
<p>You know, Hong Kong has done it.</p>
<p>Latest, the most recent China with the SSEs,</p>
<p>the special economic zones,</p>
<p>some of the most radical free market zones in the world,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>And oftentimes within a generation,</p>
<p>meaningful change start to happen, right?</p>
<p>So here, what I&rsquo;m working on is this concept of,</p>
<p>some call it charter cities, Paul Romer,</p>
<p>others call it the free cities.</p>
<p>And I like to call it startup cities.</p>
<p>What these are is for us to think about,</p>
<p>okay, if piecemeal legislation takes forever,</p>
<p>while we have this demographic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s growing faster and faster in Africa,</p>
<p>there is a discrepancy here</p>
<p>between the progress we&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>to set the right environment for business to prop up,</p>
<p>and how many more people are coming to life,</p>
<p>literally every day on the continent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a discrepancy here.</p>
<p>And so, the ticking bomb is going faster</p>
<p>than the progress we can make.</p>
<p>This is a problem.</p>
<p>So what some of us are working on</p>
<p>is this concept of a startup cities</p>
<p>and to say, piecemeal legislation takes too long.</p>
<p>How about we continue doing that work,</p>
<p>which is essential and critical,</p>
<p>but at the same time, can we think of zones,</p>
<p>and I like to call them also common law zones,</p>
<p>where we basically try to have within the country</p>
<p>an area where for business,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about family law or any of that stuff,</p>
<p>no one is touching your culture or anything like that,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re just saying business wise,</p>
<p>an enclave where you have the best practices</p>
<p>from around the world, including yours,</p>
<p>in terms of what constitute a great business environment</p>
<p>and allow people in,</p>
<p>like you get in freely or nobody&rsquo;s forcing you to go,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s forcing you to whatever.</p>
<p>So basically, you&rsquo;re to think about</p>
<p>this rather unoccupied plot of land within a country,</p>
<p>think Dubai, on 110 acres of land,</p>
<p>Dubai is thinking that in their case,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, maybe they decided,</p>
<p>maybe Sharia law is not the best for business in their case.</p>
<p>And they said, they looked around and were like,</p>
<p>wow, but common law, especially British common law,</p>
<p>seems like a very good one.</p>
<p>So at that point, they decided for business only,</p>
<p>not family or anything like that,</p>
<p>which is gonna stand to Sharia or whatever.</p>
<p>And so they said, we are gonna bring in,</p>
<p>so they hired retired British common law judges</p>
<p>to educate the law and train the people under there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m oversimplifying, but at the end of the day,</p>
<p>within a generation,</p>
<p>Dubai became one of the top</p>
<p>international financial centers of the world.</p>
<p>It is what it is today.</p>
<p>And in the case of the African nations,</p>
<p>that zone can then spread.</p>
<p>Yes, it can not only spread, but maybe let&rsquo;s say Senegal,</p>
<p>if Senegal was to go for this, here you have this one,</p>
<p>and then over there you have another zone.</p>
<p>And then what they start to do</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re not all modeled the same way,</p>
<p>because maybe this one is saying,</p>
<p>hey, we wanna attract more, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe we wanna attract more medical research, right?</p>
<p>This one is gonna be saying,</p>
<p>maybe we wanna attract more crypto,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s gonna be more like us,</p>
<p>we wanna be more about religious this or whatever.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So we wanted to fit more of this or that.</p>
<p>And just kind of give the basics, the grounds,</p>
<p>and then watch the magic happen on it, right?</p>
<p>And so this is what we&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>And the hope there, because some people are like,</p>
<p>I know some people are like, you guys are crazy,</p>
<p>but hey, I&rsquo;m like, no, it&rsquo;s more or less the story</p>
<p>of the Asian tigers.</p>
<p>And most recently, most of China&rsquo;s progress,</p>
<p>economically speaking, because some people might say,</p>
<p>well, you don&rsquo;t want China, we&rsquo;re developing, you see.</p>
<p>Even then I say, and it&rsquo;s okay, you can always do better,</p>
<p>but we cannot deny what the magic</p>
<p>that they have accomplished, what they have accomplished</p>
<p>is nothing short of a miracle.</p>
<p>800 million people getting out of poverty</p>
<p>in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, yeah, for the quality of life</p>
<p>and the majority of the Chinese population.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Does something like that happen without problems?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>And so the next person to do something</p>
<p>just actually gets to learn from lessons,</p>
<p>from lessons, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>And leapfrog.</p>
<p>And leapfrog, and leapfrog, exactly.</p>
<p>So for me, this is a promise.</p>
<p>And the people are like, oh, but you guys are crazy.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like, just like with everything,</p>
<p>do you know how many attempts it took</p>
<p>before the first flight, the Wright brothers took off?</p>
<p>Do you know how many?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>You try, you crash, you try, you crash,</p>
<p>but each time you&rsquo;re going up higher</p>
<p>and you want to get up for once, then you stay up longer.</p>
<p>And before you know it, you&rsquo;re doing all types of things.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>And I tell people, listen, all I need is one success story.</p>
<p>And then the sea change.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t even wait for us.</p>
<p>Everybody.</p>
<p>But this is hard because it&rsquo;s the first time.</p>
<p>But the good news is there are many groups</p>
<p>working on the continent.</p>
<p>There are some groups in Zambia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a zone there.</p>
<p>Folks are doing something like this in Nigeria.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re part of a project there in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The one that I&rsquo;m most excited about,</p>
<p>I cannot disclose the name of the country yet.</p>
<p>But my god, I&rsquo;m so excited by it.</p>
<p>And I just know, I just know, Lex,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to happen in our lifetime.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really powerful vision.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not being dramatic to say</p>
<p>that the future of humanity depends on your success,</p>
<p>that success in Africa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an important continent.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>In this century.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the continent where everything started.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s the continent where that continent has</p>
<p>to finally, finally, finally thrive.</p>
<p>We cannot, all of us, call ourselves an enlightened</p>
<p>society as a whole.</p>
<p>When you have such, when you have this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a humongous continent.</p>
<p>Have you seen the size of it?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to fathom, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And it has such ingenious people.</p>
<p>Sometimes I look at my people.</p>
<p>I have to tell you, I&rsquo;m so proud of them,</p>
<p>and the young people, especially.</p>
<p>And you know, you would look at them.</p>
<p>And you know, somebody said sometimes one day,</p>
<p>and it was so true, they said, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen poverty other places.</p>
<p>But here, it is just, maybe somebody doesn&rsquo;t have money,</p>
<p>but they have dignity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So everything else we can handle,</p>
<p>and we will handle.</p>
<p>You have to mark my word for this.</p>
<p>This is going to happen.</p>
<p>And our youth is amazing.</p>
<p>You should see them.</p>
<p>So full of creativity.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You know, you were telling me, what makes you different?</p>
<p>Many things makes us all different.</p>
<p>You know, the Rwandans are very different from the West</p>
<p>Africans that we are.</p>
<p>Rwandans, for example, never dance with their hips.</p>
<p>They dance more like, you know, with this part of the body.</p>
<p>West Africans hips?</p>
<p>Us, it&rsquo;s hips all over the place, all the time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, more jumping, stuff like that.</p>
<p>In Rwanda, you feel it&rsquo;s more like, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, they remind me more of, you know, the ballet thing.</p>
<p>Rwandans have a sense where, you know,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t eat, you know, so much in public.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something you do.</p>
<p>Us, we are, the West Africans, we like to be loud.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost like the Italians of the continent.</p>
<p>And then the Rwandans are more like, you know, the Swiss stuff.</p>
<p>Actually, the country even looks like Switzerland.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re so different from one group to another.</p>
<p>Then you go to the Congo and you see these guys,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so crazy.</p>
<p>We have a dress, I mean, les sapeurs.</p>
<p>So we are a very different bunch.</p>
<p>But you know what I love about us,</p>
<p>what I love about my people?</p>
<p>We are the manifestation of what resiliency means.</p>
<p>And so everything we need is there.</p>
<p>Everything we need is there.</p>
<p>I will say that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the seed.</p>
<p>Everything that&rsquo;s wrong with us</p>
<p>is that pot that we put around us.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re tired of being bonsai people.</p>
<p>We need to be the tallest trees in the forest</p>
<p>that we were designed to be.</p>
<p>And so&hellip;</p>
<p>And that can be fixed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the beauty of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I am so, I&rsquo;m almost dizzy with,</p>
<p>I get dizzy with hope.</p>
<p>I know my history.</p>
<p>I know my economics, my fellow humans and all of that.</p>
<p>And we know that there&rsquo;s an unfailing recipe.</p>
<p>And when it comes to that recipe,</p>
<p>we have the hardest part of it.</p>
<p>The one missing ingredient, which is the free markets.</p>
<p>As we go around and talk and people start to understand</p>
<p>and each country tries to figure out,</p>
<p>okay, where do we go there from here?</p>
<p>I know that I will die with my continent</p>
<p>having taken the right shift for a turn.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to see where it ends</p>
<p>because I cannot in my wildest dream</p>
<p>imagine where it&rsquo;s gonna end.</p>
<p>But I know it&rsquo;s gonna be, yeah.</p>
<p>So my only job is to get this message out</p>
<p>and then let my people do with it what they wanna do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Yeah, the scale of impact is just boundless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes we think about individual problems</p>
<p>and how do we solve them?</p>
<p>We look up at certain individuals,</p>
<p>like the, I don&rsquo;t know, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so much more powerful to just,</p>
<p>without knowing what they will do,</p>
<p>give the freedom to millions,</p>
<p>to hundreds of millions of people</p>
<p>to do whatever the hell they&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>Can you imagine?</p>
<p>Can you just imagine?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly, truly exciting.</p>
<p>So in that sense, the work you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unimaginable the kind of impact it would have.</p>
<p>Now, going back to that hard moment,</p>
<p>this dark place you went in your mind</p>
<p>and your personal life story, you lost your husband.</p>
<p>What gave you strength during that time?</p>
<p>What were the places you went to your mind</p>
<p>in terms of personal struggle,</p>
<p>in terms of maybe even depression</p>
<p>or these kinds of struggles?</p>
<p>I think for me, when my person passed away,</p>
<p>I went to,</p>
<p>maybe my friends could see what was going on,</p>
<p>maybe they couldn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But on the surface, I looked like I was fine.</p>
<p>But what happened is the only thing I think</p>
<p>that kept me around as I thought about it</p>
<p>was the job to be done.</p>
<p>These women relied on me and I was no longer free.</p>
<p>I did not own myself.</p>
<p>And they said it in those words,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t own yourself anymore.</p>
<p>And it was true, but it helped me</p>
<p>because I was able to, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes whatever it takes to keep you around,</p>
<p>whatever it takes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I would tell people who feel like</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t just push one more push</p>
<p>and they think they need to end it.</p>
<p>At that point, whatever it takes,</p>
<p>just stick around for one more second</p>
<p>because the next second, you know.</p>
<p>So I stuck around because of duty.</p>
<p>I felt a very strong sense of duty.</p>
<p>My duty was in this case, I think,</p>
<p>stronger than my pain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that was possible, but it was.</p>
<p>And I just pushed my grief under the rug for years.</p>
<p>For years, I worked like a mad lady.</p>
<p>I would travel, I would do three states in three days,</p>
<p>landing at two in the morning,</p>
<p>around five or six going right along with our distributors</p>
<p>because it was beverage and just keep going</p>
<p>and have all of this energy and look like everything is fine.</p>
<p>But what happened was just like,</p>
<p>I was focused on the job to be done.</p>
<p>And sometimes it is okay to do that.</p>
<p>At least for me, it was my safety.</p>
<p>You know, like when you&rsquo;re in the water</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re about to sink and they throw you that,</p>
<p>that round thing, I don&rsquo;t know how you call it.</p>
<p>You know, that, you know.</p>
<p>I think that keeps you afloat, you mean?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, the floater.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the floater. Yeah, whatever.</p>
<p>Listen, between the two of us, we&rsquo;re still terrible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re bad.</p>
<p>So I said, you, you, you.</p>
<p>I know exactly what you mean.</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>So you understand me.</p>
<p>So they send you that thing and you just,</p>
<p>I was just hanging onto it.</p>
<p>My life depended on this thing.</p>
<p>So these women, they carried me.</p>
<p>They carried me.</p>
<p>And with time, things are moving forward.</p>
<p>And at some point I went into really, really deep depression</p>
<p>and I went into a very dark place,</p>
<p>even darker than the one I think I came from.</p>
<p>Because by that time I had worked for years</p>
<p>on this company and now some other things was happening.</p>
<p>And around that time, it&rsquo;s also when I was discovering</p>
<p>a lot of what we talked about today,</p>
<p>about what makes a country rich.</p>
<p>And for me to understand that my network,</p>
<p>I was very much into left oriented network.</p>
<p>And to just start to see all of this,</p>
<p>I tried to address it to realize that many of these people</p>
<p>would prefer go running for the hills</p>
<p>than accept for a moment that maybe capitalism</p>
<p>might be part of a solution,</p>
<p>when many of them were involved in capitalism.</p>
<p>So that was a hard time.</p>
<p>At some point I was, yeah,</p>
<p>so many things were happening around that time</p>
<p>that basically shook up everything for me.</p>
<p>One, it&rsquo;s hard to talk about because it&rsquo;s very personal</p>
<p>and the person that I was having a problem with</p>
<p>passed away last year.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m one to always say, leave the dead alone.</p>
<p>So because of that, I won&rsquo;t speak about it,</p>
<p>but there to having a major fallout</p>
<p>with somebody who was like a father figure for me,</p>
<p>somebody that I completely trusted.</p>
<p>And so at some point you just tell, ask yourself,</p>
<p>was my whole life built on a lie, right?</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re confused and then you become confused.</p>
<p>And then at some point you lose 90% of your friends</p>
<p>because of, ideologically speaking, it doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.</p>
<p>Then you just wonder, have I,</p>
<p>have I been asleep this whole time?</p>
<p>And then you start to wonder,</p>
<p>remember when you asked me, who am I?</p>
<p>At some point, Lex, I literally was like a candle</p>
<p>in the wind.</p>
<p>I felt like I was a candle in the wind.</p>
<p>And it was very hard to come back from that.</p>
<p>And people have a hard,</p>
<p>the few people I talk to about this,</p>
<p>they have a hardest time understanding</p>
<p>or even believing it because they&rsquo;re like, you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yes, me.</p>
<p>I used to be a candle in the wind.</p>
<p>What got you out?</p>
<p>What made you overcome that?</p>
<p>My current husband.</p>
<p>Love?</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>See, when I tell you love is the answer.</p>
<p>But him, he came with love,</p>
<p>but he also came with really helping me</p>
<p>figure out the world.</p>
<p>So what Michael, because that&rsquo;s him,</p>
<p>who we&rsquo;re talking about, Michael Strong.</p>
<p>That must be special.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so special.</p>
<p>So you have no idea how special he is.</p>
<p>But you know, Michael, the reason why I have such love,</p>
<p>respect and admiration for my husband,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never say it enough,</p>
<p>is because actually it&rsquo;s one of those relationships</p>
<p>that got built based on intellect first.</p>
<p>You see, at some point I was in the position</p>
<p>where I could start a foundation</p>
<p>after having built my first business.</p>
<p>And all I wanted was an ability to power</p>
<p>as many, especially women,</p>
<p>African women entrepreneurs like me a few years ago,</p>
<p>before then, to do something like I was able to do.</p>
<p>Bring back to the world</p>
<p>some really cool aspects of our culture</p>
<p>built into a really cool brand, 21st century type.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Because the more I could promote women like that</p>
<p>and put steam behind them,</p>
<p>and the more my dream envisioned</p>
<p>for a respected Africa, prosperous Africa would happen,</p>
<p>back then that&rsquo;s what I wanted.</p>
<p>And around me,</p>
<p>this was also part of a whole crisis</p>
<p>of ideologies I had back then.</p>
<p>Everybody was like, well, we should be just doing grants.</p>
<p>And I knew that my people didn&rsquo;t need grants.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t need like a handout.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want your charity.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want charity.</p>
<p>I wanted someone who could work with me on my accounting.</p>
<p>I wanted somebody who could help me brainstorm</p>
<p>marketing wise.</p>
<p>I wanted somebody, or I needed to raise money</p>
<p>to pay my research and development guy</p>
<p>to help me take the juices from my grandma&rsquo;s recipe</p>
<p>to something that can be shelf stable.</p>
<p>I needed coaching.</p>
<p>These are all the things that I needed</p>
<p>to make my dream happen.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want you to give me some crap for free.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I want.</p>
<p>I just want to be able to build my business</p>
<p>with all the things that business building needs.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s what it was needed.</p>
<p>And so Michael, somebody found out about what I was doing</p>
<p>because back in the days of San Francisco,</p>
<p>they would write a lot about me and everything.</p>
<p>And so Michael, along with John Mackey,</p>
<p>the founder of Whole Foods Market,</p>
<p>they had a nonprofit called Flow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all about human flourishing.</p>
<p>They want for people, everybody to get this choice,</p>
<p>this ability to be able to get to a point in their life</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re in complete flow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, Michael, just make high.</p>
<p>Michael is the only one who could say that last name.</p>
<p>But you know, the whole concept of flow,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in a state of flow,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically doing what you&rsquo;re supposed to do,</p>
<p>the way you&rsquo;re supposed to do it</p>
<p>with the people you&rsquo;re supposed to, this whole concept of flow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s human flourishing at its highest.</p>
<p>So, you know, so I meet with this man.</p>
<p>Max, you&rsquo;re so, okay, so we, he finds me, his people find me.</p>
<p>And then there was a program</p>
<p>where it was all about accelerating women entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s during this times</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m starting now to see things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when actually all of this stuff that I noticed,</p>
<p>how come here it takes me all of this time</p>
<p>to start my business, over there it&rsquo;s 20 minutes,</p>
<p>here it&rsquo;s free, over there it&rsquo;s thousands of dollars,</p>
<p>all of this nonsense that I just took,</p>
<p>oh, maybe it&rsquo;s just because we&rsquo;re messed up,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re poor, that&rsquo;s why everything is so messed up.</p>
<p>Whoa, these people are introducing me to concepts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, first of all, I&rsquo;m like, oh, really?</p>
<p>What did you call the doing business in the, what is that?</p>
<p>You know, all of this stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m starting to discover this whole other body of work.</p>
<p>That the free markets, like this thing that I was sensing,</p>
<p>this environment that I was sensing</p>
<p>that it was different around me.</p>
<p>And that they called it the free markets over here.</p>
<p>And over there, that.</p>
<p>And then I started to butt head those ideas</p>
<p>with the ideas that I was fed with before that.</p>
<p>And the evidence won.</p>
<p>And further more than the evidence,</p>
<p>the evidence combined with my lived experience,</p>
<p>it was so powerful.</p>
<p>So I basically started understanding these ideas</p>
<p>from the most visceral part of my body,</p>
<p>you know, of my being.</p>
<p>And it makes sense.</p>
<p>So Michael, Michael helped me find the solution,</p>
<p>the answer to my lifelong little girl&rsquo;s question</p>
<p>of why do they have this and we don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>And how do some countries like mine be poor</p>
<p>while others are rich?</p>
<p>And with understanding all of that,</p>
<p>the greatest, biggest sense of liberation came upon me.</p>
<p>Like, I have no other word to describe that.</p>
<p>True liberation, the liberation that comes from a peer</p>
<p>to finally understand and be vindicated</p>
<p>in your own, you know,</p>
<p>understand in your own deep knowing</p>
<p>or feeling that they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying is not true.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>And when I discovered that, my whole life changed.</p>
<p>So, and since then I have been very serious</p>
<p>about going deeper and deeper and deeper</p>
<p>into my understanding of all of this,</p>
<p>understanding the subtlety.</p>
<p>At some point I was very angry</p>
<p>about the liberators of Africa,</p>
<p>because I was like, yes, you helped liberate us,</p>
<p>but just to keep us in this mirrorism,</p>
<p>I was angry for longest time.</p>
<p>And then eventually you have to engage empathy and love</p>
<p>to put yourself in their shoes</p>
<p>and try to understand the time at which they were living.</p>
<p>And that got me onto a journey</p>
<p>of trying to understand history more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I understood I was able to go beyond</p>
<p>just these liberators and try to understand</p>
<p>and rebuild the world around them</p>
<p>at the macro and also at the macro level.</p>
<p>Just really, you have to try to walk in their shoes.</p>
<p>And from there, finally separate the baby with the bathwater</p>
<p>that they were not able to do back then.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why today, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>but I have no patience for the BLM organizers, founders,</p>
<p>especially the founders.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the organizers think,</p>
<p>but the founders told us what they stand for.</p>
<p>And I say, guys, don&rsquo;t make that same mistake again.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about this,</p>
<p>you cannot make the same mistake.</p>
<p>The liberals of Africa, they have an excuse.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know better.</p>
<p>It was so easy back then to conflate everything.</p>
<p>But today, you, me, anybody alive</p>
<p>cannot with a straight face</p>
<p>embrace Marxist socialist ideas,</p>
<p>especially, especially when they&rsquo;re claiming</p>
<p>that they wanted people to thrive.</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>And I will hold your feet up to the fire on that one.</p>
<p>I will, I will.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>They will give me a lot of grief for this,</p>
<p>but guess what?</p>
<p>I could care less.</p>
<p>Do you know why I could care less?</p>
<p>Because we have an entire population</p>
<p>to help rise out of poverty into prosperity,</p>
<p>where they become co creators,</p>
<p>global co creators of innovation.</p>
<p>And those ideas give you hope for the place you love,</p>
<p>for Senegal, for Africa.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>The world I live in,</p>
<p>the new centers of culture and fashion are in Dakar.</p>
<p>The new centers of tech and, you know,</p>
<p>crypto even is somewhere, maybe Nigeria.</p>
<p>So you see that future, you see that future clearly.</p>
<p>I do, I do, I do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also beautiful to see that the space</p>
<p>of these really powerful ideas</p>
<p>is where you also found love.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So at the intersection.</p>
<p>At the intersection, Michael and I would spend hours</p>
<p>talking about all of these ideas.</p>
<p>And I would be like, but what about this?</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>No, no, no, oh no.</p>
<p>And then hours, every single day for months, Lex.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then from there, our love was born.</p>
<p>Cause I tell people for us,</p>
<p>love is not about looking at each other in the eyes,</p>
<p>like, you know, they all think,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about, we look in one direction.</p>
<p>And in this case, it&rsquo;s this vision,</p>
<p>what we know to be possible and true.</p>
<p>If only you liberate people.</p>
<p>What we know to be true and possible.</p>
<p>We, all of us are miracles walking around.</p>
<p>Every time I get on a plane,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a miracle of engineering.</p>
<p>All the things we&rsquo;re able to do, you know,</p>
<p>now when they do operation on your teeth,</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re able to put the pain down away.</p>
<p>All of this is us.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working on these robots.</p>
<p>This, this, this inside here.</p>
<p>Humans are amazing.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why, and when it works in great tandem</p>
<p>with this guy, these two working together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Watch out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing we can&rsquo;t accomplish.</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing.</p>
<p>Well, God, you&rsquo;re one of the most incredible people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever talked to.</p>
<p>Oh, you say that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re amazing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve met everybody.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>This is truly an honor.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Thank you for the fire that burns within you.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just the passion you have</p>
<p>for a place that&rsquo;s going to, I think,</p>
<p>define the future of humanity.</p>
<p>So thank you for everything you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you to you.</p>
<p>And sometimes I hope this fire doesn&rsquo;t consume me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how much it is.</p>
<p>But I am grateful to you for this.</p>
<p>And yeah, thank you for,</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t do a lot of these, you know,</p>
<p>I am, it&rsquo;s this type of interviews.</p>
<p>Maybe I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m so, so happy.</p>
<p>You mean fun, inspiring, powerful interviews.</p>
<p>Yes, I need to do more of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re amazing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, because at first I was like,</p>
<p>Lex Friedman, really?</p>
<p>Yeah, really?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s this going to go?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, I&rsquo;m going to talk to Lex</p>
<p>and go all crazy.</p>
<p>I think you need to work on your unconscious bias.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All right, thank you, Magat.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the best.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Magat Wade.</p>

<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
