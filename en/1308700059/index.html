    <p>Our card this week is Desiree Michaud, the Queen of Clubs from Connecticut.</p>
<p>In 1984, 18-year-old Desiree was violently killed in a motel room in southeastern Connecticut.</p>
<p>For nearly 40 years, her murder has haunted the community and stumped investigators as</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve chased down every promising lead that&rsquo;s come knocking on their door.</p>
<p>But they have yet to find the answers they need to crack this case.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I&rsquo;m on the road this week, bringing my investigation of a deck</p>
<p>case to a live audience.</p>
<p>So this week, we have a special guest host.</p>
<p>This is Kylie Lowe, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was still dark outside in Groton, Connecticut, when Detective John Graves was suddenly awakened</p>
<p>by a phone call.</p>
<p>According to the day, it was barely 4 a.m. on Saturday, April 7, 1984, so he was a bit</p>
<p>confused about who would be calling and why, but he answered anyway.</p>
<p>Detective Graves was instructed to respond right away to a local motel.</p>
<p>The young woman had been found murdered.</p>
<p>Graves booked it to the flagship motel, and there, in room 114, Graves and several other</p>
<p>investigators began processing the scene.</p>
<p>The woman was sprawled out on the bed, nude, with a radio cord wrapped around her neck</p>
<p>and what appeared to be some kind of stab wound or puncture wound on her chest.</p>
<p>Throughout the small room, there were clothes, drink bottles, and food containers scattered</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>It looked like someone had been staying there for a few days.</p>
<p>While investigators kept combing through the room, looking for evidence to collect, other</p>
<p>detectives were interviewing the man who had discovered the crime scene, George Harris,</p>
<p>who went by Angel.</p>
<p>He was in his late 20s and identified himself as the renter of the room and the woman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>boyfriend.</p>
<p>He was clearly shaken up about everything, but he did his best to tell them what he could.</p>
<p>He said his girlfriend&rsquo;s name was Desiree Michaud, and she was only 18 years old.</p>
<p>He found her lifeless body in their room just before 4 a.m.</p>
<p>According to Susan Zakin&rsquo;s reporting for the day, when George entered their room, he</p>
<p>initially thought his girlfriend was sleeping, but then he saw the cord around her neck and</p>
<p>knew something was wrong, so he immediately ran to the front desk clerk and asked them</p>
<p>to contact authorities.</p>
<p>George explained to the investigators that the last time he saw Desiree alive was just</p>
<p>a matter of hours before that.</p>
<p>He said it was just before 10 p.m. when he saw her walking down the street in the little</p>
<p>town just across the river from the motel, New London.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually where she spent most of her time, because she was a sex worker there and</p>
<p>often worked an area called Bank Street, which was well-known to police at the time.</p>
<p>George gave investigators the names of some other sex workers he knew Desiree was close</p>
<p>with, who might have more information about where she was last night, what she was doing,</p>
<p>and most importantly, who she was with.</p>
<p>But before seeking those individuals out, police did a thorough canvas of the motel,</p>
<p>and there was just one guest in particular who said something that caught investigators</p>
<p>attention.</p>
<p>The woman who had been staying in room 113 said she called the front desk around 1 a.m.</p>
<p>because irate voices and lots of commotion were keeping her up.</p>
<p>She thought it was coming from room 114, but she couldn&rsquo;t be sure.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Sergeant Heather Beauchamp, who&rsquo;s on Desiree&rsquo;s case today.</p>
<p>The front desk tried to call Desiree&rsquo;s room and got no answer.</p>
<p>So number one, okay, was Desiree in the room at that time?</p>
<p>Number two, was she already deceased and couldn&rsquo;t answer the phone?</p>
<p>Number three, they didn&rsquo;t really go down to the room to check on anything.</p>
<p>No one called the police.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all it was, was a call to the front desk.</p>
<p>As investigators continued talking with other guests at the motel, they began to question</p>
<p>if that woman really heard those noises from room 114, or if they were coming from somewhere</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>There were multiple parties going on.</p>
<p>There was a party with high school kids, it was a party with Navy kids.</p>
<p>So to determine exactly what noise that this lady heard to spark her to call the front</p>
<p>desk was never really determined what the noise was and where it was coming from.</p>
<p>Whether what that lady heard was relevant or not was kind of a toss up.</p>
<p>But there was something a few guests saw that police definitely thought was important.</p>
<p>Apparently, several guests had seen a man standing outside of room 114 that night.</p>
<p>He stood out because supposedly he was dressed up like a cowboy, like faded blue jeans, plaid</p>
<p>shirt, a western jacket, cowboy boots, a cowboy hat, and a bandana.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking the full getup.</p>
<p>Investigators asked one of the guests who had seen this man to work with a sketch artist</p>
<p>to create a composite.</p>
<p>But the person&rsquo;s memory of the guy&rsquo;s face was fuzzy at best.</p>
<p>So the artist ended up making two separate renderings of the man, and both were distributed</p>
<p>to local newspapers.</p>
<p>After clearing the crime scene and completing the canvas, investigators tracked down some</p>
<p>of Desiree&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>The people they found said that they had seen Desiree in New London a couple of times the</p>
<p>night before on Bank Street.</p>
<p>So that area of New London, Bank Street, was very prominent for nightlife.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the portion of New London, the downtown portion of New London, where all the bars</p>
<p>are and clubs and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So back then it was the same.</p>
<p>So it was also a prominent area for drugs, prostitution.</p>
<p>The last sighting of her was around 11 that night, when she and her friends went to a</p>
<p>house party in New London.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear whose house party that was, but the friends said they didn&rsquo;t see Desiree</p>
<p>after that, and they had no idea how she got from the house party to the motel.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have anybody who&rsquo;s able to say, or we saw her get dropped off, or we saw her</p>
<p>get out of a car, or we saw her walking back, or we saw her getting out of a cab, or we</p>
<p>saw her walking into the room with somebody.</p>
<p>Nothing about her getting back.</p>
<p>Desiree&rsquo;s friends said that even though she was young, she was smart about her business.</p>
<p>She knew sex work was dangerous, so she was pretty careful about the clients she took.</p>
<p>She definitely kept to a strict client base, per se.</p>
<p>She definitely had her own people, and she would stick to that.</p>
<p>So I feel like she, through the investigation, that she would take means to keep herself</p>
<p>as safe as she could.</p>
<p>It would be random for her to, you know, get in the car with someone completely that she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know, or not have her friends with her, and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So they definitely stuck close.</p>
<p>From Desiree&rsquo;s friends, investigators got a list of all her usual clients, about half</p>
<p>a dozen men.</p>
<p>Police identified and interviewed them, and it seems like none of them were found suspicious,</p>
<p>because it appears they kind of just moved on with their investigation without really</p>
<p>zeroing in on any one of them in particular.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if some of the clients remained persons of interest, and investigators just</p>
<p>decided to pursue other leads.</p>
<p>Sergeant Beauchamp was staying tight-lipped about it, but she did say they were never</p>
<p>sure if they truly located all of her clients.</p>
<p>Staying with friends and conducting interviews weren&rsquo;t the only things investigators did</p>
<p>during the early parts of the investigation.</p>
<p>They also poured over the records on Desiree.</p>
<p>They had quite a few.</p>
<p>Desiree first appeared on law enforcement&rsquo;s radar when she was just 13 years old.</p>
<p>From then until age 18, she was arrested 13 times on various charges, including charges</p>
<p>related to sex work.</p>
<p>The first arrest for this came when she was 16, which it&rsquo;s worth noting that in today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>world, we know better than that.</p>
<p>A 16-year-old can&rsquo;t be arrested for sex work because they&rsquo;re not an adult, which</p>
<p>obviously means they can&rsquo;t consent, which means they&rsquo;re a victim of sex trafficking.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the only thing Desiree had fallen victim to in her short life.</p>
<p>At the same age, Desiree reported a violent sexual assault to the New London Police Department.</p>
<p>She told them that she was kidnapped at gunpoint, driven to a nearby town, and sexually assaulted</p>
<p>by a 24-year-old man who we&rsquo;ll call Sonny.</p>
<p>A month and a half later, Sonny was actually charged with the crime, and it went to trial.</p>
<p>In our research, it wasn&rsquo;t clear if Desiree testified at the trial or not.</p>
<p>I mean, she was incarcerated at the time, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean she couldn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Regardless though, Sonny was ultimately acquitted by the jury.</p>
<p>Of course, this stuck out like a sore thumb to police.</p>
<p>Of all people, it seemed like Sonny would have a motive for killing Desiree.</p>
<p>Even though he was found not guilty, it wasn&rsquo;t an unreasonable assumption to make that he</p>
<p>probably still harbored some kind of anger for the girl who accused him.</p>
<p>Investigators found Sonny, talked with him, and determined he simply wasn&rsquo;t a viable suspect.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why or how they determined that, and investigators today aren&rsquo;t sure either.</p>
<p>But I have to imagine there was something solid to make him fall off the suspect list.</p>
<p>Like an airtight alibi, or maybe they just got interested in another potential suspect.</p>
<p>Because right about this time, they started looking hard at someone who had been right</p>
<p>in front of them all along.</p>
<p>The boyfriend, George.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like police were looking at George because they found his story fishy or anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just there were a number of things about him that are traditionally viewed as suspicious.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s the one who found her dead, she was found in a room that was rented by</p>
<p>him, and he was her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Investigators asked George to submit to a polygraph, which he agreed to and ultimately</p>
<p>passed.</p>
<p>Although that didn&rsquo;t automatically remove George from their radar, I would say it definitely</p>
<p>calmed the suspicion surrounding him, and once again, the investigation moved on.</p>
<p>By April 9th, Desiree&rsquo;s autopsy was completed, and the medical examiner found her cause of</p>
<p>death to be asphyxia by strangulation.</p>
<p>But get this, for some reason, the examiner didn&rsquo;t do any kind of testing to determine</p>
<p>if Desiree had been sexually assaulted by her attacker.</p>
<p>Like, they didn&rsquo;t collect vaginal swabs or anything.</p>
<p>Of course, given how Desiree was found, this decision is something that leaves present-day</p>
<p>investigators dumbfounded.</p>
<p>I wondered too, you know, why wasn&rsquo;t, why, what&rsquo;s it gonna hurt, you know?</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t done.</p>
<p>Sergeant Beauchamp said that her best guess is that because Desiree was a sex worker,</p>
<p>maybe authorities figured if they did find evidence of a sexual encounter, they wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if it was consensual or not.</p>
<p>But why not collect it just in case?</p>
<p>Giving them the benefit of the doubt, this was 1984.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have all the DNA technology that we have nowadays, but still, even for</p>
<p>the 80s, this seems like a huge misstep.</p>
<p>I think maybe today it would have been different, but you can&rsquo;t go back and say they should</p>
<p>or shouldn&rsquo;t have done this, you know?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working with what they were working with at the time.</p>
<p>The world I grew up in as a police officer is very different than the world that police</p>
<p>officers grew up in in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.</p>
<p>So the way my mind may work is different than the way their minds may work in the sense</p>
<p>that I have more to work with, just like technology, forensic science, you know, the developments</p>
<p>in forensic science, phones, cameras, you know, there&rsquo;s just an abundance of stuff now</p>
<p>that I have at my fingertips that they didn&rsquo;t have at the time.</p>
<p>Investigators were now a few days removed from the murder, and there was one person</p>
<p>both police and the local media were leaning into hard.</p>
<p>The mystery man supposedly seen outside of Desiree&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Seriously, almost every news story mentioned the man who was dressed in western attire,</p>
<p>saying that he was wanted for questioning as a witness or possible suspect, and the</p>
<p>two different composite drawings the sketch artist completed were circulating like mad</p>
<p>around town.</p>
<p>You might be thinking what I thought when I heard this.</p>
<p>How hard could it possibly be to find a suspicious-looking man dressed as a cowboy on the East Coast?</p>
<p>But Sergeant Beauchamp said cowboys in Groton aren&rsquo;t as far and few between as you might</p>
<p>think.</p>
<p>Now, take into consideration we are in a Navy town with a lot of people who dress in cowboy</p>
<p>boots and cowboy hats.</p>
<p>She told our reporting team that it was almost a trend back then to dress like that.</p>
<p>So even though a lead like that today might be easier to go off, in the 1980s in Groton,</p>
<p>it was like trying to find a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, though, nearly a week into the investigation, police announced that they</p>
<p>had found that needle.</p>
<p>According to reporting from the day, investigators wouldn&rsquo;t give up the man&rsquo;s identity or</p>
<p>disclose how they found him, they just said that they found him and were questioning him.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that after newspapers reported about this guy that investigators</p>
<p>made a huge deal about finally finding, investigators just kind of went, meh, we cleared him.</p>
<p>And everything about the mystery cowboy dropped out of the media coverage.</p>
<p>We asked Sergeant Beauchamp if anything ever materialized from finding the man and interviewing</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>And what she said was surprising.</p>
<p>The cowboy was never really identified.</p>
<p>There was a few people that we could track down and say, oh yes, this guy dresses like</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>But to say that was definitely the guy, I was never positive about that.</p>
<p>So basically, the cowboy they interviewed may not have been the cowboy.</p>
<p>For all they knew, he was just some other guy who was a fan of Western attire.</p>
<p>Sergeant Beauchamp said that to this day, she&rsquo;s not convinced the cowboy lead was anything</p>
<p>from the get-go.</p>
<p>I mean, we know there was at least one party going on at the motel the night Desiree was</p>
<p>killed and there were plenty of people at the party.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible the cowboy who was seen was just a partygoer who others mistakenly</p>
<p>remembered standing in front of room 114.</p>
<p>Whoever he was, if he even existed, we may never know.</p>
<p>Because just as quickly as the cowboy fell out of the media coverage, he dropped off</p>
<p>investigators&rsquo; radar as a dead-end lead.</p>
<p>Sergeant Beauchamp said she doesn&rsquo;t blame investigators at the time for making such</p>
<p>a fuss about the cowboy because they were just working with what they had.</p>
<p>But back then, you have to think, when you get a lead like that in 1984, your best outlet</p>
<p>is media.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have social media, so you&rsquo;re looking at the newspaper to get out whatever you can.</p>
<p>You give the newspaper a little bit of information and they&rsquo;re going to put it all over the place.</p>
<p>So yeah, the cowboy was a very important thing and it was gone.</p>
<p>With their once-promising cowboy lead left in the dust, investigators decided to move</p>
<p>on to another lead from the motel.</p>
<p>The woman from 113, who reported hearing irate voices the night Desiree was killed.</p>
<p>But there was one problem.</p>
<p>She already told them everything she could remember about the night and the noises she</p>
<p>heard.</p>
<p>So police chose to do something a bit unconventional, hypnosis.</p>
<p>According to the day&rsquo;s podcast, Case Unsolved, this is how it went.</p>
<p>After hypnosis, the woman recounted that she heard a man and a lady arguing, possibly</p>
<p>two men, but definitely at least one man and one lady.</p>
<p>The lady sounded super angry and was shouting at the man, like high-pitched short screams,</p>
<p>not surprised screams, but scared shrieks.</p>
<p>And then there was a thumping, as if something had been thrown.</p>
<p>The woman told the hypnotist, quote,</p>
<p>Sounds like a body being thrown, as opposed to an object.</p>
<p>Not a body, but a person.</p>
<p>Because an object has a hollow sound, and a body makes a bump, end quote.</p>
<p>She said the noises sounded violent and frightened her so much that she called the front desk.</p>
<p>After talking with the front desk, she heard the phone ring in the same room where the</p>
<p>noise was coming from, and then everything quieted down.</p>
<p>So she figured she was wrong and it was just bickering between spouses or something.</p>
<p>She can hear a voice and it&rsquo;s very detailed, but then, you know, when you come down to</p>
<p>law enforcement and trying to solve a homicide, you can&rsquo;t, you know, how far can you take</p>
<p>a hypnotism?</p>
<p>So she was detailed.</p>
<p>You can never differentiate what a hypnotism is.</p>
<p>Is it from something that already happened to this person?</p>
<p>Assuming that the woman&rsquo;s recollection was indeed from the motel the night Desiree was</p>
<p>killed, though, it was certainly helpful for police.</p>
<p>Even though she didn&rsquo;t know who the voices were, the scene she described didn&rsquo;t sound</p>
<p>like a random attack from a stranger or even a new client.</p>
<p>With how she described the voices, it almost seemed like it was two people who knew each</p>
<p>other arguing.</p>
<p>When you also think two people having an argument, now, again, with her line of work, it makes</p>
<p>it tough, right?</p>
<p>Could be arguing over money, it could be arguing over whatever, but it makes it more like you</p>
<p>know that person, you&rsquo;re arguing over something.</p>
<p>Again, this information was great to have, but investigators were still scrambling for</p>
<p>viable suspects.</p>
<p>The more time that passed with no arrests, the more rumors began flying around town about</p>
<p>who was responsible.</p>
<p>Gossip flooded the streets of Groton and New London with tales about how Desiree was killed</p>
<p>by a man who owned a houseboat.</p>
<p>Investigators thought she was murdered by a relative of Sonny&rsquo;s, and many still clung</p>
<p>to the whole cowboy thing.</p>
<p>And of course, after the arrest of Connecticut serial killer Michael Ross in June of 1984,</p>
<p>many people speculated that he was possibly responsible for Desiree&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with him, Ross murdered eight females who were between the ages of</p>
<p>14 and 25 in Connecticut and New York between 1981 and 1984.</p>
<p>The murders were random, and he sexually assaulted and strangled his victims.</p>
<p>Sergeant Beauchamp said the theory wasn&rsquo;t taken super seriously.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not 100% sure why, but perhaps it&rsquo;s because Desiree&rsquo;s murder didn&rsquo;t completely</p>
<p>fit his M.O., or maybe because of the argument the woman in room 113 heard.</p>
<p>As the rumor mill continued, Desiree&rsquo;s friends and other local sex workers called in tips</p>
<p>to police about clients of theirs who&rsquo;d been violent, thinking maybe they were responsible.</p>
<p>But none of those leads materialized into anything.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Desiree&rsquo;s case to go cold, but her story hardly slipped from</p>
<p>the minds of the community.</p>
<p>She was remembered for being a talented artist who showed an abundance of promise with her</p>
<p>murals and paintings.</p>
<p>Friends recalled how Desiree&rsquo;s paintings belonged in a museum, and they all knew she had a bright</p>
<p>artistic future ahead of her.</p>
<p>At least, that&rsquo;s how it was supposed to be.</p>
<p>Desiree&rsquo;s death had a big impact on the art community in Groton and New London, leading</p>
<p>to other local artists to create art pieces, and even a play, in part inspired by her.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that caught the public&rsquo;s attention about Desiree&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>was that she didn&rsquo;t fit into the box society had created for sex workers at the time.</p>
<p>She was always conservatively dressed.</p>
<p>All of her friends at the time when we spoke to them said that she was a great person,</p>
<p>great friend, would never hurt anybody.</p>
<p>She was viewed as a nice young woman who&rsquo;d just been dealt an awful hand in life.</p>
<p>A piece published by the day, on the one-year anniversary of Desiree&rsquo;s death, detailed</p>
<p>the circumstances of her childhood, like how both of her parents were arrested before she</p>
<p>turned two.</p>
<p>After some run-ins with the law throughout her teen years, she dropped out of high school</p>
<p>at the age of 16, and that&rsquo;s when she was trafficked.</p>
<p>It was widely known among Desiree&rsquo;s friends that she didn&rsquo;t want to stay on the streets</p>
<p>of New London or Groton forever.</p>
<p>She had big plans to save up some money to move to Chicago or maybe Canada, somewhere</p>
<p>away from it all.</p>
<p>She dreamt of taking up a career in dancing or modeling, both dreams she never got the</p>
<p>chance to follow through with.</p>
<p>Despite the community&rsquo;s desire to see Desiree&rsquo;s case solved, the investigation lost steam.</p>
<p>The tips that were once flooding in were long dried up.</p>
<p>So Desiree&rsquo;s case sat there, collecting dust for years, until 2010, when the newly</p>
<p>formed Southeastern Connecticut Cold Case Unit decided they&rsquo;d take another crack</p>
<p>at it to see if there were any items of evidence that could be sent for DNA testing, or if</p>
<p>there was anything investigators missed back in the day.</p>
<p>We would read the whole case, we would go over evidence.</p>
<p>So when we did, we had somebody at our state lab assigned to the Cold Case Unit.</p>
<p>So when you have 100, 200 pieces of evidence, you can sit down with a forensic examiner</p>
<p>at the lab and say, what do you think, by looking at the lab results, would be our best</p>
<p>evidence to resubmit for testing.</p>
<p>Sergeant Beauchamp said this was not a simple process.</p>
<p>Like she mentioned, they had so much evidence, but again, the crime scene was a messy motel</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>It was difficult or maybe impossible to know which of the things would have the killer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>DNA on them, and which were there before the crime, and entirely unrelated to the murderer.</p>
<p>Now you may be developing profiles of somebody who was there before Desiree was there.</p>
<p>So, you know, in that sense, you also don&rsquo;t want to deflect your case by developing profiles</p>
<p>that are unrelated to your case, which is another roadblock we ran into with this case.</p>
<p>I mean, if something happens at someone&rsquo;s home, your sheets are your sheets, your blankets</p>
<p>are your blankets.</p>
<p>They ended up selecting about 15 items from evidence to test.</p>
<p>And while those were being tested, the cold case unit dove headfirst into revamping the</p>
<p>investigation.</p>
<p>They tried to track down key people, but the New London Groton area was a pretty transient</p>
<p>region.</p>
<p>Remember, there&rsquo;s a naval base there, so people would come and go back then, and many of Desiree&rsquo;s</p>
<p>friends were sex workers who weren&rsquo;t anchored to that area either.</p>
<p>So finding the people they wanted to speak with all these years later proved to be a</p>
<p>challenge.</p>
<p>We tried to stick in our investigation to the closest people to Desiree.</p>
<p>Her closest friends, you know, who now are kind of scattered around, and the people who</p>
<p>came forth and said they did see her on Bank Street that night.</p>
<p>We talked to them.</p>
<p>Where did you see her?</p>
<p>What time?</p>
<p>Where did you see her?</p>
<p>What time?</p>
<p>Where did you see her?</p>
<p>What time?</p>
<p>Because, again, they&rsquo;re just constantly moving, constantly moving.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t, she was at this place for five hours and then went home.</p>
<p>Nope, she was seen here.</p>
<p>She was seen here.</p>
<p>She was seen here.</p>
<p>One of the people they were able to track down and talk to again was George, and his</p>
<p>story hadn&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>Even 30-something years later, Sergeant Beauchamp said he still seemed genuinely upset about</p>
<p>Desiree&rsquo;s murder, and he was still just as cooperative as he was on day one, further</p>
<p>solidifying the theory that he wasn&rsquo;t involved in her murder.</p>
<p>After the Cold Case Unit revisited Desiree&rsquo;s case, there was another few years again where</p>
<p>there was little movement.</p>
<p>And when the unit was disbanded in 2016 due to lack of funding, I&rsquo;m sure there were fears</p>
<p>that the investigation was permanently halted.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>Sergeant Beauchamp stayed on Desiree&rsquo;s case, ready to follow up any tip that she received.</p>
<p>And a few tips did trickle in, like one in Texas from 2017 that she actually ended up</p>
<p>going in person to investigate the following spring.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t elaborate on what the lead was, but she told Case Unsolved that she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;ll be what ends up cracking the case.</p>
<p>And those tips were the last ones that police have received in Desiree&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Although neither of the tips amounted to anything, it was encouraging to know people were still</p>
<p>thinking about Desiree and wanting to help.</p>
<p>And in the end, Sergeant Beauchamp knows that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to close the case for good.</p>
<p>People coming forward with information they&rsquo;ve kept quiet for nearly four decades.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t many people that knew she was there.</p>
<p>I feel like everybody knows about a homicide, other than who did it.</p>
<p>I always feel like somebody else knows besides the person.</p>
<p>Will that person ever come forward?</p>
<p>You just hope that something will break or you&rsquo;ll get that call.</p>
<p>Desiree had big dreams for her future when someone selfishly decided to end her life</p>
<p>in 1984.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 40 years with no justice for her and no answers for her loved ones.</p>
<p>So please, if you know anything about the murder of 18-year-old Desiree Michaud on April</p>
<p>7th, 1984, please call the Groton Town Police Department at 860-441-6712.</p>
