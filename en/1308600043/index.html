    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are talking all about food and the brain.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about foods</p>
<p>that are good for your brain in terms of focus,</p>
<p>in terms of brain health generally,</p>
<p>and the longevity of your brain,</p>
<p>your ability to maintain cognition</p>
<p>and clear thinking over time.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about</p>
<p>why and how you prefer certain foods to others.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to talk about the three major signals</p>
<p>that combine to drive your food choices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a little hint of what those are.</p>
<p>One of those signals comes from your gut</p>
<p>and is completely subconscious.</p>
<p>This is not the gut microbiome per se.</p>
<p>These are neurons in your gut</p>
<p>that are sending signals to your brain</p>
<p>that you are unaware of about the nutrient contents</p>
<p>of the foods that you&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>The second signal is how metabolically accessible</p>
<p>a given food is,</p>
<p>meaning how readily that food can be converted into energy</p>
<p>that your brain, not your body,</p>
<p>but that your brain can use.</p>
<p>And the third signal is perhaps the most interesting one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the signal of belief.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the signal of what you perceive and believe</p>
<p>the food that you&rsquo;re eating to contain</p>
<p>and what you think it can do for you</p>
<p>health-wise and energy-wise.</p>
<p>And that might sound a little wishy-washy or vague,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going to provide mechanistic data</p>
<p>to support the fact that you can change what you eat</p>
<p>so much so that you can drive your brain and your body</p>
<p>to crave foods that are good for you,</p>
<p>or at least better for you</p>
<p>than the foods you might currently be eating.</p>
<p>This is an incredibly powerful mechanism that we all have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that I think is very underappreciated.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;m going to review the data</p>
<p>from both animal models and fortunately more recently,</p>
<p>human studies that really do underscore the fact</p>
<p>that you can control your desire for particular foods.</p>
<p>Before we dive into today&rsquo;s topic,</p>
<p>I just want to briefly touch on some key takeaways</p>
<p>from a previous episode,</p>
<p>which is the episode on time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>also called intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>The key elements of time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>that will benefit your health the most</p>
<p>in terms of weight loss or maintenance, fat loss,</p>
<p>organ health, quality sleep, and cognition</p>
<p>are that the feeding window begin</p>
<p>at least one hour after waking.</p>
<p>You could push that feeding window out to begin later,</p>
<p>but at least one hour after waking,</p>
<p>and that it end at least two and ideally three hours</p>
<p>before going to sleep.</p>
<p>Some people can end that feeding window</p>
<p>much further away from the beginning of sleep,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re finishing their last bite of food,</p>
<p>for instance, at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not going to sleep until midnight,</p>
<p>but many people struggle to get quality sleep</p>
<p>if that feeding window is set too early</p>
<p>relative to when they go to sleep.</p>
<p>So begin the feeding window at least one hour after waking,</p>
<p>end the feeding window at least two hours</p>
<p>before going to sleep.</p>
<p>And a key feature based on the scientific research</p>
<p>is that the feeding window itself fall more or less</p>
<p>at the same period of each 24-hour day from day to day,</p>
<p>meaning if you are going to eat over an eight-hour period,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your feeding window,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t want to start that feeding window</p>
<p>at 10 a.m. one day and end it at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>and then the next day start at noon</p>
<p>and end it at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>and the next day started at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>and ended at 10 p.m. and so forth.</p>
<p>As much as is reasonably possible,</p>
<p>if you want to extract the maximum benefit</p>
<p>from time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>the idea is to keep that feeding window</p>
<p>at more or less the same phase,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called, of each 24-hour day.</p>
<p>If it slides around a little bit for social reasons</p>
<p>or whatever reasons, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a big deal,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want it sliding around</p>
<p>by many hours from day to day</p>
<p>because of the way that that feeding window</p>
<p>impacts other genes called clock genes</p>
<p>that regulate a bunch of other processes in the body.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3,</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise.</p>
<p>Our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Some of the most frequent questions I get</p>
<p>are about food and the brain.</p>
<p>Everybody seems to want to know what they should eat</p>
<p>and what they shouldn&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>in order to have peak brain function,</p>
<p>to be able to focus and memorize things and so forth,</p>
<p>and in order to maintain brain health over time,</p>
<p>because nobody wants to lose their memory</p>
<p>or have troubles with cognition.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a lot of data now</p>
<p>from really good quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that indicate certain things that we can do,</p>
<p>including certain foods that we should eat,</p>
<p>and perhaps even some foods that we should avoid</p>
<p>in order to enhance our brain function.</p>
<p>And of course, when I say brain,</p>
<p>what I really mean is nervous system function,</p>
<p>because how we are able to move and remember things,</p>
<p>et cetera, doesn&rsquo;t just depend on the neurons,</p>
<p>the nerve cells that are in our head,</p>
<p>it also depends on our spinal cord</p>
<p>and the neurons that connect to all the organs of our body.</p>
<p>So in general, there are two categories of things</p>
<p>that are going to improve brain health</p>
<p>from the perspective of nutrition.</p>
<p>The first category is the general category</p>
<p>of things that we eat and avoid,</p>
<p>and things that we do and avoid doing</p>
<p>that will modulate brain health and function.</p>
<p>What do I mean by modulate?</p>
<p>Well, getting quality sleep on a regular basis,</p>
<p>making sure that you&rsquo;re socially connected,</p>
<p>making sure that you&rsquo;re not depressed.</p>
<p>All these things are vitally important</p>
<p>to our overall health.</p>
<p>And of course they will impact brain function,</p>
<p>but they do it more or less indirectly, okay?</p>
<p>There are a few things that happen in sleep</p>
<p>which directly benefit brain function and repair, et cetera.</p>
<p>But today I really want to concentrate</p>
<p>not on the things that modulate our overall health,</p>
<p>but rather the things that mediate brain health directly.</p>
<p>And in particular, how certain foods</p>
<p>enhance brain function.</p>
<p>And we are going to talk about</p>
<p>how we can change our relationship to food,</p>
<p>literally how we can start to prefer certain foods</p>
<p>that are better for us than others.</p>
<p>So just briefly, I want to touch on the modulatory components</p>
<p>because they are vital.</p>
<p>First of all, getting quality sleep on a regular basis</p>
<p>and ample sleep on a regular basis</p>
<p>is the foundation of all mental health and physical health.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question about that.</p>
<p>We have done several episodes,</p>
<p>including the Master Your Sleep episode,</p>
<p>which is episode two of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done a lot of other episodes</p>
<p>that are all about sleep and how to get better at sleeping.</p>
<p>So I just want to make crystal clear</p>
<p>that unless you&rsquo;re sleeping well on a regular basis,</p>
<p>your brain will suffer.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t be able to focus very well, learn very well.</p>
<p>And indeed there are data linking poor quality sleep</p>
<p>to dementia or at least exacerbating preexisting dementias</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So get your sleep in order.</p>
<p>The other of course is cardiovascular health and exercise.</p>
<p>The general prescription that&rsquo;s out there in the literature</p>
<p>and I think is well-supported</p>
<p>is to get somewhere between 150 and 180 minutes</p>
<p>of cardiovascular exercise per week.</p>
<p>If you choose to also use resistance exercise, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But the 150 to 180 minutes minimum per week</p>
<p>of cardiovascular exercise is crucial for heart health</p>
<p>and heart health directly relates to brain health</p>
<p>because the brain consumes a lot of oxygen, glucose</p>
<p>and other factors that are delivered via the blood.</p>
<p>So if your arteries are clogged up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got poor vascular supply to the brain</p>
<p>in any region of the brain, your brain will suffer.</p>
<p>So get cardiovascular health in order.</p>
<p>Now with those two modulatory elements set forth</p>
<p>so that we&rsquo;re all aware that they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>and they are vitally important.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to turn to the elements that have been shown</p>
<p>to be vitally important for directly controlling,</p>
<p>for mediating neuron function.</p>
<p>Neurons, of course, are nerve cells in the brain</p>
<p>and there are other cell types too, of course,</p>
<p>that will impact brain function.</p>
<p>The most prominent of which are the so-called glia.</p>
<p>Glia means glue, but even though for a long time</p>
<p>people thought that these cells</p>
<p>were just kind of holding things together passively,</p>
<p>the glia play a very active role</p>
<p>in the metabolism neurons in brain function</p>
<p>and probably also in cognition, in thinking and so forth.</p>
<p>So what are the things that directly impact brain health</p>
<p>and what are the foods that we can eat</p>
<p>that will support brain health?</p>
<p>Generally, when we think about neuron function</p>
<p>and brain function, we default to a discussion about fuel.</p>
<p>The fact that neurons use glucose, which is blood sugar</p>
<p>in order and that they require a lot of it.</p>
<p>In some cases, they&rsquo;ll use ketones,</p>
<p>which we will talk about a little bit later,</p>
<p>especially in people that are following a low carbohydrate</p>
<p>or ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>But before we can even consider the fuels</p>
<p>that neurons use in order to function,</p>
<p>we have to talk about the elements</p>
<p>that actually allow those neurons to be there</p>
<p>and to stay healthy, what actually makes up those neurons.</p>
<p>And that brings us to what I would argue</p>
<p>is the most important food element for brain function,</p>
<p>and that is fat.</p>
<p>And that might come as a surprise,</p>
<p>but unless one considers the water content of the brain,</p>
<p>which is very high, a lot of our brain</p>
<p>and a lot of the integrity of the nerve cells,</p>
<p>the so-called neurons in our brain,</p>
<p>and the other types of cells comes from fat.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because nerve cells and other cells in the brain</p>
<p>have a external layer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s sometimes called a double layered membrane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially two thin layers</p>
<p>that serve as a boundary between those cells.</p>
<p>And that boundary is very important</p>
<p>because how things pass across that boundary</p>
<p>actually regulates the electrical activity of neurons,</p>
<p>which is the way that neurons fire and communicate</p>
<p>and keep you thinking and acting</p>
<p>and doing all the good things</p>
<p>that those neurons allow us to do.</p>
<p>And those membranes are made up of fats,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not made up of the fats that are</p>
<p>around our belly, around the other organs of our body.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not made up of storage fat.</p>
<p>They are made up of structural fat</p>
<p>and maintaining the so-called integrity</p>
<p>of that structural fat,</p>
<p>meaning the health of those neurons</p>
<p>is going to come in large part from the foods that we eat.</p>
<p>Now, this needs to be underscored.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that the foods that we eat</p>
<p>actually provide the structural basis,</p>
<p>the building blocks of the very neurons</p>
<p>that allow us to think over time.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the fat that makes up those neurons and other nerve cells</p>
<p>is different than the other types of fat in the body.</p>
<p>So what type of fat is it?</p>
<p>And what should we eat in order to support</p>
<p>that fat and those neurons?</p>
<p>And the answer is the so-called essential fatty acids</p>
<p>and phospholipids.</p>
<p>Now, those are more or less the same thing,</p>
<p>but I just want to make a very large literature,</p>
<p>very crystal clear.</p>
<p>Essential fatty acids can include the so-called EPA variety</p>
<p>or DHA variety.</p>
<p>You hear about omega-3s and omega-6s.</p>
<p>Most people are getting enough omega-6s from their diet.</p>
<p>Not everybody, but most people are getting enough omega-6s.</p>
<p>However, most people are not getting enough omega-3s</p>
<p>in their diet to support healthy brain function</p>
<p>in the short and long-term.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about the benefits</p>
<p>of elevating the levels of omega-3s</p>
<p>in one&rsquo;s diet for sake of offsetting depression</p>
<p>and for enhancing mood.</p>
<p>And indeed, there&rsquo;s a wealth of literature now</p>
<p>pointing to the fact that ingesting at least one or two</p>
<p>or even three grams per day of EPA form</p>
<p>of essential fatty acid can have positive effects</p>
<p>on mood and wellbeing that are at least on par</p>
<p>with some of the major antidepressant treatments out there,</p>
<p>but without similar side effects</p>
<p>to those antidepressant treatments.</p>
<p>And that for people that are already taking antidepressants,</p>
<p>that supplementing with one to two to three grams of EPA,</p>
<p>essential fatty acids can actually allow a lower dose</p>
<p>of antidepressant treatment to be used</p>
<p>and still be effective.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s depression, but just in terms of maintaining</p>
<p>normal cognitive function in people that aren&rsquo;t depressed,</p>
<p>the EPAs and omega-3s seem to play a very important role.</p>
<p>Of course, you can supplement EPAs</p>
<p>through various fish oils and it could be liquid fish oil</p>
<p>or capsule fish oil.</p>
<p>Some people, if they&rsquo;re not interested in eating fish</p>
<p>for whatever reason, they&rsquo;re allergic or for ethical reasons,</p>
<p>they can take krill oil.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t want to use krill oil,</p>
<p>they can use algae and other forms of EPA.</p>
<p>However, I think it&rsquo;s clear that one can get a lot of EPA</p>
<p>from the proper foods.</p>
<p>And it turns out that those foods, not surprisingly,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t just contain high levels of EPA,</p>
<p>but they also contain other things</p>
<p>that are beneficial for brain health.</p>
<p>So what are foods that are high in omega-3s</p>
<p>that we should all probably be consuming,</p>
<p>at least on a daily basis?</p>
<p>The number one is fish.</p>
<p>So things like mackerel and salmon and herring and oysters</p>
<p>and sardines and anchovies,</p>
<p>and perhaps the heavyweight champion</p>
<p>of EPAs per unit volume is caviar.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t know about you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not eating a lot of fish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not eating a lot of caviar.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I can&rsquo;t remember the last time</p>
<p>I had a caviar unless it was sprinkled</p>
<p>on a little bit of sushi.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fish eater personally.</p>
<p>I will from time to time,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one reason why one might want to supplement</p>
<p>with EPAs from another source.</p>
<p>But also EPAs are found in chia seeds and walnuts</p>
<p>and soybeans and other plant-based foods.</p>
<p>You can look these up online and you&rsquo;ll immediately see</p>
<p>that there are a lot of sources of EPAs.</p>
<p>And many of the foods that I listed off</p>
<p>might be appetizing to you.</p>
<p>Some of them might be unappetizing to you</p>
<p>or some of them you might be sort of neutral about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very clear that eating foods</p>
<p>that are rich in omega-3s and or supplementing</p>
<p>with omega-3s to get above that 1.5 grams</p>
<p>and ideally up to two or even three grams per day of EPA</p>
<p>can be very beneficial for cognitive function</p>
<p>in the short and long term.</p>
<p>Later in the episode, I&rsquo;m going to talk about</p>
<p>how to actually change your relationship</p>
<p>to particular foods so that foods</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t particularly like,</p>
<p>you can actually start to like more.</p>
<p>And that might be important for those of you</p>
<p>that are thinking mackerel, sardines.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m making this face because frankly,</p>
<p>those are not foods that I naturally like.</p>
<p>But again, I want to emphasize</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to consume fish and animal products</p>
<p>in order to get sufficient EPAs.</p>
<p>You can get them from plants,</p>
<p>but I do believe based on the quality peer-reviewed research</p>
<p>that everybody should be striving to get</p>
<p>a minimum threshold of at least a gram and a half</p>
<p>of EPAs per day one way or the other.</p>
<p>The great thing about omega-3s</p>
<p>is that they are also thought to be beneficial</p>
<p>for things like cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>And although there&rsquo;s some controversy there</p>
<p>as to whether or not two grams or three grams</p>
<p>or six grams is ideal for cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>I think the bulk of evidence points to the fact</p>
<p>that getting sufficient omega-3s in the diet</p>
<p>is going to support cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Certainly not the only thing people should be doing</p>
<p>to support their cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>aerobic exercise and so forth being important also,</p>
<p>but it does seem to support cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>And in doing so, supporting brain health.</p>
<p>However, what I&rsquo;m emphasizing is ingestion of omega-3s</p>
<p>to support the very cells within the brain</p>
<p>that make up our cognition,</p>
<p>that allow for cognition and for movement and memory</p>
<p>and all the other marvelous things that the brain does.</p>
<p>The other compound that has been shown</p>
<p>to be directly supportive of neuronal function</p>
<p>is phosphatidylserine,</p>
<p>which is abundant in meats and in fish.</p>
<p>So here we are again,</p>
<p>back to fish being an important source</p>
<p>of brain supporting food.</p>
<p>Phosphatidylserine is something</p>
<p>that nowadays people are supplementing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lipid-like compound that at least in three studies</p>
<p>have been shown to improve cognition.</p>
<p>These weren&rsquo;t huge effects,</p>
<p>but they were statistically significant effects.</p>
<p>And as well in more than three, at least five studies</p>
<p>to reduce cognitive decline.</p>
<p>And this is interesting.</p>
<p>In every case, it was 300 milligrams</p>
<p>supplemented phosphatidylserine.</p>
<p>But one, again, doesn&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to supplement phosphatidylserine.</p>
<p>Phosphatidylserine can be derived,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, from meats and fish</p>
<p>and to some extent from cabbage of all things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much cabbage people are ingesting.</p>
<p>But later when we talk about gut health</p>
<p>and the relationship between gut health and brain health,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mention fermented foods.</p>
<p>And of course, one of the most readily available</p>
<p>fermented foods out there</p>
<p>that at least many people find appetizing is sauerkraut,</p>
<p>which is of course made from cabbage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fermented cabbage.</p>
<p>So for those of you that do consume meat and fish,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re getting enough fish,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably getting enough phosphatidylserine.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in supplementing phosphatidylserine</p>
<p>to get these effects that were reported</p>
<p>in these various manuscripts,</p>
<p>which by the way, I&rsquo;ve read and looked solid.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve seen the landmark study</p>
<p>showing that supplementing with phosphatidylserine</p>
<p>at 300 milligrams per day is going to create</p>
<p>a huge offsetting of a massive cognitive decline</p>
<p>or a massive increase in brain function.</p>
<p>These seem to be modest effects,</p>
<p>but the effects do appear to be real.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in supplementing with phosphatidylserine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a relatively inexpensive supplement</p>
<p>that again is lipid-like.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s mimicking some of the same things</p>
<p>that you would get from food, but in higher concentration.</p>
<p>Now, after EPA, fatty acids and phosphatidylserine,</p>
<p>I would say third on the list of things that come from food</p>
<p>that can readily support brain function would be choline.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the relationship to choline</p>
<p>in the biosynthesis pathway for acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator, not a neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>but a neuromodulator in the brain.</p>
<p>A neuromodulator is a chemical that modulates</p>
<p>the function of many brain circuits</p>
<p>and also circuits within the body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mention what those are in a moment,</p>
<p>but acetylcholine as a neuromodulator</p>
<p>tends to enhance the activity, the electrical activity</p>
<p>and chemical activity of certain sets of neurons</p>
<p>and downplay the activity of other neurons.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of a conductor of sorts</p>
<p>leading to enhanced function and activity</p>
<p>in certain brain areas and circuits and others.</p>
<p>For instance, the brain areas that are involved</p>
<p>in focus and alertness.</p>
<p>We have multiple clusters of neurons in our brain</p>
<p>that make acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Two of the most prominent and well-known</p>
<p>are the so-called nucleus basalis,</p>
<p>which is a cluster of neurons deep in the basal forebrain</p>
<p>that highlight particular areas of our brain,</p>
<p>highlight meaning when acetylcholine is released</p>
<p>from those neurons at their nerve endings</p>
<p>in particular areas of the brain,</p>
<p>those particular areas of the brain</p>
<p>can undergo enhanced levels of activity</p>
<p>relative to surrounding areas.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a electrical highlighter pen,</p>
<p>if you will, by analogy.</p>
<p>That is the basis of much of what we call focus</p>
<p>or our ability to concentrate</p>
<p>on a particular batch of information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming in through our eyes, our ears, our nose,</p>
<p>or even things that we&rsquo;re just thinking in our head.</p>
<p>So having ample choline for production of acetylcholine</p>
<p>allows for focus through, of course,</p>
<p>many intervening steps.</p>
<p>There are also regions of the brain</p>
<p>in the so-called back of the brain, the hindbrain,</p>
<p>that release acetylcholine</p>
<p>that are involved in general states of alertness.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly then,</p>
<p>many of the treatments for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>which is an inability or challenges</p>
<p>with remembering things and focusing</p>
<p>are drugs that impact the acetylcholine pathway</p>
<p>and are aimed at enhancing the amount of acetylcholine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s available to neurons.</p>
<p>And it can do that through a number of different mechanisms.</p>
<p>You can do that by enhancing the amount of acetylcholine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s created,</p>
<p>or you can do that by taking a drug</p>
<p>that can reduce the amount of enzyme</p>
<p>that gobbles up the acetylcholine,</p>
<p>and in doing so, leading to more net acetylcholine.</p>
<p>But outside of the scenario</p>
<p>where somebody has cognitive decline due to Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>all of us are able to focus to some degree or not,</p>
<p>or are able to be alert to some degree or not</p>
<p>based on the amount of acetylcholine that we have.</p>
<p>Now, other processes, of course, are involved,</p>
<p>but what this means is that making sure</p>
<p>that we have enough of the substrates</p>
<p>to create acetylcholine is vital</p>
<p>if we want to be able to focus.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why dietary choline is so vital.</p>
<p>And the primary source for dietary choline would be eggs,</p>
<p>and in particular, egg yolks.</p>
<p>And this, again, has a very interesting relationship</p>
<p>to our evolution as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always referred to as hunter-gatherers,</p>
<p>but when one hears hunters,</p>
<p>we often think about meat and animal sources.</p>
<p>And indeed, as a species,</p>
<p>we hunted many, many other species of animals</p>
<p>to consume them and still do.</p>
<p>But we also fished.</p>
<p>We talked about that earlier and consumed a lot of fish.</p>
<p>And we consumed a lot of eggs.</p>
<p>Eggs are an incredibly rich source</p>
<p>of nutrients for the brain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the egg actually,</p>
<p>if you think about it,</p>
<p>contains all the nutrients that are required</p>
<p>in order for an organism to grow.</p>
<p>You know, a bird that&rsquo;s in a eggshell,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got the yolk there,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s using that yolk for a reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s using that yolk as a source of fuel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s using that yolk as a source</p>
<p>of literally building blocks</p>
<p>in order to create its nervous system.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I worked on chick embryos,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s these amazing experiments.</p>
<p>You could actually take an egg</p>
<p>and you could create a little window in the top.</p>
<p>And these were fertilized eggs.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d see over time,</p>
<p>you could peer in there,</p>
<p>literally look in with a microscope</p>
<p>or even with the naked eye.</p>
<p>And you would see this little chick embryo</p>
<p>sitting on top of that yolk,</p>
<p>growing and growing and growing and growing.</p>
<p>And the yolk getting smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really incredible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using that as a source</p>
<p>for all the building blocks of the body,</p>
<p>but in particular, the nervous system.</p>
<p>So eggs are a rich source of choline.</p>
<p>Some people will supplement with choline.</p>
<p>However, food sources</p>
<p>seem to be the best source of choline.</p>
<p>And as with the EPAs and the omega-3s,</p>
<p>there are plenty of foods</p>
<p>that are non-animal based that contain choline.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who doesn&rsquo;t eat eggs</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t want to eat eggs,</p>
<p>things like potatoes, nuts, and seeds,</p>
<p>and grains, and fruit,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have as much choline as eggs,</p>
<p>but they do contain choline.</p>
<p>So you can look up the values of choline</p>
<p>that are present in those various foods</p>
<p>and make sure that you&rsquo;re reaching the threshold</p>
<p>amount of choline for you.</p>
<p>In general, most people should probably strive</p>
<p>to get somewhere between 500 milligrams</p>
<p>and a gram of choline per day,</p>
<p>so 1,000 milligrams.</p>
<p>And some people rely on supplementation</p>
<p>in order to hit those levels</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not eating a lot of egg yolks</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not eating a lot of other foods.</p>
<p>Certain fish contain choline, for instance,</p>
<p>and the other foods I listed off a few minutes ago</p>
<p>from plant-based sources.</p>
<p>So some people will supplement</p>
<p>with 50 to 100 milligrams</p>
<p>or whatever amount is necessary</p>
<p>to get them up to that one gram</p>
<p>or even a two gram dose per day.</p>
<p>So we have three things</p>
<p>that we know can support nerve cells.</p>
<p>EPA, in particular, omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>phosphatidylserine, and choline.</p>
<p>Those three things I would list off</p>
<p>as the top three things for enhancing neuron function</p>
<p>and the integrity of neurons</p>
<p>in the short and long-term.</p>
<p>And this is, again, is setting aside</p>
<p>the vitally important factors of hydration and electrolytes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before on other podcasts,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re not ingesting enough water</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not getting enough sodium</p>
<p>and magnesium and potassium,</p>
<p>then obviously your neurons can&rsquo;t run</p>
<p>because a lot of the brain is water.</p>
<p>You need to maintain proper hydration</p>
<p>and sodium, potassium, and magnesium</p>
<p>are important in order for nerve cells to function.</p>
<p>In fact, they are actually the components,</p>
<p>the ions that pass across those lipid membranes,</p>
<p>those little fatty membranes</p>
<p>that we were talking about earlier,</p>
<p>that allow the neurons to generate electrical activity</p>
<p>and communicate with one another.</p>
<p>So definitely you want to hydrate enough.</p>
<p>We will do an entire other episode</p>
<p>all about hydration and electrolytes.</p>
<p>But omega-3s, the EPAs, phosphatidylserine, and choline,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious, are going to improve brain function.</p>
<p>How much they will improve brain function</p>
<p>probably depends on how well</p>
<p>your brain was working previously.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the studies that have looked</p>
<p>at the effectiveness of these compounds</p>
<p>have looked in people that are suffering from mild</p>
<p>or even severe cognitive decline.</p>
<p>And while the outcomes of those studies vary,</p>
<p>given the interest in maintaining brain function,</p>
<p>given the fact that we don&rsquo;t make new neurons</p>
<p>throughout our entire life,</p>
<p>and given that everybody has to eat,</p>
<p>these are quality, healthy foods</p>
<p>that we should all be ingesting anyways.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s clear that they can support brain function</p>
<p>to some degree or another.</p>
<p>Many people ask what I do in light of this information.</p>
<p>And while I can only talk about what works for me,</p>
<p>I choose to ingest fish oil mainly in liquid form,</p>
<p>because that turns out to be the easiest way</p>
<p>and the most economically affordable way to do it</p>
<p>for most people.</p>
<p>So there are various forms of liquid fish oil out there.</p>
<p>Some of them include some lemon flavoring,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t taste like fish oil,</p>
<p>because frankly, fish oil to me is sort of noxious tasting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll take a tablespoon of that or two per day.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m traveling, I&rsquo;ll use the capsule form</p>
<p>in order to hit that threshold of for me about two,</p>
<p>sometimes even three grams per day of EPA.</p>
<p>So not just two or three grams per day of fish oil,</p>
<p>but two or three grams per day of EPA.</p>
<p>Now, if I&rsquo;m eating fish,</p>
<p>which as I mentioned earlier is not often,</p>
<p>then I might reduce the amount of fish oil that I take.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s my major source of fish oil.</p>
<p>Currently, I do not supplement with phosphatidylserine.</p>
<p>A number of people that I know and trust</p>
<p>and indeed several colleagues of mine</p>
<p>do take phosphatidylserine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any good explanation</p>
<p>for why I don&rsquo;t take it yet,</p>
<p>but I have not tried supplementing with it yet.</p>
<p>Maybe if some of you have,</p>
<p>you can place your experience in the comment section.</p>
<p>That would be of interest.</p>
<p>And then in terms of choline,</p>
<p>in order to get choline in my diet,</p>
<p>I do pay attention to the various foods that contain choline</p>
<p>and I try and get those foods on a semi-regular basis.</p>
<p>I do supplement with something called alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>which is essentially in the acetylcholine pathway</p>
<p>or biosynthesis pathway.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take it very often,</p>
<p>but I will take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC</p>
<p>from time to time.</p>
<p>From time to time,</p>
<p>I mean anywhere from two to three times per week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll generally do it early in the day</p>
<p>because it, for me,</p>
<p>can have a little bit of a stimulant effect,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not nearly as stimulating,</p>
<p>say, as a double espresso or triple espresso.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s one way in which I enhance my choline function.</p>
<p>And some people choose to get it from supplementation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s straightforward.</p>
<p>There are a lot of supplements out there</p>
<p>that contain alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>Some people are taking dosages</p>
<p>as high as 900 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>That sounds very high to me.</p>
<p>The studies of offsetting cognitive decline</p>
<p>using alpha-GPC did use quite high dosages</p>
<p>of 600 to 900 or even 1200 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>So it has been used at those much higher concentrations,</p>
<p>but because fortunately,</p>
<p>at least not yet or not to my awareness,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suffering from any cognitive decline,</p>
<p>I will supplement with 300 milligrams every now and again.</p>
<p>Next on my list of compounds</p>
<p>that have been shown in peer-reviewed research</p>
<p>to improve neuronal and brain function is creatine.</p>
<p>Creatine can be derived from meat sources.</p>
<p>It can also be supplemented.</p>
<p>Some of you are probably familiar with creatine</p>
<p>or have heard about creatine</p>
<p>from the context of the health and fitness world</p>
<p>where creatine is used to bring more water into muscles,</p>
<p>which can enhance the strength of those muscles,</p>
<p>as well as bring water into other tissues.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t just draw more water into muscle,</p>
<p>it can draw more water into the body generally.</p>
<p>Creatine has also been shown</p>
<p>to have an important role in brain function.</p>
<p>And once again, this is something that came up</p>
<p>during the discussion about depression a few episodes back.</p>
<p>Creatine can actually be used as a fuel source in the brain.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some evidence that it can enhance the function</p>
<p>of certain frontal cortical circuits</p>
<p>that feed down onto or rather connect to areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in mood regulation and motivation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where creatine plays a role in depression</p>
<p>or rather where creatine supplementation</p>
<p>seems to be able to assist in some forms of mild depression.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an emerging literature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still not well-established.</p>
<p>However, there is now ample evidence</p>
<p>that creatine supplementation can enhance brain function</p>
<p>in certain contexts.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in learning more</p>
<p>about what those contexts are,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an excellent review that just came out.</p>
<p>The first author is Rochelle, R-O-S-C-H-E-L.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to this study,</p>
<p>rather this review, excuse me, in the caption.</p>
<p>This was published just very recently in 2021.</p>
<p>And one thing to make clear is that creatine supplementation</p>
<p>has been shown to be especially useful</p>
<p>for people that are not consuming any meat</p>
<p>or other sources of foods that are rich in creatine.</p>
<p>What is the threshold level of creatine to supplement</p>
<p>in order to get the cognitive benefit?</p>
<p>Appears to be at least five grams per day.</p>
<p>Now, the most typical form of creatine</p>
<p>is so-called creatine monohydrate.</p>
<p>There are other forms of creatine as well,</p>
<p>some of which are thought to not draw as much water</p>
<p>into non-muscle tissues.</p>
<p>And for some people that&rsquo;s attractive to them,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want water sitting below their skin, et cetera.</p>
<p>I should emphasize that the responses to creatine</p>
<p>in that sense can differ.</p>
<p>Some people get a little bit of water retention,</p>
<p>some people experience more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evidence that creatine can impact</p>
<p>some of the hormonal pathways that it might enhance levels</p>
<p>of so-called dihydrotestosterone, DHT.</p>
<p>And therefore, because DHT is involved in hair loss,</p>
<p>there are these theories that creatine can cause hair loss.</p>
<p>And indeed, for people that are very DHT sensitive,</p>
<p>it might, you know, there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of variation</p>
<p>person to person in terms of how much creatine impacts DHT</p>
<p>and how many DHT receptors they have on their scalp</p>
<p>and therefore whether or not they experience hair loss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just giving you all this information</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re aware of the various things</p>
<p>that creatine can do.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, I think it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>that creatine supplementation of five grams per day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creatine monohydrate,</p>
<p>has been shown to improve cognition in people</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t getting creatine from animal sources.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some evidence detailed within the review</p>
<p>that I just described that creatine supplementation</p>
<p>can also enhance cognition in people</p>
<p>that are also eating animal products.</p>
<p>So I personally take creatine five grams per day</p>
<p>and have for a very long time.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve noticed a tremendous benefit</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve actually never really come off it.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve never done the control experiment.</p>
<p>I take it more as kind of a baseline insurance policy.</p>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;m certainly losing some of my hair,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s due to creatine or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done the analysis.</p>
<p>But what I can say is that I generally consume these things</p>
<p>like EPAs, creatine, alpha-GPC</p>
<p>to set a general context of support for my neurons,</p>
<p>for my brain.</p>
<p>And of course, I also pay attention to the foods</p>
<p>that contain these various compounds.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t actively eat additional meat</p>
<p>just to obtain creatine.</p>
<p>I eat a fairly limited amount of meat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t restrict it, and I do eat meat,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t actively seek out creatine in my diet.</p>
<p>Rather, I use supplementation</p>
<p>in order to hit that five grams per day threshold.</p>
<p>Next on the list of foods</p>
<p>that are beneficial for brain health</p>
<p>is one that you&rsquo;ve probably seen pictures of online</p>
<p>because there seems to be a practice</p>
<p>of putting pictures of blueberries and other dark berries</p>
<p>next to any title that says foods that benefit your brain.</p>
<p>There are a lot of foods out there</p>
<p>that have been purported to improve brain function.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about blueberries and other berries,</p>
<p>blackberries, dark currants,</p>
<p>any of these thin-skinned berries</p>
<p>that are purplish in color</p>
<p>is that they contain what are called anthocyanins.</p>
<p>Anthocyanins actually have some really nice data</p>
<p>to support the fact that they improve brain function.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not it is direct effects on neurons</p>
<p>or whether or not it is by lowering inflammation</p>
<p>or some other modulatory effect isn&rsquo;t quite clear,</p>
<p>but I think by now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s enough data to support the fact</p>
<p>that eating a cup or two of blueberries pretty often,</p>
<p>every day, or maybe you have blackberries</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s black currants,</p>
<p>that these anthocyanins are good for us,</p>
<p>that they are enhancing our overall wellbeing</p>
<p>at a number of different levels.</p>
<p>And just to give you a couple examples</p>
<p>of where there are actually peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>to support those statements,</p>
<p>the anthocyanins of which blueberries</p>
<p>and other dark berries are rich in</p>
<p>have been shown to reduce the amount of DNA damage,</p>
<p>has been shown to reduce significantly,</p>
<p>albeit slightly, excuse me, cognitive decline.</p>
<p>And that particular study</p>
<p>was supplementation of a blueberry extract.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about the difference between extract</p>
<p>and actual blueberries in a moment,</p>
<p>but supplementation of blueberry extract</p>
<p>in offsetting cognitive decline in elderly people.</p>
<p>So, what constitutes elderly</p>
<p>is always a little bit of a debate and a discussion,</p>
<p>but in this case, what they did is they supplemented</p>
<p>with somewhere between 428,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they selected 428,</p>
<p>and 598 milligrams of anthocyanins daily for 12 weeks</p>
<p>was associated with improvements</p>
<p>on verbal learning and memory.</p>
<p>And they had some other beneficial changes</p>
<p>that were within the bodily organs</p>
<p>and blood glucose regulation and so forth, positive changes.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s one study, in this case,</p>
<p>elderly meant 65 or older.</p>
<p>That study and a number of studies like it,</p>
<p>looking at things like mildly enhanced memory,</p>
<p>reduced insulin levels, reduced oxidation of LDL,</p>
<p>these sorts of things,</p>
<p>have basically created a situation</p>
<p>where anytime you Google or look up</p>
<p>foods that enhance brain function,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see a picture of a blueberry</p>
<p>or some other berry because of these anthocyanins.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t supplement anthocyanins.</p>
<p>I do like blueberries.</p>
<p>I eat blueberries when they&rsquo;re in season.</p>
<p>I love them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m what you would call a drive-by blueberry eater.</p>
<p>Like if there are blueberries in a bowl on a table</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m walking by, I just have to scoop them up</p>
<p>like some sort of bear or other animal</p>
<p>and pop them in my mouth.</p>
<p>So blueberries don&rsquo;t last long around me.</p>
<p>One of the issues with berries like blueberries</p>
<p>and blackberries and so forth</p>
<p>is that quality sources of them can be pretty expensive.</p>
<p>And then of course, when they&rsquo;re not in season,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hard to get.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why some people will supplement with them.</p>
<p>So that range of about 400 to about 600 milligrams per day</p>
<p>seems to be the minimum threshold</p>
<p>for getting a cognitive effect in these elderly patients.</p>
<p>In that case, they were patients.</p>
<p>A good review about the anthocyanins</p>
<p>potentially contributing to offsetting cognitive decline</p>
<p>in things like Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and also enhancing brain function</p>
<p>in people that don&rsquo;t have Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>is a review by Afzal, A-F-Z-A-L, that was published in 2019.</p>
<p>We will also provide a link to that study in the caption.</p>
<p>When one looks across the total batch of studies</p>
<p>that are out there on this,</p>
<p>it appears that if one is going to supplement</p>
<p>with blueberry extract</p>
<p>to get the anthocyanin effect on cognition,</p>
<p>dosages of somewhere between five and a half</p>
<p>or about 11 grams seem optimal with the higher end,</p>
<p>closer to 10 or 11 grams being more beneficial.</p>
<p>The blueberry eaters out there like me</p>
<p>who prefer to get their anthocyanins</p>
<p>from the actual berries,</p>
<p>it appears that somewhere between 60 to 120 grams</p>
<p>of fresh blueberries each day</p>
<p>is the way that you can get sufficient anthocyanins</p>
<p>to at least shift your system or bias your brain</p>
<p>towards these enhanced cognitive effects.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got EPA fatty acids,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got phosphodidylserine, we&rsquo;ve got choline,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got creatine, and we have the anthocyanins.</p>
<p>And the last item that I&rsquo;d like to place in this list</p>
<p>of food derived things that can enhance brain function</p>
<p>is glutamine.</p>
<p>Glutamine is a very interesting amino acid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about glutamine on here before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evidence, although somewhat scant,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some evidence that glutamine</p>
<p>can enhance immune system function.</p>
<p>So people will supplement with glutamine</p>
<p>or people can get glutamine from foods.</p>
<p>Foods that contain a lot of glutamine</p>
<p>are things like cottage cheese.</p>
<p>There are also other sources of glutamine.</p>
<p>Glutamine is rich in protein rich foods,</p>
<p>things like beef, chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs,</p>
<p>but also for you non animal food consuming people out there,</p>
<p>vegetables, including beans, cabbage, once again,</p>
<p>spinach, parsley, things of that sort.</p>
<p>So those foods contain glutamine.</p>
<p>For people that supplement with glutamine,</p>
<p>generally they will take anywhere from a gram</p>
<p>as much as 10 grams per day.</p>
<p>Why would they want to do that?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also some evidence starting to emerge</p>
<p>that glutamine can help offset sugar cravings.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about this on the podcast before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk more about the basis for this</p>
<p>a little bit later.</p>
<p>But in brief, we all have neurons in our gut</p>
<p>that sense the amino acid content, the fat content</p>
<p>and the sugar content of the foods that we eat</p>
<p>and signal in a subconscious way to our brain,</p>
<p>whether or not the foods that we are eating</p>
<p>contain certain levels of certain amino acids.</p>
<p>And so we actually have glutamine sensing neurons</p>
<p>in our gut that actually have their little processes,</p>
<p>their little axons and dendrites, as we call them</p>
<p>in the mucosal lining of the gut.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just sensing glutamine,</p>
<p>but when they do sense glutamine, they respond</p>
<p>and they send signals to the brain</p>
<p>that are signals of satiation, of satisfaction.</p>
<p>And in doing so can offset some of the sugar cravings</p>
<p>that many people suffer from.</p>
<p>Now, here we&rsquo;re talking about glutamine</p>
<p>for sake of enhancing cognitive function.</p>
<p>And this is interesting because it&rsquo;s been shown</p>
<p>that glutamine supplementation can offset</p>
<p>some of the negative effects on cognition</p>
<p>caused by altitude and oxygen deprivation of other sorts.</p>
<p>You know, okay, well, that&rsquo;s kind of a strange</p>
<p>and unique situation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going up to altitude,</p>
<p>should you supplement with glutamine</p>
<p>in order to be able to think more clearly?</p>
<p>Well, it appears that there&rsquo;s good rationale for doing that.</p>
<p>But the reason I bring this up,</p>
<p>assuming that most people, including me,</p>
<p>are not going up to high altitudes very often,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s been well-established that apnea,</p>
<p>failure to breathe properly during sleep,</p>
<p>can contribute to age-related</p>
<p>and even non-age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons for apneas,</p>
<p>ranging from obesity to obstruction of the airways</p>
<p>for other reasons.</p>
<p>There are a tremendous number of underlying causes of apnea</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>I mean, heart attacks, all sorts of metabolic issues</p>
<p>are caused by apnea.</p>
<p>Apnea is a serious issue that disrupts the depth of sleep</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a serious health issue in general.</p>
<p>In any event, apnea is associated with cognitive decline</p>
<p>and cognitive dysfunction, even in young people.</p>
<p>And it does appear that glutamine supplementation</p>
<p>can offset some of the cognitive deficits</p>
<p>that are associated with reduced oxygenation of the brain.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about</p>
<p>how apnea can negatively impact cognition,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an excellent paper</p>
<p>that was published on this in 2018.</p>
<p>The first author is Sharma, S-H-A-R-M-A.</p>
<p>It should be easy to find.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>Obstructive Sleep Apnea Severity</p>
<p>Affects Amyloid Burden in Cognitively Normal Elderly.</p>
<p>This was a longitudinal study.</p>
<p>Amyloid burden is a correlate of Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and other forms of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline</p>
<p>associated with memory deficits.</p>
<p>So obstructive sleep apnea, excuse me,</p>
<p>is a very serious issue for which glutamine appears</p>
<p>to be able to offset some of the negative symptomology.</p>
<p>So how is it that glutamine,</p>
<p>either from food or through supplementation,</p>
<p>can offset some of these so-called hypoxic effects</p>
<p>caused by sleep apnea,</p>
<p>hypoxia being a lack of oxygen for the brain</p>
<p>that relate to cognitive decline?</p>
<p>It appears to have this positive impact</p>
<p>by way of reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>So if you want to look more deeply</p>
<p>into the various biological pathways</p>
<p>and the supplementation regimes for this,</p>
<p>the paper that I think is really spectacular</p>
<p>is a paper, last author is Quaresma,</p>
<p>Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A, that&rsquo;s Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a review,</p>
<p>The Possible Importance of Glutamine Supplementation</p>
<p>to Mood and Cognition in Hypoxia from High Altitude.</p>
<p>And even though the paper is about</p>
<p>high altitude induced hypoxia,</p>
<p>it does seem to have direct relevance</p>
<p>to the sorts of apnea that are related to Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and other forms of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve been taking glutamine as a supplement,</p>
<p>gosh, since I was in college,</p>
<p>mostly because I felt either by superstition or by reality</p>
<p>that it protected me from various flus and colds</p>
<p>and things of that sort</p>
<p>because of the purported immune enhancing effects.</p>
<p>Again, those immune enhancing effects</p>
<p>have some data to support them, not a ton.</p>
<p>However, I got into the habit of taking glutamine</p>
<p>and now that I&rsquo;ve learned that glutamine</p>
<p>seems to also have some cognitive enhancing effects,</p>
<p>possibly, it&rsquo;s a supplement that I continue to take.</p>
<p>I take very small amounts of it,</p>
<p>but I do take it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So that more or less completes the list of things</p>
<p>that at least by my read of the literature</p>
<p>are things that are supported by at least three</p>
<p>and in some cases as many as hundreds of studies</p>
<p>in various populations</p>
<p>that have been explored in mouse studies often,</p>
<p>but also in a number of human studies.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize again</p>
<p>that all of the things I listed out,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s EPAs,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s phosphatidylserine,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s choline,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s the various compounds</p>
<p>that are in berries, et cetera,</p>
<p>all of those can be extracted from food.</p>
<p>There is not any law that says</p>
<p>that you have to get them from supplementation.</p>
<p>Supplementation can help you get to the very high levels</p>
<p>of those things if you want to work on the higher end,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s right for you,</p>
<p>obviously check with your doctor before taking anything</p>
<p>or removing anything from your diet or supplement regime.</p>
<p>But in general, you can get these things from foods.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so happens that for some of these compounds,</p>
<p>the foods that they&rsquo;re contained in like fish</p>
<p>are not foods that I particularly enjoy.</p>
<p>And so I rely on, excuse me,</p>
<p>I rely on supplements in order</p>
<p>to get sufficient levels for me.</p>
<p>But again, you can get these levels from food.</p>
<p>And the reason I made this list,</p>
<p>the reason that I emphasize these things</p>
<p>in this particular order is that</p>
<p>they support the structure of neurons.</p>
<p>They support the structure of the other cells of the brain</p>
<p>that make up our cognition</p>
<p>and that are important for our focus</p>
<p>and our ability to remember things and so forth.</p>
<p>And they are less so in the category</p>
<p>of so-called modulatory effects.</p>
<p>They will also have modulatory effects on sleep,</p>
<p>on inflammation or reducing inflammation</p>
<p>throughout the body, on cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>all of which I believe are positive effects.</p>
<p>At least what the literature tells us</p>
<p>is that none of these compounds</p>
<p>are harming other systems of the body</p>
<p>provided they are taken at reasonable levels.</p>
<p>But everything in this list</p>
<p>is directed towards answering the question,</p>
<p>what can I eat?</p>
<p>What can I ingest by way of food and or food supplement</p>
<p>that can support brain function in the short term</p>
<p>and in the long term?</p>
<p>So I hope you find that list beneficial for you,</p>
<p>if not for use, at least for consideration.</p>
<p>So now having talked about some of the foods</p>
<p>and micronutrients that are beneficial to our immediate</p>
<p>and long-term brain health,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to shift gears somewhat</p>
<p>and talk about why it is</p>
<p>that we like the foods that we like.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard before that we are hardwired</p>
<p>to pursue sugar and to like fatty foods</p>
<p>and that calorie rich foods are attractive to us</p>
<p>for all sorts of reasons,</p>
<p>surviving famines and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And while that is true,</p>
<p>the actual mechanisms that underlie food seeking</p>
<p>and food preference are far more interesting than that.</p>
<p>There are basically three channels</p>
<p>in our body and nervous system</p>
<p>by which we decide what foods to pursue,</p>
<p>how much to eat,</p>
<p>and whether or not we will find a particular food attractive,</p>
<p>whether or not we will want to consume more of it,</p>
<p>whether or not we want to avoid it,</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s just sort of so-so,</p>
<p>what I refer to as the yum, yuck, or meh analysis.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s what our nervous system is doing</p>
<p>with respect to food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to figure out whether or not yum,</p>
<p>I want more of this,</p>
<p>yuck, I want to avoid this,</p>
<p>or meh, it&rsquo;s so-so.</p>
<p>Now, while that may seem like a overly simplified version</p>
<p>of food seeking and food preference,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually not that far from the truth.</p>
<p>It actually correctly captures</p>
<p>much of the biology of food preference.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what these three channels</p>
<p>for food preference are.</p>
<p>The first one is an obvious one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taste on the mouth.</p>
<p>It is the sensation that we have of the foods</p>
<p>that we eat while we&rsquo;re chewing them.</p>
<p>And those sensations,</p>
<p>which are literally just somatosensory touch sensations,</p>
<p>you know, the palatability of food</p>
<p>as it relates to the consistency of food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ve all heard before,</p>
<p>we have sensors on our tongue and elsewhere in our mouth</p>
<p>that detect the various chemicals contained within food</p>
<p>and lead to the senses of taste,</p>
<p>which we call bitter, sweet, umami, salty, and sour.</p>
<p>Now, most of us are familiar with the sense of bitterness</p>
<p>that comes from something like a raw radish.</p>
<p>Sweet, which comes obviously from sugars of different kinds,</p>
<p>fructose, glucose, et cetera.</p>
<p>Salty, salty.</p>
<p>And sour.</p>
<p>Think lemon or lemon juice, for instance.</p>
<p>And then I mentioned umami.</p>
<p>The umami receptor is a receptor</p>
<p>that responds to the savory taste of things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you might find</p>
<p>in a really wonderfully rich tomato sauce.</p>
<p>For those of you that eat meat and like meat,</p>
<p>a really well-cooked, not necessarily well done,</p>
<p>but properly cooked, I should say, steak,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
<p>And umami is present in both plant and animal foods</p>
<p>and gives us that sensation of savoriness.</p>
<p>It almost has a kind of little bit of a briny taste to it</p>
<p>or braised taste to it.</p>
<p>And indeed, braising of meats and braising of vegetables</p>
<p>is done specifically to activate that umami receptor.</p>
<p>So we have those five basic tastes.</p>
<p>Those are chemical sensors on the tongue</p>
<p>that what we call transduce those chemicals.</p>
<p>Those chemicals literally in food bind to those receptors</p>
<p>and it is transduced,</p>
<p>meaning the binding of those chemicals to the receptors</p>
<p>is converted into an electrical signal</p>
<p>that travels in from the tongue</p>
<p>along what&rsquo;s called the gustatory nerve.</p>
<p>The gustatory nerve then synapses,</p>
<p>meaning it makes connections in our brainstem,</p>
<p>in the so-called nucleus of the solitary tract.</p>
<p>There are other nuclei back there.</p>
<p>Nuclei are just aggregates of neurons.</p>
<p>And then it sends information up</p>
<p>to the so-called insular cortex, to the insula.</p>
<p>I want to highlight the insula this episode</p>
<p>because we are going to return to the insula</p>
<p>again and again in this episode and later.</p>
<p>The insular cortex is a incredible structure</p>
<p>that we all have that mainly is concerned</p>
<p>with so-called interoception</p>
<p>or our perception of what&rsquo;s going on inside our body.</p>
<p>So it could be the amount of pressure in our gut</p>
<p>because of how much food we&rsquo;ve eaten.</p>
<p>It could be the acidity of our gut,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re having a little bit of indigestion, for instance.</p>
<p>It can also be the case that neurons within the insula</p>
<p>are paying attention to how stressed you are</p>
<p>or how alert you are or how tired you are.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really an inward focusing structure.</p>
<p>It focuses on how we feel internally.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, the taste system</p>
<p>sends information up to the insular cortex</p>
<p>to give us a sense, literally, of what we&rsquo;ve ingested,</p>
<p>whether or not what we&rsquo;re tasting tastes good or not.</p>
<p>We will return to insular cortex in a few moments.</p>
<p>A very important thing to understand</p>
<p>is that the neurons in the areas of the cortex,</p>
<p>your cortex and mine, that respond to particular tastes</p>
<p>are providing an internal representation</p>
<p>of an external sense.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be at all abstract.</p>
<p>We take these foods, we break them down in our mouth</p>
<p>by chewing them or sucking on them,</p>
<p>whatever it is that food happens to be.</p>
<p>Those chemicals bind to those receptors</p>
<p>and electrical signals are sent into the brain,</p>
<p>but they are just electrical signals,</p>
<p>just like notes being played on the keys of a piano.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no unique signature for salty or sweet.</p>
<p>It is the relative activation of one set of neurons</p>
<p>that was activated by sweet or another set of neurons</p>
<p>that was activated by umami.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that relative activation traveling into the brain</p>
<p>in essentially the same form, the same electrical signals.</p>
<p>This is really incredible, right?</p>
<p>Electrical signals are sent into the brain and you say,</p>
<p>aha, that&rsquo;s sweet and I want more of it,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s bitter or I want less of it,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s umami flavored and I really, really like that,</p>
<p>really like savory foods as I happen to.</p>
<p>That should immediately strike you as incredible</p>
<p>because it means that your representation</p>
<p>of what you want more of or less of is electrical in nature.</p>
<p>And to really tamp this issue down,</p>
<p>studies that were done by Charles Zucker, Z-U-K-E-R,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a absolutely phenomenal neuroscientist</p>
<p>at Columbia University in New York.</p>
<p>Studies done by the Zucker Lab have shown that,</p>
<p>first of all, they could identify the neurons</p>
<p>in the cortex, deep in the brain,</p>
<p>that respond to a sweet taste or to a bitter taste.</p>
<p>It turns out they are non-overlapping populations</p>
<p>of neurons.</p>
<p>And then using some molecular tricks,</p>
<p>they were able to either silence or activate the neurons</p>
<p>that for instance, respond to sweet.</p>
<p>When they do this,</p>
<p>they see incredible consequences on perception</p>
<p>that indeed occur in your brain and my brain as well</p>
<p>all the time without these kinds of manipulations.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the experiment.</p>
<p>They have a subject drink water that contains sugar</p>
<p>or drink water that contains a salty substance</p>
<p>or drink water that contains a bitter substance,</p>
<p>for instance.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m sort of paraphrasing a large amount of work.</p>
<p>They identify the neurons that respond to sweet tastes.</p>
<p>They see, as many researchers have seen,</p>
<p>that subjects prefer sweet taste to other tastes</p>
<p>and certainly sweet taste to bitter</p>
<p>or sweet taste to nothing.</p>
<p>So to plain water.</p>
<p>And then they go in and they are able to selectively silence</p>
<p>the neurons that represent sweet.</p>
<p>And when they do that,</p>
<p>they eliminate the preference for that sweet taste.</p>
<p>Now that might seem obvious.</p>
<p>The neurons respond to sweet, you silence those neurons.</p>
<p>They no longer seek out sweet,</p>
<p>but that should strike you also as incredible</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not actually changing what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>on the tongue or in the deeper layers of the brain.</p>
<p>Conversely, they can have subjects drink bitter water</p>
<p>or plain water while activating, selectively activating</p>
<p>the neurons that respond to sweet.</p>
<p>And what they find is that then subjects will actively</p>
<p>prefer bitter or plain water to actual preferences</p>
<p>such as sweet.</p>
<p>So what this means is that your perception</p>
<p>of what you like is a central,</p>
<p>meaning with it deep within the brain phenomenon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about how things taste on your mouth.</p>
<p>Now, of course, under normal conditions</p>
<p>where there aren&rsquo;t these experimental manipulations</p>
<p>being done, those things are positively correlated.</p>
<p>Sweet tastes trigger the activation of sweet neurons,</p>
<p>for instance, neurons in the mouth that respond to umami</p>
<p>trigger the activation of neurons in the brain</p>
<p>that respond to umami and so forth.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re correlated in a way that makes you</p>
<p>seek out the things that you like</p>
<p>and avoid the things that you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;ll see in a few minutes,</p>
<p>turns out that that is not a direct relationship</p>
<p>that is hardwired.</p>
<p>You can actually uncouple the preference</p>
<p>for particular tastes with the reward systems in the brain</p>
<p>in a way that for instance, would allow you to eat</p>
<p>or I should use myself as an example</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t particularly like fish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few, you know, meals that included fish</p>
<p>that were pretty good,</p>
<p>but none of them were memorable in the kind of positive way</p>
<p>like some other events in my life are memorable.</p>
<p>But by way of these circuitries</p>
<p>and the way they link up with one another,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually possible to rewire one sense of taste</p>
<p>and preference for particular foods.</p>
<p>If this is seeming at all vague to you,</p>
<p>just hang in with me a little bit longer</p>
<p>because I will provide you with the information tools</p>
<p>and resources with which to navigate this process.</p>
<p>But the most important thing to understand</p>
<p>is that like with our hearing, like with vision,</p>
<p>like with smell, taste is an internal representation</p>
<p>that has particular goals for you.</p>
<p>Your sense of what tastes good is related</p>
<p>to particular things that are occurring</p>
<p>in your brain and body and that are likely</p>
<p>to give your brain and body the things that it needs.</p>
<p>It is not simply a matter of what you quote unquote like</p>
<p>or what tastes good or what doesn&rsquo;t taste good.</p>
<p>Let me give you a relatively simple example</p>
<p>of how your body and your brain are acting</p>
<p>in a coordinated way to make you prefer certain foods</p>
<p>and indeed to pursue certain foods more.</p>
<p>So I just mentioned you have neurons on your tongue</p>
<p>that respond to different tastes,</p>
<p>but of course your digestive tract isn&rsquo;t just your tongue,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also your throat.</p>
<p>It goes all the way down to your stomach</p>
<p>and of course your intestines.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a long tube of digestion.</p>
<p>All along that tube, there are neurons.</p>
<p>Some of the neurons are responding to the mechanical size</p>
<p>of whatever portion of the digestive tract it happens to be.</p>
<p>So for instance, how distended or empty or full rather,</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t have to be distended,</p>
<p>depends on how much you ate,</p>
<p>but how full or empty your gut happens to be,</p>
<p>whether or not something you just ate is temperature hot,</p>
<p>you know, is hot in the sense of hot to the touch</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s spicy hot,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s soothing,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s kind of hard to swallow,</p>
<p>this kind of thing.</p>
<p>So you have neurons all along your gut</p>
<p>that are responding to the mechanics</p>
<p>related to food and digestion,</p>
<p>and that are related to the chemistry of food and digestion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a population of neurons, nerve cells in your gut</p>
<p>that are exquisitely tuned to the chemistry</p>
<p>of whatever it is in your gut.</p>
<p>And these are neurons called neuropod cells.</p>
<p>They were discovered many, many years ago,</p>
<p>but really defined with and classified with modern tools</p>
<p>by Diego Borges.</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;m pronouncing your name correctly, Diego.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve spoken many times,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t ever seem to quite capture</p>
<p>the proper pronunciation just right.</p>
<p>But Diego Borges at Duke University</p>
<p>who discovered that these cells reside within the gut</p>
<p>and place little processes,</p>
<p>their little axons and dendrites</p>
<p>within the mucosal lining of the gut.</p>
<p>And there they are paying attention to,</p>
<p>meaning they respond to amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids.</p>
<p>So as your food is digested,</p>
<p>as food lands within your gut,</p>
<p>neurons there are sensing what types of foods are available</p>
<p>and what types of things are making their way</p>
<p>through the gut environment.</p>
<p>Now, those neurons aren&rsquo;t actually taking those foods</p>
<p>and doing much with them.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re essentially surveying</p>
<p>what qualities of food are there.</p>
<p>And these particular neurons</p>
<p>that Diego and his group discovered</p>
<p>send electrical signals up into the brain</p>
<p>through a little passage that we call the no-dose ganglion.</p>
<p>The no-dose ganglion is a cluster of neurons</p>
<p>that then go send up their own process into the brain</p>
<p>and trigger the release of dopamine,</p>
<p>which is a molecule that inspires motivation,</p>
<p>reward, and more seeking for whatever it is</p>
<p>led to their activation.</p>
<p>These are super interesting neurons</p>
<p>because what they&rsquo;re essentially doing</p>
<p>is they are providing a subconscious signal</p>
<p>about the quality of the food that you&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>what it contains,</p>
<p>and then triggering the release</p>
<p>of a molecule within your brain, dopamine,</p>
<p>that leads you to go seek more of those foods.</p>
<p>Now, this has profound impact on a number of things.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s the consideration</p>
<p>of so-called hidden sugars.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Lustig, who&rsquo;s a pediatric endocrinologist</p>
<p>at University of California, San Francisco,</p>
<p>has been among the most prominent researchers</p>
<p>to talk about the fact</p>
<p>that there are these so-called hidden sugars in foods.</p>
<p>Now, these are not just sugars that they sneak in</p>
<p>just to be sneaky.</p>
<p>These are sugars that are literally snuck in</p>
<p>in a way that you can&rsquo;t taste them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re called hidden sugars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they just put them in there for fun.</p>
<p>These are sugars that are placed into processed foods</p>
<p>that are designed to trigger activation of these mechanisms</p>
<p>to lead you to want to eat more of these foods,</p>
<p>but not because they necessarily taste sweet or delicious,</p>
<p>but because they are activating</p>
<p>these subconscious mechanisms</p>
<p>that are driving you to pursue more of these foods.</p>
<p>Sounds like a very diabolical strategy.</p>
<p>And indeed, it is somewhat of a diabolical strategy.</p>
<p>However, these neurons are also involved</p>
<p>in signaling to your brain when, for instance,</p>
<p>you are eating a food that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>the fatty acids that we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>So why is it that you don&rsquo;t crave salmon?</p>
<p>Why is it that I don&rsquo;t sit around daydreaming about mackerel?</p>
<p>Well, because there&rsquo;s also the influence</p>
<p>of the actual taste on the mouth.</p>
<p>Under normal conditions, it&rsquo;s a combination</p>
<p>of the taste of the thing on the mouth</p>
<p>plus the subconscious signaling from the gut.</p>
<p>And while this isn&rsquo;t a discussion about gut microbiome,</p>
<p>I should just mention that it&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>that having a healthy gut microbiome</p>
<p>allows these neurons to function in a way</p>
<p>that serves our seeking of healthy foods in positive ways.</p>
<p>And without getting into a lot of detail about this,</p>
<p>the best way to ensure a healthy gut microbiome</p>
<p>that I am aware of is not necessarily</p>
<p>to take supplemental prebiotics or probiotics.</p>
<p>There are actually some reasons</p>
<p>why you might not want to do that,</p>
<p>but rather to ingest two to four servings</p>
<p>of fermented foods that are low in sugar each day.</p>
<p>There is a recent study published in Cell</p>
<p>showing that the ingestion of fermented foods,</p>
<p>two to four servings each day,</p>
<p>can enhance the quality of the mucosal lining of the gut</p>
<p>that allows certain gut microbiota to flourish</p>
<p>and the gut microbiota that are not good for us</p>
<p>to not flourish,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the environment that they settle down into.</p>
<p>This is work that was carried out</p>
<p>by my colleagues, Justin Sonnenberg,</p>
<p>which is in the laboratory upstairs from me,</p>
<p>as well as Chris Gardner and others at Stanford.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re certainly not the only researchers exploring this,</p>
<p>but it does appear that two to four servings</p>
<p>of fermented foods each day,</p>
<p>so these would be things like natto, sauerkraut,</p>
<p>low sugar fermented foods,</p>
<p>is great for the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And separate studies, not their study,</p>
<p>but separate studies have shown</p>
<p>that the correct gut microbiome conditions</p>
<p>allow these neurons that signal to the brain</p>
<p>to signal at the right times and in the right ways</p>
<p>to promote healthy food seeking.</p>
<p>Many people opt to supplement with capsule form probiotics.</p>
<p>There are some data that suggests</p>
<p>that maybe those don&rsquo;t contain the correct prebiotics</p>
<p>for setting the correct gut microbiota conditions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit of a controversial issue.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, getting probiotics from fermented foods</p>
<p>is probably the simplest and most straightforward way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the way that we evolved to do that</p>
<p>over many, at least hundreds and probably thousands</p>
<p>or even tens or hundreds of thousands of years,</p>
<p>people have been ingesting fermented foods,</p>
<p>not just for their taste,</p>
<p>but for their health benefits as well.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;ve mentioned two of the three mechanisms</p>
<p>by which we prefer certain foods.</p>
<p>One is from the actual taste that we&rsquo;re familiar with,</p>
<p>the taste on our tongue and in our mouth</p>
<p>and the sensations that make us go,</p>
<p>mm, or ugh, or eh, the yum, yuck, meh responses</p>
<p>as I referred to them earlier.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this subconscious signaling</p>
<p>coming from the gut that&rsquo;s really based</p>
<p>on the nutrient content of the foods.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a third pathway,</p>
<p>which is the learned association of a particular taste</p>
<p>with the particular quality or value that a food has.</p>
<p>And this is where things get really interesting</p>
<p>and where there&rsquo;s actually a leverage point</p>
<p>for you to rewire what it is that you find tasty</p>
<p>and that you want to seek more of.</p>
<p>The work I&rsquo;d like to talk about next</p>
<p>has been carried out in mouse models</p>
<p>and has been carried out in parallel experiments in humans.</p>
<p>This is largely, not exclusively,</p>
<p>but largely the work of Ivan de Arrujo and Dana Small.</p>
<p>Ivan de Arrujo is at Mount Sinai School of Medicine</p>
<p>and Dana Small is at Yale.</p>
<p>And they and others in their field</p>
<p>have done incredible experiments</p>
<p>exploring how taste and food value,</p>
<p>the nutritional value of food</p>
<p>and the impact of that food on metabolism in the brain</p>
<p>drives our food choices</p>
<p>and allows us to change our food choices for the better.</p>
<p>Their groups have done some really amazing studies</p>
<p>involving ingestion of a particular substance</p>
<p>that either contains sugar</p>
<p>and thereby can elevate glucose, blood sugar, or not.</p>
<p>And varying, meaning changing the taste associated</p>
<p>with that ingestion of sugar.</p>
<p>So let me just give you a simple example</p>
<p>where they have subjects,</p>
<p>these could be mice or these could be humans</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve done both sets of studies,</p>
<p>drink sweet water as an alternative or a choice</p>
<p>to non-sweetened water or bitter water or some other flavor.</p>
<p>What they find is that mice and humans</p>
<p>will prefer to consume the sweet beverage.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not always sweet water.</p>
<p>Mice like sweet water, but humans will prefer,</p>
<p>for instance, a milkshake, a fatty sweet drink.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll consume more of that.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, dopamine levels in the brain</p>
<p>increase in response to that.</p>
<p>So the taste and the nutrient content</p>
<p>of what it is that they&rsquo;re ingesting are aligned.</p>
<p>They are matched.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also done experiments where they have no taste,</p>
<p>but subjects are being infused with sugar</p>
<p>directly into the gut.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly,</p>
<p>based on everything I&rsquo;ve told you up until now,</p>
<p>subjects will pursue more of that thing</p>
<p>relative to some other taste,</p>
<p>either neutral or negative taste,</p>
<p>because that sugar in the gut is triggering the activation</p>
<p>of the neurons I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>which is signaling to the brain</p>
<p>to pursue more of that thing.</p>
<p>So this tells us something important.</p>
<p>It tells us that we are driven,</p>
<p>meaning we have mechanisms in our brain</p>
<p>that make us motivated to pursue more of what brings</p>
<p>both a taste of sweetness,</p>
<p>but also that brings actual changes</p>
<p>in blood glucose levels up, okay?</p>
<p>So we are motivated to eat sweet things,</p>
<p>not just because they taste good,</p>
<p>but because they change our blood sugar level.</p>
<p>They increase our blood sugar level.</p>
<p>This is important because it needn&rsquo;t be the case.</p>
<p>It could have been that we were just wired</p>
<p>to pursue things that taste good.</p>
<p>But what this tells us is that we are actually wired</p>
<p>to pursue things that increase our blood glucose.</p>
<p>So much so that when the small lab,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a small lab, it&rsquo;s actually a big lab,</p>
<p>but when Dana Small&rsquo;s lab and or Ivan de Arrujo&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>have done experiments where they use a compound</p>
<p>called 2-deoxyglucose,</p>
<p>this is a compound that can prevent glucose</p>
<p>from being metabolized by neurons.</p>
<p>So blood glucose is going up, but neurons can&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>What they find is that the reinforcing</p>
<p>or the rewarding properties of a food or taste</p>
<p>are eliminated.</p>
<p>Put simply, it is not sufficient for a food</p>
<p>to taste good consciously.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient for a food to increase blood sugar.</p>
<p>You need blood sugar to go up and that blood sugar,</p>
<p>glucose has to be utilized by the neurons,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not associated with a good taste.</p>
<p>And to make it even simpler, if this isn&rsquo;t sinking in,</p>
<p>this should make it very clear.</p>
<p>What your brain, meaning what you are seeking when you eat</p>
<p>is not taste, is not dopamine,</p>
<p>is not even a rise in blood glucose.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re seeking, even though you don&rsquo;t realize it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s subconscious,</p>
<p>is you are seeking things that allow your neurons</p>
<p>to be metabolically active.</p>
<p>And this is fundamentally important for understanding</p>
<p>why you eat, why you eat particular foods,</p>
<p>and how you can change your relationship to those foods.</p>
<p>Now, earlier I referred to circuits that are wired</p>
<p>for a particular outcome.</p>
<p>And in biology, and in particular neuroscience,</p>
<p>we refer to things that are either hardwired,</p>
<p>meaning immutable and unchangeable, or softwired.</p>
<p>A good example of soft wiring would be the areas</p>
<p>of your brain that are responsible for speech and language</p>
<p>are always more or less in the same place in your brain</p>
<p>and everyone else&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>However, they are not hardwired to speak French</p>
<p>or to speak English or to speak Chinese or to speak German,</p>
<p>because depending on where you were born</p>
<p>and the parents that you&rsquo;re born to,</p>
<p>you need to be able to speak one</p>
<p>or maybe even more languages.</p>
<p>The taste system and this general system</p>
<p>of seeking particular foods,</p>
<p>similarly is hardwired to obtain certain types of nutrients.</p>
<p>It tends to like sweet things.</p>
<p>Most children naturally like sweet things,</p>
<p>some more than others, but naturally.</p>
<p>Most people from childhood onward</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t particularly crave very bitter substances,</p>
<p>maybe mildly bitter, but not very bitter.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some hard wiring of preference,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also some soft wiring in the system</p>
<p>that allows it to change.</p>
<p>The groups I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>have done some really beautiful experiments</p>
<p>looking at how artificial sweeteners interact</p>
<p>with the actual sweet sensing system.</p>
<p>And this gets right down to a number of issues.</p>
<p>First of all, it gets to the issue</p>
<p>of how we can rewire our taste system</p>
<p>in ways that serve us for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Second of all, it gets right down to the issue</p>
<p>of whether or not artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>are good for us or bad for us.</p>
<p>And indeed, as of just this last year,</p>
<p>we now have an answer to that question.</p>
<p>And turns out it depends.</p>
<p>And I will tell you in a few minutes</p>
<p>when it is okay to ingest artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>and when it is very detrimental</p>
<p>to ingest artificial sweeteners of any kind.</p>
<p>Regardless, I&rsquo;m not going to name off brand names,</p>
<p>but there are different forms</p>
<p>of these artificial sweeteners nowadays.</p>
<p>And there are various forms</p>
<p>of non-caloric plant-based sweeteners</p>
<p>for which the same information</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m about to tell you applies.</p>
<p>Okay, so the experiments that were done</p>
<p>beautifully illustrate that you seek out particular foods</p>
<p>because of the way they taste,</p>
<p>because of their impact on blood glucose levels,</p>
<p>but also on their impact on the dopamine system,</p>
<p>even if your blood glucose levels don&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the experiment.</p>
<p>One group of subjects is given a sweet taste</p>
<p>of a substance that also raises blood glucose levels,</p>
<p>blood sugar, and dopamine goes up, not surprisingly.</p>
<p>Second condition, separate subjects consume</p>
<p>an artificial sweetener or a non-caloric sweetener.</p>
<p>It is not preferred much over other substances,</p>
<p>but it is sweet, so it&rsquo;s preferred somewhat.</p>
<p>And it does not cause an increase in blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, dopamine levels don&rsquo;t go up.</p>
<p>So initially we don&rsquo;t tend to like</p>
<p>artificial sweeteners that much.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the simple way of putting it.</p>
<p>However, if subjects continue</p>
<p>to ingest artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s no increase in blood glucose level,</p>
<p>and therefore no increase in brain metabolism,</p>
<p>dopamine levels eventually start to rise.</p>
<p>And when those dopamine levels eventually start to rise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve essentially conditioned or reinforced</p>
<p>that artificial or non-caloric sweetener,</p>
<p>and then subjects start to consume more of it,</p>
<p>and they actually get a dopamine increase from it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It says that consuming more of these artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>or consuming them for a longer period of time</p>
<p>can start to tap into the dopamine system</p>
<p>and lead us to seek out or consume</p>
<p>more of these artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>Many people are probably familiar with this</p>
<p>because we tend to, or I should say,</p>
<p>people report that when they ingest</p>
<p>these artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>at first they don&rsquo;t taste very good,</p>
<p>but then over time they seem kind of tolerable,</p>
<p>and then maybe even pleasurable.</p>
<p>And then some people feel, quote unquote,</p>
<p>addicted to various diet sodas and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s another condition that&rsquo;s been explored,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the really interesting condition.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the condition where an artificial sweetener</p>
<p>is paired with a substance that can increase blood sugar,</p>
<p>but not because it tastes sugary</p>
<p>like a normal sweet substance.</p>
<p>So now there&rsquo;s an artificial sweetener</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coupled with an actual increase in blood glucose.</p>
<p>The natural world scenario where this would happen</p>
<p>would be drinking a diet soda,</p>
<p>which contains no calories</p>
<p>and therefore would not increase blood glucose,</p>
<p>but is sweet with a food that increases blood glucose.</p>
<p>And when that happens,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re essentially doing</p>
<p>is tapping into the dopamine system,</p>
<p>this non-caloric sweet taste is paired with it,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an increase in neuron metabolism.</p>
<p>So you have all of the components for reinforcement.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>you get in a sort of Pavlovian conditioning way,</p>
<p>a situation where later,</p>
<p>when you ingest that artificial sweetener,</p>
<p>you actually get not only the increase in dopamine,</p>
<p>but you get alterations in blood sugar management.</p>
<p>Now, blood sugar cannot go up</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t ingest something that makes blood sugar go up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not as if you ingest artificial sweetener</p>
<p>with some food that contains calories or sugar,</p>
<p>and then later you remove the food</p>
<p>and you just drink the soda and your blood glucose goes up.</p>
<p>Rather, it&rsquo;s a much worse situation.</p>
<p>If you, I&rsquo;ll make this in the natural world context,</p>
<p>if you ingest an artificial sweetener,</p>
<p>say drink diet soda while consuming foods</p>
<p>that increase blood glucose,</p>
<p>then later, even if you just drink the diet soda,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been shown that you secrete much more insulin,</p>
<p>the hormone that regulates blood glucose</p>
<p>in response to that diet soda.</p>
<p>Studies have been done in both adult humans</p>
<p>and in human children.</p>
<p>In general, when we say children, we mean human children,</p>
<p>but just to be very clear what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>exploring consuming diet soda with or without food,</p>
<p>then later consuming just the diet soda.</p>
<p>And what they found was having previously consumed</p>
<p>diet soda with food,</p>
<p>and then later only consuming the diet soda.</p>
<p>Of course, there isn&rsquo;t an increase in blood glucose</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not bringing in any calories</p>
<p>when they just drink the diet soda,</p>
<p>but there is a significant increase in insulin release.</p>
<p>And that is serious in a terrible way</p>
<p>because increased release of insulin</p>
<p>and so-called insulin sensitivity</p>
<p>is the basis for type two diabetes.</p>
<p>So much so that in the study with the children,</p>
<p>consuming non-caloric beverages in this way,</p>
<p>first with food and then on their own</p>
<p>led to increases in insulin that made them pre-diabetic</p>
<p>and they actually had to halt the study.</p>
<p>So I want to zoom out from this</p>
<p>and just really illustrate the major findings</p>
<p>and then talk about how this can be applied</p>
<p>in the positive sense.</p>
<p>I also want to mention what this means</p>
<p>in terms of your consumption of artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>of any kind.</p>
<p>So first of all,</p>
<p>the direct takeaway about artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>Artificial sweeteners are not bad for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say that.</p>
<p>What I am going to say is that whether or not</p>
<p>you ingest them alone,</p>
<p>or you ingest them in combination with foods</p>
<p>or as part of foods that raise blood glucose</p>
<p>is vitally important for your insulin management.</p>
<p>And the simple extract or tool from this</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re going to consume artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely best to consume those</p>
<p>away from any food that raises blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to enjoy diet soda, be my guest,</p>
<p>but do it not while consuming food,</p>
<p>in particular foods that raise blood glucose,</p>
<p>because what these studies show,</p>
<p>and I will provide references for these,</p>
<p>is that they can vastly disrupt blood sugar management</p>
<p>by way of the insulin glucose system, okay?</p>
<p>And actually, I&rsquo;ll just give you the reference now.</p>
<p>This is a paper from Dana Small&rsquo;s lab.</p>
<p>The first author is Dallenberg, D-A-L-L-E-N-B-E-R-G.</p>
<p>And the title of the paper</p>
<p>is Short-Term Consumption of Sucralose</p>
<p>With but Not Without Carbohydrate Impairs Neural</p>
<p>and Metabolic Sensitivity to Sugar in Humans.</p>
<p>This is a paper published in Cell Metabolism</p>
<p>in March of 2020.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very important paper</p>
<p>and similar findings have been addressed in mice</p>
<p>and in other studies.</p>
<p>And now because of this paper,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s now a bunch of other groups working on this issue.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evidence previously published in Nature,</p>
<p>excellent top tier journal,</p>
<p>sort of among the Super Bowl of top three journals</p>
<p>being Nature, Science, and Cell.</p>
<p>Paper published in Nature a few years back</p>
<p>showing that particular artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>can disrupt the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and have deleterious health effects.</p>
<p>That result I think stands,</p>
<p>although there are some results</p>
<p>that may not agree with that</p>
<p>depending on whether or not the artificial sweetener</p>
<p>is saccharin or sucralose or aspartame or stevia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>But what we are talking about here</p>
<p>is independent of the form of artificial</p>
<p>or non-caloric sweetener,</p>
<p>because it has everything to do with whether or not</p>
<p>there is a match or a mismatch between the perceived taste</p>
<p>and the effect of the thing that you are consuming</p>
<p>on blood sugar and metabolism.</p>
<p>So the first takeaway from this is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to consume artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really important that you do that</p>
<p>not in conjunction with foods that increase blood glucose.</p>
<p>Second of all, it points to the fact</p>
<p>that the foods that we prefer</p>
<p>and the activation of the dopamine system,</p>
<p>both through the gut and at the level of conscious taste,</p>
<p>in other words, what we like is very plastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mutable and we can change it.</p>
<p>How can we change it?</p>
<p>Well, earlier I mentioned a structure in the brain</p>
<p>called the insula,</p>
<p>this incredible structure that&rsquo;s involved in interoception</p>
<p>and interoception of all kinds.</p>
<p>In fact, just as an aside,</p>
<p>year or so ago, my lab published a paper showing that</p>
<p>activity within certain compartments of the insula</p>
<p>of humans is responding to a heightened state of anxiety</p>
<p>in the body.</p>
<p>It can respond to changes in our respiration,</p>
<p>changes in our heart rate.</p>
<p>So this is, again, it&rsquo;s a readout of our internal state,</p>
<p>not just of taste, but of many, many different aspects</p>
<p>of the mechanics and chemistry of our internal milieu</p>
<p>within our body.</p>
<p>All of the work that I was describing previously</p>
<p>has also been addressed at the neural level.</p>
<p>And using a broad brush to explain these results,</p>
<p>what we can say is when there is dopamine increase,</p>
<p>one sees activation of the so-called nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>which is part of the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about</p>
<p>the mesolimbic reward pathway and dopamine in general,</p>
<p>in humans and in animal studies and all the various</p>
<p>incredible and challenging things</p>
<p>that dopamine can do for us,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a episode all about dopamine that you can look up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to find at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>The increases in dopamine associated with sweet taste</p>
<p>and or blood glucose elevating foods and drinks</p>
<p>cause activation of the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not surprising.</p>
<p>Also in the circuit is activation of the so-called</p>
<p>arcuate nuclei within the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>These are areas of the hypothalamus that respond</p>
<p>to hormones from the body and respond to hormones</p>
<p>and neuropeptides in the brain,</p>
<p>as well as neural signals in the brain</p>
<p>to drive us to eat more or to stop eating.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>These are sort of the hypothalamus and the arcuate</p>
<p>being the motivating to eat or motivating to stop eating.</p>
<p>Both sets of neurons are contained there.</p>
<p>There are other areas like the lateral hypothalamus as well,</p>
<p>but hypothalamus is sort of the accelerator</p>
<p>and the brake on eating.</p>
<p>And then the nucleus accumbens and dopamine release</p>
<p>can be thought of as kind of a nitro boost,</p>
<p>if you will, like the kids say,</p>
<p>do the kids say that anymore?</p>
<p>Anyway, a nitro boost to increase what we call the gain</p>
<p>or the volume of how much you want more of something, okay?</p>
<p>When dopamine is present, it&rsquo;s this kind of generic signal</p>
<p>to go seek out more of whatever caused that release.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the insula,</p>
<p>this very thoughtful, rational, not really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not thinking, it&rsquo;s a brain area.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking, but it&rsquo;s part of the areas of your brain</p>
<p>that are interpreting what&rsquo;s going on in your body,</p>
<p>whether or not you feel good or not good,</p>
<p>whether or not you feel anxious, excited, or fearful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s integrating all that information</p>
<p>and fed into this entire circuit as well</p>
<p>are the inputs from your prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>which is your thinking, rational,</p>
<p>neuronal structure, if you will,</p>
<p>informing you, for instance,</p>
<p>ah, well, I don&rsquo;t really like salmon very much,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not so crazy about kale,</p>
<p>but it has omega-3s,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s rich in these polyphenols that are good for me.</p>
<p>And if one decides that they are going to eat these things,</p>
<p>not just because they are good for them,</p>
<p>but believe it or not,</p>
<p>if one takes the perception or adopts the perception</p>
<p>that they are both good for you</p>
<p>and that in being good for you,</p>
<p>they are good for your brain metabolism,</p>
<p>and that you desire to be healthy,</p>
<p>as crazy as it sounds,</p>
<p>those subjective signals of what you tell yourself</p>
<p>about the foods that you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>can actually impact how those foods will taste,</p>
<p>maybe not immediately, but eventually,</p>
<p>and can impact the way</p>
<p>in which your body utilizes those foods.</p>
<p>Now, that might seem like a absolute pipe dream.</p>
<p>If I just imagine that I like mackerel,</p>
<p>mackerel will start to taste good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that you could override yuck signals</p>
<p>with this mechanism.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that you could take a food</p>
<p>that would be absolutely noxious to you</p>
<p>or make you want to vomit and override that.</p>
<p>However, foods that are somewhat neutral to you</p>
<p>can take on a different value</p>
<p>based on the activation of the dopamine system.</p>
<p>And now, knowing what you know,</p>
<p>there are a couple of ways that you could imagine</p>
<p>doing that.</p>
<p>First of all, you could,</p>
<p>in this so-called gedanken or thought experiment,</p>
<p>you could, for instance, swap out sucralose,</p>
<p>because sucralose is just a taste, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an artificial sweet taste.</p>
<p>You could swap that out and insert kale,</p>
<p>but eat the kale with something</p>
<p>that raises blood glucose to some degree or another.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not encouraging anyone to run out there</p>
<p>and spike their blood glucose like crazy.</p>
<p>And in fact, blood glucose isn&rsquo;t really the goal.</p>
<p>If you recall, the goal is to get neurons</p>
<p>to be metabolically active with that blood glucose, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s actually rewarded</p>
<p>at a sub-subconscious level,</p>
<p>meaning at a deep subconscious level.</p>
<p>But consuming these foods with other foods</p>
<p>that increase blood glucose and thereby brain metabolism,</p>
<p>or I suppose if you&rsquo;re ketogenic,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the ketosis,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the range of foods</p>
<p>that are allowed on ketosis are,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t want to misspeak here and, you know,</p>
<p>say cracker, which would probably be a sin</p>
<p>in the context of ketosis, and no knock against ketosis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m offering this in part,</p>
<p>because I think that there are a number of people</p>
<p>that have and can positively benefit from a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>But for instance, if there&rsquo;s a food</p>
<p>that you want to consume more of,</p>
<p>but that you find somewhat meh or mildly yuck even,</p>
<p>pairing it with ketones,</p>
<p>if indeed you are using ketones for your brain metabolism,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what happens on the ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>over time, that food will be reinforced</p>
<p>by the dopamine pathway.</p>
<p>We know this from these studies</p>
<p>where sucralose was the substance paired</p>
<p>with the glucose elevating, in other words,</p>
<p>metabolically elevating food substance or liquid substance.</p>
<p>So how does one go about doing this?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I want to emphasize</p>
<p>that this experiment actually has been done</p>
<p>in a slightly different context.</p>
<p>Studies by my colleague, Aaliyah Crum,</p>
<p>in the psychology department at Stanford,</p>
<p>have explored the bodily response</p>
<p>in terms of insulin release and the release of other food</p>
<p>and eating related hormones,</p>
<p>as well as overall feelings of satisfaction, et cetera,</p>
<p>in groups of people that drink a milkshake</p>
<p>and are either told that it&rsquo;s a low calorie shake</p>
<p>that contains various nutrients that are good for them,</p>
<p>or a higher calorie shake</p>
<p>that has a lot of nutrients, et cetera.</p>
<p>And what they found was that the different groups,</p>
<p>and here, again, I&rsquo;m being very general</p>
<p>with my description of these studies,</p>
<p>but what they found is that the physiological response,</p>
<p>the insulin response, the blood glucose response,</p>
<p>and the subjective measures</p>
<p>of whether or not people enjoyed something or not,</p>
<p>were heavily influenced by what they were told</p>
<p>were in these milkshakes.</p>
<p>So blood glucose would go up, insulin would go up</p>
<p>when people were told it was a high calorie shake</p>
<p>with lots of nutrients,</p>
<p>less so when people ingested a shake</p>
<p>that they were told had less nutrients and so forth,</p>
<p>when in reality, it was the identical shake.</p>
<p>This is incredible.</p>
<p>This is a belief effect.</p>
<p>This is not placebo, right?</p>
<p>A placebo effect is different.</p>
<p>Placebo effect is in comparison.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where the control condition</p>
<p>actually influences outcomes to a same</p>
<p>or to some degree, just like the experimental condition.</p>
<p>This is not a placebo effect.</p>
<p>This is a belief effect where the belief</p>
<p>and the subjective thoughts</p>
<p>about what a given food will do</p>
<p>has a direct impact on a physiological measure</p>
<p>like blood sugar and blood glucose, okay?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s zoom out from this for a second</p>
<p>and think about how we can incorporate this</p>
<p>into adopting consumption of healthy foods</p>
<p>that serve our brain health in the immediate and long-term.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re wondering what those are,</p>
<p>I listed them out at the beginning of the episode</p>
<p>and their justification for being on that list.</p>
<p>What this means is obviously you want to consume foods</p>
<p>that you like, but because brain health is very important</p>
<p>and many of the foods that promote brain health</p>
<p>perhaps are not the most palatable to you</p>
<p>or desirable to you,</p>
<p>the key would be to ingest the foods</p>
<p>that you want to ingest more of</p>
<p>simply because they&rsquo;re good for you</p>
<p>and not because they taste good to you,</p>
<p>alongside foods that increase whatever fuel system</p>
<p>you happen to be relying on.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the most nutritionally</p>
<p>politically correct way to say it.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re keto, that would mean ketones, okay?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not ketogenic,</p>
<p>and I think most people probably are not in ketosis</p>
<p>or trying to maintain ketosis,</p>
<p>but for instance, people that are on</p>
<p>a purely plant-based diet,</p>
<p>that would be one set of foods.</p>
<p>For people that are omnivores, a different set of foods.</p>
<p>And for people that are carnivores, yet another set of foods.</p>
<p>If you want to eat more of a particular food</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s good for you,</p>
<p>pair it with something in the same meal.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to hide it physically</p>
<p>or in the flavor sense.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to hide it within that other food,</p>
<p>but pair it with that other food</p>
<p>that provides you a shift in brain metabolism</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really what your brain and you are seeking,</p>
<p>even though you don&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
<p>How long will this take?</p>
<p>Well, according to the data in humans on sucralose</p>
<p>and the conditioning for sucralose to have these effects,</p>
<p>which in many cases were detrimental, right?</p>
<p>Because they were increasing insulin.</p>
<p>But in this case, you&rsquo;re trying to hijack</p>
<p>this conditioning of food preference for healthy purposes,</p>
<p>not with sucralose,</p>
<p>but by ingesting things that are good for you.</p>
<p>Then the data really points to the fact that</p>
<p>even within a short period of time of about seven days,</p>
<p>but certainly within 14 days,</p>
<p>that food will take on a subjective experience</p>
<p>of tasting at least better to you, if not good to you.</p>
<p>Now, I believe this has important implications</p>
<p>for much of the controversy and food wars</p>
<p>that we see out there.</p>
<p>Food wars being, of course,</p>
<p>these groups that ardently subscribe to the idea</p>
<p>that their diet and the things that they are eating</p>
<p>are the foods that are good for us</p>
<p>and that are the most pleasurable</p>
<p>and the things that everyone should be eating.</p>
<p>We see this with every community within the nutrition realm.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are studies that point to the fact</p>
<p>that certain foods and food components are healthier,</p>
<p>probably for us and for the planet,</p>
<p>but you really see it on both ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got people who are on a pure carnivore diet</p>
<p>who are arguing with a lot of biomedical evidence</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s best for us and beneficial.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got people that are arguing</p>
<p>with the same general sets of arguments,</p>
<p>but for a purely plant-based diet.</p>
<p>And then I think most people fall</p>
<p>into the omnivore category.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s very clear, however,</p>
<p>is that what we consume on a regular basis</p>
<p>and what leads to increases in brain metabolism</p>
<p>leads to increases in dopamine</p>
<p>and thereby our motivation to eat them.</p>
<p>So what this really says is that what we tend to do regularly</p>
<p>becomes reinforcing in and of itself.</p>
<p>And I think in large part can explain the fact</p>
<p>that yes, indeed, for certain people,</p>
<p>a given diet not only feels good,</p>
<p>but they heavily subscribe to the nutrient</p>
<p>and kind of health beneficial effects of that diet.</p>
<p>And they often will provide evidence for that,</p>
<p>whether or not you ask them for it or not.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s true of every subcategory</p>
<p>within the nutrition realm.</p>
<p>Again, this is not to take away</p>
<p>from some of the beautiful data</p>
<p>emphasizing that certain foods and micronutrients, et cetera,</p>
<p>are better for us or worse for us and for the planet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a debate I want to get into right now.</p>
<p>What this emphasizes is that foods impact our brain</p>
<p>and its health, but they also impact</p>
<p>how our brain functions and responds to food.</p>
<p>And that is largely a learned response.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t completely override, for instance,</p>
<p>that certain foods evoke a strong yuck component.</p>
<p>Certain foods are truly putrid to us.</p>
<p>I should just say certain things are putrid to us</p>
<p>and we should not consume them, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s at the far end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hardwired for us to avoid those</p>
<p>because they can be dangerous for us.</p>
<p>They can make us very, very sick.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also true that if we continue to eat foods</p>
<p>that are progressively sweeter and sweeter</p>
<p>and highly palatable, it shifts our dopamine system</p>
<p>because it activates our dopamine system</p>
<p>to make us believe that those foods are the only foods</p>
<p>that can trigger this reward system</p>
<p>and make us feel good and that they taste good.</p>
<p>But after consuming foods that perhaps are less sweet</p>
<p>or even less savory, that are not what we would call highly,</p>
<p>or I would say nowadays it&rsquo;s super palatable foods,</p>
<p>we can adjust our sense, literally,</p>
<p>of what we perceive as an attractive and rewarding food.</p>
<p>And indeed the dopamine system</p>
<p>will reward those foods accordingly.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how much this learning</p>
<p>of associated food reward is important</p>
<p>for not just understanding why we like the foods that we eat</p>
<p>and how to eat more of foods that are healthy for us</p>
<p>and enjoy them, but it also speaks to the fact</p>
<p>that our brain as a whole is a perceptual device</p>
<p>trying to make guesses or estimations</p>
<p>about what certain foods are going to do for us.</p>
<p>So put simply, we don&rsquo;t just like sweet foods</p>
<p>because they taste good, we like them</p>
<p>because they predict a certain kind of metabolic response.</p>
<p>This is important also because Dana Small</p>
<p>and Ivan de Arrujo and others have been exploring</p>
<p>whether or not people, for instance,</p>
<p>that have type two diabetes or that suffer</p>
<p>from any number of different metabolic disorders,</p>
<p>whether or not somehow these food reward systems</p>
<p>are permanently disrupted.</p>
<p>And through a beautiful set of experiments</p>
<p>that have been done mainly by Dana Small&rsquo;s group at Yale,</p>
<p>but also by the de Arrujo group and others,</p>
<p>exploring how the reward pathways are altered</p>
<p>in various metabolic disorders, et cetera,</p>
<p>people suffering from type two diabetes.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have time to go into all those data now,</p>
<p>but the takeaway is that food preference</p>
<p>and the ability to reshape these circuits</p>
<p>is not disrupted in these people</p>
<p>to the point where it can&rsquo;t be rewired.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very encouraging because what it means</p>
<p>is that for people that are suffering from these syndromes</p>
<p>through some simple alterations in dietary choice,</p>
<p>provided those are carried out over time</p>
<p>and in the correct way by pairing with the foods</p>
<p>that will appropriately shift metabolism of the brain,</p>
<p>one can actually rewire what they consider</p>
<p>not just palatable, but attractive as foods.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about food reward</p>
<p>and food reinforcement,</p>
<p>because it turns out those are slightly different things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a wonderful review written by Ivan de Arrujo.</p>
<p>They have a middle author, Mark Schachter and Dana Small.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Rethinking Food Reward.</p>
<p>And it was published in the Annual Reviews of Psychology.</p>
<p>You can find it very easily online.</p>
<p>It was published in 2019.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautiful deep dive,</p>
<p>although quite accessible to most people</p>
<p>about how different foods and the way that we perceive them</p>
<p>impacts our brain and body and why we like the things</p>
<p>we like and how to reshape what we like.</p>
<p>So once again, we&rsquo;ve done a fairly extensive deep dive</p>
<p>into food and your brain,</p>
<p>focusing first on how particular foods</p>
<p>and compounds within foods that are available</p>
<p>also through supplementation can impact immediate</p>
<p>and long-term brain health.</p>
<p>Came up with a relatively short list</p>
<p>of what I would call super foods,</p>
<p>only because there are ample data to support their role</p>
<p>in enhancing short and long-term cognition</p>
<p>and neuronal health and so on.</p>
<p>And we also talked about food preference</p>
<p>and why particular tastes and particular events</p>
<p>within the gut and particular events within the brain</p>
<p>combine to lead us to pursue particular foods</p>
<p>and to avoid other foods</p>
<p>and how you can leverage those pathways</p>
<p>in order to pursue more of the foods</p>
<p>that are going to be good for you</p>
<p>and good not just for your brain,</p>
<p>but for your overall body health</p>
<p>and to enjoy them along the way.</p>
