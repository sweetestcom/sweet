    <p>The following is a conversation with Kelsey Sharon, Canadian Forces veteran, artillery</p>
<p>gunner who served in Afghanistan at 18 years old and came home with severe PTSD.</p>
<p>She went on to found Brass in Unity which creates unique jewellery, large part of the</p>
<p>proceeds from which go to help rehabilitate the lives, limbs and mental health of veterans</p>
<p>and first responders.</p>
<p>She has a big personality, big heart and an intense passion for life.</p>
<p>So when our paths happened to cross, I knew we needed to talk.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, to support it please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Kelsey Sharon.</p>
<p>You mentioned that studying history had a big impact on you and that your grandfather</p>
<p>was a World War II vet.</p>
<p>So people that have gone through World War II, in my family too, they don&rsquo;t seem to talk</p>
<p>about it much.</p>
<p>Like the worse the tragedy, the less they talk about it.</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s understandable, I can respect that, but I don&rsquo;t think people fully understood</p>
<p>the value in human stories over time and sharing that, that certain civilizations don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>written language.</p>
<p>The value in that being passed down is extraordinary, but we didn&rsquo;t really have that with the World</p>
<p>War II vets it seems like.</p>
<p>Well, they kind of want to protect you from the pain.</p>
<p>My grandmother went through Holland and Moore, which is the Ukrainian starvation of millions</p>
<p>of people, and then obviously went through World War II with the Nazi occupation.</p>
<p>And same on the grandfather&rsquo;s side who, on my dad&rsquo;s side, grandfather fought in World</p>
<p>War II.</p>
<p>So they seem to not want to talk about those experiences to protect you from the suffering,</p>
<p>to protect you from the evil that they&rsquo;ve experienced, which is sad because the lessons</p>
<p>from that history are not then propagated through you.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s something about the strength you carry with you knowing that that&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>your blood.</p>
<p>Those great heroes are in your blood and that&rsquo;s suffering, overcoming that suffering is in</p>
<p>your blood.</p>
<p>I would argue that&rsquo;s exactly correct.</p>
<p>If you have someone you know that comes from your lineage that has done something super</p>
<p>gnarly, that&rsquo;s just been a badass and in so many different ways, you want to know about</p>
<p>that person.</p>
<p>You have that person&rsquo;s blood in you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important to acknowledge and when that isn&rsquo;t shared, I feel like it&rsquo;s just a detriment</p>
<p>to that individual.</p>
<p>What do you make of World War II?</p>
<p>In terms of history, do you think about those kinds of wars where two times more civilians</p>
<p>died than the number of military personnel?</p>
<p>So most of the war is basically just the death of civilians and the invasion of homes, the</p>
<p>burning of homes, the bombing of homes, all of that.</p>
<p>World War II for me, I find that was the first experience where I became just obsessed with</p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>World War II really did it for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because of the dramatization of film and TV and the way that our generation</p>
<p>has looked at it, but for me, it was more than that.</p>
<p>I felt a deep connection to it and I still can&rsquo;t figure out why, like a pull almost.</p>
<p>People joke around about those past lives and those things or those connections and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something deeper within me that feels a pull towards that and I&rsquo;m not quite sure</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s because I had family that escaped Hungary once the Soviets came in, so thanks</p>
<p>for that, or if it was because my grandfather served in it or for whatever reason, I have</p>
<p>this pull to it.</p>
<p>And so when you think about the mass casualty of the civilian population, that&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>for me to wrap my brain around after being in a war and seeing when you have a small</p>
<p>subset of civilians die, how much of an impact that has on that community right there in</p>
<p>just a tiny area.</p>
<p>So to try to wrap my brain around what happened in Europe and all across and all of that,</p>
<p>I really struggle with that because I don&rsquo;t know that I can comprehend what that would</p>
<p>truly mean to somebody if I didn&rsquo;t experience it or see it for what it is.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So first of all, you&rsquo;re right, a lot of people are drawn to World War II for different reasons.</p>
<p>The one is Hitler and Stalin trying to understand how it&rsquo;s possible to have that scale of evil</p>
<p>in very different flavors of evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost fascinating that human nature can allow for that.</p>
<p>And then also it&rsquo;s fascinating that so many people can follow leaders like that with a</p>
<p>pride and with a love of country.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s almost like this weird experiment, it&rsquo;s like, wow, I wonder if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>made from the same cloth as those people.</p>
<p>Like would I be a good German if I lived in Germany and was, you know, during the time</p>
<p>of Hitler?</p>
<p>Would I believe that Germany has been done wrong, I&rsquo;m Jewish by the way, which makes</p>
<p>me a little bit more comfortable talking about this, is would I believe in the dream sold</p>
<p>by a charismatic dictator who says that wrongs have been done and we need to correct those</p>
<p>wrongs?</p>
<p>That to me, this is the compelling thing that draws me to World War II, the human nature</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>I would agree with you on that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a way to look at people like that.</p>
<p>And at that time there was no real, well, there wasn&rsquo;t a full understanding of the psyche</p>
<p>the way that we&rsquo;re starting to, I mean, we still don&rsquo;t understand any of it, but it seems</p>
<p>like the time gap back then, there was no real understanding of sociopaths and narcissists</p>
<p>and psychopaths and really what those traits were.</p>
<p>And I feel like people will follow blindly if they&rsquo;re given a good enough reason.</p>
<p>Well, if you have an individual who is ranting and screaming at the top of his lungs in the</p>
<p>middle of these town squares and he&rsquo;s getting this attention, it&rsquo;s human nature to want</p>
<p>to understand and be a part of a group mentality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s human nature to want to fit in.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s more of people were at the beginning were just, this is the</p>
<p>cool thing to do.</p>
<p>Or if it was, they were genuinely terrified.</p>
<p>Or if there was an aspect that was like, this guy is saying something that resonates with</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>There could be a lot of different things.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s unfortunate that we didn&rsquo;t get to, or no one got to really examine this individual&rsquo;s</p>
<p>brain and this person and why they thought the way they thought.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s always been the biggest thing for me is I&rsquo;m really curious about why people</p>
<p>do what they do, like deeply, deeply curious about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure who&rsquo;s more interesting, the people that follow Hitler or Hitler himself.</p>
<p>So I mean, the question that&rsquo;s coupled with that is, would history roll out in similar</p>
<p>ways even if there wasn&rsquo;t a Hitler?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the people that created Hitler or did Hitler create the events of World War II?</p>
<p>I think the people would be more interesting in my opinion.</p>
<p>That seems to be the, that the charismatic leaders are all out there.</p>
<p>The failed artists in the case of Hitler, they&rsquo;re all out there and it&rsquo;s just when there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this environment of anger and fear, charismatic leaders can take over and it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re evil or good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a roll of the dice in terms of history, how evil, how truly insane they are.</p>
<p>I think Stalin was much more cold in calculating.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t as insane as Hitler.</p>
<p>Hitler was legitimately insane, like especially later on in the war where he would do irrational</p>
<p>actions I would say.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like a weird roll of the dice.</p>
<p>You could have gotten a totally different leader.</p>
<p>Wanting to take over the entirety of Europe and then invading Russia, that&rsquo;s like insanity.</p>
<p>Yeah, just even, just the first part of that wanting to take over Europe, if you really</p>
<p>think about the scale, if you really sit down and go, this one individual was like, I want</p>
<p>all of this.</p>
<p>If you really sat down and you were to sit down and put him in his traits that we know</p>
<p>of into any sort of document nowadays that deems somebody a psychopath or a narcissist,</p>
<p>this guy would set it on fire.</p>
<p>He himself was so, I think so damaged and he reminds me a lot of people now who struggle</p>
<p>to find their way.</p>
<p>He reminds me a lot of angry individuals who are told no, either by women or by business</p>
<p>or by whatever the sector they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>He reminds me very much of that like, what&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for?</p>
<p>Just that individual who&rsquo;s just like, the world is shit and the world owes me everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that mentality.</p>
<p>He really came from that it seems like.</p>
<p>And when you foster that too long, you get that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book called, what is it, Man From Underground by Dostoevsky, I might be misnaming</p>
<p>the book, but it&rsquo;s about the bitterness of a man.</p>
<p>It breeds within his mind and it just grows, that bitterness.</p>
<p>I mean, we all have that sort of resenting of the world when you&rsquo;re younger, when you</p>
<p>have a choice.</p>
<p>When you fail, do you blame the world or do you hold, it&rsquo;s the Jaco thing, do you carry</p>
<p>the responsibility of that and become a better man or woman because of that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the decision.</p>
<p>And in some sense, I mean, unfortunately, see that&rsquo;s because he took responsibility</p>
<p>and leadership.</p>
<p>I know you can&rsquo;t say he wasn&rsquo;t a leader.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s a failure.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a failure, but you can&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s powerless, did not take action.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s just basically a embodiment of the anger and the fear of people at the time.</p>
<p>But the insanity of, obviously, many of my relatives, not just murdering them, but putting</p>
<p>them in camps and torturing them, but many of those people, Jewish people, were also</p>
<p>some of the best scientists.</p>
<p>The insanity of murdering some of the best Germans, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s fascinating to kind of look back at that time in history and think,</p>
<p>are these the same humans?</p>
<p>And also, are there echoes of that now?</p>
<p>And is that going to happen again?</p>
<p>Is there going to be a World War III in some other kind of way?</p>
<p>Is there going to be some mass scale injustice in some other kind of way, which we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>yet, because of our blindness and maybe not learning the lessons of history, will allow</p>
<p>it to happen again?</p>
<p>And then obviously, it&rsquo;s a very common thing to whatever political leader you don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>to call them Hitler.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Which is, that to me, I got to tell you, when somebody calls somebody Hitler, the weight</p>
<p>behind that has been completely lost in this generation.</p>
<p>This generation does not understand what that truly means to call someone Hitler or a Nazi.</p>
<p>Or Stalin.</p>
<p>To be honest, the starvation, I&rsquo;ve just been talking to a lot of folks recently, especially</p>
<p>like North Korea, with Wyoming Park, starvation.</p>
<p>And I remember from my grandmother, it wasn&rsquo;t, time and time again, not having food to eat</p>
<p>is the thing that people say is the worst, everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way worse than murder, not having food, and the places that takes your mind and the</p>
<p>actions that forces you to do, that&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>And all of that seems very distant in our history.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love her.</p>
<p>I watched that interview with her.</p>
<p>She is, I want to talk to that woman so bad, because when she was on Joe and she sat there</p>
<p>and said, Joe&rsquo;s like, do you, have you done any therapy?</p>
<p>And she laughed.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s my girl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a fascinating, I mean, I would love for you to kind of talk to her and explore</p>
<p>her mind, because we kind of explored her story and that&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s power and importance</p>
<p>to her story, but it&rsquo;s so difficult to understand, like, how does she become healthier and better?</p>
<p>Even more so than she&rsquo;s already, she&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s recovered quite a bit, you know, she&rsquo;s found</p>
<p>herself quite a bit, but I wonder, is she haunted?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying questions I want to ask.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s what I mean, because after being in a war, there are certain things, there</p>
<p>are certain atrocities that you see that, it doesn&rsquo;t matter the therapy that you do.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t care what all the special ops guys say, like, I know plenty of them that</p>
<p>have a light switch and they turn it off and they can function, but I also know them when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been out for 10 years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things that haunt people differently, but there&rsquo;s no way, there&rsquo;s not something</p>
<p>going on there deeply.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s also extra levels of complexity in her case because, I mean, this is what,</p>
<p>just looking at history about family, is she spent much of her early life loving the dictator,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We like the water or something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We like water or we like this because there is no, like, individual, like, when they said</p>
<p>there was no love or anything.</p>
<p>But there is a love for the&hellip;</p>
<p>Just that individual.</p>
<p>For that individual.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, it&rsquo;s like the ultimate abusive relationship.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still love, like you don&rsquo;t know the alternative.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not even, it&rsquo;s complicated because, like, I wonder if she truly explored it what</p>
<p>you would find because the trauma, much of her trauma, I think comes from when she was</p>
<p>escaping North Korea, treatment by China.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the&hellip;</p>
<p>And her mom and what she had to witness within that and being helpless with that on her own.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like evil men essentially abusing her, trading her, you know, and doing so nonchalantly,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s part of just the way of life that I wonder if she sees kind of, yeah, it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>complicated because childhood&hellip;</p>
<p>It would be normal to her because she didn&rsquo;t know any different.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Like I grew up poor, but I never sensed that.</p>
<p>Because your parents didn&rsquo;t make you.</p>
<p>Well, and everyone else around was too.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t notice it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a cultural thing.</p>
<p>So the way you grow up, you only start to notice it when you compare yourself to others,</p>
<p>when you learn of the alternative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dark reality when you&rsquo;re abused.</p>
<p>You truly begin to suffer in some kind of way when you understand that you were being</p>
<p>abused.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a dark kind of thought that I wonder if you live your whole life just in that abuse,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know better, that that&rsquo;s a safer&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s a better life, suffering and then learning that you were suffering</p>
<p>or just suffering until your last days.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two ways to look at this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d argue on one side that suffering and suffering until you die, you know no different.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t have hope.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have this idea that there&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>And sometimes that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Keep that in its box.</p>
<p>But then if you have kind of what you have with Park where she knows now that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different, she knows that there&rsquo;s better, then you run into those.</p>
<p>What is the damage that has been done?</p>
<p>What is going to be passed on as intergenerational trauma?</p>
<p>I know she&rsquo;s a mom.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, now you got to look long term a little bit because now she&rsquo;s an influence</p>
<p>on a child.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a positive to looking at both, I would say.</p>
<p>And I know that sounds horrible for the living in trauma your whole life and just not knowing</p>
<p>any better.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that saves the brain and the body and just that overall or if it actually</p>
<p>would be better because there&rsquo;s no way to really find that out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think.</p>
<p>But the reality is when you give people hope and you make them realize that they&rsquo;re suffering,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting a burden on them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first step on a long journey.</p>
<p>And so, and obviously now that she knows that the suffering she wants to make people in</p>
<p>North Korea currently suffer less.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an admirable goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we do to each other is try to like, when you see suffering in the world, you try</p>
<p>to make it better and unmask that&rsquo;s probably in a long arc of history going to make for</p>
<p>a better world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful at that idea for North Korea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful for that because you never want to leave individuals suffering when you know</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re actively suffering while you&rsquo;re just living your day to day life in the Western</p>
<p>world just out grocery shopping and you see all this food and you know in the back of</p>
<p>your mind&hellip;</p>
<p>Like that interview fucked me up a little bit, I won&rsquo;t lie.</p>
<p>And I had some of the girls in my office listen to it, they&rsquo;re just bawling.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re all parents and there&rsquo;s this idea that not being able to feed our children,</p>
<p>just the idea of that damages the psyche.</p>
<p>It brings up the pain in the chest, just the idea of it.</p>
<p>And so going to the grocery store for about a week after that, I just remember standing</p>
<p>there looking and just going, fuck are we doing?</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s that snap reality that comes into play and goes, so how do we fix that?</p>
<p>You got to take on China, that&rsquo;s never going to happen.</p>
<p>And the reason that&rsquo;s not going to happen, it&rsquo;s happening again.</p>
<p>So Akhani comes down through Afghanistan, Chinese are all through Afghanistan, Iran</p>
<p>makes the deal with China for the roadway to get the oil, well that&rsquo;s done in the blink</p>
<p>of an eye without anyone knowing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so much at play with China, they control such a large aspect of our world,</p>
<p>unfortunately that to take and free North Korea, a drastic action would have to happen.</p>
<p>And then your people would come in, it would be a mess.</p>
<p>What do you mean your people?</p>
<p>Your Russians.</p>
<p>Did you hear what she said about Russians?</p>
<p>Did you hear what she says?</p>
<p>Russians?</p>
<p>I love Russians.</p>
<p>You know what I didn&rsquo;t love?</p>
<p>The Russian recruiting video that came out, that shit was terrifying.</p>
<p>Did you watch it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I told you about it and of course you didn&rsquo;t watch it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t watch it, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>The USA put out a recruiting video and then like a day or two later Russia put one out.</p>
<p>And the recruiting video in the States was an animation of a female soldier with two</p>
<p>moms and she was going to go change the world, right?</p>
<p>Russia came out with one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the character from like Rocky essentially and they&rsquo;re guys in the mud and</p>
<p>just in the rain just fucking doing pushups, just pushing it out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like, they see their boot, they&rsquo;re just like crushing things and I&rsquo;m like, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all like, and the deep Russian voice, I&rsquo;m like, oh my God.</p>
<p>Which one is better would you say?</p>
<p>Which bothered you more?</p>
<p>What do you mean by bother, specify.</p>
<p>So deception is a funny thing because when you&rsquo;re young and you&rsquo;re choosing to go to</p>
<p>the military or not, it&rsquo;s not like you know, like none of us know what the best trajectory</p>
<p>for a life is.</p>
<p>For many people going to the military is a really, makes them incredible human beings.</p>
<p>Some of the best people in this world I know are soldiers.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t mean like it&rsquo;s somehow bad to go to the military.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great choice, but there is something, the honest truth is I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like marketing people.</p>
<p>And so this is essentially a marketing effort.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a marketing effort.</p>
<p>So which one do you like as a marketing effort better?</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I do.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Cause Canada doesn&rsquo;t, you know what our recruiting videos are?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I love it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the best.</p>
<p>Sorry, eh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, fuck.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting.</p>
<p>It started.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>So Canada does these ones where it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;ll have a bunch of like soldiers doing</p>
<p>movements and then they&rsquo;ll like snip it together really quick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be like a Navy one and a guy jumping out of a plane and then it&rsquo;ll be like an artillery</p>
<p>and then like an armored and it&rsquo;d be like, join the Canadian forces today.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s like their, their videos.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like very marketable, very palatable to Canadians who don&rsquo;t really want war and</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t really acknowledge their military in the first place and do everything they</p>
<p>can to make sure that vets don&rsquo;t get any support when they come home.</p>
<p>So they, I can see why that one is acceptable.</p>
<p>What Russia did was meant to be more of an intimidation tactic in my opinion.</p>
<p>I like that style better though.</p>
<p>I think we need harder, I think we need people to be harder.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s acceptable and okay to say that our soldiers need to have a harder mindset,</p>
<p>a stronger mindset, a better mentality and mental health support going into the service</p>
<p>and a harder body because I know when you go to the US, I&rsquo;ve also encountered plenty</p>
<p>of soldiers that are 600 pounds.</p>
<p>What are you going to do?</p>
<p>So we should say that you, when you joined the military, you were in incredible shape</p>
<p>or not maybe incredible, but very good shape.</p>
<p>No, I was in incredible shape.</p>
<p>It was the best shape of my life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I, you know what?</p>
<p>I used to do sit ups.</p>
<p>Like no, I would do sit ups in the morning when I was little until I could see my six.</p>
<p>Like I always had a six pack because all I did was train.</p>
<p>But like if I couldn&rsquo;t like see it, I would just sit there in morning cartoons and just</p>
<p>do sit ups.</p>
<p>And my mom and dad thought that was like normal acceptable behavior.</p>
<p>So if you had like Instagram back then, you&rsquo;d be a David Goggins, you would be just like</p>
<p>screaming.</p>
<p>Without the cursing.</p>
<p>That cursing started once the military started.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So I mean, the people should know, is it probably already know that you also competed in Taekwondo,</p>
<p>like you were an athlete of all kinds.</p>
<p>They even saw rugby in there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was, I was, I was good at rugby.</p>
<p>I played that for seven, six years, I guess you could say total.</p>
<p>I think the worst injury I ever ended up having was I tore my right eyelid off.</p>
<p>We were doing an exhibition game.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do exhibition games well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do like for fun well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do like.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re very competitive.</p>
<p>No, not me.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re being funny.</p>
<p>Ah, there it is.</p>
<p>He gets it.</p>
<p>You see, he&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;s not a robot.</p>
<p>What I was saying though to you was that we did an exhibition game and the team ahead</p>
<p>was winning.</p>
<p>The team we were playing was winning, which was annoying.</p>
<p>And so there was an opportunity to take out a girl that was going one end of the field</p>
<p>to the other and she just kept hitting tries left, right and center.</p>
<p>She was fast.</p>
<p>So I figured if I just aimed her up, like she&rsquo;s a target and I just run full force at</p>
<p>her because she was really, she was a tall individual, but I just, if I do that, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>take her out of the knees.</p>
<p>So I did that.</p>
<p>But that, what that resulted in was she put her tooth through her mouth guard and knocked</p>
<p>out and didn&rsquo;t just, she just stayed there.</p>
<p>But when I stood up, I tore the right eyelid off and it was hanging from the inner corner.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My mom was there cause mom was my mom&rsquo;s, my biggest fan and she&rsquo;s supportive of everything</p>
<p>and she didn&rsquo;t miss a game.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t miss an anything.</p>
<p>And um, I stood up and I kind of turned around and we already had a girl break her nose that</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>So she was on the sideline with her nose sideways and just bloody.</p>
<p>My mom was like, I&rsquo;ll take her to the emergency after once the game&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>And so I turned around and looked at her and she just, she almost vomited on the spot and</p>
<p>I was like, what&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t move your eyelids off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, but I can see like I was trying to blink, but like it was just down so I could</p>
<p>just constantly see.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re just, we&rsquo;re just going to go to the emergency.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just going to go there now.</p>
<p>Was there blood?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of it, but I couldn&rsquo;t really tell.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Were you okay with blood at that point?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess you did taekwondo and all that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get knocked out very often.</p>
<p>Like when I was younger in taekwondo, I was really good.</p>
<p>I only lost a handful of times.</p>
<p>So when I did lose, that was bad.</p>
<p>But I never had like a broken nose or a lot of blood on my face, like nothing like that</p>
<p>really.</p>
<p>So nothing freaked me out too much.</p>
<p>Was there aggression there or just purely competition over skill?</p>
<p>A mix of both.</p>
<p>I was, this was right after, not too long after my coach went to prison for statutory</p>
<p>rape and that was like how you talk about Park talking about how that was like she knew</p>
<p>love because of that person.</p>
<p>That person was like a God to me.</p>
<p>And so when that happened, I was just an angry individual from that point on.</p>
<p>So there was competition and aggression mixed in there.</p>
<p>Oh, like it was betrayal that there&rsquo;s just somebody that is, was a symbol of love for</p>
<p>you, could also be a very bad person.</p>
<p>I used to eat, sleep, and breathe whatever that man said from four years old on.</p>
<p>I lived with my coaches at a point so I could train that much.</p>
<p>I helped look after their daughter.</p>
<p>I was at the club 24 seven.</p>
<p>It just the idea that somebody could do something like that, yeah, that really messed me up.</p>
<p>Where were you on 9 11?</p>
<p>I was 11 and I was in my parents basement.</p>
<p>In where?</p>
<p>Ontario.</p>
<p>Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>What did you think of 9 11 at that age from Canada that have an impact on you in terms</p>
<p>of changing the level of evil you thought is there in the world today?</p>
<p>Not initially.</p>
<p>I remember it really vividly.</p>
<p>I have a decent memory for certain things.</p>
<p>It seems like stuff like that I stick with really well.</p>
<p>I remember watching it.</p>
<p>I was sitting on the couch and my mom called my dad because my parents are truck drivers.</p>
<p>My dad was on the road, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, and he would go in and out of cities all the</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>I think he was on the East Coast.</p>
<p>My mom was a little panicky.</p>
<p>She tried to get a hold of him.</p>
<p>I think at the time it was beepers and yeah, so he would get a beep, he would go to a payphone</p>
<p>and call us.</p>
<p>He was fine.</p>
<p>I remember my mom being really upset and I couldn&rsquo;t quite grasp why she was so upset.</p>
<p>I knew something really bad had happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when I then saw the second plane go into the tower and I remember her just like the</p>
<p>stereotypical like hand over her mouth and she just felt sick and she just was so confused</p>
<p>and I knew it was bad, but I didn&rsquo;t fully grasp it.</p>
<p>We went to school that day and they had talked about it briefly.</p>
<p>You could hear the teachers kind of reminiscing about it.</p>
<p>There was a point that week that all of a sudden all of the children who were from a</p>
<p>Middle Eastern family were not at school.</p>
<p>I just remember them saying like a lot of people aren&rsquo;t coming to school, but it was</p>
<p>in particular.</p>
<p>I think parents were afraid once it got out that it was of a certain group.</p>
<p>They were afraid for their own kids and fair enough, I mean, you never know.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know and I knew it impacted me enough that I did write.</p>
<p>I remember the school was doing a memorial for it and I remember they asked, I wrote</p>
<p>a poem and a reporter was there and I read it on air.</p>
<p>I remember it was a very short one, but I remember I wanted to do something, but I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why or for what reason.</p>
<p>I knew I wanted to do something to honor it, but I couldn&rsquo;t grasp why.</p>
<p>You eventually went to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Did that begin to plant the seed of thinking about conflict in the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I never thought about it that in depth.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve done 12 years of therapy.</p>
<p>You think that would have come up, Dr. Passi, but apparently not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll work on it though.</p>
<p>I mean, when did the idea of war start entering your mind?</p>
<p>Late high school, I think it was for me.</p>
<p>I finished high school at 17.</p>
<p>I moved away and went to college, I went to Algonquin College because I wasn&rsquo;t smart enough</p>
<p>to get into Ottawa U. I was like, well, Algonquin, cheers.</p>
<p>I just wanted to play sports and frankly, I wanted away from my small town that I was</p>
<p>living in.</p>
<p>I went through a bad high school breakup as a kid and you know that where you think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the love of your life and you just can&rsquo;t bear to be anywhere near anybody.</p>
<p>I moved away as fast as I possibly could.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t grasp it still at that point.</p>
<p>Love and heartbreak.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Why did you become a soldier?</p>
<p>Why did you want to become a soldier?</p>
<p>My parents told me from an early age, they always figured I would either be a cop.</p>
<p>I would do, they didn&rsquo;t think military, but they thought it would be like a type A personality,</p>
<p>possibly carry a gun situation and I&rsquo;d never hunted before.</p>
<p>We never had guns in our house.</p>
<p>I was never exposed to weapons of any kind.</p>
<p>If anything, it was the opposite.</p>
<p>All the hunters on the property, like all the deer would come to our property and all</p>
<p>the hunters would be, no, I&rsquo;m not, my mom would put salt licks out so that they wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get killed.</p>
<p>Your property was the safe space for the deer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was 17 acres of forest and they just, we had two turkeys that used to walk up and down</p>
<p>the driveway every day.</p>
<p>We had bears in there and nobody bothered them.</p>
<p>And so there was no aspect of like, I want to go kill shit, that was not like a thing.</p>
<p>I had no idea I wanted to take anybody off the face of the earth or any thing.</p>
<p>I went to school and because I&rsquo;m a history person, my parents has always made it really</p>
<p>important that Remembrance Day is the thing in our life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Veterans Day for you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s November 11th and it&rsquo;s, you go, you honor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you don&rsquo;t want to go, I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s raining, you go.</p>
<p>And so I went to the Remembrance Day ceremony in Ottawa that year, which was, it&rsquo;s our capital,</p>
<p>which is, yeah, it&rsquo;s our capital and it&rsquo;s really small.</p>
<p>And so I went, but I took the bus and I was on the bus back to Algonquin.</p>
<p>And I met a lady who was like a World War II vet, really old lady, she had an Air Force</p>
<p>uniform on and just like this row of medals.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think you can tell by our limited to extreme interactions we&rsquo;ve had over the</p>
<p>short period of time, I&rsquo;m curious and I&rsquo;ll just ask you.</p>
<p>And so I just got up and talked to her and just started talking to her.</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t say like, I don&rsquo;t remember exactly her words, but she served, she was</p>
<p>one of the first females to fly and all of these kinds of things that stuck in my head.</p>
<p>And we just kind of kept talking and I missed my stop.</p>
<p>And then I finished talking to her and I got back on the bus and went back to the college</p>
<p>and walked into my small apartment where I had two roommates, these two guys I went to</p>
<p>high school with, one of them I went to high school with, one was from out of town.</p>
<p>And I just didn&rsquo;t like what I was, I wasn&rsquo;t happy, I wasn&rsquo;t doing what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted to do truthfully.</p>
<p>Something just said, why don&rsquo;t you join the army?</p>
<p>Like in myself, my self talk was like, let&rsquo;s just join the military, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Are you in general somebody that just follows the gut, like when your heart tells you something,</p>
<p>you go with it?</p>
<p>For the most part, because I figured out, at least now I figured out what parts I could,</p>
<p>like what feeling I can trust and which one I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Which one&rsquo;s anxiety versus which one&rsquo;s my actual intuition talking.</p>
<p>So why did you sign up to be an artillery gunner?</p>
<p>Because they wouldn&rsquo;t let me be infantry.</p>
<p>I mean, why would you want to be infantry?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re naming a lot of dangerous activities.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that wasn&rsquo;t a thought in my mind at the time.</p>
<p>My idea was if I was going to do this and I was going to put myself through the bullshit</p>
<p>and the training and all of the hell and the pushups and the screaming dad, I wanted to</p>
<p>do something that I know was actually going to be affecting something.</p>
<p>And what I knew was making change or affecting or on the front lines was infantry, artillery</p>
<p>or armored.</p>
<p>So I was like, one of those.</p>
<p>Can you explain the difference, infantry, artillery and armored?</p>
<p>Do you want like the layman&rsquo;s term or do you want me to actually explain, explain?</p>
<p>Well, listening to your conversation with Jaco, especially, I love how you get into</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s detail this then.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So infantry is your frontline door kicking, you know, blasting the door open, running</p>
<p>and get the fuck on the ground, just that, that, that, that, that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the guys that, you know, double tap you in the face and they show up in the middle</p>
<p>of the night and put a barrel in your head.</p>
<p>Like those are the guys that are sleeping in the trenches, that are eating MREs, who</p>
<p>are being shot at, who are being blown up, who are doing the dirty work and not sleeping</p>
<p>and carrying the a hundred pound pack and, and are side by side with your buddies in</p>
<p>the trenches.</p>
<p>I wanted that.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>They said it was too small for that.</p>
<p>So then&hellip;</p>
<p>You were, sorry to interrupt, you were too small under a hundred pounds?</p>
<p>At the time I was about 103 and I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m five foot, like on a, if you roll my back out,</p>
<p>like I really try, I&rsquo;m five foot.</p>
<p>At the time though, I think my, my license said 411, so.</p>
<p>So you were too small for infantry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They just, like, there was no mandate at which they said you can&rsquo;t be, but they said, you</p>
<p>know, we don&rsquo;t want to put you through training that you&rsquo;re going to fail out of and then</p>
<p>have to recourse you and then find a new job for you.</p>
<p>And they want to try to, this is what you&rsquo;re going in for.</p>
<p>They want to have you follow through that path.</p>
<p>So then there was armored, which are your tanks.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s your movie like Fury where your tank battles and, which we don&rsquo;t really do</p>
<p>anymore, but you&rsquo;re rolling around in tanks, you&rsquo;ve got guys in the back or you&rsquo;re a driver,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a turret gunner, which I would have enjoyed, but the idea of being in a closed</p>
<p>metal box, something about it made me panic.</p>
<p>So I was like, maybe not for me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s of course power to that kind of a big gun.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why I went for the bigger one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>By the way, think of Russia leads the world in number of tanks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still, it&rsquo;s very like, what is it, alpha demonstration of like, look, we have largest</p>
<p>number of tanks.</p>
<p>You know what takes tanks out though?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Some gasoline, some old batteries and a wire.</p>
<p>Yeah, but tanks still look badass.</p>
<p>They look great, but they don&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>But so much of the military, like we said with the recruiting videos, it&rsquo;s a display</p>
<p>of power versus the actual implementation of power.</p>
<p>Fair.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Artillery.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m doing my best here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what double tap means, which you said earlier, it means two shots to the</p>
<p>face.</p>
<p>Why two?</p>
<p>To be sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You guys, taxpayers pay for the ammo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>So, but you don&rsquo;t want to do three because that&rsquo;s wasting the ammo.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s now that&rsquo;s a waste.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Double tap to the face.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much awesome terminology here or gruesome terminology, depending on your</p>
<p>perspective.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So artillery.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the hand of God.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s intensely a romanticized version, but okay, artillery, the hand of God.</p>
<p>So it will reach out and touch you from wherever we want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like F18 pilots or bombers.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re there until they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>And so for artillery, I really honestly didn&rsquo;t think artillery would be a fit for me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know much about it.</p>
<p>They were just like, these are what you can pick from.</p>
<p>And I was like, I&rsquo;ll go here.</p>
<p>So in World War II, they used much closer artillery.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re called the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery because the Queen made us Royal Canadian Artillery.</p>
<p>And we shoot these rounds.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in training, you shoot smaller, smaller ammunition.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re about 40 pounds.</p>
<p>They go, I&rsquo;m going to get this wrong, 20 K, 20 kilometers.</p>
<p>So whatever that is in your mile things.</p>
<p>And they have a casing on them and they&rsquo;re much easier.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re easier to handle.</p>
<p>The guns are smaller.</p>
<p>You need less people for them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically what you train on nowadays.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what we use overseas.</p>
<p>What we use overseas, now those things are beautiful.</p>
<p>Those are just a sheer work of the engineering behind them just makes my heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>Yeah, the engineering on modern guns is amazing.</p>
<p>So are we talking about machine guns here?</p>
<p>So fully automatic?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re talking about an artillery gun.</p>
<p>So what it is, it&rsquo;s a 155 millimeter howitzer that shoots up to up to 40 kilometers accurately,</p>
<p>45 unrecorded and it shoots a hundred pound round.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So that, but there is still precision.</p>
<p>Accurate as hell.</p>
<p>Accurate.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Accurate if the people behind it that are shooting it and aiming it are accurate.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So how, at which stage of the warfare do they come in?</p>
<p>Are they saving you?</p>
<p>Like say a bunch of people get raided, a bunch of the sole infantry get raided and then the</p>
<p>artillery saves them or are they the first line of attack or what are they, where does</p>
<p>the artillery go?</p>
<p>Like the hand of God presumes they&rsquo;re helping.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, well, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So depending on the operation or whomever is running it or how they want it done, sometimes</p>
<p>if they just know there&rsquo;s targets, they&rsquo;ll use us, you know, high value targets.</p>
<p>So we have this round, it&rsquo;s called the Excalibur round.</p>
<p>It costs about half a million dollars per round.</p>
<p>It comes in a special tube that is like sealed and locked and you have to get permission</p>
<p>from Ottawa to shoot it and it&rsquo;s only used for VIP targets.</p>
<p>So like we have VIP for everyone and it will, it&rsquo;s GPS guided, it&rsquo;s rocket propelled and</p>
<p>when you fire it, it will, if this is a wall and somebody&rsquo;s standing on this side of it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll hit you right there.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t touch that wall, it will hit you pinpoint.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll go right through whatever concrete, whatever and it will destroy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically the same thing as being a sniper, but with a much more damaging weapon.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t use that round often.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s only been used a handful of times max in Afghanistan that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>Again, I haven&rsquo;t, I wasn&rsquo;t there from 2009 until 21, but I, I know people that still</p>
<p>deployed in that, in those units and I don&rsquo;t know that it was used very often, but the</p>
<p>regular rounds, so there&rsquo;s HE, there&rsquo;s loom, so HE is high explosive, there&rsquo;s loom.</p>
<p>You shoot that, it explodes in the sky, it lights up the sky for the infantry below and</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s shrapnel rounds that will explode in the sky and then shrapnel just rains down</p>
<p>hell on you.</p>
<p>HE is what you use normally in my, I&rsquo;m trying to say this right because I know people squawked</p>
<p>at me about some of the stuff on Jocko, so I&rsquo;m trying to be very accurate.</p>
<p>In my experience, we used HE rounds to wipe people off the face of the earth when the</p>
<p>infantry needed us.</p>
<p>So we would get a call at any time and there&rsquo;s always two guns together.</p>
<p>So you never, you never go solo gun ever.</p>
<p>If you are, it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s sketchy and there&rsquo;s bad shits happening.</p>
<p>Can you explain that?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two gun, two people, two guns?</p>
<p>No, two guns with each gun troop.</p>
<p>So each gun troop has five to seven people running a gun at all times.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of people to run one of those.</p>
<p>How much electronics is there?</p>
<p>The GPS, like the computer system that&rsquo;s on it itself, I never ran that much, but it is</p>
<p>completely technologically, it&rsquo;s GPS guided.</p>
<p>All you have to do is literally type in the coordinates.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got the two big, um, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a technical word, word for it, but</p>
<p>basically wheels and one does the trajectory, you know, you do your, and you&rsquo;re just kind</p>
<p>of doing this and you&rsquo;re watching the watch in it.</p>
<p>And once you hit your target, that&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;ll tell you that&rsquo;s where you need</p>
<p>to hit.</p>
<p>Do you know if there&rsquo;s any like AI stuff like computer vision, like where there&rsquo;s cameras</p>
<p>and they help you target using like all different kinds of cameras to see through like the fog,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>We use, um, the FOO, which are Forward Observation Officers, which are an artillery individual</p>
<p>that is embedded with an infantry unit.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They call from the front, give us their grid coordinates and basically say like, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drop this on us.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So, well, you know what not to shoot, which parts not to shoot.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>As long as no one moves.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>Stay still.</p>
<p>But you can hear it coming, but you can&rsquo;t hear it until it&rsquo;s too close.</p>
<p>So like when I went, sorry, go ahead, you were going to say something.</p>
<p>No, I was going to say, what&rsquo;s the experience on the other, like, what does it feel like</p>
<p>to be maybe infantry or underneath it, underneath the artillery?</p>
<p>Well, I, I had the rare opportunity to do that and I have a video I&rsquo;ll show you after.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying because I know the people that are shooting it and I know them personally</p>
<p>and I know what they&rsquo;re like as humans and for the most part they&rsquo;re dialed.</p>
<p>Well, you get the odd duck where you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;ve seen people have an ND, which is a negligent</p>
<p>discharge.</p>
<p>You basically get charged for it.</p>
<p>You get in a lot of trouble because you can blow people up and it like accidents happen.</p>
<p>And so I know accidents can happen in stressful situations.</p>
<p>And when I was with the Brits, we had to call danger, close artillery.</p>
<p>And when it goes over top of you, it sounds like thunder and lightning.</p>
<p>So you fire it and it&rsquo;s not the stereotype that you hear in World War II where it kind</p>
<p>of like that, it&rsquo;s more of like a crackle.</p>
<p>And then you just hear like a whiz and it shit just goes everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s loud.</p>
<p>It shakes the ground.</p>
<p>It shakes you.</p>
<p>It, you feel it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is there some more words you can put to like the experience of what it&rsquo;s like to be in</p>
<p>the heat of, of, of battle there?</p>
<p>So what is, is there literally, is it hot?</p>
<p>Is it</p>
<p>like being under it or shooting it?</p>
<p>Under it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>It, 55 degree heat.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, you know that you&rsquo;re waiting for it to be called.</p>
<p>You feel an overwhelming excitement to start because for me, I&rsquo;d never been under it.</p>
<p>So I was like, okay, I had my camera ready.</p>
<p>Like I was a kid at a candy store and I&rsquo;m like, I want to watch this happen.</p>
<p>And once you hear the crackle, I got really fearful.</p>
<p>My anxiety kicked up significantly.</p>
<p>I got to the point where I got numb.</p>
<p>Like I was, my nerves were on overdrive so much that like my body would go like numb.</p>
<p>Like I couldn&rsquo;t move, but like my nerves were numb.</p>
<p>If that makes sense.</p>
<p>What, what were the nerves like and we&rsquo;re talking about fear or is it just anxious excitement?</p>
<p>Anxious excitement, hopeful that they wouldn&rsquo;t blow it up on us.</p>
<p>And there was this, there was this excitement that&rsquo;s hard to describe because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be excited that you&rsquo;re dropping bombs on people.</p>
<p>But when you just saw their faces and they&rsquo;re shooting at you, there&rsquo;s this overwhelming</p>
<p>feeling of got you motherfucker.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll talk about that because that&rsquo;s such a difficult thing about wars.</p>
<p>You forget that it&rsquo;s other human beings because those other human beings are doing really</p>
<p>bad things to you.</p>
<p>And so the very basic anger takes over, hate can take over.</p>
<p>And then also just the excitement of almost like video game like, you know, aspect of</p>
<p>war, like sport, it&rsquo;s like sport that all of those elements are all baked in and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to be philosophical in that situation it seems like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never played video games so I can&rsquo;t compare it to that.</p>
<p>But like from, from like a sports perspective, yeah, I could, I could argue that.</p>
<p>Like I felt like we won there for a second and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not just like a heat from outside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this radiation within you that is something I&rsquo;ve never felt since.</p>
<p>You just to take a small step back to the weapons training, what, what kind of guns</p>
<p>did you train on?</p>
<p>Because you also mentioned a rocket launcher.</p>
<p>I love Carl Grossoff&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>What are those?</p>
<p>Carl G.</p>
<p>Carl G&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like, my only experience with the rocket launchers is from the movie Commando</p>
<p>with Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve all discussed.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen that yet.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard about it and people have made me tell.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>I feel like you haven&rsquo;t seen a single movie that&rsquo;s relevant to war military because every</p>
<p>time anyone brings it up, you say you haven&rsquo;t seen it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time to watch movies, Lex.</p>
<p>Platoon.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t seen Platoon, which is, you&rsquo;re the scientist.</p>
<p>How do you have the time?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a scientist.</p>
<p>I just play one on TV.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So what, can you talk about the rocket launcher and maybe any other, for both engineering</p>
<p>actually, to me, those guns are very interesting from an engineering perspective too.</p>
<p>Well, they should be.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fascinating when you take them apart and you see how small the parts get down to</p>
<p>and how necessary every single little piece is to make that thing run.</p>
<p>And even without the tiniest little BB smaller than a piece on there, an artillery gun might</p>
<p>not run.</p>
<p>So we were trained on Carl G&rsquo;s, I think called M72s, which are disposable rocket launchers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll back up.</p>
<p>Carl G&rsquo;s are around, I don&rsquo;t know the exact millimeter of the round.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I shot them.</p>
<p>We only did those in training.</p>
<p>But essentially it takes, most people, one person can fire it, effectively hold it and</p>
<p>fire it.</p>
<p>It takes another person to load it.</p>
<p>So you put it onto your shoulder and it weighs, I would, I don&rsquo;t know, 30 pounds, 40 pounds.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a minute.</p>
<p>But one person can carry it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It just seems like a rocket launcher is a pretty intense kind of device that just.</p>
<p>It for sure is.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the diameter, I can&rsquo;t even tell you the diameter, they&rsquo;re about that big.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>And it goes on your shoulder.</p>
<p>It goes on your shoulder and then it has a little sight that pops out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost like plastic like, which is kind of funny because it reminds me of like</p>
<p>the little green army men.</p>
<p>I just felt so flimsy to me.</p>
<p>I was like, this is hilarious.</p>
<p>And then another person stands behind you and opens the hatch.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this, there&rsquo;s these two levers and you just kind of open it.</p>
<p>And then the back end, which is flared, so it&rsquo;s just a tube and then it&rsquo;s flared.</p>
<p>That will open it and drop down and you load a round into that and then you load it back</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re never supposed to stand behind it because the blast behind it will kill you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yeah.</p>
<p>But in my case, when I fired it, it was me and another individual, I want to say it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Sarah Pellegrin, but it was another girl that was smaller.</p>
<p>And the person is supposed to wrap around your waist and tuck low and hold your stability.</p>
<p>And we were just aiming at tanks that day and they were just concrete heads.</p>
<p>So they would just either, they would hit and bounce off or whatever.</p>
<p>And so when my sergeant saw that, he just kind of looked at both of us and was like,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m just going to.</p>
<p>And he got real low and just like wrapped both of us and then we&rsquo;d fire it.</p>
<p>And it feels like you&rsquo;re getting punched in the side of the head on repeat by Jocko.</p>
<p>You lose all your hearing, like just, snot comes out of your nose and you&rsquo;re just kind</p>
<p>of discombobulated for a minute.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real mind fuck.</p>
<p>Is there any other kind of guns that at that time, because you were new to this, you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shot guns when you were younger that were really impressive to you in the training process?</p>
<p>All of them, because I&rsquo;ve never fired a weapon.</p>
<p>So we had the C7s, which are like your M16s, I believe, the long barrel.</p>
<p>The cute thing about those is when I have that slung, my barrel drags on the ground.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>And they shoot your 7.62 or your 5.56 round.</p>
<p>I loved that.</p>
<p>I preferred the C8, which was a short barrel, which is what the SF guys use.</p>
<p>Not because it&rsquo;s cooler looking, which it obviously is, but because it was functional</p>
<p>for my body height and it didn&rsquo;t drag on the ground when I ran.</p>
<p>I loved those.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re your personal weapon.</p>
<p>Being an artillery gunner, if you&rsquo;re not an officer, at least in our unit, you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get a side piece.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a slide piece, Lex.</p>
<p>So I never had a handgun of any type.</p>
<p>I fired those in training.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get over that side piece comment.</p>
<p>Look at you.</p>
<p>I was going to say, I know what a side piece is.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to explain to me.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re single.</p>
<p>So how do you even have a side piece if you don&rsquo;t have a main piece?</p>
<p>The joke would be the fact that we have a total misunderstanding what side piece is.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So you didn&rsquo;t have a side piece as a non officer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I never fired those much.</p>
<p>We did grenades in training.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, grenades are fun.</p>
<p>I love grenades.</p>
<p>I have a massive one tattooed on me.</p>
<p>I have them all over my office.</p>
<p>How does a grenade work?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the spoon and the pin.</p>
<p>So this the pin holds the spoon in place when you pull that pin, the firing mechanism inside</p>
<p>as long as that the spoon is up against it, it won&rsquo;t fire as soon as that spoon goes.</p>
<p>I believe it causes a reaction on the inside.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got about five seconds to check it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be better to ask that question too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to get philosophical on this.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about a grenade, because you&rsquo;re essentially committing suicide.</p>
<p>Unless you get rid of the thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something like</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re unlucky, and it just goes off when you pull the pin, which has happened</p>
<p>to tons of people.</p>
<p>So it just feels like a very kind of leap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dangerous leap into the abyss every time you use the thing.</p>
<p>Because when you shoot a gun, like the gun is much less likely to malfunction in terms</p>
<p>of like all the possible ways to go wrong.</p>
<p>It just seems like grenade is like</p>
<p>primitive almost.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s primitive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also real, like in a way that like a bar fight is like being punched in the face</p>
<p>is real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re here with a weapon of destruction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you and the thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to get rid of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is that is that terrifying to you?</p>
<p>Like do people still use grenades in warfare?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are fantastic.</p>
<p>The Taliban were throwing them over the wall at the airport in Kabul.</p>
<p>People use them all the time because when you&rsquo;re in Afghanistan, if you&rsquo;re in a rural</p>
<p>area, you&rsquo;re going from village to village and they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re, you know, they&rsquo;re mud</p>
<p>hot walls, like they&rsquo;re tall, but you&rsquo;re walking through corridors and stuff, all you got to</p>
<p>lob one of those is going to take the whole unit out that just walked by like it&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>accurate if you&rsquo;re close enough and they&rsquo;re effective if you&rsquo;re close enough.</p>
<p>I love them though.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re fascinating to me because they&rsquo;re such a tiny little thing with such</p>
<p>devastation.</p>
<p>Yeah, they just can cause such devastation.</p>
<p>But for me, when I had them, the some of the Canadians would make fun of me because when</p>
<p>I did go outside the wire with the British, I had two right here.</p>
<p>And I remember I put a piece of tape over the spoons because in my mind, I could picture</p>
<p>myself searching someone and grabbing me and pulling that and that would be me that that</p>
<p>would have been like, yep, that if anyone that was going to happen to was her for sure.</p>
<p>So you were deployed to Afghanistan in 2009, okay.</p>
<p>And like we said, you were in great, no, perfect physical shape.</p>
<p>Fucking epic shape.</p>
<p>Epic shape, six pack or, I mean, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So you could do pull up, a lot of pull ups and push ups and yeah, okay.</p>
<p>And well trained, would you say, were you already what like, no, no, no, I&rsquo;ll argue</p>
<p>that point till I&rsquo;m blue in the face.</p>
<p>I spoke to recently, I actually spoke to my sergeant.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a sergeant anymore.</p>
<p>But Sergeant Mark LeBlanc, he&rsquo;s in Africa right now on a deployment.</p>
<p>He gave me a call the other day.</p>
<p>And I remember talking to him about this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s frustrating because we were at an active war.</p>
<p>We were sorry, we were involved in an active war where we the units that I were in were</p>
<p>tagged red, which meant they needed people.</p>
<p>So when you need people, things go quick, whether or not that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, you could argue that&rsquo;s the similar thing to what&rsquo;s happening in the world right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>We needed a vaccine.</p>
<p>We got a vaccine.</p>
<p>Is it the best it could be?</p>
<p>Could it be better?</p>
<p>Could it do more things?</p>
<p>Sure, probably.</p>
<p>But with the time that we had, we did the best that we could.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my logic on that.</p>
<p>For me, I joined the military in November of 2007.</p>
<p>I was in basic training in January of 2008.</p>
<p>I was graduated basic SQ, which is all your weapons training.</p>
<p>Your DP1, which is your trade specific training.</p>
<p>So whatever trade you&rsquo;re going to go into, whether it&rsquo;s infantry, armored, artillery,</p>
<p>medic, whatever, that&rsquo;s your DP1.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called different things in different units.</p>
<p>And then I got posted to my unit in September.</p>
<p>So January to September, I had done all my training.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m an English speaking individual.</p>
<p>I got posted to a French unit that only speaks French and had to learn all of the weapons</p>
<p>systems, everything, again, that I just learned in that short time frame in French.</p>
<p>This part of your story that you&rsquo;re telling this to Jaco is one way to say it is very</p>
<p>impressive that you had to learn all of this in French.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also the camaraderie, the social aspect of it, which is difficult, probably.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>But it also would make you a more effective soldier to be socially, for that cohesion</p>
<p>to be there, right?</p>
<p>But also just understanding the basic terminology.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>The right way to say something on the radio, the right way to run a gun, the right way</p>
<p>to, because you got to move with those guns, you got seven people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really magical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send you a video.</p>
<p>When we did some live fire in workup training in Texas before we left, we did a competition</p>
<p>between the other gun to see who could fire 10 rounds faster.</p>
<p>It is truly beautiful to watch an artillery unit fire a gun because it&rsquo;s like a symphony.</p>
<p>Everyone has their parts and everyone knows and everyone&rsquo;s yelling, but they know why</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re yelling and everyone, this guy&rsquo;s got to do this in order for this guy to load the</p>
<p>round.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>It is gorgeous to watch.</p>
<p>I miss it deeply.</p>
<p>Is there, by the way, for a gun, is there like one person responsible for the, for</p>
<p>the aim and the, or like the specification of the location and somebody else that pulls</p>
<p>it, presses the button?</p>
<p>The lanyard.</p>
<p>Is that the lanyard?</p>
<p>The button.</p>
<p>Is there a button?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than a button.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll like it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you in a second.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your Sergeant in charge and then they have their two IC and so the comms come in</p>
<p>to the Sergeant and the Sergeant is the, or your Master Bombardier, Bombardier Chef.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Bombardier Chef?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Bombardier Chef.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s the French.</p>
<p>Master Bombardier.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it goes like private in the North, like in an infantry or in a regular unit, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like private corporal, Master Corporal Sergeant.</p>
<p>In artillery, it goes Gunner, Bombardier, Master Bombardier, Sergeant and off like that.</p>
<p>So you have two people, but the Sarge is like, you don&rsquo;t move till he says move.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t fire till he says fire.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s your guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll give you the coordinates.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll feed them to the guy that&rsquo;s doing the GPS, that portion.</p>
<p>I really never did it much.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t tall enough to see it.</p>
<p>Like legitimately the way, how high it is up on the gun.</p>
<p>Like it was, I couldn&rsquo;t see clearly enough.</p>
<p>It was not good.</p>
<p>So obviously you have a big personality, you&rsquo;re a strong person.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>And you have a big hat currently.</p>
<p>I always wear a hat, Lex.</p>
<p>It seems like your height and your size was a factor.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>How were you able to step up in all those moments and how difficult was it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I realized it was difficult while I was doing it because that&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>way it&rsquo;s been.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been the short person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Nothing I can do to fix that.</p>
<p>So there was no point.</p>
<p>Am I going to whine about it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to break my femurs and insert things to make me grow a little bit.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe since you&rsquo;re in robotics, you can figure that out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your task now.</p>
<p>Make me be five foot three, that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>For artillery, really what it came down to was the unit when I got there, there was only</p>
<p>a couple of people who spoke any sort of English and my Sergeant was not one of them.</p>
<p>But once he kind of started to get to know me a little bit, the best that he could, he</p>
<p>started to put effort into making sure I could lift the rounds, make sure my capacity to</p>
<p>do my job was there.</p>
<p>And so he took me under his wing in that aspect.</p>
<p>So he would take me to the gym with him and he would show me exercises that would specifically</p>
<p>help me load the round.</p>
<p>So pick the round up from the ground, pick it up like a trick to put your knee under</p>
<p>it, use your legs instead of just pick it up, use your back, pull your back out.</p>
<p>He would work on that.</p>
<p>And then depending on the position I was running the gun in, if I was running the side that</p>
<p>had the charge bags, I&rsquo;ll explain that in a second, but if I was running the side that</p>
<p>had the charge bags, I could step up onto the gun and if I leaned inward enough with</p>
<p>my right hand with the charge and I kind of kicked off, I could kind of jump and shove</p>
<p>it up the tube.</p>
<p>Almost enough.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If I was running the lanyard, which is the thing that makes it go boom, it&rsquo;s really easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long rope.</p>
<p>You hook it on and you put your right hand on your hip and on your left and you hold</p>
<p>it there and you just stare at your Sergeant like this and you just wait for him to yell</p>
<p>fire and he points at you when he does it.</p>
<p>And when you do it, you turn your whole body with it.</p>
<p>And when you do that, it alleviates a misfire essentially because if you just pull it sometimes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>You got to really give it your whole body into it.</p>
<p>And so he would train me on how to do things differently so that I could do them effectively</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t a shit pump.</p>
<p>A what?</p>
<p>So shit pump is a term that we use in Canada to call somebody useless.</p>
<p>A shit pump is a useless soldier who is just, you&rsquo;re there and that&rsquo;s the shit pump and</p>
<p>so we all just deal with it.</p>
<p>But somehow they&rsquo;re still there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What were we talking about?</p>
<p>The lanyard.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We were talking about the artillery guns.</p>
<p>So those things though, what you would find fascinating is just how they break down when</p>
<p>you have to take one of those apart.</p>
<p>I think your mind would really find it fascinating how a breach comes apart all the way down</p>
<p>to like ball bearing size and the only, and there&rsquo;s a way to just make that gun complete</p>
<p>ineffective and all you have to do when you&rsquo;re on the charge side, there&rsquo;s a magazine that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a long linear magazine and it holds like 15 little rounds.</p>
<p>If you just take that thing out, that thing&rsquo;s not firing.</p>
<p>How many people does it take to move that?</p>
<p>Like how easy is it to move that thing?</p>
<p>To move a triple seven?</p>
<p>A triple seven.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re called.</p>
<p>M triple sevens.</p>
<p>Is a lot of the terminology crossover the same in English and French?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, M triple seven does cause it&rsquo;s an obvious how it&rsquo;s, or I&rsquo;m sure it has a separate</p>
<p>word, but like if you&rsquo;re running it, you&rsquo;re running it in French.</p>
<p>So like when I&rsquo;d be running the, when I&rsquo;m doing the charge bags and I&rsquo;m doing, I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m loading everything and I&rsquo;m getting that ready and that&rsquo;s my position that day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also controlling the breach.</p>
<p>So like how it opens, how it closes when it locks.</p>
<p>And so, but you have to yell that as you do it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re yelling like, like you have to yell all these things.</p>
<p>You have to learn them though.</p>
<p>And so for a long time, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it was a little frustrating.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t lie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>I took a lot of French, but I forgot all of it, but I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful romantic</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good language.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s from Quebec, it&rsquo;s a, yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good language to fall in love with.</p>
<p>Not as good as Russian, but I mean, English is, all right.</p>
<p>I mean, Russian, are we really, is that like a love language?</p>
<p>It is to me.</p>
<p>I mean, because you&rsquo;re Russian, but like if somebody walked up to me, it was like, Hey,</p>
<p>Kelsey, I like you, I&rsquo;d be like, Oh God, he&rsquo;s going to put me in a camp.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t understand love, Kelsey.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How many people does it take to move the M777?</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re moving it by ground, you&rsquo;re moving it on a truck and when you&rsquo;re moving it on</p>
<p>a truck, you&rsquo;re hooking the back of it onto, you&rsquo;re hooking the front of the barrel onto</p>
<p>one of those big transport looking trucks that has those cargo tents that&rsquo;s got soldiers</p>
<p>in it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to ever move an M777 by that way, if you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>The barrel is worth a million dollars.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this is like a serious piece of equipment.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to move them.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When we got to Kandahar, we were there for a couple of days.</p>
<p>We got flown out to the FOB we were going to be at, forward observation base.</p>
<p>Kandahar is the safe space or was the major base in Afghanistan that we were at.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things like Tim Hortons there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Canada house.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a British side, an American side, a Canadian side, and that&rsquo;s where you see</p>
<p>all the different countries in the world kind of come together.</p>
<p>You would see Italians, you would see Germans, you would see French, you would see all these</p>
<p>different uniforms and you never know who to salute because you don&rsquo;t know what each</p>
<p>thing means.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel like a war zone.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh God, no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a boardwalk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s hockey there, like floor hockey because Canada had to have that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Tim Hortons, a Subway, a Pizza Hut, a PX.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a restaurant there somewhere, but I didn&rsquo;t get to go.</p>
<p>Stuff like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gyms.</p>
<p>You can run around it.</p>
<p>You feel fairly safe.</p>
<p>You always have a weapon on you, but you can live your life.</p>
<p>When you get out to the FOB, the guns are already there.</p>
<p>Those M777s get lifted by a Chinook.</p>
<p>Normally if they&rsquo;re going by air, they go by Chinook because they&rsquo;re heavy as hell.</p>
<p>And Chinooks can hook them under the bottom and they fly them and then they&rsquo;ll drop them</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>They have wheels on them, but you don&rsquo;t need them if you&rsquo;re going to leave it in place.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re getting information about IEDs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting a lay of the land as to what&rsquo;s been going on in the country for the past</p>
<p>six months.</p>
<p>And this, you know nothing, you&rsquo;re just like, this is your first time you&rsquo;re getting deployed.</p>
<p>So what was your deployment like?</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of your deployment to Afghanistan?</p>
<p>Like the whole deployment?</p>
<p>Getting like actual deploying, not the deployment itself.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between the two?</p>
<p>Well actually getting ready to deploy is a little different.</p>
<p>So I mean the emotional buildup to it and some of the memorable things that kind of</p>
<p>you remember from that experience, both on the excitement, I get to see battle, I get</p>
<p>to be part of this and the fear and also like being surprised like with the Tim Hortons</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So like the lead up before everything like shit hit the fan, okay cool.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re such a fascinating person, but yes, yes.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been called&hellip;</p>
<p>Many things.</p>
<p>Yeah, fascinating.</p>
<p>That start with the letter F.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know many words with F. Okay, so the buildup to the deployment.</p>
<p>So for the buildup for the deployment, I was in Quebec and my unit was deploying from Quebec.</p>
<p>And at that time you kind of get your marching orders, you know you&rsquo;re deploying.</p>
<p>I knew I was deploying before I even graduated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how much they needed people.</p>
<p>So once I did all that training, on graduation parade day, a couple men from Quebec in uniforms</p>
<p>came over and said, you, you, you and you are all being posted back here today and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to deploy with us in April.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I found out I was deploying.</p>
<p>Why was there such a need for troops in Afghanistan?</p>
<p>That was a well known thing that there&rsquo;s a scaling up of troops.</p>
<p>2007 on, Canada really started taking a combat role.</p>
<p>Before it was very much more a UN type deal where doing what we normally do in most wars</p>
<p>where we just, we wear blue and we don&rsquo;t shoot anyone.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re there to help.</p>
<p>And so they were really, they were scaling up and there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of people in those</p>
<p>trades initially, I think when the war kind of started.</p>
<p>So Canada really started to scale.</p>
<p>And so when I got to Quebec, we&rsquo;ve kind of found, oh yeah, we&rsquo;re deploying.</p>
<p>And it was a weird situation because I&rsquo;ve never actually been at a unit on a non deployable</p>
<p>unit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they do day to day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s different from what I did.</p>
<p>I just know what I did.</p>
<p>So we would do things like in the morning we would get up and we would meet for PT at</p>
<p>5 a.m. and that would include going for a 10k run or playing ball hockey for a few hours</p>
<p>in the gym or lifting weights together or just going on a rock march, a long rock march.</p>
<p>Just stuff like that.</p>
<p>You would have a shower, you would meet and then you would just sit around the regiment.</p>
<p>You would just sit around the regiment and you would, if there was busy work, you&rsquo;d mop</p>
<p>the floors, you would clean weapons.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot until there was a whole lot to do.</p>
<p>We did a lot for a while and then we went away on workup training to Texas for a week.</p>
<p>We came down here and we did live fire with our other troop that was gonna be with us.</p>
<p>So Alpha had two guns and two guns has two groups of people and so we all would go down</p>
<p>to Texas and we did live fire here for a week and I ended up getting gastro which was awesome.</p>
<p>So thanks for that.</p>
<p>Oh apparently there was, they were having water problems and sanitary problems so everyone</p>
<p>was getting it on the base.</p>
<p>Okay so it just makes your life way harder.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get it towards the end, till towards the end so that was fortunate.</p>
<p>So we would fire live fire, we would go out to the middle of nowhere, the guns would be</p>
<p>there and we would get offloaded truck of rounds and we would do live fire and we would</p>
<p>practice, just constant practice.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that saying?</p>
<p>Perfect practice makes perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah so this is a sensory, like a shooting range for artillery, for long range.</p>
<p>So what does practice look like?</p>
<p>So you roll up in your trucks and you&rsquo;re, you know, you&rsquo;ve got each group of people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got two trucks and then you&rsquo;ve got like a medic vehicle and then you&rsquo;ve got like</p>
<p>an officer vehicle and a comms vehicle and you go to your perspective guns and then you</p>
<p>offload your ammo and then you basically wait for them to send you like a fire mission.</p>
<p>Wow, get that together.</p>
<p>They would call, they would say a mission, so it would be a fire mission.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d wait for that and once we got that then you all run like a bunch of scattered</p>
<p>rats to the gun like it&rsquo;s like the greatest thing you&rsquo;ve ever seen and then you just wait,</p>
<p>you wait for the call for the sergeants to say and then you&rsquo;ll hear it because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>headphones.</p>
<p>You can hear it on a speaker and it&rsquo;d be like, I&rsquo;m not going to do it in French, don&rsquo;t ask.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be like so and so, 10 rounds, fire when ready and then you would get your rounds ready</p>
<p>and everyone would have them ready and would be in their respective positions and then</p>
<p>you would wait and then they would say fire when ready and as soon as they say fire when</p>
<p>ready that means just start going.</p>
<p>Just start and then that&rsquo;s when the magic starts.</p>
<p>You go like the loop, like you shoot one or whatever, there&rsquo;s a reloading process.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a loop.</p>
<p>So what you would do, you get the fire mission, you would find out the rounds, the 2IC would</p>
<p>be standing by the rounds and it was his job to make sure the amount of rounds that was</p>
<p>told would be the only rounds that would go downrange and so he&rsquo;d stand there and on each</p>
<p>round depending on the type of round is a fuse which gets screwed onto the top of the round.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re about that big and it&rsquo;s just a point and then you would have to put it on,</p>
<p>give it a spin and depending if it was a time release, you had a little, what do you call</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>You get those at IKEA when you have to build everything.</p>
<p>Allen wrench?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, Allen wrench.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But like a big one or something?</p>
<p>No, just a little one because it&rsquo;s a tiny little hole and you just got to click it to</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s supposed to go and it depended on what the call was for and it was a timer.</p>
<p>When you said like wheel, you mean like a little thing then?</p>
<p>Is that what we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the round itself.</p>
<p>So you would put a fuse on top of the round.</p>
<p>So you would unload the ammo and then you would put fuses on them and the fuses are</p>
<p>on the top and they&rsquo;re like a little ice cream topper kind of thing and you would spin those</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>And then once they&rsquo;re on, depending if it&rsquo;s a time release or not, you would take this</p>
<p>little thing and you would move it the top and that would, it&rsquo;s almost like a little</p>
<p>timer.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re assembling a bullet.</p>
<p>Essentially.</p>
<p>A very big one that goes up to my waist.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is very cool.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re a fascinating person.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So just that you still even years later have all this in your memory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all perfectly accurate and that&rsquo;s what irritates me though is because it bothers</p>
<p>me when I can&rsquo;t remember things accurately but I have a lot of, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of memory</p>
<p>issues and problems after like having too many hits to the head and&hellip;</p>
<p>This is from earlier in childhood or later?</p>
<p>But both.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>The military did not help it.</p>
<p>Where was the hits in the head in the military?</p>
<p>Well when you have a Carl Gustav beside your face like this and it shoots around, it gives</p>
<p>you a concussive blast.</p>
<p>Also there&rsquo;s new research being done, I&rsquo;ll find out exactly what it is, but there&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>research that&rsquo;s being done that shows that if you&rsquo;re an artillery gunner and you stand</p>
<p>within a certain range of that gun, you get the same amount of concussive blasts and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a range.</p>
<p>I had no idea but you feel it when it goes off, like it hurt, your whole body feels it.</p>
<p>Your mind is fascinating because it&rsquo;s like literally the opposite of mine.</p>
<p>One you&rsquo;re able to speak very quickly, very clearly, very sharply.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>No, what?</p>
<p>I talk too fast and I&rsquo;m pretty loud.</p>
<p>No that&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>Because of my hearing.</p>
<p>I admire, I mean I admire that very much.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do any of that and you listen extremely well and you&rsquo;re extremely attentive and you</p>
<p>have a good memory.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s just fun to watch you and I can tell you&rsquo;re a great soldier in just all different</p>
<p>aspects of it.</p>
<p>Thank you, I appreciate it.</p>
<p>But what the heck we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Oh, build up to the deployment.</p>
<p>How did we get to Texas?</p>
<p>Because that was part of the build up to my deployment.</p>
<p>And live fire you got to, did that feel good?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>It was so good.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the favorite, what&rsquo;s the best part about like shooting artillery?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the thing that feels good?</p>
<p>Which part?</p>
<p>Power.</p>
<p>Well the feeling of power.</p>
<p>When is the best moment of, the highest moment of the feeling of power?</p>
<p>Is it the whole process that you love or is there like when you actually shoot it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s symbiotic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing to watch.</p>
<p>To know that a gun can fire and it takes kind of a dance to make it work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about that to me that just got my heart racing.</p>
<p>When you actually shoot the round and you see it go and you hear it, it&rsquo;s unlike, you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t describe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, I&rsquo;ve never felt another feeling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also never been in like an F18 or an F like 16 or like any, I&rsquo;ve never been in</p>
<p>anything like that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve, you know, I&rsquo;ve never, trying to think of something else that&rsquo;d be comparable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been in like a Formula One car.</p>
<p>Those are the only things I can picture being that much for me because to shoot one of those</p>
<p>and to know that you&rsquo;ve done your job right means that you&rsquo;ve helped.</p>
<p>And that to me was really what did it for me.</p>
<p>When you hear your sergeant say, mission accomplished, target hit, tired acquired, then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good feeling, that&rsquo;s the stuff.</p>
<p>Quick pause.</p>
<p>Take a break Lex.</p>
<p>Okay, so live fire in Texas, we&rsquo;re in Texas by the way.</p>
<p>Fort Worth or Fort Hood, one of them.</p>
<p>Well, okay, so like it&rsquo;s what, is that close to a big major city?</p>
<p>Do you remember visiting a city?</p>
<p>Oh God, no, we fly right into the tarmac and they&rsquo;re like, don&rsquo;t touch the snakes.</p>
<p>And then they send you out to the field.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see the instructions.</p>
<p>No, really, we went into a classroom and they&rsquo;re like, these are the animals that are in the</p>
<p>wildlife in Texas.</p>
<p>If you see any of them, do not approach.</p>
<p>Do not go pee outside.</p>
<p>Do not squat down.</p>
<p>It is snake season people.</p>
<p>And I was like, I have to pee and squat down.</p>
<p>Why Texas and from like Canada, is it a simulation of Afghanistan?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s, okay, so you&rsquo;re getting, and that&rsquo;s the way the live fire was seen</p>
<p>in artilleries, like you&rsquo;re trying to simulate certain aspects of what you might actually</p>
<p>see in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I would think so.</p>
<p>I mean, we, it, it looks like it&rsquo;s hot, like it, you&rsquo;re out in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>Very similar terrain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first time we started to get to wear our tan boots and our tan, like our combat</p>
<p>tan stuff before you couldn&rsquo;t wear that.</p>
<p>So it gave us an opportunity to kind of break in, break in how we were going to be doing</p>
<p>this, what it was going to look like, how the guns were going to work and all of those</p>
<p>lovely things.</p>
<p>How do you go from there to being deployed?</p>
<p>What was the next part of the journey?</p>
<p>So then we go to Wainwright, Alberta, often called or referenced as Waincock because it</p>
<p>sucks so bad.</p>
<p>It is a massive open space in Alberta, which most of Alberta is, and it&rsquo;s outside of a</p>
<p>small town called Wainwright.</p>
<p>And it is a field X training area for all of the Canadian military.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s where you do live fire, but you also do workup training.</p>
<p>So you go out there for a month or two, I think it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the exact time we were there because it was just, you sleep in a tent,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in your cot, you&rsquo;re in like full mission mode.</p>
<p>And you go outside and we did this operation called Operation Maple Leaf, I think it was.</p>
<p>And you put on these little suits, they have haptic, you can feel when you&rsquo;re shot.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a little camera, sorry, screen in the front of it, and it&rsquo;s got button options.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s to mimic if you get shot, it&rsquo;ll say gunshot wound.</p>
<p>And then you have to choose, okay, do I do this or do I do this?</p>
<p>And depending on your response, person dies or lives.</p>
<p>And they have other people who aren&rsquo;t on a rotation for deployment come and act as the</p>
<p>Taliban and attack you in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Is there a good understanding of the tactics that the Taliban used to attack?</p>
<p>I mean, this may be fast forwards to our conversation a little bit, but is there predictable strategies</p>
<p>on the other side that are being used in Afghanistan?</p>
<p>By the Taliban?</p>
<p>By the Taliban.</p>
<p>Oh, 100%.</p>
<p>They had suicide bombers, vehicle born IEDs.</p>
<p>Their standard way to hit people really was IEDs and vehicle born IEDs, suicide bombers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d put like backpacks full of an IED and then put like toys around it and then just</p>
<p>be like.</p>
<p>So they will conceal it certain ways and probably use civilians.</p>
<p>Oh, 100%.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And women were a great way to get close to the soldiers because women seem nonthreatening.</p>
<p>When you see a burqa walk up to you, you&rsquo;re not expecting an AK 47 to roll out of that</p>
<p>and then, or, you know, but there are great ways to get close.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what is it, Wayne something?</p>
<p>Waynecock?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not how, Wayne Wright.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to Alberta.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t have to go to Alberta.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to.</p>
<p>No, let&rsquo;s, in our minds, in our imagination.</p>
<p>So okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s getting you closer to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What was that like?</p>
<p>I mean, are you getting anxious at this point?</p>
<p>Is there a buildup?</p>
<p>What are you thinking?</p>
<p>Or is this just all part of the training?</p>
<p>For me, it was more part of the training.</p>
<p>I was excited to go because I did know that we were going to do some live fire.</p>
<p>I did know that we were going to be doing more of the military type job I thought we</p>
<p>were going to be doing because up until that point, I had just done training.</p>
<p>So I was learning how to march and salute and who to salute and not salute.</p>
<p>Like that was the focus of, that was my experience of the military.</p>
<p>And then the next experience was sitting in a regiment, just working out a lot and going</p>
<p>for breakfast a lot and drinking.</p>
<p>Like that was, I was like, this is the army.</p>
<p>So when I actually got to go to Wainwright, I got my first full taste of, okay, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s fire picket duty.</p>
<p>So one person gets picked every night to do sentry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little less sleep.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re eating out of a canteen now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re drinking out of canteen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in your kit more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in your deployable kit.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re in your, you know, you&rsquo;re wearing your tack vest.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting ready to practice having plates on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having ammunition on you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got your weapon with you all the time.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on base in Quebec, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re just like an everyday job.</p>
<p>Maybe you can paint a clearer picture to me.</p>
<p>When was there an understanding that you&rsquo;re actually getting deployed?</p>
<p>Was it just a sense that you&rsquo;re getting deployed or was this officially told to you?</p>
<p>I was officially told on graduation day, you&rsquo;re deploying in April with Vac Hits.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a date.</p>
<p>Like they, they knew, so what had happened is the reason that Vac Hits unit needed more</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>So they came to that and they picked five people.</p>
<p>There was five English speaking people that went to Vac Hits.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just myself.</p>
<p>There was a couple other people I knew that were English speaking that got put on other</p>
<p>guns within the regiment.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t with any of them.</p>
<p>We all kind of got split up.</p>
<p>And so there was an understanding that we were going to always be deploying.</p>
<p>Next year, it was like 2009, you&rsquo;re deploying.</p>
<p>Whether you left in May or April, we were deploying because that was the rotation time.</p>
<p>So each Canadian unit did between six and nine months.</p>
<p>And then you knew right around that point, another base of individuals would then deploy.</p>
<p>So you would go on these rotations.</p>
<p>And so even when I was on my deployment then, I was slated to go again the following year,</p>
<p>but towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>So there was always a rotation.</p>
<p>If you were in a combat arms unit and you were in one that was a deployable unit.</p>
<p>So if you were from Edmonton, a PPCLI, which were the Princess Patricia&rsquo;s, which were their</p>
<p>infantry unit.</p>
<p>If you were RCR out of Petawawa, Ontario, you knew you were deploying.</p>
<p>If you were at Vac Hits, you knew you were deploying.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s combat arms bases, and then there&rsquo;s like naval bases.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know their deployment structure.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know how they worked.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the ground.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the boats.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t know how the Air Force deployed.</p>
<p>I knew Vac Hits was deploying in April.</p>
<p>You were going, get ready.</p>
<p>That was that.</p>
<p>So you show up to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>What is a combat arms unit look like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the situation look like?</p>
<p>How much chaos is there?</p>
<p>How much clarity about mission is there?</p>
<p>What are your feelings about the whole thing?</p>
<p>So when you leave, the day you leave, we left Quebec, we got driven to the airport and then</p>
<p>we walked onto the tarmac and we load our own bags and we got on a plane and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>empty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s our plane.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t go right to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>You go to a stopover point, which I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m allowed to say where that is frankly.</p>
<p>So I just say it&rsquo;s somewhere overseas.</p>
<p>And you go there and you go there for a couple of days, I think it&rsquo;s like a day or two.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you get like your kit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you get your bulletproof plates for the first time and realize how heavy those</p>
<p>fucking things are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where you get your weapon and your ammunition, your first few mags.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where you get your helmet and your vests and you get everything that you need.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re there, it&rsquo;s pretty nonchalant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hot as hell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your first time being in that kind of heat.</p>
<p>So you just never stop sweating.</p>
<p>The place we were in, it&rsquo;s just the second you got out of the shower, you were still</p>
<p>wet after you got out.</p>
<p>What the hell is happening?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so humid.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, is this going to be like this in Afghanistan?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, no, it&rsquo;s not humid there at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, why is it so bad here?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>So and where we were there, it was kind of cute.</p>
<p>We were like in a base, within a base and they had like turf and we had like ice cream</p>
<p>and fruit and you could go get on a computer, you could go make calls, you had showers,</p>
<p>you had a real bed.</p>
<p>It was very kind of okay for that point.</p>
<p>And then you got all your stuff and then okay, we&rsquo;re rolling out, which is about a five hour</p>
<p>flight.</p>
<p>Again, my experience with helicopters is mostly from another Arnold Schwarzenegger movie,</p>
<p>The Predator.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, do you want me to say I&rsquo;ve never seen it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen it.</p>
<p>Lex, do you feel better about yourself?</p>
<p>No, you want to tell the audience the, all the excellent shows that you mentioned me</p>
<p>offline that you watch instead, instead of Platoon.</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>Yeah, this, nine is Sex and the City.</p>
<p>Was that more important than Platoon?</p>
<p>Oh no, I&rsquo;ve never seen that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t put me in that category.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Did you just put me in a box?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I watch like Homeland.</p>
<p>I watch, no, I watch like, I watch a lot of documentaries.</p>
<p>I watch, I like to watch real, real things more than, than, than just film.</p>
<p>I did a little bit of film stuff when I got back into Canada and I was like, once you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve seen how it&rsquo;s made, I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m the same way as superhero movies.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, I want, I want, I want something closer to reality, but then movies like Platoon</p>
<p>reveal some deep aspect of reality without it.</p>
<p>I did Superman Man of Steel.</p>
<p>Wait, you, sorry, you, you were, what do you mean you did?</p>
<p>I was not a military expert, but I was a stunt expert, even though I didn&rsquo;t actually have</p>
<p>to do any stunts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just because I had previous military experience and they were going to have me</p>
<p>as an extra as a military person.</p>
<p>But if you have previous experience, they have to make it as like a stunt role, like</p>
<p>so you get paid more.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So I got to sit at a desk and I was in that, I was in that like, you&rsquo;d see me like, whew,</p>
<p>for like two seconds.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is you were the mastermind behind that movie.</p>
<p>For the entire thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so accurate.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Your representation of me is just fantastic.</p>
<p>The combat arms unit of Afghanistan, the ice cream machine.</p>
<p>What like when you actually get closer and closer to the mission, what, when does that</p>
<p>happen?</p>
<p>When I, you know, got to where we were before we were leaving to get on the plane, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really, I don&rsquo;t think I realized what the hell I was doing.</p>
<p>Truthfully, like you&rsquo;re asking me all these, like, what did you feel, how did you, like</p>
<p>when I really think about it, if I sit there and really think about it, I was deploying.</p>
<p>I was aware.</p>
<p>I knew what I was going to do.</p>
<p>I knew my job, but once we actually stepped onto that Herc to leave, to get into the Afghan</p>
<p>airspace, I think that&rsquo;s when it hit me.</p>
<p>I think it smacked me in the face so hard.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when the overwhelming just reality was that, oh fuck, oh, oh, oh.</p>
<p>When they said, make weapons ready, put the barrel to the ground, put your helmets on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when they start flying tactically, which means they&rsquo;re going between the mountains.</p>
<p>That means we&rsquo;re going to land soon.</p>
<p>Which means if you&rsquo;re flying like this, it&rsquo;s because RPGs can hit you.</p>
<p>So that was my first moment of, oh, I could like just be shot down right now.</p>
<p>Like I, I couldn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t grasp it.</p>
<p>I was, how old was I?</p>
<p>19.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to explain to you cause it&rsquo;s hard because I don&rsquo;t know that I actually</p>
<p>did grasp it until I was in the air getting ready to land in Kandahar.</p>
<p>When was the first time you heard bullets, enemy, enemy bullets or enemy explosions?</p>
<p>Well, when you&rsquo;re in Kandahar, when you&rsquo;re in Kandahar, when you&rsquo;re at CAF, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fairly insulated away from the main walls.</p>
<p>You would hear stuff go off or you would hear the rocket sirens would go off.</p>
<p>So you would hear the, and everyone just kind of got down on the ground and just waited</p>
<p>for the all clear.</p>
<p>And then we got back up.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t hear any actual live fire until I got to the FOB.</p>
<p>It was more just a lot of noise.</p>
<p>You would hear a lot of helicopters, a lot of planes going in and out of the base.</p>
<p>So there was that sense you could feel the ground shake when they took off, but there</p>
<p>was that sense, you know, things were going around, things were happening.</p>
<p>You just weren&rsquo;t far enough.</p>
<p>You were not close enough to the edges of CAF to see it.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the FOB?</p>
<p>FOB is a Forward Observation Base, which is a small little base out in the middle of wherever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s specific to artillery?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in general, just an observation base from which combat.</p>
<p>For infantry to go in and out of, for armor to go in and out of, special ops go in and</p>
<p>out of them.</p>
<p>They fly, they&rsquo;ll stop there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll pick people up or do whatever, then they&rsquo;ll go out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, a Forward Observation Base is used essentially to have eyes in that area without</p>
<p>having to be doing patrols every five seconds.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not, is it like, is there like medics there?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it was.</p>
<p>Actual base?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was, it&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t call it an actual base.</p>
<p>You sleep in tents and cots.</p>
<p>And it is, the walls are this mesh material that are filled with gravel.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the walls.</p>
<p>And then you have towers.</p>
<p>You had five, I think we had five towers because the Americans ran four and we ran one.</p>
<p>And so it was an American FOB.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called FOB Ramrod.</p>
<p>And there was a, were there Marines?</p>
<p>No, I think they were the 101st.</p>
<p>They were out of there.</p>
<p>This is where I get dicey because I was moved a lot.</p>
<p>So when people are like, who are you with?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I know what their patches looked like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the full ins and outs.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m working on getting that back so that I can tell it accurately because I believe</p>
<p>it deserves that type of respect.</p>
<p>But that being said, I&rsquo;m still trying to wrap my brain around all of this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You almost have to go back and do like research to understand the full details of all the</p>
<p>things you were experiencing.</p>
<p>And so I reached out to actually a bunch of people even before I wrote the book and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get a lot of answers.</p>
<p>Well, once I did Jocko, all the people have reached out to me and were like, hey, and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, called you.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m working, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing the rewrite is I&rsquo;m working on making sure that</p>
<p>things are exact.</p>
<p>And so there was infantry units going in at that FOB and it was a really tiny FOB.</p>
<p>It was run by the Americans and then there was a tiny little corner that was the Canadian</p>
<p>artillery unit.</p>
<p>And the Americans, normally it&rsquo;s Americans shooting for Americans, Canadians shooting</p>
<p>for Canadians.</p>
<p>The rest of the regiment that deployed, so Bravo and Charlie, they were at Canadian FOBs,</p>
<p>Massom Guard and another one and these were huge FOBs.</p>
<p>Ours was this tiny like three kilometer around place and we had this tiny little subsection</p>
<p>of it and the rest was so it was like this and then all American here.</p>
<p>And when we got there, we landed, the guns were already there.</p>
<p>So you ripped out the unit before you.</p>
<p>So those guys were just leaving and we were just replacing them.</p>
<p>So that we knew the guns, they were Canadian guns, we understood, you know, how to run</p>
<p>those.</p>
<p>That was fine.</p>
<p>When we got there, though, we had come in on Chinook and Chinooks are super loud and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re hearing protection.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not, no, this is not reality.</p>
<p>Like this is why I&rsquo;m partially deaf now.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not reality.</p>
<p>So sorry to take a tangent, but do you usually wear ear protection in any aspects of warfare</p>
<p>of this whole process?</p>
<p>You wear comms, like you have a comm on like in a radio if you&rsquo;re outside the wire.</p>
<p>So comms, is that like a Bluetooth headset?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a Bluetooth headset.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Like from Nike or like?</p>
<p>I was gonna say Adidas.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone was involved at some point.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This equipment looked like it was from World War II.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s comms, but is that having ear protection?</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t wear them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just what some people wore.</p>
<p>People when you were as low as me, like we weren&rsquo;t privy to conversate.</p>
<p>Like we were just told what to do and you do it.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re doing like on the OP tower, you have a radio, you pick up and you call</p>
<p>in and then you put the radio down.</p>
<p>But for hearing protection, I mean, I would put in earplugs, but those things are so violently</p>
<p>loud that earplugs, they don&rsquo;t do it justice.</p>
<p>I feel like when you go shooting, there&rsquo;s a certain kinds of earplugs that you, it blocks</p>
<p>out the gut, like certain kinds of sounds associated with guns and you can still hear</p>
<p>other types of stuff.</p>
<p>So the ones they issued us were these big things that had like a headpiece like here,</p>
<p>but you have to wear your helmet when you&rsquo;re firing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t have both on.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So how much are you aware of the logistics of the whole thing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always fascinating with warfare.</p>
<p>Like in terms of setting up, you mentioned gravel and the fobs, like setting all those</p>
<p>bases out.</p>
<p>Were you seeing any of this or again, it&rsquo;s a 19 year old kind of just.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not that I was oblivious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one thing I would say I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I was, I&rsquo;m very aware of my surroundings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s always been taught to me from a very early age because I travel</p>
<p>a lot with my dad in the truck.</p>
<p>And so my dad would be like, you&rsquo;re going to go into that bathroom and I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>watch you come out and you&rsquo;re going to watch everyone around you because people get kidnapped.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s just the reality.</p>
<p>I was always very paranoid.</p>
<p>So you were paying attention to surroundings.</p>
<p>But the fob was already built up when we got there.</p>
<p>This is already like well established bases already.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Established enough.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And that is one of the first times you&rsquo;ve heard actual fire.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was like the, I mean, I&rsquo;d heard it on the, when we, when we shoot and when we zero</p>
<p>in weapons and we do all that stuff.</p>
<p>But I had never heard it, heard it like that before.</p>
<p>And then you would see the, the, the guys, the Americans would roll out every day and</p>
<p>go on patrol and come back, back, back.</p>
<p>And so you would see them, you would hear them, they would tell the stories, those types</p>
<p>of things.</p>
<p>But I never experienced it because we never, we never got attacked.</p>
<p>Like our base never got hit.</p>
<p>We were really lucky that way.</p>
<p>There were other ones around us that were getting hit, but we weren&rsquo;t, we weren&rsquo;t getting</p>
<p>hit.</p>
<p>We were very fortunate.</p>
<p>At least we didn&rsquo;t get hit when I was there.</p>
<p>I believe the entry got, there was an attempt.</p>
<p>There was an attempt at some point in a past, but I wasn&rsquo;t privy to that.</p>
<p>But we were in the OP tower, so we had to do our own security.</p>
<p>But because we were such a small subset of Canadians and we always had to have people</p>
<p>running the guns and ready to run the guns at all times.</p>
<p>We only had to man one tower.</p>
<p>So you would do four hour shifts with a fire team partner in the tower, depending on whatever,</p>
<p>but you would do it every day.</p>
<p>So I would look out into the rest of Afghanistan at that opportunity.</p>
<p>Otherwise it was just like your walls.</p>
<p>What did it look like?</p>
<p>Is it beautiful?</p>
<p>Just the full landscape?</p>
<p>Or is it?</p>
<p>Where I was, there was mountains in the distance.</p>
<p>It was just very sandy, very flat.</p>
<p>And there was a couple of small compounds on the outside.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a lot to look at.</p>
<p>There was a long road that you knew that got hit all the time.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a lot to look at.</p>
<p>Such a strange place to be the center of superpowers over the decades.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>And the fact that the populace, the civilians are almost completely clueless to the full</p>
<p>history of things in terms of globally, the geopolitics of it all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, if you look at the location of it, right, on a map, it makes more sense.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You can wrap your brain around it.</p>
<p>But I met plenty of people who had never even seen a picture of themselves when I was in</p>
<p>that country.</p>
<p>I mean, how much more are they going to understand if they don&rsquo;t know what even exists outside?</p>
<p>You tell a small story of taking a picture of a girl and showing it to her, an Afghani</p>
<p>girl.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We were, I was with the British at that time, and we were on that operation that gets highlighted</p>
<p>quite a bit.</p>
<p>And we had stopped and the ICOM radios were pinging.</p>
<p>And ICOM radios are a radio that we have an interpreter on that the Taliban, basically</p>
<p>we can hear what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their comms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s us tapped in.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s really clear, they&rsquo;re close.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s scatty and they&rsquo;re far enough away, normally they&rsquo;re not planning an attack, although</p>
<p>you never know, really.</p>
<p>And we were going door to door, kind of like what they&rsquo;re doing now.</p>
<p>And we were pulling people out of their houses.</p>
<p>And we knew there were, there was people in there that were active Taliban and we knew</p>
<p>the ICOMs were pinging.</p>
<p>When we got in there, they had hidden all the women and kids and locked them inside</p>
<p>the house because often nowadays women, the women, they would hide things on them that</p>
<p>they shouldn&rsquo;t have because no one would be ever there to search them because there isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a lot of women on the front lines.</p>
<p>But I got borrowed to go specifically search women and children.</p>
<p>So they had me and one of the little girls kind of snuck out and was kind of sitting</p>
<p>near me and I was eating something and I had these little candies, I think they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>little sweeties.</p>
<p>The British have them in the ration packs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re good though.</p>
<p>And she saw me eating them and so I gave them to her and then her brother came over and</p>
<p>slapped her upside the head and took them from her.</p>
<p>So then I just went over and slapped him upside the head and just pointed my gun at her while</p>
<p>she ate them all because I was like, no, you can have these.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stand here and make sure you do.</p>
<p>And I remember asking, can I take a picture with her?</p>
<p>I asked the trip, can you ask her, can I take a picture with her?</p>
<p>And she was very confused and when you look at the photo, you see her face, she&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>stunned.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s very stunned.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t my camera.</p>
<p>It was my officer&rsquo;s camera.</p>
<p>It was a hot pink, like fluorescent pink camera.</p>
<p>So I pulled this like a huge pink thing and I&rsquo;m like, let&rsquo;s take a picture.</p>
<p>And so she stood there and took a picture, but then she grabbed the camera because I</p>
<p>flipped it and showed it to her and her eyes got huge and she grabbed it and she ran inside</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, oh, that&rsquo;s gone forever.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s over for you.</p>
<p>And then she came out and she kind of snuck out and I went in and grabbed it and the mom</p>
<p>lifted up her burqa and was showing me that she like shaved her legs to be more Western.</p>
<p>And I was just, at that moment, I don&rsquo;t know that I could have realized how much that moment</p>
<p>affected me, how much that moment would affect me later on in my life until it&rsquo;s been later</p>
<p>on in my life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little like glimmers like that in parts of the world that are basically you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking away everything from the populace, like freedoms and so on.</p>
<p>And when they, when you see that glimmer of humanity, like yeah, shaved legs or like using</p>
<p>technology for the first time, it&rsquo;s magic or like food being presented with certain</p>
<p>kinds of foods that you&rsquo;ve never tried.</p>
<p>I mean, you want to see true, like joy of discovery is you bring basically the American</p>
<p>supermarket, anything from it to most parts of the world.</p>
<p>And they, I just, I mean, I remember even, I mean, we weren&rsquo;t like in poverty in Russia,</p>
<p>just poor, but just the supermarket was full of joy.</p>
<p>I thought I could just die happy in an American supermarket when I first saw it.</p>
<p>And how old were you when you came here?</p>
<p>13.</p>
<p>Did you speak English?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not well, I thought I was, I never was good at languages.</p>
<p>So I, it was very much like why would I need to learn another language?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It was that attitude is very like, doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, well, no, I think culturally in,</p>
<p>not only in America, but everywhere else in the world, it&rsquo;s constantly kind of seen, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good thing to do to learn other languages, especially English, because it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the language of the world.</p>
<p>And I just thought like, I don&rsquo;t need English to discover the beauty of the world.</p>
<p>Like this doesn&rsquo;t like, I enjoy life.</p>
<p>I enjoy soccer.</p>
<p>I enjoy, I don&rsquo;t remember what else I enjoyed in life, but math, like why do I need English</p>
<p>for this?</p>
<p>So that kind of attitude got me in a lot of trouble when I came here because I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You were reluctant?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But also just couldn&rsquo;t speak well.</p>
<p>And when you move 13 years old, it&rsquo;s middle school, you get made fun of a lot.</p>
<p>You get bullied and all those kinds of things, which in retrospect is a very positive thing</p>
<p>because it makes you harder.</p>
<p>I thought being Russian would be like hard enough.</p>
<p>No, well, me, everyone is different.</p>
<p>I mean, the part of the Russian thing is kind of, I&rsquo;m joking because if you know me, I admire</p>
<p>being hard.</p>
<p>I admire fighting and these kinds of things, these, what would you call them?</p>
<p>Struggle in all of its forms, martial arts, wrestling, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m ultimately like, I&rsquo;m so much about love.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m clearly sensitive to the world in some weird genetic way that it was important</p>
<p>for me to harden up when I came here and I was in love with people and everybody&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>mean to me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what, that, it&rsquo;s a little like slap, like, oh, okay, life is not often fair.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when for me personally, everybody has different journeys of hardship that are</p>
<p>much, much more difficult, like your story is much more difficult.</p>
<p>I started to read a lot.</p>
<p>Something happens, some kind of challenge where you start to think about the world,</p>
<p>start to think about yourself, that can ultimately create really interesting minds.</p>
<p>It can break some people.</p>
<p>It can create interesting minds.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s ultimately your choice.</p>
<p>But those people are weak and then they just need to be weeded out.</p>
<p>I thought we talked about this, you know, the strong will survive, the weak will die</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re talking Russian to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not speaking Russian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just giving solid life advice.</p>
<p>Just be harder and then everyone will be fine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your inner David Goggins coming out real quick here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The fob.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then I was just explaining to you that the way it is run, you&rsquo;re going to love this.</p>
<p>When we walked up to those tents for the first time, the people that were there before us</p>
<p>left us a noose.</p>
<p>I have a photo of it, like hanging from the tent, like at the front of the tent, like</p>
<p>welcome.</p>
<p>So you were also mentioning like the dark humor of it is a basically a funny joke.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was funny at first.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty funny.</p>
<p>It was funny during the time.</p>
<p>Now when I look back at it, I was like, come on.</p>
<p>I mean, I get it because they had already been there.</p>
<p>And like, so afterwards I can see how it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Now with like the suicide epidemic in the veteran community, now I&rsquo;m like, oh, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>post that photo.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that dark humor still somehow help even when you&rsquo;re considering suicide?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Some of it.</p>
<p>Somehow.</p>
<p>It makes it copable.</p>
<p>Somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not hiding it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like humor is one of the ways to reveal the reality of abuse, of suffering.</p>
<p>If you look at, there&rsquo;s this photo that generates right around suicide prevention month, which</p>
<p>is September.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always like a photo of like Robin Williams and Bourdain and all of these other</p>
<p>individuals who were comedians who all took their lives and they&rsquo;re all smiling.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, this is the face of depression.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a way our brains work where humor is a necessary part of survival, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>used for joyous things or it&rsquo;s used for ways to cope through life.</p>
<p>For me in the military, humor was one of the things that helped get me through.</p>
<p>And it still does to this day, frankly, because humor, humor makes some of the horrific things</p>
<p>I say not seem so horrific.</p>
<p>And people can digest it rather than being like, you need to be locked up somewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, I mean, one of the aspects of Russian humor, there&rsquo;s a darkness to it because</p>
<p>through it reverberates all the millions of people who died.</p>
<p>And it seems like the only way to make sense of it is to joke about it.</p>
<p>I still love it.</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;ll break you.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>Or also humor just seems to be the highest form of us humans and the human experience.</p>
<p>It just seems, it seems to somehow accumulate the full thing, the absurdity of it, the unfairness</p>
<p>of it, because like ultimately all the suffering is like, it&rsquo;s all just apes fighting for power</p>
<p>and love and somehow torturing each other in the process.</p>
<p>Hello podcast listener, Lex here.</p>
<p>Quick intermission to say that some of the names in the following story have been silenced</p>
<p>out to protect their privacy.</p>
<p>The story of, and witnessing, I think your first, somebody you met, somebody you saw,</p>
<p>somebody you began to be close with, his life, him dying, can you tell the story of him dying?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>I will tell you that I am going to leave some of the names out of the people because they</p>
<p>have reached out and asked that I do such.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been informed of other things I forgot that happened during the thing that</p>
<p>were way worse than I thought.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll try to add those in because that&rsquo;s new information to me because my brain has</p>
<p>blocked it out.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been told, which is good because it&rsquo;s better detail.</p>
<p>So we were doing a movement that morning and we were going from compound to compound.</p>
<p>I was never told what we were doing.</p>
<p>I knew what my job was.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the operational overview.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know who we were looking for.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there for that.</p>
<p>My job was specifically to look after the women and children and to provide support</p>
<p>if need be.</p>
<p>And when you have certain people, so i.e. the bomb dog handler and the bomb dog, and</p>
<p>then you have the medics and then you have a female searcher, there&rsquo;s only one of those</p>
<p>in each unit or if there&rsquo;s even one in each unit.</p>
<p>I got passed between units so that they could have access to me for both.</p>
<p>And we were kind of sitting and we were waiting for the all clear to move.</p>
<p>And at that time, the compound wall I was leaning up against, I had my back up against.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t facing the direct direction where it actually blew up.</p>
<p>I had my back to it and I had happened to turn and look to the left.</p>
<p>And on the right hand side across the road of where we were leaned up against was another</p>
<p>compound two stories high, people inside, a sniper on the roof and a spotter.</p>
<p>There was a handful of us on this wall and in front of me, there was a road.</p>
<p>The road went straight.</p>
<p>That compounds here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another road here on the right hand side in front of it.</p>
<p>And then this road went along here and this was a wide open space.</p>
<p>Just a huge.</p>
<p>We hate those.</p>
<p>You hate those because it&rsquo;s too much space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like fish in a barrel.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be in that field.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s too much line of sight line of sight.</p>
<p>Could be IEDs.</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>It could be anything.</p>
<p>And so when I was leaning up against the wall, we had sent a couple of people ahead to go</p>
<p>and clear the road so that we could all go along it and then clear the gray pup off to</p>
<p>the left hand side.</p>
<p>We are doing that because they use those locations to put IEDs so that when you&rsquo;re going to search</p>
<p>it, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a better chance of you blowing into a million pieces, essentially</p>
<p>why they love that.</p>
<p>Put bombs in small places, send people into small places.</p>
<p>Small places go boom, they paint the walls.</p>
<p>So we were just kind of sitting and waiting.</p>
<p>And then I turned, I happened to turn, I was looking in that direction and I heard the</p>
<p>ground shake before I even realized what I was seeing with my own eyes.</p>
<p>The ground shook and I saw a big piece of a body, I think it was the torso, just kind</p>
<p>of fly through the air and land into the field.</p>
<p>And as soon as that happened, all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>It was like the, they were sitting and watching and waiting and they do that.</p>
<p>And I say they, I mean the Taliban, they do that.</p>
<p>They love that because then they can record it for propaganda and they can use it against</p>
<p>us and they just love being able to take our people out.</p>
<p>And we had the interpreter sitting beside me and he had the ICOM radio on.</p>
<p>And as soon as the blast went off, I heard just the scream of, I heard it.</p>
<p>And I knew what that meant, but I couldn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t understand what was about to happen.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t, I couldn&rsquo;t wrap my brain around what was about to happen because I had never</p>
<p>been outside the wire.</p>
<p>And people are like, people say to me now, they&rsquo;re like, no, no, there&rsquo;s no way that</p>
<p>shit&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that she was involved in that and then that, and then in that, and then</p>
<p>in that.</p>
<p>Well, let me explain.</p>
<p>I was one person.</p>
<p>I was being passed around to units.</p>
<p>I was with a ton of different people.</p>
<p>I had no comms and I was just being told where to go.</p>
<p>And I just happened to be like a shit hit the fan magnet, it felt like.</p>
<p>And then I found out later it was not just me, it was all of us were getting it.</p>
<p>So that made me feel better because then I was like, well, I have a lot of survivor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guilt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a thing that&rsquo;s still stuck with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked through a lot of shit, but survivor&rsquo;s guilt, that&rsquo;s a big one for me.</p>
<p>And food is a big one for me and my food skin on food.</p>
<p>So like chicken with skin on it, just because of the biology of death, just when you hold</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s bodies in your hands with no gloves on, you know what that feels like when you</p>
<p>touch raw meat again, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what that feels like when, when it&rsquo;s a dying or dead body.</p>
<p>Well, my friend was blown into a million pieces, so I just had pieces of him.</p>
<p>So there was no, there was no differentiator of like, this was his thigh, or this was his</p>
<p>torso, or there was like, there was none of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one instance with the boot, but at that point we had been in some firefights,</p>
<p>and we had been taking some rounds, but it was more like take around, you know, get hit</p>
<p>and then we duck into a compound and we would set up and then we&rsquo;d be firing.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t, I wasn&rsquo;t really involved in a lot of the firefights until after this.</p>
<p>After that, the rest of the week, I was like, I was angry and I wanted them all to go.</p>
<p>And I wanted to be in every position to take them out myself.</p>
<p>So I put myself in every position.</p>
<p>So I made sure I was on the roof.</p>
<p>I made sure I was there.</p>
<p>I made sure, Hey, you need something, I&rsquo;ll fucking run it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if I die anymore, because as soon as that happened, my light switch went</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter anymore to me.</p>
<p>Can you go through what happens?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So are you hearing the, these screams?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the ID went off and what had happened was they put an ID inside of a grape hut and the</p>
<p>grape hut has rectangular wall, rectangular holes in the wall.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just like one door and it&rsquo;s this tall mud hut with just all these like holes</p>
<p>in it.</p>
<p>And they had put an ID underneath a pile of sticks and had a metal detector, the Brits</p>
<p>carry them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen, I think other countries have them, but I&rsquo;ve only ever seen them use it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we were kind of detecting if there was an ID, we must&rsquo;ve hit it, the sticks</p>
<p>or something and it set it off.</p>
<p>And it just, it was over.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way he felt anything.</p>
<p>And then there was another guy at the door bent down on one knee and he was facing and</p>
<p>kind of watching for, and then a blast hit him on this side.</p>
<p>And so it took him out and pulled his kid off, pulled his helmet off, pulled everything</p>
<p>off, fucked him all up.</p>
<p>Big time.</p>
<p>This is one ID.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it was in a contained area and he was in the doorway, up and out.</p>
<p>Can you explain what an ID is and how does it work?</p>
<p>I can do my best.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re improvised explosive devices.</p>
<p>They can be used pretty much out of anything to make anything.</p>
<p>So garbage, when we got to Afghanistan, they did the ID meeting with us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, these are what we&rsquo;re finding that they would show us diffused IDs.</p>
<p>So they would see those big blue drums filled with gasoline buried in the ground.</p>
<p>You would see a wire, it would go to a pressure plate.</p>
<p>You hit the pressure plate, that would hit that and it would go.</p>
<p>You would see IDs.</p>
<p>Some of them were ridiculous.</p>
<p>The engineering that went into some of these was hilarious because they were thinking,</p>
<p>they were thinking to use everything they could.</p>
<p>There was a cigarette pack they had used.</p>
<p>They lined the inside with tinfoil and when you stepped on the tinfoil, it had a piece</p>
<p>of wire and it was enough of a spark to set off a line of batteries that we had thrown</p>
<p>out that were all dead.</p>
<p>When you fuse them all together, there was enough juice to make it go.</p>
<p>Then they would attach that to like, like phosphorus or gasoline or whatever they could</p>
<p>that would make a big boom.</p>
<p>They would use, yeah, that&rsquo;s why you never kick garbage on the ground.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never see me kick something on the ground.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see me walk around it always.</p>
<p>If I ever see a pile of rocks or something that looks like it shouldn&rsquo;t be there, I won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>walk near it.</p>
<p>Even now, because they use that pile of rocks to remind people there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what that means, but we know that something&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And very often they would use anything, garbage, wires.</p>
<p>We were very, we had to burn everything for a reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so terrifying to not, for the source of death to be like little parts of the environment</p>
<p>and then people that don&rsquo;t look like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not dressed as soldiers, like civilians and like regular, because then you, when you</p>
<p>have to come back or even there is you&rsquo;re just surrounded by danger and then you distrust</p>
<p>everything essentially.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem and that&rsquo;s why you have such PTSD issues with the soldiers we have</p>
<p>now because you&rsquo;re in the environment in which it&rsquo;s very similar.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this one IED.</p>
<p>So this one IED, I still don&rsquo;t know what it was, went off, body flew, the guy at the door,</p>
<p>he kicked out.</p>
<p>He was all broken and bleeding and a mess.</p>
<p>At that point, the radio started going crazy.</p>
<p>I could hear the guys yelling and screaming, trying to figure it out and then you could</p>
<p>hear the numbers being called.</p>
<p>KIA number, number, number, number.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anybody&rsquo;s service number.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Next thing you know, mortar rounds start coming down and live fire starts happening and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like, holy fuck, things are popping off.</p>
<p>And I remember just looking at and being like, we need to go, we need to go now.</p>
<p>And I just got this like, I was like, we&rsquo;re going and they&rsquo;re like, hold on Burns and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, we&rsquo;re fucking going.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t dealing with it well and they&rsquo;re like, all right, all right, go, go, go, go.</p>
<p>So we went and I helped out with that other individual, kind of held him down, started</p>
<p>doing medic work on him and he just kept saying, where&rsquo;s, where&rsquo;s, where&rsquo;s, he was in such</p>
<p>a state of shock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen somebody&rsquo;s eyeballs so big in my life.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, where&rsquo;s, where&rsquo;s, where&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s good buddy, he&rsquo;s good, he&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Picture like a super thick Scottish accent though, because these guys were just, and</p>
<p>when they talk fast, it&rsquo;s even worse.</p>
<p>And then so I ran over and we jumped down into the ditch along the side of the road</p>
<p>because the road hadn&rsquo;t been cleared and we&rsquo;re running through these tall, they look like</p>
<p>cannabis plants, but they&rsquo;re not, but it just very thick bush and I felt like I was running</p>
<p>in slow motion.</p>
<p>So if you picture one of your video games where like the tunnel vision and you&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>you can hear your breathing is like that and you&rsquo;re running and you can&rsquo;t move fast enough</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like trying to get there and we hit the road and the rounds are coming down</p>
<p>and mortars are coming down and they&rsquo;re like, okay, on three run.</p>
<p>So we run on three and we run into the compound, I mean, into the great putt.</p>
<p>And I remember looking around and very seriously going, where is he?</p>
<p>Just genuinely asking, I think it was been messaging me and he&rsquo;s been incredible.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the best soldiers I&rsquo;ve ever served with.</p>
<p>He was a higher up, so he was running part of this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s messaged me and he was giving me some information and he&rsquo;s like, I was in there</p>
<p>with you and he goes, I remember cause you handed me the boot and cause I walked over</p>
<p>and I, all the rounds were like, we were being shot at, mortars were coming down, but it</p>
<p>was this slow motion and I remember walking over to the hole in the ground and seeing</p>
<p>his boot in the ground, but it was, his leg was still hanging, like just below his knee</p>
<p>was still in it, but the boot was perfectly laced up, like the boot was fine.</p>
<p>And I just, I held it and I turned and I looked at the guys and I was like, we could reuse</p>
<p>the boot.</p>
<p>Now that wasn&rsquo;t even, what is, what is that?</p>
<p>Was that, was that actually an intelligent attempt at humor or was it some kind of deeply</p>
<p>lost?</p>
<p>Like you were completely just lost.</p>
<p>I think my brain broke.</p>
<p>I think my, that&rsquo;s the moment I call my light switch went off.</p>
<p>Did you understand that he was dead at that point?</p>
<p>Like intellectually, you were just something, it just broke.</p>
<p>No emotion.</p>
<p>Like it just broke.</p>
<p>It just shattered.</p>
<p>It shattered.</p>
<p>I felt it happen.</p>
<p>Felt.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel, I didn&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>
<p>It just broke.</p>
<p>And at that moment, because later there&rsquo;s some anger almost at that moment, none of</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend what happened.</p>
<p>I knew he wasn&rsquo;t there anymore because they looked at me and said, what&rsquo;s here is here.</p>
<p>Start grabbing pieces.</p>
<p>We need to fucking move.</p>
<p>And so I handed the boot over, they took it and then I started just grabbing anything</p>
<p>out of the walls because those little rectangular just had flesh hanging from it.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have my gloves on because I only used them to search.</p>
<p>So you want to bring everything back.</p>
<p>This is what, even if they&rsquo;re dead, do you want to save, save those you served with?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because they deserve that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t deserve to have a piece of them drug behind a truck for propaganda.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>What are the others?</p>
<p>I mean, was there just a focus on mission or was there a panic?</p>
<p>No panic with these guys.</p>
<p>These guys were the most switched on motherfuckers I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life.</p>
<p>They, we started grabbing and remind me, he said, you know, you, uh, that&rsquo;s not, he goes,</p>
<p>when people say that&rsquo;s the worst part of your day, that wasn&rsquo;t even the worst part of your</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>Do you remember when you handed me the bag of intestines?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, I do though.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s parts you don&rsquo;t even, they&rsquo;re just not.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t register.</p>
<p>Because I had some people contact me and be like, you didn&rsquo;t tell it right.</p>
<p>And war is subjective and war is from your perspective and war is messy and horrific</p>
<p>and war is graphic and violent and painful.</p>
<p>Your brain remembers what it wants to remember and your brain allows you to remember what</p>
<p>it allows you to remember and there&rsquo;s reasons that you don&rsquo;t remember everything.</p>
<p>And so we were getting, we were really getting hit.</p>
<p>We were getting, it was bad.</p>
<p>And some of the guys, machine gunners had come up to do cover fire and I know, uh, we</p>
<p>were calling in for air support to come pick up the guys, uh, because they had to go.</p>
<p>And we, we just collected everything we could, but I did remember screaming like, we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get them all.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t get them all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way we got them all.</p>
<p>We did not fucking get them all.</p>
<p>And I remember one of the guys looking at me being like, we got them, we got them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, we didn&rsquo;t fucking get them.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t get them.</p>
<p>Like, no, we got them.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t say it enough.</p>
<p>And so I grabbed as much as I could.</p>
<p>I, I, I, um, I slung one of their weapons and it was just a twisted heap and I had his</p>
<p>helmet and someone else&rsquo;s helmet in my arm.</p>
<p>And then I had, um, my weapon in front of me and I was carrying it.</p>
<p>And then we, we piled everything we had onto a stretcher.</p>
<p>Those things are super fucking flimsy anyway.</p>
<p>And there was a couple of guys in front of us and there were a couple behind me and I</p>
<p>was kind of in the middle and we, we said, okay, we&rsquo;re just gonna have to run.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to fucking run the road.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to have to run it.</p>
<p>It was a chance.</p>
<p>We ran it and that was the closest, well, that was I guess not the closest, but it felt</p>
<p>like it was the closest I could hear the, the whiz of the rounds going by me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird noise when they&rsquo;re coming at you than when you&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re leaving you.</p>
<p>And so they, that slowed everything down for me.</p>
<p>And then one of the guys accidentally dropped the edge of the stretcher and everything fell</p>
<p>off into the ditch and then we had to go back down and get it back up.</p>
<p>And then so we kept running and we finally got back into the compound that that sniper</p>
<p>was sitting off on the right hand side and we got all in there.</p>
<p>And I know the, I think said there was two flights.</p>
<p>I only thought there was one, but apparently there was two flights.</p>
<p>So went on one, his body went on one.</p>
<p>And then I think, I think he said went on the other and and then they took off.</p>
<p>And then when they leave though, they rain hell down on anything they can see on the</p>
<p>ground.</p>
<p>And that is a beautiful sight because they had mortar rounds coming down and it just,</p>
<p>it was getting really, really bad.</p>
<p>And then as soon as the black ox took off, all of a sudden it just stopped and went quiet,</p>
<p>like deafening quiet.</p>
<p>And we were sitting inside the compound and I, one of the medics looked at me and you</p>
<p>could see, and I still do it now and I, I&rsquo;m working on not doing it, but I do it when</p>
<p>I get really overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t have any gloves on, I had blood all over my hands and just like body</p>
<p>and stuff.</p>
<p>So he came over and he just gave me like sanitizer and I started rubbing.</p>
<p>And so I rub, I do this when I&rsquo;m stressed, I&rsquo;ll rub my hands.</p>
<p>And I still can&rsquo;t, I still can&rsquo;t do, I still can&rsquo;t eat food with skin on it.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t like, like salmon and stuff, like I can&rsquo;t, anything with skin, I can&rsquo;t touch</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m making meat at home, like for my husband and my son, like I have like meat gloves and</p>
<p>then I have like a fork and a knife and I&rsquo;m like cutting it.</p>
<p>Like I never touch it, I can&rsquo;t touch it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something almost like the texture of the biology of a human flesh that just,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s at the level of, that&rsquo;s the level of your trauma.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been, I mean, it&rsquo;s 2021, this was in 09.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve worked on this, like, and I mean, I&rsquo;ve been in like treatment religiously,</p>
<p>just to be able to keep me alive for this decade.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not like, it&rsquo;s like, oh, I&rsquo;ve never, you never even tried to get better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I never really used to leave my house.</p>
<p>I used to call people that looked like that horrific names in public.</p>
<p>I used to want to kill people on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fairly happy individual now.</p>
<p>What about, so you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re talking about sort of skin and parts and, but there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>just the fact that we&rsquo;re mortal and there&rsquo;s somebody close to you who dies.</p>
<p>So you watch, walk up and then never come back out again?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re facing mortality in a very real way.</p>
<p>And if, in a, in a way that&rsquo;s not the same as somebody dying from cancer in a hospital,</p>
<p>so it has echoes of that because that&rsquo;s also absurd.</p>
<p>And like, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s justice to it in any kind of way, but it&rsquo;s so sudden.</p>
<p>Like, have you been able to make sense of that, of your feelings about it?</p>
<p>Like how do you feel about it or, or is everything just shrouded in this like trauma that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not able to just feel for the loss of a human being, like mourn the loss of a human being?</p>
<p>I think I had, when he, when I realized he wasn&rsquo;t there, when I realized that he, um,</p>
<p>that was the, I, that was what was left of him, I found out afterwards there was other</p>
<p>parts that were outside and went back.</p>
<p>I think, I think he said went back and they got, they ended up getting the rest of him.</p>
<p>So that made me happy because I just found this out this week.</p>
<p>Uh, so that, that means, so that means you have a feeling like you still feel like parts</p>
<p>of them were left behind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On the ramp ceremony, when I lost my mind, literally I, I lost my mind and I was screaming</p>
<p>that he wasn&rsquo;t all in there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy now knowing that he was, but I held onto that for 10 years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This, um, yeah, the sandbags, like, like it&rsquo;s the bulk of the weight is, is not from human</p>
<p>flesh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He was a young kid too.</p>
<p>It was, I think it was his first deployment as well.</p>
<p>Like he was, he was a young kid and he was just, just going to clear the road for the</p>
<p>rest of us.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like not like, you know, you&rsquo;re in war and you know that you&rsquo;re outside the wire and</p>
<p>you know, things could happen.</p>
<p>You understand that to the extent you can understand that when it&rsquo;s happening, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something very different.</p>
<p>Also maybe you can correct me, but, um, there&rsquo;s something much more like brutal about an IED.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s proficuous.</p>
<p>Versus like a bullet, cause a bullet, you still watching somebody close to you die from</p>
<p>a bullet, you still get to the basic humanity.</p>
<p>Like so IED basically converted a human being into sort of parts by biological parts.</p>
<p>A cheeseburger.</p>
<p>Versus, yeah, I mean, I don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s tough because that&rsquo;s like, um, because it&rsquo;s hard for you to remember them as a human.</p>
<p>You remember them as parts.</p>
<p>For me, that&rsquo;s how I remember him.</p>
<p>I would like to, I have a picture that I post every year about him.</p>
<p>I see that, but I don&rsquo;t put two and two together.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it does.</p>
<p>So I, even I listening to your story and, you know, um, thank you for sharing it first</p>
<p>of all, but, um, it&rsquo;s not my, it&rsquo;s, well, I&rsquo;m just the one to tell it.</p>
<p>I was just involved one, one set of eyes on this particular human being.</p>
<p>But even I get angry.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s exhaustion or anger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I look always exhausted.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re into robotics.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that like your guys&rsquo;s thing?</p>
<p>You guys are just always working on, I think because I feel so much for the world.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t do, we were talking about resting bitch face earlier.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t feel the need to maintain, um, all the effort of the musculature for presenting</p>
<p>myself to you visually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exhausting.</p>
<p>So I just focus on the feeling.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>Face show, whatever the hell it shows.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Was there anger?</p>
<p>Was there hate?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you just talk to your feelings of what you remember?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So after that operation with the British, I went back to the Canadians and I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go back as even remotely close to who I was when I left.</p>
<p>And that was really troublesome for a lot of people around me because the level of anger</p>
<p>and hate that came out of me was palpable when I just walked by, um, I got shockingly</p>
<p>quiet and you understand how you&rsquo;re learning how to be terrified if you are quiet.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if hate and anger do that justice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know another word, but I don&rsquo;t think those two words do it justice to the extent</p>
<p>that I was feeling like I got to a point when I got attacked by a woman, um, with some scissors,</p>
<p>like the idea crossed my mind, like I could boot stomp her to death and not feel anything</p>
<p>about it in front of her, all of her family and her kids.</p>
<p>Was it more like just not recognizing the basic humanity or was it legit hatred?</p>
<p>No, it was legit hatred, but also I no longer saw those people as humans.</p>
<p>It took one event.</p>
<p>And when that happened, the rest of the operation that was echoed in my, in the way I was to</p>
<p>those people.</p>
<p>But to what level can you see those people as human?</p>
<p>So this is where, well, like this is where Jaco shut down, um, I still think I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>Um, there&rsquo;s a dire straight song called, uh, brothers in arms and, um, actually anyway,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re fools to make war on our brothers in arms.</p>
<p>And I brought that up to Jaco because it&rsquo;s humans on both sides, but he said, not in</p>
<p>Iraq like to him, he&rsquo;s like, no, that&rsquo;s the enemy.</p>
<p>These are people who use the civilians.</p>
<p>They rape, they torture, they they&rsquo;ll do anything.</p>
<p>And they put evil onto the world.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, so they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re stood on at that moment.</p>
<p>Like the, these two were humans and it&rsquo;s politicians waging war and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kids on both sides.</p>
<p>But then Jaco was like, no, he&rsquo;s not wrong.</p>
<p>So which can you carry both things with you as a soldier?</p>
<p>I think when I was a soldier, I could only carry one thing with me.</p>
<p>I think my perspective has changed drastically, but not because I&rsquo;ve lost the reality that</p>
<p>they are the enemy, but I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve gained my humanity back again.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I lost when I was there.</p>
<p>I lost all humanity.</p>
<p>I lost all hope for humanity.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not wrong when he says the Taliban or like when he was in Iraq, but for me, the</p>
<p>Taliban are evil.</p>
<p>I still hold a spot of hatred for them that could set this building on fire.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know that anybody can fully understand that when you watch what they do</p>
<p>to women and do kids and they do it in the name of God, they are the enemy.</p>
<p>They are less than, they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re barely worth the bullets we put into them.</p>
<p>But then because they use civilians, so like then everybody becomes the enemy.</p>
<p>And how are you supposed to make sense of that?</p>
<p>Like what you get, but here, Lex, you can&rsquo;t make sense of it.</p>
<p>This is why they&rsquo;ve done a really good job of blending into the civilian population.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done it intentionally.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done it on purpose.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re brilliant.</p>
<p>This is why you guys couldn&rsquo;t beat them.</p>
<p>This is why we couldn&rsquo;t fucking beat them.</p>
<p>They use their people so effectively.</p>
<p>They have no shame in that.</p>
<p>They have no issue with that.</p>
<p>They take no qualms with wiping a kid off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>If it means they can get close enough to a soldier to throw a fucking bomb into their</p>
<p>tank.</p>
<p>This is why they&rsquo;re affected.</p>
<p>How do you beat them then?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this, there&rsquo;s no winning that you just basically do policeman type work or you</p>
<p>do your best.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>So the other is you come from an artillery background.</p>
<p>A fucking hellfire missile hit the whole place off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t beat radicalism like that right now.</p>
<p>The problem is, is we&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve let it go unchecked.</p>
<p>We had it kind of in check for 20 years.</p>
<p>We just shot ourselves in the foot, the chest and the face.</p>
<p>So the problem with force is it creates longterm hate because young kids and propaganda and</p>
<p>like propaganda works.</p>
<p>So you, you see your father, your brother die because of a bomb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to convince that person that they died because of evil Americans and tell</p>
<p>whatever story you want about America or Canada, Russia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest problem.</p>
<p>So it seems like there gotta be better solutions because I mean, I talk about love, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s honestly basically figuring out sneaky ways of empowering women, of educating people</p>
<p>of like, and like, and not in a cheesy way, but like in the same level of like mass warfare,</p>
<p>but with love.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about DARPA budgets, DOD budgets, but like do that where you educate and empower</p>
<p>women by force.</p>
<p>And it, you know, they want to learn, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not like forcing anybody, you&rsquo;re setting them free.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>Like combat flip flops does this.</p>
<p>They do this.</p>
<p>They give literacy.</p>
<p>They teach girls to read nothing else to read because as soon as you can read, you know</p>
<p>what that happens.</p>
<p>You know what happens then.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s combat flip flops?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the scarf right there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s made in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>So when you buy something from them, the proceeds go to literacy in Afghanistan for girls.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve given literacy to 800 girls over there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really cool.</p>
<p>Uh, Griff owns the one, he was an army ranger and his buddy, but Lee, I think is his name.</p>
<p>They were on Shark Tank a long time ago, but they, um, they do shoes and I think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>called Schmongs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to say it properly.</p>
<p>Built in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then the proceeds go back there.</p>
<p>They do great work for literacy and you know, as well as anyone, if you can teach someone</p>
<p>to read good color, dark, like your soul lacks matches on the inside, just on the inside.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>The outside is just the, it&rsquo;s just the suit.</p>
<p>I feel like you think that&rsquo;s your suit of armor, but I feel like it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>See what were you saying?</p>
<p>Sorry, what were you saying?</p>
<p>I was saying go on.</p>
<p>I will allow this.</p>
<p>All right, I think there is room if you teach education.</p>
<p>The problem is we&rsquo;ve taken a massive step backwards.</p>
<p>I know that the Taliban have just instituted, uh, this week honor killings will be back.</p>
<p>Stonings are back and, um, uh, dismemberment as well.</p>
<p>Holly McKay is the reporter that&rsquo;s been reporting that from the ground.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>The way to pull people, in my opinion, out of something like that is through education.</p>
<p>Well we just took all of that away, which is pretty horrific in my opinion because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taught over 20 years.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re perfectly right, Lex.</p>
<p>When you say that hate and violence won&rsquo;t work, it won&rsquo;t because you see dad get killed</p>
<p>on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Well that 14 year old little boy is going to pick up an AK 47 and go avenge dad&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>Well, we think about it, you were there for 20 years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of generations in there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another generation that&rsquo;s either grown up in this or has seen enough of this.</p>
<p>So there are always going to be a subset that think that we&rsquo;re the enemy and fair.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t done always the greatest things, but the one thing that we have done that I</p>
<p>did participate in was giving literacy, giving girls an opportunity, letting them know that</p>
<p>you aren&rsquo;t second class citizens.</p>
<p>You can do things too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have to look at war differently.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s times for violence.</p>
<p>Oh, there is time for violence and there is time for missiles and there is time for detainees</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s times for bagging tags and double tops of the fucking face.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s times for all of that, but there needs to be more time to educate.</p>
<p>The problem is you can&rsquo;t educate if you&rsquo;re in a country where their culture doesn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>in that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many different things that you, it&rsquo;s an almost an impossible situation.</p>
<p>When you look at the 20 years in Afghanistan and we just pulled out, there&rsquo;s a sudden pull</p>
<p>out of troops.</p>
<p>What do you think about those 20 years?</p>
<p>Let me ask hard question, which is, was it worth it going into Afghanistan?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re sort of, you&rsquo;re one person.</p>
<p>My limited capacity.</p>
<p>You have experienced specific set of extremely difficult things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve met a lot of humans.</p>
<p>You understand certain aspects of the way this war is carried out.</p>
<p>But if you zoomed out at the big story, like you&rsquo;re, you like history too.</p>
<p>When you think of the history, a hundred years from now, we look at the invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think you need to go far that back to know that it was, we went in on false</p>
<p>pretenses.</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not a good start.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that saying?</p>
<p>Future behavior is a good, was it past behavior is a good indicator of future behavior.</p>
<p>So I struggle with that because when I first found out that the pullout was going to happen,</p>
<p>I got really angry because my government skated the whole situation because he&rsquo;s having a</p>
<p>snap.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s having a snap election.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening on the 20th.</p>
<p>So that was beautifully planned by my government to hold no accountability, zero accountability.</p>
<p>And the media won&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>They reached out to me to do an interview about Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And then I told them what was going on after I talked to my people that were on the ground</p>
<p>and then they canceled the interview.</p>
<p>When you say my government, is America any better at this, like it feels like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no accountability.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>The government, no, no, the American government is a dumpster fire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying, I&rsquo;m not saying that, but what I am saying is at least they sent people to</p>
<p>pull people or pull some people.</p>
<p>We sent no one to pull anyone.</p>
<p>And I know for a fact, because I helped move a family, I was fortunate enough to be given</p>
<p>an opportunity to help move a high value nine person family out of that country that worked</p>
<p>in the government, that worked in prosecuting the Taliban, that were on the top of the list.</p>
<p>I learned really quickly the ins and outs of things and I&rsquo;m really disgusted by it.</p>
<p>I learned that Canada had the one email address that all Canadian Afghani visa holders were</p>
<p>supposed to email, Ottawa put two people on that email address.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s confirmed.</p>
<p>Canada put no more than 70 people on the ground for that pullout and they were not allowed</p>
<p>to leave the airport and they left well before the pullout date.</p>
<p>They left on the Thursday before the Tuesday that was the 31st.</p>
<p>There were high value Canadian visa holders that are still in that country that are on</p>
<p>the top of the kill list.</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s not doing anything about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disgusted in the way my government has acted because number one, there&rsquo;s an active</p>
<p>lawsuit with veterans against the Supreme Court of Canada right now.</p>
<p>We are leaving our vets and our Canadians stranded over there and we are leaving the</p>
<p>vets that have been maimed by this war in Canada.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re turned down for everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been turned down for hearing loss.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s not military related.</p>
<p>They have PIs follow me.</p>
<p>This is normal behavior.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a veteran named Brock who was told by Trudeau in a meeting that after he lost</p>
<p>his leg, he was just trying to get a new prosthetic because it was just killing him.</p>
<p>Trudeau stood up in a meeting and said, you&rsquo;re just asking for too much.</p>
<p>Less than six months later, he gave $10.4 million to an Afghan terrorist that was in</p>
<p>the Canadian prison system.</p>
<p>He won and got 10.4 of our million taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that American government&rsquo;s any better, but what I do know is that the absolute</p>
<p>fucking machines of human beings that stepped outside of the chain of command to pull my</p>
<p>family out for me, I know they were there.</p>
<p>The British that stayed on the ground that I contacted to literally confirm my biometric</p>
<p>data and passports to get that family moved, they weren&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>That family would still be there.</p>
<p>That three year old that got the shit kicked out of him by the Taliban that I was trying</p>
<p>to exfil, Canada left him.</p>
<p>What is it about politicians and governments not willing to do their job?</p>
<p>Well, not willing to do a big part of the job, which is you send people to war, these</p>
<p>are heroes, and then you should spend most of the time repaying the debts to those, right?</p>
<p>What is it about, why can&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re disposable numbers, and we hire them out of high school when they&rsquo;re stupid</p>
<p>enough to not understand what they&rsquo;re going to get themselves into, and then we blame</p>
<p>it on themselves for making that decision by volunteering.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, this still doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a cop out.</p>
<p>I mean, Trudeau, I feel like he is a good human being that wants to do good for, I mean,</p>
<p>I tend to, I want to believe that leaders want to do good by the heroes of this world,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t, like, I don&rsquo;t understand the system of delusion you have to live in to</p>
<p>not understand who the heroes are.</p>
<p>Like, I refuse to believe Trudeau is somehow a bad person.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t met him though, have you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, actually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking about Trudeau without knowing, but I mean, in general, think that way about</p>
<p>leaders.</p>
<p>Like, they surround themselves by people who delude them, who like, they&rsquo;re yes people,</p>
<p>yes people that lead them into a kind of reality that becomes detached from actual reality.</p>
<p>And so they misunderstand the priorities of this world.</p>
<p>They think maybe some kind of special interest, they focus on that versus like the humans.</p>
<p>If you look back, was there a way we could have done something better in Afghanistan,</p>
<p>assuming we do the invasion?</p>
<p>Also, is it ultimately about taking care of the veterans, like, investing more money in</p>
<p>the education of women and liberating people who are suffering injustice in those parts</p>
<p>of the world?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s a better way to do it?</p>
<p>And one other aspect is, on the US side, paid over $6 trillion for the wars in the Middle</p>
<p>East since 9 11, so the financial side as well.</p>
<p>Is there something you can comment on things we could have done better?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a loaded question because you&rsquo;re talking to someone who had no hand in what happened</p>
<p>other than do this and do that.</p>
<p>So I can go from my perspective, which is there was probably plenty of things that we</p>
<p>could have been doing better.</p>
<p>I think there was a lack of leadership from the get go.</p>
<p>I think the preparation that the Canadian military gave me was nowhere sufficient for</p>
<p>a deployment of that level.</p>
<p>Mind you, things happen.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t realize things would happen, but yet they happen.</p>
<p>With little to absolutely no cultural idea was that I was walking into.</p>
<p>Like when the one male in the family grabbed the back of my vest because my hair was tucked</p>
<p>and he thought it was a man going into a room with a bunch of women, I couldn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>why he was attacking me.</p>
<p>There was no real breakdown of this is what you&rsquo;re going into, this is the culture, this</p>
<p>is why they do what they do, this is how they do it, this is how you should handle a situation</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>There was none of that.</p>
<p>Something I speak about frequently and I think it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge is when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing any of that training, we are giving none of our soldiers proper mental health</p>
<p>training, tools in that fucking toolbox or ways or things to look for on their buddy</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve created a system and a problem where if you say that you&rsquo;re ill or that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>struggling with PTSD, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s going to say that, they&rsquo;re going to keep struggling with it and that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>you get loose cannons, when you get problems happen, so you get fractures start to happen</p>
<p>in leadership and that&rsquo;s being seen and has been seen now for a while.</p>
<p>In terms of what we could have done, say for a better way to go into the country, a better</p>
<p>way to help the country, I can&rsquo;t speak to that as much as I wish I could because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that I would have all the answers.</p>
<p>What about withdrawal?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cold.</p>
<p>Do you think more gradual, you think it&rsquo;s better to maintain presence there for indefinitely?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that, but I do know we have bases, I say weeks, I serve with them,</p>
<p>Americans have bases in Japan, Americans have bases in Korea, Americans have bases in Germany.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s reasons there&rsquo;s bases everywhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a smart, there&rsquo;s an intellectual way to look at this.</p>
<p>You want to be able to have eyes and ears, can&rsquo;t have eyes and ears when you do things</p>
<p>like you just did.</p>
<p>The way that we pulled out of that country, that&rsquo;s right, the way that, I hate saying</p>
<p>American British because it puts like a blame on them.</p>
<p>I say we because I&rsquo;m a soldier, I&rsquo;m a NATO soldier.</p>
<p>The way we pulled out of that country, my five year old could have done it better.</p>
<p>He could have said, mommy, why are we not keeping that Bagram base?</p>
<p>Mommy, why are we not keeping that base just until we get everyone else that we need?</p>
<p>Why are we going to a civilian airport that we don&rsquo;t control, that we don&rsquo;t understand?</p>
<p>Mommy, why are we doing this when there&rsquo;s only one road to it?</p>
<p>My five year old would have that conversation with me.</p>
<p>It was so poorly done.</p>
<p>It was so poorly executed and no fault of the soldiers on the ground on their own.</p>
<p>My God, I can tell you there&rsquo;s operators, I just call them A, I don&rsquo;t say who he is</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s told me not to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy named A and there&rsquo;s another guy named R and there&rsquo;s a few other named</p>
<p>D and these guys, they gave everything to try to pull my family when no one else would</p>
<p>pull my family for me.</p>
<p>They just got me on the phone and said, I don&rsquo;t know who the fuck you&rsquo;re talking to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many people you&rsquo;re trying to get ahold of here, but you&rsquo;ve got everyone</p>
<p>looking for your family.</p>
<p>Six, I&rsquo;ve gone to everyone I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done stuff on Instagram.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a contact.</p>
<p>The contact called me.</p>
<p>I called them.</p>
<p>I was handling this family and when they call you and say, we can&rsquo;t go back to the gate,</p>
<p>my three year old just got beat up by the Taliban and they say, what do we do now?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Why am I being left to deal with this?</p>
<p>Why is the civilian and ex military population being left to deal with this?</p>
<p>Why was this not thought out?</p>
<p>We knew this was coming.</p>
<p>We knew the timeframe.</p>
<p>Yeah, I ultimately blame, it almost starts at the top always at the leadership, sorry,</p>
<p>this is the civilian leadership.</p>
<p>I think probably the generals know the right thing to do here.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re sometimes overzealous in terms of being, wanting to increase, I think the</p>
<p>great generals understand what&rsquo;s needed.</p>
<p>And then it takes great leadership on the civilian side to listen to the generals and</p>
<p>understand that war is not just about like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not binary.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s not about the invasion and saying mission accomplished.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the PR.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the full complexity of geopolitics.</p>
<p>Can I ask you this?</p>
<p>You can ask me whatever you want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at a book that you gave me, Do the Fucking Work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very motivating.</p>
<p>Good Fucking Design Advice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their company called Good Fucking Design Advice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I know, they&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the website?</p>
<p>GFDA.</p>
<p>Okay, so the F is for friendship.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>They are a design company.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve worked with Apple and Nike, and this is their book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been published by HarperCollins.</p>
<p>And it is really just, it&rsquo;s an incredible, they&rsquo;re an incredible company.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re artistically, like they&rsquo;re a design company, so you can see that.</p>
<p>You can see it&rsquo;s a design company.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, they signed it for you.</p>
<p>And the pages are beautiful, but they have a saying and then a paragraph about each saying.</p>
<p>Get fucking started, obstacles are fucking opportunities, fail, fail, and fucking fail</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>Ask for fucking help, show some fucking passion, finish the fucking job.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So we should send that to Biden.</p>
<p>So I&hellip;</p>
<p>She said it, I didn&rsquo;t say it.</p>
<p>Lex said it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say it.</p>
<p>Lex said it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it.</p>
<p>I should also send it to Trudeau as well.</p>
<p>So, but I mean, he probably won&rsquo;t know how to read it.</p>
<p>He just taught drama instead.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll send it to the previous four presidents.</p>
<p>How about that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>We can also send it to them too.</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re all just as much at fault.</p>
<p>So, and they, most of them have all the same last names, but okay.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about them quickly.</p>
<p>Cause we did a mug with them and I was really excited about it.</p>
<p>Not because it was a mug.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a mug person, but you are, that&rsquo;s your mug obsessive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obsessive about my mugs.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite mug?</p>
<p>Currently it&rsquo;s mine right now.</p>
<p>The one that I have with them.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The GMT mug.</p>
<p>What does it say on it?</p>
<p>Can I, do you want me to read what it says on it?</p>
<p>Yeah, please.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m really happy about it because we created this with them, with GFDA.</p>
<p>I found out about them because my husband&rsquo;s office, Atlas Neck Brace, he had his very</p>
<p>first office, he had one of their prints done and it was their original, like do the fucking</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>And I was really excited about them once I found out because I&rsquo;m like, well, fuck is</p>
<p>my middle name.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure that I am going to, whoever I work with, I want to make sure that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working with people that I believe in, that I believe what they stand for and I just</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re brilliant.</p>
<p>So I got on the phone with them and I said, hi, I would like you to sponsor my podcast.</p>
<p>And they said, cool.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your podcast?</p>
<p>And I was like, it&rsquo;s called Brass in Unity podcast and I want to work with you guys somewhere.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, okay, so like, what are you thinking?</p>
<p>And I said, you know, I&rsquo;m looking to do, I would love one day to do something with you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it would be, but I would like it to be something.</p>
<p>And they said, you know, we do like, we have this book, but we also have like shirts and</p>
<p>mugs with our sayings on them and prints.</p>
<p>And so I was thinking to myself, I was like, well, if I just did like a mug with them,</p>
<p>well then I could, you know, that could work for what my company does, which is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>jewelry company and sunglass company, but it could be like an add on kind of deal.</p>
<p>These guys are really good designers.</p>
<p>I can already tell.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I knew you would like this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I brought it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, certain people would appreciate this.</p>
<p>And so my whole thing, my, my like hashtag is work hard, help harder.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the whole concept of what I do now.</p>
<p>And so we did a mug and it&rsquo;s called fucking help somebody.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their like first tag.</p>
<p>And then the rest is kindness is a wealth that increases as it is given away.</p>
<p>What you get in return isn&rsquo;t passed between hands, but felt between hearts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s precisely because you&rsquo;ve been at the bottom that you can raise others up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve, sorry, I&rsquo;m reading a photo here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been lost in the dark.</p>
<p>You can lead others to the light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you fought with yourself that you can bring peace to someone else.</p>
<p>You now have the strength because you&rsquo;ve once struggled the best you have to come, the best</p>
<p>you have to come from the fucking worst you&rsquo;ve had to take.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, this is the mug there and we&rsquo;re sold out of them.</p>
<p>We just got a bunch of.</p>
<p>What does it say?</p>
<p>Fucking help.</p>
<p>Fucking help somebody.</p>
<p>And so we did, they were so gracious enough to sit with me and be like, what do you want</p>
<p>the copy to be like?</p>
<p>And I said, what do you think I want it to be like?</p>
<p>What would you, if you could write one for me, what it&rsquo;d be?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s going to be around lifting people up.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, cool.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, do you want fuck in the title?</p>
<p>And I was like, every other word, if we can have it.</p>
<p>And they said, we&rsquo;ll just do once.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, I compromise.</p>
<p>And so we came up with that copy and we put it on a mug and we&rsquo;re going to be doing a</p>
<p>shirt with them.</p>
<p>But the, the whole thing to me was that, that embodied what I stand for now and the healing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to now and the point I&rsquo;ve gotten to now in my life, because that fucking sand</p>
<p>pit almost broke me, like off the face of the earth broke me.</p>
<p>First of all, can we go through the full journey of that in terms of your psychological development?</p>
<p>Who were you before?</p>
<p>Who were you after?</p>
<p>Can you think about that?</p>
<p>Like what was your, if you had to put a brain on the table before and after and try to analyze</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>Well, they both have CTE.</p>
<p>So we know that they&rsquo;re both bruised and gray matter is a little dicey on them.</p>
<p>And it may sound the same and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not, so I&rsquo;ll try to explain it to you.</p>
<p>Before that, don&rsquo;t you laugh because I can, I know it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>I was even louder, even more obnoxious, even more outgoing.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s hard to believe.</p>
<p>This is you humble and quiet right now.</p>
<p>This is normal me now.</p>
<p>This is who I am now.</p>
<p>And I love that.</p>
<p>But who I was before I was, you know, motocross, taekwondo, tomboy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know how to dress.</p>
<p>I thought that if you just wore like the same jeans and t shirt all the time, that was like</p>
<p>acceptable behavior as a woman.</p>
<p>I wore skate shoes.</p>
<p>I went to a Catholic school that I refused to wear skirt at.</p>
<p>I wore pants.</p>
<p>I played hacky sack.</p>
<p>I was so into sports, I cut and split wood with my dad on weekends.</p>
<p>We heated our house that way.</p>
<p>I would go on the transport.</p>
<p>I stayed out of trouble for the most part.</p>
<p>I think I was a fairly good kid.</p>
<p>I was pretty angry though for most of my teenage life after my coach.</p>
<p>I lost my way a little bit there.</p>
<p>I was just crazier.</p>
<p>But happy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I was happy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m realizing that now.</p>
<p>I think I was, I think anger overtook who I was, and I think that&rsquo;s why I was such an</p>
<p>angry individual towards my parents when I was in high school.</p>
<p>So parents, was it a little rough relationship with parents?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, my dad was gone a couple of weeks at a time.</p>
<p>So my mom, stay at home mom, had to handle me and my brother, who were both competitive</p>
<p>athletes at the time, by herself.</p>
<p>And when you come home and you have a daughter that just calls you like a bitch to your face</p>
<p>because she can&rsquo;t, she&rsquo;s being bullied so bad that she can&rsquo;t understand why, but also</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know how to fix it, but has no other outlet anymore to kind of get rid of it.</p>
<p>I was not nice.</p>
<p>I was a really mean person.</p>
<p>I broke my mom.</p>
<p>I remember the day she stopped yelling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the day I know I broke her.</p>
<p>I broke her.</p>
<p>Did you have a source of discipline in your life?</p>
<p>Like, what, like maybe like your dad, somebody who says you&rsquo;re being a bitch.</p>
<p>Oh, like who would call me like that?</p>
<p>Oh no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>My parents were incredible.</p>
<p>And my dad came from like a family of like a bajillion kids who lived in a farm with</p>
<p>no running water with like super, my dad was brash and abrupt.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;ve caught myself doing that once in a while.</p>
<p>So like if I did one thing wrong, if he was just in a mood, I would know it.</p>
<p>So you weren&rsquo;t, okay.</p>
<p>So that anger just took different forms.</p>
<p>It took different forms, but it mostly would be directed at my mom because I know she would</p>
<p>take it and that was who I had.</p>
<p>And I feel bad about it to the day.</p>
<p>Like I still, she listened to the Jocko podcast and so did my dad.</p>
<p>And my mom promised me she would never read my book because there&rsquo;s certain parts.</p>
<p>I just, my dad on my deployment, when I called him and told him some of the stuff, he started</p>
<p>crying.</p>
<p>My dad doesn&rsquo;t cry.</p>
<p>And he just said, please never tell your mother this.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do that to your mom.</p>
<p>My mom, like my grandfather came from Hungary.</p>
<p>He escaped when the Nazis left, when the Soviets came in.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t great as a dad.</p>
<p>My mom went through a lot as a kid and that was because her dad was in the war.</p>
<p>That was because her dad didn&rsquo;t know any better and she knew she couldn&rsquo;t be like that.</p>
<p>So her way would be yelling.</p>
<p>And then I hit about 16 and I wore her down and I broke her, shattered her ability to</p>
<p>think that she could have any sort of relationship with me.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want to have had a relationship with me.</p>
<p>But the funny thing is you&rsquo;ve rediscovered that now.</p>
<p>So she, is she, are you guys close now?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s coming out to help out again.</p>
<p>She comes out to help out with Jack all the time and my dad, they&rsquo;re still, they&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>truck drivers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still on the road.</p>
<p>They team drive.</p>
<p>They have their little dogs and they go and they do their thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had that relationship now it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s still strenuous.</p>
<p>Like I still, when I&rsquo;m having a hard time, she&rsquo;ll be the person I&rsquo;ll take it out on because</p>
<p>I know she can take it.</p>
<p>Even though I know I shouldn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s like, she&rsquo;s my safe space to be like, blah, about</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;ll just be like, well, that&rsquo;s not nice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, you&rsquo;re not, fuck it.</p>
<p>Like I, and I&rsquo;ll take it out on her.</p>
<p>She knows I don&rsquo;t mean it and I try, um, but for whatever reason, she just, she takes it</p>
<p>and um,</p>
<p>And it brings it out of you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you describe sort of the various characteristics, the, the shape of your PTSD, the trauma, how</p>
<p>the anger and hate took shape in you in the, in the seconds, minutes, hours, months, years</p>
<p>after and after the, the full trauma of all the things you&rsquo;ve experienced in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny because Jocko asked me something and it made me, it&rsquo;s made me, I&rsquo;ve really</p>
<p>been thinking a lot about it and he&rsquo;s like, do you think if somebody of the leadership</p>
<p>would have just sat you down and said, Hey, Burns, what you&rsquo;re feeling is okay, what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling is normal, what you&rsquo;re feeling is what happens when you&rsquo;re in something like</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>Do you think you would be where you are?</p>
<p>And I said, well, I thought about it and I&rsquo;m like, you know, I don&rsquo;t think I would</p>
<p>be because I wouldn&rsquo;t have been medicated out of my mind.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to process anything because I was just given medication right from the</p>
<p>get.</p>
<p>And for me, what happened was once that light switch was off, um, I was sent back to Kandahar</p>
<p>to what I, once the operation was over, we, we flew back to Kandahar, like with the Brits.</p>
<p>And then because there was deaths and we lost people on that operation, I had to go to the</p>
<p>British side for the next, I think three or four days and recant word for word why, what</p>
<p>happened to a British MP who hand wrote statements, but we had to do that on repeat to make sure</p>
<p>we all had the same story and so nobody shot anybody in the back.</p>
<p>And so that I don&rsquo;t think is a great way to do that after an after action, after action</p>
<p>reports happen, but I don&rsquo;t think beating a dead horse and having somebody repeat, repeat,</p>
<p>repeat, and then just imprint more and more and more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know that that is a great way of doing that.</p>
<p>Um,</p>
<p>And especially from a perspective of what are they, uh, liability almost like legal,</p>
<p>that kind of that perspective as opposed to the full perspective.</p>
<p>I mean, so, so for people who don&rsquo;t know, uh, one is the, the, the overmedication and</p>
<p>that you had to undergo.</p>
<p>And then the other is the social isolation in terms of, I mean, more than what Jaco,</p>
<p>what you just mentioned, you also kind of, uh, mentioned that just being with, um, with</p>
<p>other soldiers you&rsquo;re close with, just sitting there in silence and, um, just sitting in</p>
<p>that shared understanding, even that in itself communicates like these feelings are normal.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have to talk and you were robbed of that as well, essentially.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I was, because I was borrowed, I think Jaco had a name for us when we get borrowed.</p>
<p>It was like, there was like a, I don&rsquo;t know what they call us, but it&rsquo;s like when you</p>
<p>take a person and you put them in another unit, there&rsquo;s a name for it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what it was.</p>
<p>You never see those people again.</p>
<p>But because I was in Kanderhart, the doctors gave me the medication because I, I think</p>
<p>I was the one who said, I don&rsquo;t, this isn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel right.</p>
<p>This is wrong.</p>
<p>Cause when I got back that night, there was supposed to be somebody there to pick me up,</p>
<p>to take me to the other side of the base and no one showed.</p>
<p>So I, I humped on my kit back to the Canada house and I remember getting in the shower</p>
<p>and the rule was quick fucking showers, no water.</p>
<p>I must&rsquo;ve sat on that floor, that shower for half an hour, 45 minutes.</p>
<p>I just held myself and cried and didn&rsquo;t even know why I was crying.</p>
<p>I just knew I needed to cry and I still this day, I, and when they sent me back to the</p>
<p>FOB, they sent me back with all this medication after spending that time with the Brits and</p>
<p>they put me back on the guns, medicated out of my fucking tree.</p>
<p>I almost shot someone, but they didn&rsquo;t tell my staff that I was on meds.</p>
<p>So when the artillery gun was going off and I didn&rsquo;t run to the gun and I was still asleep</p>
<p>inside the tent with the gun beside my head, they didn&rsquo;t know I was just drugged.</p>
<p>They just thought I was fucking off somewhere, hanging out with some Americans.</p>
<p>They just thought I wasn&rsquo;t doing any of what I should be doing.</p>
<p>And then I remember the moment my Sergeant, we did a night shoot and he, he&rsquo;s so funny</p>
<p>because he called me and goes, ah, fuck, Burns, I remember this, yes, you were standing there</p>
<p>with me and I look at you and go, hey, Burns, are you okay?</p>
<p>Because your eyes are all fucked.</p>
<p>And I, I looked at Sergeant LeBlanc and I just remember going, yeah, I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>Like just huh.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I still remember that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I know.</p>
<p>And he goes, they never tell me anything, fuck, Burns, I did not know the drugs you</p>
<p>were on.</p>
<p>And as I was on all of them, he goes, I know I walk in, you show me the bottles, ah, fuck,</p>
<p>Burns, you shouldn&rsquo;t have been there.</p>
<p>I guarantee he sounds just like that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what, I mean, I suppose this is a lazy way of dealing with trauma and it&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>the military in some sense.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a good program in place, this makes sense, but you should have a good</p>
<p>program in place.</p>
<p>Just like you said, on the prep, on the mental prep side, like just any prep, like training</p>
<p>people, training people on the, I suppose to, I guess train the fact that you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have somebody close to you blow up, like you have to probably visualize that.</p>
<p>You have to think through that.</p>
<p>You have to have a process of how to deal with something like that, with that kind of</p>
<p>trauma.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Tools in the toolbox is what the doctors call it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, and it&rsquo;s not like weakness, it&rsquo;s actually strength.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have to be mentally strong enough to process that.</p>
<p>That probably takes a lot of training, but it&rsquo;s a great training, right?</p>
<p>Well worth it to protect your investment training.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very cold, but correct way to put it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>I thought you would appreciate the coldness of the way I articulated that.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m of two minds in this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I sometimes wonder like what I would be like as a soldier, actually.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, because I love country and I love all the things you&rsquo;re mentioning.</p>
<p>Like I could see myself probably dying for my country and also enjoying the skill of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>The very like OCD, like very proficient.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But then also the human side, I fall in love with people.</p>
<p>I fall in love with everything.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, I suppose you have to shut off the part of your brain when you&rsquo;re executing</p>
<p>a mission that cares about other humans outside your close knit group.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no time for philosophical thinking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I suppose that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s better to be young.</p>
<p>Young and dumb.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not necessarily dumb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like you were over that energy of excitement of proficiency and excellence is</p>
<p>just higher than it is later in life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not dumb.</p>
<p>I was not dumb, but I was naive, uneducated, not well trained and had an arrogance because</p>
<p>we were told we were the fucking shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re amazing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m amazing.</p>
<p>So I wonder, do they think if we do mental training?</p>
<p>That makes you weak.</p>
<p>Do you think the military thinks that makes you weak?</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>And the reason I can say that is because it&rsquo;s obvious in the way that they handle it now.</p>
<p>So like if a soldier says, hey, I&rsquo;m really struggling with that last op we were on, man,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just really, it&rsquo;s getting to me, I&rsquo;m having a hard time sleeping.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to go, okay, well, how, how hard of a time sleeping are you having?</p>
<p>And then you get that re and you go, oh no, I&rsquo;m not, it&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t need anything for it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just like once in a while I&rsquo;m losing some sleep.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, okay.</p>
<p>Because you know that pen moves, it&rsquo;s all getting written down and then you&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>red, you&rsquo;re dead red, which means you&rsquo;re not deploying again.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re not able to do the thing you love the most with the people you love the</p>
<p>most.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, but also this is really difficult and I&rsquo;d love to talk to you about PTSD, but</p>
<p>like.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I keep going off.</p>
<p>No, please.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m hoping to, um, like launch a company, you know, in the engineering space and the,</p>
<p>and I currently lead, I&rsquo;ve led a few people and it&rsquo;s always this kind of, um, like how</p>
<p>much are you supposed to push people because people are, everyone is weak and lazy.</p>
<p>Are you quoting her text messages from earlier?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quoting, all I have is just quotes from you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Uh, tells me how much we&rsquo;ve spoken in the past week, poor soul.</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t know what to do because sometimes people are really struggling, like really</p>
<p>struggling in a way with their being there.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s the Goggins thing is like, where&rsquo;s the line to where you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>breaking the human being versus where you&rsquo;re breaking them at the places where they will</p>
<p>grow back stronger.</p>
<p>Like in that line is tricky, uh, to, to truly understand.</p>
<p>I think the military eras on the side of like, they, you know, like push them beyond all</p>
<p>limits, physical, physical, but mental, they don&rsquo;t, they need to respect the mental more.</p>
<p>Uh, they fuck with the brain a little bit.</p>
<p>I mean, in basic training, they like scream in your face and to see who&rsquo;s going to crack</p>
<p>and they, they put you on sleep deprivation to see who&rsquo;s weak enough that they can&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>sleep depth.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll, they do stuff to you.</p>
<p>Like I know if you&rsquo;re a downed pilot, you have to go and you have to do this training</p>
<p>and like it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ll get captured.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this whole thing and they fuck with your brain, but there&rsquo;s a line.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a line.</p>
<p>My issue is go to the line, cross the line, give them the tools to come back from the</p>
<p>line.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, we, we know there&rsquo;s PTSD.</p>
<p>We know there&rsquo;s a, such a thing.</p>
<p>We understand there&rsquo;s anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>We understand there&rsquo;s major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>We understand that there are precursors.</p>
<p>There are signs and symptoms.</p>
<p>We understand that.</p>
<p>So why are we not building enough of a toolkit, whether that be, I&rsquo;m not talking medication.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking, it sounds woo woo, but fucking trust me, it works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking meditation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking yoga.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about peer group support.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about if you go to your doctor and report this, there&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re not automatically</p>
<p>going to be losing your job.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t we giving the proper tools and the education needed?</p>
<p>These things are not difficult to teach.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t take a lot of time.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t take a lot of money.</p>
<p>The only time it takes a lot of money is when you want to medicate.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to medicate you yet.</p>
<p>You only need to be medicated if you&rsquo;re a danger to someone else or yourself.</p>
<p>And most of the time, because of the way the system is set, you&rsquo;ll lie about it through</p>
<p>your fucking teeth, just so that no one touches you.</p>
<p>So from the perspective of the military, do you think you can still be a bad motherfucker</p>
<p>and do all the mental work?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Some of the baddest dudes I&rsquo;ve ever known are like, I gotta go to yoga.</p>
<p>I gotta go meditate.</p>
<p>I go do ayah with those guys.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they know that that&rsquo;s not okay to be like that in your life.</p>
<p>Can you answer the ridiculously big question of what is PTSD?</p>
<p>Do you understand the basic characteristics of it?</p>
<p>Is there universal characteristics from your own unique experience, from what you&rsquo;ve understood</p>
<p>about it?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course there are.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the basic things that a doctor looks for when they&rsquo;re diagnosing PTSD.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a doctor.</p>
<p>Let me make that fucking clear.</p>
<p>But there are things that you look for.</p>
<p>You look for insomnia.</p>
<p>You look for anger and aggression.</p>
<p>You look for people to fly off the handle.</p>
<p>You look for avoidance.</p>
<p>You can tell in somebody&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>People who can&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t sleep, you know that after a certain amount of time, they&rsquo;re just going</p>
<p>to deteriorate.</p>
<p>You know, sleeplessness, triggers.</p>
<p>When you say avoidance, do you mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Avoidance.</p>
<p>So like, when I first got back to Canada, I avoided everybody that was Middle Eastern</p>
<p>at all costs, no matter how much of a difference it made in my day.</p>
<p>If I had to not go somewhere for one of the greatest events of my life, I wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>went.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t there some aspect that are combined with the triggers?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s wise to avoid triggers even like for your own personal health, well being.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>For me, that was one of my triggers.</p>
<p>So you have triggers.</p>
<p>And then you also deal with things like sounds and smells.</p>
<p>You can tell.</p>
<p>You can tell when someone&rsquo;s triggered.</p>
<p>A lot of vets don&rsquo;t like fireworks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, well remove yourself from the situation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s other things within PTSD that kind of rear its head that with PTSD kind of attach</p>
<p>other things.</p>
<p>So like when I was diagnosed with PTSD, I think it was like four years later, I was</p>
<p>diagnosed with major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>And that was kind of a compilation of things that was just like a shit show there.</p>
<p>What is major depressive disorder?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>Is there an answer?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have one.</p>
<p>I was told I had it.</p>
<p>Okay, so I mean, what does your mind go through?</p>
<p>Where are the places that my mind goes, your mind goes like the dark places when I get</p>
<p>triggered and when it was like really bad?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you thought about suicide every minute of every day.</p>
<p>What are the pros of suicide in your mind at that time?</p>
<p>At that time, the pros were no one has to deal with this anymore, I don&rsquo;t have to feel</p>
<p>this way anymore, I&rsquo;m a burden to my family, I&rsquo;m a burden to the military system, I&rsquo;m weak,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bad soldier, I didn&rsquo;t do my job, I don&rsquo;t deserve to be alive, I don&rsquo;t deserve veterans</p>
<p>affairs support, my parents don&rsquo;t deserve to watch me go through this, the guy I was</p>
<p>dating didn&rsquo;t deserve to put up with the bullshit I put him through, the people who drive with</p>
<p>me in cars didn&rsquo;t deserve to almost hit medians because I swerved because of a piece of garbage,</p>
<p>people didn&rsquo;t deserve my racist outburst, people didn&rsquo;t deserve, people didn&rsquo;t, I did</p>
<p>not deserve to be breathing anymore.</p>
<p>I should have died there and I wished I died there.</p>
<p>So self hate there too.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s at the core of it, that&rsquo;s like this, so how do you escape from that place?</p>
<p>How do you overcome that depression essentially at the core of the desire to kill yourself?</p>
<p>What basic principles, I mean, we could talk about ayahuasca, but basic principles of literally</p>
<p>how do you escape that moment?</p>
<p>Yeah, previous to any of that, I did from 2009, I got out, so I was medically, I was</p>
<p>3B medical honorable discharge in 2011, May 23rd, 2011, so I left the military then.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been 10 years, just over 10 years, oh my God, it&rsquo;s 10 and a half years, I just</p>
<p>realized that right now.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Happy anniversary.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been out for 10 years and I would say the reason I didn&rsquo;t kill myself for the</p>
<p>longest time was the individual I was dating.</p>
<p>That was straight across the board, that was it.</p>
<p>For me, there was no relief for about six years of the thought of just kill yourself,</p>
<p>kill yourself, kill yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier if you just do it.</p>
<p>That voice was so strong for that long, there was really no relief.</p>
<p>What there was though was implementation of different medications, realizing they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>working, trying different things, getting myself to a point where I could leave my house</p>
<p>comfortably ish again, and I wasn&rsquo;t triggered, which then allowed me to travel, which then</p>
<p>allowed me to slowly try to go back to school, which by the way, it was a very bad idea.</p>
<p>That was a bad idea, that was bad.</p>
<p>I went too early, they started practicing active shooter drills in our school.</p>
<p>It was bad, my professors understood.</p>
<p>School was full of triggers, it turns out.</p>
<p>It is when you live in Vancouver.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a theme to this conversation about your love for Canada.</p>
<p>Look at me, I love my fucking country, I am one of the most patriotic people you will</p>
<p>meet in it.</p>
<p>I think Canada is one of the greatest fucking places on the earth.</p>
<p>I think in the past two years or three years, I have seen what I loved so deeply, so proudly</p>
<p>preached about so&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so proud of what I did there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so proud of the country I got to represent, because I was good at my job.</p>
<p>Being great at your job for a country you love, you just don&rsquo;t like some of the politicians</p>
<p>some of the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even the politicians anymore, it&rsquo;s the state of the country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a second class citizen in my own country right now.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t travel to see my parents within my own country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not allowed to step foot in my son&rsquo;s school.</p>
<p>I am not allowed to go to a restaurant with my family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not allowed to leave Canada without, I told you all the stuff I have to do to get</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>To even get home, I have to do the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watched by the RCMP, neighbors rat you out.</p>
<p>So for somebody who fought for their country.</p>
<p>I hate it, it makes me so sad.</p>
<p>To go through this process of what many consider to be power overreach by government in the</p>
<p>face of this particular pandemic.</p>
<p>I always knew I had a hard time, I loved Canada, the day I got spit on when I got home was</p>
<p>not ideal.</p>
<p>But the thing was, I knew long enough that if I just put one foot in front of the other</p>
<p>and kept going to treatment, and kept doing what my doctor told me to do, that I could</p>
<p>pull out of this if I tried.</p>
<p>I was told that I could do anything in my life.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>As long as I tried.</p>
<p>Was trying really hard?</p>
<p>Trying was harder than breathing.</p>
<p>It was exhausting.</p>
<p>It was, I would be awake for like half a day and every minute of that day, I&rsquo;d just stare</p>
<p>at the wall and just want to kill myself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve had people close to me who suffer from depression and it was like, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unclear how to escape, but it&rsquo;s clear that you need to try something.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t want to even try.</p>
<p>Because you have no try in you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching a person who has no energy essentially to like do any of it and it&rsquo;s like so hopeless.</p>
<p>But you have to try and I think some of that has to do with all the different physical</p>
<p>feeds you have to do.</p>
<p>Like when you have nothing left, you still keep going.</p>
<p>That same like weird drive when you&rsquo;re empty, you still keep going.</p>
<p>I wanted to give up.</p>
<p>I tried.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really lucky because it really was the one person that I&rsquo;d wake up to next every</p>
<p>day and he&rsquo;d be like, hey, so that new drug you&rsquo;re on?</p>
<p>Fun fact, if you don&rsquo;t go to sleep right away, you talk and when you talk, you just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking stop and you go off about everything that&rsquo;s horrible and I&rsquo;m like, what are you</p>
<p>talking about?</p>
<p>No, last night.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You took that pill.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>You just, you just, you didn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I have no recollection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d get up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I would cook food like on a stove and it would be, hopefully we don&rsquo;t die because I would</p>
<p>have no recollection because of the drugs.</p>
<p>The idea that when people say, well, just put yourself out of depression, I&rsquo;m a highly</p>
<p>motivated individual.</p>
<p>The idea of lifting my head up to turnover was daunting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like for somebody so as driven as you to completely lose all of that for moments</p>
<p>of time, for stretches of time.</p>
<p>Fuck the mind is a motherfucker.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, for somebody like, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m so, I&rsquo;m so grateful for people like you</p>
<p>to be able to pull out of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been always the opposite.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate to just always find joy, meaning in everything, even the</p>
<p>stupidest shit.</p>
<p>Can I ask you something?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s because of how you were raised, where you came from?</p>
<p>No, no, it was my own person.</p>
<p>I honestly think it&rsquo;s the biology, the, this, cause I had my parents, I&rsquo;m very cognizant</p>
<p>of had nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>They, they never understood this little engine I had.</p>
<p>I just, I always liked just sitting, looking at people and just enjoying how amazing they</p>
<p>are and just like looking at, like it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s straight up just biology, whatever</p>
<p>the neurochemistry is.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just getting like a good drug from, yeah, I&rsquo;m getting hits all the time from stupid</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t, and yeah, so that&rsquo;s why I can be, sometimes I&rsquo;ll talk like very self</p>
<p>critically about myself because that&rsquo;s almost makes me, it makes life more fun and challenges</p>
<p>stuff and it makes you more productive.</p>
<p>But ultimately it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m getting that like good, I&rsquo;m getting the good stuff all</p>
<p>the time.</p>
<p>I wondered about that.</p>
<p>I was thinking about that when I listened to you for the first time on, I think when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on Rogan for the first time, water shouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s not water.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t trust.</p>
<p>See, this is the thing with the Russians.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Dessani.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s owned by Coca Cola.</p>
<p>Well, no, I had it resealed.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t go that far, but now I&rsquo;m really certain to question what&rsquo;s in this,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>If I offered you tea, you should really be worried.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the, no, that&rsquo;s the, like the more famous way that Russians usually assassinate</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>They put poison in the tea.</p>
<p>Cause a lot of Russians drink tea and you know, all right, well, I mean there is a blade</p>
<p>right there.</p>
<p>So I thought was somebody, um, Andrew Huberman gave that to me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know him, but he&rsquo;s a cool, I don&rsquo;t know all the people, you know, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>new.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m new here, Lex.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to send instructions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to let my friends say, he says, uh, he&rsquo;s an ex operator and he&rsquo;ll message</p>
<p>me once in a while and ask me something and I&rsquo;ll answer back.</p>
<p>If I answer in the correct way, he&rsquo;ll go candidate meets expectations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, fuck you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a candidate of anything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s essentially.</p>
<p>Well, Andrew Huberman is kind of a celebrity.</p>
<p>Andrew, you should check her out.</p>
<p>Uh, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re an interesting person.</p>
<p>You guys should connect.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Stanford neuroscientist was a, I think the number one podcast in the world in health.</p>
<p>Uh, he&rsquo;s a, does he have like a, a beard thing going?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m knocking him down to like, does he have a beard?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t look, I don&rsquo;t look at people&rsquo;s visual appearance, man.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Uh, does he have a beard?</p>
<p>I think he has a beard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very handsome gentleman.</p>
<p>I think I know you&rsquo;re talking about, cause I think I was looking at his stuff this morning.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>No, seriously on Instagram.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know him.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very, very humble, very intelligent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Probably you would understand, like I&rsquo;m very kind of poetic and so on.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s probably the most like rigorous, um, reference machine of science.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s a legit scientist.</p>
<p>Like he knows every paper and everything has to do with the mind and neuroscience.</p>
<p>Like performance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s much more, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s much more actually, and the focus is always on, um,</p>
<p>how to help, how that helps people.</p>
<p>So like protocols, like, like here&rsquo;s what you need to do to get better sleep.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, I know who it is.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s like a thousand papers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he just goes like hammers nonstop.</p>
<p>I mean, he, um, he spent a week in Austin, he&rsquo;s coming back and spending, uh, a couple</p>
<p>of weeks in Austin.</p>
<p>We just hang out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you think that was like a teleprompter or something, like the way he does his podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like in person, he&rsquo;s the same, like, all right, this is, this is intense, but I like it.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Uh, why did we bring him up?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Brought up knives.</p>
<p>We were talking about.</p>
<p>He gave it to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>PTSD.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you talk about poison and how you were poisoning me.</p>
<p>And I said, knives.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about Russians.</p>
<p>And then we were kind of talking about the brain and PTSD.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think for, for most people though, the biggest thing when they see somebody who&rsquo;s struggling</p>
<p>with PTSD there, their first, you know, reaction is how do I help them?</p>
<p>Well, often just saying, Hey, I&rsquo;m here when you&rsquo;re ready to talk and you&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>something, whether you want to talk about it right now or not, I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>And then keeping a close eye on behaviors.</p>
<p>When you start to see somebody having, you know, four, five, six beers at night, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ask why.</p>
<p>When you see somebody, you can tell they&rsquo;re not sleeping.</p>
<p>Hey buddy, you sleeping?</p>
<p>I just am not sleeping.</p>
<p>Instead of just going, Oh, that sucks.</p>
<p>Hey, why aren&rsquo;t you sleeping?</p>
<p>You having nightmares?</p>
<p>Are you, you just have an insomnia?</p>
<p>Are you just eating sugar before bed?</p>
<p>Like care enough about your people to just ask one followup question.</p>
<p>Cause often that&rsquo;s really all it takes.</p>
<p>Cause then somebody goes, somebody cares enough to ask and then they&rsquo;ll just, yeah.</p>
<p>Just showing that you care.</p>
<p>Honestly, grocery store lineup.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, Oh, I like your dress.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll go, how&rsquo;s your day going?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, actually it&rsquo;s going all right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as great as I thought it would be today, but I&rsquo;m doing okay.</p>
<p>But like they&rsquo;ll give you a, instead of good you, instead of just giving you this fake,</p>
<p>false reaction.</p>
<p>If you just show any effort in somebody that you care at all about someone&rsquo;s wellbeing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be amazed.</p>
<p>Amazed.</p>
<p>And some of that is just energy.</p>
<p>The reason honestly I moved to Austin is some lady at a Walmart said, honey, you look handsome</p>
<p>in that suit.</p>
<p>But the care that she put in that, she just looked at me and it wasn&rsquo;t like hitting at</p>
<p>me or something.</p>
<p>She was like, the love.</p>
<p>Just love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I was like, Oh, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m moving here.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>There was a, that&rsquo;s so funny you said that.</p>
<p>Cause I told my, I told my husband this happened and it was, it threw me off.</p>
<p>There was an older lady at a store and this was right after we, we got a brief period</p>
<p>of no masks in Canada.</p>
<p>Just like a brief.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like five minutes.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>It was not even that.</p>
<p>And I, I had come from like an interview or something.</p>
<p>So I had actually had makeup on that day and I had my hat and I was, you know, just at</p>
<p>the grocery store.</p>
<p>She walked up to me and she got real close and I didn&rsquo;t know what was happening.</p>
<p>And then she got closer and then she just grabbed my arm like this.</p>
<p>She goes, I love that hat on you.</p>
<p>And I looked at her and I was like, she touched me during a pandemic and she&rsquo;s old.</p>
<p>Oh my God, I love you too.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I said, you&rsquo;re so amazing.</p>
<p>And I just, and I just sparked a conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t take much.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That little moment of genuine care.</p>
<p>Maybe you can tell me actually the, um, the journey you took with ayahuasca, like what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s such a fascinating journey.</p>
<p>So like, uh, letting your mind go to different places in order to rediscover itself, like,</p>
<p>like, what is it like a rocket ship to somewhere else so you can land in a better place?</p>
<p>Here, how about I show you something that&rsquo;ll help your brain.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is not for you to lift up either and show on the camera because there&rsquo;s leaves</p>
<p>in it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s leaves in some pages.</p>
<p>So just don&rsquo;t dump it out cause it&rsquo;ll go all fucking everywhere.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Instructions.</p>
<p>I like this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you feel like you need them.</p>
<p>Um, ayahuasca is a beautiful psychedelic that we have been so blessed to have on this earth</p>
<p>that we have so underutilized and could be, I don&rsquo;t want to say saving humanity, but just</p>
<p>you ever hear that saying, if you could just give everyone mushrooms one time, the world</p>
<p>would be a better place.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So psilocybin is I use for microdosing, uh, for depression.</p>
<p>I did ayahuasca in January of this year.</p>
<p>Um, and I&rsquo;ve at that point, that was the last time I was on a pharmaceutical drug.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been off everything ever since 10 different ones.</p>
<p>So if you backtrack a little bit, just to, so you&rsquo;ll understand my doctor gave me the</p>
<p>opportunity, Dr. Greg Passi.</p>
<p>He is a veteran himself, served in Bosnia and Rwanda.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a medic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Colonel.</p>
<p>I think Colonel Lieutenant, he&rsquo;s going to fucking punch me right in the face for that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s high up officer.</p>
<p>Um, he is one of my saviors.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like my old, I call him my old man.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s my favorite and, um, rides a Harley, like that kind of guy.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, um, he said, you know, Kels, this is, I just don&rsquo;t, I was hitting a wall.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t getting any better.</p>
<p>And he goes, what, how do you feel about cannabis?</p>
<p>And I was like, I don&rsquo;t feel good about it because family histories or my parents always</p>
<p>told me if I smoked weed, you know, it&rsquo;s just this, this perception because I just want</p>
<p>you to try it.</p>
<p>Just would it, would you be willing to try it?</p>
<p>So I was like, okay, so I was willing to try it.</p>
<p>Then I started going to these groups called Women Grow and, um, learning about it.</p>
<p>And then I realized, oh, I&rsquo;m starting to sleep a little bit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel groggy in the morning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like a bag of shit.</p>
<p>And I also want to have a baby one day and I can&rsquo;t have all this stuff in my system.</p>
<p>So I started using cannabis and then I started using it as a main medication and I&rsquo;d been</p>
<p>using it now since 2014, got married, 2015, 2015, 2015 I started using it.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve been using it ever since.</p>
<p>And that was the way I got off of all the pharmaceutical drugs was keeping cannabis</p>
<p>the constant, finding the right strains for me, and then slowly with the doctor&rsquo;s advice</p>
<p>and under supervision going off of those medications.</p>
<p>Back to January of 2021, I had hit a really bad spell last year.</p>
<p>Um, and the year before it was a really big struggle.</p>
<p>Uh, I almost lost my company last year due to COVID just like many, many millions of</p>
<p>people did.</p>
<p>Um, and instead of me just laying down and taking it, I pivoted really quickly and called</p>
<p>the factory and said, do you guys make masks?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, yeah, we&rsquo;re making masks.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m going to call the Canadian government.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get my medical license and I&rsquo;m going to try to sell the masks and see if</p>
<p>we can do that.</p>
<p>And so we did that.</p>
<p>And so we did 200,000 masks for Ontario hospitals, um, which ironically went to my entire community</p>
<p>I was born and raised in.</p>
<p>So it was really weird.</p>
<p>And that kept us afloat long enough.</p>
<p>Um, we lost 200 retail locations that I all single handedly spent five years going like</p>
<p>door to door getting myself.</p>
<p>Um,</p>
<p>and we should say this is brass and unity, jewelry,</p>
<p>the jewelry and sunglass company.</p>
<p>And um, I started,</p>
<p>speaking of which,</p>
<p>looks like a cereal.</p>
<p>I mean, you do look good in them.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t lie to you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll call them the Lex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s those are now called the Lex.</p>
<p>Fuck the gunner.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the Lex.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>The Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m jumping around here, but just bear with me.</p>
<p>I, I started, my doctor suggested art therapy.</p>
<p>Dr. Patsy did.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really how the company started.</p>
<p>I bought beads and a pipe cutter and a hammer and a drill and I fucked up our kitchen table</p>
<p>and I taught myself how to put jewelry cause my husband was like, you can do it.</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>So I was like, okay, he says I can believes in me, so I guess I can do it.</p>
<p>No idea what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>And then got to this point, um, you know, where COVID hit and people lost companies</p>
<p>and we pivoted and we did what we could.</p>
<p>And then I really started to go downhill psychologically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found purpose again with this company.</p>
<p>I found a way to help again.</p>
<p>I found myself again.</p>
<p>And then that was in danger of being gone again.</p>
<p>So the company is 2015.</p>
<p>We started, I started building jewelry in 2015 under like a just, it was called her</p>
<p>wearables and it was really small and it was just, I was just trying to make stuff.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be a company.</p>
<p>And you were on a ton of medication throughout this whole process.</p>
<p>And my mom being the tenacious truck driver she is, she was driving for Kevin Hart&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>now tour.</p>
<p>And so she got, she just harassed them was like, you need to meet my daughter.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I saw the picture of you and Kevin Hart, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>But he just gave me a good piece of advice.</p>
<p>Hey, if you&rsquo;re going to make this something, you can&rsquo;t really, if you want it to be for</p>
<p>everyone, you can&rsquo;t call it her wearables.</p>
<p>I was like, cool.</p>
<p>And then we drove home that night and then he tweeted it out to people to 24 million</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>And he was like, who is now?</p>
<p>And that was a giant deal.</p>
<p>And then my husband kind of looked at me and being, he&rsquo;s so fucking brilliant.</p>
<p>He looked at me and goes, all right, yeah, we got to come up with a rename.</p>
<p>Let me start thinking.</p>
<p>Let me start brainstorming.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s make, you want to make this real?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make this real.</p>
<p>And so we did.</p>
<p>And he was like, what do you think about like, we were doing like brass collective co, brass</p>
<p>this, but I just knew I wanted brass in the name.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s like, what about brass and unity?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to like unify people.</p>
<p>Like why wouldn&rsquo;t you do that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, fucking million horses came up with it.</p>
<p>Like everything else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great name.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s a brilliant person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s annoying.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the idea of losing this thing that we had just built and just got me kind of functioning</p>
<p>with was devastating.</p>
<p>So I got this opportunity given to me by Griff, Combat Flip Flops.</p>
<p>Um, again, Brady, my husband was like, Hey, you should get sponsors for your podcast.</p>
<p>Hey, have you heard of this company, Combat Flip Flops?</p>
<p>Remember we watched them on Shark Tank.</p>
<p>And then I reached out, he emailed me back.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, we go to together like peanut butter and jelly are companies.</p>
<p>That sounds great.</p>
<p>And then I was like, Hey, also, like, do you think one of your owners would want to come</p>
<p>on the podcast?</p>
<p>Just like tossing it out there kind of like I did with you.</p>
<p>And he was like, yeah, I&rsquo;d love to come on.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh my God.</p>
<p>And he came on the podcast and it went great.</p>
<p>And then at the end of it, we stopped recording and he just kind of did this thing.</p>
<p>He does this.</p>
<p>Just like leans in real close, looks into your soul and goes, how you doing?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, great.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, how you really doing?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m horrible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done everything.</p>
<p>And just this whole, just like waterworks happen and he goes, listen, have you ever</p>
<p>heard of Ayahuasca?</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah, like in movies and like psychedelics in the seventies, you know, and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s like have a talk.</p>
<p>And he goes, I&rsquo;ve got an opportunity for a spot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going with this charity called Heroic Hearts.</p>
<p>They have spaces in UK, Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re owned by an army ranger named Jesse Gould.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re really trying to help vets.</p>
<p>And this has worked.</p>
<p>Would you want to come?</p>
<p>And before he even said, like, would you, before I even got like an invite, I was like,</p>
<p>can I come?</p>
<p>When can I, when, when, when do we, when do we go?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s in like three weeks.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be on any SSRIs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on any, you&rsquo;re going to have to wean off.</p>
<p>And at the time I was on my last one.</p>
<p>And so I was like, I called my doctor and I was like, listen.</p>
<p>And he was like, what?</p>
<p>And I was like, guess what I&rsquo;m about to do?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m like going to go do ayahuasca.</p>
<p>And he goes, you&rsquo;re going to, he does this thing where he just goes, all right.</p>
<p>Because he knows he&rsquo;s not going to win.</p>
<p>He knows I&rsquo;ll just fight him on it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just called that, like the, the Jocko reset because he does a.</p>
<p>Pretty much.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And he goes, I said, but here&rsquo;s the kicker.</p>
<p>I have to go off of this medication.</p>
<p>And he goes, well, you know, we&rsquo;re supposed to do that in the summer months when the depression&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not like bringing, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Listen, I hear you, but I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>Whether you want me to or not.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m letting you know, Hey, this is going to happen.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, okay, just try to do it properly.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I know the drill.</p>
<p>I know the drill, whatever, whatever.</p>
<p>I went to school to be a paramedic.</p>
<p>I know the drill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go off of it properly.</p>
<p>So I can like drop that within a week that stuff was, I was done taking it.</p>
<p>And I was going through like the world&rsquo;s worst just withdrawals.</p>
<p>It was like you were at a rock concert and your head was banging up and down, but you</p>
<p>were sitting perfectly still.</p>
<p>It was horrible.</p>
<p>But you had like a thing to look forward to with the sidewall.</p>
<p>I had a light at the end of the tunnel and I knew if I got to the light was the worst</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Just get to the light.</p>
<p>But at that point, like I, again, I had a son, I had a husband, I had a great company,</p>
<p>I have a great house, I have a nice car, I have everything.</p>
<p>Why did I want to die every minute of the day?</p>
<p>I was at that point again.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, this has got it, something&rsquo;s got to give.</p>
<p>And so I went and I got there and she is the most intense, beautiful, divine deity or entity</p>
<p>or visualization, whatever you want to deem ayahuasca as, mama ayahuasca is real.</p>
<p>And she takes no prisoners.</p>
<p>She shows you exactly what you need to see to help yourself, but she does not discriminate</p>
<p>against whether you&rsquo;re ready or not.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ingested it, she&rsquo;s coming for you.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to be either gentle or she&rsquo;s going to beat your ass.</p>
<p>And sometimes that&rsquo;s what you need, but she does it in a way that is profound.</p>
<p>So what were some memorable, profound moments for you?</p>
<p>What what are the places it took you, these people had you meet?</p>
<p>For the first time, I got to be in a group of people who didn&rsquo;t judge me or question</p>
<p>my service.</p>
<p>They just respect me.</p>
<p>That was number one.</p>
<p>So that group I lost, I just found again.</p>
<p>Big shocker, I was the only woman there again.</p>
<p>Seems to be the thing for me.</p>
<p>And so I was surrounded by all these special operators.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t like normal soldiers.</p>
<p>These guys that I&rsquo;m with are like, Bronze Star, fucking Purple Heart, just the coolest</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>People I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be like, that&rsquo;s my buddy.</p>
<p>Now I can be like, those are my buddies, like those motherfuckers will go to bat for me.</p>
<p>They will bend over backwards.</p>
<p>They will exfil me out of anywhere.</p>
<p>They will take a bullet for me.</p>
<p>And these guys welcomed me in in a way I didn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>So that hit me weird right off the get.</p>
<p>I was nervous.</p>
<p>And now I was just felt that home for a minute.</p>
<p>And then when I stepped into ceremony, the first night because you do you do three nights</p>
<p>over like over like Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the first night, I was so nervous and so anxious</p>
<p>because you go up in ceremony and you&rsquo;re the shamans come in and they cleanse themselves</p>
<p>and then you get served the ayah individually, you go up, they give it to you, you can take</p>
<p>your time and pray, you can do whatever you want, then you drink it.</p>
<p>I was so just like, I got back to my mat and I sat there and I was like trying to keep</p>
<p>it in.</p>
<p>But I could feel that like heat come from my toes all the way up and you&rsquo;re like your</p>
<p>mouth starts to water.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna throw up, I&rsquo;m gonna throw up, I&rsquo;m gonna throw up.</p>
<p>And I looked over to Griff and I looked at Bishop and I was like, okay, and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>talk or anything.</p>
<p>So I like my buddy, we call him the Viking, a soul Viking.</p>
<p>He looks like a Viking, his head&rsquo;s tattooed, he&rsquo;s been on the show.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sitting directly across like you and I and he can see me, he&rsquo;s looking at me and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m throwing up and I do it about three times and then the last time he just saw me and</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t do it, I threw it up.</p>
<p>And so I like to think that was her way of easing me in so I didn&rsquo;t get like a full punch</p>
<p>to the face.</p>
<p>But I gotta, let me take your hand and show you what I&rsquo;m gonna show you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna make you better, we&rsquo;re gonna take the pain away.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to eventually throw up no matter what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not supposed to, some people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You purge.</p>
<p>Yeah, if something&rsquo;s happening, you&rsquo;re going through something, yeah, you purge.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to happen.</p>
<p>But this, I mean, within like the first 20 minutes, no.</p>
<p>It just takes like, you gotta sit and meditate for, or sit still basically and meditate</p>
<p>in the pitch black for about 45 minutes before the effects even, before you even feel her.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very.</p>
<p>So here she figured out the right dose you need, maybe.</p>
<p>Well because I did the same dose as everyone else.</p>
<p>I think it was 20 mils, which doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot, but when you&rsquo;ve never done hiatus.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>So I felt like such a bitch.</p>
<p>God, I felt like such a bitch.</p>
<p>Okay, that was the thought going through your mind.</p>
<p>Oh, you just fucked it all up.</p>
<p>You ruined it.</p>
<p>You ruined this again.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t do this right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so at that point, we went through the meditation part and the shamans were, they</p>
<p>literally sing for like six hours straight.</p>
<p>So you sit there, you take it and then there&rsquo;s just what you&rsquo;re quietly listening to them.</p>
<p>Meditate and you wait and you wait and you&rsquo;re in pitch black, like can&rsquo;t see this far in</p>
<p>front of your face.</p>
<p>And you have a little puke bucket and then you have a little light that has a red filter</p>
<p>on it.</p>
<p>You have to get up to go to the bathroom to get out of the yurt and you use that so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t turn lights on.</p>
<p>And me, I brought like what?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just a cool visual of just a puke bucket and a little light for the, like I</p>
<p>can imagine these like little lights going every once in a while and then the rest is</p>
<p>just in darkness meditating with this singing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>I would love to do that sometime.</p>
<p>Because trust me, you would, I wouldn&rsquo;t offer if it wasn&rsquo;t the group I would trust.</p>
<p>Yeah that&rsquo;s in, you had a very interesting group.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the Heroic Hearts people.</p>
<p>Yeah, Heroic Hearts.</p>
<p>So they, yeah, this is my, Jesse gave us all these journals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re going to want these.</p>
<p>So he gave us all these journals and now this is like my Bible, like my work, my everything</p>
<p>goes in this with me everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this like silent reminder for me.</p>
<p>And so Heroic Hearts does fantastic work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get into them after.</p>
<p>The thing with this group is there&rsquo;s such care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like go do AYA and like you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like integration coaches and there&rsquo;s like doctors and there&rsquo;s like people to make</p>
<p>sure that you&rsquo;re doing the work because AYA is just the, is just the gate.</p>
<p>Now you have to take it and you have to implement it into your life.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t do that though.</p>
<p>Did you do like integration?</p>
<p>Did you do conversations with somebody?</p>
<p>Did you talk to, like, is there a process to, because similar with psilocybin you mentioned,</p>
<p>as I understand, it&rsquo;s exceptionally beneficial for when you also do like talk therapy.</p>
<p>Like you couple that with the integration in some form where you talk through your experience</p>
<p>and you talk through different things.</p>
<p>Like that seems to be a really, you know, I need to do that more with basically every</p>
<p>substance I take.</p>
<p>Like if I get, which I have been every once in a while known to do, a bit of vodka or</p>
<p>whiskey or whatever, like do integration the next day.</p>
<p>What did you learn?</p>
<p>What did you get from that?</p>
<p>What did you get?</p>
<p>Because you learn a lot, but you sometimes kind of just move on and you celebrate that</p>
<p>that happened, but like really kind of think through it.</p>
<p>Write it down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important because that&rsquo;s what this was.</p>
<p>So the first night, I&rsquo;ll give like a very, because trust me, we could spend a whole podcast</p>
<p>on both of the, all three of those nights, but the first night, the biggest thing that</p>
<p>happened for me is I got to see my daughter, which was my first baby.</p>
<p>And so people say, well, you know, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Fuck you.</p>
<p>That was my daughter.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very aware it was, I&rsquo;m very conscious that it was.</p>
<p>And at that point, she just eased me in enough to let me know and showed me enough that this</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t the end all be all.</p>
<p>Where you are right now on this plane, on this dimension, in this life, this is, this</p>
<p>is a blip and it is, it is so minuscule to the big picture.</p>
<p>And so she really did that by, she showed me just a black and then like a crack.</p>
<p>And then these vibrant colors that I can&rsquo;t describe because there aren&rsquo;t words, Alex</p>
<p>Gray does really great art.</p>
<p>And that is like been the closest thing I&rsquo;ve been able to find colors.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a famous guy who does ayahuasca and he&rsquo;s an artist.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s got stuff in New York as well.</p>
<p>But she just, she eased me in and gave me some relief and showed me enough that I could</p>
<p>go, I could wake up the next day and not want to die the next day.</p>
<p>And so what Heroic Heart said, because they gave us all these journals, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you know, the next day you kind of wake up and you, you do a meet, like a meeting.</p>
<p>You do like a circle.</p>
<p>You just sit in a room and talk about what just happened the night before.</p>
<p>People are crying and people are quiet and you just listen and that&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>And then you write on your free time.</p>
<p>So after that, it&rsquo;s like up to you what you want to do.</p>
<p>Do you want to just go walk in the woods?</p>
<p>Well, I chose to go find a fence post and lie on it for an hour.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>
<p>I lied there and stared up at these two eagles that were just in like the, I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>where we were after and you&rsquo;ll be like, oh, okay, I get it.</p>
<p>And then I found a forest and I just walked up with my book and I just lied there for</p>
<p>hours.</p>
<p>And then she all of a sudden started giving me what you call your downloads.</p>
<p>So the stuff you learn, the stuff that you were all of a sudden you&rsquo;re remembering and</p>
<p>these messages that come through.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what this is.</p>
<p>What kind of things are we talking about?</p>
<p>So my biggest thing that she tried to reiterate to me at the beginning of that first night</p>
<p>was that I don&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking breathe at all.</p>
<p>I just, one thing to the next thing, the next thing, the next thing, the next thing just</p>
<p>to survive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take a minute and breathe.</p>
<p>And so she made, when I say she and I say it because it&rsquo;s hard for people to understand,</p>
<p>but I showed this to my husband, I showed it to my doctors and they&rsquo;re like, bitch, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t write like that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t talk like that.</p>
<p>So like you can flip through it, but it was like, I&rsquo;ll just give, I&rsquo;ll just let Lex read</p>
<p>for a second and just, I&rsquo;ll just do here.</p>
<p>Let me do, I&rsquo;ll do an ad for heroic hearts.</p>
<p>Heroic hearts.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;ll get my papers while you read.</p>
<p>Connect to her, listen to her, open to her.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I read some of these?</p>
<p>You can read some of it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Go right ahead.</p>
<p>The dark has lifted.</p>
<p>Judge my spelling and I&rsquo;ll punch you right in the face.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s very sporadic, sporadically written.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to be still.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to be quiet.</p>
<p>This is good.</p>
<p>Like what, and these are over a stretch of, that was the first, the first couple of pages</p>
<p>were from the first night.</p>
<p>This was just that weekend.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just there laying looking at the Eagles.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With a pen, just frantic as well, Lex, not like writing where you&rsquo;re like, Oh, I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>writing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I had to get it down or I was going to lose it.</p>
<p>You are warrior.</p>
<p>You are power.</p>
<p>You can choose now, breathe now, be now, be present, be warrior, be strength, breathe,</p>
<p>be the strength.</p>
<p>You are the strength.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some soul searching going on here.</p>
<p>This is incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We wait till you get through.</p>
<p>You get in there.</p>
<p>She gets deep, real aggressive, like.</p>
<p>Crack the door for I am the light, the giver, the taker.</p>
<p>I am warrior.</p>
<p>I am life.</p>
<p>I am air.</p>
<p>I am water.</p>
<p>I am fire.</p>
<p>I am light.</p>
<p>This will, this can.</p>
<p>For I am warrior.</p>
<p>For I am light.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a leaf here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story with the leaf?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I was walking and every single time over the, over those three days, anytime I like went</p>
<p>for a walk by myself, I would just hear like, take this, like just almost like as if a voice</p>
<p>was standing there and be like, you need this, take it, take it with you and keep it in your</p>
<p>book.</p>
<p>Ground you.</p>
<p>And it just goes off.</p>
<p>So this is from there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool to have sort of, it&rsquo;s almost like time travel.</p>
<p>I have poppies from France too when I did a, I did a 75th anniversary D Day ride in France</p>
<p>where we rode 600 kilometers on our road bikes for charity.</p>
<p>And we landed on the beaches of Juneau on the 75th and we got to go by the poppy fields</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like covered in poppies and I have some in a book.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I do that.</p>
<p>I just, I do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool because like, these are your thoughts and those are the physical items as it really</p>
<p>helps transport to that place somehow.</p>
<p>Let the light in, let her in.</p>
<p>And she would show me these visuals.</p>
<p>So my drawings are just like, yeah, there&rsquo;s drawings here and you&rsquo;re seeing this stuff.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t draw either.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so, I wish I could draw because if only I could translate what I could</p>
<p>see visually onto paper.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking to her.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to listen.</p>
<p>Is this Mama Aya?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We call her Mama Aya.</p>
<p>Mama Aya.</p>
<p>So what, who, who are you seeing?</p>
<p>Is this a woman?</p>
<p>So for me at first, it was just eyes floating in the sky.</p>
<p>These unbelievably gorgeous, beautiful eyes that I, and I was like literally looking up</p>
<p>at the top of the yurt and I kept going to myself, is anyone else seeing this?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s eyes in the sky.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s these eyes floating and they just kept looking at me.</p>
<p>And I remember when I kept telling myself like, oh, don&rsquo;t worry about it, there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>She would get angry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m right here.</p>
<p>Pay attention to me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be like, okay, like forceful, like very forceful.</p>
<p>So at first it was just the eyes.</p>
<p>The second night, is I&rsquo;m crazy when I say this, great, that&rsquo;s going to be my clip, easy</p>
<p>on crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I do when I get uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I do weird hand gestures and movements.</p>
<p>Voices, I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You would hate to be in my office because most of the day it&rsquo;s just this weird lunges</p>
<p>and uncomfortable moments.</p>
<p>She turned me into a wolf.</p>
<p>I know I said it out loud.</p>
<p>I said, I hear it, I said it, head to toe.</p>
<p>And her takeaway for me was, I&rsquo;m trying to be this pack leader, I&rsquo;m trying to be this</p>
<p>leader in my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to do these things, but I&rsquo;m going about them the whole wrong way.</p>
<p>So like when the shamans call you up to do their special prayer over you, you go up,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t touch them.</p>
<p>They flash their little light.</p>
<p>You see the little light spot, you walk to the light, you sit down on the light.</p>
<p>And then my shaman, he&rsquo;s so funny because he&rsquo;s got this great tone in his voice.</p>
<p>He goes, how are you doing Kelsey?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, so hi, yeah, I have a problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a wolf and I need it to stop.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d be like, don&rsquo;t you worry girl, I got you, you ready?</p>
<p>And I was like, uh huh, uh huh.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sitting there cross legged, I&rsquo;ve got my palms out like this.</p>
<p>And I had a really traumatic shoulder injury.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t just sit slanted like this.</p>
<p>My shoulders actually permanently detached and no one in the world will touch it or fix</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>My collarbone comes out my back here and I don&rsquo;t have any collarbone here.</p>
<p>So nobody will fix it.</p>
<p>No one will touch it.</p>
<p>Even I&rsquo;ve had specialists, I&rsquo;ve had surgeries, no one will do anything with it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m permanently down and forward.</p>
<p>So I slouch, it&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>So before I.</p>
<p>Functionally too.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do a pull up anymore.</p>
<p>Oh, so weak.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Oh, you should, I&rsquo;ll show you how to do a pushup after you&rsquo;ll fucking throw up in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>So before I though, chronic pain, like had to drink a bottle of CBD every day just to</p>
<p>the pain is so bad because the trauma and it was so bad, the surgery went wrong.</p>
<p>The collarbone dissipated and no longer exists.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s just, and they&rsquo;re not sure how I lift things with it and do stuff with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like overcompensation everywhere.</p>
<p>Like my, the, my back, like, um, my trap, my scapula, like flares outward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m all messed up from it.</p>
<p>And so I was in chronic pain.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s praying over me and all of a sudden all I feel is this arm just start just fucking</p>
<p>vibrating and my hair&rsquo;s really long and I feel somebody grabbed the back of my ponytail</p>
<p>and snap my head back like this.</p>
<p>And it felt like something was coming out of my throat, like being pulled out of me</p>
<p>in the takeaway that I ended up in the whole, the rest of the night, there was a million</p>
<p>other things.</p>
<p>And the takeaway was you no longer need to bite.</p>
<p>You may only show your teeth.</p>
<p>You can be the leader that you want to be.</p>
<p>You do not always have to be the traditional type of leader.</p>
<p>You can be in the back of the pack.</p>
<p>You have to watch the rest around you be, be mindful of those around you instead of</p>
<p>just being upfront, be, be behind as well.</p>
<p>Make sure that every thing that you&rsquo;re doing is all being looked after.</p>
<p>Because my thing was I will rip your fucking head off if you just say the wrong thing to</p>
<p>me before.</p>
<p>The whole thing was you can just show your teeth and that is more than enough.</p>
<p>Stop trying to be, stop trying to overcompensate.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do that any longer.</p>
<p>And then I had this weird astral projection thing happen like where I was in my house</p>
<p>and there were these flyers all over my husband and my son and like I went ham on them.</p>
<p>I like shredded them to pieces.</p>
<p>Like I was this protector.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s crazy because the guys told me after like someone would be like, there were flyers</p>
<p>all over you the whole night.</p>
<p>They were just all over you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I was snarling when I was sitting there.</p>
<p>Like the shaman had to be like, I need you to try to calm your breathing after I could.</p>
<p>But before like I was like attacking things beside me that people could see and I could</p>
<p>see but couldn&rsquo;t wrap my brain around that they were real.</p>
<p>Like it was weird.</p>
<p>This is a crazy man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s day two.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s the big takeaway there?</p>
<p>My takeaway was I needed to be, I needed to stop trying to, stop trying to push everything</p>
<p>too hard.</p>
<p>Stop trying to force everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all going to come.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all going to happen.</p>
<p>But you are, you are too aggressive.</p>
<p>You are too, you&rsquo;re trying so hard that you&rsquo;re missing, you&rsquo;re missing everything else.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how to be a better human kind of thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This is getting intense.</p>
<p>Yeah, it gets aggressive.</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s love and light still.</p>
<p>It gets better.</p>
<p>Love and light.</p>
<p>Love and light the warrior within is calm.</p>
<p>She will test you daily.</p>
<p>Show her respect.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve read my book.</p>
<p>You know I don&rsquo;t write like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is strange.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>You get it.</p>
<p>Because people don&rsquo;t understand when I say I didn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t feel like I wrote that.</p>
<p>I feel like she gave me, like I reread this all of the time.</p>
<p>So I wonder, I mean, well not obviously, but this is somehow part of you.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a part of me obviously.</p>
<p>Reconnecting you somehow to that part.</p>
<p>It kind of is incredible to think of what are the things that are part of us that we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really explored, you know.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many.</p>
<p>We just get to talk.</p>
<p>Nature.</p>
<p>To connect to her.</p>
<p>Feel her flow through them.</p>
<p>Use them for the strength for each day a new challenge will present itself.</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>Light.</p>
<p>Breathe.</p>
<p>Sorry I have too much hair.</p>
<p>Never enough.</p>
<p>I used to have long hair.</p>
<p>What about day three?</p>
<p>So day three is the, the stuff I talked about on Jocko.</p>
<p>When I got taken over to the other side.</p>
<p>I almost missed that night too.</p>
<p>I almost missed that ceremony.</p>
<p>I got a false positive on my COVID test and I got a call from the medical clinic that</p>
<p>night being like, you need to come in.</p>
<p>You got a false positive on your COVID test.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to travel, you have to, we got to figure this out.</p>
<p>You got to come do blood work.</p>
<p>You got to come do, you know, whatever it is you need to do if you want to get home,</p>
<p>but you got to come do something.</p>
<p>And so I didn&rsquo;t think I was going to be in ceremony.</p>
<p>I had to leave.</p>
<p>So I left and you know, they waited, they waited for me.</p>
<p>And so I think the biggest takeaway from all of this for me was this isn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t everything.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the end all be all.</p>
<p>You can fight through this.</p>
<p>This is possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be fucking hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth it though.</p>
<p>And if you just keep going in the right direction, everything that I wrote down, everything,</p>
<p>every goal, it&rsquo;ll happen.</p>
<p>What about love?</p>
<p>Tell me about your husband.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>What role did he play in your life?</p>
<p>The most pivotal role.</p>
<p>He kept me alive and made me feel worthy enough to, until I knew that I was worthy enough</p>
<p>to be alive.</p>
<p>Can you dissect that a little bit?</p>
<p>Like what, I mean, what role does love play in the human condition?</p>
<p>I think love is the only reason that we haven&rsquo;t destroyed ourselves.</p>
<p>I mean, we humans in general.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think there is a subset of people where love will always be, you know, love conquers</p>
<p>all, you know, but that&rsquo;s not always the reality.</p>
<p>The reality is life is messy and humans are messy and the way we choose to deal with things</p>
<p>are messy and complicated and difficult, but at the root of all good is love, I think.</p>
<p>And for me, I was fortunate enough to meet my husband through a friend, which you listened</p>
<p>to that podcast.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know that we need to, unless you really want to go into that story again, how</p>
<p>I met my husband.</p>
<p>Well, the only part of that story I like, people should just go listen to the Jackal</p>
<p>podcast is how you made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I, well, okay.</p>
<p>So how it works, let me explain.</p>
<p>In the supercross and motocross industry, it&rsquo;s really small.</p>
<p>The people who are professional, there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a small subset of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like formula one, 21 cars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what there is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the amount of riders.</p>
<p>And we should say your husband is a motocross guy.</p>
<p>My husband was a professional supercross and motocross racer for his whole life.</p>
<p>And he raced for Kawasaki and Suzuki.</p>
<p>He lived in California and raced all down there.</p>
<p>And when I met him, I met him at the tail end of his career.</p>
<p>And so I went to Montreal with a friend of mine to see somebody that I was currently</p>
<p>sleeping with, who was a friend of mine and end up meeting Brady instead.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the funny moment in Jackal&rsquo;s podcast was saying that I was fucking him instead</p>
<p>of just sleeping with him.</p>
<p>And then Jackal&rsquo;s face exploded and Jackal was like, oh, sleeping.</p>
<p>So like he was, he was trying to get details of the sleeping quarters that you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>trying to get you to define as a good interviewer would, oh, sleeping, okay.</p>
<p>And then you were like, it&rsquo;s fucking Jackal or something like that.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s true because in that industry, it&rsquo;s like, we, it&rsquo;s small.</p>
<p>We all share, trust me, is what it is.</p>
<p>And it was, so I met him there and he had broken his wrist really, really bad.</p>
<p>And I was, this was before I deployed.</p>
<p>So I met him and I, we stayed in touch and just became friends and just texted.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>Nothing weird.</p>
<p>And I was deploying though.</p>
<p>So we just agreed, you know, we&rsquo;d be friends.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t actually talking about anything romantically at all.</p>
<p>And then I deployed and we got talking and to know each other a little more, a little</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>And then we decided that we liked each other and we wanted to try to give it at least a</p>
<p>semi shot.</p>
<p>And so when I got home from Afghanistan, I went and watched him race his last, one of</p>
<p>his last two races that he did professionally before he retired, excuse me.</p>
<p>And it was in Montreal and one was in Vegas and I hadn&rsquo;t seen him and he didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>know me.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really know each other.</p>
<p>We met, I slept in the bed beside him because my girlfriend didn&rsquo;t want to get in trouble</p>
<p>from her boyfriend from sleeping beside a random dude.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, we just, we started dating and he really slowly became my rock and he</p>
<p>understands trauma.</p>
<p>He had some stuff happen in his life and his family that he went through a lot of therapy.</p>
<p>He went through a lot of shit.</p>
<p>He went, he saw what traumatic situations can do to a family and to people and those</p>
<p>that are suffering with it.</p>
<p>And so he was well equipped to handle me, thankfully.</p>
<p>And it got to a point where we were doing the long distance back and forth, back and</p>
<p>forth and back and forth.</p>
<p>And I finally got the call that I was going to be released from the military and I wanted</p>
<p>to live near him, but I couldn&rsquo;t afford to live in British Columbia because I was from</p>
<p>Ontario and BC is like, it means bring cash for a reason.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, there&rsquo;s no way I can live there.</p>
<p>And then his family was like, come live with us.</p>
<p>They had a big enough house.</p>
<p>Trust me, it was fine.</p>
<p>So I was like, okay.</p>
<p>And so I went from dating this guy long distance to over from 2009 to 2011, just back and forth,</p>
<p>back and forth, back and forth.</p>
<p>And then finally his parents were like, should her get off the pot here with her?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious she loves you and I would never say it.</p>
<p>That word just as a love.</p>
<p>Like it was just, I couldn&rsquo;t say for a long time, for a long time because I was dead inside.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what that meant because I couldn&rsquo;t feel, I didn&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>
<p>He loved it because he like, we go, we go do something.</p>
<p>You would never complain about anything.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t say a fucking word.</p>
<p>You would just sit there.</p>
<p>And now you got all your feelings back and your emotions back and now you&rsquo;re too hot</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re too cold.</p>
<p>And anyways, so yeah, he loved it.</p>
<p>I was numb and dead inside.</p>
<p>Seriously, when I call him back.</p>
<p>Were you still able to have fun together?</p>
<p>That kind of thing?</p>
<p>Like when you say there&rsquo;s no emotion, there&rsquo;s more emotion around the basics of like everyday</p>
<p>life, but you&rsquo;re still able to just like enjoy shit together?</p>
<p>I was enjoying stuff, but I wasn&rsquo;t feeling.</p>
<p>I was like, this is fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>That was surface level like Lex, this is fun.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, there&rsquo;s nothing that, Hey, yeah, nothing.</p>
<p>And so we went through that for a long time and then I lived with his parents and we,</p>
<p>we lived there and that was, you know, God damn it.</p>
<p>His family was so good to me because I was a nightmare.</p>
<p>I was a nightmare.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t cook certain food around me anymore.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t, couldn&rsquo;t go certain places anymore.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t, you know, crowds were in hard no, we didn&rsquo;t do Canada today.</p>
<p>And like, I just changed, I moved in and was like, shit&rsquo;s got to change.</p>
<p>If you guys don&rsquo;t want me to kill everyone, like, and they were willing and they were</p>
<p>accepting and they were amazing about it.</p>
<p>And then we finally said, okay, well like, does this, is this, we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, I said, I used to say like, I L you like, I couldn&rsquo;t say love.</p>
<p>It freaked me out for a long time.</p>
<p>And then I finally said it and then that shit had said it like a month later and I was like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the same exact time.</p>
<p>I wanted the response.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he goes to treatment with me, he, whatever I need, he knows that like, hey, it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>for like him and like, how do I handle her?</p>
<p>And then we moved out and we bought a house and then he took a sweet ass time.</p>
<p>We were dating for four years before we were engaged because just to be sure the crazy</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t too crazy, he waited four years on that.</p>
<p>Smart man.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or you can, you could say he&rsquo;s just terrified of commitment, but both.</p>
<p>A little bit of both.</p>
<p>Hey, when you were the guy on the posters that all the girls sign up to, that sent all</p>
<p>the dirty pictures, fucking why are you giving that up?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Commitment is a real commitment then.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is the Jaco reset.</p>
<p>We talked about Brass in Unity a little bit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the longterm mission goal and dream of your company and the podcast of the same</p>
<p>name?</p>
<p>So for me, what I&rsquo;ve been trying to do with this company is create a community that can</p>
<p>really work together to not only help vets, first responders, but to really bridge the</p>
<p>gap with the civilian population and letting them know what we kind of go through and why</p>
<p>it is such a epidemic and why there is over 22 suicides a day and we are losing people</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s going out of style, like the amount of vets that are questioning the last 20 years</p>
<p>of their life right now is terrifying.</p>
<p>I work with organizations that are doing this outreach and they&rsquo;re overloaded right now</p>
<p>like they have never seen before because this whole thing is just, it&rsquo;s hit ahead here.</p>
<p>And so what Brass in Unity tries to do is it is really just a vehicle to get the money</p>
<p>in the hands of the people that are doing the work with it.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t start a nonprofit because I&rsquo;m not good at fundraising.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good at being like, give me your money, I&rsquo;m going to do this with it.</p>
<p>The least I could do is come up with a product that I know I could give to people or people</p>
<p>could purchase and if I gave pretty much all of the actual profit from it to those organizations</p>
<p>and I give them something to wear that is a touch piece or if they&rsquo;re out and somebody</p>
<p>sees a bullet on the wrist they go, hey, what is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a conversation starter and that&rsquo;s exactly what it&rsquo;s been and it&rsquo;s done its job as that.</p>
<p>And so we, like I said, we are a way to get the vehicle, we&rsquo;re the vehicle, we&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>money in the hands of the people.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t always want to just get a tax receipt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to donate to something, great on you to do that but most people have a selfish</p>
<p>aspect and that&rsquo;s okay but if you can tap into that you can then fund these charities</p>
<p>properly and give them the tools to do their jobs effectively.</p>
<p>Up until this point they just count on people&rsquo;s goodness of their hearts.</p>
<p>Hate to break it to you, humanity is rough right now.</p>
<p>We need to look at something a little differently.</p>
<p>So these things spark, like a jewelry sparks conversations and then do you work with charities?</p>
<p>Yes, oh God, yeah, that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>So my whole mission every day is I get up, I push jewelry and sunglasses on people and</p>
<p>say but now that you&rsquo;re gonna wear that, now you&rsquo;re a part of the B&amp;U Army, now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a part of this community.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, let me put it right back on, branded.</p>
<p>This is organic product placement.</p>
<p>Yeah, this isn&rsquo;t like marketing at all, nothing weird about this at all and so we work with</p>
<p>a lot of organizations and I&rsquo;m very particular about where we send our money because there</p>
<p>are, it feels like thousands of vet organizations right now and if we were able to consolidate,</p>
<p>it would be more ideal.</p>
<p>I spoke about that on another show but that&rsquo;s not currently happening.</p>
<p>So I try to work with the nonprofits I know, number one, are not paying six figure salaries</p>
<p>which trust me, there&rsquo;s lots, a lot.</p>
<p>Number two, I look at the actual resources that they&rsquo;re providing and if they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be something that are gonna be useful, in my opinion, whether or not they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>useful and I just don&rsquo;t think they are, that&rsquo;s up for debate.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s worked for me so I try to fund the things that I know have been helpful for</p>
<p>me and the people I associate with.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I brought all the paper because I didn&rsquo;t wanna be an idiot and forget anybody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important because I get caught up in things and I think it&rsquo;s important to</p>
<p>acknowledge.</p>
<p>So number one, Heroic Hearts, we just started working to talk about them and really make</p>
<p>them known but we&rsquo;re gonna be donating to them as well.</p>
<p>Are they doing more stuff than the ayahuasca thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, so their points are, I got Jesse to actually, I&rsquo;m like what are your talking points</p>
<p>because I need people to know exactly what you do.</p>
<p>So veterans have had to take their mental and general health into their own hands due</p>
<p>to the failure of the government system so that is why they were created but Heroic</p>
<p>Hearts is a peer supported mental health network involving full preparation, integration, coaching</p>
<p>and connection to vetted psychedelic treatments.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t just do ayahuasca, they deal with psilocybin, ketamine, ibogaine but they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got protocols in place, they&rsquo;ve got locations you go to that are safely vetted and they</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got over right now, Jesse said they have 800 veterans on a waiting list for treatment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just before the spike of the end of this war.</p>
<p>They have over a hundred, they&rsquo;ve helped over a hundred veterans including dozens of special</p>
<p>operation vets find effective care.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve now got branches in the US, UK and Canada and the biggest thing about them and</p>
<p>why we talk about them is because the problem of psychedelics and the stigma around it is</p>
<p>so significant but because of great universities that are now stepping up and doing the research</p>
<p>behind it, it is being legitimized.</p>
<p>So like they&rsquo;re doing that, in Canada there&rsquo;s a group called Theracil, they are currently</p>
<p>fighting the government to get the rights for Canadians under section 56 of our laws</p>
<p>to get compassionate care for psilocybin use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a panel with them on that really great base out of Victoria, really smart people.</p>
<p>One of the other bigger charities that we work with and they&rsquo;re honestly, they were</p>
<p>my first and foremost charity that I ever worked with and they&rsquo;re a big component in</p>
<p>the veteran community in Canada.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called Honour House and Honour House was started by honorary Colonel Aldi Genova.</p>
<p>It was started because of a guy named Trevor Green.</p>
<p>He was a Canadian soldier who deployed and he was, so Captain Trevor Green, sorry Trevor,</p>
<p>Captain Trevor Green, he got an ax in the middle of his head, a Taliban member came</p>
<p>up and put an ax directly into his head when his helmet was off and he survived.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done work with Invictus Games and Prince Harry.</p>
<p>He has an exoskeleton he uses on the island.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>He hasn&rsquo;t changed one bit from like the infantry captain you expect him to be.</p>
<p>And Al saw there was a need for vets and first responders to get treatment because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no real home away from home for people.</p>
<p>Picture Ronald McDonald for cancer and families, this is vets and first responders.</p>
<p>And so their whole thing, and I&rsquo;ll read it so I say it exactly right because I used to</p>
<p>be on the board of their charity, but I ran out of time, so now I just consult.</p>
<p>But they are a home away from home for members of the Canadian Armed Forces, veterans and</p>
<p>first responders and their families to stay completely free of charge while they&rsquo;re receiving</p>
<p>medical care and treatment in the Vancouver area.</p>
<p>But since then, they&rsquo;ve expanded since I&rsquo;ve come on board and they&rsquo;ve opened Honour Ranch,</p>
<p>which is up in Ashcroft, BC and it&rsquo;s 140 acres, 10 cabins and a main cabin.</p>
<p>They do equine therapy and they&rsquo;re more focused on operational stress injury clinic.</p>
<p>So sorry, operational stress injury within the veteran community.</p>
<p>And they have specialists that do that.</p>
<p>They have their own bracelet with us.</p>
<p>So every time you buy an Honour House bracelet, all the proceeds go to them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually the green one.</p>
<p>So that one.</p>
<p>So when you buy one of those Honour House bracelets, they have those.</p>
<p>They go directly to them, which is really amazing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been near and dear to my heart for a long time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the All Secure Foundation, which is these guys are these guys are super dope.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to read exactly because Jen text me.</p>
<p>So Jen and Tom Satterly, I&rsquo;ve had them both on the podcast.</p>
<p>Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.</p>
<p>Tom is a Delta.</p>
<p>Have you heard of them?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>So Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.</p>
<p>It was one of his first operations.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Delta operator.</p>
<p>And I asked her, I said, listen, I&rsquo;m going to be doing these shows and I think it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>that we talk about you more.</p>
<p>So I said, give me your three points of importance.</p>
<p>So the All Secure Foundation serves special operations combat families in healing from</p>
<p>post traumatic stress injury and secondary post traumatic stress.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s often what the wife or the other husband or the other spouse suffers from.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re starting to see that be more and more of an issue now.</p>
<p>So they also are devoted to rebuilding the couple&rsquo;s relationships on the home front after</p>
<p>the separations of war.</p>
<p>And 80% of their warriors want their families to be more involved in the healing.</p>
<p>The problem is, is very often vets don&rsquo;t realize that they can have, or just because the system</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t pay for it, actually have their spouse as a part of things.</p>
<p>And the biggest thing that we find with special operations families, I think the divorce rate</p>
<p>is like 95%.</p>
<p>And so they work so hard with these families.</p>
<p>They take them on retreats, these husband and wives, and they get them to connect again</p>
<p>after being separated over such a long period of time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other places like Children of Fallen Patriots out of DC, where they fund education,</p>
<p>university for people who have lost their parents in deployments, whether their kid&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even born yet.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re still in utero, they still pay.</p>
<p>They do not care.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got people like in Canada, you&rsquo;ve got Vets Canada, you&rsquo;ve got in the States,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got True Patriot Love, you&rsquo;ve got, who else in the States is really great that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve worked with.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a Green Beret Foundation that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>One More Wave gives amputees, teaches them to surf with amputees.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many organizations.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I focus on a small subset because you cannot fix everyone&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>The least you can do for people is focus.</p>
<p>If you can provide focus, you can provide the proper amount of funding.</p>
<p>Proper amount of funding can get the proper amount of tools.</p>
<p>Those tools can actually be implemented properly and then those people can go on to hopefully</p>
<p>have successful marriages and families and we don&rsquo;t have to watch our parents drink themselves</p>
<p>to death and wonder why daddy&rsquo;s yelling at mommy all the time and daddy storms out and</p>
<p>leaves.</p>
<p>Well, daddy had some shit happen in his life and mommy had some shit happen, but that does</p>
<p>not mean that&rsquo;s who they are.</p>
<p>And yes, so trauma has completely destructive effects on family and relationships and correcting</p>
<p>that as like ripple effects.</p>
<p>Oh, just astronomical ripple effects.</p>
<p>Because the problem is we are so quick to tell people they&rsquo;re suffering from PTSD.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so quick to give them drugs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so quick to kick them out of the military.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so quick to let them be homeless on the street.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so quick to let them fucking kill themselves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so quick.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, when when a politician goes, veteran suicide is an issue, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Well, if you prevent the problem from happening in the first place, or you give people the</p>
<p>right funding and tools to do the job, you won&rsquo;t have this problem.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people, think high school students, maybe undergrads, college</p>
<p>students about career, life, how to live a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had one heck of a life.</p>
<p>Some of them are really cheesy, but they&rsquo;re true.</p>
<p>Live a life you can be proud of, number one.</p>
<p>If you wake up every morning and you hate what you do, change the fucking station.</p>
<p>Do not live and stay in that perpetual cycle of bullshit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re on this planet for.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re worth more than that, than the monotony of waking up, going to work, hating your life,</p>
<p>drinking yourself to sleep, and functioning.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor.</p>
<p>The thing I scream about on the show so much is move your fucking body.</p>
<p>Move your body.</p>
<p>Get your blood moving.</p>
<p>Allow your body to do what it&rsquo;s here for.</p>
<p>Go for a run.</p>
<p>Go for a walk.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t run, walk to the fridge three times more than maybe you did before, but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re moving.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the shit you look at.</p>
<p>More now than ever, we are seeing our younger generation just be force fed information from</p>
<p>one side or the other, and none of it makes sense.</p>
<p>None of it&rsquo;s understandable.</p>
<p>It just causes chaos in the brain.</p>
<p>Really pay attention to what you listen to.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;ve had to learn to do is make time for myself.</p>
<p>All of this working 18 hours a day, not sleeping, just work, work, work.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not sustainable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not healthy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not anything anyone should be doing.</p>
<p>Balance is important.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to take the time to do something for yourself, don&rsquo;t make it sitting</p>
<p>in front of the TV for six hours, eating a bag of chips, drinking a Coke.</p>
<p>Make it, I&rsquo;m going to go for a walk, maybe listen to a podcast where I can learn something.</p>
<p>Make it, I&rsquo;m going to go volunteer somewhere.</p>
<p>Nobody does that anymore, but make it I can go volunteer somewhere.</p>
<p>Honor House, they have no paid employees.</p>
<p>They have one, everybody is a volunteer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fucking phenomenal.</p>
<p>Just do whatever you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>Do it with some fucking drive, put some goddamn effort into your life and pick something in</p>
<p>a career that&rsquo;s going to make you happy.</p>
<p>Not something that&rsquo;s just going to give you six figures because that&rsquo;s not going to make</p>
<p>you happy.</p>
<p>I can tell you right now, I have everything in the world and the last thing I want is</p>
<p>more things.</p>
<p>I want less.</p>
<p>I want the woods and I want quiet because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important to me.</p>
<p>I want my family to matter, the people around me to matter, and the small group I keep,</p>
<p>that tight knit I have, I want them to wake up every minute knowing that they have a friend</p>
<p>that they can call on the other line that isn&rsquo;t just like, how&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p>That can actually have a conversation, a meaningful, intelligent, caring conversation.</p>
<p>We are just breeding these kids to be followers who digest bullshit, who reverberate things</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t fully understand and have opinions on stuff they have no business talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, with an open mind, humbly think deeply about the world.</p>
<p>How has your relationship with death changed?</p>
<p>This is a Russian program, I have to ask you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve considered suicide throughout your life.</p>
<p>You have been in the line of fire, you have witnessed death.</p>
<p>You as a human being, a mortal one, do you think about your death these days now that</p>
<p>you have begun the journey with dealing with your trauma?</p>
<p>Do you think about your death?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of your death?</p>
<p>Well you don&rsquo;t die, so that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>What do you mean you don&rsquo;t die?</p>
<p>You move on.</p>
<p>Where do you go?</p>
<p>To another plane, and another vibration, and another whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t all of it.</p>
<p>This is a blip.</p>
<p>This is a moment.</p>
<p>This is a&hellip;</p>
<p>I used to be afraid of death before the military.</p>
<p>I was always afraid of dying.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I had this irrational fear that I was going to be kidnapped in my room, like seriously,</p>
<p>like irrational fear, like afraid.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny because I talked to Michaela yesterday and she said the same thing and</p>
<p>I was like, oh my God, I know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Being afraid of being kidnapped?</p>
<p>Yeah, she had this fear that someone was going to come in and take her out of her room.</p>
<p>I had the same fear.</p>
<p>By a human being or a monster of some kind?</p>
<p>No, I think like by a human being.</p>
<p>And I had this irrational fear that something was going to happen to me.</p>
<p>And like I said, I don&rsquo;t know if it was because my parents were always made me aware of my</p>
<p>surroundings.</p>
<p>People take people.</p>
<p>This is a real thing that happens.</p>
<p>I was really small and I looked like a little boy.</p>
<p>My hair was like that when I was training.</p>
<p>I had short, no hair, flat as a board.</p>
<p>You would have thought I was a 12 year old boy.</p>
<p>And so my mom&rsquo;s like, people take people, sweetie, that&rsquo;s just the reality of life.</p>
<p>You need to be aware.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if I had this ingrained in my mind.</p>
<p>I was always like training to protect myself or fight someone off.</p>
<p>So I was like afraid of like this irrational thing.</p>
<p>And then I went overseas and then I realized that I could just be literally there talking</p>
<p>to you, having a conversation, and I could just be taken off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>And then I adopted this idea that when it&rsquo;s my time, it&rsquo;ll be my time.</p>
<p>But the difference is now, at least I know that if I do go and I do cross and I am and</p>
<p>I do move on, I know that I live my life the way that I always hoped I would be proud to</p>
<p>live.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a dark question because we, you mentioned Robin Williams, you mentioned</p>
<p>Anthony Bourdain and your own struggle with suicide.</p>
<p>Why do you think they ultimately lost the battle, that battle?</p>
<p>Why do you think they took their lives?</p>
<p>Man, that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a loaded question because you could look at everything from, from biomarkers</p>
<p>in the brain to know if their serotonin and dopamine levels were crashed in the ground.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s biological reasonings for some people where they&rsquo;re born bipolar</p>
<p>and they have, or, you know, they&rsquo;re schizophrenic, like there&rsquo;s so many things we don&rsquo;t fully</p>
<p>grasp about the brain.</p>
<p>But what we do know from my perspective, for me at least, there really is no rhyme or reason</p>
<p>why I survived and others didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Stuff and things don&rsquo;t make you happy.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t always know why they&rsquo;re feeling the way they&rsquo;re feeling, but they also are,</p>
<p>also are not always willing to talk about it or be, they put on a good front.</p>
<p>And if nobody knows any different, what do you expect?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s especially clear with the, the two of them that on the surface they&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>exceptionally successful in so many dimensions and still that means nothing.</p>
<p>Well possessions, anything really is not, doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you happiness.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s terrifying, but when it&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s what makes it joyful.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what happiness is, is like holy shit somehow amidst all the absurdity, all</p>
<p>the things that you can&rsquo;t predict, you, you nevertheless feel really good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I feel really fortunate to be getting this feat of happiness all the time.</p>
<p>Well to be or not to be, that&rsquo;s a good place to end it.</p>
<p>Kelsey, you&rsquo;re an amazing human being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really fortunate that you would spend your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>As I said, you&rsquo;re so good at not just talking, but listening.</p>
<p>So I definitely will listen to your podcast because I can tell you&rsquo;re an incredible person</p>
<p>as an interviewer and as a storyteller.</p>
<p>So again, thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, bye.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Kelsey Sharon.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Herbert Hoover.</p>
<p>Older men declare war, but it is the youth that must fight and die.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
