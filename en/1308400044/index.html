    <p>Hi friends, so shit looks a little different and it&rsquo;s gonna get fixed in a second, but I recorded this episode yesterday</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hungover right now</p>
<p>But I recorded this episode yesterday and the whole fucking like beginning part of it cut out</p>
<p>So now I have to refilm it and usually I would just shut the fuck up refilm and add it in</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna start letting y&rsquo;all know when I&rsquo;m struggling and shit&rsquo;s going wrong</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struggling right now because I&rsquo;m hungover but to I&rsquo;m struggling because this fucking equipment. I don&rsquo;t know how to use it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to work it</p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s episode is gonna be about knowing when to leave someone because that&rsquo;s the fucking hardest shit to come to</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna share everything I&rsquo;ve learned and everything</p>
<p>I know that will bring you clarity around your decision because if you&rsquo;re sitting there questioning</p>
<p>Should I leave this person or should I not you already know your answer?</p>
<p>But what you need is reassurance and certainty that this is the right decision to make so that&rsquo;s what this episode is for</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna teach you everything I fucking learned and everything you need to ask yourself and everything you need to kind of see</p>
<p>Like all the new perspectives and shit. I&rsquo;m gonna give you I&rsquo;ve got you</p>
<p>This is gonna get deep too. So buckle your little seatbelt</p>
<p>but after you listen to this podcast, you&rsquo;re gonna have the confidence that you need and just knowing and</p>
<p>Finally seeing that, you know</p>
<p>You need to leave someone is totally different from actually doing it like knowing you need to do something and then actually doing it</p>
<p>Two different conversations bitch, but this is to bring you clarity about</p>
<p>Knowing when you need to leave and this could be applied to friendships, too</p>
<p>But this is mainly gonna be geared toward relationships. And then at the end, I&rsquo;ve got some things and</p>
<p>WWLD what would Leo do? That&rsquo;s where I have you guys right in and ask for advice</p>
<p>You told me your situation</p>
<p>I give you what I would do my hot take on it and I give you two</p>
<p>Examples of things to do in relationships and then I teach you how to manipulate your parents</p>
<p>Or like shitty parents like when your life is hard like this girl stuck living with her parents and they&rsquo;re on her fucking ass</p>
<p>So I gave you guys at the end of this episode a way to manipulate your parents</p>
<p>But stay tuned to the end for that, but one more little tidbit from hungover Leo</p>
<p>Okay, one more tidbit for me before we jump into this whole episode is</p>
<p>sometimes</p>
<p>You need more than just caring about someone like just loving someone and caring for someone isn&rsquo;t enough and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a harsh reality for people to accept. But sometimes you have to love logically. You can&rsquo;t always just</p>
<p>Go with your heart like you have to it&rsquo;s like 50-50 like half go with your heart half love logically like you have to be</p>
<p>smart and</p>
<p>Your heart will lead you</p>
<p>down a fucking painful path if you let it so that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m gonna tie these two things in is following your heart and</p>
<p>following logic because you have to love logically too and a big thing with that is</p>
<p>Learning to take yourself into consideration</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re with someone who kind of like discards the way that you feel or you&rsquo;re in a relationship where you&rsquo;re not looked after</p>
<p>Or like taking care of emotionally and like cared for</p>
<p>Who the fuck&rsquo;s left to take care of you if you don&rsquo;t do it, you know</p>
<p>So I will never teach you against yourself</p>
<p>So with that being said, we&rsquo;re gonna start jumping into this shit</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna notice the screens gonna change the lighting is gonna get better because it&rsquo;s nighttime right now</p>
<p>Okay, leave me alone. But like I&rsquo;ve recorded it in the day. So here we go. Enjoy the episode</p>
<p>So the first thing I want to say is if you&rsquo;re contemplating leaving someone it&rsquo;s totally normal to be scared shitless, babe</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s totally expected for you to be scared to be alone. Like if you&rsquo;ve learned to live with someone</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re scared to live without them</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s like like you&rsquo;re so used to having this person in your life or dating this person</p>
<p>No shit, you&rsquo;re scared to leave we all got that fair being alone</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re dating someone it&rsquo;s like times ten and like I said in my breakups episode</p>
<p>When you leave someone or you break up with someone you&rsquo;re not just losing the person</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re losing your entire life as you knew it. So of course you&rsquo;re scared</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re hesitating to make this decision to leave or not</p>
<p>And when I say lifestyle, sometimes people are in relationships. I was in one personally where</p>
<p>Someone was way more well-off than I was financially. So it wasn&rsquo;t just choosing to leave the person</p>
<p>It was choosing to leave the lifestyle. I&rsquo;d always wanted to but with that I just want to say if</p>
<p>Someone having money is not enough for you to want to stay with them. That&rsquo;s totally fine</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the exact boat that I was in money&rsquo;s fun. It&rsquo;s cute</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make a whole episode about all this shit</p>
<p>But money is not fulfilling and if that&rsquo;s the only reason you&rsquo;re staying in a relationship is financial security</p>
<p>I get it</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re someone that requires more from a person I get you wanting to leave and</p>
<p>Your decision should be to leave like if someone only can contribute money and they are gonna neglect you</p>
<p>Emotionally and neglect everything else like they can give you certain things with because of their money if you&rsquo;re not fulfilled</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not fulfilled and you&rsquo;re not wrong or bad for it</p>
<p>So I want to reassure you of that first, but straight out the gate you&rsquo;re going to outgrow people</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way things are you&rsquo;re going to outgrow people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna outgrow everyone and a big thing people don&rsquo;t understand about relationships is people are constantly changing like as a human being you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say aging but time is going on and if you think you are the same person</p>
<p>That you were when you first met someone and then a couple years go down. You&rsquo;re still in a relationship</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re both totally different fucking people. So you have to have periods where you like reassess</p>
<p>Everything going on and like what you want out of a relationship and especially if you&rsquo;re on a self-development journey</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re all about the awareness, like I am I&rsquo;m a whole different motherfucker every three months</p>
<p>Like I feel like an entirely different person. I have new thoughts. I have new perspectives and outlooks on life. I have new desires</p>
<p>I have new goals and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m in a position right now where I want to be single is because I&rsquo;m changing so rapidly</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been like this my whole life, but I change so rapidly. It&rsquo;s hard for people to keep up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for people to grow with me at the level that I grow in the level that I change because I&rsquo;m not the</p>
<p>Type to hold myself back from my own growth and my own expansion and if you&rsquo;re with someone who is resisting growing with you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re attached to the person you were when they met you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not here for the person that wants to grow and get better and develop and change</p>
<p>Like if someone is locked in with who you were, that&rsquo;s who they&rsquo;re gonna expect you to be</p>
<p>So if you start growing and improving your life and improving yourself and everything about you like the self-development shit the journey</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come out because it&rsquo;s a goddamn journey</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna be able to handle it and they&rsquo;re gonna hold you back from it</p>
<p>so you might get to a place where it&rsquo;s like a standstill of like</p>
<p>Me or them my growth or this relationship and also with people you don&rsquo;t truly meet them until you spend time with them</p>
<p>like as time goes on is when you truly meet someone because like when you first meet and you have a</p>
<p>Relationship and it&rsquo;s all fun and it&rsquo;s good and everybody&rsquo;s on their best behavior</p>
<p>You need to see someone struggle first before you think that you know them</p>
<p>You need to spend a lot of time around someone and be with someone for a while</p>
<p>Before you can even say I know you if you have not seen them act in emotional states</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t fucking know somebody because as soon as you see somebody how they behave when they don&rsquo;t get something that they want</p>
<p>You might realize that&rsquo;s not someone I want to be with same thing with struggle</p>
<p>Like when you watch someone struggle, you don&rsquo;t know them until you see that</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know who they truly are and how they truly behave and how they handle things and with saying people are on their best</p>
<p>Behavior in the beginning. Yeah, I said it and that&rsquo;s the fucking truth. But the main question with all of this</p>
<p>I want you to ask this little tidbit. I was talking about is ask yourself</p>
<p>Do their words that they were telling me in the beginning?</p>
<p>Match up with their actions now because when it&rsquo;s the honeymoon phase and everything&rsquo;s great and peaches and cream and it&rsquo;s beautiful and fun and</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like the most perfect person you&rsquo;ve ever met are all their words that they were like selling you on in the beginning</p>
<p>Matching up with their actions like a lot of people like to talk about all I want to build an empire with you</p>
<p>I want to do this</p>
<p>I want to do that with you and they sell you on this shit and then they get you you need to evaluate</p>
<p>Are they acting on what they said are their words matching their actions? Are they keeping up on promises?</p>
<p>are they keeping up on ideas and suggestions and shit that they were talking about in the beginning or</p>
<p>Have things changed or can you see now?</p>
<p>it was just their fucking mouth running, you know, and when I say when people feel like they get you a lot of a</p>
<p>Relationship is like people pursuing each other. You&rsquo;re excited. It&rsquo;s fun. It&rsquo;s like, oh my god</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like going at each other and it&rsquo;s so fucking great and then they feel like they get you and</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re with someone that feels like they got you and they got the security and stability</p>
<p>A lot of people will start slacking the fuck off with the actions that it took to get you</p>
<p>So like the way that they treated you before they felt stable with you will be different once they feel stable</p>
<p>So like I said, everybody&rsquo;s on their best behavior. They&rsquo;re doing all this shit, right?</p>
<p>but then as soon as they feel</p>
<p>Stable I can no longer have to get you like once they feel like they get you and they have the stability with you</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re secure in their relationship with you</p>
<p>a lot of people slack the fuck off and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s totally grounds to break up with someone because they&rsquo;re painting an image of who they are and how they&rsquo;re gonna treat you</p>
<p>And then you get into a relationship with them and time goes on and this person dies</p>
<p>This is who they truly are in a relationship</p>
<p>They were doing all this fluffy shit and treating you nice because that&rsquo;s what they felt like they had to do to get you</p>
<p>But now that they got you</p>
<p>You have to evaluate them like two different people</p>
<p>The person that I was talking to that in the beginning are they still the same person?</p>
<p>Are they still treating me the same way?</p>
<p>Do they still make me feel cared about and valued and cared for and considered do they make me feel good about myself?</p>
<p>you need to evaluate is that person still who you&rsquo;re in a relationship with or have they flipped have they switched because if they have</p>
<p>Switched that&rsquo;s grounds to break up and I&rsquo;m gonna give you that reassurance</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bait and switch like they behave a certain way to bait you and then once they get you they switch up and they</p>
<p>Expect you to stay fuck that fuck that</p>
<p>There needs to be a lot of communication that needs to happen</p>
<p>You need to talk about the things that you&rsquo;re experiencing and talk about what you&rsquo;re unhappy with</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve noticed a drastic switch in a person between when they were trying to get you and now that they have you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed to leave them for that a hundred fucking percent. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if they think it&rsquo;s unfair</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfair to you to expect yourself to stay with someone that did that shit to you. That ain&rsquo;t cool</p>
<p>You need to talk about it and bring it up to them and be like what happened to that person?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s all that? I miss them. You know, you need to talk about it first, but if you&rsquo;re at a point where you&rsquo;ve talked about it and</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s changed. That&rsquo;s your first sign. You need to fucking go out to do</p>
<p>My next point kind of ties along with that. So in the beginning of like talking to someone like a beginning a relationship</p>
<p>Like you feel valued you feel good. You feel appreciated you feel all these good things</p>
<p>Do you still feel that way as time goes on in the relationship? Do you still feel valued? Do you still feel appreciated?</p>
<p>Do you still feel like this person truly likes you and I don&rsquo;t want to go too much deeper into that</p>
<p>But you know what? I&rsquo;m about to say. That&rsquo;s another sign that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>needing to go is</p>
<p>If you no longer feel valued or appreciated and I&rsquo;ve lived my life where if I don&rsquo;t feel valued wherever I&rsquo;m at</p>
<p>I do not make myself stay there</p>
<p>I will get the fuck out and it started when I was 12 years old and I moved out for the first time I ran</p>
<p>Away from home because I didn&rsquo;t feel valued so I fucking bounced and I made a commitment to myself</p>
<p>I will never stay somewhere. I don&rsquo;t feel valued or appreciated and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to leave a lot of</p>
<p>Situations. I&rsquo;ve had to leave a lot of people. I&rsquo;ve had to leave a lifestyle</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of because I did not feel valued and appreciated</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve kept that promise to myself no matter how much pain it comes with because I might lose everybody else</p>
<p>But at the time that you choose to leave somewhere you don&rsquo;t feel valued you choose yourself in that moment</p>
<p>You come back to yourself</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the best thing you can do for yourself in your relationship with you is to never leave you and to never</p>
<p>Discard yourself and allow yourself to stay somewhere. You don&rsquo;t feel valued. It&rsquo;s like fuck that shit</p>
<p>so my next point with knowing when to leave do you have to discard part of yourself or</p>
<p>Discard yourself and the way that you feel in order to stay with this person</p>
<p>Like do you have to ignore certain things for the relationship to work?</p>
<p>And this can be like past hurt that has happened. This could be disrespect that has happened that</p>
<p>The person will not talk about it. The person can&rsquo;t own up to their shit</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like do you have to put aside the fact that you&rsquo;ve been disrespected and do you have to put aside the fact that you&rsquo;ve been?</p>
<p>Hurt before in order for things to work</p>
<p>Like if there&rsquo;s no grounds to talk about it the relationships done</p>
<p>You should never have to discard yourself or anything that you feel in</p>
<p>Order to for the relationship to keep going like if you bring a certain thing up that hurt you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll like freak out or they make it like your fault. They don&rsquo;t want to talk about it</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a big fucking deal. That&rsquo;s not gonna go nowhere good and</p>
<p>Especially with feeling stupid if you&rsquo;re in a relationship with someone that has done something that makes you feel stupid</p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t talk about it or like bring it up</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a fight or whatever it is if you have to put to the side the fact that you feel stupid</p>
<p>Especially disrespected but like if you feel stupid and you have to put that to the side in order to stay with this person</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re throwing yourself to the side and choosing this other person over yourself, and I&rsquo;m sorry to put it that way to you</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what the fuck it is because you&rsquo;re having to tell yourself. Shut up. I don&rsquo;t care that you were disrespected</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care that you feel stupid and I don&rsquo;t care that you&rsquo;ve been hurt. I&rsquo;m staying with this person</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re turning against yourself to stay with them</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I say</p>
<p>Do you have to discard yourself or throw something about yourself to the side for the relationship to continue?</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really fat fucking sign that you need to leave and</p>
<p>Another really big thing about that is boundaries</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t feel like you can set boundaries or you have to let go of certain boundaries in order for a relationship to work</p>
<p>Same thing applies get the fuck out</p>
<p>All right</p>
<p>Cuz that&rsquo;s the same thing is like throwing yourself away. You&rsquo;re having to throw parts of yourself away to be close to this person</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna feel truly attached to them</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna truly feel loved unless you bring all of yourself forward</p>
<p>You have to bring the part of you that feels stupid forward</p>
<p>You have to let this person see this part and take care of this part and care about that part, too</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t bring a part of you that has like been hurt before</p>
<p>To someone you&rsquo;re in a relationship with and allow them to tell that part to shut the fuck up. It&rsquo;s invalid. It&rsquo;s stupid</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re reading the situation wrong. It doesn&rsquo;t matter get over it that</p>
<p>Causes me to go into fight-or-flight. I&rsquo;m sorry. You feel that way just get over it</p>
<p>I want to knock a fucking hole in your goddamn forehead when people say that shit to me, but if</p>
<p>You try to bring that to somebody else and they dismiss that part of you in order to stay with them</p>
<p>You have to do the same thing. You have to throw that part of you away, too</p>
<p>And I will never teach you against yourself. All right, so leave their fucking ass</p>
<p>All right</p>
<p>The next way you can know if you need to leave is if you&rsquo;ve communicated something to your partner that you want or don&rsquo;t like and</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t changed it</p>
<p>They put you in a position to choose you or them and that&rsquo;s what that keeps coming back to is like if they ever put</p>
<p>You at odds with yourself do not ever choose somebody else over yourself</p>
<p>Trust no one bitch. It&rsquo;s on my hand and I&rsquo;m gonna remind you every fucking episode I make</p>
<p>Do not ever choose anyone over yourself unless it&rsquo;s your child</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m down for choosing your child over yourself</p>
<p>Like you once you bring a kid into this world your life as you know, it is done</p>
<p>You no longer live for yourself. You live for that fucking child. That&rsquo;s my opinion. I know it&rsquo;s not spiritual</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not what everybody else says. I&rsquo;m old-fashioned. I don&rsquo;t play that shit</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fucking kid is your number one you come second</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re with someone and you&rsquo;ve told them and communicated with them something that makes you uncomfortable</p>
<p>Makes you unhappy something that you don&rsquo;t like or something that you want more of like I want to feel more valued</p>
<p>I want to feel more appreciated do not ever fucking ask someone to do more for you to make you feel more valued</p>
<p>You better fucking leave. All right</p>
<p>Let me just not be so aggressive. All right, but my little heart gets hurt</p>
<p>I can deal with a lot but to think about you guys dealing with this shit, too</p>
<p>Like I want to grab you by your fucking little face and like save you from this situation</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s why I get so amped up. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m not being tough</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not attacking you guys, but my fucking heart goes out to you because I get it and</p>
<p>to think about you guys dealing with this shit, like I literally get the chills like to think about you guys going through these situations and</p>
<p>Staying somewhere. You don&rsquo;t feel valued. Like I it literally like fucking breaks me</p>
<p>Like I want to save all of you, but I can&rsquo;t like you all have free will you have to do it for yourself?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna give you everything that I know</p>
<p>That will help save you</p>
<p>But yes</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve communicated to somebody that you don&rsquo;t like something or you do want something and they don&rsquo;t make an effort to change it</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;ve just done is removed themselves</p>
<p>From the decision you&rsquo;re gonna make of staying with them or not because you&rsquo;re basically by communicating. I do want this</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want this you&rsquo;re bringing them in on</p>
<p>You making a decision about the relationship, but if they&rsquo;ve shown you through their actions</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna change fucking shit</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t care about doing things that make you feel more comfortable or make you happy if they&rsquo;ve shown you they&rsquo;re not gonna change it</p>
<p>You remove them from what you&rsquo;re gonna decide to do about the relationship</p>
<p>You no longer are gonna go to them and talk about your unmet needs and what you like and what you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>You did that you gave them the chance to make the relationship work now</p>
<p>You do what the fuck is best for you</p>
<p>You pick them up and you drop them out of this decision. You&rsquo;re gonna make alright</p>
<p>So now all you take into consideration is your goddamn self because that&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;re fucking doing you give people the same courtesy and the same</p>
<p>Consideration that they give you and if they&rsquo;re not doing anything to help you or change anything or like help you stay with them</p>
<p>Discard them just like they did you trust me. You&rsquo;re gonna be the one that got away</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna freak the fuck out as soon as you leave them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna start doing all the things you were asking for because people are not fucking stupid if</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been asking for something over and over and someone is not changing it. They know what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re choosing not to change it</p>
<p>and as soon as you leave their fucking ass is when all of a sudden everything that they</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t been doing they&rsquo;ll start doing it, but that&rsquo;s just validation right there</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve known what the fuck to do to keep you this entire time</p>
<p>But you do not go back because that is just change behavior to bait you back. They&rsquo;re not fucking changed. They&rsquo;re not different</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re communicating with somebody and trying to get them to change certain things and they just won&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re telling you</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m gonna do it. I&rsquo;m gonna do it and then they don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re discarding you. All right, that&rsquo;s just straight-up</p>
<p>What the fuck it is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say it but that&rsquo;s a sign you need to leave is if you&rsquo;ve said something over and over and over again and</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fucking change. You&rsquo;re justified to leave and that&rsquo;s a big sign. You should all right next</p>
<p>Do they expect you to be okay with things that they would not be?</p>
<p>Okay with and do they expect you to put effort into</p>
<p>Like fixing the relationship that they wouldn&rsquo;t put in it&rsquo;s like cheating like I&rsquo;m gonna just go ahead and knock cheating out</p>
<p>Someone cheats on you. It&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>You can never repair the trust that is broken when someone cheats</p>
<p>You can try your best to create repair in a relationship, but you can never fully repair it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if I take this glass and I fucking throw it at the wall and shatter it</p>
<p>What it is is never what it&rsquo;s gonna be after I fucking break it</p>
<p>I can glue all the pieces back together in the exact spots. It&rsquo;s never gonna be the fucking same. It&rsquo;s always gonna leak</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never gonna go back to how it was</p>
<p>Relationships are like that when it comes to cheating as soon as you step out. It&rsquo;s done. So I don&rsquo;t want you to carry that guilt</p>
<p>Someone cheating on you and you not wanting to stay with them</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fully allowed to leave</p>
<p>Because what you subject yourself to when someone cheats on you is putting yourself at war with yourself and that person</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s gonna take on the burden of</p>
<p>Not being able to trust them and overthinking and second-guessing and every time they text you. Oh, I&rsquo;m going to the store</p>
<p>Are you really going to the store? You&rsquo;re gonna be freaking the fuck out</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be checking the cameras on your phone</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna fucking show up at the store cuz I fucking would I have like I&rsquo;ve followed people like once you break that trust</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done learn from my mistake. Don&rsquo;t fucking put up with that shit</p>
<p>it sucks, but if you decide that you no longer want to take on the burden of</p>
<p>Trying to be with someone after they&rsquo;ve cheated that&rsquo;s fully fucking justified and they can eat a fat fucking dick unless you cheat back</p>
<p>Okay, if someone is coming at you that&rsquo;s cheated on you saying you&rsquo;re selfish</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not like we don&rsquo;t love them enough all this and that go fucking cheat on them and then make them deal with the repercussions</p>
<p>of their fucking actions</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;ll get to see what you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll take on the burden to of what it&rsquo;s like to try and fucking make the</p>
<p>Relationship work and for you to go cheat back is not a fucking problem because their relationships already done once they cheat</p>
<p>So you cheating is just to put them in your fucking shoes and show them. It&rsquo;s truly fucking done</p>
<p>Okay, cuz someone can&rsquo;t fucking cheat on you and say I love you</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fucking love and someone who loves you will never fucking cheat on you</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna just go ahead and knock that out. Like I&rsquo;m very passionate about this entire episode</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m not trying to be rough with y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>But you got to fucking hear it and this is the shit that I needed to fucking hear</p>
<p>But my big point about this is do they expect you to be okay with things that they would not be okay with like just flip</p>
<p>The rolls you got cheated on or they were just DMing someone on Instagram. They didn&rsquo;t actually go fuck nobody</p>
<p>They were just DMing someone on Instagram and you caught it and you freaked the fuck out and you were like mad about it</p>
<p>And they act like you should just be cool with it and forgive them and get over it</p>
<p>Would they act the same if they were in your shoes if you were the one talking to somebody else would they just get over?</p>
<p>It would they just not feel jealous would they just not overthink would they just not want to go through your motherfucking phone when you&rsquo;re sleeping?</p>
<p>Cuz I sure as shit would I go through everybody&rsquo;s phone?</p>
<p>And if you take one thing away from me go through everybody&rsquo;s motherfucking phone</p>
<p>I go through my friends phones too because I got to see if you talking shit</p>
<p>like I just like to know like</p>
<p>Every we can have a whole fucking podcast episode about going through people&rsquo;s phones and I&rsquo;m a break that shit down for you</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t agree with going through people&rsquo;s phones, you&rsquo;re fucking ignorant</p>
<p>All right, you&rsquo;re immature people think it&rsquo;s immature to go through someone&rsquo;s phone. No, that&rsquo;s a tool</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into it another episode</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re mad that I just called you fucking ignorant go through your partner&rsquo;s goddamn phone and face</p>
<p>Reality people that don&rsquo;t go through people&rsquo;s fucking phones are too chicken shit and too scared of what they&rsquo;re gonna find</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t I trust them. You&rsquo;re a fucking dumbass trust. No one trust is earned. Trust is not just given</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like respect if you want to be respected be respectable do something to be worthy of respect. Don&rsquo;t freely trust</p>
<p>Anyone do not just unconditionally just give trust to someone because they haven&rsquo;t hurt you before</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like thinking a stove is not gonna burn you because it hasn&rsquo;t burned you before no bitch. It&rsquo;s still hot</p>
<p>All right next next question to ask yourself</p>
<p>Are you only staying with this person because the amount of time you&rsquo;ve already invested?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard pill to swallow and a lot of people get trapped in that or like oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already wasted so much time in this relationship if I could just make it work. I wouldn&rsquo;t have to fucking leave</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>But I want to take you out of that perspective for a second and quit looking at time as wasted and like oh I spent</p>
<p>20 years with somebody I</p>
<p>get it, but</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not time wasted because like if you&rsquo;re faced with a decision we&rsquo;re like that is the relationship you&rsquo;re in you fucking hate it if</p>
<p>You choose to stay in it</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re choosing to throw away the remainder of your life</p>
<p>I have the potential of what it could be and what your life could be like without this relationship without this hell</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re living in so the way you can kind of like reframe this in your head is look at this person</p>
<p>Like you have no history look at the person you&rsquo;re dating like you have no fucking history</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;ve been together for one year one month ten years</p>
<p>Whatever look at the person objectively straight the fuck up if I had no time invested in this person</p>
<p>But I know what I know about them what I still choose to go forward into a relationship with them</p>
<p>So pretend that you&rsquo;ve invested no time</p>
<p>Would you still want to go be with this person and if your answer is no?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you know you need to leave because a lot of people get trapped in that like oh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already been together this long. We have a kids together. We have a fucking dog together couples that get dogs</p>
<p>Please but a lot of people get stressed out about thinking that they waste the time just look at them and say</p>
<p>Would I entertain or even pursue a relationship with them if I had no time invested?</p>
<p>And I know what I know now what I go forward with it, and there&rsquo;s your answer</p>
<p>Alright, this next one is a big one for me, but look at your relationship and look at your life</p>
<p>Do you feel like you are limiting yourself and limiting the potential for your life by staying in the relationship that you&rsquo;re considering leaving</p>
<p>if you feel like you are limiting yourself and</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re holding yourself back from the potential that you could reach because of the person that you&rsquo;re with</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sign that you know</p>
<p>You need to go</p>
<p>Another way you can look at this is look at the potential and the hope and the goals you have for your life</p>
<p>Is this person going to assist you in getting there?</p>
<p>Are you stronger with the relationship or are you hindered by it?</p>
<p>Is this person holding you back from it like being in this relationship? Are you able to?</p>
<p>Go do what you want to do like from an example with me and one of the relationships I was in</p>
<p>For me to go have a persona online and be in the public eye</p>
<p>I could not have done that and been with the person I was with they would have fucking</p>
<p>ruined me and</p>
<p>The relationship would have went to shit</p>
<p>I felt like I was limiting myself by not getting online</p>
<p>so that makes sense because I&rsquo;m able to reach a lot more people and build what I&rsquo;ve built and</p>
<p>Before I built all of this. I had like this feeling of like there&rsquo;s things I&rsquo;m supposed to do and</p>
<p>I knew I was faced with a decision of</p>
<p>If I stay with this person</p>
<p>I have to give up this potential and I wasn&rsquo;t willing to make that trade-off</p>
<p>Like me giving up the potential for my life to stay with someone</p>
<p>Fuck that shit. Like I said, I will never teach you to choose someone over yourself</p>
<p>So if you feel like you&rsquo;re limiting yourself and you&rsquo;re limiting like what your life could be by being with someone</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sign that you know, you need to go. All right this next one who personal very personal. Do you feel like you&rsquo;re settling?</p>
<p>You already know the fucking answer it already popped in your head whether it&rsquo;s looks whether it&rsquo;s personality whether it&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>Whatever it is if you feel like you are settling in any way</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a sign, you know, you need to leave if you cannot choose to settle with this person without</p>
<p>Resentment without getting mad about it and without holding it over their head like every move they make everything that they do</p>
<p>Are you gonna secretly in the back of your head be like motherfucker? You&rsquo;re the ugly one</p>
<p>Like why are you treating me like this? Are you gonna have resentment?</p>
<p>Are you gonna hold that power play because if you are you gotta go babe, like I&rsquo;ve been there</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve fucking been there of like where the fuck do you think you are gonna treat me like this?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in a relationship, you cannot look down on the other person if you choose to settle</p>
<p>You have to choose to see yourself on an even playing field</p>
<p>And if you cannot choose to see the other person as equal to you and not that you&rsquo;re better than them</p>
<p>You gotta go cuz that shit will fuck you up for multiple reasons, but that&rsquo;s just one way</p>
<p>You know, you need to go but trust me if you feel like you&rsquo;re settling you can choose to settle</p>
<p>But do not choose to settle if you cannot do it without resentment and the power play</p>
<p>Okay, next one&rsquo;s really big. This one&rsquo;s gonna help you a lot</p>
<p>But I want you to look at your partner and just imagine for a second</p>
<p>What would need to change about the person that I&rsquo;m with?</p>
<p>For me to be fully 100% like yes, I want to stay with you forever</p>
<p>Make a list literally make a fucking list of everything that would need to change in order for you to say</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m willing to spend the rest of my life with you</p>
<p>Like I fully am ready to commit what would need to change what would need to be different about them</p>
<p>This reveals everything that&rsquo;s missing that you weren&rsquo;t aware of and also all of your unmet needs that you have</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna flare all that shit up and you&rsquo;re gonna become aware of it</p>
<p>But then once you have your list, you know, this person you&rsquo;re dating</p>
<p>I need you to evaluate is the person I&rsquo;m dating ever actually</p>
<p>Going to be able to achieve this of the person that I would want to stay with forever</p>
<p>Like are they able to meet this list? Are they able to grow into this?</p>
<p>Are they able to become this like evaluate the person that you know?</p>
<p>You can see if someone has the potential of reaching that or not and not the fake fucking fairy tale potential</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking look at their fucking actions. Look at who they are how they behave what they do how they operate</p>
<p>From where they are and what you&rsquo;ve seen in their actions. Do you feel they&rsquo;re actually capable of becoming that?</p>
<p>Everyone has the potential to do anything that they want, but I&rsquo;m not talking about look at the potential</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about look at the potential of the actions</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve shown are they in line?</p>
<p>With the trajectory to get them from where they are to what you need them to be on that fucking list</p>
<p>You got to evaluate and be like realistic with yourself</p>
<p>Do I really think that they&rsquo;re gonna turn into this or do I not and it&rsquo;s very hard to face reality</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a good way to pull it out. All right next way to know that you need to leave</p>
<p>What would you tell your child to do if they came to you with the exact situation that you&rsquo;re in?</p>
<p>and I always like to bring up children because it&rsquo;s so much easier to see the innocence of a child and</p>
<p>To guide them and want to help them and be there for them</p>
<p>But what I want you to realize is like the little version of you when you think of yourself as a child</p>
<p>at no point</p>
<p>Did that child die and you just became who you are?</p>
<p>Your child self is still in you. I get chills every time I fucking my nipples are hard</p>
<p>I could cut glass like I get chills every time I talk about this shit</p>
<p>Because this has been the biggest component for me making a lot of hard decisions</p>
<p>And I have to do it for little me all the time. Like I&rsquo;ve become what little me always needed</p>
<p>I will never let him down. I will never hurt him like other people have hurt him ever</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re choosing to do to yourself and make yourself put up with you&rsquo;re making a child put up with it, too</p>
<p>It is the child version of you</p>
<p>but if you want to completely dissociate from the fact that it&rsquo;s you like a child is still inside you and</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re forcing that child to go through what you&rsquo;re choosing to go through if you need clarity about whether you want to leave or not</p>
<p>Ask yourself. What would I tell my child to do in this situation if they came to me with it?</p>
<p>What would I tell them to do and why if you can tell yourself the why?</p>
<p>with it also</p>
<p>It like taps you into a higher level of your own consciousness and you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>Really face that shit and that&rsquo;s your biggest</p>
<p>chance at</p>
<p>Really leaving if you need to leave because like I said, it&rsquo;s easy to make the decision to leave and know you need to leave</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to make the decision. But my last thing I want you to ask yourself if you&rsquo;re considering leaving</p>
<p>This is the thing that got me</p>
<p>Literally up off of the couch at my ex&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>Like I literally was scrolling Instagram minding my fucking business</p>
<p>And all of a sudden awareness wants to hit me in the face and I hate when that shit happens</p>
<p>But I love it at the same time. I saw a quote that said</p>
<p>Do you want this forever and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m my phone literally was standing in my hand and I just like</p>
<p>Set my phone in my lap and I looked around the house and I was like</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>Like I hit me in that moment</p>
<p>I was like I don&rsquo;t want this forever like even if this person becomes everything</p>
<p>I want them to be it still just doesn&rsquo;t feel right with them. So ask yourself. Do I want this?</p>
<p>forever and</p>
<p>I want to go in deeper into the this</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t make a decision based off of the future potential</p>
<p>You have to make your decision based off of what you&rsquo;ve seen and what you&rsquo;re experiencing right now. Do I want this right now?</p>
<p>forever</p>
<p>Okay, the answer you need is gonna pop into your fucking head when that happens, and I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>I wish I never saw that fucking post, but it is what truly made me</p>
<p>Change my entire life and choose to leave and that&rsquo;s when I chose to step out of the lifestyle that I&rsquo;ve always wanted and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking like</p>
<p>More money than you know what to do with and I chose to leave it and go back to working as a nurse</p>
<p>Because I felt like I was limiting my life and I knew I did not want that forever</p>
<p>Even though it was the lifestyle</p>
<p>I always wanted and I was traveling the world and I was seeing all the nicest shit eating the nicest dinners buying the nicest</p>
<p>clothes I just</p>
<p>That question will just get you okay, and I know how fucking painful it is and I&rsquo;m sorry that I had to say it to you</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna happen? Like it&rsquo;s gonna trigger you out of it. So now let&rsquo;s jump into what would Leo do?</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>So I have three situations that I found that I feel like will help people the most</p>
<p>From things that you guys submitted</p>
<p>So I have three situations that people are going through and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you</p>
<p>How I would handle it or what I would do in your shoes</p>
<p>So number one basically this guy was talking to another guy and</p>
<p>the guy he liked</p>
<p>Was becoming distant and like not wanting to hang out and he said to him</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not myself at the moment and I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be myself again</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s kind of like detaching and kind of like</p>
<p>pulling back and</p>
<p>In a situation like that. I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead and tell all you straight up</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve always needed to hear if</p>
<p>Someone tells you any reason why they cannot be with you. They simply do not like you enough</p>
<p>If you wanted to we would bitch. I know everybody gets mad about that, but it&rsquo;s the fucking truth like</p>
<p>Any reason not to talk to you or be with you or see you is a fucking excuse</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead and dead this issue right now. I&rsquo;m the most busy I&rsquo;ve ever been in my fucking life</p>
<p>Alright, I don&rsquo;t have time to fart barely bitch. Like I work on so much shit and I&rsquo;m run run run go go go</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so mentally occupied with everything and then also dealing with myself emotionally like I don&rsquo;t have time for a relationship</p>
<p>Like it would be such a fucking chore to get into one</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m choosing to be single and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been single the last two years</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m fucking good. Like I&rsquo;m driving all of my effort and energy into my fucking self and doing what I want to do in</p>
<p>the world</p>
<p>But if mr</p>
<p>Right came along and fell in my lap and just like crossed paths with me and I valued this person enough</p>
<p>You best believe I&rsquo;m gonna make it fucking work. I&rsquo;m gonna find time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put the effort into it because when you value something enough, you will fight to keep it</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll put the effort in to have it</p>
<p>So if someone is not putting effort into you, they don&rsquo;t want it bad enough</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want you bad enough and I don&rsquo;t say that to make you unsecure and think something&rsquo;s bad or wrong about you</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the fucking truth of the situation</p>
<p>People fight for what they value. Like I said, I don&rsquo;t have time to fucking breathe</p>
<p>But if mr</p>
<p>Right came along and I know my mr</p>
<p>Right how hard they are to come by like my standards bitch</p>
<p>Like I literally have a fucking scoreboard of all the qualities I want in a person</p>
<p>So if I found someone that finally met that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not letting them go like I&rsquo;m gonna fight for them. I&rsquo;m gonna find a way to keep them in my life</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do what I have to do. So someone that truly wants you will do that</p>
<p>So if someone gives you any reason or excuse of why they can&rsquo;t be with you</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>Got it. Wish you the best but bounce out because what the fuck is that?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not myself at the moment and I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be myself again</p>
<p>Does he just expect you to fucking sit there with your dick in your hand and fucking wait? No, fuck that</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t wait for nobody. We don&rsquo;t wait for shit. Choose yourself and get out choose yourself. Don&rsquo;t get pissed</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be petty. Don&rsquo;t be mean respect their decision</p>
<p>Give them the space that they want take the pressure off of them by making the decision for them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not open to having a conversation if they&rsquo;re saying oh, I don&rsquo;t feel like myself and I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be myself again</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not trying to have a conversation</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to get the pressure off of them because they don&rsquo;t want to hurt you</p>
<p>So give them that relieve them of that pressure by making the decision without them to not pursue them anymore</p>
<p>Now you can care about someone and still leave you can want something and still not choose it</p>
<p>And I promise you what you&rsquo;re gonna line up with</p>
<p>After you choose away from someone who does not value you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna forget about that motherfucker in two seconds</p>
<p>okay, so the next situation someone&rsquo;s dealing with this girl was talking to this guy and the guy basically said to her I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>Going through things and I&rsquo;m going through a lot, but you can&rsquo;t help me with it</p>
<p>So like the guy is not opening up</p>
<p>he won&rsquo;t allow her to help him with what he&rsquo;s going through and my first instinct is like I get the reaction of like</p>
<p>Okay, maybe he&rsquo;s kind of telling you</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want you in a polite way. Like I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m just a burning fucking bridge. You can&rsquo;t help me</p>
<p>Oh, just let me burn like he&rsquo;s just trying to like scoot out</p>
<p>but at the same time what I would do in that situation is</p>
<p>Give the person my presence and I would let them know that I&rsquo;m there for them</p>
<p>I would like the chance to be there for them. I would let them know that they don&rsquo;t have to face anything alone</p>
<p>So if things get too tough and you feel like you can&rsquo;t deal with it. I&rsquo;m always here</p>
<p>You never have to go through it alone. Just think about if you had a wall up</p>
<p>What would it take for someone to say or do for you to let the wall down and let them in?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your first attempt is</p>
<p>To give your presence to someone to give your support and let them know that you&rsquo;re there for them</p>
<p>Like make sure you see them in their situation. Just say what you can to make them feel seen and validated not judged</p>
<p>Not like anything they&rsquo;re feeling is stupid or doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>Like just try to understand them go at them with the attitude of understanding</p>
<p>But I would just assure them like you never have to face anything alone. I&rsquo;m here and</p>
<p>See where it goes from there</p>
<p>But if they give you some other bullshit excuse and completely push you out and like close you out of a situation and won&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>You in bounce out</p>
<p>Fuckin leave. Okay, cuz either it&rsquo;s an excuse not to be with you or there&rsquo;s someone that&rsquo;s never gonna let you in</p>
<p>So like I said</p>
<p>Look at what it would take for someone else to get your wall down and then do that for them and then see what happens</p>
<p>All right, before we jump into number three because I&rsquo;m gonna teach you how to manipulate people</p>
<p>I do want to say I have a donations page set up for this podcast</p>
<p>so if you enjoy it and you like it and you want to support it and help me keep going I&rsquo;ll put the link in</p>
<p>The description where you can donate and whoever donates the highest amount every week because my podcasts come out on Sunday</p>
<p>So between Sunday to Sunday whoever sends in the highest donation</p>
<p>Gets a free one-on-one zoom call with me for 50 minutes so we can run through any situation you have because that&rsquo;s what I do</p>
<p>For a living, but if you are interested in working on with me one-on-one</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave the link to my application in the description because I like to gather information about people</p>
<p>I like to see how people answer the application to see what like level they&rsquo;re at because I like people that can get deep and</p>
<p>People who are serious. So if you want to work one-on-one, I&rsquo;ve got you</p>
<p>Link is below also the donations page if you just want support</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s jump into number three</p>
<p>So this girl reached out to me and said basically her job is really stressful and her family&rsquo;s fucking awful</p>
<p>All right, and she lives with her family</p>
<p>But she can&rsquo;t move out because what she went to school with</p>
<p>She got a degree with something where like the beginning pay is like not enough to like support herself financially</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s having to live at home</p>
<p>but her parents are really hard on her and she&rsquo;s dealing with a lot of like hopelessness and</p>
<p>Feeling like not good enough and struggling and she&rsquo;s stressed financially. She&rsquo;s stressed about the future</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s dealing with all these emotions and all this shit</p>
<p>So my advice what I would do in your situation is to manipulate the fuck out of your parents</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna tell you the way that I would do it</p>
<p>So if you got a parent that&rsquo;s on your fucking ass</p>
<p>You gotta let them know that you&rsquo;re struggling and I don&rsquo;t mean go to them and whine</p>
<p>Cuz a lot of parents would like shut the fuck up quit complaining. Don&rsquo;t go to them like oh, I&rsquo;m just so upset</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dealing with all this like mom and dad what the fuck like don&rsquo;t say nothing like that</p>
<p>I want you to go to your parents or you can go to one of them one-off</p>
<p>I would do one off like go to your mom and be like mom</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;re at odds sometimes and I know we have our differences</p>
<p>but I really need some advice right now because I like I&rsquo;m really struggling with some shit and I don&rsquo;t know what to do and</p>
<p>I really want you to like</p>
<p>Help me like just tell me what you would do. Give me some advice</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do or who to go to that&rsquo;s step one</p>
<p>Because the bitch&rsquo;s guard is immediately gonna come down. Sorry. I don&rsquo;t mean to call you. I&rsquo;m a bitch</p>
<p>but people can&rsquo;t continue to attack you when you&rsquo;re already hurt people can&rsquo;t kick a</p>
<p>Puppy that&rsquo;s got like two legs</p>
<p>Like if you do you&rsquo;re a fucked up individual but like if someone knows something is already vulnerable</p>
<p>They typically don&rsquo;t attack it. They don&rsquo;t lash out at it. They don&rsquo;t like fuck with it, you know</p>
<p>so tell your mom what you&rsquo;re feeling like open up about like I</p>
<p>Picked this job and I kind of regret it like I went to school and I&rsquo;m not making enough money to support myself</p>
<p>Like I feel bad living here. I feel bad. Like I&rsquo;m putting pressure on you and dad</p>
<p>Let her know the guilt you feel let her know the hopelessness you feel let her know that you&rsquo;re so stressed and that you feel</p>
<p>bad because you know that you treat her a little weird sometimes and like</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just pulled in every direction you feel hopeless you feel lost you feel stuck let her know everything you&rsquo;re feeling and then say mom</p>
<p>What would you do in this situation? Like what like how do I like help myself? What do I do? And</p>
<p>that is gonna force your mom to fully climb into your perspective to be able to give you advice and</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s gonna get off your fucking ass quicker than you can even believe it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also gonna make her see that you feel some of the things that she feels and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not just gonna be looking at you like you have it all together anymore because typically when you have</p>
<p>Emotionally void parents, they just assume that you&rsquo;re strong and you&rsquo;ve got it all together</p>
<p>But when you let them see in and see that you&rsquo;re not like doing good drop your fucking ego for that one</p>
<p>All right, you&rsquo;re gonna have to I love a ego game</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s certain times to drop it</p>
<p>But the whole point of all this is to get your mom off your fucking ass to hopefully ease your living</p>
<p>Situation while you&rsquo;re in it get some of the pressure off have your mom be a little nicer</p>
<p>Because as soon as you can fix the relationships at home, it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot easier to be there</p>
<p>But like opening up like that and asking your mom for advice and then go to your dad separately and do the same thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna help them see that you&rsquo;re already like</p>
<p>Vulnerable and they&rsquo;ll most likely get off your ass and quit attacking you</p>
<p>But the way that I propose that makes them get into your perspective because you&rsquo;re not just going to them to complain</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking for advice. So they have to see where you are to give you advice that shit. You&rsquo;re good. You&rsquo;re golden</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be fine. It&rsquo;s gonna go so much better than you think but do not attack them</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make the situation about them and how they treat you and like how you don&rsquo;t like living at home</p>
<p>Make it about what you&rsquo;re feeling and what you&rsquo;re dealing with in your life</p>
<p>Trust me. So that&rsquo;s all I got for what would Leo do this week?</p>
