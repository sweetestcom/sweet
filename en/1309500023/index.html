<p>my name is bailey sarian and today is monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder mystery and makeup monday</p>
<p>if you are new here hi welcome you made it</p>
<p>every monday i sit down i talk</p>
<p>about a true</p>
<p>crime case that&rsquo;s been heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>and i also do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>it just kind of keeps me busy</p>
<p>if you are interested in true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup i</p>
<p>would definitely suggest you subscribe</p>
<p>thank you guys</p>
<p>so much for all of your support and your love</p>
<p>honestly you liking subscribing commenting disliking</p>
<p>not subscribing all</p>
<p>watching it means more</p>
<p>than you know</p>
<p>it is love you guys so much</p>
<p>other than that i will shut up</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s get into</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>crime case so</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>crime case takes</p>
<p>place in sydney australia and it&rsquo;s between the</p>
<p>nineteen eighty</p>
<p>to nineteen eighty five and this was like one of</p>
<p>their biggest</p>
<p>murder cases</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from australia you probably already know this one</p>
<p>but it was new to me i</p>
<p>never i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know about it</p>
<p>so let me explain the family</p>
<p>law act was passed in 1976</p>
<p>now this was</p>
<p>allowing divorce</p>
<p>to be seen by the federal government in australia</p>
<p>rather than</p>
<p>the supreme</p>
<p>court now the grounds of divorce became</p>
<p>less strict</p>
<p>after the law was passed so</p>
<p>prior to this law being passed the family</p>
<p>law court couples</p>
<p>they needed a reason</p>
<p>to file divorce</p>
<p>and it had to be like</p>
<p>a good reason</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t just file divorce because you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t in love anymore whatever</p>
<p>so some examples</p>
<p>would be like</p>
<p>insanity cruelty</p>
<p>and then the most common</p>
<p>would be adultery</p>
<p>and there is a lot more but</p>
<p>you just had to have a good reason to get a divorce</p>
<p>and when they opened this new court</p>
<p>i mean people came from</p>
<p>everywhere to get out of</p>
<p>their unhappy</p>
<p>marriages i mean</p>
<p>no longer did they have to</p>
<p>hire a private detective to</p>
<p>catch their partners committing</p>
<p>adultery or try to</p>
<p>prove that they were</p>
<p>in an abusive</p>
<p>relationship you just didn&rsquo;t have to really have</p>
<p>a reason as to why you were getting divorced it was</p>
<p>pretty cut and dry like i want out of this</p>
<p>marriage and all right</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good to go</p>
<p>so this is new right like</p>
<p>a lot of people are coming to get a divorce and</p>
<p>at this new family court</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>things aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily running</p>
<p>smoothly okay</p>
<p>family court it</p>
<p>could be like a pretty</p>
<p>messy or like</p>
<p>intense scene i mean some</p>
<p>women were there trying to get a restraining</p>
<p>order against</p>
<p>their abusive husbands or</p>
<p>they were just trying to get away from</p>
<p>their crappy partners the</p>
<p>courts itself it had really poor security and it was</p>
<p>really overcrowded because</p>
<p>people were coming in</p>
<p>there was just a lot of um</p>
<p>fights happening there was a lot</p>
<p>of frustration it wasn&rsquo;t like a safe</p>
<p>place yet and then on top of that the</p>
<p>courts also seemed to really</p>
<p>favor women</p>
<p>in custody battles</p>
<p>especially and then there were a lot</p>
<p>of upset fathers</p>
<p>and honestly looking</p>
<p>back even they acknowledge that yes they did tend to</p>
<p>favor the women</p>
<p>over men as far as like who had custody of the children</p>
<p>it just wasn&rsquo;t a very like equal</p>
<p>system at that time so people</p>
<p>would leave</p>
<p>their more upset</p>
<p>just really upset</p>
<p>so then in 1979</p>
<p>andrea blancard</p>
<p>and leonard</p>
<p>warwick went to the family</p>
<p>court to pretty much file for</p>
<p>divorce but also</p>
<p>determine custody of the children</p>
<p>so andrea met her husband</p>
<p>leonard on a</p>
<p>blind date in 1970</p>
<p>andrea was 18</p>
<p>at the time when she saw him it was love at</p>
<p>first sight you know</p>
<p>and they fell for each</p>
<p>other pretty</p>
<p>quickly which no</p>
<p>shame on that it happens</p>
<p>leonard and andrea they ended up</p>
<p>marrying in</p>
<p>october of 1974 he</p>
<p>leonard was</p>
<p>27 at the time and</p>
<p>andrea was 22 years old</p>
<p>for some reason i didn&rsquo;t get a backstory</p>
<p>on andrea i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna tell you a little bit</p>
<p>about leonard</p>
<p>so leonard was born</p>
<p>in helensburg australia</p>
<p>and sadly his mom passed away when</p>
<p>he was only six years old and this is obviously like a</p>
<p>devastating to the family</p>
<p>um he had a younger</p>
<p>sister who was a year younger than</p>
<p>than him she was five at the time</p>
<p>and she ended up moving in with</p>
<p>their aunt to get easier on</p>
<p>their father</p>
<p>because financial reasons like</p>
<p>it was just really hard on</p>
<p>their dad and then</p>
<p>leonard ended up</p>
<p>dropping out of</p>
<p>school at the age of 15</p>
<p>so he can help</p>
<p>raise some money so he</p>
<p>started working on a mushroom farm</p>
<p>and then when he was 18 he was</p>
<p>drafted and was forced to join the military and</p>
<p>leonard was not</p>
<p>happy about this like he was</p>
<p>and then he was discharged</p>
<p>about three years later</p>
<p>and then soon</p>
<p>after leaving the military he got a job</p>
<p>as a fireman</p>
<p>also that&rsquo;s when he met andrea</p>
<p>and they started dating and</p>
<p>they got married blah blah</p>
<p>blah not long</p>
<p>after unfortunately</p>
<p>a dark side</p>
<p>came out of</p>
<p>leonard and he</p>
<p>started to be very</p>
<p>possessive or jealous</p>
<p>and he was like this when they were dating</p>
<p>allegedly but when they got</p>
<p>married it became</p>
<p>very extreme so he was extremely controlling</p>
<p>possessive and abusive</p>
<p>towards andrea</p>
<p>leonard would show up to andrea&rsquo;s work pretty often</p>
<p>and unexpectedly</p>
<p>just to check up on her</p>
<p>he would tell andrea that she was not allowed to</p>
<p>speak to her family</p>
<p>or her friends</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t allowed to come over</p>
<p>she pretty much wasn&rsquo;t allowed to do anything</p>
<p>unless leonard</p>
<p>said she could</p>
<p>leonard was also very physically abusive towards andrea</p>
<p>and he would regularly</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t say that word</p>
<p>so then in 1975 andrea is just</p>
<p>ready to get away from</p>
<p>leonard and</p>
<p>she ends up moving out to live with her father</p>
<p>and while they were separated</p>
<p>leonard would show up at her father&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>he would try and</p>
<p>break in he</p>
<p>would try to</p>
<p>convince andrea to come back andrea decided</p>
<p>she needs to get a restraining order</p>
<p>against leonard</p>
<p>leonard would</p>
<p>start to threaten</p>
<p>andrea&rsquo;s father like saying that he was pretty much</p>
<p>gonna kill him</p>
<p>or wishing for him to die</p>
<p>and this really</p>
<p>worried andrea</p>
<p>and she didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>her dad to go through this and have to go through this</p>
<p>extra stress</p>
<p>and she carried a lot of</p>
<p>guilt because of this and therefore</p>
<p>andrea decided</p>
<p>to move back in with</p>
<p>leonard and she said she did it in</p>
<p>order to protect her father</p>
<p>and i just need to add this side note</p>
<p>because i wanna shut it down</p>
<p>because i know the comments are</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>how do i word this without being</p>
<p>awful hmm do not</p>
<p>leave comments saying well why did</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t she just</p>
<p>leave him if</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s physically abusive with her why didn&rsquo;t she just</p>
<p>leave why did she go back</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re shutting that down i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be deleting any of</p>
<p>those comments and i&rsquo;ll tell you why</p>
<p>if you have</p>
<p>never been in</p>
<p>an abusive or controlling relationship you have no idea</p>
<p>how it goes</p>
<p>okay when you are in this abusive</p>
<p>toxic relationship you do</p>
<p>things that you thought</p>
<p>that make no</p>
<p>sense okay you just</p>
<p>so brainwashed of</p>
<p>course from an outsider looking in it&rsquo;s easy to be like</p>
<p>watch just fucking leave</p>
<p>beating you</p>
<p>get out of there it&rsquo;s different when you&rsquo;re in it</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;ve experienced it no we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna blame her</p>
<p>because i know</p>
<p>those comments will come in and they</p>
<p>piss me off for me personally i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been in a physically abusive</p>
<p>relationship</p>
<p>but i have been in a very</p>
<p>possessive controlling</p>
<p>relationship and it was very toxic</p>
<p>and looking back i&rsquo;m like what was i doing what was i</p>
<p>thinking but in that moment i</p>
<p>truly felt like i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leave and it was like they had this</p>
<p>they have this</p>
<p>power over you</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s awful</p>
<p>and unless you&rsquo;ve been there</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make sense yes</p>
<p>to andrea she does go back to leonard</p>
<p>and then sometime passes</p>
<p>and andrea finds out that she</p>
<p>is pregnant and then that year</p>
<p>their daughter was born her name</p>
<p>is trudy and she was born in</p>
<p>june of 1978</p>
<p>so in 1979 finally andrea and</p>
<p>leonard they go to the family</p>
<p>court and they they try to file for divorce</p>
<p>andrea she files for custody of</p>
<p>treaty and this</p>
<p>heavily upset</p>
<p>leonard and when</p>
<p>leonard realized</p>
<p>that she was trying to get full custody of trudy</p>
<p>i mean this set him off and</p>
<p>daily he was harassing andrea</p>
<p>over the custody</p>
<p>battle he told andrea that he wanted trudy at all costs</p>
<p>the courts end up</p>
<p>granting andrea full custody of trudy</p>
<p>and they grant</p>
<p>visiting rights for</p>
<p>or to leonard</p>
<p>allowing leonard to see trudy at least</p>
<p>twice a week</p>
<p>and then he also had to pay like 20 dollars weekly for</p>
<p>child support and also he had to uphold the restraining</p>
<p>order that andrea had originally filed as well now</p>
<p>leonard over here he didn&rsquo;t give two shits nene</p>
<p>he just wanted his daughter</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>like this is a personal opinion that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>about to say okay</p>
<p>cause i don&rsquo;t know if he cared for his</p>
<p>daughter or not you know he</p>
<p>could love her</p>
<p>tremendously but i personally</p>
<p>think that he</p>
<p>only wanted trudy</p>
<p>because he knew it was</p>
<p>going to hurt andrea</p>
<p>and the only way to control her</p>
<p>would be to</p>
<p>get trudy or get custody of trudy</p>
<p>or just make her</p>
<p>andrea&rsquo;s life a living hell pretty much</p>
<p>anyway so leonard</p>
<p>would show up to</p>
<p>trudy school</p>
<p>and it wouldn&rsquo;t be on</p>
<p>visiting time</p>
<p>he would just show up whenever he wanted to and then</p>
<p>either take trudy</p>
<p>or like hang out with trudy when he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to</p>
<p>also during</p>
<p>the days when he</p>
<p>would be allowed to have trudy he</p>
<p>would keep her longer</p>
<p>than what he was supposed to or what he was allowed so</p>
<p>if it was two days then he</p>
<p>would keep trudy for four days or for a week</p>
<p>and on one occasion</p>
<p>it really worried andrea and she calls</p>
<p>leonard over and over</p>
<p>again trying to find out okay</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s trudy like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on you need to tell me</p>
<p>andrea didn&rsquo;t have a car at this time</p>
<p>so she couldn&rsquo;t just like</p>
<p>drive over there and see what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s calling calling calling and</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s not answering he&rsquo;s just being confused</p>
<p>shit so then andrea</p>
<p>she calls her brother his name is steven and he was</p>
<p>twenty five years old at this time</p>
<p>leonard has kept trudy like i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on i can&rsquo;t get a hold of anybody</p>
<p>can we take your car</p>
<p>and go over to his</p>
<p>house and get</p>
<p>trudy so of course</p>
<p>um her brother being supportive and</p>
<p>understanding he&rsquo;s been like seeing</p>
<p>her really go through all this he&rsquo;s like sure</p>
<p>no problem she also just liked the fact that like she</p>
<p>would have some kind of security when she goes over to</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>pick up trudy</p>
<p>you know if it was her by herself</p>
<p>leonard who knows what he</p>
<p>could pull steven takes</p>
<p>andrea down to</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s house and</p>
<p>steven goes up he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>knocking on the door</p>
<p>leonard answers and stevens</p>
<p>at the door and he&rsquo;s telling him like</p>
<p>hey man you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>treaty for way past your time steven</p>
<p>even goes on to say like we&rsquo;re not here to cause any</p>
<p>trouble i&rsquo;m not trying to</p>
<p>cause trouble</p>
<p>we just want</p>
<p>treaty back of course this is</p>
<p>irritating and</p>
<p>upsetting leonard</p>
<p>steven tried to</p>
<p>point out to</p>
<p>leonard that it just</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t look favorable in</p>
<p>court for him if he was breaching</p>
<p>the court orders</p>
<p>the piece of</p>
<p>crap that he is he pretty much just slams the door in</p>
<p>their face and refuses to give</p>
<p>over trudy steven</p>
<p>tried his best to just keep it as</p>
<p>calm and civil</p>
<p>as possible anyways andrea</p>
<p>went to the family</p>
<p>court and said</p>
<p>that leonard wasn&rsquo;t giving trudy back</p>
<p>they had to step in</p>
<p>and eventually i</p>
<p>think it was like a couple days later</p>
<p>trudy was returned to andrea</p>
<p>so february of</p>
<p>1980 stephen</p>
<p>andrea&rsquo;s brother so he finished his work for the</p>
<p>night and he headed over to his</p>
<p>girlfriend&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>just a visit before heading home</p>
<p>he lived with andrea trudy and</p>
<p>their father so they were all living together</p>
<p>their father at this time he was away</p>
<p>on vacation</p>
<p>and so at home it was just andrea trudy and</p>
<p>steven by the time steven had gotten home that</p>
<p>night it was pretty late</p>
<p>into the the</p>
<p>night like almost midnight he just kind of like quietly</p>
<p>snuck in and</p>
<p>and then he went into the back of the</p>
<p>house to his bedroom</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where he just fell asleep for the night</p>
<p>in the early</p>
<p>hours of the morning it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>believed to be anywhere from like 2 to 4 am somebody</p>
<p>breaks into the house</p>
<p>an intruder</p>
<p>breaks into the</p>
<p>house and then they silently</p>
<p>go into steven&rsquo;s bedroom</p>
<p>which was like towards the back of the</p>
<p>house which that</p>
<p>point everybody was</p>
<p>sound asleep in</p>
<p>the home and steven was</p>
<p>sound asleep as well</p>
<p>this intruder aimed</p>
<p>a point twenty two</p>
<p>caliber at steven</p>
<p>and shot him</p>
<p>the bullet entered just</p>
<p>above steven&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right eye and it killed him</p>
<p>instantly the</p>
<p>point 22 had a silencer</p>
<p>attached so andrea and trudy they didn&rsquo;t hear a damn</p>
<p>thing okay the</p>
<p>shooter then</p>
<p>wrapped a plastic bag around steven&rsquo;s head to</p>
<p>contain the</p>
<p>bleeding so it didn&rsquo;t make the like this fat mess and</p>
<p>leave a trail</p>
<p>they wrapped steven up in like his blankets</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>sleeping on</p>
<p>somehow quietly</p>
<p>carried steven out of the house and</p>
<p>so then the next day it was truti&rsquo;s</p>
<p>second birthday</p>
<p>or that same day if it was morning</p>
<p>it was truti&rsquo;s</p>
<p>second birthday</p>
<p>and andrea wakes up she</p>
<p>checks to see if steven was home but</p>
<p>when she saw he wasn&rsquo;t home she didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think twice</p>
<p>about it like i didn&rsquo;t really face her mostly</p>
<p>because steven</p>
<p>would stay the</p>
<p>night at his</p>
<p>girlfriend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house pretty often</p>
<p>and so when he wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal but</p>
<p>later that day the</p>
<p>phone rings and andrea answers it hello</p>
<p>and it was steven&rsquo;s boss asking</p>
<p>where steven was because he didn&rsquo;t show up for a</p>
<p>shift and at that</p>
<p>moment andrea was like instantly andrea said she was</p>
<p>worried and she had</p>
<p>that gut feeling that something was really really wrong</p>
<p>it was just very unlike him</p>
<p>to not show up for work but</p>
<p>like not let them know like it just wasn&rsquo;t like him</p>
<p>so andrea then goes like into his bedroom</p>
<p>and when she goes into his bedroom she finds</p>
<p>his wallet is on the bedside table</p>
<p>so andrea then</p>
<p>calls the police to file a missing persons report</p>
<p>and the police ask andrea is there anybody that would</p>
<p>wanna harm steven</p>
<p>and she didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think twice</p>
<p>she instantly told police</p>
<p>her ex husband</p>
<p>leonard now as the days passed</p>
<p>family the family and</p>
<p>friends of steven they were all looking for him there</p>
<p>was just no luck nobody was having any luck finding</p>
<p>him no one was having any luck finding any clues</p>
<p>nothing he just vanished</p>
<p>so then about a week</p>
<p>later a group of friends are boating jerusalem bay at</p>
<p>karen creek it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about 25 kilometers</p>
<p>north of sydney</p>
<p>this group of friends is out on their boat</p>
<p>and they see something</p>
<p>floating in the water</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>gosh anyways so the</p>
<p>group of friends</p>
<p>they thought that it was a mannequin at first</p>
<p>but then once</p>
<p>they got closer they realized that it was a human</p>
<p>body they call police and</p>
<p>as you should</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>police came out and they were able to retrieve</p>
<p>the male victim</p>
<p>and when they retrieved the male</p>
<p>victim out of the lake</p>
<p>there was a rope that was</p>
<p>tied around his midsection</p>
<p>11 bricks that were attached</p>
<p>chew the rope</p>
<p>and then there was another</p>
<p>piece of rope that was tied around his neck</p>
<p>with a garbage bag attached</p>
<p>also they see signs that the</p>
<p>victim had been</p>
<p>attacked by what was believed to be a bull</p>
<p>shark in the area</p>
<p>and they believed whoever</p>
<p>had placed the</p>
<p>victim in the area try to make sure</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t found by attaching</p>
<p>bricks to the body whoever did this thought it</p>
<p>would sink down and it</p>
<p>would stay down but</p>
<p>this person hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taken into consideration</p>
<p>that when he passed away the body</p>
<p>kind of like fills up with gases and you get bloated</p>
<p>and like full of gas</p>
<p>it brought him</p>
<p>to the surface of the</p>
<p>water like it was</p>
<p>stronger than the 11 brick</p>
<p>so later yes the victim was</p>
<p>identified to be</p>
<p>andrea&rsquo;s brother steven</p>
<p>and then a murder investigation was now</p>
<p>underway you know</p>
<p>when they look at steven&rsquo;s body they examine the rope</p>
<p>and they see</p>
<p>that this rope was a special</p>
<p>kind of rope a rope</p>
<p>that is only used and</p>
<p>issued to all</p>
<p>of the official firefighters</p>
<p>do you remember what i said</p>
<p>leonard does</p>
<p>well if you don&rsquo;t remember what i said</p>
<p>leonard worked</p>
<p>as a firefighter</p>
<p>so so when andrea</p>
<p>found out all this information she knew</p>
<p>it was leonard</p>
<p>leonard is brought in to be questioned by police</p>
<p>this is where</p>
<p>leonard got really difficult</p>
<p>so he petitioned his</p>
<p>right to silence and he refused to speak</p>
<p>he refused to</p>
<p>speak about</p>
<p>where he was the</p>
<p>night that steven was</p>
<p>murdered pretty much anything he just refused to speak</p>
<p>now remember</p>
<p>this is the 80s</p>
<p>and this is also australia so i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know how the laws work in general but back then from my</p>
<p>understanding you had to have physical evidence</p>
<p>to charge someone with a crime</p>
<p>the fireman&rsquo;s rope</p>
<p>links to leonard</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>firefighter but at the same time they don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>proof that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s rope do you see what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>so they really couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it</p>
<p>police they search</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s property</p>
<p>and the only</p>
<p>piece of evidence they</p>
<p>could find a</p>
<p>piece of paper and it has the word rope</p>
<p>written on it</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>any other evidence and because of that they</p>
<p>are unable to charge</p>
<p>leonard with anything there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a lot of names thrown at you throughout this</p>
<p>whole thing and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna try my best</p>
<p>to keep it simple we&rsquo;ll see how that goes enter judy</p>
<p>so judy is andrea</p>
<p>and steven&rsquo;s sister the</p>
<p>whole family is devastated by the loss of</p>
<p>their brother steven</p>
<p>but judy she ends up finding comfort</p>
<p>in a new religion</p>
<p>and she becomes a</p>
<p>member of the jehovah&rsquo;s witness</p>
<p>so she invites</p>
<p>andrea and trudy to join a few of</p>
<p>their meetings with her</p>
<p>and suggest</p>
<p>maybe they become members of the jehovah witness</p>
<p>as well like it&rsquo;s comforting</p>
<p>to have this</p>
<p>sense of community</p>
<p>especially in a time of</p>
<p>of loss now</p>
<p>that will be important</p>
<p>later so going back to the family law</p>
<p>court so the</p>
<p>judge who had first</p>
<p>heard and andrea and</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>is anyone&rsquo;s justice</p>
<p>david opus now correct me if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wrong australia but from my</p>
<p>understanding they use the word justice</p>
<p>in front of</p>
<p>their names when they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>a judge correct</p>
<p>so you know how we call people like judge judy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the only</p>
<p>judge i know but</p>
<p>they say justice</p>
<p>judy this guy his name was</p>
<p>justice david opus</p>
<p>he was the one who</p>
<p>first took care of andrea and leonard</p>
<p>their custody battle and divorce and</p>
<p>stuff like that so he was the one that</p>
<p>granted andrea</p>
<p>full custody</p>
<p>of trudy with only</p>
<p>visitation for leonard</p>
<p>now over time</p>
<p>leonard was just being a shithead</p>
<p>not following the law</p>
<p>and not even</p>
<p>listening to anything justice opus</p>
<p>was telling</p>
<p>leonard to do and</p>
<p>leonard had proven over and over again</p>
<p>that he was not</p>
<p>gonna obey court</p>
<p>orders like justice opus</p>
<p>he threatens to charge</p>
<p>leonard with contempt of</p>
<p>court and also</p>
<p>orders leonard&rsquo;s</p>
<p>visitations</p>
<p>stop until their next</p>
<p>court hearing as punishment because he&rsquo;s not file</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not um he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>wow i just had the biggest</p>
<p>brain fart that following the rules pretty much</p>
<p>so this pisses</p>
<p>leonard off</p>
<p>he wants his</p>
<p>daughter trudy and he even said</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s gonna get in his way</p>
<p>so then june of nineteen eighty</p>
<p>justice opus returns home from work</p>
<p>and this is just before like</p>
<p>seven pm he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about to sit down for dinner with his wife and two kids</p>
<p>and when he&rsquo;s like getting</p>
<p>ready to sit down the doorbell rings and</p>
<p>while getting up to go answer the door the fire</p>
<p>alarm from next door goes off so there&rsquo;s this loud like</p>
<p>hey hey hey</p>
<p>did you like my fire</p>
<p>alarm you know how fire</p>
<p>alarms are they&rsquo;re just loud and annoying</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s going off like it&rsquo;s really loud</p>
<p>so justice opus</p>
<p>he opens the</p>
<p>front door and instantly when he opens the front door</p>
<p>he is immediately shot by a point</p>
<p>twenty two the same gun that was used on steven</p>
<p>in the stomach</p>
<p>the noise of the shot it&rsquo;s not very noticeable</p>
<p>because of the loud fire</p>
<p>alarms coming from next door</p>
<p>but after a little bit of time his wife notices that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been at the front door for a while so i should</p>
<p>go check on him</p>
<p>so she goes over to the</p>
<p>front door and</p>
<p>he finds him on his back unresponsive so police</p>
<p>and ambulances have a</p>
<p>delayed response time due to another emergency</p>
<p>phone call of a</p>
<p>random bomb explosion</p>
<p>sadly justice opus was</p>
<p>investigation</p>
<p>starts right away and</p>
<p>since the family</p>
<p>court can be a place where</p>
<p>emotions run really high</p>
<p>and people are really pissed off all the time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for investigators to</p>
<p>narrow down who exactly</p>
<p>would do this</p>
<p>to justice opus a one hundred thousand dollar reward</p>
<p>is posted for information on his</p>
<p>death and people</p>
<p>start to think that</p>
<p>maybe the bomb explosion had been</p>
<p>intended to</p>
<p>a way to hold up emergency officials</p>
<p>in the first</p>
<p>place which is why it took so long to get to</p>
<p>justice opus&rsquo;s residence</p>
<p>so then investigators</p>
<p>they pretty much make up this list of</p>
<p>upset men that have been clients</p>
<p>of justice opus</p>
<p>and would rule</p>
<p>them out like one by one because a lot of them had</p>
<p>solid alibis</p>
<p>once they got to</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s name on the list</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like here&rsquo;s that name</p>
<p>again leonard</p>
<p>so immediately</p>
<p>investigators go over to</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s they get like</p>
<p>i think a warrant</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah and investigators they</p>
<p>search leonard&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>and they find</p>
<p>government toilet</p>
<p>paper in his property</p>
<p>which was taken from his work as a fireman</p>
<p>so they charged</p>
<p>leonard with theft so they can get his fingerprints</p>
<p>and this might not make a lot of</p>
<p>sense but they knew</p>
<p>leonard was</p>
<p>tied to what was going on</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t have physical evidence</p>
<p>to arrest him</p>
<p>right so when they were</p>
<p>going and they were</p>
<p>searching his house</p>
<p>they were like we just</p>
<p>gotta find something to arrest him</p>
<p>so we can get his fingerprints we can get him booked</p>
<p>and then hopefully get them to confess</p>
<p>right so that&rsquo;s what they did they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>searching his home</p>
<p>and they find something as simple as toilet</p>
<p>paper i&rsquo;ve also</p>
<p>heard it was towels</p>
<p>so one of those</p>
<p>or maybe neither</p>
<p>either way it was</p>
<p>taken from his</p>
<p>place of work</p>
<p>so when they saw that they were like okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it like we&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>book them on that and then we can get him in there so</p>
<p>they take him</p>
<p>on that and then they get his fingerprints and whatnot</p>
<p>and then once</p>
<p>again when leonard was being questioned</p>
<p>used to speak to investigators he maintained his</p>
<p>right to silence</p>
<p>he refused to answer questions</p>
<p>and his reasoning</p>
<p>was that because he didn&rsquo;t want to incriminate himself</p>
<p>there was no physical evidence to charge</p>
<p>leonard with</p>
<p>when they had leonard in</p>
<p>their custody</p>
<p>it was frustrating because they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get anything they couldn&rsquo;t get anything from him right</p>
<p>so they had no choice they had to let him go</p>
<p>which is like oh my god</p>
<p>is what i wanted to</p>
<p>scream now comes justice</p>
<p>richard gee</p>
<p>now he stepped in to take over</p>
<p>justice opus</p>
<p>wait what was the name</p>
<p>justice gee</p>
<p>was now responsible</p>
<p>for andrea and</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>in 1981 justice gi</p>
<p>ruled that andrea and</p>
<p>leonard their</p>
<p>house it needed to be sold</p>
<p>and that the</p>
<p>money would be</p>
<p>equally divided between the couple</p>
<p>at that time</p>
<p>leonard was living in it</p>
<p>not andrea so</p>
<p>this would mean</p>
<p>leonard would have to move out so of course this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>and then in 1983</p>
<p>justice gi pushes</p>
<p>again that the</p>
<p>house needs to be sold</p>
<p>and he enforces</p>
<p>lesser visitation</p>
<p>rights for leonard to see his daughter</p>
<p>of course once again</p>
<p>cycle begins</p>
<p>this pisses</p>
<p>leonard off and he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t comply</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not gonna move out and he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna see less of his</p>
<p>daughter so of course during</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s visitation he</p>
<p>would again</p>
<p>keep trudy for way too long</p>
<p>it was supposed to be</p>
<p>two days he</p>
<p>would keep her for four days</p>
<p>and it was this</p>
<p>constant just back and forth</p>
<p>and he was just making andrea&rsquo;s life a living hell and</p>
<p>poor trudy she was just in the middle of it i forgot</p>
<p>about her that</p>
<p>so sad course andrea then goes to the family</p>
<p>court to let them know that</p>
<p>leonard has</p>
<p>had trudy for far too long</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not giving her back</p>
<p>and justice key</p>
<p>he orders a warrant for police to take trudy from</p>
<p>leonard and</p>
<p>bring her back to her mother and</p>
<p>leonard was</p>
<p>upset this man ew</p>
<p>he just on the</p>
<p>night of april</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know the date</p>
<p>april 1984 it was late at</p>
<p>night and inside the family</p>
<p>court building</p>
<p>bomb went off destroying half of the building</p>
<p>it was believed that this bomb was supposed to</p>
<p>go off in the morning when it was filled with workers</p>
<p>but luckily it went off in the middle of the</p>
<p>night there was</p>
<p>like a janitor there i believe</p>
<p>but they were uninjured luckily</p>
<p>so this happens</p>
<p>and then soon</p>
<p>after justice</p>
<p>gee and his two sons are asleep at home</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about 1 30 in the morning</p>
<p>everyone is</p>
<p>sound asleep</p>
<p>and a bomb goes off in</p>
<p>front of his</p>
<p>house and it</p>
<p>completely destroys</p>
<p>justice keys</p>
<p>home now there</p>
<p>were reports saying if you were looking at the</p>
<p>house you couldn&rsquo;t even tell it was a house</p>
<p>and they thought there&rsquo;s no way anybody survived this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just no way</p>
<p>but luckily somehow</p>
<p>miraculously</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s killed</p>
<p>they have some serious injuries</p>
<p>but they were</p>
<p>alive and they were</p>
<p>going to be okay the children and justice</p>
<p>gee so justice</p>
<p>key was taken to the hospital</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where police meet up with him</p>
<p>and ask him a couple of questions</p>
<p>who could have done this</p>
<p>do they even need to ask just as</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t even hesitate and he&rsquo;s like leonard le</p>
<p>nerd so what</p>
<p>i know this is like so exhausting but it this is</p>
<p>like what the fuck</p>
<p>right that was my</p>
<p>responses the whole time</p>
<p>when i was reading this one i was like</p>
<p>what once again</p>
<p>leonard is the</p>
<p>prime suspect</p>
<p>he had no alibi</p>
<p>and when he was brought in for questioning</p>
<p>you guessed it he said nothing</p>
<p>he refused to answer any questions and police</p>
<p>could not find any evidence linking him to the</p>
<p>crimes nothing</p>
<p>we have a new</p>
<p>judge or justice</p>
<p>so his name is justice</p>
<p>watson he took over</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s and andrea&rsquo;s case the day</p>
<p>after justice geese</p>
<p>house was bombed</p>
<p>this new justice is</p>
<p>definitely reluctant</p>
<p>to take on this case</p>
<p>because of this ongoing pattern</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been happening there were</p>
<p>extra security measures</p>
<p>that were brought in to keep members safe and the cycle</p>
<p>started all over</p>
<p>again so justice watson</p>
<p>he also restricted</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s time with trudy this pissed</p>
<p>leonard off</p>
<p>leonard didn&rsquo;t want to listen to court</p>
<p>orders and he</p>
<p>would keep trudy he</p>
<p>would show up on his own terms and</p>
<p>it was just a mess</p>
<p>on the morning of july fourth nineteen eighty four</p>
<p>justice watson and his wife they were getting</p>
<p>ready for the day</p>
<p>leaving to go to work</p>
<p>and justice watson his wife</p>
<p>went to the</p>
<p>front door and she opened it</p>
<p>cause she&rsquo;s leaving</p>
<p>and as soon as she opened the door a bomb goes off</p>
<p>sadly his wife was killed instantly</p>
<p>and justice watson</p>
<p>he was injured with the</p>
<p>debris and he was</p>
<p>taken to the hospital</p>
<p>for his injuries</p>
<p>once again leonard was interviewed the same</p>
<p>night of the bombing and he just refused</p>
<p>to speak it&rsquo;s just exhausting</p>
<p>right i know</p>
<p>i know i couldn&rsquo;t believe this was a real story</p>
<p>anyways police investigators end up</p>
<p>searching his</p>
<p>house and the fire station</p>
<p>where he worked</p>
<p>they find no physical evidence</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t charge him</p>
<p>with anything because of that nothing the investigators</p>
<p>knew like dude</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s leonard</p>
<p>we have to figure this out but they can&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>all of the evidence</p>
<p>is circumstantial and it&rsquo;s not physical</p>
<p>and at this</p>
<p>point in the law in the 80s</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t arrest someone</p>
<p>based off of circumstantial evidence</p>
<p>it had to be hardcore</p>
<p>physical proof now</p>
<p>people are really reluctant to work for the family</p>
<p>court due to fears</p>
<p>legitimate fear</p>
<p>for their safety and</p>
<p>their family</p>
<p>safety there were employees</p>
<p>who were quitting because of what was going on</p>
<p>and then there were</p>
<p>also employees who just</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>showing up they were like working from home</p>
<p>or just like not coming in at all</p>
<p>do you blame em</p>
<p>and then this case pretty much turns into the biggest</p>
<p>and one of the longest cases in the history</p>
<p>of australia</p>
<p>so time goes on and in february of 1985</p>
<p>leonard goes to andrea&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>demanding to have trudy</p>
<p>leonard ends up getting physical with andrea</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying to take trudy away from her</p>
<p>i just had deja vu whoa</p>
<p>leonard gets physical with andrea and</p>
<p>tries to take trudy from her but</p>
<p>andrea was able to</p>
<p>get away from him and lock herself in their home</p>
<p>until leonard</p>
<p>finally left</p>
<p>why the police wasn&rsquo;t called i&rsquo;m not really</p>
<p>fully sure but at this</p>
<p>point andrea</p>
<p>realizes she just needs to get the hell out of</p>
<p>sydney for her</p>
<p>safety for her</p>
<p>daughter&rsquo;s safety</p>
<p>and for everybody else&rsquo;s safety</p>
<p>so andrea ends up calling her</p>
<p>sister judy</p>
<p>to help her pack and</p>
<p>leave now at this time andrea had</p>
<p>a new legal council</p>
<p>his name was gary watts and he</p>
<p>advised andrea to be more</p>
<p>harsh with leonard</p>
<p>he knew of the history</p>
<p>when leonard</p>
<p>found out who the new</p>
<p>legal counsel was well</p>
<p>guess who was the new target</p>
<p>i feel so bad because you know like no</p>
<p>one really wanted to work with andrea because of this</p>
<p>whole mess and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this poor girl gary watts the new</p>
<p>legal counsel</p>
<p>he recently had sold his property</p>
<p>and it was also</p>
<p>then being rented out to a man named pete</p>
<p>and his two siblings so</p>
<p>peter had gone outside to work on his car because</p>
<p>he had to take it in to get registered</p>
<p>you know how that goes</p>
<p>you need to like</p>
<p>fix it up so it passes</p>
<p>anyway so peter</p>
<p>lifts up the</p>
<p>the roof of his car</p>
<p>no not the roof what&rsquo;s it called hood</p>
<p>peter he lifts up the</p>
<p>hood of his car and he&rsquo;s kind of like fixing or tuning</p>
<p>things up and then</p>
<p>guess what he finds</p>
<p>he finds what looks to be a goddamn bomb</p>
<p>inside of the engine</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s like next to the engine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somewhere in there</p>
<p>peter got so lucky</p>
<p>the bomb it didn&rsquo;t go off but if the car was started</p>
<p>it would have gone off and he</p>
<p>would have he</p>
<p>would have died police were called</p>
<p>it at first seems kind of random</p>
<p>because this</p>
<p>peter guy he has like no</p>
<p>connection why</p>
<p>would he be a</p>
<p>target but they soon</p>
<p>realized or they put the</p>
<p>pieces together</p>
<p>that the address was listed</p>
<p>still as being gary&rsquo;s address</p>
<p>and it was like public information</p>
<p>because of that</p>
<p>leonard he must have</p>
<p>gotten the information assumed that that was his house</p>
<p>and went and put the bomb in his car</p>
<p>thinking it was gary&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>now this information</p>
<p>about the bomb it gets back to andrea who knows once</p>
<p>again it was</p>
<p>leonard and she&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s it we need to get out</p>
<p>asap so she calls her</p>
<p>sister judy judy</p>
<p>asked the jehovah</p>
<p>witness community</p>
<p>to help andrea and trudy</p>
<p>which they find somebody</p>
<p>who could rent out the home that andrea was staying at</p>
<p>so judy and friends from the jehovah&rsquo;s witness</p>
<p>community they help andrea move</p>
<p>quickly like out of sydney</p>
<p>and then at this time</p>
<p>andrea&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>counsel gary</p>
<p>gary watts the one</p>
<p>where the bomb was supposed to be at</p>
<p>he resigns for his own</p>
<p>safety so he steps away from helping andrea</p>
<p>so once again the</p>
<p>cycle repeats okay</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s home is searched</p>
<p>no physical evidence is</p>
<p>found also police investigators they question</p>
<p>leonard&rsquo;s co workers</p>
<p>and their co workers are like yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>standoffish</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s kind of mean</p>
<p>they tell investigators like he likes to hunt</p>
<p>and he likes pornography</p>
<p>but not much else that they</p>
<p>could tell him</p>
<p>so leonard tries to go get trudy</p>
<p>or something but he eventually</p>
<p>finds out that andrea and trudy they left</p>
<p>so when he finds</p>
<p>out that they&rsquo;re gone and they left the home</p>
<p>he loses his</p>
<p>shit so leonard is asking around like if anybody knows</p>
<p>their whereabouts</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>becoming more and more upset</p>
<p>leonard he knew that</p>
<p>andrea&rsquo;s sister judy was a</p>
<p>jehovah witness</p>
<p>and he calls the</p>
<p>congregation asking do you know</p>
<p>where andrea and trudy</p>
<p>are at or do you know where judy</p>
<p>is at do you know</p>
<p>where they moved to do you know what happened to them</p>
<p>most people</p>
<p>would deny and say that they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where they went</p>
<p>but one person told</p>
<p>leonard that they went up</p>
<p>north specify</p>
<p>where they went they just said that they went up north</p>
<p>so leonard is like</p>
<p>these people the jehovah&rsquo;s witness people they know</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re at and they&rsquo;re not telling me</p>
<p>it pisses them off</p>
<p>and so leonard has this</p>
<p>great idea he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>break into the jehovah&rsquo;s witness church</p>
<p>which i guess he was</p>
<p>gonna look for any type of information</p>
<p>paperwork he&rsquo;s looking for anything that will give him</p>
<p>an idea or a clue</p>
<p>or a location of</p>
<p>where trudy</p>
<p>and andrea are</p>
<p>the people who worked at the church came to the</p>
<p>congregation the next day</p>
<p>they see that somebody</p>
<p>broke in because there is a broken window</p>
<p>but also there was</p>
<p>blood on the window so there was a broken window</p>
<p>and whoever like</p>
<p>crawled through the window</p>
<p>cut themselves they left their</p>
<p>blood on the window</p>
<p>so police were</p>
<p>called and they kind of just thought it was</p>
<p>local homeless people</p>
<p>who broke in because nothing was</p>
<p>stolen or damaged or</p>
<p>besides the window but like there was nothing</p>
<p>else that was messed with anyways but police did take a</p>
<p>sample of the blood</p>
<p>that was on the window area</p>
<p>but at this</p>
<p>point dna testing wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>thing yet they</p>
<p>could test the</p>
<p>blood and find out what</p>
<p>blood type it was</p>
<p>but that was</p>
<p>about it a week</p>
<p>later that same</p>
<p>window was broken into and it was just assumed</p>
<p>that it was just</p>
<p>again hoodlums</p>
<p>because nothing was</p>
<p>stolen and nothing was really messed with</p>
<p>but that following day</p>
<p>okay this motherfucker</p>
<p>during a church service</p>
<p>at the jehovah</p>
<p>witness church or</p>
<p>congregation i&rsquo;m not sure if they call it church</p>
<p>either way a bomb explodes in the middle of service</p>
<p>many people were injured and</p>
<p>sadly one member was killed they were</p>
<p>lucky though that the bomb didn&rsquo;t make the</p>
<p>building cave in</p>
<p>instead it made the</p>
<p>building explode outwards</p>
<p>but it was completely destroyed immediately</p>
<p>leonard is the</p>
<p>prime suspect</p>
<p>at this point</p>
<p>judy andrea</p>
<p>they had moved out to forster i</p>
<p>guess i should have looked up</p>
<p>where that was</p>
<p>police ended up contacting judy and andrea</p>
<p>and they let them know like what had happened</p>
<p>and sadly judy</p>
<p>just really blamed herself she just felt really guilty</p>
<p>that she had</p>
<p>caused this</p>
<p>to her congregation</p>
<p>to her church to</p>
<p>her community</p>
<p>just really sad</p>
<p>and she tells police</p>
<p>fucking leonard like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry for laughing but</p>
<p>when police</p>
<p>are asking like do you have any idea who this</p>
<p>could be it&rsquo;s like you guys</p>
<p>fucking leonard</p>
<p>anyway so once</p>
<p>again fucking leonard</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s brought in</p>
<p>for an interview</p>
<p>and at this time he had a new girlfriend</p>
<p>and her name was lorraine</p>
<p>lorraine is</p>
<p>quoted as being</p>
<p>a rather low</p>
<p>class girl with</p>
<p>tattoos in a</p>
<p>rough manner and quote</p>
<p>i feel like this is a personal attack</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s also questioned and</p>
<p>lorraine is</p>
<p>kind of like a blabbermouth and she was like telling</p>
<p>police that</p>
<p>leonard was looking for entree</p>
<p>and trudy that he was getting really agitated and</p>
<p>annoyed and</p>
<p>leonard pretty much shuts it down and</p>
<p>he tells police</p>
<p>investigators he&rsquo;s not allowed to interview</p>
<p>her anymore she has a</p>
<p>right to silence</p>
<p>and he like shuts her up</p>
<p>which is unfortunate because it seems like she</p>
<p>they probably</p>
<p>could have got some information from her but damn</p>
<p>leonard he knew his rights</p>
<p>and again once they questioned</p>
<p>leonard they got</p>
<p>absolutely nothing from him</p>
<p>so at this point police</p>
<p>were like okay we need a different approach you guys</p>
<p>so they decide that they are</p>
<p>gonna give leonard</p>
<p>constant surveillance</p>
<p>undercover cops are just</p>
<p>gonna follow him they put a</p>
<p>tracking device</p>
<p>on his car they have these</p>
<p>undercover police officers</p>
<p>following leonard</p>
<p>everywhere but they&rsquo;re keeping</p>
<p>a distance trying to make sure that they&rsquo;re not caught</p>
<p>but because</p>
<p>leonard is leonard</p>
<p>he caught on</p>
<p>he knew that there were</p>
<p>undercover cops and he would</p>
<p>start doing like little</p>
<p>weird things</p>
<p>just to kind of</p>
<p>throw them off he</p>
<p>would just kind of drive in</p>
<p>circles leading them nowhere he would</p>
<p>load up his car with</p>
<p>stuff and then go back into the</p>
<p>house and it was just kind of messing with the</p>
<p>undercover police officers</p>
<p>he would also go up to them when they were sitting in</p>
<p>their car and he</p>
<p>would ask if they wanted like coffee or something</p>
<p>so he knew so at this</p>
<p>point andrea was exhausted</p>
<p>as i&rsquo;m sure any of us would be</p>
<p>and she felt like she was responsible for all of</p>
<p>these deaths</p>
<p>and she said you know what i&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>surrender custody of trudy</p>
<p>to leonard in hopes that the attacks</p>
<p>and the deaths and the murders</p>
<p>will end now at</p>
<p>first when i read this i was like wait</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna hand over your</p>
<p>child to this psycho man</p>
<p>if i were in her shoes</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what i</p>
<p>would do either i mean it seems like she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>everything you know and</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t yeah</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t blame her i</p>
<p>guess so ever</p>
<p>since andrea gave up custody of</p>
<p>treaty the bombings</p>
<p>and murders had stopped</p>
<p>and then according to andrea</p>
<p>trudy had lived with</p>
<p>leonard until</p>
<p>she was about 16</p>
<p>and leonard</p>
<p>remarried and the wife didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>along with trudy</p>
<p>and trudy then</p>
<p>moved out for trudy</p>
<p>i hope she&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>so due to lack of</p>
<p>sufficient evidence the case goes cold for</p>
<p>thirty years</p>
<p>a joke right i know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gotta tell me that twice</p>
<p>so the investigation continues and in</p>
<p>2012 detectives went through the case again</p>
<p>since the laws had changed</p>
<p>so they were</p>
<p>going through</p>
<p>their cold cases taking a look at them</p>
<p>again in 2015</p>
<p>leonard was finally</p>
<p>charged with</p>
<p>thirty two charges</p>
<p>four charges of murder were</p>
<p>amongst those</p>
<p>thirty two charger</p>
<p>charges at that time in</p>
<p>twenty fifteen</p>
<p>he was then</p>
<p>68 years old when he was arrested</p>
<p>investigators say that they discovered new evidence</p>
<p>with technology</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t around back then when the</p>
<p>crimes were committed</p>
<p>now they were able to get dna</p>
<p>from the blood evidence</p>
<p>that they got way back from the church window as of</p>
<p>right now july of 2019</p>
<p>a trial hasn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>taken place yet</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s just in prison</p>
<p>waiting for trial</p>
<p>leonard is now 72 he</p>
<p>was claiming that like his lawyer was</p>
<p>bullying him his</p>
<p>legal representative</p>
<p>decided to pull out and stop representing him</p>
<p>and then he didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>money to get someone to represent him</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t go to</p>
<p>trial if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have somebody representing you and it&rsquo;s just been this</p>
<p>whole like mess</p>
<p>also leonard</p>
<p>stands by the fact that he is not guilty</p>
<p>to these charges and he</p>
<p>stands by that</p>
<p>as far as what happened to trudy and andrea</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>guess trudy</p>
<p>got married</p>
<p>and she has children of her own andrea</p>
<p>poor andrea</p>
<p>they were just put through the most</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>where andre is at</p>
<p>i was kind of looking up</p>
<p>where trudy</p>
<p>was but i felt like you know this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want that shit</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>leave him alone</p>
<p>and that is the exhausting</p>
<p>story about leonard</p>
<p>and now the laws are different um</p>
<p>you can arrest somebody if there is</p>
<p>circumstantial evidence</p>
<p>of course more goes into that but it&rsquo;s not like it was</p>
<p>when this shit went down it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gotten better exhausting this man did so much damage</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>i just have to say this</p>
<p>if you or a</p>
<p>loved one are experiencing domestic abuse</p>
<p>you can get help</p>
<p>and you can get the f out of there</p>
<p>okay i know if you are</p>
<p>stuck in this</p>
<p>cycle it may seem like you are trapped</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t go anywhere</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have anywhere to go you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>money you don&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>that could help you get away</p>
<p>but i am going to list in the description box</p>
<p>where you can find help in your area</p>
<p>cause there are tons of programs</p>
<p>that you can go to</p>
<p>and programs that will help you find safe</p>
<p>places you can get out</p>
<p>so i guess we will see</p>
<p>what happens to</p>
<p>leonard i have a good feeling that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>found guilty</p>
<p>also really</p>
<p>quick if you</p>
<p>watched my toy box killer</p>
<p>video was about the toy box killer and elephant butte</p>
<p>truth or consequences t or c</p>
<p>anyways news came out the</p>
