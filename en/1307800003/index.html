    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language and the people who contributed to that history.</p>
<p>In the last episode, we looked at how a British judge in India helped to discover the oldest</p>
<p>known ancestor of English, the ancient Indo-European language.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;ll look more closely at the Indo-European family of languages and</p>
<p>how English fits into that family.</p>
<p>But before we look at the Indo-European language family in detail, let me emphasize the importance</p>
<p>of beginning a history of English with this ancient language, the language which eventually</p>
<p>led to English and most of the other European languages.</p>
<p>You might be surprised at how similar many of the words in the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language were to the words we use in modern English.</p>
<p>Now no one knows for certain how the original Indo-European words were pronounced, but some</p>
<p>of the words which have been reconstructed in this language appear to be very similar</p>
<p>to their modern English equivalents.</p>
<p>Oxen was Uxen.</p>
<p>Mother was Mater.</p>
<p>One was Oinos.</p>
<p>Six was Swex.</p>
<p>Seven was Septem.</p>
<p>Bear was Ber.</p>
<p>And Apple was Abel.</p>
<p>But this is about more than just some similar words.</p>
<p>A large portion of the base vocabulary of English came from this source.</p>
<p>But just as importantly, it&rsquo;s the parent language of not only English, but also Latin, Greek,</p>
<p>the Celtic languages, and all of the Germanic languages, including the Scandinavian languages.</p>
<p>In other words, all of the languages which have melded together to form modern English</p>
<p>derived from the same source language.</p>
<p>So, as we move forward in our look at the history of English, it helps to see how interconnected</p>
<p>these various influences are.</p>
<p>Ultimately, all of these languages are cousins, and they share a substantial amount of vocabulary.</p>
<p>About 50% of the world&rsquo;s population speaks an Indo-European language as their native</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about 3 billion native speakers of Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>So what about English?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s an Indo-European language, but it&rsquo;s a hybrid language that pulls words and</p>
<p>other influences from a variety of Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, English has at its core the original Germanic language known as Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>or Old English.</p>
<p>But it has lost a significant portion of the original Anglo-Saxon vocabulary and replaced</p>
<p>it with borrowed words.</p>
<p>Most of these sources of borrowed words are also Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>So, Indo-European roots find their way into English in many different and sometimes redundant</p>
<p>ways.</p>
<p>For example, you may recall in the last podcast episode that we talked about words like father</p>
<p>and foot and how their Latin equivalents pater and ped not only found their way into</p>
<p>English meaning essentially the same thing, but they also ultimately came from the same</p>
<p>original source word as the English words did.</p>
<p>Father and pater were once the same word, and foot and ped were once the same word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been estimated that almost 50% of the entire reconstructed vocabulary of the original</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans is represented in some form in modern English.</p>
<p>In other words, almost half of the known words of the original Indo-European language spoken</p>
<p>thousands of years ago can be found in English today.</p>
<p>They come in either as a direct inheritance from the Germanic languages or as words borrowed</p>
<p>from one of the other Indo-European languages like Latin or Greek or sometimes from both</p>
<p>as in the examples of father and foot.</p>
<p>In the last podcast episode, I talked about Sir William Jones, the British judge in India</p>
<p>who is credited with discovering the connections between many European languages and the Persian</p>
<p>and Sanskrit languages of Central Asia.</p>
<p>Jones basically recognized that these languages were related.</p>
<p>In other words, they were part of the same family of languages.</p>
<p>Many ventured some reasonable guesses about how these various languages were related,</p>
<p>but subsequent research has given us a much more complete understanding of how the languages</p>
<p>fit together.</p>
<p>We can now look at the whole family tree of Indo-European languages and see which branch</p>
<p>English belongs to, which, by the way, is the Germanic branch.</p>
<p>You can check out the family tree diagram at the website for this podcast, historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>Just click the link for episode 3.</p>
<p>So, at this point, I want to describe the family tree and introduce you to the Indo-European</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>This will serve as a helpful primer as we move forward.</p>
<p>And in the next few episodes, we will be looking at the specific languages within this family</p>
<p>which directly impacted the development of English.</p>
<p>Let me begin by noting that the family tree on the podcast website features 12 branches</p>
<p>of the Indo-European language family.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some other illustrations or diagrams use 10 or 11 branches.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a couple of reasons for this variation.</p>
<p>First, some linguists combine some of the branches into a single branch initially and</p>
<p>then separate them into separate branches later, while other linguists prefer to represent</p>
<p>each of these branches separately from the beginning.</p>
<p>For example, the languages of Eastern Europe are represented by two separate branches of</p>
<p>the family tree.</p>
<p>The Baltic languages include Lithuanian and Latvian.</p>
<p>The Slavic languages include Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech, Bulgarian, Bosnian, Croatian,</p>
<p>and Serbian.</p>
<p>All of these languages have some fundamental similarities, but they are typically divided</p>
<p>into separate Baltic and Slavic language families based on the similarities within those groupings.</p>
<p>But some Indo-European family trees will combine them into a common Balto-Slavic language group</p>
<p>initially and then separate them into separate groups after that point.</p>
<p>For our purposes, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, but it explains why the number of branches</p>
<p>can sometimes vary.</p>
<p>Some charts will also separate the Indian branches and the Iranian branches into separate</p>
<p>branches as well, even though the family tree which I use follows the more conventional</p>
<p>approach of grouping those together initially and then separating them.</p>
<p>There are reasons why linguists argue over whether some branches of the family tree should</p>
<p>be combined or not.</p>
<p>A lot of that debate concerns certain assumptions about the earliest speakers of those languages</p>
<p>and whether they initially represent a single tribe who spoke a common language, which later</p>
<p>divided into separate groups, or whether they were, in fact, separate groups all along.</p>
<p>Since none of those particular languages have any impact on the history of English, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to dwell on those debates here.</p>
<p>Also, another language group, known as Phrygian, is listed on the family tree on the website,</p>
<p>but some illustrations omit that language group altogether.</p>
<p>Frankly, so little is known about the language at this time that some linguists don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>include it at all.</p>
<p>Again, for our purposes, Phrygian had no significant impact on English, so I&rsquo;m not going to mention</p>
<p>it further.</p>
<p>I spent a large portion of the last podcast episode talking about Sanskrit and Persian,</p>
<p>so let me mention a couple of things about those languages before we move on to the other</p>
<p>languages in the Indo-European family tree.</p>
<p>Persian is part of the branch which is typically called the Iranian branch since it represents</p>
<p>languages which are native to modern-day Iran.</p>
<p>This includes the ancient Persian language spoken within the Persian Empire during the</p>
<p>times of the ancient Greeks and Romans.</p>
<p>It also includes most of the modern Iranian languages, including Farsi.</p>
<p>Remember that, despite the common religion, Iran is not an Arabic country.</p>
<p>Ethnically and linguistically, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Arabic is not an Indo-European language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Semitic language of the Middle East.</p>
<p>To the south and east of the Persian language family, we have the Indian language family,</p>
<p>which includes languages spoken primarily in northern and central India.</p>
<p>Of course, this includes Sanskrit, which we&rsquo;ve previously discussed, as well as modern Indian</p>
<p>languages like Hindi and Urdu.</p>
<p>The family tree also includes the Albanian language spoken in Albania.</p>
<p>Modern Albanian is the only language in that branch of the family tree.</p>
<p>Another branch of the tree which only contains one language is Armenian.</p>
<p>It contains the modern Armenian language which is spoken in Armenia, which is located south</p>
<p>of the Caucasus Mountains between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>There are two other branches which represent languages which are long extinct as actively</p>
<p>spoken languages.</p>
<p>The Hittites of modern Turkey are mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible.</p>
<p>In the early 1900s, a set of cuneiform inscriptions from the Hittite Empire were discovered and</p>
<p>deciphered.</p>
<p>It turned out, much to the surprise of many linguists, that the Hittite language was in</p>
<p>fact an Indo-European language.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, the oldest attested Indo-European language.</p>
<p>Another long extinct Indo-European language was also discovered in the early 1900s in</p>
<p>the deserts of the Xinjiang region in northwestern China.</p>
<p>Several manuscripts were discovered by archaeologists in that region.</p>
<p>They were translated and once again, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the language was an Indo-European</p>
<p>language spoken in the second millennium B.C.</p>
<p>The area in which the manuscripts were found lies upon the Silk Road, which connected East</p>
<p>Asia with Central Asia, the Near East, and Europe.</p>
<p>This is the easternmost discovered Indo-European language and probably represents an early</p>
<p>Indo-European speaking group from Eurasia which migrated along the Silk Road and eventually</p>
<p>settled in northwestern China.</p>
<p>That leaves four remaining branches of the Indo-European family.</p>
<p>The Hellenic or Greek branch, the Italic branch, which includes Latin, the Celtic branch,</p>
<p>and the Germanic branch.</p>
<p>Those four language groups represent the Indo-European languages spoken in Western Europe and, consequently,</p>
<p>the four branches which directly impacted the history of English.</p>
<p>So these four language groups will be the focus of much of the first volume of the podcast.</p>
<p>The Hellenic branch represents Greek from its earliest form spoken in Mycenaean Greece</p>
<p>at least by 1600 B.C., if not earlier.</p>
<p>It also includes the various regional Greek dialects of the Classical Greek period and</p>
<p>the modern Greek language spoken in Greece today.</p>
<p>Greek has had a major impact on English.</p>
<p>Some Greek words came directly into English, but most of the Greek words in English came</p>
<p>into English via Latin.</p>
<p>As you probably know, the Romans were heavily influenced by Greek culture and they adopted</p>
<p>a tremendous number of Greek words.</p>
<p>As we will see shortly, the Latin language has consistently influenced English and its</p>
<p>predecessors since the time of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>As a result, many English words can be traced back to ancient Greece.</p>
<p>The Greeks also borrowed an alphabet from the Phoenicians, which is the same basic alphabet</p>
<p>we use today, again as modified by the Romans.</p>
<p>The Italic branch represents the languages spoken in Italy after various Indo-European</p>
<p>speaking tribes settled there.</p>
<p>Over time, the Latin dialect spoken in Rome won out as the Roman Empire came to dominate</p>
<p>Italy and eventually the entire Mediterranean and Western Europe.</p>
<p>Over time, Latin became a dead language in the sense that people stopped speaking it</p>
<p>as their native or first language, though it continued to be studied and learned as</p>
<p>the language of the church and later as a language of science and academia.</p>
<p>The original Latin language fractured into various regional dialects, and those dialects</p>
<p>evolved into the modern languages we know today as the Romance languages—French, Italian,</p>
<p>Spanish, Portuguese, and a few others.</p>
<p>So all of those languages also belong to the Italic branch, even though most of them are</p>
<p>not spoken in Italy, except, of course, as learned languages.</p>
<p>By the way, many people are under the impression that these Latin-derived languages are called</p>
<p>Romance languages because they sound romantic when they&rsquo;re spoken, and they may very well</p>
<p>sound romantic, but that&rsquo;s not why they&rsquo;re called Romance languages.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called that because they are spoken in areas that were once Roman and thus spoke</p>
<p>Latin.</p>
<p>But the word Romance or Romantic actually comes from the French word for Roman as well.</p>
<p>The term originally described a type of French literature which involved themes of chivalry.</p>
<p>The term eventually came to refer to French literature involving a love story.</p>
<p>So Rome is the root of Romance in its conventional sense and in its use to describe Latin-based</p>
<p>languages in Europe.</p>
<p>Now Latin is the biggest influence on English outside of English&rsquo;s native Germanic language</p>
<p>family.</p>
<p>Estimates are that as many as one quarter of the words in a full-sized Latin dictionary</p>
<p>have made their way into English in some form.</p>
<p>Latin words have found their way into English almost without interruption since English</p>
<p>was a discernible language, and even before that.</p>
<p>First, during the time of the Roman Empire, before English was English, when the ancestors</p>
<p>of the earliest Anglo-Saxons were still living among other Germanic tribes in northern Europe,</p>
<p>Latin was seeping into these early Germanic languages.</p>
<p>The Romans traded with the Germanic tribes, they regularly employed them as mercenaries</p>
<p>in the Roman army, and several Germanic tribes became protectorates of the Roman Empire living</p>
<p>within the empire, and some of them eventually became Roman citizens.</p>
<p>Of course, southern Britain was also part of the Roman Empire for about four centuries,</p>
<p>so Latin was being spoken in Britain among many of the native Romanized Britons when</p>
<p>the Anglo-Saxons arrived in the fifth century.</p>
<p>These Latin influences impacted English after the Anglo-Saxons arrived in Britain.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, the church centered in Rome expanded throughout Western Europe and</p>
<p>into Britain itself.</p>
<p>From the early Middle Ages until the Renaissance, the church was the dominant unifying factor</p>
<p>in Western Europe, not only religiously, but also politically, socially, and culturally.</p>
<p>For much of this period, most of the literacy in Western Europe was confined to the church</p>
<p>monks.</p>
<p>Latin was also a lingua franca which enabled travelers throughout Western Europe to communicate</p>
<p>in something close to a common language.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Latin continued to seep into English during this period as well.</p>
<p>Of course, in 1066, the biggest impact of all occurred when the Norman French invaded</p>
<p>and conquered England under William the Conqueror.</p>
<p>As I said, French is a Romance language, having evolved from the original Latin spoken by</p>
<p>the Romans, so the massive number of French words which entered English after the Norman</p>
<p>invasion resulted in one of the biggest deposits of Latin words into English.</p>
<p>Even as late as the Renaissance and thereafter, Latin continued to influence English as the</p>
<p>language of scholarship, science, and medicine.</p>
<p>The net result of all of the Latin influence on English is that we have a language today</p>
<p>that is really a blended language, with the two biggest influences being the Germanic</p>
<p>languages and Latin.</p>
<p>You can think of English in its most basic terms as a blend of these two language groups.</p>
<p>English is not a Romance language, but it bears certain similarities to those languages</p>
<p>due to the massive borrowing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever studied French, Spanish, Italian, or another Romance language, you will constantly</p>
<p>notice similarities in vocabulary between English and the Romance words.</p>
<p>Some of these similarities are due to their common Indo-European roots, but most of it</p>
<p>is a result of borrowing.</p>
<p>Some linguists think of English as a massive oak tree.</p>
<p>The roots and trunk of the tree are the original Germanic Anglo-Saxon words.</p>
<p>These are the core words of the language.</p>
<p>While they&rsquo;re relatively few in number compared to the non-Germanic words which have been</p>
<p>borrowed into English, they are the ones we use the most in day-to-day speech.</p>
<p>Many of the first words that small children learn to speak and later read and write in</p>
<p>English are Germanic words.</p>
<p>Numbers, body parts, family relations, basic verbs, and pronouns.</p>
<p>These words represent the core vocabulary of English.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why those words don&rsquo;t change very much from one generation to the next.</p>
<p>You learn them early on, and you use them every day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why they represent the roots and the trunk of the tree.</p>
<p>They hold up the tree, and they rarely change.</p>
<p>But all of the limbs, branches, and leaves of that oak tree represent the borrowed words.</p>
<p>And most of those limbs, branches, and leaves are from Latin.</p>
<p>They give the tree its shape and color.</p>
<p>They fill up a dictionary.</p>
<p>If you flip through an English dictionary, you&rsquo;ll see many words that you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and many that you recognize but hardly ever use.</p>
<p>Most of those words are the Latin and other borrowed words.</p>
<p>We have them at our disposal if we need them, but we really tend to use them to supplement</p>
<p>our core vocabulary, which is very small by comparison and dominated by Germanic terms.</p>
<p>To give you some actual numbers to illustrate this point, let me read to you the most commonly</p>
<p>used words in the English language.</p>
<p>This is my top 25 list.</p>
<p>These are the top 25 most commonly used words in the English language in order from number</p>
<p>1 to 25.</p>
<p>I, the, and, a, to, is, you, that, it, he, of, in, was, for, on, are, as, with, his,</p>
<p>they, at, be, this, have, and from.</p>
<p>All 25 of those words are from Germanic origins, either Old English or other Germanic languages</p>
<p>which have worked their way into Modern English.</p>
<p>None of those come from any other source.</p>
<p>Now let me read you the next 25.</p>
<p>These are numbers 26 through 50.</p>
<p>or, won, had, by, word, but, not, what, all, were, we, when, your, can, said, dare, use.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>At number 42 on our list, the word use is the first non-Germanic word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually an Old French word that came into English and that&rsquo;s the first word on</p>
<p>the list that is of a non-Germanic origin.</p>
<p>But then if we pick up with the next word at number 43, we have an, each, which, she,</p>
<p>do, how, their, and if.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the remainder of the second group of 25 words.</p>
<p>So out of the top 50 words, we only have one word that is not from the Germanic language</p>
<p>family.</p>
<p>And if we continued this out, we would basically see the same thing.</p>
<p>Out of the 200 most commonly used words in English, 183 of them come from the Germanic</p>
<p>language family.</p>
<p>Only a small handful come from other language families.</p>
<p>And again, most of those come from Latin.</p>
<p>Yet, here&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>When the entire vocabulary of English is taken into account, when one looks at an entire</p>
<p>English dictionary, for example, the Anglo-Saxon words represent a tiny fraction of the total.</p>
<p>They are very few, but they represent the core of the vocabulary.</p>
<p>They are the words we use most often.</p>
<p>So again, the Anglo-Saxon words are the roots and the trunk of our oak tree, using the analogy</p>
<p>I gave, while the other languages, especially Latin, represent the branches and leaves.</p>
<p>And keep that oak tree analogy in the back of your mind as we discuss Latin and the Germanic</p>
<p>languages throughout the podcast series.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two language groups, the Celtic and the Germanic.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, before the Romans expanded into Europe, the Celtic languages dominated</p>
<p>much of Europe and were spoken throughout Britain when the Anglo-Saxons arrived.</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re still spoken in much of the British Isles outside of England.</p>
<p>This includes modern Irish, Welsh, and Gaelic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Celtic languages in many of these areas are slowly dying out, with</p>
<p>fewer and fewer speakers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also one area outside of the British Isles where Celtic languages are spoken today,</p>
<p>in the French province of Brittany in northwestern France.</p>
<p>The Celtic language spoken there is called Breton.</p>
<p>The Celtic ancestors of modern Brittany actually came from Britain.</p>
<p>As the Anglo-Saxons poured into Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries, many native Celts</p>
<p>moved northward into Scotland and westward into Wales, but some fled southward out of</p>
<p>Britain and across the English Channel into northwestern France, where they helped to</p>
<p>found Brittany.</p>
<p>Today, when we think of Celtic culture, we typically think of places like Scotland, Ireland,</p>
<p>and Wales, but these are merely the modern remnants of a culture that once dominated</p>
<p>most of Europe.</p>
<p>In fact, the ancient Celts were the first Iron Age people of Europe, and they are often</p>
<p>called the first masters of Europe.</p>
<p>The extent to which we can think of all of these Celtic-speaking people who emerged in</p>
<p>central Europe around 800 B.C. as a specific group of people is the subject of ongoing</p>
<p>debate among historians.</p>
<p>But these people who we call Celts did share certain cultural characteristics, most notably</p>
<p>a common language or a common group of languages.</p>
<p>But the ultimate story of the Celts in continental Europe is the story of being caught between</p>
<p>a rock and a hard place.</p>
<p>To the south in Italy and the Mediterranean was the Roman Empire, with intentions of expanding</p>
<p>northward.</p>
<p>To the north in Scandinavia were the Germanic tribes, with intentions of expanding southward.</p>
<p>The Celts occupied the vast expanse of Europe in between.</p>
<p>Over time the Celts would be caught in between these expanding forces, and by the second</p>
<p>century A.D. they were completely overtaken by the Latin-speaking Romans and the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>And by the sixth century they were overtaken in the area we would come to know as England</p>
<p>by another group of Germanic tribes, the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>Since the Anglo-Saxons emerged as the conquerors, they borrowed very little from the defeated</p>
<p>Celts.</p>
<p>This included the Celtic language, which had some but relatively little impact on modern</p>
<p>English.</p>
<p>That leaves us with the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons, the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned, English is part of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family</p>
<p>tree.</p>
<p>When we say English is a Germanic language, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t mean English came from German.</p>
<p>Modern German and English each evolved separately from an ancient common shared language, which</p>
<p>linguists call Proto-Germanic.</p>
<p>In that sense, English and German are related, you might say cousins, within a larger Germanic</p>
<p>family of languages.</p>
<p>Other modern languages within that larger Germanic family include Dutch, Danish, Swedish,</p>
<p>and Norwegian.</p>
<p>The Germanic language family began with a group of early Germanic speakers in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Over time, they migrated southward into the heart of continental Europe.</p>
<p>Early on, these tribes divided into three distinct groups, which are represented by</p>
<p>the three branches of the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>The tribes who remained in Scandinavia are known as the Northern tribes, and their language</p>
<p>developed into Old Norse, the language of the Vikings, and eventually into modern Danish,</p>
<p>Swedish, Norwegian, and Icelandic.</p>
<p>The tribes which moved southward divided into two separate groups.</p>
<p>One group moved eastward into Eastern Europe, and these linguistic groups are known as the</p>
<p>East Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>These dialects eventually died out as these tribes became assimilated into other tribes</p>
<p>and territories.</p>
<p>The most notable of these tribes were the Goths, who played a large role in the fall</p>
<p>of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>While some Germanic tribes migrated southeastward into Eastern Europe, others migrated southward</p>
<p>and westward into the areas of modern Germany and eventually modern France.</p>
<p>These tribes are known as the West Germanic tribes, and this is where we find English,</p>
<p>as well as modern German.</p>
<p>The western branch of the Germanic family tree is often subdivided into two separate</p>
<p>groups, High German and Low German.</p>
<p>Now high and low refers to the altitude, which can be easily confused.</p>
<p>The southern part of Germany is mountainous, so the southern part represents High German.</p>
<p>As you move north towards the North Sea in the Baltic Sea, the elevation drops to sea</p>
<p>level and this represents the area of Low German.</p>
<p>So High German is in the south and Low German is in the north.</p>
<p>The modern standard German language is spoken within the higher elevations and is considered</p>
<p>part of High German.</p>
<p>This also includes Bavarian and Austrian.</p>
<p>However, there are also German dialects spoken closer to the coast, as I mentioned.</p>
<p>So Low German includes these German dialects as well, which are usually just called the</p>
<p>Low German dialects.</p>
<p>Low German also includes Dutch and Flemish, which are spoken in the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s focus more closely on the Low German dialects because that&rsquo;s also where we find</p>
<p>English.</p>
<p>This is our little family within the larger Germanic family and within the much larger</p>
<p>Indo-European family.</p>
<p>Again, the Low German territory includes the modern Netherlands, the coastal lowlands of</p>
<p>northern Germany, and parts of Denmark.</p>
<p>By the 2nd or 3rd century AD, there were a variety of Germanic tribes in these regions.</p>
<p>The most prominent of these tribes were the Saxons, Angles, Jutes, and Frisians.</p>
<p>All of these tribes participated in the general migration to Britain beginning in the 5th</p>
<p>century.</p>
<p>But we know these groups today as the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>The Jutes and Frisians represented a smaller portion of the total number of immigrants.</p>
<p>Since they didn&rsquo;t get their names in the label Anglo-Saxon, we tend to ignore them, but they</p>
<p>were definitely included.</p>
<p>The Jutes lived in modern Denmark in the peninsula we still know today as Jutland, which basically</p>
<p>means land of the Jutes.</p>
<p>The Jutes primarily settled in eastern England in the area known as Kent.</p>
<p>The Frisians lived along the North Sea coast from part of the modern Netherlands northward</p>
<p>along the German coast.</p>
<p>And if you look at a map, you will notice that the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes lived east</p>
<p>of Frisia, and Britain is across the North Sea to the west.</p>
<p>In the process of migrating to the west to Britain, the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes would</p>
<p>have passed through Frisia.</p>
<p>In the process, some of those Frisians joined in the migration, but they did not represent</p>
<p>enough people to carve out their own distinct territory in Britain like the Angles, Saxons,</p>
<p>and Jutes.</p>
<p>Now Frisian territory still exists in the Netherlands and northern Germany, and a modern</p>
<p>Frisian language is still spoken there and in parts of coastal Denmark.</p>
<p>In fact, if German is a cousin of English, Frisian is probably the closest thing we have</p>
<p>to a sibling of English.</p>
<p>In fact, there are remarkable similarities between Frisian and Old English.</p>
<p>A common poem reads, Bread, butter, and green cheese is good English and good Frieze.</p>
<p>This phrase is read almost identically in English and Frisian.</p>
<p>Dutch speakers would pronounce bread, butter, and cheese quite differently, but the Frisian</p>
<p>pronunciation is very close to English, and so the phrase is literally true.</p>
<p>The circumstances which led to the migration of the Low German tribes to Britain beginning</p>
<p>in the 5th century will be covered in an upcoming episode of the podcast on the Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>migrations and the development of Old English.</p>
<p>But for now, we&rsquo;ll just note that these tribes settled in southern Britain.</p>
<p>The Jutes established a territory in the east, which is modern Kent.</p>
<p>The Angles tended to settle in the northern part of this territory in central Britain,</p>
<p>and the Saxons settled in the south.</p>
<p>The Saxons in the east were known as the East Saxons, and their territory eventually</p>
<p>became known as Essex from East Saxons.</p>
<p>The Saxons in the middle were known as the South Saxons, and their territory became known</p>
<p>as Sussex from South Saxons.</p>
<p>In the west, the Saxons were called the West Saxons, and their territory was called Wessex</p>
<p>from West Saxons.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s here that we can finally pinpoint Old English.</p>
<p>Remember that at this early stage there were still regional variations among these tribal</p>
<p>groups, but most of their territory would eventually fall to Viking invaders a couple</p>
<p>of centuries later.</p>
<p>It was only the West Saxons, under their leader Alfred, known as Alfred the Great, that were</p>
<p>able to withstand the Viking invasions.</p>
<p>They eventually fought back and preserved the culture and the language of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>Since they emerged as the dominant territory in the aftermath of the Viking disruptions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s their dialect, the West Saxon dialect, that would come to be used in most Old English</p>
<p>documents.</p>
<p>And there you have it, English within the Indo-European family of languages.</p>
<p>You will probably have noticed by this point that all of the major European languages are</p>
<p>included within the Indo-European family.</p>
<p>However, there are a few European languages which are not considered Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>This includes Finnish in Finland, Estonian in Estonia, Saman in northern Scandinavia,</p>
<p>and Hungarian, also known as Magyar, in Hungary, all of which are considered part of a separate</p>
<p>language family known as Uralic.</p>
<p>The Basque language, spoken in northern Spain, is also a unique language with no ties to</p>
<p>the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And the modern Turkish languages also represent a separate family of languages.</p>
<p>But with these few exceptions, all of the other languages of Europe are descended from</p>
<p>the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>So what about that original Indo-European language?</p>
<p>Where was it spoken?</p>
<p>When was it spoken?</p>
<p>And who were the people who spoke it?</p>
<p>In the next episode of the podcast, we&rsquo;ll look at how linguists have actually been able</p>
<p>to reconstruct significant portions of this ancient language.</p>
<p>And one of the key figures in this process was a collector of fairy tales, one of the</p>
<p>famous Brothers Grimm.</p>
<p>So next time, we&rsquo;ll explore Grimm&rsquo;s Law and look at how the Germanic languages, including</p>
<p>English, have changed over time.</p>
<p>And with this knowledge, we&rsquo;ll see how Grimm&rsquo;s Law allows us to reconstruct a significant</p>
<p>portion of that original Indo-European language and, in the process, see many of the original</p>
<p>sources of modern English words and grammar.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
