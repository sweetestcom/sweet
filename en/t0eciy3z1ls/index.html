<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>hey guys I have a great special guest</p>
<p>today Jason Fong who is uh you all know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s very famous on YouTube and he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>nephrologist a kidney specialist and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re here to ask her ask a</p>
<p>lot of questions and get a lot of great</p>
<p>updates he wrote two bestsellers one is</p>
<p>the obesity code and the complete guide</p>
<p>to fasting and he wrote a new one I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s called the diabetes code</p>
<p>right right I&rsquo;m just digging through</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like incredible information I</p>
<p>want to start just by talking about some</p>
<p>basic things like what is the cause of</p>
<p>obesity I know you talked about that</p>
<p>many times but yeah and it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>important question and one that really</p>
<p>gets to the heart of how you treat it so</p>
<p>essentially the cause of obesity is a</p>
<p>hormonal issue and there&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>hormones but the two main ones are</p>
<p>insulin and cortisol to a lesser extent</p>
<p>but the main one is the insulin and a</p>
<p>lot of people get certain of caught on</p>
<p>the minutia but if you looked at it from</p>
<p>a scientific standpoint the only thing</p>
<p>you need to know is that if insulin is</p>
<p>what causes weight gain then we should</p>
<p>be able to give people insulin and make</p>
<p>them gain weight and it turns out that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly what happens so whenever we</p>
<p>prescribe insulin people gain weight if</p>
<p>people have an insulinoma which is a a</p>
<p>tumor that secretes too much insulin</p>
<p>they gain weight if you give medications</p>
<p>that raise insulin such as so far non</p>
<p>ureas they gain weight when you the</p>
<p>other part of the sort of causal</p>
<p>relationship is that if you take away</p>
<p>insulin they should lose weight so again</p>
<p>this is exactly what you see so in type</p>
<p>1 diabetes for example where you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>produce any insulin you lose weight when</p>
<p>people type 1 diabetics are taking</p>
<p>insulin and they want to lose weight</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called diet bulimia</p>
<p>where they actually stopped taking their</p>
<p>insulin and they lose weight if you keep</p>
<p>taking one of the newer medications</p>
<p>called the sglt2 they also make insulin</p>
<p>go down and you lose weight so every</p>
<p>time you</p>
<p>you came late every time you lower than</p>
<p>you gain weight you can do the same</p>
<p>exercise for cortisol but it tends not</p>
<p>to be as important so again you can get</p>
<p>prednisone and make people gain weight</p>
<p>you can take away prednisone such as the</p>
<p>disease called Addison&rsquo;s disease and</p>
<p>people will lose weight so you know that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a causal relationship here so if</p>
<p>insulin is the main problem then you</p>
<p>need to focus on lowering insulin</p>
<p>because if insulin it makes you gain</p>
<p>weight you need to lower insulin</p>
<p>the problem is that we don&rsquo;t focus on</p>
<p>that we focus on calories instead and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an overlap so the confusion lies</p>
<p>in that most foods are a combination of</p>
<p>carbohydrates fats and proteins so very</p>
<p>few foods are pure one thing or the</p>
<p>other except for refined carbohydrates</p>
<p>where you can eat things that are almost</p>
<p>pure carbohydrate but for example when</p>
<p>you eat steak for it&rsquo;s a combination of</p>
<p>fat and protein most meals which have a</p>
<p>combination of all three so there is an</p>
<p>overlap between sort of how many</p>
<p>calories you eat and their caloric and</p>
<p>their insulin effect but what it simply</p>
<p>means is that not all foods are equally</p>
<p>fattening which is sort of just common</p>
<p>sense because the sort of lie that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been sold</p>
<p>is that all calories are equally</p>
<p>fattening so you can eat kale or you can</p>
<p>eat cookies and they&rsquo;re the same so you</p>
<p>can eat cookies for dinner and skip your</p>
<p>salad and you&rsquo;ll be fine and any idiot</p>
<p>would sort of know that you won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>fine if you eat cookies for dinner and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real that&rsquo;s the real thing so</p>
<p>when you look at it from a real</p>
<p>scientific standpoint a lot of what we</p>
<p>think about weight gain just doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make any sense that is to say if</p>
<p>calories are so important why doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>your body have any sort of mechanism to</p>
<p>measure calories it really has no clue</p>
<p>how many calories you&rsquo;re eating if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re to reduce calories like for low</p>
<p>fat diets because dietary fat is sort of</p>
<p>the highest in calories so if you reduce</p>
<p>dietary fat you reduce calories you</p>
<p>should be able to lose weight well guess</p>
<p>what</p>
<p>millions of people have done low-calorie</p>
<p>low-fat diets over the last 50 years and</p>
<p>guess what the failure rates somewhere</p>
<p>on the order of 99 percent if we know</p>
<p>that a low-fat low-calorie diet fails 99</p>
<p>percent of the time why on earth would</p>
<p>we recommend it it&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>ridiculous</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s insane so that&rsquo;s what the obesity</p>
<p>code is really about it&rsquo;s about sort of</p>
<p>saying what causes obesity because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most important thing you need</p>
<p>to know if it&rsquo;s too much insulin then</p>
<p>lower insulin how are you going to do</p>
<p>that well you can reduce the</p>
<p>carbohydrate the refined carbohydrates</p>
<p>in your diet you can sort of moderate</p>
<p>protein and eat more of the natural fats</p>
<p>the other thing you can do is</p>
<p>intermittent fasting where you don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>for a period of time because the the</p>
<p>fastest way to lower insulin is to eat 0</p>
<p>which is fasting and there&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>nothing intrinsically wrong with that</p>
<p>but again we get into this idea where</p>
<p>people think that oh you need to eat 10</p>
<p>times a day it&rsquo;s like you need to eat 10</p>
<p>times a day to lose weight really how is</p>
<p>that gonna work I was eating more</p>
<p>frequently going to make you lose weight</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t even make any sense</p>
<p>it sounds really stupid because it is</p>
<p>really stupid it&rsquo;s honestly like saying</p>
<p>you should you know roll in the dirt ten</p>
<p>times a day to clean you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exactly eat so every time you eat</p>
<p>insulin goes off again assuming that you</p>
<p>eat a mix of macronutrient so every time</p>
<p>you eat is then goes up and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed to do that&rsquo;s a natural</p>
<p>reaction the insulin goes up and tells</p>
<p>our body to store some of that food</p>
<p>energy when you don&rsquo;t eat like when you</p>
<p>go to sleep at night and when you go to</p>
<p>sleep it&rsquo;s then false and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>signal but you should take some of this</p>
<p>food energy that you stored and pull it</p>
<p>back out so you can burn it so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>balance there when you eat you store</p>
<p>food energy when you don&rsquo;t eat you burn</p>
<p>food energy balance the two and you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t gain weight</p>
<p>so if you eat all the time you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>telling your body through insulin to</p>
<p>keep storing food energy and that is not</p>
<p>going to make you lose weight it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>make you gain weight and that&rsquo;s in fact</p>
<p>what exactly what we see so from 1977 to</p>
<p>2004 for example we went from people</p>
<p>eating three meals a day on average to</p>
<p>about six meals a day the most recent</p>
<p>studies looking at people suggest that</p>
<p>they eat for about 14 to 15 hours of the</p>
<p>day and it tends to be shifted later so</p>
<p>if you eat at 8:00 a.m. breakfast for</p>
<p>example you don&rsquo;t stop eating until</p>
<p>about 10:45 p.m. essentially the entire</p>
<p>day you&rsquo;re eating as opposed to 1977</p>
<p>where you eat breakfast lunch dinner</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it no slack between no bad time</p>
<p>snacks that&rsquo;s it you&rsquo;re eating sort of</p>
<p>ten hours and fast and fourteen hours</p>
<p>instead of sort of the reverse and this</p>
<p>is the thing we&rsquo;re not giving our bodies</p>
<p>the time it needs to burn off this food</p>
<p>energy that we&rsquo;ve stored and right</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing more complicated than</p>
<p>that so if you want to lose weight one</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat the highest end foods and to</p>
<p>give your body a chance to not eat so</p>
<p>that your insulin levels can fall and</p>
<p>you can burn it exactly so so we have</p>
<p>this mainstream viewpoint that we must</p>
<p>lower sugar despite how much instantly</p>
<p>give you what from your viewpoint high</p>
<p>levels of insulin is even is it possibly</p>
<p>more damaging than high levels of sugar</p>
<p>in the blood I think both are very</p>
<p>important so the thing is so now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about diabetes where you have</p>
<p>high blood sugar so in type 1 diabetes</p>
<p>insulin levels are low so if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>case then giving insulin is a reasonable</p>
<p>thing to do and we know that if you</p>
<p>leave blood sugar levels very high</p>
<p>remember this is type 1 where insulin</p>
<p>levels are low so you&rsquo;re not having any</p>
<p>problem with instances and there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>but your glucose levels blood glucose</p>
<p>levels are high that that is a</p>
<p>problem so you need to get that down</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the sort of paradigm of</p>
<p>gluco toxicity that is if you have high</p>
<p>glucose in your blood it&rsquo;s gonna cause</p>
<p>damage what we haven&rsquo;t recognized is</p>
<p>that if you have high insulin levels in</p>
<p>your blood it&rsquo;s also very damaging so in</p>
<p>type 2 diabetes it&rsquo;s a completely</p>
<p>different situation where you have high</p>
<p>insulin levels and high glucose levels</p>
<p>so both are bad but if you simply take</p>
<p>more insulin to to lower your blood</p>
<p>glucose you&rsquo;re just trading toxicities</p>
<p>that is you&rsquo;re taking more insulin so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having more damage from the</p>
<p>insulin but your glucose is batters</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having less damage from the</p>
<p>glucose so more insulin toxicity and</p>
<p>less luke logic to city in the end it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a wash so you&rsquo;re not actually any</p>
<p>healthier and that&rsquo;s all the studies</p>
<p>that we actually prove this exact point</p>
<p>10 years ago so 10 years we&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>doing the same thing even after there</p>
<p>was the Accord study the Advanced Study</p>
<p>the PABT the Ticos like tons of trials</p>
<p>that have shown that taking more</p>
<p>medications to lower your blood glucose</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you healthier and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the whole point</p>
<p>because if your insulin levels are high</p>
<p>anyway why would you take more it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any sense you should in</p>
<p>fact lower them and that would be the</p>
<p>proper treatment because again if you</p>
<p>have hyperthyroidism like if your</p>
<p>thyroid is overactive you don&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>people more thyroid medication right</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s oh you give it a fire in my</p>
<p>case if it&rsquo;s high you don&rsquo;t do the same</p>
<p>thing so if your insulin levels are low</p>
<p>give insulin if your insulin levels are</p>
<p>high lower it what I did was we gave</p>
<p>more right easy</p>
<p>and then and then so there&rsquo;s kind of an</p>
<p>omission here like traditional medicine</p>
<p>does not necessarily jump in test</p>
<p>fasting insulin levels do fasting</p>
<p>insulin levels are quite variable and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one of the problems so it</p>
<p>fluctuates quite a bit and in the late</p>
<p>stages of type 2 diabetes sometimes you</p>
<p>see sort of a tapering off of the high</p>
<p>insulin levels are still high but not as</p>
<p>high as it might</p>
<p>back it is I think that what has been</p>
<p>unrecognized is the sort of problem of</p>
<p>too much insulin so obesity is a problem</p>
<p>of too much insulin but type-2 diabetes</p>
<p>also is a problem of too much insulin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of unrecognized so getting</p>
<p>the fasting insulin that well I do that</p>
<p>regularly to make sure I&rsquo;m not treating</p>
<p>a situation of type where I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>type-2 diabetes but it&rsquo;s actually a</p>
<p>situation of type 1 diabetes where</p>
<p>insulin levels are quite low because</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s you have to know what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re treating because you can&rsquo;t treat</p>
<p>them to the same you can&rsquo;t treat no</p>
<p>thyroid and high five ride with the same</p>
<p>treatment it doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s like saying</p>
<p>you know washer and the dryer like one</p>
<p>makes her wet and one makes it dry right</p>
<p>but totally different right they the</p>
<p>same thing exactly was there a point in</p>
<p>your career where you um had this huge</p>
<p>shift of like wow we&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>backwards what&rsquo;s this like this aha</p>
<p>moment when you about ten years ago so</p>
<p>those studies came out so I was trained</p>
<p>quite conventionally and ten years ago</p>
<p>the conventional thinking in type 2</p>
<p>diabetes so I&rsquo;m a kidney specialist I</p>
<p>deal with a lot of kidney disease the</p>
<p>most common cause of which is type 2</p>
<p>diabetes sort of by far in a way so I</p>
<p>see a lot of type 2 diabetes patients</p>
<p>and the classical teaching was that you</p>
<p>give as much medication as you need to</p>
<p>get that blood glucose down because the</p>
<p>only thing that&rsquo;s important is that</p>
<p>blood glucose and so that&rsquo;s what I did I</p>
<p>gave people lots of insulin and there</p>
<p>but he posed as Louis I humanly could</p>
<p>the point was in 2008 when all those</p>
<p>trials came out that said that hey</p>
<p>giving lots of insulin to get the blood</p>
<p>glucose down doesn&rsquo;t actually make</p>
<p>people healthier man that was when I</p>
<p>started thinking wow that&rsquo;s a total</p>
<p>change of everything that we had been</p>
<p>taught like everything everything</p>
<p>changed</p>
<p>but unfortunately sort of what happened</p>
<p>was that the specialist and the</p>
<p>our cities they just kept teaching the</p>
<p>same thing you have as much medication</p>
<p>as you need to get the blood glucose</p>
<p>down and I kept thinking well isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>exactly what we proved to be untrue and</p>
<p>it was very strange to watch this I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>but the problem is that people were so</p>
<p>deep into this paradigm of just get the</p>
<p>blood glucose down that they never</p>
<p>stopped to think about what could what</p>
<p>was the problem and that was when I</p>
<p>really started thinking well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another problem too and the patient&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>patients had recognized that long before</p>
<p>I recognized that so you got to</p>
<p>recognize that type-2 diabetes is a</p>
<p>reversible disease okay so if you lose</p>
<p>weight the diabetes type 2 diabetes</p>
<p>almost always goes away if you just look</p>
<p>at studies of bariatric surgery for</p>
<p>example where people get their stomachs</p>
<p>caught and so on and in this way the</p>
<p>diabetes almost always resolves like in</p>
<p>90% of cases unless the weight comes</p>
<p>back so we know if they lose weight the</p>
<p>diabetes goes away when we prescribe</p>
<p>insulin to these type 2 diabetics who</p>
<p>are older and overweight generally they</p>
<p>tend to gain with it so it&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>the patients would always say look</p>
<p>doctor you always tell me that I need to</p>
<p>lose weight then you give me insulin and</p>
<p>I gain like 40 pounds well how is that</p>
<p>making my diabetes better and I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a good answer because the answer</p>
<p>was that it wasn&rsquo;t making that better</p>
<p>but the point is that type-2 diabetes is</p>
<p>really a disease of too much sugar in</p>
<p>your body when you take a medication</p>
<p>such as insulin it actually forces that</p>
<p>sugar into the bottom remember insulin</p>
<p>is what the hormone that tells your body</p>
<p>to store that food energy so if your</p>
<p>sugar is high you take insulin your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s gonna store it it&rsquo;s gonna turn it</p>
<p>into fat so of course they gain weight</p>
<p>but the question is what does it do to</p>
<p>the sugar has it gotten rid of that</p>
<p>excess sugar in your body the answer is</p>
<p>no it simply forced it into your body</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t see it because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>in the blood anymore but the sugar goes</p>
<p>all over your body it goes into your</p>
<p>heart and your liver and your kidneys</p>
<p>and over 10-15 years</p>
<p>all your organs basically just brought</p>
<p>away that&rsquo;s my diabetics have disease of</p>
<p>everything so if you take a disease such</p>
<p>as a osteomyelitis or gangrene for</p>
<p>example those are diseases that are</p>
<p>seeing virtually in no other case other</p>
<p>than that it&rsquo;s type 2 diabetes the</p>
<p>question is why why do you get this</p>
<p>osteomyelitis infection of the bone</p>
<p>which is very rare elsewhere are you</p>
<p>getting mucormycosis which are these</p>
<p>rare fungal infections because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got way too much sugar all over the</p>
<p>place and the bacteria love them so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just happy to proliferate and</p>
<p>then you get a bad infection so the</p>
<p>point is that if you take insulin you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not getting rid of the sugar you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>simply moving it into your body and</p>
<p>eventually if you stop taking the</p>
<p>insulin all that sugar just comes back</p>
<p>out in the blood so you&rsquo;ve really done</p>
<p>nothing for this disease and that was</p>
<p>the answer to why the sort of current</p>
<p>paradigm of sort of diabetes treatment</p>
<p>was completely wrong if you don&rsquo;t if</p>
<p>people are not losing weight the</p>
<p>diabetes is not going to get better so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I became very interested in</p>
<p>the question of what causes weight gain</p>
<p>and it turns out it was the same answer</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they related to both</p>
<p>diseases of too much insulin but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very powerful because once you know that</p>
<p>these are diseases of too much insulin</p>
<p>the solution is obvious know where</p>
<p>insulin right on you that no</p>
<p>carbohydrate diets intermittent fasting</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t lower calories because when you</p>
<p>lower calories you may or may not lower</p>
<p>insulin you could take diet coke for</p>
<p>example zero calories does anybody lose</p>
<p>weight drinking diet coke not really</p>
<p>right we&rsquo;ve been drinking it for 50</p>
<p>years it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s one of the top sort of</p>
<p>three soda pops in the world and clearly</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s less calories than a regular</p>
<p>coke but it doesn&rsquo;t cause less obesity</p>
<p>so we know that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>calories calories is not the right thing</p>
<p>that we should be focusing on so so you</p>
<p>being a kidney spell a specialist you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably see a lot of patients</p>
<p>coming with stage-four on kidney</p>
<p>dialysis and advanced stages what has</p>
<p>been your experience with working with</p>
<p>some of those guys do some of them not</p>
<p>need dialysis anymore once we get to</p>
<p>that stage it&rsquo;s often too late and I had</p>
<p>hoped when I started that yes maybe some</p>
<p>of them could reverse you can reverse in</p>
<p>the very early stages we&rsquo;ll keep in mind</p>
<p>that diabetic kidney disease often takes</p>
<p>15 to 20 years to manifest so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coming in at the 18th year very often it</p>
<p>will make no difference</p>
<p>so you can reverse it when when you</p>
<p>catch it early but we catch it late it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard it&rsquo;s like if you were not to change</p>
<p>the oil in your car and then it breaks</p>
<p>down and say oh now I&rsquo;m gonna chase you</p>
<p>on my car it&rsquo;s like oh great but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not gonna do anything for your car</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s broken down it&rsquo;s the same idea</p>
<p>once all that damage is sustained it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really very difficult to get it to</p>
<p>reverse it because you&rsquo;ve taken that</p>
<p>that hit already so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>focused more on getting the message out</p>
<p>and getting letting people know that hey</p>
<p>type 2 diabetes is not an irreversible</p>
<p>disease it&rsquo;s a reversible disease it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>dietary disease focus on your diet if</p>
<p>you reverse diabetic disease you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to get the diabetic problems that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get later on but if they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>developed already it&rsquo;s very hard to</p>
<p>reverse that it&rsquo;s still worthwhile to</p>
<p>work with them because there&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at high risk of other problems but that</p>
<p>kidney disease very often doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>reverse what about when a patient</p>
<p>develops a problem to the point where</p>
<p>their potassium starts going higher and</p>
<p>higher and so then they go the doctor</p>
<p>and the doctor says avoid all potassium</p>
<p>foods including vegetables and is there</p>
<p>have you found that they pretty much</p>
<p>need to avoid the supplement potassium</p>
<p>or do they have to avoid also vegetables</p>
<p>in general because it&rsquo;s high in</p>
<p>potassium is that the Baals need to be</p>
<p>avoided so again this is in the</p>
<p>relatively unusual situation where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>advanced kidney disease and there&rsquo;s sort</p>
<p>of nuances in that</p>
<p>the kidneys are not working they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting rid of the potassium so if you</p>
<p>take foods like avocado which are quite</p>
<p>high in potassium then your body&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be able to get rid of it so you</p>
<p>do have to be careful for certain types</p>
<p>of foods that are high in potassium</p>
<p>bananas for example your oranges mangoes</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a number of things that are</p>
<p>high in potassium so but that is a</p>
<p>fairly unusual situation in you know</p>
<p>overall so it&rsquo;s a but but yes if your</p>
<p>get to that stage you do have to be a</p>
<p>little bit careful</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why intermittent fasting works</p>
<p>because even if you&rsquo;re worried about</p>
<p>high phosphorus high potassium as</p>
<p>advanced kidney disease because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually eating zero you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about that your potassium intake</p>
<p>is going to be lower than if you&rsquo;re to</p>
<p>eat and again this is you know that for</p>
<p>us we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve sort of pioneered this</p>
<p>sort of the therapeutic use of fasting</p>
<p>so we have a program called the</p>
<p>intensive dietary management program</p>
<p>where we help people with the fossum</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not fun it&rsquo;s not easy right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s healthy but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s hard it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard work and that&rsquo;s what we need people</p>
<p>to do is get the support they need and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we provide in our intensive</p>
<p>dietary management program to people but</p>
<p>there are certain sort of medical things</p>
<p>if you have advanced disease you do have</p>
<p>to be a little bit careful in terms of</p>
<p>the fasting interferon medications yeah</p>
<p>be careful in that sort of thing young</p>
<p>guys if I&rsquo;m gonna put a link down below</p>
<ul>
<li>he has not only books he has a program</li>
</ul>
<p>on his website we&rsquo;ll put a link down</p>
<p>below check it out</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard great results from what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing and you&rsquo;re in Canada so you</p>
<p>can actually you don&rsquo;t have to be in</p>
<p>Canada you can be anywhere in the world</p>
<p>and sent to his program and coaching or</p>
<p>get the data because you have videos in</p>
<p>there you have all sorts of educational</p>
<p>stuff yeah so there&rsquo;s tons of stuff so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ton of free stuff on there I</p>
<p>write a weekly blog and there&rsquo;s links to</p>
<p>let you tube videos and so on so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tons of free stuff and then if</p>
<p>you if you need more than we also have a</p>
<p>sort of a membership community where we</p>
<p>do the group fasts and so on and then if</p>
<p>you want more you get sort of small</p>
<p>group coaching so with somebody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of experienced with the fasting and</p>
<p>can help you because there are problems</p>
<p>that do come up there are things such as</p>
<p>headaches and motivation is a big one so</p>
<p>doing things in a group is just a lot</p>
<p>easier than doing stuff yourself and</p>
<p>also if you have somebody to talk to so</p>
<p>we have forums that people can</p>
<p>communicate with each other and those</p>
<p>are the sort of things that make it easy</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s interesting to me because people</p>
<p>always they all never do that but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna recognize that many religions have</p>
<p>prescribed periods of fasting so if you</p>
<p>look at Catholicism during Lent for</p>
<p>example if you look at Ramadan and the</p>
<p>Muslim faith if you look at Buddhist for</p>
<p>example Hindus Mormons almost any</p>
<p>religion the reason is a lot easier for</p>
<p>them is because they&rsquo;re all doing it as</p>
<p>a group so if you&rsquo;re doing a month of</p>
<p>fasting or it&rsquo;s Lent then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to fasts or you&rsquo;ve heard of</p>
<p>Greek Orthodox Church well all your</p>
<p>friends and family are fasting too so</p>
<p>one if you have any problems they can</p>
<p>help you like you know they can make</p>
<p>sure you&rsquo;re staying well hydrated and</p>
<p>all this sort of stuff but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>like cooking a big meal in front of you</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re supposed to thousand</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s doing it together so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a lot easier so that&rsquo;s the sort of</p>
<p>group support that is actually very very</p>
<p>important in any type of behavioural</p>
<p>change and we know that from groups such</p>
<p>as say Weight Watchers which their diet</p>
<p>is okay but the secret sauce if you will</p>
<p>is the root support same as Alcoholics</p>
<p>Anonymous they know very well what you</p>
<p>have to do abstain from alcohol not that</p>
<p>difficult but the secret sauce is that</p>
<p>group support that they get from each</p>
<p>other and I don&rsquo;t know why we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>provide it for each other but because</p>
<p>fasting is relatively new and people</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a lot of myths and</p>
<p>misconceptions around the fact that oh</p>
<p>you have to eat</p>
<p>times a day and so on people don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the help that they need in order to be</p>
<p>successful and there&rsquo;s other things like</p>
<p>you know people for example to help with</p>
<p>this hunger and so on so you can use T</p>
<p>for example green tea which has this</p>
<p>thing called the catagen which is that</p>
<p>they have antioxidants but they have</p>
<p>this thing called catechins and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been shown that there&rsquo;s a small appetite</p>
<p>suppressing effect as well with</p>
<p>something as simple as green tea which</p>
<p>you can buy anywhere or there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fasting tea for example which is a</p>
<p>special cold brewed tea that you can use</p>
<p>and it may help with the hunger for</p>
<p>example so these sort of things which</p>
<p>are simple and relatively inexpensive</p>
<p>can help people but you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>know about it unless you sort of are</p>
<p>talking to people about and because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so new it&rsquo;s hard for people and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re trying to provide it&rsquo;s sort</p>
<p>of support for the fasting but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also free groups like Facebook groups</p>
<p>and so on there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a ton</p>
<p>of information out there if you dig a</p>
<p>little bit you&rsquo;re probably in you know</p>
<p>if you put a little work into it you</p>
<p>could probably find all the information</p>
<p>for free it&rsquo;s all out there everything</p>
<p>is out there for free these days right</p>
<p>yeah yeah specially on YouTube so the</p>
<p>benefits of fasting go beyond weight</p>
<p>loss right yeah so there&rsquo;s a lot of very</p>
<p>interesting sort of benefits to fasting</p>
<p>and one the most obvious of course is</p>
<p>weight loss and also treatment of type 2</p>
<p>diabetes so we do it a lot to her first</p>
<p>time to diabetes and again not very</p>
<p>difficult if you don&rsquo;t eat your blood</p>
<p>sugars will come down because your body</p>
<p>is burning it off if electric is coming</p>
<p>down you don&rsquo;t need to take your</p>
<p>medications so we reverse a lot of</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s type 2 diabetes but beyond that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other benefits so people find</p>
<p>for example that their concentration</p>
<p>improves they&rsquo;re able to do more because</p>
<p>their their mental abilities name proof</p>
<p>with that and people think oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>strange because I thought it was the</p>
<p>opposite it&rsquo;s like well it&rsquo;s not think</p>
<p>about a time where you eat a huge meal</p>
<p>like Thanksgiving</p>
<p>were you really really mentally sharp or</p>
<p>where you just sort of slide in front of</p>
<p>the TV watching football</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s probably the latter people who</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t eat actually may have</p>
<p>increased mental abilities because you</p>
<p>have to understand that when insulin</p>
<p>Falls like when you fast insulin Falls</p>
<p>but other hormones go up these are the</p>
<p>so-called counter regulatory hormones</p>
<p>and two important ones one is more</p>
<p>adrenaline so it actually increases the</p>
<p>amount of energy that goes into your</p>
<p>system so if you look at your metabolic</p>
<p>rate everybody says well you&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>into starvation mode that&rsquo;s not what</p>
<p>happens because as your noradrenaline</p>
<p>goes up your metabolic rate does</p>
<p>maintain so if you measure the amount of</p>
<p>calories somebody is burning at the</p>
<p>start of a four day five so after four</p>
<p>days of not eating they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>burning 10% more calories than when they</p>
<p>started</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s because of this counter</p>
<p>regulatory hormones you&rsquo;re changing the</p>
<p>hormone so that you&rsquo;re actually flooding</p>
<p>your body with energy the reason is that</p>
<p>this is a survival mechanism so if you</p>
<p>think back to cavemen days pose you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>caveman and you don&rsquo;t eat for a few days</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got weaker and mentally dulled</p>
<p>well you would really never eat again</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a spiral right you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat you get a little weaker a little bit</p>
<p>you know less mentally sharp which means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re less able to get food and so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even harder to get food so you go</p>
<p>another day and that&rsquo;s worse and worse</p>
<p>and worse you spiral down and you die</p>
<p>then we wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting here today</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s instead of that then mother</p>
<p>nature is just not that stupid right</p>
<p>instead of that what it does is our body</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t shut down it actually switches</p>
<p>fuel sources from food to body fat and</p>
<p>pumps us up full of energy so</p>
<p>noradrenaline goes up and growth hormone</p>
<p>goes up into the other hormone we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to talk about and when you do that</p>
<p>you increase your mental abilities then</p>
<p>you increase your energy so that you can</p>
<p>go out and hunt and get some food to eat</p>
<p>so people have done studies for example</p>
<p>on memory and it increases with fasting</p>
<p>and people have done</p>
<p>you know have talked about it so what</p>
<p>was really interesting to me is when I</p>
<p>was reading a biography of this prisoner</p>
<p>of war in Japan and American prisoner</p>
<p>war and they&rsquo;re literally starving like</p>
<p>they have almost nothing to eat and he</p>
<p>describes these incredible mental feats</p>
<p>he says you know other prisoners were</p>
<p>learned Norwegian in like four days and</p>
<p>look entirely from his mind and the</p>
<p>credible mental feats and he goes well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the astonishing mental clarity</p>
<p>of starvation Wow look they actually</p>
<p>wrote that oh maybe who actually went</p>
<p>through severe severe starvation because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it was and he&rsquo;s pretty good</p>
<p>and these prisoner of war camps</p>
<p>understood that people got so smart</p>
<p>doing this it was just like yeah I see</p>
<p>it every day like you know this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing this and this and it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>and this is one of the reasons that the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting has taken off in</p>
<p>Silicon Valley it&rsquo;s like the hottest</p>
<p>diet trend because like these are not</p>
<p>people trying to lose weight they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>these computer geniuses but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>competing against other computer</p>
<p>geniuses and if you&rsquo;re a little bit</p>
<p>smarter that&rsquo;s the difference between</p>
<p>being Facebook and being myspace right</p>
<p>you could either be a billionaire or you</p>
<p>could be nothing right for that extra</p>
<p>little mental edge this huge and if you</p>
<p>can do it while doing something healthy</p>
<p>and doing something free and basically</p>
<p>hacking yourself into that extra mental</p>
<p>edge okay it could mean a lot right it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like performance athletics that</p>
<p>last little bit is this is so important</p>
<p>so that mental ability is one of the</p>
<p>benefits the increased energy is one of</p>
<p>the benefits and we hear it all the time</p>
<p>people coming in and they&rsquo;re saying oh</p>
<p>wow I have so much energy lady we had we</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t barely go from the waiting room</p>
<p>to my office like we be basically the</p>
<p>next time which is like right</p>
<p>it was crazy because she was on all this</p>
<p>insulin and remember insulin which goes</p>
<p>up when you eat is the storage hormone</p>
<p>it tells you about to store the energy</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re taking a ton of insulin</p>
<p>your body is busy storing all this</p>
<p>energy and you&rsquo;re not able to use it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all going into storage so</p>
<p>when we took her off we allowed her</p>
<p>insulin to go low which allowed her body</p>
<p>to start releasing these energy stores</p>
<p>remember it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re shutting</p>
<p>down your body you&rsquo;re switching your</p>
<p>fuel sources from food to body fat it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s perfect does it slackly what</p>
<p>we want to happen and then there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>theoretical benefits so for example</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease some people have</p>
<p>thought that intermittent fasting may be</p>
<p>very beneficial because you stimulate</p>
<p>this other sort of cellular cleaning</p>
<p>process called ecology so when you</p>
<p>particularly when you&rsquo;re doing water</p>
<p>fasts get past a certain sort of 24 to</p>
<p>36 hours you stimulate a process called</p>
<p>a tapa G which is where your body</p>
<p>actually breaks down protein so you</p>
<p>break down these subsets of parts which</p>
<p>tend to be the older parts that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>working so well and everybody thinks wow</p>
<p>break down a protein that&rsquo;s really bad</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really bad because the other</p>
<p>hormone that goes up quite a bit it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>growth hormone so when you do a sort of</p>
<p>aged feeding fasting cycle as you fast</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to break down some protein</p>
<p>but as you start to eat again because</p>
<p>growth hormone is way up you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>going to rebuild that protein so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole sort of renewal process so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like renovating your bathroom for</p>
<p>example the first thing you know to do</p>
<p>is actually throw out that lime green</p>
<p>tub from the seventies right if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take that out you can&rsquo;t put a new</p>
<p>one in - the first step is to actually</p>
<p>break it down then rebuild it and that</p>
<p>actually keeps you functioning better</p>
<p>than if you never broke it down in the</p>
<p>first place which is why a lot of people</p>
<p>consider the fasting which used to be</p>
<p>called sort of a</p>
<p>same thing which is what it is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>cleaning out that old stuff in your body</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to renew it with new</p>
<p>stuff which is like perfect because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a free process and it&rsquo;s a process that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been used for thousands of years not as</p>
<p>something which is like oh I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>punish you it was used because people</p>
<p>knew that it was sort of intrinsically</p>
<p>healthy for for staying well and all</p>
<p>this sort of thing so it&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>science sort of modern science this just</p>
<p>sort of catching up to this sort of 2000</p>
<p>year old idea but once in a while we</p>
<p>should fast right whether it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>Prophet Muhammad with Ramadan or if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Jesus Christ with Lent and all that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just catching up to this idea that</p>
<p>hey these guys they didn&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>science but they knew that when people</p>
<p>did this they actually stayed relatively</p>
<p>healthy because remember there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>obesity 2,000 years ago or that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>little but it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s healthy</p>
<p>and hey now we&rsquo;re realizing yeah it can</p>
<p>be healthy and even for things like</p>
<p>cancer well same thing cancer is a</p>
<p>disease of increased growth so if you</p>
<p>fast you&rsquo;re going to shut down these</p>
<p>growth pathways so everybody thinks you</p>
<p>know cancer is a genetic disease but in</p>
<p>fact there&rsquo;s a lot more to it than that</p>
<p>because the World Health Organization</p>
<p>categorizes at 11 or 14 cancers as</p>
<p>obesity related including common ones</p>
<p>like breast cancer and colorectal cancer</p>
<p>and so on so if you allow instant to</p>
<p>fall you&rsquo;re not going to have these</p>
<p>growth signals which is going to</p>
<p>possibly prevent a lot of these sort of</p>
<p>obesity related cancers from gaining</p>
<p>hope that&rsquo;s theoretical but makes a lot</p>
<p>of sense these days absolutely what type</p>
<p>of fasting do you do personally I took</p>
<p>that please stick to sort of 24-hour</p>
<p>fast and that&rsquo;s because the are sort of</p>
<p>number one rule for fasting is to fit it</p>
<p>into your lifestyle so if you do</p>
<p>something very intrusive on</p>
<p>lifestyle you can do it but not for very</p>
<p>long it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a therapy right it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>therapeutic okay so I had one time one</p>
<p>fellow who used to fast and so he used</p>
<p>to get together with his friends every</p>
<p>so often to you know to meet a chat and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d stop doing that because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>them and that&rsquo;s not the point the point</p>
<p>is to fit it in where you can but do</p>
<p>everything you normally do because again</p>
<p>having friends is very important I mean</p>
<p>get it going out and celebrating is very</p>
<p>important so you have to find something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to be able to stick to</p>
<p>so doing something like a 3 or 5 day</p>
<p>fast is very intrusive because if I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do it like I usually have dinner</p>
<p>with my family most nights so I can do</p>
<p>that but it&rsquo;s hard if you&rsquo;re fasting</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s eating you&rsquo;re not you it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard so that to me works the best a lot</p>
<p>of 24-hour fast and once in a while out</p>
<p>throwing it longer fast so three days or</p>
<p>longer and that&rsquo;s typically after I go</p>
<p>on vacation and on vacation I typically</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fast because again I&rsquo;m with my</p>
<p>family most of the time and you know</p>
<p>they want to eat or and we&rsquo;ll go out</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll still you know trying to limit</p>
<p>stuff but on the other hand you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be the party pooper all the time</p>
<p>right you know you know I won&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything go out and all this sort of</p>
<p>stuff it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no balance</p>
<p>there so you gotta find what works for</p>
<p>you and for some people it&rsquo;s longer fast</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for sure too fast but that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>sort of thing I stick to when my pants</p>
<p>start to get a little tight then I do my</p>
<p>best right really busy then I do more</p>
<p>fast thing when I decide to like during</p>
<p>holiday so typically all do Christmas</p>
<p>for example I won&rsquo;t I won&rsquo;t watch when I</p>
<p>at all and I will probably do very</p>
<p>little fasting and also during vacation</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve made that decision but I know</p>
<p>that I have to make up for it afterwards</p>
<p>so right you know I just I just went on</p>
<p>vacation and I had a lot to eat and I</p>
<p>felt great and then I got back and my</p>
<p>pants were a little tight and I up the</p>
<p>fasting so I&rsquo;ll typically do it at least</p>
<p>twice a week</p>
<p>the last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>it for five times a week and now my</p>
<p>pants get better now so did you find</p>
<p>before you started fasting that were you</p>
<p>the grazer that snack between meals and</p>
<p>at night you were you that touch person</p>
<p>not typically but I think that we had</p>
<p>all sort of started becoming that so if</p>
<p>you look at meetings and so on right so</p>
<p>you go to a meeting I don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>do a lot of meeting for like at the</p>
<p>hospital or any company and you have a</p>
<p>meeting at 10:00 a and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>muffins and you go for lunch meeting</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lunch and then you go for an</p>
<p>afternoon meeting and there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>muffins or Donuts or cookies or</p>
<p>something and the problem is that when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re there it&rsquo;s extremely tempting</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s new it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s something that we don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>we got fine</p>
<p>by fine in the 60s and 70s without sort</p>
<p>of muffins and bagels at 10:00 a.m.</p>
<p>meeting so why do we need it now and so</p>
<p>we had all sort of become that sort of</p>
<p>oh we should eat something and and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the same it&rsquo;s become ingrained in our</p>
<p>society and I think it&rsquo;s very unhealthy</p>
<p>so my son went to camp this week and you</p>
<p>know they send me back an email saying</p>
<p>oh welcome to camp we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>provide lunch and two snacks why do all</p>
<p>these kids need snack kids but you go</p>
<p>play soccer for example so the kids used</p>
<p>to play soccer and at every halftime</p>
<p>somebody thought it was necessary that</p>
<p>the kids have some juice and cookies why</p>
<p>I used to go out in play soccer as did</p>
<p>everybody else in the 1970s and guess</p>
<p>what nobody ate snacks my parents</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t chasing me around with a juice</p>
<p>box and two cookies I&rsquo;ll tell you that</p>
<p>much you just went out and played and</p>
<p>had a great time you didn&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>twice about whether you wanted to eat</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re too busy playing yeah I</p>
<p>mean your parent your parents would sit</p>
<p>down all of us would sit down three</p>
<p>meals but then now it&rsquo;s like everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on the run grab</p>
<p>quick food no one eats it&rsquo;s down it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s completely shifted the whole</p>
<p>lifestyle shifted to small snacks bring</p>
<p>snack between meals after school the</p>
<p>whole thing exactly and and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing wrong I mean we&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>change the fact that people are gonna be</p>
<p>on the run all the time but changing the</p>
<p>sort of snacking habit and making sure</p>
<p>that you have a proper fast because we</p>
<p>remember a very word breakfast means you</p>
<p>have to fast it&rsquo;s a meal that breaks</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fast if you&rsquo;re not fasting you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t break it so therefore you should</p>
<p>be like 10 or 12 hours like you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t finish dinner and then not eat</p>
<p>anything until breakfast there&rsquo;s no need</p>
<p>for for it for an evening snack that</p>
<p>just isn&rsquo;t and you don&rsquo;t need to have</p>
<p>that so even if you are on the run</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to this and I&rsquo;m it</p>
<p>this that you can still eat three meals</p>
<p>a day and not snack but there has to be</p>
<p>this recognition that hey snacking is</p>
<p>actually pretty pretty fattening which</p>
<p>is probably what your grandmother would</p>
<p>have told you now we&rsquo;ve gone from Oh</p>
<p>snacking is fattening to snacking is</p>
<p>super healthy that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re ordering</p>
<p>muffins for our meeting it&rsquo;s like no we</p>
<p>should get rid of that you can have</p>
<p>coffee but don&rsquo;t have don&rsquo;t order the</p>
<p>plate of muffins don&rsquo;t order the plate</p>
<p>of cookies don&rsquo;t order anything you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gone to medical conferences they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>worst</p>
<p>even the obesity conferences we go there</p>
<p>what do you get you get breakfast at</p>
<p>10:30 you come out and there&rsquo;s a full</p>
<p>spread of banana loaf sand mock mint</p>
