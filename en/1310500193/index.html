    <p>The following is a conversation with David Sinclair.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard</p>
<p>and co director of the Paul F. Glenn Center</p>
<p>for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of the book,</p>
<p>Lifespan and co founder of several biotech companies.</p>
<p>He works on turning age into an engineering problem</p>
<p>and solving it.</p>
<p>Driven by a vision of a world</p>
<p>where billions of people can live much longer</p>
<p>and much healthier lives.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Onnit, Clear, National Instruments,</p>
<p>and I, SimpliSafe and Linode.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that longevity research</p>
<p>challenges us to think how science and engineering</p>
<p>will change society.</p>
<p>Imagine if we can live 100,000 years,</p>
<p>even under controlled conditions,</p>
<p>like in a spaceship say,</p>
<p>then suddenly a trip to Alpha Centauri</p>
<p>that is a 4.37 light years away</p>
<p>takes a single human lifespan.</p>
<p>And on the psychological, maybe even philosophical level,</p>
<p>as the horizons of death drifts farther into the distance,</p>
<p>how will our search for meaning change?</p>
<p>Does meaning require death</p>
<p>or does it merely require struggle?</p>
<p>Reprogramming our biology will require us to delve deeper</p>
<p>into understanding the human mind and the robot mind.</p>
<p>Both of these efforts are as exciting of a journey</p>
<p>as I can imagine.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with David Sinclair.</p>
<p>I usually feel like the same person when I was 12.</p>
<p>Like when I, right now, as I think about myself,</p>
<p>I feel like exactly the same person</p>
<p>that I was when I was 12.</p>
<p>And yet, I am getting older, both body and mind,</p>
<p>and still feel like time hasn&rsquo;t passed at all.</p>
<p>Do you feel this tension in yourself</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re the same person and yet you&rsquo;re aging?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have this tension that I&rsquo;m still a kid,</p>
<p>but that helps in my career.</p>
<p>Scientists need to have a wonder about the world</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t wanna grow up at 12 year olds</p>
<p>and even younger, I would say six, seven year olds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still got that boy in me and I can look at things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gift, I think, that I can see things</p>
<p>for the first time if I choose to,</p>
<p>and then explain them as I would to a six year old</p>
<p>because I am that mentally.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I&rsquo;m getting older, right?</p>
<p>I run a lab of 20 people at Harvard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a book, I&rsquo;ve got science to do, companies to run,</p>
<p>and so I have to, on most days,</p>
<p>just pretend to be a grownup and be mature,</p>
<p>but I definitely don&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something I really appreciated</p>
<p>in opening your book.</p>
<p>You talked about your grandmother.</p>
<p>And on this kind of theme, on this kind of topic,</p>
<p>she, first of all, had a big influence on you.</p>
<p>My grandmother had a big influence on me.</p>
<p>And you also mentioned this poem</p>
<p>by the author of Winnie the Pooh, Alan Alexander Milne.</p>
<p>Maybe I can read it real quick</p>
<p>because I love, on the topic of being children,</p>
<p>when I was one, I had just begun.</p>
<p>When I was two, I was nearly new.</p>
<p>When I was three, I was hardly me.</p>
<p>When I was four, I was not much more.</p>
<p>When I was five, I was just alive, but now I am six.</p>
<p>I am as clever, as clever, so I think I&rsquo;ll be six,</p>
<p>now, forever and ever.</p>
<p>So this idea of being six and staying six forever,</p>
<p>being youthful, being curious,</p>
<p>being childlike, this and other things,</p>
<p>what influence has your grandmother had</p>
<p>in your thinking about life, about death, about love?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was getting misty eyed as you read that</p>
<p>because that poem was read to me very often,</p>
<p>if not every day, by my grandmother,</p>
<p>who partially raised me.</p>
<p>And she was as much a bohemian as an artist, philosopher.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s one of those people</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t talk about the little things.</p>
<p>She said, I hate small talk.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t talk to me about politics or the weather.</p>
<p>Yeah, talk to me about human beings and culture.</p>
<p>So I was raised on that,</p>
<p>and this poem was one that she read to me often</p>
<p>because she knew that the mind of a child is precious,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s honest, it&rsquo;s pure.</p>
<p>And she grew up during the Second World War</p>
<p>and in Hungary and Budapest witnessed the worst of humanity.</p>
<p>She was trying to save a whole group of Jewish friends</p>
<p>in her apartment, saw what happened after the World War,</p>
<p>which was there was, the Russians were in control</p>
<p>and locals weren&rsquo;t necessarily treated well</p>
<p>if they were rebellious, which she was.</p>
<p>And then there was the revolution in 56,</p>
<p>which she was part of and had to escape the country.</p>
<p>So she saw what can happen when humans do their worst.</p>
<p>And her words to me, expressed in part through that poem</p>
<p>was, David, always stay young and innocent</p>
<p>and have wonder about the world,</p>
<p>and then do your best to make humanity the best it can be.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s who I am, that&rsquo;s what I live for,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I get up in the morning to do</p>
<p>is to leave the world a better place</p>
<p>and show to whoever&rsquo;s watching us,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s aliens or some future human historian,</p>
<p>that we can do better than we did in the 20th century.</p>
<p>You know, we mentioned offline this idea</p>
<p>of bringing people back to life</p>
<p>through artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>sort of, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen videos</p>
<p>of basically animating people back to life,</p>
<p>meaning whether it&rsquo;s, for me personally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on specifically about Albert Einstein,</p>
<p>but also Alan Turing, Isaac Newton, and Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an opportunity to bring people</p>
<p>that meant a lot to others in the world</p>
<p>and animate them and be able to have a conversation</p>
<p>with them at first to try to visually,</p>
<p>visually explore the full richness of character</p>
<p>that they had as they struggle</p>
<p>with the ideas of the modern age.</p>
<p>Sort of, it&rsquo;s less about bringing back their mind</p>
<p>and more bringing back the visual quirks</p>
<p>that made them who they are.</p>
<p>And then maybe in the future,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s using the textual, the visual,</p>
<p>the video, the audio data to actually compress</p>
<p>down the person for who they are</p>
<p>and be able to generate text.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few companies, there&rsquo;s Replica,</p>
<p>which is a chat engine that was born</p>
<p>out of the idea of bringing,</p>
<p>the founder lost her friend to,</p>
<p>he got run over by a car.</p>
<p>And the initial reason she founded the company</p>
<p>was trying to just have a conversation with her friend.</p>
<p>She trained machine learning, natural language system</p>
<p>on the texts that they exchange with each other</p>
<p>and try, she had a conversation with him</p>
<p>sort of after he was gone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very, the conversation was very trivial.</p>
<p>It was obvious that it&rsquo;s AI agent,</p>
<p>but it gave her solace.</p>
<p>It made her actually feel really good.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to bring back people that are,</p>
<p>that mean something to us personally,</p>
<p>not just Einstein, but people that we&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>and in that way achieve a kind of small</p>
<p>artificial immortality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you think about this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, I definitely think about a lot of things.</p>
<p>That one&rsquo;s a really good one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great Black Mirror episode</p>
<p>about the wife who brings back the boyfriend or husband.</p>
<p>I think one of the challenges</p>
<p>with bringing back Richard Feynman</p>
<p>would be to capture his sense of humor,</p>
<p>but that would be awesome.</p>
<p>But yeah, bringing back loved ones would be great,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re young and they die early,</p>
<p>though it may hold you back from moving on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing that could happen as a negative.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I also think that it&rsquo;s gonna be possible,</p>
<p>especially when we&rsquo;re recording some of us,</p>
<p>every aspect of our lives,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s our face or things we see, right?</p>
<p>Eventually one day, everything we see can be recorded.</p>
<p>And then you can build somebody&rsquo;s experience</p>
<p>and thoughts, speech,</p>
<p>and you will have replicas of everybody,</p>
<p>at least digitally,</p>
<p>and physically you could do that too one day.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a good idea,</p>
<p>especially because there are people that I&rsquo;d like to meet,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s easier than building a time machine.</p>
<p>One person I&rsquo;d love to meet is Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t go back in time.</p>
<p>I would, but I&rsquo;d prefer to bring him into the future</p>
<p>and say, can you believe we have this thinking machine</p>
<p>in our pockets now?</p>
<p>And just see the look on his face</p>
<p>as to where humanity has come.</p>
<p>Because I think of him as a modern guy</p>
<p>that just was before his time.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re thinking Benjamin Franklin the scientist,</p>
<p>not Benjamin Franklin the political thing.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;d be very upset with Congress right now.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So maybe talk to him about science and technology,</p>
<p>not politics.</p>
<p>Or maybe just don&rsquo;t get him on Twitter</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;ll be very upset with human civilization.</p>
<p>You know, I wonder what their personalities are like.</p>
<p>Isaac Newton, it does seem complicated</p>
<p>to figure out what their personality is like.</p>
<p>Even Friedrich Nietzsche, who I also thought about.</p>
<p>Feynman is, we just have enough video</p>
<p>where we get the full kind of,</p>
<p>I mean, it shows you how important it is</p>
<p>to get not the official kind of book level presentation</p>
<p>of a human, but the authentic,</p>
<p>the full spectrum of humanity.</p>
<p>You mentioned collecting data about a person,</p>
<p>collecting the whole thing, the whole of life,</p>
<p>the ups and downs, the embarrassing stuff,</p>
<p>the beautiful stuff, not just the things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s condensed into a book.</p>
<p>And then with Feynman, you start to see that a little bit.</p>
<p>Through conversations, you start to see peaks</p>
<p>of like that genius.</p>
<p>And then through stories about him from others.</p>
<p>And then certainly you, the sad thing</p>
<p>about Alan Turing, for example,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s very little, if any, recording of him.</p>
<p>In fact, I haven&rsquo;t been able to find recording</p>
<p>allegedly there&rsquo;s supposed to be a recording of him</p>
<p>doing some kind of a radio broadcast,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t been able to find anything.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s truly sad that it feels like</p>
<p>it makes you realize how the upside,</p>
<p>how nice it is to collect data about a person,</p>
<p>to capture that person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the upside of the modern internet age,</p>
<p>the digital age, that that information,</p>
<p>yeah, creates a kind of immortality.</p>
<p>And then you can choose to highlight</p>
<p>the best parts of the person,</p>
<p>maybe throw away the ugly parts</p>
<p>and celebrate them even after they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really interesting opportunity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also mentioned to me offline</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really excited about all the different wearables</p>
<p>and all the different ways we can collect information</p>
<p>about our bodies, about the whole thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most exciting to you in terms of collecting</p>
<p>the biological data about a human being?</p>
<p>Well, so I&rsquo;m a biologist.</p>
<p>I find animals and humans as machines very interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I didn&rsquo;t become an engineer</p>
<p>or a surgeon.</p>
<p>I wanted to understand how we actually are built.</p>
<p>And so I think a lot about machines merging with humans.</p>
<p>And the first of that are the bio wearables.</p>
<p>And so I talked a lot about this, I wrote about it</p>
<p>in Lifespan, the book, and pictured a future</p>
<p>where you would be monitored constantly</p>
<p>so that you wouldn&rsquo;t suddenly have a heart attack,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d know that was coming,</p>
<p>or you wouldn&rsquo;t go to the doctor</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know if you need an antibiotic or not.</p>
<p>Long term, how old are you, how to fix things,</p>
<p>what should you eat, what should you take,</p>
<p>what should your doctor do?</p>
<p>These devices, I predicted, would be smarter,</p>
<p>better educated than your physician</p>
<p>and would augment them.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;d be a human that would just tick off</p>
<p>to see if it&rsquo;s correct and they approve.</p>
<p>I also was predicting in the book</p>
<p>that we would have video conferences with our doctors</p>
<p>and that medicines would be delivered,</p>
<p>initially by courier, but eventually by drones</p>
<p>and get it to you sometimes in an emergency.</p>
<p>And that we could even have pills</p>
<p>that were synthesized or delivered in your kitchen</p>
<p>and combined certainly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s amazing about that is that, what are we now,</p>
<p>two years since the book came out, even less,</p>
<p>and that future is basically here already.</p>
<p>COVID 19 accelerated that incredibly.</p>
<p>So where we&rsquo;re at now in society is,</p>
<p>if you wanna pay for it, you can have a blood test</p>
<p>that will detect cancer 10, 20 years earlier than it would</p>
<p>before it forms a tumor.</p>
<p>You can, of course, do your genome very cheaply</p>
<p>for less than $100 now.</p>
<p>There are bio wearables already I wear,</p>
<p>this ring from Aura that I have a number of years of data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing blood tests for the last 12 years</p>
<p>with a company called Inside Tracker, which I consult for.</p>
<p>And so I have all of that data as well.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s 34 different parameters on my testosterone,</p>
<p>my blood glucose, my inflammation.</p>
<p>And I use all that data to, of course,</p>
<p>I wear a watch that measures things as well.</p>
<p>I use that data to keep my body in optimal shape.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now 51.</p>
<p>And according to those parameters,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at least as good as someone in their early 40s.</p>
<p>And if I really work at it,</p>
<p>I can get my biochemistry down to early to mid 30s,</p>
<p>though I like to now eat a little dessert once in a while.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the future we&rsquo;re in right now.</p>
<p>Anyone can do what I just said.</p>
<p>But in the very near future, just in the next few years,</p>
<p>you can be wearing wearables.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m currently wearing a little,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called a bio sticker.</p>
<p>This one I just put on last night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about an inch long, a few millimeters.</p>
<p>Yeah, for people just listening, it&rsquo;s on David&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, how does it attach?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of.</p>
<p>It sticks on. Sticks on.</p>
<p>Yeah, so on one side you have an on button that you press.</p>
<p>The lights come on, flashes four times, it&rsquo;s good to go.</p>
<p>It immediately syncs to your phone.</p>
<p>And this one, it&rsquo;s called a bio button, a nice name.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another one that I have that I haven&rsquo;t tried yet</p>
<p>that does EKG on your heart.</p>
<p>This is mainly for doctors to monitor patients</p>
<p>that go home after a heart attack or surgery.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s medical grade FDA approved device.</p>
<p>So there will be a day, in fact, it&rsquo;s already here,</p>
<p>that doctors are using these to get patients to go home</p>
<p>and save a week in hospital, $2,000 at least</p>
<p>for each patient.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s massive savings for the hospital.</p>
<p>But ultimately what I&rsquo;m excited about is a future</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t that far off where everybody,</p>
<p>certainly in developed countries,</p>
<p>eventually these will cost a few cents and rechargeable.</p>
<p>The only cost will be the software subscription</p>
<p>that can be monitored constantly.</p>
<p>And to give an idea what this is measuring me</p>
<p>at a thousand times a second is my vibrations as I speak,</p>
<p>my orientation, it already has told me this morning</p>
<p>how I slept, where I slept, what side I slept on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got sneezing, coughing, body temperature,</p>
<p>heart rate, heart of other parameters of the heart</p>
<p>that would indicate heart health.</p>
<p>These data are being used to now to predict sickness.</p>
<p>So eventually we&rsquo;ll have just in the next year or so</p>
<p>the ability to predict whether something</p>
<p>or diagnose whether something is pneumonia</p>
<p>or just a rhinovirus that can be treated or not.</p>
<p>This is really going to not just revolutionize medicine,</p>
<p>but I think extend lives dramatically.</p>
<p>Because if I&rsquo;m gonna have a heart attack next week</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s possible, this device should know that</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be in hospital before I even have it.</p>
<p>Maybe you can talk a little bit about InsideTracker</p>
<p>because I saw that there&rsquo;s some really cool things in there.</p>
<p>Like it actually, so maybe you can talk about,</p>
<p>I guess that you&rsquo;re collecting blood to give it the data.</p>
<p>So, and it has like basic recommendations</p>
<p>on how to improve your life.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not just talking about diseases, right?</p>
<p>Like anticipating having a particular disease,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost like guiding your trajectory to life,</p>
<p>how to, whether it&rsquo;s extend your life</p>
<p>or just live a more fulfilling,</p>
<p>like improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>I suppose this is the right way to say it.</p>
<p>How does InsideTracker work?</p>
<p>What the heck is it?</p>
<p>Because I thought there was also pretty cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Is it something other people can use?</p>
<p>You can definitely use it.</p>
<p>You can sign up, it&rsquo;s consumer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a company consumer facing company.</p>
<p>It is, yeah.</p>
<p>And I also want to democratize the ability</p>
<p>to just take a mouth swab eventually.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to have a blood test necessarily,</p>
<p>but for now it&rsquo;s a blood test</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d go to a lab core request in the US.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also available overseas.</p>
<p>You can upload your own data for a minimal cost</p>
<p>and get the algorithms, the AI in the background</p>
<p>to take that data,</p>
<p>plot where you are against others in your age group</p>
<p>in terms of health and longevity at bio age.</p>
<p>They call it inner age,</p>
<p>but also it provides recommendations.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t just a bunch of BS.</p>
<p>It sounds like it might be to say, I&rsquo;ll go eat this</p>
<p>or go to that restaurant and order that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually based on the basic.</p>
<p>This company has entered hundreds.</p>
<p>Now it would be thousands of scientific papers</p>
<p>into their database</p>
<p>and hundreds of thousands of human data points.</p>
<p>And they have tens of thousands of individuals</p>
<p>that have been tracked over time</p>
<p>and anonymously that data is used to say</p>
<p>what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you eat that, what works?</p>
<p>If you take that supplement, what works?</p>
<p>And I was a coauthor on a paper that showed</p>
<p>that the recommendations for food and supplements</p>
<p>was better than the leading drug for type two diabetes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>The idea that you can connect,</p>
<p>like skipping the human having to do this work,</p>
<p>you can connect the scientific papers,</p>
<p>almost like meta analysis of the science</p>
<p>connected to the individual data.</p>
<p>And then based on that sort of connect your data</p>
<p>to whatever the proper group is</p>
<p>within the whatever the scientific paper is</p>
<p>to make the suggestion of how like how that work</p>
<p>applies to your life.</p>
<p>And then that ultimately maps to like a recommendation</p>
<p>of what you should do with your life.</p>
<p>Like it all like this giant system</p>
<p>that ultimately recommends</p>
<p>you should drink more coffee or less.</p>
<p>Right, and we&rsquo;ll have the genome in there as well.</p>
<p>You can upload that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So these programs will know us way better</p>
<p>than we do and our doctors as well.</p>
<p>The idea of going to a doctor once a year</p>
<p>for an annual checkup and having males get a finger</p>
<p>up their butt and you cough, that to me is a joke.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s medieval medicine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very soon going to be seen as medieval.</p>
<p>Yeah, to me as a computer science person,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always upsetting to go to the doctor</p>
<p>and just look at him and like realize</p>
<p>you know nothing about me.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re making your like opinions based on like,</p>
<p>it is very valuable, years of intuition building</p>
<p>about basic symptoms, but you&rsquo;re just like it is medieval.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very good at it.</p>
<p>In fact, doctors in medieval times were probably damn good</p>
<p>at working with very little.</p>
<p>But the thing is, I&rsquo;d rather prefer a doctor</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t really know what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but has a huge amount of data to work with.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And many of my good friends are doctors.</p>
<p>I work at Harvard.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not against the profession at all.</p>
<p>But I think that they need just as much help</p>
<p>as anyone else does.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t drive a car without a dashboard.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t think of it.</p>
<p>So why would doctors do the same?</p>
<p>If we could, could we step back to the big,</p>
<p>profound, philosophical, both tragic</p>
<p>and beautiful question about age?</p>
<p>How and why do we age?</p>
<p>Is it from an engineering perspective?</p>
<p>You said you like the biological machine.</p>
<p>Is that a feature or a bug of the biological machine?</p>
<p>It is both a bug and a feature.</p>
<p>Evolutionary speaking, we only live as long as we need to</p>
<p>to replace ourselves efficiently.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a mouse, you&rsquo;re only gonna live two</p>
<p>and a half years, three years.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably gonna die of starvation,</p>
<p>predation, freezing in the winter.</p>
<p>So they divert most of their resources</p>
<p>to reproducing rapidly,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t put a lot of energy</p>
<p>into preserving their soma, which is their body.</p>
<p>Conversely, a baleen type of whale,</p>
<p>a bowhead whale in particular will live hundreds of years</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re at the top of the food chain</p>
<p>and they can live as long as they want.</p>
<p>So they breed slowly and build a body that lasts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re somewhere in between because we&rsquo;ve, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve really only just come out of the savannas</p>
<p>where we could be picked off by a cat.</p>
<p>We were pretty wimpy going back 6 million years ago.</p>
<p>So we actually need to evolve quicker than evolution will.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we can use our oversized brains</p>
<p>and intuition to give us what evolution</p>
<p>not only didn&rsquo;t give us, but took away from us.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re pathetic, look at our bodies.</p>
<p>These arms, if any of us, even the strongest person</p>
<p>in the world went in a cage with a chimpanzee,</p>
<p>the chimp could knock that person&rsquo;s head off, no question.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re pathetic.</p>
<p>So we need to engineer ourselves to be healthier</p>
<p>and longer lived.</p>
<p>So getting to aging, we can do better, right?</p>
<p>Whales do way better.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to learn how whales do that.</p>
<p>And if you ask really anybody in the field now, professor,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say there are eight or nine hallmarks of aging,</p>
<p>which are really, it&rsquo;s a word for causes of aging.</p>
<p>So that you probably have heard of some of these,</p>
<p>your listeners will have loss of telomeres,</p>
<p>the ends of the chromosomes, like the little ends</p>
<p>of shoelaces, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>They get too short, cells stop dividing, become senescent.</p>
<p>They become, they put out what are called mitogens</p>
<p>that cause cancer and inflammatory molecules.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another aspect of aging, cellular senescence.</p>
<p>Another one is loss of the energetic.</p>
<p>So mitochondria, the battery packs wind down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch, stem cells, proteostasis.</p>
<p>Well, these are our Achilles heels that I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a common amongst all life forms, really.</p>
<p>But if you want me to jump to the chases to where,</p>
<p>what is the upstream defining factor?</p>
<p>If we boil it down, what do we get?</p>
<p>So most biologists would say, you can&rsquo;t boil it down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too complex.</p>
<p>I would say you can boil it down to an equation,</p>
<p>which is the preservation of information</p>
<p>and loss due to entropy, i.e. noise.</p>
<p>And that is the basis of my research.</p>
<p>It originally came out of discoveries in yeast cells,</p>
<p>where I went to MIT in the 1990s.</p>
<p>You studied bread.</p>
<p>I kind of did.</p>
<p>I studied the makers of bread,</p>
<p>a little yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</p>
<p>which at the time was one of the hottest, excuse the pun,</p>
<p>organisms to work on.</p>
<p>But we figured out in the lab why yeast cells get old</p>
<p>and found genes that control that process</p>
<p>and made them live longer,</p>
<p>which was an amazing four years of my life.</p>
<p>One of those genes had a name with an acronym SIR2.</p>
<p>Now the two is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The SIR is important.</p>
<p>And the most important letter out of all of those three</p>
<p>is I, which stands for information.</p>
<p>Silent information regulator number two,</p>
<p>when you put more copies of that gene in,</p>
<p>just put in one more copy,</p>
<p>the yeast cells lived 30% longer</p>
<p>and suppressed the cause of aging,</p>
<p>which was the dysregulation of information in the cell.</p>
<p>And then, so fast forward to now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking in humans and mice,</p>
<p>because they live shorter and cheaper to study,</p>
<p>where the loss of information in our bodies</p>
<p>is a root cause of aging.</p>
<p>And I think it is.</p>
<p>Your boldness in doing biology in this way is fascinating</p>
<p>because that also leads to a kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like allows for a theory of aging,</p>
<p>like you could boil it down to a single equation</p>
<p>and it leads to a, perhaps a metric</p>
<p>that allows you to optimize aging,</p>
<p>sort of in the fight against entropy.</p>
<p>I had to figure out which mechanisms, like you said,</p>
<p>the silent information regulator,</p>
<p>which mechanisms allow you to preserve information</p>
<p>without injecting noise, without creating entropy,</p>
<p>without creating degradation of that information.</p>
<p>For some reason, converting biology,</p>
<p>which I thought was mostly impossible</p>
<p>into an engineering problem,</p>
<p>feels like it makes it amenable to optimization,</p>
<p>to solving problems, to creating technology that can,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s genetic engineering or AI,</p>
<p>it makes it possible to create the technology</p>
<p>that would improve the degradation of information and aging.</p>
<p>Is there more concrete ways you think</p>
<p>about the kind of information you want to preserve?</p>
<p>And also, is there good ideas about regulators</p>
<p>of that information, about ways to prevent the distortion,</p>
<p>the degradation of that information?</p>
<p>Right, so we have silent information regulator genes</p>
<p>in our bodies.</p>
<p>We have seven of them, SIRT1 through seven, they&rsquo;re called.</p>
<p>And we found in mice, one way to slow down</p>
<p>the loss of information is to just give more of these,</p>
<p>to upregulate these genes.</p>
<p>So we made a mouse that has more of this SIRT1 gene,</p>
<p>turned it on, and that slowed down the aging of the brain</p>
<p>and preserved their information.</p>
<p>Now, what information am I talking about, you might ask?</p>
<p>Well, again, you can simplify biology.</p>
<p>There are two types of information in the cell primarily.</p>
<p>The one we all read about and know about</p>
<p>is the DNA, the genome.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s base four information, ATCG,</p>
<p>the four chemicals that make up the various sequences</p>
<p>of the genome, billions of letters.</p>
<p>And that also degrades over time.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s been fascinating is that we find</p>
<p>that that information is pretty much intact</p>
<p>in old animals and people.</p>
<p>You can clone a dog.</p>
<p>One of my friends in LA just cloned his dog three times.</p>
<p>So this is doable, right?</p>
<p>It means that the genome can be intact.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the other type of information?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the epigenome, the regulators</p>
<p>of the genetic information.</p>
<p>And physically, that&rsquo;s really just how the DNA is wrapped up</p>
<p>or looped out for the cell to access it and read it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s similar to, and excuse this analogy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good one, a compact disc or a DVD.</p>
<p>Those pits in the foil are the digital information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the genome.</p>
<p>And the epigenome is the reader of that information.</p>
<p>And in a different cell, you&rsquo;d read different music,</p>
<p>different songs, different symphonies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what gets laid down when we&rsquo;re in the womb.</p>
<p>And that makes a skin cell forever a skin cell</p>
<p>and not a brain cell tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thank God, otherwise our brains wouldn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>
<p>But over time, what we see is that the brain cells</p>
<p>start to look more like skin cells.</p>
<p>And the kidney cells start to look more like liver cells.</p>
<p>And what we call X differentiate.</p>
<p>This is a term that we use in my lab,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t yet widely used.</p>
<p>But we needed a term to explain this.</p>
<p>And that process of X differentiation,</p>
<p>the loss of the reader of the CD or the DVD,</p>
<p>we liken that to scratches on the DVD</p>
<p>so that the reader cannot fully access the information.</p>
<p>Now we can slow down the scratches, as I mentioned.</p>
<p>We can turn on these genes.</p>
<p>We can even put in molecules into the cell</p>
<p>or even eat them and turn on those pathways,</p>
<p>which my father and I have been trying to do</p>
<p>for about a decade to slow things down.</p>
<p>But the question that I&rsquo;ve had is,</p>
<p>is there a repository of information still in the body?</p>
<p>Because anyone who knows anything</p>
<p>about the loss of information</p>
<p>or even has tried to copy a cassette tape</p>
<p>or photocopy or Xerox anything knows that over time,</p>
<p>you lose that information irreparably.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been looking for a backup copy,</p>
<p>inspired largely by Claude Shannon&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>at MIT as well in the 1940s.</p>
<p>His mathematical theory of communication is just brilliant.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been looking for what he called the observer,</p>
<p>which is the backup copy.</p>
<p>We today might call that the TCPIP protocol of the internet</p>
<p>that stores information in case it doesn&rsquo;t make it</p>
<p>to your computer, it will fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been spending about the last five years</p>
<p>to try and find if there really is a backup copy in the body</p>
<p>to reset the epigenome and polish those scratches away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So finding the backup, so whenever there are too many</p>
<p>scratches pile up, you can just write a new version.</p>
<p>Like write, not a new version,</p>
<p>but go to the backup and restore it.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s really all we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that hard once you know the trick.</p>
<p>And for people that actually remember like DVDs</p>
<p>and scratches on them, how frustrating it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a brilliant metaphor for aging.</p>
<p>And then the reader is the thing that skips</p>
<p>and then it could destroy your experience,</p>
<p>the richness of the experience that is listening</p>
<p>to your favorite song.</p>
<p>Right, but in biology, it&rsquo;s even worse</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll lose your memory, your kidneys will fail,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get diabetes, your heart will fail.</p>
<p>And we call that aging and age related diseases.</p>
<p>So most people forget that diseases that we get</p>
<p>when we get old are 80 to 90% caused by aging.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been trying to fix things with band aids</p>
<p>after they occur without even generally talking</p>
<p>about the root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>Is there the scratches, do those come from,</p>
<p>are those programmed or are they failures?</p>
<p>Meaning is it, so if it&rsquo;s by design,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s like a encoded timeline schedule</p>
<p>that the body&rsquo;s just on purpose,</p>
<p>degrading the whole thing.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the just the wear and tear</p>
<p>of like the scratches on a disc that happen through time.</p>
<p>Which one is it that&rsquo;s the source of aging?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more akin to wear and tear, there isn&rsquo;t a program.</p>
<p>Getting back to evolution, there&rsquo;s no selection for aging.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not designed to age, we just live as long as we need</p>
<p>to and then we&rsquo;re at the whim of entropy, basically.</p>
<p>Second law of thermodynamics, stuff falls apart.</p>
<p>We live a bit longer than age 40,</p>
<p>only because there are robust, resilient systems,</p>
<p>but eventually they fail as well.</p>
<p>Current limit to the human lifespan</p>
<p>where they completely fail is 122.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t like to think of it as wear and tear</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s two aspects to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a system that&rsquo;s built to keep us alive</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re young, but actually goes,</p>
<p>comes back to bite us as we get older.</p>
<p>And we call this issue antagonistic pleiotropy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s good for you when you&rsquo;re young</p>
<p>can cause problems when you&rsquo;re older.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been looking, what is the main causes of the noise?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve found two of them definitively.</p>
<p>The first one is broken chromosomes.</p>
<p>When a chromosome breaks, the cell has to panic</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s either gonna cause a cancer or kill the cell.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only two outcomes, it&rsquo;s pretty much a problem.</p>
<p>And so what the cell does is it reorganizes the epigenome</p>
<p>in a massive way.</p>
<p>What that leads to is, think of it as a tennis match</p>
<p>or a ping pong game.</p>
<p>The proteins are the balls</p>
<p>and they now leave where they should be,</p>
<p>which is regulating the genes that make the cell type,</p>
<p>whatever it is.</p>
<p>And they have a dual function,</p>
<p>they actually go to the break,</p>
<p>the chromosome will break and fix that.</p>
<p>And then they come back.</p>
<p>You might ask, well, why is it set up that way?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a beautiful system,</p>
<p>it coordinates gene expression,</p>
<p>the control systems with the repair.</p>
<p>You want them coordinated.</p>
<p>Problem is, as we get older, this ping pong game,</p>
<p>some of the balls get lost.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t come back to where they originally started.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we think is the main noise for aging.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve also, the other cause of aging that we found</p>
<p>is cell stress, we damage nerves and they age rapidly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the other issue.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably others, smoking chemicals, for example,</p>
<p>we know accelerates biological age pretty dramatically.</p>
<p>But the question is, can you slow that down</p>
<p>or can you reset them to get those ping pong balls</p>
<p>to go back to where they originally started in the game?</p>
<p>And we think we&rsquo;ve found a way to do that.</p>
<p>Can you give me hints?</p>
<p>Whose fault is it in the balls not coming back?</p>
<p>Is it the proteins themselves?</p>
<p>Like are they starting?</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with the protein folding problem</p>
<p>from the AI perspective.</p>
<p>So is it the proteins or is it something else?</p>
<p>Well, we know who hits the balls and recruits them.</p>
<p>So that the break is recognized by the cell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s recognized by proteins who send out a signal</p>
<p>through phosphorylation is typical way cells talk</p>
<p>to other proteins.</p>
<p>And that recruits those repair factors,</p>
<p>those ping pong balls to the break.</p>
<p>So the cells actively doing this to try and help itself,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s to blame for them not coming back.</p>
<p>That could just be a flaw in the quote unquote design.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s something saying,</p>
<p>well, 1% of you balls proteins never go back.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s hard to reset a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s constantly changing.</p>
<p>We have in our bodies close to a trillion DNA breaks</p>
<p>every day.</p>
<p>And imagine that over 80 years,</p>
<p>what damage that does to our epigenomic information.</p>
<p>Now we know that this is, well,</p>
<p>we never know anything in biology,</p>
<p>but we have strong evidence that this is true</p>
<p>because we can mess with animals.</p>
<p>We can create DNA breaks and tickle them</p>
<p>with a few breaks, maybe raise it by threefold</p>
<p>over background levels of normal breakage.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re right, those mice should get old.</p>
<p>And they do.</p>
<p>We can actually, we&rsquo;ve created these breaks</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s titratable.</p>
<p>We can, it&rsquo;s like a rheostat.</p>
<p>We can send it to 11.</p>
<p>I drove my Tesla here, I&rsquo;m a big fan of a spinal tap too,</p>
<p>going to 11.</p>
<p>If we go to 11, we can make a mouse old</p>
<p>in a matter of months.</p>
<p>We prefer to go to a level of about four</p>
<p>and it gets old in 10 months.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s definitely old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got all of the hallmarks of aging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got diseases.</p>
<p>It looks old.</p>
<p>Its skin is old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got gray hair.</p>
<p>But importantly, we can now measure age</p>
<p>by looking at the scratches.</p>
<p>We can look at the epigenome, we can measure it</p>
<p>and use machine learning to give us a number.</p>
<p>And those mice are 50% older than normal.</p>
<p>So you can replicate the aging process in a controlled way.</p>
<p>You can, I mean, in a way that, I mean,</p>
<p>you could accelerate it in a controlled way</p>
<p>and measure how much exactly it&rsquo;s aging.</p>
<p>And that gives you step one of a two step process</p>
<p>to when you can then figure out,</p>
<p>how can we reverse this?</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re reversing those mice.</p>
<p>Is there a good, I love what you said.</p>
<p>I mean, in biology, you really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a beautiful mess.</p>
<p>Is there ideas how to do that?</p>
<p>Is that on the genetic engineering level?</p>
<p>Is it like, what can you mess with?</p>
<p>Is it going to the, trying to discover the backup copies</p>
<p>and restoring from them?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s possible to convert it</p>
<p>to natural language words, what are the ideas here?</p>
<p>What is the observer and how do we contact it?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the observer and how do you contact?</p>
<p>Or if there&rsquo;s other ideas, how to reverse</p>
<p>the balls getting lost process.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you can slow it down.</p>
<p>Slow it.</p>
<p>But we found a reset switch recently.</p>
<p>We just published this in the December 2020 issue of Nature.</p>
<p>And what we found is that there were three embryonic genes</p>
<p>that we could put into the adult animal</p>
<p>to reset the age of the tissues.</p>
<p>And it only takes four to eight weeks to work well.</p>
<p>And we can take a blind mouse</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lost its vision due to aging.</p>
<p>Neurons aren&rsquo;t working well towards the brain.</p>
<p>Reset those neurons back to a younger age.</p>
<p>And now the mice can see again.</p>
<p>These three genes are famous actually</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re a set of four genes</p>
<p>discovered by Shinya Yamanaka,</p>
<p>who won the Nobel Prize in 2016</p>
<p>for discovering that those four genes</p>
<p>when turned on at high levels in adult cells</p>
<p>can generate stem cells.</p>
<p>And this is, I think, well known now</p>
<p>that we can create stem cells from adult tissue.</p>
<p>But what wasn&rsquo;t known is can you partially take age back</p>
<p>without becoming a tumor</p>
<p>or generating a stem cell in the eye,</p>
<p>which would be a disaster?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes.</p>
<p>There is a system in the body</p>
<p>that can take the age of a cell back to a certain point,</p>
<p>but no further, safely, and reset the age.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now using that to reset the age of the brain</p>
<p>of those mice that we aged prematurely.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re getting their ability to learn back.</p>
<p>This is really exciting, right?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the downside of this?</p>
<p>Well, the downside is if you overdo it</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get it right, you might cause tumors.</p>
<p>But we do it very carefully.</p>
<p>And we also know that in the eye, it&rsquo;s very safe.</p>
<p>We also injected these, we deliver them by viruses.</p>
<p>So we can control where and when they get turned on.</p>
<p>And in this paper, we&rsquo;ve published</p>
<p>that if we put high levels in the mouse,</p>
<p>into their veins, throughout the body,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get cancer for over a year.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m so optimistic that we&rsquo;re going into human studies</p>
<p>in less than two years from now.</p>
<p>Is there a place where AI can help?</p>
<p>Sorry to inject one of the things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited about and passionate about.</p>
<p>So Google DeepMind recently had a big breakthrough</p>
<p>with AlphaFold2, but also AlphaFold two years ago,</p>
<p>with achieving sort of a state of the art performance</p>
<p>on the protein folding problem, single protein folding.</p>
<p>But it also paints a hopeful picture</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s possible to do in terms of simulating</p>
<p>the folding of proteins,</p>
<p>but also simulating biological systems through AI.</p>
<p>Is there something to you, combined with this brilliant work</p>
<p>on the biology side that you&rsquo;re hopeful about</p>
<p>where AI can be a tool to help?</p>
<p>Where isn&rsquo;t it a tool?</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re not using AI right now in biology,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting less and less likely</p>
<p>to be left behind in biology, you&rsquo;re getting left behind.</p>
<p>We use it all the time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using it to generate these biological clocks</p>
<p>to be able to read those scratches.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using it to predict the folding of proteins</p>
<p>so we can target molecules and modulate their activity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using it to assemble genomes of different species.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>We use it to predict the longevity of a mouse</p>
<p>based on how it reacts to certain things,</p>
<p>hearing, eyesight, generally frailty.</p>
<p>We just put out a paper last year on that.</p>
<p>The other thing we can use it for,</p>
<p>which is a little off the track here,</p>
<p>but we use it for predicting</p>
<p>which microorganisms are in your body,</p>
<p>actually not predicting, telling you.</p>
<p>So our daughter, Natalie, was infected with Lyme disease</p>
<p>a few years ago, almost went blind from it.</p>
<p>And the test took four days.</p>
<p>And I thought, just give me the DNA from her spinal fluid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go tell you what&rsquo;s in it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s Lyme disease or not, they refused.</p>
<p>And so at that point I said, this has to be done better.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve started a company that now can take a sample</p>
<p>of any part of your body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s typically done now with liver transplant patients</p>
<p>to detect viruses that come out of their organs.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s another area that AI is extremely important for.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re not, in five years,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not using deep learning, you&rsquo;ve got a problem.</p>
<p>Because the amount of data that we generate now</p>
<p>as biologists is just terabytes.</p>
<p>It can be terabytes per week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll eventually be terabytes per day.</p>
<p>And then we just go from there.</p>
<p>And I actually have trouble recruiting enough</p>
<p>bioinformaticians.</p>
<p>A lot of our work is now just number crunching.</p>
<p>A part of that is collecting the data,</p>
<p>which is kind of something we&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about.</p>
<p>But is there something you can say about</p>
<p>how we can collect more and more data,</p>
<p>not just on the one person level,</p>
<p>like for you to understand your various markers,</p>
<p>but to create huge datasets</p>
<p>to understand how we can detect certain pathogens,</p>
<p>detect certain properties, characteristics</p>
<p>of whether it&rsquo;s aging or all the other ways</p>
<p>that the human body can fail.</p>
<p>It seems like with biology,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of privacy concerns that,</p>
<p>well, actually not privacy concerns,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like regulation that kind of prevents</p>
<p>hospitals from sharing data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how to say it,</p>
<p>but it seems like when you look at autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>people are much more willing to share data.</p>
<p>When you look at human biology system,</p>
<p>people are much less willing to share data.</p>
<p>Is there a hopeful path forward</p>
<p>where we can share more and more data at a large scale</p>
<p>that ultimately ends up helping us understand</p>
<p>the human body and then treat problems with the human body?</p>
<p>So we are right in the middle,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living through what&rsquo;s gonna be seen</p>
<p>as one of the biggest revolutions in human health,</p>
<p>through the gathering of data about our bodies.</p>
<p>And 20 years ago, people didn&rsquo;t wanna go on social media,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re worried about it, now you have to,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a kid, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>Same with medical records,</p>
<p>these are becoming all digitized and expanded.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we&rsquo;re going to, even if we don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>have to be monitored.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a court case that,</p>
<p>I bet two, three years from now, someone&rsquo;s gonna say,</p>
<p>how come my father died from a heart attack?</p>
<p>You had these biosensors, 20 bucks, and you didn&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>Lawsuit right there, and suddenly,</p>
<p>all hospitals have to give you one of these.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a reversal, like to where,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your fault if you don&rsquo;t collect the data,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s brilliant, and that&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the frustration I feel on going to the doctor,</p>
<p>is like, it&rsquo;s almost negligent to not collect the data,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something really wrong with me,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re making decisions based on very few tests,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s almost negligent, when you have the opportunity</p>
<p>to collect a huge amount more data.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you something.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve got this inside tracker data</p>
<p>for myself over a decade,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d think my doctor would roll his eyes at this,</p>
<p>oh, he&rsquo;s gone to a consumer company, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I had my first checkup in a year with him</p>
<p>through video conference, and he was running blind.</p>
<p>He really didn&rsquo;t know what was going on with me.</p>
<p>He asked the usual things.</p>
<p>How am I sleeping?</p>
<p>How am I eating?</p>
<p>These kind of usual things.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I&rsquo;ve got new tests back</p>
<p>from inside tracker, and he said, great,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see them.</p>
<p>So I share screen, and we look at the graphs,</p>
<p>look at the data, and he&rsquo;s loving it,</p>
<p>because he cannot order these tests willy nilly.</p>
<p>So I said, well, let&rsquo;s order a HbA1c blood glucose levels,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m very interested in that.</p>
<p>That tracks with longevity.</p>
<p>And he said, well, I have no reason to order that.</p>
<p>Do you have a family history?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do you have any symptoms of diabetes?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t order the test.</p>
<p>I almost wanted to reach through the computer</p>
<p>and strangle him, but instead, I pay a little bit</p>
<p>to get these tests done, and then he looks at them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s now the way consumer health is going,</p>
<p>is that you can get better data than your doctor can,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;d like you to do that.</p>
<p>Quick human question, maybe you can educate me.</p>
<p>I think doctors sometimes have a bit of an ego.</p>
<p>I understand that the doctors super experience</p>
<p>a lot of things, but this is a fundamental question</p>
<p>of human variability.</p>
<p>Like, I know a lot of specific details about like,</p>
<p>I mean, it depends, of course, what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>but I bring a lot of knowledge, and if I have data with me,</p>
<p>then I have like several orders of magnitude more knowledge.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s an aspect to it where the doctor</p>
<p>has to put their expert hat, like take it off</p>
<p>and actually be a curious, open minded person</p>
<p>and study and look at that data.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to sort of change the culture</p>
<p>of the medical system to where the doctors are almost,</p>
<p>as you said, are excited to see the data?</p>
<p>Or is that already happening?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really happening.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve probably lost the last generation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re no hopers, but so I teach at Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re excited about this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re excited about aging,</p>
<p>which is a new aspect to medicine.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, we can do something about that.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, all this data, what do we do with it?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still the traditional pathology and all that stuff,</p>
<p>which they need to know, but time will change their mindset.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about that.</p>
<p>And like we were discussing, this isn&rsquo;t a question of if,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a matter of when.</p>
<p>And I have a front row seat on all of this.</p>
<p>I had breakfast with a CEO who is making this happen</p>
<p>just yesterday.</p>
<p>I can tell you for sure that most people have no idea</p>
<p>that this revolution is occurring</p>
<p>and is happening so quickly.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running a hospital and you can save $2,000</p>
<p>per cardiac patient, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>You have to use it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the hospital down the road</p>
<p>is going to be beating you.</p>
<p>And there are large hospital aggregations,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s Ascension and others,</p>
<p>that just have to go this way for budgetary reasons.</p>
<p>And right now, the US spends 17% of their GDP on healthcare.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say one of these buttons on my chest costs $20.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rechargeable.</p>
<p>And it can predict people&rsquo;s health</p>
<p>and save on antibiotics to prevent heart attacks.</p>
<p>How many billions, if not trillions of dollars,</p>
<p>will that save over the next decade?</p>
<p>Yeah, so when the public wakes up to this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll almost demand it.</p>
<p>Like, this should be accepted everywhere.</p>
<p>This is obvious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to save a lot of money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>Well, and the CFOs of hospital groups will have to.</p>
<p>And insurance companies are going to want to get in on this.</p>
<p>So now that gets to privacy, right?</p>
<p>Should an insurance company have access to your data?</p>
<p>I would say no.</p>
<p>But you could voluntarily show them some of it</p>
<p>if they give you a discount.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also being worked on right now.</p>
<p>I hope we do create kind of systems</p>
<p>where I can volunteer to share my data</p>
<p>and I can also take the data back,</p>
<p>meaning like delete the data, request deletion of data.</p>
<p>And then maybe policy creates rules</p>
<p>to where you can share data, you could delete the data.</p>
<p>And I think if I have the option to delete all my data</p>
<p>that a particular company has,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll share my data with everyone.</p>
<p>I feel like if, because that gives me the tools</p>
<p>to be a consumer, an intelligent consumer,</p>
<p>of awarding my data to a company that deserves it</p>
<p>and taking it back when the company is misbehaving.</p>
<p>And in that way, encourage,</p>
<p>as a consumer in the capitalist system,</p>
<p>encourage the companies that are doing great work</p>
<p>with that data.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, healthcare data security is number one.</p>
<p>On my mind, InsideTracker made sure that that was true.</p>
<p>But these buttons on your chest,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very private stuff they can probably tell</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re having sex one night, right?</p>
<p>So this is not the kind of stuff you want leaked.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s blockchain or something.</p>
<p>Speak for yourself.</p>
<p>I want this public.</p>
<p>The live stream.</p>
<p>I guess it depends on how you go.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff you don&rsquo;t want out there.</p>
<p>And this definitely has to be number one</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one thing to have your credit card</p>
<p>information stolen, it&rsquo;s another thing</p>
<p>your health records are permanently out there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, on the biology side,</p>
<p>super exciting ways to slow aging.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also on the lifestyle side.</p>
<p>I recently did a 72 hour fast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an opportunity to take a pause</p>
<p>and appreciate life.</p>
<p>Think about, there&rsquo;s something about fasting</p>
<p>that encourages you to reflect deeper</p>
<p>than you otherwise might.</p>
<p>The time kind of slows.</p>
<p>And you also realize that you&rsquo;re human</p>
<p>because your body needs food.</p>
<p>And you start to see your body&rsquo;s almost as a machine</p>
<p>that takes food and produces thoughts.</p>
<p>And then ends briefly.</p>
<p>I mean, you start to, depending who you are,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like engineering minded,</p>
<p>you start to think of this whole thing</p>
<p>as a kind of, yeah, as a machine.</p>
<p>And then also feelings fill this machine.</p>
<p>Feelings of gratitude, of love,</p>
<p>but also the uglier things of jealousy</p>
<p>and greed and hate and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>You start to think, okay, how do I manage this body</p>
<p>to create a rich experience?</p>
<p>All of that comes from fasting for me.</p>
<p>Anyway, but there&rsquo;s also health benefits to fasting.</p>
<p>I intermittent fast a lot.</p>
<p>I eat just one meal a day most of the time.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say</p>
<p>about the benefits of fasting in your own life</p>
<p>and in general the anti aging process?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re a philosopher too.</p>
<p>Sorry, I apologize.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m impressed.</p>
<p>True Renaissance man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joy to be here.</p>
<p>So when it comes to fasting, this is,</p>
<p>being abstemious is one of the oldest ways</p>
<p>to improve health.</p>
<p>Probably they knew this 5,000 plus years ago.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not new.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re figuring out is what is optimal</p>
<p>and how does it work?</p>
<p>And one of the things we help contribute to,</p>
<p>which I can speak to with some authority</p>
<p>is that these longevity genes we work on,</p>
<p>we showed back in the early 2000s</p>
<p>are turned on by fasting.</p>
<p>And at least in yeast, we were the first to show</p>
<p>that how calorie restriction fasting works</p>
<p>to extend lifespan.</p>
<p>And that was the first for any species.</p>
<p>Something similar happens in our bodies.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re hungry or put our bodies</p>
<p>under any other perceived adversity,</p>
<p>such as running, our bodies think,</p>
<p>wow, we&rsquo;re getting chased by a saber tooth cat or something.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re really hot or cold, these probably also work.</p>
<p>To put our bodies in this defensive state,</p>
<p>to activate these genes in the way that whales do</p>
<p>and mice don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so hunger is the best way to do that.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t think you have to feel hungry.</p>
<p>You can get used to it.</p>
<p>But if there was one thing I would recommend</p>
<p>to anybody to slow down aging</p>
<p>would be to skip a meal or two a day.</p>
<p>Now it doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t have to live well.</p>
<p>You can go out.</p>
<p>I go to restaurants, I eat regular food.</p>
<p>I try to be as healthy as possible.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve gone from skipping breakfast most of my life</p>
<p>now just skipping lunch as well.</p>
<p>And I have my physique back that I had when I was 20.</p>
<p>I feel 20 mentally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much sharper.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel tired anymore.</p>
<p>I sleep well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the one meal a day thing.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m not good at is going beyond one day.</p>
<p>But if you do three days.</p>
<p>Have you ever fasted longer than 24 hours?</p>
<p>I tried doing two days.</p>
<p>I might have made it to the third and given up.</p>
<p>I just find that I&rsquo;m not very,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot of willpower.</p>
<p>I also hate exercise.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure how long I&rsquo;m gonna live.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve managed to do one meal a day.</p>
<p>So if I can do that, seriously, anybody can do that.</p>
<p>To your listeners and viewers, I would say,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try to do it all at once.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go from snacking and eating three meals a day</p>
<p>to what I do easily.</p>
<p>Work your way up to it, but also compensate with drinking.</p>
<p>If you like tea, if you like coffee, put some milk in it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You can fill your stomach up with liquids,</p>
<p>diet sodas, I get criticized for drinking,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna continue to have those.</p>
<p>But then I power through the day.</p>
<p>I definitely don&rsquo;t feel tired.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a lag anymore.</p>
<p>But also give it at least two weeks</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a habit as well.</p>
<p>Having something in your mouth, chewing,</p>
<p>feeling that fullness, you can break that habit.</p>
<p>And within two, three weeks, you&rsquo;ll have done it.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not actually even that strict about it.</p>
<p>You said diet soda.</p>
<p>Yeah, people are very kind of weirdly strict</p>
<p>about fasting, the rules in fasting.</p>
<p>Like for example, I drank Element electrolytes</p>
<p>when I was fasting, and that has like five calories.</p>
<p>And so technically it&rsquo;s not fasting.</p>
<p>Or people will say like, if you drink coffee,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s caffeine, and they&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s technically not fasting</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some kind of biological effects</p>
<p>of caffeine, but whatever.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s like biological benefits</p>
<p>that you can argue about,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also just experiential benefits.</p>
<p>Just calorie restriction broadly has a certain experience</p>
<p>to it that, like for me personally,</p>
<p>just as you said, has made me feel really good.</p>
<p>That said, especially, I&rsquo;ve gained quite a bit of weight,</p>
<p>maybe even like 15 pounds, something like that,</p>
<p>since I moved to Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>And I still keep the same diet,</p>
<p>but I eat a lot of meat in that one,</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s delicious,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also the amazing people I met in Texas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s like a camaraderie,</p>
<p>a friendship, a love to the people</p>
<p>that like makes you really enjoy</p>
<p>the atmosphere of eating the brisket and the meat.</p>
<p>Is this Joe Rogan insisting?</p>
<p>Joe is, I mean, he&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>Joe loves bread and pasta.</p>
<p>Like he knows that his body feels best</p>
<p>doing keto or carnivore.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what he usually tries to stick to,</p>
<p>but he also does not hold back,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll just eat pasta when he eats pasta,</p>
<p>and he sort of enjoys life in that way.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy life in that way.</p>
<p>I also love pasta, but I&rsquo;m just not going to enjoy it,</p>
<p>because I know my body ultimately</p>
<p>does not feel good with pasta.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a funny kind of dichotomies.</p>
<p>I would like to cheat, I guess,</p>
<p>by eating more meat than I, you know, like overeating</p>
<p>on the things that I know my body feels good on</p>
<p>as opposed to eating stuff I shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>like cake and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I tend to find happiness in overeating the good stuff</p>
<p>versus eating the bad stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of balance.</p>
<p>Him, he&rsquo;s like, fuck it.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, you gotta enjoy it.</p>
<p>And then also coupled with that for him</p>
<p>is just exercise, like then face his demons the next day</p>
<p>and just like burn a huge amount of calories,</p>
<p>which is, I mean, whatever&rsquo;s up with that guy&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an, there&rsquo;s a ability to fully experience life,</p>
<p>which is represented by the pasta,</p>
<p>and the ability to just like fight the demons,</p>
<p>which is represented by all the crazy kettle balls</p>
<p>and running the hills and all this kind of stuff</p>
<p>that he does.</p>
<p>That takes a lot out of you doing</p>
<p>that kind of insane exercise.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m more like you,</p>
<p>or at least towards your direction is like,</p>
<p>I really hate exercise.</p>
<p>So I do it, but I really hate it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a balance that you have to strike.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say about the diet side of that</p>
<p>for you personally, but in general,</p>
<p>in order to achieve calorie restriction,</p>
<p>like for me, eating, I know it may not sound healthy,</p>
<p>but eating carnivore, eating mostly meat</p>
<p>has been, has made me feel really good,</p>
<p>both mentally and physically.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say about the kinds of diets</p>
<p>that may improve longevity,</p>
<p>but also enable calorie restriction?</p>
<p>Well, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, the first thing that&rsquo;s important to know</p>
<p>is that while many people are interested slash obsessed</p>
<p>with what they eat,</p>
<p>the data that&rsquo;s come out of animal studies at least</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s far more important when you eat than what you eat.</p>
<p>And this was a fantastic study a few years ago</p>
<p>by my friend, Rafael de Cabo</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda.</p>
<p>And he had 10,000 mice on different diets,</p>
<p>hoping to find the perfect mix of carbs, protein, and fat.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the only ones that lived longer</p>
<p>are the ones that only ate once a day.</p>
<p>And so that, if we&rsquo;re not mice,</p>
<p>but I think that we&rsquo;re close enough to mice</p>
<p>that this tells us a lot.</p>
<p>But okay, but I still think the best bang</p>
<p>for the longevity buck is to do both well,</p>
<p>eat less often and eat the right things.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll preface this to say, I&rsquo;m not a nut about this.</p>
<p>I will eat occasional, very occasionally a dessert.</p>
<p>Usually I steal from others, which doesn&rsquo;t count, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But you gotta live life, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a long life if it&rsquo;s not enjoyable anyway?</p>
<p>But what I also found, and this is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get to your question in a second,</p>
<p>but my microbiome right now and stomach is at a point</p>
<p>where if I try to overeat on a steak,</p>
<p>which I did a couple of days ago,</p>
<p>I actually had a chicken, a fried chicken specifically,</p>
<p>for two days, I felt terrible.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, it wouldn&rsquo;t go down.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now at a point where even if I want to binge</p>
<p>on meat and fried foods, I just can&rsquo;t, it just feels bad.</p>
<p>But what do I recommend?</p>
<p>Well, what the data says, which I try to follow,</p>
<p>is that plant based foods will be better</p>
<p>than meat based foods.</p>
<p>And I know that there are a lot of people who disagree.</p>
<p>But one of the facts is, well, there&rsquo;s a few facts.</p>
<p>One is that people who live a long time</p>
<p>tend to eat those type of diets.</p>
<p>Mediterranean, Okinawa diet,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eating mostly plants with a little bit of meat</p>
<p>and not a lot of red meat.</p>
<p>And the other fact is that in animals we know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a mechanism that&rsquo;s called mTOR,</p>
<p>little m, capital TOR, that responds to certain amino acids</p>
<p>that are found in more abundance in meat.</p>
<p>And when it responds, it actually shortens lifespan.</p>
<p>And the converse, if you starve it</p>
<p>of those three amino acids, mostly in meat,</p>
<p>then it extends lifespan.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a drug called rapamycin,</p>
<p>which some people are experimenting with, that does that.</p>
<p>So you might be able to, I&rsquo;m just saying this here</p>
<p>from all my colleagues, we don&rsquo;t know the results here,</p>
<p>but you could potentially take a rapamycin like drug</p>
<p>and counteract the effects of meat in the long run.</p>
<p>Dono, we should try that actually,</p>
<p>we could do that in the lab.</p>
<p>But getting to the bottom of this,</p>
<p>what I think is going on is that</p>
<p>just like testosterone and growth hormone,</p>
<p>you will get temporary, maybe not temporary,</p>
<p>immediate health benefits.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll feel great, you&rsquo;ll get more muscle energy.</p>
<p>But the problem is I think it&rsquo;s at the expense</p>
<p>of longterm health and longevity.</p>
<p>Well, this is actually something I worry about</p>
<p>in terms of longterm effects or the cost</p>
<p>in terms of longevity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to know how your choices</p>
<p>affect your longevity because the impact is down the line.</p>
<p>Like just because something makes me feel good now,</p>
<p>like eating only meat makes me feel good now,</p>
<p>I wonder what are the costs down the line.</p>
<p>Well, think about what I was saying about the trade offs</p>
<p>between growth and reproduction,</p>
<p>which is what a mouse does and a whale</p>
<p>that grows slowly, reproduces slowly, lives a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the disposable soma theory.</p>
<p>Koch would just propose that in the 70s.</p>
<p>What meat probably does is put you in the mouse category,</p>
<p>super fertile, grow fast, heal fast.</p>
<p>And then if you wanna be a whale,</p>
<p>you should restrict meat and do things</p>
<p>that promote the preservation of your body.</p>
<p>Is it difficult to eat a plant based diet</p>
<p>that you perform well under?</p>
<p>So mentally and physically, just almost,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking almost like an anecdotal question</p>
<p>or unless you know the science.</p>
<p>Well, the science is still being worked out,</p>
<p>but from the synthesis of everything that I&rsquo;ve read,</p>
<p>I try to eat a diet that&rsquo;s definitely full of leafy greens,</p>
<p>particularly spinach is great</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s got the iron that we need, plenty of vitamins.</p>
<p>I also try to avoid too much fruit and berries,</p>
<p>particularly fruit juice,</p>
<p>definitely avoid that sugar high.</p>
<p>Spiking your sugar is not healthy in the long run.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>is we discovered what we called xenohormetic molecules.</p>
<p>Let me unpack that because it&rsquo;s a terrible name</p>
<p>and I take full responsibility</p>
<p>with my friend, Conrad Howards.</p>
<p>The Xeno means cross species</p>
<p>and hormesis is the term that what doesn&rsquo;t kill you</p>
<p>makes you live longer and be healthier.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re getting cross species health improvements</p>
<p>by molecules that plants make.</p>
<p>And plants make these molecules</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re also under adversity or perceived adversity.</p>
<p>For instance, I understand</p>
<p>if you want really healthy, good oranges,</p>
<p>you can drive nails into the bark of the tree</p>
<p>before you harvest.</p>
<p>Same with wine, you typically want them to be dry</p>
<p>before you harvest or covered in fungus.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because these plants make these colorful</p>
<p>and xenohormetic molecules</p>
<p>that make themselves stress resistant,</p>
<p>turn on their sirtuin defenses, the serogenes remember.</p>
<p>And when we eat them, we get those same benefits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the idea and we&rsquo;ve evolved to do so.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a coincidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my theory, our theory that we want to know</p>
<p>when our food supply is under adversity</p>
<p>because we need to get ready for a famine.</p>
<p>And so we hunker down and preserve our body</p>
<p>and by eating these colored foods,</p>
<p>so practically speaking, if it&rsquo;s full of color</p>
<p>or if there&rsquo;s been some chewing by a caterpillar,</p>
<p>organic, grown locally in local farms,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll eat that versus a watery, insipid, light colored lettuce</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been grown in California.</p>
<p>So you want vegetables that have suffered.</p>
<p>You want the David Goggins as a vegetables.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the xenohormetic molecules.</p>
<p>I love that term.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take that one with me, thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, I follow him on Instagram, he&rsquo;s always screaming.</p>
<p>So you want that he&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>the xenohormetic version of a human.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>So these are the molecules that are representative</p>
<p>of the stress that a plant has been under.</p>
<p>Yeah, the best example of that is resveratrol,</p>
<p>which many people, including myself,</p>
<p>take as a supplement.</p>
<p>Grapes, grapevines produce that in abundance</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re dried out or they have too much light</p>
<p>or fungus and that we&rsquo;ve shown activates</p>
<p>the Sertu enzyme in our bodies,</p>
<p>which remember is what extends lifespan in yeast</p>
<p>and slows down aging in the brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tend to avoid fruit as well.</p>
<p>So green, veggies, anything that&rsquo;s not very sweet.</p>
<p>So I would just say you&rsquo;re relatively low,</p>
<p>like you try to avoid sugary things as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m fairly militant about that.</p>
<p>I rarely would add sugar to anything.</p>
<p>Occasionally I would eat a slice of cheesecake,</p>
<p>but that would be maybe once or twice a year.</p>
<p>You have to give in occasionally.</p>
<p>But yeah, anything that&rsquo;s sweet,</p>
<p>I would rather substitute something like Stevia</p>
<p>if I need a sugar hit.</p>
<p>What about exercise?</p>
<p>Your favorite topic.</p>
<p>Is there a part?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind talking about it.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Is there benefits to longevity from exercise?</p>
<p>Well, no doubt, that&rsquo;s proven.</p>
<p>Just like fasting, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that that works.</p>
<p>For example, there are studies of cyclists.</p>
<p>It was something like people that cycle</p>
<p>over 80 miles a week have a 40% reduction</p>
<p>in a variety of diseases, certainly heart disease.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not even a question,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s interesting is that we&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t need much to have a big benefit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an asymptotic curve.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you overdo it,</p>
<p>you probably have reduced benefits,</p>
<p>particularly if you start to wear out joints,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But just 10 minutes on a treadmill a few times a week,</p>
<p>lose your breath, get hypoxic, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>seems to be very beneficial for longterm health.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of exercise that I like to do, aerobic.</p>
<p>Though I do enjoy lifting weights,</p>
<p>so that is what I call my exercise,</p>
<p>which has other benefits,</p>
<p>including maintaining hormone levels, male hormone levels.</p>
<p>But also really why I do it is I want to be able</p>
<p>to counteract the effects of sitting for most of the day.</p>
<p>And as you get older, you lose muscle mass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a percent or so a year.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna be frail when I&rsquo;m older</p>
<p>and fall over and break my hip,</p>
<p>which happens every 20 seconds in this country.</p>
<p>So maintaining that strength,</p>
<p>but also doing the cardio for the longevity,</p>
<p>for avoiding the heart disease.</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely, just like with fasting,</p>
<p>have the philosophical benefit of running long</p>
<p>and running slow.</p>
<p>I enjoy it, because it kind of clears the mind</p>
<p>and allows you to think,</p>
<p>and actually listen to brown noise as I run.</p>
<p>It really helps remove myself from the world</p>
<p>and just like zoom in on particular thoughts.</p>
<p>What are these brown noise?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like white noise, but deeper.</p>
<p>So like the white noise is like shh,</p>
<p>and then brown noise is more like,</p>
<p>shh, like ocean.</p>
<p>That sounds great.</p>
<p>I might try that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s more soothing probably.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>There could be science to this.</p>
<p>I need to look this up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to.</p>
<p>But when I started,</p>
<p>this is maybe like five years ago,</p>
<p>I started listening to brown noise when I work.</p>
<p>And the first time I listened to it,</p>
<p>something happened to my mind</p>
<p>where it just went like zoomed in</p>
<p>to like, in a way that it felt like really weird.</p>
<p>Like how precisely it was able to sort of</p>
<p>remove the distractions of the world</p>
<p>and really help my mind.</p>
<p>Obviously, like the mind is trying to focus</p>
<p>and then it just enabled that process</p>
<p>of trying to focus on a particular problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is generalizable to others.</p>
<p>People should definitely try it</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re listening to this.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just my own mind,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s funny, like it made me,</p>
<p>brown noise made me realize</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s probably hacks out there</p>
<p>that work for me</p>
<p>that I should be constantly looking for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like an encouraging</p>
<p>and motivating event</p>
<p>that maybe there&rsquo;s other stuff out there.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s other brown noise like things out there</p>
<p>that truly like almost immediately make me feel better.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s generalizable to others,</p>
<p>but it does seem that it&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s probably for many others,</p>
<p>things like that that could be discovered.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s always disappointing</p>
<p>when I find things in life</p>
<p>that I wish I would have found earlier.</p>
<p>I got LASIK eye surgery a few years ago</p>
<p>and the first thought I had like the next day</p>
<p>when I woke up is like,</p>
<p>damn it, why didn&rsquo;t I do this way earlier?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this stuff of that nature</p>
<p>that are yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>So it pays to explore.</p>
<p>You have a different mind, you have quite a beautiful mind.</p>
<p>So I suspect brown noise helps you focus</p>
<p>and cause you&rsquo;re probably all over the place</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t control it.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It means something about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a programmer thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, programming is a really difficult mental journey</p>
<p>cause you have to keep a lot of things in mind.</p>
<p>You have to, so you&rsquo;re constantly designing things</p>
<p>then you have to be extremely precise</p>
<p>by making those things concrete in code.</p>
<p>You also have to look stuff up on the internet</p>
<p>to sort of feed like information</p>
<p>and looking up stuff on the internet,</p>
<p>internet is full of like distracting things.</p>
<p>So you have to be really focused</p>
<p>in the way you look stuff up in pulling that information in.</p>
<p>So it requires a certain discipline and a certain focus</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been very much exploring how to do.</p>
<p>Like I do it really well in the morning,</p>
<p>coffee is involved, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to optimize, keeping very positive inspired,</p>
<p>no social media, all those kinds of things</p>
<p>and trying to optimize for.</p>
<p>And everybody has their own kind of little journey</p>
<p>that they try to understand.</p>
<p>You get this from like writers</p>
<p>when you read about the habits of writers,</p>
<p>like the habits they do in the morning,</p>
<p>they usually write like two, three, four hours a day</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they optimize that ritual.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s always Hunter S. Thompson.</p>
<p>So sometimes it pays off to be wild.</p>
<p>What about sleep?</p>
<p>How important is sleep for longevity?</p>
<p>I would guess based on the evidence</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>and because we don&rsquo;t know for sure.</p>
<p>But what we know from animal studies is the following.</p>
<p>If you restrict sleep from a rat for just two weeks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll develop type two diabetes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that important.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the main thing.</p>
<p>What we also know is at the molecular level</p>
<p>that if you disrupt your sleep wake cycle,</p>
<p>so we actually have proteins that go up and down</p>
<p>that control our sleep wake.</p>
<p>All of us, most of our cells do that.</p>
<p>If you disrupt that, you&rsquo;ll get premature aging.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>The opposite is true.</p>
<p>That as you get older, that cycle,</p>
<p>the amplitude becomes diminished.</p>
<p>And this is why it&rsquo;s harder to get to sleep</p>
<p>as you get older</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s going on is this positive feedback loop,</p>
<p>which is a disaster in your old age,</p>
<p>which is you&rsquo;re aging,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t at this moment totally prevent that.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s disrupting your sleep</p>
<p>and you get not enough sleep</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s gonna accelerate your aging process.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s known that the people who are shift workers</p>
<p>are most susceptible to certain age related diseases.</p>
<p>So your bottom line, you definitely wanna work on that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I have this ring on my finger,</p>
<p>which helps me optimize my sleep</p>
<p>and learn what I do the day before,</p>
<p>if it was a bad idea and I&rsquo;ll stop doing that,</p>
<p>like eating a fried chicken.</p>
<p>I see you&rsquo;re still carrying the burdens of that decision.</p>
<p>But yeah, sleep is one of those things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s making me wonder about the variability</p>
<p>between humans a little bit</p>
<p>and how science is often focused on,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not often focused on high performers</p>
<p>in a particular way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s looking at the aggregate</p>
<p>versus the individual cases.</p>
<p>For example, like for me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the exact hours are,</p>
<p>but like power naps are incredible.</p>
<p>I tend to look at the metric of stress and happiness and joy</p>
<p>and try to optimize those.</p>
<p>So decreasing stress, increasing happiness</p>
<p>and using sleep as just one of the tools to do that.</p>
<p>Because like hitting the five, six, seven, eight,</p>
<p>nine hour mark or whatever the correct mark is,</p>
<p>I find that to be stress inducing for me</p>
<p>versus stress relieving.</p>
<p>Like thinking about that,</p>
<p>I feel best if I sleep sometimes for eight hours,</p>
<p>sometimes for four hours and then power nap.</p>
<p>And as long as I have a stupid private,</p>
<p>usually smile on my face,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m doing good,</p>
<p>as opposed to getting a perfect amount of sleep</p>
<p>according to whatever the latest blog post is.</p>
<p>And I also pull all nighters still.</p>
<p>I also think there&rsquo;s something about the body,</p>
<p>like as long as you do it regularly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as stress inducing.</p>
<p>Like you know what it is.</p>
<p>The reason I pull all nighters isn&rsquo;t for like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing Diablo three or something,</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;m doing something I&rsquo;m truly passionate about.</p>
<p>Well, like I&rsquo;m also love video games,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m doing something I&rsquo;m truly passionate about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like there&rsquo;s the Jocko Willing feeling</p>
<p>of when I&rsquo;m up at 7 a.m. and I haven&rsquo;t slept all night</p>
<p>and still I&rsquo;m working on it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of a celebration of the human spirit</p>
<p>that I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>Like, and that&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>And to sort of then,</p>
<p>and I usually don&rsquo;t tell that kind of stuff to people</p>
<p>because their first statement will be like,</p>
<p>you should get more sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, I&rsquo;m doing stuff I love.</p>
<p>You should get more love in your life, bro.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So, but that said, in aggregate,</p>
<p>when you look at the full span of life,</p>
<p>is probably you should be getting</p>
<p>a consistent amount of sleep.</p>
<p>And it seems like it&rsquo;s in that seven, eight hour range.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s similar to food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the quality, not the quantity, right?</p>
<p>And when you get it.</p>
<p>So I look at my data pretty often.</p>
<p>And what makes a difference to me is not the amount of hours,</p>
<p>but the quality, the depth and the deep sleep</p>
<p>is what will do it.</p>
<p>So if I have a lot of alcohol before going to sleep</p>
<p>and I can see my heart rate being different,</p>
<p>but what really kills me is that I don&rsquo;t get a lot</p>
<p>of that deep sleep and I wake up barely remembering stuff.</p>
<p>So that, like you say, if you&rsquo;re happy and contented</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have these cortisol chemicals</p>
<p>going through your body,</p>
<p>you will more naturally get into that deep state.</p>
<p>And even if you just get four hours,</p>
<p>way better than eight hours of none of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And some of that could be genetic.</p>
<p>For me, I just, I fall asleep like this.</p>
<p>If you want me to fall asleep right now, I can do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no, I have no problem with it.</p>
<p>Combined with coffee, I just had two energy drinks.</p>
<p>I can probably sleep.</p>
<p>So that, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s genetics</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s kind of, I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>Or maybe that I don&rsquo;t have kids and I&rsquo;m single.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have, I&rsquo;m almost listening</p>
<p>to some kind of biological signal versus societal signal</p>
<p>on when I&rsquo;m supposed to go to sleep.</p>
<p>So I just go to sleep whenever I feel like going to sleep.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a self employed.</p>
<p>Self employed.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t have that luxury,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re lucky, the two of us,</p>
<p>that we can make our own hours.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>And those people who have shift work,</p>
<p>I mean, they really need to change the way that works</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re literally killing those people.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say about the,</p>
<p>the mind and stress in terms of effect on longevity?</p>
<p>Sort of, I don&rsquo;t know if you think about it this way,</p>
<p>but when you talk about the biological machine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always these mechanisms that don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>are not necessarily directly connected to the brain</p>
<p>or the operation of the brain.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the role about stress and happiness</p>
<p>and yeah, the sort of higher cognitive things</p>
<p>going on in the brain on longevity.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a great point that the brain</p>
<p>is the center for longevity.</p>
<p>Actually, we do know that.</p>
<p>For a start, when I&rsquo;m stressed,</p>
<p>I can see mentally stressed,</p>
<p>then I can see it in my body.</p>
<p>Heart rate, hormones, it&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no true surprise.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to work on your brain first and foremost.</p>
<p>If you are totally freaked out, agitated all the time,</p>
<p>you will live shorter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain of it.</p>
<p>You know, I keep fish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big aquarium guy.</p>
<p>And you can see the difference</p>
<p>between the fish that&rsquo;s having a good time and dominant</p>
<p>and one that gets picked on.</p>
<p>It just looks like crap.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be that,</p>
<p>the little fish getting picked on if you can help it.</p>
<p>So I used to be extremely stressed as a kid.</p>
<p>I was a perfectionist, very shy,</p>
<p>always worried about being a failure.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t get an A+, you know,</p>
<p>I was crying in my bedroom, that kind of sad existence.</p>
<p>I got into my twenties, then in my thirties,</p>
<p>and realized that&rsquo;s not the way to live.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve worked very hard to get to this point</p>
<p>where I almost never get stressed, never.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that, I&rsquo;ve never gotten angry in my lab.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got 20 kids.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s like a,</p>
<p>most of the time it&rsquo;s like a kindergarten.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t lost my temper.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very calm, but that&rsquo;s intentional.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t worry about stuff.</p>
<p>Millions of dollars, billions of dollars at stake sometimes.</p>
<p>Keep it cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all headed to the same place anyway.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>But to answer your question, I think in a better way,</p>
<p>if you manipulate the brain of an animal,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>If we turn on this CERT gene that I mentioned,</p>
<p>CERT1, we, a good friend of mine at WashU,</p>
<p>Sheena Mai did this.</p>
<p>They upregulated that gene</p>
<p>just in the neurons of the animal.</p>
<p>It lived longer.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sufficient to extend lifespan.</p>
<p>We also know that you can manipulate the part of the brain</p>
<p>called the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which leeches a lot of chemicals into the body and proteins,</p>
<p>most of which we don&rsquo;t know yet,</p>
<p>but just changing the inflammation of that little organ</p>
<p>or part of the brain is sufficient</p>
<p>to make animals live longer as well.</p>
<p>So get your brain in order first</p>
<p>before you tackle anything else, I would say.</p>
<p>So you kind of mentioned this,</p>
<p>with the inside tracker, there&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to take blood measurement and then infer from that</p>
<p>a bunch of different things about your body</p>
<p>and how you can improve the longevity.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve also mentioned saliva</p>
<p>and more efficient ways to get data.</p>
<p>What does that involve?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the future of data collection look like</p>
<p>for the human biological system?</p>
<p>Right, well, yeah, the issue with blood is</p>
<p>you need someone to take it.</p>
<p>I mean, or you prick your finger, which hurts.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to have something better.</p>
<p>So I think what the future looks like</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;ll spit onto a little piece of paper</p>
<p>and stick it in a machine and it&rsquo;ll do that for you.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>So the intermediate future that I&rsquo;m building right now</p>
<p>is that you would take a swab of the inside of your mouth,</p>
<p>which is the easiest way to take cells out of your body</p>
<p>and just ship them off.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s called a buckle swab.</p>
<p>I think we became very used to that.</p>
<p>Right now, because of COVID,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t like going to the doctor as much.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like going out.</p>
<p>They just want to have home tests.</p>
<p>And so that I think is the next 10 years</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ll get a kit in the mail,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll swab your cheeks, stick it back in an envelope,</p>
<p>send it off and a week later you have</p>
<p>either a doctor&rsquo;s report or a health recommendation.</p>
<p>And what can you get off a cheek swab?</p>
<p>Well, you can get anything.</p>
<p>You can get hormones, stress levels,</p>
<p>stress hormones, blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>You can also tell your age reasonably accurately doing that,</p>
<p>actually quite accurately.</p>
<p>And those clocks can not just tell you</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re doing over time,</p>
<p>but can be used to give you recommendations</p>
<p>to slow that process down.</p>
<p>Cause some people sometimes are 10 years older biologically</p>
<p>than their actual chronological age.</p>
<p>I mean, why does it matter how many times</p>
<p>the earth&rsquo;s gone around the sun seriously?</p>
<p>Who cares about birthdays?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how long your body&rsquo;s clock has been ticking</p>
<p>and how fast.</p>
<p>So I could take a cheek swab from you today, Lex,</p>
<p>take it back to my lab.</p>
<p>And we then by tomorrow tell you</p>
<p>how old you are biologically based on</p>
<p>what we call the epigenetic clock.</p>
<p>And you might be freaked out, you might be happy,</p>
<p>but either way we can advise you</p>
<p>on how to improve the trajectory.</p>
<p>Cause we know that smoking increases</p>
<p>the speed of that clock.</p>
<p>We also know that fasting and people who eat the right foods</p>
<p>have a slower clock.</p>
<p>Without that knowledge, you&rsquo;re flying blind.</p>
<p>But I like the idea of a swab,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s just so easy.</p>
<p>A lot of us have done something like that for COVID tests.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a nonstop rapid antigen test.</p>
<p>So let me say that particular one rapid antigen test,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been a source of frustration for me</p>
<p>because like everybody should be doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also been working in my lab on democratizing</p>
<p>these tests to bring them down from a few hundred bucks</p>
<p>to a dollar.</p>
<p>So just to clarify,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about not research,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about like company stuff,</p>
<p>like actual consumer facing things?</p>
<p>Well, right.</p>
<p>The research on bringing the price down</p>
<p>has occurred in my lab at Harvard.</p>
<p>And then that intellectual property is being licensed</p>
<p>and has been licensed out to a company</p>
<p>that will be consumer facing.</p>
<p>So anybody for a small amount of money can do this.</p>
<p>Well, you got subscriber number one obsessed.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a beautiful, beautiful idea.</p>
<p>So somebody who maybe I would have been more hesitant</p>
<p>about it until COVID,</p>
<p>but the home tests are super easy.</p>
<p>I almost wanted to share that data with the world,</p>
<p>like in some way, not the entirety of the data,</p>
<p>but like some visualization of like how I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s almost like when you share,</p>
<p>if you had like a long run or something like that,</p>
<p>I wish I could share because it inspires others.</p>
<p>And then you can have a conversation about like,</p>
<p>well, what are the hacks that you&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>and have a conversation about like how to improve lifestyle</p>
<p>and those kinds of things that&rsquo;s grounded in data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>Now, everything&rsquo;s anonymous, of course.</p>
<p>We talked about security there,</p>
<p>but once it&rsquo;s anonymized, you can then plot these numbers.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve plotted my epigenetic age</p>
<p>versus hundreds of other people</p>
<p>who have taken this test now.</p>
<p>And I can tell you where I fit relative to others</p>
<p>in terms of my biological age.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to share that with you</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pretty low.</p>
<p>You can choose to share it, of course,</p>
<p>not everyone wants to share that.</p>
<p>But when you go to the doctor,</p>
<p>first of all, your doctor does treat you</p>
<p>as though you&rsquo;re an average person</p>
<p>and none of us are average, there&rsquo;s no such thing.</p>
<p>But second of all, we never know</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re doing relative to others</p>
<p>because we all, most of us, we don&rsquo;t share our information.</p>
<p>So we might have this number and that number,</p>
<p>but do you know that your numbers are good for your age</p>
<p>or not?</p>
<p>You have no idea.</p>
<p>Even your doctor probably doesn&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>So this graph that I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>is the beginning of a world where you can say,</p>
<p>how am I doing?</p>
<p>For the two of us, we&rsquo;re white and we&rsquo;re male</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re this age and we do this.</p>
<p>Are we good?</p>
<p>Are we doing the right things or the wrong things?</p>
<p>Do we need to fix certain things?</p>
<p>And this is what the future is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s forget about just experimenting</p>
<p>and not knowing the result.</p>
<p>I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t experiment and doesn&rsquo;t look at the data?</p>
<p>No one, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna enter a world</p>
<p>where we have a dashboard on our body,</p>
<p>the swabs, the blood tests, the biosensors</p>
<p>where our doctors can look at that,</p>
<p>but we can also look at it and they can recommend,</p>
<p>go to this restaurant down the road.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got this great meal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high in whatever you need today</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re lacking vitamin D and vitamin K2.</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>Ridiculous question or perhaps not.</p>
<p>If you look maybe 50 years from now</p>
<p>or 100 years from now, a person born then,</p>
<p>what do you think is a good goal</p>
<p>in terms of how long a person would live?</p>
<p>What is the maximum longevity that we can achieve</p>
<p>through the methods that we have today</p>
<p>or are developing some of the things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about in terms of genetics,</p>
<p>in terms of biology?</p>
<p>Is there a number?</p>
<p>Right, well, so it changes all the time</p>
<p>because technology is changing so quickly.</p>
<p>I keep revising the number upward,</p>
<p>but I would say that if you do the right things</p>
<p>during your life and start at an early age,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 25, we don&rsquo;t want malnutrition, starvation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>But in your 20s, start eating the kind of diets</p>
<p>that I talked about, skipping meals.</p>
<p>In animals, that gives you an extra 20 to 30%.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true for humans</p>
<p>and even 5% more would be a big deal for the planet.</p>
<p>I think that we should all aim to at least reach a century.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit behind.</p>
<p>I was born too early to benefit the most</p>
<p>from all of this discovery.</p>
<p>Those of you who are in your 20s,</p>
<p>you should definitely aim to reach a hundred.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why not.</p>
<p>Consider this, this is really important.</p>
<p>The average lifespan of a human</p>
<p>that looks after themselves but doesn&rsquo;t pay attention</p>
<p>is about 80, okay?</p>
<p>Japan, that&rsquo;s the average age for a male, a bit higher.</p>
<p>If you do the right things in your life,</p>
<p>which is eat healthy food, don&rsquo;t overeat,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t become obese, do a bit of exercise,</p>
<p>get good sleep and don&rsquo;t stress,</p>
<p>that gives you on average 14 extra years.</p>
<p>That gets you to 94.</p>
<p>So getting to a hundred,</p>
<p>if you just focus on what I&rsquo;m talking about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the maximum?</p>
<p>Well, we know that one human made it to 122</p>
<p>and a number of them make it into their teens.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also the next level</p>
<p>of where we can get to with the types of technologies</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Medicines, like I mentioned rapamycin,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one called metformin, which is the diabetes drug,</p>
<p>which I take.</p>
<p>That in combination with these lifestyle changes</p>
<p>should get us beyond a hundred.</p>
<p>How long can we ultimately live?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no maximum limit to human lifespan.</p>
<p>Why can a whale live 300 years, but we cannot?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re basically the same structure.</p>
<p>We just need to learn from them.</p>
<p>So anyone who says, oh, you max out at X,</p>
<p>I think is full of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that I&rsquo;ve seen that says</p>
<p>biological organisms have to die.</p>
<p>There are trees that live for thousands of years</p>
<p>and their biochemistry is pretty close to ours.</p>
<p>What do you think it means to live for a very long time?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say if it&rsquo;s 200 years we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>or a thousand years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some sense, you could argue,</p>
<p>that there is immortal organisms already living on Earth,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s bacteria.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certain living organisms</p>
<p>that in some fundamental way do not die</p>
<p>because they keep replicating their genetic,</p>
<p>they keep like cloning themselves.</p>
<p>Is it the same human if we can somehow persist</p>
<p>the human mind, like copy, clone certain aspects</p>
<p>and just keep replacing body parts?</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s another way to achieve immortality?</p>
<p>To achieve a prolonged sort of increased longevity</p>
<p>is to replace the parts that break easily</p>
<p>and keep, because actually from your theory of aging</p>
<p>as a degradation of information,</p>
<p>so an information theory view of aging,</p>
<p>like what is the key information that makes a human?</p>
<p>Can we persist that information</p>
<p>and just replace the trivial parts?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean the short answer is yes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already replacing body parts</p>
<p>but what makes us human is our brain.</p>
<p>Everything else is suboptimal except our brain.</p>
<p>The ability to replace actual neurons is really hard.</p>
<p>I think it might be easy to upload</p>
<p>rather than replace neurons because they&rsquo;re so tight,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a network and just perturbing the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Roger and Gizcat.</p>
<p>You change everything once you get in there.</p>
<p>The problem is, well, I guess the solution,</p>
<p>let me go to the solution that&rsquo;s more interesting.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re learning is that if you reverse</p>
<p>the age of nerve cells,</p>
<p>it looks like they get their memories back.</p>
<p>So the memories are not lost.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just that the cells don&rsquo;t know how to interpret them</p>
<p>and function correctly.</p>
<p>And this is one of the things we&rsquo;re studying in my lab.</p>
<p>If you take an old mouse that has learned something</p>
<p>when it was young but forgotten, does it get that back?</p>
<p>And all evidence points to that being true.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d rather go in and rejuvenate the brain as it sits</p>
<p>rather than replace individual cells,</p>
<p>which would be really hard.</p>
<p>What do you think about like efforts like Neuralink,</p>
<p>which basically you mentioned uploading,</p>
<p>are trying to figure out,</p>
<p>so creating brain computer interfaces</p>
<p>that are trying to figure out</p>
<p>how to communicate with the brain.</p>
<p>But one of the features of that is trying to record</p>
<p>the human brain more and more accurately.</p>
<p>Do you have hope for that to,</p>
<p>of course, it will lead to us better understanding</p>
<p>from a neuroscience perspective, the human mind,</p>
<p>but do you have hope for it increasing longevity</p>
<p>in terms of how it&rsquo;s used?</p>
<p>I think that it can help with certain diseases.</p>
<p>But I see, at least within our lifetime,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best use of it is to be able to replace</p>
<p>parts of the body that are not functioning,</p>
<p>such as the retina and other parts,</p>
<p>the visual cortex back here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be doable.</p>
<p>In terms of longevity,</p>
<p>maybe we could put something on the hypothalamus</p>
<p>and start secreting those hormones and get that back.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think the best way to preserve the brain</p>
<p>is going to be to record it.</p>
<p>But also, I think it&rsquo;s going to require death,</p>
<p>unfortunately, to then do very detailed scans,</p>
<p>even if you have enough time and money, atomic microscopy,</p>
<p>and rebuild the brain from scratch.</p>
<p>Rebuild from scratch, yeah.</p>
<p>We are living more and more in a digital world.</p>
<p>I wonder if the scanning is good enough</p>
<p>for the critical things in terms of memories,</p>
<p>in terms of the particular quirks</p>
<p>of your cognitive processes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re not, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not close, yes,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve made quite a bit of progress,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re an exponential type of person.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, let&rsquo;s dream a little here.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>The way it would work, that I could see it working is,</p>
<p>so you take a single cell slice through your dead brain,</p>
<p>and we can now,</p>
<p>the problem with the engineering aspect is that,</p>
<p>the engineering is, the physical aspect of the brain</p>
<p>is not even half the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is which genes are switched on and off.</p>
<p>This experience that we&rsquo;re having here</p>
<p>is altering certain genes in neurons</p>
<p>that will be preserved, hopefully, for a number of decades,</p>
<p>but you cannot see that with a microscope easily,</p>
<p>but there are technologies invented,</p>
<p>actually just down the hall in the building I&rsquo;m at,</p>
<p>George Church invented a way, his lab invented a way,</p>
<p>to look at which genes are switched on and off,</p>
<p>not only in a single cell, which any lab can do these days,</p>
<p>but in situ, where it&rsquo;s situated in the brain.</p>
<p>So you can say, okay, this nerve cell,</p>
<p>had these genes switched on and these switched off,</p>
<p>we can recreate that,</p>
<p>but just scanning the brain</p>
<p>and looking how the nerves are touching each other</p>
<p>is not gonna do it.</p>
<p>Wow, okay.</p>
<p>So you have to scan the full biology, the full details.</p>
<p>And look at the epigenome.</p>
<p>And the epigenome too.</p>
<p>Yeah, which genes are on and off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just easier to reset the epigenome</p>
<p>and get them to work like they used to.</p>
<p>True, true.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing that now.</p>
<p>Use the hardware we already have,</p>
<p>just figure out how to make that hardware last longer.</p>
<p>Right, ultimately information will be lost,</p>
<p>even genetic information degrades slowly through mutation.</p>
<p>So immortality is not achievable through that means,</p>
<p>though I think we could potentially reset the body</p>
<p>hundreds of times and live for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Okay, so we talked about biology.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, forgive me, but let&rsquo;s talk about philosophy</p>
<p>for just a brief moment.</p>
<p>So somebody I&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading,</p>
<p>Ernest Becker wrote The Denial of Death.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also Martin Heidegger.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of philosophers who claim</p>
<p>that most people live life in denial of death.</p>
<p>Sort of we don&rsquo;t fully internalize</p>
<p>the idea that we&rsquo;re going to die.</p>
<p>Because if we did, as they say,</p>
<p>there will be a kind of terror of,</p>
<p>I mean a deep fear of death.</p>
<p>The fact that we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>like we almost don&rsquo;t know what to do with non existence,</p>
<p>with disappearing.</p>
<p>Like our, the way we draw meaning from life</p>
<p>seems to be grounded in the fact that we exist</p>
<p>and that we at some point will not exist is terrifying.</p>
<p>And so we live in an illusion that we&rsquo;re not going to die</p>
<p>and we run from that terror.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Ernest Becker would say.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s any truth to that?</p>
<p>Oh, I know there&rsquo;s truth to that.</p>
<p>I experience it every day when I talk to people.</p>
<p>We have to live that way.</p>
<p>Although unfortunately I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but for most people it&rsquo;s extremely distressing</p>
<p>to think about their own mortality.</p>
<p>We think about it occasionally.</p>
<p>And if we really thought about it every day,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d probably be brought to tears.</p>
<p>How much we not just miss ourselves,</p>
<p>but miss our family, our friends.</p>
<p>All living life forms have evolved to not want to die.</p>
<p>And when I mean want,</p>
<p>biochemically, genetically, physically.</p>
<p>That yeast cell, the cells that I studied at MIT,</p>
<p>they were fighting for their lives.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>but our brain has evolved the same survival aspect.</p>
<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t want to die.</p>
<p>But the problem for us, unfortunately,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a curse and a blessing is that we&rsquo;re now conscious.</p>
<p>We know that we&rsquo;re going to die.</p>
<p>Most species that have ever existed don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a burden, that&rsquo;s a curse.</p>
<p>And so what I think has happened is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve evolved certainly to want to live for a long time,</p>
<p>perhaps never want to die.</p>
<p>But the thought about dying is so traumatic</p>
<p>that there is an innate part of our brains.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably genetically wired to not think about it.</p>
<p>I really think that&rsquo;s part of being human.</p>
<p>Because, think about tribes that obsessed</p>
<p>with longevity every day and that we&rsquo;re going to die.</p>
<p>They probably didn&rsquo;t make much technological progress</p>
<p>because they were just crying in their huts every day</p>
<p>or on the Savannah.</p>
<p>So I really think that we&rsquo;ve evolved</p>
<p>to naturally deny aging.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the problems that I face in my career.</p>
<p>And when I speak publicly and on social media</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s shocking.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want to think about their age,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s getting better.</p>
<p>I think my book has helped.</p>
<p>These tests that we&rsquo;re developing</p>
<p>should help people understand it&rsquo;s not a problem</p>
<p>to think about your longterm health.</p>
<p>In fact, if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to reach 80 and really regret it.</p>
<p>And the other side of it, so again, Ernest Becker,</p>
<p>but also Viktor Frankl recommended highly</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning.</p>
<p>Bernard Williams is a moral philosopher.</p>
<p>They kind of argue that this knowledge of death,</p>
<p>even if we often don&rsquo;t contemplate it, we do at times.</p>
<p>And the very, what you call the curse,</p>
<p>which I agree with you, it&rsquo;s a curse and a blessing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re able to contemplate our own mortality.</p>
<p>That gives meaning to life.</p>
<p>So death gives meaning to life,</p>
<p>is what Viktor Frankl argues.</p>
<p>I would probably argue the same.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the scarcity of life</p>
<p>and contemplating that,</p>
<p>that makes each moment that much sweeter.</p>
<p>Is there something to that?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s individual.</p>
<p>In my case, it&rsquo;s completely wrong.</p>
<p>I appreciate you saying that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get joy out of every day</p>
<p>because I think I&rsquo;m going to die.</p>
<p>I get joy out of every day because every day is joyous</p>
<p>and I make it that way.</p>
<p>And even if I thought I was going to live forever,</p>
<p>I would still be enjoying this moment just as much.</p>
<p>And I bet you would too.</p>
<p>Well, I think about that a lot.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost afraid that I wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy it as much</p>
<p>if I was immortal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost afraid to want to be immortal or to live longer</p>
<p>because it perhaps is a kind of justification</p>
<p>for me to accept that I&rsquo;m going to die.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s saying like, oh, if I was immortal,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to enjoy life as much as I do.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very possible that I would enjoy just as much.</p>
<p>Of course, enjoying life, whether you&rsquo;re immortal or not,</p>
<p>takes work.</p>
<p>Like it requires you to have the right kind</p>
<p>of frame of mind.</p>
<p>You can discover, you can focus your mind</p>
<p>on the ugliness of life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of ugly things in this world</p>
<p>and you can focus on them.</p>
<p>You can complain.</p>
<p>Whenever like, you know, if it&rsquo;s raining outside,</p>
<p>you can focus on the fact that you have shelter</p>
<p>and enjoy the hell out of it.</p>
<p>Or you can enjoy running in the rain when it&rsquo;s warm</p>
<p>and the beauty of nature, just being one with nature.</p>
<p>Or you can just complain, it&rsquo;s fucking weather again</p>
<p>in Boston and then it&rsquo;s either always raining</p>
<p>or freezing, damn it.</p>
<p>The same thing with like wifi going out on airplanes.</p>
<p>You can either complain about stupid wifi</p>
<p>on JetBlue or something.</p>
<p>Or you could say like, how incredible it is</p>
<p>that I can fly through the sky and in a matter of hours</p>
<p>be anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>And then I could also on occasion watch like check email</p>
<p>and even watch movies while connecting through satellites</p>
<p>that are flying through space.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a matter of perspective and perhaps</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an extra level of work required</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re immortal because it&rsquo;s easier</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re immortal or live longer to be lazy,</p>
<p>to delay stuff.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not, you can still derive</p>
<p>the same amount of joy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely possible.</p>
<p>In my life, I went from being the nothing&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>to every day&rsquo;s great to wake up to.</p>
<p>And I think even if you think you can live forever,</p>
<p>you can enjoy every day.</p>
<p>What I do is everything&rsquo;s relative.</p>
<p>We can compare ourselves to our neighbor who has more money</p>
<p>or to the flight that should have had wifi</p>
<p>or which is what I do, I&rsquo;m still six years old remember.</p>
<p>What a six year old does says, look, I can,</p>
<p>when I tell my fingers to form a fist,</p>
<p>they actually do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I live my life.</p>
<p>I can pick up on your desk here, this metal object.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a metal cube, about an inch by an inch by an inch.</p>
<p>And I tell myself not about cubes,</p>
<p>but about inanimate objects.</p>
<p>Probably once a day I&rsquo;ll say, I&rsquo;m a living thing.</p>
<p>I can think, I can move, I can eat, I am full of energy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that leaf or this cube here</p>
<p>that will never be alive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I look at and compare myself to.</p>
<p>And for as long as I live, if it&rsquo;s forever,</p>
<p>of course it won&rsquo;t be, but even if it was forever,</p>
<p>relative to this lump of metal on this table here,</p>
<p>we are wondrous things in the universe</p>
<p>and probably the most wondrous things in the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re able to deeply appreciate the leaf or the cube</p>
<p>and deeply appreciate ourselves,</p>
<p>which is, it can be a curse, but it&rsquo;s mostly a gift,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s such a beautiful poem.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m six, I&rsquo;m as clever as clever,</p>
<p>so I think I&rsquo;ll be six now forever and ever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing to aspire to.</p>
<p>Your grandmother was onto something.</p>
<p>David, this is an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of your work.</p>
<p>So thank you for wasting your valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>I really, really appreciate it.</p>
<p>This was awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me on, Lex, appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with David Sinclair, and thank you to Onnit, Clear,</p>
<p>National Instruments, Simply Safe, and Linode.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Arthur Schopenhauer.</p>
<p>All truth passes through three stages.</p>
<p>First, it is ridiculed.</p>
<p>Second, it is violently opposed.</p>
<p>Third, it is accepted as being self evident.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
