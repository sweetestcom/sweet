    <p>Our card this week is Rachel Hurley, the Nine of Hearts from Florida.</p>
<p>On St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day 1990, in the picturesque beach town of Jupiter, 14-year-old Rachel</p>
<p>joined a group of friends for an afternoon of boating.</p>
<p>After the teens disembarked a few hours later, Rachel was supposed to meet her mom at their</p>
<p>pickup point, but she never made it.</p>
<p>That night, the middle schooler&rsquo;s body was found in some woods nearby.</p>
<p>For three decades, Rachel&rsquo;s murder has haunted this idyllic South Florida paradise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was just after 3 p.m. on March 17, 1990, and Andrea Hurley was starting to get antsy.</p>
<p>Her daughter Rachel, a fiercely independent 14-year-old, was supposed to meet her near</p>
<p>Carlin Park after spending the day out boating with friends off Jupiter Inlet.</p>
<p>It was St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, and despite so-so weather, families and groups on the other</p>
<p>side of the dense underbrush dotted the white-sand beaches, enjoying a warm but gusty Saturday</p>
<p>afternoon.</p>
<p>Andrea scanned the area and called out for her daughter, but there was no sign of her.</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s mom was immediately worried, considering they had planned that afternoon to go door-knocking</p>
<p>and sell tickets for a pancake breakfast to benefit the middle schooler&rsquo;s softball program,</p>
<p>and Rachel would never blow off her teammates.</p>
<p>Andrea figured she should give her daughter a few more minutes before going full-blown</p>
<p>panic mode.</p>
<p>After all, she was a teenager out with her friends, so maybe wires got crossed and she</p>
<p>just got another ride home.</p>
<p>But Andrea&rsquo;s uneasiness only intensified when she caught up with Rachel&rsquo;s two friends,</p>
<p>Aaron and Maddie, who she knew her daughter had been with that day after a sleepover the</p>
<p>previous night.</p>
<p>Andrea asked the girls if Rachel was with them, but they said no.</p>
<p>They said they&rsquo;d last seen her about a half hour ago when she left the group to go get</p>
<p>picked up at Carlin Park.</p>
<p>Andrea returned to her family&rsquo;s Jupiter home to see whether Rachel just blanked out and</p>
<p>got home some other way, but she wasn&rsquo;t there either.</p>
<p>After an hour of searching and trying to backtrack Rachel&rsquo;s movements, Andrea called the Palm</p>
<p>Beach County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>In pretty much no time at all, a coordinated search effort was underway.</p>
<p>For the next few hours, officers from both the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and the Jupiter Police</p>
<p>Department canvassed the beach as well as the nearby parks.</p>
<p>They also looked in stretches of wooded areas and the parking lot.</p>
<p>Between the dozens of officers scouring the area on foot, eight mounted deputies, three</p>
<p>canine units, two boats and a helicopter, more than 100 law enforcement officials comprised</p>
<p>the search party to find Rachel.</p>
<p>And that didn&rsquo;t even include family, friends and other volunteers who joined.</p>
<p>By sunset, the search party was still navigating the beach and the thick shrubbery that ran</p>
<p>parallel to the shoreline.</p>
<p>They were losing light and Andrea and the rest of Rachel&rsquo;s family were sick with worry.</p>
<p>All they could do was hope that she was somewhere safe and this whole thing was some kind of</p>
<p>misunderstanding.</p>
<p>But finally, around 8 p.m., one of the volunteers searching the wooded area signaled that he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>found something.</p>
<p>On the ground, lying among the shrubbery, was Rachel.</p>
<p>And it was worse than anyone could have imagined.</p>
<p>She was naked from the waist down, covered in scrapes, and there was no indication she</p>
<p>was still alive.</p>
<p>After calling out and while he waited for deputies to arrive at his location, the man,</p>
<p>whose own daughter had been friends with Rachel, took his jacket and did his best to cover</p>
<p>the 14-year-old.</p>
<p>He paced anxiously and smoked cigarette after cigarette until authorities and her parents</p>
<p>arrived and confirmed their worst possible fear.</p>
<p>This was their daughter, their Rachel, their eighth grader who was the undisputed leader</p>
<p>of her friend group, their bright-eyed girl who was about to start high school and who</p>
<p>decided that she wanted to be a fighter pilot after seeing the movie Top Gun.</p>
<p>Devastated and broken doesn&rsquo;t even begin to explain how they felt.</p>
<p>Investigators cordoned off the area and began the difficult process of shuffling and bushwhacking</p>
<p>through shrubbery and terrain in search of possible evidence.</p>
<p>This is a popular beach and in the wooded area, there were obvious homeless camps.</p>
<p>So as Palm Beach County deputies scoured the scene, you can imagine how difficult it must</p>
<p>have been to differentiate between random litter like beer cans, miscellaneous trash,</p>
<p>wrappers, and actual evidence, clues.</p>
<p>But they did find some, like a hairbrush nearby that looked like it might belong to a teenage</p>
<p>girl and the hair in the brush appeared to match the color of Rachel&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They also found loads of spent cigarette butts that were littered in the area near where</p>
<p>Rachel was found, but they soon learned when they talked to the man who had found her that</p>
<p>this wasn&rsquo;t as promising a lead as they had hoped.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Palm Beach County Sheriff&rsquo;s Detective William Springer, who&rsquo;s assigned to the agency&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cold case unit and is the lead on Rachel&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>And of course, when they, when we first got the cigarette butts, we thought, boy, this</p>
<p>looks good.</p>
<p>But then when he said, we asked him, did you smoke there?</p>
<p>He said, oh yeah.</p>
<p>So and I understood.</p>
<p>I was a smoker too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have probably been smoking right along with him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I mean, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s traumatic for him.</p>
<p>You got to realize when you find somebody and you&rsquo;re not used to dealing with, with</p>
<p>violent crimes and seeing dead people.</p>
<p>When you find a 14 year old girl deceased in the woods that you&rsquo;ve been looking for,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very traumatic.</p>
<p>But you know, like I said, he did what a normal father would do.</p>
<p>He covered her body up with his jacket.</p>
<p>Police sort of shrugged and decided to collect the cigarette butts anyway, just in case.</p>
<p>Again, this was 1990, so DNA was the hot new thing.</p>
<p>And back then, deputies knew that stuff like cigarette butts would be loaded with DNA and</p>
<p>could be the key to solving a case.</p>
<p>Nearby, they also found a t-shirt, bathing suit and gym shorts that Rachel&rsquo;s friends</p>
<p>said she&rsquo;d been wearing earlier that day.</p>
<p>It was obvious just by looking at the condition of the clothes and the wounds on her body</p>
<p>that there was a struggle before she died.</p>
<p>I mean, this young girl fought for her life.</p>
<p>But there was one more item in particular which deputies found inside a burn barrel</p>
<p>that stopped them in their tracks, a bloody shirt.</p>
<p>The burn barrel with the bloodstained shirt inside was located in the same immediate area</p>
<p>where Rachel&rsquo;s body was found.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking like 200 feet away.</p>
<p>The shirt was collected, bagged as evidence and sent to a lab for testing.</p>
<p>Now it wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear to investigators exactly whose blood was on the t-shirt, only</p>
<p>that it likely wasn&rsquo;t Rachel&rsquo;s considering there wasn&rsquo;t a significant amount of blood</p>
<p>at the crime scene to begin with, which made sense considering she died as a result of</p>
<p>asphyxiation.</p>
<p>As if the situation couldn&rsquo;t be any more devastating, the location where Rachel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body and all of this evidence was recovered wasn&rsquo;t this super secluded area.</p>
<p>It was near Carlin Park, a mere stone&rsquo;s throw from the general parking area where</p>
<p>she was supposed to meet her mom.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the wooded area were some beachgoers who lounged and swam.</p>
<p>That night, the Palm Beach County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, which was initially working alongside</p>
<p>the Jupiter Police Department, took lead on the case.</p>
<p>The following day, deputies started interviewing anyone who could help them piece together</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s last movements.</p>
<p>The usual picturesque beach scape was now crawling with cops and news crews, all of</p>
<p>whom were angling to talk to the same people.</p>
<p>That included Rachel&rsquo;s friends, Aaron and Maddie, and at least two teenage boys who</p>
<p>were all together on the boat the day of her murder.</p>
<p>Each of Rachel&rsquo;s friends who were on the boat with her that day cooperated with the</p>
<p>investigation and provided DNA samples that would help eliminate them as suspects.</p>
<p>The girls in the group told deputies that, unbeknownst to their parents, they made plans</p>
<p>to meet the boys at a dock near Dubois Park the next morning, which is about a mile from</p>
<p>Carlin Park, and they were basically going to all spend the day together on the boat.</p>
<p>In a 2019 podcast produced by the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department called The Lead, they recount Aaron</p>
<p>saying, quote, Rachel was her usual self, bossing us all around and being the center</p>
<p>of attention.</p>
<p>I remember her falling off the hydro slide at one point, and the boys kept the boat going</p>
<p>pretending they didn&rsquo;t see her fall.</p>
<p>She was so mad when we finally circled back to her, and we all, including Rachel, laughed</p>
<p>and laughed.</p>
<p>We had a blast, end quote.</p>
<p>The girls told deputies that they had docked the boat sometime around 2.45, which would</p>
<p>have given Rachel like 15 minutes before she had to go meet her mom.</p>
<p>As they disembarked, Aaron and Maddie wanted to make a stop at a nearby rec area restroom</p>
<p>to freshen up, but they said that Rachel was nervous about getting to the pickup spot on</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>She knew that her mom wanted to start selling their softball tickets right away, and she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to be late.</p>
<p>So Rachel said bye, gave her signature hair flip, and took off running down the beach</p>
<p>toward Carlin Park.</p>
<p>Detective Springer told us he&rsquo;s not sure what took Rachel into the woods that day,</p>
<p>but there are only a few possibilities.</p>
<p>We know she got off the boat.</p>
<p>We know she ran down the beach.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if she went through the woods on her own, or somebody took her through the</p>
<p>woods.</p>
<p>But if you think about it, I mean, it&rsquo;s broad daylight, so she probably went through, took</p>
<p>that shortcut through the path.</p>
<p>Maybe she knew it was there, because they were there all the time.</p>
<p>So if she went through there, then somebody just grabbed her, saw the opportunity, and</p>
<p>grabbed her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that whoever did it had been sitting out on that beach for weekends</p>
<p>at a time, just looking for an opportunity, and just scouted it out, and Rachel presented</p>
<p>them a prime opportunity.</p>
<p>According to one An Injustice article written by Jen Baxter, that Sunday investigators continued</p>
<p>talking to friends and other witnesses who were in the area the day Rachel was killed.</p>
<p>One teen told deputies that he saw an unknown man exiting the wooded area where her body</p>
<p>was later found.</p>
<p>According to Jen&rsquo;s write-up, the teen also told detectives at the time that the man with</p>
<p>dark blonde hair appeared to be in his 30s, had a thin build, looked like he weighed maybe</p>
<p>around 150 pounds.</p>
<p>He was shirtless and wearing jeans and construction boots.</p>
<p>What especially stood out, the teen told authorities, was the apparent scratch marks</p>
<p>on the man&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>But this might not be as suspicious as it sounds.</p>
<p>Detective Springer told our reporting team that the wooded areas near the beach drew</p>
<p>a lot of transient people who often congregated in the area and would set up camp.</p>
<p>So maybe this guy had nothing to do with Rachel&rsquo;s murder, though it&rsquo;s possible he saw something.</p>
<p>And speaking of seeing something, with more canvassing came more hope that police might</p>
<p>be able to see for themselves exactly what happened that day, because there were a bunch</p>
<p>of parents at a nearby park watching a baseball game.</p>
<p>And you know parents in the 90s, there were definitely camcorders out and at the ready.</p>
<p>And maybe, if investigators were lucky, those recordings could capture a glimpse of what</p>
<p>happened to Rachel.</p>
<p>Authorities asked, begged even, for anyone who was recording the game to share any of</p>
<p>their footage with the department, which they did.</p>
<p>But the footage wasn&rsquo;t particularly helpful and failed to advance the case for detectives.</p>
<p>But at least one person who was in the area that day told cops that they saw someone who</p>
<p>matched the description of the scratched up shirtless man.</p>
<p>But the info was pretty vague and didn&rsquo;t really give authorities anyone to narrow in</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s autopsy was performed soon after, and during the autopsy, the medical examiner</p>
<p>determined that the 14-year-old had been sexually assaulted and suffocated.</p>
<p>Detective Springer declined to say what led the ME to determine she&rsquo;d been assaulted</p>
<p>other than there were physical evidence that backed it up.</p>
<p>Now while the autopsy was being done, all of the other evidence that was collected was</p>
<p>being processed by a lab for foreign DNA.</p>
<p>Things like strands of hair on her body that didn&rsquo;t look like hers, her clothes, even</p>
<p>those spent cigarette butts.</p>
<p>While they were waiting for results to come back, the town of Jupiter was all consumed</p>
<p>by this case.</p>
<p>The service held for Rachel collectively drew at least 3,000 mourners who came to pay their</p>
<p>respects.</p>
<p>And the resources provided by law enforcement matched this.</p>
<p>At least five detectives had been assigned to the case.</p>
<p>The sheriff even oversaw the creation of a task force responsible for basically working</p>
<p>the case full time.</p>
<p>In less than a month, the task force fielded more than 1,000 calls from an increasingly</p>
<p>frantic and concerned public trying to provide tips and information.</p>
<p>That in and of itself spoke volumes.</p>
<p>The people of Jupiter were desperate to assign blame in this case.</p>
<p>A case that had unarguably upended a community&rsquo;s collective sense of security.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t much, but that early tip about a shirtless man nervously exiting the wooded</p>
<p>area that afternoon Rachel was sexually assaulted and murdered took on a life of its own.</p>
<p>Like literally, this is how scared they were?</p>
<p>According to reporting in the Palm Beach Post newspaper, a little over two weeks after Rachel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder, the town council approved a $62,000 spend to hire additional police officers just</p>
<p>to arrest transient people and patrol the beach for the remainder of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>The town&rsquo;s mayor at the time, Mary Hinton, basically rubber stamped her approval of the</p>
<p>measure.</p>
<p>The story said because, quote, she blames transients for many of the town&rsquo;s burglaries,</p>
<p>including one to her residence last year in which $6,000 worth of property was stolen.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Jupiter Police Chief Richard Westgate said in the same story, quote, they roam the town</p>
<p>and stay in the wooded areas at night.</p>
<p>Much of their pay goes to alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slim existence.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>According to more reporting from the Palm Beach Post, as detectives continued to return</p>
<p>to the scene where Rachel was assaulted and murdered, people experiencing homelessness</p>
<p>would simply hold up the business card of a detective whenever they saw a cop approaching</p>
<p>them in order to signal that they&rsquo;d already been questioned.</p>
<p>Now, mind you, this man who was described by witnesses wasn&rsquo;t named a suspect.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t even know who he was, if both witnesses were even describing the same person.</p>
<p>There were just no arrests and everyone was freaking out.</p>
<p>And so as a result, this idea that they would just scoop up and arrest every transient person</p>
<p>as a way to solve their problem, in my mind, was a bandaid and a flimsy, dirty bandaid</p>
<p>at that.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t get to the heart of the issue.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t designed to help any of these people.</p>
<p>And this wasn&rsquo;t totally lost on the people living there.</p>
<p>A concerned resident told the newspaper back then, quote, it seems like people are letting</p>
<p>their emotions get carried away.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what happened to Rachel was absolutely awful.</p>
<p>So the strong emotional response here made sense to a lot of people.</p>
<p>But it was exactly that, an emotional response.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t any sort of credible evidence to support the actions by local elected officials.</p>
<p>At the same time investigators were working tips related to the homeless encampments,</p>
<p>they were also continuing to interview everyone in Rachel&rsquo;s orbit.</p>
<p>And this one name kept popping up again and again, Billy Fagan.</p>
<p>When questioned, 17-year-old Billy was like, yeah, sure, I knew Rachel.</p>
<p>And he and his attorney even told the media that Billy and Rachel were, quote, unquote,</p>
<p>beach friends.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like the two were best friends or anything like that.</p>
<p>But for someone who apparently didn&rsquo;t know Rachel particularly well, Billy was pretty</p>
<p>front and center.</p>
<p>I mean, he was everywhere.</p>
<p>Wherever there was a public facing event related to the murder, whether it was volunteer led</p>
<p>groups who combed through the beach and wooded areas for possible clues, or even Rachel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>own services, there was Billy.</p>
<p>He gave interviews to TV news crews.</p>
<p>And the Palm Beach Post reported Billy boasted to a past girlfriend that he had been the</p>
<p>one to uncover Rachel&rsquo;s discarded clothing, which he claimed was buried in the ground.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t true, though.</p>
<p>Authorities were extremely interested in sitting down with Billy.</p>
<p>And for all the attention Billy was calling upon himself, they were hopeful that he was</p>
<p>interested in cooperating.</p>
<p>But his lawyer was not about to let that happen.</p>
<p>So they hit a wall with Billy, though that didn&rsquo;t mean they couldn&rsquo;t talk to everyone</p>
<p>who knew Billy.</p>
<p>And that would pay off in a huge way.</p>
<p>As the murder investigation entered its second month, authorities dropped an absolute bombshell.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;s office announced that it was charging Billy, the high school</p>
<p>sophomore as an adult, with 16 counts of loot assault, four counts of sexual battery, two</p>
<p>counts of battery, as well as a single count each of false imprisonment, robbery, and petty</p>
<p>theft.</p>
<p>But to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, none of those charges were related to Rachel&rsquo;s sexual assault</p>
<p>and murder.</p>
<p>When they looked into him, they found that maybe he was aggressive with a lot of girls,</p>
<p>women.</p>
<p>He subsequently got arrested for some sexual crimes.</p>
<p>But he was never enough evidence to even come close to charging him with Rachel.</p>
<p>Again, to be absolutely clear, none of these charges in any way were connected to Rachel</p>
<p>Hurley&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
<p>At this point, Billy&rsquo;s name was on everyone&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>Yet as far as anyone could tell, authorities investigating Rachel&rsquo;s murder had still not</p>
<p>sat down with him for a formal interview.</p>
<p>But the more authorities talked to Billy&rsquo;s peers, the deeper their suspicion grew.</p>
<p>And honestly, from the outside, the case against the teenager was shaping up to be a strong</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>A reporter for The Sun-Sentinel reported in a November 1991 article that the FBI had even</p>
<p>provided a profile of the kind of person they think would be capable of something like Rachel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder.</p>
<p>The article stated that the killer was likely, quote, a young white male, upper middle class,</p>
<p>charismatic, probably out of work, and not particularly well-grounded.</p>
<p>Billy Fagan checked all the boxes.</p>
<p>Giving him the benefit of the doubt for a second, though, that same profile could have</p>
<p>described any number of the teen boys in the upper middle class haven that Palm Beach</p>
<p>County, Florida was.</p>
<p>And still is.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, by all accounts, Billy was an enigma.</p>
<p>That same Sun-Sentinel article included an interview with a former girlfriend who referred</p>
<p>to the teen&rsquo;s disposition as oscillating between high highs and low lows.</p>
<p>At his worst, he was even sometimes violent.</p>
<p>The article reads, quote, on the one hand, she got love notes, hand-painted t-shirts,</p>
<p>and an abundance of flowers from a boy teenage girls found cute and charming.</p>
<p>And yet, during an argument, this same Billy grabbed her arm so tightly he bruised them,</p>
<p>she says.</p>
<p>In another fight, she smacked his face and he picked her up and threw her against a gasoline</p>
<p>pump.</p>
<p>She spent two and a half days in the hospital recovering from internal injuries.</p>
<p>Billy visited her, bringing her roses and voicing regrets, end quote.</p>
<p>Billy was held for at least three days in a juvenile detention center and released after</p>
<p>a judge set a $42,000 bond.</p>
<p>As some details about Billy&rsquo;s past behavior and the sexual assault cases started to trickle</p>
<p>down, multiple girls who were interviewed by deputies said they felt misled and didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize their response to questions from investigators would be used to prosecute Billy.</p>
<p>One of the girl&rsquo;s mothers even told reporters at the time that investigators spoke to her</p>
<p>15-year-old daughter without her knowing and that the middle schooler, quote, didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel any of the statements would be used and that the case should be dropped.</p>
<p>Even still, Billy&rsquo;s attorney wouldn&rsquo;t let law enforcement sit down with his client without</p>
<p>first being filled in on just what evidence deputies had collected so far in the Rachel</p>
<p>Hurley investigation.</p>
<p>But investigators wouldn&rsquo;t tell them, so that interview never happened.</p>
<p>Instead, Billy&rsquo;s attorney told the local press that his client had an alibi for the</p>
<p>afternoon Rachel was killed, and he said he was nowhere near Carlin Park in the mid-afternoon</p>
<p>hours of March 17th.</p>
<p>You see, Billy, who lives in nearby Palm Beach Gardens, said that he wasn&rsquo;t even in Palm</p>
<p>Beach County that day and that he and his friends had been surfing in a town called</p>
<p>Sebastian, which is about 80 miles north of Jupiter.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old&rsquo;s attorney also assured authorities that Billy and his pals, who could vouch for</p>
<p>his whereabouts that day, stopped at a Jupiter-area movie rental store on the way back home sometime</p>
<p>between 2.30 and 3.00, where, according to news reports, they rented Nightmare on Elm</p>
<p>Street 5 and Kickboxer, which records from the store confirmed.</p>
<p>The video store itself was also at least 10 miles away from Carlin Park, his attorney</p>
<p>said, so there was just no way Billy could have gotten from there to the wooded area</p>
<p>where Rachel was killed in the amount of time necessary to cross paths with her.</p>
<p>Billy&rsquo;s attorney told reporters that the sheriff&rsquo;s office was aware of Billy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>alibi, but they still seemed hyper-focused on his client.</p>
<p>It seems like instead of investigators sitting down with Billy and his attorney, they just</p>
<p>battled it out very publicly, using the local media.</p>
<p>By September, the unrelated sexual assault case against Billy had pretty much fallen</p>
<p>apart because prosecutors were having a difficult time getting witnesses who would be willing</p>
<p>to sign criminal affidavits or testify against him.</p>
<p>Eventually, Billy reached a plea deal with prosecutors where he pled no contest to five</p>
<p>misdemeanor charges and agreed to attend counseling.</p>
<p>By this time, it had been like six months since Rachel was murdered, and they still</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t gotten test results back on any of the physical evidence.</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s mourning family and friends, the sheriff&rsquo;s office, even the public were all</p>
<p>beyond frustrated with the snail&rsquo;s pace of DNA testing.</p>
<p>They were worried that the delay was enabling a rapist and a murderer to evade law enforcement.</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s mother, Andrea, told the Sun-Sentinel, quote,</p>
<p>I do believe this isn&rsquo;t a one-time only thing.</p>
<p>I do believe that this will happen again before this person is caught, end quote.</p>
<p>Detective Springer was unsure of exactly when the department first received DNA results</p>
<p>back from their original processing of the crime scene, but there were no matches to</p>
<p>note.</p>
<p>Whoever the killer was, it&rsquo;s likely they hadn&rsquo;t been previously convicted of a similar</p>
<p>crime or any crime, really, considering there were no initial hits generated from the DNA.</p>
<p>But at some point, investigators did get ahold of Billy&rsquo;s DNA, and it too was not a match</p>
<p>for any of the samples found on any of the items tested from the crime scene, including</p>
<p>on the shirt found in the burn barrel.</p>
<p>They also were able to rule out Rachel as a source for the blood from the burn barrel</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>Between 1991 and 2004, 2004 being the point when the Palm Beach County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>cold case unit officially took over Rachel&rsquo;s case, the case stalled significantly and little</p>
<p>new information surfaced.</p>
<p>But the lack of progress certainly wasn&rsquo;t through a lack of resourcefulness.</p>
<p>In 1999, Rachel&rsquo;s family and investigators installed microphones at their youngest daughter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tombstone in hopes of catching the killer on a hot mic, maybe making a graveside confession.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, nothing ever came of it.</p>
<p>The same year, two detectives who had previously worked on the investigation but had since</p>
<p>moved on to other jobs outside the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office took their case notes to the Philadelphia-based</p>
<p>VDOC Society, this exclusive members-only group comprising various law enforcement officials</p>
<p>past and present who review unsolved homicides.</p>
<p>The Palm Beach Post reported in a July 1999 article that the former county lawman told</p>
<p>the group something pretty wild that,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to get past.</p>
<p>They claimed investigators at the crime scene mishandled physical evidence.</p>
<p>More specifically, that there had been DNA from the killer beneath Rachel&rsquo;s fingernails.</p>
<p>Exactly what kind, they didn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>But basically, whatever it was, was not properly preserved.</p>
<p>The former Palm Beach investigators also presented evidence to the group that Rachel had bite</p>
<p>marks on her thighs.</p>
<p>The VDOC Society&rsquo;s assessment also provided the name of someone else they thought should</p>
<p>be seriously considered as a suspect.</p>
<p>They laid out this whole theory on why they thought this guy was the one who killed Rachel.</p>
<p>When our reporting team asked Detective Springer about this man, he would only say that the</p>
<p>man was considered and later ruled out through DNA testing.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t say anything more about this suspect, though, not even why the Society</p>
<p>thought he made a strong suspect.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office Cold Case Unit officially took over Rachel&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>and collected more than 100 samples from men to potentially test against DNA in Rachel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case.</p>
<p>Those efforts failed to produce any matches.</p>
<p>Among this huge swath of people who submitted DNA samples and were subsequently cleared</p>
<p>were the teenage boys on the boat with Rachel before she died, even the friend&rsquo;s dad who</p>
<p>found her body, and of course, Billy Fagan.</p>
<p>The case seemed to be growing colder with each passing day.</p>
<p>But a phone call in 2004 to one of the detectives from the agency&rsquo;s own DNA lab finally delivered</p>
<p>a new credible lead.</p>
<p>It turns out, DNA recovered from the bloody burn barrel t-shirt matched the DNA of a man</p>
<p>named Douglas Gross.</p>
<p>His DNA was already in CODIS because he had previously been sentenced to 20 years for</p>
<p>unrelated violent crimes, per reporting by the Palm Beach Post.</p>
<p>When investigators brought this information to Douglas, who was 17 at the time of Rachel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder and was known to be acquainted with her, he denied any involvement.</p>
<p>Sure, he&rsquo;d been known to hang around the wooded areas near the beach at Carlin Park</p>
<p>and the DNA hit proved that the shirt was worn by Douglas at some point, but it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>prove that he was linked to Rachel&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Now as promising as that development sounds, you probably had the same reaction I did.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t this come up in 2001 when Douglas was sent away to prison?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because the shirt wasn&rsquo;t retested until the fall of 2003.</p>
<p>Authorities kept this information pretty much to themselves and didn&rsquo;t even share it with</p>
<p>the media until years later, in March 2005.</p>
<p>When they got around to interviewing Douglas, he told detectives that he had been locked</p>
<p>up in a youth detention center at the time of Rachel&rsquo;s murder, so there&rsquo;s no way he</p>
<p>could have killed Rachel.</p>
<p>According to records back then, he was supposed to be in DYS on the day that Rachel was murdered.</p>
<p>But he, some people said he actually escaped, got out, and then came back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been able to prove that.</p>
<p>Then in 2005, a fellow inmate who was doing time with Gross himself, a convicted felon</p>
<p>with a history of providing misleading information as an informant, told authorities that Gross</p>
<p>confessed to raping and killing Rachel.</p>
<p>But regardless, Gross continued to deny any involvement.</p>
<p>He told detectives that even though the shirt was apparently his, it&rsquo;s also possible that</p>
<p>he had given it to someone else.</p>
<p>As for the blood, well, Gross said that he was pretty regularly wrapped up in fights</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;d hang out at the beach encampments, so it wasn&rsquo;t surprising to him that the</p>
<p>shirt was stained with blood.</p>
<p>Gross also stuck to his story about being locked up in juvie at the time of the murder.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of the investigation, a handful of other men with ties to the area</p>
<p>and rap sheets that included convictions of violent and or sexual crimes against women</p>
<p>and girls were vetted as persons of interest, including Charlie Brandt, a serial killer</p>
<p>with strong ties to South Florida.</p>
<p>I actually did a Crime Junkie episode on Charlie a few years ago, so I specifically wanted</p>
<p>to know if police considered him for Rachel&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>But Detective Springer said that they kind of did, but not seriously, because Charlie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>M.O. was horrifically violent.</p>
<p>He was known to mutilate his victims, and that was not what happened to Rachel, so Charlie</p>
<p>has never been on the short list of suspects in this case.</p>
<p>Despite Billy and Doug and countless others having been eliminated as suspects in this</p>
<p>case through DNA, Detective Springer said that as far as he&rsquo;s concerned, every name</p>
<p>will stay on his person of interest list until the right guy is behind bars.</p>
<p>Until somebody&rsquo;s physically arrested and we&rsquo;re 100% sure that&rsquo;s the person, all</p>
<p>these people are still potential suspects to me, but I will never completely eliminate</p>
<p>somebody until I make an arrest.</p>
<p>To me, everybody is still a potential suspect.</p>
<p>I have to, I keep an open mind.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get tunnel vision on one person and say they did it and that&rsquo;s all I work</p>
<p>on is that one person.</p>
<p>I try to eliminate people, and like I said, he&rsquo;s been pretty well eliminated, okay?</p>
<p>But is there a possibility that there&rsquo;s something there that we don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always that possibility, because we don&rsquo;t have an eyewitness, and if we do have</p>
<p>an eyewitness, they haven&rsquo;t come forward yet.</p>
<p>So if somebody out there witnessed this or somebody confessed to him that they did it,</p>
<p>then, you know, I&rsquo;d like them to come forward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not difficult to see how this case has become part of this town&rsquo;s DNA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find people in Jupiter who haven&rsquo;t heard of the case at one point or another.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ll be thinking about Rachel and her family and the future that was taken from</p>
<p>them, the experiences Rachel will never have and all the memories that they never get to</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be thinking about that for a long time.</p>
<p>Her family still lives in the area, but Rachel&rsquo;s father Daniel actually died in 2019, so he</p>
<p>never had the chance to learn who killed his little girl.</p>
<p>What are the chances you think Rachel knew her killer?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible she did.</p>
<p>Then again, you know, like I said, it could just have been somebody saw her running down</p>
<p>the beach and followed her.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a $15,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in Rachel&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Were you near Jupiter Inlet or Carlin Park on March 17th, 1990?</p>
<p>Maybe you saw or heard something that you haven&rsquo;t been able to shake, something you</p>
<p>maybe didn&rsquo;t even realize was noteworthy until this moment.</p>
<p>Well, this is your chance to make a difference, your chance to help bring an enduring 30-plus</p>
<p>year nightmare to an end.</p>
