    <p>The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein,</p>
<p>the third time we&rsquo;ve spoken on this podcast.</p>
<p>He is the wise turtle master Oogway to my Kung Fu Panda,</p>
<p>one of my favorite people to talk to in this world.</p>
<p>A complicated and fascinating mind</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m grateful to have the chance to accompany</p>
<p>in exploring this world through conversation</p>
<p>on this podcast and on his, the latter called The Portal.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor followed by some thoughts</p>
<p>related to the episode.</p>
<p>First is Grammarly, a service I use in my writing</p>
<p>to check spelling, grammar, sentence structure,</p>
<p>and readability.</p>
<p>Second is Sunbasket, a meal delivery service I use</p>
<p>to add healthy variety into my culinary life.</p>
<p>Third is SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever come across.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like looking at numbers, but somebody should.</p>
<p>It helps you make good decisions.</p>
<p>And finally, ExpressVPN, the VPN I&rsquo;ve used for many years</p>
<p>to protect my privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that wherever this life takes me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drawn to the possibility of having many more</p>
<p>conversations with Eric through the years.</p>
<p>I think we have just the right kind of contrast</p>
<p>in having worldviews and a deep respect and appreciation</p>
<p>of each other&rsquo;s life stories that creates for</p>
<p>this magical experience in the realm of conversation</p>
<p>that feels like we&rsquo;re always looking for something</p>
<p>that we never quite find,</p>
<p>but are always better for having tried.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how or why the universe has connected</p>
<p>Eric and me, but it did.</p>
<p>And I would be a fool not to trust its judgment</p>
<p>and enjoy the journey.</p>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the greatest musician of all time, would you say?</p>
<p>We were just off camera talking about Eddie Van Halen.</p>
<p>He unfortunately passed away.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the greatest musician of all time?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jonathan Richman.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird question.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna give you a weird answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because of&hellip;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, Jonathan Richman.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m picking on him is that he had a quote.</p>
<p>He was the front man of a group called the Modern Lovers.</p>
<p>And his quote was something like,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We have to be prepared to play music</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;when our instruments are broken,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;the electricity&rsquo;s out and it&rsquo;s raining,&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I thought that that quote was very interesting</p>
<p>because what it said was,</p>
<p>you have to be able to strip this thing down</p>
<p>farther and farther back</p>
<p>to get to something that is intrinsically musical.</p>
<p>So we were having a conversation just now about virtuosity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about Eddie Van Halen and his recent passing.</p>
<p>And that affected me emotionally.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it affected you.</p>
<p>I was never a Van Halen, the group fan,</p>
<p>but I revered Eddie Van Halen&rsquo;s capacity for innovation.</p>
<p>I saw him like Rodney Mullen, the skateboarder.</p>
<p>I had dreamed of having the two of them on the same podcast</p>
<p>just to talk about what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to totally discontinuously innovate.</p>
<p>And he posted a video of Spanish Fly, I think,</p>
<p>and saying like,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the guitar could make those kinds of sounds.</p>
<p>Like, what is this voodoo magic?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Well, this is the thing, right?</p>
<p>The arpeggios that he did on a single string are so fast</p>
<p>and the attacks from the hammer ons,</p>
<p>when they go at light speed as he did, particularly.</p>
<p>And the reason I chose that was,</p>
<p>is that I wanted to strip out the electronics</p>
<p>because part of the claim will be is</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s a rock musician.</p>
<p>And a lot of the innovations had to do with things peculiar</p>
<p>to sort of the electrified setup.</p>
<p>His use of the whammy bar, for example,</p>
<p>or the Frankenstrat that he built from different pieces.</p>
<p>All of those aspects, in my opinion,</p>
<p>are just dwarfed by his innovation and his musicianship.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I chose Spanish Fly,</p>
<p>because everyone, of course,</p>
<p>will go to something like your eruption</p>
<p>or running with the devil,</p>
<p>which is the first things that they heard</p>
<p>that let them know that there was a new force erupting</p>
<p>out of Southern California that was Eddie Van Halen, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m in love with the story of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re often so poetic about music.</p>
<p>Like it clearly touches your soul on many levels.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Is it deeper than just rocking out</p>
<p>with the in your convertible Corvette 69?</p>
<p>I imagine Eric Weinstein is driving down</p>
<p>the California highways, blasting some kind of music.</p>
<p>Is it just like being able to be carefree</p>
<p>for moments of time?</p>
<p>Or is there something more fundamental</p>
<p>that connects to like the theory of everything</p>
<p>in physics and life and all of that?</p>
<p>How often do you have the chance, for example,</p>
<p>to hear mathematics performed as you do in Bach, right?</p>
<p>Like something with that kind of precision</p>
<p>and elegance that can&rsquo;t really be grasped,</p>
<p>where to go back to Leonard Cohen&rsquo;s famous line,</p>
<p>the baffled king composing, right?</p>
<p>Such a good song.</p>
<p>Such a good song, but it&rsquo;s also like individual verses</p>
<p>of that song are insanely important.</p>
<p>The baffled king is how we often make music.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really understand what did we just do</p>
<p>that broke that person&rsquo;s heart sitting on the couch, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a very strange thing</p>
<p>that you should be able to have.</p>
<p>Think of it like you&rsquo;re a computer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this weird open music port, port 37.8, you know?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not even supposed to be there.</p>
<p>And suddenly somebody starts playing guitar</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re making you feel things.</p>
<p>Or like in particular, particular instruments</p>
<p>like the violin, it&rsquo;s so difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so unforgiving.</p>
<p>And when it gives up its secrets,</p>
<p>it just, you know, it wraps its fingers</p>
<p>around your heart and won&rsquo;t let go.</p>
<p>Sometimes I talk about head, heart, and loins.</p>
<p>When something can grab your head, heart, and your loins</p>
<p>at the same moment and integrate them,</p>
<p>there are very few opportunities to live like that.</p>
<p>And if you think about Eddie Van Halen,</p>
<p>as far as your head, the musical innovations</p>
<p>and the fact that he was drawing directly</p>
<p>from the classical canon really speaks to the idea</p>
<p>that maybe rock is what somebody like Jimi Hendrix saw it</p>
<p>as being, you know, an infinitely extensible medium.</p>
<p>In terms of heart, I always notice the smile on his face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s painful to look at an Eddie Van Halen solo now.</p>
<p>Like sometimes you&rsquo;ll see the cigarette dripping off</p>
<p>the side of his mouth and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna fucking kill you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even worried about it for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about it for me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna rob.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even need to hear you play another note.</p>
<p>I just like knowing that you&rsquo;re in the world,</p>
<p>that there is somebody that everyone looks to that nobody,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard a guitarist say, eh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think he was okay.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve never heard it.</p>
<p>You can hate him, but you still think he was a genius.</p>
<p>There are very few people like that in the world.</p>
<p>And then loins, those leaps,</p>
<p>that guy was incredibly good looking</p>
<p>and, you know, skin tight pants, super athleticism.</p>
<p>He completely owned the male sexuality of the stage,</p>
<p>both being the completely dominant,</p>
<p>you know, sort of mythical alpha male.</p>
<p>I hate that expression, but there you are.</p>
<p>But also this kind of little boy with this mischievous smirk</p>
<p>and, you know, the sense that it all came together.</p>
<p>How could you not eat that up?</p>
<p>You could just imagine the millions</p>
<p>of like young teenage boys, gorgeous,</p>
<p>like playing air guitar in their room,</p>
<p>just that, yeah, basically dreaming</p>
<p>of being that kind of God,</p>
<p>the most perfect example of what a human being can be.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating to think.</p>
<p>It is, and then, you know,</p>
<p>as in many of the cases with these bands,</p>
<p>you get these multiple talents in the same outfit.</p>
<p>And I think that the original configuration</p>
<p>with David Lee Roth, I mean,</p>
<p>David Lee Roth is such a hot mess at all times.</p>
<p>I would love you to talk to David Lee Roth.</p>
<p>Like if the, that dance would be just gorgeous.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Can you handle it?</p>
<p>Can you ride that?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Probably not because I think he&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>I get the feeling that he&rsquo;s very smart</p>
<p>and very dysregulated.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that I could,</p>
<p>like bring him down to earth for a moment.</p>
<p>Well, I can also get pretty dysregulated, you know?</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know whether, it could be magic.</p>
<p>It could be a shit show.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you thought of his appearance on Rogan.</p>
<p>That was an interesting one.</p>
<p>I loved it, but Joe and that,</p>
<p>and Joe does this sometimes,</p>
<p>sometimes he just sits back and listens</p>
<p>and he just lets like the music play,</p>
<p>which works really well.</p>
<p>I think you have a chance to kind of jump into the chaos</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll just start.</p>
<p>And the places you will go,</p>
<p>you may not even talk about music for like hours.</p>
<p>It might just go to this,</p>
<p>cause he, I think lives in Japan.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a weird,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been an EMT after he was a rock star.</p>
<p>He chose to be kind of like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s depth to that man</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t been explored by him either.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;ll be an exciting conversation.</p>
<p>Can we go back to Larry Cohen?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can we just,</p>
<p>the things I feel when I listen to Hallelujah</p>
<p>by Leonard Cohen or anything by him really,</p>
<p>but that one.</p>
<p>Do you really want to get into it?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>What is it that song mean to you?</p>
<p>Is it love?</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, it&rsquo;s mystery.</p>
<p>Like it starts off about mystery.</p>
<p>So what are you doing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing this alternation between the two chords.</p>
<p>So three notes at the same time.</p>
<p>One is called the tonic,</p>
<p>or you have the major and the relative minor</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s alternating between them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one note of difference</p>
<p>between those two chords.</p>
<p>One of them would be feeling sad.</p>
<p>One of them would be more joyous, typically described.</p>
<p>And so by altering one note,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the minimal amount to take you back and forth</p>
<p>between joy and happiness as that&rsquo;s encoded in us.</p>
<p>So he starts off with,</p>
<p>I heard there was a scene,</p>
<p>David played the please a little bit.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really care for music, do you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s using this technique called Bethos, right?</p>
<p>So the alternation between the sublime</p>
<p>and kind of the guttural or ridiculous or the mundane, right?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bitterness to it too.</p>
<p>Is it just play?</p>
<p>Well, the way I hear it, again,</p>
<p>a great song allows for different interpretations.</p>
<p>You happen to be asking me,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to impart some stuff</p>
<p>that probably isn&rsquo;t in the song,</p>
<p>but why it speaks to me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what makes it great.</p>
<p>The way I hear it is he doesn&rsquo;t believe the audience.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really care for music, do you?</p>
<p>Then what are you doing listening to this?</p>
<p>You stupid idiots, of course you care for music.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re too cool to care.</p>
<p>So I see through you and screw you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the energy I get.</p>
<p>Then he does this weird thing.</p>
<p>It goes like this is where he should put the description</p>
<p>of where he is in the chord progression,</p>
<p>which is the tonic, right?</p>
<p>It goes like this.</p>
<p>And then he hits the fourth and the fifth,</p>
<p>which are the two other major elements,</p>
<p>the subdominant and the dominant in functional harmony.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s describing the chord progression</p>
<p>in real time in the lyrics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two ways this can come about in other songs.</p>
<p>We had this example of every time we say goodbye.</p>
<p>Do you know this song?</p>
<p>Every time we say goodbye.</p>
<p>No, I think it was a Cole Porter, maybe,</p>
<p>or Gershwin, maybe Porter, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I cry a little, there is no love song finer,</p>
<p>but how strange the change from major to minor, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a beautiful use of it.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s times when it&rsquo;s duplicitous.</p>
<p>So for example, you&rsquo;ll have,</p>
<p>I guess my favorite examples of this</p>
<p>are Johnny Cash&rsquo;s Ring of Fire.</p>
<p>I fell into a burning ring of fire.</p>
<p>And then what does he do with the lyrics in the tune?</p>
<p>I went down, down, down.</p>
<p>He goes up, right?</p>
<p>And so the idea is like, oh, okay, that was a head fake.</p>
<p>And another one of these is Nina Simone&rsquo;s Feeling Good.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, so what do you get?</p>
<p>Birds flying high, you know how I feel.</p>
<p>Then sun up in the sky, you know how I feel.</p>
<p>That woman&rsquo;s voice, she doesn&rsquo;t give a damn yet.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>And I feel it, but then what&rsquo;s the, da dum, da dum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like heavy stripping music.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re not in a good place.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably in some strip club,</p>
<p>with the last of your money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re drinking lousy beer, some bad situation.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s feeling good?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s funereal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s oppressive, right?</p>
<p>I never thought of that song that way.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Well, you think of it as joyous?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, no, if you think about it,</p>
<p>contrast it with Ray Charles, for example.</p>
<p>You know, do you know Lonely Avenue?</p>
<p>Well, my room has got two windows,</p>
<p>but the sunshine never comes through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really depressed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same sort of vibe as Nina,</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s claiming that she&rsquo;s in great shape.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s like a good case of the unreliable narrator.</p>
<p>Leonard Cohen, to me,</p>
<p>is talking about the unreliable audience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too cool to be with the performer on stage.</p>
<p>There are things that go with the music,</p>
<p>like the Cole Porter stuff,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s go against like the Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>I think these are the games that musicians play</p>
<p>that the rest of us only sort of notice subliminally.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Fourth, the fifth, then he,</p>
<p>when he, he should say something about the relative minor</p>
<p>or the, he&rsquo;s giving you the secret,</p>
<p>the baffled king, in other words,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t know why it works.</p>
<p>Did Pachelbel know why Pachelbel&rsquo;s Canon would work?</p>
<p>It was a discovery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole thing.</p>
<p>Like some music is discovered and some music is invented.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s talking about a musical discovery.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s talking about the Pythagorean power</p>
<p>of the wave equation and then superimpose,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s two genius intellectual concepts behind music.</p>
<p>One of which is the wave equation.</p>
<p>Usually we solve it for a one dimensional medium</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about strings or air columns.</p>
<p>Occasionally you&rsquo;re talking about things like handpans</p>
<p>or steel drums or metallophones or gamelons, whatever.</p>
<p>And those have a wave equation too,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more chaotic.</p>
<p>The other equation is this crazy thing</p>
<p>that two to the 19 twelfths is almost exactly equal to three,</p>
<p>which is what gave us even temperament.</p>
<p>And so the tension between those two things</p>
<p>is in fact one of these most beautiful stories</p>
<p>inside of that system.</p>
<p>That formula of the baffled king is a discovery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;s not really composing it.</p>
<p>The reason he&rsquo;s baffled,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s imagine that you took like a little brush</p>
<p>and you started brushing off a pyramid under the sands.</p>
<p>You might think that you created the pyramid</p>
<p>by your brushing, but in fact, if somebody else did it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re baffled, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully put, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And as creating one of the greatest songs of all time</p>
<p>and as he&rsquo;s doing it, he&rsquo;s baffled.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s within the song.</p>
<p>And he Leonard is baffled is my contention,</p>
<p>but he knows enough to know that he&rsquo;s baffled, right?</p>
<p>And so the idea is that he is composing,</p>
<p>he has the audacity to compose as David.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s echoing David at a minimum.</p>
<p>And then in a later song,</p>
<p>which I really wish we would discuss,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s totally dystopic and you will not like it at all,</p>
<p>is the future, which contains this line</p>
<p>that I think I used in my episode</p>
<p>with Roger Penrose on the portal.</p>
<p>Note the subtle plug.</p>
<p>The portal, the portal, the portal, the portal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the little Jew that wrote the Bible.</p>
<p>So there is this way in which Leonard Cohen,</p>
<p>I think is constantly coming to the idea</p>
<p>of being a biblical like scribe.</p>
<p>And I think this is one of the great things</p>
<p>that you see Dylan doing this with all along the watchtower.</p>
<p>You saw Warren Zevon, who we should talk much more about,</p>
<p>doing this with a song called I Was in the House</p>
<p>When the House Burned Down.</p>
<p>Do you know this thing?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This is embarrassing.</p>
<p>Sweetheart.</p>
<p>This is a great day.</p>
<p>Warren Zevon is one of the most important songwriters</p>
<p>of our time.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been largely forgotten by this generation.</p>
<p>But Bob Dylan would sing one of his songs in tribute.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard Bob Dylan, you know,</p>
<p>very small number of songwriters really move him.</p>
<p>Woody Guthrie, Gordon Lightfoot, and Warren Zevon.</p>
<p>By the way, Bob Dylan, if you&rsquo;re out there,</p>
<p>appear on either one of our podcasts.</p>
<p>We need to get your voice into a new medium</p>
<p>for a new group.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>This is a time for Bob Dylan, my friend.</p>
<p>Honestly, you&rsquo;ve been doing an amazing job in this space.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I&rsquo;m super excited to do this podcast</p>
<p>again is that I&rsquo;ve learned some things</p>
<p>about what I don&rsquo;t do well.</p>
<p>And I also have sort of struggled with the question,</p>
<p>should I do those things better?</p>
<p>Because what if it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I always use the same example of the fitted sheet</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to put a queen size fitted sheet</p>
<p>on a king size mattress.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, okay, I got that corner squared away.</p>
<p>Then you get another corner that pops off</p>
<p>and they have to go back around.</p>
<p>I wonder whether I can improve my style in the ways in which,</p>
<p>you know, I think it&rsquo;s just a recognition of a difference.</p>
<p>You do a better job of getting to the soul</p>
<p>of a really top intellectual guest</p>
<p>and making them accessible and presenting them</p>
<p>as themselves for a huge number of people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d give my eye tooth to be able to do that.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about this?</p>
<p>Like, cause I think about what is the greatest</p>
<p>conversation I&rsquo;ll ever have.</p>
<p>You know, like in a sense of the portal,</p>
<p>not to reduce it to anything,</p>
<p>but there will be the greatest conversation.</p>
<p>You may have already had it, but it&rsquo;s very possible.</p>
<p>If enough people like me can keep twisting your arm</p>
<p>to keep doing the portal, please,</p>
<p>that is, there&rsquo;ll be an amazing conversation.</p>
<p>One of the questions that I ask myself is like,</p>
<p>who is the person that I&rsquo;m especially equipped?</p>
<p>For some reason, I&rsquo;m convinced on Putin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something in my head that says,</p>
<p>I can do this man better than anyone else in this world.</p>
<p>I got this thought in my head about it, I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m convinced, but I think the universe works</p>
<p>in that way.</p>
<p>Like if it tells you, it&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>The way I would say it is, is that almost everybody</p>
<p>who becomes a Supreme Court justice believes</p>
<p>at a very early age, they&rsquo;re going to become</p>
<p>a Supreme Court justice.</p>
<p>Many people believe at an early age that they can do it,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get there.</p>
<p>But of those who get there, almost all of them</p>
<p>had this sort of, well, I call it pathological</p>
<p>self confidence.</p>
<p>And I do think you have pathological self confidence</p>
<p>and you also have humility.</p>
<p>And most people would hear those as a contradiction.</p>
<p>I think that you would not be able to get away</p>
<p>with what you do if you didn&rsquo;t have the humility.</p>
<p>And so I think the great danger is that your equation</p>
<p>becomes unbalanced, that you either lose the humility</p>
<p>or you lose the humility overwhelms the ego and the drive.</p>
<p>Because right now you&rsquo;ve got a Mexican standoff</p>
<p>in your mind and the rest of us are just benefiting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully put.</p>
<p>My Mexican standoffs aren&rsquo;t as stable as yours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all reservoir dogs all the time.</p>
<p>But actually the person who that describes is Peter Thiel.</p>
<p>Peter Thiel thinks more, people always say like,</p>
<p>what does Peter think about X, Y, and Z, P, and Q?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, do you want communist Peter?</p>
<p>Do you want hyper capitalist Peter?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got all these minds in there, oh my God, right?</p>
<p>On everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s successful is that he&rsquo;s got all these minds</p>
<p>fighting each other.</p>
<p>And so when people say Peter is this or Peter is that,</p>
<p>I just laugh because like nobody who knows him</p>
<p>would describe him as having thoughts at the level</p>
<p>that people are claiming.</p>
<p>And I do think that in my case,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also pathological epistemic humility.</p>
<p>Like just, I know how little I can do in one life.</p>
<p>I know how many things I&rsquo;ve screwed up.</p>
<p>I know how many things I&rsquo;ve got wrong.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, I know that if not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like Hillel&rsquo;s questions,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m not for myself, who will be for me?</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m only for myself, what am I?</p>
<p>If not now, when?</p>
<p>At some level, there&rsquo;s a question about</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t decide that someone is capable</p>
<p>and that that somebody is me.</p>
<p>And if I apply that to everyone else on the planet,</p>
<p>then nobody&rsquo;s gonna do anything.</p>
<p>And so I do think that one of the things</p>
<p>that people like you and I get is who are you to say that?</p>
<p>F that, man, just sign me up for some Dunning Kruger.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s multiple minds like you said.</p>
<p>Like this morning, I was feeling so good and confident</p>
<p>about I couldn&rsquo;t think no wrong.</p>
<p>And I remember last night clearly thinking</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m the dumbest human who&rsquo;s ever lived</p>
<p>and nothing I&rsquo;ve ever said is worth anything.</p>
<p>What the fuck am I doing with my life?</p>
<p>Why am I scared?</p>
<p>I was terrified of this conversation.</p>
<p>Who the hell am I?</p>
<p>This conversation?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m an idiot.</p>
<p>And because, you know, Lex, but no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>But this morning, I was the baddest motherfucker</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s ever walked this earth.</p>
<p>So I was very conscious.</p>
<p>I think it was the coffee, I&rsquo;m not sure, maybe some sleep.</p>
<p>This sounds very Russian and it involves multiple beverages,</p>
<p>some of them being alcoholic, others containing caffeine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, in fact, I can&rsquo;t share the story behind it,</p>
<p>but there is a bottle of vodka in the fridge.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I should have hit you for coffee</p>
<p>because this is a morning show here.</p>
<p>So I put out a call that we get a chance</p>
<p>to have this conversation</p>
<p>and people ask these wonderful questions.</p>
<p>A few people asked about depression and suicide.</p>
<p>This is a Russian program, so we have to go there.</p>
<p>And I think about Leonard Cohen</p>
<p>and one of the things that always kind of broke my heart</p>
<p>and kind of suffocated the hope I have for just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, for love in a person&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>is to hear how much depression was a part</p>
<p>of Leonard Cohen&rsquo;s life and how much he suffered.</p>
<p>I guess one way, I&rsquo;m not sure where we can go</p>
<p>with this question, but do you think about the places</p>
<p>that the mind can go, like these dark places?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there something like where the only escape out</p>
<p>is suicide, for example, that&rsquo;s the darkest version of it?</p>
<p>That, I really think suicide is a big place</p>
<p>in suicidal ideation and self harm</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t talk a lot about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a similar problem to trying to talk about trans.</p>
<p>These are umbrella categories.</p>
<p>And if the commonality is that somebody harms themselves,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>because of a problem in brain chemistry,</p>
<p>because of an event in their life,</p>
<p>whether evolutionary programming for suicide</p>
<p>is weirdly normal, whether or not</p>
<p>it might have a religious motivation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many different forms of self harm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something like the 10th largest killer thereabouts.</p>
<p>And I think that you can look at it from different angles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to have had Pete Seeger come to my college</p>
<p>when I was at university and to watch his good humor</p>
<p>in the face of all adversity.</p>
<p>I think of Odetta, I used to go to Odetta concerts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who she is.</p>
<p>Okay, this is gonna be one of the better days of your life.</p>
<p>Check out Odetta when we&rsquo;re done with the interview.</p>
<p>She was a civil rights figure,</p>
<p>but also just had a profound voice and great musicianship.</p>
<p>These people were in the struggle, right?</p>
<p>And they saw lots of bad things happen</p>
<p>and they kept their humor about them.</p>
<p>And the thing is that you can take on the Weltschmerz,</p>
<p>the pain of the planet,</p>
<p>or you can try to do something else,</p>
<p>which is to be a happy warrior,</p>
<p>even if the odds are terrible</p>
<p>and the cost of failure is catastrophic.</p>
<p>So even when surrounded by darkness.</p>
<p>But the thing is with Leonard Cohen</p>
<p>is he created such beautiful music.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s like Anthony Bourdain, the same.</p>
<p>And yet they go to this dark place.</p>
<p>And it could be, it&rsquo;s easy to say it&rsquo;s just biochemistry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a linkage between this highly generative,</p>
<p>creative side and in some cases,</p>
<p>dark depression, in other cases, not.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s tied,</p>
<p>the genius and madness are always co traveling</p>
<p>or the beauty and pain are one in the same.</p>
<p>What you can say is that there&rsquo;s a cluster of people</p>
<p>that tell you that for that cluster,</p>
<p>there is a relationship between the darkness and the beauty.</p>
<p>And I do think that in part,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s squaring circles that can&rsquo;t be squared.</p>
<p>We were just talking before about the inability</p>
<p>to serve two perfect systems,</p>
<p>the perfect system of the wave equation</p>
<p>and the perfect system of even temperament.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both perfect, they&rsquo;re not compatible.</p>
<p>And once you realize that there is perfection</p>
<p>and an inability to make contact with perfection,</p>
<p>I think you recognize that there is no solution</p>
<p>to this world.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s weird with the poets and musicians.</p>
<p>Do you want to say this is a particular thing that you do,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s Spanish fly by Van Halen.</p>
<p>And then you realize, oh, well,</p>
<p>what do you get out of Spanish fly by Van Halen?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very singular because of the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s purely acoustic.</p>
<p>For some reason, I always,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t imagine Eddie Van Halen separate from the band</p>
<p>in front of thousands of people just screaming</p>
<p>and rocking out with lights everywhere.</p>
<p>And Spanish fly made me think like,</p>
<p>it made me imagine him sitting alone</p>
<p>on a couch in a room.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s who he was, I really do.</p>
<p>I mean, believe me, I get it.</p>
<p>He was a rockstar, he was a rock god.</p>
<p>Got it, got it, got it, got it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost positive that you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>to where he got to without being a complete introvert.</p>
<p>Yeah, it made me imagine</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some half naked supermodel walking around,</p>
<p>hoping that they can do their thing together.</p>
<p>And Eddie&rsquo;s completely disinterested.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be with the guitar.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be with the guitar, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because honestly, at some level,</p>
<p>in one case, maybe you&rsquo;re conquesting,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re pursuing love and romance.</p>
<p>In the other case, you&rsquo;re talking about a relationship</p>
<p>to the order, the creator, the almighty,</p>
<p>whatever it is you want to call that substrate</p>
<p>that is reality.</p>
<p>And do I believe that Eddie Van Halen</p>
<p>and Jimi Hendrix and Paganini and Heifetz</p>
<p>jacked into the true essence of the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, they did.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as good as differential geometry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s amazing for other reasons.</p>
<p>And thank God, because it&rsquo;s very typical</p>
<p>to communicate differential geometry at scale.</p>
<p>But the thing about eruption, for example,</p>
<p>what level do you want to come into eruption?</p>
<p>Do you want just the sheer majesty and pageantry?</p>
<p>Do you want the theatrics?</p>
<p>Like you could put him on wires</p>
<p>and set his pants on fire or whatever,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;d be totally in keeping with it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you want to talk</p>
<p>to something completely precise</p>
<p>that shows off the virtuosity</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s possible with the Stratocaster.</p>
<p>Everything works.</p>
<p>Multi axis.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a precision to it,</p>
<p>which is very different than Hendrix.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a messiness to Hendrix that to me,</p>
<p>somebody who has OCD has always been a struggle.</p>
<p>How does Hendrix affect you?</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s have the Jimi Hendrix conversation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that we can do anything to it</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t already been done to it.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Maybe the idea is that every generation</p>
<p>has to have its Hendrix conversation,</p>
<p>and this is a long form part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Jimi Hendrix experience.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so funny.</p>
<p>I hear you stole it from Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many details.</p>
<p>One, it hurt my soul on so many levels</p>
<p>that you can put a thumb over the guitar</p>
<p>to play a note, to hold the note.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t, because I want it to be the Russian virtuoso</p>
<p>that sits with his classical guitar in a perfect form,</p>
<p>plays really fast with the fingers,</p>
<p>and then you want the thumb to be perfectly relaxed</p>
<p>and supporting the neck.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the Russian conservatory student.</p>
<p>Conservatory student, yeah.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the Russian wild man.</p>
<p>Which one is that?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re different Russian archetypes, right?</p>
<p>So the completely idiosyncratic Russian</p>
<p>is very different in a weird way from the,</p>
<p>I can do this backwards in any key in my sleep</p>
<p>and in any time signature that you just snap your fingers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve discussed my piano tuner in previous episodes.</p>
<p>No, no, that was offline conversation.</p>
<p>You told me the story.</p>
<p>I should tell you the story.</p>
<p>You should retell the story.</p>
<p>There I was in darkest Manhattan</p>
<p>with the world&rsquo;s shittiest, it wasn&rsquo;t even an upright,</p>
<p>it was a spinet piano.</p>
<p>A friend had given it to me.</p>
<p>The piano fell out of tune and I would have to tune it.</p>
<p>And the only tuner I knew was this Russian guy</p>
<p>and I hated dealing with him.</p>
<p>There was something about his attitude</p>
<p>that just really rubbed me the wrong way.</p>
<p>So anyway, my wife says, tune that thing.</p>
<p>So we get the piano tuner to come and he&rsquo;s tuning this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, are you sure you wanna tune this piece of shit?</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, okay, it&rsquo;s your money.</p>
<p>The phone rings and I have the phone ringer set</p>
<p>on a landline to Paganini Caprice 24.</p>
<p>And immediately as the phone rings,</p>
<p>he figures out what key the phone ringer is</p>
<p>and which is not the key that like list composed</p>
<p>the variations on Caprice 24.</p>
<p>And he starts going into theme and variations</p>
<p>on Caprice 24 at some level I&rsquo;ve never heard before,</p>
<p>just jaw dropping it.</p>
<p>And like the phone stops ringing</p>
<p>and we have this awkward silence.</p>
<p>I said, I didn&rsquo;t know you were such a great piano player.</p>
<p>And then he says one of these things</p>
<p>in Russian accented English hurts in a way</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
<p>He said, no, you are the piano player.</p>
<p>I am merely the piano tuner.</p>
<p>And I was just like, oh man, through the heart.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of reminiscent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear actually your opinion.</p>
<p>This is reminiscent of the Good Will Hunting story.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>That movie?</p>
<p>That movie.</p>
<p>What about it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s MIT.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess when I think of that film,</p>
<p>I think about Matt Damon as a young guy,</p>
<p>risking everything, giving up Harvard.</p>
<p>I think probably the most accomplished group</p>
<p>of people in the world are people</p>
<p>who choose to give up Harvard voluntarily.</p>
<p>Beautiful, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Bigger than Harvard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very true.</p>
<p>Ives was one of these people, Bill Gates, of course.</p>
<p>And then oddly, you know.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>But then Steve Jobs gave up a Reed,</p>
<p>and Reed is like the weirdest, craziest college</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>People should pay much more attention to Reed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s going through a hard time at the moment,</p>
<p>but what it was before the current craziness</p>
<p>is really an interesting story.</p>
<p>Irregardless, as we say in the 617 Area Code,</p>
<p>I think that a lot of my reaction</p>
<p>is to the real story of Matt Damon having this vision</p>
<p>and being the young guy to pull it off.</p>
<p>And I also think about Robin Williams</p>
<p>trying to explore heart through this lens of acting.</p>
<p>And as you and I, you&rsquo;ve hung out with comedians.</p>
<p>They know that they already screwed up a bunch of people.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re proud about it.</p>
<p>They really are.</p>
<p>The idea that Robin Williams, who I saw many years ago</p>
<p>when I was in LA in the comedy clubs around here,</p>
<p>he was a straight up crazy, dysregulated genius</p>
<p>in tremendous pain.</p>
<p>And his desire to do it earnestly through acting</p>
<p>rather than constantly by just sniping</p>
<p>or being a clown or showing us how fast his mind worked</p>
<p>relative to ours, I was really moved by that.</p>
<p>I thought that he brought some authenticity</p>
<p>and took a huge risk for a comedian to be that real.</p>
<p>And again, like you said, it doesn&rsquo;t always have to be,</p>
<p>but in that case, the madness and the genius were neighbors.</p>
<p>That one couldn&rsquo;t have been any other way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, because his mind,</p>
<p>the thing about seeing him in a comedy club</p>
<p>was that he would react to random stimulus</p>
<p>in the environment.</p>
<p>You know, it could be a heckler.</p>
<p>Sometimes you almost got the feeling</p>
<p>that he wanted a heckler</p>
<p>because it gave him something to play against, right?</p>
<p>He was infinitely, instantly inventive.</p>
<p>But I actually, to me, the best Robin Williams</p>
<p>is as he got closer and closer to the end of his life</p>
<p>because there was a sadness</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s almost fighting the sadness</p>
<p>with this improvisational,</p>
<p>like the weapons he has is this wit and humor</p>
<p>and this dancing that he does with language.</p>
<p>But, and then sometimes when you just fall silent,</p>
<p>you can see the sadness.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s something so beautiful about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this bird with a broken wing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like trying to fly, you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s getting older and older.</p>
<p>And I mean, those,</p>
<p>he would have made a one hell of a podcast guest,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sad.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have some sadness that I really do think</p>
<p>that part of what we call podcasting</p>
<p>is actually just getting to know a soul</p>
<p>over and over again.</p>
<p>Like maybe the idea is that this is talking about depression</p>
<p>and sadness and heavy feelings</p>
<p>is not an American specialty.</p>
<p>Seeing that in context with the beauty of life</p>
<p>is a Russian specialty.</p>
<p>Like it is very much.</p>
<p>Russian specialty, sounds like a diner menu.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want the Russian specialty?</p>
<p>A big scoop of ice cream with tons of depression.</p>
<p>I do think that we&rsquo;re in a really terrifying</p>
<p>and depressing time.</p>
<p>And I think that part of it is that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if something huge is about to get started.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t even know what this is.</p>
<p>I mean, we just sit here in this weird world</p>
<p>that is falling into some new state</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not even super curious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what the hell just happened?</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s got an answer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m positive that all of those answers are wrong.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to at least sneak up on the good answer.</p>
<p>So the central core of the answer is</p>
<p>that the US seemed to be the greatest thing in the world</p>
<p>in large measure because we hadn&rsquo;t noticed</p>
<p>that we were getting a benefit from having no plan,</p>
<p>not having to make a plan for low growth.</p>
<p>As long as we had growth, we were in great shape.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that you could run an experiment,</p>
<p>you have a billion copies of Earth</p>
<p>and you start the initial conditions slightly different.</p>
<p>On some giant number of planets,</p>
<p>a lot of the things that were discovered</p>
<p>from the 1800s through the end of the 20th century</p>
<p>are discovered in a period of time</p>
<p>because a lot of that just has to do with</p>
<p>once you crack the puzzle of getting better instruments,</p>
<p>you can see more.</p>
<p>And the more you can see,</p>
<p>the more you can make use of what you can see.</p>
<p>And it turns out there was lots of stuff to do</p>
<p>with like germs or electron orbitals</p>
<p>or spectrum, electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>And so we got to do all of those things</p>
<p>and the US roughly corresponded</p>
<p>for a good chunk of its history with this bonanza.</p>
<p>And so of course we look like an amazing genius country.</p>
<p>We have no plan.</p>
<p>Imagine that you could sell a car,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to put in seat belts,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to put in airbags,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to put in rear view mirrors or sensors</p>
<p>or a rear view mirror.</p>
<p>You could save a lot of money on a car</p>
<p>by not putting in all of the stuff</p>
<p>to keep things from going wrong.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what we had.</p>
<p>We had a machine that as long as growth was insanely good,</p>
<p>we plowed it back, the riches and spoils and then treasure</p>
<p>back into the system and made more genius stuff.</p>
<p>And we carried along a good chunk of humanity,</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>We did not have a plan for what happens</p>
<p>when the growth goes below the stall speed of our society.</p>
<p>How confident should we be that the growth has slowed</p>
<p>in a way that is permanent rather than a kind of slap</p>
<p>in the face where we&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the right concept.</p>
<p>Right concept is, I try to use the same words</p>
<p>over and over again in case people see mold</p>
<p>because then the perseveration actually gets somewhere.</p>
<p>So I use this analogy of the orchard</p>
<p>because everyone talks about low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>They know the concept of low hanging fruit,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t think in terms of orchards.</p>
<p>So they say things like,</p>
<p>you think we&rsquo;ve picked all the low hanging fruit,</p>
<p>but I believe in the inventiveness of the human mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, that doesn&rsquo;t even work as an analogy.</p>
<p>What if the idea is we only picked</p>
<p>all the low hanging fruit here,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re having this stupid argument</p>
<p>about low hanging fruit,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not going and looking for new orchards.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not planting new orchards.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not looking for forests.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just sitting here arguing about low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>So my claim is there&rsquo;s probably a lot more low hanging fruit</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in other orchards.</p>
<p>One of those turned out to be the digital orchard.</p>
<p>The digital orchard has not been as stagnant</p>
<p>as lots of these other, like the chemical orchard.</p>
<p>I have faith that there is a small percentage</p>
<p>of the population, but not zero,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s looking for those other orchards.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m excited about one of those orchards,</p>
<p>which is, I believe there&rsquo;ll be robots in everybody&rsquo;s homes</p>
<p>and that will unlock some totally new thing.</p>
<p>Totally new set of technologies, ideas,</p>
<p>the way we live life, the productivity,</p>
<p>all the everything, it&rsquo;ll change everything.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited about that orchard.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m roaming that orchard</p>
<p>and wondering how the hell you kind of bring back</p>
<p>like the ant that finds a new source of food.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find an apple I can bring back to the.</p>
<p>Great, so you&rsquo;re in an explorer idiom.</p>
<p>And do you have faith that there&rsquo;s enough of those?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there are very many of us.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m one of them too.</p>
<p>How many does it take?</p>
<p>It takes one ant.</p>
<p>It takes one ant.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>How many elons does it take to screw in a light bulb?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s imagine that we went,</p>
<p>imagine some ant goes and finds a new source of food, right?</p>
<p>And then it comes back to the colony and it says,</p>
<p>hey, I think I found a new source of food.</p>
<p>And the initial reaction is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not authorized to find new food.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Why would you try to go find new food?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna remove you from Twitter.</p>
<p>Yeah, and by the way,</p>
<p>I think the fact that you think you&rsquo;re allowed</p>
<p>to go find new food shows how privileged you are as an ant.</p>
<p>Get out of the colony, kill him, kill him.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s probably not a great model</p>
<p>for finding new orchards.</p>
<p>And I think that what we find is that</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a system that allows somebody to ascend</p>
<p>without a lot of gatekeeping, you can have that.</p>
<p>But I saw this happen in hedge funds.</p>
<p>Hedge funds for a while hoovered up a lot of talent</p>
<p>because they were places that had funding and had freedom.</p>
<p>And in general, really smart people want to be free</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t wanna think a lot about</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re gonna feed themselves.</p>
<p>They wanna get lost in their minds.</p>
<p>So you can either give them productive places to play,</p>
<p>dangerous places to play.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re either gonna break into computers</p>
<p>or find vaccines for you or build bombs or build companies.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not providing for the people who have to disrupt</p>
<p>and have to innovate and trying to channel that effort.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so focused on this other thing,</p>
<p>which is fairness and safety.</p>
<p>And fairness and safety, by the way, are really important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna denigrate them.</p>
<p>But the singular focus on fairness and safety</p>
<p>without, in the same breath, being focused on growth</p>
<p>and discovery and creation is gonna doom us</p>
<p>because what we&rsquo;re talking about is we&rsquo;re always talking</p>
<p>about divvying up the pie that is</p>
<p>as opposed to the pie that will be.</p>
<p>Imagine that you spent all your time trying to divvy up</p>
<p>the 13th century pie and you destroyed your ability</p>
<p>to get to the 20th century.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be an idiot.</p>
<p>But one place I think I disagree with you</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t think you need that many people</p>
<p>to empower the geniuses, the innovators,</p>
<p>the people who refuse to spend most of their days</p>
<p>in meetings about fairness.</p>
<p>This is good.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a disagreement.</p>
<p>I think podcasting, whatever you call that medium,</p>
<p>is just one little example of a tool</p>
<p>that you can give power to,</p>
<p>like you and your podcast can have the next Elon Musk</p>
<p>and make him a star.</p>
<p>Now I see where you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There have been a series of places</p>
<p>for people to play and be free.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve lost them successively.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good place you remember?</p>
<p>Because I disagree with you there too.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re still there.</p>
<p>You can still play.</p>
<p>You interviewed Noam Chomsky.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky comes from an era.</p>
<p>Where you can play?</p>
<p>Where you could play?</p>
<p>At MIT.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t play.</p>
<p>This is where I disagree with you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already had this.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Go check the Clips channel for the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>I think I wasn&rsquo;t brave enough at that time</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not really brave enough now.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the vodka?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feeling and people are gonna tear me apart.</p>
<p>Oh, what are you?</p>
<p>And you speak from emotion and facts.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>The feeling.</p>
<p>What podcast is this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Tell the people who are currently editing your brain,</p>
<p>because I saw that move right now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That they should go find another podcast.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get rid of some of your audience right now.</p>
<p>Please go find another podcast</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re editing my brain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all the self doubt,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sitting in that brain.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand to watch this.</p>
<p>But all right.</p>
<p>What is this self doubt loop that you&rsquo;re in?</p>
<p>The thing is,</p>
<p>when I walk the halls of MIT.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s bureaucracy, there&rsquo;s administrators</p>
<p>that never have done anything interesting</p>
<p>in their entire lives.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s meetings, there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>All the usual crap.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, in the eyes of individuals.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this glow of excitement</p>
<p>that has nothing to do with career.</p>
<p>I understand this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still a playground.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little pockets of playgrounds</p>
<p>from which genius can emerge still.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re unaffected by diversity meetings</p>
<p>or fairness meetings or blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I love to hear that.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t think so?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;ve watched the change, Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched people.</p>
<p>We were all editing ourselves all the time.</p>
<p>I remember my old mind.</p>
<p>I liked it better.</p>
<p>All of this relentless focus on critical race theory</p>
<p>and critical theory, postmodernism, fairness,</p>
<p>social justice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making many of us into worse people.</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Do you think the Matt Damon&rsquo;s of the character</p>
<p>is paying attention to any of that?</p>
<p>You think that has an effect?</p>
<p>Have you seen what happened to Matt Damon himself?</p>
<p>Matt Damon has tried to say various things at various times</p>
<p>that seemed to be relatively innocuous.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s not mix up.</p>
<p>Matt Damon is just an actor.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He was just a Harvard student</p>
<p>who came up with his own genius screenplay,</p>
<p>acted and made it happen.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re somewhere else.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think you can build a rocket company</p>
<p>out of MIT still?</p>
<p>I think that there are things that you can still do.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re losing them.</p>
<p>We lose them.</p>
<p>We keep losing them.</p>
<p>I would say the biggest problem,</p>
<p>here, let me just say,</p>
<p>what I think the solution would be</p>
<p>is to fire anybody who&rsquo;s not faculty,</p>
<p>especially young faculty should have way more power</p>
<p>and administration should have much less power.</p>
<p>Because right now, the administration,</p>
<p>which used some of the, who used to be faculty,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve lost the fire, the spark that gave them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve lost the memories of the playground.</p>
<p>And so the people that admire and love the playground,</p>
<p>like you could see it in their behavior,</p>
<p>should have way more power.</p>
<p>And so we should create a systems that give them power.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very idealistic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re very, you&rsquo;ve got a huge heart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird time.</p>
<p>Cause I don&rsquo;t want to dissuade you</p>
<p>from believing beautiful things.</p>
<p>Because I see how potent you are.</p>
<p>You do all these things,</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu, guitar, podcasting, programming, computers,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in a really deeply screwed up place</p>
<p>where even the tiny number of,</p>
<p>let me give you an alternate version of this dystopia.</p>
<p>I do think that there are people who are capable</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s still places to play</p>
<p>and cause things to happen that progress the story forward.</p>
<p>But if you look at the fire that some of the people are in</p>
<p>who fit that profile,</p>
<p>like how much crap has Elon Musk taken?</p>
<p>Quite considerable, right?</p>
<p>And not much admiration from the&hellip;</p>
<p>Craig Venter, Jim Watson.</p>
<p>These are very difficult people.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs is a very difficult guy, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a bit heartbreaking to me.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody is different generations.</p>
<p>I just, my mind is a little focused on Elon Musk</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s the modern person.</p>
<p>Well, you know him.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a person to you.</p>
<p>It hurts my heart to see how few faculty</p>
<p>and people with Nobel prizes and so on admire Elon.</p>
<p>He gets a lot of fans from people that buy his products</p>
<p>and young minds just excited.</p>
<p>But why don&rsquo;t we as an institution,</p>
<p>why doesn&rsquo;t MIT say that somebody amongst us</p>
<p>will be the next Elon Musk and we want to encourage them?</p>
<p>Like say that, say that in meetings, say that.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s success for us as MIT.</p>
<p>And they, instead there&rsquo;s this jealousy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, did you hear what Elon Musk tweeted?</p>
<p>Did you see, like how irresponsible is what he&rsquo;s doing?</p>
<p>How, like you&rsquo;re just saying all these things</p>
<p>that are just dripping with jealousy and basically&hellip;</p>
<p>I want what he&rsquo;s got.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the weird thing.</p>
<p>Rivalry has a different signature.</p>
<p>You see, when you know that you&rsquo;re never going to make it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the position you take.</p>
<p>What is it in Kung Fu Panda, which you&rsquo;ve watched now?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>What does Tai Lung say when he&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>for the dragon warrior and the furious five</p>
<p>come to defeat him on the bridge?</p>
<p>One of them gives up Poe&rsquo;s name accidentally</p>
<p>and Tai Lung hears it.</p>
<p>Poe, so that is his name.</p>
<p>Finally, a worthy opponent.</p>
<p>Our battle will be legendary, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s excited.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Well, you learn about this in boxing.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll see a division or an MMA,</p>
<p>which is lousy with talent.</p>
<p>Just, you can&rsquo;t swing a cat</p>
<p>without hitting an amazing athlete.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have a division,</p>
<p>which at that particular moment has one star</p>
<p>and no real competition in that weight class or something.</p>
<p>That person is in bad shape</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t build a legend without the other.</p>
<p>When you think of Muhammad Ali,</p>
<p>what are the names that you immediately think of?</p>
<p>And you have to phrase your,</p>
<p>you have to think of the other heavyweights.</p>
<p>Liston.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So those opponents are in part what made Muhammad Ali</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the Mayweather McGregor revelation that,</p>
<p>okay, this guy has got his opponent&rsquo;s picture in his house.</p>
<p>How weird is that?</p>
<p>Well, because without the opponent,</p>
<p>you may not be able to get there.</p>
<p>Now, I am not a huge fan of the wrong kinds of rivalries.</p>
<p>Do you have examples in mind?</p>
<p>Well, there are rivalries</p>
<p>where people take each other&rsquo;s credit cards</p>
<p>and take each other&rsquo;s credit and screw each other over.</p>
<p>And then there are other rivalries like the RNA Thai Club</p>
<p>where these guys were so in love with what they were doing</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t wait to share everything.</p>
<p>And like Nobel prizes were so abundant</p>
<p>that most people got Nobel prizes</p>
<p>just for being a member of the RNA Thai Club</p>
<p>and doing cool stuff.</p>
<p>And yeah, that&rsquo;s the golden kind of sweet spot.</p>
<p>Most of these people can&rsquo;t do what Elon&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t break rules,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t take the pressure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what really concerns me</p>
<p>about your perspective.</p>
<p>I think that there are a lot of genius ideas</p>
<p>inside of people who don&rsquo;t have the stomach</p>
<p>for conflict and derision.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of those people are female.</p>
<p>And I think that until we come up with a world</p>
<p>in which we can swat down the trolls,</p>
<p>or we can actually cause the trolls not to ruin everything.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean by shutting them up,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean by being brutal to them,</p>
<p>but somehow separating off people who are working</p>
<p>and people who are trolling.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;re losing a huge amount of human genius</p>
<p>in part because women in particular</p>
<p>are not necessarily going to push an idea</p>
<p>if it results in 10 years of being derided.</p>
<p>Very few men are willing to do that either.</p>
<p>But there are some of us who are so dumb</p>
<p>that we will pigheadedly stick to an idea for 10 years</p>
<p>even if the world collapses.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there are as many women</p>
<p>who are going to make that calculation</p>
<p>even if they know the idea is correct.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I believe technology</p>
<p>can help us fight the trolls,</p>
<p>of all definitions of troll,</p>
<p>like I believe that a better Twitter can be built.</p>
<p>Interesting, I do not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that a Twitter successor can be built</p>
<p>that solves most of the problems.</p>
<p>I think you can always improve what we have,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that converges in something</p>
<p>that really works because I think ultimately</p>
<p>the problem isn&rsquo;t Twitter, the problem is us.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve recently made</p>
<p>a very disturbing realization,</p>
<p>which is academics and social scientists</p>
<p>and academics and trolls have very many similar behaviors.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s largely a trolling community.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that the trolls are not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the Peter Thiel mini mind idea,</p>
<p>which in all of the trolls,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the possibility of goodness.</p>
<p>And all you have to do, not all you have to do,</p>
<p>what you have to do is create technology</p>
<p>that incentivizes them to embrace,</p>
<p>to discover, to embrace,</p>
<p>to practice the better angels of their nature.</p>
<p>And I believe that people actually want to do that.</p>
<p>The trolls is a short term dopamine rush</p>
<p>of childish toxicity that all of us want to overcome.</p>
<p>I believe that like deep within, we want to overcome that.</p>
<p>I try to keep myself from believing what you believe.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;d be disappointed if it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s dangerous,</p>
<p>because a lot of these people are implacable foes</p>
<p>and there aren&rsquo;t many of them,</p>
<p>but when you meet somebody who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>yeah, I just like screwing people up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here for the pain.</p>
<p>I just believe even in them, there&rsquo;s a good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful book that I&rsquo;m gonna recommend to you</p>
<p>where I hope this comes from.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ve got the source wrong,</p>
<p>but in any event, it&rsquo;s a great book</p>
<p>called Maximum City about Bombay.</p>
<p>And I believe the conceit is that the author</p>
<p>leaves Bombay as a kid and comes back as an adult</p>
<p>and he realizes he has to rediscover the city</p>
<p>because he can&rsquo;t live in the city he left.</p>
<p>So he gets in contact with all of the weird areas</p>
<p>of the city and one of them is the underworld.</p>
<p>He hangs out with the police,</p>
<p>but in the underworld, he&rsquo;s talking to contract killers.</p>
<p>And he says, you know, it&rsquo;s really weird.</p>
<p>Everybody pleads for their life right before I kill them.</p>
<p>And they always say this thing about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got two kids at home.</p>
<p>He says, never say that to a contract killer</p>
<p>because we have terrible relationships with our parents.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it dare us to do that?</p>
<p>And I was just thinking like, oh, wow.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a minus sign in front of that statement.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sitting there saying, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a three year old, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, well, I&rsquo;m gonna take this POS out of that kid&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll have a chance.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how people are wired.</p>
<p>And as much as I hate to say it,</p>
<p>there are people whose wiring is so disturbing</p>
<p>and so different from yours</p>
<p>that you will never guess why you can&rsquo;t reach them</p>
<p>or how much pleasure they may have gotten</p>
<p>because they may have gone over a point of no return.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you are just a smart guy</p>
<p>who is using his intuition to make a hypothesis.</p>
<p>You do not know this for sure.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>And I am, you know, whatever the hell I am</p>
<p>that has a different hypothesis</p>
<p>that even in the darkest human beings</p>
<p>that seem to be only full of evil,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good person there that could be discovered.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons I love doing your show</p>
<p>is that you have these beliefs, even as a Russian.</p>
<p>The Russian special.</p>
<p>As you know, the Russian, there is a weirdness</p>
<p>which is a total cynicism and total idealism</p>
<p>locked together, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very much a part of the Russian character.</p>
<p>The reason I kept bothering you,</p>
<p>kept bothering you to have this conversation</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m really worried about the next couple of months.</p>
<p>No kidding.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s anybody in this world</p>
<p>that could help alleviate my worry</p>
<p>by at least walking along with me</p>
<p>through this worry of mine, it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re headed towards some kind of civil war?</p>
<p>Some kind of division that explodes</p>
<p>beyond just stuff on Twitter,</p>
<p>but something that&rsquo;s really destructive</p>
<p>to the fabric of our society?</p>
<p>Well, I believe we&rsquo;re in a revolution, as you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve called it the no name revolution</p>
<p>or N squared revolution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about it for years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I think waiting for this</p>
<p>to be called a civil war is not smart.</p>
<p>Only history will call it such.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>But I think that the problem is</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re encountering things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve never seen trying to fit them</p>
<p>into things that you already know.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>But history repeats itself.</p>
<p>Yes, ish.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see lessons from history in.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>We see today.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t see it repeating itself.</p>
<p>You know, the famous quote is that it rhymes.</p>
<p>It rhymes.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing I guess I&rsquo;m speaking to is violence.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in there.</p>
<p>The abstraction of violence.</p>
<p>Imagine you were coding up violence as an abstract class.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Thank you for speaking to the audience.</p>
<p>Trying to lose these people.</p>
<p>Come with me.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ve dealt with your audience</p>
<p>and your audience contains the smartest people around.</p>
<p>I guarantee you if I say some stuff,</p>
<p>first of all, any wrong thing that I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna detail.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;ll be a little bit of catnip</p>
<p>to bring in the smart people.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll also digest it for each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the great lessons of long form podcasting.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t waste all your time explaining things,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the job of the audience to do amongst themselves.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re happy doing the work.</p>
<p>And those who aren&rsquo;t, they leave.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that great?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll leave.</p>
<p>The people who don&rsquo;t wanna struggle will leave.</p>
<p>You can get rid of them.</p>
<p>I think that the point is you would want to say</p>
<p>violence is defined relative to a context.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s call it meta violence so that we don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>into the problem.</p>
<p>We already have a term for physical violence, right?</p>
<p>So we have meta violence and physical violence.</p>
<p>I would say that physical violence</p>
<p>is subclassed from meta violence.</p>
<p>Meta violence is the disruption of a system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of, for example, if a cell dies,</p>
<p>you can die through apoptosis or necrosis.</p>
<p>Apoptosis is controlled programmed cell death.</p>
<p>Necrosis is just like, okay, this didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>That was a violent disruption of the system.</p>
<p>And this meta class is presumed in the documentation.</p>
<p>Is it all negative?</p>
<p>No, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>So this is part of the problem</p>
<p>in the madness of our age, right?</p>
<p>Which is if you open up a drawer in your cabinet,</p>
<p>right, in your kitchen,</p>
<p>and you see knives, spoons, and forks,</p>
<p>do you have a sense that the spoons are good utensils</p>
<p>and the knives or forks are bad utensils</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re mean?</p>
<p>I mean, like if you start thinking in these terms,</p>
<p>that knife is there to do violence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s violence you want done, right?</p>
<p>When I cut a mango, I&rsquo;m doing violence to the mango.</p>
<p>The mango expects that I will do violence to it</p>
<p>because otherwise I won&rsquo;t be able to get the meat</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t get its seed spread somewhere else.</p>
<p>So in part, violence is absolutely part of our story.</p>
<p>So, okay, so there&rsquo;s this meta violence class.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>So the meta violence class is already,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a multiple inheritance pattern.</p>
<p>Whatever&rsquo;s going on right now inherits from meta violence.</p>
<p>No, but there&rsquo;s certain subclasses</p>
<p>that allow evil to emerge.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m specifically worried about is that&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s on your mind, Lex?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really going on?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I worry that amidst the chaos of these protests</p>
<p>or the chaos that could be created by the feeling</p>
<p>that the election does not represent the voice</p>
<p>of the people, like saying that whoever gets,</p>
<p>quote unquote, wins the election</p>
<p>according to some kind of reporting of the numbers</p>
<p>that come out, that&rsquo;s not going to represent</p>
<p>what people actually want to be the leader.</p>
<p>Like something in that narrative will create</p>
<p>so much division that people will resort</p>
<p>to literal violence, like protests that really&hellip;</p>
<p>That the United States loses its united aspect.</p>
<p>And because of that, because of that chaos and tension,</p>
<p>evil people, evil forces that my definition of evil</p>
<p>is just cruel human beings use that moment to attain power.</p>
<p>The kind of power that is ultimately goes against the ideal</p>
<p>of the United States.</p>
<p>That could be Donald Trump.</p>
<p>That could be another human being.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>My worry is that love doesn&rsquo;t win out in this.</p>
<p>The unity doesn&rsquo;t win out in this.</p>
<p>And I feel like you and I have responsibility.</p>
<p>No kidding. Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>And so how do we let love win in this moment</p>
<p>of potential chaos? We&rsquo;re gonna have to fight for it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to become a fighter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to throw some serious punches</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you want.</p>
<p>You have to be Muhammad Ali here</p>
<p>because the moment you start criticizing anything,</p>
<p>people, you have to be a masterful communicator because&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Look, Lex, in part, your decency is allowing you</p>
<p>to do things that you couldn&rsquo;t otherwise do.</p>
<p>I saw that you had Michael Malice on your podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, Michael Malice is, I think of somebody</p>
<p>who at his best is extremely shrewd and insightful, yes?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also got this trolling game,</p>
<p>which he&rsquo;s quite open about and you talk to him about it,</p>
<p>which I can&rsquo;t stand.</p>
<p>And this is the idea, oh, grandpa doesn&rsquo;t get the internet.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m grandpa, I don&rsquo;t get the internet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love the trolling.</p>
<p>There are trolls of the past who were incredibly good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any of the modern trolls</p>
<p>as being that kind of genius level trolling the people</p>
<p>who deserve it in the way that they deserve it.</p>
<p>Right now, what I see is that anything</p>
<p>that stands up gets cut down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like anything earnest,</p>
<p>you have to turn it into cynicism and a meme.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this idea that the people who believe</p>
<p>that the world is chaos and has no point</p>
<p>are constantly trying to let you know,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try to use the internet for meaning,</p>
<p>for decency, for goodness, because we are going to find out</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s all sanctimonious hypocrisy.</p>
<p>And we will make you suffer.</p>
<p>So I do think that there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of sanctimonious hypocrisy in the world.</p>
<p>Some of it mine, some of it yours, but we all have it.</p>
<p>And the trolls somewhat remove that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a judicious, kind, constructive,</p>
<p>compassionate, caring version most of the time.</p>
<p>And a lot of those trolls,</p>
<p>and I have this feeling about Michael Malice,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s somebody who deeply cares and loves beneath it</p>
<p>and that that&rsquo;s motivating some of the trolling behavior.</p>
<p>And you and I don&rsquo;t seem to be doing that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see you as almost ever trolling.</p>
<p>Now you and I, I&rsquo;m very much against trolling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much against trolling.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s selective.</p>
<p>You know what, it&rsquo;s not even true.</p>
<p>Like everything we say, we say like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for it, I&rsquo;m against it.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t my native language.</p>
<p>I speak nuance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t speak this internet shit.</p>
<p>And the more I have to communicate through internet shit,</p>
<p>right, I almost never take a tweet seriously</p>
<p>if it contains the letters LMAO, LOL, RTFOL, you know, FOL.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting effect where people say stuff</p>
<p>and then finish with LOL.</p>
<p>You put it beautifully that it indicates to me</p>
<p>that this is a person,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about like why I wear this stupid suit,</p>
<p>is like this is anti, this is to fight the LOL</p>
<p>at the end of sentences, is take,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like stand up for the words you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t finish stuff with LOL,</p>
<p>removing completely the responsibility of the content</p>
<p>of the sentence that preceded it.</p>
<p>Yeah, also choosing the outfit that works both</p>
<p>for Men in Black and the Blues Brothers,</p>
<p>not a terrible choice.</p>
<p>Okay, but getting back, look, Lex,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not in a position to do this.</p>
<p>You need to be seated in a different chair.</p>
<p>Your chair is the wrong chair.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the wrong chair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been so long.</p>
<p>All right, I want to talk about you and Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Joe Biden was a 29 year old guy</p>
<p>with nothing particular going on so far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Okay, I know people as impressive at age 29 as Joe Biden,</p>
<p>12 rows back, 3D, doesn&rsquo;t matter, huge number of people.</p>
<p>None of them my age can get to where he got to.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re all morons.</p>
<p>Anytime somebody takes out,</p>
<p>like if you found Eddie Van Halen in a guitar shop,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be angry.</p>
<p>What is this guy doing repairing guitars?</p>
<p>Then somebody will say, maybe he loves to repair guitars.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, what is your piano,</p>
<p>Russian piano tuner doing?</p>
<p>What is my Russian piano?</p>
<p>That was the whole point of that story,</p>
<p>which is what is it that happened in that life</p>
<p>that converted somebody?</p>
<p>And I find this, for example, with Russian doctors</p>
<p>who are technicians in offices now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge amount of talent in the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not sitting in its proper seat.</p>
<p>And quite honestly, I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point</p>
<p>where my feeling is we&rsquo;ve got to take the seats.</p>
<p>And maybe we don&rsquo;t sit in them.</p>
<p>Maybe the idea is that we take the seats</p>
<p>and we put some smart Gen Z person in the seat</p>
<p>and say, look, no chanting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna hear you say, no justice, no peace.</p>
<p>If there aren&rsquo;t verbs, if it rhymes, it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Like I used to have this thing,</p>
<p>if it rhymed things that rhymed wrong,</p>
<p>if it rhymed things that rhyme are more true.</p>
<p>But like in general, if something starts out</p>
<p>one, two, three, four,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna hear what the rest of your sentences.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I feel like the responsibility that you carry,</p>
<p>that I carry, this is where Joe Rogan</p>
<p>generally removes himself from being,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a comedian.</p>
<p>This idea of I&rsquo;m just a comedian.</p>
<p>We all do that.</p>
<p>But at this moment in history,</p>
<p>like history literally can pivot</p>
<p>on the words of a tattooed,</p>
<p>ripped 50 year old comedian.</p>
<p>And I think the same is true with you.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I&rsquo;m interested and I care.</p>
<p>Speaking of lyrics,</p>
<p>there are many here among us</p>
<p>who feel that life has been a joke.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not us.</p>
<p>The hour is getting late.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not us.</p>
<p>In the song, the joker and the thief</p>
<p>are on opposite sides of Jesus</p>
<p>having this conversation over Jesus.</p>
<p>You and I, we&rsquo;ve been through that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not our fate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s fate</p>
<p>to throw spitballs at the internet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not your fate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an earnest guy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re filled with love.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting the most amazing podcasts.</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re broadcasting.</p>
<p>But you can win over the internet.</p>
<p>This is the point I&rsquo;m trying to make</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re saying I&rsquo;m just a grandpa.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get the internet.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m telling you, you&rsquo;re gonna get bigger</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re gonna get cut down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna keep ascending for a while, Lex.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re saying, and naturally there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, I watch the same process.</p>
<p>People get up to a certain level.</p>
<p>And one of the things that&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>in my opinion, with Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>is that when Joe Rogan starts to talk</p>
<p>about his misgivings about Joe Biden,</p>
<p>in a way that you find at any bar in America,</p>
<p>about cognitive decline in a 77 year old</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s about to be 78, I believe in November,</p>
<p>we have never had anything remotely as insane</p>
<p>as a 78 year old person slated to win the White House.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying when that idea is being communicated,</p>
<p>is there something about the disc concept</p>
<p>that you talk about, the system naturally starts to&hellip;</p>
<p>Some bad thing happens to Joe</p>
<p>or one of Joe&rsquo;s close associates.</p>
<p>The ability to destroy people who become inconvenient</p>
<p>has been documented.</p>
<p>This is what we have done in the past.</p>
<p>Whether we are doing it now, we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>because we are not doing this church committee too.</p>
<p>In order to know whether or not</p>
<p>you are currently destroying American citizens</p>
<p>as we did in the past and as we have documented,</p>
<p>as we found out in 1976,</p>
<p>the federal government destroyed Americans</p>
<p>who had political beliefs</p>
<p>that the government didn&rsquo;t want to continue.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know whether you are grasping that.</p>
<p>One interpretation of why Jon Stewart</p>
<p>and why Joe Rogan and why Bill Maher,</p>
<p>all these people to some extent hide behind, it&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re trying to find a protected class.</p>
<p>Is there some place I can stand and speak the truth</p>
<p>which does not result in my being garbage collected?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>My intuition is you can stand, as you gain more power,</p>
<p>you can stand behind your words.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fight over Joe Rogan right now.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve talked about it for a few years now.</p>
<p>People did not understand how big that program was.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t understand long form podcasting.</p>
<p>I was derided by people who I think of as being very shrewd</p>
<p>for believing in these podcasts as a major force.</p>
<p>And most of the people who derided me have said,</p>
<p>wow, did I not get things?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you started to propose,</p>
<p>you wanted to do the Sopranos</p>
<p>in the era of 30 minute sitcoms.</p>
<p>Like, you don&rsquo;t get it, man.</p>
<p>The American people, they&rsquo;re not interested</p>
<p>in these long plot storylines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your weird thing?</p>
<p>Nobody cares, dude.</p>
<p>Everybody just wants short, fast, memorable.</p>
<p>And like, okay, so if you do that,</p>
<p>you totally miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>And the savvy people used to say,</p>
<p>kid, let me tell you, nobody ever lost a dime</p>
<p>underestimating the intelligence of the American people.</p>
<p>Well, that was totally wrong</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t calculate opportunity costs.</p>
<p>I have been talking about the problem of Joe for a long time.</p>
<p>The problem is, is that when the system wakes up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna wanna control it.</p>
<p>And they come up with new different mechanisms</p>
<p>of doing that.</p>
<p>I guess one interesting one is cancel culture.</p>
<p>Well, look at the number of people around Joe</p>
<p>who they&rsquo;ve come after since they realized</p>
<p>that Joe was really big.</p>
<p>Joey Diaz, Brian Callan, Chris Delia.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that those are all related,</p>
<p>but I do notice that there are at least correlations</p>
<p>between when Joe says something</p>
<p>when something bad happens in Joe&rsquo;s universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier for me to believe that that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s happening around Joe himself.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m worried about my friend.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t necessarily wanna push him</p>
<p>towards being more if he doesn&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t wanna conscript people.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a great life.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a great situation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done a huge service.</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>
<p>How much do I owe Joe just for what he&rsquo;s done for you</p>
<p>to say nothing of what he&rsquo;s done for me</p>
<p>or for Brett or for Sam or any of these people?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to think that we all try to give back,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m worried about Joe.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not worried.</p>
<p>One of the inspiring things about Joe</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s in this war alone.</p>
<p>And the way he fights the war is by just enjoying life.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s his thing, as long as he stays close</p>
<p>to things that he loves and being,</p>
<p>one of the things is he&rsquo;s honest about his drug use.</p>
<p>He loves to hunt.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s just, he does a certain amount</p>
<p>of like semi vice signaling upfront.</p>
<p>And then you just also know him.</p>
<p>This is why every time they try to take him down,</p>
<p>you use the N word.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, everybody knows who Joe is.</p>
<p>And yes, he doesn&rsquo;t act as if he went to a fancy</p>
<p>finishing school, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not his energy.</p>
<p>The fact that you&rsquo;ve got some super smart guy</p>
<p>who always pretends to be a meathead,</p>
<p>just like, hey, I&rsquo;m a comedian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all these defenses and disguises.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;ve got this super smart guy</p>
<p>who he&rsquo;s admitted to most of the things</p>
<p>that you can take him down for.</p>
<p>And because everybody&rsquo;s been effectively in his den</p>
<p>his basement, think about that studio is his basement.</p>
<p>People have hung out with Joe so many hours</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t tell them something about Joe</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re gonna say, wow,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna believe the New York Times</p>
<p>and not the hundreds of hours I&rsquo;ve spent</p>
<p>on the Joe Rogan experience.</p>
<p>But the cool thing is that this is what inspires me</p>
<p>is that the way he&rsquo;s waging war against the system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just by being a good person</p>
<p>and talking enough hours in a week</p>
<p>where that message like bleeds throughout the words</p>
<p>and the gaps between.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so inspiring to me</p>
<p>that the good people can win by just being good.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s kind and he&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>And he also, he&rsquo;s no pushover.</p>
<p>I always worry a little bit when I sit down in my chair.</p>
<p>You still get scared that he&rsquo;ll call you</p>
<p>on some kind of bullshit that you weren&rsquo;t even aware of?</p>
<p>No, the first time I was on the show,</p>
<p>the energy wasn&rsquo;t great between us.</p>
<p>And it was in a sober October situation.</p>
<p>So I think I hadn&rsquo;t understood that</p>
<p>and maybe our egos got a little bit off.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I was having fun,</p>
<p>but maybe it was just too complicated life forms</p>
<p>getting to know each other.</p>
<p>The first one was probably,</p>
<p>yeah, that made me a little nervous for the future.</p>
<p>But then, Joe and I have become friends,</p>
<p>although sometimes we have miscommunications</p>
<p>like on Yom Kippur, I texted him and I said,</p>
<p>Joe, I want to apologize for ways I&rsquo;ve let you down</p>
<p>as a friend that haven&rsquo;t been there for you</p>
<p>and appreciate everything you&rsquo;ve done for me all this time.</p>
<p>Like I get this text back like,</p>
<p>what the fuck is your problem?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re great, dude.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what bad place you&rsquo;re in, but cheer up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, Joe, don&rsquo;t you have any Jews in your life</p>
<p>that apologize for what they&rsquo;ve done?</p>
<p>He was just like, dude, have you lost your mind?</p>
<p>What the hell&rsquo;s gotten into you?</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you think about the Spotify thing?</p>
<p>What about it?</p>
<p>Ask me a question.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now, as opposed to being just a comedian</p>
<p>with the podcast, he now is just a comedian</p>
<p>with the podcast who stepped like in the middle</p>
<p>of the center of cancel culture,</p>
<p>which is like, I know Spotify is in Sweden,</p>
<p>but they represent Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>They represent the very kind of structures.</p>
<p>They contain and represent the kind of structures</p>
<p>that threatened to destroy the Elans of the world.</p>
<p>And he just like stepped like with his Alex Jones</p>
<p>and his Joey Diaz just strolled right into the middle of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>But do you think he&rsquo;s strong enough to, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t even know the right way to ask this,</p>
<p>but is he strong enough to persevere?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when a lion decides, wow,</p>
<p>that honey badger looks tasty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna swallow it whole, see what happens.</p>
<p>Because I talked to him offline.</p>
<p>He really seems to be willing to give away the 100 million,</p>
<p>which gives him so much power.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a powerful thing to be able to say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, yeah, to the honey badger.</p>
<p>He just strolls in, but he&rsquo;s willing to walk away</p>
<p>from anything in this world.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s gonna walk out the other side of the lion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gonna go out the way he came in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you know what it is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Tommy Lee Jones entering the bug.</p>
<p>This is like a giant alien, he just walks into it?</p>
<p>He just, he gets swallowed by the bug</p>
<p>and he blasts out from the inside.</p>
<p>I have it as Tommy Lee Jones.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s Joe Rogan to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, is that my feeling is that Spotify</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t understand what they&rsquo;re messing with.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>Because Joe doesn&rsquo;t need anything, man.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the weird thing about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m sure that he loves all his toys,</p>
<p>whatever, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a rich guy.</p>
<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s got a few money.</p>
<p>He had a few money a long time ago.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not, you know, the other thing about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit weird being friends with a dude like that.</p>
<p>It just is.</p>
<p>Cause like you call him up or he&rsquo;ll call you up</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s going on in your life?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Kind of depressed, trying to get some math done.</p>
<p>What are you up?</p>
<p>Oh dude, I can cheer you up.</p>
<p>I just came off of a 29,000 person stadium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh cool.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you do that?</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just announced it on Instagram a few days ago</p>
<p>and it filled up.</p>
<p>Just like, oh damn.</p>
<p>I mean, that thing is so powerful.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
<p>I mean, you could be that too.</p>
<p>The instant Joe takes an interest in politics</p>
<p>and saving the world.</p>
<p>You might destroy all of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going bye bye.</p>
<p>I promise you.</p>
<p>I just disagree with you.</p>
<p>I mean, cause you have to do it.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve said this many times before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet you, I&rsquo;ll bet you a bottle of Stoli</p>
<p>that you can get, if you get Joe Rogan</p>
<p>to get highly politically active</p>
<p>and call out the system for all the bullshit that it is</p>
<p>in a very pointed and determined fashion</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t get destroyed, I&rsquo;ll give you the vodka.</p>
<p>The vodka?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That sounds like a pretty damn good deal.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve said this, I mean.</p>
<p>No living heroes, my friend, no living heroes.</p>
<p>I just.</p>
<p>No living heroes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just difficult.</p>
<p>You just have to be good at it.</p>
<p>I mean, if you just say generic political things.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be taken down.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re. The more heroic you are,</p>
<p>the more beautiful you are,</p>
<p>the more you will be made to suffer.</p>
<p>If they cannot get you on reputation.</p>
<p>If Jesus himself came down.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I ever read.</p>
<p>I probably have never read to you the hit piece</p>
<p>I did on Jesus.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know about this?</p>
<p>No, I did not know.</p>
<p>I did hit pieces on all of the best people in the world.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So whoever it was who cured cancer,</p>
<p>discovered new particles or whatever it is,</p>
<p>I did a hit piece against them to prove</p>
<p>that I can do it to anybody around anything at any time.</p>
<p>Except Eddie Van Halen is what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Well, Eddie Van Halen is now dead.</p>
<p>But if this was a situation, you know, hot for teacher,</p>
<p>canceled.</p>
<p>Disrespectful.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Also, you know, packaging female objectification</p>
<p>for young men.</p>
<p>Clearly Eddie Van Halen is one of the worst people alive.</p>
<p>But the skill, the incredible inspiration</p>
<p>that is just radiating from his music</p>
<p>inspires so many millions</p>
<p>that they will fight those canceled pieces.</p>
<p>This is your thing.</p>
<p>You have this idea that there&rsquo;s a war between good and evil</p>
<p>and the good has already been designated the winner.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>But your belief that it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Fake it till you make it, no?</p>
<p>I mean, you gotta, it&rsquo;s motivating both of us.</p>
<p>Like I also believe that we&rsquo;re gonna win</p>
<p>because if I don&rsquo;t, then I can&rsquo;t get out of bed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pretty heavy at the moment.</p>
<p>Do you think 2021 can make us feel good</p>
<p>about the trajectory of society?</p>
<p>So like where we emerge from this year feeling good.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a smile on Eric Weinstein&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>and the next time we talk,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be doing some kind of duet on guitar</p>
<p>and not having this worried look on our faces.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, but you&rsquo;ve also promised</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to somehow end this in a positive.</p>
<p>Okay, so how do you turn the no around?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the U turn from the no?</p>
<p>Until we get some actually decent people</p>
<p>in the right chairs who are not constantly thinking</p>
<p>about their next paycheck, I don&rsquo;t see a solution.</p>
<p>Let me just say what the prerequisites for a solution are</p>
<p>and to let you know why I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>First of all, both of these political parties,</p>
<p>the leadership of them is disgusting and has to go.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re tearing us apart.</p>
<p>They lack the will to be Americans.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand the subtlety of the project.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re simply the people who figured out</p>
<p>how to inhabit the seats and that is their great achievement.</p>
<p>I believe that in order to solve this,</p>
<p>you need people who can integrate,</p>
<p>who are not partisan at the level</p>
<p>of the partisan warriors that we&rsquo;re seeing,</p>
<p>people who believe in dividing the pies of the future</p>
<p>rather than the present pie as our main task as Americans</p>
<p>because we are built around growth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say it.</p>
<p>You need an ability to have subtle conversations</p>
<p>and you need the ability to exclude.</p>
<p>And at the moment, everyone knows inclusion is good,</p>
<p>which it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying, well, water is good.</p>
<p>If I say water is good, everybody will agree with me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, people drown.</p>
<p>People need to get dehydrated.</p>
<p>It can be life saving or life ending.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t good or bad.</p>
<p>Inclusion is not good or bad.</p>
<p>Inclusion is just inclusion.</p>
<p>Exclusion is part of inclusion.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve taught people that they can reason through the world</p>
<p>as sub cocker spaniels.</p>
<p>They just bark things at each other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for safety.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for inclusion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for growth.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Do you guys use verbs, dependent clauses?</p>
<p>Are there compound complex sentences?</p>
<p>Where are we in this sea of nonsense?</p>
<p>You have to be able to build a place</p>
<p>where you have smart, talented people</p>
<p>who represent a diverse group of correct opinions.</p>
<p>You need to get rid of almost all of the people</p>
<p>who have opinions that are antithetical</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>You need to give them insulation, which we&rsquo;re terrified</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t trust anybody.</p>
<p>So everything has to be transparent.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to the bathroom,</p>
<p>I want those walls to be plexiglass</p>
<p>so I can see what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s too much transparency.</p>
<p>We have too much and not enough at the same time.</p>
<p>And then in essence, you need to ensure</p>
<p>that people aren&rsquo;t worried about feeding their family</p>
<p>every four seconds for being real.</p>
<p>None of that is happening.</p>
<p>And our billionaires, our billionaires are pathetic.</p>
<p>What is the point of billionaires</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not going to do billionaire type cool stuff</p>
<p>like saying, F you, and I&rsquo;m going to throw $3 billion</p>
<p>at the project of restoring the national conversation?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t grasp this.</p>
<p>What is the point of creating obscene wealth</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t have anyone smart enough</p>
<p>and caring enough to use it?</p>
<p>So I agree with that last part for sure.</p>
<p>Let me slightly push back on the idea</p>
<p>that the leaders themselves are broken.</p>
<p>I feel like this goes to the Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>Joe Biden and Trump having a debate on that program.</p>
<p>I feel like Joe Biden has a lot of really interesting ideas</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s almost forgot how to communicate.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been fake for so long within the system.</p>
<p>Hillary was fake for too long.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure she had real ideas at the beginning</p>
<p>that she still was campaigning on decades later.</p>
<p>But if the system, if the platforms empowered you</p>
<p>to search, to be honest, to be real,</p>
<p>to search for those ideas within yourself,</p>
<p>like long form conversations do,</p>
<p>then even the Donald Trump and Joe Biden leaders</p>
<p>we have now would take this country to a better place</p>
<p>that would unite people.</p>
<p>So like, we can keep the current Congress.</p>
<p>We just need to create better platforms.</p>
<p>This is going to the intuition</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s good in Donald Trump.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s depth and complexity and intelligence.</p>
<p>And the same with Joe Biden.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good in Joe Biden.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, we&rsquo;re not incentivizing.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s several things I think are broken.</p>
<p>One of them is Twitter.</p>
<p>The other is journalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the platforms of us communicating with each other.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I try to come up</p>
<p>with unifying explanations is that,</p>
<p>if you look at the number of wildfires in California,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, that we&rsquo;ve just seen,</p>
<p>if you treat them all as spontaneous,</p>
<p>uncorrelated instances, it feels like,</p>
<p>oh my God, it&rsquo;s just whack a mole.</p>
<p>Every time I send a fire truck here,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fire over there.</p>
<p>So you want to come up with something</p>
<p>like a central theory, which is,</p>
<p>why do I suddenly have a problem</p>
<p>when I hadn&rsquo;t had a problem before?</p>
<p>So I look for these unifying explanations.</p>
<p>And I found one the other day that really speaks to me.</p>
<p>I mean, people are very frustrated</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been trained to think about this</p>
<p>incorrectly, in my opinion.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the graph that you need to look at.</p>
<p>On the x axis is time by year.</p>
<p>And on the y axis is something like average age of a human.</p>
<p>The title of the graph is any desirable situation</p>
<p>involving institutions.</p>
<p>So that could be CEO, it could be tenured professor.</p>
<p>It could be who&rsquo;s getting grants.</p>
<p>It could be the age at which people win Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p>University presidents, all these things go up.</p>
<p>In other words, for a long period of time,</p>
<p>the average age of the person in a desirable situation</p>
<p>has been increasing something like nine months for every 12.</p>
<p>Those graphs have to go down at some point.</p>
<p>The specter of having five people all born in the 1940s</p>
<p>as the final entrance in the presidential context,</p>
<p>that makes no sense.</p>
<p>Think about how bizarre a thing</p>
<p>that nobody&rsquo;s even really talking about.</p>
<p>The last five people were all ancient</p>
<p>by presidential standards.</p>
<p>Not one, not two, but five.</p>
<p>We are talking about a contest between somebody</p>
<p>who is the oldest of the baby boomers,</p>
<p>the very beginning of the baby boom,</p>
<p>summer of 46th birthday, fighting somebody</p>
<p>who is in the silent generation.</p>
<p>The silent generation guy in a town hall in Florida</p>
<p>gets this question from a Gen Z guy saying,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with my future?</p>
<p>Joe Biden has the audacity to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a transitional president.</p>
<p>You guys are the highly educated one.</p>
<p>When has any generation in history needed</p>
<p>a transitional 78 year old person to take office?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bizarre, it&rsquo;s preposterous.</p>
<p>That graph is the graph we can&rsquo;t talk about.</p>
<p>That graph is the graph of our destruction.</p>
<p>Because it has the, you can make a one line argument,</p>
<p>which sounds like ageism, which isn&rsquo;t a very good argument.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But what it does is, is it muddles the conversation.</p>
<p>And you always have to ask yourself the question,</p>
<p>if this conversation becomes muddled,</p>
<p>who wins as a result of the muddling?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a battle, but let&rsquo;s just win it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s win the battle.</p>
<p>You give.</p>
<p>Are you running?</p>
<p>For sure, I&rsquo;ll run.</p>
<p>I was born in Russia, can&rsquo;t run.</p>
<p>So, but we Russians can hack elections,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>
<p>This is me officially announcing my run for president.</p>
<p>I was born in St. Petersburg, Florida.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Lex, what is it that you really wanna ask?</p>
<p>I think, I wanna put some responsibility on the portal.</p>
<p>The portal.</p>
<p>That the portal gives power to the people in that graph.</p>
<p>Like, cause you put it quite brilliantly</p>
<p>that the people that move the world,</p>
<p>their age has been going up.</p>
<p>And not move the world, but put in the position</p>
<p>where they get the chance to affect the world.</p>
<p>These new platforms, I think Twitter falls in them,</p>
<p>give power to the younger people.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be about age necessarily,</p>
<p>but the younger thinking people.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a promising thing.</p>
<p>And you are like, you&rsquo;re like Gandalf.</p>
<p>You get to pick your Frodo&rsquo;s or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very good with the analogy,</p>
<p>but the whole point is for you as Gandalf.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I make that much sense.</p>
<p>Gandalf makes sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people know how to fit me</p>
<p>into this ecosystem.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something in my presentation</p>
<p>that people find very confusing.</p>
<p>No, figure it out.</p>
<p>I disagree with you, but you need to look at the mirror</p>
<p>and think like, what is it?</p>
<p>Is it, maybe you need a mustache.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about figuring out</p>
<p>how to be a charismatic communicator in this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the responsibility.</p>
<p>You said like finishing sentences with the LOL</p>
<p>is painful for your soul.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s just how somebody lets me know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to take their opinion seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s still the language,</p>
<p>the way that people are communicating</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re swimming that wave.</p>
<p>You have a big platform.</p>
<p>I have a growing platform.</p>
<p>It feels like this is the place to give power.</p>
<p>I agree, but we&rsquo;re gonna get swatted down.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>Why are you afraid of the big?</p>
<p>Like this is, I&rsquo;ve studied it.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve studied, let me ask you a question, Lex.</p>
<p>I believe that every society is supposed to have</p>
<p>a collection of what I call break glass</p>
<p>in case of emergency people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>These are people who are universally loved</p>
<p>and trusted by your society.</p>
<p>For example, David Attenborough,</p>
<p>the great British naturalist and presenter,</p>
<p>recently came on Instagram.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s worried about the planet.</p>
<p>And I said, look, there are very few of these people left.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pay attention, find out what he has to say.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s gonna be an ass.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s gonna be in it.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s gonna say wrong things, don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Tell me about your top 10 universal American heroes.</p>
<p>This is not a rhetorical question.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Give me five.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody looks to that person and says,</p>
<p>yep, the best of us.</p>
<p>Probably follow that person.</p>
<p>Well, everybody&rsquo;s an interesting concept.</p>
<p>I mean, Elon Musk is very divisive, right?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m talking about overwhelmingly people</p>
<p>would follow that person if that person gave a rousing,</p>
<p>intelligent speech that said, we must act now</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re in dire straits.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people fall in that category.</p>
<p>For me, it would be in the tech world,</p>
<p>in the engineering world.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Tell me his names.</p>
<p>Elon Musk.</p>
<p>The Rock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking like, who is the most eloquent actor?</p>
<p>So like, you think celebrities, so people with platforms.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say celebrities, but you have to be well known.</p>
<p>I believe like, yeah, so this goes to Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>First two did not really impress me</p>
<p>as being what I said, but okay.</p>
<p>Elon several years ago would have.</p>
<p>Can you try to?</p>
<p>Joe Rogan has.</p>
<p>Why do they fail?</p>
<p>Why does Elon fail?</p>
<p>Lots of people treat Joe Rogan</p>
<p>as if he&rsquo;s some sort of right wing racist</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve never watched his program.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know who his friends are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Oh, but when I thought you said everybody,</p>
<p>I thought you meant a large enough people</p>
<p>where a huge change can happen,</p>
<p>not actually literally everybody.</p>
<p>Because I think.</p>
<p>I mean people who&rsquo;ve pulled off,</p>
<p>like people who&rsquo;ve pulled off something</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s convinced that that person just deeply.</p>
<p>I mean, I think I&rsquo;ve told you this story before,</p>
<p>but the one time I&rsquo;ve seen the power of a figure like this,</p>
<p>I mean, very few times I&rsquo;ve been in a large crowd</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen people just moved</p>
<p>where they would do almost anything good,</p>
<p>bad and different because they were primed.</p>
<p>One was a Rolling Stones concert.</p>
<p>The other one was Nelson Mandela coming to Boston.</p>
<p>And man, you&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this.</p>
<p>You check out the photos from the banks</p>
<p>of the Charles River when Nelson Mandela came.</p>
<p>There are people that you need in your dark hours</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t agree on who they are.</p>
<p>And as soon as they emerge, we tar them with shit.</p>
<p>We get out the shit branch.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just disagree with you.</p>
<p>So I think.</p>
<p>What do we disagree about here?</p>
<p>I think it doesn&rsquo;t matter who it is.</p>
<p>I think really good speeches are needed.</p>
<p>And I think a lot.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s gonna give them?</p>
<p>I saw Killer Mike try to give a good speech.</p>
<p>Yeah, he did.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, he did.</p>
<p>That was something.</p>
<p>Very impressed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Even Killer Mike immediately gets into this.</p>
<p>Sell out.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he didn&rsquo;t take up the responsibility.</p>
<p>I would say.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Of going bigger.</p>
<p>So he was speaking to the community.</p>
<p>And he was doing what he.</p>
<p>On this particular moment, he&rsquo;s exceptional at it.</p>
<p>And he was speaking to this particular moment.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t take it a step farther,</p>
<p>which is like giving the same speech,</p>
<p>but bigger than race.</p>
<p>Bigger than this particular moment,</p>
<p>but more about the American project.</p>
<p>You know the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good example.</p>
<p>So that guy until we screw him up</p>
<p>is the kind of thing that I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, Jaco, maybe that&rsquo;s another.</p>
<p>Jaco&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t really tell.</p>
<p>Is he a Democrat?</p>
<p>Is he a Republican?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an American.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for damn sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of folks.</p>
<p>And then, you know.</p>
<p>No, I think Jaco, there aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why Jaco&rsquo;s so special.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so important.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Your podcast, The Portal, is something in my little universe</p>
<p>is something a lot of people really love.</p>
<p>And it moves them.</p>
<p>They draw a lot of meaning from it.</p>
<p>And also, especially in difficult times.</p>
<p>It gives them a comfort of through like this kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just nuance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, even when you&rsquo;re talking about chaos,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s love underneath all of it.</p>
<p>And I think people would draw a lot of meaning from it,</p>
<p>which is why they are wondering why you haven&rsquo;t been doing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering why you haven&rsquo;t been doing that many podcasts</p>
<p>or you haven&rsquo;t done it in maybe a month and a half</p>
<p>or two months in this most difficult of times.</p>
<p>Is there a good reason?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There are lots of good reasons.</p>
<p>So the first one is kind of weird,</p>
<p>which is everybody assumes that everyone wants to be famous.</p>
<p>And if you say, I don&rsquo;t want to be famous,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, you&rsquo;re just saying that</p>
<p>because you want to be everyone to think you&rsquo;re famous.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not that famous.</p>
<p>You know, okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love being as well known as I&rsquo;ve become.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of things that are fun about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful that you can go to,</p>
<p>I can go to any city in the world</p>
<p>and there are portal listeners there.</p>
<p>All I need to do is put out a tweet</p>
<p>and 20 people show up for a drink.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re amazing people.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re almost, I mean, you can see my live Q and A&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on my Instagram page.</p>
<p>If you go to Eric R. Weinstein,</p>
<p>I just pick somebody randomly</p>
<p>and I was really worried about it at first.</p>
<p>And you know, maybe I should be worried about it,</p>
<p>but in general, people all over the world</p>
<p>are just so positive.</p>
<p>And so, you know.</p>
<p>And thoughtful and have a story that&rsquo;s kind of self selected.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t like the fame.</p>
<p>The thing we just described comes with the fame.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re worried that it&rsquo;s getting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ephemeral.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll, look Lex, it&rsquo;ll turn on you in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll turn on you in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>And the other problem is I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like my audience being my audience.</p>
<p>I want to get closer to them.</p>
<p>I want to talk to them.</p>
<p>I want to find out what is this doing in your life?</p>
<p>My house fills up with art that people send me.</p>
<p>The lightest thing is an effects pedal</p>
<p>called something like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>bow tie overdrive from a guy in Mexico, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You play electric, by the way, in a tiny little tangent.</p>
<p>Do you play electric?</p>
<p>I have a Stratocaster, but it doesn&rsquo;t have a strap</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it and I have a bad amp.</p>
<p>So you should, you should, you should hook me up with the.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find it a home maybe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to sense that this is too much.</p>
<p>No, I want to be, I want to be here.</p>
<p>I want to do the work very simply.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an ability to fully explain myself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to claim that I don&rsquo;t love the fact that how</p>
<p>much love do we get from these programs?</p>
<p>Like I, the generically people are incredibly generous.</p>
<p>You know, people have begged me, set up a Patreon account</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t been able to do it.</p>
<p>I should do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said to everybody, it&rsquo;s a business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a business, but like they&rsquo;re so used to being defrauded.</p>
<p>When somebody starts thinking about monetary incentives, my,</p>
<p>my goal was to say, I&rsquo;m going to keep talking to you about you.</p>
<p>You wonder why I started doing ads on my show was because I</p>
<p>wanted people to think from the get go, this is a business.</p>
<p>This is what I sound like when I&rsquo;m selling, but you know, like</p>
<p>you see I&rsquo;ve lost weight.</p>
<p>A lot of that is due to athletic greens, athletic greens, you</p>
<p>know, um, code, uh, what&rsquo;s the, I don&rsquo;t know what my promo code</p>
<p>is for athletic greens, probably athletic greens.com slash portal,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t that portal, but you know, Fitbit who doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>advertise has also been instrumental as well as a guy</p>
<p>named Steven Cates, who, you know, was a fan from the show,</p>
<p>found me on the street and just said, I&rsquo;m a trainer.</p>
<p>I want to help train you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got me on a, on a good, uh, good path.</p>
<p>So, you know, that&rsquo;s one paid advertiser and two people on</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling out just because there are, you know, two, two</p>
<p>outfits, Steven Cates and Fitbit that have changed my life.</p>
<p>I wanted people to say, you know, you don&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>afraid of advertising.</p>
<p>If I do it in this way, this is powering your show, but the</p>
<p>whole issue of money is weird because people have these crazy</p>
<p>feelings like, Oh wow.</p>
<p>I knew he was a shill.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a grifter, you know?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t love that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t love the issue.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t set up a Patreon.</p>
<p>The security issues for talking and being me are significant.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have the kind of money to hire around the clock.</p>
<p>I mean, I, I desperately want to get to a level of wealth</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t have to think about money.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s, you know, some people want money because</p>
<p>they, they, they need it for status.</p>
<p>I think I can handle status if I want it doing this, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want the status necessarily.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want, I&rsquo;d want the status, but I don&rsquo;t want the</p>
<p>fame that goes with it.</p>
<p>I want the money.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be seen as this is about money because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about a substance and drink, you know, all of those things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of, I haven&rsquo;t solved these issues.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling bad because people say, where&rsquo;s the portal</p>
<p>work?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re desperate.</p>
<p>These are difficult times.</p>
<p>We have an election coming up and it&rsquo;s just like, do you</p>
<p>think for a moment that I want to explain that I actually got</p>
<p>really uncomfortable being as well known as I was?</p>
<p>And then what is it that I want?</p>
<p>Because I want to be better known and less well known at</p>
<p>the same time.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s nothing the audience can do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the audience to be the audience.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense to people.</p>
<p>I want it to be a business, but I don&rsquo;t think people need to</p>
<p>fear a business of the businesses open about being a</p>
<p>business that, and then that&rsquo;s all to the side, what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing now in front of the election is an incredibly</p>
<p>meta violent period in our online existence, and I believe</p>
<p>that anybody who attempts to say these two parties are</p>
<p>completely screwed at the moment.</p>
<p>The leadership of these parties is unsalvageable, unworkable.</p>
<p>Everyone hears that from inside the two party system.</p>
<p>Oh, I get it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to subtract votes off of Biden.</p>
<p>Oh, I get it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to scuttle Trump.</p>
<p>Oh, I get it.</p>
<p>This is a play for his show because he&rsquo;s trying to plug</p>
<p>in to discuss there&rsquo;s a bill Hicks routine on marketing.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen this brilliant?</p>
<p>I recommend it to everyone where he comes out on stage and</p>
<p>he says, are there any people in marketing and sales in the</p>
<p>audience?</p>
<p>Woo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, great.</p>
<p>Can you do us all a favor and die?</p>
<p>And like, everybody laughs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, I&rsquo;m not laughing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing being serious.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s talked about how marketing is horrible.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like, where&rsquo;s this act going?</p>
<p>Then he gets to the point of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, I know how you marketing people think bills</p>
<p>going after that, uh, resentment dollar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good dollar.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get that resentment anti marketing dollar.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I really hate marketers.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the authenticity dollar.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t escape this kind of negative marketing thought.</p>
<p>And I guess that gets to the issue that I don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>destroyed in advance of this election. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good use of my relationship to my audience to be broadcasting</p>
<p>how completely ridiculous Donald Trump and Joe Biden are as</p>
<p>candidates for the president of the United States.</p>
<p>Full stop.</p>
<p>None of this makes any sense.</p>
<p>These moderators of these pseudo debates were in the wrong</p>
<p>format with the wrong people.</p>
<p>No part of this makes a wit of sense.</p>
<p>Can I try to push back several claims?</p>
<p>One is I don&rsquo;t believe the systems as they stand now can</p>
<p>destroy their equine voice, the voice you&rsquo;re a child.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say that, but, well, let me, well, it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>possible. It&rsquo;s entirely possible that you&rsquo;re the child.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because a child would say you would call other people a child.</p>
<p>Yeah. Get in the first blow reveal the tell because the only</p>
<p>power they have is to attack you psychologically.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, I believe that the army of people that love you is much</p>
<p>more powerful than mainstream media, than people that you</p>
<p>might hear it say ridiculous things that you just said,</p>
<p>which has tried to reduce you, like the marketing thinking.</p>
<p>I just believe there&rsquo;s an army.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a better term of people that see you for who</p>
<p>you are and a hungry, like I&rsquo;m not disputing those things.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m saying, I would venture to say as your therapist</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re actually, uh, the battle is all in your mind.</p>
<p>All in your mind that you have found these demons in the</p>
<p>system, and they&rsquo;re just a tiny minority and it&rsquo;s all in your</p>
<p>mind. They cannot actually remove.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not strong enough to remove the voice of Eric Weinstein</p>
<p>to silence the voice.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>This is some of the best fiction writing I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, I have relatives who&rsquo;ve known me my entire</p>
<p>life, where one article in the New York Times, they will</p>
<p>believe that over me.</p>
<p>My contention is that it has no power except to affect your</p>
<p>psychology. What you have to do is the Rogan thing, which is</p>
<p>laugh. Just laugh.</p>
<p>I am laughing.</p>
<p>I know, but more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you something.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The way this works is through ruin.</p>
<p>Ruin can come to anyone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one who cannot be ruined.</p>
<p>Every single person is signed up right now to be ruined by</p>
<p>the system.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you understand that you have more power than the system?</p>
<p>You can ruin the system.</p>
<p>Your Twitter account, the podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you about the Army.</p>
<p>I agree that my Twitter account, my pocket.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;ve seen, for example, you saw what happened</p>
<p>to Brett&rsquo;s Articles of Unity project.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What happened on the Twitter side?</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Well, actually, say the word and say the word.</p>
<p>It was blocked or removed from Twitter.</p>
<p>Suspended.</p>
<p>Account suspended.</p>
<p>And I have a direct line to Jack.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m talking to the CEO who I am crazy enough to still</p>
<p>believe in.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I do, too.</p>
<p>I believe somehow there&rsquo;s a very strange thing going on</p>
<p>with Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>I cannot possibly reconcile the actions with the person I&rsquo;ve&hellip;</p>
<p>That is a next level mind in there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know it well enough to say that it&rsquo;s all next level.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not claiming he doesn&rsquo;t have any blind spots.</p>
<p>Every smart person I know has blind spots.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s up against.</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that the Jack Dorsey that I&rsquo;ve talked to and</p>
<p>the Jack Dorsey that interacted over Articles of Unity can be</p>
<p>the same person.</p>
<p>He is constrained by that company in some way that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>Either that or he&rsquo;s the most duplicitous person on earth and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not believing it.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Something horrible is happening.</p>
<p>My claim is I can remove you functionally from the chessboard</p>
<p>in a tiny number of moves, no matter who you are, no matter</p>
<p>how virtuous or how much of a bastard you&rsquo;ve been your entire</p>
<p>life, it doesn&rsquo;t take more than three or four moves to</p>
<p>basically neuter you as a force.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I disagree that if that&rsquo;s possible, that means I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>very good at chess.</p>
<p>Like Unity 2020 was removed from Twitter because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>good enough, not within the system.</p>
<p>Like the army of people that feel the brilliance of the idea</p>
<p>was too small.</p>
<p>Okay, but fear, uncertainty and doubt is the name of the</p>
<p>game, the coin of the realm.</p>
<p>Psychology though, it&rsquo;s not real power.</p>
<p>It just affects the mind.</p>
<p>Okay, I have a reading assignment for you because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Russian, you&rsquo;ll really enjoy this.</p>
<p>As part of the great American tobacco settlement, the Tobacco</p>
<p>Institute had to disgorge its archives of all of its</p>
<p>strategies, all of its skullduggery and put it on the</p>
<p>web for all time so that we can all understand how the tobacco</p>
<p>companies got together and destroyed people, right?</p>
<p>You see tobacco destroys people.</p>
<p>You can see, you know, Scientology destroys people.</p>
<p>There are various vindictive organizations that will not</p>
<p>tolerate reality in opposition to them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take them down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you is&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, no.</p>
<p>So why aren&rsquo;t you doing the podcast to return?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s one of the weapons of war.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, if you&rsquo;re at war, I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>discuss strategy on a podcast, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s your misunderstanding.</p>
<p>What did Montgomery say about Rommel?</p>
<p>But wasn&rsquo;t his line, I read your book, you beautiful bastard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why are you using the tactics that you</p>
<p>already explained?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So one of the things I&rsquo;m doing is I&rsquo;m not having a strategic</p>
<p>conversation with you and several hundred thousand of</p>
<p>our closest friends.</p>
<p>I pulled back because this is not the battle that I know</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I do not feel passionately enough about defeating Donald</p>
<p>Trump to elect Joe Biden, even if that&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to ultimately vote, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in the Biden Democratic Party.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in the Trump Republican Party.</p>
<p>So, yes, it&rsquo;s an incredibly consequential election.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s like the Crips and the Bloods and the Latin</p>
<p>Kings fighting over the right to extort a business and the</p>
<p>business trying to figure out who it wants to do the extorting.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think, listen, there&rsquo;s very few people that</p>
<p>are as good with the English language as you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s possible to draw a line in between that</p>
<p>finds how we find our common humanity that ensures a better</p>
<p>2021 without having to say like Donald Trump is evil or Joe</p>
<p>Biden is incompetent or any of that, just somehow draw a</p>
<p>beautiful line?</p>
<p>I am seeing people in so much pain.</p>
<p>This election is chewing up the integrity of everyone who</p>
<p>comments on it, Lex.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re not good enough.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not good enough.</p>
<p>No, but the hope is&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you believe in me?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Listen to me very carefully.</p>
<p>My spider sense, my intuition that has allowed me to survive</p>
<p>in the space, I&rsquo;ve been mouthing off since the 80s, tells me</p>
<p>this is a super dangerous time for smart people to be spending</p>
<p>the dry powder because the election doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t have a sense that one outcome would</p>
<p>be better than the other probably, but the variance on</p>
<p>that, I&rsquo;m not even positive that I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>These two options are so completely inappropriate to the</p>
<p>world of 2020.</p>
<p>What we need is so diametrically opposed to more boomers and</p>
<p>more silent generation people trying to sort out a highly</p>
<p>technical world being mediated through social media.</p>
<p>We need more exclusion.</p>
<p>We need more actual elites.</p>
<p>The people we&rsquo;ve called the elites are not the elite.</p>
<p>They need to go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We need excellence, competence.</p>
<p>We need people who can be trusted behind closed doors and we need</p>
<p>to close the doors so we can&rsquo;t see what those people are doing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Imagine that you had a bunch of people who&rsquo;d all seen action</p>
<p>in combat, had all volunteered to be part of the armed services,</p>
<p>had all come from backgrounds where they didn&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>So you were convinced that these people had put their lives on</p>
<p>the line for their country, not for a payday.</p>
<p>Imagine you had 10 of these people with technical backgrounds,</p>
<p>men, women, black, white, Muslim, Jew, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I would trust those people and I&rsquo;d close the door.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to know what they talked about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want transparency into all of their negotiations.</p>
<p>I want to know that they&rsquo;re patriotic, that they see something in the world</p>
<p>bigger than themselves and their family fortunes.</p>
<p>I want to know that they&rsquo;re courageous.</p>
<p>I want to know that they&rsquo;ve got all of our well being and I&rsquo;m willing</p>
<p>to roll the dice.</p>
<p>And if they screw us over, I&rsquo;d rather go down like that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I disagree with you there because there&rsquo;s a difference in those</p>
<p>and Jocko because you&rsquo;re not speaking to people with credentials.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m talking about self credentialed people.</p>
<p>I view Jocko as self credentialed.</p>
<p>But the biggest, the powerful thing about Jocko is he&rsquo;s not only self credentialed,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s been real with people.</p>
<p>The magical thing about Jocko isn&rsquo;t his book, isn&rsquo;t his life story is he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>talking on a podcast for a long, there&rsquo;s something real that happens.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So if you took everybody, if you took Dan Crenshaw and Tulsi Gabbard and you took</p>
<p>Jocko Willing and maybe Jesse Ventura, right, you can take, you can take Bernie</p>
<p>Sanders.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s, you know, a lone voice.</p>
<p>You take all of these people who&rsquo;ve like really just risked, like why do we trust?</p>
<p>Why is Katherine Hepburn the best that Hollywood ever produced?</p>
<p>Because she told Hollywood to go fuck itself hard.</p>
<p>They gave her four Academy awards and she said, love you, sweeties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use them as the doorstop for the bathrooms in my house.</p>
<p>See that skill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, uh, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s what you were talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Be Katherine Hepburn.</p>
<p>Audrey Hepburn is pretty amazing, but Katherine Hepburn is next level.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well, you, I mean, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re trying to say to me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure it out, Lex.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the answer yet.</p>
<p>What I do know is that this election is chewing people up and I mean two separate things.</p>
<p>One that parties don&rsquo;t have enough integrity that if you comment either for or against,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a short sequence where you make a comment that&rsquo;s nuanced.</p>
<p>You get referenced to something, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, take this thing about, you know, find people on both sides.</p>
<p>That is non resolved after N years, whether the context should be reported or not.</p>
<p>We are in some situation in which Democrats and Republicans are primed to fight each other.</p>
<p>The way introducing two ants from two different ant colonies always produces a battle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be in that fray because those people are going to kill each other mindlessly</p>
<p>like robots.</p>
<p>And until the election is concluded, like I, do I think this is dire?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Could it be make or break?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that.</p>
<p>Do I know which way this goes?</p>
<p>I can make an excellent argument that we need to elect Joe Biden right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a situation which can only be cured by voting for Joe Biden.</p>
<p>I can make another argument that we could have a situation that can only be cured by</p>
<p>defeating Joe Biden right now.</p>
<p>And all of the things that the modern democratic party represents.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not the lady and the tiger we&rsquo;re choosing between</p>
<p>the tiger and the tiger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Sumatran tiger versus the Siberian tiger, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think, well, which tiger can I, do I have a better chance against, um,</p>
<p>the key problem for us politically is that we have to divorce the concept of the center</p>
<p>and moderation from kleptocracy.</p>
<p>Every time we try to say something like we need more moderate solutions, we need more</p>
<p>pluralistic solution.</p>
<p>People will say, wow, you just want to hand us right back into the swamp, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>The swamp people cause the moderates and the swamp people are the same people, right?</p>
<p>So then we have these two crazy wings.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have crazy right wing people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want any Tiki torch BS.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have crazy left wing.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t attack my courthouse.</p>
<p>Really don&rsquo;t attack my courthouse and we can&rsquo;t have moderates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, how do we install our children and, and rape pillage and get these speaking</p>
<p>fees when we&rsquo;re out of office and become, you know, cozy with the things when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to be regulating them and then, you know, become their lobbyists, you know, immediately</p>
<p>when we leave office, all of this stuff, we need an entirely different system.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t talk about that at the moment.</p>
<p>When I talk, people say, oh wow, so you&rsquo;re going to sit this one out cause you&rsquo;re a pussy</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a coward.</p>
<p>Great to know Eric.</p>
<p>We thought better of you by click.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>But are you thinking of what to do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, you better believe it.</p>
<p>Look, Brett, Brett had this idea of unity 2020 and I told him it was a wrong idea.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t tell him that unity 2024 was a wrong idea.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t tell him that unity 2028 is a wrong idea.</p>
<p>And if I were to make the case that he was right and I was wrong, cause he&rsquo;s now shuttered</p>
<p>the thing, right?</p>
<p>I would say that the case to be made that he was correct was, is that by doing this</p>
<p>in 2020, we found out what we were up against.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to know that Twitter can turn this off at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>Great to know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to know as we learned that you cannot have meetings of vice of presidential candidates</p>
<p>in a primary that are not approved of by the party, right?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ve got this thing figured out so we don&rsquo;t have any way in.</p>
<p>And now unity 2024 makes sense because unity 2020 was tried.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that we get to 2024 under all circumstances and some we do and some we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a game theoretic thing that I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;re accounting for, but you,</p>
<p>you probably are.</p>
<p>But let me just make an argument is Jack Dorsey very likely listens to your podcasts and wait,</p>
<p>this is the power of these words.</p>
<p>Something deep went wrong, but we can change it with the power of words.</p>
<p>Something went wrong at Twitter.</p>
<p>They have so much division on their platform.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve gotten, it&rsquo;s not wrong.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re understaffed.</p>
<p>No, they have an insoluble problem.</p>
<p>Difficult to solve.</p>
<p>They have an insoluble problem.</p>
<p>This is where you and I disagree because, well, all right, I&rsquo;d like to create a competitor.</p>
<p>So then, you know, give it to me, create the competitor, show me that you actually have</p>
<p>understood this because my guess is, is that most of the things that you&rsquo;ll think about,</p>
<p>I mean, I can tell you things I&rsquo;ve talked to Jack about, which I know would make Twitter</p>
<p>much better.</p>
<p>However, I, I think that this problem of instantaneous communication across the planet and you subtract</p>
<p>off all sorts of context and mutual self knowledge, the problem is us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the platforms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re thinking about a technological solution and I&rsquo;m saying the problem is, is that we</p>
<p>are ultimately the product.</p>
<p>And I just disagree with that and there&rsquo;s a lot of, that&rsquo;s probably could save that</p>
<p>for tomorrow.</p>
<p>I look forward to spending summers in your villa when you, when you debut this product</p>
<p>and I would love to angel invest in it.</p>
<p>By the way, in terms of money, I&rsquo;ll never have a villa.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I will always give away everything I own.</p>
<p>No, sorry.</p>
<p>Invest into like things like you mentioned, awesome things.</p>
<p>Invest fine, but a little bit of a vuncular advice.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t pledge to be the person who disgorges themselves of security.</p>
<p>Money is freedom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big hunking pile of freedom.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You can choose to use it as the freedom to imprison you if you don&rsquo;t, you know, so you</p>
<p>can use it as freedom to make yourself a prisoner of your money.</p>
<p>But generally speaking, Lex money is freedom and your voice is important.</p>
<p>At least retain the amount of money security you need to follow Joe&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>What is the point of f you money if you don&rsquo;t say f you, the number of people who have f</p>
<p>you money who don&rsquo;t say f you indicates the number of people who chose the freedom of</p>
<p>their wealth to create a prison.</p>
<p>They built a prison with the freedom they had and they walked into it, locked the door.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s too difficult not to create it.</p>
<p>The reason I want to give away the money is because I just know my own psychology and</p>
<p>you create prisons.</p>
<p>Our human mind just creates those prisons that f you money is enough for basic shelter</p>
<p>and basic food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the optimal if you don&rsquo;t have kids yet.</p>
<p>This is a, okay, this is the problem.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m sitting.</p>
<p>So this is me, single Lex speaking, but future Lex, future Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to future Lex, single, single present Lex, please don&rsquo;t listen.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be an ass.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to need some money and don&rsquo;t make these pledges to say on a podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying I want to save you from yourself.</p>
<p>You need money to do many of the beautiful things that we&rsquo;re counting on you to do.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t F it up.</p>
<p>Can I talk to you about Roger Penrose?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked to Roger on the portal, but also in between the lines and offline, just</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;ve said about Roger Penrose for people who don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He just recently, a few days ago, won the 2020 shared the 2020 Nobel prize for physics,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s clear to me that he had like a deep personal impact on you, a connection with</p>
<p>you in terms of both your love of mathematics, just the way you see the world.</p>
<p>This is the Eddie Van Halen conversation.</p>
<p>This was clearly somebody who&rsquo;s profound in your worldview.</p>
<p>Can you talk about Roger?</p>
<p>Can you talk about what it means that he won this highest of prizes just in general?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s celebrate the man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So first of all, there are two other people who won this prize.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t happen to know who they were before they won.</p>
<p>Roger is a very, it is not Roger in particular, but the class from which Roger comes that</p>
<p>is so important.</p>
<p>So I would put Roger in the class of Feynman, Einstein, Dirac, Yang, um, put Whitten in</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>I mean, Whitten is a special case, but Whitten is weirdly the reverse of the Roger Penrose</p>
<p>story, right?</p>
<p>Because Whitten is the first physicist to win a mathematical Fields Medal, the highest</p>
<p>honor in mathematics.</p>
<p>Penrose is in some sense, a mathematician who&rsquo;s now won the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a perfect sort of a couplet.</p>
<p>Roger&rsquo;s class means everything to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the highest achievement of the human mind.</p>
<p>I would probably throw Bach in with Feynman and Dirac and company, right?</p>
<p>I think that he was so inventive.</p>
<p>It was very frustrating to watch this career.</p>
<p>It was a little bit frustrating to watch Feynman&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>Feynman was so good and had he been born slightly different and a slightly different time, I</p>
<p>believe his claim on physics would be far greater.</p>
<p>I feel like Penrose in some sense came up a very difficult path because you see Einstein</p>
<p>effectively solved most of the most important problems in general relativity right at the</p>
<p>beginning.</p>
<p>As a result, the children of Einstein are impoverished because there wasn&rsquo;t as much</p>
<p>to pick off of the trees and sell at the market.</p>
<p>Whereas Bohr and Planck didn&rsquo;t do nearly as good of a job with quantum theory.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots to do in quantum theory.</p>
<p>I think that Roger affected me personally by a diagram that I saw in a paper of Herman</p>
<p>Gluck at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It was the first picture I&rsquo;d ever seen of the Hopf vibration sketched and that weirdly</p>
<p>I brought that to the Rogan program in order to sort of convey the wonder.</p>
<p>It was recapitulating my own journey.</p>
<p>I think I probably saw that at like age 16 or something and it just flipped my mind.</p>
<p>Roger is incredibly visual, he&rsquo;s incredibly geometric, he&rsquo;s incredibly sui generis, he</p>
<p>just does his own thing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got lots of bets.</p>
<p>None of them had really come through the way you would hope and I think they stretched</p>
<p>the rules to be blunt about it.</p>
<p>To give him the prize.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>You said this thing on Twitter which is beautiful that every once in a while comes a human being</p>
<p>that gives value to the prize versus the prize giving value to the human.</p>
<p>Two different kinds of prizes.</p>
<p>The reason that we care about the Nobel Prize isn&rsquo;t because of Alfred Nobel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it came along at the right time to reward Einstein, Dirac, Schrodinger, Feynman.</p>
<p>Most of the people who should have won, won.</p>
<p>Most of the awards are not good in the sense that they don&rsquo;t really follow.</p>
<p>The prize is used to rewrite history, that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>You should have a love hate relationship with it because on the one hand it does focus the</p>
<p>world on what really matters and on the other hand it distorts what really matters and both</p>
<p>of those functions take place simultaneously.</p>
<p>In this case, I think that they violated their own rules slightly so it wasn&rsquo;t really clearly</p>
<p>a case of a prediction and a discovery in the typical fashion.</p>
<p>We better give this award to somebody of that highest caliber to make sure that the prize</p>
<p>is fully funded with prestige going forward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of my weird speculative guess as to what happened.</p>
<p>So Roger&rsquo;s getting on in years and the person should be alive so I think they bent the rules</p>
<p>and I think they couldn&rsquo;t have bent it for a better person and I hope they will not bend</p>
<p>the rules out of weakness but out of strength in the future.</p>
<p>It would be great to get Madame Wu and Emmy Nerder a posthumous prize along with Doug</p>
<p>Prasher, George Sudarshan and George Zweig as well as Ernst Stuckelberg Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p>There have been some terrible omissions, the first two being females who revolutionized</p>
<p>our view of the world and I take a very dim view of people pushing for prizes for people</p>
<p>from ethnic groups or genders or whatever in order to make it plural and inclusive.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not following the work and I feel very clear that in a few cases we know there</p>
<p>was a real problem with the Nobel committee because we have stunning accomplishments and</p>
<p>try to get through a day as a physicist with that Nerder&rsquo;s theorem and try to imagine the</p>
<p>universe without Madame Wu&rsquo;s discovery that left and right don&rsquo;t appear to be symmetric.</p>
<p>I mean these are terrible omissions and they&rsquo;re a huge blot on science for not being more</p>
<p>inclusive when it matters.</p>
<p>Yeah so just like you said the Nobel Prize is plagued by omissions as much as&hellip;</p>
<p>And distortions and dilutions.</p>
<p>For example, Dirac and Schrodinger were I believe given the prize in the same year.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason that those two people needed to dilute each other.</p>
<p>The same thing with you know Dyson was an omission, Tominaga probably got included in</p>
<p>part because we had an opportunity to show that something had happened on both sides</p>
<p>of the Pacific after the war.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think we needed to dilute Weinberg or Feynman or Schwinger.</p>
<p>It makes me somewhat sick.</p>
<p>All of these people are such important giants and it has to do with the field I think not</p>
<p>wanting to create luminaries and superstars who could have defended the field from budget</p>
<p>cuts and worldly pressures.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s really important that we have absolute superstars because we produce superstars.</p>
<p>We acknowledge them, we don&rsquo;t dilute them and that we bend the rules to make sure that</p>
<p>the prize stays funded with the prestige that comes from giving it to the Roger Penrose&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>Albert Einstein&rsquo;s and Paul Dirac&rsquo;s of the world.</p>
<p>Can we talk a little bit about evil?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually talked to you about this topic and it&rsquo;s been sitting on my mind mostly</p>
<p>because everybody at MIT is quiet about it, which is Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to experience what MIT was like at the time when Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>was part of this, but I&rsquo;d love to try to understand how evil was allowed to flourish in a place</p>
<p>that I love.</p>
<p>Whether you think, maybe let me ask the question this way.</p>
<p>Was it the man evil or was the system evil or is evil too strong a word?</p>
<p>Because what I see is the presence of this particular human being in the eyes of many</p>
<p>destroyed the reputations of many really strong scientists and also weakened the ability,</p>
<p>like weakened the institution of MIT by making everybody quiet, like almost making them unable</p>
<p>to say anything interesting or difficult.</p>
<p>And what is that and what am I supposed to?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Why is everyone quiet about Jeff?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Obviously I want to scream about it too, right?</p>
<p>And I probably have said too much about Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>Look, something horrible happened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but something horrible happened.</p>
<p>And you know, at the one thing that, okay, let&rsquo;s just do this.</p>
<p>The first thing I need to do is I need to get rid of this woke crap about power differentials.</p>
<p>In general, you can talk about hypergamy and power differentials are Russell conjugates</p>
<p>of the same concept, just the way particular proportions and symmetries are mathematically</p>
<p>provable to be attractive in females to males.</p>
<p>Male attractiveness is largely determined by male competence and ability to amass power</p>
<p>and success and all these sorts of things.</p>
<p>The relationship between consenting adults is quite frankly not something I want to sort</p>
<p>out the relationship between the sexuality of adults and minors.</p>
<p>And particularly, you know, there&rsquo;s the 17, 18 issue that&rsquo;s very different than 12, 13.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about really sick depravity with respect to what it appears that Jeffrey</p>
<p>Epstein was involved in at some level.</p>
<p>I believe this story is super complicated in part because I think one thing Jeffrey</p>
<p>Epstein was doing was providing money, encouragement, and support to scientists.</p>
<p>Another thing he was doing, I believe, was giving tax advice to very rich people.</p>
<p>I believe another thing he was doing was hooking very wealthy people up with young adult females.</p>
<p>Another thing he was doing, I think, was doing stuff with children that will curl your toes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an entire spectrum of different stuff.</p>
<p>And at the moment, nobody can pull apart or deconflate anything because the woke thing</p>
<p>comes over it and says, I think it&rsquo;s disgusting that a 43 year old billionaire would be partying</p>
<p>with a 23 year old.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to adjudicate that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about 12 and 14 year olds that we&rsquo;re not talking about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think MIT was deep into pedophilia.</p>
<p>My guess is that that did not happen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the scientists were the targets of the really sick depraved stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my guess.</p>
<p>My guess is that what you&rsquo;re looking at was a government construct.</p>
<p>It may have been our government, it may have been a joint government project, maybe somebody</p>
<p>else&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I believe that in part, we don&rsquo;t really understand Robert Maxwell.</p>
<p>Sorry, who&rsquo;s Robert Maxwell?</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell&rsquo;s father was very active in scientific publishing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where peer review came from.</p>
<p>I would love to run down the relationship between peer review and Robert Maxwell.</p>
<p>I would love to run down the missing fortune of Robert Maxwell and the mysterious fortune</p>
<p>of Jeffrey Epstein because I don&rsquo;t think Jeffrey Epstein ever ran a hedge fund.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he was a money advisor the way people claimed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two things I want to talk about.</p>
<p>One is the shallow conversations of woke identity politics that you&rsquo;re referring to seems to</p>
<p>be removing everyone&rsquo;s ability, no, everyone&rsquo;s willingness to talk about like, what the hell</p>
<p>is this person and how is he allowed?</p>
<p>Most importantly, how do we prevent it in the future?</p>
<p>From the individual perspective, the question for me is the same question I ask about 1930s</p>
<p>Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading way too much probably or not enough about that period currently.</p>
<p>If I was in Germany at that time, what is the heroic action to take?</p>
<p>When I think about MIT with Jeffrey Epstein, what is the heroic action to take?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about virtue signaling action.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>I would not know what you&rsquo;re up against, Lex.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not hearing me.</p>
<p>The problem here is what was Jeffrey Epstein?</p>
<p>Well, that question might be the heroic action to take.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to get my first question.</p>
<p>You have to map the silence with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re describing is a map of the silence at MIT.</p>
<p>Well, is there a map of the silence in Washington state around Jeffrey Epstein, the Bay Area,</p>
<p>New York City?</p>
<p>The amount of silence around Jeffrey Epstein should be telling you everything.</p>
<p>The number of dogs that don&rsquo;t bark is like nothing we&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exactly correct, but I want to know what is it telling us?</p>
<p>Because what it&rsquo;s telling me is not some kind of conspiracy, but more a disappointing weakness.</p>
<p>Not some kind of conspiracy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not some kind of conspiracy, but&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so afraid of saying the word conspiracy that you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a conspiracy?</p>
<p>I personally, I just think it&rsquo;s people who I thought were my heroes just being weak.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Be of good cheer, sir.</p>
<p>A cheer?</p>
<p>Be of good cheer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You think that there&rsquo;s a conspiracy?</p>
<p>I think there is a conspiracy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a very impressive one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the scale of it.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that large scale can only be an emergent phenomena.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I find this so fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I always see you as like a logic and love drive your soul.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very logical.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re relentless.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a lot of love in your heart.</p>
<p>I believe that if you would review the video, where is it from?</p>
<p>Dubai or Abu Dhabi of the mysterious hit on the hotel guest?</p>
<p>You ever seen this thing?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the assassination in 2010, 10 years ago, of Mahmoud Al Mabou, something like that,</p>
<p>in Dubai where I believe 26 separate individuals on multiple teams are shown converging coming</p>
<p>in from all over the world on false passports, pretending to be tennis players or business</p>
<p>people or vacationers.</p>
<p>All of these teams have different functions and they murder this guy in his hotel room.</p>
<p>The Dubai, I guess, chief of police or security officer was so angered that he put together</p>
<p>this amazing video that says, we can completely detail what you did.</p>
<p>We caught you on closed circuit TV.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly who you are because your disguises and your false passports, but</p>
<p>yeah, 26 people converged to kill one.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t believe you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe after COINTELPRO and Operation Paperclip and Operation Mockingbird.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether I should even bring up Rex 84.</p>
<p>To not believe in conspiracies is an idiocy.</p>
<p>So you have a sense that evil can be as competent or more competent.</p>
<p>First of all, when evil wants to operate at scale, it needs to make sure that people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>try to figure out evil.</p>
<p>When evil operates at scale, from first principles, you have to realize that evil must not want</p>
<p>it investigated.</p>
<p>The most efficient way to keep yourself from being investigated, if you are an evil institutional</p>
<p>player who needs to do this repeatedly, is to invest in a world in which no one can afford</p>
<p>to say the word conspiracy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that there is a special radioactivity around the word conspiracy.</p>
<p>We have provable conspiracies.</p>
<p>We have admitted to conspiracies.</p>
<p>You have been invited to conspiracy.</p>
<p>There is no shortage.</p>
<p>Conspiracies are everywhere.</p>
<p>Some of them are mundane.</p>
<p>Some of them are like price fixing cartels, or trade groups, or generally speaking, conspiracies.</p>
<p>So the first thing you have to realize is that all of us are in a memetic complex where</p>
<p>you can be taken off the chessboard by saying, conspiracy theorists, get done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a one line proof.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to listen to Lex.</p>
<p>He said he was a conspiracy theorist on this show.</p>
<p>That is partially distorting our conversation.</p>
<p>If you want to ask me about Jeffrey Epstein, you have to agree with me that that is a logical</p>
<p>description of what you would have to have if you wanted to commit conspiracies is that</p>
<p>you have to make sure that people are dissuaded from investigating this.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a fascinatingly difficult idea then because the world with conspiracy theories</p>
<p>and the world without conspiracy theories to the shallow glance looks the same.</p>
<p>Well, my point.</p>
<p>There is responsible conspiracy theorize where you look at the history of unearthed conspiracies</p>
<p>and just like you would with any other topic, just think about how different the rules in</p>
<p>your mind are for conspiracy theorizing versus X theorizing where X can be anything, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if I say to you, um, I can say the statement that average weight is not the same</p>
<p>between widely separated populations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d say, yeah, I&rsquo;d say average height is not the same between widely separated populations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d say, yeah.</p>
<p>Then I say, in fact, no continuous variable that has that shows variation should be expected</p>
<p>to be identical between widely separate.</p>
<p>Of course they&rsquo;re like IQ, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, right?</p>
<p>So we have a violent reaction to specific topics.</p>
<p>So the first thing I want to do is just to notice that conspiracy has that built into</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really important to state.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s very interesting that, and as a prerequisite, as you&rsquo;re saying, that</p>
<p>would be the first step.</p>
<p>If you wanted to pull off a conspiracy in a competent way, that&rsquo;s, you would have to</p>
<p>first convince the world.</p>
<p>I just watched the film 1971 about my favorite conspiracy of all time, I highly recommend</p>
<p>it 1971 well, the film is entitled 1971 and it&rsquo;s about the citizens committee to investigate</p>
<p>the FBI, which was a run by a student of Murray Gelman, a physicist and broke into FBI offices</p>
<p>in Pennsylvania to steal files, which allowed freedom of information requests that discovered</p>
<p>a huge conspiracy.</p>
<p>It was a conspiracy that unearthed a conspiracy inside the federal government, a double conspiracy</p>
<p>story, which launched multiple conspiracies.</p>
<p>I think that the problem with modern Americans is that they are so timid that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even learn about the history of conspiracies that we have absolutely proven.</p>
<p>So with that done, Jeff Epstein, in my opinion, represented somebody&rsquo;s construction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that scary to think about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, what part of the story isn&rsquo;t scary?</p>
<p>I in part did something which I imagine may get me destroyed because I was more worried</p>
<p>about being destroyed by somebody else I had a conversation with around Jeff Epstein, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just trying to like get, let it be known that I don&rsquo;t know anything more than</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already said.</p>
<p>Now, your friends at MIT, their problem is that Jeff Epstein showed up as the only person</p>
<p>capable of continuing US scientific tradition.</p>
<p>You see, the US scientific tradition is a little bit like the Russian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s combative, okay?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re a free society and we act like a free society.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a rich society and we research like we&rsquo;re a rich society.</p>
<p>That is historically, and then came the 1970s and William Proxmire and the Golden Fleece</p>
<p>Awards and the idea that we have to, we&rsquo;re paying too much and these are welfare queens</p>
<p>and lab coats and blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>We need more transparency, more oversight.</p>
<p>Everything went to hell and the national culture of US science was lost.</p>
<p>The thing that produced all this prosperity and security and power was lost.</p>
<p>And then Jeff Epstein shows up and a tiny number of funders, maybe Fred Kavli, maybe</p>
<p>Yuri Milner, maybe who else would be in this category?</p>
<p>Peter Thiel to an extent, Howard Hughes would be the largest of these things, which has</p>
<p>different grant structures than the NIH, gave people a modicum of risk taking ability.</p>
<p>Okay, well, when Jeff Epstein showed up, everybody wanted to take risk in science.</p>
<p>And suddenly a charismatic billionaire says, hey, I can make that work for you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s $100,000, go research something crazy.</p>
<p>Well, that money was supposed to be provided by the federal government under the terms</p>
<p>of the endless frontier compact between the federal government and the universities and</p>
<p>the federal government and the taxpayers Welch.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one place to lay the blame for Jeff Epstein as at the failure of the federal government</p>
<p>to honor its commitment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So the universities became psychopathic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like everybody doesn&rsquo;t remember what we&rsquo;re supposed to be doing to be moral, but</p>
<p>the point was there wasn&rsquo;t enough money to be moral.</p>
<p>So it was time to, uh, to eye each other as a source of protein, as I like to say.</p>
<p>And in that process, Jeffrey Epstein said, Hey, come to my world.</p>
<p>We can do it like we used to do.</p>
<p>So in part, my point is, is that almost none of your colleagues at MIT have that kind of</p>
<p>religious commitment to science that they&rsquo;re willing to go down with ship science.</p>
<p>The Galileo Galilei thing became very important to science because occasionally you just have</p>
<p>to say, look, this isn&rsquo;t about me and you, there isn&rsquo;t enough money in the world to buy</p>
<p>the kind of legacy I want to leave to this planet.</p>
<p>This is one of the great things about science, you know, potentially it&rsquo;s worth dying for</p>
<p>yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you said it.</p>
<p>Science is one of the things that is best that&rsquo;s worth dying for.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not eager to martyr myself, but I&rsquo;ve certainly risked my health, my fortune,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve destroyed myself economically over science and, um, and my, my, my, my need</p>
<p>to oppose these sons of bitches in chaired professorships who are destroying our system</p>
<p>along with everyone else.</p>
<p>Let me, um, bring in grandmaster into this.</p>
<p>Oogway, master Oogway.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a grandmaster.</p>
<p>That would make him a chess playing turtle.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve read some wikipedia and she was a master.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s apparently only one grandmaster and that&rsquo;s anyway, is the phrase grandmaster ever</p>
<p>uttered in the script?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a story.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s off off script cannon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to call Glenn burger right now and find out if any of this is true.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to call up my journalistic integrity, um, but master Oogway, master Oogway</p>
<p>he says a couple of things I&rsquo;d like to bring up with you.</p>
<p>So one as part of a longer quote recommends, uh, that you should, uh, find a battle worth</p>
<p>fighting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about several battles just now.</p>
<p>What is the battle worth fighting for, for Eric Weinstein in the next few months, in</p>
<p>the next year?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one, well, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the Moses, it&rsquo;s the Moses thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to leave.</p>
<p>This place is over to get off the planet.</p>
<p>I, yeah, I, I, I freak people out when I say that, but like, look at your world.</p>
<p>You just got introduced to the problem of a virus.</p>
<p>Wait, wait till it&rsquo;s fusion devices and you understand what it means to have one interconnected</p>
<p>planet with no uncorrelated experiments happening anywhere else.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>So do you see the foray, your work in physics and maybe like the echoes of it in a ship</p>
<p>Elon?</p>
<p>Everybody who has a possible plan to avoid what is coming if we don&rsquo;t have one should</p>
<p>work on the plan that he, she thinks best, right?</p>
<p>So Elon wants to do rockets.</p>
<p>People misinterpret me.</p>
<p>I meta Eric says, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a smart plan.</p>
<p>Regular Eric says all people who have hope should do that thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s Mars, man, at least it&rsquo;s the moon and Mars and maybe Titan and whatever.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll work and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense and it looks silly, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly the kind of fight worth fighting.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the kind of fits for the same reason that I went on Brett&rsquo;s unity, 2020</p>
<p>thing when I didn&rsquo;t think it had a hope in hell and people are, you know, are making</p>
<p>fun of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we got to do things that make, that make us feel dumb and silly and childish</p>
<p>that it possibly have a hope of working.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So everybody should do something.</p>
<p>My version of this, I am the most hopeful about because I wouldn&rsquo;t have chosen to do</p>
<p>if I thought that Daniel Schmack did burgers wisdom project was a better hope.</p>
<p>I do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more down to earth in a certain way.</p>
<p>I just think that it&rsquo;s more probable.</p>
<p>Look, we got from a powered flight with the Wright brothers and wind tunnels to sending</p>
<p>back images from the surface of Titan via Huygens Cassini in less than a century.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what we can do if we can change the laws of physics is something we can&rsquo;t even conceive</p>
<p>of.</p>
<p>It may be that it buys us nothing and at least we&rsquo;ll, we will know why we died on this planet</p>
<p>as a small aside.</p>
<p>I think this is not the right time to take the full journey, but I feel like you&rsquo;ll guide</p>
<p>me like master way did.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m the Kung Fu Panda.</p>
<p>They only have one conversation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on our, like, we didn&rsquo;t, we didn&rsquo;t, well, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re Jews and they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So we talked too much, but the guide doesn&rsquo;t have to be with words.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think Poe was Jewish?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s debatable.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to go back to the Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Is there, um, that you would guide me through some more intuition about the source code,</p>
<p>the source code of our universe.</p>
<p>Can you comment on where, since we last spoke, where your thinking has been, has roamed around</p>
<p>geometric unity around that work in physics in this fight?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out when to release it and how, I mean, I&rsquo;ve released the video and</p>
<p>the video, quite honestly, I think it has a very bizarre reaction.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that I&rsquo;ve learned from the video, cause the video is coming</p>
<p>up on half a million views on YouTube alone to say nothing of the, um, the audio, but</p>
<p>yeah, it produced a very strange reaction.</p>
<p>One of the things I don&rsquo;t think that I properly understood is that most physicists don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>in this geometric language.</p>
<p>I thought that more of the physics world probably had converted over into manifolds, bundles,</p>
<p>differential forms, connections, curvature, tensors, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I, I saw a lot of the comments would say things like, I have a PhD in theoretical physics</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not even familiar with all of these concepts.</p>
<p>And I think that was probably a distortion coming from living in Cambridge, Massachusetts</p>
<p>for almost 20 years.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the solution to that?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I can make this make as much sense as anybody needs to.</p>
<p>My problem is my calculation is that as long as the boomers are still in charge, the same</p>
<p>people have these perverse incentives on them where they&rsquo;ve invested in these programs that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re extremely hostile and kind of difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>The fact that I&rsquo;m not a physicist, um, has its own set of issues, which is that effectively</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the hermit kingdom.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get any visitors and they don&rsquo;t necessarily want somebody, you know, rolling</p>
<p>up and saying, I know how to do physics.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m always very clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a physicist.</p>
<p>That said, if I wait too long, I don&rsquo;t know that theoretical physics is really going to</p>
<p>exist after the boomers because everyone in you, I think you had Wolfram on your program.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember whether he said this to you or Brian Keating, but he said something like</p>
<p>everybody got discouraged.</p>
<p>It was too hard.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Guys.</p>
<p>We cannot do that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the renormalization revolution that innervated the physics community</p>
<p>because it taught them just because you can see in this energy regime doesn&rsquo;t mean you</p>
<p>can extrapolate somewhere else unless you understand how, you know, coupling constants</p>
<p>run and what kind of a UV fixed points exist, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Somehow that discouraged people from guessing from believing everything became an effective</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>The beauty of the effective theory wasn&rsquo;t taken to be really the beauty of the universe,</p>
<p>just the beauty of an energy level.</p>
<p>So I think that renormalization was one of the most important revolutions that ever happened</p>
<p>in science.</p>
<p>And also its interpretation by the physics community was catastrophic.</p>
<p>Well, the story I&rsquo;m telling myself is that in part I&rsquo;m waiting for them to get weaker.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I don&rsquo;t know that we have any time left.</p>
<p>And so are you also thinking about ways of, uh, you know, you know, the, the podcast medium</p>
<p>is revolutionary for public for discourse for what, I mean, I don&rsquo;t even know the right</p>
<p>words for it.</p>
<p>Are you thinking of revolutionary ideas for re energizing the physics community?</p>
<p>So basically for communicating, look, I have a fantasy, okay?</p>
<p>My fantasy is that all of these things are the same problem.</p>
<p>And it goes back to this thing that I read about in, in Fineman&rsquo;s, um, books about Tartaglia.</p>
<p>They asked him this question, like, what&rsquo;s the greatest thing that ever happened in math?</p>
<p>And he says, Tartaglia is solution of the cubic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the weirdest answer.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like, okay, I&rsquo;ll bite.</p>
<p>Why is it Tartaglia solution of the cubic?</p>
<p>And he said, because it was the first time a modern person had done something profound</p>
<p>that the ancients had failed to do.</p>
<p>I was like, Oh, I got it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that opens up new psychology that says maybe things are possible again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new orchard, new orchard, new farmers, new people who can find fruit that they can</p>
<p>pick.</p>
<p>And once you have one person do that, very often you get many, like one of the things</p>
<p>that we were talking about with Eddie Van Halen.</p>
<p>The reason that he created a revolution and somebody like Roy Buchanan did not is that</p>
<p>you could follow Eddie Van Halen.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t pioneer it.</p>
<p>And maybe you couldn&rsquo;t play as well and as cleanly and as fast and as inventively, but</p>
<p>you could follow once you understand that there is a tapping principle.</p>
<p>It was just the beginning of something called percussive guitar.</p>
<p>My belief is that once we start innovating in the present, everything will come because</p>
<p>everything that around us is screwed up on that.</p>
<p>Let me with one last question, bring back master Oogway, the probably the most famous</p>
<p>quote of his, right, with yesterday&rsquo;s history, tomorrow&rsquo;s a mystery, but today is a gift.</p>
<p>That is why it is called the present.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very beautiful.</p>
<p>Although I would have gone with quit, don&rsquo;t quit, noodles, don&rsquo;t noodles.</p>
<p>I feel like people need to know way too much context for that to make sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your audience.</p>
<p>To hell with context.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>
<p>Let me ask, what are you grateful for today?</p>
<p>What is your present?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about a lot of dark things, but what brings you joy to your heart that I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have this?</p>
<p>You know, Nyla and Zev, my wife, Pia, the fact that we&rsquo;ve got our health, all the little</p>
<p>things, saying grace after meals.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re coming over for Friday night Shabbat dinner, so we&rsquo;ll bench together and say grace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to just, like this bottle of water in front of me, I made a point of just</p>
<p>thinking about how wonderful it is that there&rsquo;s a quenching bottle that happens to be placed</p>
<p>in front of me because somebody cared.</p>
<p>That small thing made a difference to me.</p>
<p>I still have strength for the fight so far.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m grateful for.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;m not more beaten down after all of this nonsense.</p>
<p>I have the most interesting set of friends.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that rich by monetary standards, but if there were friend billionaires, Forbes</p>
<p>would be all over my ass.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t believe who I can talk to, you know, at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really grateful.</p>
<p>I think this is the end of something profound, and it&rsquo;s the beginning of whatever is next.</p>
<p>And whatever is next could be terminal.</p>
<p>Whatever is next could be amazing.</p>
<p>Whatever is next could be a return to the horrors of the early 20th century that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>manage to go totally catastrophic, but takes hundreds of millions of lives in the process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful to having half of my life in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>Maybe it took place in a bubble, and maybe it was unsustainable.</p>
<p>But it was nice to be able to move around the world without a mask.</p>
<p>It was nice to be able to see a little bit of the world, even if it was from a cot in</p>
<p>a hostel in some country.</p>
<p>To fall in love.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It was a good life.</p>
<p>Find the last Indian Jewish girl left.</p>
<p>Who knew?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a lucky guy.</p>
<p>Well, let me just say‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s something I wanted to just say before you get to that.</p>
<p>I forgot to say something.</p>
<p>Falling in love with an intellectual collaborator is a special thing that not everybody gets</p>
<p>a chance to do.</p>
<p>I think when I met Pia, I fell deeply in love with her, all her normal characteristics.</p>
<p>Pia and I had an antagonistic relationship around geometry and economics.</p>
<p>And then weirdly, just like in a buddy picture where in the first half of the film they hate</p>
<p>each other, the two fields were fighting with each other, cats and dogs, and finally the</p>
<p>sexual tension clearly was so thick you could cut it with a knife.</p>
<p>And we came up with geometric marginalism, which is this other theory, not geometric</p>
<p>unity, which allowed me to inhabit space with somebody who I already knew intimately and</p>
<p>had fallen in love with, and to see the quality and beauty of their mind and to play and to</p>
<p>dance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of the intellectual version of the tango, one of the most romantic periods</p>
<p>of my life that doesn&rsquo;t fall into most people&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>So that was a chance to see something totally unexpected, haven&rsquo;t really had it since</p>
<p>because she doesn&rsquo;t want to revisit the material, but something I&rsquo;m super grateful for that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very particular and unique.</p>
<p>But to flip the tables on you, for hundreds of thousands, I think millions of people,</p>
<p>I can speak, me and them are really grateful, one, that you exist, and two, sorry, for your</p>
<p>podcast and I do hope your voice in some form continues to reverberate, I think, at least</p>
<p>in the 2021s and beyond, even if it takes a brief pause.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pausing at the moment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recorded some for future episodes and I&rsquo;m recording for you.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>But earnestness trades at a discount at the moment because it&rsquo;s easy to make fun of it.</p>
<p>One of the things I like best about you is that you and I are both fairly earnest.</p>
<p>We may joke and jab, but honestly, there&rsquo;s a project here and a world to win, as they</p>
<p>say.</p>
<p>The thing that I want my and your listeners to know is that I&rsquo;m not stepping away from</p>
<p>the podcast because I don&rsquo;t appreciate that people really want more.</p>
<p>This is hugely financially costly to me.</p>
<p>I want to make sure you guys are getting the best that I can do, and destroying myself</p>
<p>right in front of an election, I think Lex is incorrect.</p>
<p>I think that the forces that are trying to make sure that there aren&rsquo;t any planes in</p>
<p>the sky that aren&rsquo;t either colored red or colored blue is a big danger given how angry</p>
<p>I am at the system.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be removed from the chess board because if nobody&rsquo;s going to talk about</p>
<p>Jeff Epstein, there need to be people.</p>
<p>If nobody&rsquo;s going to talk about various things that we&rsquo;ve talked about on these programs,</p>
<p>I want to make sure that I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p>Do I think that this is potentially an existential election?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Am I positive that I know that my way to bet is the right way out?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, people.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Where we are right now seems so dumb and so catastrophic in terms of how it is chewing</p>
<p>up smart people that I decided it&rsquo;s really not about cowardice because it&rsquo;s hard for</p>
<p>me to restrain myself.</p>
<p>I have so many reactions every day.</p>
<p>This is really about trying to plan for all of our futures to make sure that I&rsquo;m around.</p>
<p>I had a huge concern that what happened to Brett&rsquo;s Articles of Unity was going to happen</p>
<p>to Brett.</p>
<p>It was going to happen to the YouTube channels.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that we don&rsquo;t have all of our eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>So if something goes wrong over there, that&rsquo;s the whole idea of the intellectual dark web,</p>
<p>which is at some level a loose confederation.</p>
<p>It can become a strong confederation if somebody wants to back it and make it work.</p>
<p>It can dissolve so that there really isn&rsquo;t anything.</p>
<p>The thing is to be hard to kill because ultimately, when the hit pieces come, they don&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>for what it is that they&rsquo;re angry at you about.</p>
<p>They come for where they can get you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important that right in front of an election, the desire of the old system</p>
<p>to defend itself through reputational destruction is one of the most pernicious aspects of the</p>
<p>new America.</p>
<p>We have to fight the ability to destroy reputations as a means of institutions keeping individuals</p>
<p>with podcasts and the ability to reach millions through Substack out of their domain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t surrender this domain to them.</p>
<p>They have plenty of weaponry with which to fight us, and I believe that they could remove</p>
<p>you or me in an instant.</p>
<p>By the end of today, if they wanted us off the chessboard, we would be off the chessboard.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s not your perspective.</p>
<p>My goal is to stay here as long as possible to make sure that you have enough of a counterbalancing</p>
<p>set of ideas and to let and help other podcasters start.</p>
<p>My hope is that that works, but long heroism, short martyrdom is a good motto for anyone,</p>
<p>and I try to remember the short martyrdom part of that.</p>
<p>First of all, beautifully put.</p>
<p>Second of all, a way to end the conversation and the disagreement, which is how you hook</p>
<p>them for the next conversation to be continued.</p>
<p>And Lex says ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Eric, it&rsquo;s a huge honor.</p>
<p>Thank you once again.</p>
<p>Lex, really appreciate it every time we get together.</p>
<p>Thanks, buddy.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Eric Weinstein, and thank you to our</p>
<p>sponsors.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Leonard Cohen in the song titled, Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Well, maybe there&rsquo;s a God above, but all I&rsquo;ve ever learned from love was how to shoot</p>
<p>somebody who outdrew you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a cry that you hear at night, it&rsquo;s not somebody who&rsquo;s seen the light,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a cold and it&rsquo;s a broken hallelujah.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
