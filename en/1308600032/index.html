    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Matthew Walker</p>
<p>as our guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Dr. Walker is a professor of neuroscience and psychology</p>
<p>at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p>There, his laboratory studies sleep.</p>
<p>They study why we sleep, what occurs during sleep,</p>
<p>such as dreams and why we dream,</p>
<p>learning during sleep,</p>
<p>as well as the consequences of getting insufficient</p>
<p>or poor quality sleep on waking states.</p>
<p>Dr. Walker is also the author</p>
<p>of the international bestselling book, Why We Sleep.</p>
<p>Our discussion today is an absolutely fascinating one</p>
<p>for anyone that&rsquo;s interested in sleep, learning,</p>
<p>or human performance of any kind.</p>
<p>Dr. Walker teaches us how to get better at sleeping.</p>
<p>He also discusses naps,</p>
<p>whether or not we should or should not nap,</p>
<p>whether or not we can compensate for lost sleep,</p>
<p>and if so, how to best do that.</p>
<p>We discuss behavioral protocols</p>
<p>and interactions with light, temperature,</p>
<p>supplementation, food, exercise, sex,</p>
<p>all the variables that can impact</p>
<p>this incredible state of mind and body that we call sleep.</p>
<p>During my scientific career,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read many papers about sleep</p>
<p>and attended many seminars about sleep.</p>
<p>Yet, my discussion with Dr. Walker today</p>
<p>revealed to me more about sleep, sleep science,</p>
<p>and how to get better at sleeping</p>
<p>than all of those papers and seminars combined.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also delighted to share</p>
<p>that Dr. Walker has started a podcast.</p>
<p>That podcast, entitled The Matt Walker Podcast,</p>
<p>releases its first episode this month</p>
<p>and is going to teach all about sleep</p>
<p>and how to get better at sleeping.</p>
<p>So be sure to check out The Matt Walker Podcast</p>
<p>on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to mention</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates</p>
<p>things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise.</p>
<p>Our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available</p>
<p>through Momentus on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now my discussion with Dr. Matt Walker.</p>
<p>Great to finally meet you in person.</p>
<p>Wonderful to connect.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s been too long,</p>
<p>but I suspect it would have been a shorter time</p>
<p>before we&rsquo;d met, less the pandemic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>No, thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m delighted that we&rsquo;re finally</p>
<p>sitting down face to face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking your work,</p>
<p>both in the internet sphere,</p>
<p>and I read your book and loved it.</p>
<p>And also from the perspective of science.</p>
<p>You actually came to Stanford a couple of years ago</p>
<p>and gave a lecture for BrainMind.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And there, of course, you talked about sleep</p>
<p>and its utility and its challenges</p>
<p>and how to conquer it, so to speak.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start off very basic.</p>
<p>What is sleep?</p>
<p>Sleep is probably the single most effective thing</p>
<p>you can do to reset your brain and body health.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a functional answer in terms of,</p>
<p>you know, what is sleep in terms of its benefits.</p>
<p>Sleep as a process, though,</p>
<p>is an incredibly complex physiological ballet.</p>
<p>And if you were to recognize or see</p>
<p>what happens to your brain and your body</p>
<p>at night during sleep, you would be blown away.</p>
<p>And the paradox is that most of us,</p>
<p>and I would think this too, you know,</p>
<p>if I wasn&rsquo;t a sleep scientist,</p>
<p>we go to bed, we lose consciousness for seven to nine hours,</p>
<p>and then we sort of wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and we generally feel better.</p>
<p>And in some ways, that denies the physiological</p>
<p>and biological beauty of sleep.</p>
<p>So upstairs in your brain,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going through these different stages of sleep,</p>
<p>the changes in brainwave activity</p>
<p>are far more dramatic than those</p>
<p>that we see when we&rsquo;re awake.</p>
<p>And we can speak about deep sleep and what happens there.</p>
<p>REM sleep is a fascinating time,</p>
<p>which is another stage of sleep often called dream sleep,</p>
<p>which is rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>That stage of sleep, some parts of your brain</p>
<p>are up to 30% more active than when you&rsquo;re awake.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s kind of violating this idea</p>
<p>that our mind is dormant</p>
<p>and our body is just simply quiescent and resting.</p>
<p>So I would happy to just sort of double click</p>
<p>on either one of those</p>
<p>and also what changes in the body as well.</p>
<p>But it is an intense evolutionary adaptive benefit</p>
<p>and system.</p>
<p>That said though, I would almost push back</p>
<p>against an evolved system.</p>
<p>When we think about the question of sleep and what sleep is,</p>
<p>our assumption has always been that we evolved to sleep.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve actually questioned that</p>
<p>and I have no way to get in a time capsule</p>
<p>and go back and prove this.</p>
<p>But what if we started off sleeping</p>
<p>and it was from sleep that wakefulness emerged?</p>
<p>Why do we assume that it&rsquo;s the other way around?</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s probably some really good evidence</p>
<p>that sleep may have been the proto state,</p>
<p>that it was the basic fundamental living state.</p>
<p>And when we became awake, as it were,</p>
<p>we always had to return to sleep.</p>
<p>You know, in some ways at that point,</p>
<p>sleep was the price that we paid for wakefulness.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another way of describing what sleep is.</p>
<p>But again, I think it sort of denies</p>
<p>the active state of sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a passive state of sleep either.</p>
<p>And then finally you can say,</p>
<p>what is sleep across different species?</p>
<p>And in us human beings and in all mammalian species</p>
<p>and avian species as well,</p>
<p>sleep is broadly separated into these two main types.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got non-rapid eye movement sleep on the one hand,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ve got rapid eye movement sleep on the other.</p>
<p>And we can speak about how they unfold across the night</p>
<p>and their architecture,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just intellectually interesting</p>
<p>from the perspective of what sleep is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also practically impactful for our daily lives.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to sort of go down that route too,</p>
<p>but you navigate, you tell me, I can.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s definitely go down that route.</p>
<p>So you mentioned how active the brain is</p>
<p>during certain phases of sleep.</p>
<p>When I was coming up in science,</p>
<p>REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>was referred to as paradoxical sleep.</p>
<p>Is that still a good way to think about it?</p>
<p>Paradoxical because the brain is so active</p>
<p>and yet we are essentially paralyzed, correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, it really is a paradox.</p>
<p>And where that came from was simply</p>
<p>the brainwave recordings.</p>
<p>That if all I&rsquo;m measuring about you</p>
<p>is your brainwave activity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult for me</p>
<p>sitting outside of the sleep laboratory room</p>
<p>to figure out, are you awake or are you in REM sleep?</p>
<p>Because those two patterns of brain activity</p>
<p>are so close to one another,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t discriminate between them.</p>
<p>Yet the paradox is that when you are awake,</p>
<p>I go in there and you&rsquo;re sort of sitting up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re clearly conscious and awake.</p>
<p>But yet when you go into REM sleep,</p>
<p>you are completely paralyzed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of the paradox,</p>
<p>but the paradox really just comes down</p>
<p>to two dramatically different conscious states.</p>
<p>Yet brain activity is dramatically</p>
<p>more similar than different.</p>
<p>And the way I can figure out which of the two you are in</p>
<p>is by measuring two other signals,</p>
<p>the activity from your eyes</p>
<p>and the activity from your muscles.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re awake, we will occasionally have these blinks</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have sort of saccades.</p>
<p>But during REM sleep,</p>
<p>you have these really bizarre horizontal</p>
<p>shuttling eye movements that occur.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the name comes from, rapid eye movements.</p>
<p>Are they always horizontal?</p>
<p>Mostly they are horizontal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the ways that we can differentiate them</p>
<p>from other waking eye movement activity.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not always, it can be sometimes horizontal,</p>
<p>but can it also have diagonal</p>
<p>and also vertically in that plane.</p>
<p>But then the muscle activity is the real dead giveaway.</p>
<p>Just before you enter REM sleep,</p>
<p>your brainstem, which is where the dynamics of non-REM</p>
<p>and REM are essentially played out</p>
<p>and then expressed upstairs in the cortex</p>
<p>and downstairs in the body.</p>
<p>When we go into REM sleep</p>
<p>and just a few seconds before that happens,</p>
<p>the brainstem sends a signal</p>
<p>all the way down the spinal cord.</p>
<p>And it communicates with what are called</p>
<p>the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord,</p>
<p>which control the voluntary skeletal muscles.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a signal of paralysis.</p>
<p>And when you go into dream sleep,</p>
<p>you are locked into a physical incarceration</p>
<p>of your own body.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>You know, why would mother nature do such a thing?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in some ways very simple.</p>
<p>The brain paralyzes the body</p>
<p>so that the mind can dream safely.</p>
<p>Because think about how quickly</p>
<p>we would have all been popped out of the gene pool.</p>
<p>You know, if I think I&rsquo;m one of the best skydivers</p>
<p>who can just simply fly,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve had sometimes those dreams too,</p>
<p>and I get up on my apartment window and I leap out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the sort of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of the paradox of REM sleep,</p>
<p>both its brain activity similarity,</p>
<p>despite the behavioral state being so different,</p>
<p>and this bizarre lockdown</p>
<p>of the sort of brain of the body itself.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the involuntary muscles,</p>
<p>thankfully, aren&rsquo;t paralyzed.</p>
<p>So you keep breathing, your heart keeps beating.</p>
<p>Is this why men have erections during REM sleep</p>
<p>and women have vaginal lubrication during sleep?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Part of the other reason though there</p>
<p>is because of the autonomic activity.</p>
<p>So there is a nervous,</p>
<p>a part of our nervous system</p>
<p>called the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>and it controls many of the automatic behaviors.</p>
<p>And some of those are aspects of our reproductive facilities.</p>
<p>During REM sleep, what we later discovered</p>
<p>is that you go through these bizarre,</p>
<p>what we call autonomic storms,</p>
<p>which sounds dramatic,</p>
<p>but it actually is when you measure them,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll go through periods</p>
<p>where your heart rate decelerates and drops</p>
<p>and your blood pressure goes down,</p>
<p>and then utterly randomly,</p>
<p>your heart rate accelerates dramatically,</p>
<p>and what we call the fight or flight branch</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>or the sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>badly named because it&rsquo;s anything but sympathetic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very aggravating,</p>
<p>that all of a sudden fires up,</p>
<p>and then it shuts down again.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not in any regular way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s when you get those autonomic storms,</p>
<p>you get very activated from a physiological perspective</p>
<p>that you can have these erections</p>
<p>and you have vaginal discharge, et cetera.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re totally paralyzed.</p>
<p>But you are still paralyzed.</p>
<p>There are only two voluntary muscle groups</p>
<p>that are spurred from the paralysis.</p>
<p>Bizarre.</p>
<p>One, your extraocular muscles,</p>
<p>because if they were paralyzed,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to have rapid eye movements.</p>
<p>And the other that we later discovered</p>
<p>was the inner ear muscle.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got no good understanding</p>
<p>as to why those two muscle groups</p>
<p>are spurred from the paralysis.</p>
<p>It may have something to do with cranial nerve,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s perhaps something more sensory related.</p>
<p>Some people have argued that the reason the eyeballs</p>
<p>are spurred from the paralysis</p>
<p>is because if your eyeballs are left</p>
<p>for long periods of time inactive,</p>
<p>you may get things such as oxygen issues</p>
<p>in the aqueous or vitreous humor.</p>
<p>And so the eyeballs have to keep moving</p>
<p>in some way.</p>
<p>The systems of the anterior eye</p>
<p>are made to require movement.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>People with glaucoma have deficits</p>
<p>in drainage through the anterior chamber.</p>
<p>But there I&rsquo;m speculating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also speculating when I asked this.</p>
<p>I would imagine that there are states in waking</p>
<p>that also resemble slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>or rather that there are states</p>
<p>that slow wave sleep also resembles waking states.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve beautifully illustrated how REM sleep</p>
<p>can mimic some of the more active brain states</p>
<p>that we achieve in waking.</p>
<p>What sort of waking state that I might have experienced</p>
<p>or experience on a daily basis</p>
<p>might look similar to slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>non-REM sleep, if any?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a genius way of thinking about it.</p>
<p>Turns the tables.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>We almost never see anything like</p>
<p>the true ultra slow waves of deep non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>So we spoke about these two stages, non-REM and REM.</p>
<p>Non-REM is further subdivided into four separate stages,</p>
<p>stages one through four,</p>
<p>increasing in their depth of sleep.</p>
<p>So stages three and four,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we typically call deep non-REM sleep,</p>
<p>stages one and two.</p>
<p>So maybe take me through the arc of a night,</p>
<p>just so that, so I put my head down.</p>
<p>Well, for you, what time do you normally go to sleep?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m usually sort of around about a 10.30 p.m. guy.</p>
<p>And usually I&rsquo;ll naturally wake up</p>
<p>sort of a little bit before seven,</p>
<p>sometimes before 6.45 or seven.</p>
<p>I have an alarm set for 7.04 a.m.</p>
<p>You heard it here, folks.</p>
<p>Matt Walker does use an alarm clock.</p>
<p>I really, really, I&rsquo;m usually-</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t recommend it, but he does use it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I usually-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re human after all.</p>
<p>Oh, I am so human.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had my sleep issues</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d love to speak about that too.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s only just, you know, in the event that,</p>
<p>you know, because I like to keep regularity too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to keep those two things in balance.</p>
<p>And 7.04, just because, you know,</p>
<p>why not be idiosyncratic?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why we always set things on these hard numbers.</p>
<p>So, yep, so when you and I-</p>
<p>So you go to sleep around 10.30.</p>
<p>So using you as an example,</p>
<p>because I imagine a number of people go to sleep</p>
<p>at different times, but 10.30 is about when I go to sleep.</p>
<p>11 is for me, but, so you go to sleep at 10.30.</p>
<p>So for that first, let&rsquo;s say three hours of sleep,</p>
<p>what is the architecture of that sleep look like</p>
<p>as compared to the last three hours</p>
<p>of your sleep before morning?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I should note that that sort of, you know,</p>
<p>10.30 to seven, that&rsquo;s just based on my chronotype</p>
<p>and my preferential.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different for different people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that that&rsquo;s the perfect sweet spot</p>
<p>for humanity&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just my-</p>
<p>But I imagine most people probably go to sleep</p>
<p>somewhere between 10 and PM and midnight.</p>
<p>And most probably wake up between 5.00 AM and 7.00 AM</p>
<p>or 5.30 and 7.30.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>At least in, if you look at sort of First World Nations,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a typical sleep profile.</p>
<p>So when I first fall asleep,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go into the light stages of non-REM sleep,</p>
<p>stages one and two of non-REM.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll start to descend down</p>
<p>into the deeper stages of non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>So after about maybe 20 minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to head down into stage three non-REM</p>
<p>and then into stage four non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;m starting to fall asleep,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve cast off from the,</p>
<p>usually with me, murky waters of wakefulness,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m in the shallows of sleep, stages one and two,</p>
<p>my heart rate starts to drop a little bit.</p>
<p>And then my brainwave pattern activity starts to slow down.</p>
<p>Normally when I&rsquo;m awake,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going up and down maybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times a second.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m going into light non-REM sleep,</p>
<p>it will slow down to maybe 15, 20,</p>
<p>and then really starts to slow down,</p>
<p>down to about sort of 10 or eight cycles per second,</p>
<p>eight cycle waves per second.</p>
<p>Then as I&rsquo;m starting to move into stages three and four,</p>
<p>non-REM sleep, several remarkable things happen.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, my heart rate really does start to drop.</p>
<p>Oh, and I&rsquo;ll come back to temperature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to write temperature down</p>
<p>because I always forget these things.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m sadly in the foothills of middle age.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;m starting to go into those deeper stages</p>
<p>of non-REM sleep, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of cells in my cortex</p>
<p>all decide to fire together,</p>
<p>and then they all go silent together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this remarkable physiological coordination</p>
<p>of the likes that we just don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>during any other brain state.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Having recorded from the brains of animals</p>
<p>and a little bit from humans,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen the entire cortex</p>
<p>or even entire regions of cortex light up like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s stunning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like this beautiful sort of mantra chant</p>
<p>or this sort of, you know, it&rsquo;s a slow inhale</p>
<p>and then a meditative exhale, inhale, exhale.</p>
<p>And these waves are just enormous in their size.</p>
<p>And the body is capable of movement at this time.</p>
<p>There is no paralysis.</p>
<p>There is no paralysis, but for the most part,</p>
<p>the muscle tone has also dropped significantly</p>
<p>at that point.</p>
<p>And then you will, or I will then stay there</p>
<p>for about another 20 or 30 minutes.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m maybe 60 or 70 minutes into my first sleep cycle.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll start to rise back up,</p>
<p>back up into stage two non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>And then after about 80 or so minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pop up and I&rsquo;ll have a short REM sleep period.</p>
<p>And then back down I go again,</p>
<p>down into non-REM, up into REM.</p>
<p>And you do that reliably, repeatedly.</p>
<p>And I will be doing that.</p>
<p>And I do do that every 90 minutes.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s the average for most adults.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different in different species.</p>
<p>What changes to your question is the ratio</p>
<p>of non-REM to REM within that 90 minute cycle</p>
<p>as you move across the night.</p>
<p>And what I mean by this is in the first half of the night,</p>
<p>the majority of those 90 minute cycles</p>
<p>are comprised of lots of deep non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I get my stage three and four</p>
<p>of deep non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>Once I push through to the second half of the night,</p>
<p>now that seesaw balance changes.</p>
<p>And instead, the majority of those 90 minute cycles</p>
<p>are comprised either of this lighter form</p>
<p>of non-REM sleep, stage two non-REM sleep,</p>
<p>and much more and increasingly more</p>
<p>rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>And the implication that I was sort of speaking</p>
<p>about pragmatically is let&rsquo;s say that</p>
<p>I have to, and I usually never do early morning flights</p>
<p>or red eyes just because I&rsquo;m a mess.</p>
<p>If that happens, I&rsquo;m not suggesting</p>
<p>that other people shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m suggesting people not do that.</p>
<p>Every time I&rsquo;ve taken a red eye or I&rsquo;ve done that,</p>
<p>two or three days later, I get some sort of general feeling</p>
<p>of malaise, my brain doesn&rsquo;t work as well.</p>
<p>I think red eyes should be abolished.</p>
<p>For the pilots too, I mean, and for the-</p>
<p>Oh, and we can speak about those.</p>
<p>And for the emergency room, I mean,</p>
<p>long shifts have been shown to lead to, you know,</p>
<p>physician-induced errors that lead to a lot of fatalities.</p>
<p>I mean, there are a lot of reasons why staying up too long</p>
<p>or being up at the wrong times,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not adapted to it, is just terrible.</p>
<p>The data in all of those cases, you know,</p>
<p>and particularly physicians too,</p>
<p>there was some recent data looking at suicidality</p>
<p>and the rates of suicide in training physicians</p>
<p>are far, far above the norm.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t suspect that, you know,</p>
<p>their schedules are helping them.</p>
<p>I suspect that sleep is a missing part</p>
<p>of that explanatory equation, but-</p>
<p>I teach medical students and they&rsquo;re phenomenal,</p>
<p>but yeah, they&rsquo;re under extremely challenged conditions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t put them under those conditions.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not optimizing performance.</p>
<p>I have one-</p>
<p>But sorry, I was, sorry-</p>
<p>No, no, no, this is important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important digression.</p>
<p>I have one question, which is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that as across the night,</p>
<p>a greater percentage of these 90 minute cycles</p>
<p>are going to be occupied by REM sleep</p>
<p>as you progress through the night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware that based on work that you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and from your public education efforts and others,</p>
<p>that we have so-called circadian forces</p>
<p>and we have other forces that are driving when we sleep</p>
<p>and when we want to sleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>Without going into the details of those,</p>
<p>I have a simple question.</p>
<p>The experiment is the following.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, God forbid, you are prevented</p>
<p>from going to sleep at your normal time</p>
<p>and you stay up for the four hours or five hours</p>
<p>that normally you would be in predominantly</p>
<p>slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>If, let&rsquo;s say you finally get to lie down at 3 a.m.,</p>
<p>a time when normally your sleep would be occupied</p>
<p>mostly by rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>will you experience a greater percentage</p>
<p>of rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>because of these so-called circadian forces,</p>
<p>meaning that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s appropriate for that time,</p>
<p>or will your system need to start at the beginning</p>
<p>of the race that we&rsquo;re, as I&rsquo;m referring to it,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re calling sleep?</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not clear to anybody,</p>
<p>basically what I&rsquo;m asking is if you are forced</p>
<p>to skip the slow wave sleep part of the night,</p>
<p>will your system leap into rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>or does it have to start at the beginning</p>
<p>and get slow wave sleep first?</p>
<p>In other words, does one sleep state</p>
<p>drive the entry to the next sleep state?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>So there is some degree of reciprocity</p>
<p>between the sleep states, I should note,</p>
<p>that when we drive one of those up,</p>
<p>we often, but not always, see a change in the other.</p>
<p>There are some pharmacologies</p>
<p>that have shown an independence to that,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve also played around with things like temperature,</p>
<p>and sometimes you can nudge one</p>
<p>and not seem to upset or perturb the other.</p>
<p>But to your, I think, lovely point,</p>
<p>the answer is it&rsquo;s a mix, but it&rsquo;s mostly the latter,</p>
<p>meaning you will mostly go into your REM sleep phases</p>
<p>and be significantly deficient in your deep sleep.</p>
<p>So just because I start my sleep cycle at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>rather than at 10.30 p.m.,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that my brain just says,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ve got a program</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just going to run the program,</p>
<p>and the way the program runs is that we always start</p>
<p>with the first couple of hours of deep sleep.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just gonna begin act number one, scene one.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Now, I will get some deep sleep to begin with,</p>
<p>and part of that is just because of how sleep works</p>
<p>based on how long I&rsquo;ve been awake.</p>
<p>Longer I&rsquo;m awake,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a significantly greater pressure for deep sleep.</p>
<p>But we actually use exactly what you just described</p>
<p>as an experimental technique</p>
<p>to selectively deprive people</p>
<p>of one of those stages of sleep or the other.</p>
<p>So we will do first half of the night deprivation</p>
<p>and then let you sleep the second half.</p>
<p>So that means that you will be mostly deep sleep deprived</p>
<p>and you will still get mostly all of your REM sleep.</p>
<p>And then we switch it,</p>
<p>so you only get your first four hours,</p>
<p>which means you will mostly get deep non-REM sleep,</p>
<p>but you will get almost no REM sleep.</p>
<p>So in both of those groups,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve both had four hours of sleep.</p>
<p>So the difference between them</p>
<p>in terms of an experimental outcome</p>
<p>is not the sleep time</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve both slept for the same amount.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the contribution of those different stages.</p>
<p>Now, we actually have more elegant methods</p>
<p>for sort of selectively going in there</p>
<p>and scooping out different stages of sleep,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the way we used to do it old school</p>
<p>was just using this timing difference.</p>
<p>And who suffers more, those that lack the early phase</p>
<p>and where those that lack the later phase of the night sleep.</p>
<p>In other words, if I have to sleep only four hours</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>am I better off getting the early part of the night sleep</p>
<p>or the second half of the night sleep?</p>
<p>Depends on what the outcome measure is.</p>
<p>So that gets right to the differences</p>
<p>between slow wave sleep and REM.</p>
<p>I was probably misinformed,</p>
<p>but my understanding, a very crude understanding,</p>
<p>I should say before.</p>
<p>I very much doubt it, no contra with someone like you.</p>
<p>Which is that they&rsquo;re very nice of you,</p>
<p>but the first part of the night,</p>
<p>the slow wave sleep is restorative to the musculature,</p>
<p>to motor learning,</p>
<p>and that the dream content tends to be less emotional.</p>
<p>The second half of the night being more emotional dreams</p>
<p>and sort of the unpairing of the emotional load</p>
<p>of our previous day and other experiences.</p>
<p>So in other words, if I were to deprive myself of REM,</p>
<p>I would be hyper-emotional,</p>
<p>maybe not as settled with the kind of experiences</p>
<p>of my life.</p>
<p>Whereas if I deprive myself of slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>I would feel a more physical malaise.</p>
<p>Is that correct or is that far too simple?</p>
<p>And if it is too simple, please tell me where I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>No, I think much of that is correct.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of that plus.</p>
<p>So for example, during deep non-REM sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where we get this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost a form of natural blood pressure medication.</p>
<p>And so when I take that away from you the next day,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re usually going to see autonomic dysfunction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re usually going to see abnormalities</p>
<p>in heart rate, blood pressure.</p>
<p>We also know that during deep non-REM sleep</p>
<p>that there is a certain control of specific hormones.</p>
<p>For example, we know that the insulin regulation</p>
<p>of sort of metabolism,</p>
<p>meaning how will you look</p>
<p>from a regulated blood sugar perspective</p>
<p>versus dysregulated pre-diabetic look of profile,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where deep sleep seems to matter.</p>
<p>If we selectively deprive you of that,</p>
<p>we can see-</p>
<p>Growth hormone?</p>
<p>Growth hormone is different actually.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a beautiful demonstration</p>
<p>where growth hormone seems to be more REM sleep dependent.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we can come on to the effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some really impressive frightening data</p>
<p>on alcohol and its disruption of sleep.</p>
<p>But then we also know testosterone.</p>
<p>Peak levels of testosterone happen during REM sleep.</p>
<p>So the second half of the night.</p>
<p>Which is the second half of the night.</p>
<p>So it really just means that your profile</p>
<p>of mental and physical dysfunction</p>
<p>will be different under both of those conditions.</p>
<p>Which one would you prefer?</p>
<p>I would prefer neither of them.</p>
<p>And it really depends on what you&rsquo;re trying to optimize for.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just so complex.</p>
<p>You know, sleep is just so pluripotent.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s so physiologically systemic</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost impossible</p>
<p>not to undergo one of those two things,</p>
<p>just deep sleep deprivation or just REM sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>And not show a profile that you would</p>
<p>really prefer to avoid.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason from an evolutionary standpoint</p>
<p>that we have preserved those stages of sleep.</p>
<p>I mean, sleep is just so idiotic,</p>
<p>you know, from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p>Or maybe waking is idiotic.</p>
<p>Or waking is, you know, well, yeah.</p>
<p>Based on your previous idea.</p>
<p>Who have you been talking to?</p>
<p>I think that comment is very specific to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I am normally, always an idiot when waking.</p>
<p>But I think this idea that sleep, you know,</p>
<p>is so profoundly detrimental to us</p>
<p>if you were to take it at face value.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re not finding a mate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not reproducing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not foraging for food.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not caring for your young.</p>
<p>And worst of all, you&rsquo;re vulnerable to predation.</p>
<p>On any one of those grounds,</p>
<p>sleep probably should have been selected against.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Sleep has fought its way through heroically.</p>
<p>You know, every step along the evolutionary path.</p>
<p>And therefore, every sleep stage has also survived,</p>
<p>as best we can tell.</p>
<p>What that means is that those are non-negotiable.</p>
<p>If Mother Nature had found a way</p>
<p>to even just sort of, you know,</p>
<p>thin slice some of that sleep from us,</p>
<p>there would have been vast, I&rsquo;m sure, evolutionary benefits.</p>
<p>But it looks as though she hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m usually in favor of her wisdom</p>
<p>after 3.6 million years, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I want to introduce another Gedanken experiment,</p>
<p>another thought experiment.</p>
<p>So in this arc of the night,</p>
<p>slow-wave sleep predominates early in the night</p>
<p>and then REM sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a scenario that many people,</p>
<p>including myself, experience on a regular basis,</p>
<p>which is they go to sleep, sleeping just fine.</p>
<p>Three, four hours into it, they wake up.</p>
<p>They wake up for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Maybe there was a noise,</p>
<p>maybe the temperature isn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>We will certainly talk about sleep hygiene, et cetera.</p>
<p>They get up, they go to the restroom.</p>
<p>They might flip on the lights, they might not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll get back in bed.</p>
<p>Hopefully they&rsquo;re not picking up their phone</p>
<p>and starting to browse and wake up the brain</p>
<p>through various mechanisms,</p>
<p>light and cognitive stimulation, et cetera.</p>
<p>They go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say after about 10, 15 minutes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to fall back asleep.</p>
<p>And then they sleep till their more typical wake time.</p>
<p>How detrimental is that wake-up episode or event</p>
<p>in terms of longevity, learning, et cetera?</p>
<p>I would love to sleep the entire night through every night,</p>
<p>but most nights I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And yet I feel pretty good throughout the day.</p>
<p>Some days better than others.</p>
<p>So if you were to kind of evaluate that waking episode</p>
<p>and compare it to sleeping the whole night through,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>So I think if you&rsquo;re waking up sort of frequently</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>I would probably get your estate in order</p>
<p>because my guess is within the next year,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be done for.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m kidding you.</p>
<p>Absolutely kidding you.</p>
<p>It is perfectly natural and normal,</p>
<p>particularly as we progress with age.</p>
<p>Children tend to have typically more continuous sleep.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not that they aren&rsquo;t waking up</p>
<p>for brief periods of time, they are.</p>
<p>And in fact, we all do.</p>
<p>When we come out the other end of our sleep cycle,</p>
<p>at the end of our REM sleep period of the 90 minute cycle,</p>
<p>almost everybody wakes up and we make a postural movement.</p>
<p>We turn over because we&rsquo;ve been paralyzed for so long</p>
<p>and the body will also like to shift.</p>
<p>Do we ever look around?</p>
<p>Do we ever open our eyes and look around?</p>
<p>Sometimes people will open their eyes,</p>
<p>but usually it&rsquo;s only for a brief period of time</p>
<p>and they usually never commit those awakenings to memory.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Your situation and it&rsquo;s my situation as well.</p>
<p>I usually now at this stage of life,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t sleep through the night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll usually have a bathroom break and then I&rsquo;ll come back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perfectly normal.</p>
<p>We tend to forget that in sleep science,</p>
<p>we think of sleep efficiency.</p>
<p>So of the total amount of time that you&rsquo;re in bed,</p>
<p>how much of that percent time is spent asleep?</p>
<p>And we usually look to numbers that are above 85% or more</p>
<p>as a healthy sleep efficiency.</p>
<p>So if you were to think about me going to bed</p>
<p>and I spend, you know, let&rsquo;s say eight and a quarter,</p>
<p>eight and a half hours of time in bed</p>
<p>with a normal healthy sleep efficiency,</p>
<p>I still may be only sleeping a total of seven</p>
<p>and a half hours or seven and three quarter hours.</p>
<p>Meaning that I&rsquo;m going to be awake in total,</p>
<p>not in one long bout,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to be awake for upwards of 30 minutes</p>
<p>net some time.</p>
<p>Sometimes that can be after a 10 minute, you know,</p>
<p>dalliance after having gone to the bathroom</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just gradually drifting back off again.</p>
<p>Other times it will just be for a couple of minutes</p>
<p>and most of those you don&rsquo;t commit.</p>
<p>So I think we need to stop.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to get too worried about, you know,</p>
<p>periods of time awake</p>
<p>just because we&rsquo;re not sleeping throughout the night.</p>
<p>I would love to do that too.</p>
<p>And I remember when that used to happen</p>
<p>and it still happens occasionally.</p>
<p>It feels great when it does happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lovely thing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a surprise, right?</p>
<p>It is not now a surprise.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness, I slept through the whole night.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a surprise.</p>
<p>But for the most part,</p>
<p>I think we can be more relaxed about that.</p>
<p>Where we have to be a bit more attentive though,</p>
<p>is if you are spending long periods of time</p>
<p>not being able to get back to sleep.</p>
<p>And usually we define that by saying,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s been 20, 25 minutes,</p>
<p>normally that&rsquo;s a time when we would really say,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s explore this.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>The other thing is if it&rsquo;s happening very frequently.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re not awake for 25 minute stretches,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re finding yourself waking up</p>
<p>and being consciously aware that you&rsquo;ve woken up</p>
<p>for maybe six, seven or eight times throughout the night.</p>
<p>And your sleep is very, what we call fragmented.</p>
<p>The great science of sleep in the past five or 10 years</p>
<p>has been, yes, quantity is important,</p>
<p>but quality is just as important.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t have one without the other</p>
<p>in terms of a good beneficial next day outcome.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just get four hours of sleep,</p>
<p>but brilliant quality of sleep and be unimpaired.</p>
<p>Nor can you get eight hours of sleep,</p>
<p>but have very poor quality of sleep</p>
<p>and be unimpaired the next day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I just sort of want to asterisk this idea of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not get too worried about waking up</p>
<p>and having some time awake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perfectly normal and natural.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s happening very frequently throughout the night,</p>
<p>all those periods of time or long stretches of time,</p>
<p>upwards of 25 minutes, then let&rsquo;s look into it.</p>
<p>Well, I can assure you just helps a lot of people</p>
<p>feel better about this waking up episode</p>
<p>that I and many other people experience.</p>
<p>I hope so because I think it&rsquo;s really important that we,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve been desperately guilty of perhaps,</p>
<p>early on being too puritanical about sleep.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve retrospected and I&rsquo;ve tried to explore</p>
<p>why this was the case.</p>
<p>It was almost sleep or else, dot, dot, dot.</p>
<p>And at the time when I was starting to write the book,</p>
<p>which was back in 2016,</p>
<p>sleep was still a neglected stepsister</p>
<p>in the health conversation of today.</p>
<p>And I could see all of the, and it&rsquo;s changing,</p>
<p>and not because of my efforts,</p>
<p>but because of all of my colleagues.</p>
<p>I would say, well, it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>that you give attribution to other people involved.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s a big field,</p>
<p>but I think you&rsquo;ve done a great service</p>
<p>by cuing people to the importance of this state,</p>
<p>not just for avoiding troublesome outcomes,</p>
<p>but also for optimizing their waking state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, I view sleep as this period that feels good,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not aware of how it feels</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re in it necessarily.</p>
<p>It has tremendous benefits</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing it well, so to speak,</p>
<p>and it has tremendous deficits when we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And I think it was an important thing for you to do</p>
<p>to cue people to this issue.</p>
<p>And I would say, mission accomplished,</p>
<p>that people are aware of the need for sleep.</p>
<p>I think that knowing that waking up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night is normal,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not too frequent, is great,</p>
<p>and will also help people</p>
<p>who may have been overly concerned about that.</p>
<p>I do want to use this as an opportunity</p>
<p>to raise something about the so-called Uberman schedule,</p>
<p>not to be confused with the Huberman schedule.</p>
<p>Fortunately, no one has confused those yet.</p>
<p>Some years ago, there was a discussion</p>
<p>about the so-called Uberman schedule,</p>
<p>meaning the Superman schedule.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Huberman without an H,</p>
<p>which I have nothing to do with.</p>
<p>If you read your Nietzsche, this will have a subtext.</p>
<p>But regardless, the Uberman schedule,</p>
<p>as I understand, is one in which the person</p>
<p>elects to sleep in 90-minute bouts</p>
<p>spread throughout the day and night</p>
<p>in an attempt to get more productivity</p>
<p>and or reduce their overall sleep need.</p>
<p>There was a paper published recently</p>
<p>that explored whether or not this is good or bad for us.</p>
<p>Maybe you just give us the take-home message on that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so these Uberman-like schedules,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s lots of different forms of that,</p>
<p>they tried to essentially pie chart the 24-hour period</p>
<p>into short bouts of sleep with some shorter,</p>
<p>or no, well, slightly longer periods of wakefulness</p>
<p>than short bouts of sleep than wakefulness.</p>
<p>I sort of made it, I think, a quip.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re sleeping like a baby,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the way that babies will sleep,</p>
<p>that they all have these brief naps,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re awake, then they&rsquo;re asleep,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re awake, and to the chagrin of parents,</p>
<p>across the night, it&rsquo;s basically the same.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re awake, they&rsquo;re asleep, they&rsquo;re awake, they&rsquo;re asleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s more the schedule</p>
<p>that these types of protocols have suggested.</p>
<p>And there was a really great comprehensive review</p>
<p>that found not only that they weren&rsquo;t necessarily helpful,</p>
<p>but they were actually really quite detrimental.</p>
<p>And on almost every performance metric,</p>
<p>whether it be task performance,</p>
<p>whether it be physiological outcome measures,</p>
<p>whether it even be the quality of the sleep</p>
<p>that they were having when they were trying to get it,</p>
<p>all of those were in a downward direction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not surprising.</p>
<p>If you look at the way that your physiology is programmed,</p>
<p>if you look at the way your circadian rhythm is programmed,</p>
<p>none of that screams to us</p>
<p>that we should be sleeping in that way.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m chuckling because we always hear,</p>
<p>sleep like a baby.</p>
<p>This is how babies sleep.</p>
<p>And I would say, don&rsquo;t sleep like a baby,</p>
<p>sleep like an adult.</p>
<p>Get your solid eight hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Billy Crystal&rsquo;s line.</p>
<p>He was a longstanding suffering insomniac.</p>
<p>He says, I sleep like a baby.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m awake every 20 minutes.</p>
<p>And I think this is another one of those demonstrations</p>
<p>that when you fight biology, you normally lose.</p>
<p>And the way you know you&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>is disease, sickness, and impairment.</p>
<p>And I think if you sleep in accordance</p>
<p>with the natural biological edict</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve all been given,</p>
<p>life tends to be both of a higher quality</p>
<p>and a longer duration.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>Along those lines, as a vision scientist,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very excited by the work</p>
<p>on these non-image forming cells in the eye,</p>
<p>the so-called melanopsin cells that inform the brain</p>
<p>about circadian time of day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a big proponent of people getting some sunlight,</p>
<p>ideally sunlight, but other forms of bright light</p>
<p>into their eyes early in the day</p>
<p>and when they want to be awake.</p>
<p>Essentially during the phase</p>
<p>of their 24-hour circadian cycle</p>
<p>when temperature is rising</p>
<p>and then starting to get less light in their eyes</p>
<p>as our temperature is going down</p>
<p>in terms of later in the day and in the evening.</p>
<p>Are there any adjustments to that general theme</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like to add in any way?</p>
<p>No, I think that&rsquo;s exactly what we recommend right now,</p>
<p>which is try to get at least 30 to 40 minutes of exposure</p>
<p>to some kind of natural daylight.</p>
<p>Now, there may be parts of the world where, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re from a rather cloudy part of the world.</p>
<p>I am from, yeah, Liverpool, England,</p>
<p>and the Northwest of England is not known</p>
<p>for its beach resorts and fine weather.</p>
<p>I remember I sort of, I went back home for a trip</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;d first been out in California,</p>
<p>and I thought, why is the sky so low?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just, you know, constantly out.</p>
<p>We joke that in the UK,</p>
<p>we usually have nine months of bad weather</p>
<p>and then three months of winter,</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s your entire year in terms of a climate.</p>
<p>But to come to your point, you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>Try to get that daylight.</p>
<p>Now, it can be, you know, working next to a window</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting that natural sunlight,</p>
<p>but that natural sunlight is,</p>
<p>even on a cloudy day in England,</p>
<p>is usually far more potent than anything</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll get from indoor lighting,</p>
<p>despite you thinking sort of from a perception-wise,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re much closer than I would think.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a big proponent of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an app called Light Meter, which will,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a free app, I have nothing to do with it,</p>
<p>that will allow you to get a pretty decent measurement</p>
<p>of the amount of light energy coming toward you.</p>
<p>And if you hold it up to a cloudy morning</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very bright out,</p>
<p>kind of a dismal day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that there&rsquo;ll be 1,000, 2,000,</p>
<p>even, you know, 5,000 lux,</p>
<p>lux just being a measure of brightness, of course.</p>
<p>And then you can point the same light meter</p>
<p>toward an indoor light that seems very bright</p>
<p>and very intense, and it&rsquo;ll say 500 lux.</p>
<p>And you realize that the intensity</p>
<p>as we gauge it perceptually</p>
<p>is not really what the system is receiving.</p>
<p>So outdoor light is key.</p>
<p>How do you get this natural stimulation,</p>
<p>or I should just say light stimulation early in the day?</p>
<p>What is your typical,</p>
<p>what does Matt Walker do to get this light stimulation?</p>
<p>I am no poster child, but usually I will,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m working out, I usually work out most days.</p>
<p>And I shopped around and I found a gym</p>
<p>that has huge amounts of window exposure</p>
<p>facing to the east.</p>
<p>This is gonna sound so ridiculous.</p>
<p>You know, Matt Walker chooses a gym</p>
<p>on the basis of the solar input,</p>
<p>so he can, you know, correct his circadian.</p>
<p>There are a lot of criteria for selecting gyms.</p>
<p>This one is actually grounded in physiology and biology.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>And selfishness about my own sleep.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So you get your exercise</p>
<p>and your light stimulation simultaneously.</p>
<p>Yep, yep.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re stacking cues</p>
<p>for wakefulness early in the day.</p>
<p>Exactly, so both exercise and daylight</p>
<p>are wonderful cues for circadian rhythm alignment</p>
<p>and also circadian rhythm reset each day.</p>
<p>And so I will use both exercise.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m neither a strong morning type</p>
<p>or a strong evening type.</p>
<p>And my preference to exercise</p>
<p>is probably some time in the middle of the day,</p>
<p>probably somewhere around 1 p.m., sorry, not 1 a.m.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m usually working out</p>
<p>probably around the sort of 7,</p>
<p>sort of 45, 8 a.m. time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually when I&rsquo;ll start my workout.</p>
<p>And there I&rsquo;ll start with cardio,</p>
<p>spin bike, facing a window.</p>
<p>And luckily for the most part here in California,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s usually sunlight coming through.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me because just as you said,</p>
<p>even when it&rsquo;s a cloudy day,</p>
<p>that lux coming through of light,</p>
<p>the intensity is splendid.</p>
<p>So I would prefer to favor my exercise</p>
<p>just because for efficiency too,</p>
<p>I wanna get also working on the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to match my exercise</p>
<p>more with my circadian light exposure</p>
<p>than I would probably if I&rsquo;m going to,</p>
<p>do I really wanna crush a workout</p>
<p>or do I want to just make sure it&rsquo;s a good workout?</p>
<p>I would prefer to work out at a different time,</p>
<p>but I like that because of the daylight.</p>
<p>And we can speak about exercise timing at some point</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion around that</p>
<p>when is the right time to exercise during sleep</p>
<p>and we can sort of bust some myths there too.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re spot on with the suggestion,</p>
<p>get some morning daylight,</p>
<p>try to get that exposure,</p>
<p>usually at least 30 to 40 minutes.</p>
<p>There was some great work recently coming out</p>
<p>in the occupational health domain</p>
<p>where they moved workers from offices</p>
<p>that were just facing walls</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t have any exposure to natural daylight.</p>
<p>And then they did a time period during that study</p>
<p>where they actually were in front of a window and working.</p>
<p>And they measured their sleep.</p>
<p>And their sleep time</p>
<p>and their sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m forgetting the numbers now,</p>
<p>but I think the increase in total sleep time</p>
<p>was well over 30 minutes.</p>
<p>And the improvement in sleep efficiency was five to 10%.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re batting an 80% sleep efficiency average,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a bit concerned about that.</p>
<p>But add 10% to that,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re in a great echelon of healthy sleepers.</p>
<p>And all you did was just spend some time</p>
<p>working in front of windows.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And probably folks might wanna consider</p>
<p>spending a little less time with sunglasses</p>
<p>provided they can do that safely.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not alone with your exercise behavior</p>
<p>and facing east.</p>
<p>So the one and only Tim Ferriss told me recently</p>
<p>that his morning routine nowadays</p>
<p>consists of jumping rope while facing east</p>
<p>to get the sunlight stimulation of the eyes.</p>
<p>And as Matt and I both know,</p>
<p>it has to be of the eyes, right?</p>
<p>These portals are the only way to convey</p>
<p>to the rest of the brain and body</p>
<p>about the time of day and wakefulness.</p>
<p>So along the lines of wakefulness,</p>
<p>I have a number of questions about caffeine.</p>
<p>The dreaded and beloved caffeine.</p>
<p>I love caffeine,</p>
<p>but I like it in relatively restricted periods of time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a big fan of waking up</p>
<p>and even though I wake up very groggy,</p>
<p>allowing my natural wakefulness signals to take hold.</p>
<p>Meaning I wake up very slowly,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t drink caffeine right away.</p>
<p>I sort of delay caffeine by a little while,</p>
<p>usually 90 minutes to two hours.</p>
<p>And that idea came to me on the basis of my understanding</p>
<p>of how caffeine and the adenosine receptor interact.</p>
<p>I have a feeling you&rsquo;re going to pronounce</p>
<p>adenosine differently than I do.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I will go with adenosine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to go with your skeletal instead of skeletal</p>
<p>and synapse and synapse.</p>
<p>Schedule and schedule.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>But to make it really simple for folks,</p>
<p>how does caffeine work to make us feel more alert?</p>
<p>And does the timing in which we ingest caffeine</p>
<p>play an important role in whether or not</p>
<p>it works for us or against us?</p>
<p>So maybe we just start with how does caffeine work?</p>
<p>Why is it that when I drink mate or coffee,</p>
<p>which are my preferred sources of caffeine,</p>
<p>do I feel a mental and physical lift?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m going to suggest</p>
<p>counter to what most people would think, drink coffee.</p>
<p>Or mate.</p>
<p>Is mate okay also?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Or whatever form you enjoy.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll come on to sort of why I suggest that,</p>
<p>but when it comes to coffee,</p>
<p>I would say the dose and the timing makes the poison.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with how caffeine works.</p>
<p>Caffeine is in a class of drugs</p>
<p>that we call the psychoactive stimulants.</p>
<p>So it works through a variety of mechanisms.</p>
<p>One is a dopamine mechanism.</p>
<p>Dopamine we often think of as a reward chemical.</p>
<p>But dopamine is also very much</p>
<p>an alerting neurochemical as well.</p>
<p>And caffeine has some role,</p>
<p>it seems to play in increasing dopamine.</p>
<p>But its principle mode of action,</p>
<p>we believe in terms of making me more alert</p>
<p>and keeping me awake throughout the day</p>
<p>is on the effects of adenosine.</p>
<p>And to explain what adenosine is,</p>
<p>from the moment that you and I woke up this morning,</p>
<p>this chemical adenosine has been building up in our brain.</p>
<p>And the longer that we&rsquo;re awake,</p>
<p>the more of that adenosine accumulates.</p>
<p>Is it, may I ask,</p>
<p>is it accumulating in neurons, in glia,</p>
<p>or in the blood vessels?</p>
<p>And is it also accumulating in my body?</p>
<p>Where is this adenosine coming from</p>
<p>and where is it accumulating?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the adenosine here that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>that is creating the sleep pressure</p>
<p>is a central brain phenomenon.</p>
<p>And it comes from the neurons themselves combusting energy.</p>
<p>And as they&rsquo;re combusting energy,</p>
<p>one of the offshoots of that is this chemical adenosine.</p>
<p>And so as we&rsquo;re awake throughout the day</p>
<p>and our brain is metabolically very active,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s accumulating and building up this adenosine.</p>
<p>Now, the more adenosine that we have,</p>
<p>the sleepier that we will feel.</p>
<p>So it really is like a sleep pressure is what we call it.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not a mechanical pressure, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>Your head&rsquo;s not going to explode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a chemical pressure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this weight of sleepiness</p>
<p>that we feel gradually growing as we get into the evening.</p>
<p>May I just interrupt you again to just ask,</p>
<p>do we know what the circuit mechanism is for that?</p>
<p>I mean, not to go too far down the rabbit hole,</p>
<p>but for the aficionados and for myself,</p>
<p>we have brain mechanisms like locus coeruleus</p>
<p>that release things, brain areas,</p>
<p>locus coeruleus just being a brain area, of course,</p>
<p>that release things that proactively create wakefulness.</p>
<p>So are those neurons shutting down</p>
<p>as a consequence of having too much adenosine</p>
<p>or are there areas of the brain that promote sleepiness</p>
<p>that are becoming activated?</p>
<p>Because you can imagine both things working in parallel.</p>
<p>One or the other would accomplish the same endpoint.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>And so there are two main receptors for adenosine,</p>
<p>the A1 receptor and the A2 receptor.</p>
<p>And they have different modes of activating brain cells</p>
<p>or inactivating or decreasing the likelihood of firing.</p>
<p>And adenosine works in this beautiful, elegant way</p>
<p>where it will inhibit and shut down</p>
<p>the wake-promoting areas of the brain,</p>
<p>whilst also increasing and dialing up the volume</p>
<p>on sleep, activating sleep-promoting regions.</p>
<p>Biology is so beautiful.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s fantastic. It&rsquo;s always a push-pull.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean,</p>
<p>and we could have a larger discussion at some point</p>
<p>about that everything, seeing dark edges,</p>
<p>seeing light edges, our ability to smell</p>
<p>or to sense pressure on the,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s a push-pull in biology.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s great, yeah, yep.</p>
<p>So this is another example where as I am awake longer,</p>
<p>adenosine is released in the brain</p>
<p>and my wakefulness areas are being actively shut down</p>
<p>by that adenosine.</p>
<p>And my sleepiness brain areas, so to speak,</p>
<p>are being promoted to be more active.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. And it&rsquo;s a very progressive process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a step function where,</p>
<p>and sometimes that happens occasionally,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s usually because you&rsquo;ve been sort of driving through</p>
<p>and as we&rsquo;ll come on to have caffeine in the system.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden you just hit a wall</p>
<p>and it just, you know, engulfs you</p>
<p>and you go from a zero to the one of sleepiness</p>
<p>within a short period of time.</p>
<p>What explains the fatigue after a hard conversation?</p>
<p>The desire to go to sleep or the desire to go to sleep</p>
<p>during a hard conversation?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting, I think it&rsquo;s usually just based</p>
<p>on personality type interactions.</p>
<p>And for the most part-</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;ve ever experienced that before.</p>
<p>No, people with you don&rsquo;t, but with me, they almost-</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, I mean, I&rsquo;ve experienced the desire to,</p>
<p>some conversations I&rsquo;m halfway through them</p>
<p>and I feel like I want to take a nap.</p>
<p>And I would love to look at, you know,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s sleep history.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve sort of seen that time and time again,</p>
<p>but, and then it could be, you know,</p>
<p>with folks like me, people just lose the will to live</p>
<p>within about five minutes of speaking with me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Not true.</p>
<p>They hear that sleep is important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s flattery, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But so the way that then caffeine comes into this equation,</p>
<p>as I was saying, it&rsquo;s usually a kind of a linear process</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s probably closer to an exponential</p>
<p>in terms of your subjective feeling of sleepiness.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t really been able to measure that in humans</p>
<p>because normally we, it&rsquo;s hard to actually, you know,</p>
<p>stick something into the brain and be, you know,</p>
<p>sucking, siphoning off stuff every couple of minutes</p>
<p>as you could do in animal studies</p>
<p>and keep asking people every couple of minutes,</p>
<p>how sleepy do you feel?</p>
<p>How sleepy?</p>
<p>And track to see if there&rsquo;s a linear rise in, you know,</p>
<p>adenosine, which then creates an exponential rise</p>
<p>in subjective sleepiness or what the dynamics are.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m kind of nerding out.</p>
<p>Caffeine comes into play here</p>
<p>because caffeine comes into your system</p>
<p>and it latches onto those welcome sites of adenosine,</p>
<p>the adenosine receptors.</p>
<p>But what it doesn&rsquo;t do is latch onto them and activate them</p>
<p>because if it was doing that, then it would, you know,</p>
<p>in lots of ways, it would dial up more sort of sleepiness.</p>
<p>It does the opposite.</p>
<p>The way that caffeine works is that it comes in,</p>
<p>competes with quite sharp elbows with adenosine,</p>
<p>competitively forces them out of the way,</p>
<p>hijacks that receptor by latching onto it,</p>
<p>but then just essentially blocks it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t inactivate the receptor.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t activate the receptor.</p>
<p>It functionally inactivates it in the sense</p>
<p>that it takes it out of the game for adenosine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like someone, you know, coming into a room</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just about to sit down on the chair</p>
<p>and caffeine comes in and just pulls out the chair</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, well, now I&rsquo;ve got nowhere to sit.</p>
<p>And caffeine just keeps pulling out the chairs</p>
<p>from adenosine and adenosine,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s at the same concentration in your brain,</p>
<p>your brain doesn&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;ve been awake for,</p>
<p>you know, 10 hours, 16 hours at that point</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve downed a cup of coffee,</p>
<p>because all of that adenosine that&rsquo;s still there</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t communicate to the brain</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been awake for 16 hours because-</p>
<p>But the adenosine is still in brain circulation.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So the real question is what happens</p>
<p>when caffeine is dislodged from the adenosine receptor?</p>
<p>Unfortunate things happen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we call the caffeine crash,</p>
<p>which is caffeine has a half-life and it&rsquo;s metabolized.</p>
<p>Do you recall what the half-life is?</p>
<p>Yeah, the half-life is somewhere between five to six hours</p>
<p>and the quarter-life, therefore,</p>
<p>is somewhere between 10 to 12 hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s variable.</p>
<p>Different people have different durations of its action,</p>
<p>but for the average adult, five to six hours.</p>
<p>That variation, we understand,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s down to a liver enzyme or a set of liver enzymes</p>
<p>of the class that we call the cytochrome P450 enzymes.</p>
<p>And there are, I think, last I delved into the data,</p>
<p>which was pretty recently,</p>
<p>there are two gene variants</p>
<p>that will dictate the enzymatic speed</p>
<p>with which the liver breaks down caffeine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you can have some people</p>
<p>who are very sensitive to caffeine</p>
<p>and other people who say,</p>
<p>you know, it just doesn&rsquo;t affect me really that much at all.</p>
<p>These are the people that have a double espresso</p>
<p>after a 9 p.m. dinner and can sleep just fine.</p>
<p>Well, and we&rsquo;ll come on to-</p>
<p>Or at least subjectively, they think they&rsquo;re sleeping.</p>
<p>Subjectively, yeah.</p>
<p>And we should speak about that, that assumptive danger too.</p>
<p>So then the caffeine is in the system</p>
<p>and after some time period,</p>
<p>it will be inactive in the system.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been awake for 12 hours now and it&rsquo;s, you know, 8 p.m.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m feeling a bit tired, but I want to push through</p>
<p>and I want to keep working for another couple of hours.</p>
<p>So I have a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>All of a sudden I was feeling tired,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ve been awake for 12 hours anymore</p>
<p>because with the caffeine in the system,</p>
<p>maybe only half of that adenosine is being communicated</p>
<p>through the receptor to my brain.</p>
<p>100% of the adenosine is still there.</p>
<p>Only half of it is allowed to communicate to my brain.</p>
<p>So now I think, well, I haven&rsquo;t been awake for 12 hours,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just been awake for six hours, I feel great.</p>
<p>Then after a few hours</p>
<p>and the caffeine is starting to come out of my system,</p>
<p>not only am I hit with the same levels of adenosine</p>
<p>that I had before I&rsquo;d had the cup of coffee</p>
<p>several hours ago, it&rsquo;s that plus all of the adenosine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been building up during the time</p>
<p>that the caffeine has been in my system.</p>
<p>So sort of an avalanche of adenosine.</p>
<p>It is a tsunami wave, yeah, and that&rsquo;s the caffeine crash.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting because the caffeine crash</p>
<p>at two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon when you have work to do</p>
<p>is a terrible thing, but what about the person,</p>
<p>maybe this person is me in my 20s,</p>
<p>who says, I&rsquo;m going to drink caffeine all day long</p>
<p>and then I want the crash because at nine or 10 p.m.,</p>
<p>if I stop drinking caffeine at say 6 p.m. and I crash,</p>
<p>then I crash into a slumber, a deep night of sleep.</p>
<p>Is that sleep really as deep as I think it is?</p>
<p>Because given the half-life of caffeine</p>
<p>that you mentioned a few moments ago,</p>
<p>I have to imagine that having some of that caffeine</p>
<p>circulating in my system might disrupt the depth of sleep</p>
<p>or somehow the architecture of sleep in a way</p>
<p>that even if I get eight or who knows,</p>
<p>even 10 hours of sleep, it might not be as restorative</p>
<p>as I would like it to be.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that is the danger, just sort of that,</p>
<p>you know, those people that you described who say,</p>
<p>and a lot of them will speak with me too,</p>
<p>say, look, I can have two espressos with dinner</p>
<p>and I fall asleep fine and I stay asleep</p>
<p>because usually those are the two phenotypes</p>
<p>that we typically see with too much caffeine.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t fall asleep as easily as I want to</p>
<p>or I fall asleep, but I just can&rsquo;t stay asleep</p>
<p>and caffeine can do both of those things quite potently.</p>
<p>How late in the day do you think is,</p>
<p>assuming somebody, translate this folks,</p>
<p>if you go to bed earlier or later,</p>
<p>you have to shift the hours accordingly,</p>
<p>but given somebody who typically gets into bed</p>
<p>around 10, 10.30 and falls asleep around 11, 11.30,</p>
<p>when would you recommend they halt caffeine intake?</p>
<p>And these are not strict prescriptives,</p>
<p>but I think people do benefit</p>
<p>from having some fairly clear guidelines</p>
<p>of what might work for them.</p>
<p>Would you say cut off caffeine by what time of the day?</p>
<p>I would usually say, take your typical bedtime</p>
<p>and count back sort of somewhere between 10 to,</p>
<p>eight hours is probably getting a little bit close,</p>
<p>but take back sort of 10 hours or eight hours of time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the time when you should really stop,</p>
<p>you know, using caffeine is the suggestion.</p>
<p>And the reason is because for those people</p>
<p>who even just keep drinking up until,</p>
<p>you know, into the evening,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right that they can fall asleep fine,</p>
<p>maybe they stay asleep,</p>
<p>but the depth of their deep sleep is not as deep anymore.</p>
<p>And so there are two consequences.</p>
<p>The first is that for me, and it can be up to by 30%.</p>
<p>And for me to drop your deep sleep by 30%,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to age you by between 10 to 12 years,</p>
<p>or you can just do it every night to yourself</p>
<p>with a couple of espressos.</p>
<p>The second is that you then wake up the next morning</p>
<p>and you think, well, I didn&rsquo;t have problems falling asleep</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t have problems staying asleep,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t feel particularly restored by my sleep.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m reaching for three or four cups of coffee</p>
<p>the next morning rather than just two or three cups</p>
<p>of coffee.</p>
<p>And so goes this dependency cycle that you then need</p>
<p>your uppers to wake you up in the morning.</p>
<p>And then sometimes people will use alcohol in the evening</p>
<p>to bring them down because they&rsquo;re overly caffeinated.</p>
<p>And alcohol, and we can speak about that too,</p>
<p>also has very deleterious impacts on your sleep as well.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right that it&rsquo;s not just the quantity</p>
<p>of your sleep or even difficulties falling</p>
<p>or staying asleep, it can also be deep sleep.</p>
<p>But here again, I think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be frightening people.</p>
<p>And I mentioned this before,</p>
<p>I think one of the real problems that I,</p>
<p>or mistakes that I made,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never had much public exposure before the book.</p>
<p>And I was so saddened by the disease and the suffering</p>
<p>that I was seeing as a consequence of a lack of sleep</p>
<p>in our society.</p>
<p>And the fact that it wasn&rsquo;t really being discussed</p>
<p>very much, I sort of came out a little bit headstrong,</p>
<p>more than a little bit headstrong.</p>
<p>And I think I was perhaps too much gas pedal</p>
<p>and too little, you know, break as it were.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right way</p>
<p>to approach health message within the public sphere.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve become much softer</p>
<p>in how I think about these things.</p>
<p>I have ideas about what the ideal world looks like</p>
<p>for sleep, but I also realized that none of us live</p>
<p>in this thing called the ideal world.</p>
<p>We certainly don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So, you know, I want to be really mindful of that.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve done a really bad job</p>
<p>of being sort of too forthright,</p>
<p>particularly for people who struggle with sleep.</p>
<p>You know, early on when I would offer these sort of messages</p>
<p>about sleep, I want to be, you know,</p>
<p>I want to be veritical when it comes to the science.</p>
<p>I want to be faithful to the science,</p>
<p>but I also don&rsquo;t want to go out</p>
<p>and scare the living daylights out of people,</p>
<p>particularly people who are struggling with their sleep,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s probably only going to make matters worse.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been beautifully schooled</p>
<p>by learning how to be a slightly better</p>
<p>public communicator.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nowhere near of the standing that you are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very elegant and it&rsquo;s very intuitive to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still with training wheels,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m getting a little bit better.</p>
<p>But I just want to say that when I&rsquo;m speaking about caffeine</p>
<p>because it sounds as though I&rsquo;m very sort of overt about it,</p>
<p>but I will come back to why I say drink coffee,</p>
<p>but I just want to make that point.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I appreciate you making that point,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure our listeners will too.</p>
<p>I still will stand behind my statement,</p>
<p>which is that what you&rsquo;ve done for the notion</p>
<p>that sleep is vital for all aspects of health</p>
<p>and for performance, mental and physical and wakefulness,</p>
<p>the message and the packaging it was contained in</p>
<p>and has been clearly, clearly net positive.</p>
<p>People needed to be cued to this.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>The I&rsquo;ll sleep when I&rsquo;m dead mentality is one that I had.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that other people have.</p>
<p>People in a huge number of vital communities,</p>
<p>not just your students, but also people.</p>
<p>The messaging that you provided and continue to provide</p>
<p>has positively impacted the first responder community,</p>
<p>the medical community.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still steps that need to be taken,</p>
<p>the military community,</p>
<p>and of course the civilian community.</p>
<p>And so I think these adjustments about,</p>
<p>yeah, caffeine&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>just restrict it to the early part of the day</p>
<p>if you can most days.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the law of averages,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the light viewing behavior.</p>
<p>I think it is critical to view sunlight or natural,</p>
<p>some other form of bright light early in the day.</p>
<p>But if you miss a day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that your whole system</p>
<p>is going to dissolve into a puddle of tears.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll happen on the second or the third day.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
<p>You get a couple of days.</p>
<p>Biology works in averages except with respect</p>
<p>to accident or injury.</p>
<p>A car accident is a car accident, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to have three of those</p>
<p>before the brain damage occurs</p>
<p>if the accident is severe enough.</p>
<p>But with sleep behavior,</p>
<p>these homeostatic type behaviors,</p>
<p>or with food, one chocolate sundae,</p>
<p>is it going to kill you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Every night, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to make you demented and kill you early.</p>
<p>We know this.</p>
<p>And so I think the middle ground</p>
<p>is often a hard place to achieve.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;ve done a phenomenal job,</p>
<p>but I appreciate you raising these points.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s clear that we all need to,</p>
<p>that we all can and should do certain things better,</p>
<p>including being gentle with ourselves from time to time</p>
<p>when we deviate from these ideal circumstances.</p>
<p>Along these lines, I do want to talk about alcohol</p>
<p>because I think caffeine and alcohol</p>
<p>represent the kind of two opposite ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Clearly, there are other stimulants.</p>
<p>There are your Adderalls</p>
<p>and your high-energy drinks that people use,</p>
<p>but alcohol and caffeine are the most commonly consumed,</p>
<p>as stimulants and sedatives,</p>
<p>depressants, as they&rsquo;re sometimes called.</p>
<p>So what happens when somebody has a glass,</p>
<p>we always hear a glass or two of wine in the evening</p>
<p>or a cocktail after dinner or before dinner?</p>
<p>How does that impact their sleep?</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll be sure to circle back</p>
<p>in terms of what is reasonable ranges of behavior</p>
<p>when it comes to avoiding alcohol</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol.</p>
<p>Yeah, so alcohol, if we&rsquo;re thinking about classes of drugs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in a class of drugs that we call the sedatives.</p>
<p>And I think one of the first problems</p>
<p>that people often mistake,</p>
<p>alcohol is often used as a sleep aid</p>
<p>for people who are struggling with sleep</p>
<p>when things like over-the-counter remedies, et cetera,</p>
<p>or herbal remedies have just not worked out for them.</p>
<p>And alcohol, unfortunately, is anything but a sleep aid.</p>
<p>The first reason that most people use it</p>
<p>is to try and help them fall asleep.</p>
<p>And this process of this event that we call falling asleep,</p>
<p>I have to imagine is a process.</p>
<p>It is a process.</p>
<p>Like everything in biology.</p>
<p>And that that process involves in some way,</p>
<p>as we talked about push-pull before,</p>
<p>turning off thinking, planning, et cetera,</p>
<p>and turning on some sort of relaxation mechanism.</p>
<p>I have to imagine that these two things</p>
<p>are knobs turning in opposite directions</p>
<p>that gives us this outcome we call falling asleep.</p>
<p>Alcohol, it seems, is helpful for some people</p>
<p>to turn off their thoughts or their planning.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>And so I think if we look at the pattern of brain activity,</p>
<p>if I were to place you inside an MRI scanner</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re looking at the activity of your brain</p>
<p>and watch you drifting off,</p>
<p>some parts of your brain will become less active.</p>
<p>Other parts will become more active.</p>
<p>And this is the push-pull model.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inhibition, excitation.</p>
<p>But alcohol is quite different in that regard.</p>
<p>Alcohol is, because it&rsquo;s a sedative,</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s really doing is trying to essentially</p>
<p>knock out your cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sedating your cortex.</p>
<p>And sedation is not sleep.</p>
<p>But when we have a couple of drinks in the evening,</p>
<p>when we have a couple of nightcaps,</p>
<p>we mistake sedation for sleep, saying,</p>
<p>well, I always, when I have like a couple of whiskeys</p>
<p>or a couple of cocktails,</p>
<p>it always helps me fall asleep faster.</p>
<p>In truth, what&rsquo;s happening is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing consciousness quicker,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep</p>
<p>any quicker.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the first sort of things</p>
<p>just to keep in mind.</p>
<p>The second thing with alcohol</p>
<p>is that it fragments your sleep.</p>
<p>And we spoke about the quality of your sleep</p>
<p>being just as important as the quantity.</p>
<p>And alcohol, through a variety of mechanisms,</p>
<p>some of which are activation of that autonomic nervous</p>
<p>system, that fight or flight branch of the nervous system,</p>
<p>alcohol will actually have you waking up</p>
<p>many more times throughout the night.</p>
<p>So your sleep is far less continuous.</p>
<p>Now, some of those awakenings will be</p>
<p>of conscious recollection the next day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll just remember waking up.</p>
<p>Many of them won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>And so, but yet your sleep will be littered</p>
<p>with these sort of punctured awakenings</p>
<p>throughout the night.</p>
<p>And again, when you wake up the next morning,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel restored by your sleep.</p>
<p>You know, fragmented sleep or non-continuous sleep</p>
<p>in this alcohol-induced way</p>
<p>is usually not good quality sleep</p>
<p>that you feel great on the next day.</p>
<p>The third part of alcohol in terms of an equation</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s quite potent at blocking your REM sleep,</p>
<p>your rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>And REM sleep is critical</p>
<p>for a variety of cognitive functions,</p>
<p>some aspects of learning and memory.</p>
<p>It seems to be critical for aspects</p>
<p>of emotional and mental health.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve described it before</p>
<p>as a sort of self-generated therapy</p>
<p>that occurs while we sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s overnight therapy.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s emotional first aid.</p>
<p>Certainly people that don&rsquo;t get enough sleep</p>
<p>are very easy to derail emotionally.</p>
<p>Not that one would want to do that to people,</p>
<p>but we all sort of fall apart emotionally.</p>
<p>I always think of it as almost like our skin sensitivity</p>
<p>can be heightened when we are sleep deprived.</p>
<p>Our emotional sensitivity is such that</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re sleep deprived,</p>
<p>such that it takes a much finer grain of sandpaper</p>
<p>to create that kind of friction.</p>
<p>Things bother us.</p>
<p>Threshold to trigger.</p>
<p>Even online comments bother us when we&rsquo;re sleep deprived.</p>
<p>And never when we&rsquo;re well-rested.</p>
<p>I would love to say that I never look at them,</p>
<p>except I look at, maybe every one of them.</p>
<p>Here I will editorialize,</p>
<p>because the notion of not looking at comments</p>
<p>is unreasonable to ask of any academic.</p>
<p>Because academics, we are all trained</p>
<p>to look at our teaching evaluations.</p>
<p>And just like with online comments,</p>
<p>to ignore 20% of them.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
<p>We look at them all.</p>
<p>In any event, so in terms of translating this to behavior,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t particularly enjoy alcohol.</p>
<p>I guess I might be fortunate in that sense,</p>
<p>but I also have never really experienced</p>
<p>the pleasure of drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>I sometimes like the taste of a drink,</p>
<p>but I never liked the sensation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t have a lot of familiarity with this,</p>
<p>but many people do.</p>
<p>And I understand that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say somebody enjoys a glass of wine or two</p>
<p>with dinner and they eat dinner at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Is that likely to disrupt their sleep at all?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just sort of, let&rsquo;s make this a series of gradations.</p>
<p>And the answer is yes.</p>
<p>I think once they just looked at a single glass of wine</p>
<p>in the evening with dinner,</p>
<p>and I would be untruthful if I didn&rsquo;t just simply say</p>
<p>it has an effect and we can measure that</p>
<p>in terms of the alcohol.</p>
<p>Less REM sleep.</p>
<p>And one of the fascinating studies,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what dose,</p>
<p>I think they got them close to a standard</p>
<p>illegal blood alcohol level.</p>
<p>So maybe they were a little bit tipsy.</p>
<p>And yes, you see all of the changes that we just described.</p>
<p>They sort of lose consciousness more quickly.</p>
<p>They have fragmented sleep</p>
<p>and they have a significant reduction in REM sleep.</p>
<p>But what was also interesting,</p>
<p>because REM sleep as we spoke about before</p>
<p>is a time when some hormonal systems</p>
<p>are essentially recharged and refreshed,</p>
<p>growth hormone being one of them.</p>
<p>There was well over a 50%, five zero drop</p>
<p>in their growth hormone release</p>
<p>during alcohol-laced sleep at night.</p>
<p>And growth hormone is so vital for metabolism</p>
<p>and repair of tissues.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just for kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially for adults.</p>
<p>Essential.</p>
<p>Along those lines, I just want to highlight the fact</p>
<p>that this information that you&rsquo;re sharing</p>
<p>that growth hormone release is strongly tethered</p>
<p>to the presence of healthy amounts of REM sleep</p>
<p>is interesting to me because I always thought</p>
<p>that growth hormone was released</p>
<p>in the early part of the night.</p>
<p>Well, it is released across both of those,</p>
<p>but across the different stages.</p>
<p>But what we also know is that when you disrupt REM sleep,</p>
<p>there are those growth hormone consequences.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an exclusive system.</p>
<p>Just like with testosterone,</p>
<p>we can see changes throughout non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>But if you ask when are the peak release rates</p>
<p>of testosterone, it&rsquo;s right before we go into REM sleep</p>
<p>and then during REM sleep.</p>
<p>And of course, testosterone being important</p>
<p>both for males and for females, right?</p>
<p>For libido and tissue repair and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Nobody, regardless of chromosomal, hormonal,</p>
<p>or any other background,</p>
<p>wants to have their normal levels</p>
<p>of testosterone reduced acutely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a bad, it equates to a terrible set</p>
<p>of psychological and physical symptoms.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the mortality risk that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with low testosterone is non-trivial.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So coming back to just the point on REM sleep</p>
<p>that you mentioned regarding emotional instability,</p>
<p>and we see that, that&rsquo;s one of the things,</p>
<p>one of the most reliable signatures</p>
<p>of just insufficient sleep,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve discovered over the past 20 years</p>
<p>here at The Sleep Center is that</p>
<p>there is no major psychiatric disorder</p>
<p>that we can find in which sleep is normal.</p>
<p>And so I think that firstly told us</p>
<p>there is a very intimate association</p>
<p>between your emotional mental health and your sleep health.</p>
<p>But when it also comes to REM sleep,</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s fascinating is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about your emotional health.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about your hormonal health.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also been seeing other aspects of cognition.</p>
<p>But then there was a report,</p>
<p>I think it could have been about two years ago,</p>
<p>out of Harvard, I think it was Beth Clearman&rsquo;s group.</p>
<p>They found that, and they replicated it</p>
<p>in two different large populations.</p>
<p>If you look at the contribution</p>
<p>of different sleep stages to your lifespan,</p>
<p>REM sleep was the strongest predictor of your longevity.</p>
<p>And it was a linear relationship,</p>
<p>but wasn&rsquo;t sort of one of these U-shaped or J-shaped curves</p>
<p>that we often see with total sleep and mortality risk.</p>
<p>It really was linear,</p>
<p>that the less and less REM sleep that you were getting,</p>
<p>the higher and higher your probability of death.</p>
<p>And then they did-</p>
<p>Was that death due to natural causes or accident?</p>
<p>Because I can imagine if you&rsquo;re not getting enough REM sleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to drive off the freeway,</p>
<p>step off a cliff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it was all cause and effect.</p>
<p>Or just make bad decisions about anything</p>
<p>in love relationships, which can also be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve tried to lean into that</p>
<p>and claim that I, with those bad relationship situations,</p>
<p>that, oh, I just didn&rsquo;t have enough REM sleep last night,</p>
<p>my darling.</p>
<p>The REM sleep defense.</p>
<p>And, but she&rsquo;s far wiser than I thought.</p>
<p>But, so they did this great machine learning analysis,</p>
<p>and I may get these numbers backwards,</p>
<p>but I think for every 5% reduction in REM sleep,</p>
<p>there was a 13% associated increased risk of mortality.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And I could have, I&rsquo;ll have to go back and check.</p>
<p>But to me, and in the machine learning algorithm,</p>
<p>what they ultimately spat out was that</p>
<p>of all of the sleep stages,</p>
<p>REM sleep is the most predictive of your longevity,</p>
<p>of your lifespan.</p>
<p>So we often, I hear people saying,</p>
<p>how can I get more deep sleep?</p>
<p>Or they sometimes say, how can I get more dream sleep?</p>
<p>And my answer is a question.</p>
<p>Why do you want to get more of that?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, well, isn&rsquo;t that the good stuff?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say, well, actually all stages of sleep are, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like the exercise question.</p>
<p>And it took decades for people to understand</p>
<p>that moving around at, for about 150,</p>
<p>probably 180 minutes a week at doing endurance type work,</p>
<p>zone two cardio type work,</p>
<p>it is correlated with living longer, feeling better,</p>
<p>less diabetes, et cetera.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really no way around it.</p>
<p>I mean, you can ingest metformin until the cows come home.</p>
<p>You can take NMN, all of which I think have their place</p>
<p>in certain contexts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the work surrounding all those protocols.</p>
<p>But without getting proper amounts of movement,</p>
<p>meaning sufficient numbers of,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many 12 minute exercise regimes</p>
<p>you follow per week, you need that threshold level.</p>
<p>And it sounds like the same is true of REM sleep</p>
<p>and total amount of sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, you pay the piper somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah, the return on investment, I mean, to flip the coin,</p>
<p>the return on investment is astronomical.</p>
<p>You know, I think of sleep,</p>
<p>it is the tide that moves, you know,</p>
<p>that raises all of those health boats.</p>
<p>And the most fundamental layer of mental</p>
<p>and physical health.</p>
<p>Whenever people ask me, even though I&rsquo;m not a physician,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll ask me, what should I take or what should I do?</p>
<p>The first question is always, how&rsquo;s your sleep?</p>
<p>Meaning how well do you sleep every night</p>
<p>and how long you sleep?</p>
<p>I always recommend your book.</p>
<p>I always recommend your podcast.</p>
<p>You know, the podcast you&rsquo;ve been a guest on, et cetera.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe you&rsquo;ll even release your own podcast</p>
<p>at some point soon and keep,</p>
<p>because I do think people need to hear from you more often.</p>
<p>One thing, I don&rsquo;t want to return to the notion</p>
<p>of public health discourse too much,</p>
<p>but I do want to say one issue with books in general</p>
<p>is that they can be revised,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more or less a one and done kind of thing</p>
<p>until the next book comes out.</p>
<p>One thing that I like about the podcast format</p>
<p>is that updates can be provided regularly,</p>
<p>corrections and updates as new data come out.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a wonderful aspect to this format</p>
<p>and hopefully the format that you&rsquo;ll be embracing.</p>
<p>I think the world needs to hear more from you more often</p>
<p>about sleep and its various contours, not less.</p>
<p>And so I do have a question about drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>Not that we want to promote day drinking,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say that the one or two glasses of wine</p>
<p>or cocktail is consumed with lunch,</p>
<p>something that isn&rsquo;t traditionally done nowadays,</p>
<p>or in a late afternoon, happy hour type cocktail.</p>
<p>And then one is going to sleep seven or eight hours later.</p>
<p>Do you think that that will improve</p>
<p>or somehow mitigate the effects of alcohol?</p>
<p>Or if you have a drink,</p>
<p>are you basically screwed for the next 24 hours?</p>
<p>No, I think there&rsquo;s going to be a time window dependency.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know of anyone who&rsquo;s essentially done</p>
<p>what you and I would like,</p>
<p>which is the time separation dose dependent curve</p>
<p>where, okay, you drink at 10 a.m. then,</p>
<p>or 11, 12, one, two, three, four, five,</p>
<p>all the way up to 10 p.m.</p>
<p>And estimate what is the blast radius?</p>
<p>And is it linear or is it nonlinear?</p>
<p>Is it such that only when you drink in the last four hours,</p>
<p>do you just hit this exponential and it&rsquo;s bad, bad, bad?</p>
<p>Or is there some other curve that we could imagine?</p>
<p>There would be many possibilities.</p>
<p>But certainly what we know is that the less alcohol</p>
<p>and the less, and more specifically,</p>
<p>the metabolic byproducts, aldehydes and ketones,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the sort of the nefarious players here.</p>
<p>And not the ketones that people are all excited about,</p>
<p>the other ketones.</p>
<p>Yes, please don&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>The chemists know what we&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is not about ketogenesis.</p>
<p>This is not about ketogenesis.</p>
<p>There are ketone bodies that are released</p>
<p>after ingesting alcohol</p>
<p>that are not of the positive sort</p>
<p>that a ketogenic diet might promote.</p>
<p>Right, so I think in terms of that alcohol profile,</p>
<p>we certainly know that as you&rsquo;re heading</p>
<p>into the evening hours,</p>
<p>once again, timing and dose make the poison.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also important, once again,</p>
<p>from that public message standpoint, and thank you,</p>
<p>I think I am leaning into the podcast consideration arena</p>
<p>at some point, but I don&rsquo;t want to be puritanical here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a scientist,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not here to tell anyone how to live.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m trying to do is empower people</p>
<p>with some of the scientific literature regarding sleep,</p>
<p>and then you can make whatever informed choices</p>
<p>that you want.</p>
<p>Unlike you, it turns out I&rsquo;m not a big drinker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just because I&rsquo;ve never liked the taste.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m surprised that they haven&rsquo;t taken away</p>
<p>my British passport because I don&rsquo;t like lager or beer.</p>
<p>But I also want to say that life is to be lived</p>
<p>to a certain degree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about checks and balances.</p>
<p>So if I go out and I have an ice cream sundae,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not big on those either,</p>
<p>but sure, I know that my blood glucose</p>
<p>is not gonna be ideal for another 12 hours, maybe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the price you pay</p>
<p>for having some kind of relaxed, fun life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to look back on life and think,</p>
<p>gosh, I lived until I was 111,</p>
<p>and it was utterly miserable.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all about some kind of a balance.</p>
<p>And my job is not to tell people a prescription for life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to offer some scientific information.</p>
<p>Oh, I think you&rsquo;re doing a terrific job of that.</p>
<p>People are, I always say we have all these neural circuits,</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s working properly,</p>
<p>we all have a circuit that allows us</p>
<p>to skip over information or as we wish, right?</p>
<p>If the circuits between your brain</p>
<p>and your thumbs are working, you can slide right along,</p>
<p>you can drop to the next content, however you like.</p>
<p>I would like to ask about marijuana and CBD.</p>
<p>This is a discussion that I think five years ago</p>
<p>would have ventured into the realm of illegal,</p>
<p>but now in many places, not all,</p>
<p>medical marijuana is approved or is legal.</p>
<p>And certainly it&rsquo;s in widespread use.</p>
<p>Certainly not recommending people do it.</p>
<p>I have my own thoughts about marijuana, CBD.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate, I suppose,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t particularly like marijuana or CBD.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if I&rsquo;ve ever tried CBD.</p>
<p>First of all, does marijuana disrupt the depth of sleep,</p>
<p>the architecture of sleep?</p>
<p>And if so, as with alcohol and caffeine,</p>
<p>when you ingest it or when it&rsquo;s in your bloodstream,</p>
<p>relative to when you go to sleep,</p>
<p>does that play an important role?</p>
<p>So does marijuana disrupt sleep?</p>
<p>Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a pretty good amount of data on,</p>
<p>so we can break sort of cannabis down</p>
<p>into two of its key ingredients.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, and we&rsquo;ve got CBD.</p>
<p>And CBD is sort of the less,</p>
<p>what we think of as the non-psychoactive component.</p>
<p>In other words, when you take CBD, you don&rsquo;t get high.</p>
<p>If you take THC, you can get high.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the psychoactive part of the equation.</p>
<p>Are both considered sedatives in the technical sense?</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Neither of them have that class right now.</p>
<p>THC seems to speed up the time with which you fall asleep.</p>
<p>But again, if you look at the electrical brainwave signature</p>
<p>of your falling asleep with and without that THC,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be an ideal fit.</p>
<p>So you could argue it&rsquo;s non-natural,</p>
<p>but many people use THC for that fact</p>
<p>because they find it difficult to fall asleep.</p>
<p>And it can speed the onset of at least non-consciousness,</p>
<p>I guess is the best way of describing it.</p>
<p>But there are problems with THC and there are twofold.</p>
<p>The first is that it too, but through different mechanisms,</p>
<p>seems to block REM sleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why a lot of people, when they&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>will tell me, look, you know, I definitely,</p>
<p>I was dreaming, I don&rsquo;t remember, you know,</p>
<p>many of my dreams.</p>
<p>And then when they stop using THC,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say I was having, you know,</p>
<p>just crazy, crazy dreams.</p>
<p>And the reason is because there is a rebound mechanism</p>
<p>REM sleep is very clever and alcohol is the same way</p>
<p>in this sense, it&rsquo;s the same homeostatic mechanism.</p>
<p>Some people will tell me, look,</p>
<p>if I have a bit of a wild Friday night with some alcohol,</p>
<p>you know, maybe I&rsquo;ll sleep late into the next morning</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just have these really intense dreams.</p>
<p>So, and I thought I wasn&rsquo;t having any REM sleep.</p>
<p>Well, the way it works is that it&rsquo;s during</p>
<p>in the middle of the night, really,</p>
<p>when alcohol blocks your REM sleep and your brain is smart.</p>
<p>It understands how much REM sleep you should have had,</p>
<p>how much REM sleep you have not</p>
<p>because the alcohol has been in the system.</p>
<p>And finally, in those early morning hours,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re getting through to sort of, you know,</p>
<p>six, seven, 8 a.m.</p>
<p>All of a sudden your brain not only goes back</p>
<p>to having the same amount of REM it would have had,</p>
<p>it does that plus it tries to get back</p>
<p>all of the REM sleep that it&rsquo;s lost.</p>
<p>Does it get back all of the REM sleep?</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It never gets back all of the REM sleep, but it tries.</p>
<p>And so you have these really intense periods of REM sleep.</p>
<p>Hence, you have really intense, bizarre dreams.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happens also with THC.</p>
<p>You build up this pressure for REM sleep,</p>
<p>this debt for REM sleep.</p>
<p>Will you ever pay it back?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t seem as though you get back everything</p>
<p>that you lost, but will you get back some of it?</p>
<p>Yes, the brain will start to devour more</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been starved of REM sleep for so long.</p>
<p>But one of the bigger problems with THC</p>
<p>that we worry about is withdrawal dependency.</p>
<p>So as you start to use THC for sleep,</p>
<p>there can be a dependency tolerance.</p>
<p>So you start to need more to get the same sleep benefit.</p>
<p>And when you stop using,</p>
<p>you usually get a very severe rebound insomnia.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s so potent</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s typically part of the clinical withdrawal profile</p>
<p>from THC, from cannabis.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s anxiety withdrawal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ask anybody to change their behavior.</p>
<p>We just, as you said, we try and inform people</p>
<p>about what the science says</p>
<p>and let them make choices for themselves.</p>
<p>People who are regular pot smokers,</p>
<p>many will insist they&rsquo;re not addicted.</p>
<p>And maybe indeed they don&rsquo;t actually follow</p>
<p>the profile of classical addiction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing some do, some don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But if you ask them,</p>
<p>well, what if I took away all marijuana consumption</p>
<p>for, I don&rsquo;t know, two weeks?</p>
<p>That thought scares many of them.</p>
<p>And many of them will experience intense anxiety</p>
<p>without marijuana, which speaks to perhaps not addiction,</p>
<p>but a certain kind of dependency.</p>
<p>And again, I know many pot smokers,</p>
<p>some of whom have jobs that are quite high performing</p>
<p>and they manage.</p>
<p>Here in Berkeley, I don&rsquo;t know any of those.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, none of those, right.</p>
<p>What about CBD?</p>
<p>I mean, we hear so much about CBD.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a little concerned about the fact</p>
<p>that the analysis of a lot of CBD supplements out there</p>
<p>has confirmed that much like with melatonin,</p>
<p>the levels that are reported on the labels</p>
<p>in no way, shape or form match the levels</p>
<p>that are actually contained in the various supplements.</p>
<p>Sometimes the levels are much higher</p>
<p>than they&rsquo;re reported on the labels.</p>
<p>Other times it&rsquo;s much lower.</p>
<p>What does ingesting CBD do to the architecture</p>
<p>and quality of sleep?</p>
<p>Right now, I don&rsquo;t think we have enough data</p>
<p>to make some kind of meaningful sense out of it.</p>
<p>I think the picture that is emerging, however,</p>
<p>is probably the following.</p>
<p>Firstly, CBD does not seem to be detrimental</p>
<p>in the same ways that THC is.</p>
<p>So we can start by saying, does it create</p>
<p>potential problems?</p>
<p>Not of the nature necessarily that we see with THC,</p>
<p>but the devil is a little bit in the details</p>
<p>from the data that we do have,</p>
<p>and it comes onto your valid point of purity.</p>
<p>At low dose, CBD can seem to be wake-promoting.</p>
<p>So in lower doses, let&rsquo;s say sort of five or 10 milligrams,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember some of the studies</p>
<p>off the top of my head.</p>
<p>There, it actually may enhance wakefulness</p>
<p>and cause problems with sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only once you get into the higher dose range</p>
<p>that there seem to have been some increases in sleepiness</p>
<p>or sort of sedation-like increases.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s usually, I think, above about 25 milligrams,</p>
<p>as best I can recall from the data.</p>
<p>And then when we look in animal models,</p>
<p>you typically see the same type of profile too.</p>
<p>So then the question becomes,</p>
<p>and now, again, you just don&rsquo;t know about purity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>Although I think, and again, I&rsquo;m not a user,</p>
<p>not necessarily because I have anything against it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s not necessarily my cup of tea.</p>
<p>There are some firms that are now doing</p>
<p>third-party independent laboratory tests.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how gamed that is, so I&rsquo;ve got no sense of it.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>I think some companies are quite honest and accurate</p>
<p>about the amounts of various substances</p>
<p>that are in other products and some are not.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s just a huge range.</p>
<p>I think the FDA is starting to explore CBD.</p>
<p>Certainly, I saw some grant announcements</p>
<p>to explore the function of CBD.</p>
<p>Most of the work on CBD is being done</p>
<p>by the general public, ingesting it</p>
<p>and seeing how they feel.</p>
<p>I gave it to my dog who had some dementia-related</p>
<p>sleep disturbances,</p>
<p>and it actually created a heightened wakefulness.</p>
<p>It completely screwed up his sleep.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bulldog, so if he&rsquo;s going to get access to sleep,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to take it.</p>
<p>Really messed him up, took it away.</p>
<p>He did better.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a canine, so-</p>
<p>Right, and it could have been dose-related too, but-</p>
<p>Or binders or other things that are in there.</p>
<p>Correct, yeah.</p>
<p>And we, but right now, if we were to,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not making this statement,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone could make the statement now,</p>
<p>but if it ends up being that CBD</p>
<p>is potentially beneficial for sleep,</p>
<p>how can we reconcile that mechanistically?</p>
<p>And I think there are, to me at least,</p>
<p>there are at least three candidate mechanisms</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been exploring and thinking about.</p>
<p>The first is that it&rsquo;s thermoregulatory.</p>
<p>And what we found in some animal models</p>
<p>is that CBD will create a profile of hypothermia.</p>
<p>In other words, it cools the body,</p>
<p>the core body temperature down,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something that we know is good for sleep.</p>
<p>The second is that it&rsquo;s an anxiolytic,</p>
<p>that it can reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>And that data is actually quite strong,</p>
<p>even with some functional imaging work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been coming out recently,</p>
<p>showing that one epicenter of emotion</p>
<p>called the amygdala deep within the brain</p>
<p>is quietened down with CBD.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s at least a second</p>
<p>non-mutually exclusive possibility.</p>
<p>I think the third is some recent data that&rsquo;s come out</p>
<p>that was suggesting that CBD</p>
<p>can alter the signaling of adenosine.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that you produce more adenosine,</p>
<p>but what it can do is perhaps modulate the sensitivity,</p>
<p>perhaps, of the brain</p>
<p>so that the weight of that same adenosine</p>
<p>is weightier in its brain signal,</p>
<p>and therefore it creates this stronger pressure for sleep.</p>
<p>So I think these are all tentative mechanisms.</p>
<p>I think any one of them is viable.</p>
<p>I think all three are viable together.</p>
<p>But right now, I think,</p>
<p>does that sort of help think through</p>
<p>the tapestry of THC and CBD?</p>
<p>Yeah, very much so.</p>
<p>And actually, it&rsquo;s a perfect segue from,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about caffeine, alcohol, THC, and CBD</p>
<p>as sort of, we&rsquo;ve framed them anyway</p>
<p>as things that, done in moderation at the appropriate times,</p>
<p>are probably okay for most people.</p>
<p>Certainly not for everybody.</p>
<p>There will be differences in sensitivity,</p>
<p>but that done at the incorrect times</p>
<p>and certainly in the incorrect amounts</p>
<p>will greatly disrupt this vital stage of life we call sleep.</p>
<p>CBD, it seems, represents a kind of bridge</p>
<p>to the topic I&rsquo;d like to talk about next,</p>
<p>which is things that promote more healthy sleep</p>
<p>or somehow contribute to enhancing the architecture</p>
<p>and quality of sleep.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love to chat for a moment</p>
<p>about the original, I should say,</p>
<p>not the granddaddy, but the OG of sleep supplementation,</p>
<p>which is melatonin, the so-called hormone of darkness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s inhibited by light, et cetera.</p>
<p>Frame for us melatonin</p>
<p>in the context of its naturally occurring form.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d like to talk about melatonin, the supplement,</p>
<p>because in my experience,</p>
<p>anytime I say the word melatonin,</p>
<p>people think about the supplement melatonin,</p>
<p>which in itself is an interesting phenomenon</p>
<p>that people are so cued to its role as something you take,</p>
<p>we often forget that this is something</p>
<p>that we make endogenously.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to comment in particular on,</p>
<p>even though we, without necessarily getting</p>
<p>into its precise nanograms per deciliter values,</p>
<p>what are the typical amounts of melatonin</p>
<p>that we release each night?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d like to compare that to what is contained</p>
<p>in say a three milligram or six milligram tablet</p>
<p>that one might buy at the pharmacy.</p>
<p>So I go to sleep at night,</p>
<p>has melatonin already kicked in before I shut my eyes</p>
<p>and lay down my head?</p>
<p>Usually, yes.</p>
<p>If your system is working in the correct way,</p>
<p>as dusk is starting to happen.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that you look at hunter gatherer tribes</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t touched by electricity.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s sort of the puritanical state par excellence</p>
<p>when it comes to electric light influence.</p>
<p>And usually it&rsquo;s as dusk is approaching,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when melatonin will start to rise.</p>
<p>And so when you lose the brake pedal of light</p>
<p>coming through the eyes,</p>
<p>that normally acts like a hard brake pedal</p>
<p>that stamps down and prevents the release</p>
<p>and production of melatonin.</p>
<p>As that light brake pedal starts to fade with dusk,</p>
<p>then we ease off the brake pedal and melatonin,</p>
<p>the spigot of melatonin is opened up</p>
<p>and melatonin starts getting released.</p>
<p>And usually we&rsquo;ll see this rising peak of melatonin</p>
<p>sometime, usually an hour, two hours later or around,</p>
<p>and it varies from different people,</p>
<p>around the time of sleep itself.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s already been on the march</p>
<p>for some hours before you actually hit sleep itself.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And I was always taught,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s still true</p>
<p>that the only source of melatonin in the brain and body</p>
<p>is the pineal gland.</p>
<p>Is that still true?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It seems to be from best that we can tell</p>
<p>the pineal gland sort of meaning P-like sort of shape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, I think usually people say it&rsquo;s P-like.</p>
<p>I think if you look at the Latin derivative,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more, I think it&rsquo;s derived from pine cone, not P,</p>
<p>because in fact, if you look at the pineal,</p>
<p>it is more pine cone shaped and so it&rsquo;s aptly named.</p>
<p>Any human brain I&rsquo;ve ever dissected,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dissected a lot because I teach neuroanatomy</p>
<p>and have for years, I love looking at the pineal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one structure in the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not on both sides.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually pretty easy to find.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty good size.</p>
<p>It looks like a P and it&rsquo;s sitting right there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s remarkable that it releases this hormone,</p>
<p>probably our entire lifespan and is inhibited by light.</p>
<p>So our pineal starts to release this</p>
<p>into the general circulation.</p>
<p>I have to imagine we have melatonin receptors</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>So yeah, essentially your brain has a central master</p>
<p>24 hour clock called the suprachiasmatic nucleus</p>
<p>that keeps internal time.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not a precise clock if left to its own devices,</p>
<p>nothing that a Swiss clockmaker would be proud of.</p>
<p>It runs a little bit long and laggy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an American clock.</p>
<p>So there are a couple of good American watches,</p>
<p>by the way, Hamilton&rsquo;s are very nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much like a book.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not famous for our timekeeping</p>
<p>or our punctuality for that matter.</p>
<p>But the Swiss are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s not quite Swiss.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s more Berkeley like, which is very relaxed.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>So in most adults, the average adults, I should say,</p>
<p>your biological clock normally runs a little bit long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 24 hours and 13 minutes,</p>
<p>I think was the last calculation.</p>
<p>But the reason that we don&rsquo;t keep drifting forward in time</p>
<p>and kind of running consistently, you know,</p>
<p>more and later and later,</p>
<p>30 minutes by 30 minutes by 30 minutes each day</p>
<p>is because your central brain clock</p>
<p>is regulated by external things such as daylight</p>
<p>and temperature, as well as food and activity.</p>
<p>All of these are essentially different fingers</p>
<p>that come along and on the wristwatch of the 24 hour clock</p>
<p>will pull the dial out and reset it each day</p>
<p>to precisely 24 hours.</p>
<p>And I make that point because it knows 24 hour time,</p>
<p>but it needs to tell the rest of the brain and the body</p>
<p>the 24 hour time as well.</p>
<p>And one of the ways that it does this</p>
<p>is by communicating a chemical signal of 24 hour nurse</p>
<p>of light and day using this hormone melatonin.</p>
<p>And when it is at low levels or it&rsquo;s non-existent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s communicating the message, it&rsquo;s daytime.</p>
<p>And for us diurnal species, it says it&rsquo;s time to be awake.</p>
<p>Yet at nighttime, when dusk approaches</p>
<p>and the break comes off melatonin</p>
<p>and we start to release it,</p>
<p>then it signals to the rest of the brain and the body,</p>
<p>look, it&rsquo;s dusk and it&rsquo;s nighttime.</p>
<p>And for us diurnal species, it&rsquo;s time to think about sleep.</p>
<p>So melatonin essentially tells the brain and the body</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s day and when it&rsquo;s night.</p>
<p>And with that, when it&rsquo;s time to sleep,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s time to wake,</p>
<p>and therefore that&rsquo;s why melatonin helps</p>
<p>with the timing of the onset of sleep,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t really help</p>
<p>with the generation of sleep itself.</p>
<p>And this is why we&rsquo;ll come on to what those studies</p>
<p>of supplementation have taught us.</p>
<p>So it tells the rest of my brain and body,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to go to sleep.</p>
<p>It perhaps even aids with the transition to sleep,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not going to, for instance,</p>
<p>ensure the overall structure of sleep</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s not the conductor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s guiding the sleep orchestra, so to speak,</p>
<p>throughout the entire night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like the people</p>
<p>that essentially take you to your seat</p>
<p>and sit you down and give you your program.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, sort of the far less sophisticated analogy I have is,</p>
<p>you know, melatonin is like the starting official</p>
<p>at the hundred meter race in the Olympics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a better analogy.</p>
<p>It calls all of the sleep races to the line</p>
<p>and it begins the great sleep race.</p>
<p>Yeah, better analogy, by the way,</p>
<p>coming from the sleep researcher of all people.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t participate in the race itself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole different set of brain chemicals</p>
<p>and brain regions,</p>
<p>which then brings us on to perhaps the question</p>
<p>of supplementation, which is,</p>
<p>is it helpful for my sleep?</p>
<p>Will I sleep longer?</p>
<p>Will I sleep better?</p>
<p>And if I am, what doses should I be taking?</p>
<p>Sadly, the evidence in healthy adults</p>
<p>who are not older age suggests</p>
<p>that melatonin is not really particularly helpful</p>
<p>as a sleep aid.</p>
<p>I think there was a recent meta-analysis</p>
<p>that demonstrated when it looked</p>
<p>at all of the different sleep parameters.</p>
<p>Melatonin, and a meta-analysis</p>
<p>for those not knowing what that is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a scientific sort of method that we use</p>
<p>where we gather all the individual studies</p>
<p>and we put them in a big bucket</p>
<p>and we kind of do this kind of statistical fancy</p>
<p>sleight of hand,</p>
<p>and we try to come up with a big picture</p>
<p>of what all of those individual studies tell us.</p>
<p>And what that meta-analysis told us</p>
<p>is that melatonin will only increase total amount</p>
<p>of sleep by 3.9 minutes on average.</p>
<p>Minutes?</p>
<p>Minutes.</p>
<p>Not even percent.</p>
<p>And it will only increase your sleep efficiency by 2.2%.</p>
<p>So it really-</p>
<p>This is as they say in certain parts of California,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weak sauce.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weak sauce effect.</p>
<p>The sauce is not strong.</p>
<p>The force is not strong in this one.</p>
<p>When it comes to a tool that in healthy people</p>
<p>who are not of older age,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be especially beneficial.</p>
<p>Now, you know, results can vary.</p>
<p>Everyone is different, of course.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about the average,</p>
<p>the so-called average human adult here.</p>
<p>Well, melatonin, in defense of what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>and also I should mention,</p>
<p>I have a colleague at Stanford,</p>
<p>Jamie Zeitzer.</p>
<p>Oh, wonderful.</p>
<p>Chuck Zeitzer&rsquo;s lab at Harvard Med,</p>
<p>where he also trained a terrific sleep researcher.</p>
<p>And I asked him about melatonin,</p>
<p>and he essentially said the same thing that you just said,</p>
<p>which is very little, if any evidence,</p>
<p>that it can improve sleep.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s probably the most commonly consumed</p>
<p>so-called sleep aid.</p>
<p>Hundreds of million dollars industry.</p>
<p>Yeah, so either massive placebo effect</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s operating through some other mechanism</p>
<p>related to quelling anxiety, perhaps.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is actually interesting.</p>
<p>There are some studies where you do see some effects.</p>
<p>Now, again, when you do the grand average of all studies,</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t seem to have an effect.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s assume that for some people,</p>
<p>it does have an effect.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not, again, be sort of completely dismissive of that.</p>
<p>How could it have that effect?</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I&rsquo;ve become a little bit more bullish</p>
<p>on melatonin from a sleep perspective,</p>
<p>and then melatonin more generally for a,</p>
<p>maybe we can speak about this too,</p>
<p>as a counter measure</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re undergoing insufficient sleep,</p>
<p>there are two different routes there.</p>
<p>The first reason that I think it could have a sleep benefit</p>
<p>for some people is not because it helps</p>
<p>in the generation of sleep.</p>
<p>We know that it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it too seems to drop core body temperature.</p>
<p>There it is, temperature again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated these days more and more by temperature</p>
<p>as maybe not just a reflection of brain state</p>
<p>and wakefulness and in sleep,</p>
<p>but actually a lever that is quite powerful.</p>
<p>And with all the interest in ice baths and hot showers</p>
<p>and saunas and stuff,</p>
<p>something that we will definitely touch on.</p>
<p>Temperature variation is so key.</p>
<p>So if melatonin is dropping body temperature</p>
<p>by a degree or so, something that you&rsquo;ve said before</p>
<p>can help induce a sleepy state,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s allowing people to get into sleep.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think melatonin by itself will drop it</p>
<p>by a degree, certainly not a degree Celsius.</p>
<p>And for order in us to fall asleep</p>
<p>and then stay asleep across the night,</p>
<p>we do need to drop our core body temperature</p>
<p>by about one degree Celsius</p>
<p>or about two to three degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s always easier to fall asleep</p>
<p>in a room that&rsquo;s too cold than too hot.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s one potential avenue</p>
<p>that we are considering thinking more deeply about</p>
<p>when it comes to melatonin.</p>
<p>And then the other is melatonin as an antioxidant.</p>
<p>But let me table that for now</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll just get us sidetracked.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we know so far about melatonin</p>
<p>in terms of its supplementation benefit or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Two final points that I shouldn&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>One is the only population</p>
<p>where we typically see some benefit</p>
<p>and it often is prescribed is in older adults.</p>
<p>Because as we-</p>
<p>Older meaning 60 and older?</p>
<p>Yeah, 60, 65 and older.</p>
<p>Because as we get older,</p>
<p>you can typically have what&rsquo;s called calcification</p>
<p>of the pineal gland,</p>
<p>which means that that gland that&rsquo;s releasing melatonin</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work as well anymore.</p>
<p>As a consequence, they tend to have a flatter overall curve</p>
<p>of melatonin released throughout the night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not this beautiful, lovely peak</p>
<p>and this bullhorn message of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s darkness, please get to sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why older adults can have problems</p>
<p>falling asleep or staying asleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only reason by any stretch of the imagination,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s why melatonin supplementation in those cohorts,</p>
<p>older adults, especially older adults with insomnia,</p>
<p>people have thought about that</p>
<p>as maybe an appropriate use case.</p>
<p>Well, along those lines,</p>
<p>if we were to compare dosages,</p>
<p>do we know how much melatonin is typically released</p>
<p>into the bloodstream per night?</p>
<p>And can we use that as a kind of a rule of thumb</p>
<p>by which to compare the typical amount</p>
<p>that someone would supplement?</p>
<p>I mean, typically the supplements for melatonin that I see</p>
<p>in the pharmacy and elsewhere and online</p>
<p>range anywhere from one milligram to 12</p>
<p>or even 20 milligrams.</p>
<p>My guess is that a normal night&rsquo;s release of melatonin,</p>
<p>typical for somebody in their 20s, 30s, 40s,</p>
<p>would be far lower than that.</p>
<p>Am I correct or wrong?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s many magnitudes lower.</p>
<p>And this is one of the problems is that I see that too.</p>
<p>I see typical doses are five milligrams or 10 milligrams.</p>
<p>And of course, if you&rsquo;re a supplement company,</p>
<p>putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re actually doing,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll speak about purity as well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like the super gulp size.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to lower price.</p>
<p>They just want you to, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just give you more for the same price</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll compete.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been this escalating arms race</p>
<p>of melatonin concentration.</p>
<p>And it really does not look meaningful</p>
<p>for sleep in any way.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve actually found is that the optimal doses</p>
<p>for where you do get sleep benefits</p>
<p>in the populations that we&rsquo;ve looked at</p>
<p>are somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3 milligrams of melatonin.</p>
<p>In other words, the typical doses</p>
<p>are usually 10 times, 20 times,</p>
<p>maybe more than what your body would naturally expect.</p>
<p>And this is what we call a supra physiological dose.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s far above</p>
<p>what is physiologically normal.</p>
<p>You know, and to put that in context,</p>
<p>imagine I said to you,</p>
<p>I want you to eat 20 times as much food today.</p>
<p>I thought you&rsquo;re going to use testosterone as example.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to take 300 times</p>
<p>the normal amount of testosterone.</p>
<p>We know that would have tons of deleterious effects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be terrible.</p>
<p>And yet you can do this.</p>
<p>One thing that I&rsquo;m concerned about</p>
<p>about these supra physiological levels of melatonin</p>
<p>is that many years ago,</p>
<p>actually here at Berkeley when I was a graduate student,</p>
<p>we would inject animals</p>
<p>which were seasonally breeding animals with melatonin.</p>
<p>And the consequence of that was that their gonads,</p>
<p>either their testes or ovaries</p>
<p>would shrink many hundredfold or more.</p>
<p>In other words, they would go from having</p>
<p>nice healthy sized hamster testicles,</p>
<p>what a hamster would consider healthy size for a hamster.</p>
<p>And they would shrink to the size of a grain of rice.</p>
<p>So from like an almonds to a grain size of a grain of rice.</p>
<p>I had to see that only once</p>
<p>for me to be very concerned</p>
<p>about supra physiological levels of melatonin.</p>
<p>And I realized that melatonin does different things</p>
<p>in different species.</p>
<p>We are not hamsters.</p>
<p>We are not seasonal breeders,</p>
<p>seasonally restricted breeders.</p>
<p>There might be more breeding during certain seasons.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know those data,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, hormones are powerful.</p>
<p>And sure there is an optimal.</p>
<p>And sometimes we see that going slightly</p>
<p>above endogenous levels for certain hormones,</p>
<p>not always can have beneficial effects.</p>
<p>And sometimes it can have detrimental effects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just concerned about taking high levels of a hormone</p>
<p>that has effects on the reproductive axis.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I get very concerned</p>
<p>when I see people really getting aggressive</p>
<p>about melatonin supplementation,</p>
<p>taking 110, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times</p>
<p>the amount that we would normally release.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my concern,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not nested in any one specific human study.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like to see,</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t want to see other people.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to personally take a hormone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s known to be androgen suppressive at high levels.</p>
<p>Why would I take that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question I ask myself.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very good point.</p>
<p>And if you look at some of the evidence around,</p>
<p>melatonin&rsquo;s lethality, if you want to go to that extreme,</p>
<p>for the most part, it&rsquo;s pretty safe.</p>
<p>You mean you can take a lot of it before you die.</p>
<p>Right, exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>But that should not be your yardstick for,</p>
<p>because you really need to think about your health,</p>
<p>not just whether this thing is going to kill you or not,</p>
<p>as the decision matrix through which you pop a pill.</p>
<p>And it comes on to this concern around melatonin,</p>
<p>because there was a study,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one that you mentioned too,</p>
<p>where they looked at over,</p>
<p>I think it was at least over 20 different brands</p>
<p>of melatonin supplements.</p>
<p>And what they found is that based on what it said</p>
<p>on the bottle versus what was in the capsules themselves,</p>
<p>it ranged from, I think it was 83% less</p>
<p>than what it said on the bottle,</p>
<p>to 478% more than what it said on the bottle.</p>
<p>Now, if that&rsquo;s a 10 milligram pill,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s 478% more than 10 milligrams,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re already at 10 milligrams</p>
<p>at many tens of times more than is a physiological,</p>
<p>rather than a supraphysiological dose,</p>
<p>we do need to be a bit thoughtful.</p>
<p>Yeah, remember those hamsters, folks.</p>
<p>Well, and I do appreciate the deep dive on melatonin,</p>
<p>because I think people need to understand</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s nuanced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of dosages and timing, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then it may have its place,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, in older individuals.</p>
<p>And I should mention that I&rsquo;m an avid consumer</p>
<p>of supplements that I believe in for me,</p>
<p>and I have been for a very long time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m by no means anti-supplement.</p>
<p>Some supplements I refuse to take or avoid taking,</p>
<p>others I quite avidly take.</p>
<p>And along those lines, I personally,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know what your thoughts on this are,</p>
<p>but there are a few things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve personally found beneficial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love your thoughts on them.</p>
<p>And I would love it if you would tell me</p>
<p>that everything I&rsquo;m about to refer to as placebo,</p>
<p>that would be fine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re scientists, we argue,</p>
<p>and then we remain friends as it goes.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>So magnesium.</p>
<p>There are many forms of magnesium.</p>
<p>Magnesium citrate, as we know, is a terrific laxative.</p>
<p>Magnesium malate seems, at least from a few studies,</p>
<p>seems to relieve some of delayed-onset muscle soreness,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to create a kind of sedation.</p>
<p>Two forms of magnesium that I&rsquo;m aware of,</p>
<p>magnesium biglycinate and magnesium threonate,</p>
<p>we believe, based on the data,</p>
<p>can more actively cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>So you put it in your gut,</p>
<p>but some of that needs to get into your brain</p>
<p>in order to have the sedative effect.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on magnesium supplementation?</p>
<p>Do you supplement with magnesium?</p>
<p>And what studies would you like to see done</p>
<p>if they haven&rsquo;t been done already?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t supplement with magnesium,</p>
<p>but I do think threonate is interesting</p>
<p>because of that higher capacity</p>
<p>to cross the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>and actually have a central nervous system effect.</p>
<p>And the reason that that interests me</p>
<p>is because the sleep is by the brain, of the brain,</p>
<p>and also for the brain, as well as for the body.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t have a particularly good set of studies</p>
<p>that have targeted exclusively threonate.</p>
<p>We do have lots of studies</p>
<p>that have just looked at magnesium in general for sleep.</p>
<p>And overall, the data is uncompelling.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And for a while, I was confused as to why,</p>
<p>where did this come from, this kind of myth of magnesium?</p>
<p>So I started looking back into the literature</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve best traced it, at least as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>to early studies showing that those</p>
<p>who were deficient in magnesium also had sleep problems.</p>
<p>They had other problems too, of course,</p>
<p>but sleep problems were one of that set of sequalae</p>
<p>that came from having lower magnesium.</p>
<p>And when they supplemented with magnesium</p>
<p>and tried to restore those levels,</p>
<p>some of those sleep problems dissipated.</p>
<p>And then that seems to have gotten lost</p>
<p>in sort of some game of sort of like whispers</p>
<p>around the room, and it&rsquo;s become translated</p>
<p>into people who don&rsquo;t have sleep problems,</p>
<p>who are healthy sleepers and who are healthy in general,</p>
<p>and who have healthy normal levels of magnesium,</p>
<p>if they take more magnesium, they will sleep better.</p>
<p>And the data really there is not good.</p>
<p>Once again, the only study that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>where magnesium did have some efficacy</p>
<p>was in a study with older adults.</p>
<p>I think they were 60 to 80 years old.</p>
<p>It may have been exclusively women, now I think about it.</p>
<p>And they also had insomnia.</p>
<p>And in that population, you did see some benefits.</p>
<p>And my guess is that because it&rsquo;s an older community,</p>
<p>they were probably deficient in magnesium.</p>
<p>So they fit the former category of simply</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re deficient and you restore,</p>
<p>you can help sleep sort of return to normal.</p>
<p>But if you are not deficient and you&rsquo;re healthy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not old and you don&rsquo;t have insomnia,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re supplementing thinking that it provides sleep,</p>
<p>right now, the data isn&rsquo;t supportive of that.</p>
<p>But I just don&rsquo;t think we have enough three and eight data</p>
<p>to actually speak about that</p>
<p>because it could just be a blood brain barrier issue</p>
<p>so far with the other forms.</p>
<p>So maybe some additional studies looking specifically</p>
<p>at three and eight or biglycinate would be useful.</p>
<p>And magnesium is involved in so many cellular processes.</p>
<p>You can imagine that this effect, if it truly exists,</p>
<p>is, as we say in science, in the noise,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s in the jitter of the data,</p>
<p>but to isolate the real effect,</p>
<p>one needs to do some more refined studies.</p>
<p>What are some things that are of interest to you,</p>
<p>if not things that you happen to take?</p>
<p>These are not things that I personally take,</p>
<p>mostly because I just haven&rsquo;t experimented with them.</p>
<p>Valerian root is one.</p>
<p>Tart cherry and kiwi fruit.</p>
<p>Tell me about Valerian root, tart cherry, and kiwi fruit.</p>
<p>This is new to me.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve certainly heard of them</p>
<p>and tart cherry and kiwi sounds delicious.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s happening with Valerian root,</p>
<p>tart cherry, and kiwi,</p>
<p>and are we talking about eating tart cherries and kiwis</p>
<p>and Valerian roots?</p>
<p>Or are we talking about taking them in pill form?</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s supplements,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also both for tart cherries and for kiwis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the actual fruit themselves.</p>
<p>Valerian often touted as a beneficial sleep aid,</p>
<p>and lots of people swear by it too,</p>
<p>but the evidence is actually quite against that.</p>
<p>Not that it makes your sleep worse,</p>
<p>but of at least the seven good studies</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been able to find,</p>
<p>and typically these are of the nature</p>
<p>of what we call a randomized placebo crossover design.</p>
<p>And I won&rsquo;t bore people with what that means.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of one of the-</p>
<p>Good study, solid study.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s one of the sort of gold standard methods</p>
<p>that we have when we&rsquo;re looking at intervention studies,</p>
<p>such as drug studies.</p>
<p>Five of the seven found no benefit</p>
<p>of Valerian root on sleep.</p>
<p>Then two out of the seven,</p>
<p>the data was just insufficient.</p>
<p>I think it was a power issue</p>
<p>where they just couldn&rsquo;t make any strong conclusions.</p>
<p>And then I think there was the most recent study,</p>
<p>I think looked at two different doses of Valerian.</p>
<p>I could have this wrong,</p>
<p>and they just failed to find any effects once again.</p>
<p>But the stunning part of that paper, as I recall,</p>
<p>they had this big table</p>
<p>with all of the different sleep metrics that they looked at,</p>
<p>and there were well over 25 different things</p>
<p>that they tried to see if Valerian impacted,</p>
<p>and none of them were significant,</p>
<p>which stuns me because from statistical probabilities,</p>
<p>we know if you just randomly perform 25 statistical tests,</p>
<p>chances are probabilistically,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll just get one significant result by random chance.</p>
<p>And even with random chance on their side,</p>
<p>they still couldn&rsquo;t find a benefit of Valerian.</p>
<p>So Valerian root might be worse than nothing at all,</p>
<p>if there is, so to speak.</p>
<p>I mean, again, placebo effect,</p>
<p>we can think about that too.</p>
<p>And I would say that if you feel as though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s having a benefit for you,</p>
<p>and with all of the caveats that we have with supplements,</p>
<p>things like melatonin, purity, concentration, et cetera,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s no harm, no foul,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not a medical doctor,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t tell anyone about,</p>
<p>we have all of these disclaimers</p>
<p>about not recommending such things.</p>
<p>I mean, I always say, we&rsquo;re not physicians,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t prescribe anything,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re scientists and professors, so we profess things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to people to be responsible for their own health,</p>
<p>not just to protect us, but to protect themselves.</p>
<p>I do wanna hear about tart cherry and kiwi fruit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story there?</p>
<p>Strange, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I was, you know, I&rsquo;m kind of a hard-nosed scientist,</p>
<p>and when people, you know, some years ago started saying,</p>
<p>oh, tart cherries, it&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>or kiwi fruits, I was thinking,</p>
<p>oh my goodness, this sounds a bit-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been in California a little too long.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, yeah, the sun has softened me some.</p>
<p>But I thought, look,</p>
<p>one of the things that we have to do as scientists</p>
<p>is be as open-minded as possible,</p>
<p>and I should not be so quick to dismiss.</p>
<p>So I went to the literature,</p>
<p>just started reading as much as I could about it,</p>
<p>and there were three really good randomized</p>
<p>placebo crossover trials with tart cherries.</p>
<p>And what they found was that in one study,</p>
<p>it reduced the amount of time</p>
<p>that you spent awake at night by over an hour,</p>
<p>and then the other two studies,</p>
<p>one of them found that it increased</p>
<p>the amount of sleep that you got by 34 minutes,</p>
<p>the other, it increased the amount of sleep</p>
<p>that you got by 84 minutes, which, you know, these are,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s striking is that they were independent studies,</p>
<p>I think, meaning that they were from independent groups.</p>
<p>And these were, you know, some of these guys,</p>
<p>you know, I and girls, I know pretty well.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re really-</p>
<p>You know and trust their work.</p>
<p>Right, I really trust their work, too.</p>
<p>Were they ingesting actual tart cherries?</p>
<p>Are they drinking the juice or in capsule form?</p>
<p>It was juice.</p>
<p>So they, in all three studies, it was juice.</p>
<p>Although you can, I think, as a supplement,</p>
<p>you can buy it in a capsule,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got no idea whether</p>
<p>that changes the benefit or not.</p>
<p>What was also interesting in,</p>
<p>I think it was that last study</p>
<p>where they got an increase in sleep by 84 minutes,</p>
<p>it also decreased daytime napping significantly.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s one that I could certainly make use of.</p>
<p>I love my daytime naps, but I&rsquo;d love to skip them, too.</p>
<p>Right, and we can speak about naps</p>
<p>and sort of the upside and downside of that,</p>
<p>which then made me think, well, if that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>maybe the net net benefit on sleep overall is no different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that it decreases the amount of time</p>
<p>that some people were taking to sleep during the day</p>
<p>and giving it back to the night.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the case,</p>
<p>because if you added the total amount of sleep</p>
<p>that they were getting without tart cherries,</p>
<p>both naps and nightly sleep combined,</p>
<p>still, when you took tart cherries,</p>
<p>you still got a net sum benefit of total amount of sleep.</p>
<p>So, you know, so far, when it comes to supplements</p>
<p>and those types of studies, they&rsquo;re good studies,</p>
<p>and the data looks interesting.</p>
<p>But as a drug itself, you know, if this was clinical drug,</p>
<p>you know, three studies that are somewhat small in nature</p>
<p>and have some positive benefit,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we would call preliminary data</p>
<p>of maybe a chin-scratching kind.</p>
<p>So keep this in context.</p>
<p>Yeah, and depending on the margins for safety,</p>
<p>one might think, well, given that it&rsquo;s a tart cherry</p>
<p>as opposed to some pharmaceutical you need a prescription</p>
<p>for, then, you know, some people,</p>
<p>their threshold to experiment with supplements is quite low.</p>
<p>Some people, their threshold is quite high.</p>
<p>I feel like, you know, there are two categories,</p>
<p>or at least two categories of folks out there,</p>
<p>people who hear, oh, tart cherry can improve sleep</p>
<p>and will run out and try it,</p>
<p>and people who hear, well, that sounds crazy,</p>
<p>why would I do that?</p>
<p>But of course, we have to remind people that tart cherry</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t really what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>presumably, if this is a real effect,</p>
<p>and it sounds like it might be,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a compound in tart cherry.</p>
<p>That if we were to call it whatever, whatever,</p>
<p>five alpha, six, you know, some molecule,</p>
<p>if we referred to it by its technical name,</p>
<p>then people would say, oh, that sounds like</p>
<p>a very interesting technical way to approach sleep,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t sound very natural.</p>
<p>So both groups are a little bit misguided</p>
<p>in the sense that people who think that everything</p>
<p>that comes from naturally occurring foods, plants, et cetera,</p>
<p>things that grow out of the ground,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s all safe, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>And people that think that pharmaceuticals are the only,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not evidence with the purified molecule,</p>
<p>then something&rsquo;s not of utility.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s certainly not true.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the middle, I think, lies the answer,</p>
<p>which is, it sounds to me like tart cherry</p>
<p>is at least an intriguing potential sleep aid,</p>
<p>intriguing potential sleep aid,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m underscoring potential.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly intrigued by it to the point</p>
<p>where I might experiment a bit,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m an experimenter for myself.</p>
<p>Before I ask you about kiwi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had quite good results</p>
<p>from taking something called apigenin,</p>
<p>which is a derivative of chamomile,</p>
<p>but in supplement form, I think I take 50 milligrams,</p>
<p>about 30 minutes before sleep,</p>
<p>and I subjectively experience a better night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>I confess, I don&rsquo;t measure my sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a sleep tracker guy.</p>
<p>But there are a few papers out there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not what we would call</p>
<p>published in blue ribbon journals,</p>
<p>but they have control groups,</p>
<p>and it looks somewhat interesting.</p>
<p>And there, when I say apigenin,</p>
<p>people get somewhat intrigued.</p>
<p>Oh, this molecule, chamomile,</p>
<p>has long been thought to be a sedative,</p>
<p>a mild sedative, but a sedative.</p>
<p>Do you drink chamomile tea?</p>
<p>Do you take apigenin?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on apigenin?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t, and I have looked into</p>
<p>some of the data regarding sleep as well.</p>
<p>Right now, from best I can tell,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mostly subjective data</p>
<p>rather than objective, hard sleep measures,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why right now,</p>
<p>I sort of unclear, not no comment,</p>
<p>but just unclear, not dismissing it,</p>
<p>because I think you and I both ascribe</p>
<p>to the idea of absence of evidence</p>
<p>is not evidence of absence.</p>
<p>So keep your mind open,</p>
<p>at least I tell that to myself.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re finding a benefit</p>
<p>and you can do what I would think of</p>
<p>if I was personally experimenting,</p>
<p>which is both the positive and negative</p>
<p>parts of the experiment,</p>
<p>what I mean by that is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that I now want to think about</p>
<p>some kind of a sleep supplement.</p>
<p>I will take some kind of baseline</p>
<p>set of recordings for a month,</p>
<p>and I will just gauge where I&rsquo;m at,</p>
<p>sort of supplement-free.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll go on for a month</p>
<p>to whatever I&rsquo;m thinking of taking,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t supplement,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say that I want to</p>
<p>and I experiment with that,</p>
<p>and I feel as though, based on my metrics,</p>
<p>be them objective from my Oura Ring</p>
<p>or be them subjective from whatever</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing down in the morning,</p>
<p>and both are important and valid,</p>
<p>subjective and objective.</p>
<p>We like both in the sleep world.</p>
<p>And I think, okay, look,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clearly that it seems to have</p>
<p>some kind of an effect.</p>
<p>The key thing, however,</p>
<p>is then do the negative experiment,</p>
<p>which is now come off it for another month</p>
<p>and see, do things get worse?</p>
<p>And if I can see that bi-directionality,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m starting to think,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m believing this a little bit more.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way I would typically approach</p>
<p>a supplementation regimen if I were to do it,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way my mind works.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very scientific and organized</p>
<p>in a way that allows you</p>
<p>and would allow other people</p>
<p>to make very informed decisions for themselves.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I like to think, in terms of manipulating</p>
<p>any aspect of our biology,</p>
<p>that behavioral tools always are the first line of entry.</p>
<p>Then nutrition, everyone has to eat sooner or later,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re fasting.</p>
<p>Then perhaps supplementation,</p>
<p>then prescription drugs,</p>
<p>and then perhaps brain-machine interface,</p>
<p>devices that you use to induce something.</p>
<p>And those could be done in combination.</p>
<p>But what concerns me is when I hear people say,</p>
<p>well, what should I take</p>
<p>without thinking about their behavior,</p>
<p>their light-viewing behavior, et cetera?</p>
<p>But of course, these things work in combination.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right that there&rsquo;s many,</p>
<p>when it comes to sleep,</p>
<p>there are many low-hanging fruits</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t necessarily require you</p>
<p>to put sort of exogenous molecules,</p>
<p>in other words, things like supplements,</p>
<p>into your body,</p>
<p>or use different types of drugs to help you get there.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to prescription sleep aids,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve been, again, a little bit too forthright.</p>
<p>We know in clinical practice</p>
<p>that there may be a time and a place</p>
<p>for things like sleeping pills.</p>
<p>They are a short-term solution</p>
<p>to certain forms of insomnia,</p>
<p>but they are not recommended for the long-term.</p>
<p>And we also know that there are lots of other ways</p>
<p>that you can get a sleep help,</p>
<p>or you can get a sleep curative profile</p>
<p>from things like cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia,</p>
<p>which is a non-drug approach, a psychological one.</p>
<p>And quite effective, from what I understand.</p>
<p>Just as effective as sleeping pills, great data,</p>
<p>more effective in the long-term.</p>
<p>There was a recent study published</p>
<p>that after working with that therapist,</p>
<p>some of the benefits lasted almost a decade.</p>
<p>Now, if you stop sleeping pills,</p>
<p>usually you have rebound insomnia,</p>
<p>where your sleep goes back to being just as bad,</p>
<p>if not worse.</p>
<p>And I think the same is true</p>
<p>when we think about supplementation.</p>
<p>There are so many things that are easy to implement</p>
<p>when it comes to sleep</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t require venturing out into those waters.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re not here to tell anyone</p>
<p>about whether they should venture or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s completely your choice.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is that if you want to think</p>
<p>about optimizing your sleep,</p>
<p>there are a number of ways that you can do it</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t necessarily require you to swallow anything</p>
<p>or inject anything or smoke anything or freebase.</p>
<p>And for which the margins of safety are quite wide.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other one.</p>
<p>Yes, sorry, thank you.</p>
<p>So speaking of low-hanging fruit,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how low it hangs in reality,</p>
<p>but what about kiwi?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re delicious to me anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, the humble kiwi fruit, named not,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be mistaken for the flightless bird of New Zealand</p>
<p>which is the native bird.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about the kiwi, the fruit here,</p>
<p>which those trees and shrubs are mostly Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Kiwi fruits have been previously touted</p>
<p>as potentially having a sleep benefit,</p>
<p>which again got me curious.</p>
<p>And I at first threw it out.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there&rsquo;s really only one</p>
<p>published human study that&rsquo;s of any value.</p>
<p>But what they did find was that</p>
<p>it decreased the speed of time</p>
<p>with which it took you to fall asleep.</p>
<p>These are people ingesting the whole kiwi?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s ingesting the whole kiwi.</p>
<p>With the skin?</p>
<p>Skin, no.</p>
<p>The skin, people cringe when they see me do it,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t eat the skin.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I think the idea is some of the good stuff,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll come onto this,</p>
<p>may actually be in the skin itself.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You just helped me win a bet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you your time.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can pay me later.</p>
<p>By the way, this skin is used.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>He just told me to say that,</p>
<p>so he went, no, he did not.</p>
<p>So the skin seems to be part of</p>
<p>this potential sleep equation.</p>
<p>And that study, yeah,</p>
<p>you fell asleep faster,</p>
<p>and you stayed asleep for longer,</p>
<p>and you spent less time awake throughout the night.</p>
<p>And I just thought, well, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one study.</p>
<p>What can you really do with that?</p>
<p>There is another study, however,</p>
<p>in an animal model,</p>
<p>which is, you know, a little bit more interesting.</p>
<p>And once again, they found a very similar phenotype</p>
<p>that the rats, sorry, they were mice.</p>
<p>The mice fell asleep faster,</p>
<p>and they also spent longer time in sleep.</p>
<p>The sleep duration also increased.</p>
<p>What was also interesting mechanistically,</p>
<p>and this is not the mechanism</p>
<p>that I think ties together tart cherries,</p>
<p>kiwi fruit, and, you know, things like melatonin,</p>
<p>because I think there could be</p>
<p>one common binding mechanism.</p>
<p>What they found in the animal study</p>
<p>is that they could block those kiwi fruit sleep benefits</p>
<p>using a GABA blocking agent.</p>
<p>Now, GABA, which stands for gamma-aminobutyric acid,</p>
<p>is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters</p>
<p>of the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the red-</p>
<p>So a naturally occurring sedative, sort of.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the kind of the red light</p>
<p>on the traffic light signal, you know.</p>
<p>Others are green light.</p>
<p>GABA is red light.</p>
<p>So by playing around with some sort of clever drugs</p>
<p>to manipulate the system,</p>
<p>they could prevent the benefit of the kiwi fruit</p>
<p>by sort of buggering around with the GABA receptor,</p>
<p>meaning that perhaps part of the kiwi fruit benefit</p>
<p>on sleep was mediated by the brain&rsquo;s natural</p>
<p>inhibitory neurotransmitter system</p>
<p>called the GABA system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>And I thought that that was kind of,</p>
<p>that convinced me a little bit more</p>
<p>that maybe there&rsquo;s something here to read into.</p>
<p>So to be determined, again, here is the banner.</p>
<p>But tart cherries and kiwi fruits, the data surprised me</p>
<p>because in part, I was so preoccupied with being,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, a bit pure-ish about it and a bit snobby,</p>
<p>thinking, oh, come on, that&rsquo;s definitely not going to work.</p>
<p>Well, the data so far-</p>
<p>Compounds are compounds.</p>
<p>I look forward to a day when supplements</p>
<p>are no longer called supplements</p>
<p>because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>whether or not something has an effect,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a whole kiwi fruit</p>
<p>or a derivative of a kiwi fruit,</p>
<p>will depend on the molecular compound.</p>
<p>And as you mentioned this potential mechanism</p>
<p>via the GABA system,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, we both as scientists get excited about mechanism</p>
<p>because when you can trace a mechanism in a pathway,</p>
<p>it provides a rationale, a grounding</p>
<p>for why kiwi of all things or tart cherry of all things</p>
<p>might help increase total sleep time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>or ask about tryptophan and serotonin.</p>
<p>I can anecdotally say when I&rsquo;ve taken tryptophan,</p>
<p>the precursor to serotonin, or serotonin itself,</p>
<p>I have a horrendous night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>I fall asleep very easily</p>
<p>and I experience ridiculously vivid dreams,</p>
<p>neither pleasant nor unpleasant, it&rsquo;s kind of a mishmash.</p>
<p>And then I wake up and I experience several days</p>
<p>of insomnia that, and I&rsquo;ve done the positive control</p>
<p>and the negative control and all the variations thereof</p>
<p>to confirm that at least for me,</p>
<p>supplementing with serotonergic agents is a bad idea for me.</p>
<p>And tryptophan is a common sleep supplement</p>
<p>and sleep aid that&rsquo;s discussed.</p>
<p>The normal architecture of sleep</p>
<p>involves the release of serotonin,</p>
<p>but in a very timed and regulated way.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about serotonin in sleep,</p>
<p>if you had to kind of put that into a nutshell,</p>
<p>and then why supplementing with serotonin</p>
<p>and or its precursor, tryptophan,</p>
<p>might be a good or a bad idea for somebody?</p>
<p>I think one of the potential dangers</p>
<p>is that based on what&rsquo;s going on in your body,</p>
<p>that can change the absorption of natural</p>
<p>sort of tryptophan and serotonin uptake</p>
<p>within the brain itself.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m always thoughtful when you&rsquo;re playing around</p>
<p>with that mother nature dynamic, as it were.</p>
<p>The data, as you described,</p>
<p>is a little bit all over the map.</p>
<p>Some people say that it knocks them out.</p>
<p>Other people say, just like you do,</p>
<p>it has a terrible impact on my sleep.</p>
<p>And when I stop, it&rsquo;s pretty bad for a couple of days.</p>
<p>It seems to have this lingering after effect.</p>
<p>I think what could be happening here</p>
<p>is we need serotonin to, just as you described,</p>
<p>be modulated in very specific ways</p>
<p>during the different stages of sleep.</p>
<p>If you look at the firing of the brain epicenters</p>
<p>where serotonin is released,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a bunch of them in the brainstem,</p>
<p>what you find, and the release of serotonin too,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re awake, it&rsquo;s usually in high concentrations.</p>
<p>As we start to drift off to sleep, it lowers some,</p>
<p>but not necessarily dramatically</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re going into non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>But then when we go into REM sleep, serotonin is shut off.</p>
<p>One of the other neuromodulators, noradrenaline,</p>
<p>also shut off.</p>
<p>REM sleep is the only time during the 24-hour period</p>
<p>where we see noradrenaline and serotonin,</p>
<p>or norepinephrine, completely shut down.</p>
<p>When I say serotonin, we&rsquo;re also talking 5-HTP,</p>
<p>sorry, 5-HT, that&rsquo;s just its chemical name here.</p>
<p>So whether it, speaking about serotonin or 5-HT,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same thing, norepinephrine, noradrenaline,</p>
<p>both of those need to be shut down</p>
<p>for you to produce REM sleep.</p>
<p>The other, one of the other neuromodulators</p>
<p>that then ramps up to produce REM sleep is acetylcholine.</p>
<p>So these three neuromodulators</p>
<p>have this incredible reciprocal dance</p>
<p>that they have for you to generate</p>
<p>what is called a natural architecture</p>
<p>of sleep throughout the night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the push-pull again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a push-pull again.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s chest and back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, whatever you want to think of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think if you&rsquo;re trying to increase,</p>
<p>dramatically drive up your serotonin levels at night,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s sustained throughout the night,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to get into REM sleep,</p>
<p>you could be artificially fragmenting REM sleep.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know the data.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s really got the data,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why I would be, you know,</p>
<p>if you were to say, Matt, two years time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the data.</p>
<p>Help me understand the potential mechanism,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s design some experiments.</p>
<p>Where would you go first?</p>
<p>I would say, let&rsquo;s look at the disruption of REM sleep,</p>
<p>non-REM sleep, reciprocal regulation,</p>
<p>because, you know, you need serotonin to be,</p>
<p>you know, up at one time, down at another, so.</p>
<p>I agree with everything you said,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m personally never taking tryptophan or serotonin</p>
<p>again, unless there&rsquo;s some clinical reason for that,</p>
<p>that I would need to do that.</p>
<p>I want to ask about some other pro-sleep behaviors,</p>
<p>but before I do that, let&rsquo;s talk about naps.</p>
<p>I love naps.</p>
<p>I come from a long history of nappers.</p>
<p>My dad always took a nap in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I take a 20 or 30 minute nap,</p>
<p>or I do a practice, which I took the liberty of coining</p>
<p>NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>some sort of just passive laying out there,</p>
<p>feet up, elevated.</p>
<p>Sometimes people do, or I&rsquo;ll do yoga nidra,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do hypnosis or something of that sort.</p>
<p>But 20 or 30 minutes of that has been very beneficial</p>
<p>for me to get up from that nap,</p>
<p>or period of minimal wakefulness, we&rsquo;ll call it,</p>
<p>and go about my day quite well,</p>
<p>and also fall asleep just fine.</p>
<p>What are the data on naps?</p>
<p>Do you nap?</p>
<p>And what are your thoughts about keeping naps short,</p>
<p>meaning 20 to 30 minutes,</p>
<p>versus getting out past 90 minutes, two hours?</p>
<p>So for you personally, naps, yay, nay, or meh?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t nap, and I&rsquo;ve just never been a habitual napper.</p>
<p>Is that because you don&rsquo;t feel sleepy in the afternoon,</p>
<p>or because-</p>
<p>I typically don&rsquo;t feel sleepy.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just hardier than that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say hardier,</p>
<p>I may be less capable of falling asleep.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not dragging through the afternoon.</p>
<p>No, no, I don&rsquo;t drag through.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t nap because you don&rsquo;t feel a need to nap.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, yeah.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not that I am immune</p>
<p>to what we call the postprandial dip in alertness.</p>
<p>I definitely feel as though there can be</p>
<p>this kind of afternoon lull,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m not quite as on as I was</p>
<p>at 11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>And we know the physiology to that,</p>
<p>which brings us back to whether we were designed to nap.</p>
<p>So for naps, we&rsquo;ve done lots of different studies,</p>
<p>and other colleagues have done these studies too.</p>
<p>Naps can have some really great benefits.</p>
<p>We found benefits for cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>blood pressure, for example.</p>
<p>We found benefits for levels of cortisol.</p>
<p>We found benefits for learning and memory,</p>
<p>and also emotional regulation.</p>
<p>How long are the naps typically in those studies?</p>
<p>Anywhere between 20 minutes to 90 minutes.</p>
<p>Sometimes we like to use a 90 minute window</p>
<p>so that the participant can have a full cycle of sleep,</p>
<p>and therefore they get both non-REM and REM sleep</p>
<p>within that time period.</p>
<p>Then when we wake them up,</p>
<p>we usually wait a period of time</p>
<p>to get them past what we call sleep inertia,</p>
<p>which is that kind of window of grogginess</p>
<p>where you say to your better half,</p>
<p>look, darling, please don&rsquo;t speak to me</p>
<p>for the first hour after I&rsquo;ve-</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t anything right now.</p>
<p>After the first hour of waking up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not the best version of myself.</p>
<p>So we wait for that time period,</p>
<p>and then we do some testing,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve done some testing before and after,</p>
<p>and we look at the change,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how we measure what was the benefit of naps.</p>
<p>And the reason why we sometimes do 90 minutes</p>
<p>so that they get all of those stages of sleep,</p>
<p>and then we correlate how much benefit</p>
<p>did you get from the nap,</p>
<p>and how much of that benefit was explained</p>
<p>by what REM sleep you got,</p>
<p>what deep sleep you got,</p>
<p>what light sleep you got.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the only reason that we use that</p>
<p>as an experimental tool.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve also found is that naps</p>
<p>of as little as 17 minutes</p>
<p>can have some quite potent effects on,</p>
<p>for example, learning.</p>
<p>None of this is novel.</p>
<p>NASA pioneered this back in the 1990s.</p>
<p>And during the missions,</p>
<p>they were experimenting with naps for their astronauts.</p>
<p>And what they found was that naps of little as 26 minutes</p>
<p>improved mission performance by 34%,</p>
<p>and improved daytime alertness by 50%.</p>
<p>And it birthed what was then called the NASA nap culture</p>
<p>throughout all terrestrial NASA staff</p>
<p>during that time period.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s long been known that naps can have a benefit.</p>
<p>Naps, however, can have a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>There is a dark side to naps.</p>
<p>And it comes back to our story</p>
<p>of adenosine and sleep pressure.</p>
<p>The longer we&rsquo;re awake,</p>
<p>the more of that sleep pressure adenosine that we build up.</p>
<p>But what I didn&rsquo;t tell you is that when we sleep,</p>
<p>the brain gets the chance</p>
<p>to essentially clear out that adenosine.</p>
<p>And after about 16 hours of wakefulness,</p>
<p>and then after about eight hours of sleep,</p>
<p>eight hours of sleep seems to be able to allow the brain</p>
<p>to decrease its adenosine levels back to normal.</p>
<p>And so naturally, we should start to wake up,</p>
<p>which also aligns with your circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>And those are two separate processes.</p>
<p>But with about eight hours of good quality sleep,</p>
<p>seven to nine hours for the average adult,</p>
<p>we are free of all of that adenosine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve evacuated it essentially out of the brain,</p>
<p>and we wake up naturally feeling refreshed.</p>
<p>The reason that naps can be potentially dangerous</p>
<p>is that when you nap,</p>
<p>you are essentially opening the valve</p>
<p>on the pressure cooker of sleep pressure.</p>
<p>And some of that sleepiness is lost by way of the nap.</p>
<p>So for some people, and not all people,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a great example of this,</p>
<p>some people, however,</p>
<p>if they are struggling with sleep at night,</p>
<p>and they nap during the day,</p>
<p>it makes their sleep problems even worse.</p>
<p>So for people with insomnia,</p>
<p>we typically advise against napping.</p>
<p>And the advice is if you can nap regularly,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t struggle with sleep at night,</p>
<p>then naps are just fine.</p>
<p>But if you do struggle with sleep, stay away from naps.</p>
<p>If you are going to nap,</p>
<p>try to limit your naps,</p>
<p>try to cut them off a bit like sort of caffeine,</p>
<p>maybe, you know, eight to sort of 12 hours,</p>
<p>maybe not that, you know, far off,</p>
<p>maybe sort of seven to six hours is a good rule of thumb.</p>
<p>Try not to nap essentially late in the afternoon.</p>
<p>And if you do take a nap,</p>
<p>and you want to maintain your,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to have that grogginess hangover</p>
<p>that can happen after a full night of sleep</p>
<p>for the first hour,</p>
<p>try to limit it to about 20, 25 minutes.</p>
<p>And that way you don&rsquo;t go down</p>
<p>into the very deepest stages of sleep,</p>
<p>which if I wrench you out of with an alarm,</p>
<p>then you just kind of feel,</p>
<p>you almost feel worse for the first hour after the nap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve definitely experienced that if I oversleep.</p>
<p>Certainly if the sun goes down during my nap,</p>
<p>and I wake up and light overall,</p>
<p>lighting conditions have changed,</p>
<p>I find it very hard to jolt myself back into the evening,</p>
<p>and it can screw me up.</p>
<p>So I try and keep those naps pretty brief.</p>
<p>And I should say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy to hear you mention individual differences</p>
<p>and why some people might want to nap</p>
<p>and other people might not want to nap.</p>
<p>I have a colleague, Leachan Lowe,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll be familiar to many neurobiologists,</p>
<p>but who&rsquo;s a absolutely spectacular scientist,</p>
<p>member of the National Academy, Howard Hughes investigator,</p>
<p>just a phenom and has a ton of energy.</p>
<p>But years ago,</p>
<p>I learned that he always takes a nap in the afternoon,</p>
<p>so much so that when he travels to give seminars</p>
<p>at other universities,</p>
<p>he will tell his post-lunch host,</p>
<p>whoever it is that he&rsquo;s supposed to meet with,</p>
<p>may I have your office for 30 minutes</p>
<p>of our sometimes 30 minute discussion</p>
<p>or 60 minute discussion,</p>
<p>because I like to take a nap.</p>
<p>And he does that and then gives his,</p>
<p>his talks are typically in the afternoon</p>
<p>in academic culture.</p>
<p>And he describes the effect of the nap for him,</p>
<p>the short naps in the afternoon</p>
<p>being so profound for his productivity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what inspired me to start feeling okay</p>
<p>about my desire to nap.</p>
<p>And so I think for me,</p>
<p>that was great vindication for those that might feel guilty</p>
<p>about wanting a nap.</p>
<p>But I take to heart your note about avoiding naps</p>
<p>if you have trouble falling and staying asleep,</p>
<p>because I think that I have family members who also,</p>
<p>if they nap, they&rsquo;re a wreck, they can&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve often been very pro-sleep,</p>
<p>we as sort of the sleep community.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s good to always point out</p>
<p>these potential dark sides of any aspect,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>No one should feel guilty about getting the sleep</p>
<p>that they need.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s been one of the big problems in society.</p>
<p>Society has stigmatized sleep</p>
<p>with these labels of being slothful or lazy.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re almost embarrassed, you know,</p>
<p>to tell colleagues that we take a nap.</p>
<p>I think sleep is a right of human beings.</p>
<p>And I therefore think that sleep is a civil right</p>
<p>of all human beings.</p>
<p>And no one should make you feel unproud</p>
<p>of getting the sleep that you need.</p>
<p>No, I love that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an important point.</p>
<p>I also feel that one of the best ways</p>
<p>to beat your competition in any endeavor is to outlive them.</p>
<p>So now that we know that sleep can enhance longevity</p>
<p>and lack of sleep can shorten one&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all the justification I need anyway.</p>
<p>Can somebody sleep too much?</p>
<p>Is it possible to get too much sleep?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>And there are probably two things to say about it.</p>
<p>There is a condition that we call hypersomnia,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a mixture of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where people have either a very high sleep need</p>
<p>or they are very sleepy during the day</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re typically falling asleep.</p>
<p>And these can happen in a variety</p>
<p>of different clinical contexts.</p>
<p>One of the places where we&rsquo;ve often seen hypersomnia</p>
<p>believed to manifest is in depression.</p>
<p>But if you look at some of those studies,</p>
<p>it turns out it looks more as though those people</p>
<p>are simply reporting being in bed longer,</p>
<p>but not necessarily sleeping longer.</p>
<p>And that fits very well with one of the profiles</p>
<p>that we know of depression, which is anhedonia.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get pleasure from normally pleasurable things.</p>
<p>So you just don&rsquo;t want to go out into the world.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to interact because you&rsquo;re depressed.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>You just stay in bed.</p>
<p>And that-</p>
<p>Blinds closed, watching TV on the phone.</p>
<p>Right, and that just looks as though,</p>
<p>when people say, what time did you go to bed</p>
<p>and what time did you get out of bed?</p>
<p>The mistake made in that question is,</p>
<p>okay, that&rsquo;s how much time they&rsquo;re sleeping</p>
<p>when you should have said, what time did you fall asleep</p>
<p>and what time did you wake up?</p>
<p>And the answer could be very different.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s hypersomnia from a clinical context.</p>
<p>Can you sleep too much though?</p>
<p>One of the data points that argues, yes, that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>is when we look at all cause mortality.</p>
<p>Certainly what you find is that using the sweet spot</p>
<p>of seven to nine hours,</p>
<p>when you start to drop below seven hours,</p>
<p>there is a relationship which suggests</p>
<p>that the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.</p>
<p>Short sleep in that regard predicts all cause mortality.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s again, not a linear relationship</p>
<p>like the one that we&rsquo;ve seen with REM sleep.</p>
<p>Once you get past nine hours,</p>
<p>the mortality curve stops going down.</p>
<p>And then once you get further 10 or 11 hours,</p>
<p>it hooks back up again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a J shape,</p>
<p>tilted over a little bit and reversed.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this strange hook.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>Right now, sleep science has at least</p>
<p>two non-mutually exclusive explanations for this.</p>
<p>The first is that if you look at some of those populations,</p>
<p>the idea is that whatever was causing them illness</p>
<p>and took their lives was just too much</p>
<p>for sleep to deal with.</p>
<p>However, we know that when we get sick,</p>
<p>one of the things that we do immediately,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a whole mechanism, an inflammatory mechanism,</p>
<p>cytokine mediated.</p>
<p>When we get sick, we want to sleep more.</p>
<p>We just want to curl up in bed and sleep it off.</p>
<p>So the argument there is that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that sleep was killing people prematurely.</p>
<p>It was that these people were calling on the help of sleep.</p>
<p>They were calling on this thing called</p>
<p>the Swiss Army knife of health, that is sleep.</p>
<p>But whatever it is that they were facing</p>
<p>was just too powerful for sleep to overcome.</p>
<p>So it artificially looks as though more sleep</p>
<p>leads to a higher risk of death</p>
<p>when sleep was actually responding to the mortality risk</p>
<p>and it lost the battle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one argument.</p>
<p>The second is that we know that sleep quality</p>
<p>and poor sleep efficiency is a very strong predictor</p>
<p>of all-cause mortality.</p>
<p>And when you look at people who often report</p>
<p>sleeping long amounts, 10 or 11 hours,</p>
<p>they typically report having very poor quality sleep.</p>
<p>So because their quality of sleep is poor,</p>
<p>they just try to sleep longer</p>
<p>to try and get some of that back.</p>
<p>So again, here now, it&rsquo;s poor quality sleep</p>
<p>masking as too much sleep leading to this artificial hook,</p>
<p>which looks like mortality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a second explanation.</p>
<p>A third, which is more of a gedunken,</p>
<p>which is just kind of like a thought experiment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m of this mentality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many other people share this.</p>
<p>I actually think there could be a thing as too much sleep.</p>
<p>Physiologically, I think it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>But the reason I think that is because it&rsquo;s no different</p>
<p>than food, water, or oxygen.</p>
<p>Can you overeat?</p>
<p>Yes, you can.</p>
<p>Can you undereat?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Or light.</p>
<p>Light in the early part of the day,</p>
<p>or throughout the day, wonderful.</p>
<p>Light late in the day and at night, detrimental.</p>
<p>Bi-directional.</p>
<p>For water, can you overhydrate?</p>
<p>Hypernutrimea, it happened in the 1990s and 2000</p>
<p>with the ecstasy craze,</p>
<p>where governments were saying you&rsquo;re dehydrating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dancing all night, please drink water.</p>
<p>And they drank too much water.</p>
<p>The blood electrolytes went all over the place</p>
<p>and they were having cardiac arrests or stroke.</p>
<p>Yeah, people were dying.</p>
<p>And they were dying because of excessive hydration.</p>
<p>Can you get too much oxygen, hyperoxemia,</p>
<p>and it can cause free radical damage,</p>
<p>which can be profoundly harmful and kill brain cells.</p>
<p>Can you sleep too much?</p>
<p>Which is the fifth element of the life equation,</p>
<p>alongside food, water, oxygen.</p>
<p>So fourth, I should say, it can&rsquo;t even count.</p>
<p>Clearly I&rsquo;m sleeping well.</p>
<p>Yes, I think there could be that possibility.</p>
<p>Are most people in danger of getting too much sleep?</p>
<p>Au contraire, if you look at the data.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t dismiss that idea.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a very thorough and very nuanced</p>
<p>and yeah, very clear answer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so interesting to think that a lot</p>
<p>of the data that out there that talking about being</p>
<p>in bed too long, that it&rsquo;s just trying to compensate</p>
<p>for the actual fragmentation of sleep.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m coming away with is that there are many paths</p>
<p>to this and both positive and things to avoid.</p>
<p>But the idea is to get most nights a similar amount,</p>
<p>probably seven to nine hours, somewhere in there,</p>
<p>of high quality sleep.</p>
<p>That this notion of sleep quality is going to become,</p>
<p>I would hope, a phrase that more people think about</p>
<p>and learn about and cultivate as a practice.</p>
<p>I want to ask about a set of behaviors that I&rsquo;m at least,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of at least one company is starting to track</p>
<p>in their sleep monitoring device, and that&rsquo;s orgasm.</p>
<p>And sex, orgasm, and masturbation,</p>
<p>topics that are somewhat sensitive.</p>
<p>But from the perspective of biology,</p>
<p>none of us would be here were it not for sperm meets egg</p>
<p>in some fashion, either in a dish or in vivo.</p>
<p>But what are the data as you know them to be,</p>
<p>or maybe your lab is even doing this kind of work</p>
<p>and exploration about the role that sex, orgasm,</p>
<p>masturbation play in getting to sleep</p>
<p>and staying asleep and sleep quality?</p>
<p>Certainly those behaviors and those physiological events</p>
<p>have been part of our evolutionary history.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story there?</p>
<p>What can we say about this in terms of science</p>
<p>and dare I say practice?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s almost that caricature of,</p>
<p>you know, in the movies where, you know,</p>
<p>a couple makes love and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>you just sort of hear snoring or, you know,</p>
<p>it happens with the idea that it&rsquo;s somewhat somnogenic,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s sleep promoting.</p>
<p>Well, the post-orgasmic increase in prolactin</p>
<p>is thought to be a naturally occurring sedative</p>
<p>that presumably has a function in-</p>
<p>An oxytocin has that also that benefit</p>
<p>where you see, you know, a dissipation of the fight</p>
<p>or flight branch of the nervous system,</p>
<p>which has to happen for you to fall asleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we often see, you know,</p>
<p>here at the sleep center,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see a phenomenon called wired and tired</p>
<p>where people say, look, I am so desperately tired.</p>
<p>I am, I just, I&rsquo;m so, so tired,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t fall asleep because I&rsquo;m too wired.</p>
<p>So your sleep drive, you&rsquo;re desperately tired, it&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>but because you&rsquo;re wired,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got too much sympathetic activation,</p>
<p>too much cortisol as well, you can&rsquo;t fall asleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an impressive roadblock to anything like good sleep.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the principal mechanisms</p>
<p>that we now believe stress and physiological activation</p>
<p>that is the underlying cause of many forms of insomnia.</p>
<p>But coming back to sex,</p>
<p>the data is actually quite compelling</p>
<p>that both either subjectively assessed sleep quality</p>
<p>or objective amount of sleep,</p>
<p>sex that has resulted in orgasm,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s that latter part</p>
<p>that typically needs to happen.</p>
<p>I would imagine so.</p>
<p>That, so between two mutually exclusive individuals</p>
<p>where both are beneficial in terms of receiving an orgasm.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say any discussion about sex,</p>
<p>we were referring to consensual,</p>
<p>age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate.</p>
<p>Wow, I would never have even gone to the species appropriate.</p>
<p>I put species in there because it&rsquo;s the internet</p>
<p>and people will come up with all sorts of ideas.</p>
<p>So I think that age appropriate,</p>
<p>I think age appropriate, consensual,</p>
<p>context appropriate and species appropriate</p>
<p>covers all the bases.</p>
<p>But if I missed any, put them in the comment section</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll be sure to take note.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I think that&rsquo;s really well said</p>
<p>and important to say.</p>
<p>So the data is the,</p>
<p>when you look at couples who have orgasm.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also, however, found benefits of masturbation</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not frequently spoken about,</p>
<p>but if you do some surveys,</p>
<p>it turns out that people will often use masturbation</p>
<p>as a sleep tool if they&rsquo;re struggling with sleep.</p>
<p>And I know this sort of sounds almost</p>
<p>like a strange conversation or it&rsquo;s a taboo conversation,</p>
<p>but I think we just need to be very open about all of this.</p>
<p>I started off in science.</p>
<p>One of the things I worked on early in my career,</p>
<p>not the very first topic,</p>
<p>was the topic of early influences of hormones,</p>
<p>estrogen and testosterone on sexual development</p>
<p>of the brain and body.</p>
<p>And when you are weaned in a laboratory like that,</p>
<p>regardless of what era,</p>
<p>you look at sex and its behaviors and its hormones</p>
<p>and its physiologies as a scientist.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s, to be clear, what we&rsquo;re doing here,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re exploring these behaviors from that perspective.</p>
<p>I mean, one thing is for certain,</p>
<p>everyone is here because a sperm met an egg</p>
<p>either in a dish or in vivo, as we said before.</p>
<p>And at least in 2021, there&rsquo;s no way around that fact.</p>
<p>And what preceded that is typically this act we call sex.</p>
<p>And sometimes, hopefully, I like to think,</p>
<p>orgasm is associated with that sexual activity.</p>
<p>Masturbation as one dimension of that</p>
<p>is something that I think it can and should be discussed</p>
<p>if in fact there are data that relate it to sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, and both of those routes</p>
<p>seem to lead to a sleep benefit.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that it&rsquo;s all about the orgasm.</p>
<p>I think as we spoke about with oxytocin,</p>
<p>there is some degree of per-bonding</p>
<p>that if you have a partner and you experience</p>
<p>an intimate, loving relationship that involves that,</p>
<p>then you can have hormonal benefits</p>
<p>that are sleep-promoting that may not necessarily be seen</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just engaging</p>
<p>in the solo, singular act of masturbation.</p>
<p>So what we certainly know now,</p>
<p>and I am not someone to take any advice on</p>
<p>when it comes to anything relationship-wise or sex-wise.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different episode of the podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, certainly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a podcast series</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to be releasing anytime soon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be mostly about sleep,</p>
<p>although I will touch on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll release a podcast on sleep and sex.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the data that we have so far.</p>
<p>We also know that it works both ways, though,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s commonly the same way with sleep.</p>
<p>You know, sleep and exercise, sleep and diet.</p>
<p>How you eat can affect how you sleep.</p>
<p>How you sleep can affect how you eat.</p>
<p>Same with exercise.</p>
<p>And it turns out it&rsquo;s the same way</p>
<p>with sexual behavior, too.</p>
<p>So here we&rsquo;re talking about whether sex can help with sleep.</p>
<p>Can sleep help with your relationship and sex?</p>
<p>And the answer is, yes, it can.</p>
<p>Firstly, we know,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve spoken a little bit about this,</p>
<p>that the reproductive hormones</p>
<p>are under profound sleep regulation.</p>
<p>Both estrogen and testosterone, as I understand it.</p>
<p>Estrogen, testosterone.</p>
<p>FSH as well.</p>
<p>But women who, or I should say,</p>
<p>anyone who&rsquo;s interested in having higher levels of estrogen</p>
<p>or normal, healthy levels of estrogen,</p>
<p>I presume the data show for estrogen</p>
<p>what the data also show similarly for testosterone,</p>
<p>which is if you get too little or poor quality of sleep,</p>
<p>both sex steroid hormones, as they&rsquo;re referred to,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>which are present in both males and females</p>
<p>and every variation thereof,</p>
<p>are going to be diminished below normal healthy levels.</p>
<p>Correct?</p>
<p>So testosterone, FSH in women,</p>
<p>a key hormone in the regulation for,</p>
<p>key for conception, of course.</p>
<p>All of these sex hormones</p>
<p>seem to become significantly disrupted</p>
<p>when sleep becomes of short quantity or poor quality.</p>
<p>We also know that in women,</p>
<p>sleep disruption can usually lead</p>
<p>to menstrual cycle disruption.</p>
<p>We know this particularly from evidence</p>
<p>in shift working women,</p>
<p>where they are nighttime shift workers,</p>
<p>they struggle with sleep during the day.</p>
<p>Often menstruation is disrupted or even becomes impaired.</p>
<p>But we also know it works this way</p>
<p>not just for sex hormones, but for sex itself.</p>
<p>For example, we found that for every one hour of sleep,</p>
<p>extra sleep that a woman gets,</p>
<p>her interest in becoming sexually intimate with her partner</p>
<p>increases by 14%, which is a non-trivial amount.</p>
<p>And then the final part of,</p>
<p>I think this equation when it comes to sleep and sex</p>
<p>is your relationship itself.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some great work here from UC Berkeley</p>
<p>by Professor Serena Chen.</p>
<p>And what she found was that restless nights</p>
<p>mean for far more brutal fights in your relationship.</p>
<p>And they did this in a number</p>
<p>of different elegant ways and vice versa as well.</p>
<p>I mean, not that I&rsquo;ve ever had conflict in relationships.</p>
<p>Me, like, you know, I just, this is just data I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never experienced that at all.</p>
<p>So they found reliably that sleep would predict</p>
<p>higher likelihood of relationship conflict.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you got into that conflict,</p>
<p>the chances of you resolving it were significantly lower</p>
<p>when the parties had not been sleeping well.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is because when you&rsquo;re not well slept,</p>
<p>your empathy goes down.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re taking more of an abrasive stance</p>
<p>with your partner rather than a more agreeable stance</p>
<p>with your partner.</p>
<p>So at almost every dimension of a human loving relationship,</p>
<p>sleep can have a dramatic impact.</p>
<p>I think these are really important things to underscore.</p>
<p>One of the most common questions I get,</p>
<p>because there seems to be a community of people</p>
<p>on the internet that are obsessed with this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who they are because it&rsquo;s all,</p>
<p>all this internet stuff is shouting into a tunnel</p>
<p>and getting comments back in written form.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very bizarre conversation, so to speak,</p>
<p>is whether or not sexual behavior itself lowers</p>
<p>or increases testosterone.</p>
<p>And I went into the data, which spans many decades,</p>
<p>actually, both animal studies and human studies.</p>
<p>And it seems, just to underscore this,</p>
<p>as long as we&rsquo;re talking about this subject,</p>
<p>that it does seem that sexual activity,</p>
<p>sex between two people,</p>
<p>does seem to increase testosterone in both.</p>
<p>There is this question about orgasm or no orgasm,</p>
<p>ejaculation, no ejaculation.</p>
<p>And indeed there do seem to be some effects</p>
<p>of restricting ejaculation in males</p>
<p>as a form of further increasing testosterone.</p>
<p>So sex without ejaculation, further increasing testosterone.</p>
<p>But the data are not clean, presumably,</p>
<p>because organizing these sorts of studies</p>
<p>and getting truth in self-reporting</p>
<p>is probably hard to get from subjects.</p>
<p>But everything sort of points in the direction</p>
<p>that provided that the relationship is a healthy one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s consensual, it&rsquo;s age-appropriate,</p>
<p>context-appropriate, species-appropriate,</p>
<p>that sex between two individuals</p>
<p>does seem to increase the sex droid hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen, toward healthy ranges.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m hearing now,</p>
<p>the sort of gestalt of the discussion we just had,</p>
<p>is that that too can promote sleepiness,</p>
<p>restful states, and quality sleep.</p>
<p>And I think this is an important conversation</p>
<p>that just hasn&rsquo;t been held enough.</p>
<p>I mean, sooner or later, both in the US and elsewhere,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have to acknowledge</p>
<p>that we are biological organisms of some sort</p>
<p>and that we have choice in life about all these things,</p>
<p>from supplementation to sex or no sex, et cetera,</p>
<p>but that they have profound effects on our core biology.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s fascinating to me</p>
<p>that the areas of the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>the preoptic area, the supraoptic areas,</p>
<p>those areas which the names might not mean anything</p>
<p>to anybody besides Matt and I sitting here,</p>
<p>but those areas sit cheek to jowl with each other</p>
<p>in the hypothalamus and control sleep and sex.</p>
<p>The trigger of orgasm, the appetite for food,</p>
<p>the appetite for water, for electrolytes.</p>
<p>I mean, the hypothalamus is kind of a festival of neurons</p>
<p>with different booths for different primitive behaviors.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a small, small structure in the brain,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the orchestrator of a vast number</p>
<p>of our behaviors, disproportionate</p>
<p>in terms of its size versus effect.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think you can go</p>
<p>to this hypothalamic festival</p>
<p>without at least seeing all the booths,</p>
<p>whether or not you decide to visit them or not.</p>
<p>Oh, I love that.</p>
<p>Master analogy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad that we&rsquo;ve broached that conversation</p>
<p>and I hope people will think that we&rsquo;ve approached it</p>
<p>with the appropriate level of sensitivity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important one that we&rsquo;re going to hear more</p>
<p>about one way or the other.</p>
<p>People are certainly thinking about this,</p>
<p>if not engaging in these sorts of behaviors</p>
<p>or avoiding them.</p>
<p>So the more we can understand about the biology, the better.</p>
<p>Well said.</p>
<p>And so thank you for bringing that topic up</p>
<p>because for the record, Matt tabled it for discussion.</p>
<p>I said, well, we were just like chatting outside</p>
<p>and I think we&rsquo;d said something about sort of sex.</p>
<p>And I said, yeah, we can go there.</p>
<p>This is actually interesting data.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I want to touch on just two remaining topics.</p>
<p>One is, are there any unconventional sleep tips</p>
<p>or things about sleep that we&rsquo;ve overlooked?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;ve covered everything, great.</p>
<p>But, you know, we&rsquo;re here to keep the room cool.</p>
<p>We here, because of this temperature phenomenon,</p>
<p>the light aspects, the considerations about alcohol, CBD,</p>
<p>marijuana, cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwis.</p>
<p>Perhaps, perhaps.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t put me on the hook for tart cherries and kiwis.</p>
<p>I was just offering what I know about the data.</p>
<p>And these are considerations and whether or not people</p>
<p>batch these things, I won&rsquo;t even list them off now</p>
<p>because there are too many jokes that one could make.</p>
<p>And I have no affiliation with any of these products</p>
<p>or companies or anything.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m going to take out stock in a kiwi company.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>But the question I have is about any unconventional</p>
<p>or lesser known things, or maybe you do things</p>
<p>or you think about things just in a purely exploratory way</p>
<p>as a scientist, you know, the what if kind of things</p>
<p>that, yeah, what if it turns out that,</p>
<p>and I hear I just, I&rsquo;ve got a blank there</p>
<p>for you to fill in.</p>
<p>I think, you know, beyond the standard, you know,</p>
<p>fair that I&rsquo;ve dished out plenty of times of sleep hygiene</p>
<p>of, you know, regularity, temperature, darkness,</p>
<p>alcohol, caffeine, and we&rsquo;ve spoken about all of those.</p>
<p>What are some more unconventional tips, I guess?</p>
<p>The first one, which is unconventional</p>
<p>along the lines of naps.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve had a bad night of sleep,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re starting to emerge with insomnia</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve had a bad night of sleep,</p>
<p>the advice, and I learned this from my wonderful colleague,</p>
<p>Michael Perlis, do nothing.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is don&rsquo;t wake up any later.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sleep in the following day to try and make up for it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t nap during the day.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t consume extra caffeine to wake you up</p>
<p>to try to get you through the day.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t go to bed any earlier</p>
<p>to think that you&rsquo;re going to compensate.</p>
<p>And I can explain all of those things,</p>
<p>but if you wake up later,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be sleepy until later the evening.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna go to bed at your normal time</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t be sleeping.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll think, well, I just came off a bad night of sleep</p>
<p>and now I still, I can&rsquo;t even get to sleep</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s my normal time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you slept in later than you would otherwise</p>
<p>and you reduce the window of adenosine accumulation</p>
<p>before your normal bedtime.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t wake up any later.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use more caffeine for the reasons that are obvious</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s only gonna crank you</p>
<p>and keep you awake the following night</p>
<p>or decrease the probability</p>
<p>of a good following night of recovery sleep.</p>
<p>Third, I mentioned don&rsquo;t take naps</p>
<p>because once again, that will just take,</p>
<p>naps, particularly later in the afternoon,</p>
<p>I almost liken them to snacking before a main meal.</p>
<p>It just takes your appetite off the edge</p>
<p>of that main meal of sleep, so don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And then finally, don&rsquo;t go to bed any earlier.</p>
<p>Resist and resist and go to bed at your normal time.</p>
<p>What I want to try and do is prevent you from thinking,</p>
<p>well, I had such a bad night last night</p>
<p>and I normally go to bed at 10.30,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna get into bed at nine o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>because last night was just so bad,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not your natural bedtime</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not aligned with your natural chronotype</p>
<p>because presumably you kind of know something about that</p>
<p>or a morning type, evening type,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to sleep in harmony,</p>
<p>which is usually how you get best quality sleep,</p>
<p>but you go to bed at nine</p>
<p>and my body is not ready to sleep at nine o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m worried because I had a bad night of sleep</p>
<p>last night, so I get into bed</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m tossing and turning for the first hour</p>
<p>and a half because it&rsquo;s not my natural sleep window,</p>
<p>but I just thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>And if I didn&rsquo;t know anything about sleep,</p>
<p>I would think all of these same things too,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not finger wagging,</p>
<p>but if I have a bad night of sleep and I am not immune,</p>
<p>just because I know a little bit about sleep</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t have my bad nights,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean I haven&rsquo;t had bouts of insomnia in my life,</p>
<p>I have, but after a bad night of sleep, I do nothing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do any of those four things.</p>
<p>I think the second tip I would offer</p>
<p>in terms of unconventional is have a wind down routine.</p>
<p>Many of us think of sleep as if it&rsquo;s like a light switch,</p>
<p>that we just jump into bed and when we turn the light out,</p>
<p>sleep should arrive in that same way,</p>
<p>just the binary, it&rsquo;s on or it&rsquo;s off.</p>
<p>Sleep is a physiological process,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more like landing a plane.</p>
<p>It takes time to gradually descend down</p>
<p>onto the terra firma of what we call</p>
<p>good solid sleep at night.</p>
<p>Find out whatever works for you</p>
<p>and it could be light stretching,</p>
<p>I usually meditate for about 10 or 15 minutes before bed.</p>
<p>Some people like reading,</p>
<p>try not to watch television in bed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually advised against-</p>
<p>Too much light to your eyes.</p>
<p>Too much light, too activating.</p>
<p>You can listen to a relaxing podcast,</p>
<p>although we can speak about technology in the bedroom too,</p>
<p>but have some kind of a wind down routine.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t race into your garage</p>
<p>and come to a screeching halt from 60 miles an hour.</p>
<p>You typically downshift your gears</p>
<p>and you slow down as you come into the garage.</p>
<p>This is the same thing with sleep too.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the second thing,</p>
<p>have some kind of a wind down routine,</p>
<p>find what works for you,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s taking a hot bath or a warm shower</p>
<p>and then stick to it.</p>
<p>Just, we do this with kids all the time,</p>
<p>we find out what their bedroom,</p>
<p>sorry, their bedtime regimen is</p>
<p>and then we just stick to it faithfully</p>
<p>because we humans are the same way too.</p>
<p>The third thing is a myth, don&rsquo;t count sheep.</p>
<p>There was a study done here at UC Berkeley,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do this today, I wish I did,</p>
<p>it was by my colleague, Professor Alison Harvey.</p>
<p>And they found that counting sheep</p>
<p>actually made it harder to fall asleep,</p>
<p>it made matters worse.</p>
<p>As a counter, sorry, counter measure to that,</p>
<p>what they did find was that taking yourself</p>
<p>on some kind of a mental walk.</p>
<p>So think about a nice walk that you take in nature</p>
<p>or a walk on the beach</p>
<p>or even a walk around an urban environment.</p>
<p>And visualizing that, that seemed to be beneficial.</p>
<p>The other thing about sort of that idea</p>
<p>of shifting focus away from your mind itself,</p>
<p>get your mind off itself is a good piece of advice.</p>
<p>Catharsis, you can try to write down</p>
<p>all of the concerns that you have</p>
<p>and do this not right before bed,</p>
<p>but usually an hour or two before bed.</p>
<p>Some people call it a worry journal.</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s a little bit like closing down</p>
<p>all of the emotional tabs on my browser.</p>
<p>Because if I shut the computer down</p>
<p>and all of those tabs are still open,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna come back in the morning</p>
<p>and the computer&rsquo;s red hot, the fan&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>because it didn&rsquo;t go to sleep,</p>
<p>because it couldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because there were too many tabs active and open.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the same way with sleep as well.</p>
<p>So try to think about doing that.</p>
<p>So just vomit out all of your concerns on the page.</p>
<p>I like that, because my 3 a.m. waking</p>
<p>is often associated with me writing down</p>
<p>the list of things that I forgot to do that I need to do.</p>
<p>And once I eventually wake up</p>
<p>from the later night, second half of the night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>that stuff seems much more tractable and reasonable,</p>
<p>but it sure would be great</p>
<p>to get that stuff out of the way before sleep.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also something</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think people have spoken about a lot,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to research it,</p>
<p>which is difficulty and anxiety at night in the dark</p>
<p>is not the same difficulty and anxiety in the light of day.</p>
<p>And when we have those thoughts at night,</p>
<p>it comes with a magnitude of rumination</p>
<p>and catastrophization that is disproportionate</p>
<p>to that which you would describe when you are awake.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on about the brain</p>
<p>and thought and emotion at the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of theories as to why.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I like the idea of closing up,</p>
<p>zipping up all of those different components,</p>
<p>just get them out on the page.</p>
<p>And it feel, and I at first thought,</p>
<p>this just sounds like hooey, it sounds very Berkeley.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of come by hour, we all hold hands</p>
<p>and walk home at the end of the day.</p>
<p>But then the data started coming out,</p>
<p>really good studies from good people.</p>
<p>And they found that keeping one of those journals</p>
<p>decreased the time it takes you to fall asleep by 50%, five,</p>
<p>zero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well on par with any pharmaceutical agent.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that, I&rsquo;ve long thought</p>
<p>that the worries and concerns and ideas I have at 3, 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to not place any stock in them.</p>
<p>Because something, I&rsquo;m glad that you might decide</p>
<p>to eventually look at this in your laboratory,</p>
<p>because I feel like something is melted away or altered.</p>
<p>I suspect it&rsquo;s in the regulation</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>that it makes sense why a concern at 3, 4 a.m.</p>
<p>ought to evoke more of a panic sense than a concern sense.</p>
<p>And certainly that&rsquo;s my experience,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m fortunate to not suffer</p>
<p>from full-blown panic attacks,</p>
<p>but everything seems worse at 3, 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re awake.</p>
<p>And we need to sort of look into that,</p>
<p>because if you look at suicide rates</p>
<p>around the 24-hour clock face,</p>
<p>disproportionately higher rates</p>
<p>in those middle sort of night hours.</p>
<p>So now I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s causative or not,</p>
<p>but something, you know, it could just be</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the time when we&rsquo;re mostly lonely</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re by ourselves, and that&rsquo;s the reason.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s got nothing to do with sleep or the nighttime.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the third thing.</p>
<p>I think the fourth sort of little tip I would give</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unconventional is remove all clock faces</p>
<p>from your bedroom.</p>
<p>Including your phone.</p>
<p>Including your phone.</p>
<p>And resist checking it.</p>
<p>Now I know, and I can speak about the phone too,</p>
<p>that genie of technology is out the bottle</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not going back in anytime soon.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got to think as scientists and sleep scientists,</p>
<p>you know, as to what we do with, you know,</p>
<p>phones in the bedroom.</p>
<p>Years ago, I was a counselor at a summer camp.</p>
<p>I worked with at-risk kids,</p>
<p>and there was a phrase that comes to mind here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, be a channel, not a dam.</p>
<p>Because when you try and dam certain kinds of behavior,</p>
<p>physically dam certain kinds of behavior,</p>
<p>not morally dam, that too,</p>
<p>it just creeps over the edge and you get a waterfall.</p>
<p>So it has to be channeled.</p>
<p>The phone and devices have to be worked with</p>
<p>and negotiated, not eliminated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And, you know, think about those mindfully too.</p>
<p>But clock faces, remove all of those.</p>
<p>Because if you are having, you know, a tough night,</p>
<p>knowing that it&rsquo;s 3.22 in the morning</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s 4.48 in the morning,</p>
<p>does not help you in the slightest.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only going to make matters worse than better.</p>
<p>So try to remove all clock faces.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s one of those other tips</p>
<p>that some people have found helpful.</p>
<p>But those would be sort of some slightly unconventional,</p>
<p>I guess, more than your stock fair of,</p>
<p>here are the five tips for sleep hygiene tonight, so.</p>
<p>Those are terrific sleep tips,</p>
<p>and several of which, if not all of which,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to incorporate.</p>
<p>Matt, this has been an amazing deep dive on sleep</p>
<p>and its positive and negative regulators.</p>
<p>I hope it hasn&rsquo;t been too long.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>No, this has been great.</p>
<p>Please cut it down, shorten it to, you know,</p>
<p>the five minutes of meaningful stuff that I offer.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>It is chock-a-block full of valuable takeaways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been tremendously fun for me to dissect out</p>
<p>this incredible aspect of our lives</p>
<p>that we call sleep with a fellow scientist</p>
<p>and a fellow public educator.</p>
<p>I want to say several things.</p>
<p>First of all, we should say where people can find you,</p>
<p>although it shouldn&rsquo;t be that difficult these days.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very present on the internet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately.</p>
<p>For better or for worse.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s wonderful that you&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s a public health service that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>No one requires you or any other scientists</p>
<p>to get out and share this information.</p>
<p>My sense of you, knowing you a bit,</p>
<p>and from following your work very closely,</p>
<p>both your scientific work in detail</p>
<p>and your public facing educational work,</p>
<p>is that you very much want the best for people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an interesting thing as a scientist</p>
<p>or a clinician to know that certain answers exist,</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have all the answers,</p>
<p>but that there is a better path, there are better ways,</p>
<p>and people can benefit in a myriad of ways.</p>
<p>So for that, because I know that to be very genuine in you,</p>
<p>you want the best for people</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re offering tremendous advice</p>
<p>and considerations and people can take it or leave it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I view it.</p>
<p>I also want to thank you for taking the time</p>
<p>out of your day to sit with me here</p>
<p>and have this discussion.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a privilege.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a delight.</p>
<p>You and I, I think we&rsquo;re like kind in lots of ways.</p>
<p>And I take you as a shining example</p>
<p>of how you can effectively connect with the public.</p>
<p>And I know that we&rsquo;ve had our conversations</p>
<p>before we ever sat down sort of together</p>
<p>about how to think about communicating with the public</p>
<p>and the pros and cons of that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve just loved your opinions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been drinking it all in.</p>
<p>And then I think the third thing I&rsquo;d like to say</p>
<p>is thank you for being such an incredible sleep ambassador.</p>
<p>The series that you&rsquo;ve released on sleep,</p>
<p>the way that you speak about sleep,</p>
<p>the way that you moderate and have championed sleep,</p>
<p>it is remarkable.</p>
<p>So thank you for just being a brother in arms in that way.</p>
<p>Well, we are.</p>
<p>And thanks for those words.</p>
<p>99% of what I discussed there was the work of you</p>
<p>and your colleagues in the sleep field.</p>
<p>So proper acknowledgement, but thank you.</p>
<p>Where can people learn more about what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>currently and what&rsquo;s coming next?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on Twitter.</p>
<p>I am on Twitter.</p>
<p>I typically tweet.</p>
<p>As the sleep diplomat.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s no, it&rsquo;s just sleep diplomat.</p>
<p>Sleep diplomat on Twitter, sleepdiplomat.com website.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the science that we do here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s humansleepscience.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Center for Human Sleep Science.</p>
<p>You can pick up a copy of the book if you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called, Why We Sleep.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re curious about sleep, that&rsquo;s one path to take.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s my view.</p>
<p>Is there another book someday in the future?</p>
<p>I think there may be.</p>
<p>Many, many millions of people</p>
<p>will be very happy to hear that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s starting to take hold.</p>
<p>And then as we discussed,</p>
<p>I am more than kicking around the idea</p>
<p>of a short form podcast rather than a long form.</p>
<p>Not long form because I don&rsquo;t have the mental capacity</p>
<p>or the interviewing just capability</p>
<p>that someone like you has.</p>
<p>So it will probably just be monologue short form.</p>
<p>So if there is some interest, I&rsquo;ll probably do that as well.</p>
<p>So those are the ways that people can find me.</p>
<p>But overall, if you&rsquo;re interested in sleep,</p>
<p>just listen to Andrew.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best thing I can tell people.</p>
<p>All right, well, now we&rsquo;re batting back and forth,</p>
<p>the vector of action, so to speak.</p>
<p>But I do hope you&rsquo;ll start a podcast,</p>
<p>however brief or lengthy these episodes turn out to be</p>
<p>because I do believe that&rsquo;s a great venue</p>
<p>to get information out into the world.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t just want to hear more from Matt Walker.</p>
<p>I speak for many people.</p>
<p>We need to.</p>
<p>The work you&rsquo;re doing is both influential,</p>
<p>but more importantly, it is important work.</p>
<p>It has the impact that&rsquo;s needed,</p>
<p>especially in this day and age</p>
<p>where science and medicine, public health,</p>
<p>and the issues of the world, et cetera,</p>
<p>are really converging.</p>
<p>So I know I speak on behalf</p>
<p>of a tremendous number of people when I just say,</p>
<p>thank you for doing the work you do and for being you.</p>
<p>And thanks for being a good friend.</p>
<p>Likewise, too.</p>
<p>And by the way, I just going to note</p>
<p>that it was nice that the two of us</p>
<p>both got the Johnny Cash memo about how to dress today.</p>
<p>It seems as though we&rsquo;re both kind of,</p>
<p>we got that same memo,</p>
<p>which will mean nothing to people who are listening.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re watching the video,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably see what I mean.</p>
<p>Andrew, thank you for taking this time.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thanks so much, Matt.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me for my discussion</p>
