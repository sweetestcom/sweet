<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>all right welcome back everyone we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>here with another show we have a great</p>
<p>lineup of guests in the greenhouse a</p>
<p>green room not the greenhouse uh I have</p>
<p>vegetables in the greenhouse growing but</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>um Steve let&rsquo;s get started after my</p>
<p>little disclaimer here that I&rsquo;m not here</p>
<p>to diagnose or replace any Medical</p>
<p>Treatments or recommendations check with</p>
<p>your doctor before taking any of the</p>
<p>advice just take it with a grain of salt</p>
<p>and uh just as entertainment and</p>
<p>education yeah absolutely and from such</p>
<p>entertainment and education I&rsquo;m down</p>
<p>about 45 pounds never felt better in my</p>
<p>life so thank you for not giving me any</p>
<p>help Dr Berg it&rsquo;s been tremendous all</p>
<p>right now let&rsquo;s see hey I&rsquo;m glad that</p>
<p>you uh stumbled on some data and you got</p>
<p>better no kidding um all right well</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go straight to uh how about social</p>
<p>media and let&rsquo;s start with YouTube this</p>
<p>morning Laura from you or this morning</p>
<p>wherever you folks are it&rsquo;s any time of</p>
<p>day in fact we got one guest from Hawaii</p>
<p>poor guys like 4 30 in the morning we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>try to get to uh him uh in short order</p>
<p>so stay and by there so anyway from</p>
<p>YouTube you mentioned in a recent video</p>
<p>the gastroparesis was caused by ab1</p>
<p>deficiency are there any other</p>
<p>supplements that would be that would</p>
<p>help my niece who suffers greatly from</p>
<p>this condition</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an autoimmune I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s an uh</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system problem</p>
<p>where usually you can get that from</p>
<p>diabetes because you destroy the nervous</p>
<p>system especially</p>
<p>um you get dysfunction of the autonomic</p>
<p>nervous system and that involves the</p>
<p>digestive system so you could also use</p>
<p>alpha lipoic acid that&rsquo;s a good one to</p>
<p>counteract the the complications from</p>
<p>especially if you have diabetes um but I</p>
<p>think for gastroparesis which is a real</p>
<p>slow sluggish digestive system</p>
<p>um all affected by various nerves</p>
<p>including the vagus nerve so alpha</p>
<p>lipoic acid and you can take</p>
<p>benphotamine which is the B1</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now if there&rsquo;s any type of um</p>
<p>neurological stuff that needs B1 for the</p>
<p>brain the central nervous system okay</p>
<p>not not the peripheral</p>
<p>um then you would need you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>benphotamine that won&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>um what you do need is a a different um</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called l l cyanide which is</p>
<p>a natural B uh it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not the um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not similar to</p>
<p>benphotomain it&rsquo;s a different it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>natural B1 which is also fat soluble but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different one I I did a lot of</p>
<p>videos on this you can look on my</p>
<p>website and uh check that out but</p>
<p>be one and alpha lipoic acids are going</p>
<p>to be the best thing and then of course</p>
<p>try to find out</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing that&rsquo;s creating the</p>
<p>deficiency in the first place</p>
<p>okay very good and just a quick reminder</p>
<p>in addition to the internet that Dr Berg</p>
<p>mentioned you can download his free app</p>
<p>for Android or Os and have a pocket full</p>
<p>of information anywhere you go so make</p>
<p>sure you take a few minutes to download</p>
<p>that if you haven&rsquo;t already let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to social media Lou from Australia</p>
<p>welcome to the show on YouTube I drink</p>
<p>about five liters of water with</p>
<p>electrolytes and apple cider vinegar and</p>
<p>lemon I&rsquo;m not currently on keto but</p>
<p>should I be drinking that much liquid</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bad idea as long as you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>forcing yourself to drink I mean</p>
<p>hopefully you&rsquo;re exercising that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re drinking</p>
<p>um you don&rsquo;t want to force yourself to</p>
<p>drink gallons of water</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not hot and exercising</p>
<p>because you could dilute uh your your um</p>
<p>sodium and that can create what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>hyponatremia which is really dangerous</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know just like not drinking enough</p>
<p>water drinking excessive water can kill</p>
<p>you so you just want to drink</p>
<p>appropriate amounts of water to be</p>
<p>hydrated but the fact that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>all these other things to add</p>
<p>electrolytes back in is going to</p>
<p>actually minimize the damage but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it is a good question if you&rsquo;re drinking</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you drink a gallon or two</p>
<p>gallons of water with electrolytes and</p>
<p>the sea salt you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be</p>
<p>diluting that but this is a lot of</p>
<p>volume of urine of just a lot of of</p>
<p>liquid going in your body which your</p>
<p>body is going to have to get rid of</p>
<p>because it can only hold so much volume</p>
<p>probably it could potentially increase</p>
<p>your blood pressure so you know just</p>
<p>like any</p>
<p>nutrient or anything</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you want to look at the whole picture of</p>
<p>like what you&rsquo;re trying to solve when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing that some people drink a</p>
<p>lot more water because they want to</p>
<p>dilute the kidney</p>
<p>and not get calcium buildup that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called hypercalcemia because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking a lot of vitamin D</p>
<p>yet other people want to prevent a</p>
<p>kidney stone</p>
<p>um because they&rsquo;ve had it before in</p>
<p>which case they need more water for sure</p>
<p>to dilute the urine so there&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>reasons different problems to solve</p>
<p>all right very good well that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very interesting I didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that would cause higher blood pressure</p>
<p>but there you go learn something new</p>
<p>every day Chaz from YouTube and Chaz is</p>
<p>another one that has is not taking your</p>
<p>counsel and refuses to get better but it</p>
<p>seemed to happen anyway thanks to your</p>
<p>Healthy keto program my blood pressure</p>
<p>has gone from 130 over 80 to 90 over 78</p>
<p>thank you Dr Berg so I know you</p>
<p>unwittingly</p>
<p>did something to help him</p>
<p>Sonia from YouTube during my</p>
<p>chemotherapy I lost my period is it</p>
<p>possible to restore it what measures</p>
<p>would you suggest</p>
<p>when you go through chemo</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through a poisoning of your</p>
<p>body and you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>repair that so it could take some time</p>
<p>but you want to get back on things that</p>
<p>heal the body and that um it&rsquo;s uh I</p>
<p>think the program that I mentioned the</p>
<p>healthy version of Keto with</p>
<p>intermittent fasting will bring you back</p>
<p>to where you need to be but it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to take some time but you might need to</p>
<p>do a bit of detoxing not from some herb</p>
<p>but just healthy foods over a period of</p>
<p>time especially the cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables that can help help the liver</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it just you know blows me away</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know you even take let&rsquo;s just take</p>
<p>the normal</p>
<p>requirements for nutrients right people</p>
<p>the rdas and people are always like well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having having enough rdas</p>
<p>um one of the ways that they came up</p>
<p>with those values is to take</p>
<p>um populations and see you know the the</p>
<p>low end and the high-end populations</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>I mean I don&rsquo;t know have you ever met</p>
<p>someone that&rsquo;s healthy I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really hard to find healthy people so</p>
<p>you basically let&rsquo;s take a let&rsquo;s take a</p>
<p>snapshot and a picture of an average</p>
<p>person</p>
<p>you know and then let&rsquo;s get their values</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll call that normal</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be doing a video on that topic</p>
<p>so stay tuned because there&rsquo;s a lot to</p>
<p>talk about interesting okay we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>our first question for the day and I</p>
<p>gotta warn the audience there are new</p>
<p>true falsers that you can simply flip a</p>
<p>coin but you know uh Dr Berg I think</p>
<p>this is terrific I&rsquo;m very interested in</p>
<p>these questions like I&rsquo;m sure most</p>
<p>people are and five questions a week and</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a dutiful Watcher that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>pieces of Education that you give</p>
<p>yourself every year by listening to Dr</p>
<p>Burke Show and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just really interesting so with</p>
<p>that said here&rsquo;s the first question of</p>
<p>the show</p>
<p>all right what is the true purpose of</p>
<p>sleep for our bodies</p>
<p>all right simple enough question hop on</p>
<p>it uh let&rsquo;s see poor Karen from Facebook</p>
<p>is suffering from a uh red rot excuse me</p>
<p>red rash on her legs and ankles any</p>
<p>ideas doc</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to know that based on</p>
<p>no data or history</p>
<p>um I mean</p>
<p>could it be poison ivy could it be an</p>
<p>allergy to something you ate like gluten</p>
<p>or some uh something like um some nut</p>
<p>allergy or</p>
<p>or a dairy allergy something like that</p>
<p>so I I would need more information to</p>
<p>evaluate and also one really good tip</p>
<p>about figuring these things out is just</p>
<p>simply ask yourself what what happened</p>
<p>just before I got the rash</p>
<p>oh I was bit by a tick okay good then</p>
<p>now we know so it&rsquo;s always kind of like</p>
<p>what happened right before it uh or</p>
<p>maybe not exactly right before but maybe</p>
<p>a day before it because sometimes these</p>
<p>allergies are delayed</p>
<p>okay very good Karen we hope that that</p>
<p>gives you some basis for trying to</p>
<p>figure out what&rsquo;s going on with you and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s going on with</p>
<p>Brandon in Oahu it&rsquo;s very early uh five</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock or something Brandon are you</p>
<p>there did you pass out let me see if you</p>
<p>fell asleep or not there he is okay</p>
<p>Brandon now remember the Rules of</p>
<p>Engagement one question 30 seconds Dr</p>
<p>Berg will answer your question go</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s muted he has to unmute unmute</p>
<p>Brandon if you would we want to hear you</p>
<p>there we go all right very good go ahead</p>
<p>with your question</p>
<p>yeah uh the question is vitamin C</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s an article that came out in</p>
<p>2013 that is posted on PubMed that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>titled myths artifacts</p>
<p>and flaws and vitamin C and the studies</p>
<p>around it and there was a study in 1997</p>
<p>of Swedish men that I think it was 48</p>
<p>850 men participated in the study it</p>
<p>began in 1987 it concluded around 2009</p>
<p>and they found that vitamin C high dose</p>
<p>a thousand milligrams or more a day</p>
<p>contributed to a two times likely</p>
<p>um or more or two times more likely to</p>
<p>develop kidney stones than those that</p>
<p>did not take Vitamin C but that study in</p>
<p>particular is flawed due to the study</p>
<p>size due to a lot of different factors I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get into right now so my question</p>
<p>to you Doctor</p>
<p>observations that was an observational</p>
<p>study yes it was an observational study</p>
<p>and my question to you is as humans we</p>
<p>used to make anywhere from 12 to 16</p>
<p>grams of vitamin C just 20 000 years ago</p>
<p>and we lost that evolutionarily or</p>
<p>ability via Evolution uh but all the</p>
<p>other animals still make it except for</p>
<p>two other primates so my question to you</p>
<p>is should we be supplementing 12 to 16</p>
<p>grams of vitamin C a day as we used to</p>
<p>do that as prehistoric humans</p>
<p>really really good Dynamite question</p>
<p>there um yeah we have the reason why we</p>
<p>know that we used to make it is we have</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s called Junk DNA which is not</p>
<p>really junk DNA you look at these</p>
<p>different programs</p>
<p>um that wow yeah we used to we lost that</p>
<p>enzyme somehow</p>
<p>um during this period of time</p>
<p>um maybe we didn&rsquo;t need the enzyme and</p>
<p>so it just kind of went into this</p>
<p>dormant phase and because people got</p>
<p>enough from the diet</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a couple points to this um</p>
<p>the chemistry of vitamin C is similar to</p>
<p>glucose and I do know when you have more</p>
<p>glucose you don&rsquo;t really you your</p>
<p>requirement for vitamin C goes way up</p>
<p>and this is why when someone does a</p>
<p>carnivore diet uh they&rsquo;re like wow where</p>
<p>are you getting vitamin C well the need</p>
<p>for Vitamin C goes way down so I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really hard question to know</p>
<p>because of the variables with vitamin C</p>
<p>like um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things that age stress</p>
<p>level diet sugar requirement one of the</p>
<p>best</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>things to do well actually I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be the way of the future for</p>
<p>medicine is it&rsquo;s called metabolomics now</p>
<p>what the heck does that mean that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>type of evaluation which a lot of</p>
<p>doctors are getting involved with which</p>
<p>I I hope more doctors get involved with</p>
<p>where they can do a blood test or a</p>
<p>urine test and look at your biochemistry</p>
<p>and look at all the</p>
<p>they it&rsquo;s called metabolites that make</p>
<p>up your metabolism and they can get a</p>
<p>dynamic picture of what&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>the Krebs cycle in your mitochondria</p>
<p>they can look at oxidative stress they</p>
<p>can look at</p>
<p>your Chemistry from a completely</p>
<p>different Dynamic view so they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>looking at statically but dynamically</p>
<p>and say wow look at this cofactor</p>
<p>vitamin C is not</p>
<p>is not helping this reaction occur in</p>
<p>the body let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s not helping the</p>
<p>production of collagen and the adrenal</p>
<p>because vitamin C is involved in a lot</p>
<p>of different things so</p>
<p>looking at Vitamin C Amounts is not</p>
<p>important is looking at the demand or</p>
<p>need for vitamin C for these different</p>
<p>metabolic reactions so when you look at</p>
<p>this picture of metabolomics you can see</p>
<p>um and you can understand reading it you</p>
<p>can go wow</p>
<p>he has sufficient vitamin C even though</p>
<p>it might be low because everything is</p>
<p>working around that chemistry</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>so the the short answer is um</p>
<p>if you eat a healthy diet with that</p>
<p>comes from the foods I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need massive amounts of</p>
<p>it especially if you&rsquo;re not doing the</p>
<p>high carbs and sugars that compete for</p>
<p>vitamin C but</p>
<p>I mean one way to know that you&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>deficient is just to um</p>
<p>you have fatigue do you have bleeding in</p>
<p>the gums you know you can look at that</p>
<p>as well but that&rsquo;s just a like a crude</p>
<p>crude answer</p>
<p>all right well listen thank you so much</p>
<p>uh for for that Brandon and by the way</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s by the way audience it&rsquo;s 5 15</p>
<p>a.m in Oahu so hopefully Brandon can get</p>
<p>a few uh Z&rsquo;s before he goes out and</p>
<p>surfs or some other onerous activity has</p>
<p>to do on that beautiful island so thanks</p>
<p>so much for joining us and good question</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so hard it&rsquo;s so hard uh to do</p>
<p>nutritional studies because of isolating</p>
<p>that one variable um and plus with uh</p>
<p>vitamin c does not work by itself I mean</p>
<p>it works with so many different other</p>
<p>nutritional factors so</p>
<p>um you can kind of get a rough idea but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s difficult this is this is</p>
<p>very difficult but especially especially</p>
<p>the type of vitamin C some of these</p>
<p>tests that like you&rsquo;re using just</p>
<p>ascorbic acid you&rsquo;re not using the type</p>
<p>of vitamin C that comes from nature with</p>
<p>all the different component parts so</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>um that is a problem</p>
<p>all right well we all certainly hope</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re close to imbalance as possible the</p>
<p>audience is in balance with answering</p>
<p>questions quickly as usual and the first</p>
<p>one of the day was what is true purpose</p>
<p>of sleep for our bodies</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>and survey says boy it just popped way</p>
<p>back okay answer 75 percent of our</p>
<p>respondents say sleep is for restoring</p>
<p>and healing the body 20 say it&rsquo;s to</p>
<p>improve mental capacity uh and health</p>
<p>and five percent say is to eliminate</p>
<p>toxins</p>
<p>you know what the answer is</p>
<p>to eliminate toxins especially from the</p>
<p>brain especially from the brain there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some real interesting data that they uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re getting rid</p>
<p>of uh free radicals and oxidative stress</p>
<p>is at night time so this is why probably</p>
<p>Steve when you don&rsquo;t get enough sleep</p>
<p>you might feel it in your head you feel</p>
<p>toxic you feel kind of funky but when</p>
<p>you have a good night rest boy you just</p>
<p>feel your your brain your head feels</p>
<p>rejuvenated so yeah you&rsquo;re detoxifying</p>
<p>all night long and this is another</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>uh factor that relates to longevity and</p>
<p>um stress and um toxicity you know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the more toxic you are probably</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s going to demand that you</p>
<p>sleep more</p>
<p>to kind of sleep it off or just get rid</p>
<p>of the toxins so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>when you next time you want to detoxify</p>
<p>just make sure you get at least five</p>
<p>hours Steve of sleep</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to write it down hope I can</p>
<p>all right who else has got a wild hour</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re getting up well let&rsquo;s give</p>
<p>you a sampling we&rsquo;d like to say a good</p>
<p>morning to all of our viewers joining us</p>
<p>today from the UK Canada Mexico Brazil</p>
<p>Australia Malaysia Finland Nigeria</p>
<p>Indonesia Cyprus Armenia Morocco United</p>

<p>Lebanon Scotland Wales</p>
<p>a slow slow vacuum excuse me Cameroon</p>
<p>Jamaica Algeria Aruba Hong Kong Ireland</p>
<p>and then of course all across these</p>
<p>United States of America and usually we</p>
<p>have a couple more shout outs so away</p>
<p>from there from the people that feel</p>
<p>that they were ignored so anyway thank</p>
<p>you Terry again for your tireless</p>
<p>efforts and cataloging all that stuff</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s go to our second quiz question</p>
<p>of the day spelled that out for you and</p>
<p>since there&rsquo;s no true false there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to give you as much time as we can</p>
<p>to answer it and here it is Dr Byrd</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>stress hormone right so cortisol if</p>
<p>cortisol is an anti-inflammatory hormone</p>
<p>why do high levels of cortisol in our</p>
<p>body lead to inflammation</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s fascinating can&rsquo;t wait for</p>
<p>the audience&rsquo;s answer on that and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see let&rsquo;s go back to social media this</p>
<p>time to YouTube and as from YouTube I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>starting a 70 hour fast and understand</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t do apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>during the fast if that&rsquo;s so what do we</p>
<p>do about cramping and mineral absorption</p>
<p>for someone without a gallbladder</p>
<p>well you can take you can take the</p>
<p>minerals okay because the minerals</p>
<p>just take a little bit more magnesium</p>
<p>and electrolytes the gallbladder if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder means you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>missing the bile to help you absorb more</p>
<p>of the fat soluble vitamins like vitamin</p>
<p>D which is all which is important in the</p>
<p>absorption of calcium and magnesium as</p>
<p>well but I think I would just um</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>ask the question is your stomach really</p>
<p>alkaline do you really have a problem</p>
<p>with the stomach</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the apple cider vinegar yes it can</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just drinking it straight</p>
<p>right so you&rsquo;re diluting it in water</p>
<p>um by a good factor maybe one tablespoon</p>
<p>per</p>
<p>or maybe even 12 ounces or even 10</p>
<p>ounces</p>
<p>so um in one of the videos I mentioned</p>
<p>uh to consume it but</p>
<p>you know some people consume it and they</p>
<p>feel fine</p>
<p>um on a fast but the point is that if</p>
<p>you just take those minerals I think you</p>
<p>can absorb them just fine without the</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar it&rsquo;s not a absolute</p>
<p>necessity</p>
<p>all right very good uh Jan from Facebook</p>
<p>uh what food recommendations and</p>
<p>activities would you make for someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s menstruating and there are</p>
<p>billions of those on planet Earth right</p>
<p>now in that situation what do you think</p>
<p>doc</p>
<p>well do you have problems with your</p>
<p>menstruation because it is a normal</p>
<p>process is it excessive and do you have</p>
<p>cramping</p>
<p>that usually means you need to increase</p>
<p>more maybe calcium magnesium before your</p>
<p>period</p>
<p>um and also it could you could be</p>
<p>estrogen dominant in which case you need</p>
<p>more iodine from sea kelp so the</p>
<p>combination of CCAP will help the</p>
<p>periods greatly and then of course as</p>
<p>far as food goes you can get your iodine</p>
<p>from shellfish</p>
<p>um and then um the calcium from dairy</p>
<p>unless you have some problem with dairy</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s a high quality Dairy</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so um to help with um</p>
<p>the periods and with estrogen dominant</p>
<p>sometimes you need to avoid Dairy so you</p>
<p>have to look at that as well but some of</p>
<p>the estrogen might be coming from soy</p>
<p>um could be coming from alcohol wine</p>
<p>because that will increase estrogen men</p>
<p>and women</p>
<p>um are you taking birth control pills</p>
<p>are you taking HRT</p>
<p>um maybe avoid these factors that</p>
<p>increase</p>
<p>estrogen which can actually make the</p>
<p>period worse</p>
<p>right very good let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um Christopher&rsquo;s vegetables can help</p>
<p>reduce estrogen too</p>
<p>um just so you know they kind of</p>
<p>regulate be good and bad so they kind of</p>
<p>will normalize that that level very good</p>
<p>well Jane and all the other lovely</p>
<p>ladies around the world I hope that uh</p>
<p>helps understand that okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>Juliana from Facebook this time is</p>
<p>turkey tail mushroom powder okay to take</p>
<p>during a prolonged fast is she going to</p>
<p>get overweight from turkey tail mushroom</p>
<p>powder no that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s fine that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually really good for both cancer</p>
<p>especially cancer anti-cancer and your</p>
<p>cognitive function so yeah go ahead and</p>
<p>take some of that when you&rsquo;re fasting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be a problem at all</p>
<p>right now Larissa from YouTube she had a</p>
<p>miscarriage unfortunately in January but</p>
<p>it was an unplanned pregnancy I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>trying to conceive since but I have had</p>
<p>no luck what protocols would you</p>
<p>recommend for someone trying to conceive</p>
<p>I would watch my videos on fertility</p>
<p>with women and uh</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s probably the most important</p>
<p>time to eat healthy is during the</p>
<p>pregnancy I would prepare your body</p>
<p>um and get your body very fertile so a</p>
<p>couple key nutrients for that would be</p>
<p>the vitamin E in the form of tocotranals</p>
<p>good amounts of Omega-3 good amounts of</p>
<p>vitamin D the trace minerals for sure</p>
<p>and even</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that royal jelly uh that that bees make</p>
<p>apparently that&rsquo;s also good for</p>
<p>fertility</p>
<p>um and then also you know there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of things in your environment that are</p>
<p>um making people sterile</p>
<p>um including the GMO Foods there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting observation by</p>
<p>a scientist that I recently talked to</p>
<p>um on animals and veterinarians are</p>
<p>noticed that the fertility of animals</p>
<p>goes down when you feed them just</p>
<p>regular</p>
<p>genetically modified food versus the</p>
<p>non-GMO food</p>
<p>um increases the the fertility which is</p>
<p>fascinating which the question is does</p>
<p>that roll over to humans well it just</p>
<p>might</p>
<p>um and then also all the Plastics that</p>
<p>can mimic estrogen in our environment</p>
<p>too Plastics like</p>
<p>uh that&rsquo;s in a lot of different foods so</p>
<p>watch my videos on that and um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s a really uh a big deal</p>
<p>too for men and women</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see the second question very</p>
<p>compelling if cortisol is an</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory why do high levels of</p>
<p>cortisol in our body lead to</p>
<p>inflammation very good question the</p>
<p>audience has answered it ninety percent</p>
<p>of them say it&rsquo;s because cholesterol</p>
<p>that results from stress contributes to</p>
<p>the inflammation 10 of the respondents</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s because high levels of sugar or</p>
<p>carbs that influence the impact of</p>
<p>cortisol are we onto something</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not on something with those two</p>
<p>answers unfortunately but um here here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what happens when you have high level of</p>
<p>stress you get high level of cortisol</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a normal anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>um but</p>
<p>um chronic stress is not healthy and</p>
<p>cortisol in high amounts is also not</p>
<p>healthy if it&rsquo;s prolonged because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unnatural and uh our bodies were</p>
<p>designed for short bursts of high stress</p>
<p>not like chronic stress so as a</p>
<p>protected mechanism the body</p>
<p>um starts to downgrade The receptors and</p>
<p>and creates this condition called</p>
<p>cortisol</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>which means that the receptors are not</p>
<p>receiving cortisol like they were so</p>
<p>when you have high levels of stress you</p>
<p>end up believe it or not with a</p>
<p>deficiency of cortisol if you just take</p>
<p>a look at all the different symptoms</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>that cortisol</p>
<p>um too much cortisol can create</p>
<p>um and that&rsquo;s because you have this</p>
<p>resistance going on uh why because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through too much stress so</p>
<p>this is why when you fix stress the</p>
<p>receptor becomes more receptive</p>
<p>uh cortisol now works and now your</p>
<p>inflammation can be a lot less</p>
<p>all right very very good okay why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we go to New York to</p>
<p>um Nia and she&rsquo;s on the phone with us</p>
<p>today Nia are you with us</p>
<p>here she comes</p>
<p>go ahead Nia</p>
<p>Nia I tell you what you might be in a</p>
<p>bad Cell Song so we&rsquo;re going to give you</p>
<p>a few minutes to figure that out and in</p>
<p>the meantime let&rsquo;s go to very close Nera</p>
<p>who is in Chicago and near I can see her</p>
<p>dutifully unmuting herself to be a</p>
<p>perfect guess with her one question in</p>
<p>30 seconds and they&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re wrong with</p>
<p>Dr Bird go ahead</p>
<p>hi thank you so much for having me on um</p>
<p>I am I have Hashimoto&rsquo;s so I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following your protocols you have on you</p>
<p>know the diet the time restricted eating</p>
<p>um and avoiding gluten so my one</p>
<p>question is</p>
<p>um while in a perfect world I would</p>
<p>avoid gluten all my life but um I do</p>
<p>have vacations planned and things like</p>
<p>that so I am wondering is it better just</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>um eat it once in a while you know um</p>
<p>sporadically or is it better to kind of</p>
<p>have your body used to it a little bit</p>
<p>and eat it um more frequently so</p>
<p>um you know I I I&rsquo;m on on centroid and I</p>
<p>wanted to</p>
<p>um stop it so I&rsquo;m just kind of learning</p>
<p>trying to figure out the protocols of</p>
<p>what to do</p>
<p>um in regards to that yeah so if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about gluten and what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>occurring with glutenant apparently it</p>
<p>has to do with something called</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>molecular mimicry which basically gluten</p>
<p>kind of mimics some of the antibodies to</p>
<p>the thyroid</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll it can create a mistake</p>
<p>and when you have gluten it can you can</p>
<p>have more antibodies that&rsquo;s self</p>
<p>antibody so your body is actually</p>
<p>attacking your own thyroid</p>
<p>um so that creates inflammation</p>
<p>so the question is should you have it a</p>
<p>little bit all the time or should you</p>
<p>have it just um once in a while the</p>
<p>answer is you shouldn&rsquo;t even have it at</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>um I you know I did been doing a lot of</p>
<p>DNA testing on people just to look at</p>
<p>what their DNA says</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just shocked how many people had a</p>
<p>very high percentage of um</p>
<p>gluten intolerance from a DNA level but</p>
<p>because gluten</p>
<p>is a complex of proteins and some of the</p>
<p>proteins in there and by the way gluten</p>
<p>is the only protein that our body can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>digest so</p>
<p>um it creates problems but one of the</p>
<p>parts of that gluten gliadines it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called Uh actually increases uh</p>
<p>or stimulates an opioid receptor in our</p>
<p>in our which actually is kind of like a</p>
<p>little dose of morphine so we actually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel any negative effects at least</p>
<p>in our gut when we eat it and we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>wow I think we&rsquo;re okay I can eat that</p>
<p>but it can create other problems like</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>probably the thing to focus on is just</p>
<p>to you know replace gluten completely</p>
<p>and then also do selenium as a mineral</p>
<p>Trace mineral not terrible large amounts</p>
<p>but just you can get that in uh</p>
<p>shellfish uh oysters especially or sea</p>
<p>kelp and then or Brazil nuts but all you</p>
<p>really need is like one Brazil nut a day</p>
<p>because that</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s grown in a certain part of the</p>
<p>Amazon that has very high levels of</p>
<p>selenium</p>
<p>thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry I&rsquo;m sorry baby</p>
<p>um yeah</p>
<p>yeah I kind of knew that</p>
<p>what a bummer sorry Nera</p>
<p>um like a part I ruined the parties yeah</p>
<p>absolutely all right I&rsquo;ll have a donut</p>
<p>in your honor Nera and then buzz buzz</p>
<p>kill so come to the sickness uh just to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>placate you so anyway thank you for</p>
<p>another great call having spit out the</p>
<p>question quickly and we hate to keep</p>
<p>harping on that but we have so many</p>
<p>wonderful things going on in the show so</p>
<p>we really appreciate your help in that</p>
<p>regard Green Room participants uh and to</p>
<p>prove that we want we love everyone</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go back to face excuse me to</p>
<p>social media</p>
<p>uh and Gina from Facebook wants to know</p>
<p>if cruciferous veggies block the</p>
<p>functions of the thyroid hormone</p>
<p>speaking of Hashimoto&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um they do contain something called</p>
<p>goidering gordogens and they tend to</p>
<p>block iodine</p>
<p>um if you have large amounts without</p>
<p>enough dietary iodine and since a lot of</p>
<p>people have an iodine deficiency</p>
<p>especially an average person who doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>consume Seafood enough it could</p>
<p>potentially be a problem if you eat a</p>
<p>lot of it but if you&rsquo;re eating regular</p>
<p>amounts I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>a problem at all even like eggs will</p>
<p>give you a good amount of iodine but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the sometimes people take it out of</p>
<p>context of course if you have a goiter</p>
<p>you know like don&rsquo;t consume cruciferous</p>
<p>but on the flip side look at all the</p>
<p>positive things about cruciferous that</p>
<p>it has sulforaphane and like that it can</p>
<p>help you with cancer and a lot of</p>
<p>phytonutrients that can help balance</p>
<p>your estrogen and help you detoxify</p>
<p>things there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits and</p>
<p>some drawbacks so</p>
<p>um one quick solution just to have a</p>
<p>little sea calp in your diet on a</p>
<p>regular basis or consume some Shellfish</p>
<p>a couple times a week</p>
<p>all right very good all right next</p>
<p>question these are great questions if</p>
<p>something does this how come it does</p>
<p>that and here&rsquo;s the next one</p>
<p>okay if insulin lowers blood sugar</p>
<p>and carbohydrates increase insulin</p>
<p>then why does a high carb diet</p>
<p>then why do high carb diets lead to high</p>
<p>blood sugar</p>
<p>what the audience stare at that for a</p>
<p>second there you go and off you go with</p>
<p>a fabulous answer let&rsquo;s see if Ania is</p>
<p>with us again can you hear us Nia</p>
<p>I do apologize for earlier on that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great okay so Nia&rsquo;s coming to us on the</p>
<p>phone we can&rsquo;t see her lovely face but</p>
<p>go ahead Neo with your one question</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>oh sure okay good I&rsquo;m glad to hear that</p>
<p>hang on a second</p>
<p>um start talking and I&rsquo;ll bring your</p>
<p>image up as you do just a moment I got</p>
<p>to redo something</p>
<p>so grateful I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I live in New York City and I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following you for over two years</p>
<p>I have a YouTube channel and I post</p>
<p>regularly your videos and you have</p>
<p>inspired me to start my own</p>
<p>Healthy Living YouTube channel I started</p>
<p>yesterday love it</p>
<p>love it thank you thank you</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m a mother I have four children and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost 50 years old and has</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis for the past 21</p>
<p>years after I gave a birth to my first</p>
<p>child what kind of arthritis</p>
<p>who sell it for someone like me and I</p>
<p>have a busy life and I would love to</p>
<p>start keto constantly</p>
<p>thank you I mean I mean think about what</p>
<p>a ketone is it&rsquo;s a molecule that has a</p>
<p>very powerful</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory effect so right off</p>
<p>the bat uh decreasing inflammation is</p>
<p>going to be important with your</p>
<p>condition and then there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>other factors that you should know about</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis that I didn&rsquo;t do a</p>
<p>video on well I did one but not the</p>
<p>other one one is high levels of</p>
<p>potassium so that would be a ketogenic</p>
<p>plan with a lot of salad or vegetables</p>
<p>right so you want to keep that in them</p>
<p>to get the potassium</p>
<p>um but also</p>
<p>um taking enough vitamin D is going to</p>
<p>be vital for you probably at a very</p>
<p>minimum 20 000 I use a day and the other</p>
<p>thing too is um there&rsquo;s another factor</p>
<p>with rheumatoid arthritis and I stumbled</p>
<p>on this I didn&rsquo;t do a video on it yet</p>
<p>and it has a lot to do with high levels</p>
<p>of uh people with rheumatoid have higher</p>
<p>levels of adrenaline in their body</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>one one thing just to put more attention</p>
<p>on is this thing called stress so</p>
<p>anything you can do to reduce stress not</p>
<p>that you have ever experienced stressed</p>
<p>in your life but anything you do to keep</p>
<p>the stress out of your body uh regular</p>
<p>exercise walking whatever is going to be</p>
<p>very therapeutic to you especially for</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis but yeah just do</p>
<p>the healthy version of Keto um like I</p>
<p>mentioned with a lot of vegetables and I</p>
<p>think if we also add in there some</p>
<p>periodic prolonged fasting like 72 hour</p>
<p>fasting we can literally rebuild your</p>
<p>immune system and who knows might put</p>
<p>that thing back in remission</p>
<p>wonderful thank you so much I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>actually eating more vegetables more</p>
<p>fruit and staying away from junk food I</p>
<p>try to remove and processed food</p>
<p>completely for my diet and I&rsquo;m teaching</p>
<p>my children the same so much so much</p>
<p>gratitude I have towards you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thank you that&rsquo;s awesome and I just want</p>
<p>to add one little tiny little detail</p>
<p>about the fruit</p>
<p>um yes the only fruit I would have is be</p>
<p>some berries but I&rsquo;ll just give you a</p>
<p>little example</p>
<p>um I could just take a banana there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of fructose in a banana and people</p>
<p>say what&rsquo;s wrong with that lonely banana</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s been a hybrid so we it</p>
<p>definitely spiked a lot of the um sugars</p>
<p>in these fruits so</p>
<p>um berries are the one of the lowest</p>
<p>sugars so these other fruits even</p>
<p>especially the apples are just way too</p>
<p>much sugar and</p>
<p>um I have some great data you know show</p>
<p>how that can really affect your body so</p>
<p>even even let&rsquo;s take myself right I</p>
<p>um I was eating healthy</p>
<p>what I thought a while ago and I weighed</p>
<p>211 pounds okay</p>
<p>um 211 pounds and</p>
<p>what I decided to do is I cut out the</p>
<p>apples okay that&rsquo;s all I changed that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it and</p>
<p>um I went down to 185 wow okay not just</p>
<p>a fruit that&rsquo;s considered healthy it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of fructose so it&rsquo;s just another</p>
<p>example I have firsthand knowledge that</p>
<p>fruit isn&rsquo;t always what it&rsquo;s cracked up</p>
<p>to be</p>
<p>stopped eating banana because it upset</p>
<p>my stomach so sometimes they say listen</p>
<p>to your body is trying to tell you</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>bananas and I will reduce Apple because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of my favorite fruits thank you</p>
<p>so much doctor you&rsquo;re welcome you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome it&rsquo;s wonderful what a great</p>
<p>guest thank you so much uh Nia from Buzz</p>
<p>curious I&rsquo;m a buzz kill yeah you know I</p>
<p>did a fishing show in Belize and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the banana capitals of the world</p>
<p>and you know the through the town</p>
<p>bananas just sort of litter the gutters</p>
<p>because they pick them extraordinarily</p>
<p>green of course and let them ripen up</p>
<p>but a ripe banana from Belize is almost</p>
<p>unedible in my mind it is so sweet it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s filled with Splenda and it</p>
<p>just that I guess that&rsquo;s the genetic way</p>
<p>they modify but it&rsquo;s it it&rsquo;s like three</p>
<p>or four times as sweet if you let it I</p>
<p>guess you call it Vine ripen and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like it even with a sweet tooth</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ve really worked on all these</p>
<p>various things to bring them up to</p>
<p>um you know Cocoa Puffs sugar level I</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s terrible anyway thanks</p>
<p>again Nia all right let&rsquo;s see uh</p>
<p>uh where are we with our questions and</p>
<p>the audience is on it as usual and this</p>
<p>third question of the day asked if</p>
<p>insulin lowers blood sugar and carbs</p>
<p>increase insulin then why do high carb</p>
<p>diets lead to high blood sugars eighty</p>
<p>percent of the audience say it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>insulin resistance 20 say the glucose</p>
<p>and sugars are incorrectly stored</p>
<p>Okay so we&rsquo;ve we got a right answer on</p>
<p>this one because it&rsquo;s insulin resistance</p>
<p>same mechanism with the cortisol when</p>
<p>you increase</p>
<p>a hormone over time</p>
<p>above what it should be</p>
<p>um you start the body protects Itself by</p>
<p>going into this resistance day so now</p>
<p>you have a situation where you have a</p>
<p>insulin deficiency and I did a video on</p>
<p>that as well there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits</p>
<p>to insulin but not if you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance because you be you have all</p>
<p>the bad stuff from being too high</p>
<p>um and then you you lack all the good</p>
<p>stuff from penetrating the cell allowing</p>
<p>it to work so with insulin resistance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when your blood sugars start to</p>
<p>go higher as a way of compensating for</p>
<p>that resistance that&rsquo;s developed at the</p>
<p>cellular level</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done probably more videos on</p>
<p>insulin resistance than anyone on the</p>
<p>internet because I</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s in probably one of the biggest</p>
<p>problems in our world right now</p>
<p>um not just in America but all over the</p>
<p>place uh even in the Arabic countries</p>
<p>um believe it or not</p>
<p>in the Arabic countries they do a lot of</p>
<p>sugar even more than Africa so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>becoming more of a problem</p>
<p>ouch all right World get it together</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see oh Dana from YouTube</p>
<p>and this is a prevalent thing</p>
<p>unfortunately could you please produce</p>
<p>more videos on how to improve behavior</p>
<p>in autistic kids</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>I can do videos on how to</p>
<p>nutritionally in diet wise</p>
<p>improve that condition for sure so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>making a note right now and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good idea and just as a side note</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve just read a study another</p>
<p>study on</p>
<p>sulforaphane can greatly benefit autism</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s in the uh the micro green so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be releasing a course very</p>
<p>soon on how to grow your own micro</p>
<p>greens for pennies</p>
<p>um right inside your house so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even have to go out and buy them you</p>
<p>could grow them yourself and that&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>fun so and basically grow your your own</p>
<p>salad with and micro greens are probably</p>
<p>at the top of the food chain as far as</p>
<p>the most nutrient dense food</p>
<p>um now of course organ meats are are</p>
<p>higher but on the plant family I mean</p>
<p>you have like massive amounts of</p>
<p>nutrients um way more than the adult</p>
<p>vegetable so</p>
<p>more on that soon</p>
<p>I did very good in audience I I want to</p>
<p>let you know how important if anyone</p>
<p>feels ignored on social media uh we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not ignoring you you know there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many questions we try to get to as many</p>
<p>as we can but Dr Berg doesn&rsquo;t ignore it</p>
<p>all your comments are as you just</p>
<p>noticed are the fodder for many of his</p>
<p>videos so he wants to know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>affecting people around the world and</p>
<p>from it why talk about stuff that has no</p>
<p>uh you know</p>
<p>pertinence to what&rsquo;s going on in the</p>
<p>world so please keep them coming I know</p>
<p>he Scrolls through them well beyond what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to read on the air so you are</p>
<p>heard and he answers your various</p>
<p>queries into what&rsquo;s going on uh with uh</p>
<p>us our individuals</p>
<p>yes to see that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s why a lot</p>
<p>of people say well he just created a</p>
<p>video for me how did he know about that</p>
<p>well because I&rsquo;ve read your comments</p>
<p>um I I know what um what videos people</p>
<p>want so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s basically what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to do is find out what video you</p>
<p>want and then create that video</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s working uh there&rsquo;s so many of</p>
<p>them out there KB from Facebook please</p>
<p>share your thoughts on how to treat</p>
<p>liver cancer without going through</p>
<p>chemotherapy I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that KGB</p>
<p>for you or</p>
<p>um or your loved ones</p>
<p>now of course I can&rsquo;t cure anything only</p>
<p>the body cures itself but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>protocol you can watch the latest videos</p>
<p>on the cancer just to get information on</p>
<p>what what I would do if I had the cancer</p>
<p>and um maybe that can help you but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a protocol and but I will say</p>
<p>the most important thing you can do as a</p>
<p>weapon against cancer is the fast</p>
<p>long fast like I&rsquo;m talking at least</p>
<p>depending on the severity</p>
<p>um probably 20 21 days or longer</p>
<p>hopefully you have some</p>
<p>some extra fat to use as fuel but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most important thing so the more</p>
<p>severe the cancer the more severe the</p>
<p>health problem the longer you should</p>
<p>fast that&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>information you need to know and</p>
<p>unfortunately some people don&rsquo;t even do</p>
<p>it so they try all these other things</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not as powerful you have to</p>
<p>the level of effort needs to match</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in your body and even</p>
<p>in fasting in general not even just for</p>
<p>cancer</p>
<p>um you know I&rsquo;ve talked about prolonged</p>
<p>fasting for like a week for example</p>
<p>um ideally everyone should do that but</p>
<p>maybe if you&rsquo;re if you are healthy and</p>
<p>you have no problems maybe probably a</p>
<p>better recommendation to be like do</p>
<p>seven day fast once a year</p>
<p>not several times a year</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re sick you should be doing</p>
<p>it several times a year</p>
<p>why because when you start to fast the</p>
<p>body goes into all these fascinating</p>
<p>survival mechanism things that</p>
<p>um turn off genes that are activating</p>
<p>cancer and tumors and it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like your body goes in this fascinating</p>
<p>um healing mode and then you also go in</p>
<p>autophagy where your body&rsquo;s cleaning up</p>
<p>um old damaged cells and rejuvenating</p>
<p>them as you sleep at night so</p>
<p>like I said before</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about autophagy a lot of the</p>
<p>autophagy happens in the brain when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sleeping and so you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>this renewed</p>
<p>brain cells of the mitochondria when you</p>
<p>wake up you have new mitochondria that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>ideally the way that you know that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s working is when you wake up and</p>
<p>you feel refreshed in your head versus</p>
<p>oh my gosh I feel like I&rsquo;ve kind of hung</p>
<p>over and I&rsquo;m it takes me forever to wake</p>
<p>up so</p>
<p>that means that you got to work on that</p>
<p>so anyway it&rsquo;s a good indication to know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on all right very good uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Fatima thank you so much for</p>
<p>spending so time in the green room and</p>
<p>being our final uh guest and if you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re unmuted we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get you right on for your one question</p>
<p>in 30 seconds with Dr Berg welcome to</p>
<p>the show</p>
<p>hi welcome Dr Berg thank you so much I</p>
<p>feel really humbled to be uh live</p>
<p>um I can&rsquo;t thank you enough I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>grateful to you Dr Berg only started</p>
<p>following you um not a long time ago</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>um I believe it&rsquo;s Hashimoto and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been 20 years I&rsquo;m on medication uh also</p>
<p>had a postpartum depression twice after</p>
<p>having my two children so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>antidepressants and sleeping tablets</p>
<p>um the issue is um I mean I started an</p>
<p>intermittent fasting I stopped gluten</p>
<p>dairy and and like through fruits</p>
<p>because I used to believe that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>healthy</p>
<p>um but the thing is I lost so much</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s one um one one side to it and</p>
<p>it just had a banding to hemorrhoids</p>
<p>bending operation</p>
<p>um and what&rsquo;s your video videos which</p>
<p>helped me a lot because I suffer from</p>
<p>constipation you mentioned taking</p>
<p>vitamin B1 I&rsquo;m taking sea cup and</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve just got the um bladder not</p>
<p>bladder support the extra strength</p>
<p>gallbladder formula</p>
<p>but the thing is I developed a pain on</p>
<p>the right hand side then which which is</p>
<p>under investigation I just had a blood</p>
<p>test done today so I just wanted to ask</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>um on first how to</p>
<p>um obviously the keto diet I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>um I only started following you recently</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much knowledge on how to</p>
<p>fully in like</p>
<p>um do it so to help get off the</p>
<p>medication and improve my condition and</p>
<p>also to the uh your supplements the fact</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m taking them and it just felt</p>
<p>like the pain is aggravated in case um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gold stones or something hard to</p>
<p>tackle that</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a lot to take in but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>give you some tips okay because</p>
<p>um I think you&rsquo;re in the phase of</p>
<p>getting started but now you need some</p>
<p>some Simplicity and then fill in the</p>
<p>details later</p>
<p>um the fact that you have pain in the</p>
<p>right lower side tells tells me that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you definitely need to tweak the</p>
<p>diet and there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating either bloating or it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>agreeing with your systems I think the</p>
<p>most important thing even more than the</p>
<p>nutrients or vitamins or anything</p>
<p>is just to work out what to eat now to</p>
<p>keep it really simple the more problems</p>
<p>with you have your that you have with</p>
<p>your digestion and by the way a lot of</p>
<p>autoimmune including Hashimoto&rsquo;s starts</p>
<p>in the gut so chances are there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>inflammation in there you want to keep</p>
<p>your Foods fairly simple and not have a</p>
<p>lot of different combinations of things</p>
<p>like maybe eat one meal just two things</p>
<p>like a salad</p>
<p>and maybe eggs or fish okay good and</p>
<p>then the next meal have</p>
<p>tuna and um a different type of</p>
<p>vegetable keep it really simple don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>add a lot of things in there like the</p>
<p>grains and this and that or fruits or</p>
<p>berries or nuts and just keep it real</p>
<p>simple because we have to isolate what</p>
<p>is bloating you there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating that&rsquo;s creating digestive stress</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;ll probably do better on more</p>
<p>fermented foods like um sauerkraut uh</p>
<p>pickles</p>
<p>and maybe even kefir maybe not test that</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>constipation tells me that we need to</p>
<p>build up your Flora your good gut uh</p>
<p>bacteria over time</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>you know get my book read the details</p>
<p>keep tweaking it but it&rsquo;s going to take</p>
<p>some time to figure this out but you</p>
<p>want to keep the carbs down and who</p>
<p>knows you may find that you get the best</p>
<p>benefit by holding off on vegetables and</p>
<p>nuts and seeds right now and just doing</p>
<p>more of a carnivore I don&rsquo;t know because</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s inflammation in your gut you</p>
<p>just might find that that takes the</p>
<p>bloating away so these are things you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to figure out and test</p>
<p>because unfortunately</p>
<p>um the doctors are not going to look at</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to treat your</p>
<p>condition versus look at your eating</p>
<p>which needs to be</p>
<p>solved immediately okay in Fatima I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t mean to cut you off but we I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got a couple quiz questions left but we</p>
<p>would love to hear back from you there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a whole bunch of stuff to try and do as</p>
<p>everyone else&rsquo;s encouraged write us uh</p>
<p>you know drburg.com and also on social</p>
<p>media so we wish you all the best and</p>
<p>hope to see you back on the show again</p>
<p>uh after you&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>so was there just one one last question</p>
<p>that you you&rsquo;re going to ask about that</p>
<p>or clarification</p>
<p>um Ashley</p>
<p>um you know what you just said I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually what I was thinking</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um like the grains I was on um I caught</p>
<p>on carbs completely I was just taking</p>
<p>something called keto bread which is</p>
<p>made out of grains and have been nuts</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s uh I mean you I mean</p>
<p>you just tackle the point that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>suspecting that&rsquo;s um causing the problem</p>
<p>the constipation</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m also doing intermittent fasting</p>
<p>so but like you said it&rsquo;s just working</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>um what&rsquo;s triggering it um and I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched your video about the uh the uh</p>
<p>having too much fiber and because I</p>
<p>believe that having</p>
<p>um you know especially greens and lots</p>
<p>of vegetables that kind of made the</p>
<p>aggravated the constipation so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>absolutely right about that I agree with</p>
<p>that thank you Doctor yep you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>and um yeah so a lot of these uh key</p>
<p>so-called keto friendly stuff</p>
<p>kind of does not help people I would I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>hesitant of having anyone do that just</p>
<p>eat regular healthy foods and make sure</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re low carb and I think um that</p>
<p>would be the best advice for anyone but</p>
<p>great okay Steve all right</p>
<p>so kind I&rsquo;m giving people the hook it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awful but I love them all we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>trying to keep up with the clock but</p>
<p>those were some great guests today and</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve also had some great questions</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s our fourth question of the day</p>
<p>okay what is the most important Trace</p>
<p>mineral to prevent hair loss</p>
<p>all right I know a lot of people want to</p>
<p>know that</p>
<p>including myself</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see now why don&rsquo;t we go</p>
<p>back to social media London sky from</p>
<p>YouTube could you please post a video on</p>
<p>what you eat in a given week There&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good question</p>
<p>sure yeah</p>
<p>one because I I like to change things uh</p>
<p>but I will say um one thing that I</p>
<p>really enjoying lately is that</p>
<p>yeah we have the uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no longer winter so we can start</p>
<p>growing things so I&rsquo;m growing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>some salad that&rsquo;s very very it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>typical salad it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>type of salad I&rsquo;ll do a video on this</p>
<p>that uh</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just amazing how what a</p>
<p>difference that salad is versus the</p>
<p>grocery store salad I mean it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>night and day</p>
<p>um unfortunately the majority of salad</p>
<p>that you buy in the grocery store is</p>
<p>either hydroponic or grown in</p>
<p>these sponge type mediums that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>even soil or if they are grown in soil</p>
<p>they only do the NPK the three minerals</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um to actually have food that&rsquo;s grown in</p>
<p>biologically live soil</p>
<p>is I think the answer to health because</p>
<p>uh it also comes all this health comes</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s animal Foods or plant</p>
<p>has to come from the biology and the</p>
<p>soil and if you have good soils then you</p>
<p>can actually grow good health through</p>
<p>the foods that for that live off this</p>
<p>these microbes so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s the basic on the chain of</p>
<p>events it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what soil are you growing you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>your food from it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s impossible to</p>
<p>know that</p>
<p>um so this is why you need to start a</p>
<p>garden</p>
<p>Steve all right well I&rsquo;m listen we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>waiting and maybe you&rsquo;ve already done it</p>
<p>but that indoor garden thing Lori and I</p>
<p>are just wringing our hands waiting for</p>
<p>that uh to come aren&rsquo;t you going to do</p>
<p>or did you do a video on growing stuff</p>
<p>in like you know an apartment or</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>yeah and um we&rsquo;re gonna be showing how</p>
<p>to grow it in soil in your apartment yes</p>
<p>on the windowsill uh not hydroponic</p>
<p>um yes I do have several units that um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no longer using with hydroponic but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because it just could not produce the</p>
<p>fertility that we want in that plant so</p>
<p>I will there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of</p>
<p>videos on that but we&rsquo;re right in the</p>
<p>middle of a</p>
<p>creating this greenhouse to be able to</p>
<p>film everything and so I know I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>telling people that for a while but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been taking a long time to build this</p>
<p>greenhouse so we can actually do what we</p>
<p>want and do the research boy that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>fun we&rsquo;re waiting and excited about it</p>
<p>and the audience didn&rsquo;t wait on</p>
<p>answering this question thanks for</p>
<p>helping me keep up with the show folks</p>
<p>what is the most important Trace metal</p>
<p>mineral to prevent hair loss and the</p>
<p>audience said at least 65 percent of</p>
<p>them say it&rsquo;s zinc 30 say it&rsquo;s copper</p>
<p>and five percent say iodine</p>
<p>okay the answer is zinc</p>
<p>um but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>um too much zinc can be a problem and</p>
<p>not enough saying could be a problem so</p>
<p>if you have the right amounts let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh you know they say under 40</p>
<p>milligrams</p>
<p>um but if you have an autoimmune</p>
<p>condition or you have inflammation or</p>
<p>you have</p>
<p>some other reason why you need higher</p>
<p>amounts of zinc lets you have an</p>
<p>infection right a viral infection then</p>
<p>you need like</p>
<p>300 milligrams right</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s kind of a shorter</p>
<p>term thing when you have too much zinc</p>
<p>and not enough copper</p>
<p>um you can have the same almost the same</p>
<p>exact hair loss problems because you</p>
<p>need both zinc and copper so too much</p>
<p>they can because they&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>competitive so you want just the right</p>
<p>amount so what I do is I just recommend</p>
<p>getting your zinc and copper together in</p>
<p>One supplement as a ratio of one to ten</p>
<p>so that would be like one copper to ten</p>
<p>zinc so you want 10 times as much zinc</p>
<p>so if you had 10 milligrams of zinc</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have one milligram of copper but</p>
<p>if you eat food with copper or zinc it</p>
<p>always comes together in the right ratio</p>
<p>like organ Meats like the liver or even</p>
<p>um shellfish you&rsquo;re gonna get enough of</p>
<p>that those two minerals so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even have to worry about it</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>wonderful well that&rsquo;s a relieving let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to Facebook uh this is Brady uh</p>
<p>I recently increased my protein intake</p>
<p>to add muscle I have been consuming one</p>
<p>gram of protein per pound of body weight</p>
<p>I currently weigh 160 but now I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>experienced vertigo and dizziness is</p>
<p>there a relationship to the increase in</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>um well you know I don&rsquo;t know what else</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but you know you could overdo it when</p>
<p>you have too much protein you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>not going to feel quite right you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to back off a bit I like to</p>
<p>um like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like half carnivore and half vegan</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll do both of these things I&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>a lot of salad and I&rsquo;ll do a good amount</p>
<p>of protein but I I do know that I have</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>be careful sometimes because sometimes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have too much protein and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel quite right and uh maybe I</p>
<p>could even say I have dizziness so I</p>
<p>would play around with it and test it</p>
<p>test the waters and see how you do but</p>
<p>make sure you also include uh the</p>
<p>vegetables with that protein unless you</p>
<p>have a gut problem</p>
<p>um and I think that will help offset and</p>
<p>I think also I I recommend having the</p>
<p>vegetables first</p>
<p>um I have noticed that a lot of times</p>
<p>people that have them second they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>finish their salad or vegetables</p>
<p>um so that would be important and um</p>
<p>but the other key thing with protein is</p>
<p>to have the quality of protein eggs</p>
<p>Seafood grass-fed beef</p>
<p>um Meats things like that</p>
<p>um because</p>
<p>chicken isn&rsquo;t especially like the</p>
<p>regular chicken is not the best source</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>protein unless it&rsquo;s you know really</p>
<p>grown correctly</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m not saying not to have it but</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t only have that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like even sardines are really good I</p>
<p>like sardines and um</p>
<p>tuna and you can even get in a can while</p>
<p>caught and even the the wild cod liver</p>
<p>oil and I&rsquo;m sorry the wild Cod Liver</p>
<p>itself you can get that in a can that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually really really healthy</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s my answer and I&rsquo;m sticking to</p>
<p>it Steve all right I think we can get</p>
<p>one more question and JJ from Facebook</p>
<p>are there any benefits to drinking</p>
<p>carbonated water</p>
<p>I did a video on that there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>benefits you actually get more CO2 to</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>um you to get more oxygen it takes CO2</p>
<p>to release oxygen and so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really interesting benefit right there</p>
<p>um I always feel better I feel more</p>
<p>hydrated when I have carbonated water</p>
<p>um and so I make make my own with uh</p>
<p>spring water</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m lucky that way to do that but um</p>
<p>yeah I don&rsquo;t sometimes like water</p>
<p>sometimes when you buy this water in the</p>
<p>bottles it&rsquo;s just like there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not doing anything so uh</p>
<p>carbonation adds another factor to help</p>
<p>absorption and helps more oxygen and it</p>
<p>also decreases the pH a little bit so um</p>
<p>it might help your digestion on that</p>
<p>note Steve I really wanted to say thanks</p>
<p>for everyone I appreciate wonderful</p>
<p>attention that you&rsquo;re here this long and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sticking it out and stay tuned</p>
<p>for some fascinating new videos coming</p>
<p>up this next week have a great weekend</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
