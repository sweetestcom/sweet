    <p>The following is a conversation with Eric Schmidt.</p>
<p>He was the CEO of Google for 10 years</p>
<p>and a chairman for six more,</p>
<p>guiding the company through an incredible period of growth</p>
<p>and a series of world changing innovations.</p>
<p>He is one of the most impactful leaders</p>
<p>in the era of the internet and the powerful voice</p>
<p>for the promise of technology in our society.</p>
<p>It was truly an honor to speak with him</p>
<p>as part of the MIT course</p>
<p>on artificial general intelligence</p>
<p>and the artificial intelligence podcast.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Eric Schmidt.</p>
<p>What was the first moment</p>
<p>when you fell in love with technology?</p>
<p>I grew up in the 1960s as a boy</p>
<p>where every boy wanted to be an astronaut</p>
<p>and part of the space program.</p>
<p>So like everyone else of my age,</p>
<p>we would go out to the cow pasture behind my house,</p>
<p>which was literally a cow pasture</p>
<p>and we would shoot model rockets off.</p>
<p>And that I think is the beginning.</p>
<p>And of course, generationally today,</p>
<p>it would be video games and all the amazing things</p>
<p>that you can do online with computers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a transformative, inspiring aspect of science</p>
<p>and math that maybe rockets would bring</p>
<p>would instill in individuals.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned yesterday that eighth grade math</p>
<p>is where the journey through mathematical universe</p>
<p>diverges from many people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this fork in the roadway.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a professor of math at Berkeley, Edward Frankel.</p>
<p>He, I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with him.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>He has written this amazing book</p>
<p>I recommend to everybody called Love and Math.</p>
<p>Two of my favorite words.</p>
<p>He says that if painting was taught like math,</p>
<p>then the students would be asked to paint a fence,</p>
<p>which is his analogy of essentially how math is taught.</p>
<p>And so you never get a chance to discover the beauty</p>
<p>of the art of painting or the beauty of the art of math.</p>
<p>So how, when, and where did you discover that beauty?</p>
<p>I think what happens with people like myself</p>
<p>is that your math enabled pretty early</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you discover that you can use that</p>
<p>to discover new insights.</p>
<p>The great scientists will all tell a story,</p>
<p>the men and women who are fantastic today,</p>
<p>that somewhere when they were in high school or in college,</p>
<p>they discovered that they could discover</p>
<p>something themselves.</p>
<p>And that sense of building something,</p>
<p>of having an impact that you own,</p>
<p>drives knowledge acquisition and learning.</p>
<p>In my case, it was programming.</p>
<p>And the notion that I could build things</p>
<p>that had not existed that I had built,</p>
<p>that it had my name on it.</p>
<p>And this was before open source,</p>
<p>but you could think of it as open source contributions.</p>
<p>So today, if I were a 16 or 17 year old boy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that I would aspire as a computer scientist</p>
<p>to make a contribution like the open source heroes</p>
<p>of the world today.</p>
<p>That would be what would be driving me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be trying and learning and making mistakes</p>
<p>and so forth in the ways that it works.</p>
<p>The repository that GitHub represents</p>
<p>and that open source libraries represent</p>
<p>is an enormous bank of knowledge</p>
<p>of all of the people who are doing that.</p>
<p>And one of the lessons that I learned at Google</p>
<p>was that the world is a very big place</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an awful lot of smart people.</p>
<p>And an awful lot of them are underutilized.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an opportunity, for example,</p>
<p>building parts of programs, building new ideas</p>
<p>to contribute to the greater of society.</p>
<p>So in that moment in the 70s,</p>
<p>the inspiring moment where there was nothing</p>
<p>and then you created something through programming,</p>
<p>that magical moment.</p>
<p>So in 1975, I think you&rsquo;ve created a program called Lex,</p>
<p>which I especially like because my name is Lex.</p>
<p>So thank you, thank you for creating a brand</p>
<p>that established a reputation that&rsquo;s long lasting, reliable</p>
<p>and has a big impact on the world and still used today.</p>
<p>So thank you for that.</p>
<p>But more seriously, in that time, in the 70s,</p>
<p>as an engineer, personal computers were being born.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;d be able to predict the 80s, 90s</p>
<p>and the aughts of where computers would go?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I could not and would not have gotten it right.</p>
<p>I was the beneficiary of the great work</p>
<p>of many, many people who saw it clearer than I did.</p>
<p>With Lex, I worked with a fellow named Michael Lesk,</p>
<p>who was my supervisor.</p>
<p>And he essentially helped me architect</p>
<p>and deliver a system that&rsquo;s still in use today.</p>
<p>After that, I worked at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center,</p>
<p>where the Alto was invented.</p>
<p>And the Alto is the predecessor</p>
<p>of the modern personal computer or Macintosh and so forth.</p>
<p>And the Altos were very rare.</p>
<p>And I had to drive an hour from Berkeley to go use them.</p>
<p>But I made a point of skipping classes</p>
<p>and doing whatever it took to have access</p>
<p>to this extraordinary achievement.</p>
<p>I knew that they were consequential.</p>
<p>What I did not understand was scaling.</p>
<p>I did not understand what would happen</p>
<p>when you had 100 million as opposed to 100.</p>
<p>And so the, since then,</p>
<p>and I have learned the benefit of scale,</p>
<p>I always look for things</p>
<p>which are going to scale to platforms, right?</p>
<p>So mobile phones, Android, all those things.</p>
<p>There are, the world is in numerous,</p>
<p>there are many, many people in the world,</p>
<p>people really have needs.</p>
<p>They really will use these platforms</p>
<p>and you can build big businesses on top of them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So when you see a piece of technology,</p>
<p>now you think, what will this technology look like</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s in the hands of a billion people?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So an example would be that the market is so competitive now</p>
<p>that if you can&rsquo;t figure out a way</p>
<p>for something to have a million users or a billion users,</p>
<p>it probably is not going to be successful</p>
<p>because something else will become the general platform</p>
<p>and your idea will become a lost idea</p>
<p>or a specialized service with relatively few users.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a path to generality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a path to general platform use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a path to broad applicability.</p>
<p>Now there are plenty of good businesses that are tiny.</p>
<p>So luxury goods, for example.</p>
<p>But if you want to have an impact at scale,</p>
<p>you have to look for things which are of common value,</p>
<p>common pricing, common distribution</p>
<p>and solve common problems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re problems that everyone has.</p>
<p>And by the way, people have lots of problems.</p>
<p>Information, medicine, health, education and so forth.</p>
<p>Work on those problems.</p>
<p>Like you said, you&rsquo;re a big fan of the middle class.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s so many of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many of them.</p>
<p>By definition.</p>
<p>So any product, any thing that has a huge impact</p>
<p>and improves their lives is a great business decision</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just good for society.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with starting off in the high end</p>
<p>as long as you have a plan to get to the middle class.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with starting with a specialized</p>
<p>market in order to learn and to build and to fund things.</p>
<p>So you start with a luxury market</p>
<p>to build a general purpose market.</p>
<p>But if you define yourself as only a narrow market,</p>
<p>someone else can come along with a general purpose market</p>
<p>that can push you to the corner,</p>
<p>can restrict the scale of operation,</p>
<p>can force you to be a lesser impact than you might be.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important to think in terms of broad businesses</p>
<p>and broad impact.</p>
<p>Even if you start in a little corner somewhere.</p>
<p>So as you look to the 70s but also in the decades to come</p>
<p>and you saw computers, did you see them as tools</p>
<p>or was there a little element of another entity?</p>
<p>I remember a quote saying AI began with our dream</p>
<p>to create the gods.</p>
<p>Is there a feeling when you wrote that program</p>
<p>that you were creating another entity,</p>
<p>giving life to something?</p>
<p>I wish I could say otherwise,</p>
<p>but I simply found the technology platforms so exciting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was focused on.</p>
<p>I think the majority of the people that I&rsquo;ve worked with,</p>
<p>and there are a few exceptions, Steve Jobs being an example,</p>
<p>really saw this as a great technological play.</p>
<p>I think relatively few of the technical people understood</p>
<p>the scale of its impact.</p>
<p>So I used NCP, which is a predecessor to TCPIP.</p>
<p>It just made sense to connect things.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t think of it in terms of the internet</p>
<p>and then companies and then Facebook and then Twitter</p>
<p>and then politics and so forth.</p>
<p>We never did that build.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have that vision.</p>
<p>And I think most people, it&rsquo;s a rare person</p>
<p>who can see compounding at scale.</p>
<p>Most people can see,</p>
<p>if you ask people to predict the future,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll give you an answer of six to nine months</p>
<p>or 12 months,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s about as far as people can imagine.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an old saying,</p>
<p>which actually was attributed to a professor at MIT</p>
<p>a long time ago,</p>
<p>that we overestimate what can be done in one year</p>
<p>and we underestimate what can be done in a decade.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a great deal of evidence</p>
<p>that these core platforms at hardware and software</p>
<p>take a decade, right?</p>
<p>So think about self driving cars.</p>
<p>Self driving cars were thought about in the 90s.</p>
<p>There were projects around them.</p>
<p>The first DARPA Grand Challenge was roughly 2004.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s roughly 15 years ago.</p>
<p>And today we have self driving cars operating</p>
<p>in a city in Arizona, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 15 years and we still have a ways to go</p>
<p>before they&rsquo;re more generally available.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve spoken about the importance,</p>
<p>you just talked about predicting into the future.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken about the importance of thinking</p>
<p>five years ahead and having a plan for those five years.</p>
<p>The way to say it is that almost everybody</p>
<p>has a one year plan.</p>
<p>Almost no one has a proper five year plan.</p>
<p>And the key thing to having a five year plan</p>
<p>is to having a model for what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>under the underlying platforms.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s Law as we know it,</p>
<p>the thing that powered improvements in CPUs</p>
<p>has largely halted in its traditional shrinking mechanism</p>
<p>because the costs have just gotten so high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s plenty of algorithmic improvements</p>
<p>and specialized hardware improvements.</p>
<p>So you need to understand the nature of those improvements</p>
<p>and where they&rsquo;ll go in order to understand</p>
<p>how it will change the platform.</p>
<p>In the area of network connectivity,</p>
<p>what are the gains that are gonna be possible in wireless?</p>
<p>It looks like there&rsquo;s an enormous expansion</p>
<p>of wireless connectivity at many different bands.</p>
<p>And that we will primarily,</p>
<p>historically I&rsquo;ve always thought</p>
<p>that we were primarily gonna be using fiber,</p>
<p>but now it looks like we&rsquo;re gonna be using fiber</p>
<p>plus very powerful high bandwidth</p>
<p>sort of short distance connectivity</p>
<p>to bridge the last mile.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an amazing achievement.</p>
<p>If you know that,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna build your systems differently.</p>
<p>By the way, those networks</p>
<p>have different latency properties, right?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re more symmetric,</p>
<p>the algorithms feel faster for that reason.</p>
<p>And so when you think about whether it&rsquo;s a fiber</p>
<p>or just technologies in general,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s this barber wooden poem or quote</p>
<p>that I really like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from the champions of the impossible</p>
<p>rather than the slaves of the possible</p>
<p>that evolution draws its creative force.</p>
<p>So in predicting the next five years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about the impossible and the possible.</p>
<p>Well, and again, one of the great things about humanity</p>
<p>is that we produce dreamers, right?</p>
<p>We literally have people who have a vision and a dream.</p>
<p>They are, if you will, disagreeable</p>
<p>in the sense that they disagree with the,</p>
<p>they disagree with what the sort of zeitgeist is.</p>
<p>They say there is another way.</p>
<p>They have a belief, they have a vision.</p>
<p>If you look at science, science is always marked</p>
<p>by such people who went against some conventional wisdom,</p>
<p>collected the knowledge at the time</p>
<p>and assembled it in a way that produced a powerful platform.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve been amazingly honest about,</p>
<p>in an inspiring way, about things you&rsquo;ve been wrong</p>
<p>about predicting and you&rsquo;ve obviously been right</p>
<p>about a lot of things, but in this kind of tension,</p>
<p>how do you balance, as a company,</p>
<p>in predicting the next five years,</p>
<p>the impossible, planning for the impossible,</p>
<p>so listening to those crazy dreamers, letting them do,</p>
<p>letting them run away and make the impossible real,</p>
<p>make it happen, and slow, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how programmers often think,</p>
<p>and slowing things down and saying,</p>
<p>well, this is the rational, this is the possible,</p>
<p>the pragmatic, the dreamer versus the pragmatist,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s helpful to have a model</p>
<p>which encourages a predictable revenue stream</p>
<p>as well as the ability to do new things.</p>
<p>So in Google&rsquo;s case, we&rsquo;re big enough</p>
<p>and well enough managed and so forth</p>
<p>that we have a pretty good sense of what our revenue will be</p>
<p>for the next year or two, at least for a while.</p>
<p>And so we have enough cash generation</p>
<p>that we can make bets, and indeed,</p>
<p>Google has become alphabet,</p>
<p>so the corporation is organized around these bets,</p>
<p>and these bets are in areas of fundamental importance</p>
<p>to the world, whether it&rsquo;s artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>medical technology, self driving cars,</p>
<p>connectivity through balloons, on and on and on.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more coming and more coming.</p>
<p>So one way you could express this</p>
<p>is that the current business is successful enough</p>
<p>that we have the luxury of making bets.</p>
<p>And another one that you could say</p>
<p>is that we have the wisdom of being able to see</p>
<p>that a corporate structure needs to be created</p>
<p>to enhance the likelihood of the success of those bets.</p>
<p>So we essentially turned ourselves into a conglomerate</p>
<p>of bets and then this underlying corporation, Google,</p>
<p>which is itself innovative.</p>
<p>So in order to pull this off,</p>
<p>you have to have a bunch of belief systems,</p>
<p>and one of them is that you have to have</p>
<p>bottoms up and tops down.</p>
<p>The bottoms up we call 20% time,</p>
<p>and the idea is that people can spend 20% of the time</p>
<p>whatever they want, and the top down</p>
<p>is that our founders in particular</p>
<p>have a keen eye on technology</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re reviewing things constantly.</p>
<p>So an example would be they&rsquo;ll hear about an idea</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll hear about something and it sounds interesting,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go visit them.</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s begin to assemble the pieces</p>
<p>to see if that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And if you do this long enough,</p>
<p>you get pretty good at predicting what&rsquo;s likely to work.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a beautiful balance that struck.</p>
<p>Is this something that applies at all scale?</p>
<p>It seems to be that Sergey, again, 15 years ago,</p>
<p>came up with a concept called 10% of the budget</p>
<p>should be on things that are unrelated.</p>
<p>It was called 70, 20, 10.</p>
<p>70% of our time on core business,</p>
<p>20% on adjacent business, and 10% on other.</p>
<p>And he proved mathematically,</p>
<p>of course he&rsquo;s a brilliant mathematician,</p>
<p>that you needed that 10% to make the sum</p>
<p>of the growth work.</p>
<p>And it turns out he was right.</p>
<p>So getting into the world of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked quite extensively and effectively</p>
<p>to the impact in the near term,</p>
<p>the positive impact of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s especially machine learning</p>
<p>in medical applications and education,</p>
<p>and just making information more accessible, right?</p>
<p>In the AI community, there is a kind of debate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this shroud of uncertainty</p>
<p>as we face this new world</p>
<p>with artificial intelligence in it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some people, like Elon Musk,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve disagreed, at least on the degree of emphasis</p>
<p>he places on the existential threat of AI.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve spoken with Stuart Russell,</p>
<p>Max Tegmark, who share Elon Musk&rsquo;s view,</p>
<p>and Yoshua Bengio, Steven Pinker, who do not.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of very smart people</p>
<p>who are thinking about this stuff, disagreeing,</p>
<p>which is really healthy, of course.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the healthiest way</p>
<p>for the AI community to,</p>
<p>and really for the general public,</p>
<p>to think about AI and the concern</p>
<p>of the technology being mismanaged in some kind of way?</p>
<p>So the source of education for the general public</p>
<p>has been robot killer movies.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And Terminator, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the one thing I can assure you we&rsquo;re not building</p>
<p>are those kinds of solutions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if they were to show up,</p>
<p>someone would notice and unplug them, right?</p>
<p>So as exciting as those movies are,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re great movies,</p>
<p>were the killer robots to start,</p>
<p>we would find a way to stop them, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not concerned about that.</p>
<p>And much of this has to do</p>
<p>with the timeframe of conversation.</p>
<p>So you can imagine a situation 100 years from now</p>
<p>when the human brain is fully understood</p>
<p>and the next generation and next generation</p>
<p>of brilliant MIT scientists have figured all this out,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have a large number of ethics questions, right?</p>
<p>Around science and thinking and robots and computers</p>
<p>and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>So it depends on the question of the timeframe.</p>
<p>In the next five to 10 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not facing those questions.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re facing in the next five to 10 years</p>
<p>is how do we spread this disruptive technology</p>
<p>as broadly as possible to gain the maximum benefit of it?</p>
<p>The primary benefits should be in healthcare</p>
<p>and in education.</p>
<p>Healthcare because it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all the same even though we somehow believe we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>As a medical matter,</p>
<p>the fact that we have big data about our health</p>
<p>will save lives, allow us to deal with skin cancer</p>
<p>and other cancers, ophthalmological problems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people working on psychological diseases</p>
<p>and so forth using these techniques.</p>
<p>I can go on and on.</p>
<p>The promise of AI in medicine is extraordinary.</p>
<p>There are many, many companies and startups</p>
<p>and funds and solutions</p>
<p>and we will all live much better for that.</p>
<p>The same argument in education.</p>
<p>Can you imagine that for each generation of child</p>
<p>and even adult, you have a tutor educator that&rsquo;s AI based,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a human but is properly trained,</p>
<p>that helps you get smarter,</p>
<p>helps you address your language difficulties</p>
<p>or your math difficulties or what have you.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we focus on those two?</p>
<p>The gains societally of making humans smarter and healthier</p>
<p>are enormous and those translate for decades and decades</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll all benefit from them.</p>
<p>There are people who are working on AI safety,</p>
<p>which is the issue that you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>and there are conversations in the community</p>
<p>that should there be such problems,</p>
<p>what should the rules be like?</p>
<p>Google, for example, has announced its policies</p>
<p>with respect to AI safety, which I certainly support</p>
<p>and I think most everybody would support</p>
<p>and they make sense, right?</p>
<p>So it helps guide the research</p>
<p>but the killer robots are not arriving this year</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not even being built.</p>
<p>And on that line of thinking, you said the time scale.</p>
<p>In this topic or other topics,</p>
<p>have you found it useful on the business side</p>
<p>or the intellectual side to think beyond five, 10 years,</p>
<p>to think 50 years out?</p>
<p>Has it ever been useful or productive?</p>
<p>In our industry, there are essentially no examples</p>
<p>of 50 year predictions that have been correct.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review AI, right?</p>
<p>AI, which was largely invented here at MIT</p>
<p>and a couple of other universities in the 1956, 1957,</p>
<p>1958, the original claims were a decade or two.</p>
<p>And when I was a PhD student, I studied AI a bit</p>
<p>and it entered during my looking at it,</p>
<p>a period which is known as AI winter,</p>
<p>which went on for about 30 years,</p>
<p>which is a whole generation of science,</p>
<p>scientists and a whole group of people</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t make a lot of progress</p>
<p>because the algorithms had not improved</p>
<p>and the computers had not approved.</p>
<p>It took some brilliant mathematicians</p>
<p>starting with a fellow named Jeff Hinton</p>
<p>at Toronto and Montreal who basically invented</p>
<p>this deep learning model which empowers us today.</p>
<p>The seminal work there was 20 years ago</p>
<p>and in the last 10 years, it&rsquo;s become popularized.</p>
<p>So think about the timeframes for that level of discovery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to predict.</p>
<p>Many people think that we&rsquo;ll be flying around</p>
<p>in the equivalent of flying cars, who knows?</p>
<p>My own view, if I wanna go out on a limb,</p>
<p>is to say that we know a couple of things</p>
<p>about 50 years from now.</p>
<p>We know that there&rsquo;ll be more people alive.</p>
<p>We know that we&rsquo;ll have to have platforms</p>
<p>that are more sustainable because the earth is limited</p>
<p>in the ways we all know and that the kind of platforms</p>
<p>that are gonna get built will be consistent</p>
<p>with the principles that I&rsquo;ve described.</p>
<p>They will be much more empowering of individuals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be much more sensitive to the ecology</p>
<p>because they have to be, they just have to be.</p>
<p>I also think that humans are gonna be a great deal smarter</p>
<p>and I think they&rsquo;re gonna be a lot smarter</p>
<p>because of the tools that I&rsquo;ve discussed with you</p>
<p>and of course, people will live longer.</p>
<p>Life extension is continuing apace.</p>
<p>A baby born today has a reasonable chance</p>
<p>of living to 100, which is pretty exciting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well past the 21st century,</p>
<p>so we better take care of them.</p>
<p>And you mentioned an interesting statistic</p>
<p>on some very large percentage, 60, 70% of people</p>
<p>may live in cities.</p>
<p>Today, more than half the world lives in cities</p>
<p>and one of the great stories of humanity</p>
<p>in the last 20 years has been the rural to urban migration.</p>
<p>This has occurred in the United States,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s occurred in Europe, it&rsquo;s occurring in Asia</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s occurring in Africa.</p>
<p>When people move to cities, the cities get more crowded,</p>
<p>but believe it or not, their health gets better,</p>
<p>their productivity gets better,</p>
<p>their IQ and educational capabilities improve.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s good news that people are moving to cities,</p>
<p>but we have to make them livable and safe.</p>
<p>So you, first of all, you are,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve also worked with some of the greatest leaders</p>
<p>in the history of tech.</p>
<p>What insights do you draw from the difference</p>
<p>in leadership styles of yourself,</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Larry Page,</p>
<p>now the new CEO, Sandra Pichai and others?</p>
<p>From the, I would say, calm sages to the mad geniuses.</p>
<p>One of the things that I learned as a young executive</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s no single formula for leadership.</p>
<p>They try to teach one, but that&rsquo;s not how it really works.</p>
<p>There are people who just understand what they need to do</p>
<p>and they need to do it quickly.</p>
<p>Those people are often entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>They just know and they move fast.</p>
<p>There are other people who are systems thinkers</p>
<p>and planners, that&rsquo;s more who I am,</p>
<p>somewhat more conservative, more thorough in execution,</p>
<p>a little bit more risk of risk.</p>
<p>A little bit more risk averse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also people who are sort of slightly insane,</p>
<p>in the sense that they are emphatic and charismatic</p>
<p>and they feel it and they drive it and so forth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no single formula to success.</p>
<p>There is one thing that unifies all of the people</p>
<p>that you named, which is very high intelligence.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the thing that characterizes</p>
<p>all of them is that they saw the world quicker, faster,</p>
<p>they processed information faster.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t necessarily make the right decisions</p>
<p>all the time, but they were on top of it.</p>
<p>And the other thing that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>about all those people is they all started young.</p>
<p>So think about Steve Jobs starting Apple</p>
<p>roughly at 18 or 19.</p>
<p>Think about Bill Gates starting at roughly 20, 21.</p>
<p>Think about by the time they were 30,</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, a good example, at 19, 20.</p>
<p>By the time they were 30, they had 10 years.</p>
<p>At 30 years old, they had 10 years of experience</p>
<p>of dealing with people and products and shipments</p>
<p>and the press and business and so forth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible how much experience they had</p>
<p>compared to the rest of us who were busy getting our PhDs.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So we should celebrate these people</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve just had more life experience, right?</p>
<p>And that helps inform the judgment.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, when you&rsquo;re at the top</p>
<p>of these organizations, all the easy questions</p>
<p>have been dealt with, right?</p>
<p>How should we design the buildings?</p>
<p>Where should we put the colors on our product?</p>
<p>What should the box look like, right?</p>
<p>The problems, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so interesting</p>
<p>to be in these rooms, the problems that they face, right,</p>
<p>in terms of the way they operate,</p>
<p>the way they deal with their employees,</p>
<p>their customers, their innovation,</p>
<p>are profoundly challenging.</p>
<p>Each of the companies is demonstrably different culturally.</p>
<p>They are not, in fact, cut of the same.</p>
<p>They behave differently based on input.</p>
<p>Their internal cultures are different.</p>
<p>Their compensation schemes are different.</p>
<p>Their values are different.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s proof that diversity works.</p>
<p>So, so when faced with a tough decision,</p>
<p>in need of advice, it&rsquo;s been said that the best thing</p>
<p>one can do is to find the best person in the world</p>
<p>who can give that advice and find a way to be</p>
<p>in a room with them, one on one and ask.</p>
<p>So here we are, and let me ask in a long winded way,</p>
<p>I wrote this down.</p>
<p>In 1998, there were many good search engines,</p>
<p>Lycos, Excite, AltaVista, Infoseek, Ask Jeeves maybe,</p>
<p>Yahoo even.</p>
<p>So Google stepped in and disrupted everything.</p>
<p>They disrupted the nature of search,</p>
<p>the nature of our access to information,</p>
<p>the way we discover new knowledge.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s 2018, actually 20 years later.</p>
<p>There are many good personal AI assistants,</p>
<p>including, of course, the best from Google.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve spoken in medical and education,</p>
<p>the impact of such an AI assistant could bring.</p>
<p>So we arrive at this question.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a personal one for me,</p>
<p>but I hope my situation represents that of many other,</p>
<p>as we said, dreamers and the crazy engineers.</p>
<p>So my whole life, I&rsquo;ve dreamed of creating</p>
<p>such an AI assistant.</p>
<p>Every step I&rsquo;ve taken has been towards that goal.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m a research scientist in human centered AI</p>
<p>here at MIT.</p>
<p>So the next step for me as I sit here,</p>
<p>so facing my passion is to do what Larry and Sergey did</p>
<p>in 98, this simple startup.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s my simple question.</p>
<p>Given the low odds of success, the timing and luck required,</p>
<p>the countless other factors that can&rsquo;t be controlled</p>
<p>or predicted, which is all the things</p>
<p>that Larry and Sergey faced,</p>
<p>is there some calculation, some strategy</p>
<p>to follow in this step?</p>
<p>Or do you simply follow the passion</p>
<p>just because there&rsquo;s no other choice?</p>
<p>I think the people who are in universities</p>
<p>are always trying to study</p>
<p>the extraordinarily chaotic nature of innovation</p>
<p>and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>My answer is that they didn&rsquo;t have that conversation.</p>
<p>They just did it.</p>
<p>They sensed a moment when in the case of Google,</p>
<p>there was all of this data that needed to be organized</p>
<p>and they had a better algorithm.</p>
<p>They had invented a better way.</p>
<p>So today with human centered AI,</p>
<p>which is your area of research,</p>
<p>there must be new approaches.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a big field.</p>
<p>There must be new approaches,</p>
<p>different from what we and others are doing.</p>
<p>There must be startups to fund.</p>
<p>There must be research projects to try.</p>
<p>There must be graduate students to work on new approaches.</p>
<p>Here at MIT, there are people who are looking at learning</p>
<p>from the standpoint of looking at child learning.</p>
<p>How do children learn starting at age one and two?</p>
<p>And the work is fantastic.</p>
<p>Those approaches are different from the approach</p>
<p>that most people are taking.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s a bet that you should make</p>
<p>or perhaps there&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the successful entrepreneurs are not as crazy as they sound.</p>
<p>They see an opportunity based on what&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use Uber as an example.</p>
<p>As Travis sells the story,</p>
<p>he and his co founder were sitting in Paris</p>
<p>and they had this idea because they couldn&rsquo;t get a cab.</p>
<p>And they said, we have smartphones and the rest is history.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the equivalent of that Travis Eiffel Tower,</p>
<p>where is a cab moment that you could,</p>
<p>as an entrepreneur, take advantage of?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s in human centered AI or something else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the next great startup.</p>
<p>And the psychology of that moment.</p>
<p>So when Sergey and Larry talk about,</p>
<p>and listen to a few interviews, it&rsquo;s very nonchalant.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the very fascinating web data</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s an algorithm we have for,</p>
<p>we just kind of want to play around with that data.</p>
<p>And it seems like that&rsquo;s a really nice way</p>
<p>to organize this data.</p>
<p>I should say what happened to remember</p>
<p>is that they were graduate students at Stanford</p>
<p>and they thought this was interesting.</p>
<p>So they built a search engine</p>
<p>and they kept it in their room.</p>
<p>And they had to get power from the room next door</p>
<p>because they were using too much power in the room.</p>
<p>So they ran an extension cord over, right?</p>
<p>And then they went and they found a house</p>
<p>and they had Google world headquarters of five people,</p>
<p>right, to start the company.</p>
<p>And they raised $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,</p>
<p>who was the Sun founder to do this</p>
<p>and Dave Cheriton and a few others.</p>
<p>The point is their beginnings were very simple</p>
<p>but they were based on a powerful insight.</p>
<p>That is a replicable model for any startup.</p>
<p>It has to be a powerful insight.</p>
<p>The beginnings are simple.</p>
<p>And there has to be an innovation.</p>
<p>In Larry and Sergey&rsquo;s case, it was PageRank,</p>
<p>which was a brilliant idea,</p>
<p>one of the most cited papers in the world today.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next one?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re one of, if I may say,</p>
<p>richest people in the world.</p>
<p>And yet it seems that money is simply a side effect</p>
<p>of your passions and not an inherent goal.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re a fascinating person to ask.</p>
<p>So much of our society at the individual level</p>
<p>and at the company level and as nations</p>
<p>is driven by the desire for wealth.</p>
<p>What do you think about this drive?</p>
<p>And what have you learned about,</p>
<p>if I may romanticize the notion,</p>
<p>the meaning of life,</p>
<p>having achieved success on so many dimensions?</p>
<p>There have been many studies of human happiness</p>
<p>and above some threshold,</p>
<p>which is typically relatively low for this conversation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no difference in happiness about money.</p>
<p>The happiness is correlated with meaning and purpose,</p>
<p>a sense of family, a sense of impact.</p>
<p>So if you organize your life,</p>
<p>assuming you have enough to get around</p>
<p>and have a nice home and so forth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be far happier if you figure out</p>
<p>what you care about and work on that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often being in service to others.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great deal of evidence that people are happiest</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re serving others and not themselves.</p>
<p>This goes directly against the sort of</p>
<p>press induced excitement about</p>
<p>powerful and wealthy leaders of one kind.</p>
<p>And indeed these are consequential people.</p>
<p>But if you are in a situation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve been very fortunate as I have,</p>
<p>you also have to take that as a responsibility</p>
<p>and you have to basically work both to educate others</p>
<p>and give them that opportunity,</p>
<p>but also use that wealth to advance human society.</p>
<p>In my case, I&rsquo;m particularly interested in</p>
<p>using the tools of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and machine learning to make society better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned education, I&rsquo;ve mentioned inequality</p>
<p>and middle class and things like this,</p>
<p>all of which are a passion of mine.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do,</p>
<p>it matters that you believe in it,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s important to you,</p>
<p>and that your life will be far more satisfying</p>
<p>if you spend your life doing that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no better place to end</p>
<p>than a discussion of the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Eric, thank you so much.</p>
