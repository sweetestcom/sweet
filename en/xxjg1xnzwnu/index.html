<p>hey we&rsquo;re back welcome back today we</p>
<p>have another q a so definitely bring</p>
<p>your questions anything that they say is</p>
<p>definitely not meant to cure or replace</p>
<p>your medical care check with your</p>
<p>competent position before implementing</p>
<p>any of the things we&rsquo;re going to talk</p>

<p>and let&rsquo;s dig right into it and we&rsquo;re</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m overweight and have just and just</p>

<p>and intermittent fasting but is she&rsquo;s</p>

<p>quality and the nutrients are there</p>
<p>enough with enough uh DHA which is the</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a baby coming up in the</p>
<p>future and then also all the basic</p>
<p>nutrients when you get a prenatal don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get something that&rsquo;s synthetic you want</p>
<p>something uh with from real food and so</p>
<p>you know sometimes you know it might</p>
<p>take another six months to really become</p>
<p>healthy and then you have your baby the</p>
<p>baby can comes out just super super</p>
<p>healthy as well so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give up I think this will help uh</p>
<p>just give it more time and I mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most important time to be on a</p>
<p>healthy diet is</p>
<p>before you get pregnant and then during</p>
<p>the pregnancy and then while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>breastfeeding if you don&rsquo;t decide to</p>
<p>breastfeed try to get uh</p>
<p>some milk from the late shade League</p>
<p>because that gives that child</p>
<p>um super immunity and they&rsquo;ll be less</p>
<p>likely to have allergies down the road</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>wow those are the tips that&rsquo;s exciting</p>
<p>so love deep uh carry on and let us know</p>
<p>give us a picture of your beautiful</p>
<p>child in the future as I&rsquo;m sure you and</p>
<p>your mate will conceive all right many</p>
<p>of the Greek all these names from the UK</p>
<p>on YouTube I&rsquo;m addicted to your channel</p>
<p>now after watching your video on</p>
<p>microbiomes I was wondering if there is</p>
<p>a test available to measure any kind of</p>
<p>microbiome levels that&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>you know there is there&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>amazing test that just happens to be</p>
<p>they brought the price down too so I</p>
<p>tell you what</p>
<p>just keep watching my channel for</p>
<p>another two weeks and I will I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>release the video with that information</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have it handy but there</p>
<p>is a really good comprehensive test that</p>
<p>will tell you everything about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in your your digestive system</p>
<p>and I really like it it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>brand new and it&rsquo;s extremely affordable</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s exciting</p>
<p>um because knowing the microbiome</p>
<p>activity and the types and uh what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in your gut will just tell you</p>
<p>so much it gives you so much prediction</p>
<p>um right now I&rsquo;m really interested in</p>
<p>the microbiome of animals</p>
<p>um cows horses and things like that</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>they have so many issues and this really</p>
<p>boils down to what that animal eats and</p>
<p>you know when you start giving your</p>
<p>animal grains then you have a lot of</p>
<p>problems especially with um</p>
<p>acidosis and ulcers and you name it</p>
<p>all right very good that sounds exciting</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t wait Doc and we also can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>for the great quiz questions that we go</p>
<p>through every week in this first one</p>
<p>this week is a true falser and there it</p>
<p>is Doc</p>
<p>okay true false people who live in</p>
<p>higher altitudes live longer</p>
<p>what do you think huh I&rsquo;m gonna guess</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to say it all right</p>
<p>dig into that audience</p>
<p>make note of that and I tell we&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>really astute group of folks</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in our green room and this is</p>
<p>interesting so we have Juana who is from</p>
<p>Mexico but moved to Alabama and then we</p>
<p>have this Rascal named Pascal who moved</p>
<p>from Kennedy to Mexico so they were like</p>
<p>ships in the night they pass through and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve made fast friends already from</p>
<p>The Green Room but Pascal is going to</p>
<p>demonstrate how to ask one question 30</p>
<p>seconds you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg Pascal</p>
<p>awesome thanks Dr Burke uh I live a</p>
<p>really holistic healthy lifestyle a lot</p>
<p>of what you talk about I follow atat uh</p>
<p>one thing is</p>
<p>for the past year or so the palms of my</p>
<p>hand and feet are like super yellow</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of Specialists I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried to dig deep as much as I could I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t figure out but to me there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something wrong with it like having a</p>
<p>yellow palm is isn&rsquo;t normal</p>
<p>hmm</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s your take on that well</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just pretend that you um are</p>
<p>following keto which you are and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not uh</p>
<p>doing anything to disturb the liver</p>
<p>right I mean you&rsquo;re eating really</p>
<p>healthy and other than that do you have</p>
<p>any other symptoms or is that pretty</p>
<p>much it</p>
<p>I have uh IBS which is like it comes in</p>
<p>and out depends on it&rsquo;s just a slight</p>
<p>change in what I eat I fax it so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to say you know tea I live a very</p>
<p>boring lifestyle to some of my friends</p>
<p>say but I have to because my body reacts</p>
<p>very fast to whatever I inject</p>
<p>okay do you have any right shoulder pain</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>um and you&rsquo;re not eating a lot of</p>
<p>carrots right</p>
<p>no I thought yeah why not always comes</p>
<p>up no yeah I I I the only thing that</p>
<p>comes up with this is that um</p>
<p>because of the inflammation in the colon</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s something going on with</p>
<p>the liver possibly I guess I think the</p>
<p>only thing I would do is I would take</p>
<p>milk thistle okay that&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>great remedy for the liver and then see</p>
<p>if that color changes and if it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>then I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it because I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a big problem</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>especially on top of what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and what you said</p>
<p>um I mean if your whole body was turning</p>
<p>yellow and your whites of your eyes then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an issue but</p>
<p>um you know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>other than that I can&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>imagine what it could be there&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know you also have like different like</p>
<p>anemia which doesn&rsquo;t sound like you have</p>
<p>which can create like a pail which might</p>
<p>seem a yellow but um</p>
<p>yeah and then and there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>pigments but um</p>
<p>is it something you had your whole life</p>
<p>no I would say it&rsquo;s been within the last</p>
<p>year or so like I&rsquo;ve had blood tests run</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slightly anemia to to talk about it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that came up and one of the</p>
<p>test results</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve had like a lot of tests done</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people</p>
<p>and nobody seems to be able to figure</p>
<p>out what&rsquo;s the root cause of this</p>
<p>yeah because we&rsquo;re dealing with um</p>
<p>pigment and we&rsquo;re dealing also with uh</p>
<p>with blood and uh normally it should be</p>
<p>kind of like a not a pink but a flesh</p>
<p>color so in that case</p>
<p>um did they say you have maybe</p>
<p>potentially an iron anemia issue or a</p>
<p>B12 Anemia or or some other type of</p>
<p>anemia do they mention anything about</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>uh one of them was especially because I</p>
<p>have access to a lot of different</p>
<p>specialists in Mexico that I did not in</p>
<p>Canada because a lot of this is illegal</p>
<p>in Canada so uh one of them was saying</p>
<p>that uh was recommending B12 injections</p>
<p>to help</p>
<p>I I would go in a different direction</p>
<p>because as soon as you started injecting</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s it comes with the package I</p>
<p>would do just take a methylcobolamine</p>
<p>which is a the best type of BB vitamin</p>
<p>and higher amounts um</p>
<p>and start looking at some of my videos</p>
<p>related to other things that you need to</p>
<p>do to enhance that B12 absorption maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be sublingual but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing if you</p>
<p>um if you did find that</p>
<p>that issue then that could be related to</p>
<p>it possibly</p>
<p>um a really good test that I have been</p>
<p>doing a deep dive on is this genetic</p>
<p>testing and doing the DNA testing</p>
<p>because you pick up</p>
<p>all sorts of bizarre things that now</p>
<p>make sense especially as it relates to</p>
<p>either a different types of anemia iron</p>
<p>B12 it&rsquo;ll tell you it&rsquo;ll give you the</p>
<p>data and you may find that you need more</p>
<p>folate in the form of methylfolate and</p>
<p>that could solve your problem so I think</p>
<p>that would be a good test that I would</p>
<p>jump on</p>
<p>awesome thank you so much hey you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome that&rsquo;s great great thanks for</p>
<p>being such a great contestant Pascal</p>
<p>felt it at your question quickly and</p>
<p>made it entertaining for everyone</p>
<p>speaking of entertaining uh our first</p>
<p>quiz question was a true falser uh hang</p>
<p>on let me mute</p>
<p>Pascal there we go enjoy the show Pascal</p>
<p>uh and it asked true false people who</p>
<p>live in higher altitudes</p>
<p>live longer which makes me mad because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at sea level but let&rsquo;s see what the</p>
<p>audience says 78 percent of respondents</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s true and 22 percent say no way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally true and and so the reason</p>
<p>is I mean you would think we got thinner</p>
<p>air we have less oxygen we&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>little bit more CO2 in higher altitudes</p>
<p>how could that possibly increase our</p>
<p>longevity well I think there is an</p>
<p>association and that has to do with your</p>
<p>ability to</p>
<p>absorb</p>
<p>oxygen into the cells is dependent on</p>
<p>the CO2</p>
<p>and this change in pressure</p>
<p>as well as uh change in ratios of</p>
<p>different gases at higher altitudes uh</p>
<p>tends to make your body adapt and</p>
<p>increase the size of red blood cells so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to carry more oxygen</p>
<p>nutrition to the cell and so</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know what um even</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in the Olympics they had I think it was</p>
<p>in Mexico or something if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken but they they found that those</p>
<p>athletes that were training at high</p>
<p>altitudes just got like amazing scores</p>
<p>and amazing results and so then the next</p>
<p>year everyone&rsquo;s training at high</p>
<p>altitude but you could mimic that by</p>
<p>doing um certain type of</p>
<p>um breathing through your nose when you</p>
<p>work out uh hypoxia training which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having a device in your mouth</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re working out restricting air</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these things you can mimic</p>
<p>it but the point is that um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re watching my videos recently</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking a lot about CO2 and the</p>
<p>importance of that being there to help</p>
<p>you absorb more oxygen and higher</p>
<p>altitudes um can help as well and then</p>
<p>when you come down the lower altitudes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like wow why can I breathe so much</p>
<p>better I just feel so much better well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because you have larger red blood</p>
<p>cells</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um something to look at Steve as one of</p>
<p>the factors moved to some Mountaintop if</p>
<p>you want to live longer well I&rsquo;m on the</p>
<p>third floor and I think that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>handle it so I&rsquo;m not going down for any</p>
<p>reason just don&rsquo;t get a nosebleed no</p>
<p>absolutely okay let&rsquo;s see so why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we go back to our wonderful social media</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do it better than that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>talked about Juana from Mexico and</p>
<p>Pascal from Canada and all over let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s find out who else is watching so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like to say a good morning to all</p>
<p>our viewers joining us today from the UK</p>
<p>Canada Mexico Australia Denmark</p>
<p>Indonesia the Philippines Colombia</p>
<p>Panama Hungary Dubai turkey Taiwan the</p>
<p>Netherlands Sweden Norway Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>Greece Madagascar Cyprus Hong Kong Chile</p>
<p>India France Nigeria Oman Germany</p>
<p>Switzerland Poland Nepal Jamaica can you</p>
<p>believe this Israel Russia South Africa</p>
<p>New Zealand Malaysia Slovakia the Virgin</p>
<p>Islands Pakistan Albania Scotland</p>
<p>Trinidad Kenya Brazil Armenia Venezuela</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates Ethiopia the</p>
<p>Dominican Republic</p>
<p>Austria excuse me Azerbaijan</p>
<p>Eritrea Peru Belgium Egypt</p>
<p>Iran Italy and all across these United</p>
<p>States that&rsquo;s just unbelievable the list</p>
<p>grows and of course we&rsquo;re going to hear</p>
<p>from a few other frustrated Nations that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get mentioned and so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to jump in here I can assure you</p>
<p>that okay let&rsquo;s see I want to go back to</p>
<p>the earlier list there was one uh Karen</p>
<p>from YouTube I&rsquo;ve been on healthy keto</p>
<p>and iaf and omad I&rsquo;m down 80 pounds</p>
<p>uh since 2021 I started taking dim a</p>
<p>week ago to address intense night sweats</p>
<p>how long before I start seeing an</p>
<p>improvement on this condition</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re taking dim which is a</p>
<p>concentrated form of cruciferous to help</p>
<p>estrogen dominance I would give it a</p>
<p>good solid week to see if that is the</p>
<p>thing that you need to take and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say it doesn&rsquo;t doesn&rsquo;t create the effect</p>
<p>that you want then the next thing I</p>
<p>would do is I would take some</p>
<p>tocotrinals that seems to work for hot</p>
<p>flashes for a certain percentage of the</p>
<p>population if that doesn&rsquo;t work add some</p>
<p>seek help with the iodine so there are</p>
<p>several things that you can try</p>
<p>um because it&rsquo;s hard some people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like hard to know what</p>
<p>exactly is behind that problem sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just weak adrenals sometimes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these other issues</p>
<p>um when you go through menopause</p>
<p>um there is an increased demand over the</p>
<p>adrenals because they&rsquo;re backing up the</p>
<p>ovaries</p>
<p>and so if by chance</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on a low-fat diet or you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the Statin because now you&rsquo;re blocking</p>
<p>cholesterol all these precursors for the</p>
<p>adrenal hormones</p>
<p>depend on cholesterol so now we we</p>
<p>starve off those hormones and then if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient</p>
<p>that can give more or or if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>division or if you&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>stress that&rsquo;ll give more attention to</p>
<p>the stress hormones and less on these</p>
<p>other hormones</p>
<p>and so you might have</p>
<p>more problems with hot flashes because</p>
<p>of stress because of the how the body</p>
<p>allocates</p>
<p>resources to those that are more in like</p>
<p>an emergency situation versus doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think like long-term type Health all</p>
<p>right well I think I&rsquo;m developing</p>
<p>routine I would recommend you stay on</p>
<p>the third floor and calm down for</p>
<p>goodness sakes for Better Health all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s see how about</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>oh here&rsquo;s one for you doc I&rsquo;m sure uh</p>
<p>Katina from YouTube what are your</p>
<p>thoughts about taking bovine colostrum</p>
<p>I like it I recommend it if you can find</p>
<p>uh one from a goat uh or sheep might</p>
<p>work a little bit better because it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>for some people they&rsquo;re sensitive to the</p>
<p>cow&rsquo;s milk and there might be some</p>
<p>factors in there but nevertheless you</p>
<p>could take just small amounts of it and</p>
<p>just gradually increase it but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking something that</p>
<p>can greatly repair the immune system for</p>
<p>an adult</p>
<p>but that colostrum is like the first</p>
<p>milk and uh and it&rsquo;s vitally important</p>
<p>for immune system health</p>
<p>but you can use it later in life to</p>
<p>correct a lot of things especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been on Prednisone for a period</p>
<p>of time and it&rsquo;s destroyed your body uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something you can take to enhance</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>okay and our our co-producer is also a</p>
<p>grammarian and he&rsquo;s always giving me</p>
<p>things phonetically but he wanted to let</p>
<p>me know it&rsquo;s pronounced bovine not</p>
<p>bovine or whatever way I butched it so</p>
<p>thank you Terry bovine uh let&rsquo;s see uh</p>
<p>what else do we have here well let&rsquo;s do</p>
<p>another question</p>
<p>and see if Terry corrects my grammar</p>
<p>again there you go but you read a doc</p>
<p>okay how does smoke and chemicals from</p>
<p>smoking</p>
<p>cause liver fibrosis</p>
<p>you know I thought it had everything to</p>
<p>do with the lung</p>
<p>how could it cause lever fibrosis boy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an interesting question I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>the audience can figure that out uh and</p>
<p>I tell we&rsquo;re going to go back to and and</p>
<p>let me</p>
<p>um preface this jatinder who is in</p>
<p>Birmingham England but her volume is</p>
<p>extremely low and there&rsquo;s a terrible</p>
<p>delay but we&rsquo;re going to do our very</p>
<p>best to try to hear what she has to say</p>
<p>unmute yourself jatinder if you would</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t hear you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with Dr Byrd</p>
<p>the bug</p>
<p>okay she said hello Dr Berg so we got</p>
<p>that hello</p>
<p>firstly I got a</p>
<p>infection at calorie</p>
<p>is gone</p>
<p>but I have</p>
<p>a place say pain abdominal pain for</p>
<p>abdominal pain and cell through a lot</p>
<p>and I feel pressure around my stomach</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m taking a medicine a radical and</p>
<p>once a day</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t feel better until I have</p>
<p>feelings</p>
<p>okay so uh</p>
<p>all right so uh it&rsquo;s a little difficult</p>
<p>but I think I I have a couple pieces of</p>
<p>puzzle and Steve maybe you can help me</p>
<p>with this</p>
<p>um she has Ace pylori</p>
<p>she got treated with antibiotics the</p>
<p>infection is gone but I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some complications continual abdominal</p>
<p>pain</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>Ace pylori</p>
<p>in a healthy person doesn&rsquo;t bother you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s when the pH changes and when</p>
<p>something goes awry that the H pylori</p>
<p>becomes a bit</p>
<p>pathogenic</p>
<p>and it creates problems it&rsquo;s linked to</p>
<p>many things from</p>
<p>ulcers to gastritis</p>
<p>to even stomach cancer so H pylori um is</p>
<p>a very uh interesting micro because it</p>
<p>also has a byproduct to survive releases</p>
<p>ammonia which is very alkaline to</p>
<p>increase its survival leaving you high</p>
<p>and dry with the loss of stomach acid so</p>
<p>it so you you what you need to do is</p>
<p>replace what&rsquo;s really missing and what</p>
<p>would have prevented this from the first</p>
<p>place and that would be starting to take</p>
<p>hydrochloride</p>
<p>um and I have a video on that you can</p>
<p>watch that start taking more of a 1000</p>
<p>core that will build up the pH of your</p>
<p>stomach make the environment very hard</p>
<p>for that thing to come back</p>
<p>and then you also at the same time need</p>
<p>to take ProBox because you you took</p>
<p>antibiotics and so now we have to build</p>
<p>up the Flora to help your gut</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>um even though you say that the</p>
<p>antibiotic resolved it probably</p>
<p>put it in remission temporarily so</p>
<p>sulforaphane</p>
<p>is a very safe remedy for h pylori</p>
<p>sulforaphane and broccoli Sprouts so if</p>
<p>you or you can even do cabbage juice as</p>
<p>well that has sulforaphane in it and you</p>
<p>take that and that will help your</p>
<p>stomach and you can help heal it but</p>
<p>you need to take a betaine hydrochloride</p>
<p>and hopefully</p>
<p>your stomach is not irritated where you</p>
<p>can take that that&rsquo;s going to eventually</p>
<p>resolve things for you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well listen we wish you all</p>
<p>the best you Tinder I&rsquo;m glad we will be</p>
<p>able to kind of ferret out your question</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d love to hear back from you to</p>
<p>find out whether that resolved because</p>
<p>that sounds like an awful problem to</p>
<p>have but thanks for calling in from the</p>
<p>UK and uh let&rsquo;s go back to the exciting</p>
<p>quiz questions</p>
<p>uh and let&rsquo;s see in this one the second</p>
<p>one asked how does smoke and chemicals</p>
<p>from smoking cause liver fibrosis Terry</p>
<p>I said every word correctly I think and</p>
<p>55 of our respondents say smoking</p>
<p>depletes your CNE vitamins thirty</p>
<p>percent say it attacks proper lung and</p>
<p>liver functions and the remaining 15 say</p>
<p>it impacts the healthy flow of blood</p>
<p>hmm you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re all right okay but the</p>
<p>answer I was looking for more than</p>
<p>others would be uh</p>
<p>this uh you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>everything you breathe in</p>
<p>goes to stomach in other words it goes</p>
<p>to right inside your body into your</p>
<p>bloodstream that&rsquo;s what the lung is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exchanging with blood</p>
<p>um the uh the the gas with the blood and</p>
<p>it goes in there and so as you breathing</p>
<p>smoke all those particles go right into</p>
<p>your blood and go right into the liver</p>
<p>also goes into the arteries so you can</p>
<p>imagine what it does to the arteries so</p>
<p>you can end up with a lot of liver</p>
<p>issues from smoking it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>isolated to the lung</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m going to be doing a video on</p>
<p>that and the importance of</p>
<p>like how do you detoxify the lung</p>
<p>um one really good remedy would be</p>
<p>you know people are always recommending</p>
<p>things for the lung itself I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>um if you really look at it if you took</p>
<p>um milk thistle not only will that</p>
<p>protect the liver but that protects the</p>
<p>lung too against</p>
<p>poisons and so you need something that</p>
<p>is kind of like the antidote to poisons</p>
<p>because there are</p>
<p>seven thousand chemicals in smoking 250</p>
<p>which are dangerous</p>
<p>I think 20 that are carcinogenic so to</p>
<p>bulletproof yourself you need something</p>
<p>to counter</p>
<p>being poisoned and that would be milk</p>
<p>thistle</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to be sharing a video on</p>
<p>that topic but the point is that</p>
<p>those particles so whatever goes right</p>
<p>in and end up in the liver and the liver</p>
<p>has to deal with it so if you smoke</p>
<p>chronically then the liver is an issue</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t ignore and that can</p>
<p>actually create inflammation and then</p>
<p>that inflammation turns into scar tissue</p>
<p>and that is what fibrosis is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>healing response to the inflammation</p>
<p>wow well of all my various proclivities</p>
<p>uh smoking was was the hardest thing I</p>
<p>ever did it&rsquo;s been 30 something years</p>
<p>ago well worth it but yeah get off those</p>
<p>cigarettes folks if you can I tried to</p>
<p>smoke I really tried I just couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t keep doing it I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know just you&rsquo;re not the Marlboro Man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure oh well no he died by</p>
<p>the way</p>
<p>uh anyway so let&rsquo;s see uh there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>folks that want to be recognized and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so glad that we&rsquo;re now hearing from</p>
<p>Japan bulgar Bulgaria Zimbabwe Serbia</p>
<p>Ireland Palestine Ghana Bermuda Uganda</p>
<p>Punjab and</p>
<p>um Guadalupe so welcome folks thanks so</p>
<p>much for joining the show and uh</p>
<p>participating with it with all your</p>
<p>great social media questions speaking of</p>
<p>which let&rsquo;s go back and see if we can</p>
<p>find another interesting question</p>
<p>uh trenia from Facebook this time should</p>
<p>we avoid all processed meat on keto if</p>
<p>so what is the best kind of meats to eat</p>
<p>on keto and omad how many calories</p>
<p>should we aim for with omad a couple</p>
<p>questions there</p>
<p>so I think you you should aim for a</p>
<p>quality meat if you can I mean if all</p>
<p>you have is uh the</p>
<p>processed meat that&rsquo;s called Dirty keto</p>
<p>then do that as long as the carbs are</p>
<p>low as a temporary thing but you want to</p>
<p>work towards increasing the quality now</p>
<p>you say well I can&rsquo;t afford it well</p>
<p>if you go on fasting one meal a day we</p>
<p>just saved you three hundred dollars per</p>
<p>month of food so now you can reinvest</p>
<p>that into that quality and grass-fed</p>
<p>pasture-raised</p>
<p>you know food uh is just going to be a</p>
<p>lot better for you</p>
<p>um nutritionally and if anyone that says</p>
<p>even organic is not healthier it I can I</p>
<p>can show you data that it is it&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>healthier so um now as far as calories</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I talk a lot about that I give you a</p>
<p>rough idea of how many calories there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even a keto calculator on my website you</p>
<p>can actually go there and figure out</p>
<p>your calories but generally speaking you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to even worry about the</p>
<p>calories in keto you eat until you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re full and since you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re not going to have to worry</p>
<p>about it you want but you want moderate</p>
<p>amount of protein okay you want um</p>
<p>low carb</p>
<p>and then the rest is fat so to keep it</p>
<p>simple uh watch some of my videos on the</p>
<p>portions and I think that&rsquo;ll make it</p>
<p>simple for you rather than the dreading</p>
<p>counting of a calorie it&rsquo;s like and so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to figure out exactly</p>
<p>how many calories you need and so but I</p>
<p>do have a cool keto calculator on the</p>
<p>website you can look at that and it can</p>
<p>look at various variables</p>
<p>interesting you know what it sounds like</p>
<p>Krispy Kreme Donuts check two of those</p>
<p>boxes except for the uh the carbs so</p>
<p>maybe they can modify their uh their uh</p>
<p>it has fat yeah yeah it sure does you</p>
<p>can see it on your waist all right</p>
<p>Francis from uh Facebook which B</p>
<p>vitamins would you recommend for carpal</p>
<p>tunnel huh</p>
<p>B6</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one that you need for carpal</p>
<p>tunnel syndrome</p>
<p>um if the the best form of B6 that you</p>
<p>want to take</p>
<p>is not just regular B6 you want to take</p>
<p>something called</p>
<p>p5p</p>
<p>so you can look that up that&rsquo;s an active</p>
<p>form of B6 and it&rsquo;ll work a lot better</p>
<p>all right good it&rsquo;s a question I think</p>
<p>we should answer uh and I can guess your</p>
<p>answer Jenna from YouTube should someone</p>
<p>as young as five years old be doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>no I think um if you could just do the</p>
<p>three meals a day I think that would be</p>
<p>the ideal situation versus all the</p>
<p>different snacks but three meals a day</p>
<p>are going to be good for a small child</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you know you have some of</p>
<p>these kids that are developing obesity</p>
<p>at 13 years old you know 14 15. uh</p>
<p>should they be doing two meals a day um</p>
<p>yes they should</p>
<p>um and then also get in on keto</p>
<p>all right uh Florencia from Facebook</p>
<p>what would you recommend for someone who</p>
<p>has high cholesterol and high blood</p>
<p>pressure</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s hard to know because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what you eat so I&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>dissect that but I would get on the</p>
<p>basic heating plan that I recommend and</p>
<p>see if your your shoe goes away</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>typically when people have high blood</p>
<p>pressure and high cholesterol they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing high carbs</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s high triglycerides so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>at this point I think what I would</p>
<p>recommend for you is to watch the basic</p>
<p>videos on that topic and that could</p>
<p>probably sort things out for you</p>
<p>and I tell you there&rsquo;s certainly a new</p>
<p>fad it seems like in the 2000s</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s getting their gallbladder</p>
<p>ripped out and here&rsquo;s Kelly from</p>
<p>Facebook is it okay to do keto with no</p>
<p>gallbladder</p>
<p>I would recommend getting one first</p>
<p>before you do keto and making sure that</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t rust out but um no I think uh</p>
<p>the fact that you had the gallbladder</p>
<p>out means that you should do keto the</p>
<p>gut what causes gallstones that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>question it&rsquo;s not just high cholesterol</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>low bile it&rsquo;s the deficiency of bile</p>
<p>which can come from The Following</p>
<p>high levels of cortisol high levels of</p>
<p>insulin because you&rsquo;re not on keto and</p>
<p>high levels of estrogen</p>
<p>so those are some factors to look at but</p>
<p>um but now you don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder</p>
<p>you you may need to substitute with some</p>
<p>additional bile salts after the meal</p>
<p>when you do keto just to increase the</p>
<p>absorption of all the fat soluble</p>
<p>nutrients</p>
<p>interesting here&rsquo;s another Twist on the</p>
<p>liver function Mary from YouTube can</p>
<p>tattoos impact liver function and get</p>
<p>Hepatitis</p>
<p>uh yeah you could definitely get a look</p>
<p>at a virus from contamination or you</p>
<p>know some of the dyes are um you know do</p>
<p>go leech into the body so that could</p>
<p>create an effect on things I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>done a major Deep dive in that topic but</p>
<p>potentially it could be an issue</p>
<p>all right so watch out for that folks</p>
<p>reputable uh tattoo parlors I think are</p>
<p>probably pretty good but I&rsquo;ve a lot of</p>
<p>people can track hep C from that for</p>
<p>some reason let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um Sarah from YouTube should we eat more</p>
<p>fat on keto to feel Fuller or is it just</p>
<p>a key part of the keto process that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting question</p>
<p>no no I think you should eat more fat I</p>
<p>think you should</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>fat actually believe it or not</p>
<p>um is not the bad guy but if you have</p>
<p>high carbs with fat that is an issue and</p>
<p>also the the quality of fat that you eat</p>
<p>it you know here&rsquo;s the thing Steve</p>
<p>um if you ever want to figure out a</p>
<p>health problem go to the official</p>
<p>consensus go to the expert</p>
<p>experts right in quote unquote how do</p>
<p>you find that just type type on Google</p>
<p>and the first one will be the</p>
<p>the answer that you look at and then you</p>
<p>basically know what to avoid they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>telling you do this</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on your avoid list because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re literally almost 100 percent</p>
<p>in the in the opposite direction well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a hypochondriac and I pronounce</p>
<p>myself dead within five seconds on</p>
<p>Google if I look up I have everything if</p>
<p>I put in any kind of symptom I&rsquo;ve got it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fatal so you got to watch that</p>
<p>uh that Google stuff it&rsquo;ll get you yeah</p>
<p>doing research yeah good luck yeah</p>
<p>terrible okay how about another question</p>
<p>Dr Berg</p>
<p>all right baking soda would be an</p>
<p>acceptable remedy for which stomach</p>
<p>condition</p>
<p>all right climb on it audience</p>
<p>can I put a check by that one I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to forget what questions we did</p>
<p>anymore okay why don&rsquo;t we go back to</p>
<p>um to our green room and Juana who was a</p>
<p>native of Mexico but now is in Alabama</p>
<p>she has a question for you make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re unmuted quanta and you uh are on</p>
<p>with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg</p>
<p>let me think I need to think in English</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah about three years ago I started</p>
<p>following you and I always been trying</p>
<p>to eat clean and everything my whole</p>
<p>life I never craved cakes and sweets and</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff and I used to I</p>
<p>will eat uh eat them if we go to a</p>
<p>birthday party or something like that</p>
<p>but I will never like crave him and and</p>
<p>when I met you I started doing Keto</p>
<p>and that was in 2019 through the</p>
<p>pandemic I was able to do keto clean</p>
<p>keto and</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;m a missionary and after the</p>
<p>pandemic we were able to travel so we</p>
<p>went back to we went back to Mexico uh</p>
<p>in September 2012 well last year</p>
<p>September last year and we came back and</p>
<p>February this year and in my way back</p>
<p>here I noticed that when I ate I started</p>
<p>feeling full full quick I couldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>finish my my my normal meal and</p>
<p>when I got home about three days later I</p>
<p>started feeling this burning sensation</p>
<p>from my throat all down to a whole my</p>
<p>whole GI track</p>
<p>and I was able to fill my food digestion</p>
<p>as it was going down and it was burning</p>
<p>all the way so I thought maybe I have a</p>
<p>h pylori or I don&rsquo;t know how it got</p>
<p>um and I started doing the uh juicing</p>
<p>the Cabbage using and and I I did the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that gum</p>
<p>music</p>
<p>gum yeah the Cabbage shoes and I felt</p>
<p>like I did it for a week and I was</p>
<p>feeling worse so I kind of got I got</p>
<p>scared because I wasn&rsquo;t able to eat and</p>
<p>I was and I have this heartburn all day</p>
<p>all day long and all night long and I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t be I wasn&rsquo;t able to sleep and</p>
<p>so I finally told my my husband well</p>
<p>take me to the doctor I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m not one</p>
<p>that I like to go to the doctor</p>
<p>or take medicine or anything but um I</p>
<p>did went to the doctor and they uh drove</p>
<p>some blood and check for h pylori and</p>
<p>they said I didn&rsquo;t have it but I had all</p>
<p>the symptoms so they gave me the</p>
<p>treatment I went 10 days with the</p>
<p>treatment and</p>
<p>after the treatment I I actually got to</p>
<p>feel better and but after the treatment</p>
<p>as all the symptoms came back</p>
<p>and so Dr Berg what do you think about</p>
<p>that let me let him cut in there Juana</p>
<p>yeah so let me just uh kind of give you</p>
<p>my two cents on that because</p>
<p>um this is a perfect example of uh</p>
<p>thought well we didn&rsquo;t find it but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>treat you anyway so um I mean I think</p>
<p>they gave you an antibiotic so now you</p>
<p>have to replace the probiotic but I</p>
<p>think what&rsquo;s missing in the first sense</p>
<p>especially since you don&rsquo;t have H pylori</p>
<p>is the the valve at the top of your</p>
<p>stomach is not closing and usually</p>
<p>because you need more acidity with the</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride that&rsquo;s the remedy</p>
<p>that I would use not the Mastic Gum or</p>
<p>or anything to kill H pylori it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride you start taking</p>
<p>that because as you know the food in</p>
<p>America is slightly different than in</p>
<p>Mexico</p>
<p>um all of a sudden people that are used</p>
<p>to one way that come this way it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>wow I can&rsquo;t digest this food</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;m sure in Alabama they have</p>
<p>higher quality food then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being sarcastic but one is that you</p>
<p>need betaine hydrochloride and um to</p>
<p>start acidifying the stomach so you can</p>
<p>start to get your system back in place</p>
<p>but you also need a probiotic so I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all you really need to do</p>
<p>especially</p>
<p>um with what you told me with your um</p>
<p>some of the symptoms so Juana I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna yeah sorry if you if you would</p>
<p>call us back though and let us know how</p>
<p>that goes we&rsquo;re about out of time right</p>
<p>now dear but thank you so much for being</p>
<p>a great contestant and uh and we want to</p>
<p>hear back from you at some time in the</p>
<p>meantime let&rsquo;s look at our latest</p>
<p>question it was question number three</p>
<p>which asked baking soda would be an</p>
<p>acceptable remedy for what stomach</p>
<p>condition and our astute audience 62</p>
<p>percent uh say baking soda will fix acid</p>
<p>reflux 20 say it fixes ulcers ten</p>
<p>percent say it fixes indigestion and the</p>
<p>final eight percent if that all adds up</p>
<p>to 100 says it fixes GERD</p>
<p>well I think this is a very timely</p>
<p>question we timed it right around</p>
<p>Wanda&rsquo;s uh question because typically</p>
<p>when you have</p>
<p>acid reflux or heartburn you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough acid so you need to take more</p>
<p>acid like betaine had a chloride but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for example you have an ulcer</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say for example you have</p>
<p>gastritis inflammation of the stomach</p>
<p>and you take butane hydrochloride or</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar oh my goodness</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going to set it on fire</p>
<p>so what would be something you can take</p>
<p>to get some relief periodically</p>
<p>baking soda</p>
<p>so that would be something but I don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to take that chronically</p>
<p>like a lot over a long period of time</p>
<p>just enough to give you relief here and</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>um but I think that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>have less side effects than</p>
<p>a PPI or an acid</p>
<p>um so that is um</p>
<p>that would be an acceptable time as you</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t give the</p>
<p>person butane hydrochloride so what do</p>
<p>you do well you got to fix gastritis now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you have usually H pylori</p>
<p>involved because of the pH so you take</p>
<p>sulforaphane the cabbage juice</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>to put that thing back in remission</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s healed</p>
<p>and then you can start to acidify the</p>
<p>stomach so</p>
<p>um I am writing a book on the digestion</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a key core area that</p>
<p>explains all these little details and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s hard to educate someone and</p>
<p>just you know three minutes but anyway I</p>
<p>just wanted to give you some more</p>
<p>information about that that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>Juana so look for that book we hope that</p>
<p>uh that brings you because you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>disciplined you know you don&rsquo;t eat a</p>
<p>bunch of junk so you deserve to feel</p>
<p>yeah and also the fact that she can go</p>
<p>without it is huge I mean people would</p>
<p>kill for that ability to you know not</p>
<p>have to have those</p>
<p>sweets and sugars and things like I I</p>
<p>had I had a problem I couldn&rsquo;t just have</p>
<p>just one no and and I had a really bad</p>
<p>diet uh the majority of my life</p>
<p>it was interesting I uh talked to a</p>
<p>doctor I was getting really dehydrated</p>
<p>and he explained uh I said well you know</p>
<p>I chugged a Diet Coke or something he</p>
<p>goes well the manufacturers of that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want you to be quenched that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the idea it doesn&rsquo;t fulfill you and it</p>
<p>dehydrates you and I just thought that</p>
<p>was interesting that this doctor said</p>
<p>that does that make sense that these you</p>
<p>know Sodom and people they want you to</p>
<p>drink them all day</p>
<p>either that or they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>um something or maybe they don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not really even thinking about it yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the products that they produce</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably not putting a lot of</p>
<p>attention on it but uh yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>problem interesting okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>oh James from Facebook is intermittent</p>
<p>fasting every other day combined with a</p>
<p>regular gym workout a good way to lose</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s more difficult but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely can work but when you eat</p>
<p>every other day</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now that I take that back so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an alternative alternate day</p>
<p>fasting program where you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>every other day</p>
<p>um and if I&rsquo;m not mistaken you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing keto which makes it really hard</p>
<p>because you never lower the carbs to be</p>
<p>able to transition but if you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>every other day</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you may</p>
<p>um have a problem getting into this</p>
<p>gradual ketosis</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but it really depends on what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating when you&rsquo;re eating because um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing keto and you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>one meal every other day then some</p>
<p>people need that and you&rsquo;ll definitely</p>
<p>lose weight but</p>
<p>from what I understand the alternate day</p>
<p>or every other day fasting doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>involve keto so you pretty much eat what</p>
<p>you want you lose weight but because the</p>
<p>carbs are too high</p>
<p>you never really transition to the</p>
<p>smooth so it&rsquo;s like oh my gosh your</p>
<p>blood sugars are terrible but you&rsquo;re you</p>
<p>might be losing weight but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>sustainable because the key with keto</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting is your hunger</p>
<p>goes away and it makes it easy to do it</p>
<p>sure does okay here&rsquo;s the next question</p>
<p>Dr Berg</p>
<p>all right so true or false walking</p>
<p>increases your natural killer cells now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of the immune system it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>you have natural killer cells that</p>
<p>address cancer and viruses so will</p>
<p>Walking increase those guys</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>poor gen from YouTube when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>intermittent fasting I usually wake up</p>
<p>uh excuse me LLC</p>
<p>oh she usually wakes up with a killer</p>
<p>headache poor Jen when she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>what can she do I think I think um</p>
<p>either she&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>when she&rsquo;s eating that that keto might</p>
<p>not be correct or she might need more</p>
<p>sea salt</p>
<p>typically that could be a simple remedy</p>
<p>all right very good June try that out</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see uh Miranda from Facebook I am</p>
<p>an adrenal body type and doing strict</p>
<p>keto and one meal a day but I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>losing weight uh what should she try</p>
<p>next</p>
<p>well I would try to lower your</p>
<p>carbohydrates</p>
<p>and add in there</p>
<p>uh maybe another prolonged fast per week</p>
<p>and also make sure that it is true that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you know the question I think the</p>
<p>question should be not like am I losing</p>
<p>weight but am I in Quito where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>burning fat because</p>
<p>many many people that I worked with um</p>
<p>start to develop more muscle structure</p>
<p>which is a bit heavier if you look</p>
<p>compare volume to volume of fat to</p>
<p>protein if you&rsquo;re healing your body and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re repairing atrophy you may not see</p>
<p>much weight loss</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re shrinking you look better</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stronger the key thing to know if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working or not is is your hunger</p>
<p>going away and your Cravings going away</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best indicator and I had</p>
<p>another person who told me yeah it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>working come to find out</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re only losing two pounds per week</p>
<p>I said guess what it&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>even if you lose one pound a week</p>
<p>um especially for a lot of people that</p>
<p>are a little bit older so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re in Quito you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning actual fat you&rsquo;re not just</p>
<p>losing water weight so we really have to</p>
<p>make sure that what you&rsquo;re saying is 100</p>
<p>true all right uh the audience is so</p>
<p>fast it&rsquo;s like 30 seconds we ask them</p>
<p>true false walking walking increases</p>
<p>your natural killer cells and they shot</p>
<p>right back with 98 of the respondents</p>
<p>saying it&rsquo;s true and there&rsquo;s two percent</p>
<p>that are holding out doc they said no</p>
<p>way</p>
<p>Steve who are those two percent we need</p>
<p>to find out who says no</p>
<p>um but yeah it is true it your immune</p>
<p>system improves when you walk you know</p>
<p>walking is probably extremely underrated</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna release a video on it I</p>
<p>started to really look into the research</p>
<p>on walking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna blow your mind what walking</p>
<p>does it&rsquo;s going to get you to start</p>
<p>walking because the amount of health</p>
<p>benefits that occur from walking is</p>
<p>literally mind-blowing what it can do</p>
<p>for your entire body not to mention</p>
<p>uh your mental health too in your mood</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s amazing and what it does to</p>
<p>cortisol too and relieving stress Steve</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to creatively solve problems when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>under stress when under stress problem</p>
<p>solving is not</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>not really working too well</p>
<p>you need a lot of</p>
<p>you know calmness and relaxation and</p>
<p>creativity to solve problems so walking</p>
<p>gives you that</p>
<p>yeah indeed well that&rsquo;s wonderful news</p>
<p>doc so get out there and walk everybody</p>
<p>last but not least is Nancy from Florida</p>
<p>and Nancy if you will unmute yourself we</p>
<p>have time for your one question uh 30</p>
<p>seconds in length go</p>
<p>hi I&rsquo;ve been doing keto for two months</p>
<p>with the last month omad uh 24-hour fast</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hungry in the mornings I&rsquo;m hungry</p>
<p>and for lunch and after one o&rsquo;clock I</p>
<p>have zero energy and also got no bladder</p>
<p>and Hashimoto&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>um no gallbladder right</p>
<p>no okay</p>
<p>um can you just tell me roughly what you</p>
<p>eat when you eat that one meal</p>
<p>um eating clean so it&rsquo;ll be a piece of</p>
<p>grass-fed</p>
<p>beef and then uh something cruciferous</p>
<p>maybe some broccoli uh cauliflower</p>
<p>and cheese</p>
<p>maybe a few nuts</p>
<p>okay and when you crave uh what do you</p>
<p>crave</p>
<p>have cravings I&rsquo;m just hungry hungry</p>
<p>okay and um so you&rsquo;ve just pushed</p>
<p>through it and that hunger persists all</p>
<p>the way up until that one meal right yes</p>
<p>okay and do you have any other problems</p>
<p>with digestion I mean like do you feel</p>
<p>bloated</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>is it mean one meal yeah is it mainly</p>
<p>because of the broccoli or the</p>
<p>vegetables do you think</p>
<p>oh but I feel that way even in the</p>
<p>morning</p>
<p>I had a meal okay there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>things I would look at I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>exactly what&rsquo;s going on but I I feel</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either one of these two two or</p>
<p>three problems</p>
<p>um I you had the gallbladder removed um</p>
<p>You probably just don&rsquo;t have enough bile</p>
<p>to start to pull in these fat soluble</p>
<p>nutrients and so you don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the sensor is not uh connecting with the</p>
<p>the thermostat so now it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be satisfied if you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the bio biles uh helps you emulsify</p>
<p>these nutrients so you get really</p>
<p>satisfied so it&rsquo;s kind of like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating a food but you&rsquo;re not getting the</p>
<p>nutrients from the food as much so</p>
<p>um so you may need to add some bile</p>
<p>salts after you eat okay that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>um the other thing is um with the</p>
<p>thyroid I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>selenium but that&rsquo;s a really key thing</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>all thyroid problems and that can make a</p>
<p>big difference but I think um</p>
<p>the other thing that I would take</p>
<p>because really energy and um</p>
<p>metabolism</p>
<p>is all about the mitochondria</p>
<p>and I think a really good remedy for</p>
<p>that mitochondria is methylene blue and</p>
<p>you you take 40 drops in water in the</p>
<p>morning with a straw so it doesn&rsquo;t turn</p>
<p>your lips blue and maybe in the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder and the reason I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>even mentioning that is that that fix</p>
<p>that fixes your your cellular motor at</p>
<p>deep inside the cells it fixes that</p>
<p>machine that generates energy because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exhausted you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re tired uh</p>
<p>in the afternoon so it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something going on metabolically and yes</p>
<p>the thyroid controls that for sure but I</p>
<p>think that methylene blue will give you</p>
<p>a nice huge boost</p>
<p>um because it it gives your cells oxygen</p>
<p>and it speeds things up nicely even if</p>
<p>you have a thyroid issue and then the</p>
<p>bile thing is the other issue</p>
<p>last point I want to make is that um</p>
<p>you may want to look at and try the</p>
<p>carnivore for a little while because I</p>
<p>get the feeling that um</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want any bloating going on and</p>
<p>that bloating is means there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>going on with the digestion and you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>probably have to get an assessment to</p>
<p>figure that out but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>adding the fiber might</p>
<p>might actually worsen some gut issue</p>
<p>that you might have so and I mean just</p>
<p>the fact that you had your gallbladder</p>
<p>out tells me that there is a bile</p>
<p>deficiency and guess what your microbes</p>
<p>make bile so without</p>
<p>uh that could be one of the sources so</p>
<p>again there&rsquo;s this I&rsquo;m just kind of</p>
<p>giving you a few things to look at but</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>um try those things and then let us know</p>
<p>how how you do yeah looking forward to</p>
<p>hearing back from you Nancy you&rsquo;re again</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re disciplined and you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>problems and that&rsquo;s heartbreaking so</p>
<p>hope that resolves itself and we are so</p>
<p>proud that the audience is so quick</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve gotten through all the questions</p>
<p>today and here&rsquo;s the final one</p>
<p>all right why does your risk for</p>
<p>osteoporosis increase when you take</p>
<p>Synthroid or the synthetic thyroid</p>
<p>hormone</p>
<p>All Right audience get on it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you know what&rsquo;s going on let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see uh Debbie from YouTube what should</p>
<p>we do if walking which we like creates</p>
<p>knee pain</p>
<p>simple simple simple answer start</p>
<p>walking backwards</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you walk forward it&rsquo;s uh we we can</p>
<p>create a lot of knee problems when you</p>
<p>start walking backwards your knee pain</p>
<p>completely goes away and you start doing</p>
<p>that and just don&rsquo;t mention my name when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re walking in public backwards but</p>
<p>it does work</p>
<p>um I also do it uh uphill now and uh boy</p>
<p>your knees get so stable uh you can</p>
<p>watch the guy on um it&rsquo;s called knees</p>
<p>over toes guy on YouTube and he has a</p>
<p>lot of data on that he had bad knee</p>
<p>problems and he</p>
<p>I interviewed him you can fix your knees</p>
<p>by walking backwards</p>
<p>okay and then you can even pull a sled</p>
<p>going backwards to strengthen it after</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve walked enough</p>
<p>backwards interesting well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating why not go backwards all</p>
<p>right and here&rsquo;s something else that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrific for everyone uh uh for Juana</p>
<p>and Nancy and jatinder and Pascal all</p>
<p>watching Duty flee from The Green Room</p>
<p>you can download this app for free</p>
<p>whether you have an iPhone or Android</p>
<p>and find out about all these things Dr</p>
<p>Berg is talking about and again it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t cost you a dime so why not add</p>
<p>that to the thousands of apps you</p>
<p>already have also for those folks that</p>
<p>like for instance Pascal and Mexico well</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s delighted to hear that he can get</p>
<p>products there is that right Dr Berg do</p>
<p>they have product availability in Mexico</p>
<p>can you ship stuff down there I I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I don&rsquo;t think we do steep here oh</p>
<p>okay I don&rsquo;t think we do we&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>on it it&rsquo;s a bit more restricted so uh</p>
<p>yeah we don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think we do all</p>
<p>right well sorry for teasing you with</p>
<p>that Pascal but they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>on it uh and let&rsquo;s see what else do we</p>
<p>have to talk about let&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have a marathon now with</p>
<p>social media since everyone&rsquo;s behaved so</p>
<p>well and it gives us time so uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see uh Janice from YouTube what would be</p>
<p>the best supplements or minerals to take</p>
<p>to address lupus and lung cancer oh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry Janice</p>
<p>well lupus is an autoimmune and so</p>
<p>vitamin D is the most important one to</p>
<p>take in large quantities because you</p>
<p>want to reduce the inflammation</p>
<p>cancer we have a lot of videos on that</p>
<p>the best thing to do is to study that</p>
<p>study those videos because especially</p>
<p>the recent ones because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um the hands down the most powerful</p>
<p>thing you could do is prolong fasting</p>
<p>if you have some fat to lose that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be better but prolonged fasting</p>
<p>is the most important thing and then</p>
<p>trying to do whatever you can to keep</p>
<p>your stress down because the stress does</p>
<p>activate some of these cancer genes as</p>
<p>well but um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of great success on some</p>
<p>of my videos if you if you look at that</p>
<p>and of course we&rsquo;re not ever making any</p>
<p>claims and I&rsquo;m not selling any products</p>
<p>for cancer just watch the videos and um</p>
<p>get get educated on that topic</p>
<p>all right very good Ivan from YouTube</p>
<p>are we supposed to drink lemon water</p>
<p>every day while we&rsquo;re fasting won&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>break a fast</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s not a lot of calories in</p>
<p>lemon water</p>
<p>um so it&rsquo;s not gonna it&rsquo;s all based on</p>
<p>the calories right and and carbs it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be it&rsquo;s insignificant I would</p>
<p>add apple cider vinegar with that lemon</p>
<p>that would be awesome I had my</p>
<p>electrolyte powder in there I drink that</p>
<p>down</p>
<p>um that would actually be very</p>
<p>beneficial because um</p>
<p>you can actually get more energy too</p>
<p>from apple cider vinegar and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another thing that um</p>
<p>Nancy should try is to add the apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar to your water a teaspoon</p>
<p>drink that down because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that by itself just does give you more</p>
<p>energy and it helps with digestion so I</p>
<p>just from I just thought of that right</p>
<p>now I just remembered that right now wow</p>
<p>okay Terry on Facebook says his thyroid</p>
<p>is jacked and they can&rsquo;t find anything I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t quite sure what that means but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not feeling good my thyroid&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jacked right yeah so that&rsquo;s probably not</p>
<p>quite enough information once you write</p>
<p>us back give us a little bit more detail</p>
<p>on that</p>
<p>um like a hyperthyroid yeah I don&rsquo;t yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure all right well he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get back with us I&rsquo;m sure Lori</p>
<p>from YouTube what should I take to</p>
<p>address extremely painful arthritis in</p>
<p>the hands</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>um good remedy from standard process</p>
<p>called uh calamino</p>
<p>cal ammo it looks like c-a-l-a-m-o</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and that product acidifies uh the body</p>
<p>um to help with systemic inflammation</p>
<p>especially arthritis in the hands now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re on keto I&rsquo;m assuming</p>
<p>that you changed your diet you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting because if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t that could be</p>
<p>the problem I will be releasing a video</p>
<p>this week on arthritis</p>
<p>um what foods to eat what foods to avoid</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um I realized I didn&rsquo;t have a video on</p>
<p>that uh just a simple video on these are</p>
<p>the key Foods right here that you should</p>
<p>be focusing on but typically for the</p>
<p>hands</p>
<p>um you have to change the diet but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some quick remedies out there</p>
<p>that tend to work and cal ammo is a</p>
<p>really good one from Standard Process if</p>
<p>you have stiffness in your hands</p>
<p>all right here&rsquo;s a couple of questions I</p>
<p>might mix together Daniel from Facebook</p>
<p>for it&rsquo;s not a question it&rsquo;s a statement</p>
<p>your electrolyte powder is the best I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever used thank you and then someone</p>
<p>else is asking if potassium requirements</p>
<p>are the same for both men and women I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ve got potassium in that</p>
<p>powder don&rsquo;t you there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>potassium there&rsquo;s a thousand milligrams</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s similar as far as the</p>
<p>requirements um but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exact I think men need a little bit more</p>
<p>but uh the thing about potassium is that</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>um out of all the nutrients that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>one we need the most of and um how do</p>
<p>you get that</p>
<p>and from the foods you have to eat a lot</p>
<p>of uh green things green salads things</p>
<p>like that</p>
<p>um a lot of people don&rsquo;t so this is a</p>
<p>good way to enhance it but potassium is</p>
<p>one of those minerals that if you even</p>
<p>take extra it kind of goes out to the</p>
<p>urine it doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not like like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking iron that gets stuck in</p>
<p>your body</p>
<p>and potassium is</p>
<p>is very healthy for your kidneys unless</p>
<p>you have stage five uh kidney disease</p>
<p>which is very rare but other than that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s protective against the kidney and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the most important things</p>
<p>with the keto especially since you lose</p>
<p>a lot of water</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>potassium is also good for</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the heart arrhythmias and also to keep</p>
<p>your pulse rate in check I have a lot of</p>
<p>videos on potassium and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient potassium you&rsquo;ll get tired as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>interesting well I like your potassium</p>
<p>your electrolyte product and audience</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to brag about it one of those</p>
<p>jugs is a great value because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little scooper and it lasts a long time</p>
<p>it tastes great Stir It Up in some water</p>
<p>or whatever and you can&rsquo;t go wrong so</p>
<p>1000 milligrams that sounds pretty good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great product Dr Berg let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;re talking about that I</p>
<p>released a video today which probably</p>
<p>many people already saw but I do I show</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>um how to test products for hidden</p>
<p>starches like maltodextrin and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that electrolyte powder I did that test</p>
<p>on my electrolyte powder versus another</p>
<p>company and you can see the results</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look good for the other company</p>
<p>they have some hidden maltodextrin</p>
<p>despite saying no starch or no carbs</p>
<p>interesting okay poor Lorraine from</p>
<p>Facebook what uh would help out with my</p>
<p>uh with myof myofascial pain syndrome</p>
<p>well myofascial problems uh you know in</p>
<p>practice I I noticed some interesting</p>
<p>things about myofascial problems it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually on the right side of the body</p>
<p>and if it is in the right side</p>
<p>in the upper right quadrant we know the</p>
<p>gallbladder is involved and if you did</p>
<p>that gallbladder massage and it probably</p>
<p>just goes right away so instead of uh</p>
<p>going down a path that you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do a lot of treatment and testing</p>
<p>change the diet support the gallbladder</p>
<p>and see if that mild fascial problem</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t just disappear magically but if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other myofascial problems from</p>
<p>from old injuries then now we have to do</p>
<p>some great myofascial stretches and</p>
<p>exercises depending on what you injured</p>
<p>and I had a lot of videos in that as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>but on that note Steve on the note of</p>
<p>fascial pain myofascial pain I really</p>
<p>appreciate all of you sticking around</p>
<p>this long to watch the end of this video</p>
<p>have a wonderful weekend and we will see</p>
<p>you tomorrow morning when I release the</p>
<p>next video</p>
