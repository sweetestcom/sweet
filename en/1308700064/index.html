    <p>Our card this week is Sherry Black, the Nine of Hearts from Utah.</p>
<p>In November of 2010, the community of South Salt Lake was shocked by the vicious murder</p>
<p>of a beloved great-grandmother.</p>
<p>Investigators chased leads and interviewed suspects, utilizing every resource at their</p>
<p>disposal to learn who could have committed such a brutal crime and why.</p>
<p>But those answers and justice would remain elusive for nearly a decade, until a dogged</p>
<p>investigator cracked the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was just after 1.40 in the afternoon when Earl Black got home from work, and he went</p>
<p>to let his wife know that he was back.</p>
<p>But he called out for his 64-year-old wife Sherry in their house and didn&rsquo;t get an</p>
<p>answer, so he figured that she was working right next door in this little outbuilding</p>
<p>that they had that Sherry ran a bookstore from.</p>
<p>And this place is itty-bitty, you can see almost the whole thing from the front door</p>
<p>of the shop, so he was surprised when he walked inside and didn&rsquo;t see Sherry sitting at</p>
<p>the front counter or organizing a collection of rare books on the shelves.</p>
<p>Now he knew she was around because her car was outside, so he made his way to the back</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know it in that moment, but at 1.43 p.m. on November 30th, 2010, his whole</p>
<p>life was about to change.</p>
<p>I am in a house, and it&rsquo;s my shop.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the name of the business?</p>
<p>30, uh, B&amp;W Billiard.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m going to help credit you, okay, sir?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to ask you a few more questions while I help us on the way.</p>
<p>Oh, f**k.</p>
<p>Oh, f**k.</p>
<p>Is she awake?</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>Okay, is she breathing at all?</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>Oh, f**k.</p>
<p>Oh, f**k.</p>
<p>Is the person who did this, could they still be nearby?</p>
<p>I doubt it.</p>
<p>Is there any serious bleeding?</p>
<p>Oh, just get here.</p>
<p>Okay, I do have help on the way.</p>
<p>I need to ask you some more questions just to get help started, okay?</p>
<p>No, just get here.</p>
<p>Okay, I have help on the way to you.</p>
<p>Is there any serious bleeding?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, f**k.</p>
<p>Okay, listen carefully.</p>
<p>I want you to lay her flat on her back and remove any pillows.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t touched her.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can you get next to her to see if we can start CPR on her?</p>
<p>Oh, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>Oh, f**k.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>What the&hellip;</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Okay, let me give you some CPR instructions to help her, okay?</p>
<p>Uh, f**k.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t handle this.</p>
<p>Okay, I need you to get next to her and look in her mouth for any food or vomit, okay?</p>
<p>Hey, she&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>Just get here.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to do CPR?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>F**k them.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Sherry&rsquo;s been murdered.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea who could have done this, sir?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bookstore.</p>
<p>I have no f**king idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bookstore?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to talk to my grandson at the same&hellip;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I got a wrong number.</p>
<p>No, sir, are you talking to me or her right now?</p>
<p>I was talking to somebody on the phone.</p>
<p>Okay, just to verify, you&rsquo;re at 3466 South 700 East?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>A bookstore.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a bookstore.</p>
<p>Sir, we&rsquo;re just arriving, sir.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just arriving.</p>
<p>This is the dispatcher.</p>
<p>Just stay on the phone with my friend, okay?</p>
<p>Any idea who could have done this?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do you know what time frame this could have happened between?</p>
<p>Hey, I just got home.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
<p>No, don&rsquo;t hang up, sir.</p>
<p>Sir, are you still there?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Police arrived at the scene within minutes,</p>
<p>where a distraught Earl told them what he had found,</p>
<p>which was his wife lying on the floor</p>
<p>face up in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>Her pants and underwear were pulled down,</p>
<p>her shirt and bra were pushed up,</p>
<p>and stuck in her chest</p>
<p>was the pair of heavy scissors</p>
<p>Sherry would use to pack up books for shipping.</p>
<p>Officers did a sweep of the store</p>
<p>and determined that the only person inside</p>
<p>was Sherry, and it was too late</p>
<p>to save her.</p>
<p>Since she was already gone, officers decided</p>
<p>not to let paramedics inside</p>
<p>in the interest of preserving the scene.</p>
<p>Instead, they called in backup</p>
<p>and the state&rsquo;s evidence processing team</p>
<p>to meticulously comb through the shop.</p>
<p>And while they were hard at work,</p>
<p>officers got statements from the only</p>
<p>two people there, Earl and his</p>
<p>employee, this guy named Mike.</p>
<p>You see, both men were on a job site</p>
<p>building a pool table for a customer.</p>
<p>That business Earl mentioned in the call,</p>
<p>B&amp;W Billiards and Books,</p>
<p>was his and Sherry&rsquo;s business, a combo</p>
<p>of a bookstore and a billiard shop.</p>
<p>Sherry had the books, and Earl</p>
<p>had the pool tables.</p>
<p>Both men essentially told police this same story.</p>
<p>Earl left his house at around</p>
<p>9.30 or so, and then from his house</p>
<p>he drove over to pick up Mike,</p>
<p>and the two spent the morning and early afternoon</p>
<p>assembling the pool table at their customer&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>They got back to the Blacks at about</p>
<p>1.40 p.m., and that&rsquo;s when Earl found</p>
<p>Sherry&rsquo;s body. When police spoke</p>
<p>to Mike, he said that he&rsquo;d known the couple</p>
<p>for more than two decades and had no</p>
<p>idea who would do this.</p>
<p>Everyone loved Sherry.</p>
<p>She and Earl had no enemies. Nobody</p>
<p>would want to harm them. Earl,</p>
<p>meanwhile, was devastated.</p>
<p>Investigators eventually had to</p>
<p>cut his interview short when he broke</p>
<p>down in tears and asked if they could</p>
<p>call anyone to come sit with him.</p>
<p>But he assured them that he had already</p>
<p>contacted his and Sherry&rsquo;s daughter, Heidi</p>
<p>Miller, who was on the way. Heidi</p>
<p>told me that she was at home with one of</p>
<p>her daughters when she first heard from her dad.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s killed your mom.</p>
<p>You need to get her. Just something that</p>
<p>you never,</p>
<p>you never in your wildest dreams expect to hear.</p>
<p>Heidi and one of her daughters</p>
<p>raced over to her parents&rsquo; house in disbelief,</p>
<p>where they met up with more family.</p>
<p>Like Earl and Mike, Heidi couldn&rsquo;t think of</p>
<p>anyone who would do this, but she</p>
<p>did have some information for officers</p>
<p>that helped narrow down</p>
<p>the time of Sherry&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Heidi told officers at the scene</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;d tried to get in touch with</p>
<p>Sherry all morning.</p>
<p>I called a number of times, started at about</p>
<p>10 o&rsquo;clock and she didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>And that wasn&rsquo;t typical of her. She was</p>
<p>either at home and would answer on the</p>
<p>home phone or had her cell phone with her.</p>
<p>And I just had this weird</p>
<p>feeling that something wasn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>If everyone&rsquo;s timelines were</p>
<p>accurate, that meant Sherry was alive</p>
<p>when Earl left that morning and</p>
<p>probably dead or with</p>
<p>her killer by the time Heidi called,</p>
<p>leaving just a half an hour or so</p>
<p>window for this whole thing to happen.</p>
<p>South Salt Lake PD took</p>
<p>Sherry&rsquo;s family to the police station so</p>
<p>detectives could formally question Earl</p>
<p>and learn more about his and Sherry&rsquo;s relationship.</p>
<p>He told them that the two had married</p>
<p>in their teens when Earl,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a year younger than Sherry, was just a</p>
<p>senior in high school. According</p>
<p>to CBS News reporter Julia</p>
<p>Dahl, Sherry spent years as</p>
<p>a stay-at-home mom to their kids, Heidi</p>
<p>and Jason, while Earl ran his</p>
<p>pool table business. But Jason</p>
<p>died from a gun-related accident in</p>
<ol start="1989">
<li>And after</li>
</ol>
<p>his tragic death, Sherry turned her passion</p>
<p>for books into a business</p>
<p>venture. Sherry specialized</p>
<p>in rare collectible children&rsquo;s books</p>
<p>and books from the Church of Jesus</p>
<p>Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d visited thrift stores and estate</p>
<p>sales to find books that she would resell,</p>
<p>some for thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>And she had a regular routine.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Earl.</p>
<p>She would get up early and</p>
<p>first thing she&rsquo;d do is grab a cup of coffee</p>
<p>and go out in the shop and</p>
<p>jump on the computer and start</p>
<p>putting books online and</p>
<p>see what orders she had.</p>
<p>Police learned Sherry spent her days</p>
<p>hunting for bargains at Desiree</p>
<p>Industries, which is like a Latter-day</p>
<p>Saints version of Goodwill. And she would</p>
<p>take their dog to the park, she would run errands,</p>
<p>and she spent a lot of time selling</p>
<p>books. And Earl said there was</p>
<p>nothing going on in their lives that</p>
<p>would make Sherry a target.</p>
<p>They had a big, happy family.</p>
<p>Six grandchildren, one great-grandchild,</p>
<p>and another even on the way.</p>
<p>All in all, they lived a</p>
<p>low-key, quiet life together.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not sure why,</p>
<p>but investigators didn&rsquo;t question</p>
<p>any other members of Sherry&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>that night. Everyone was allowed</p>
<p>to leave, including Earl. Between</p>
<p>his alibi, which they were able to verify</p>
<p>quickly, and his obvious distress, police</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t seem to consider him much of a suspect.</p>
<p>My dad, he</p>
<p>had to be escorted into his home to get</p>
<p>his toothbrush and a couple things.</p>
<p>And we took him</p>
<p>to my home and he never</p>
<p>slept in his home again.</p>
<p>That home, or at least the</p>
<p>bookstore next to it, was a crime scene now.</p>
<p>And even if it would eventually</p>
<p>be cleaned up, it would always be</p>
<p>a crime scene to Earl.</p>
<p>The scene told investigators that the crime</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t appear to be well-planned or</p>
<p>well-organized. As far as they could tell,</p>
<p>the killer hadn&rsquo;t brought their own weapon with them,</p>
<p>hence why they used the shears.</p>
<p>Next to Sherry&rsquo;s body was</p>
<p>broken glass, which officers determined</p>
<p>came from an antique soda bottle that she</p>
<p>kept on a shelf by the cash register.</p>
<p>And whatever had happened,</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t go down without a fight.</p>
<p>Because in addition to the stab wounds</p>
<p>and bruising, they could see what looked like</p>
<p>defensive wounds on her hands.</p>
<p>It was also obvious that the</p>
<p>brunt of the attack happened in the</p>
<p>stockroom, because as gruesome</p>
<p>as it was back there, they only</p>
<p>found a few bloodstains in the</p>
<p>common area, and they weren&rsquo;t super</p>
<p>noticeable unless you were actually looking</p>
<p>for them. But the good</p>
<p>news, if any news can</p>
<p>be good in a situation like this,</p>
<p>was that investigators quickly found</p>
<p>some key pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>First was an imitation</p>
<p>Armani Exchange men&rsquo;s belt</p>
<p>near Sherry&rsquo;s body. It was size</p>
<p>36 to 38, brown,</p>
<p>with a square silver buckle.</p>
<p>On the front of the buckle were</p>
<p>the letters AX, and on the</p>
<p>back was a sticker with the number</p>
<p>323 on it, which police thought</p>
<p>could be a store item or</p>
<p>inventory number. They also</p>
<p>found a bloody palm print and</p>
<p>fingerprint on the stockroom door,</p>
<p>and two more bloody fingerprints</p>
<p>on the doorframe. They didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>yet if the prints had been left in Sherry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blood or the killer&rsquo;s, but either</p>
<p>way, this felt incredibly promising.</p>
<p>Law enforcement</p>
<p>worked through the night, and on Wednesday</p>
<p>December 1st, as techs were still</p>
<p>pouring over the shop, Sherry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>autopsy was conducted. The</p>
<p>medical examiner found that she had been stabbed</p>
<p>eight times in the head, neck,</p>
<p>chest, torso, and abdomen.</p>
<p>There were also indications</p>
<p>of sexual assault. A bite mark</p>
<p>on her breast, slash marks</p>
<p>around her nipple, and bruising in her</p>
<p>vaginal area. What the</p>
<p>autopsy really couldn&rsquo;t tell investigators</p>
<p>was why this happened.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think robbery</p>
<p>was the motive. Sherry had still</p>
<p>been wearing her diamond jewelry, and</p>
<p>there was still cash in the register.</p>
<p>Even the safe where she kept her most</p>
<p>valuable books hadn&rsquo;t been disturbed.</p>
<p>That being said, though, they</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t totally rule out robbery</p>
<p>either. I mean, the store was</p>
<p>filled to the brim with literally</p>
<p>tens of thousands of books.</p>
<p>She had</p>
<p>64,000 books.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;d walk in the bookstore, it just looked like</p>
<p>kind of craziness, you know?</p>
<p>Stacks of books, and</p>
<p>she knew how they were organized,</p>
<p>but for those of us</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t, it was very overwhelming.</p>
<p>And Sherry hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>kept any written inventory, because</p>
<p>she kept it all in her head.</p>
<p>So, if there were any missing</p>
<p>books, they had no hope of</p>
<p>tracking them down.</p>
<p>As investigators continued</p>
<p>searching for leads, news of Sherry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder spread far and fast</p>
<p>through the South Salt Lake community.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned and wondered</p>
<p>how someone could commit such a heinous</p>
<p>crime in broad daylight and</p>
<p>get away with it with no one seeing them.</p>
<p>That Wednesday, police gave</p>
<p>reporters some updates, but</p>
<p>they shared very few details</p>
<p>other than that they had no suspects</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t know what the motive could be.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t reveal that Sherry had</p>
<p>been sexually assaulted, or that</p>
<p>shears, rather than a knife, were used</p>
<p>in the stabbing. That would be</p>
<p>information that only the killer would know,</p>
<p>and police wanted to keep it close</p>
<p>to the vest. But they did</p>
<p>appeal to the public for help.</p>
<p>According to KSL News,</p>
<p>they wanted to talk to any witnesses</p>
<p>who were in the area from 8 a.m., when</p>
<p>Sherry opened the shop, until the time</p>
<p>her body was found. Especially</p>
<p>anyone who saw a car speeding away</p>
<p>or maybe somebody running from the area.</p>
<p>Someone who might</p>
<p>have been covered in blood.</p>
<p>And there was someone in particular</p>
<p>that they wanted to speak with.</p>
<p>Earl had told detectives that he heard</p>
<p>Sherry on the phone with a customer</p>
<p>that morning before he left work.</p>
<p>A man who was supposed to come pick up</p>
<p>a book that day. So maybe he</p>
<p>saw something. And luckily,</p>
<p>that man reached out to police.</p>
<p>The customer told detectives</p>
<p>he called Sherry twice on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>First at 9-0-9 to discuss</p>
<p>the purchase and to make plans for picking</p>
<p>up the book. Then he called her again</p>
<p>at 9-53, this time to tell her that he</p>
<p>was running late because of traffic.</p>
<p>He said Sherry picked up the phone for the second</p>
<p>call and told him it was fine. She&rsquo;d wait for him.</p>
<p>But when he got there</p>
<p>around 10-30, the lights on</p>
<p>the B&amp;W sign were off.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t see her in the shop.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Ben Pender, a detective</p>
<p>with the Unified Police Department of</p>
<p>Greater Salt Lake.</p>
<p>Just kind of looks around in the</p>
<p>common area for her and doesn&rsquo;t see her</p>
<p>even goes next door to her house</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s on the same property</p>
<p>and knocks on the door. I think he</p>
<p>opens the door and hollers into her.</p>
<p>This customer didn&rsquo;t find Sherry</p>
<p>anywhere, but he knew that she</p>
<p>was expecting him. So he went back</p>
<p>into the bookstore where he hung around</p>
<p>for like 40 to 45 minutes</p>
<p>thinking she&rsquo;d return. He told</p>
<p>police that he didn&rsquo;t check for her in the stockroom</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t generally open to customers.</p>
<p>And he said he hadn&rsquo;t seen anything alarming</p>
<p>in the main area of the store.</p>
<p>I think he was looking for her</p>
<p>and probably not paying attention to any</p>
<p>of those other details and not imagining</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s walked into.</p>
<p>So, assuming this guy wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the killer, and detectives didn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to think he was, they realized</p>
<p>that Sherry must have been</p>
<p>dead by the time he pulled into</p>
<p>the Black&rsquo;s driveway. In fact,</p>
<p>he was probably the last person to speak</p>
<p>with her. So that meant one of two things.</p>
<p>Either someone came into the</p>
<p>store, brutally murdered Sherry,</p>
<p>and left in just 35 minutes,</p>
<p>or someone came into the store,</p>
<p>brutally murdered Sherry, heard</p>
<p>the customer arrive, and hid</p>
<p>until he left. Either way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the bulk of this terrible</p>
<p>interaction happening in</p>
<p>35 minutes.</p>
<p>There was that small window. It&rsquo;s almost as</p>
<p>though somebody may have seen Earl leave</p>
<p>and knew that they</p>
<p>had X amount of time. It was just</p>
<p>unbelievable that that person could get in,</p>
<p>do this crime in that short amount of time, and be</p>
<p>gone. That customer</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t the only person who stopped by that</p>
<p>day. He told police that while</p>
<p>he was waiting for Sherry, a second man</p>
<p>came in hoping to sell a book.</p>
<p>He left when he realized the store owner wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there, and then a third person</p>
<p>pulled into the driveway around noon</p>
<p>but figured that the store was closed since</p>
<p>the sign wasn&rsquo;t on, and they left without going</p>
<p>inside. Now, keep in mind,</p>
<p>the bookstore wasn&rsquo;t a mainstream</p>
<p>Barnes and Noble type of place</p>
<p>with people randomly stopping by to browse</p>
<p>the latest titles. Because of the shop&rsquo;s</p>
<p>location and its niche market,</p>
<p>most of Sherry&rsquo;s business was done</p>
<p>by appointment only. Basically, the way</p>
<p>Detective Pender described it to me is that</p>
<p>the bookstore was open when she was around</p>
<p>and closed when she wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This cozy little shop, tucked back</p>
<p>from the road off an eight-lane highway</p>
<p>seemed like the most unlikely</p>
<p>place in the world for a random</p>
<p>crime to occur.</p>
<p>It was a very busy street, but all along</p>
<p>the street were houses, and</p>
<p>her house was right next to the bookstore,</p>
<p>and the bookstore was just</p>
<p>set back, even from the house.</p>
<p>I actually</p>
<p>went to Utah and saw the property</p>
<p>for myself, and even with</p>
<p>the sign the blacks kept outside,</p>
<p>it is not the type of place that you</p>
<p>just stumble upon by accident.</p>
<p>In fact, when officers canvassed the</p>
<p>neighborhood, lots of the people that they spoke with</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even realize there was a bookstore there.</p>
<p>Only a few had ever</p>
<p>been inside, and many of them</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know Earl and Sherry at all,</p>
<p>even though the couple had lived there for decades.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s mostly</p>
<p>because this area is home to a</p>
<p>highly mobile population with lots</p>
<p>of renters, most of whom</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t fall into the target demographics</p>
<p>of either side of the blacks'</p>
<p>business. But the people who did</p>
<p>know Sherry and Earl had nothing</p>
<p>bad to say about them.</p>
<p>Detectives and Sherry&rsquo;s loved ones</p>
<p>were at a loss. With no</p>
<p>motive and no suspects,</p>
<p>the possibilities were frustratingly</p>
<p>endless. And without</p>
<p>much else to go on, Sherry&rsquo;s business</p>
<p>became a focal point of the</p>
<p>investigation as police</p>
<p>waited for lab test results.</p>
<p>When police asked around to local rare books</p>
<p>and antiques dealers, they learned</p>
<p>that Sherry was well-known and respected</p>
<p>in that circle, a circle</p>
<p>that was just as bewildered and</p>
<p>scared as the rest of the community.</p>
<p>One bookseller who knew Sherry told</p>
<p>KSL News that this sort of thing</p>
<p>quote, doesn&rsquo;t happen in the</p>
<p>usually genteel world</p>
<p>of books, end quote.</p>
<p>But as police found out,</p>
<p>that world was actually home to</p>
<p>some pretty shady characters.</p>
<p>In fact, Salt Lake City</p>
<p>Weekly reporter Stephen Dark had interviewed</p>
<p>Sherry a few years before this for</p>
<p>an article about the murky underbelly</p>
<p>of the used books and antiques trade.</p>
<p>The piece followed a man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quest to recover some Latter-day Saints</p>
<p>artifacts and artwork after they were</p>
<p>stolen from his home. Sherry,</p>
<p>not knowing the stuff was stolen, had</p>
<p>actually purchased some old photographs</p>
<p>from one of the thieves, a guy named</p>
<p>Gerald Corey Lloyd, who the reporter</p>
<p>described as quote, a one-time</p>
<p>antique dealer, picker, forger,</p>
<p>and meth addict, end quote.</p>
<p>The check Sherry paid</p>
<p>Gerald was eventually used as</p>
<p>evidence against him in court, and</p>
<p>he was convicted of burglary.</p>
<p>When Sherry was killed, he was still</p>
<p>in jail undergoing treatment for</p>
<p>substance use disorder, so he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a suspect. But after the murder,</p>
<p>Stephen Dark went to visit Gerald</p>
<p>to see what he made of this whole situation.</p>
<p>Gerald told the reporter that</p>
<p>he felt a little guilty.</p>
<p>You see, before the stolen photograph fiasco,</p>
<p>Gerald had sold Sherry an expensive</p>
<p>book, and she was so nice to him.</p>
<p>He essentially gave her an underworld</p>
<p>stamp of approval.</p>
<p>He said that he told other pickers that he</p>
<p>knew about her sweetness and generosity,</p>
<p>and once he put the word out, Sherry</p>
<p>was added to an unofficial group</p>
<p>of secondhand books and antiques dealers</p>
<p>that they could sell stuff to.</p>
<p>So any of those shady</p>
<p>people he knew could have targeted her.</p>
<p>Gerald said that he was totally</p>
<p>convinced that her murder was</p>
<p>related to Latter-day Saints memorabilia</p>
<p>and methamphetamine.</p>
<p>And it seemed like he might be onto</p>
<p>something, because as police</p>
<p>quickly realized, Gerald wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the only person Sherry helped put in jail.</p>
<p>Detectives</p>
<p>learned that in early 2009,</p>
<p>Sherry had bought some rare Latter-day</p>
<p>Saints books from a 20-year-old man</p>
<p>named Lauren Nielsen.</p>
<p>She paid $20,000 for</p>
<p>14 books, a good deal considering</p>
<p>she estimated that they were worth more than</p>
<p>twice that. But she found out</p>
<p>it was too good to be true when police</p>
<p>contacted her. It turned out</p>
<p>that Lauren had stolen the books from his</p>
<p>father, a well-known church</p>
<p>president. According to Deseret</p>
<p>News reporter Paul Koepp, when</p>
<p>his father found out, he confronted Lauren,</p>
<p>who warned him not to get law enforcement</p>
<p>involved because he was in a gang</p>
<p>called the Juggalos. Now the</p>
<p>FBI classifies the Juggalos as a</p>
<p>loosely organized hybrid</p>
<p>gang whose members religiously follow</p>
<p>the rap group Insane Clown</p>
<p>Posse. They&rsquo;ve been known to commit</p>
<p>assaults, robberies, vandalism,</p>
<p>and even murder.</p>
<p>Sherry was mortified when she found</p>
<p>out that the books were stolen, and she had</p>
<p>already sold one to another book dealer, but</p>
<p>she quickly returned the others and helped</p>
<p>with the investigation. Lauren</p>
<p>was arrested and sentenced to 90 days</p>
<p>in jail after he pled guilty to felony</p>
<p>theft charges. Lauren&rsquo;s</p>
<p>father told police his son had threatened</p>
<p>him before and had a history of</p>
<p>carrying weapons. And since</p>
<p>Sherry was instrumental in putting him in jail,</p>
<p>police wondered if he was angry enough</p>
<p>to kill over it. This was the</p>
<p>most promising lead investigators</p>
<p>had. And as luck would</p>
<p>have it, within a week of Sherry&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>they arrested Lauren on an outstanding</p>
<p>warrant for violating his probation.</p>
<p>So while he was in jail,</p>
<p>they questioned him about Sherry.</p>
<p>He admitted that he had</p>
<p>sold some books to her and admitted what he had done</p>
<p>in the past, but denied any</p>
<p>involvement in this particular case.</p>
<p>It was around this time that early</p>
<p>lab results started coming back,</p>
<p>and investigators realized that they</p>
<p>had crucial evidence about the</p>
<p>killer&rsquo;s identity. They had</p>
<p>his DNA.</p>
<p>It turns out that bloody palm print</p>
<p>left on the door was in the killer&rsquo;s blood,</p>
<p>not Sherry&rsquo;s. Investigators</p>
<p>figured that he must have hurt his hand while</p>
<p>he was stabbing Sherry, and it was enough</p>
<p>blood that they were able to get a</p>
<p>full DNA profile.</p>
<p>Now, they knew this DNA belonged</p>
<p>to a male, and they used it to</p>
<p>rule out two key people,</p>
<p>Lauren and that customer who had been</p>
<p>in the store that day.</p>
<p>It also wasn&rsquo;t a match for Earl,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think surprised anyone.</p>
<p>But what was surprising,</p>
<p>considering the violent nature of the crime,</p>
<p>was that there was no match in</p>
<p>CODIS either. So in</p>
<p>all likelihood, whoever killed</p>
<p>Sherry didn&rsquo;t have a felony record.</p>
<p>Although, as Detective</p>
<p>Pender pointed out, they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really rule someone out 100%</p>
<p>from the DNA alone.</p>
<p>I mean, for all they knew, more than one person</p>
<p>could have been involved.</p>
<p>And what about the fingerprints, you&rsquo;re asking?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a whole different database</p>
<p>for those. The fingerprints</p>
<p>they found were actually poor quality.</p>
<p>In fact, under normal circumstances,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t have even been submitted to</p>
<p>law enforcement fingerprint databases.</p>
<p>However, due to the nature of this case,</p>
<p>the crime lab pushed them through.</p>
<p>But they still didn&rsquo;t get any hits there either.</p>
<p>So police turned to</p>
<p>their other big piece of evidence,</p>
<p>the belt. No one from</p>
<p>Sherry&rsquo;s family recognized it, and</p>
<p>investigators didn&rsquo;t think that it had been</p>
<p>used in the attack because Sherry didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any injuries that matched up with it.</p>
<p>But it was so close</p>
<p>to her body that they were confident</p>
<p>it was the killer&rsquo;s. And they were</p>
<p>proven right when they tested the belt for</p>
<p>DNA, and it came back with the</p>
<p>same unknown male DNA</p>
<p>as the bloody handprint.</p>
<p>With no other leads, police released</p>
<p>photos and details about the belt</p>
<p>to the public. According</p>
<p>to Salt Lake Tribune reporter Nate Carlisle,</p>
<p>it was unique, and they hoped</p>
<p>that someone would recognize it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, they were flooded with tips.</p>
<p>It seemed like everyone knew</p>
<p>someone who knew someone else who had</p>
<p>a neighbor who wore that type of belt.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none</p>
<p>of those tips led anywhere.</p>
<p>Even after Sherry&rsquo;s family created</p>
<p>a website for her case and put up</p>
<p>billboards seeking information.</p>
<p>By late March, still</p>
<p>with no leads or suspects, police</p>
<p>held a press conference to share the fact</p>
<p>that they had the killer&rsquo;s DNA.</p>
<p>They also announced a $50,000</p>
<p>reward for information leading to</p>
<p>the arrest and conviction of those responsible</p>
<p>for Sherry&rsquo;s death. And Heidi</p>
<p>also issued this heartbreaking</p>
<p>plea.</p>
<p>I miss my mom so much, I can&rsquo;t even begin</p>
<p>to explain the pain that I feel.</p>
<p>The person who took her away from our</p>
<p>family needs to be caught and put</p>
<p>away so that they don&rsquo;t hurt anyone else.</p>
<p>They are a danger to our community.</p>
<p>My mom was a warm,</p>
<p>loving, kind</p>
<p>and generous woman.</p>
<p>She was a wonderful wife, mother,</p>
<p>grandmother and great grandmother</p>
<p>and friend. We miss</p>
<p>her every minute of every day.</p>
<p>If you have any information, please help us.</p>
<p>If the person who killed her is listening,</p>
<p>please turn yourself in.</p>
<p>As tips came in,</p>
<p>police consulted with the FBI&rsquo;s</p>
<p>behavioral analysis unit.</p>
<p>And in April, the unit issued</p>
<p>a lengthy report. Their</p>
<p>theory was that a single offender killed</p>
<p>Sherry and that the crime</p>
<p>was sexually motivated.</p>
<p>Maybe the offender becomes</p>
<p>sexually aroused by</p>
<p>the eroticized violence.</p>
<p>They just kind of find it out. You know, she</p>
<p>was alone in the bookstore. The bookstore</p>
<p>is concealed from the view of traffic.</p>
<p>The offender targeted the victim.</p>
<p>It appears the offender had been in</p>
<p>the store previously. The offender</p>
<p>could be a customer of either Earl&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or Sherry&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Even though the FBI believed there was</p>
<p>planning and surveillance involved</p>
<p>in the murder, they agreed with the police&rsquo;s</p>
<p>initial assessment that the suspect</p>
<p>appeared to be criminally unsophisticated</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t bring his own</p>
<p>weapon and wasn&rsquo;t skilled at using</p>
<p>the one he chose.</p>
<p>And the timing of this attack also</p>
<p>told them something. Not just</p>
<p>that maybe he was familiar with the couple</p>
<p>or saw Earl leave and targeted Sherry,</p>
<p>but the fact that this happened</p>
<p>mid-morning on a weekday</p>
<p>suggested that he had the freedom</p>
<p>and flexibility to commit the crime without</p>
<p>anyone noticing he was gone,</p>
<p>perhaps due to a job that was</p>
<p>somewhat unsupervised or allowed him to</p>
<p>travel. What&rsquo;s interesting to me</p>
<p>as I was looking into this early on was that</p>
<p>Earl had just gotten back from</p>
<p>a long hunting trip a few days before</p>
<p>the murder. Sherry had been home</p>
<p>by herself for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>So that begged the question,</p>
<p>if someone was watching her</p>
<p>in the time leading up to the murder,</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t they attack when Earl was away?</p>
<p>Why take that extra</p>
<p>risk? The FBI believed</p>
<p>that the killer might strike again</p>
<p>if the opportunity presented</p>
<p>itself. And that was everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>biggest fear. Whoever this</p>
<p>guy was, he had clearly</p>
<p>been flying under the radar.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t know if that was because he</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t committing any crimes</p>
<p>or he just wasn&rsquo;t getting caught.</p>
<p>For Sherry&rsquo;s family,</p>
<p>it was torment. They wondered</p>
<p>if they knew the killer. Was he in</p>
<p>line next to them at the grocery store</p>
<p>watching them as they went about their lives?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of Sherry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>granddaughters, Alyssa.</p>
<p>You really, like, go through</p>
<p>everyone that you know and it</p>
<p>kind of changes the way that you</p>
<p>look at people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything to</p>
<p>describe that kind of pain.</p>
<p>And knowing that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lost her, but also thinking</p>
<p>about what she went through.</p>
<p>A lot of anger that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>or whoever did it is out there</p>
<p>living their life.</p>
<p>That year, a local forensic consulting</p>
<p>firm unveiled a method of testing</p>
<p>DNA that could help determine someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>genetic ancestry.</p>
<p>The results weren&rsquo;t precise. They could only</p>
<p>break down ancestral mixes into</p>
<p>five broad categories.</p>
<p>But South Salt Lake police decided it was</p>
<p>better than nothing. And in May,</p>
<p>they learned that Sherry&rsquo;s killer was</p>
<p>of 46.2%</p>
<p>West African descent.</p>
<p>And while they couldn&rsquo;t narrow down the other half,</p>
<p>it was a surprise to Sherry&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>because in Utah and</p>
<p>specifically South Salt Lake County,</p>
<p>the people there are overwhelmingly</p>
<p>white. So this narrowed</p>
<p>down the suspect pool significantly.</p>
<p>But the new info</p>
<p>still didn&rsquo;t provide answers.</p>
<p>Though another person of interest surfaced</p>
<p>in the first year of the investigation.</p>
<p>In November 2011, KSTU</p>
<p>TV reported that police were</p>
<p>looking into a 22-year-old man</p>
<p>named Helaman Pergana.</p>
<p>He had just been arrested that month for</p>
<p>a string of robberies and sexual assaults</p>
<p>across South Lake County.</p>
<p>But his MO was approaching women at ATMs,</p>
<p>robbing them at gunpoint,</p>
<p>kidnapping, and then sexually assaulting</p>
<p>them. And once they compared his</p>
<p>DNA to Sherry&rsquo;s killer, and it wasn&rsquo;t a match,</p>
<p>it was back to square one.</p>
<p>Just before the</p>
<p>one-year anniversary of Sherry&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>her family held a press conference in the</p>
<p>bookstore to draw attention back to her</p>
<p>case. Earl hadn&rsquo;t even reopened</p>
<p>the business, but he told Deseret News</p>
<p>reporter Pat Reavy that they</p>
<p>hoped to at some point.</p>
<p>Ironically,</p>
<p>it was a book that gave</p>
<p>Heidi an idea of how they might</p>
<p>be able to catch Sherry&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll have to tell you about</p>
<p>what Heidi learned, and how the course</p>
<p>of the investigation changed.</p>
<p>So please, go listen to Part 2</p>
