<p>leila turoff [Applause]</p>
<p>thank you so much for a kind and generous introduction and for the</p>
<p>opportunity to speak to the classes of 2020 and 2021</p>
<p>your families your friends and your loved ones it&rsquo;s an incredible honor to</p>
<p>return to my alma mater as your commencement speaker</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a true privilege to personally congratulate all of you on earning your</p>
<p>mba from haas and i&rsquo;d like to pause just for a minute</p>
<p>and appreciate how seriously fortunate we all are to be here today and to be</p>
<p>associated with this world-renowned institution</p>
<p>aha&rsquo;s degree is an instant signal to employers and colleagues that you bring</p>
<p>the value of a business school education that is both classic and modern</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re equipped with a deep understanding of all the critical</p>
<p>components of running a business they&rsquo;ll know that you can talk</p>
<p>long-range plans and marketing mix that you can generate a swot analysis and</p>
<p>create proformas this is what you&rsquo;ve gained through your</p>
<p>hard work here and i suspect classes 2020 and 2021 in</p>
<p>particular you&rsquo;ve gained even more than the typical</p>
<p>cohort of high achieving haas graduates the skills and knowledge i&rsquo;ve described</p>
<p>are a long-standing tradition of haas but you know what else is a</p>
<p>long-standing tradition fun</p>
<p>in addition to being rigorous business school is supposed to be fun</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to have regular social opportunities go to strata for a cup of</p>
<p>coffee or go over to triple rock or the hotel durant</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s be honest you kind of got screwed on this front</p>
<p>after all i&rsquo;m giving a commencement speech in the middle of october to two</p>
<p>graduating classes but given the mix of classes represented</p>
<p>today i know that some of you have had an entire school year online while</p>
<p>others only a few months no matter how</p>
<p>the pandemic has impacted your time at haas it&rsquo;s impacted you</p>
<p>and none of you got the business school experience you were</p>
<p>expecting but this is why i think you will win out</p>
<p>in the end you got an excellent education</p>
<p>and a crash course in working and collaborating during a very tenuous and</p>
<p>uncertain time which likely taught you very personal and practical lessons of</p>
<p>the heart i didn&rsquo;t learn these lessons until about</p>
<p>10 years after leaving haze i graduated in the middle of the first</p>
<p>internet bubble so opportunities abounded</p>
<p>i would go on to hold senior roles at walmart.com and pete&rsquo;s coffee as the</p>
<p>dean said and today i&rsquo;m at all birds i&rsquo;ve always loved that early to high</p>
<p>growth stage a little bit of a glutton for punishment</p>
<p>and thanks to haas i have the foundational knowledge to do well and</p>
<p>deepen my expertise there yet there was</p>
<p>an aspect of business where learning in a classroom can take people only so far</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s leadership the greatest professors of leadership</p>
<p>and many teach at this very school will expose you to a range of leadership</p>
<p>philosophies they&rsquo;ll guide you through case studies of failed and successful</p>
<p>leadership and they&rsquo;ll help you decide which</p>
<p>leadership approach is right for you but if you can&rsquo;t learn in practice how</p>
<p>to lead with vulnerability and authenticity</p>
<p>your leadership knowledge will eventually prove no match for the raw</p>
<p>humanity of leading eventually every person in a leadership</p>
<p>and management role is confronted with the reality</p>
<p>that leadership without empathy and compassion</p>
<p>is really not leadership at all when i got out of haws i had not yet</p>
<p>learned this lesson it was at odds with how i was raised and</p>
<p>how i saw myself i had a black belt and putting my head</p>
<p>down and getting work done and what sent when setbacks arose and disappointments</p>
<p>came up as they inevitably do i would quickly transition my team towards</p>
<p>solution we&rsquo;d push through whatever was in our way and we would always deliver</p>
<p>but what i didn&rsquo;t do as well was to pause and check in with my team</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t create space or time from my team&rsquo;s emotional needs or mine quite</p>
<p>frankly because here&rsquo;s the thing the thing i&rsquo;m both ashamed to admit and</p>
<p>relief to state in the past tense i&rsquo;d not yet learned to even recognize my</p>
<p>own emotional needs i lived life on autopilot focusing only</p>
<p>on outcomes if i wasn&rsquo;t going to allow myself to</p>
<p>feel more difficult emotions i certainly was not going to have patience as others</p>
<p>sat in theirs strength was i was taught stealing</p>
<p>oneself from feeling any emotions in their realm of struggle or pain and</p>
<p>instead just pushing them down and plowing through</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d live my life believing in this definition of strength</p>
<p>until life forced me to wonder if i&rsquo;d been taught wrong</p>
<p>something i&rsquo;ve learned is that eventually life will try to teach all of</p>
<p>us that true strength</p>
<p>only comes through vulnerability for me this lesson came</p>
<p>through the earthquake of losing my husband my father and my mother in a</p>
<p>span of few years and when life brings hardship so</p>
<p>monumental it becomes impossible to run from our feelings</p>
<p>yet as i&rsquo;ve learned something beautiful something profound</p>
<p>something truly liberating can happen in these moments</p>
<p>they can crack our hearts open and with an open heart we approach every</p>
<p>encounter from a place of humanity vulnerability</p>
<p>fundamental respect and compassion through losses so close together i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>finally gotten the lesson in vulnerability i could no longer ignore</p>
<p>i was forced to question many aspects of my life both personally</p>
<p>and professionally and i was finally able to see that my leadership and my</p>
<p>parenting were too lopsided and too focused on output</p>
<p>i could disregard the inputs those more humane and human considerations no more</p>
<p>so i began to embrace the inherent paradoxes of life i work to find balance</p>
<p>between emotion opposing dualities like tenacity and compassion</p>
<p>confidence and humility action and self-reflection</p>
<p>and empathizing and motivating this work has been hard but the payoff incredible</p>
<p>my professional relationships have gained an invaluable mix of safety and</p>
<p>intimacy that has empowered those on my team to excel</p>
<p>beyond my wildest dreams in other words</p>
<p>i learned how to lead in real life not just on paper</p>
<p>yes i got the much more typical hearts experience replete with those foggy late</p>
<p>night nights at triple rock i got the business school toolkit that</p>
<p>comes with this exception of exceptional foundation</p>
<p>and i got a great economy when i graduated one without the strange</p>
<p>uncertainty of a pandemic but you got so much more you got twice</p>
<p>as many tools in your kit the pandemic left you no choice but to</p>
<p>confront your more difficult feelings and to verbalize them</p>
<p>with your classmates and professors you were forced to leapfrog to intimate</p>
<p>conversations early on about the stress of being a student an employee a spouse</p>
<p>or partner while homeschooling kids or about the pain of chronic isolation</p>
<p>having a struggle to retain hope and motivation when you were devoid of</p>
<p>human interaction you had no choice but to</p>
<p>navigate the various emotional states of those in your cohort</p>
<p>and still function together to complete projects and meet deadlines</p>
<p>and you manage to achieve so much in spite of these unusual circumstances</p>
<p>my friends this is school learning plus life learning</p>
<p>this is the work of leaders</p>
<p>so much about life is learning to reframe</p>
<p>our most challenging experiences to glean them for learning</p>
<p>the losses we endure offer an opportunity to sit with</p>
<p>difficult feelings to process them and come out the other side stronger for</p>
<p>having given in to the vulnerability hardship can give way to tremendous</p>
<p>personal growth to a chance to build more resilience to</p>
<p>develop humility and learn to have compassion for ourselves and others</p>
<p>i have a feeling that you will look back on this time and see it for the</p>
<p>incredible opportunity for growth that it was</p>
<p>i expect you will feel in complete awe of all that you have achieved</p>
<p>against the backdrop of a pandemic and social unrest</p>
<p>and i suspect you might even be grateful for the exact business school experience</p>
<p>you got and that experience was academic</p>
<p>learning alongside life learning the head and the heart</p>
<p>in my career the biggest derailer i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>is when people can&rsquo;t transition from being that individual rock star to the</p>
<p>generous leader who can bring out the best in others</p>
<p>for those of you who aspire to senior levels this is a must in the world we</p>
<p>inhabit today and you&rsquo;ve already come to understand</p>
<p>this you leave haas already having learned</p>
<p>truths about leadership that most of us had to wait years to encounter</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already beginning to create your own leadership style</p>
<p>one that embraces dualities that brings the heart along with the head</p>
<p>as you reignite your career after haas you do so ahead of the curve of past and</p>
<p>future graduates for what you lost in the traditional</p>
<p>business school experience you&rsquo;ve gained in in learning to bring</p>
<p>your heart and humanity to your classmates your work your colleagues and</p>
<p>most especially those you lead</p>
<p>in a moment where uncertainty continues to reign i am truly comforted knowing</p>
<p>that you all are our future leaders you&rsquo;ve demonstrated incredible</p>
<p>resilience and have shown grace in the hardest moments</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that you have fully embraced haw&rsquo;s four core leadership principles</p>
<p>congratulations classes of 2020 and 2021 i wish you all the best and remember</p>
<p>every setback every tragedy every heartbreak leaves</p>
<p>its gifts so long as you are willing to find and</p>
<p>embrace them please hold this truth close as you set</p>
<p>out to do great things thank you</p>

<p>to this day cat</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>i just want to take a moment to drink this in so</p>
<p>we finally made it we did it we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m grateful to be here with the class of 2020</p>
<p>and the class of 2021 congratulations to you all</p>
<p>way back when during our first semester we took micro</p>
<p>economics many of us had professor max offimer</p>
<p>who at the end of the course gave us a list of key takeaways</p>
<p>these were the things he wanted us to remember years later if everything else</p>
<p>became a hazy memory as he put it this one page list included things like</p>
<p>opportunity costs where you should always weigh a choice you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>against what it is you&rsquo;re giving up and how sunk costs don&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>at the bottom of the page he wrote a final note in italics</p>
<p>economic efficiency is not the only thing that matters</p>
<p>economics is a set of tools not a set of values</p>
<p>economics gives you tools to accomplish your goals in an efficient way</p>
<p>use the tools to serve your goals and values</p>
<p>so we had just spent all this time learning about arbitrage</p>
<p>and how to anticipate our rivals responses</p>
<p>and our professors last words to us were about serving our</p>
<p>values too often we feel that we work for a social impact organization or that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t that we either work for a non-profit or</p>
<p>for a benefit corporation or we&rsquo;re just off the hook from social</p>
<p>impact but no matter where we work we can</p>
<p>always lead with our values we always have that choice</p>
<p>later in the program many of us took negotiations</p>
<p>with professor holly shroff she shared a slide early in the course</p>
<p>on negotiation myths these included the myth that negotiation</p>
<p>always involves a winner and a loser also that negotiation solves conflict</p>
<p>she would say that negotiation oh that negotiation solves conflict not that it</p>
<p>involves conflict she&rsquo;d also say that experience is a good</p>
<p>teacher is a myth of negotiation it turns out experience is only a good</p>
<p>teacher if you get feedback the number one negotiation miss she</p>
<p>called out is this the myth that there must be a winner and</p>
<p>a loser instead she taught us how to find shared</p>
<p>value in a negotiation</p>
<p>to focus on value creation essentially if you feel you&rsquo;ve lost in a</p>
<p>negotiation with me then we&rsquo;ve both lost in a best case scenario it&rsquo;s a both and</p>
<p>situation not an either or</p>
<p>we stop arguing over how we&rsquo;ll split a tiny pie and we go out and find a bigger</p>
<p>pie expand the pie she would say</p>
<p>the last experience i want to speak to is one we&rsquo;ve shared that&rsquo;s a little less</p>
<p>tangible we experienced it at football games</p>
<p>and during orientation skits and at parties together</p>
<p>on trips and at raleigh&rsquo;s and during our mid-program academic retreat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called collective effervescence and it&rsquo;s been missing from our lives for</p>
<p>the past couple of years it&rsquo;s that feeling in those moments when</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re with a group of people and we know in our bones that we&rsquo;re part of</p>
<p>something bigger like when we&rsquo;re dancing together and a</p>
<p>bollywood song comes on and all of a sudden we&rsquo;re part of this glowing circle</p>
<p>of people spinning and twirling and clapping</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that magic feeling adam grant wrote about collective</p>
<p>effervescence earlier this year he said you can feel depressed and anxious alone</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s rare to laugh alone or to love alone</p>
<p>joy shared is joy sustained can take the joy that we&rsquo;ve shared here</p>
<p>at haas and use it to propel us forward our collective effervescence is more</p>
<p>powerful than any roadblock will hit in business or in life</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hold fast to our individual goals and values</p>
<p>but also to the value that we create together</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>thank you so much kat i love that collective ever</p>
<p>effervescence i have to practice that um we need more of that clearly i need to</p>
<p>practice more of it um thank you um and now we turn to the evening and</p>

<p>mba program studying remotely working remotely taking meetings by zoom</p>

<p>kate hughes</p>
<p>kate was chosen to be the student speaker by her classmates because she</p>
<p>reflects the energy the enthusiasm and the leadership of this class</p>
<p>kate [Applause]</p>
<p>all right it&rsquo;s good to see everyone in person</p>
<p>you know half your face at least we made it we have spent the last three</p>
<p>years building our brands as house leaders</p>
<p>as we began our program we branded ourselves axosky blue and gold</p>
<p>evening or weekend poet or quant we were explorers pivoters or advancers</p>
<p>molding ourselves to become the next generation of impactful leaders</p>
<p>all powered by grit a lot of coffee or in my case a lot of</p>
<p>wine and those delicious chocolate covered</p>
<p>almonds from the program office when mark would let us have them</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve lived by a set of defining haas</p>
<p>principles that are unique to this group we&rsquo;ve embodied confidence without</p>
<p>attitude we&rsquo;ve questioned the status quo</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been students always and we&rsquo;ve gone beyond ourselves</p>
<p>all while pushing one another to grow in our own leadership identities</p>
<p>we begin this journey each carrying a unique set of brands and labels</p>
<p>influenced by our gender our ethnicity our families</p>
<p>and our lived experiences these brands make up our identities</p>
<p>the core of who we are as individuals who will be in the future and how we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell our story to the world and while we arrived here a very diverse</p>
<p>group we leave here today with one identity</p>
<p>that we now all share we are haas graduates</p>
<p>we are mbas</p>
<p>many of you guys know me as someone who&rsquo;s been very hyper involved in this</p>
<p>program as my parents would probably say probably to my own insanity</p>
<p>uh but i don&rsquo;t think a lot of people know that i never really thought i would</p>
<p>be here to begin with i didn&rsquo;t come from you know an ivy</p>
<p>league education i spent five and a half years trying to</p>
<p>finish undergrad and community college and state college</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t work for apple or google or you know one of the big four i worked for a</p>
<p>small firm that no one had ever heard of and don&rsquo;t even get me started on how</p>
<p>awful i did on the quant section of the gmat</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t all of the things that i thought a top 10 nba candidate should be</p>
<p>so when by some miracle i ended up here thanks to whoever in the admissions team</p>
<p>thought that was a good idea uh i i definitely had like the little fish and</p>
<p>the big pond syndrome going but what i&rsquo;ve come to find is that haas</p>
<p>leaders share a brand that is completely our own</p>
<p>in fact i asked a lot of our students when i was writing this speech if they</p>
<p>could describe a host leader in one word and i heard over and over again</p>
<p>compassionate grounded</p>
<p>empathetic genuine</p>
<p>selfless and humble and those aren&rsquo;t usually the first words</p>
<p>that someone uses when you think about a leader or you try and describe it in one</p>
<p>word but they show just what makes the identity of a haas mba so distinctive</p>
<p>we focused our higher education on tapping into both the heart and the mind</p>
<p>of the leader we&rsquo;ve been allowed to embrace the idea</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just what we do that will determine how we&rsquo;re remembered</p>
<p>but how we make people feel we&rsquo;ve been pushed to lead with</p>
<p>authenticity harnessing our unique experiences and world views to foster a</p>
<p>different way of creative thinking</p>
<p>and we form these leadership identities under one of the craziest times ever and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re emerging today more resilient empathetic and inspired than we&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>been before and now we have an opportunity to</p>
<p>leverage the privilege that is this mba to make a profound impact on the future</p>
<p>of those around us in this moment right here at graduation</p>
<p>today we have an opportunity to choose the brand of leader that we want to be</p>
<p>moving forward leaders who are compassionate</p>
<p>authentic and empowering one of my mentors told me recently that</p>
<p>you are more than you can even imagine and you can overcome anything</p>
<p>as we step into this new chapter of our lives today</p>
<p>i challenge you to become more than you can even imagine</p>
<p>i challenge you to embrace everything we&rsquo;ve learned here at haas to create a</p>
<p>new brand of leader one who can make a profound positive</p>
<p>impact at a time in our country and our planet needed the most</p>
<p>now this wouldn&rsquo;t be an mba graduation if i didn&rsquo;t end my speech with some</p>
<p>famous ceo quote so i&rsquo;ll leave you with uh jeff bezos said</p>
<p>that your brand is what people say when you leave the room so as we leave this</p>
<p>room today let&rsquo;s make sure that people say phenomenal things</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>thank you so much kate i think we should take a moment to applaud one more time</p>
<p>all our speakers [Applause]</p>
<p>so the moment that you have all been waiting for has arrived</p>
<p>we will now recognize the evening and weekend program candidates for the</p>
<p>classes of 2020 and 2021 for the degree</p>
