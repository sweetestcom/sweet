    <p>Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody, we have an exciting show for you</p>
<p>today. This is the 15th and the final episode from the all in</p>
<p>summit 2022. I wanted to take a quick moment to thank my team.</p>
<p>They worked tirelessly over 100 days to make the event magical</p>
<p>for everybody who was able to make it. Thanks to the audience</p>
<p>for coming. Next year, we&rsquo;ll try to have twice as many of you</p>
<p>there. Just a quick thank you to Amber, Ashley, Jackie, Nick,</p>
<p>fresh marine Molly, Big Mike, Andre times to Rachel reporting</p>
<p>producer, Justin, Jamie, Jimmy, Dave, my brother, Josh,</p>
<p>everybody who came and supported the event. We had an incredible</p>
<p>crew, we had an incredible time. And of course, I would be</p>
<p>remiss if I didn&rsquo;t thank the amazing speakers who joined us</p>
<p>from all around the world. So candid, so insightful. My pal</p>
<p>Bill Gurley, Brett Gerstner, Adina, Mark, Candace, Tim, Elon,</p>
<p>Antonio, Nate, Ryan, Claire, my boy, boy, Antonio Garcia,</p>
<p>Martinez, Joe Lonsdale, James, Matt, IEB, Glenn Greenwald, and</p>
<p>of course, today&rsquo;s guest, the one and the only Mr. Palmer</p>
<p>lucky. And most of all, I&rsquo;d like to thank my besties to mount</p>
<p>sacks and freeberg who did an amazing job of hosting the</p>
<p>event. Now, a little preamble here before we start this</p>
<p>episode. Many of you have heard that this is a controversial</p>
<p>episode. It is a little controversial, there may be a</p>
<p>little twist in it. So I will be coming back after Palmer Lucky&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk to give you a little context because it might get a</p>
<p>little confusing. I don&rsquo;t want to spoil the surprise for you. So</p>
<p>enjoy this episode. But before we go to this episode, a lot of</p>
<p>you have questions. You have questions about the future of</p>
<p>the all in podcast. And those questions are important. And</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re never going to be answered. They&rsquo;re never going to</p>
<p>be answered. But just so you know, I&rsquo;m not leaving. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>leaving. I&rsquo;m not leaving.</p>
<p>The show goes on. This is my home. They&rsquo;re gonna need a</p>
<p>wrecking ball to take me out of here. They&rsquo;re gonna need to send</p>
<p>in the National Guard because I ain&rsquo;t going nowhere. The show</p>
<p>goes on.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Brain man David.</p>
<p>So my name is Palmer Lucky. I&rsquo;ve founded two companies. My first</p>
<p>was a company called Oculus VR that I founded when I was 19</p>
<p>years old and living in a camper trailer. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Sold that to for a few billion dollars to Facebook and then got</p>
<p>fired a few years later and then started Andrew because I wanted</p>
<p>to work in the national security space for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll get into some of those reasons today. So the technology</p>
<p>industry for many years has prided itself on being the first</p>
<p>to understand where things are heading so that they can build</p>
<p>the things that are going to be relevant for the future. On</p>
<p>national security, though, and on the rise of our strategic</p>
<p>adversaries, it was one of the last industries to realize where</p>
<p>things were going due to a variety of ideological reasons,</p>
<p>but also business reasons. That&rsquo;s still Silicon Valley</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t just predict the importance of defense in the</p>
<p>2020s. It largely took the exact wrong position, the opposite</p>
<p>position. First of all, you have the obvious examples like big</p>
<p>technology companies explicitly refusing to do work with the</p>
<p>Department of Defense. Google is one big example. But the worst</p>
<p>examples are really in the startups that don&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>because people didn&rsquo;t want to even get into such a</p>
<p>controversial space, lest it ruin their careers. You know,</p>
<p>when I started Anduril, I had already sold a company for</p>
<p>billions of dollars and investors still didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>invest. I still had a tough time in a lot of meetings with</p>
<p>venture capitalists. And none of the conversations with VCs that</p>
<p>I had were about my ability to hire or execute or build</p>
<p>products. Everyone believed that I could do those things, even</p>
<p>the ones who didn&rsquo;t like me much. The vast majority of</p>
<p>conversations that we had were about whether or not it was even</p>
<p>ethically okay to ever build a company that would build weapons.</p>
<p>And the people who turned us down, the ones who decided not</p>
<p>to invest in Anduril, actually believed that we had a good team</p>
<p>and good people and good product market fit. The issue is that</p>
<p>they thought that it was inherently wrong to build tools</p>
<p>capable of being used for violence because they believed</p>
<p>that the idea of deterring violence through having a strong</p>
<p>arsenal was fundamentally obsolete and itself wrong. Even,</p>
<p>you know, imagine how hard it would have been to raise money</p>
<p>if I hadn&rsquo;t founded Oculus. It would have been impossible. Even</p>
<p>after we raised money and got traction, the negativity</p>
<p>continued. There was a really interesting cover story in</p>
<p>Bloomberg in 2019 that called us tech&rsquo;s most controversial</p>
<p>startup. This was a year where TikTok was banning users for</p>
<p>calling attention to the Uyghur genocide in China and banning</p>
<p>users for posting homosexual content. This is a year in which</p>
<p>Adam Neumann paid himself tens of millions of dollars for the</p>
<p>right to use the word we. It&rsquo;s a year that Uber was under a</p>
<p>federal investigation for its workplace culture immediately</p>
<p>after a board coup that ejected much of the leadership. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>time where Facebook was getting hauled in front of Congress to</p>
<p>testify. But of course, as a tiny defense company making a</p>
<p>handful of purely defensive base security systems that committed</p>
<p>the crime of building technology for the military, Anduril was</p>
<p>the one that claimed the belt for the world&rsquo;s most</p>
<p>controversial technology company. I&rsquo;d say that the war in</p>
<p>Europe has totally shattered the idea that we live at the end</p>
<p>of history. Every few decades, we start to believe that</p>
<p>economic ties have ended all prospect of war, and every few</p>
<p>decades, we&rsquo;re reminded that this isn&rsquo;t true. That&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>popular idea, especially in D.C., that we live at what they</p>
<p>call the end of history. It&rsquo;s this idea that economic ties and</p>
<p>interconnections make the prospect of conflict</p>
<p>fundamentally unthinkable, ignoring the fact that many</p>
<p>people see this as a matter of destiny, not economics. In 1909,</p>
<p>English economist and politician Norman Angell published an</p>
<p>entire book called The Great Illusion, and it was entirely</p>
<p>about how war in Europe was impossible, and that spending</p>
<p>money on building militaries that could deter conflict was a</p>
<p>waste of time that could be better spent building utopia. He</p>
<p>specifically argued that any European country annexing</p>
<p>another would be as absurd as London annexing Hertford, and</p>
<p>the book was actually the number one bestseller in 1909. Now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had some version of this argument for a few decades now,</p>
<p>ever since the Cold War started, and luckily, a lot of people are</p>
<p>waking up. But unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;ve come to</p>
<p>a reasoned decision based on the fundamental principles at play.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because right now, supporting the military,</p>
<p>supporting defense, and supporting Ukraine in particular,</p>
<p>has become the current thing. And in current year, current</p>
<p>thing is the thing that you have to support, regardless of what</p>
<p>you think of the underpinnings. Unfortunately, for issues like</p>
<p>defense and national security, the stakes are too high, and the</p>
<p>relevant timeline is far too long for people to start caring</p>
<p>about things at the moment that they need to start caring about</p>
<p>them. So today, I want to talk a little bit about why I started</p>
<p>Androal, and why you should all think exactly the same way that</p>
<p>I do. So why I founded Androal. I thought that I would work on</p>
<p>virtual reality for my entire life. I had no plans on leaving</p>
<p>Oculus at all, and I love virtual reality. I loved virtual</p>
<p>reality. I started Oculus as a teenager, and I would have been</p>
<p>there for another 50 years. I said as much less than 30 days</p>
<p>before I was fired. There&rsquo;s a lot of reasons for that, some of</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll get into later. But the decision was made for me. I</p>
<p>gave $9,000 against the wrong political candidate, and it was</p>
<p>pretty unpopular in Silicon Valley. Before I worked on</p>
<p>Oculus, I actually worked in an army affiliate research center</p>
<p>on a program called Brave Mind, which was an army project to</p>
<p>treat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder</p>
<p>using virtual reality exposure therapy, basically putting them</p>
<p>into virtual reality environments that would set off</p>
<p>their symptoms, and then under the guidance of a licensed</p>
<p>therapist who was also in the simulation, they could be taught</p>
<p>coping skills that would reduce their dependency on medication</p>
<p>and medical aid. It was a really fantastic program. I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>doing anything important on it. I was just a lab technician, a</p>
<p>cable monkey. But I got a lot of exposure to both the virtual</p>
<p>reality technology side, but also how broken defense</p>
<p>procurement was, how slow it was, how old a lot of the</p>
<p>technology was, how the incentives were totally</p>
<p>misaligned. And ever since then, I&rsquo;d always wanted to make a</p>
<p>contribution to national security, if I could. Just took</p>
<p>a few years for the right set of circumstances to come up. The</p>
<p>defense industry in America is fundamentally broken. Before</p>
<p>even getting into the specific problems of our defense</p>
<p>industry, the United States has the strongest commercial</p>
<p>artificial intelligence industry in the world, followed closely</p>
<p>by China. But at the same time, the United States military and</p>
<p>the prime contractors that dominate the military industrial</p>
<p>complex have none of the right tools, talent, or incentives to</p>
<p>apply autonomy to the systems they do. There&rsquo;s no reason to</p>
<p>save costs because they don&rsquo;t get paid for making things that</p>
<p>work. They get paid for doing work. And in a world where you</p>
<p>get more prestige and more money by having more people working</p>
<p>on bigger things, there&rsquo;s no reason to use autonomy to reduce</p>
<p>costs and increase capability. The U.S. military is well behind</p>
<p>the Chinese People&rsquo;s Liberation Army in the implementation of</p>
<p>artificial intelligence. There&rsquo;s better AI in John Deere</p>
<p>tractors than there is in any U.S. military vehicle. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better computer vision in the Snapchat app on your phone than</p>
<p>any system that the U.S. Department of Defense has</p>
<p>deployed. And other countries are taking notice of this.</p>
<p>Countries like Russia and China do not want to compete with us</p>
<p>toe-to-toe with the tools that we have. People will make fun of</p>
<p>China and say, oh, they don&rsquo;t have a blue water navy. They</p>
<p>only have one aircraft carrier coming up on two. They could</p>
<p>never fight us. The reality is that&rsquo;s not where they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to fight us. They&rsquo;re going to arm proxies or, if they engage</p>
<p>directly, they&rsquo;re going to use technologies that give them an</p>
<p>asymmetrical advantage in the areas where we are the least</p>
<p>competent. These are the areas where they are putting a lot of</p>
<p>their resources. The reason that Vladimir Putin is saying that</p>
<p>the ruler of the world is going to be the country that masters</p>
<p>artificial intelligence is not because he thinks that they are</p>
<p>going to lose at this. It&rsquo;s because he thinks that that is</p>
<p>one of the only ways that they&rsquo;re going to be able to get</p>
<p>the best of us. Now, the people who are building technology for</p>
<p>our military, the large defense primes, I won&rsquo;t name any names</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to rustle too many feathers in that area.</p>
<p>You never know who&rsquo;s in the room. But the people who are</p>
<p>building the technology for the United States military, the</p>
<p>people who spend all their time do not have access to the best</p>
<p>talent. They do not have access to the people that the</p>
<p>technology industry has largely had a monopoly on in areas like</p>
<p>autonomy, artificial intelligence, sensor fusion,</p>
<p>high-end networking. And then at the same time, the people who</p>
<p>can build good software, the ones who do work in these</p>
<p>technology companies are largely prohibited from doing so. And</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re working on something that the military</p>
<p>buys, let&rsquo;s say all the people at Apple who are working on an</p>
<p>iPhone that can be sold to the U.S. Air Force, that same iPhone</p>
<p>is also being sold to Russian intelligence. That same iPhone</p>
<p>is being sold to the Chinese Navy. Working on technologies</p>
<p>that help the United States don&rsquo;t give us a strategic or</p>
<p>competitive advantage if everyone else is getting the</p>
<p>exact same thing. The other problem to consider is that</p>
<p>asymmetric technologies like artificial intelligence are</p>
<p>almost certainly going to empower nations that we aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>thinking about today. Some of them are a little more obvious</p>
<p>like Iran. It was a close U.S. ally until the late 1970s and</p>
<p>today obviously is in a very different position. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about a dozen countries in Africa, South America and Asia</p>
<p>that were they to acquire extremely advanced artificial</p>
<p>intelligence either through coincidence or by proxy arming</p>
<p>would almost certainly start to wage war on their neighbors in</p>
<p>a very destabilizing way. It would have been a mature bet</p>
<p>for me to found a second unicorn in a different industry that</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t so fundamentally broken. Gaming, fast casual dining,</p>
<p>fintech, I could have made some ape coins, but there have</p>
<p>actually been more mattress unicorns than defense unicorns</p>
<p>in the last 35 years. But I decided the best thing that I</p>
<p>could do to try and solve this problem was to use the fact that</p>
<p>I had a bunch of money and I had a bunch of credibility to do</p>
<p>something that was hugely unpopular to ignore the fact</p>
<p>that people were belittling me for it and try to convince a</p>
<p>bunch of brilliant people to come along with me so that they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t waste their lives spending augmented reality</p>
<p>mustache emojis and instead they could do some work for our</p>
<p>armed forces. But it&rsquo;s worth looking at the past and</p>
<p>realizing that this is a recent problem. It&rsquo;s not something that</p>
<p>has been the case for a very long time. Silicon Valley was</p>
<p>largely built on the back of defense. In 1947, half of</p>
<p>Stanford&rsquo;s engineering budget came from the Department of the</p>
<p>Defense. Fred Turman, Stanford dean, brought DOD contracts and</p>
<p>interest to the West Coast in a way that had fundamentally been</p>
<p>limited almost entirely to the East Coast. And Silicon Valley</p>
<p>helped power a lot of the things that are powering the modern</p>
<p>military machine. In the 1950s alone, we built the Pentagon in</p>
<p>well, sorry, I have an error in my notes. This is wrong. In the</p>
<p>lead up to the 50s, in the early 50s, we built the Pentagon in 16</p>
<p>months. We completed the Manhattan Project in three</p>
<p>years. We put a man on the moon in under a decade. And just</p>
<p>between 1951 and 1959, we built five generations of fighter jets,</p>
<p>three generations of bombers, two classes of carriers, nuclear</p>
<p>powered submarines and ballistic missiles to go on top of them. If</p>
<p>you look at the current state of the industry, we&rsquo;re lucky to do</p>
<p>even one of these things in a decade. And I can&rsquo;t really blame</p>
<p>the defense industry for not working with the DOD entirely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just an ideological problem. It&rsquo;s also an economic</p>
<p>problem. When the Cold War ended, the government really</p>
<p>became a pretty terrible customer. The technology industry</p>
<p>drifted away. Most engineers in Silicon Valley do not remember a</p>
<p>great power conflict because they haven&rsquo;t lived in a world</p>
<p>where a great power was an existential threat to the United</p>
<p>States. And so you have a lot of people who are ideologically</p>
<p>opposed to working with the military. Now, we could spend an</p>
<p>entire talk, I only have a few minutes to talk today, we can</p>
<p>spend a whole talk talking about the ethics of defense and what</p>
<p>the reasonable critiques of the military are and how you can</p>
<p>change what you build for them in a good way. But I&rsquo;ll throw</p>
<p>out a factor that I think most people don&rsquo;t think about enough,</p>
<p>even the people who do agree on working with the military.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, who</p>
<p>look at those employees who are ideologically opposed to working</p>
<p>with the military, and they use them as a smoke screen,</p>
<p>pretending that it&rsquo;s principled opposition that drives their</p>
<p>decision when in reality, they want access to Chinese markets,</p>
<p>they want access to Chinese investment, they want access to</p>
<p>other countries that are tied into these things. And so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to use these people who are ideologically opposed to working</p>
<p>with the military, which actually make up a pretty small</p>
<p>fraction of the US population as a smoke screen for their real</p>
<p>intention, which is to preserve access to those markets preserve</p>
<p>access to those capital. Our largest companies are not making</p>
<p>these decisions based on what is best for the United States,</p>
<p>certainly not what is best for the United States in the long</p>
<p>term, they&rsquo;re largely making the decisions based on short term</p>
<p>ideas that are not based in any kind of long term thinking. If</p>
<p>you look at the recent chips bill that Congress passed saying</p>
<p>that the United States government is going to put 50</p>
<p>billion, $52 billion into building semiconductors in the</p>
<p>United States, you have to compare that with the recent</p>
<p>news that well, it leaked it wasn&rsquo;t it wasn&rsquo;t news on</p>
<p>purpose. But Apple has pledged to put $275 billion as one</p>
<p>company into Chinese manufacturing, you have one</p>
<p>company putting in more than five times as much money into</p>
<p>manufacturing advanced technology as what is supposed</p>
<p>to be a landmark piece of US legislation. The situation that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in is is pretty weird. This is gonna sound hyperbolic,</p>
<p>but bear with me. The situation we were we are in right now</p>
<p>would be like if in the build up to World War Two, General</p>
<p>Electric had said, you know what, we really like the United</p>
<p>States, but we&rsquo;re actually very bullish on Imperial Japan, we</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s going to be a huge growth opportunity for us. And</p>
<p>our metrics just aren&rsquo;t going to look the same if we wipe those</p>
<p>off of our roadmap. Imagine if in the build up to the Cold War,</p>
<p>if you had had Westinghouse and other major US technology</p>
<p>companies say, ah, you know, we love manufacturing in the United</p>
<p>States, but we actually think communist manufacturing is a</p>
<p>really interesting experiment that we need to see through. And</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re not sure that we really want to take a side on</p>
<p>this. The situation that we are in today is as dire or worse,</p>
<p>the only reason that it seems ridiculous. And the only reason</p>
<p>it seems hyperbolic is because conflict has not actually broken</p>
<p>out yet. If a conflict does break out, we&rsquo;re going to look</p>
<p>at the current situation where we are hugely strategically and</p>
<p>economically dependent at the highest levels of our technology</p>
<p>industry and government on an adversary that is literally</p>
<p>committing genocide and slaving millions of people, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to look back on ourselves and feel really stupid. Now, the</p>
<p>good news is that because of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine</p>
<p>defense is now the current thing. In the United States,</p>
<p>there is this idea that any problem can be fixed at the last</p>
<p>second with just a really incredible twist if we just come</p>
<p>up with the right thing. But there&rsquo;s a lot of problems out</p>
<p>there that cannot be solved that way. National security,</p>
<p>economic policy, environmental policy, these are things that</p>
<p>require nonpolitical bipartisan agreement on the problem</p>
<p>decades before it becomes a really big problem. Those are</p>
<p>not things that are acceptable. Current things shape rotation.</p>
<p>This is an acceptable current thing to debate whether or not</p>
<p>Will Smith was wrong to just wrong to take the slap or if</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just a representative of warrior culture. That&rsquo;s a fair</p>
<p>debate to have. The idea of the United States having a military</p>
<p>that is strong enough to deter conflict should not be in that</p>
<p>category. So why is it too late to care about defense now at</p>
<p>this exact moment in time? Why is it too late for everybody to</p>
<p>suddenly change their minds? Well, a few things. One, you go</p>
<p>to war with the tools that you have, not the tools that you</p>
<p>wish you had or the tools that you start working on when things</p>
<p>become a problem. If you look at the weapons that were given to</p>
<p>Ukraine, they were built in the 80s, 90s and 2000s, $40 billion</p>
<p>plus worth of them. And for all their differences, defense is one</p>
<p>of the few things that Republicans and Democrats alike</p>
<p>have realized transcends the partisan divide. On one level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously very bad that we don&rsquo;t have more modern weapons</p>
<p>to give to Ukraine. But on the other, it shows a level of</p>
<p>foresight and planning that we&rsquo;ve been stockpiling and</p>
<p>building these legacy weapon systems for decades, explicitly</p>
<p>for a situation like today, which has been war, war game</p>
<p>doubt to the nth degree. Imagine if the Department of Defense had</p>
<p>done nothing to prepare for war for 40 years. And then as soon</p>
<p>as war broke out, they started tweeting a lot and changed their</p>
<p>profile pictures to Ukraine flag and then started saying, you</p>
<p>know, we stand with Ukraine. The people who are actually tasked</p>
<p>with solving these problems are they generally have good</p>
<p>planning, but there&rsquo;s only so much they can do without good</p>
<p>technology. So I want to reiterate, if you only start</p>
<p>building now, you&rsquo;ve lost the chance to deter war from</p>
<p>happening. That&rsquo;s the real purpose of the defense industry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to fight wars. It&rsquo;s not to win wars. It&rsquo;s to prevent</p>
<p>wars from happening. Wars happen when one or both sides</p>
<p>misestimate their probability of winning. If both sides agree</p>
<p>that one side or the other is going to win, typically you end</p>
<p>up with diplomatic resolution. It&rsquo;s when both sides disagree</p>
<p>about the possibility of winning that conflict actually breaks</p>
<p>out. And so if you actually want to prevent conflict from</p>
<p>happening in the first place, you have to get involved well</p>
<p>ahead of time. If you get involved after conflict breaks</p>
<p>out, like so many companies have, you&rsquo;re ensuring that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only going to be a part of the killing. You&rsquo;re only going to be</p>
<p>a part of the bloodshed. You&rsquo;re only going to be a part of the</p>
<p>war. You&rsquo;re not going to be a part of preventing the war from</p>
<p>happening in the first place. So I would argue that people in</p>
<p>the technology industry need to work on defense not because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the current thing, but because it&rsquo;s the right thing. I have one</p>
<p>more thing that I want to say. Thank you.</p>
<p>I talked earlier about NPC thinking that prioritizes</p>
<p>popularity over principles. What I&rsquo;m about to do is in very, very</p>
<p>bad taste, but I&rsquo;m going to do it anyway. Yeah, we&rsquo;ll see. One</p>
<p>of the people who I think embodies this type of NPC</p>
<p>thinking of going with what&rsquo;s popular and not being willing to</p>
<p>ever reverse their position even when they&rsquo;re proven wrong is</p>
<p>Jason Calacanis. Let me read about some of the things he said</p>
<p>about me over the years. Just a small sampling. Palmer Lucky,</p>
<p>hideous. What an idiot. A moron. This guy, Parker Lucky, a</p>
<p>complete and utter moron. Jesus, this kid is an idiot. Palmer</p>
<p>Lucky is just an idiot and a troll. He is dumb. So, so, so</p>
<p>dumb. Oh, no, we got to keep going. For him to pull the plug</p>
<p>on the Palmer Lucky experience was brilliant. Kudos, Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>A complete lack of moral character and leadership. Palmer</p>
<p>Lucky, a complete moron. Palmer doesn&rsquo;t care about any of his</p>
<p>employees, family members, or team members. Now, this doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>include any of the lies that he&rsquo;s told about me. This doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>include any of the lies he&rsquo;s told about my businesses. This</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t include any of the terrible things that his co-host</p>
<p>and guests have said about me over the years that went</p>
<p>unchallenged and egged on. If I&rsquo;m a hideous, stupid person</p>
<p>with no morals who doesn&rsquo;t care about my family or my employees,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t be invited here no matter how relevant Ukraine is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had many chances to retract or apologize these</p>
<p>statements. Rather than taking any of them, he keeps telling</p>
<p>people that the reason I won&rsquo;t be on his show is because I&rsquo;m too</p>
<p>thin-skinned, because I disagree with him on some of the things</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s said about Oculus. That&rsquo;s not the case. I&rsquo;ve explicitly</p>
<p>told him why I&rsquo;ve refused to be on his show. It&rsquo;s because he and</p>
<p>his crew of bullies have been vicious liars who have attacked</p>
<p>me for years and berated me for years and spread lies about me</p>
<p>for years in a way that I&rsquo;ve been able to overcome that very</p>
<p>few entrepreneurs would have the money or the resources or the</p>
<p>credibility to do. And being nice to a few people, like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure he&rsquo;s being nice to you, does not excuse this. This isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>debatable whether it happened or not. It clearly happened. These</p>
<p>are all direct quotes from things that he&rsquo;s said over the</p>
<p>years, both while I was at Oculus and during my time after</p>
<p>Oculus. And Jason, like many influential people, some of them</p>
<p>even in this room, who have treated me like shit for years,</p>
<p>suddenly changed their tune as soon as Android was on the</p>
<p>upswing, as soon as we were doing good things. They started</p>
<p>inviting me on their podcasts, liking all my social media</p>
<p>posts, putting me on their innovator lists, all without any</p>
<p>acknowledgment whatsoever that they were the ones that were</p>
<p>attacking me when it was popular, kicking me while I was</p>
<p>on the ground, and treating me like garbage. It&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>pathetic because a lot of my remaining critics at least are</p>
<p>basing their opinions on some kind of consistent worldview. A</p>
<p>lot of other people are attacking me and the work that I</p>
<p>do because it&rsquo;s popular. When it&rsquo;s popular to attack me, they</p>
<p>attack me. When it&rsquo;s unpopular to attack me, when Ukraine is</p>
<p>being attacked, they are suddenly friends. And those are</p>
<p>the same people that I know are going to go back to shitting on</p>
<p>me the second that it becomes popular again. I&rsquo;m coming to the</p>
<p>end of this. And I know that you guys are probably thinking,</p>
<p>wow, this guy&rsquo;s pretty thin-skinned for a billionaire.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair. That&rsquo;s fair. But I want to remind you of something.</p>
<p>Jason and the people like him are the reason I was fired from</p>
<p>Oculus, my own company, the company that was my heart and my</p>
<p>soul for my entire teenage and adult life. For him it was a</p>
<p>game, it was his show, and for me it was everything and I lost</p>
<p>everything. It almost destroyed me. I&rsquo;m still filled with rage</p>
<p>about it. I always will be. I&rsquo;ll end with this. I was able to</p>
<p>create Andro because a small group of people were willing to</p>
<p>give me a second chance to let me build something great in an</p>
<p>important but controversial industry that was being</p>
<p>constantly berated by people who thought we lived at the end of</p>
<p>history. They invested in me while Jason was trying to poison</p>
<p>my career and keep me on the ground. Thank God he failed.</p>
<p>Thank God for investors who ignore him and people like him.</p>
<p>The market conditions suggest there are going to be a lot of</p>
<p>founders, hopefully none of the people in this room, losing</p>
<p>their startups over the next year or so. And I pray that they</p>
<p>get a second chance like I did. I pray they aren&rsquo;t deterred from</p>
<p>working on important but unpopular problems. I pray that</p>
<p>they will successfully claw their way back to success, that</p>
<p>they aren&rsquo;t deterred from working on things that really</p>
<p>matter.</p>
<p>I pray that they manage to do this despite the inevitably</p>
<p>stupid and hot takes. Sorry, inevitably stupid and spiteful</p>
<p>hot takes that Jason, his associates and the many people</p>
<p>like him who make money spewing bullshit are certainly going to</p>
<p>be putting out there. Amen. Thank you.</p>
<p>Join us.</p>
<p>Great to meet you in person.</p>
<p>Jason, what lessons have we learned here today?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I guess we were talking backstage and Jason&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, Oh, you know, I had to do so much to get this guy here</p>
<p>because I think he hates me. And this is before this shit</p>
<p>happened. And I was like, well, maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t talk shit</p>
<p>about people.</p>
<p>The good thing is, I was able to make it to the stage to say</p>
<p>this. Most of the people that you&rsquo;ve gone after this way will</p>
<p>never have that opportunity, because they won&rsquo;t start a</p>
<p>second unicorn. I&rsquo;m only here because I managed to claw my way</p>
<p>back. And remember, this is personal, because it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>you, it&rsquo;s you. You&rsquo;re one of the most influential, certainly.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s you and really a small cadre of people that by</p>
<p>attacking me ceaselessly made it impossible for me to continue my</p>
<p>tenure at Oculus. I&rsquo;m really lucky I clawed my way back</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s exceedingly rare for a company to do the person</p>
<p>to do that.</p>
<p>I was hoping to talk about your new thing. But I guess since we</p>
<p>have no choice but go here. Well, what happened at Facebook?</p>
<p>And maybe you should explain that and what I got wrong about</p>
<p>what happened?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not just what&rsquo;s wrong. This is actually why I</p>
<p>went out of my way. There&rsquo;s actually a lot of lies you told</p>
<p>in spread, and your co host and your guests. But I&rsquo;m not even</p>
<p>talking about those. The things that I listed, you&rsquo;ll notice</p>
<p>these aren&rsquo;t material accusations. These are just</p>
<p>personal attacks you&rsquo;ve made on my character. These are just</p>
<p>the things you&rsquo;ve said about me personally as a founder and</p>
<p>entrepreneur, vicious personal attacks. Separately, there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>of the lies that you&rsquo;ve said about how Oculus didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>differentiated technology. It was totally commoditized.</p>
<p>Anybody could have done it. It really was just right thing at</p>
<p>the right time. We could spend all day talking about why these</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t true. But the real reason that it became untenable for me</p>
<p>and the real reason that I&rsquo;m not in the VR industry is because</p>
<p>people like you were enabling those lies and then being</p>
<p>vicious about it and attacking me personally, it became clear I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t be a representative in an industry where people are</p>
<p>going to treat me like that fairly or not imagine doing a</p>
<p>podcast with them. What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>I guess if you have no choice but to keep I&rsquo;ll just ask you</p>
<p>the same question. Do you want us to just describe what Palmer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talking about? Can I can I try my best?</p>
<p>What? What? Well, because my memory of the events, you just</p>
<p>read all the things you said.</p>
<p>Right. But what is the what were we talking about at the time?</p>
<p>Well, there was a lot of controversy at Facebook about</p>
<p>some donations, anonymous accounts, things you said.</p>
<p>Well, so those that wasn&rsquo;t one thing that was over the course</p>
<p>of years. So that was just a small sampling. I had to really</p>
<p>find a small sample. You know, you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t do it. But</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what basically fired from Facebook. What was</p>
<p>the controversy there? Because that&rsquo;s what I was commenting on</p>
<p>in this.</p>
<p>Well, no, some of those were after I was fired. And you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying it was great that I was fired. And actually, by the way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one of your one of your co hosts said on your show</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re glad I got fired for my politics. And that line</p>
<p>is mysteriously missing from your transcripts, by the way.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s never we don&rsquo;t edit any of the things and I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a co host at the time. It&rsquo;s probably just one of the news</p>
<p>reporters who came on we would have interviewed them. But there</p>
<p>was a lot of controversy on there.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what happened. I gave $9,000 to a group that ran a</p>
<p>single anti Hillary Clinton billboard. That was actually the</p>
<p>extent of it. And then a huge number of people in the tech</p>
<p>influencer space, the social media talking heads and media,</p>
<p>they started saying Palmer lucky is this terrible person who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funding all you</p>
<p>sorry, just to be clear. So you made a donation and it was on an</p>
<p>FTC filing somewhere. Somebody pulled it out and then basically</p>
<p>said like to a pack or something.</p>
<p>It was so it was to it was to a 501 c four, I believe who used</p>
<p>that for their political harm. So but it was it was public.</p>
<p>This was it wasn&rsquo;t a filing. Yeah, yeah. And so and I actually</p>
<p>ended up giving a quote to a reporter about it. So that you</p>
<p>know, it wasn&rsquo;t it wasn&rsquo;t. It wasn&rsquo;t something that people</p>
<p>understood what it was, right. But then a bunch of people just</p>
<p>lied. They said Palmer lucky was funding people who are attacking</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton supporters online. There were a lot of</p>
<p>people who I think were looking for a scapegoat to kind of be</p>
<p>the right wing, the right wing reaction to correct the record,</p>
<p>which actually was paying people to attack. Why did why did Zuck</p>
<p>fire you? What&rsquo;s that? Why did Zuck fire? Oh, no, Zuck didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fire me. He&rsquo;s way why did face fate? Why did I&rsquo;ll just ask the</p>
<p>third time? Why did Facebook fire you?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>I always had good performance reviews. But what</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what it what it really boiled down to was this my</p>
<p>favorite talk by far.</p>
<p>What it really boils down to is this. It was clear that there</p>
<p>were a lot of people in the media and in the tech industry</p>
<p>who were going to continue attacking me. We hoped it would</p>
<p>blow over. But they kept attacking me for months and</p>
<p>months and months and months. I was put on leave for six months.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, this is all on the heels of this one political</p>
<p>donation. Correct. $9,000. Yes.</p>
<p>And so on the heels of that, the hope was that it would go away.</p>
<p>Now, I think here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the real problem. I think if Trump</p>
<p>had lost, people could have said, Oh, well, you know, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just one of those eccentrics. Impact, no impact. He&rsquo;s a loser.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a loser, but whatever. Trump winning is I think what</p>
<p>made it so you&rsquo;re because people continued to attack me not for</p>
<p>the $9,000. The $9,000 donation was the reason you were fired</p>
<p>just for just for supporting Trump.</p>
<p>As you know, these things are very complex, but more or less.</p>
<p>Yes. I mean, there&rsquo;s a direct causal line from that to me</p>
<p>being put on leave to me not being allowed to come back and</p>
<p>then pushed out.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about this on the pod on mob behavior. And I</p>
<p>think Mark Andreessen said the smartest thing I&rsquo;ve read on</p>
<p>Twitter in the year I retweeted it and I took away and I think</p>
<p>he pointed out that it&rsquo;s it feels safer to be in the mob</p>
<p>than to not be in the mob.</p>
<p>Well, it always is.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re in the mob, you&rsquo;re part of the group. But</p>
<p>you also get to attack and it&rsquo;s safe to attack when you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the group.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think, by the way, what you did there, one of the things</p>
<p>I will highlight, irregardless of the content and the thing</p>
<p>that was very brave, and we don&rsquo;t see a lot of bravery</p>
<p>nowadays.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean that. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t mean that to disparage</p>
<p>Jason. But like, that sort of behavior where you stand up and</p>
<p>you say something that will be highly controversial and go</p>
<p>against the mob and against the tide and maybe piss off an</p>
<p>entire room is something that we don&rsquo;t see a lot of. And I</p>
<p>think that that level of bravery is also what&rsquo;s missing going</p>
<p>back to the mid 20th century, which allowed us to do all the</p>
<p>things you highlighted as a country last century that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not doing anymore. I appreciate your bravery more than anything.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>But, but look, I don&rsquo;t know about the specifics with with</p>
<p>J Cal, but it certainly seems that there&rsquo;s a lot of this we</p>
<p>talked about this, like with with Brian Armstrong standing up</p>
<p>at Coinbase, and all the stuff that&rsquo;s gone on that we think I</p>
<p>would argue is probably made Twitter a highly complacent</p>
<p>place is everyone wants to be, you know, you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>stand up and you don&rsquo;t want to make that change. And you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be brave. And you want to be part of the mob of the of</p>
<p>the crowd attacking the right people see what happens. I mean,</p>
<p>what happened to me has like this is this is I can&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>back this up. Obviously, this is getting into personal anecdote,</p>
<p>which is never a good way to support any idea. But, you know,</p>
<p>I know a lot of people who remain at Facebook, and they</p>
<p>will not say anything. And they will not donate to any</p>
<p>politician. Yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy, who&rsquo;s left of Bernie, because</p>
<p>they saw what happened to me. And they&rsquo;ve explicitly said, I</p>
<p>saw what happened to you. Because remember, it wasn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>the public. It was the internal reaction, where people were</p>
<p>saying, Oh, my God, like, I will not work for a Trump supporter.</p>
<p>This is terrible. I mean, actually, one great example,</p>
<p>Andrew Bosworth. He ran ads at Facebook for 14 years, he was</p>
<p>put in after my departure as the head of Oculus. And he was the</p>
<p>guy who was putting things on social media. Like, I think the</p>
<p>exact wording was, if you support Donald Trump, because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like Hillary Clinton, you are a shitty human being.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the person who&rsquo;s allowed to lead Oculus now. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not a problem of being aggressive on the right side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being on the right side of politics. And so there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of people where they&rsquo;re just they&rsquo;re not going to say</p>
<p>anything, because they see what happens to me. Now, I&rsquo;ve sex is</p>
<p>loving this.</p>
<p>When I hear somebody to disagree with, I&rsquo;ll let you guys know.</p>
<p>The real irony here is, my contributions have been very</p>
<p>open. But my advice to founders who are on the right has</p>
<p>actually been, don&rsquo;t be public about your political leanings,</p>
<p>because you won&rsquo;t accomplish anything, you will just you will</p>
<p>be terminated by the mob, you should focus on building, you</p>
<p>should focus on creating value. And then after you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>the rest of the industry, you can kick them to the curb and do</p>
<p>something. How do you how do you implement that philosophy</p>
<p>differently now, at Andrew so that you have a more inclusive</p>
<p>place where folks on the left and folks on the right come</p>
<p>together work on things that really matter. I mean, I think</p>
<p>everybody agrees, you&rsquo;re building really important things</p>
<p>in the world. So how do you do that this time around? That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different from the Facebook experience.</p>
<p>So a few things. One, I think that building working in</p>
<p>national security has been a great filter where people</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t going to come work for you unless they&rsquo;re okay working</p>
<p>in a bit of a controversial field. I&rsquo;m actually somewhat</p>
<p>concerned about the Ukraine conflict in that regard, in</p>
<p>that in the making, in making defense mainstream, it makes it</p>
<p>possible for people to potentially say, oh, that isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>controversial. Now I&rsquo;m going to go to this place. And then I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to potentially attack people with their views. But I</p>
<p>think when you run a company that is inherently working on</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s controversial, people on the right and on the</p>
<p>left, both feel like they&rsquo;re on the side of this important</p>
<p>bipartisan issue. And all of these other policy differences</p>
<p>can kind of go to the side and the culture at Andoril is</p>
<p>everyone is free to have whatever politics they want.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m a Republican, our CEO, Brian Schimpf is a Democrat, we</p>
<p>both make significant contributions to our respective</p>
<p>sizes, and we have employees.</p>
<p>And I think also, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s nipping it in the bud. You know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about when somebody says something that is out of line,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about getting it early and say, hey, that&rsquo;s not okay at</p>
<p>this company. We&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re here to work on a common mission. For</p>
<p>example, if we had a manager who then publicly went and said,</p>
<p>the half of my employees who support this political candidate,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re terrible people. They&rsquo;re shitty humans. They&rsquo;d be fired.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. I&rsquo;ll give you a counterfactual to what this is,</p>
<p>which is very aspirational, which is seven or eight years</p>
<p>ago, we funded a business that actually makes seafaring drones.</p>
<p>And the whole point was to actually measure the surface</p>
<p>flux in the oceans, which you can use to get a really good</p>
<p>sense of climate change. And somewhere along the way, we had</p>
<p>the chance to do a contract with the DoD. But invariably,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a faction of folks inside this company that said,</p>
<p>under no circumstances, are we going to put our efforts towards</p>
<p>that. And as a result, then the company spent a three year</p>
<p>detour, trying to build a weather app, which turned out to</p>
<p>not be the right thing. And three years later, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing a bunch of stuff now with these government</p>
<p>agencies. And it turns out that&rsquo;s the right thing to do,</p>
<p>because now they&rsquo;re that much closer to actually mapping the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s oceans, which creates a repository of data. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all these positive knock on effects that sometimes folks</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see. And you need strong leadership to kind of say, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what Elon said yesterday, you know, companies are there to</p>
<p>make products that people and organizations want to need, not</p>
<p>necessarily to fight over political ideals.</p>
<p>I think one of the interesting things, the example you just</p>
<p>gave, like I mentioned earlier, I have some empathy for people</p>
<p>who work in companies who don&rsquo;t want to work in defense, like, I</p>
<p>think broadly, the technology industry needs to support the</p>
<p>military. And I&rsquo;m glad that the conflict in Ukraine has changed</p>
<p>at least the thinking around that. But at the individual</p>
<p>level, people should have the right to choose to work on what</p>
<p>they think is important. And so the Google example was</p>
<p>interesting, because it was Google employees saying, hey, I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t sign up to work on weapons. And I can understand</p>
<p>that maybe they&rsquo;re pacifist. And they say, you know, for</p>
<p>religious reasons, for philosophical reasons, I cannot</p>
<p>work on this. And they were upset that their work was put to</p>
<p>work on defense without it being clear. And I suspect that when</p>
<p>the situation you&rsquo;re talking about, it&rsquo;s similar objections</p>
<p>were raised, hey, this isn&rsquo;t what I joined the company to do</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t what I signed up for. And so at Andro, one of the</p>
<p>ways that we&rsquo;ve been able to get around this is being very clear,</p>
<p>like you are signing up to work with the Department of Defense,</p>
<p>that is that is the mission that you&rsquo;re signing up for. And I</p>
<p>mean, we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re about a third US service veterans at Andro,</p>
<p>which is higher than any company that I&rsquo;m aware of. And we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about 1000 people now. And so these are people who they</p>
<p>understand the importance of the mission, right?</p>
<p>Just shifting gears for a second, I want to ask you about</p>
<p>drone. First, let me just say that the first time I tried VR,</p>
<p>which was Oculus, I thought it was one of the most magical</p>
<p>computing experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had. So I don&rsquo;t have you guys</p>
<p>tried it, you put the goggles on. I did the thing you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the Oculus trailer. And it&rsquo;s like, it was amazing. I did the</p>
<p>thing where you show like a big hole, like Facebook had this</p>
<p>demo for a while or whatever. And I thought I was going to</p>
<p>fall into the hole. I fell forward.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on the ledge of the cliff.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to like tiptoe beyond it. I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>wait, I know this is not real. But</p>
<p>anyway, VR VR is that it&rsquo;s so funny. These are I feel these</p>
<p>mental circuits that haven&rsquo;t activated for years activating.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got my talking points. But yeah, VR is the final</p>
<p>computing platform. It&rsquo;s not the next one. It&rsquo;s the final one.</p>
<p>And people talk about augmented reality. And it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>interesting. I love AR, we did a lot of great AR foundational</p>
<p>work. But at the end of the day, if you can make a tool that</p>
<p>allows you to experience anything, and in any way that</p>
<p>can emulate every other medium, it is going to be the whole</p>
<p>parker like caught on.</p>
<p>But yeah, no, no question. Go ahead. Yeah, I was gonna actually</p>
<p>ask about drones.</p>
<p>Well, maybe we should ask why isn&rsquo;t it caught on? Yeah, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not good enough yet. People ask. I&rsquo;ll have this debate with</p>
<p>people like, Oh, I&rsquo;m not sure VR is ever really going to be a</p>
<p>thing. But explain the dimension when you say it&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>enough. Okay, is it wait? Is it physical interface? It&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>bunch of latency, it&rsquo;s content being available, you need a</p>
<p>self sustaining ecosystem of a broad enough variety of content</p>
<p>that enough people can use it to create further network effects.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s part of it. It&rsquo;s just a content thing. You have to</p>
<p>build a self sustaining flywheel until you have that. Yeah, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not good enough yet to draw people in. They&rsquo;re not good</p>
<p>enough. And they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t have broad enough appeal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a particular niche where we have a flywheel. Like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a dozens of developers that are making many millions of dollars</p>
<p>making games for Quest two, but that&rsquo;s its own little niche. The</p>
<p>other thing is quality, its weight and its cost. Like the</p>
<p>example that I like to use when arguing with people who say that</p>
<p>VR is not going to be a thing that they spend their whole life</p>
<p>in. So okay, wait, imagine this. What if for $99 you compare it</p>
<p>by a pair of sunglasses, and it gives you an experience, the</p>
<p>quality of the matrix or sort of line or whatever your sci fi</p>
<p>pick is. And you can do anything and there&rsquo;s endless content will</p>
<p>get there. And it&rsquo;s people like, Oh, well, of course I would use</p>
<p>that. Right. But but but but that&rsquo;s not what VR is. Well,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s just a tech disagreement. philosophically</p>
<p>agree. So how fast we&rsquo;ll get there. So I mean, listen, you</p>
<p>created the category half far away, are we? It depends on the</p>
<p>experience. So the hardest things to simulate are going to</p>
<p>be the ones that are kind of like these multi haptic multi</p>
<p>element things that rely on scent and motion, like surfing</p>
<p>is going to be really, really hard. On the other hand, being</p>
<p>able to perfectly simulate the experience of being in a</p>
<p>brightly lit for a fluorescent fluorescent conference room,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to happen within 10 years, like the resolution will</p>
<p>be there, the weight will be there, you will be able to</p>
<p>perfectly simulate that experience. And you know how</p>
<p>much of my life I&rsquo;ve spent flying to the other side of the</p>
<p>world to sit in fluorescent lit conference rooms, and then</p>
<p>flying back, if I can just eliminate that part of my life,</p>
<p>totally, it&rsquo;s way better for me. But it&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s gonna start</p>
<p>by simulating that experience where it&rsquo;s low dynamic range,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need haptic, and then it&rsquo;s gonna go from there.</p>
<p>Wait, it&rsquo;s actually gonna talk about drones.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s just shift gears for a second to drones. So</p>
<p>obviously, in Ukraine, right now, the, the Russian military,</p>
<p>specifically their armors has been pulverized by the</p>
<p>combination of the javelin, plus this Turkish drone, this, I</p>
<p>guess, by rocker. Yeah. So I guess this has raised the</p>
<p>profile, I would imagine it&rsquo;s raised the profile of drones and</p>
<p>the use of drones in the military. Also, it points out</p>
<p>the weakness of having kind of a large platform strategy in the</p>
<p>case of the Russian military, their platform is this Russian</p>
<p>tank, but so is our military were built around aircraft</p>
<p>carriers, and the F 35. Yes. And you know, the Abrams tank, all</p>
<p>these things, I would imagine are susceptible to drones. And</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s destroying the Russians is their tank costs a</p>
<p>couple million bucks, and it can be destroyed by a drone that</p>
<p>costs 200,000. Oh, many more than a million, even 10s of</p>
<p>millions. EMP.</p>
<p>We just want a billion dollar contract with us. So com</p>
<p>Special Operations Command to, to do counter drone work. And so</p>
<p>to a certain extent, the what you have to do is then say,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna have these, these armored systems, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have these vessels. And then we need to have technology</p>
<p>that allows us to counter drones and is possible to counter</p>
<p>drones. What&rsquo;s going on with Russia is they don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>technology to counter drones. And so they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re largely</p>
<p>just totally</p>
<p>can I can ask you something about this contract? Just</p>
<p>general terms, you said something very important before,</p>
<p>which is, the military industrial complex today is</p>
<p>basically paid to do work, right? Not to get to a result?</p>
<p>Yes. How do you fight that when you&rsquo;re like, when you when you</p>
<p>hear a billion dollar contract, is that cost plus that D o D</p>
<p>just is willing to give you.</p>
<p>So this is, we can do a whole talk on this. But fundamentally,</p>
<p>for people don&rsquo;t know, a cost plus contract structure is the</p>
<p>way that most work for the Department of Defense has done</p>
<p>that means you get paid for your time, your materials, your</p>
<p>people, and then a fixed percentage of profit on top,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re way, way, way, way, way over your budget until</p>
<p>Congress eventually takes them and then there&rsquo;s layers of</p>
<p>subcontractors. So the costs all exactly. And so the bad, the</p>
<p>bad thing about this is that not only the prime contractor owns</p>
<p>the contract, but everyone under them is incentivized to come up</p>
<p>with the most expensive way of solving a problem that they can</p>
<p>convince the government to fund. So they wanted to build the most</p>
<p>expensive system with the most expensive parts with as many</p>
<p>hours as possible. And the bids are so complex that you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>gonna have one or two real bids. Yep. And they&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>gonna be the same price. And those top bids, the worst part</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re not just trying to come up with the most</p>
<p>expensive solution. They&rsquo;re even encouraging the subcontractor</p>
<p>under they get a percent of because they get a percent of</p>
<p>that. And so if I&rsquo;m getting, let&rsquo;s say 6% profit margin, I</p>
<p>want to make it as big a number as possible. And I want to drag</p>
<p>it out. And that&rsquo;s why this budget&rsquo;s balloon like crazy</p>
<p>despite the lack of more money when they do poorly, because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not being paid to make things that work. They&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>paid to do work. That&rsquo;s what I said. It&rsquo;s just the act of the</p>
<p>doing is what gets for you. What do you do different? So we use</p>
<p>our own money to decide what to build, how to build it when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>done, we&rsquo;re using building our own products. And when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to the customer, we&rsquo;re not going to them like first of all,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t just build whatever I want. I can&rsquo;t build a Batmobile</p>
<p>and then try to sell it to the army. But I we talked to them</p>
<p>about their problems. They understand their problems. They</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t it would be cool. He&rsquo;s so big. But, but, but I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>sorry. Would you build someone in this room at Batmobile if he</p>
<p>could come up with the money? If it&rsquo;s if it solved a real</p>
<p>problem, I mean, if that was the right way to solve my office.</p>
<p>All right. I probably not. But the nice thing about this is</p>
<p>that when we go to customers, we&rsquo;re not going to them with a</p>
<p>white paper saying, Hey, let the taxpayers pay for us to try this</p>
<p>out for years and years. We say we&rsquo;ve already proven that this</p>
<p>works. It will not be a boondoggle for you. It will</p>
<p>work. We go to them with a working system with a full</p>
<p>delivery goods and services already de-risked. Exactly. Yeah.</p>
<p>And the thing is, this is popular with the customers and</p>
<p>politicians alike, because it removes the risk of them getting</p>
<p>into political boondoggles like the F35 program being a trillion</p>
<p>dollars. So this creates, this creates new budget line items,</p>
<p>because now folks are saying, I can actually get shit out of</p>
<p>this. I&rsquo;m going to move money from whatever bullshit pot of</p>
<p>money I&rsquo;m spending over here, move it into this sort of a</p>
<p>structure. And then that creates competitive dynamics on market.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. Yeah. So how does it how does it actually close</p>
<p>the loop? So for example, you deliver a drone to the DoD, it</p>
<p>costs 10,000, I&rsquo;m making up a number, it costs $10,000. And it</p>
<p>works on ABC dimension. And then there&rsquo;s whoever makes general</p>
<p>dynamics makes the hellfire drone. Again, I don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>specifics. Of course. And they want to charge 90,000 or 110,000.</p>
<p>How do they still not get picked? Because it seems if you</p>
<p>look at their performance as public companies, yep. It&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incredibly steady, it&rsquo;s almost like an inflationary line item,</p>
<p>you know, that you can predict six, eight, nine, 10% growth</p>
<p>consistently every year. Correct. It is the defense</p>
<p>companies are not high growth, high margin companies, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>extraordinarily predictable. People basically see them as an</p>
<p>extension of the US government. It&rsquo;s like buying bonds of the US</p>
<p>federal budget. Yes, exactly. And when the budget goes up, you</p>
<p>see a direct proportional and linear increase.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, hold on, hold on. Let me ask you a question</p>
<p>about something very pragmatic, knowing what you know, and the</p>
<p>and the tools you&rsquo;re building. And I do appreciate the work</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing, defending the country. I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>work. And I told you that. And I lobbied you to be here to have</p>
<p>your platform and to have your voice. And I&rsquo;ve probably sent</p>
<p>you no less than 30 or 40 invites to come on the pods,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t deny that. And so I told you, I&rsquo;m willing to have any</p>
<p>debate anytime I&rsquo;m going to put aside the personal stuff. But</p>
<p>knowing what you know, doing this very good work, the</p>
<p>situation in Taiwan, if it does materialize, what would it look</p>
<p>like today, given the tools we have? And would we be able to</p>
<p>put Taiwan be able to defend itself? What would that look</p>
<p>like? Because that seems to be the next hotspot that we may</p>
<p>have to do weapons get shipped in there like they are in the</p>
<p>Ukraine? No, that we were able to ship weapons into Ukraine,</p>
<p>because we had countries like Poland that were willing to at</p>
<p>massive existential risk to themselves. Step forward. Yeah,</p>
<p>yeah. Poland has been so paint the picture unsung hero in this</p>
<p>and getting weapons through. But Taiwan, what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a few ways this could go, it could either be just a</p>
<p>blitzkrieg, where they go in destroy the ports, destroy the</p>
<p>airports immediately occupy. That&rsquo;s that could happen. The</p>
<p>other way this could happen could be a more drawn out</p>
<p>blockade where they blockade the island, like, is the US willing</p>
<p>to pull the trigger on a blockade? It&rsquo;s unclear. But if</p>
<p>you can stop trade, if you can economically strangle them, make</p>
<p>sure new weapons don&rsquo;t get to them, they can be in a very,</p>
<p>very bad position. It&rsquo;s not clear that we or anyone else be</p>
<p>able to do that. No, there&rsquo;s different opinions on how things</p>
<p>are going to go. I can&rsquo;t pretend that I know exactly what it is.</p>
<p>I can say Taiwan does not have the tools today that they need</p>
<p>to deter Chinese aggression. They might have had the tools</p>
<p>they needed to deter it a decade ago. But Chinese Chinese</p>
<p>military has been ascendant. They&rsquo;ve been investing so</p>
<p>heavily in new technology, distributed, distributed swarms,</p>
<p>high end electronic warfare systems, and all of the</p>
<p>amphibious landing craft that they&rsquo;re going to need to</p>
<p>perform an invasion. They&rsquo;ve just they&rsquo;ve built the</p>
<p>capability that they need. It&rsquo;s just how vulnerable are aircraft</p>
<p>carriers? How vulnerable are aircraft carriers? They are</p>
<p>extremely vulnerable to the point where we feel like we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t use them. The problem is aircraft carriers were not</p>
<p>designed to be a peer to peer, a peer to peer great powers tool</p>
<p>for us to go toe to toe with the Soviets or the Chinese. Like</p>
<p>the reality is, if each side launches 200 missiles, one of</p>
<p>them is going to get through and it&rsquo;s going to end up hitting</p>
<p>them. And this is especially true with satellite targeting</p>
<p>systems. They were designed in the modern day to project power</p>
<p>to places where you have air superiority uncontested. So</p>
<p>there, it&rsquo;s great to have a mobile base that can go</p>
<p>somewhere and project power, but you cannot stop the Chinese</p>
<p>that way. And also, if we send a carrier out there, and they</p>
<p>managed to sink it, that&rsquo;s 5000 lives lost in one hit.</p>
<p>Hey, Palmer, we got to wrap, but I&rsquo;ll say this.</p>
<p>Wait, I got to say one more thing on Taiwan.</p>
<p>Hold on a second. Oh, not about me. Great. Go.</p>
<p>No, no, no. Not this time. Not this time.</p>
<p>I was bracing for impact. I don&rsquo;t have any anti-Palmer</p>
<p>drone systems.</p>
<p>I will say, I will be working on them next week.</p>
<p>I will say this about J-Cal. If you did that to Kara Swisher,</p>
<p>she would have, she would have like not, she would have pulled</p>
<p>you off stage.</p>
<p>Keep going. You&rsquo;re so right. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think, I think, I think, I will say, so fair. And J-Cal,</p>
<p>J-Cal is, he&rsquo;s an incredibly loyal friend. He&rsquo;s got an</p>
<p>incredibly good heart. And I think that, you know, whatever</p>
<p>he said or did, it was really brave of him to come out here</p>
<p>and also have the conversation. And he wants to have the</p>
<p>conversation, wants to have a dialogue. And he always wants to</p>
<p>do that with all of us. Sometimes he conflicts a bit and</p>
<p>he, and he butts heads. But I will say this about J-Cal. He</p>
<p>means well, and I want to kind of say that for him.</p>
<p>But anyway, finish your point about Taiwan. Let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>the important stuff.</p>
<p>Kara says I&rsquo;m a douchey man boy and a fourth Reich bro Nazi. So</p>
<p>not that you remembered.</p>
<p>Got a long memory. I think your cosplay stuff is cool. I was</p>
<p>brave enough to do cosplay. I&rsquo;m a little jealous of that. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be honest. And I would love to go cosplay with you sometime.</p>
<p>You tell us your final point on Taiwan.</p>
<p>Not the way to wrap the&hellip;</p>
<p>I want to hear his point on Taiwan.</p>
<p>All right. Yes. The big difference between Taiwan and</p>
<p>Ukraine is that we still have a chance to make a difference. So</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m so terrified of is that all these people who say, Oh, we</p>
<p>stand for Ukraine, we have to do this. This is the fight of,</p>
<p>fight of, you know, fight of our generation. And then they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to do anything. And then immediately after Taiwan is</p>
<p>invaded, they&rsquo;re going to change their profile pictures to a</p>
<p>Taiwanese flag and say, Oh, we stand with Taiwan. No, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not good enough. If you care about this issue, there&rsquo;s things</p>
<p>you can do right now. And what&rsquo;s really amazing to me is you have</p>
<p>people who are saying like, Oh, man, I say with Ukraine, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>cutting off all of our Russian business. I&rsquo;m like, Oh, wow, so</p>
<p>brave. You cut off an entire country. That&rsquo;s a regulatory</p>
<p>nightmare has an economy smaller than most US states. Sorry, not</p>
<p>most many. Yeah. It&rsquo;s like, Oh, wow, you&rsquo;re so so brave for</p>
<p>cutting off Russians. And then at the same time, they say, Oh,</p>
<p>but all of our expansion is in China. And I&rsquo;m not gonna say</p>
<p>anything about that. I think that worse than the people who</p>
<p>change their profile pictures are going to be the people who</p>
<p>remain silent when Taiwan is invaded. And they say they just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t say anything because their business interests are so</p>
<p>intermeshed and so intertangled. And that like that China has</p>
<p>been fighting a strategic and economic war against us for a</p>
<p>long time. And it is extraordinarily good. The last</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;ll say on this, I talked about it earlier, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>uniquely American delusion, probably from our own Hollywood</p>
<p>films, that we can solve any problem, the last second, they</p>
<p>will come in, and we just think, boom, de sex machina. We</p>
<p>win. That isn&rsquo;t how Taiwan is going to go. There is no de sex</p>
<p>machina. We know exactly what&rsquo;s going to happen. The war planners</p>
<p>have figured out exactly one of several scenarios that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to go. And when it&rsquo;s happened, we can&rsquo;t pretend like we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. And and there isn&rsquo;t going to be anything that flies into</p>
<p>safe. So okay, so I just want to say one more thing, and then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you close. You and I can debate anti Hillary ads, the</p>
<p>Donald Trump subreddit, all of those things. What we cannot</p>
<p>debate is how important it is that the United States win, and</p>
<p>that democracy wins, and that freedom comes to all of these</p>
<p>countries. You and I are 100% aligned on that, even if we</p>
<p>disagree about the anti Hillary ads or any of that stuff.</p>
<p>Amen. I appreciate you coming. And I&rsquo;ll debate you on anything,</p>
<p>anytime, anywhere. I do care about my family, by the way.</p>
<p>That was the worst thing you said. Okay. And fair enough.</p>
<p>I will apologize for that statement. If I did say it,</p>
<p>wait, take out a letter, a letter. I just said, if I said</p>
<p>something that hurt your feelings about that, and it was</p>
<p>out of line, I apologize. But what&rsquo;s more important right now</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re here talking about the work you&rsquo;re doing. And</p>
<p>you and I will debate to the cows come home this other stuff.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stop you. I can&rsquo;t stop your career. No commentator, no</p>
<p>journalist can stop a founder. I disagree with that.</p>
<p>Oh, I disagree. You can stop a lot of people.</p>
<p>Well, I think we&rsquo;re overestimating my influence in</p>
<p>the world. You&rsquo;re a force of nature. The work you do is</p>
<p>undeniable. We can debate politics as much as we want.</p>
<p>This country needs to be protected. The people at Google</p>
<p>are cowards for not doing DoD contracts. You&rsquo;re not a coward.</p>
<p>You came out here, you&rsquo;re gonna take me on straight up as a man.</p>
<p>I appreciate it. It was a little bit of a blindside, but I can</p>
<p>take it. What&rsquo;s most important is the work you&rsquo;re doing. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s most important. I mean, it&rsquo;s a sucker punch, but I want</p>
<p>to pay. I&rsquo;m from Brooklyn. We appreciate you coming. We</p>
<p>appreciate you coming. Bottom line.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, that was pretty crazy. What an amazing moment. I</p>
<p>think we all learned a lot. But I actually wanted to show you</p>
<p>the clip of the comments that Palmer referenced, just to</p>
<p>provide some context. For those of you who are unaware, the clip</p>
<p>was from a show in March of 2017. Episode 721 of my other</p>
<p>podcast this week in startups. And listen, I&rsquo;m super aware that</p>
<p>this could come across as defensive. But I think some</p>
<p>people might not know what Palmer was talking about. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you decide for yourself. We recorded that</p>
<p>episode, Episode 721, the day Palmer Lucky was fired from</p>
<p>Facebook. And it was a news roundtable of the podcast. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking to Austin Peter Smith, who worked at inside at the</p>
<p>time, and Ian Thompson of the register. He&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>journalist. And just to clarify some facts here on the timeline.</p>
<p>These are from the Daily Beast article in which Palmer was</p>
<p>interviewed, you can go read that it&rsquo;s in the show notes. And</p>
<p>the facts are pretty basic. Palmer Lucky donated some amount</p>
<p>of money to a pro Trump political organization was</p>
<p>called nimble America, right before the 2016 election. And as</p>
<p>you just heard during the all in summit talk, Palmer said it</p>
<p>was like $9,000 nimble America was part of the infamous sub</p>
<p>Reddit page, the Donald if you remember that nimble America,</p>
<p>they basically made anti Hillary and pro Trump memes, and they</p>
<p>were self proclaimed shit posters. As we now talk about</p>
<p>on the internet. The organization said it was</p>
<p>dedicated to proving quote shit posting is powerful and the</p>
<p>magic is real. Palmer was posting to the R Donald under</p>
<p>the anonymous Reddit account called nimble rich man here was</p>
<p>one post which Palmer confirmed writing that was referenced in</p>
<p>the clip you&rsquo;re about to see the American Revolution was funded</p>
<p>by wealthy individuals. The same has been true of many movements</p>
<p>for freedom in history. You can&rsquo;t fight the American elite</p>
<p>without serious firepower. They will outspend you and destroy</p>
<p>you by any and all means. And here is what Palmer told the</p>
<p>Daily Beast in 2016. When asked about supporting nimble America,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got plenty of money money is not my issue. I thought it</p>
<p>sounded like a really jolly good time. Again, if you&rsquo;re listening,</p>
<p>you might hear some other voices talking. Those are the two guests</p>
<p>that I mentioned before. You can watch this three minute and 22</p>
<p>second clip, which is just a mashup of my commentary. I&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>on the other side of three minutes.</p>
<p>He was supporting</p>
<p>like, I was a violent trolling, but extreme trolling would be the</p>
<p>way to do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. And his comment about it was really insensitive</p>
<p>kind of that it was it was almost maybe not super</p>
<p>ideologically driven as much as it was like fun for him.</p>
<p>What an idiot.</p>
<p>Well, it actually lost it lost them a fair amount of business.</p>
<p>There are about three or four game studios that said, right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re no longer developing for the Oculus on this one. Because</p>
<p>he came out and said, basically, well, to overturn a trenched</p>
<p>elite, then you need to be able to fund it and fight back. And</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;re not a revolutionary. This is</p>
<p>just HIT posting about politicians. This is not</p>
<p>constructive dialogue. This is not an attempt to get reform the</p>
<p>American political scene. This is just Oh, let&rsquo;s be a troll.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you want to see like a person&rsquo;s true character, give</p>
<p>them a pile of money or a bunch of power. And then you will see</p>
<p>two bottles of vodka works very well on that as well. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the sort of quick way of being a billionaire or whatever. But I</p>
<p>mean, can you imagine I just want to stop for a second and</p>
<p>just give everybody in my portfolio or the people I work</p>
<p>with just a public service announcement. If you are lucky</p>
<p>enough to hit the jackpot and make hundreds of millions of</p>
<p>dollars, behave yourself. You moron, you hit the jackpot. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like somebody winning the mega ball lottery. And then just</p>
<p>going on the street and randomly punching people in the face.</p>
<p>Like, this guy, Parker Lucky, is a complete and utter moron. For</p>
<p>somebody to be a visionary to create something like Oculus and</p>
<p>make VR. I bought the Oculus. It&rsquo;s pretty impressive. I have</p>
<p>to say, I believe that VR is at least two years away from being</p>
<p>a meaningful business opportunity. But that&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>the window where I like to invest. So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of on</p>
<p>my radar now. In fact, we have one company in our incubator.</p>
<p>But Jesus, this kid&rsquo;s an idiot. But this case, Palmer Lucky is</p>
<p>just an idiot and a troll. So dumb. Here&rsquo;s the other thing, I</p>
<p>think on a leadership basis, if you represent the company, so</p>
<p>you represent your company first Oculus and your vision of the</p>
<p>world, behave yourself. Number two, if you represent the</p>
<p>company that&rsquo;s worth a couple $100 billion that made you a</p>
<p>billionaire, and you represent Mark and Jason who invested in</p>
<p>your company and Jason Horwitz, and you represent all the</p>
<p>employees and all their families and everybody whose entire net</p>
<p>worth is locked up in this, you have a higher duty of service.</p>
<p>And this is a complete lack of moral character and leadership</p>
<p>for someone like Palmer Lucky to be doing this shit posting</p>
<p>effort. I&rsquo;m going to say so. Let&rsquo;s move on to the next</p>
<p>Facebook story. Now that we got over the Palmer Lucky is just a</p>
<p>complete moron who doesn&rsquo;t appreciate his success or care</p>
<p>about any of his employees, family members, team members. If</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do that kind of shenanigans, if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a clue. I hate to get totally crazy. If you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>something like this anonymously, you might want to think that the</p>
<p>anonymity plus Reddit, plus you would be ashamed about it. Like,</p>
<p>think about what you&rsquo;re doing if it&rsquo;s anonymous. In other words,</p>
<p>if you have to put a mask on, and then you throw the brick</p>
<p>through the window, you may not want to throw the brick through</p>
<p>the window because you weren&rsquo;t willing to do with your mask</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>Okay, so closing thoughts. I respect Palmer Lucky for his</p>
<p>incredible innovations, both with Oculus and his new company. We</p>
<p>actually agree on many things, which actually people in the</p>
<p>tech industry might not, which is, hey, producing weapon</p>
<p>systems to protect America and democracy around the world is a</p>
<p>beautiful and important thing. I respect Palmer for what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing there. And we have a disagreement about, you know,</p>
<p>this meme action that he did. But yeah, all&rsquo;s well that ends</p>
<p>well. It was an interesting moment in time. I don&rsquo;t regret</p>
<p>exactly what I said. I think what I said was fair. And when I</p>
<p>talked about it in context, I was, you know, coming from a</p>
<p>place that if you&rsquo;re going to post stuff posted under your</p>
<p>real name, not anonymously. And so there you have it, folks,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the entire controversy. Thank you to Palmer Lucky for</p>
<p>coming. Thanks to my besties for having my back. There was this</p>
<p>big question of if I would go out and engage the discussion.</p>
<p>Of course, I want to go out and engage the discussion. I want to</p>
<p>talk I don&rsquo;t mind a hard discussion. And in fact, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what this podcast is about having hard discussions and then</p>
<p>keeping our friendships and keeping it moving forward. I</p>
<p>look forward to hosting this podcast forever. They&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to take drag me out of here. And I hope we can host</p>
<p>another all in summit and all of you can attend either virtually</p>
<p>or in person. It&rsquo;s great to have had farmer at the event. And</p>
<p>actually, I hope he comes next year and shares more of the</p>
<p>exciting work he&rsquo;s doing at Andrew and I wish him the best</p>
<p>of luck.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride</p>
<p>Rain Man David</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>it. Love you.</p>
<p>Queen of</p>
<p>besties are</p>
<p>dog taking a notice your driveway</p>
<p>will meet me.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just like this like sexual tension that</p>
<p>they just need to release</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re about to be</p>
<p>waiting to get</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>Nick, Nick, can you cue the Can you cue the photo? What photo?</p>
<p>Oh, no. backstage. This is what happened at the last break.</p>
<p>I think we got there. Well, this is what I said. I said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you don&rsquo;t have drones over my house, right? Just to</p>
<p>confirm. And he said, can someone tagline that said</p>
<p>cannot confirm or deny</p>
