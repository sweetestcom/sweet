    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 26, Imperial Crisis and the Goths.</p>
<p>This time, we&rsquo;re going to explore a period of Roman history which is sometimes called</p>
<p>the Imperial Crisis, and this period coincides with the rise of a group of Germanic tribes</p>
<p>who invaded Rome during the same time frame.</p>
<p>These tribes included the ancient Goths, and the Goths are particularly important to us</p>
<p>because they were the first Germanic tribe to provide us with a detailed written account</p>
<p>of their own language, and that makes their language very important in the overall context</p>
<p>of the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>But before I begin, let me note that this episode turned out a little longer than usual,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s part of the reason for the delay in getting it to you, but rather than break</p>
<p>it into two separate episodes, I&rsquo;ve decided to present it to you in one part, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because the overall subject matter relates to events that were taking place at the same</p>
<p>time around the 3rd and 4th centuries.</p>
<p>By this point in history, the original common Germanic language had begun to fracture into</p>
<p>various regional dialects, and for the first time in recorded history, we have references</p>
<p>to the Saxons, so by now we can safely assume that the earliest Saxon dialects were being</p>
<p>spoken in and around northern Germany.</p>
<p>And remember that what we call Old English was really just a particular Saxon dialect</p>
<p>spoken in southwestern England a few centuries later, so we&rsquo;re very close to Old English.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s begin this episode by picking up where we left off last time, in the Danube</p>
<p>region at the end of the 2nd century.</p>
<p>This is where Germanic tribes began to cross into Roman territory and battle the Romans</p>
<p>within the empire itself, and it&rsquo;s also where the first Germanic speakers likely encountered</p>
<p>the alphabet.</p>
<p>In terms of political and military history, the events during this period marked a turning</p>
<p>point for the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>For more than six centuries, Rome had been the aggressor, constantly expanding outward,</p>
<p>increasing the size and scope of the empire, but by the beginning of the 3rd century, that</p>
<p>expansion had stopped, and now Rome actually found itself on the defensive.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the Germans weren&rsquo;t content to remain on the other side of the river,</p>
<p>and that meant the Romans were going to have to fight if they wanted to maintain what they</p>
<p>had acquired over the past few centuries.</p>
<p>And that was the real problem for the Romans.</p>
<p>At a time when they were going to have to fight to defend their empire, they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>in a good position to do that.</p>
<p>Rome was increasingly wracked by problems, and the problems were both internal and external.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now entering the period of the Germanic invasions of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The events of the next few centuries are very complicated because they involve a lot of</p>
<p>moving parts, but the importance of these events can&rsquo;t be overstated.</p>
<p>These events were a major factor in the ultimate fall of the Western Roman Empire, and they</p>
<p>set the stage for many of the nation-states of modern Europe.</p>
<p>And they also ensured the spread of Germanic culture and language into Roman territory.</p>
<p>This is the backdrop for the migration of the Anglo-Saxons to Britain.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a closer look at what was happening to cause these migrations or invasions.</p>
<p>The first part of the story is what was happening within Rome.</p>
<p>Simply stated, Rome was having a lot of internal problems.</p>
<p>In the year 235, the Roman emperor, Severus, was assassinated, and that set in motion a</p>
<p>period of civil wars and rebellions, assassinations, and general chaos which lasted for the next</p>
<p>50 years.</p>
<p>This was a period in which various Roman leaders fought for power, and it&rsquo;s the period that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sometimes called the Imperial Crisis.</p>
<p>During this period, over 20 different leaders assumed power in various parts of the empire.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, this created serious instability within the empire and within the</p>
<p>Roman military itself.</p>
<p>And as the infighting continued, it also forced troops to be withdrawn from the border regions.</p>
<p>And that left the border regions more vulnerable to invasions from across the border.</p>
<p>By the end of the 3rd century, all of these factors meant that there were hardly any Roman</p>
<p>troops left along most of the Rhine and Danube border.</p>
<p>In their place, the Romans had begun to rely more and more upon foreign tribes as mercenaries.</p>
<p>That included Germanic warriors, but it also included peoples on the eastern fringe of</p>
<p>the empire, like the Slavs.</p>
<p>So from the Roman perspective, they were hiring barbarians to defend Rome against other barbarians.</p>
<p>Now this trend of relying on foreign armies actually increased over time.</p>
<p>And that meant that Rome inevitably lost some of the loyalty and discipline which had been</p>
<p>associated with the Roman legions.</p>
<p>It also meant that Rome had to maintain the loyalty of these foreign armies by paying</p>
<p>them or working out some other type of arrangement with them.</p>
<p>One type of arrangement which Rome occasionally implemented was a deal in which the foreign</p>
<p>tribe was allowed to cross into Roman territory and remain there in exchange for their agreement</p>
<p>to defend the region against other tribes.</p>
<p>This was essentially the deal that the Romans made with the Franks in the north, and as</p>
<p>we will see, it was a deal that the Romans made with the Goths in the east as well.</p>
<p>But most of the time, Rome simply paid the mercenaries.</p>
<p>And this too became a problem in the 3rd century.</p>
<p>In an effort to increase the size of the Roman army, and increasingly to pay mercenaries,</p>
<p>the Romans had to come up with more money.</p>
<p>And they did that by issuing lots of new Roman coins.</p>
<p>But there was only so much silver available to put in those coins.</p>
<p>So the Romans began to cut back on the amount of silver in the coins and they replaced the</p>
<p>silver with cheaper metals like bronze and copper.</p>
<p>And that meant there were lots of new coins available, but they weren&rsquo;t worth as much</p>
<p>anymore.</p>
<p>And so you needed a lot more coins to buy the same goods and services.</p>
<p>Economists call this inflation, and when it&rsquo;s really bad, they call it hyperinflation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Rome had to deal with throughout this period.</p>
<p>By the end of the 3rd century, the Roman currency had actually lost most of its value, and barter</p>
<p>had returned as the standard way to pay for goods and services.</p>
<p>Not only did these economic problems contribute to the internal disruptions, it also made</p>
<p>it more difficult to pay the salaries of mercenaries in the border regions.</p>
<p>So you can see why this period is sometimes called the Imperial Crisis.</p>
<p>Rome had suddenly become an economic, political, and military mess.</p>
<p>And all of these internal problems just happened to coincide with new developments which were</p>
<p>occurring across the border in Germania.</p>
<p>And these developments were going to cause even more problems for the Romans.</p>
<p>Throughout the 2nd and 3rd centuries, many of those smaller tribes mentioned by Tacitus,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d begun to join together and form larger tribes, or confederations of tribes.</p>
<p>So we start to see the emergence of bigger and more powerful Germanic tribes, and therefore</p>
<p>more powerful Germanic armies.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s during this period that we have the first mention of tribes like the Saxons</p>
<p>and the Franks, who were both confederations of tribes that were beginning to emerge as</p>
<p>powerful forces in the northern Rhine region.</p>
<p>So why was all of this happening in Germania?</p>
<p>Why were those tribes suddenly forming alliances and creating new mega-tribes?</p>
<p>Well a big part of the answer was population growth.</p>
<p>This growth had begun in the Germanic homeland in Scandinavia a few centuries earlier, and</p>
<p>that population growth in northern Europe had caused the initial expansion of Germanic</p>
<p>tribes southward out of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>As some of those tribes migrated into the region around the Rhine, they ran up against</p>
<p>the Roman Empire and they couldn&rsquo;t expand any further.</p>
<p>So those tribes settled down, and they began to switch from nomadic herding to crop farming.</p>
<p>As their populations continued to grow, their settlements grew larger and larger.</p>
<p>Small settlements turned into villages.</p>
<p>And the surrounding farms were expanded outward further and further to sustain the population.</p>
<p>This process continued until one day small, isolated tribes suddenly became next-door</p>
<p>neighbors.</p>
<p>And eventually those neighboring tribes began to coalesce and form alliances.</p>
<p>These new tribal confederations eventually grew into mega-tribes.</p>
<p>And that meant these tribes were much more powerful.</p>
<p>And when you combine this process, which was taking place in Germania, with the imperial</p>
<p>crisis taking place in Rome, you can see the balance of power shifting from the Romans</p>
<p>to the Germans.</p>
<p>And as I noted, this process produced the first mention of tribes like the Franks and</p>
<p>the Saxons around this time.</p>
<p>But just to the south of the emerging Franks and Saxons, there was another new tribe emerging.</p>
<p>This was in the region where the Rhine and the Danube both originate, in southwestern</p>
<p>Germany.</p>
<p>And this new confederation of tribes was called the Alemanni.</p>
<p>And the name Alemanni actually tells us a lot about what was happening at this time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally believed that Alemanni meant all men, ala meaning all and mani meaning</p>
<p>men.</p>
<p>So, the name of this Alemanni tribe reflects the fact that it was a group of different</p>
<p>tribes which had banded together into a new confederation.</p>
<p>Modern scholars are still not entirely sure which tribes contributed to this new group,</p>
<p>but many believe that it included remnants of the Marcomanni and Quadi tribes that I</p>
<p>mentioned in the last episode.</p>
<p>As I noted last time, these tribes eventually migrated from the region which had become</p>
<p>known as Bohemia, and they moved westward along the Danube into the region which came</p>
<p>to be known as Bavaria.</p>
<p>Well, this just happens to be the same general region where the Alemanni tribe began to emerge</p>
<p>during the 3rd century.</p>
<p>Now if you studied French or Spanish, that name Alemanni may seem a bit familiar to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the root of the name of the modern nation of Germany in both of those</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>In French, Germany is Alemannia, and in Spanish, it&rsquo;s Alemania.</p>
<p>The same Germanic tribe is also the root of the name of Germany in Portuguese, Welsh,</p>
<p>Turkish, Arabic, and Persian, as well as a variety of other languages.</p>
<p>And that should give you an idea of how powerful and important this tribe was for a period</p>
<p>of time in the 3rd century.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you&rsquo;re a fan of square dancing, you&rsquo;ve probably danced to the name of this</p>
<p>tribe.</p>
<p>You might do-si-do, but you&rsquo;re also probably Alemann left or right.</p>
<p>And this particular square dancing step comes from the name of the ancient Germanic tribe,</p>
<p>the Alemanni.</p>
<p>And it actually comes from a dance which originated in Germany and passed to France in the 17th</p>
<p>century.</p>
<p>Since the French name for Germany was Alemannia, the French called this particular German dance</p>
<p>the Alemannda.</p>
<p>And when the French colonized the region of Louisiana, the name passed to North America.</p>
<p>And from there, one of the steps in the Alemannda was incorporated into square dancing.</p>
<p>So the name of the Alemanni tribe is still with us today.</p>
<p>And in the 3rd century, the Alemanni became a major problem for the Roman army.</p>
<p>In the year 260, the Alemanni crossed the Roman border and invaded deep into Roman territory.</p>
<p>In fact, they crossed the Alps and passed all the way down to Milan.</p>
<p>As a result, they forced the Romans to abandon the traditional frontier which ran along the</p>
<p>Rhine and the Danube.</p>
<p>And this actually created a wedge in the Roman border.</p>
<p>During this period, the Romans were distracted by other invading tribes, which I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to talk about later.</p>
<p>But eventually the Romans were able to push the Alemanni back across the border.</p>
<p>And for a while, it looked like the Alemanni threat was over.</p>
<p>But in the 4th century, their invasions began again.</p>
<p>And in fact, it wasn&rsquo;t until the 8th century, long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire,</p>
<p>that they were finally defeated by the Franks.</p>
<p>And it was only then that they ceased to be an independent kingdom.</p>
<p>And even today, Alemannic German is a prominent dialect of the modern High German languages.</p>
<p>Now as I noted, it was ultimately the Franks, not the Romans, who permanently defeated the</p>
<p>Alemanni.</p>
<p>Both of these tribes were new confederations formed by uniting smaller tribes together.</p>
<p>In fact, during the 3rd century, the Alemanni appeared to be a bigger threat to Rome than</p>
<p>the Frankish tribes further north along the Rhine.</p>
<p>But over the next couple of centuries, the power of the Franks would eventually eclipse</p>
<p>the Alemanni, as well as most of the other Germanic tribes in the region.</p>
<p>Around the time of that first great invasion by the Alemanni, the Franks were a brand new</p>
<p>confederation which had just appeared on the scene.</p>
<p>One theory is that the various tribes which came together to form the Franks did so because</p>
<p>of the rising power of the Alemanni to their south.</p>
<p>The first references to the name Franks actually occurred shortly before that great Alemanni</p>
<p>invasion in 260.</p>
<p>The name appeared in a Roman army marching song from that period.</p>
<p>But by the time the Alemanni were invading the Roman Empire, it had become evident that</p>
<p>the new Franks also wanted to settle across the Rhine in Roman territory.</p>
<p>And they sought to do that by taking advantage of Rome&rsquo;s gradual loss of control over its</p>
<p>borders.</p>
<p>Around the year 250, a group of Franks crossed the Rhine and penetrated deep into Gaul, all</p>
<p>the way to modern day Spain.</p>
<p>And from that point on, the Franks were a constant threat in the northern Rhine region.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve noted before, the Franks would eventually succeed in this objective.</p>
<p>They would eventually establish a Frankish kingdom in northeastern Gaul, and as Roman</p>
<p>power in Gaul waned, it was the Franks who filled that vacuum and came to dominate the</p>
<p>entire region.</p>
<p>And of course, they thereby provided us with the name of the modern nation of France.</p>
<p>But the origin of the name Franks is uncertain.</p>
<p>Lots of theories have been suggested by etymologists, but no one knows for certain what the original</p>
<p>name meant.</p>
<p>Franks have been made to the Old Norse word fraca and the Old English word franca, which</p>
<p>meant hunting spear or lance or javelin.</p>
<p>But many scholars think that these words came from the name of the Frankish tribe, not the</p>
<p>other way around.</p>
<p>The name of the Franks also resulted in the late Latin word francus, which initially meant</p>
<p>free or unrestrained.</p>
<p>This meaning is probably derived from the fact that the Franks cut that deal with the</p>
<p>Romans that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>They were eventually permitted to settle across the Rhine where they lived as a free tribe</p>
<p>in exchange for their agreement to defend the border.</p>
<p>So francus came to mean free or unrestrained.</p>
<p>This word later passed into early French as franc, and over time the meaning of the word</p>
<p>expanded from its original sense as free to a much broader sense of being open, sincere</p>
<p>and genuine, as in to speak freely.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the version which we still have in modern English in the word frank, as in</p>
<p>let me be frank with you, or frankly, my dear, I don&rsquo;t give a damn.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with politics, especially American politics, you may have heard of franking</p>
<p>privileges.</p>
<p>That term basically refers to the right of politicians to send mail from their office</p>
<p>to their constituents without having to pay postage, which is a nice benefit if you happen</p>
<p>to own a political office.</p>
<p>Well that use of the term frank or franking can also be traced back to this same French</p>
<p>root word, and it originally meant that the letter was free to be sent or delivered because</p>
<p>postage had been paid for it.</p>
<p>So it didn&rsquo;t mean free as in no cost, it meant free as in ready to be delivered.</p>
<p>But again, it ultimately comes from the name of this Germanic tribe, the Franks.</p>
<p>The old French word franchise meant that you were free to do something without legal restriction.</p>
<p>This term eventually passed into English as franchise, and its meaning shifted to mean</p>
<p>a particular legal right, specifically the right to vote.</p>
<p>So today when we speak of someone being disenfranchised, we mean that they&rsquo;ve had their vote or rights</p>
<p>taken away.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the 20th century that the term franchise came to refer to a different</p>
<p>type of legal right, specifically the right to sell a company&rsquo;s products or services.</p>
<p>And this is the source of the modern sense of the word franchise as a type of business.</p>
<p>So if you buy a franchise, you&rsquo;re free to sell a particular company&rsquo;s goods and services.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re usually free to use the company&rsquo;s name and logos.</p>
<p>All of that originating from the sense of the word franc, meaning free.</p>
<p>The same use of the word franc as free also appears in the family name Franklin.</p>
<p>That name first appeared in the 12th century after the Norman French invaded England, and</p>
<p>it meant a landowner who was free by means other than noble birth.</p>
<p>And the name of the francs also appears in the name of the modern city of Frankfurt in</p>
<p>Germany, which originally meant Frank&rsquo;s Ford, or shallow river crossing, on the River Main.</p>
<p>And Frankfurt also gave us the frankfurter.</p>
<p>And even today, we sometimes call a frankfurter a frank, so we&rsquo;re right back at the beginning.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s the same way we get hamburger in modern English as well.</p>
<p>Hamburgers are not made from ham, but they come, or at least the name comes from Hamburg,</p>
<p>Germany.</p>
<p>So the name of the Frankish tribe ultimately gives us words like France, French, Frank,</p>
<p>franking franchise, disenfranchise, Franklin, Frankfurt, and frankfurter.</p>
<p>Now as I&rsquo;ve noted, the Franks and the Alemanni were making life very difficult for the Romans</p>
<p>along the Rhine in the 3rd and 4th centuries.</p>
<p>But further east, along the Danube, there were even bigger problems brewing.</p>
<p>In fact, the ultimate cause of a lot of these problems along the Roman border could be found</p>
<p>much further away in Eastern Europe, in places like modern-day Poland, Ukraine, Hungary,</p>
<p>and Romania.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noted in past episodes that there was a very early division of the Germanic tribes</p>
<p>into Northern tribes and Western tribes and Eastern tribes.</p>
<p>Well by this point, those Eastern Germanic tribes were spread throughout this part of</p>
<p>Eastern Europe, and they had also developed a very distinct dialect by this point.</p>
<p>These tribes included tribes like the Vandals and the Goths.</p>
<p>By the 3rd century, these tribes had migrated down into the Balkans and the lower Danube</p>
<p>region.</p>
<p>And as some of these Eastern Germanic tribes began to move westward, a domino effect ensued.</p>
<p>So this was indirectly pushing those Western tribes that I just mentioned, like the Franks</p>
<p>and the Alamanni, into the Rhine and across the Rhine into Roman territory.</p>
<p>And this process would actually accelerate over the next couple of centuries as a new</p>
<p>group arrived from the Eurasian steppes to the east, and that was the Huns, but more</p>
<p>about them later.</p>
<p>Now at this point, around the same time as the Alamanni and the Franks were crossing</p>
<p>the Rhine to the west, the Vandals were threatening the middle Danube region in the south.</p>
<p>Remember that the Vandals were an Eastern Germanic tribe speaking an Eastern Germanic</p>
<p>dialect.</p>
<p>They had migrated out of Scandinavia a few centuries earlier, and now they were sitting</p>
<p>along the middle Danube.</p>
<p>The Romans encountered the Vandals, and for now, they were able to hold the Vandals back,</p>
<p>and they even made a temporary peace, but as with many of these tribes, peace treaties</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t tend to last very long.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of centuries, the Vandals would regroup and head west straight for Gaul.</p>
<p>This time, they were spurred on by the Huns who were pouring in from the east and causing</p>
<p>a chain reaction.</p>
<p>The Vandals eventually reached the Rhine, where they busted through the Roman defenses</p>
<p>and traveled straight through Gaul itself.</p>
<p>They eventually traveled south into modern-day Spain, and from there, they crossed into North</p>
<p>Africa where they set up a kingdom there.</p>
<p>And in fact, this Germanic tribe, the Vandals, maintained a very powerful kingdom in North</p>
<p>Africa in the 5th century.</p>
<p>They even launched an invasion from the ancient side of Carthage, and they did something that</p>
<p>Carthage was never able to do.</p>
<p>They crossed the Mediterranean and sacked Rome.</p>
<p>This happened around the same time that the Anglo-Saxons began migrating to Britain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little later in our story, but I wanted to give you a sense of the territory</p>
<p>covered by this tribe, the Vandals.</p>
<p>They started out in Scandinavia, traveled into Eastern Europe, encountered the Romans</p>
<p>in the Balkans, invaded modern-day France and Spain, conquered North Africa, and then</p>
<p>invaded and sacked Rome from across the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>So from all of that, you might be able to see why we still have the name of the Vandals</p>
<p>in modern English.</p>
<p>And in fact, unlike the names of other Germanic tribes, their name comes to us virtually unchanged</p>
<p>from the use of the name by the Romans.</p>
<p>Like many of the Germanic tribes, the Romans considered the Vandals to be very dangerous</p>
<p>barbarians.</p>
<p>But after the Vandals sacked Rome, the name of the Vandals came to mean looters, robbers,</p>
<p>and pillagers.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re going to see, the Vandals weren&rsquo;t the first to sack and loot Rome during this</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p>The Goths actually beat them to it.</p>
<p>But for some reason, the later Roman writers had a particular distaste for the Vandals.</p>
<p>And they seemed to blame the Vandals more than any other group for the destruction of</p>
<p>the city of Rome itself.</p>
<p>The term Vandalism was actually coined in France after the French Revolution to describe</p>
<p>the destruction and violence which occurred in France during that period.</p>
<p>But the term harkened back to the fall of Rome, and it probably seemed quite appropriate</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>From the French, the term spread into English, where it still retains its meaning as the</p>
<p>willful destruction of property.</p>
<p>By the way, if you&rsquo;re curious, the origin of the name Vandals was an original Germanic</p>
<p>word, wandl, which meant wanderer.</p>
<p>And that Germanic word ultimately gives us the modern English word wander, as in to</p>
<p>roam around.</p>
<p>So that name was very appropriate for this tribe.</p>
<p>And that also makes the term wander and vandal cognate, both coming from the same Germanic</p>
<p>root word.</p>
<p>And once again, we see that late Latin sound shift, which converted the W sound into the</p>
<p>V sound in many Latin words.</p>
<p>So just as winum, meaning wine, became venum, the same thing happened here.</p>
<p>And wandals became vandals.</p>
<p>The later French also used this same Germanic root word, now pronounced with the V at the</p>
<p>beginning, and they used it to create another word, vagrant.</p>
<p>Vagrant still has that same meaning as a wanderer, but it&rsquo;s now acquired a more negative sense,</p>
<p>as in a beggar or tramp.</p>
<p>And in medieval Latin, if you wandered around outside of a specific place where you were</p>
<p>supposed to be, you were extravagant, or as we know it today, extravagant.</p>
<p>Of course, today the term refers to anything that&rsquo;s excessive or beyond the normal expectations.</p>
<p>The medieval French also created another word from this same root word, which was very similar</p>
<p>to vagrant, and that&rsquo;s the word vagabond.</p>
<p>That word has also made its way into modern English.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re trying to explain something and your thoughts wander around without being</p>
<p>specific and to the point, well, you&rsquo;re being vague, another word the French created from</p>
<p>that same Germanic root word.</p>
<p>So all of that means the words wander, vandal, vandalism, vagrant, vagabond, extravagant,</p>
<p>and vague are all cognate.</p>
<p>They all come from the same Germanic root word.</p>
<p>And also note that all of those words, except for wander, came through French or Latin before</p>
<p>they got to English.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they all have a v at the beginning instead of a w.</p>
<p>But it also shows that borrowing is a two-way street.</p>
<p>The Romans sometimes borrowed Germanic words.</p>
<p>And over time, the Romans and French created lots of new words from those original Germanic</p>
<p>words.</p>
<p>So some of our Latin words in modern English are actually Germanic words if we trace them</p>
<p>back far enough.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve looked at the Alamanni, the Franks, and the Vandals.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen how they took advantage of the deteriorating situation in Rome, and they</p>
<p>made repeated efforts to invade Roman territory.</p>
<p>But now we need to turn our attention even farther east, all the way to the Black Sea</p>
<p>region and the Eurasian steppes, the same region which was once the home of the first</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>A completely separate Germanic tribe had found its way to this region.</p>
<p>This tribe was the Goths.</p>
<p>The important thing to understand about the Goths is their longevity.</p>
<p>The Greek traveler Pythias wrote about a tribe called the Gotonus in northern Europe</p>
<p>in the 4th century B.C.</p>
<p>Tacitus then mentions them in the region of modern-day Poland in the 1st century A.D.</p>
<p>He called them Gotonus.</p>
<p>By the time of the imperial crisis in the 3rd century, they were in the area north of</p>
<p>the Black Sea, and they were called the Goths.</p>
<p>Over the next five centuries, they would expand across southern Europe.</p>
<p>They would fight for the Romans.</p>
<p>They would fight against the Romans.</p>
<p>They would sack Rome for the first time since the creation of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>They would control a large portion of Gaul.</p>
<p>They would establish a kingdom in Italy that lasted until the 6th century.</p>
<p>And they would establish a kingdom in Spain which would last until the Moors arrived in</p>
<p>the 8th century.</p>
<p>By the time these Gothic kingdoms finally collapsed, the Goths had left a recorded legacy</p>
<p>which lasted for more than a thousand years.</p>
<p>So they have a long and fascinating history.</p>
<p>In terms of their political and military history, I&rsquo;m just going to cover the first part of</p>
<p>their story in this episode.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at the rest of that history next time when we wind up our look at the</p>
<p>Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But for our purposes, the real importance of the Goths was their language and the fact</p>
<p>that it was written down in the 4th century.</p>
<p>A Gothic translation of the Bible and other religious texts from this period still survive</p>
<p>to this very day.</p>
<p>And that makes Gothic the first Germanic language to be written down in detail.</p>
<p>And since these Gothic texts are a translation of the Bible, linguists have found it relatively</p>
<p>easy to translate the language and compare it word for word with Latin and Greek.</p>
<p>And this research enables scholars to essentially go back in time and examine this particular</p>
<p>Germanic language as it existed in the 4th century.</p>
<p>And since this period is only 3 or 4 centuries removed from the common Proto-Germanic period,</p>
<p>it allows linguists to examine the evolution of the Germanic languages over time.</p>
<p>So we can actually examine the vocabulary and syntax and grammar of the Germanic language</p>
<p>for the first time without having to rely on reconstructions.</p>
<p>Now before we look closer at the Goths, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that their language</p>
<p>was not an early version of English.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons and the Goths were separate groups of Germanic tribes who lived in different</p>
<p>parts of Europe at the same time.</p>
<p>The Angles and Saxons spoke West Germanic languages.</p>
<p>And the Goths spoke an East Germanic language.</p>
<p>But their respective languages were still very similar at this early point.</p>
<p>Now in terms of the history of English, if we had Anglo-Saxon texts from the same time</p>
<p>frame as the Gothic Bible, we probably wouldn&rsquo;t find the Gothic language all that interesting.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to compare the languages, just like it&rsquo;s interesting to compare the</p>
<p>early High German dialects with Old English.</p>
<p>But it would really be more of an academic exercise.</p>
<p>But the problem is, we don&rsquo;t have Anglo-Saxon texts from this period.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have text in any other Germanic language from this period either.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t have text in any other Germanic languages for several more centuries.</p>
<p>So you can see why historical linguists are so fascinated with the Gothic language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the missing link between the original common Proto-Germanic language and the later</p>
<p>Germanic languages that were written down from around the 7th century onwards.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s not the mother of English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really more like a sister of English.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the Goths.</p>
<p>Having migrated from Scandinavia through Eastern Europe, the Goths arrived in the region north</p>
<p>of the Black Sea shortly after the time of Tacitus.</p>
<p>We should keep in mind that it&rsquo;s probably a mistake to think of the Goths as some kind</p>
<p>of completely unified and homogenous tribe.</p>
<p>The Goths were likely a collection of tribes and war bands and other nomadic peoples who</p>
<p>were collectively referred to as Goths by the Romans.</p>
<p>So in many respects, they were similar to the Alemanni and the Franks in the West.</p>
<p>They were sort of like a snowball rolling down a hill and getting bigger and bigger</p>
<p>as they moved southward.</p>
<p>The first Goths reached an area north of the Black Sea by around the year 170.</p>
<p>So around the time of the Marcomannic Wars, which I described in the last episode.</p>
<p>Over the next century, other Goths continued to move into this region, and they became</p>
<p>well entrenched around the northern and western side of the Black Sea.</p>
<p>And that put them just north of the Roman border.</p>
<p>Once in place, the Goths were joined by waves of other migrating peoples.</p>
<p>So there was no single migration.</p>
<p>It was a series of migrations over a period of several decades.</p>
<p>And despite the label, there was probably no distinctive Gothic culture at this point.</p>
<p>It was really just a collection of culturally mixed groups.</p>
<p>But the sheer size of the group made it a potentially powerful force.</p>
<p>And that coincided with the imperial crisis back in Rome.</p>
<p>So Rome was distracted by events within the empire and along other portions of the border.</p>
<p>Now up to this point, I&rsquo;ve noted that the Danube was the border between Rome and Germania.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really a simplified version of events.</p>
<p>In reality, shortly after the time of Tacitus, the Romans had crossed the eastern Danube</p>
<p>near the Black Sea, around modern-day Romania.</p>
<p>And there they had established a Roman territory that they called Dacia.</p>
<p>But Roman control of this region had always been tenuous.</p>
<p>And now the Goths were sitting right on the northern border of Dacia.</p>
<p>In the 3rd century, the Goths unleashed an ongoing assault on Dacia and in fact the entire</p>
<p>Black Sea region.</p>
<p>They actually built ships and crossed the Black Sea itself, where they raided the Black</p>
<p>Sea coast, including the coast of modern-day Turkey.</p>
<p>They even traveled through the Bosporus Strait and attacked Greece and the Aegean.</p>
<p>And this is very important because remember that Greek was the dominant language in the</p>
<p>Black Sea region during this period.</p>
<p>It was basically the lingua franca of the region.</p>
<p>Well after a few years and a lot of success, the Goths decided to refocus on expansion</p>
<p>by land.</p>
<p>And they largely abandoned their maritime campaigns across the Black Sea and the Aegean.</p>
<p>But they returned to their Gothic base with a large number of Greek-speaking captives,</p>
<p>including many from central Anatolia, modern-day Turkey.</p>
<p>And some of those captives ultimately served as mediators between the Goths and the Greek</p>
<p>world to the south.</p>
<p>And one of the descendants of those captives was a man named Wophilus.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the person who translated the Greek Bible into Gothic.</p>
<p>Now throughout this period of the 3rd century, the Romans were able to score some occasional</p>
<p>victories, but they weren&rsquo;t able to keep the Goths out of Dacia north of the Danube,</p>
<p>especially after the Goths began to focus more and more on campaigns by land.</p>
<p>And remember that all of this Gothic expansion was taking place at the same time as the imperial</p>
<p>crisis in Rome, and at the same time as the invasions of the Alamanni and the Franks</p>
<p>along the Rhine in the west.</p>
<p>So it was all too much for the Romans to deal with.</p>
<p>And in the year 270, the Romans finally retreated back across the Danube, thereby leaving Dacia</p>
<p>to the Goths.</p>
<p>As I noted, Dacia was part of modern-day Romania.</p>
<p>And even though the borders of Dacia varied over time, it was generally centered around</p>
<p>the region we know today as Transylvania.</p>
<p>So keep that little bit of information in the back of your mind.</p>
<p>Because the Goths now called it home.</p>
<p>And with Dacia occupied by the Goths, there were now two separate groups of Goths.</p>
<p>The group which had remained north of the Black Sea, further east, were called the Ostrogoths.</p>
<p>And the group which settled along the north side of the Danube in Dacia were called the</p>
<p>Visigoths.</p>
<p>Both of these groups shared a common language, the Gothic language.</p>
<p>But from this point forward, their history and their culture will start to diverge.</p>
<p>And we can begin to think of them as separate and distinct tribes.</p>
<p>Now the name Ostrogoths meant Eastern Goths.</p>
<p>In fact, that Germanic prefix, Ostro, may seem a little familiar to you.</p>
<p>You might remember from the episode on Germanic mythology that the Indo-Europeans had a word,</p>
<p>Aus, which meant to shine, especially shining at dawn.</p>
<p>And so this word came to be associated with the sun rising in the morning and eventually</p>
<p>came to be associated with the direction in which the sun rose.</p>
<p>And the Indo-European root word produced the original Germanic word, Austra, meaning east</p>
<p>towards the sunrise.</p>
<p>In English, that Germanic word eventually produced the word east that we have today.</p>
<p>But in the separate Gothic language, it produced the word Austro.</p>
<p>So the Ostrogoths were the Goths in the east along the northern Black Sea, in the steppe</p>
<p>region.</p>
<p>So if Ostrogoths meant Eastern Goths, you might assume that Visigoths means Western</p>
<p>Goths.</p>
<p>But the etymology here is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>Originally, this Dacian group were simply called the Visi, not the Visigoths.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until the 6th century that the Romans coined the term Visigoths, apparently</p>
<p>influenced by that term Ostrogoths.</p>
<p>And many assume that this term Visigoths meant Western Goths, just like Ostrogoths meant</p>
<p>Eastern Goths.</p>
<p>But the prefix visi actually came from the original name of this Dacian group of Goths.</p>
<p>So what did that name visi mean?</p>
<p>Well, the v at the beginning appears to be another example of that later Latin sound</p>
<p>shift from the w sound to the v sound, because the tribe was called the Wisi by earlier Roman</p>
<p>sources and Visi by later sources after the sound change.</p>
<p>So there are some scholars who think that the original name, Wisi, meant West.</p>
<p>And therefore, Visigoths does in fact mean Western Goths if we trace the name back to</p>
<p>its original meaning.</p>
<p>But there are other scholars who think that Wisi simply meant good, and that the name</p>
<p>of the original tribe meant good or worthy people.</p>
<p>At any rate, it&rsquo;s very common today to see the term Visigoth interpreted as Western Goth.</p>
<p>But I just wanted to note that there&rsquo;s still some debate about that name.</p>
<p>Now shortly after the Goths, or more specifically the Visigoths, took control of Dacia from</p>
<p>the Romans, Rome finally started to get its house in order.</p>
<p>The imperial crisis in Rome and all of the chaos of the preceding 50 years finally came</p>
<p>to an end, at least for a while.</p>
<p>And the key to ending this crisis was a new Roman emperor named Diocletian.</p>
<p>He became emperor in the year 284, 14 years after the Romans abandoned Dacia, which had</p>
<p>been the first Roman province to fall to the Germans.</p>
<p>Under Diocletian&rsquo;s leadership, Rome began to reorganize the way its provinces were administered.</p>
<p>It had become obvious that centralized power in Rome was no longer effective.</p>
<p>The empire was too big and it faced too many challenges.</p>
<p>So Diocletian decided to abandon the idea of centralized rule in Rome.</p>
<p>There was a natural linguistic division within the empire.</p>
<p>To the west, Latin was the dominant language.</p>
<p>In the east, Greek was the dominant language.</p>
<p>And this provided the basis for dividing the empire into separate western and eastern sections.</p>
<p>The empire was ultimately divided into four regions, each having its own capital and its</p>
<p>own emperor.</p>
<p>Two regions were established in the east and two regions were established in the west.</p>
<p>So, at this early point, we can begin to see the division of the empire into the eastern</p>
<p>and western portions.</p>
<p>And at this point, the city of Rome ceased to be the capital of the empire.</p>
<p>After Diocletian retired, the empire actually devolved into civil war again for a couple</p>
<p>of decades.</p>
<p>But, by the year 324, Constantine had emerged as the sole emperor of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The empire was briefly reunited under his leadership and, thanks to his religious conversion,</p>
<p>the empire now had a new official religion, Christianity.</p>
<p>Constantine also settled in the Greek city of Byzantium in western Anatolia and he made</p>
<p>it his new capital.</p>
<p>And it came to be known as Constantinople, after Constantine.</p>
<p>And of course, when the empire was permanently split, it became the capital of the east.</p>
<p>Since the time of Diocletian a few decades earlier, the relationship between Rome and</p>
<p>the Germanic tribes had started to settle down somewhat.</p>
<p>As Rome became more stable, it was a less inviting target for the Germans.</p>
<p>So for example, once the Goths took control of Dacia, there was no significant battle</p>
<p>between them and the Romans for several decades.</p>
<p>In fact, this was a period in which the Romans were increasingly relying upon Germanic mercenaries,</p>
<p>so many Goths actually sided with Rome during this period.</p>
<p>After Constantine became emperor, conflicts between the empire and the Goths briefly reoccurred.</p>
<p>But a treaty was negotiated in the year 332, which stabilized the relationship.</p>
<p>Rome agreed to make annual payments to the Goths, in return for the resumption of trade</p>
<p>across the Danube, and in return for the Goths&rsquo; agreement to provide Rome with troops as needed.</p>
<p>In fact, Rome was busy cutting similar deals with other tribes like the Franks and the</p>
<p>Alemanni and the Saxons.</p>
<p>Throughout this period, and especially after that treaty in 332, trade became much more</p>
<p>regular between the Goths and the Romans across the Danube.</p>
<p>And that movement of goods also meant there was a corresponding movement of people back</p>
<p>and forth.</p>
<p>And with the movement of people, there was an exchange of cultures.</p>
<p>And part of that exchange included that new official Roman religion, Christianity.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, the Gothic missionary Wulfilis had been born to a family of Anatolian</p>
<p>origin that had been taken into captivity by the Visigoths as part of that earlier raid.</p>
<p>But Wulfilis was born among the Visigoths, and he was reared as a Goth speaking the Gothic</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>As a boy, he was sent to Constantinople as a hostage, and there he was exposed to Christianity.</p>
<p>And he was eventually consecrated a bishop for the purpose of spreading Christianity</p>
<p>back to the Goths.</p>
<p>Wulfilis then traveled to Dacia, and there he converted many Goths to Christianity.</p>
<p>In order to secure the conversion of Goths to Christianity, Wulfilis needed a Gothic</p>
<p>version of the Bible.</p>
<p>Very few Goths spoke Latin or Greek.</p>
<p>So he undertook the translation of the Bible.</p>
<p>We know that the Germanic runic symbols had started to be used for brief inscriptions</p>
<p>by this period.</p>
<p>But they weren&rsquo;t really suited for translating the Bible.</p>
<p>And even if they were, many Greek religious names and other terms were going to have to</p>
<p>be maintained, and the runes couldn&rsquo;t capture all of the sounds of the Greek language.</p>
<p>So Wulfilis created his own Gothic alphabet, which was a combination of the runic alphabet</p>
<p>and the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p>And the final product of all of his work was the Gothic Bible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the entire Bible didn&rsquo;t survive the ages, but much of it did.</p>
<p>And a few other miscellaneous religious texts also still exist in Gothic.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve noted, the Gothic translation of the Bible preserved the Gothic language of</p>
<p>the 4th century for future generations to examine.</p>
<p>So that makes Gothic the oldest attested Germanic language.</p>
<p>And given its age, it gives us a glimpse of what the Germanic languages looked and sounded</p>
<p>like shortly after the end of the original Proto-Germanic period.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the Gothic language.</p>
<p>In the last episode, I noted that the original Germanic language had a Z sound, which eventually</p>
<p>shifted to an R sound.</p>
<p>Linguists call this tendency of certain sounds to shift to an R sound rhotacism.</p>
<p>Well, this sound never shifted within the Gothic language.</p>
<p>So the Goths held on to that original sibilant sound, and it appears as an SS or ZZ sound</p>
<p>in many Gothic words, where we have an R sound in other Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So for example, the Goths had a word which meant to accumulate or store something.</p>
<p>And that word was pronounced husd.</p>
<p>The Old English equivalent of that word was horde.</p>
<p>And that word has actually changed very little over the years within English.</p>
<p>We still have it in modern English as horde, h-o-a-r-d, as in to horde food.</p>
<p>So between Gothic husd and Old English horde, you can hear that shift to the R sound that</p>
<p>never occurred within Gothic.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll give you another example.</p>
<p>The Goths had a word which meant to acquire knowledge or skills.</p>
<p>And that word was lesion.</p>
<p>And the Old English version of that word was lern.</p>
<p>And lern is the Old English version of learn.</p>
<p>So between lesion and lern, you can hear the newer R sound in Old English.</p>
<p>And again, as we look at other early Germanic languages, we also see the R sound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only Gothic which held on to that original sibilant.</p>
<p>Also, the Gothic word mesa is equivalent to the Old English word mare.</p>
<p>And that word eventually became more in modern English.</p>
<p>So we can see in the modern English words most and more that one retains an original</p>
<p>sibilant sound, the S sounds, and the other has the later R sound.</p>
<p>The Gothic word wessen is equivalent to the Old English word weren, which eventually became</p>
<p>were, W-E-R-E, in modern English.</p>
<p>So again, in modern English, we have two variations of this word.</p>
<p>In the case of was, we see an original sibilant sound, the S sound, and in were, we see the</p>
<p>later R sound, which developed prior to Old English.</p>
<p>So Gothic never developed that particular sound shift.</p>
<p>But outside of that difference, you&rsquo;ll note that the Gothic words and the Old English</p>
<p>words were very similar.</p>
<p>The Gothic language also had a unique consonant sound that didn&rsquo;t exist in other Germanic</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>It was basically a combination of the TH sound and the L sound.</p>
<p>So it came out as a THL sound.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little hard to represent that sound in modern English, but think of the</p>
<p>name Kathleen.</p>
<p>That group of consonants in the middle, the TH, is a rough example of this sound.</p>
<p>But within Gothic words, the sound could appear anywhere, even at the beginning.</p>
<p>Now in other Germanic languages, including Old English, the tendency was to use an FL</p>
<p>sound instead of this Gothic THL sound.</p>
<p>So the Goths had a word which meant to run away.</p>
<p>And it was pronounced flean.</p>
<p>But in Old English, the word was flean.</p>
<p>And that word eventually became flea, F-L-E-E, in modern English.</p>
<p>So you can hear the difference in sounds at the beginning of those two words.</p>
<p>Gothic fleuan and Old English flean.</p>
<p>And not to make this sound too technical, but Gothic had a dual pronoun form in first</p>
<p>person and second person, which doesn&rsquo;t generally exist in any other Germanic languages</p>
<p>except Old Norse.</p>
<p>So for example, in English, we have a first person singular pronoun, I, and a plural pronoun,</p>
<p>we.</p>
<p>But Gothic also had a dual version which only applied to two people, me and someone else.</p>
<p>So it basically meant, we two, or the two of us.</p>
<p>In Gothic, the dual version was wheat, and the plural version was weis.</p>
<p>Now what we see here is a simplification of the original Indo-European pronouns that was</p>
<p>taking place within the early Germanic languages.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European language had those dual forms as well, but most of the early</p>
<p>Germanic languages were getting rid of the dual versions and only using a singular and</p>
<p>plural version.</p>
<p>But Gothic held on to that Indo-European dual form in first person.</p>
<p>And it also held on to that dual version in third person.</p>
<p>And in third person, we can see how modern English has taken this idea of simplifying</p>
<p>the pronouns even further.</p>
<p>In fact, it may have taken it a little too far, because many modern English speakers</p>
<p>still struggle with that change.</p>
<p>In modern English, we have third person singular, you, and third person plural, you, as in all</p>
<p>of you.</p>
<p>So we use the same word for singular and plural.</p>
<p>And many modern English speakers seem to have an innate sense that this is a little awkward.</p>
<p>So some dialects have a tendency to want to change that plural version to make it distinctive.</p>
<p>So in some English dialects, it becomes you all, or y&rsquo;all, or you-ins, or youse guys,</p>
<p>or some other stereotype.</p>
<p>We sometimes make fun of these regionalisms, but it really represents modern English speakers</p>
<p>trying to make a distinction between singular and plural that was always made in earlier</p>
<p>forms of English and is still made in most other European languages.</p>
<p>Now back to Gothic.</p>
<p>While other Germanic languages, like Old English, were busy simplifying the pronouns by getting</p>
<p>rid of the dual third person pronoun, as I said, Gothic held on to it.</p>
<p>So Gothic had a singular version of you, a dual version, meaning you two, or the two</p>
<p>of you, and a plural version, meaning you all, or all of you.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve looked at some differences between Gothic and Old English, but as you might imagine,</p>
<p>there were also a lot of similarities.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s compare some of the vocabulary of the two languages.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s begin by listening to the basic numbers 1 through 10 in both languages.</p>
<p>In Gothic, the number 1 was eins.</p>
<p>In Old English, it was an.</p>
<p>So between eins and an, you can hear the similarities.</p>
<p>Now the number 2 in Gothic was zwei.</p>
<p>In Old English, it was tweien.</p>
<p>So again, twi, tweien.</p>
<p>You can see the similarities.</p>
<p>The number 3 in Gothic was thris.</p>
<p>In Old English, it was thria.</p>
<p>The number 4 in Gothic was fidwar.</p>
<p>In Old English, it was fewar.</p>
<p>The number 5 in Gothic was finth.</p>
<p>In Old English, it was fif.</p>
<p>The number 6 in Gothic was six.</p>
<p>In Old English, it was six.</p>
<p>The number 7 in Gothic was sieun.</p>
<p>In Old English, it was sievan.</p>
<p>The number 8 in Gothic was achtal.</p>
<p>In Old English, it was ekta.</p>
<p>The number 9 in Gothic was nian.</p>
<p>In Old English, it was nian.</p>
<p>The number 10 in Gothic was tihin.</p>
<p>And in Old English, it was tien.</p>
<p>So as you can hear, the numbers in Gothic and Old English were very similar.</p>
<p>We can also compare Gothic to Old English by listening to portions of their respective</p>
<p>versions of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.</p>
<p>As you may recall from way back in episode 1, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer exists in many ancient</p>
<p>languages, so the various versions of the prayer provides a convenient way to compare</p>
<p>the structure of those early languages.</p>
<p>But we have to keep in mind that even though Gothic and Old English were sister languages,</p>
<p>the attested version of the Gothic prayer predates the Old English version by three</p>
<p>or four centuries.</p>
<p>So the differences between the two versions of the prayer are a combination of dialect</p>
<p>differences and time differences.</p>
<p>And I should also note that I can be somewhat generous in my pronunciation of Gothic because</p>
<p>no one knows for certain how it was pronounced.</p>
<p>Obviously the spelling of the words in the original Gothic alphabet provides strong evidence,</p>
<p>but unlike later languages like Old English, the material that we have in Gothic is much</p>
<p>more limited, so the actual Gothic speakers of the 4th century may well have had some</p>
<p>unique pronunciations or sounds which we can&rsquo;t detect in the written language.</p>
<p>So with that caveat out of the way, let&rsquo;s look at the first line of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.</p>
<p>In Modern English, it&rsquo;s, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.</p>
<p>In Old English, the same passage was, Fad-e-irra duth-e-ert-on-hefen-um, seeth-e-naam-e-yih-hal-gud.</p>
<p>In Gothic, that passage was, Ata-un-sara duth-e-en-heem-en-um, wee-kha-nai-naam-o-thein.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look a little closer at those passages.</p>
<p>In Modern English, we say, Our Father, with the pronoun our before father.</p>
<p>But early Germanic languages reversed that order and put father first, so it was Father</p>
<p>Our.</p>
<p>In Old English, it was Fad-e-irra.</p>
<p>In Gothic, it was Ata-un-sara.</p>
<p>So between irra and un-sara, we can hear the differences between the word our in both of</p>
<p>those languages.</p>
<p>But what about father?</p>
<p>Well, Old English was Fad-e-irra, as we&rsquo;ve seen before.</p>
<p>But the Gothic word was Ata.</p>
<p>By now we know that the original Indo-European word for father had a P sound, represented</p>
<p>in the Latin and Greek forms of the word pater.</p>
<p>And that P switched to an F in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>But for some reason, Gothic had lost that consonant altogether in the word father.</p>
<p>The resulting word was simply Ata.</p>
<p>And a little father in Gothic was Atilla.</p>
<p>And when the Huns invaded the Ostrogoths from the Eurasian steppes, many of the Ostrogoths</p>
<p>fled to the west.</p>
<p>But some of the Ostrogoths joined the Huns as mercenaries.</p>
<p>And the Ostrogoths called the Hunnic leader Little Father, Atilla.</p>
<p>And of course, we know him today as Atilla the Hun.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk more about Atilla and the Huns in the next episode, because their invasion</p>
<p>of Central Europe was one of the primary causes for the mass invasion of Western Europe by</p>
<p>Germanic tribes, which again we&rsquo;ll discuss next time.</p>
<p>Before we move on, let&rsquo;s take a look at a few of the other words in the passage I just</p>
<p>read.</p>
<p>The word heaven in Old English was hephenum.</p>
<p>In Gothic it was hemenum.</p>
<p>And the word name in Old English was nama.</p>
<p>In Gothic it was namo.</p>
<p>So we can definitely see the similarities.</p>
<p>But as we look at the second line of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, the differences between the two versions</p>
<p>become more apparent.</p>
<p>The second line in Modern English is, Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, in earth as</p>
<p>it is in heaven.</p>
<p>In Old English, the passage read, To becometh thine riche, ye wortheth thine</p>
<p>willa, on earth swath swath, on hephenum.</p>
<p>In Gothic, that passage was, Cimae theunasus theins, rarthe weathains,</p>
<p>swae in hemena, jaana ertha.</p>
<p>Now all that may sound completely foreign to you.</p>
<p>And they may not even sound similar.</p>
<p>But if we listen closely, we can detect the similarities.</p>
<p>For example, take the portion that reads, In earth as it is in heaven.</p>
<p>In Old English, earth was erthen.</p>
<p>And roughly speaking, Old English used the Middle English word order for this passage.</p>
<p>So it was, On erthen swath swath, on hephenum.</p>
<p>On earth as it is in heaven.</p>
<p>In Gothic, the word for earth was similar to Old English.</p>
<p>It was erthae.</p>
<p>But Gothic reversed the word order of the passage.</p>
<p>So it read more like, As it is in heaven, it is on earth.</p>
<p>Swae in hemena, jaana erthae.</p>
<p>So I hope you found that interesting.</p>
<p>But as you can probably hear, the original Germanic dialects that evolved from that common</p>
<p>Proto-Germanic language were very similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially that same process that was beginning to happen to Latin at the same time.</p>
<p>As Rome began to falter and fall apart, it began to break into regional entities.</p>
<p>And without a strong central government in Rome, the factors that held Roman Latin in</p>
<p>place were also disappearing.</p>
<p>Now, regional variations of Latin were beginning to take root.</p>
<p>And those dialects would eventually evolve into the modern Romance languages.</p>
<p>But they would also retain some basic similarities.</p>
<p>And the same thing was happening within the Germanic languages as well.</p>
<p>Now before I wrap up this episode, I wanted to explore the ultimate evolution of the word</p>
<p>Gothic, from its original reference to this particular Germanic tribe, to a specific type</p>
<p>of architecture, and now a certain subculture or lifestyle which we call Gothic.</p>
<p>To understand the evolution of the word, we have to begin with the Germanic period that</p>
<p>we looked at in this episode, and that we&rsquo;ll continue to look at in the next episode.</p>
<p>As we now know, there were lots of Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But the Goths had a particularly long history.</p>
<p>Remember that the Goths were attested in written histories for over a thousand years.</p>
<p>And the Goths actually became two separate tribes, the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths.</p>
<p>And when the Roman Empire eventually collapsed in the West, the Germanic tribes rushed in</p>
<p>and filled vacuum, and that included the Goths.</p>
<p>The Ostrogoths, you&rsquo;ll remember, established a kingdom in Italy, and the Visigoths established</p>
<p>a completely separate kingdom in Spain.</p>
<p>But after those two kingdoms eventually collapsed and disappeared, the term Goth basically fell</p>
<p>out of use.</p>
<p>And when it was used, it was used to refer to these specific Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And during the following centuries, Christianity spread throughout Europe.</p>
<p>And during the 11th and 12th century, a new style of fancy, ornate architecture developed.</p>
<p>It was primarily used for churches and cathedrals, and it featured pointed arches and flying</p>
<p>buttresses, large stained glass windows, and so on.</p>
<p>Think about the Notre Dame in Paris.</p>
<p>And this architectural style was meant to impress and overwhelm worshippers.</p>
<p>And this style of architecture spread to castles and other buildings during the medieval period.</p>
<p>But in medieval Europe, this particular style of architecture wasn&rsquo;t called Gothic.</p>
<p>The architectural style had developed in France, so it was called French work.</p>
<p>Now even though the Western Roman Empire had collapsed and given way to various Germanic</p>
<p>kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire had continued on as the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople</p>
<p>in Western Turkey.</p>
<p>But in 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>And that led to the disbursement of Greek scholars in Constantinople throughout Western</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>And they brought with them manuscripts which had been written in ancient Greek and which</p>
<p>were previously unknown in the West.</p>
<p>And that discovery of this pre-Christian Greek and Roman culture caused an intellectual and</p>
<p>cultural revolution in the West, which was called the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Suddenly, everything associated with classical Greece and Rome was fashionable.</p>
<p>And everything associated with the period after the fall of the Western Roman Empire</p>
<p>was considered crude, uncultured, and uncivilized.</p>
<p>And that included architecture.</p>
<p>Greco-Roman architecture was the way to go.</p>
<p>Large white columns, arches, and domes.</p>
<p>And this reflected the Greek emphasis on geometry and proportions.</p>
<p>And all of those older medieval castles and cathedrals were considered old-fashioned and</p>
<p>part of a darker age.</p>
<p>And this is where we start to get the terms like dark ages and middle ages.</p>
<p>There was that wonderful Greco-Roman period.</p>
<p>And there was this modern Renaissance.</p>
<p>And then there was all that barbaric stuff in the middle.</p>
<p>That dark period.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of hard to believe that all those beautiful cathedrals were now considered</p>
<p>barbaric and primitive.</p>
<p>But they were.</p>
<p>Because they weren&rsquo;t Greco-Roman.</p>
<p>And you can see why some modern historians are still reluctant to use the term dark ages.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, that&rsquo;s what they were considered at the time.</p>
<p>Well, since the Goths were such a prominent Germanic tribe during the later Roman period</p>
<p>and the period after the fall of Rome, some people during the Renaissance began to use</p>
<p>the term Gothic to refer to certain things associated with this middle period.</p>
<p>The period before the Renaissance.</p>
<p>This supposedly darker, primitive, uncivilized period.</p>
<p>And all of those beautiful castles and cathedrals began to be called Gothic.</p>
<p>Because they were built during that earlier period.</p>
<p>We can now skip forward a couple of centuries to the 18th and 19th centuries when a new</p>
<p>style of literature began to appear.</p>
<p>These novels and stories were often set in dark Gothic castles and cathedrals.</p>
<p>They typically involved dark or eerie themes.</p>
<p>They relied on suspense and often featured supernatural elements.</p>
<p>But it was the setting of the stories which was really the key.</p>
<p>Castles, cathedrals, dungeons, dark corridors, winding stairs, darkness, moonlight, candlelight.</p>
<p>And because of the darkness of the literature and its association with Gothic castles and</p>
<p>cathedrals, it came to be called Gothic literature.</p>
<p>This included the writings of Horace Walpole, Edgar Allan Poe, and even the Brothers Grimm.</p>
<p>And it also included works like Mary Shelley&rsquo;s Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson&rsquo;s The</p>
<p>Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Gaston Leroux&rsquo;s The Phantom of the Opera,</p>
<p>and Victor Hugo&rsquo;s The Hunchback of Notre Dame.</p>
<p>It also included Bram Stoker&rsquo;s Dracula.</p>
<p>And that novel was particularly influential.</p>
<p>Of course it featured a vampire who lived in Transylvania, which as we know from earlier</p>
<p>in this episode was once called Dacia and had been the home of the original Visigoths.</p>
<p>And of course Dracula was famously portrayed in the motion picture by Bela Lugosi from</p>
<p>Hungary, the same general region of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>So we now have the use of the term Gothic to describe this particular type of literature,</p>
<p>primarily because of its dark, gloomy Gothic settings.</p>
<p>But the term now came to refer to the actual subject matter of those novels as well.</p>
<p>So it came to refer to vampires, monsters, ghouls, and other creepy characters.</p>
<p>And that takes us to the 20th century, specifically the year 1979.</p>
<p>In that year, a band called Bauhaus released a song called Bela Lugosi&rsquo;s Dead.</p>
<p>This is considered one of the first and arguably the very first example of a musical style</p>
<p>called Gothic.</p>
<p>It was dark and creepy, kind of like those Gothic novels and movies.</p>
<p>And soon music critics were using that term to refer to bands like Joy Division and The</p>
<p>Cure who were also producing music in that style.</p>
<p>And thanks to the popularity of those Gothic bands, at least the underground popularity</p>
<p>of those bands, it sparked a whole new generation of Goths who listened to the music and dressed</p>
<p>in black and wore makeup to make themselves look like characters out of Gothic novels.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how we got from the ancient Germanic Goths to the modern Goths.</p>
<p>So with the modern part of the Gothic story out of the way, next time we&rsquo;ll finish looking</p>
<p>at the ancient Goths.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at the Angles and Saxons as well, because next time I&rsquo;m going to focus</p>
<p>on the fall of Rome and the establishment of Germanic kingdoms in Western Europe.</p>
<p>And of course, one of those kingdoms was in Britain.</p>
<p>So the next episode may very well be the final episode in our look at the development of</p>
<p>pre-English.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll be able to begin Volume 2, Old English.</p>
<p>So until then, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
