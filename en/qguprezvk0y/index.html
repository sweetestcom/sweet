<p>Ôªøtoday I&rsquo;m going to talk about a very
important topic and that is your own</p>
<p>immune system you may not realize this
but your immune system is the most</p>
<p>kick-ass military that ever was to help
you understand the immune system we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna compare it to the US military and
to do that I&rsquo;m actually gonna bring on a</p>
<p>guest and his name is commander Dave
Overcash he&rsquo;s been in the US Navy for 27</p>
<p>years he&rsquo;s retired now his 27 years of
service included over 300 landings on</p>
<p>aircraft carriers five deployments to
the Middle East</p>
<p>overseas tours in Hawaii Japan and South
Korea and serviced at the Pentagon Dave</p>
<p>thanks for coming on thank you dr. Berg
it&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here I look</p>
<p>forward to our discussion so what I&rsquo;m
gonna do is I&rsquo;m gonna try to make this</p>
<p>as simple as possible it&rsquo;s difficult
because it&rsquo;s a complex subject but let</p>
<p>me just attempt to do that
what is the immune system the immune</p>
<p>system is your defense system
it&rsquo;s your military it&rsquo;s there to protect</p>
<p>you you have various barriers you have
your skin the outside and you also have</p>
<p>the barrier of your internal skin in
fact the internal skin of your body is</p>
<p>quite large in fact it covers 400 square
meters that&rsquo;s the size of two tennis</p>
<p>courts so it&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of
surface area and you have billions of</p>
<p>immune cells just beneath the surface
guarding that wall waiting for an</p>
<p>invader or a pathogen viruses bacteria
so that would be a front line of defense</p>
<p>so Dave give me a comparison of that to
what the military has the formal</p>
<p>military term for that would be the four
line of troops or the forward edge of</p>
<p>the battle space there&rsquo;s gonna be highly
trained but not necessarily you know</p>
<p>very specialized troops but very large
numbers of them in mechanized units I</p>
<p>might be a term some of your folks would
be familiar with but you&rsquo;re those are</p>
<p>your general troops that are gonna be
right up along the front that are gonna</p>
<p>be able to detect any movement
in your adversaries and be able to be</p>
<p>the first line of defense against
whatever comes against them so this</p>
<p>would also compare to something you
would see at the airport you have metal</p>
<p>detectors you have all sorts of
screening devices to weed out those bad</p>
<p>actors or people that potentially could
carry a bomb on a plane when I was in</p>
<p>practice that I would do seminars in
governmental agencies so I bought online</p>
<p>these those little credit card knifes
right as a box cutter I thought they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really cool they actually fold up the
credit card so uh you know where this is</p>
<p>going I basically bought one put in my
wall and I forgot about it and I</p>
<p>actually somehow took a flight and that
wasn&rsquo;t even detected but then the next</p>
<p>week it was in my wallet I went to do
one of my seminars had the governmental</p>
<p>agency in DC and so as I went through
security</p>
<p>I just remembered as he was going in
that I had that in my wallet and my</p>
<p>heart started to pound and all of a
sudden but the little red light went off</p>
<p>they opened up the wallet and found this
credit card knife and they called I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what code code red or
something they call people to shut down</p>
<p>the entire building and they pointed to
me</p>
<p>and they put me on the wall put me in
handcuffs and I said no no no you can</p>
<p>have it you can write so they took me to
a room to wait for the FBI to come they</p>
<p>wanted to check me out just to make sure
so I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m just here to do a</p>
<p>seminar what&rsquo;s happening and I mean
unfortunately there&rsquo;s a huge line of</p>
<p>people and they&rsquo;re like they couldn&rsquo;t
leave they couldn&rsquo;t get in everything</p>
<p>was frozen so I had to wait for some
hours and so I&rsquo;m sitting there handcuffs</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s two military people guarded
to sit there just guarding me and it was</p>
<p>apparently a room that they had some
food in it and there was a cake and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about nutrition and I I
just couldn&rsquo;t help myself</p>
<p>to speak up it just wasn&rsquo;t the best time
to talk about you know car bhai</p>
<p>so I kind of quickly so then the middle
of the FBI came and they just they said</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your intent I said I just thought
it was cool and I got in so they go yeah</p>
<p>this is kind of cool
and so they escorted me to the car and</p>
<p>everyone was watching and I had to
secure this weapon in the car so I can</p>
<p>go back and do my seminar presentation
so this is another example how the</p>
<p>immune system would work it&rsquo;s constantly
scanning for pathogens things that are</p>
<p>not itself and a very important part of
immune system is to differentiate</p>
<p>between the good guys and the bad guys
so the main players on the front line of</p>
<p>defense are the phagocytes okay these
are cells that eat bacteria and viruses</p>
<p>and the top professional phagocyte is
called a macrophage macrophage means big</p>
<p>cell that eats it&rsquo;s pretty much acts as
a garbage disposal it eats up debris but</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s an invader that macrophage
will go in there and take it down and if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of invaders it will hold
the fort while it recruits back up so</p>
<p>this part of the immune system is called
the innate which is part of the immune</p>
<p>system that doesn&rsquo;t need to Train any
specialists you&rsquo;re pretty much born with</p>
<p>this these are general soldiers that
have a nonspecific defense mechanism so</p>
<p>they can handle little stuff but when
things get too crazy your body recruits</p>
<p>more specialists from this system right
here this is called the adaptive immune</p>
<p>system or the acquired so then we have
the neutrophil now when you get an</p>
<p>infection and you have mucus and pus 70%
of that is made out of neutrophils</p>
<p>okay so neutrophils have three weapons
they can eat microbes but they also</p>
<p>control chemicals as well as a net over
the microbes and so the chemicals of the</p>
<p>use are hydrogen peroxide the active
ingredient in Bleach so they use bleach</p>
<p>to kill these microbes as after they
pulled them in what&rsquo;s interesting in the</p>
<p>military is there are certain types of
chemical warfare that they use so Dave</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you give us a comparison on
yeah there sure is there&rsquo;s chemical and</p>
<p>biological weapons that they&rsquo;re very
effective and neutralizing an adversary</p>
<p>everything related to a chemical kind of
attack slows you down and has a an</p>
<p>inordinate impact on you compared to
normal conventional weapons I remember</p>
<p>when I went to basic training that was
in 1983 I was in the military the army</p>
<p>reserved for five years I was a medic we
had to go through this gas chamber and</p>
<p>of course they did not give us really
toxic chemicals but they exposed us to</p>
<p>tear gas and that was a major thing for
a lot of people including myself I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even imagine being exposed to something
even stronger than that because that was</p>
<p>pretty strong so the neutrophil will
also throw a net like spider-man on the</p>
<p>pathogen with chemicals to dissolve it
you know your your example they&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of like wrapping up and then adding
chemicals what it reminds me of is is</p>
<p>indirect fires that are used in the
military where a let&rsquo;s say some troops</p>
<p>are on the ground and they need to call
in artillery support or close air</p>
<p>support what they might do is term that
that&rsquo;s used as maybe is bracketing you</p>
<p>know they&rsquo;ll call in a fire and they&rsquo;ll
see where that bomb lands they&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>where that show lands and then they&rsquo;ll
adjust that fire and then when they get</p>
<p>it on to exactly where they want it
they&rsquo;re gonna ask for maximum effect of</p>
<p>the available indirect fires and and
then yeah they&rsquo;ll be able to take out</p>
<p>the adversary that way so we have the
macrophage the neutrophil these are both</p>
<p>phagocytes then we have something over
here called the natural killer cell so</p>
<p>one of the things that this cell does is
it releases something called interferon</p>
<p>interferon comes from the word interfere
because the function of interferon</p>
<p>interferes with viral reproduction so it
stops the production of viruses which is</p>
<p>the virus weapon so it slows down the
production of the enemy the leadership</p>
<p>of the
and military realized we have to destroy</p>
<p>their means of replicating their
capabilities and so the United States</p>
<p>ate their force in World War two based
in England went after the entire German</p>
<p>industrial military-industrial complex
they bombed every factory you could</p>
<p>possibly imagine
destroying plants that produce tanks</p>
<p>plants have produced artillery pieces
the plants have produced ball bearings</p>
<p>anything that would produce a mechanized
piece of equipment so the idea was wow</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t get rid of these folks fast
enough for this equipment fast enough so</p>
<p>if we can prevent them from producing
any more at least there&rsquo;s a finite</p>
<p>number of things that we have to destroy
instead of an infinite all right we just</p>
<p>talked about the innate immune system
now let&rsquo;s talk about the adaptive immune</p>
<p>system now the adaptive immune system is
acquired in other words it learns from</p>
<p>experience in order for that part of the
immune system to work correctly you need</p>
<p>to expose it to a pathogen or a germ so
if someone lives in a sterilized</p>
<p>environment they never develop their
immune system so it&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>important understand that your immune
system grows and becomes stronger</p>
<p>through training going through an
infection overcoming it and now having</p>
<p>that memory of it so it&rsquo;s ready for the
next time Dave give me an example how</p>
<p>important training is in the military
you know our operations manuals people</p>
<p>say are written in blood right so all
the mistakes that previous folks used</p>
<p>and either died or or crashed aircraft
the lessons learned from those things</p>
<p>are then written in your operations
manual so you don&rsquo;t make that same</p>
<p>mistake twice
there&rsquo;s a lot of potential for problems</p>
<p>there and they came to pass in the
Vietnam War there were three major</p>
<p>aircraft carrier fires hundreds of men
were killed in fires that start that on</p>
<p>those aircraft carriers they had a very
difficult</p>
<p>and stopping the fires once they began
because of all those things that are on</p>
<p>the flight deck not everyone on the
aircraft carrier was trained at the time</p>
<p>to fight fires and so they instituted a
program where every single person that</p>
<p>goes on to a ship any ship has to go
through significant firefighting</p>
<p>experience because they found that the
initial wave of firefighters were killed</p>
<p>in trying to fight these fires and then
there wasn&rsquo;t anybody trained to really</p>
<p>take out those fires once they began so
yeah if you don&rsquo;t train you are damned</p>
<p>to continue having similar accidents
over time so this part of the museum are</p>
<p>more specialists they&rsquo;re like the
Special Forces they actually have very</p>
<p>specific actions that they are assigned
to these guys are more general these</p>
<p>guys are more targeted</p>
<p>give us some examples of the different
units or special forces that you have in</p>
<p>the military a lot of times we can&rsquo;t
match the pure numbers that maybe the</p>
<p>adversary that we go against has but we
need to have better training and so we</p>
<p>have a lot of Special Forces or Special
Operations Forces in the military the</p>
<p>Navy SEALs Delta Force you know what we
found is that like I think I can think</p>
<p>of a couple examples we what we found
that even if our adversary say purchases</p>
<p>a very excellent piece of equipment we
could beat that adversary with a lesser</p>
<p>capability if we have trained harder mmm
and and that&rsquo;s why maybe we might not be</p>
<p>so afraid of a North Korean pilot with a
great piece of equipment because he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t train very much
because their economy so poor they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the resources to be able to train a
lot and so he may be up there and a</p>
<p>great piece of equipment but he really
doesn&rsquo;t know how to operate it he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>proficient at ador or even say the
Iranian Navy purchases a Russian</p>
<p>submarine that&rsquo;s not the same as a
Russian submarine crew highly trained</p>
<p>operating a Russian piece of equipment
the Iranians are gonna be as good at it</p>
<p>so we found that that training that
exposure the more realistic the training</p>
<p>the better one one more example I give
you is that in the Marines when they</p>
<p>have target practice they don&rsquo;t use
automated targets they actually have</p>
<p>their the Marines will go behind a dirt
berm and I believe they still do this</p>
<p>and pull the targets up and down so that
they can hear the bullets going overhead</p>
<p>while the other Marines are conducting
target practice that acclimates them</p>
<p>were to an environment where they might
be in battle which makes them more</p>
<p>likely to be able to succeed when they
are in that kind of environment so these</p>
<p>specialized immune cells they&rsquo;re called
t-cells</p>
<p>stands for thymus basically get their
training in the thymus gland which is</p>
<p>not the thyroid sounds similar and it&rsquo;s
actually located lower than the thyroid</p>
<p>so the thyroids here thymus is right
above the heart and what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>is only 30% of those t-cells make it
through this training the rest die off</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re very selective and when
you&rsquo;re born you have this huge thymus as</p>
<p>you get older it starts shrinking and
shrinking and shrinking and stress will</p>
<p>shrink it a vitamin D deficiency will
cause a shrinkage of the thymus gland so</p>
<p>nutrition is very very important keeping
your thymus very strong in reality these</p>
<p>pathogens target different weaknesses
within your immune system so if you have</p>
<p>a very strong immune system even though
it might not be very large it could</p>
<p>handle a huge invasion of viruses or
pathogens we have a lot of special</p>
<p>forces or special operations forces in
the military some examples would be the</p>
<p>Navy SEALs maybe Green Berets Delta
Force US Army Rangers the Air Force has</p>
<p>a group called the pair rescue men or
PJs there&rsquo;s a pride the most well-known</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re the most highly trained the
the most specialized forces that we have</p>
<p>for very specific target sets one point
I want to make is this when someone gets</p>
<p>an infection they have a cough or runny
nose a fever some type of indicator that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a battle going on within your
body the worst thing to do is to stop</p>
<p>that infection to suppress those
symptoms because what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re stopping the training of your
t-cells you&rsquo;re cutting it short and when</p>
<p>you try to suppress the immune system
the duration of infection goes longer</p>
<p>and longer so they have to work harder
and harder so it&rsquo;s very very important</p>
<p>to enhance the immune system with diet
nutrition keeping your stress low than</p>
<p>it is to quickly try to shut down those
symptoms all right so we talked about</p>
<p>the three players under the innate
there&rsquo;s actually four main players</p>
<p>within the adaptive immune system first
one is the killer t-cell</p>
<p>now what these guys do is they have a
chemical called perform which punches a</p>
<p>hole through the cell and then they
release a chemical that causes the cell</p>
<p>to commit suicide for the greater good
of the body so these cells that die for</p>
<p>the greater good to kill out that virus
are are considered like hero cells Ujima</p>
<p>where there were a lot of Marines that
would jump on grenades that that landed</p>
<p>near them and they&rsquo;re their buddies and
they wanted to protect their friends and</p>
<p>a lot of examples also with with folks
that are in the Medal of Honor which is</p>
<p>the highest medal of valor that&rsquo;s
awarded in the military where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wounded they believe that but they&rsquo;re
not going to make it and so they would</p>
<p>do something that was extraordinary or
out of the ordinary where they would go</p>
<p>off by themselves to create some kind of
a diversion that would allow the troops</p>
<p>a left behind to exploit you know the
weakness that was made by that movement</p>
<p>but they knew that they were gonna die
alright the next player is the T helper</p>
<p>cell so this cell is a very important
self there&rsquo;s the main coordinator for</p>
<p>the entire battle going on so it&rsquo;s going
to recruit backup it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>determine what players are involved what
part of your military is gonna be used</p>
<p>at what volume what types of weapon tree
Dave give me an example of what you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have in the military that compares to
that oh absolutely that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>commander at any level give some general
direction about how he wants it done and</p>
<p>how often those things are going to
happen you have to have somebody at the</p>
<p>top that&rsquo;s directing the overall
movement and kind of sees the big</p>
<p>picture now one thing I want to mention
about the tea house</p>
<p>CEL is that viruses have strategies to
invade and take over the body and our</p>
<p>body has strategy is to kind of go back
and forth so we have this battle back</p>
<p>and forth and if we take the HIV virus
its strategy is to take down the T</p>
<p>helper cell if it succeeds in doing that
because your immune system is weak the</p>
<p>entire immune system won&rsquo;t be able to
work and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called in</p>
<p>immunodeficiency disease</p>
<p>so viruses are very intelligent they&rsquo;re
gonna take down like the key player</p>
<p>involved in this battle
now they&rsquo;ve give me an example of</p>
<p>something in the military that is
somewhat similar an individual at the</p>
<p>top is as the center of gravity the
desert storm it was Saddam Hussein or</p>
<p>Iraqi Freedom Saddam Hussein and even
when we attacked Afghanistan Osama bin</p>
<p>Laden so we&rsquo;re constantly going after
the head and believing that if we take</p>
<p>out the head of the organization then
the rest of the body or the rest of the</p>
<p>country will fall into disarray and it
will there will be a better use of our</p>
<p>resources and make it easier for us to
go in and the key to all of it is being</p>
<p>undetected because once an adversary
knows what you&rsquo;re trying to do they can</p>
<p>build up their defenses and they can
counter whatever it is that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to do I have a couple examples of
some really damaging spies that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had over our time one her name was Ana
Montes she was a spy for Cuba and the</p>
<p>Defense Intelligence Agency we we found
that she did some amazing damage by her</p>
<p>time you know right in the middle of all
the greatest intelligence that we had</p>
<p>about Cuba during the Cold War and then
another one being Aldrich Ames who was a</p>
<p>KGB spy in the CIA for longest time we
had no idea and he was he did some</p>
<p>extremely the damage from his passing of
information that he was able to get</p>
<p>undetected was was really significant
now one strategy that these viruses have</p>
<p>is they have the ability to go inside
the cell and turn off your vitamin D</p>
<p>receptor this means that you can&rsquo;t
absorb any more vitamin D apparently</p>
<p>they know the vitamin D is crucial for
your immune system it is involved in</p>
<p>every single level and if you don&rsquo;t have
enough vitamin D</p>
<p>then you can&rsquo;t turn off these huge
what&rsquo;s called cytokine storms which is</p>
<p>an inflammatory condition that&rsquo;s out of
control</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an overactive immune system and
that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s killing people in</p>
<p>this Cove in 1917 system and the enemy
the virus and what their strategies are</p>
<p>so you can actually overcome it so since
we&rsquo;re talking a little bit about</p>
<p>strategy there has been a person in
history sunsoo that was a military</p>
<p>strategist and he wrote a book called
the art of war and I happened to find a</p>
<p>book that was translated from original
Mandarin Chinese this guy who was in the</p>
<p>Vietnam War got very interested in this
book he spent six years learning</p>
<p>Mandarin Chinese and then translated
word-for-word the entire text the</p>
<p>original translation of the title of Sun
Tzu&rsquo;s book based on the author&rsquo;s</p>
<p>research was not the art of war it was
the technology of war which is very</p>
<p>different technology means more of an
exact science of how to do something</p>
<p>versus art implies adding your own
creativity I want to give you just one</p>
<p>quote says this following this reasoning
supreme skill is not 100 victories in</p>
<p>100 battles supreme skill is subduing
the enemy&rsquo;s operations and its forces</p>
<p>without battle so if we take a look at
that quote and compare it to the battle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on between your immune
system and a virus how would we subdue</p>
<p>the virus&rsquo;s operation well with the COVID-19 we know that that virus pretty much</p>
<p>only attacks someone with a weakened
immune system so the obvious strategy</p>
<p>would necessarily only be to avoid the
virus forever it would be also to</p>
<p>strengthen the immune system because
that virus really can&rsquo;t do anything up</p>
<p>against a really strong immune system
all right so let&rsquo;s talk about the next</p>
<p>player the B cells B cells make
antibodies so antibodies are created</p>
<p>from an infection so in other words this
is where your immune system learn</p>
<p>from being exposed to a very specific
pathogen so soon as it gets exposed and</p>
<p>you go through the infection
can you recover the next time that</p>
<p>specific microbe invade your body your
immune system is ready it will</p>
<p>neutralize that infection so you have
immunity you&rsquo;re not gonna have this</p>
<p>massive reaction anymore
and one way that the antibodies do this</p>
<p>is they lock on to a pathogen it&rsquo;s like
handcuffs and they keep it from going</p>
<p>into the cell so it dries out and it
dies another way that it does it is it</p>
<p>tags the pathogen they assist in the
killing by identifying who are the bad</p>
<p>guys so then the killer T cells come in
there and do the dirty work</p>
<p>so Dave give me an example of something
in the military that&rsquo;s equivalent to</p>
<p>that couple examples working as a team
with other capabilities is really</p>
<p>critical to your effectiveness so one
would be a sniper and the scout or the</p>
<p>spotter that&rsquo;s with him or her so you
have one individual who&rsquo;s finding</p>
<p>targets and passing the information or
where the targets are to the person who</p>
<p>has the skill to actually shoot the
weapon so that&rsquo;s a man that is a very</p>
<p>effective team the scout and the sniper
working together another one to be I</p>
<p>think a naval aviation in the Cold War
one aircraft might fly out that has a</p>
<p>great sensor suite so they can soak up
electronic signals while they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to find an adversary ship or something
like that but that aircraft isn&rsquo;t going</p>
<p>to have the weapons that would be needed
to take out the actual ship so one</p>
<p>aircraft has the sensors the other one
has the weapons and once the first one</p>
<p>finds the adversary then the other one
is tasked with eliminating that</p>
<p>adversary all right so the last player
and the adaptive immune system is called</p>
<p>the T regulatory cell now this cell is
also called the T suppressor cell and</p>
<p>one of the functions of this cell is to
differentiate between the bad guys and</p>
<p>the good guys
so this is very very very important</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s there to prevent autoimmune
diseases and if this cell doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>correctly your body will start to
develop antibodies against its own</p>
<p>tissue and that could be to any tissue
so you can have ms lupus Hashimoto&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis where you have
these antibodies that are attacking</p>
<p>itself autoimmune conditions is very
similar to friendly-fire in the military</p>
<p>Dave can you give us a little example of
what could happen in military if you</p>
<p>have a role player or a traitor we are
very concerned about those interlopers</p>
<p>or those rogue agents well the military
has a lot of things in place to find try</p>
<p>to find spies that kind of rogue element
can do extreme damage to an entire</p>
<p>country its highest its greatest secrets
on same thing even on that carrier</p>
<p>strike group example one adversary
aircraft it&rsquo;s kind of hiding in a strike</p>
<p>force returning to the carrier could
wipe out a carrier whether its defenses</p>
<p>are down so it&rsquo;s a critical to find
who&rsquo;s or to be able to identify who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>friendly and who&rsquo;s not now another very
important thing about the t-regulatory</p>
<p>cells is it has a suppressive action it
calms down the immune system it puts out</p>
<p>the fire when you have this hyper
inflammatory response it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>cytokine storm so really what kills
people in certain infections is not</p>
<p>necessarily the viral entity it&rsquo;s these
killer cells over here and this cell</p>
<p>because the regulatory cell is deficient
we don&rsquo;t have this water hose to put out</p>
<p>the fire so that pretty much completes
all the different players in the immune</p>
<p>system Dave do you have anything else
you want to add to this there&rsquo;s a saying</p>
<p>that George General George Patton in
World War two had and he said that</p>
<p>planning is everything and plans are
nothing hmm in other words you can come</p>
<p>up with a plan to fight a battle but it
everything is going to change after the</p>
<p>first shot is fired but the importance
learning about your adversary</p>
<p>understanding yourself is absolutely
everything you can identify how to</p>
<p>prepare you can identify your own
weaknesses you can identify your</p>
<p>adversaries weaknesses and your own
strengths and their strengths so you</p>
<p>know where to attack you know where to
fortify your own weaknesses that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everything that will help you be
prepared to fight an adversary and our</p>
<p>military is doing that all the time
against all our adversaries and I would</p>
<p>think that you would probably say that&rsquo;s
exactly what your audience needs to be</p>
<p>doing and what we need to be doing ok I
just want to say thank you so much for</p>
<p>your service and also for helping me in
this presentation and I also want to</p>
<p>mention to you watching you have in your
body right now the most amazing kick-ass</p>
<p>military immune system that ever existed
and all you have to do is feed it the</p>
<p>right foods take care of it take the
vitamin D the vitamin C the zinc and</p>
<p>it will return the favor by protecting
you</p>
<p>hey we&rsquo;re back with another amazing recipe no</p>
<p>grains no sugar
totally keto</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no suffering on keto absolutely
not Karen and it&rsquo;s an immune system</p>
<p>builder absolutely you have to check this out
I think you should hurry up watch the</p>
<p>recipe and make it yourself it&rsquo;s just so
easy to be keto</p>
<p>but is it simple it&rsquo;s super simple we hope
you enjoy making it as much as we are</p>
<p>enjoying eating it</p>
