<p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Attentum.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>The guest we&rsquo;re gonna have on today</p>
<p>is talking about a subject that is near and dear to my heart.</p>
<p>I first fell in love with what I would&rsquo;ve called</p>
<p>Persian civilization as a teenager,</p>
<p>um, by studying ancient history.</p>
<p>And the Persians are in one of their&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, perhaps their greatest period,</p>
<p>it depends on how you define greatest,</p>
<p>but perhaps the greatest period in their history.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve had many.</p>
<p>And of course, the, um, long-time antagonist</p>
<p>in the ancient world of the Greeks,</p>
<p>and so you get caught up in the romance</p>
<p>and the fascinating involvement</p>
<p>the Persians had in the region.</p>
<p>Then you start studying how often</p>
<p>they have that involvement, and you begin to understand</p>
<p>that this is a traditional regional superpower.</p>
<p>And then, right when I&rsquo;m really getting</p>
<p>heavily into my interest in Persia,</p>
<p>uh, the situation with the modern nation of Iran</p>
<p>takes a 180-degree turn.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, Iran was a nation friendly</p>
<p>to the United States, in fact, one of our best friends.</p>
<p>The shift to a fundamentalist, religion-backed revolution,</p>
<p>where the United States was the great Satan,</p>
<p>was an unbelievable turn of events.</p>
<p>Not just for the United States,</p>
<p>but for the entire world stage,</p>
<p>in terms of what it did to things.</p>
<p>And many people have been born since</p>
<p>without any memory of a friendly Iran at all.</p>
<p>John Gosvinian is going to talk to us today,</p>
<p>well, basically about anything I ask him about.</p>
<p>So, the deficiencies in the conversation</p>
<p>are yours truly not asking more questions</p>
<p>about more things. I remember looking at the clock</p>
<p>and thinking, wow, I&rsquo;ve kept this historian here</p>
<p>a long time. I don&rsquo;t want to keep him all day,</p>
<p>but boy, I never even got to X, Y, and Z,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s my fault.</p>
<p>And I do owe, uh, John Gosvinian and you</p>
<p>all an apology for the way this sounds.</p>
<p>Um, you know, we have several methods</p>
<p>for doing interviews, remote interviews.</p>
<p>They all sound great some of the time,</p>
<p>and then let you down other times,</p>
<p>so, uh, we&rsquo;ll try something different next time.</p>
<p>So, my apologies to everyone involved.</p>
<p>Uh, any mistakes are purely my own,</p>
<p>or, you know, imaginary creatures</p>
<p>who shall be unnamed. I&rsquo;ll share the, um,</p>
<p>the blame, maybe.</p>
<p>In any case, without further ado,</p>
<p>the fabulously interesting John Gosvinian</p>
<p>talking about the American and Iranian relationship,</p>
<p>and, you know, some history. And, um,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know Iranian history, by the way,</p>
<p>or you want to understand better</p>
<p>the traditional place of Iran in the region,</p>
<p>well, this is the tinny-sounding interview</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>-‚ô™ BELL RINGS ‚ô™</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hello, Dr. Gosvinian, it&rsquo;s Dan. Can you hear me?</p>
<p>Yes, hello.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with perceptions here,</p>
<p>because I grew up in an era, um, where,</p>
<p>I mean, I was 15 in 1980, and I was politically aware.</p>
<p>And so, growing up, Iran was a country</p>
<p>that the United States was really friendly with.</p>
<p>And so, unlike a lot of Americans born after that time period</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve only seen Iran in sort of an adversarial sort of sense,</p>
<p>I remember the country as one of our greatest friends</p>
<p>in the world, maybe our greatest friend,</p>
<p>arguably our greatest friend</p>
<p>in that important region of the world.</p>
<p>When you go out there today and you want to talk to people</p>
<p>about a book that talks about Iran,</p>
<p>what kind of sort of feedback are you getting</p>
<p>from the countries, um, that were on the opposite side</p>
<p>of things like, you know, the hostage-taking in 1980</p>
<p>and all that? Have attitudes sort of changed or evolved,</p>
<p>or, I mean, what are you hearing back from, uh,</p>
<p>from feedback, I guess, is what I want to know.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, you&rsquo;re absolutely right</p>
<p>when you say that the 1970s, in many ways,</p>
<p>were a sort of heyday of U.S.-Iran relations.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, the United States, or rather, excuse me,</p>
<p>Iran was portrayed very positively in the United States.</p>
<p>It was a time when Iran was seen as this kind of,</p>
<p>uh, glamorous, uh, uh, kingdom to the east</p>
<p>of everything that was threatening.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, this was a time when,</p>
<p>when the Americans thought of the Middle East,</p>
<p>they thought of, you know, the Arab-Israeli conflict,</p>
<p>the Arab oil embargo, uh, socialist governments</p>
<p>in various Arab states, the Cold War.</p>
<p>It was not a very positive impression,</p>
<p>but when they looked at Iran, they saw a country</p>
<p>that was just slightly to the east of all of that,</p>
<p>that it was, um, you know, had a friendly,</p>
<p>pro-American king, uh, who, you know,</p>
<p>had this, uh, sort of beautiful, glamorous wife,</p>
<p>and had this very, uh, uh, fancy coronation ceremony</p>
<p>in 1971 that was broadcast live by satellite</p>
<p>into American television, you know.</p>
<p>So it was a, it was a very positive impression,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very easy to forget that now,</p>
<p>because not that many people of these days</p>
<p>do remember, uh, that period anymore.</p>
<p>Um, you know, at the same time, though,</p>
<p>that, you know, that was a state-to-state relationship</p>
<p>that was very positive, uh, but there was a, a, a huge current</p>
<p>of, uh, underground resentment that was building</p>
<p>against the Shah, the king of Iran, uh, and, you know,</p>
<p>he was so closely associated with the United States</p>
<p>and the minds of his people, and he had become</p>
<p>extremely unpopular, uh, so, of course,</p>
<p>that backlash, uh, reflected on the United States, uh, as well.</p>
<p>But to answer your question about the kind of reception</p>
<p>and feedback I&rsquo;m getting from the book,</p>
<p>I mean, I think people are, uh, surprised to learn</p>
<p>that our history with Iran goes back as far as it does.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a tendency to look at the last 40 years</p>
<p>of antagonism, uh, to focus on kind of where it all went wrong,</p>
<p>whose fault it is, uh, and I was trying to do something</p>
<p>different with the book, which is to say that, you know,</p>
<p>history is not about laying blame or looking for who started it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a courtroom. Uh, it&rsquo;s about understanding</p>
<p>kind of how we got to where we are,</p>
<p>and the overwhelming majority of Iran in America&rsquo;s 200,</p>
<p>300-year history has been one of mutual admiration,</p>
<p>mutual fascination, mutual idealization,</p>
<p>and a very friendly history for a lot of its, uh,</p>
<p>a lot of its time.</p>
<p>I would argue that it&rsquo;s actually the timing on the book</p>
<p>seems fortuitous to me, because I think that, um,</p>
<p>it seems to me ripe for, in the near future,</p>
<p>some sort of breakthrough, I would say.</p>
<p>And one of the things that&rsquo;s so different,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure you can speak to this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to go back in some sort of linear order</p>
<p>at a certain point, but now you&rsquo;ve got me talking about,</p>
<p>uh, Iranian, um, sometimes they refer to themselves</p>
<p>as Persian expatriate communities in the United States</p>
<p>that played a similar role in terms of coming to this country</p>
<p>after the revolution, that the Vietnamese,</p>
<p>who were our friends in South Vietnam,</p>
<p>who fled South Vietnam and became a part of communities</p>
<p>that have grown up since then in the United States.</p>
<p>I knew quite a bit of Persians who were fleeing</p>
<p>the revolution growing up, Iranians.</p>
<p>Um, and it was one of those things where I remember thinking,</p>
<p>God, in so many ways, they have a lot of similarities</p>
<p>with Americans. They&rsquo;re a fun-loving people,</p>
<p>they like to dance, they&rsquo;re a mercantile people.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all these little stereotypical adjectives</p>
<p>you could use to describe the Iranians,</p>
<p>which, when you think about it and you realize,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re kind of natural friends in a way.</p>
<p>And the period of time that we&rsquo;re in right now</p>
<p>seems like 15, 20 years from now,</p>
<p>we could look back on as a weird anomaly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that history, though, that you refer to.</p>
<p>I mean, in Western eyes, Iran was Persia, right?</p>
<p>All the way back to Herodotus and all that.</p>
<p>And then, as you point out, the real early history</p>
<p>of Iran with Western countries is like the great game stuff</p>
<p>with Russia and Great Britain.</p>
<p>Can you talk about that a little bit?</p>
<p>Because by the time the U.S. arrives on the scene,</p>
<p>Britain and Russia have been active in the region</p>
<p>for some time.</p>
<p>Sure. This is, in fact, what gets Iran</p>
<p>and the Iranian government interested in the United States</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>The Iran, or, you know, the Persian Empire,</p>
<p>or whatever you want to call it, historically,</p>
<p>of sort of hundreds of years,</p>
<p>had reached a point by the early 19th century,</p>
<p>where it was declining, like other Asian powers of its day,</p>
<p>and the Middle Eastern powers, the Ottoman Empire and others.</p>
<p>It was much less powerful than it had been,</p>
<p>and was very, was bitterly aware of the fact</p>
<p>that European powers were surpassing it,</p>
<p>both economically, militarily, politically, diplomatically.</p>
<p>And it was, you know, Iran, it&rsquo;s important to remember,</p>
<p>was not, it was one of very, very few countries</p>
<p>that has never been colonized formally</p>
<p>by a European power.</p>
<p>It was a sovereign state, a kingdom that stretched back,</p>
<p>you know, millennia, but had become so weak</p>
<p>by the early, you know, by sort of 1810s, 1820s,</p>
<p>that, you know, its territory had been reduced</p>
<p>significantly in wars, very important war with Russia</p>
<p>that trimmed even more of its territory.</p>
<p>And, you know, it was being pressured heavily</p>
<p>by Russia from the north, and by Britain,</p>
<p>the British Empire from the south,</p>
<p>from the Persian Gulf,</p>
<p>and Britain&rsquo;s positions in India.</p>
<p>And, you know, both of those two very, very large,</p>
<p>powerful empires were really beginning</p>
<p>to interfere significantly with any Iranian affairs,</p>
<p>and really pulled the strings in many ways</p>
<p>in the background.</p>
<p>It was a source of great resentment for the Iranians,</p>
<p>and they wanted to have what was called a third force.</p>
<p>This was a new sort of policy that was adopted</p>
<p>from around the 1850s, this idea that the country</p>
<p>needed to adopt a third kind of friend</p>
<p>that they could, you know, sort of friendship</p>
<p>that they could wave in the eyes of the British</p>
<p>and the Russians and say, you know, back off,</p>
<p>you know, we don&rsquo;t need you, we have other allies.</p>
<p>And the United States seemed like a very obvious choice,</p>
<p>because the United States in the 1850s, 1860s,</p>
<p>was a country that Iranians didn&rsquo;t know that much about,</p>
<p>but what they knew, they really liked.</p>
<p>What they knew was that this was a country</p>
<p>that had come into existence just less than a century</p>
<p>earlier on the back of a revolution</p>
<p>against the British Empire, and that it seemed</p>
<p>to not be interested in interfering</p>
<p>in the affairs of other countries.</p>
<p>The only Americans they knew were the Protestant</p>
<p>Presbyterian missionaries who had come to Iran</p>
<p>and built schools and clinics,</p>
<p>but there was no American embassy,</p>
<p>there was no, you know, there was no political,</p>
<p>diplomatic presence on the part of the U.S. government,</p>
<p>and that kind of made the U.S. this kind of alluring</p>
<p>blank slate that seemed to have a very hands-off</p>
<p>and even in some ways anti-imperialist kind of viewpoint.</p>
<p>And so they began to cultivate an American friendship,</p>
<p>and every single Iranian government from the 1850s</p>
<p>to about the 1940s made American friendship</p>
<p>a key part of its foreign policy to cultivate</p>
<p>a sort of third force against the British and the Russians.</p>
<p>The anecdote I love to tell is that the very first</p>
<p>disagreement that Iran and the United States ever had</p>
<p>was in the 1850s when they were signing</p>
<p>their first treaty of friendship.</p>
<p>And it took five years to negotiate that,</p>
<p>longer than it took to negotiate the nuclear deal in 2015.</p>
<p>And you think, why?</p>
<p>And it turns out one of their main sticking points</p>
<p>was that the Iranians wanted to purchase American warships</p>
<p>manned by American sailors flying the Stars and Stripes</p>
<p>in the Persian Gulf to send a message to the British.</p>
<p>And the Americans said, no, no,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to interfere in your affairs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible to think that was the first disagreement,</p>
<p>if you know Iranian-American politics today.</p>
<p>But, you know, it was the Iranian saying to the U.S.,</p>
<p>we want you more involved in our business.</p>
<p>The U.S. saying, no, no, we don&rsquo;t want to get involved.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of how far we&rsquo;ve come in 170 years.</p>
<p>Now, in this early period of connection</p>
<p>between the two countries, how would you describe</p>
<p>the governing system of Iran or Persia at this time?</p>
<p>Is this an absolute monarchy, or what do we have involved?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a parliament of sorts.</p>
<p>How would you describe the system in modern</p>
<p>sort of political science terms?</p>
<p>Yeah, in the 19th century, it was an absolute monarchy,</p>
<p>like many, many governments in the world at the time.</p>
<p>But it was a weak monarchy.</p>
<p>It did not have, it did not exercise,</p>
<p>there was not a strong central state that exercised</p>
<p>complete power over all aspects of people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>throughout the territory that it covered.</p>
<p>A lot of tribal areas and such, right?</p>
<p>It was tribal areas, various entrenched landowning interests,</p>
<p>very feudal in many ways, to use a kind of European terminology.</p>
<p>So there was, you know, the court, the royal court</p>
<p>and the king, you know, the Shah governed largely</p>
<p>through alliances and politics and, you know,</p>
<p>that sort of thing.</p>
<p>But interestingly, you know, you mentioned the parliament.</p>
<p>Iran had a constitutional revolution in 1906</p>
<p>and became the first Muslim country with a parliament,</p>
<p>the Majlis, the first country in Asia to have a parliament.</p>
<p>And that was a revolution that was largely instigated</p>
<p>by actually conservative interests, oddly.</p>
<p>This is one of those things that Iran has always had</p>
<p>revolutions, two revolutions in the 20th century</p>
<p>in modern times, and both of those have been quirky.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been sort of unconventional revolutions</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t follow the standard playbook that we&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<p>The constitutional revolution of 1906</p>
<p>was led largely by clerics, by ayatollahs,</p>
<p>and by bazaar merchants, you know, traditional traders</p>
<p>who felt that the Shah, the Shah&rsquo;s government</p>
<p>was giving away too much to foreign powers,</p>
<p>that there was, you know, that they needed</p>
<p>to be consulted more for various reasons.</p>
<p>And also a smaller group of kind of liberalizing intellectuals</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>And those were the forces that led that revolution.</p>
<p>And in many ways, those were the same kinds of forces</p>
<p>that came together in the Islamic Revolution of 1979.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s paradoxical.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re forces of conservatism in many ways,</p>
<p>but they also are forces of radicalism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a theme, though, and it runs through the book</p>
<p>and it runs through this Iranian history,</p>
<p>and the theme is this public dissatisfaction</p>
<p>with the Iranian government&rsquo;s giving away too much</p>
<p>to foreign governments, whether it&rsquo;s too much of the oil</p>
<p>rights or the tax revenues or the decision-making power</p>
<p>or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird to find so many similarities</p>
<p>between the public attitudes of, say, 1906 and 1979,</p>
<p>but I see, you know, you would see that same theme</p>
<p>and even the criticisms against the Shah and whatnot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, it seems like there&rsquo;s a, you know,</p>
<p>this is a weird thing to say because every nation has this,</p>
<p>but Iran seems to have this sense of national pride</p>
<p>that can get a government overturned pretty easily</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s seen to be giving away too much to,</p>
<p>especially the traditional enemies,</p>
<p>the British and the Russians.</p>
<p>But as soon as the United States steps in</p>
<p>and plays a similar role,</p>
<p>then we become just as much of a target for the,</p>
<p>for, as you said, the artisans, the bizarre people.</p>
<p>Would you say maybe those are almost a kind</p>
<p>of a middle-class representation</p>
<p>and the clerics, the religious folks?</p>
<p>And then you have a third force you mentioned</p>
<p>that comes in in the 20th century</p>
<p>where you have a sort of a Marxist leftist side, too,</p>
<p>and the three of them, all of them, though,</p>
<p>seem to share this antipathy toward the idea</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re giving away too much of the country&rsquo;s sovereignty</p>
<p>or resources to other countries.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely putting your finger on it correctly,</p>
<p>I think, and in fact, this is the core of, to me,</p>
<p>you know, the history of U.S.-Iran relations.</p>
<p>You know, there is this common thread</p>
<p>that runs through modern Iranian history.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>It is a unique country in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>of course, every country is unique,</p>
<p>but its history, I guess the uniqueness of Iran&rsquo;s history</p>
<p>is that this is a once, I mean, this was,</p>
<p>look, this is a country that has been,</p>
<p>at many points in history,</p>
<p>one of the great powers of history.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, the Persian Empire,</p>
<p>the first ancient Persian Empire of the Achaemenids,</p>
<p>you know, 6th century BC,</p>
<p>once ruled over almost half of the population of the world.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a country</p>
<p>that had a very strong sense of itself,</p>
<p>and yet also was a declining power,</p>
<p>you know, in the 1800s and the 1900s.</p>
<p>But also, not only was it a kind of declining</p>
<p>post-imperial power, but it was one that was not</p>
<p>invaded or colonized formally by other powers,</p>
<p>which gave Iranians, in many ways, a certain,</p>
<p>you know, it was a perfect storm, right?</p>
<p>It created this country, I think, as modern state</p>
<p>that has a lot of pride and sense of itself</p>
<p>in its history, yes, has a, you know,</p>
<p>a little bit of a chip on its shoulder</p>
<p>about kind of its, you know, its fated glory,</p>
<p>but also is extremely touchy about</p>
<p>what appeared to be kind of, you know,</p>
<p>violations of its sovereignty, its national integrity,</p>
<p>being kind of pushed around or told what to do,</p>
<p>or have people pulling the strings in the background.</p>
<p>Now, all of this plays out at numerous points</p>
<p>in its history, but also in numerous points</p>
<p>in its history with the United States.</p>
<p>You know, this is, those forces you mentioned,</p>
<p>you know, the first time we really see this</p>
<p>in terms of U.S.-Iran relations is in the 1953,</p>
<p>when Iran tries to nationalize its oil industry.</p>
<p>And, you know, the British, who,</p>
<p>the British oil company, Anglo-Iranian oil company,</p>
<p>which at the time has a monopoly over the oil production</p>
<p>and profits in Iran, you know,</p>
<p>precipitates a long-running feud with the Iranian government</p>
<p>and eventually convinces the United States</p>
<p>to overthrow Iran&rsquo;s very popular prime minister,</p>
<p>the prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, in 1953.</p>
<p>That, you know, Mossadegh, what we forget about him</p>
<p>is that he was a, the reason he was so popular</p>
<p>is that he put his finger very much on the zeitgeist</p>
<p>of Iranian nationalism of the 1950s,</p>
<p>the modern rising nationalism,</p>
<p>which was not unrelated to the nationalism</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about in the 19th or early 20th century.</p>
<p>It was, it was, the reason he was popular</p>
<p>was because he came along and he said,</p>
<p>we need to give more of a voice to the people,</p>
<p>but also more of a voice to ourselves as a country.</p>
<p>And those two things go hand in hand.</p>
<p>That, you know, the Shah&rsquo;s powers need to be limited.</p>
<p>There needs to be more representation</p>
<p>through parliament and democracy.</p>
<p>But that when you do that,</p>
<p>people will also be demanding an end to British</p>
<p>or other kinds of foreign interference</p>
<p>in the oil industry and vice versa.</p>
<p>You know, that sovereign, that true sovereignty,</p>
<p>true national self-determination</p>
<p>and democratic representation are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>That has been the common thread</p>
<p>through so much of 20th century Iranian history.</p>
<p>Well, now you got to 1953 before I was going to get there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a key year, but let&rsquo;s get to a little bit</p>
<p>about why something like that might matter</p>
<p>to a lot of the other great outside powers, right?</p>
<p>So in the great game era, you know, as you pointed out,</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s concerned with the strategic location</p>
<p>of a place like Iran, right?</p>
<p>This is a bridgeway to their empire in India.</p>
<p>For Russia, this is part and parcel of their whole,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got a lot of provinces in that region.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s oil that changes things</p>
<p>and puts them in a different dimension.</p>
<p>I mean, otherwise, you know, somebody said that</p>
<p>about the Middle East once.</p>
<p>I mean, what is the Middle East without oil?</p>
<p>Can you imagine? We wouldn&rsquo;t have been involved</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve been involved all these years.</p>
<p>And by the time 53 rolls around,</p>
<p>the reason anybody cares to the degree that they do</p>
<p>is because of the oil company that you just mentioned,</p>
<p>that Britain partners with Iran with.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about that first.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get backwards a little bit and get to the oil,</p>
<p>since the oil is so much a part of everything.</p>
<p>You know, oil and money might as well just make them</p>
<p>interchangeable in this case.</p>
<p>The United States is a big oil-producing country</p>
<p>in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Iran&rsquo;s not even on the map.</p>
<p>The Middle East is not even on the map</p>
<p>because nobody needs oil in the Middle East yet</p>
<p>because nobody&rsquo;s got a shortage anywhere.</p>
<p>Talk to me, though, about this,</p>
<p>because isn&rsquo;t Iran one of the early Middle Eastern oil fields?</p>
<p>Iran is the very first major, big, big, large-scale</p>
<p>oil discovery that takes place in the Middle East</p>
<p>here in 1907 at Masjid al-Sulayman in southern Iran.</p>
<p>You know, but you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, when that takes place,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a huge discovery,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very profitable for William Darcy,</p>
<p>the Anglo-Persian oil company.</p>
<p>And he got away. We should stop here</p>
<p>because one of the things that you said</p>
<p>that just blew my mind is he got the rights</p>
<p>to drill all of, like, all of Iran&rsquo;s oil</p>
<p>for years and years and years for, like,</p>
<p>20,000 British pounds or something like that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. It was an incredible deal.</p>
<p>It was one of the best deals I think anyone&rsquo;s ever got.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, you know, because at the time,</p>
<p>no one knew how much oil there was in Iran</p>
<p>and, you know, or how valuable it would be.</p>
<p>And Iran&rsquo;s government was extremely cash-strapped</p>
<p>at the time and gave away this concession,</p>
<p>the rights to drill over, you know,</p>
<p>a huge portion of the country</p>
<p>and to take the lion&rsquo;s share of the profits.</p>
<p>And, you know, Bashar&rsquo;s government at the time</p>
<p>needed the money,</p>
<p>had no idea what potentially lay underground.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting, of course, as you point out</p>
<p>correctly, the early 20th century, you know,</p>
<p>oil, you know, it&rsquo;s a valuable commodity,</p>
<p>but nothing like what it became later.</p>
<p>You know, and, you know, as late as 1910,</p>
<p>the United States was exporting oil to Iran, right?</p>
<p>The United States was the big oil exporter,</p>
<p>a big oil producer of the late 19th, early 20th century.</p>
<p>I mean, the oil fields of Pennsylvania and Texas</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, when oil is discovered,</p>
<p>of course, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I think we have to be a little bit careful</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not one of these people</p>
<p>that will sort of,</p>
<p>will claim that, you know, everything&rsquo;s all about oil.</p>
<p>You know, I think that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there and it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And money, of course, as you correctly point out,</p>
<p>you know, but in the early 20th century,</p>
<p>nobody cares that much about oil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what starts to change in the 1920s</p>
<p>after the first world war</p>
<p>and after the great powers begin to see</p>
<p>for the first time the potential</p>
<p>that the internal combustion engine and oil</p>
<p>have for powering their navies, their fleets,</p>
<p>as well as, of course, motor cars and other things,</p>
<p>that it becomes seen as a much more valuable commodity</p>
<p>and there is a bit more of a race or a scramble</p>
<p>for Middle Eastern oil among the British,</p>
<p>the Russians, Soviet Union, as it becomes,</p>
<p>and also the United States,</p>
<p>which is incredibly actually amateurish and naive</p>
<p>when it comes to Middle Eastern oil in the 1920s.</p>
<p>I mean, they, below opportunity after opportunity</p>
<p>to get into Iranian oil in the 1920s,</p>
<p>Sinclair and the Standard Oil companies</p>
<p>are both trying to get concessions in Iran.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just an absolute,</p>
<p>you know, sort of boondoggle.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>The British completely outsmart them</p>
<p>and they continue to maintain their monopoly</p>
<p>over Iranian oil until the 1950s.</p>
<p>Well, and if we remember the difference</p>
<p>between the Russians, the Americans, and the British</p>
<p>when it comes to oil in this time period</p>
<p>is the Russians and the Americans</p>
<p>have a generous supply within their own borders</p>
<p>and the British don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, then, you point out a wonderful thing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s not all about oil</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not all about money.</p>
<p>There are other elements that are very important</p>
<p>and one of the ones you bring up</p>
<p>and that we in the West don&rsquo;t pay enough attention to</p>
<p>is the religious side of this</p>
<p>and very specifically the fact that the people in Iran</p>
<p>are, for the most part, their version of Islam,</p>
<p>for the most part, is the Shia version.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re probably, would you correct me on this</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m wrong, the most populous Shia state in the world?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>I mean, Iran is really sort of the nerve center of Shia Islam.</p>
<p>And, you know, for those who are maybe not particularly</p>
<p>versed with these things, I mean,</p>
<p>the Shia are and remain a minority.</p>
<p>The Sunni are, of course, much more populous.</p>
<p>You mean in Islam as a whole?</p>
<p>Sorry, go on.</p>
<p>You mean in Islam as a whole, not in Iran?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry. Yes, I guess.</p>
<p>There are far more Sunni Muslims</p>
<p>than Shia Muslims in the world.</p>
<p>So, and so, but Iran is one of the very few countries</p>
<p>that is overwhelmingly majority Shia,</p>
<p>around 90% are Shia.</p>
<p>And, you know, there are other countries</p>
<p>that have Shia majorities</p>
<p>or significant pluralities,</p>
<p>but nothing quite like Iran.</p>
<p>And, yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s significant.</p>
<p>I think if anything, actually, weirdly,</p>
<p>I would say that in some ways,</p>
<p>I think sometimes we overemphasize religion</p>
<p>when in the West when we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about Middle Eastern states.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the religious aspects</p>
<p>are of course important, but they don&rsquo;t define everything.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really not until the 1970s</p>
<p>that religion becomes a serious force in politics.</p>
<p>And we see that, of course,</p>
<p>in the Iranian revolution of 1979.</p>
<p>But for most of Iran&rsquo;s modern history,</p>
<p>the clergy are very much sort of small C conservative.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re quietest, sometimes described there.</p>
<p>They support the state.</p>
<p>They play roughly the same role that the clergy</p>
<p>have often played in kind of European traditional societies</p>
<p>before the 20th century.</p>
<p>So in some ways, it&rsquo;s not that different</p>
<p>from the history that we know.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re in Iran in 1900 versus in Russia in 1900,</p>
<p>or in Prussia in 1900, or Italy in 1900,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see a very similar kind of state in many ways.</p>
<p>I mean, there are differences, of course,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna see monarchies,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see clergy playing a significant role</p>
<p>in rural communities, as well as, you know,</p>
<p>at the very nerve center of the state</p>
<p>and at the royal court.</p>
<p>But in a way that&rsquo;s not radical,</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s not revolutionary,</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s actually about maintaining</p>
<p>the traditional order.</p>
<p>Well, and worth pointing out that the religion in the West</p>
<p>was more important in those days, too.</p>
<p>So a comparison in 1900 is more apples and apples.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, so then let&rsquo;s ask then the obvious question.</p>
<p>Before we get to the pivotal year of 1953,</p>
<p>seems to me the Second World War</p>
<p>is a pretty important time on the Iranian timeline</p>
<p>because once again, their particular location</p>
<p>makes them extra valuable.</p>
<p>And the fact that a country like Germany,</p>
<p>who one of their main deficiencies in the world</p>
<p>is the fact that they don&rsquo;t have access to oil.</p>
<p>Talk to us a little about how Iran becomes this focal point</p>
<p>in the Second World War, when it would seem to be</p>
<p>a long way from most of the major battlefronts.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating, actually.</p>
<p>I think that Iran&rsquo;s history in the Second World War</p>
<p>is very interesting, and it&rsquo;s also, by the way,</p>
<p>the first time that large numbers of Iranians</p>
<p>and Americans, ordinary, ordinary Iranians and Americans</p>
<p>come into contact with each other.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll sort of come back to that.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, Iran&rsquo;s role in the Second World War</p>
<p>is interesting because it&rsquo;s a neutral country.</p>
<p>It has been neutral, you know, dating back to the 1820s.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t, you know, it&rsquo;s tried and it maintained</p>
<p>its neutrality, or it had tried to in the First World War,</p>
<p>unsuccessfully, it had been invaded.</p>
<p>But in the Second World War,</p>
<p>it really tries to insist on its neutrality.</p>
<p>You know, the feeling is this is,</p>
<p>this war doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with us.</p>
<p>Why, you know, it&rsquo;s a European war,</p>
<p>and they try to stay out of it as long as they can.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, you know,</p>
<p>so there is, of course, the oil issue.</p>
<p>All of the major belligerents of the Second World War</p>
<p>very much want oil to empower their armies</p>
<p>and babies and fleets and so on.</p>
<p>But also the Allies are very concerned</p>
<p>because there are large numbers of Germans living in Iran.</p>
<p>The Iran&rsquo;s government in the 1930s</p>
<p>had begun to draw closer to Germany&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It was certainly not, by any stretch of the imagination,</p>
<p>a sort of Nazi sympathizer, but there was a feeling,</p>
<p>it was a historic, lingering resentment</p>
<p>against Russia and Britain.</p>
<p>And of course, when the Soviet Union and Britain</p>
<p>joined forces in the Second World War,</p>
<p>it was natural that Iran would be more sympathetic</p>
<p>to both Germany and, you know, its allies.</p>
<p>So, of course, the Allies didn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>They tolerated it for a bit,</p>
<p>and then they moved in and invaded Iran in 1941</p>
<p>and overthrew the king at the time, Reza Shah,</p>
<p>in September of 1941.</p>
<p>It took three weeks to depose him.</p>
<p>They replaced him with his very, very young son,</p>
<p>22-year-old Mohammad Reza Shah,</p>
<p>who became the last king of Iran, the last Shah of Iran.</p>
<p>Once the Allies invaded and occupied Iran,</p>
<p>they agreed that they would leave when the war ended,</p>
<p>but they divided it up into northern and southern sectors,</p>
<p>a sort of Soviet sector and a British sector.</p>
<p>And the United States played the key role</p>
<p>of connecting these two sectors,</p>
<p>because Iran had just finished completing</p>
<p>a trans-Iranian railway that connected</p>
<p>the Persian Gulf in the south</p>
<p>up to the Caspian Sea in the north.</p>
<p>And that railway had been partly built by Americans, actually,</p>
<p>but the U.S. military sent over</p>
<p>what was called the Persian Gulf Command at the time,</p>
<p>30,000 American GIs.</p>
<p>It was one of the least known operations</p>
<p>of the Second World War,</p>
<p>but it was actually a very critical one,</p>
<p>because after Hitler had opened up</p>
<p>the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>the Soviet Moscow was completely cut off</p>
<p>from Western supplies,</p>
<p>and there were not a lot of good ways</p>
<p>to get material into Russia.</p>
<p>There was the northern route, which was very cold</p>
<p>and very difficult,</p>
<p>but one of the best routes was across Iran.</p>
<p>So the Allies occupied, they invaded,</p>
<p>they then started shipping huge quantities</p>
<p>of American lead leased supplies</p>
<p>along the trans-Iranian railway up to the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>and it was American troops that did that.</p>
<p>So, and then they were stationed there for a couple of years,</p>
<p>so you had, you know, thousands of Americans</p>
<p>for the first time stationed in Iran.</p>
<p>And so then you get the post-war period,</p>
<p>where we get to the Cold War worries about communism.</p>
<p>We get to the oil becoming even more important.</p>
<p>We get to the British post-war situation,</p>
<p>which is difficult to say the least.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s trying to find a soft landing from empire.</p>
<p>And so talk to me a little bit about</p>
<p>the Anglo-Iranian oil company</p>
<p>and the kind of deal that Iran had to put up with.</p>
<p>And in other words, I&rsquo;m trying to put Iran</p>
<p>into a situation here where anyone from any country</p>
<p>could kind of understand</p>
<p>how a deal like that graded against them,</p>
<p>how it was almost a deal from pre-colonial</p>
<p>sort of expectation eras.</p>
<p>And now we were in an era where it just looked like</p>
<p>a really bad deal by modern standards.</p>
<p>Can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I mean, the British were absolutely bankrupted</p>
<p>by the Second World War.</p>
<p>And as you say, yes, looking for a soft landing</p>
<p>is a good way to put it.</p>
<p>I mean, they were trying to adjust this new</p>
<p>post-imperial reality, which took some time.</p>
<p>And they desperately needed money.</p>
<p>And the Anglo-Iranian oil company</p>
<p>had been and continue to be the source of great profits</p>
<p>for the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Of course, after the war, Britain creates</p>
<p>this massive welfare state under the Labour government</p>
<p>of Pundit Atli, but needs to fund it.</p>
<p>And oil from Iran, I mean, one of the things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s often not appreciated in Britain, actually,</p>
<p>is just how much of the British welfare state</p>
<p>that people kind of cherish and take for granted,</p>
<p>things like the National Health Service and so on,</p>
<p>was really funded, not entirely,</p>
<p>but in very, very large measure</p>
<p>by the profits from Iranian oil.</p>
<p>And of course, in Iran, this was seen,</p>
<p>this was an increasingly source of resentment</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the 1950s now, people are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different, it&rsquo;s not the 1910s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the 1850s, you know,</p>
<p>the sort of imperial colonial era</p>
<p>seems to be drawing to a close</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t appreciate this very large</p>
<p>foreign company that has a monopoly</p>
<p>over the country&rsquo;s oil, that employs 30,000 people,</p>
<p>but treats Iranian manual labourers</p>
<p>very differently from British workers</p>
<p>who come in and have these beautiful suburban homes</p>
<p>with lawns and air conditioning and so on,</p>
<p>and houses Iranians in these kind of slums</p>
<p>and has kind of separate water fountains</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things, you know,</p>
<p>in their own country, you know,</p>
<p>and then, you know, one of the things I love</p>
<p>is that, you know, the British compound in Abadan,</p>
<p>you know, had a Persian club, you know,</p>
<p>that was called, where you would go for cocktails</p>
<p>and so on, but it was, you know,</p>
<p>very conspicuously labelled, you know,</p>
<p>not for Persians, you know, British only.</p>
<p>And this is the stuff where they started</p>
<p>to grate on people, on top of which,</p>
<p>this oil company is taking 80 to 90% of the profits</p>
<p>and, you know, is not opening up its books</p>
<p>to the Iranian government, not sharing the wealth,</p>
<p>refusing to adapt to modern times,</p>
<p>and it really starts to, and you have this now,</p>
<p>but also this rising generation in the 1950s</p>
<p>of increasingly educated, modern, middle-class Iranians</p>
<p>who see what&rsquo;s going on, read newspapers,</p>
<p>you know, hear the stories,</p>
<p>and are very resentful of this.</p>
<p>And they coalesce around their hero,</p>
<p>Mohammad Mossadegh, who was initially a parliamentarian,</p>
<p>a member of the Manchester Parliament,</p>
<p>who becomes a chair of the Petroleum Committee</p>
<p>and really is an uncompromising figure,</p>
<p>a very charismatic figure, an elderly man,</p>
<p>an aristocrat from an earlier era,</p>
<p>but one who was very sort of liberal and democratizing</p>
<p>and also believes very strongly that the time has come</p>
<p>for the Anglo-Iranian oil company to leave,</p>
<p>to hand over oil to the Iranian people</p>
<p>and to the Iranian government,</p>
<p>to nationalize the oil company,</p>
<p>and he tries to do that.</p>
<p>The British declared this an illegal act.</p>
<p>They refused to have anything to do with it,</p>
<p>and it was a two-year kind of battle that goes on.</p>
<p>They drag it into the Hague, into the United Nations,</p>
<p>World Corps, all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>They impose sanctions and they threaten the war.</p>
<p>A lot of the stuff that we see today</p>
<p>around nuclear issue in some ways,</p>
<p>but this time it&rsquo;s the British, right?</p>
<p>And initially, the Truman administration in the US</p>
<p>is, if not sympathetic to the Iranian position,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to play the neutral,</p>
<p>kind of neutral broker, saying to the British,</p>
<p>look, we understand where you&rsquo;re coming from,</p>
<p>but times are changing.</p>
<p>Do a deal with these guys.</p>
<p>Hand over the oil company.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll still let you take some profits,</p>
<p>but symbolically, you need to give more than you&rsquo;re giving,</p>
<p>and the British, and particularly the oil company,</p>
<p>is very unwilling to adapt.</p>
<p>It still is very much trapped</p>
<p>in a sort of colonial mindset.</p>
<p>The controversy continues until you get</p>
<p>conservative governments coming to power</p>
<p>in both Britain and in the US.</p>
<p>Churchill and the conservatives come back to power in 1952,</p>
<p>and Eisenhower and the Republicans</p>
<p>come to take the White House for the first time in 20 years,</p>
<p>at the beginning of 1953, and they ride to power</p>
<p>in a wave of kind of anti-communist rhetoric,</p>
<p>and the British see an opportunity.</p>
<p>They see that this is a very strongly kind of cold warrior,</p>
<p>anti-Soviet, anti-communist kind of new administration</p>
<p>in the US, and they play up that angle.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t go to the US and say, help us out</p>
<p>with our oil company, but they say, listen,</p>
<p>Iran is not ready for democracy.</p>
<p>For someone like Mossadegh, the Russians</p>
<p>are going to take advantage.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to foment a communist revolution.</p>
<p>Look, he&rsquo;s already relying on Marxists</p>
<p>to remain in power and so on, and they increasingly</p>
<p>destabilize the country, and they run</p>
<p>a lot of propaganda and false news stories in newspapers</p>
<p>and things like that, and eventually</p>
<p>peel away some of his allies and convince the US, the CIA,</p>
<p>that they should help to overthrow</p>
<p>the government in a coup, and they do that in August of 1953.</p>
<p>OK, this is a big, your whole book deals with this</p>
<p>in such a way as to really, I mean,</p>
<p>that was too quick of a rundown, is what I would say.</p>
<p>I consider 1953 to be the worst example of the concept</p>
<p>of blowback that the United States has ever encountered.</p>
<p>And one can say that, you know, when I was growing up</p>
<p>in the 1970s, we had this blowback by the end.</p>
<p>Vietnam was considered a blowback situation.</p>
<p>Watergate was a domestic political blowback situation.</p>
<p>I mean, we felt like we were being whipsawed</p>
<p>by reaping the whirlwind of a bunch of decisions</p>
<p>that had been made two, three, four decades previously.</p>
<p>And 1953 is a perfect example, because by the time</p>
<p>Iranians are taking Americans hostage in 1979, 1980,</p>
<p>the advantages, right, the plus side of the blowback maneuver</p>
<p>has been paying off for decades.</p>
<p>But the bill comes due later, and when it did,</p>
<p>most Americans did not, I can say 98% of Americans</p>
<p>made no connection between 1979 and 1980,</p>
<p>and the fact that the fuse on that explosive</p>
<p>had been lit back in 1953.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about that.</p>
<p>Most Americans still know nothing about Operation AJAX</p>
<p>and that whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny you say that.</p>
<p>I mean, Jimmy Carter was asked during the American Revolution,</p>
<p>during the Iranian Revolution and the hostage crisis,</p>
<p>he was asked by a reporter about 1953.</p>
<p>The question was phrased exactly along the lines</p>
<p>that you just did.</p>
<p>And he said, you know, that&rsquo;s ancient history.</p>
<p>Oh, I would have thought he would have known, too.</p>
<p>He was a pretty intelligent guy.</p>
<p>Oh, he was, and I&rsquo;m sure he knew the history.</p>
<p>But I mean, you know, he didn&rsquo;t entertain</p>
<p>the premise of the question.</p>
<p>And of course, for Iranians, it was very much not ancient.</p>
<p>It had been 25 years, and that generation</p>
<p>that led the revolution in Iran in 1979</p>
<p>was younger, angrier, more radical,</p>
<p>and less compromising with the United States</p>
<p>than the generation of 1953.</p>
<p>The young, idealistic, modern middle class</p>
<p>of the early 1950s in Iran was very liberal and Western.</p>
<p>And Mossadegh was a very pro-Western figure.</p>
<p>He believed in constitutional government and parliamentary.</p>
<p>I mean, he was just obsessed with the idea</p>
<p>of parliamentary procedure and the importance</p>
<p>of parliamentary sovereignty and popular representation.</p>
<p>He had been educated in Switzerland and France</p>
<p>and constitutional law.</p>
<p>You know, he inspired that generation of Iranians</p>
<p>to believe in liberal, parliamentary,</p>
<p>constitutional democracy as a way to get your needs met</p>
<p>and to be heard and to liberate your country</p>
<p>from foreign powers and so on.</p>
<p>But the lesson that Iranians had drawn from that</p>
<p>was that the moment you tried to do that,</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s greatest democracy, the United States,</p>
<p>had come in and overthrown the government</p>
<p>because it was not seen as aligned with their interests.</p>
<p>So 25 years later, it was very difficult</p>
<p>for that aging generation of pro-Mossadegh activists</p>
<p>of the 1950s to say to young radicals,</p>
<p>well, you know, you have to publish newspapers</p>
<p>and run petitions and run for parliament.</p>
<p>You know, they weren&rsquo;t having that.</p>
<p>They said, we&rsquo;re not doing that again.</p>
<p>You guys did that, and you got screwed.</p>
<p>And they turned more to religion,</p>
<p>or they turned more to Marxism.</p>
<p>And those forces fused in the Iranian revolution in 1979</p>
<p>to overthrow the Shah.</p>
<p>So we haven&rsquo;t really explained, though, what 1953 was.</p>
<p>So in 1953, so Mohamed Mossadegh is the prime minister, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s elected the head of the government.</p>
<p>He wants to renegotiate the deal with the Anglo-Iranian oil</p>
<p>company.</p>
<p>The British don&rsquo;t like this.</p>
<p>If the way you frame it, which I don&rsquo;t consider to be incorrect,</p>
<p>is sort of that the British are able to, in a way,</p>
<p>poke Eisenhower in places where he&rsquo;s sensitive.</p>
<p>Because you quoted him a couple of times in a way that</p>
<p>made it sound like an eye.</p>
<p>I generally like Eisenhower&rsquo;s anti- he</p>
<p>has a kind of an anti-imperial, Middle America</p>
<p>sort of Norman Rockwell side to him that comes out sometimes.</p>
<p>And you had a quote or two which sort of represented</p>
<p>that in the book.</p>
<p>But then I remember thinking to myself, yes,</p>
<p>but then the British come back and find those sensitive spots</p>
<p>on Eisenhower, the communism stuff and all the other.</p>
<p>Can you explain a little bit this dynamic</p>
<p>between the British who are still</p>
<p>trying to piece together little bits of colonial things</p>
<p>where they can, a guy like Eisenhower</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not real sensitive to that, but both of them</p>
<p>in probably, I&rsquo;d say, 53, we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the depths of the anti-communist red scares,</p>
<p>the second red scare is what we call it in the US, era.</p>
<p>How were the British able to sort of manipulate Eisenhower</p>
<p>into doing something that they wanted</p>
<p>but that Eisenhower could not be counted on to do it</p>
<p>for the reasons the British wanted it done?</p>
<p>Yes, and it&rsquo;s important to say, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that it was Eisenhower that they really kind of convinced,</p>
<p>you know, members of his administration,</p>
<p>in particular, the Dulles brothers.</p>
<p>The Dulles brothers were always up for that, though.</p>
<p>I always get, I get the feeling they never</p>
<p>met a coup they didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Well, but this was the first one, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>This is the first one.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, this set the model for all the other.</p>
<p>This is the big CIA&rsquo;s first one, right?</p>
<p>We should tell that there was no CIA.</p>
<p>There was an OSS in the Second World War.</p>
<p>After the Second World War of 47, 48,</p>
<p>the creation of the National Security State,</p>
<p>which included the CIA.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this fledgling group of people</p>
<p>that have grown out of the OSS.</p>
<p>And this is their first attempt at a covert overthrowing</p>
<p>of a government.</p>
<p>Did I get that correct?</p>
<p>Yes, and it goes, you know, in their minds,</p>
<p>very, very successfully, you know, kind of in quotes.</p>
<p>It becomes a model.</p>
<p>It becomes a model of the next year in 54 in Guatemala</p>
<p>and Chile in the 70s.</p>
<p>Again and again, it&rsquo;s kind of a so-called dirty tricks</p>
<p>operation, but by the 70s, it had become kind of fallen out</p>
<p>of favor in many ways.</p>
<p>But this was a watershed moment for the CIA</p>
<p>and for American intelligence operations.</p>
<p>Yeah, they were able to, the British</p>
<p>were able to make their case on a number of levels.</p>
<p>They had been, you know, they had</p>
<p>been bribing newspaper editors and so on to write</p>
<p>negative stories about Mossad.</p>
<p>They had been bribing politicians</p>
<p>to withdraw their support from him.</p>
<p>They had been imposing very severe sanctions</p>
<p>on the Iranian economy that had really</p>
<p>been making it very difficult for Mossad to govern.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d been working on the Shah as well, the king.</p>
<p>So forget about him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a young king at this point.</p>
<p>You know, Iran is not a true constitutional democracy</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sort of hybrid, where the Shah still</p>
<p>has control over, you know, the defense ministry and the army</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t a huge fan of his prime minister, actually.</p>
<p>He feels a little bit threatened by him.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re able to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>But the case they make to the Americans, the CIA and the State</p>
<p>Department, and the new incoming administration,</p>
<p>again, is a Cold War case.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re able to do that by already having destabilized</p>
<p>and weakened the Iranian government so much in all</p>
<p>the ways that I just described.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very, it becomes easy for them to say, look,</p>
<p>we have this ready-made kind of plan for, like,</p>
<p>how we can get rid of Mossadegh.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s not, you know, you can&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a communist himself.</p>
<p>But I mean, there&rsquo;s a risk that Iran</p>
<p>is going to open up to communism because of its instability</p>
<p>and its inability to govern and so on and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to remember that, you know,</p>
<p>the Democrats and the Republicans in the 1940s,</p>
<p>50s, 60s had very different visions</p>
<p>for how to deal with communism in the third world,</p>
<p>as they called it at the time.</p>
<p>The Democrats under Truman, and later under JFK as well,</p>
<p>very much took the attitude that people like Mossadegh</p>
<p>were exactly what you wanted.</p>
<p>They were social Democrats.</p>
<p>They were liberals.</p>
<p>You know, they were building welfare states</p>
<p>in their countries.</p>
<p>But they were very anti-Soviet, because they were.</p>
<p>I mean, they were Western.</p>
<p>They were, you know, Democrats.</p>
<p>They were not communists by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>What they were doing and what the Democrats liked</p>
<p>was that they felt that leaders like that,</p>
<p>by building welfare states, by funding education and literacy</p>
<p>and health care and all these kinds of things,</p>
<p>and labor unions, would actually take away</p>
<p>the appeal of communism in impoverished countries,</p>
<p>give people less of a reason to turn to communism.</p>
<p>The Republicans saw it very differently.</p>
<p>They said, no, it&rsquo;s a slippery slope.</p>
<p>You know, anything that looks or smells like communism</p>
<p>is going to, might as well be a communist.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, in a developing country,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t have a democratic tradition.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not ready for democracy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s too much of a risk of destabilization.</p>
<p>And the Soviets will just take advantage,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll foment a coup, and they&rsquo;ll, you know,</p>
<p>have a communist revolution.</p>
<p>Now, both of these were reasonable attitudes</p>
<p>in their own way.</p>
<p>I mean, they sort of made sense.</p>
<p>But as long as Truman had been in power,</p>
<p>you know, the British hadn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>felt that they had a friend in the US</p>
<p>when it came to Iran.</p>
<p>They were very frustrated by the Americans.</p>
<p>They felt that the Truman administration just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t understand what they were dealing with,</p>
<p>you know, that they were sort of American, naive neophytes,</p>
<p>you know, who were idealistic.</p>
<p>And there were a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>kind of communications back and forth</p>
<p>between the British and American governments,</p>
<p>you know, the British sort of saying,</p>
<p>you know, you don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been dealing with these devious persons</p>
<p>for, you know, for decades, you know,</p>
<p>for much longer than you have.</p>
<p>I mean, you just, you have to take a tough line.</p>
<p>And they were frustrated because they weren&rsquo;t getting</p>
<p>cooperation from the Truman administration.</p>
<p>Truman was trying to take kind of an even-handed approach.</p>
<p>But when Eisenhower came in, and he came in,</p>
<p>you know, the 52 election was very much</p>
<p>fought on the idea that, you know,</p>
<p>that there were, you know, pinkos and closet</p>
<p>reds in the State Department.</p>
<p>And, you know, the Truman administration</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really want to win the Korean War</p>
<p>because the State Department was-</p>
<p>Well, this is the McCarthy era blooming, absolutely.</p>
<p>And that kind of fire-breathing anti-communism,</p>
<p>you know, was a-</p>
<p>For Britain, they sensed that this was their opportunity.</p>
<p>This was their moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they could make their case.</p>
<p>Not by talking about oil and profits and things like that,</p>
<p>but by saying this is dangerous.</p>
<p>Like, you can&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>Iran is getting destabilized.</p>
<p>You need to do something.</p>
<p>And you had mentioned, you know, today we would call it</p>
<p>fake news would be the 21st century term for it.</p>
<p>But you had talked about the news coverage.</p>
<p>And back then, of course, in the West,</p>
<p>we had many fewer outlets.</p>
<p>So it would have been almost the same message</p>
<p>across multiple different media type platforms back then,</p>
<p>broadcast networks, newspapers, radio.</p>
<p>But when you had run down sort of the list</p>
<p>of how it was being covered, well, you can see-</p>
<p>I mean, the funny thing is, is we think about that</p>
<p>as the good old days of journalism.</p>
<p>I like to say that the good old days of journalism</p>
<p>were between like 1968 and 1988.</p>
<p>And this was before the era.</p>
<p>This was post-yellow journalism, pre-modern journalism.</p>
<p>But it was a-</p>
<p>Fake news is not a bad way to describe the way</p>
<p>the Western public was receiving their information</p>
<p>about this 1953 situation, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s striking, right?</p>
<p>Journalism was done very differently back then.</p>
<p>It was a sort of gentleman&rsquo;s pursuit.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t quite the same level of rigor</p>
<p>and fact-checking and so on.</p>
<p>And you look at the newspapers at the time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extraordinary the way they reported.</p>
<p>You look at the New York Times in August of 1953,</p>
<p>the day after the coup.</p>
<p>And, you know, the report is, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the exact words of the headline,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something along the lines of, you know,</p>
<p>a coup attempt is thwarted in Iran,</p>
<p>that Mossadegh had tried to overthrow the Shah.</p>
<p>And that, you know, that he had been thwarted,</p>
<p>which is the literal opposite of what happened, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this idea that the prime minister</p>
<p>was trying to overthrow the king and, you know,</p>
<p>that the popular, this popular king</p>
<p>had actually managed to, you know,</p>
<p>maintain himself in power.</p>
<p>And, you know, the graceful public</p>
<p>was cheered and relieved by this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the precise opposite</p>
<p>of what actually happened.</p>
<p>But over time, you know, the truth, I mean, in Iran,</p>
<p>people, I think many people, you know,</p>
<p>already kind of suspected the CIA hand.</p>
<p>And over time, it became more and more of an open secret</p>
<p>until 20 years later in 1978 or 80,</p>
<p>I think it was 81, Kermit Roosevelt,</p>
<p>who was one of the kind of the real masterminds of the coup,</p>
<p>published his memoir about it</p>
<p>and was very open about his role</p>
<p>and the sacks of cash that were being handed out in Tehran</p>
<p>and the various dirty tricks that were being undertaken.</p>
<p>And then finally, in 2000, the New York Times published,</p>
<p>oh, sorry, the State Department released some documents</p>
<p>and they were published in the New York Times</p>
<p>at length, you know, in great length.</p>
<p>These sort of the CIA&rsquo;s own internal report on the coup.</p>
<p>They still censored and redacted some of the language,</p>
<p>but most of it was there.</p>
<p>And this was literally a 70-page document,</p>
<p>internal report written by the CIA</p>
<p>describing in detail there how they did it.</p>
<p>So there was no disputing it by that point.</p>
<p>So in 53, the democratically elected Mosaddegh</p>
<p>is overthrown.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s replaced by the absolute monarch,</p>
<p>who, you know, the feel you get for this guy,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got an almost Kaiser Wilhelm kind of vibe,</p>
<p>you know, fascinated by the military stuff, but not exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe go into a little depth</p>
<p>because this guy is going to be the one</p>
<p>who determines the feel of this relationship for decades.</p>
<p>Tell us a little bit about the last Shah of Iran.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incredible figure.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, like so many major leaders</p>
<p>in world history, I mean, you know, who really knows the Shah?</p>
<p>Who really knows who he was and what made him tick?</p>
<p>You know, but there is an impression that we have of him.</p>
<p>You know, he was in many ways in his father&rsquo;s shadow.</p>
<p>His father had come out of nowhere</p>
<p>to overthrow the previous dynasty.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;d been a rough, crude, illiterate</p>
<p>Cossack soldier in the 1920s.</p>
<p>But the son, the younger Shah, you know,</p>
<p>had been sent off to boarding school in Switzerland.</p>
<p>To Le Rosier, one of the most elite private boarding schools</p>
<p>in the world, was a very cosmopolitan, refined,</p>
<p>well-mannered young man, very good-looking,</p>
<p>sort of a ladies&rsquo; man, but not a tough guy like his father.</p>
<p>You know, and there&rsquo;s always a sense,</p>
<p>and he writes about it in his own memoirs that you could,</p>
<p>you know, he talks about how his father&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<p>could make him sort of shrivel up inside.</p>
<p>I mean, he was terrified of his father.</p>
<p>He said it was a relationship of awe and fear,</p>
<p>but not always of love, you know?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to put someone on the couch, you know,</p>
<p>who died, you know, when I was seven years old.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not, you know, I mean, I have no right</p>
<p>to sort of psychoanalyze the Shah.</p>
<p>But there is a sense that there was often a chip</p>
<p>on his shoulder when it came to military affairs.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, he was being quizzed</p>
<p>and drilled by his father about, you know,</p>
<p>kind of military questions.</p>
<p>You know, his whole reign, he was obsessed</p>
<p>with buying really big, fancy, expensive military hardware,</p>
<p>you know, the latest fighter jets and the latest tanks</p>
<p>and helicopters and everything,</p>
<p>and much of it from the United States.</p>
<p>By the 1970s, the Nixon administration,</p>
<p>who loved the Shah, gave him a blank check</p>
<p>to buy all the American military hardware he wanted.</p>
<p>But before that, you know, there&rsquo;d been some resistance,</p>
<p>especially from the Kennedy administration,</p>
<p>you know, who told him, look, no, you need to invest</p>
<p>in your country and literacy and political reform</p>
<p>and rights and things like that, healthcare and so on,</p>
<p>land reform, and he did a lot of that.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t always done as well</p>
<p>as it could have been done, and it was never accompanied</p>
<p>by political reform or real political participation.</p>
<p>Genuine avenues for people to participate</p>
<p>in the parliamentary elections were largely a joke</p>
<p>in the 1950s and 60s and 70s, if you will.</p>
<p>But he really cared about the military,</p>
<p>and he was a strong man, he was a tough guy,</p>
<p>he was sort of a right-wing leader,</p>
<p>he was a believer in strength and militarism</p>
<p>as a way to protect the country against communism</p>
<p>or against any other kind of external threat.</p>
<p>Give us an idea.</p>
<p>I was gonna say, give us an idea of the amount,</p>
<p>because you blew my mind with some of the,</p>
<p>if you just asked a trivia question,</p>
<p>who was the United States&rsquo; biggest arms customer</p>
<p>in certain years in the 1970s, I would never have said Iran,</p>
<p>but weren&rsquo;t they one of the top US customers for arms?</p>
<p>You said that they practically saved several of the,</p>
<p>of some of our aerospace companies, I believe.</p>
<p>Absolutely, a lot of, I mean, Grumman and Westinghouse,</p>
<p>so many of these companies, Boeing.</p>
<p>We were struggling in the 1970s.</p>
<p>It was economically a difficult time,</p>
<p>lots of job layoffs and so on, unemployment.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, Iran, so there was that angle as well.</p>
<p>I mean, the Nixon administration was quite happy</p>
<p>to help save some of these companies,</p>
<p>you know, the gigantic Iranian contract.</p>
<p>But it was more than that.</p>
<p>It was part of the so-called Nixon doctrine.</p>
<p>Nixon had come to power in the years of the Vietnam War</p>
<p>when there was a real attempt to try to exit</p>
<p>some of these quad buyers in the third world.</p>
<p>And, you know, he really liked the idea that American,</p>
<p>for American foreign policy,</p>
<p>it was important to find loyal, helpful regional powers</p>
<p>that could protect and advance American interests</p>
<p>in their respective regions</p>
<p>and could be rewarded with arms sales.</p>
<p>And the Shah of Iran was probably</p>
<p>the ultimate epitome of that.</p>
<p>The sort of policeman of the Persian Gulf</p>
<p>for the United States, you know, the famous, you know,</p>
<p>moment when Nixon goes to Tehran with Henry Kissinger,</p>
<p>you know, he comes across the table and says to him,</p>
<p>you know, protect me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I need here.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ll give you all the weapons you want,</p>
<p>but, you know, protect us here</p>
<p>because the US is not in a position</p>
<p>to be able to police the Persian Gulf, you know, in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not a one way street.</p>
<p>Of course, the Shah is also very good</p>
<p>at manipulating the US</p>
<p>and kind of getting what he wants out of the US.</p>
<p>He is, by the 1970s, a seasoned, experienced, smart leader</p>
<p>who knows and understands</p>
<p>kind of global geopolitics very well.</p>
<p>And the relationship between him and Richard Nixon</p>
<p>is very good by the 1970s.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re big admirers of each other.</p>
<p>But of course, they both go down in some kind of ignominy.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about that because from a geo,</p>
<p>if we look at this just from a geo-strategic standpoint,</p>
<p>forget human rights, forget religion,</p>
<p>forget all these other things,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just talk, you know,</p>
<p>the old risk board game, right?</p>
<p>The difference between having a friendly Iran in our camp</p>
<p>and what the Middle East and that whole region looks like</p>
<p>to not having a, to having an adversarial Iran</p>
<p>is so different that this is where you really see</p>
<p>the damage from the blowback from 1953.</p>
<p>I mean, if you play the what if game today and say,</p>
<p>if you have a friendly Iran today,</p>
<p>how different is the entire region?</p>
<p>I mean, I would struggle to even begin to examine</p>
<p>the ramifications of something like that.</p>
<p>Can you give us an idea though about how important,</p>
<p>at least in the, you know, without fantasizing</p>
<p>about what it might be like today,</p>
<p>how important was it in the mid 1970s</p>
<p>for the United States and its allies?</p>
<p>Look, the Iranian revolution,</p>
<p>I forget now because it was kind of a long time ago,</p>
<p>but the Iranian revolution in 1979</p>
<p>was a devastating blow for American foreign policy.</p>
<p>Absolutely devastating.</p>
<p>No one saw it coming.</p>
<p>And it was one of the cataclysmic failures</p>
<p>of the Carter administration,</p>
<p>or rather it was seen that way.</p>
<p>I think Carter sometimes gets too much blame</p>
<p>for the Iranian revolution.</p>
<p>And he was raked across the coal by his political enemies,</p>
<p>by Kissinger, by the Republicans,</p>
<p>who constantly hopped on the idea</p>
<p>that he was the man who lost Iran, quote unquote.</p>
<p>Iran was a very, very important American ally in the 1970s.</p>
<p>It was routinely described by American president.</p>
<p>LBJ described it, you know, he said what was happening in Iran</p>
<p>was just about the best thing going, you know.</p>
<p>Routinely American officials and presidents</p>
<p>would describe Iran as an island of stability</p>
<p>in an otherwise troubled region,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just critical to American foreign policy.</p>
<p>There was no other ally that fought that level of weaponry,</p>
<p>that advanced American interests so broadly in the region,</p>
<p>and not just its own, you know, interests,</p>
<p>but American interests in various parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>You know, Iran was, and always is,</p>
<p>and continues to be a very important country in the region.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why we&rsquo;re so obsessed</p>
<p>with kind of this hostility towards Iran these days,</p>
<p>because, look, it&rsquo;s a big country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a country of, you know, today 80 million people,</p>
<p>at the time about 35 million people,</p>
<p>but one of the largest in the region,</p>
<p>both in terms of population and geography,</p>
<p>and of course, one of the world&rsquo;s largest oil producers,</p>
<p>and, you know, occupies a key strategic position</p>
<p>between the Soviet Union and the present Gulf,</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And we lost it.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t want to put it in these kinds of American,</p>
<p>foreign, purely kind of American foreign policy terms,</p>
<p>but if you do, it&rsquo;s like we lost Iran.</p>
<p>And that was a huge blow.</p>
<p>And not just that, you know,</p>
<p>compounded by the fact the way we lost Iran,</p>
<p>which was that it was, you know,</p>
<p>it was lost on the back of a religious revolution</p>
<p>that rejected all of the basic premises of the Cold War.</p>
<p>You know, every, you know, the concern had been at the time</p>
<p>that if there&rsquo;s a revolution in a third world country,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a communist revolution.</p>
<p>No one saw a religious revolution coming.</p>
<p>It was the world&rsquo;s, it was the first great</p>
<p>religious revolution of the modern era.</p>
<p>And, you know, it was just completely outside the playbook,</p>
<p>and it inspired other types of movements like it,</p>
<p>in Afghanistan, in Lebanon,</p>
<p>and other parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s something that helped to fuel a lot of the kind</p>
<p>of, you know, because the lesson,</p>
<p>the big lesson that was drawn, actually,</p>
<p>by so many people throughout the region,</p>
<p>was here you had a king who had the world&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I forget, fourth or fifth largest army, 400,000 men,</p>
<p>one of the world&rsquo;s largest</p>
<p>and most brutal secret police operators.</p>
<p>The support of the United States,</p>
<p>and to some extent the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>all the world&rsquo;s great powers, he had everything.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been in power for 38 years,</p>
<p>and yet it was all blown away,</p>
<p>brushed away by a religious revolution</p>
<p>led by an 80-year-old cleric.</p>
<p>You know, how would you not draw the conclusion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a devout Muslim,</p>
<p>how would you not draw the conclusion</p>
<p>that God was on their side in some way,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something to be said for religion</p>
<p>as a motivating force for radicalism and revolution?</p>
<p>For all of those reasons, the Iranian revolution</p>
<p>is such a watershed and such a loss,</p>
<p>such a blow to America.</p>
<p>So let me go back.</p>
<p>So one of the biggest, most interesting</p>
<p>revelatory parts of the book for me</p>
<p>were what you just described,</p>
<p>because when we think about revolutions</p>
<p>that are touting the plight of the poor,</p>
<p>or the people who have needs in society,</p>
<p>or the downtrodden, or the ones who need education,</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things against, you know,</p>
<p>the corrupt powers that be, in the 1970s especially,</p>
<p>you think about that as a sort of a Marxist platform.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the area where they&rsquo;re usually able to make some hay,</p>
<p>as we say here in the States.</p>
<p>But this is a different thing,</p>
<p>because this is, as you point out in the book,</p>
<p>this is not a radical left-wing sort of revolution.</p>
<p>This is a conservative religious one,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s pushing the same sort of thing,</p>
<p>offering hope and help to the poor, to the downtrodden.</p>
<p>Can you, I mean, you&rsquo;ve introduced it a little bit,</p>
<p>but can you talk a little about that?</p>
<p>Because you can see how something like that</p>
<p>in a region with so much poverty,</p>
<p>especially outside the major cities,</p>
<p>how something like this would not just be popular,</p>
<p>but that that could be a base of support</p>
<p>that keeps it in power for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting movement.</p>
<p>It is. I mean, it&rsquo;s a fascinating revolution,</p>
<p>just for me as a historian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating revolution.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I mean, in many ways, the Islamic Revolution of 1979</p>
<p>adopts a lot of the language of the left and of the Marxists.</p>
<p>They talk about, you know, where, you know,</p>
<p>when the Marxists talk about, you know,</p>
<p>the workers of the world uniting and so on,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a lot of that kind of language,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t put it as much in the language</p>
<p>of kind of workers and trade unions and labor and so on,</p>
<p>but they talk about the oppressed of the earth.</p>
<p>And to this day, the Islamic Republic</p>
<p>plays up a lot of that language.</p>
<p>They have a foundation called the, you know,</p>
<p>the Bonyad al-Mustasafi, you know,</p>
<p>the foundation of the oppressed,</p>
<p>which was funded by seized assets</p>
<p>and money taken from the Shah&rsquo;s regime.</p>
<p>You know, they really play up that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>that anti-imperialist, anti, you know,</p>
<p>sort of materialist rhetoric.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s striking is that, about the revolution,</p>
<p>is that, you know, again, in 1979,</p>
<p>the world is divided heavily between communism,</p>
<p>the kind of the Soviet bloc and the American bloc,</p>
<p>the capitalist democratic bloc.</p>
<p>And what really is extraordinary about the Iranian revolution</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s the first movement,</p>
<p>the first revolution that says, you know,</p>
<p>both of these political, you know,</p>
<p>after I said, the third world, as it was known,</p>
<p>was constantly being asked to choose</p>
<p>between these two blocs, right?</p>
<p>And of course, there was a non-aligned movement</p>
<p>and so on, but-</p>
<p>Yeah, Nehru and all those people, right.</p>
<p>Right, there was this feeling of, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re with us, you&rsquo;re with the Soviets,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re with, you know.</p>
<p>And the Iranian revolutionaries said, you know,</p>
<p>both of these political philosophies</p>
<p>are fundamentally materialist.</p>
<p>You know, whether you&rsquo;re a communist or a capitalist,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making your arguments to the people</p>
<p>based on what is gonna improve their material welfare, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna improve their bottom line.</p>
<p>And no one&rsquo;s attending to people&rsquo;s spiritual welfare,</p>
<p>that there is a different path.</p>
<p>There was a sort of third way</p>
<p>between Marxism and capitalism, which is God.</p>
<p>And, you know, you had a lot of revolutionary leaders</p>
<p>who would talk about, you know,</p>
<p>Mohammed and, you know, the first socialist,</p>
<p>and, you know, this kind of idyllic seventh century world,</p>
<p>and, you know, in seventh century Arabia</p>
<p>around the prophet and his family,</p>
<p>where everyone was equal,</p>
<p>and there was no poverty and wealth was shared and so on.</p>
<p>Because, of course, Islam, as many of your listeners</p>
<p>will know, is a religion that does emphasize a lot</p>
<p>the alleviation of poverty and giving to the poor</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So it was easy for people who were very leftist</p>
<p>in the 1970s to find ways to kind of fuse</p>
<p>that kind of language with Islam</p>
<p>and say, hey, you know what?</p>
<p>Both, you know, communism and capitalism,</p>
<p>these are foreign imports.</p>
<p>They have no place here.</p>
<p>Like, you know, let&rsquo;s draw on some of our own traditions.</p>
<p>You know, instead of letting the Russians</p>
<p>and the Americans fight and squabble over us,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we tap into our own traditions?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very intoxicating message, right?</p>
<p>For, you know, in a closed society</p>
<p>where people don&rsquo;t have a lot of avenues</p>
<p>for political participation,</p>
<p>you could be able to turn to authentic traditions.</p>
<p>And, yeah, I mean, so, yeah, you had this revolution</p>
<p>that was very radical in its way.</p>
<p>You know, but it&rsquo;s difficult to know how to place it</p>
<p>on the sort of left-right spectrum</p>
<p>because it kind of rejected that whole spectrum, right?</p>
<p>What if we compare it then to outcomes?</p>
<p>So I think one could make a case</p>
<p>that those other two systems of government</p>
<p>that you mentioned, whether we&rsquo;re talking about communism</p>
<p>as practiced in reality as opposed to a classroom version</p>
<p>or capitalism as practiced in reality</p>
<p>as opposed to a classroom version,</p>
<p>I would argue that neither one of those sides</p>
<p>necessarily lived up to the marketing hype very well.</p>
<p>How would you grade the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s revolution</p>
<p>and how well they were able to manage</p>
<p>to live up to the marketing?</p>
<p>No, I mean, also, like most revolutions, about the same.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there were some genuine changes</p>
<p>and genuine achievements.</p>
<p>I mean, look, when you look over the last 40 years,</p>
<p>you know, if you want to talk about what has the Iranian</p>
<p>revolution achieved, I mean, it did achieve some.</p>
<p>Look, one of its biggest achievements</p>
<p>was genuine foreign policy independence.</p>
<p>Whatever criticisms people might have</p>
<p>of the Islamic Republic today, no one will ever accuse it</p>
<p>of being a lackey or a puppet of anyone,</p>
<p>of the West, of the United States.</p>
<p>You know, the Soviet Union or even Russia.</p>
<p>I know sometimes there is a bit of a rhetoric</p>
<p>about Russia these days, but I mean, you know,</p>
<p>Iran is not, you know, Russia is not a propping up</p>
<p>the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>I mean, Russia is a fair-weather friend</p>
<p>to the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s achieved that.</p>
<p>It did achieve some genuine income</p>
<p>and wealth redistribution, and, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of impoverished people were genuinely lifted</p>
<p>out of poverty in the 1980s and 90s and so on.</p>
<p>Now, on the other hand, of course,</p>
<p>you know, you can talk about the lack of social freedoms</p>
<p>and the more repressive religious aspects</p>
<p>of the Iranian revolution.</p>
<p>Of course, it never promised freedom.</p>
<p>It never claimed to be a liberal revolution in that sense.</p>
<p>It was never meant as a revolution</p>
<p>about people&rsquo;s individual freedoms, you know.</p>
<p>Khomeini was very clear about that.</p>
<p>It was about, you know, freeing Iran</p>
<p>from the yoke of this dictatorial leader</p>
<p>and freeing Iran from the yoke of this dictatorial regime.</p>
<p>Who had, you know, in the rhetoric of the revolution</p>
<p>at the time, sold the country, you know, to foreigners.</p>
<p>Okay, so then you go from&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna skip over, because I think it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>When we talk about the American hostages, for example,</p>
<p>or Reagan taking over and the freeing&hellip;</p>
<p>To me, this stuff is not as important</p>
<p>as something like the 1979, 1980 Iraq War, for example,</p>
<p>and something that Americans don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>anywhere near enough about.</p>
<p>As a military history-interested person,</p>
<p>growing up in that era, the Iran-Iraq War</p>
<p>was the largest thing we&rsquo;d seen in a long time.</p>
<p>Can you talk about it a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah, this was&hellip; You know, again, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We forget about this now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a war that is very deep in the consciousness of America.</p>
<p>No, poison gas was used, everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, this was&hellip;</p>
<p>But this was a generation-shaping,</p>
<p>formative experience for Iranians of the 1980s.</p>
<p>I mean, Iran had never&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, Iran had not, with the exception of&hellip;</p>
<p>Look, obviously, Iran had been invaded</p>
<p>and got sucked into the Second World War,</p>
<p>but with relatively few casualties.</p>
<p>In the First World War, there had been a lot of casualties,</p>
<p>but mostly from hunger and famine.</p>
<p>But you have to go back to the 1820s to find a war</p>
<p>that Iran was deeply involved with,</p>
<p>a lot of casualties, and even men.</p>
<p>You know, Iran had simply never experienced something like this,</p>
<p>where you had hundreds of thousands of people,</p>
<p>you know, boys, soldiers, child soldiers,</p>
<p>sent to the trenches, poison gas.</p>
<p>It was a First World War-style war</p>
<p>that killed hundreds of thousands of people on both sides,</p>
<p>both in Iraq and Iran.</p>
<p>And it was the first time that chemical weapons had been used</p>
<p>since the First World War, and it was devastating.</p>
<p>And it is something that stays very much with Iranians to this day.</p>
<p>You go to Iran, people are always, in the U.S.,</p>
<p>very fixated on Iran&rsquo;s relationship with the United States</p>
<p>and its antagonism to the U.S.</p>
<p>But its war with Iraq in the 1980s</p>
<p>shaped what Iran is today much more than its antagonism to the U.S.</p>
<p>And it continues to do that in many, many ways.</p>
<p>And you see it when you go to Iran.</p>
<p>The murals, yeah, there are a number of anti-American murals,</p>
<p>anti-Israeli murals, and so on.</p>
<p>But the vast majority of the murals painted on the walls</p>
<p>are commemorating martyrs of the Iran-Iraq War.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the really powerful experience.</p>
<p>And I think it continues to motivate Iran&rsquo;s thinking to this day</p>
<p>when it comes to issues like the nuclear program</p>
<p>that I write about at length in the book.</p>
<p>You know, I argue that actually the degree to which Iran</p>
<p>has sort of messed around with nuclear technology</p>
<p>has largely been out of its fear of Saddam Hussein up until 2000.</p>
<p>Well, and I don&rsquo;t think you can understand as an American</p>
<p>all of our involvement in the region in the 1990s</p>
<p>with Saddam Hussein without understanding the 1980s.</p>
<p>And I mean, Saddam Hussein was exactly the kind of guy</p>
<p>that normal U.S. foreign policy would have been in opposition of in the 1980s, right?</p>
<p>So we would have called it a Soviet client state.</p>
<p>And yet because of the problems we had in the late 70s, early 80s with Iran,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d rather back Saddam either openly or clandestinely</p>
<p>rather than the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how that turned out.</p>
<p>So let me ask then the next thing, which is we look at relatively recent times</p>
<p>with Iran and words like terrorism come up, Israel comes up,</p>
<p>the protests within Iran amongst a lot of times Iranian youth</p>
<p>and how those can get crushed.</p>
<p>So talk to me now a little bit about sort of, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>post-Iran-Iraq war aspects of Iran here.</p>
<p>So in other words, I want to find out how Iran&rsquo;s doing from you in a second.</p>
<p>But since the focus has shifted away from the Islamic Revolution</p>
<p>and Khomeini and hostages and all that, Iran, I just wrote down terrorism, Israel,</p>
<p>because when you look at it now, the unrest in the street, I mean, who was it?</p>
<p>It was the female martyr not that long ago who was shot.</p>
<p>I mean, it would seem to be that once again, now the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the position that the Shah was in in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>But that may be a reaction to Western news coverage</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t really reflect attitudes on the ground.</p>
<p>So maybe you could tell me a little bit about Israel, terrorism,</p>
<p>internal unrest in Iran.</p>
<p>And maybe, you know, we&rsquo;ve talked recently a lot about where,</p>
<p>in my other programs, where things are going in the 21st century</p>
<p>as opposed to the 20th.</p>
<p>How could we apply that to Iran?</p>
<p>How do you see this over the next couple of decades, maybe?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, those are all good questions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>Sure, no, no, no, no, no, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I think of them as interrelated, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Right, no, absolutely.</p>
<p>Look, as a historian, I&rsquo;m always a little uncomfortable</p>
<p>with kind of making predictions and thinking about the future,</p>
<p>because I tend to think much more about the past.</p>
<p>But, you know, I think if we look at Iran today,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no question the Islamic Republic is less popular</p>
<p>than it has been at any point in its history.</p>
<p>And there are many different reasons for that.</p>
<p>I mean, of course, the large,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s come under exceptional degrees</p>
<p>of kind of American-led pressure,</p>
<p>maximum pressure campaigns, sanctions,</p>
<p>I mean, the kinds of sanctions that have never been placed</p>
<p>on a country in peacetime.</p>
<p>I mean, the Iranian economy has been strained.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s an Axis of Evil country, right?</p>
<p>Right, but of course, that&rsquo;s not the only reason.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there are many reasons</p>
<p>why people dislike the system and the government,</p>
<p>you know, on its own terms.</p>
<p>And there are plenty of issues with corruption</p>
<p>and mismanagement, you know, and of course, repressiveness.</p>
<p>You know, so, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really tough time in Iran today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough time to be Iranian and to live in Iran.</p>
<p>So the economy is in desperate straits in many ways.</p>
<p>Inflation is very bad.</p>
<p>People are really struggling.</p>
<p>You know, and yet we have to be careful.</p>
<p>There is a fantasy narrative in the U.S.,</p>
<p>which is that, you know, when is this going to all collapse?</p>
<p>When is it all going to come crumbling down?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, I mean, it&rsquo;s just the Islamic Republic</p>
<p>is not a house of cards.</p>
<p>I mean, is it wildly popular among Iranian people?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the Iranian public,</p>
<p>like publics everywhere, you know,</p>
<p>has a wide range of opinions on a lot of things, you know,</p>
<p>and you go to Iran, you&rsquo;ll hear all kinds of different things.</p>
<p>People are angry with the government,</p>
<p>all kinds of different things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to hear a huge appetite for revolution</p>
<p>and regime change,</p>
<p>and certainly not kind of foreign-backed regime change.</p>
<p>Iranians are smart enough to realize that, you know,</p>
<p>the U.S. isn&rsquo;t pressuring the Iranian government</p>
<p>of trying to bring about regime change</p>
<p>because, you know, it&rsquo;s hard, you know,</p>
<p>the American government&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>kind of heart is bleeding for the Iranian people</p>
<p>or, you know, trying to, you know,</p>
<p>concerned about their human rights.</p>
<p>They know that.</p>
<p>They know that, you know, this is about geopolitics</p>
<p>and, you know, the fact that Iran, you know,</p>
<p>and American political interests are very much,</p>
<p>you know, do not align.</p>
<p>So they are going to be skeptical</p>
<p>of any kind of American-backed attempts</p>
<p>to kind of, you know, foment regime change</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve seen how that&rsquo;s gone in Syria,</p>
<p>in Libya, and other places in the region.</p>
<p>Nor is there an obvious opposition leader</p>
<p>that has any real kind of large-scale credibility.</p>
<p>And then, you know, as unpopular as it may be to say,</p>
<p>the Islamic Republic does have its supporters,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not small in number.</p>
<p>You know, people who have grown up</p>
<p>with this system of government</p>
<p>and who have been rewarded well from it</p>
<p>and have jobs and careers and, you know,</p>
<p>people who have been lifted out of poverty.</p>
<p>Now, as I say, all of that is true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also true that it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>at the lowest point of its popularity by far,</p>
<p>I think, of any point in the last 40 years.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>any minute now it&rsquo;s all going to come crashing down.</p>
<p>This is a fantasy that&rsquo;s constantly been peddled</p>
<p>since the very beginning of the Iranian revolution,</p>
<p>you know, this idea that, you know,</p>
<p>the Islamic Republic won&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>But it has lasted,</p>
<p>and without a lot of friends or allies around the world,</p>
<p>and under a lot of pressure in the U.S.</p>
<p>And I just think, you know,</p>
<p>people who are focused on bringing down the system</p>
<p>have to exist.</p>
<p>You have to accept the world as it is,</p>
<p>not as you want it to be.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m no fan of the Islamic Republic,</p>
<p>but, you know, I&rsquo;m not going to sit here</p>
<p>and try to cheerlead regime change</p>
<p>because that doesn&rsquo;t seem like a very realistic</p>
<p>kind of scenario.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m curious about the intrusion</p>
<p>of the outside world into some of these systems.</p>
<p>I was talking to somebody the other day</p>
<p>about whether or not the old Soviet Union</p>
<p>could have existed in a world</p>
<p>with the kind of communication we have now,</p>
<p>because, I mean, they used to freak out</p>
<p>over one radio signal from Radio Free Europe.</p>
<p>What would they do, you know, with Facebook</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>Um, how is Iran adjusting?</p>
<p>Because I know the Iranians tend to be,</p>
<p>on an individual level, very tech-interested.</p>
<p>How are they coping with the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>the outside world&hellip;</p>
<p>You had mentioned something in your book</p>
<p>that stuck with me, you had been talking about&hellip;</p>
<p>You mentioned disco, so it was like the 1970s,</p>
<p>and this was something that the Ayatollahs</p>
<p>were not thrilled about, as one might imagine</p>
<p>no conservative society would have been.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking to myself, forget about disco today.</p>
<p>I mean, what do the Iranian Ayatollahs</p>
<p>think about pornography online</p>
<p>that their people might be looking at?</p>
<p>I mean, how much does the fact that the outside world</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really be kept out anymore</p>
<p>impact a revolution that&rsquo;s trying to maintain</p>
<p>a certain, let&rsquo;s just say, moral standard for their people?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question. It&rsquo;s a tough question.</p>
<p>Uh, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Are they developing one of their own?</p>
<p>I mean, are they one of those countries</p>
<p>that are developing sort of an internal,</p>
<p>you know, internet of their own, kind of?</p>
<p>I vaguely remember something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, they were doing&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not a tech expert.</p>
<p>Me either.</p>
<p>I wonder how well that&rsquo;s ever going to work.</p>
<p>But, you know, look, the morality side of things,</p>
<p>morality police, things like the Ministry</p>
<p>of Islamic Education and Guidance,</p>
<p>these kinds of Orwellian things</p>
<p>sound very Orwellian to us.</p>
<p>They exist. They&rsquo;re reality.</p>
<p>There are things, you know, there are, you know,</p>
<p>morality police that go around and, you know,</p>
<p>cash their shot, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>and kind of check on the way people are dressed</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>And, you know, there are things you&rsquo;re not allowed</p>
<p>to do in Iran.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just, like, be out there dancing</p>
<p>in the streets and so on,</p>
<p>going to discos and alcohol and whatever.</p>
<p>But the reality is that all of that stuff</p>
<p>goes on very much behind closed doors in Iran,</p>
<p>and the government is well aware of that</p>
<p>and, frankly, doesn&rsquo;t really care that much.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not to say that a lot of these,</p>
<p>you know, religious clerics who run the show like it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not motivated by that</p>
<p>in the way that the revolutionaries</p>
<p>were in the 1970s.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re motivated by is realpolitik</p>
<p>and staying in power and survival</p>
<p>and strengthening the system, you know,</p>
<p>avoiding these kind of, you know,</p>
<p>kind of these foreign-backed regime change plots</p>
<p>and so on and, you know, staying in power</p>
<p>and doing what they&rsquo;re doing just enough</p>
<p>to make sure people feel like they can live the life</p>
<p>that they want to live and participate</p>
<p>just a little bit in politics</p>
<p>while also preserving, you know, control</p>
<p>and their own kind of survival as a system.</p>
<p>The fact is that, you know,</p>
<p>they know that people are out there having,</p>
<p>you know, alcohol-fueled parties</p>
<p>and dances in North Tehran and so on.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re not going to barge into people&rsquo;s houses.</p>
<p>You know, they feel like, you know,</p>
<p>as long as people feel like they can do that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re less likely to cause problems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really worried about these, you know,</p>
<p>these kinds of very westernized elites in North Tehran</p>
<p>because, you know, what they&rsquo;re more worried about right now</p>
<p>is the fact that these sanctions have made life</p>
<p>very difficult for their traditional support base,</p>
<p>which is the poor, both rural and urban poor,</p>
<p>and who are really suffering a lot under these sanctions,</p>
<p>much more than the wealthy and the westernized elites.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more scary for them.</p>
<p>You know, I can&rsquo;t help but think that we would give</p>
<p>our right arm now in the West</p>
<p>to have a viable Mohamed Mozadek</p>
<p>that we could support as an alternative</p>
<p>to the current leadership.</p>
<p>Is something like that ever possible,</p>
<p>the way that the system&rsquo;s been constructed there</p>
<p>in terms of outsiders or non-religiously approved</p>
<p>candidates getting a chance to participate?</p>
<p>Is there a chance to have a Mohamed Mozadek,</p>
<p>somebody who we would call, you would call it</p>
<p>a liberal, democratic, moderate, reformer type,</p>
<p>or is that something that&rsquo;s been sort of sealed off</p>
<p>by the design of the system?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s in the cards now.</p>
<p>I think that the closest we came to that</p>
<p>in the period between 1997 and 2005</p>
<p>during the reformist presidency of Mohamed Khatami,</p>
<p>who was seen in many ways as a liberal,</p>
<p>reform-minded, constitutionalist kind of president,</p>
<p>but who operated within, he was a cleric himself,</p>
<p>who operated within the religious system.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of excitement about that</p>
<p>and what that might hold,</p>
<p>what kind of promise that might hold for the future of Iran.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t work out,</p>
<p>both for internal and external reasons.</p>
<p>I think in recent years, but there have been more attempts.</p>
<p>There have been, the last president was more kind of</p>
<p>centrist and reform-minded in some ways,</p>
<p>and there have been, the movement wasn&rsquo;t snuffed out</p>
<p>completely after 2005.</p>
<p>But I have to say, recently,</p>
<p>since the withdrawal of the US from the JCPOA,</p>
<p>from the nuclear deal in 2018,</p>
<p>and the maximum pressure campaign</p>
<p>of the Trump administration,</p>
<p>that has had a pretty powerful impact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really helped entrench hard-line elements of Iran</p>
<p>in a way that we haven&rsquo;t seen in a very long time,</p>
<p>because that just made it very easy</p>
<p>for hard-line elements to say to,</p>
<p>you see, you can&rsquo;t trust the United States,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t trust these guys,</p>
<p>because it was a more centrist, reformist government</p>
<p>that negotiated that deal.</p>
<p>And they were embarrassed, they were humiliated</p>
<p>by the withdrawal of the United States.</p>
<p>They brought sanctions relief,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this feeling that there&rsquo;s a whole new era now,</p>
<p>and everything looks different,</p>
<p>and you see you can&rsquo;t do a deal with the US.</p>
<p>But it only lasted three years,</p>
<p>and when the Trump administration withdrew,</p>
<p>it just handed a huge political victory</p>
<p>to conservative hard-line elements.</p>
<p>They said, look, forget about it.</p>
<p>These guys were duped.</p>
<p>They were the fools of the West,</p>
<p>and of the United States.</p>
<p>One of the disadvantages dealing with democratic systems</p>
<p>is that one president could have a different attitude</p>
<p>from the previous one.</p>
<p>So, let me ask you, was there anything</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t ask you about in this conversation</p>
<p>that I should have, or that&rsquo;s relevant here</p>
<p>that we should be talking about?</p>
<p>I mean, I could talk for hours,</p>
<p>but I think you hit on some great highlights,</p>
<p>and those are some great questions.</p>
<p>So, I really enjoyed the conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>and you get so tired of the same questions.</p>
<p>So, if I could have asked you a few different things,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll call it a minor victory,</p>
<p>and hopefully we didn&rsquo;t bore you.</p>
<p>This was wonderful.</p>
<p>The subject matter is fascinating,</p>
<p>and I hope we sell you a few books.</p>
<p>So, we will send you a link when the show is out,</p>
<p>and anything, I mean, listen, man,</p>
<p>if I can do any favors for you in the future,</p>
<p>or help you out in any way, please let me know.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re helping me out quite a bit by helping</p>
<p>to spread the word about the book.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>That means a lot, and I appreciate your questions,</p>
<p>because, I mean, honestly, it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve read the book, and you have some great,</p>
<p>you know, you kind of really engage with it,</p>
<p>and it has some great questions, so I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I love the topic. Thank you so much for coming on</p>
<p>and taking the time. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dan.</p>
<p>My thanks to John Guzvinian for coming on the program.</p>
<p>His new book, America and Iran,</p>
<p>a history 1720 to the present, is presently available.</p>
<p>Pick up your copy and find out all the answers</p>
<p>to all the questions that in a nearly hour</p>
<p>and 20-minute interview, I didn&rsquo;t manage to get to somehow.</p>
<p>Anyway, he was a wonderful guy to talk to,</p>
<p>and the subject is fascinating.</p>
<p>For those who wonder where the next Hardcore History Show</p>
<p>is, the big one, we are working on it,</p>
<p>and like the famous, you know, multiple stages of grief,</p>
<p>there is the multiple stages</p>
<p>of Hardcore History Show production.</p>
<p>We are currently at the stage where we have hours of it</p>
<p>in the can, and you look at it and go,</p>
<p>now, what the heck do we have here?</p>
<p>Is any of this any good?</p>
<p>And so, we&rsquo;ll, you know, get through the subsequent stages</p>
<p>and get it to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>What I always tell people is, all of the carrots and sticks</p>
<p>in this business are lined up towards releasing more content.</p>
<p>So, we have every incentive.</p>
<p>You know, we just fail miserably.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience, everybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to talking with you more soon.</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>

<p>Hey, everyone, back for one quick second</p>
<p>to talk again about Battle Guide Virtual Tours.</p>
<p>You may have heard me bring them up before.</p>
<p>Um, I hooked up with these guys during the first bit of COVID</p>
<p>when they were doing live tours of places like battlefields</p>
<p>in France and everything, and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re shut down.</p>
<p>And this is the way they figured out how to pivot</p>
<p>from that, as so many other business owners</p>
<p>have had to figure out what to do in the same circumstances.</p>
<p>And I love the way these guys did it.</p>
<p>They converted the battlefield tours into virtual things,</p>
<p>and it allowed them to utilize a bunch of different</p>
<p>elements that obviously wouldn&rsquo;t have been available</p>
<p>in a live situation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying this is superior to a live situation.</p>
<p>They both have their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>What I am saying is if you save up all the money</p>
<p>as an American to go to northern France</p>
<p>and walk these battlefields, first of all,</p>
<p>there will be things missing that you won&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have to come home and read about later,</p>
<p>which you get as part of these Battle Guide Virtual Tours</p>
<p>when you do those, but how likely are you next week</p>
<p>after you get home from what would be an expensive</p>
<p>and long trip to France to do this,</p>
<p>to want to go to Russia and visit Stalingrad, right?</p>
<p>But you do that in a virtual sense.</p>
<p>You can go on a different, you know,</p>
<p>battlefield tour every day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different ways to access them, by the way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a live version, which you can be a part of it online</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re doing it live and the historian is there</p>
<p>and you can ask questions and all kinds of things like that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a real-time thing, but then that goes,</p>
<p>you know, into the archives and is available for you</p>
<p>to download anytime, anywhere, right?</p>
<p>As a sort of a hard copy version.</p>
<p>And you can buy those individually,</p>
<p>you can sign up for a subscription service</p>
<p>and access all of them and they have new ones all the time.</p>
<p>I just think if you&rsquo;re a military history fan,</p>
<p>this is a gimme kind of thing,</p>
<p>and especially for a gift for people that you may know</p>
<p>who are also military history fans.</p>
<p>This is a fun thing and it&rsquo;s worth trying</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;d like to just try it and get 50% off,</p>
<p>you can go to battleguide.co.uk forward slash Dan hyphen Carlin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s battleguide.co.uk forward slash Dan hyphen Carlin</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get 50% off any one of the currently up</p>
<p>on the archive tours. See what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re talking about something that combines,</p>
<p>you know, technology like drone images, 360 and satellite imagery,</p>
<p>on the ground video, veteran accounts,</p>
<p>period footage, photographs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting mix of things that if you are interested</p>
<p>in this kind of stuff, manages to illuminate</p>
<p>the complexity of these battlefields in ways</p>
<p>that is difficult to conceptualize in any other situation.</p>
<p>Those of you out there who&rsquo;ve read books,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve looked at maps, who&rsquo;ve seen movies,</p>
<p>you try to get a mental image of things.</p>
<p>This is one of the best ways I&rsquo;ve ever discovered to do it.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll check it out.</p>
