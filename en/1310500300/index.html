    <p>I think that some people are deliberately trying</p>
<p>to completely clear the cultural landscape of our past</p>
<p>in order to say there&rsquo;s nothing good,</p>
<p>nothing you can hold on to, no one you should revere,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got no heroes, the whole thing comes down,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s left standing, oh, we&rsquo;ve also got this idea</p>
<p>from the 20th century still about Marxism,</p>
<p>and no, no, I will not have the entire landscape</p>
<p>deracinated, and then the worst ideas tried again.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Douglas Murray,</p>
<p>author of The Madness of Crowds, Gender, Race, and Identity,</p>
<p>and his most recent book, The War on the West,</p>
<p>How to Prevail in the Age of Unreason.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a brilliant, fearless, and often controversial thinker</p>
<p>who points out and pushes back against what he sees</p>
<p>as the madness of our modern world.</p>
<p>I should note that the use of the word Marxism</p>
<p>and the West in this conversation refers primarily</p>
<p>to cultural Marxism and the cultural values</p>
<p>of Western civilization, respectively.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to my previous conversation</p>
<p>with Richard Wolff, where we focused on Marxism</p>
<p>as primarily a critique of capitalism,</p>
<p>and thus looking at it through the lens</p>
<p>of economics and not culture.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these two episodes stand opposite</p>
<p>of each other with very different perspectives</p>
<p>on how we build a flourishing civilization together.</p>
<p>I leave it to you, the listener, to think</p>
<p>and to decide which is the better way.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Douglas Murray.</p>
<p>You recently wrote the book titled The War on the West,</p>
<p>which in part says that the values, ideas,</p>
<p>and history of Western civilization are under attack.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with the basics.</p>
<p>Historically and today, what are the ideas</p>
<p>that represent Western civilization?</p>
<p>The good, the bad, the ugly.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t get stuck on definitions,</p>
<p>precisely because, as you know, once you get stuck</p>
<p>on definitions, there&rsquo;s a possibility</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never get off them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say a few things.</p>
<p>Firstly, obviously the Western tradition</p>
<p>is a specific tradition, a specific tradition</p>
<p>of ideas, culture, well known to be, perhaps,</p>
<p>easily defined by the combination of Athens</p>
<p>and Jerusalem, the world of the Bible,</p>
<p>and the world of ancient Greece and, indeed, Rome.</p>
<p>Effectively, it creates European civilization,</p>
<p>which itself spawns the rest of the Western civilizations,</p>
<p>America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and others.</p>
<p>But these are the main countries</p>
<p>that we still refer to as the West.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a specific tradition</p>
<p>and all the things that come from it.</p>
<p>My shorthand cheat on this answer is to say,</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re not in it.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve ever been to Beijing, Shanghai,</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re not in the West.</p>
<p>Somewhere else, you know you&rsquo;re not in the West.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in Tokyo, you&rsquo;re somewhere extraordinary,</p>
<p>but you know you&rsquo;re not in the West.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are, let&rsquo;s say, borderline questions,</p>
<p>like is Russia in the West,</p>
<p>which I sort of leave open as a question.</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>Well, if you were placed into Moscow blindfolded</p>
<p>and you woke up and you couldn&rsquo;t hear the language,</p>
<p>or maybe you didn&rsquo;t know what the language sounded like,</p>
<p>would you guess you were in the West or not?</p>
<p>I think I was somewhere near it.</p>
<p>Getting closer.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s also a question, doesn&rsquo;t it,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s European.</p>
<p>And I think the answer to that is not really,</p>
<p>although massively influenced by Europe,</p>
<p>but, and times wanting to reach towards it,</p>
<p>at times wanting to stay away,</p>
<p>but a part of the West, possibly, yes.</p>
<p>But anyway, it&rsquo;s a very specific tradition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of a number of major traditions in the world,</p>
<p>and because it&rsquo;s hard to define</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t exist, you know.</p>
<p>Are there certain characteristics and qualities</p>
<p>about the values and the ideas that define it?</p>
<p>Is the type of rule, the type of governmental structure?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, the rule of law, property owning democracies,</p>
<p>and much more, I mean, these are, of course,</p>
<p>things that ended up being developed in America</p>
<p>and then given back to much of the rest of the West.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say there are other,</p>
<p>perhaps more controversial attributes</p>
<p>I would give to the West.</p>
<p>One is a ravenous interest in the rest of the world,</p>
<p>which is not shared, of course, by every other culture.</p>
<p>The late philosopher George Steiner</p>
<p>who said he could never get out of his head</p>
<p>the haunting fact that the boats</p>
<p>only seemed to go out from Europe.</p>
<p>You know, the explorers, the scholars, the linguists,</p>
<p>the people who wanted to discover other civilizations,</p>
<p>and indeed, even resurrect ancient civilizations</p>
<p>and lost civilizations.</p>
<p>These were scholars that were always coming from the West</p>
<p>to discover this elsewhere.</p>
<p>By contrast, you know, there were never boats</p>
<p>coming from Egypt to help the Anglo Saxons</p>
<p>discover the origins of their language and so on.</p>
<p>So I think there is a sort of ravenous interest</p>
<p>in the rest of the world,</p>
<p>which can be said to be a Western.</p>
<p>Attribute, although it, of course,</p>
<p>also has, one should immediately preface it,</p>
<p>some downsides and many criticisms</p>
<p>that can be made of some of the consequences</p>
<p>of that interest.</p>
<p>Because, of course, it&rsquo;s not entirely lacking</p>
<p>in self interest.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the scholars, it&rsquo;s also.</p>
<p>The armies.</p>
<p>The armies, and they&rsquo;re looking to gain access</p>
<p>and control over resources elsewhere.</p>
<p>To market.</p>
<p>And hence the imperial imperative.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>To conquer, to expand.</p>
<p>Although that itself, of course, is a universal thing.</p>
<p>I mean, no civilization, I think, that we know of</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t try to gain ground from its neighbors where it can.</p>
<p>The Western ability to go further faster</p>
<p>certainly gave an advantage in that regard.</p>
<p>Do some civilizations get a bit more excited</p>
<p>by that kind of idea than others?</p>
<p>Possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Because you could say it&rsquo;s the Western civilization</p>
<p>because the technological innovation was more efficient</p>
<p>at doing that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But maybe it wanted it more, too.</p>
<p>Well, the Ottomans wanted it an awful lot</p>
<p>and did very terribly well for many centuries,</p>
<p>and one shouldn&rsquo;t forget that, as did others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also say, by the way, and again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very broad one, but it&rsquo;s worth throwing out there.</p>
<p>I think self criticism is an important attribute</p>
<p>of the Western mind, one that, as you know,</p>
<p>is not common everywhere.</p>
<p>Not all societies allow even their most vociferous critics</p>
<p>to become rich.</p>
<p>So criticism is a negative sounding word.</p>
<p>It could be self introspection, self analysis,</p>
<p>self reflection.</p>
<p>And it can be what you need.</p>
<p>And in the Western system, I&rsquo;d argue that one of the</p>
<p>advantages of the system of representative governance</p>
<p>is that where there are problems in the system,</p>
<p>you can attempt to sort them out by peaceable means.</p>
<p>We listen to arguments, most famously in America</p>
<p>in the late 20th century, the civil rights movement</p>
<p>achieved its aims by force of moral argument</p>
<p>and dissuaded the rest of the country</p>
<p>that it had been wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not common in every society by any means.</p>
<p>So I think there are certain attributes of the Western mind</p>
<p>that you could say are, they&rsquo;re not entirely unique,</p>
<p>but they are not as commonplace elsewhere.</p>
<p>What about the emergence in hierarchies of asymmetry</p>
<p>of power, most visible, most drastic in the form of slavery,</p>
<p>for example?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, everyone in the world is slavery,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t regard it as being a Western,</p>
<p>a unique Western sin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rather hard to think of a civilization in history</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t have slavery of some kind.</p>
<p>One of the oddities of the Western ignorance of our day</p>
<p>is that people seem to imagine that our societies</p>
<p>in the West were the only ones who ever engaged</p>
<p>in any vices.</p>
<p>Alas, this isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sort of Rousseauian mistake,</p>
<p>or at least one that&rsquo;s blossomed since Rousseau,</p>
<p>that everybody else in the world was born</p>
<p>into sort of Edenic innocence,</p>
<p>and only we in the West had this sort of evil in us</p>
<p>that caused us to do bad things to other people.</p>
<p>Slavery was engaged in by everyone in the ancient world,</p>
<p>of course, and through most of the modern world as well.</p>
<p>Of course, there are 40 million slaves in the world today,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s clearly not something that the species as a whole</p>
<p>has a problem with.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s more slaves, of course,</p>
<p>than there were in the 19th century.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, on top of that, that the interesting thing</p>
<p>about the Western mind as regards to slavery</p>
<p>is that we were the civilization that did away with it.</p>
<p>And by the way, the founding fathers of America,</p>
<p>who today are lambasted routinely</p>
<p>for being acquiescent in the slave trade,</p>
<p>engaging in it, owning slaves.</p>
<p>People almost don&rsquo;t even bother now to recognize the facts</p>
<p>that Thomas Jefferson, George Washington,</p>
<p>all wanted to see this trade done away with,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t hold the country together at the origins</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;d have made such an effort.</p>
<p>And believed and hoped that it would be something</p>
<p>that would be dealt with after their time.</p>
<p>So the founding ideas had within them the notion</p>
<p>that we should, as a people, get rid of this.</p>
<p>The opening lines of the Declaration of Independence</p>
<p>set up the conditions under which slavery</p>
<p>will be impossible.</p>
<p>All men are created equal.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve put that, that&rsquo;s a time bomb</p>
<p>under the whole concept of slavery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ticking away, okay.</p>
<p>And sure enough, it detonated in the next century.</p>
<p>If we just step back and look at the human species,</p>
<p>what does slavery teach you about human nature?</p>
<p>The fact that slavery has appeared</p>
<p>as a function of society throughout human history.</p>
<p>There are two possibilities.</p>
<p>One is it&rsquo;s what people think they can do</p>
<p>when God&rsquo;s not watching.</p>
<p>Another is it&rsquo;s what they can do</p>
<p>if they think that God allows it.</p>
<p>Really, really well put.</p>
<p>And the fact that they want to do this kind of subjugation,</p>
<p>what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward in a way.</p>
<p>There are people who get to work for free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s economic in nature in some sense.</p>
<p>Yes, but in order to do it,</p>
<p>I mean, almost always there are some examples</p>
<p>in the ancient world where this wasn&rsquo;t the case,</p>
<p>but almost always it had to be a subjugated people</p>
<p>or people that are regarded as different.</p>
<p>One of the things actually I&rsquo;ve tried to sort of inject</p>
<p>into the discussion through this book among other things</p>
<p>is a recognition that there were very major questions</p>
<p>still going on in the 18th and early 19th century</p>
<p>that were unresolved, which were one of the reasons</p>
<p>why slavery was not as morally repugnant</p>
<p>to people then as it is to us now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the question of polygenesis and monogenesis.</p>
<p>At the time of Thomas Jefferson,</p>
<p>the founding fathers were thinking and working.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know because nobody knew</p>
<p>whether the human races were related or not.</p>
<p>There were arguments, the monogenesis argument</p>
<p>that we were all indeed from the same racial stock.</p>
<p>Polygenesis argument was that we weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Black Africans, Ethiopians,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re often referred to at the time</p>
<p>because they provided some of the first slaves,</p>
<p>were different from white Europeans,</p>
<p>simply not related in any way.</p>
<p>And that makes it easier, of course.</p>
<p>That makes it easier to enslave people</p>
<p>if you think they&rsquo;re not your brother.</p>
<p>Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s not your brother, and it&rsquo;s a very,</p>
<p>it was a very troubling argument in the 18th, 19th century,</p>
<p>also because there was a biblical question.</p>
<p>It threw up a theological question, which was,</p>
<p>I mean, people were literally debating this at the time.</p>
<p>Was there also a black Adam and Eve?</p>
<p>Was there, as it were, an Indian Adam and Eve,</p>
<p>a Native American Adam and Eve?</p>
<p>This was a serious theological debate</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t know the answer.</p>
<p>People say that Darwin solved this.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just Darwin, of course,</p>
<p>but by the late 19th century,</p>
<p>the argument that we were not all related</p>
<p>as human beings had suffered so many blows</p>
<p>that you had to really be very, very ignorant,</p>
<p>deliberately, willfully ignorant to ignore it by then.</p>
<p>So it no longer was, after Darwin, a theological question.</p>
<p>It became a moral question.</p>
<p>It was already a moral question, but it clarified,</p>
<p>Darwin clarifies it definitely,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re in this, as I say, in this situation</p>
<p>of you&rsquo;re not subjugating some other people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re subjugating your own kin,</p>
<p>and that becomes morally unsustainable.</p>
<p>So given that slavery in America</p>
<p>is part of its history,</p>
<p>how do we incorporate into the calculus of policy today,</p>
<p>social discourse, what we learn in school?</p>
<p>We can look at slavery in America.</p>
<p>We can look at maybe more recent things,</p>
<p>like in Europe, the other atrocities, the Holocaust.</p>
<p>How do we incorporate that in terms of</p>
<p>how we create policy, how we treat each other,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>What is the calculus of integrating the atrocities,</p>
<p>the injustices of the past into the way we are today?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very complex question,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a moral question at this point,</p>
<p>and a moral question long after the fact.</p>
<p>I say at one point in the War on the West</p>
<p>that the argument, for instance, on reparations now</p>
<p>that goes on, and it&rsquo;s not a fringe argument anymore.</p>
<p>Some people say, oh, you&rsquo;re pulling up this fringe argument.</p>
<p>It really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, every contender for the Democratic nomination</p>
<p>for the presidency in 2020 was willing to talk</p>
<p>about the possibility of reparations.</p>
<p>Some very eager that this country, America,</p>
<p>goes through that entirely self destructive exercise.</p>
<p>I say that there&rsquo;s a lot of problems with this,</p>
<p>but if I could refine it down to one thing, I&rsquo;d say this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer about a wealth transfer</p>
<p>from one group of people who did something wrong</p>
<p>to another group of people who were wronged.</p>
<p>It would have been that, could have been that</p>
<p>200 years ago.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s not even the descendants of people</p>
<p>who did something wrong giving money to people</p>
<p>who were the descendants of people who were wronged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wealth transfer from people who look like people</p>
<p>who did a wrong thing in the past to another group</p>
<p>of people who resemble people who were wronged.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s impossible to do, and I&rsquo;m completely clear</p>
<p>about this.</p>
<p>There is no way in which you could organize</p>
<p>such a wealth transfer on moral or practical reasons.</p>
<p>America is filled with people who have the same skin color</p>
<p>as us, for instance, who have no connection</p>
<p>to the slave trade and should not be made to pay money</p>
<p>to people who have some connection.</p>
<p>And then the country&rsquo;s also filled with ethnic minorities</p>
<p>who have come after slavery who would not be due</p>
<p>for any reimbursement, as it were.</p>
<p>The problem with this is, though, is that there are,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m perfectly open to the possibility</p>
<p>that there are residual inequities</p>
<p>that exist in American life</p>
<p>and that the consequences of slavery</p>
<p>could be one of the factors that result from this.</p>
<p>The thing is, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a single issue answer.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a multidimensional issue,</p>
<p>something like black underachievement in America.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously a multidimensional issue.</p>
<p>Much of the left and others wish to say it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only about racism.</p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t answer why Asians who&rsquo;ve arrived</p>
<p>more recently don&rsquo;t, for instance,</p>
<p>get held down by white supremacy.</p>
<p>But actually, I say white supremacy in quotes, obviously.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t get held back by it, but actually flourish</p>
<p>to the extent that Asian Americans</p>
<p>have higher household earnings</p>
<p>and higher household mean equity than,</p>
<p>home equity and so on, than white Americans.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that on the merits the evidence is there</p>
<p>that racism is the explanation for black,</p>
<p>ongoing black underachievement in some sections</p>
<p>of the black community in America.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously a part of it.</p>
<p>Could you say that even those things like fatherlessness</p>
<p>and similar family breakdown issues</p>
<p>are a longterm consequence of it?</p>
<p>Possibly, but it&rsquo;s being often said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being awfully generous to people&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to make bad decisions.</p>
<p>For instance, how many generations after the Holocaust</p>
<p>would you allow people to claim that everything</p>
<p>that went wrong in the Jewish community</p>
<p>was as a result of the Holocaust?</p>
<p>I mean, is there some kind of term limit on this?</p>
<p>I would have thought so.</p>
<p>And I think most people probably think that&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>I think the details matter there, but it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in deep waters, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, I enjoy swimming out in the ocean,</p>
<p>so although I&rsquo;m terrified of what&rsquo;s lurking</p>
<p>underneath in the darkness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right to be.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s really complicated calculus</p>
<p>with the Holocaust and with slavery.</p>
<p>So the argument in America is that there&rsquo;s deep</p>
<p>institutional racism against African Americans</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rooted in slavery.</p>
<p>And so however that calculus turns out,</p>
<p>that calculation, it still persists in the culture,</p>
<p>in the institutions, in the allocation of resources,</p>
<p>in the way that we communicate, in subtle ways,</p>
<p>in major ways, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>How is it possible to win or lose that argument</p>
<p>of how much institutional racism there is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rooted in slavery?</p>
<p>Is it a winnable?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unquantifiable argument.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to apply some shortcuts</p>
<p>to some of this, the following.</p>
<p>Are, for instance, all, let&rsquo;s take the EVV1</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most often cited.</p>
<p>If a white person is walking down a street in America</p>
<p>and they see a group of young black men</p>
<p>coming towards them and it&rsquo;s late at night</p>
<p>and they cross the road, is it because of slavery?</p>
<p>Is it because of institutional racism?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve made a calculus</p>
<p>based not entirely on unfounded beliefs</p>
<p>that given crime rates, it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that this group of people might be a group of people</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to meet late at night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an ugly fact, but as crime statistics</p>
<p>in American cities after American cities bear out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an entirely unreasonable one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not reasonable every time, obviously, obviously.</p>
<p>But is it attributable to slavery?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a stretch.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a city like Chicago</p>
<p>where the homicide rates shot up in the last two years,</p>
<p>albeit again, as always has to be remembered,</p>
<p>mainly black on black gun violence and knife violence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you&rsquo;re in a city like Chicago</p>
<p>and you make that calculus I&rsquo;ve just suggested,</p>
<p>the cliched one, the street late at night,</p>
<p>there are other factors other than that.</p>
<p>Factors other than a memory of slavery that kick in.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s something which people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to particularly acknowledge in America</p>
<p>for obvious reasons, because it&rsquo;s the ugliest</p>
<p>damn debate in the world.</p>
<p>But I was actually just writing in my column</p>
<p>in New York Post today about a very interesting case</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of similar, which is the question</p>
<p>of obesity in the US.</p>
<p>As you know, America&rsquo;s the most overweight country</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>America has, I think, 40% of the population is obese</p>
<p>in medical ways, and the nearest next country</p>
<p>is a long way down, that&rsquo;s New Zealand,</p>
<p>at 30% of the population.</p>
<p>So America&rsquo;s a long way ahead.</p>
<p>Why during the coronavirus era when we know</p>
<p>that obesity is the one clearest factor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s likely to lead to your hospitalization</p>
<p>if you also get the virus?</p>
<p>Why did almost no public health information</p>
<p>in America focus on obesity?</p>
<p>80% of the people who ended up hospitalized</p>
<p>in America with coronavirus were obese.</p>
<p>We locked the schools when there was no evidence</p>
<p>that the coronavirus was deadly for children.</p>
<p>We all wore cloth masks when there was</p>
<p>a very little evidence that this was much use</p>
<p>in stopping the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>We had massive evidence about obesity being a problem,</p>
<p>and we never addressed it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Is it just because we worried about fat people?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s actually because about fat shaming, as it were.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s also because to a great extent</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a racial issue in America as well.</p>
<p>And actually I quoted this new publication</p>
<p>from the University of Chicago, as it happens,</p>
<p>which makes that claim explicit, says,</p>
<p>the reasons why people have views that are negative</p>
<p>about obesity is because of racism and slavery.</p>
<p>This is what everything is drawn back to in America.</p>
<p>Anything you want to stop, you say it&rsquo;s because of racism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of slavery.</p>
<p>How about it&rsquo;s actually because you mind</p>
<p>the hospitals getting clogged up,</p>
<p>you mind people dying,</p>
<p>you mind ethnic minorities disproportionately dying,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d like to say something about it.</p>
<p>Once again, as in everything in America,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cut off by some poorly educated academic</p>
<p>saying it&rsquo;s about slavery.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re really not, I mean, this requires</p>
<p>a kind of form of brain surgery to perform it on a society,</p>
<p>probably one that&rsquo;s not possible without killing the patient.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s being done by people who are wearing mittens.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure that there&rsquo;s a few folks listening to this</p>
<p>that are rolling their eyes and saying,</p>
<p>here we go again, two white guys talking about</p>
<p>the lack of institutional racism in America.</p>
<p>First of all, what would you like to tell them?</p>
<p>So our African American friends who are looking at this,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to talk to a bunch of them</p>
<p>on Clubhouse recently.</p>
<p>Clubhouse is this social app.</p>
<p>And I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolute zoo of an app as far as I can see it.</p>
<p>I personally love it because you get to talk to,</p>
<p>as somebody who&rsquo;s an introvert and doesn&rsquo;t socialize much,</p>
<p>I enjoy talking to people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>So it gave me a chance to first of all practice</p>
<p>Russian and Ukrainian, so I get the chance to do that.</p>
<p>Then you get a chance to talk about Israel and Palestine</p>
<p>with people who are from that part of the world.</p>
<p>And you get to hear raw emotion of people from the ground</p>
<p>where they start screaming, they start crying,</p>
<p>they start being calm and collected and thoughtful.</p>
<p>And this is as if you walked into a bar</p>
<p>with custom picked regular folks, in quotes, regular folks.</p>
<p>Just people that have, quote unquote, lived experiences.</p>
<p>Real pain, real hope, real emotions, biases,</p>
<p>and you get to listen to them go at it.</p>
<p>With no, because it&rsquo;s an audio app,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed to start getting</p>
<p>into a physical fist fight.</p>
<p>So even though it really sounds like people want it.</p>
<p>It sounds like it&rsquo;s happening, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so you get to really listen to that feeling.</p>
<p>And for example, it allows a white guy like me</p>
<p>from another part of the world,</p>
<p>coming from the former Soviet Union,</p>
<p>to go into a room with a few hundred African Americans</p>
<p>screaming about Joe Rogan using the N word.</p>
<p>And I get to really listen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very different perspectives on that</p>
<p>in the African American community,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fascinating to listen.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t get access to that by excellent books</p>
<p>and articles written and so on.</p>
<p>You get that real raw emotion.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just saying, there&rsquo;s a few of those folks</p>
<p>listening to this with that real raw emotion.</p>
<p>And one argument they say is you, Douglas Murray,</p>
<p>and you, Lex Freeman, don&rsquo;t have the right</p>
<p>to talk about race and racism in America.</p>
<p>It is our struggle.</p>
<p>You are from a privileged class of people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be a black man</p>
<p>or woman in America walking down the street.</p>
<p>Can you steel man that case?</p>
<p>First of all, fuck that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, I think we need to define steel, steel manning.</p>
<p>Okay, I know what steel manning is.</p>
<p>I really resent that form of argumentation.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I really resent it.</p>
<p>I have the right to talk about whatever the hell I want,</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s gonna stop me or try to intimidate me</p>
<p>or tell me that I can&rsquo;t simply because of my skin color.</p>
<p>And I think that if I said to somebody else</p>
<p>the other way around, it would be equally reprehensible.</p>
<p>If I said, shut up, you have no right</p>
<p>to criticize anything that Douglas Murray says</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve not got my skin color.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s not an exact comparison, but seriously,</p>
<p>is that a reasonable form of argument?</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t been through everything</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through in my life, therefore you can&rsquo;t comment.</p>
<p>No, in that case, nobody can talk about anything.</p>
<p>We might as well pack up, go home, and isolate ourselves.</p>
<p>Strong words, but can you try to steel man the case,</p>
<p>not in this particular situation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s people that have lived through something</p>
<p>that can comment in a very specific way,</p>
<p>like for example, Holocaust survivors.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There is a sense in which, maybe a basic sense of civility</p>
<p>when a Holocaust survivor is speaking about</p>
<p>their experience of the Holocaust,</p>
<p>then an intellectual from a very different part of the world</p>
<p>is simply writing about nuanced geopolitics of World War II</p>
<p>just should not interrupt the Holocaust survivor.</p>
<p>We physically interrupt them</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re telling their stories.</p>
<p>No, with words, with logic and reason</p>
<p>that the experience of the Holocaust survivor</p>
<p>somehow fundamentally has a deeper understanding</p>
<p>of the humanity and the injustice of the.</p>
<p>First of all, again, we&rsquo;re in even deeper waters now,</p>
<p>but in terms of wanting to listen to another person</p>
<p>who has experienced something, yes, yes.</p>
<p>But not endlessly, not endlessly.</p>
<p>I mean, there are some people who&rsquo;ve written about,</p>
<p>I mean, there are people who&rsquo;ve written about the Holocaust</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t experience the Holocaust</p>
<p>and have written about it better than people who did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not this idea that the lived experience</p>
<p>to use this terrible modern jargon</p>
<p>as if there&rsquo;s another type.</p>
<p>This idea that the lived experience</p>
<p>has to triumph over everything else is not always correct.</p>
<p>It can be correct in some circumstances.</p>
<p>If you are sitting in a room with a Holocaust survivor</p>
<p>and somebody who&rsquo;d never heard about the Holocaust</p>
<p>and wanted to kind of shoot out their views on it, yeah,</p>
<p>one of those people should be heard more than the other,</p>
<p>obviously, obviously.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s experienced racism firsthand</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s somebody else who has never experienced it,</p>
<p>then obviously you&rsquo;d want to hear from the person</p>
<p>who has experienced it firsthand,</p>
<p>if that is the discussion underway.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>that that is endlessly the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also highly reluctant to concede</p>
<p>that there are groups of people</p>
<p>who by dint of their skin color or anything else</p>
<p>get to dominate the microphone.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we&rsquo;re literally both speaking</p>
<p>to microphones at the moment, so there&rsquo;s an irony to this,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s skate over the irony.</p>
<p>What I mean is people saying,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the right to speak,</p>
<p>I have the right to take the microphone from you</p>
<p>and speak because I know best.</p>
<p>Fine, if you know best, we&rsquo;ll argue it out</p>
<p>and someone will win, long or short term.</p>
<p>But the almost aggressive tone</p>
<p>in which this is now leveled, I don&rsquo;t like the sound of,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s experience is completely understandable</p>
<p>by another human being, nobody&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And what many people are asking us to do at the moment,</p>
<p>us collectively is, to fall for that thing,</p>
<p>I think it was Camille Foster who said it first,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve adopted in recent years,</p>
<p>is to say you must spend an inordinate amount of your life</p>
<p>trying to understand me personally,</p>
<p>my lived experience, everything about me.</p>
<p>You should dedicate your life to trying to do that.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, you&rsquo;ll never understand me.</p>
<p>This is not an attractive invitation.</p>
<p>This is an unwinnable game.</p>
<p>So if somebody has a legitimate</p>
<p>and important point to make, they should make it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll win through whatever their character is</p>
<p>or whatever their race.</p>
<p>And by the way, there are plenty of white people</p>
<p>who experience racism as well.</p>
<p>There are plenty of white people who do and have done,</p>
<p>and increasingly so, which is one of the things</p>
<p>I write about in the War on the West.</p>
<p>I mean, I would argue that today in America,</p>
<p>the only group who are actually allowed</p>
<p>to be consistently, vilely racist against the white people.</p>
<p>If you say disgusting things about black people</p>
<p>in America in 2022, you will be over.</p>
<p>You will be over.</p>
<p>If you decide to talk about people&rsquo;s white tears,</p>
<p>their white female tears, their white guilt,</p>
<p>their white privilege, their white rage,</p>
<p>and all these other pseudo pathologizing terms,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be just fine.</p>
<p>You can be the chairman of the Joint Committee</p>
<p>of the Staff, you can lecture at Yale University,</p>
<p>absolutely fine, and the white people have to suck that up</p>
<p>as if that&rsquo;s fine because there was racism</p>
<p>in another direction in the past.</p>
<p>So white people can have racism as well.</p>
<p>Does that mean that I think that I have a right</p>
<p>or other white people have a right to dominate the discourse</p>
<p>by talking about their feelings of having been victims</p>
<p>of racism?</p>
<p>No, not particularly, because what does that get us?</p>
<p>It gets us into an endless cycle of competitive victimhood.</p>
<p>Am I saying that white people who&rsquo;ve experienced violence</p>
<p>have experienced historically anything like the violence</p>
<p>that was perpetrated against black people</p>
<p>in America historically?</p>
<p>Obviously not.</p>
<p>But what kind of competition do we want to enter here?</p>
<p>And this is very, very important terrain now in America,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s one other thing I have to throw in there,</p>
<p>which is how do you work out the sincerity of the claim?</p>
<p>How do you work out the sincerity of the claim being made?</p>
<p>At one point in this latest book,</p>
<p>I referred to a very useful bit in Nietzsche</p>
<p>on the genealogy of morals,</p>
<p>where, as you know, Nietzsche always has to be treated</p>
<p>carefully, you know, when people say,</p>
<p>I love Nietzsche, you have to say, which bits?</p>
<p>So what exactly do you love about him?</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>and a lot can be learned from the answer.</p>
<p>But there are moments in Genealogy of Morals</p>
<p>that were very useful for this book.</p>
<p>One of them was the moment when Nietzsche uses a phrase</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve now stolen from myself, appropriated,</p>
<p>you might say,</p>
<p>where he refers to people who tear at wounds</p>
<p>long since closed and then cry about the pain they feel.</p>
<p>And Nietzsche says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never felt so much pain in my life</p>
<p>as the pain they feel.</p>
<p>Now, how do you know,</p>
<p>how do you know whether the pain is real?</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you can never know, but it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>So when somebody says,</p>
<p>I feel that my life hasn&rsquo;t gone that well</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s because of something that was done</p>
<p>to my ancestors 200 years ago,</p>
<p>maybe they do feel that.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re right to feel that.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re using it up.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re using it as their reason for failure in life.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re using it as their reason to not even try.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re using it as their reason</p>
<p>to smoke weed all day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And who does know?</p>
<p>How can you work that out?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I come back to this thing of,</p>
<p>who are we to constantly judge in this society</p>
<p>other people who we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and attribute motives to them based on racial</p>
<p>characteristics?</p>
<p>And as you write in this part,</p>
<p>I like your cultural appropriation of Nietzsche</p>
<p>and at the same time, canceling Nietzsche</p>
<p>in the same set of sentences.</p>
<p>But you write in this part about evil.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t cancel Nietzsche.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t cancel Nietzsche, I was saying treat him carefully.</p>
<p>Treat him carefully, fair enough.</p>
<p>But you can judge a man&rsquo;s character</p>
<p>by which parts of Nietzsche he quotes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair enough, I think.</p>
<p>I think when you meet people who do man and Superman</p>
<p>a bit too much, you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re pulling in even deeper water</p>
<p>referencing Hitler here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you write in this part of the book about evil.</p>
<p>Quote, what is it that drives evil?</p>
<p>Many things without doubt,</p>
<p>but one of them is identified by several</p>
<p>of the great philosophers is resentment.</p>
<p>That sentiment is one of the greatest drivers</p>
<p>for people who want to destroy.</p>
<p>Colon, blaming someone else for having something</p>
<p>you believe you deserve more.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying this kind of resentment,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know as it surfaces whether it&rsquo;s genuine</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s used to sort of play games of power</p>
<p>to evil ends, can you speak to this?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s such a fascinating idea</p>
<p>that one of the biggest drivers of evil</p>
<p>in the world is resentment.</p>
<p>Because if you look at, boy,</p>
<p>if you look at human history, if you look at Hitler,</p>
<p>so much of the propaganda, so much of the narrative</p>
<p>was about resentment.</p>
<p>So is that surface or is it level</p>
<p>or is that deep, the resentment that drives evil?</p>
<p>It can be any of the above.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first of all preface it, everybody has resentment.</p>
<p>I use the term resentment which is sort of very similar</p>
<p>to resentment, let&rsquo;s stick with resentment.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t sound too pretentious.</p>
<p>Let me give you a quick example of somebody</p>
<p>in our own day who has a form of resentment,</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Did you see Navalny&rsquo;s documentary, Putin&rsquo;s Palace?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You remember the stuff about Putin</p>
<p>as a young KGB officer in Germany?</p>
<p>Remember the stuff about Putin and his first wife&rsquo;s</p>
<p>resentment of one of his KGB colleagues</p>
<p>who had an apartment that was a few meters bigger</p>
<p>than the Putin&rsquo;s apartment?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;m not saying that, you know,</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin became the man he has become</p>
<p>and invaded Ukraine because he didn&rsquo;t have an apartment</p>
<p>he liked in Berlin or Munich or wherever he was.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s distinct possibility.</p>
<p>My point is that resentment is a factor in all human lives</p>
<p>and we all feel it in our lives</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that has to be struggled against.</p>
<p>Resentment is, in political terms, can be a deadly,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an incredibly deep thing to draw upon.</p>
<p>I mean, you mentioned Hitler.</p>
<p>Obviously one of the things that Hitler</p>
<p>played on was resentment, obviously.</p>
<p>Almost every revolutionary does.</p>
<p>I mean, the French revolutionaries did as well.</p>
<p>And not without cause.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good reason to feel that Versailles</p>
<p>was not listening to Paris in the 1780s</p>
<p>and feel resentment for Marie Antoinette</p>
<p>in her palace within the palace,</p>
<p>ignoring the bread shortages in Paris.</p>
<p>So resentment is a very, it&rsquo;s a very understandable thing</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s justifiable</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also deadly to the person as it is to the society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredibly deep, deep sentiment.</p>
<p>Somebody else has got something that you should have.</p>
<p>And the problem about it is that it has the potential</p>
<p>to be endless.</p>
<p>You can do it your whole life.</p>
<p>And one of the ways I&rsquo;ve sort of found myself</p>
<p>explaining this to people is to say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also important to recognize that resentment</p>
<p>is something that can cross absolutely every boundary.</p>
<p>So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries, obviously,</p>
<p>and how it goes without saying.</p>
<p>More interesting is it crosses all class boundaries</p>
<p>and socioeconomic boundaries.</p>
<p>And if I was to sort of simplify this thought,</p>
<p>I would say, I guess that you and I</p>
<p>and everybody watching knows or has known something</p>
<p>or has known somebody in their lives</p>
<p>who has almost nothing in worldly terms</p>
<p>and is a generous person, a kindly person,</p>
<p>a giving person, a happy person even, a cheerful person.</p>
<p>And I think we probably have also,</p>
<p>or many of us will have met people</p>
<p>who seem to have everything</p>
<p>and who are filled with resentment, filled with resentment.</p>
<p>Somebody else has held them back from something.</p>
<p>Their sister once did something,</p>
<p>she got this and I should have got that.</p>
<p>And on and on and on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a human trait.</p>
<p>And one of the things that suggests to me</p>
<p>is that we therefore have a choice in our lives about this.</p>
<p>And this is something which we can do something about,</p>
<p>not limitlessly, but for instance,</p>
<p>I mean, there are very good reasons</p>
<p>that some people in their lives might feel resentment.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re involved in a car crash</p>
<p>and a friend fell asleep at the wheel</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you are spending the rest of your life</p>
<p>in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pertinent example of this</p>
<p>in American politics at the moment.</p>
<p>You would be justified in feeling resentment.</p>
<p>And at some point you have to make a decision,</p>
<p>which is, am I going to be that person or a different person?</p>
<p>But even in that case, you&rsquo;re saying at the individual level</p>
<p>and at the societal level is destructive to the mind,</p>
<p>even when you&rsquo;re, quote unquote, justified.</p>
<p>It rots you.</p>
<p>It rots you because the best you can do</p>
<p>is to eke out your days unfulfilled.</p>
<p>So the antidote, as you describe, is gratitude.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Gratitude is the antidote to evil in a sense.</p>
<p>Gratitude is the individual level and the societal level.</p>
<p>Gratitude is certainly the answer to resentment.</p>
<p>I quote in The War on the West,</p>
<p>when I read it the first time a few years ago,</p>
<p>I was absolutely floored by the brothers Karamazov.</p>
<p>Not everything in it, by the way,</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t get into it,</p>
<p>but I have some very big structural criticisms</p>
<p>of the novel.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re just sweet talking to me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a Dostoevsky fan, but I appreciate this.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Well, we could get into what I see</p>
<p>as being the structural flaws in the brothers Karamazov,</p>
<p>but anyway.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m offended and triggered.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I mean, this is something coming out of Macbeth</p>
<p>and saying, I didn&rsquo;t think it was much good.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s structural flaws.</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought the ending stank</p>
<p>and the middle wasn&rsquo;t very good.</p>
<p>No, when I read that novel,</p>
<p>I was floored by a couple of things.</p>
<p>One is, of course, at the moment</p>
<p>where we realize the devil appears.</p>
<p>The moment that Ivan says to his brother,</p>
<p>you know he visits me,</p>
<p>and you realize that he&rsquo;s talking about the devil,</p>
<p>the whole novel goes into this totally different space.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s even more</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;ve already realized the novel&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>And then when the conversation occurs between Ivan</p>
<p>and the devil, I think he describes him</p>
<p>as dressed in the French style</p>
<p>of the early part of the 90th century.</p>
<p>Very strange that the devil would be dressed like that,</p>
<p>but sort of.</p>
<p>And if you remember that he&rsquo;s sort of cross legged</p>
<p>and rather a vain figure,</p>
<p>but the devil mentions in passing to Ivan</p>
<p>that he says, I don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>gratitude is not an instinct that&rsquo;s been given to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re not allowed.</p>
<p>This is not, given the role of being the devil,</p>
<p>this is not one of the things.</p>
<p>Just not one of the things.</p>
<p>And you think, and of course,</p>
<p>only a genius of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s stature could,</p>
<p>I mean, a lesser genius would have made a whole novel</p>
<p>out of that insight.</p>
<p>Only Dostoevsky can just throw it away</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s such an abundance of riches</p>
<p>that he still has to get through,</p>
<p>the structural problems aside.</p>
<p>But the, but the, but the.</p>
<p>The passive aggressive, the microaggression</p>
<p>in this conversation is palpable.</p>
<p>A little knife fight.</p>
<p>No, but the reason I mention this is because of course,</p>
<p>when I saw this, this is such a brilliant insight</p>
<p>by Dostoevsky because why would gratitude</p>
<p>not be a sentiment that the devil was capable of?</p>
<p>The answer is of course that if the devil</p>
<p>was capable of gratitude, he wouldn&rsquo;t be the devil.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be somebody else.</p>
<p>He has to be incapable of gratitude.</p>
<p>Do you think for Dostoevsky that was as strong of an insight</p>
<p>as it is for you?</p>
<p>Because I think that&rsquo;s a really powerful idea</p>
<p>that with gratitude, you don&rsquo;t get the resentment</p>
<p>that rots you from the core.</p>
<p>Yes, I think it was one of the just endless things</p>
<p>that he saw in us.</p>
<p>And the way I put it is that, I mean,</p>
<p>I also think of it in terms of the era of deconstruction,</p>
<p>which is one of the things I&rsquo;d like us to call</p>
<p>the era that&rsquo;s now ending.</p>
<p>The era of deconstruction was the era that started,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say from the 60s onwards,</p>
<p>and was originally an academic game</p>
<p>that then spilled out into the wider culture,</p>
<p>which was let&rsquo;s take everything apart.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pull it all apart.</p>
<p>There are lots of problems with it.</p>
<p>One is it&rsquo;s quite boring.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get an awful lot from it.</p>
<p>You also have the problem of what children find</p>
<p>when they try to do this with bicycles,</p>
<p>which is they can take it apart quite easily,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t put it back together.</p>
<p>And the era of taking things apart as a game</p>
<p>is one we&rsquo;ve lived through,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been highly destructive,</p>
<p>but you can do it for quite a long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to look at this society,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to take it apart by showing systemic problems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to, at the end of that, what have you got?</p>
<p>What have you done?</p>
<p>What have you achieved?</p>
<p>We need to interrogate this.</p>
<p>Okay, interrogate.</p>
<p>By all means, ask questions,</p>
<p>but interrogate as a deliberate hostility to this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to interrogate this thing and take it apart.</p>
<p>And again, at the end of it, what have you got?</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re interrogating a text or a piece of music</p>
<p>or an idea or a society, fine.</p>
<p>Question, endlessly question.</p>
<p>Yes, interrogate assumes it&rsquo;s all a criminal in a cell</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s guilty, and therefore it must be taken apart.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been doing for decades in the West.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s resentment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one byproduct of resentment.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t build the thing, but you know how to take it apart.</p>
<p>Is a little bit of resentment good?</p>
<p>So you have that, I love Tom Waits,</p>
<p>and he has a song where a little drop of,</p>
<p>I like my Tom with a little drop of poison.</p>
<p>Is it good to do that?</p>
<p>Is it good to have a little bit of poison in your drink?</p>
<p>Depends what the poison is,</p>
<p>and it depends if you know not to have another drink.</p>
<p>It might be the case, you find out, as some alcoholics do,</p>
<p>that one was too many and 10 is not enough.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a natural, in this case,</p>
<p>this kind of deconstruction is a slippery slope.</p>
<p>It becomes an addiction, it becomes a drug,</p>
<p>and you just can&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;d have to wean yourself off it</p>
<p>and try to start creating again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to start trying to put things together again.</p>
<p>Something I think might be in the throes of starting</p>
<p>as it happens.</p>
<p>Well, speaking of taking things apart</p>
<p>and not putting them together again,</p>
<p>the idea of critical race theory.</p>
<p>Can you, to me, explain, so I&rsquo;m an engineer</p>
<p>and have not been actually paying attention much,</p>
<p>unfortunately, to these things.</p>
<p>None of the people in your field were</p>
<p>until it comes along and smacks you in the face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that line of thinking from MIT.</p>
<p>I said, well, surely whatever you folks are busy about</p>
<p>yelling at each other for is a thing at Harvard and Yale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>People in the STEM subjects thought it&rsquo;s not coming for us.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t come to us and bang.</p>
<p>Well, it hasn&rsquo;t quite been a bang.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Engineering is more safe than others.</p>
<p>Yeah, so let&rsquo;s draw a line now</p>
<p>between engineering and science.</p>
<p>So I think engineering is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting in a castle in the tallest tower</p>
<p>with my pinky out drinking my martini saying, surely.</p>
<p>The peasants below with their biology and their humanities</p>
<p>will figure it all out.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no pinky out.</p>
<p>I drink vodka and I hang with the peasants.</p>
<p>Okay, where is this?</p>
<p>This metaphor has gone too far.</p>
<p>Can you explain to this engineer</p>
<p>what critical race theory is?</p>
<p>Is it a term that&rsquo;s definable?</p>
<p>Is there a tradition?</p>
<p>Is there a history?</p>
<p>What is good about it, what is bad about it?</p>
<p>It is a tradition.</p>
<p>It is a history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a school of thought.</p>
<p>It started in the law roughly in the 1970s</p>
<p>in some of the American academy.</p>
<p>It spilled out.</p>
<p>It always aimed to be an activist philosophy.</p>
<p>People deny that now,</p>
<p>but as I cite in The War in the West,</p>
<p>the foundational texts say as much.</p>
<p>This is an activist academic study.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just looking at the law.</p>
<p>We seek to change the law.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s built out into all of the other disciplines.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a reason for that, by the way,</p>
<p>which is it happened at the time</p>
<p>that the humanities and others in America</p>
<p>were increasingly weak and didn&rsquo;t know what to do,</p>
<p>and they needed more games to play or new games to play.</p>
<p>The psychologists got bored.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, well, they needed tenure.</p>
<p>They needed something to do.</p>
<p>And I mean, it&rsquo;s not an original observation.</p>
<p>Plenty of people have made this,</p>
<p>but I mean, Neil Ferguson said it some time ago,</p>
<p>for instance, that in the last 50 years</p>
<p>in American academia, certainly in humanities departments,</p>
<p>when somebody dies out who&rsquo;s a great scholar in something,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just not replaced by somebody of equal stature.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re replaced by somebody who does theory</p>
<p>or critical race theory.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re replaced by somebody who does the modern games.</p>
<p>Somebody dies out who&rsquo;s a great historian of, say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s on my mind,</p>
<p>Russian history or Russian literature,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not replaced by a similar scholar.</p>
<p>In his observation and in yours, is this a recent development?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happened in the last few decades, for sure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sped up.</p>
<p>Is it because we&rsquo;ve gotten to the bottom</p>
<p>of some of the biggest questions of history?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re willing to forget the big questions.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s more fun to, big questions aren&rsquo;t as fun?</p>
<p>No, partly it&rsquo;s, no, I should stress that partly isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>this is in the weeds, but partly it&rsquo;s a result</p>
<p>of the hyper specialization in academia.</p>
<p>You know, if you said you&rsquo;d like to write</p>
<p>your dissertation on Hobbes,</p>
<p>if you wanted to say something central</p>
<p>to Kant&rsquo;s thought or Hegel&rsquo;s, I mean, that&rsquo;s not popular.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s popular is to take somebody way down the line</p>
<p>from that, because there&rsquo;s a feeling</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s all been done.</p>
<p>So you take something way, way, way down the line</p>
<p>from that that&rsquo;s much less important,</p>
<p>and then you sort of play with that.</p>
<p>And I think most people, anyone who&rsquo;s watching</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been in a philosophy department</p>
<p>or anything else in recent years will know that tendency.</p>
<p>By the way, there&rsquo;s a very practical consequence of this.</p>
<p>I saw this at the end of my friend Roger Scruton&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>when he would occasionally, he didn&rsquo;t get tenure</p>
<p>at universities, but he would occasionally be flown in</p>
<p>even by his enemies to teach courses</p>
<p>in various universities in basics of philosophy,</p>
<p>because there was no one in the department able to do it.</p>
<p>Like he would go in and teach for a semester,</p>
<p>you know, Hegel and Kant and Schopenhauer and others,</p>
<p>because there was no one to do it,</p>
<p>because they were all playing with the things</p>
<p>way, way, way down the road from this.</p>
<p>So that had already happened,</p>
<p>and people were searching for new games to play,</p>
<p>and the critical race theory stuff forced its way in,</p>
<p>partly in the way that all of this</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now known as anti racism does,</p>
<p>which is in a sort of bullying tone</p>
<p>of saying if you don&rsquo;t follow this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same way that all the things</p>
<p>that are called studies,</p>
<p>I think everything called studies in the humanities</p>
<p>should be shut down.</p>
<p>Because of the activist element.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all activists, gay studies and queer studies,</p>
<p>and nothing good has ever come from it.</p>
<p>Nothing good.</p>
<p>To push back, is it obvious that activism</p>
<p>is a sign of a flaw in a discipline?</p>
<p>So isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sign of the death of the discipline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sign the discipline&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it a good goal to have for discipline</p>
<p>to enact change, positive change in the world?</p>
<p>Or is that for politicians to do with the findings</p>
<p>of science, not the scientists themselves?</p>
<p>Why create an ideology and then set out</p>
<p>to find disciplines that are weakly put together</p>
<p>to try to back up your political ideology?</p>
<p>So ideology should not be part of science or of humanities.</p>
<p>Why would you, I mean, anyone could do it.</p>
<p>You could decide to go in and be wildly right wing</p>
<p>about something and only do things</p>
<p>that prove your right wing ideas.</p>
<p>Be fantastically antiacademic,</p>
<p>fantastically anti science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absurd way to mix up activism and academia.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s absolutely rife.</p>
<p>And Critical Race Theory is one of the ones</p>
<p>that completely polluted the academy.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s been dark moments throughout history,</p>
<p>both during World War II with both communism</p>
<p>and Nazism, fascism that infiltrated science</p>
<p>and then corrupted it.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, for instance, also,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s face it, in science, as in everything else,</p>
<p>there are dark, difficult things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much better we know about them, face up to them</p>
<p>and try to find a way socially to deal with them</p>
<p>than that you leave them in the hands of some activist</p>
<p>who wants to do stuff with them.</p>
<p>Some of my best friends are activists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding, okay.</p>
<p>None of my best friends are activists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it should be.</p>
<p>Well, I was kidding because I don&rsquo;t have any friends,</p>
<p>but okay.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m trying to gain some pity points.</p>
<p>Okay, so to return.</p>
<p>You have your clubhouse friends.</p>
<p>Screaming away like deranged maniacs.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m anti clubhouse, by the way,</p>
<p>because the only time I heard it was at Brett Weinstein one</p>
<p>when he did that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you heard that, early in clubhouse.</p>
<p>I was invited to clubhouse by various people.</p>
<p>He was like, oh, this is a really great civilized way</p>
<p>to hang out and talk with interesting people.</p>
<p>And I downloaded the app and I got on one,</p>
<p>because Brett Weinstein said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing this conversation and I listened</p>
<p>and it was the maddest damn discussion I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>Was it something about biology?</p>
<p>Something about, was it during COVID times?</p>
<p>At some point, Brett said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an evolutionary biologist.</p>
<p>And somebody else started saying, you&rsquo;re a eugenicist.</p>
<p>And he said, no, I&rsquo;m an evolutionary biologist.</p>
<p>And somebody said, that&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>And it just went on like that.</p>
<p>And Brett desperately tried to explain,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the same thing as being a eugenicist.</p>
<p>And he lost the clubhouse room.</p>
<p>They thought that was the same thing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d come, it horribly reminded me of a time some years ago</p>
<p>when a British newspaper ran a sort of realizing</p>
<p>that the only thing you can unite people on</p>
<p>in sexual ethics is revulsion against pedophilia,</p>
<p>ran an anti pedo campaign.</p>
<p>And shortly after pediatricians offices</p>
<p>were torched in North of England</p>
<p>by a mob who hadn&rsquo;t read the whole sign.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, to me, like I said,</p>
<p>a little bit of poison is good for the town, so.</p>
<p>Anyhow, sorry, I interrupted you</p>
<p>with flattering you with their people on clubhouse.</p>
<p>I have many, I have multiples of friends, yes.</p>
<p>Okay, we didn&rsquo;t get to some of the ideas</p>
<p>of critical race theory.</p>
<p>What exactly is it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually in part asking this question quite genuinely.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an attempt to look at everything</p>
<p>among other things through the lens of race</p>
<p>and to add race into things where it may not be</p>
<p>as a way of adding,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to give the most generous estimation,</p>
<p>to add race in as a conversation</p>
<p>in a place where it may not have been in the conversation.</p>
<p>And that means history too?</p>
<p>The history of racism.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, all history.</p>
<p>And to look at it through these particular lenses.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a certain, like all these things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain logic in it.</p>
<p>Like with feminist studies or something,</p>
<p>I mean, is there a utility in looking back</p>
<p>through undoubtedly male dominated histories</p>
<p>and asking where the more silent female voice was?</p>
<p>Yes, very interesting.</p>
<p>Not endlessly interesting.</p>
<p>And can&rsquo;t be put exactly on the same par as,</p>
<p>but it has a utility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that endlessly, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>that endlessly part that seems to get us</p>
<p>into trouble a lot here.</p>
<p>Well, because of this thing of where do you stop?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always, I talked about this in my last book</p>
<p>in the manners of crowds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the big conundrums in activist movements</p>
<p>and particularly in activist academia.</p>
<p>Where would you stop?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear because you&rsquo;ve got a job in it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a pension in it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got, your only esteem in society</p>
<p>is in keeping this gig going.</p>
<p>I mean, is there any likelihood?</p>
<p>Have you ever, there&rsquo;s the old academic joke, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>The end of every conference, the only thing everyone</p>
<p>agrees on is that we must have another conference</p>
<p>like this one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one thing they always agree on.</p>
<p>This conference is so great, we must have another one.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a criticism you could apply</p>
<p>to a lot of disciplines.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Civil engineering, bridge building.</p>
<p>At a certain point, do we need any more bridges?</p>
<p>Can we just fly everywhere?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>At the very least, you need to keep the bridges up.</p>
<p>Sure, and they would, critical race theory folks</p>
<p>would probably make the same argument.</p>
<p>At the very least, we need to keep the racism out.</p>
<p>We have to make sure we don&rsquo;t descend into the racism.</p>
<p>It assumes all the time that we are living</p>
<p>on the cusp of the return of the KKK.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which is totally wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a massive.</p>
<p>You say that now, until the KKK armies march in.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t always, we can&rsquo;t always predict the future.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t always predict the future,</p>
<p>and you can always say you should be careful,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve also gotta be careful of people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve got their timing like totally, totally wrong,</p>
<p>or their estimation of the society they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>You mean like most of society before in the 1930s,</p>
<p>when Hitler was, I mean, so many people got Hitler wrong.</p>
<p>Sure they did.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Most people.</p>
<p>So maybe it was nice to have the alarmist thinking there.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Beware of the man with the mustache.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If only it was that easy.</p>
<p>Not always a bob facial hair.</p>
<p>I always say that, I mean, what.</p>
<p>Very often is.</p>
<p>These two clean shaven chaps both say,</p>
<p>one of the problems of everybody</p>
<p>knowing a little bit about Nazism</p>
<p>is that they think that they know where evil comes from</p>
<p>and that it comes from like a German with a small mustache,</p>
<p>getting people to goose step, for instance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not correct.</p>
<p>A much better understanding of it is,</p>
<p>it can come from all number of directions</p>
<p>and keep your antennae as good as you can.</p>
<p>But once you end up in this society, which I would argue,</p>
<p>certainly parts of America, where you&rsquo;re always in 1938,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not healthy for a society either,</p>
<p>where people are so primed and think they&rsquo;re so well trained</p>
<p>because they spent a term in school</p>
<p>learning about the Second World War and the Holocaust,</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re so well trained in Hitler spotting</p>
<p>that they can do it all the time.</p>
<p>Look at all these phrases we now have in our societies,</p>
<p>like dog whistle.</p>
<p>You know, as I always say,</p>
<p>if you hear the whistle, you&rsquo;re the dog.</p>
<p>But people say, that&rsquo;s a dog whistle,</p>
<p>as if they&rsquo;re highly trained anti Nazis.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there should be some humility in it.</p>
<p>We should be careful, we should be wary for sure.</p>
<p>And we should also be slightly humble</p>
<p>in our inability to spot everything.</p>
<p>If not significantly humble, right, so if we can,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something funny, if not dark,</p>
<p>about the activity of Hitler spotting,</p>
<p>if I just may take an aside.</p>
<p>But so critical race theory, how much racism,</p>
<p>what is racism?</p>
<p>How much of it is in our world today?</p>
<p>If we were thinking about this activity of Hitler spotting,</p>
<p>and trying to steel man the case</p>
<p>of if not critical race theory,</p>
<p>but people who look for racism in our world,</p>
<p>how much would you say?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a good thing to try to define.</p>
<p>I would say that racism is the belief</p>
<p>that other people are inferior to you.</p>
<p>You could say, you could see a form of it</p>
<p>where you thought people were superior to you.</p>
<p>That could also happen, but more commonly,</p>
<p>you see a group of people as being inferior to you</p>
<p>simply by dint of the fact</p>
<p>that they have a different racial background.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of the easiest way to define racism.</p>
<p>As I say, I mean, there are types of racism,</p>
<p>mainly antisemitism actually, perhaps it&rsquo;s the only one,</p>
<p>which weirdly relies on a hatred of people</p>
<p>who a certain type of person thinks are better than them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a particular peculiarity,</p>
<p>one of the peculiarities of antisemitism.</p>
<p>Well, antisemitism somehow does both, right?</p>
<p>Yes, one of the eternal fascinating things</p>
<p>about antisemitism is it can do,</p>
<p>it does everything at the same time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a quantum racism.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both superior and inferior.</p>
<p>You know Vasily Grosman&rsquo;s Life and Fate?</p>
<p>So in the middle of Life and Fate,</p>
<p>which a Persian friend of mine always said</p>
<p>was one of only two great novels of the 20th century,</p>
<p>she was a very harsh literary critic.</p>
<p>What was the other one?</p>
<p>Oh, The Leopard, obviously.</p>
<p>The Leopard?</p>
<p>The Leopard by Giuseppe Dallan Pedusa, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s definitely right on that one.</p>
<p>Life and Fate is a&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning so much today, yes.</p>
<p>Life and Fate is an extraordinary book,</p>
<p>mainly about, well, you know, Grosman was obviously</p>
<p>Jewish himself, but he saw almost everything</p>
<p>that he could have done in the Second World War.</p>
<p>He saw Stalingrad, he was a journalist,</p>
<p>and he wrote firsthand accounts of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>He was also the first journalist into Treblinka,</p>
<p>and his account, which you can read in one</p>
<p>of the collections of his journalism,</p>
<p>his account of walking into Treblinka</p>
<p>is just one of the most devastating, haunting pieces</p>
<p>of journalism or prose you can read.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I mention him because Grosman,</p>
<p>in the middle of Life and Fate,</p>
<p>which is about a 900 page novel,</p>
<p>in the middle of it, which is about the dark axis</p>
<p>around Stalingrad, he, well, at one point,</p>
<p>he amazingly sort of goes into the minds</p>
<p>of Earth Hitler and Stalin, and he says,</p>
<p>Stalin, in his study, feels his counterpart</p>
<p>in Berlin, and he says he feels very close</p>
<p>to him at this moment.</p>
<p>Wow, around Stalingrad, like leading up to the back.</p>
<p>After Stalingrad, when the Germans are lost,</p>
<p>he says he feels the closeness of Hitler.</p>
<p>But Grosman, in the middle of Life and Fate,</p>
<p>slap bang at the worst hours of the 20th century,</p>
<p>suddenly dedicates a chapter to anti semitism,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen anti semitism as something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been very interested in,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve always had an instinctive utter revulsion</p>
<p>of it, and also partly because of having seen bits of it</p>
<p>in the Middle East and elsewhere,</p>
<p>but I mention this because Grosman,</p>
<p>in the middle of Life and Fate, takes time out</p>
<p>and does this like three page explanation,</p>
<p>three page description of anti semitism,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s extraordinary.</p>
<p>I mean, the only thing I can think of</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s equally good is Gregor von Retzori,</p>
<p>who wrote a luridly titled, but brilliant set of novellas</p>
<p>called The Confessions of an Anti Semite,</p>
<p>and about pre First World War anti semitism</p>
<p>in Eastern and Central Europe.</p>
<p>Anyway, Grosman says, in the middle of Life and Fate,</p>
<p>that one of the extraordinary things about anti semitism</p>
<p>is that it does everything at the same time,</p>
<p>that the Jews get condemned in one place for being rich</p>
<p>and in another for being poor,</p>
<p>condemned in one place for assimilating</p>
<p>and another for not assimilating,</p>
<p>for assimilating too much and assimilating too little,</p>
<p>for being too successful for not being successful enough.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s the only racism that includes within it,</p>
<p>a detestation, for the real anti semit,</p>
<p>a detestation of people that the person may perceive</p>
<p>to be better than them, correctly or otherwise.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m embarrassed to say I have not read</p>
<p>this one of two greatest novels</p>
<p>of the 20th century, Life and Fate, Zhizny Sidba.</p>
<p>And just to read off of Wikipedia,</p>
<p>we see that Grosman, a Ukrainian Jew,</p>
<p>became a correspondent for the Soviet military paper,</p>
<p>Krasnaya Zvezda, having volunteered</p>
<p>and been rejected from military service,</p>
<p>he spent a thousand days in the front lines,</p>
<p>roughly three of the four years of the conflict</p>
<p>between the Germans and the Soviets,</p>
<p>and the main themes covered in,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s it go, Life and Fate, I keep thinking Zhizny Sidba,</p>
<p>is a theme on Jewish identity and the Holocaust,</p>
<p>Grosman&rsquo;s idea of humanity and the human goodness,</p>
<p>Stalin&rsquo;s distortion of reality and values,</p>
<p>and science, life goes on, and reality of war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, I need to definitely, definitely read it.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll really get a lot from it.</p>
<p>One of the other things, sorry, I&rsquo;m raffling it,</p>
<p>but one of the other things he does</p>
<p>is that he has this extraordinary ability</p>
<p>to talk about the absolute highest levels of the conflict</p>
<p>and then zoom in, it&rsquo;s rather like the camera work</p>
<p>they use in things like Lord of the Rings,</p>
<p>where he zooms down and gets one person</p>
<p>in the midst of all this, and you get on that.</p>
<p>Or puts you in the study, too.</p>
<p>So I personally have read and reread</p>
<p>the William Shires, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s another journalist who was there,</p>
<p>but he does not do, interestingly enough,</p>
<p>given such a large novel, kind of the definitive work,</p>
<p>the definitive original work that goes</p>
<p>to source materials on Hitler,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t touch anti semitism really.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Big thing to miss out.</p>
<p>Well, he just says it very calmly and objectively</p>
<p>as he does for most of the work,</p>
<p>that this was the fact of life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of cruelty throughout,</p>
<p>but he doesn&rsquo;t get to.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things is, of course,</p>
<p>they lost the war because of anti semitism.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one kind of important way to view it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how Andrew Roberts, another historian, said it,</p>
<p>is that in the end, the Nazis lost the war</p>
<p>because they were Nazis.</p>
<p>It sounds almost too neat, but it&rsquo;s worth remembering</p>
<p>that at the end of the war,</p>
<p>when the Germans need to be transporting troops</p>
<p>and they need to be transporting very basic supplies,</p>
<p>Eichmann makes sure he gets the trains</p>
<p>to transport the Jews right up to the end.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s certainly a dark possibility.</p>
<p>Anyhow, but to go back to racism in general.</p>
<p>Racism in general, apart from anti semitism,</p>
<p>relies on the perception that another group of people,</p>
<p>a racial group, other than your own, are inferior to you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d say is the easiest shorthand of racism.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s one of the stupidest things</p>
<p>that our species is capable of.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the stupidest,</p>
<p>that you can look at a person and guess them</p>
<p>in their entirety, in fact, because of their skin color.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, what a stupid idea that is,</p>
<p>as well as being an evil one.</p>
<p>But I would say that one of the,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a dangerous thing in our era</p>
<p>that there are bits of it coming back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I say we do need sort of,</p>
<p>we need our antennae working.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t need them to be overactive</p>
<p>or underactive, you know.</p>
<p>Now, the book is War in the West,</p>
<p>but speaking of racism, racism towards different groups</p>
<p>based on their skin color,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve said that there&rsquo;s a war on white people in the US.</p>
<p>Would you say that&rsquo;s the case?</p>
<p>Would you say that there is significant</p>
<p>racism towards white people in the United States?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that white people in the United States</p>
<p>are the only people who are told</p>
<p>that they have hereditary sin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big one, just to start with.</p>
<p>Based strictly on the color of their skin.</p>
<p>Based on their skin color.</p>
<p>I mean, I would find it so repugnant if,</p>
<p>and I hope everybody would join me in feeling this,</p>
<p>I would feel it so repugnant</p>
<p>if there were any school of thought in America today</p>
<p>that had any grasp on the public attention</p>
<p>that said that black people were born into evil</p>
<p>because of something their ancestors had done.</p>
<p>Like they had the mark of Cain upon them.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it would be such a vicious way</p>
<p>to try to demoralize a group of people</p>
<p>and to tell them that the things they would be able</p>
<p>to achieve in their lives are much lessened</p>
<p>because they should spend significant portions</p>
<p>of their lives trying to do something</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Is there a difference?</p>
<p>And the obvious point left unsaid,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say it, nobody in the public square says that.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re the maniacs at the far fringes,</p>
<p>but nobody in the mainstream would dare to say that,</p>
<p>or I think even think that about any group of people</p>
<p>other than white people.</p>
<p>And does this mean that white people are more likely</p>
<p>or does this mean that white people are more disadvantaged</p>
<p>than black people?</p>
<p>No, and again, let&rsquo;s not make this a competition,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s not get into, I just desperately urge people</p>
<p>not to get into the idea of hereditary sin</p>
<p>according to racial background.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about the feature aspect,</p>
<p>sort of play devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>about the asymmetry of sort of accusations</p>
<p>towards the majority?</p>
<p>So because white, so it&rsquo;s easier to attack a majority.</p>
<p>It is much easier, but is there something to be said</p>
<p>about that being a useful function of society</p>
<p>that you always attack, that the minority has</p>
<p>disproportionate power to attack the majority</p>
<p>so that you can always keep the majority in check?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a dangerous game to play, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very dangerous game to play.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good summary of entirety of human civilization.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, everything is dangerous.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very dangerous game to play that.</p>
<p>I wrote about this a bit in the Madness of Crowds</p>
<p>when I was saying like gay rights people,</p>
<p>the ones that still exist,</p>
<p>the ones who don&rsquo;t have homes to go to,</p>
<p>who want to beat up on straight people in a way,</p>
<p>or want to make straight people feel like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of unremarkable, uncool, you know, boring straights.</p>
<p>So boring.</p>
<p>So not like the magical pixie fairy dust gays.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bad idea to push that one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bad idea.</p>
<p>And some gays push that.</p>
<p>Highly unwise, given the fact that about</p>
<p>two to 3% of the population are actually gay,</p>
<p>although now there&rsquo;s like an additional 20%</p>
<p>who think they&rsquo;re like two spirit or something</p>
<p>and all that bullshit, but they&rsquo;re just attention seekers.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s not spend too much time on that.</p>
<p>But equally, as I said in the Madness of Crowds,</p>
<p>with the feminist movement,</p>
<p>very unwise for half of the species</p>
<p>to say that the other half of the species isn&rsquo;t needed.</p>
<p>And there were always third and fourth wave feminists</p>
<p>willing to make that nuts argument.</p>
<p>Not first wave feminists.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t hear it in first wave feminists.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t hear it.</p>
<p>Suffragette tended not to say we like the vote</p>
<p>and men are scum.</p>
<p>It would have been hard to have won everyone</p>
<p>over to their side.</p>
<p>Not least the men they needed to win over to their side.</p>
<p>But you do get third and fourth wave feminists</p>
<p>who say like, do we need men?</p>
<p>Or men are all X.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s a bad idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bad idea tactically.</p>
<p>What if men, Richard Wrangham, somebody from Harvard,</p>
<p>describes that men are the originators of violence,</p>
<p>physical violence in society.</p>
<p>And he argues that actually the world would be better off.</p>
<p>No, just a very cold calculus.</p>
<p>If you get rid of men,</p>
<p>there will be a lot less violence in society is his claim.</p>
<p>But who says you need to get rid of violence in society?</p>
<p>But shouldn&rsquo;t that at least be a discussion?</p>
<p>The pros and cons.</p>
<p>Have a debate, a panel discussion,</p>
<p>violence, pros and cons.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the sort of thing, if I can say so,</p>
<p>that some weak ass academic decides to do</p>
<p>because he thinks that his area of Boston</p>
<p>would be nicer or whatever.</p>
<p>He might decide it&rsquo;s useful</p>
<p>if he was living in Kiev today to have violent men.</p>
<p>I mean, it might, if New York was invaded right now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d need some violent men around here.</p>
<p>But it wouldn&rsquo;t be invaded if there&rsquo;s no violent men.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also, at least there&rsquo;s some level of threat</p>
<p>that you ought to exude that puts people off.</p>
<p>If I was in, you know, I&rsquo;m very glad</p>
<p>that the men and women of Ukraine are capable of</p>
<p>and more than capable of fighting for their country</p>
<p>and for their neighbors and their families and much more.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s better that there was violence ready to unleash</p>
<p>when violence was unleashed upon them</p>
<p>than that the whole society had been told</p>
<p>that they should identify as non binary.</p>
<p>But at least it&rsquo;s a conversation to have.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there aspect to the sort of the feminist movement</p>
<p>that is correct in challenging the&hellip;</p>
<p>Some forms of violence, domestic violence, for instance.</p>
<p>Although women are capable of that as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning about this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all learning about this at the moment.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but watch the entirety of it go down</p>
<p>in this beautiful mess that is human relations.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But just to finish up that thought,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very unwise for women to war against men</p>
<p>as it would be for men to war against women.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly, highly unwise to war on a majority population.</p>
<p>And in America, Britain and other Western countries,</p>
<p>white people are still a majority.</p>
<p>And so why would you tell the majority of their evil</p>
<p>by dint of their skin color?</p>
<p>And think that that would be a good way</p>
<p>to keep them in check.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not guilty of anything because of my skin color.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not guilty of anything.</p>
<p>My ancestors didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.</p>
<p>And even if they had,</p>
<p>why would I be held responsible for it?</p>
<p>So to go back to Nietzsche,</p>
<p>is there some aspect to where,</p>
<p>if we try to explain the forces at play here,</p>
<p>is it the will to power playing itself out</p>
<p>from individual human nature</p>
<p>and from group behavior nature?</p>
<p>Is there some elements to this</p>
<p>which is the game we play as human beings</p>
<p>is always when we have less power,</p>
<p>we try to find ways to gain more power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly one.</p>
<p>The desire to grab is,</p>
<p>let me see if I can find a quote for you on that.</p>
<p>The desire to grab that which we think we&rsquo;re owed</p>
<p>and to do it often in the guise of justice.</p>
<p>I mean, justice is one of the great terms of our age</p>
<p>and one of the great bogus terms of our age.</p>
<p>People forever talk about their search for justice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how violent they can often be</p>
<p>in their search for justice</p>
<p>and how many rules they&rsquo;re willing to break</p>
<p>so long as they can say they&rsquo;re after justice</p>
<p>and how many norms they can trample</p>
<p>so long as they can say it&rsquo;s in the name of justice.</p>
<p>You can burn down buildings in the name of justice.</p>
<p>Well, the majority groups throughout history,</p>
<p>including those with white skin color</p>
<p>have done the same in the name of justice.</p>
<p>We come up with all kinds of sexy terms</p>
<p>in our propaganda machines</p>
<p>to sell whatever atrocities we&rsquo;d like to commit.</p>
<p>One of the quotes from Nietzsche that I liked</p>
<p>and I quoted in this book.</p>
<p>Careful, I&rsquo;m judging you harshly.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Nietzsche says that one of the dangers of men of resentment</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ll achieve their ultimate form of revenge,</p>
<p>which is to turn happy people</p>
<p>into unhappy people like themselves,</p>
<p>to shove their misery in the faces of the happy</p>
<p>so that in due course the happy,</p>
<p>and this is quoting Nietzsche,</p>
<p>start to be ashamed of their happiness</p>
<p>and perhaps say to one another,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a disgrace to be happy.</p>
<p>There is too much misery.</p>
<p>This is something to be averted.</p>
<p>The sick, says Nietzsche, must not make the healthy sick too</p>
<p>or make the healthy confuse themselves with the sick.</p>
<p>Well, I think that again, there&rsquo;s a lot of that going on.</p>
<p>How could I be happy when there is unhappiness in the world?</p>
<p>Why should I not join the ranks of the unhappy?</p>
<p>I think Dostoevsky has a book about that as well.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Knows From Underground.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This has been very Russian, Russian focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very pleased with another times,</p>
<p>but Dostoevsky and Grossman and others have come in.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t doing this as a sort of.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s always good to plug the greats</p>
<p>and get to know they&rsquo;re still relevant.</p>
<p>Do you speak Russian by the way at all?</p>
<p>Which I did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s a 10 year language basically</p>
<p>to learn from scratch as my friends who have done it.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s the language and then there&rsquo;s the personality</p>
<p>behind the language and the personality.</p>
<p>I feel like you already have.</p>
<p>So you just need to know the surface details.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>In fact, the silence to be silent in the Russian language</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s already important.</p>
<p>Oh, I should, if we had a moment,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d tell you my story about Stalin&rsquo;s birthplace.</p>
<p>Should I tell you that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I once went to Gori where Stalin was born.</p>
<p>Have you been?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I was there just after the Georgia war.</p>
<p>And I went to the nomads land in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p>
<p>And I said, I really got to go to Gori also here</p>
<p>because the shell had landed in Gori rather weirdly</p>
<p>from the Russian side and Gori is where Stalin was born.</p>
<p>And of course, Gori is in Georgia.</p>
<p>And when we had the museum of Stalin&rsquo;s birthplace,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d been trying to change for some years</p>
<p>because it had been unadulteratedly pro Stalin for years.</p>
<p>And the Georgian authorities,</p>
<p>this is in Saakashvili&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>were trying to make it into a museum of Stalinism.</p>
<p>And it was really tough.</p>
<p>The only place I&rsquo;ve seen which is similar</p>
<p>is the house in Mexico City where Trotsky was killed.</p>
<p>That also is that they&rsquo;re not quite sure to do.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to say he&rsquo;s a bad guy</p>
<p>because they think that people won&rsquo;t come anyhow.</p>
<p>Stalin&rsquo;s house in Gori had changed</p>
<p>from the museum of Stalin to the museum of Stalinism.</p>
<p>There was this large Georgian woman with a pink pencil</p>
<p>who just had clearly been doing the tour for 50 years</p>
<p>and just pointed all the facts.</p>
<p>She did that classic thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also saw it once in North Korea</p>
<p>where they sort of that sort of communist thing</p>
<p>where they say, here is, this is 147 feet high</p>
<p>by 13 feet deep.</p>
<p>They give you lots of facts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>What does it matter?</p>
<p>They always give you facts.</p>
<p>This is Stalin&rsquo;s suitcase.</p>
<p>It is 13 inches wide by, you know, this isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Anyhow, and this woman did all of this</p>
<p>and it was all just wildly pro, not pro Stalin,</p>
<p>just explaining Stalin&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>It was just a great local boy done good.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t mention the fact he killed</p>
<p>more Georgians per capita than anyone else.</p>
<p>Local boy done good.</p>
<p>And we get to the end and before being taken to the gift shop</p>
<p>where they sell red wine with Stalin&rsquo;s face on it</p>
<p>and among other things, and a lighter with Stalin on it,</p>
<p>they took you to a little room under the stairs</p>
<p>and they said, this is a replica of interrogation cell</p>
<p>to show, represent horror of what happened in Stalin time.</p>
<p>Now, gift shop.</p>
<p>As I said, there&rsquo;s no, no kind of thing.</p>
<p>And I took the woman aside at the end.</p>
<p>I discovered she&rsquo;d said this to other journalists</p>
<p>and visited before.</p>
<p>I took her aside and said,</p>
<p>what do you think about communist Stalin?</p>
<p>And she said, let&rsquo;s say she&rsquo;d obviously done this</p>
<p>during communist times.</p>
<p>She said, it&rsquo;s not my place to judge, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Which is an interesting comment in itself.</p>
<p>I said, yeah, but he killed more Georgians than anyone</p>
<p>and all that sort of thing.</p>
<p>And she said, it&rsquo;s not my place to judge</p>
<p>or to give my views and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>And eventually I said, well, what do you feel about it?</p>
<p>And she said, it was like a hurricane, it happened.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting because if I may mention Clubhouse</p>
<p>once again, I got a chance to talk to a few people</p>
<p>from Mongolia, there&rsquo;s a woman from Mongolia</p>
<p>and they talked about the fact</p>
<p>that they deeply admire Stalin, love.</p>
<p>She sounded, if I may, hopefully that&rsquo;s not crossing line.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m representing her correctly in saying</p>
<p>she admired him almost like, loved him.</p>
<p>Like the way people love like Jesus, like a holy figure.</p>
<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t that still the case in large parts of Russia?</p>
<p>I mean, Stalin keeps on winning</p>
<p>greatest Russian of all time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s perhaps, maybe there&rsquo;s a dip,</p>
<p>but if we were to think about the long arc of history,</p>
<p>perhaps that&rsquo;s going to go up and up and up and up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about human memory</p>
<p>that it just, you forget the details</p>
<p>of the atrocities of the past and remember that.</p>
<p>I mean, think of the number of people we talk about</p>
<p>as historical heroes, Napoleon.</p>
<p>I mean, British people don&rsquo;t talk about Napoleon as a hero,</p>
<p>but the French, now you&rsquo;re, now you&rsquo;re on tricky ground.</p>
<p>But no, but like the French, normally my Napoleon</p>
<p>and there had many Admiral Aswit who was also</p>
<p>an unbelievable brute and killed many people unnecessarily.</p>
<p>And there are lots of figures from history</p>
<p>that we sort of cover that over with.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Can we mention Churchill briefly?</p>
<p>Because he is one of the, you can make a case for him</p>
<p>being one of the great representers</p>
<p>or great figures historically of Western civilization.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a lot of people from, not a lot.</p>
<p>I know, I have like three friends</p>
<p>and one of them happens to be from London.</p>
<p>And they say that he&rsquo;s not a good person.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>So listen, this friend, we did not discuss.</p>
<p>I just, this is an opinion poll of the three friends,</p>
<p>but I do know that there&rsquo;s quite a bit, you know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a backlash going on at the moment.</p>
<p>At the moment and in general, there&rsquo;s a spirit</p>
<p>like reflecting on the darker sides</p>
<p>of some of these historical figures,</p>
<p>like challenging history through,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just critical race theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s challenging history through,</p>
<p>well, are the people we think of as heroes,</p>
<p>what are their flaws?</p>
<p>And are they in fact villains that are convenient,</p>
<p>sort of, we&rsquo;re there at the right time</p>
<p>to accidentally do the right thing.</p>
<p>Accidentally?</p>
<p>I hope this isn&rsquo;t the representative fair summation</p>
<p>of your friend in London&rsquo;s views.</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s going to be quite mad at this,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t say the name, so it could be any friend.</p>
<p>It could be, it&rsquo;s like a girlfriend in Canada.</p>
<p>Well, see, I.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given that away.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, of course I would not.</p>
<p>I made that up completely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, just like my girlfriend in Canada,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s completely a figment of my imagination.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Winston Churchill is somebody,</p>
<p>I mean, just looking at reading</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</p>
<p>is an incredible figure that to me,</p>
<p>so much of World War II is marked,</p>
<p>leading up to the war is marked</p>
<p>by stunning amounts of cowardice by political leaders,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fascinating to watch here</p>
<p>this person clearly with a drinking and a smoking problem.</p>
<p>Was he?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand why that&rsquo;s a negative.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t say, you see.</p>
<p>Yeah, you throw it in as if it is.</p>
<p>No, well, it&rsquo;s called humor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain it to you one day what that means,</p>
<p>but he stood.</p>
<p>Explain dry humor.</p>
<p>He stood up, he stood up to what we now see as evil</p>
<p>when at the time it was not so obvious to see.</p>
<p>You know, so that&rsquo;s just a fascinating figure</p>
<p>of Western civilization.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get your comments.</p>
<p>The real criticisms, I mean, smoking and drinking.</p>
<p>The real criticisms of Churchill are quite easy to sum up,</p>
<p>and I do so in the War on the West, actually.</p>
<p>I say these are the things that they now use against him.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t do enough to avert the Bengal famine in 1943,</p>
<p>for instance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been shot down by numerous historians,</p>
<p>including Indian historians.</p>
<p>In the middle of the war, in the middle of a world war,</p>
<p>Churchill did what he could</p>
<p>to get grain supplies diverted from Australia to Bengal.</p>
<p>The famine was appalling.</p>
<p>It was caused by a typhoon.</p>
<p>It was not caused by Winston Churchill,</p>
<p>and the idea that some, basically,</p>
<p>Indian nationalist historians have pumped out</p>
<p>in recent years, and just anti Churchill figures,</p>
<p>that he actually wanted Indians to die</p>
<p>is just total calumny.</p>
<p>And when people claim, some people claim that,</p>
<p>I mean, there was a few very ignorant scholars,</p>
<p>nevertheless with some credentials,</p>
<p>who claim that Churchill wanted the Indian population</p>
<p>to basically be genocided.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s complete nonsense,</p>
<p>not least by the fact that during the period</p>
<p>which in question Indian population boomed.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the main ones.</p>
<p>Another one is that he had some views</p>
<p>that we now had regarded as racist.</p>
<p>He definitely regarded races</p>
<p>as being of different characters,</p>
<p>and that there were superior races,</p>
<p>and the, as it were, the white European</p>
<p>was a superior culture.</p>
<p>He was born in Victorian England,</p>
<p>so he had some Victorian attitudes.</p>
<p>These are things in the negative side of the ledger,</p>
<p>and as with all history,</p>
<p>you should have a negative</p>
<p>and a positive side of the ledger.</p>
<p>Positive side of the ledger includes</p>
<p>he almost certainly did more than any one human being</p>
<p>to save the world from Nazism.</p>
<p>So that should count as something.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons I talk about Churchill</p>
<p>in this regard is to stress that if you get,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to stop anyone doing history at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the revisionism of recent years</p>
<p>about Churchill or the founding fathers of America</p>
<p>or anyone else is anything I want to stop.</p>
<p>I find it interesting,</p>
<p>find it interesting not least</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so sloppy on occasions,</p>
<p>but I find it interesting and it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And we should be able to see people in the round.</p>
<p>But that includes recognizing</p>
<p>the positive side of the ledger.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t recognize that side,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some form of politicking of a very particular kind.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s the same thing with the founding fathers.</p>
<p>There are some people, for instance,</p>
<p>certainly since the 90s who have pushed</p>
<p>the Sally Hemings, Thomas Jefferson story</p>
<p>to show that Thomas Jefferson was some kind of brute.</p>
<p>As a result, we see Jefferson&rsquo;s statue</p>
<p>being removed from the council chamber</p>
<p>of the city we&rsquo;re sitting in last November</p>
<p>by council members who said that Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>no longer represents our values.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t recognize greatness of Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>and that he had flaws,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not a grownup debate.</p>
<p>And weigh them and weigh them in the context of the time.</p>
<p>But let me sort of throw a curveball at you then.</p>
<p>What about recognizing the positive</p>
<p>and the negative of a fellow with nice facial hair</p>
<p>called Karl Marx?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I have a section in The War in the West,</p>
<p>as you know, where I go for Karl Marx with some glee.</p>
<p>So he seems to have gotten some popularity</p>
<p>in the West recently.</p>
<p>Not just recently, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s had a resurgence recently.</p>
<p>Yes, resurgence.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because whenever things are seen to go wrong,</p>
<p>people reach for other options.</p>
<p>And when, for instance, it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>for people to accumulate capital,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not obvious that they&rsquo;re gonna become capitalists.</p>
<p>And so one thing that happens is people say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s look at the Marxism thing again,</p>
<p>see if that&rsquo;s a viable goer.</p>
<p>And my argument would simply be,</p>
<p>point me to one place that&rsquo;s worked.</p>
<p>Well, the argument from the Marxists</p>
<p>or the Marxian economists is that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve only really tried it once, the Soviets tried it,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a few people</p>
<p>that kind of tried the Soviet thing.</p>
<p>Huber tried it?</p>
<p>Well, they basically, it&rsquo;s an offshoot of the Soviet, yes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve tried it.</p>
<p>They tried it in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just quickly say,</p>
<p>how did all these experiments go?</p>
<p>Well, they failed in fascinating ways.</p>
<p>They did, but they failed.</p>
<p>Yes, they failed.</p>
<p>We should stress, so grossly failed.</p>
<p>So grossly failed that they threw millions</p>
<p>and millions of people into completely thwarted lives</p>
<p>that were much shorter than they should have been.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the lesson to learn there,</p>
<p>that you can learn several lessons.</p>
<p>One is that anything that smells like Marxism</p>
<p>is going to lead to a lot of problems.</p>
<p>Now, another lesson could be,</p>
<p>well, what is the fundamental idea that Marx had?</p>
<p>He was criticizing capitalism and the flaws of capitalism.</p>
<p>So is it possible to do better than capitalism?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, if you take that spirit, you start to wonder.</p>
<p>That might actually become relevant in, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>20, 30, 50 years when the machines start doing</p>
<p>more and more of the labor, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>You start to ask questions.</p>
<p>You finally might get to Marx&rsquo;s dream</p>
<p>of what the average day would look like.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s gonna be an awful lot</p>
<p>of literary criticism then.</p>
<p>If you remember, that&rsquo;s what Marx said</p>
<p>that we would be doing in the evenings,</p>
<p>the laborer in the evening.</p>
<p>Well, he didn&rsquo;t know Twitter was a thing, or Netflix.</p>
<p>So he would change.</p>
<p>Are there things we could learn from Marx plausibly, possibly?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of anything myself offhand.</p>
<p>But to have a critique of capitalism</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t by any means a bad thing in this society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather that it was a critique of capitalism</p>
<p>that showed how you improve capitalism,</p>
<p>a critique of the free market that showed</p>
<p>how people could get better access to the free market,</p>
<p>how you could ensure, for instance,</p>
<p>that young people get onto the property ladder,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>Those are constructive things.</p>
<p>The people who say we must have Marxism,</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t know what the hell they&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>because that never leads to any of those things.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t led in the past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never led in the past.</p>
<p>And at some point, you&rsquo;ve got to try to work out</p>
<p>how many attempts you make at this damn philosophy</p>
<p>before you realize that every attempt always</p>
<p>leads to the same thing.</p>
<p>I would say we could pretend that fascism has never</p>
<p>been properly tried and that it was unfortunate what happened</p>
<p>in Nazi Germany, but that wasn&rsquo;t real fascism.</p>
<p>And Mussolini&rsquo;s fascism didn&rsquo;t go all that well,</p>
<p>but it was a bit better.</p>
<p>And maybe we could try a bit more Franco fascism.</p>
<p>Nobody would have any time for this crap, nor should they.</p>
<p>The people who try that are reviled, and quite rightly.</p>
<p>So why do we tolerate it with the Marxism thing?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a great mystery to me,</p>
<p>the way that people do tolerate it.</p>
<p>Always, always in this stupid way of saying,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t done it yet.</p>
<p>And if you keep trying the same recipe,</p>
<p>and every time it comes out as shit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that the recipe is shit.</p>
<p>Well, sort of, I&rsquo;m trying to practice here</p>
<p>by playing devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>practice the same idea that you mentioned,</p>
<p>which is, when you say the word Marxism,</p>
<p>should you throw out everything,</p>
<p>or should you ask a question, is there good ideas here?</p>
<p>And the same, it&rsquo;s the good,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weighing the good and the bad,</p>
<p>and being able to do so calmly and thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You know the famous George Orwell comment</p>
<p>on the style, in an argument with a Stalinist?</p>
<p>Do you know this?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of my favorite quotes.</p>
<p>George Orwell, in the early 40s,</p>
<p>gets into an argument with a Stalinist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a Marxist.</p>
<p>And this is after the show trials, 37.</p>
<p>This is when it&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>what Marxism in the Russian form is.</p>
<p>And this, Orwell is in the discussion with this Marxist,</p>
<p>and it goes on and on,</p>
<p>and eventually Orwell says,</p>
<p>well, you know, what about the show trials,</p>
<p>and what about what&rsquo;s happened in the Ukraine,</p>
<p>and the famines, and much more,</p>
<p>and the purges, and the purges, and the purges,</p>
<p>and eventually the Stalinist says to Orwell</p>
<p>what Orwell knows he&rsquo;s going to say all along,</p>
<p>which is, he says,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t make an omelet without breaking eggs.</p>
<p>And Orwell says, where&rsquo;s the omelet?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s a good, that&rsquo;s a really good,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Look at this by this stage, okay?</p>
<p>How many&hellip;</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s my damn omelet?</p>
<p>How many just messy, big, bloody, eggy piles</p>
<p>have the Marxists created by now in country after country?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Always next time they&rsquo;re going to produce the great omelet,</p>
<p>but they never have, and they never will,</p>
<p>because the whole thing is rotten from the start.</p>
<p>But let me just also say one thing about,</p>
<p>because of course Marx isn&rsquo;t as nice as he sounds,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of the things that I try</p>
<p>to highlight in the book is,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to do this reductive thing</p>
<p>of people in history and saying,</p>
<p>well, they had views that were of their time,</p>
<p>and we must therefore condemn them for them,</p>
<p>say, fine, let&rsquo;s do the same thing with Marx.</p>
<p>And there were things I quote in this book</p>
<p>from Marx&rsquo;s letters, not least letters to Engels,</p>
<p>and indeed in his published writings,</p>
<p>in pieces he was writing for the American press</p>
<p>in the 1850s,</p>
<p>the way he has horrible views on slavery</p>
<p>and colonialism and much more.</p>
<p>But the main thing is, I mean,</p>
<p>the horrible things he says about black people</p>
<p>and the constant use of the N word.</p>
<p>In fact, when I was doing the audio book</p>
<p>for the war in the West, I had to decide,</p>
<p>will I read out the quotes from Marx or not?</p>
<p>If I had read them out, I&rsquo;d have been canceled</p>
<p>because people would have just said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been using the N word so much in this passage.</p>
<p>And I slightly thought of doing it</p>
<p>so that I could say I was only quoting Marx</p>
<p>to try to hit the point home.</p>
<p>In the end, of course, I was sensible and decided not to,</p>
<p>but Marx&rsquo;s letters are disgusting on these terms.</p>
<p>Since I highlighted this in this book</p>
<p>and some of the media picked it up</p>
<p>and have popularized this thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to put into the system,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re gonna accuse Churchill of racism,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna accuse Jefferson of racism,</p>
<p>Washington of racism, and so on, what about Marx?</p>
<p>The two things that Marxists have said since this came out</p>
<p>has been, first of all, why are you saying this about Marx?</p>
<p>He was a man of his time, like everyone else.</p>
<p>And the second thing they say is,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t go to Marx for his horrible abhorrent views on race.</p>
<p>So talking about mixed race people as gorillas and so on.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t go to him for that.</p>
<p>We go to him for his economic theories.</p>
<p>I say, okay, well, we don&rsquo;t go to Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>for his views on slaves.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t go to Churchill for the precise language</p>
<p>he used that points in the 1910s about Indians.</p>
<p>Or his health advice.</p>
<p>Actually, I do get him for that.</p>
<p>That explains so much.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s have some standards on this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m very suspicious of the fact</p>
<p>that the people don&rsquo;t do this with Marx</p>
<p>because I think what they&rsquo;re trying,</p>
<p>what some people are trying to do,</p>
<p>and this may sound conspiratorial,</p>
<p>but I really don&rsquo;t think it is.</p>
<p>I think that some people are deliberately trying</p>
<p>to completely clear the cultural landscape of our past</p>
<p>in order to say there&rsquo;s nothing good.</p>
<p>Nothing you can hold on to.</p>
<p>No one you should revere.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got no heroes.</p>
<p>The whole thing comes down.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s left standing?</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;ve also got this idea from the 20th century</p>
<p>still about Marxism.</p>
<p>Well, the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>And no, no.</p>
<p>You will not have the entire landscape deracinated.</p>
<p>And then the worst ideas tried again.</p>
<p>So basically destroy all of history</p>
<p>and the lessons learned from history</p>
<p>and then start from scratch.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s completely any idea can work</p>
<p>and then you could just take whatever.</p>
<p>Well, and the thing is there are always some people</p>
<p>with pre preferred ideas.</p>
<p>And I mentioned this also with the postcolonialists.</p>
<p>The postcolonialists were really interesting</p>
<p>because when the European powers were moving</p>
<p>from Africa and the Far East,</p>
<p>postcolonial movements had one obvious move</p>
<p>they could have done, which was to say,</p>
<p>since the European powers have left,</p>
<p>we will return to a pre colonial life,</p>
<p>which in some of their places would have been returning</p>
<p>to slave markets and slave ownership</p>
<p>and slave selling and much more.</p>
<p>But put that aside for a second.</p>
<p>They could have said we have an indigenous culture</p>
<p>which we will return to.</p>
<p>Almost uniformly in the postcolonial era,</p>
<p>you had figures like France Fanon,</p>
<p>you had European intellectuals like Sartre,</p>
<p>who said the Western powers are retreating</p>
<p>from these countries and therefore we should institute</p>
<p>in these countries what but Western Marxism.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not obvious to me that like the bad ideas</p>
<p>will be the ones that emerge,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more likely the bad ideas would emerge</p>
<p>in this kind of context when you erase history,</p>
<p>when you erase tradition.</p>
<p>When you erase history and you leave some ideas</p>
<p>deliberately uninterrogated.</p>
<p>I mean, as I say, find me one in a hundred</p>
<p>American students who&rsquo;ve heard of</p>
<p>any of the communist despots of the 20th century.</p>
<p>I mean, name recognition in,</p>
<p>there was a poll done a few years ago in the UK</p>
<p>and like name recognition among children,</p>
<p>school children for Stalin, let alone Mao.</p>
<p>I mean, Mao who kills more people than anyone,</p>
<p>65 million Chinese, perhaps.</p>
<p>How many students in America know what Mao was,</p>
<p>who he was, where he was, nothing.</p>
<p>Or the atrocities committed.</p>
<p>Where the atrocities were committed.</p>
<p>And I worry about that because it means</p>
<p>that we might have learned one of the two lessons</p>
<p>of the 20th century.</p>
<p>We think we&rsquo;ve learned one of the two lessons</p>
<p>of the 20th century.</p>
<p>We actually haven&rsquo;t learned that lesson.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve learned a little bit of it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve not learned the other one at all.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s why we still have people</p>
<p>in American politics and elsewhere</p>
<p>actually talking about collectivization and things.</p>
<p>As if there&rsquo;s no problem with that.</p>
<p>And as if it&rsquo;s perfectly obvious.</p>
<p>And they could run it and they&rsquo;d know</p>
<p>exactly where to stop.</p>
<p>What are the two lessons of the 20th century?</p>
<p>Fascism and communism.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what exactly the lessons are.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not clear.</p>
<p>If the lessons were very clear,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be better at it.</p>
<p>Well, one is your book broadly applied</p>
<p>of madness of crowds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one lesson.</p>
<p>Well, how so?</p>
<p>Meaning like large crowds can display herd like behavior.</p>
<p>Yes, be very suspicious of crowds.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In general, I mean, you apply it in different,</p>
<p>more to modern application.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In a sense, but that&rsquo;s rooted in history,</p>
<p>that crowds can, when humans get together,</p>
<p>they can do some quite radically silly things.</p>
<p>Elias Kaneti is very good on that, crowds and power.</p>
<p>And Eric Hoffer, who is a sort of self taught, amazing,</p>
<p>not to say autodidactic writer,</p>
<p>the true believer and so on.</p>
<p>He was extremely good on that.</p>
<p>But the reason I mentioned the two things,</p>
<p>no, I mean, we should have realized</p>
<p>the two nightmares of the 20th century fascism and communism,</p>
<p>that we should know how they came about.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re interested in learning</p>
<p>how one of them came about, fascism.</p>
<p>And we know some of the lessons,</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t treat other people as less than you</p>
<p>because of their race.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one lesson.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve done some good at learning that.</p>
<p>But the second one, not to do communism again,</p>
<p>not to do socialism, I think we&rsquo;re way away from knowing</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know how it happened.</p>
<p>And the little temptations are still there always.</p>
<p>Look at people saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna expropriate your property.</p>
<p>If people do things they don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>they will get, we can&rsquo;t wait to take your property.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a sense, there&rsquo;s an appealing sense.</p>
<p>Okay, every ideology has an appealing narrative behind it</p>
<p>that sells the ideology.</p>
<p>So for socialism, for communism is that there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>it seems unfair that the working class</p>
<p>does all of this work and gets only a fraction of the output.</p>
<p>It just seems unfair.</p>
<p>So you wanna make it.</p>
<p>If they do get a fraction of the output, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, and so it seems to be more fair</p>
<p>if we increase that.</p>
<p>If the workers own all of the value of their output</p>
<p>and things that are more fair seems to be a good thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, well, yeah, I mean, fairness is,</p>
<p>I like fairness as a term.</p>
<p>No, I much prefer fairness</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a much easier thing to try to work out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite amorphous itself as a concept,</p>
<p>but everyone can recognize it.</p>
<p>So for instance, should the boss of the company</p>
<p>earn a million times that of the lowest paid employee?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t seem fair.</p>
<p>Should they earn maybe five or 10 times</p>
<p>the salary of the lowest employee?</p>
<p>Yeah, possibly, that could be fair.</p>
<p>There are certain sort of multiples</p>
<p>which are within the bounds of reasonableness.</p>
<p>I think actually that&rsquo;s the much bigger problem</p>
<p>in capitalism at the moment as I see it</p>
<p>is the not untrue perception</p>
<p>that a tiny number of people accrue a lot of the benefits</p>
<p>and that the bit in the middle</p>
<p>has become increasingly squeezed</p>
<p>and is at danger always of falling</p>
<p>all the way down to the bottom.</p>
<p>I mean, I think in the snakes and ladders</p>
<p>of American capitalism, for instance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a correct perception to say</p>
<p>that the snakes go down awfully far.</p>
<p>If you tread on the snake,</p>
<p>you can plummet an awfully long way in America.</p>
<p>And the deal in the game was that the ladders took you high</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a perception, and again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not entirely wrong that the ladder system</p>
<p>on the board is kind of broken.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is you&rsquo;re a Marxist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m a Marxist.</p>
<p>You heard that here first in the out of context blog post</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to write about this.</p>
<p>I get to that, I get back to this point.</p>
<p>The way to critique capitalism,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s gone bad, is to get better capitalists.</p>
<p>Free markets where they&rsquo;re not fair should be made fair.</p>
<p>Never decide that the answer is the thing</p>
<p>that has never produced any human flourishing, i.e. Marxism.</p>
<p>So as you describe in The Madness of Crowds</p>
<p>the herd like behavior of humans that gets us into trouble,</p>
<p>you as an individual thinker and others listening to this,</p>
<p>how can you, because all of us are mids crowds,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re influenced by the society that&rsquo;s around us,</p>
<p>by the people that&rsquo;s around us.</p>
<p>How can we think independently?</p>
<p>How can we, if you&rsquo;re in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>at the beginning of the 20th century,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in, I don&rsquo;t know, Nazi Germany</p>
<p>at the end of the 30s or the 40s,</p>
<p>how can you think independently?</p>
<p>Given, first of all, that it&rsquo;s hard to think independently,</p>
<p>just intellectually speaking,</p>
<p>but also that it just becomes more and more dangerous.</p>
<p>So the incentive to think independently</p>
<p>under the uncertainty that&rsquo;s usually involved with thinking</p>
<p>is, I mean, it&rsquo;s a silly thing to say,</p>
<p>but on Twitter there is a cost to be paid</p>
<p>for going against the crowd on any silly thing.</p>
<p>We can even talk about, what is it?</p>
<p>Will Smith slapping Chris Rock.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a crowd that believes that that was unjustified.</p>
<p>I forget what the crowd decided.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Crowd split on that one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to have one opinion either way.</p>
<p>Okay, it is, right.</p>
<p>But there is, you put it very nicely,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s clearly a calculus here</p>
<p>and that you can measure, on Twitter in particular,</p>
<p>you can measure kind of the crowd,</p>
<p>a sense of where the crowd lays.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Well, oh boy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to, this is not a legal discussion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have my lawyer present.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even have a lawyer.</p>
<p>The man in question is dead.</p>
<p>But I think most people who are not just diehard fans</p>
<p>would concede that Michael Jackson</p>
<p>had a strange relationship with children</p>
<p>and was almost certainly a pedophile.</p>
<p>Is that, was that, did the crowd agree on that?</p>
<p>No, the crowd hasn&rsquo;t agreed because he&rsquo;s too famous</p>
<p>and we all love Thriller.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do.</p>
<p>So you said people who are not fans, I just don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m a fan of Michael Jackson,</p>
<p>but I think he was almost certainly a pedophile.</p>
<p>And, but nobody wants to give up dancing to bad at weddings.</p>
<p>So they just kind of added in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Seriously, it&rsquo;s a genius.</p>
<p>Your law does not apply to Bill Cosby.</p>
<p>Well, he wasn&rsquo;t, he was, of course,</p>
<p>one of the most famous people in America.</p>
<p>But maybe he wasn&rsquo;t regarded as talented.</p>
<p>Oh, oh wow, there&rsquo;s depth to this calculation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a genius opt out in all cultures.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a genius opt out in all cultures.</p>
<p>Look at Lord Byron.</p>
<p>Lord Byron shagged his sister.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t affect his reputation.</p>
<p>In fact, if anything, it kind of adds to it.</p>
<p>But then again, this kind of war against the West,</p>
<p>genius is actually makes you more likely,</p>
<p>or no, to get canceled.</p>
<p>So if you look at the genius of Thomas Jefferson, or&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, yes, because if you haven&rsquo;t done anything remarkable,</p>
<p>nobody will come looking for you passively, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, so genius can get you in trouble eventually.</p>
<p>Sidle through life with nobody noticing.</p>
<p>Be totally harmless and then die</p>
<p>and hope you haven&rsquo;t used any carbon.</p>
<p>But you were asking about how to survive</p>
<p>the era of social media, as it were, and the crowds.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very simple answer to that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t overrate the significance of the unreal world.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, but this is still human psychology.</p>
<p>Because you want to fit in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, you want to&hellip;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you like people, and you&rsquo;re just as a&hellip;</p>
<p>Why not just like a small number of people</p>
<p>and ignore the rest?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I actually like most people,</p>
<p>and that isn&rsquo;t a general thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have detestation for most people at all.</p>
<p>Most people I kind of enjoy speaking with and being with.</p>
<p>But in terms of storing your sense of self worth</p>
<p>in absolute strangers, big mistake.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, me, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Listen, let&rsquo;s turn into a therapy session.</p>
<p>Because for me, and I think I represent</p>
<p>some number of population, is I&rsquo;m pretty self critical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for myself in the world.</p>
<p>And there is a depth of connection</p>
<p>with people on the internet.</p>
<p>I mean, I have some&hellip;</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a shallowness of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shallow connection.</p>
<p>Interesting, I&hellip;</p>
<p>Put it this way.</p>
<p>If you became very ill tomorrow, would any of them help?</p>
<p>On the internet?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Good, that&rsquo;s a good test.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good test.</p>
<p>But then at the end of the day, yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Your very close friends would help, family would help.</p>
<p>Yeah, and perhaps that&rsquo;s the only thing&hellip;</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t store significant amounts of trust,</p>
<p>or faith, or belief, or self worth</p>
<p>in places which will not return it to you.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about the more extreme case,</p>
<p>the harsher case.</p>
<p>When you talk about the things you talk about</p>
<p>in the war on the West and madness of crowds,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re getting a lot of blowback, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>As for the listener, you just shrugged lightly.</p>
<p>It was a zen like look on your face.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>All you need is Sam Harris to say</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re brilliant and you&rsquo;re happy.</p>
<p>No, no, I love Sam.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Deeply pleased when he flatters me, but I mean,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s nice about me, but no, I don&rsquo;t just rely on Sam.</p>
<p>No, I mean, why would I mind?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s self selecting.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t have the view I had about that,</p>
<p>or whatever armory it is that I have on that,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t do what I did, maybe.</p>
<p>I mean, have you been to some dark places psychologically</p>
<p>because of the challenging ideas you explore?</p>
<p>So like significant self doubt, just kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve been unaffected by everything in my life.</p>
<p>By any means, that would make me an automaton of some kind.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely times I&rsquo;ve got things wrong</p>
<p>and regretted that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s times I&rsquo;ve&hellip;</p>
<p>There was a period around the time I wrote my book,</p>
<p>The Strange Death of Europe,</p>
<p>which was a very, very dark time.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t because I was having a dark time in my life,</p>
<p>but because of the book I was writing.</p>
<p>Oh, because of the places you had to go</p>
<p>in order to write that book.</p>
<p>And, well, I was contemplating the end of a civilization.</p>
<p>So occasionally now I have maybe slightly too pat</p>
<p>at this stage, but sometimes readers come up to me</p>
<p>in the street or whatever and say,</p>
<p>you know, I love The Strange Death of Europe.</p>
<p>And will say, you know, very depressing book to read,</p>
<p>however, I would say, well, you should have tried</p>
<p>writing it.</p>
<p>But it was because, I mean, it has chunks of it,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m very proud of in particular</p>
<p>about the death of religion, the death of God,</p>
<p>the loss of meaning and the void.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s difficult stuff to write about</p>
<p>and to grapple with.</p>
<p>And there is a sort of, I haven&rsquo;t reread that book</p>
<p>since it came out,</p>
<p>but I think there are passages in it</p>
<p>which reveal what I was thinking very clearly</p>
<p>in the poetry of it, as it were, as well as the detail.</p>
<p>But, yeah, I can&rsquo;t say, I&rsquo;m used to saying</p>
<p>what I think and what I see.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s any pushback I&rsquo;ve got from that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely consoled that I&rsquo;m saying what I see</p>
<p>with my own eyes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your source of strength,</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re always seeking the truth as best you see it.</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t agree to go along with a lie</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve seen something with my own eyes.</p>
<p>Do you ever, so speaking of Sam Harris,</p>
<p>and I mentioned to you offline, a lot of people,</p>
<p>I talk to a lot of smart people in my private life</p>
<p>on this podcast, and a lot of them will reference you</p>
<p>as their example of a very smart person.</p>
<p>So given that compliment, do you ever worry</p>
<p>that your sort of ego grows to a level</p>
<p>where what you think is the truth is no longer the truth?</p>
<p>Is this kind of, it blinds you?</p>
<p>And also, on top of that,</p>
<p>the fact that you stand against the crowd often,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s part of it that appeals to you,</p>
<p>that you like to point out the emperor has no clothes.</p>
<p>I get a certain thrill from the friction.</p>
<p>Yeah, that sometimes both your ego</p>
<p>and the thrill of friction will get you</p>
<p>to deviate from the truth and instead,</p>
<p>just look for the friction.</p>
<p>Could do, could do for sure.</p>
<p>I try to keep alive to that.</p>
<p>I mean, early in my career, I realized that, for instance,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to make enemies unnecessarily,</p>
<p>any more than strictly necessary,</p>
<p>because there was a very large number</p>
<p>of already necessary enemies.</p>
<p>And I remember once, I won&rsquo;t go into the details,</p>
<p>but I already had one sort of thing I&rsquo;d done that week,</p>
<p>and then another thing came out,</p>
<p>and I just thought, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking, don&rsquo;t be the sort of person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s forever creating storms,</p>
<p>and I tried to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve pretty much stuck to that.</p>
<p>But to answer your question,</p>
<p>well, the first thing is I&rsquo;m as confident as I can be</p>
<p>that I wouldn&rsquo;t fall into the trap you described.</p>
<p>Two reasons.</p>
<p>I mean, one is that I don&rsquo;t think of myself</p>
<p>as a wildly intelligent person,</p>
<p>partly because I&rsquo;m very, very aware</p>
<p>of the things I know nothing about.</p>
<p>I mean, for instance, I have almost no knowledge</p>
<p>of the details of finance or economic theory.</p>
<p>I mean, the real details.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean the big picture of the kind</p>
<p>that we were just discussing earlier,</p>
<p>but I have, if you put the periodic table in front of me,</p>
<p>the periodic table in front of me,</p>
<p>I would struggle to do more than a handful.</p>
<p>I am very conscious of huge gaps in my knowledge.</p>
<p>And where I have gaps or chasms,</p>
<p>I tend to find that I have a disproportionate admiration</p>
<p>for the people who know that stuff.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m wildly impressed by people who understand money,</p>
<p>really understand it, because I think,</p>
<p>how the hell do you do that?</p>
<p>And the same thing with biologists, medics,</p>
<p>stuff I just know very little about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a source of humility for you, just knowing that.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, I think, well, I can get on that stuff,</p>
<p>but I mean, Jesus, if you got me on the general knowledge.</p>
<p>I would say that thing, some years ago,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thing in the UK called University Challenge.</p>
<p>And I was asked some years ago on to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sort of psych celebrity,</p>
<p>one of former students of the universities or colleges</p>
<p>asked to go back for the Christmas special.</p>
<p>And I was asked to be one of the people from my old college</p>
<p>to go back and compete in the sort of celebrity alumni one.</p>
<p>And the only thing I actually wanted to do,</p>
<p>it was go discover the Louis Theroux</p>
<p>had been to my college before my time.</p>
<p>And he was on, he&rsquo;d agreed to be on the team.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, I&rsquo;d love to meet Louis Theroux,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be great fun.</p>
<p>And anyhow, and I said, well, I really don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p>
<p>And they said, come on, you&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>I said, I wouldn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d show myself up</p>
<p>to be a total asshole and ignoramus.</p>
<p>And as it was, I sat down my flat</p>
<p>and I watched some past episodes of University Challenge.</p>
<p>I realized I&rsquo;d have just sat mute for the whole half hour.</p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t, the first question was about physics.</p>
<p>And the second one was about, as it was,</p>
<p>I watched the one and I could answer the first two</p>
<p>or three questions of the one that actually went out</p>
<p>because they made it a bit simpler.</p>
<p>But I mean, I&rsquo;m terribly conscious of the,</p>
<p>and I said to the producers, I said, I can&rsquo;t go on</p>
<p>because I mean, I just couldn&rsquo;t answer the questions.</p>
<p>These unbelievably smart students seem to be able to answer</p>
<p>on a whole range of things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m perfectly aware of my limitations and&hellip;</p>
<p>You contemplate your limitations.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they&rsquo;re forever before me, you know.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not hard to find in every day.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, I suppose, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>in a way, you know that line from Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s</p>
<p>alternately brilliant and slightly nauseating poem, If?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a line.</p>
<p>You just enjoy a good poem, can you?</p>
<p>Well, no, it&rsquo;s not, I can enjoy a great poem.</p>
<p>But I mean, a good poem.</p>
<p>This is, you know, slightly off.</p>
<p>But, well, it&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>This goes to your criticism of Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>Take Douglas&rsquo;s criticism with a grain of salt, so.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ve read it too many memorial services and things.</p>
<p>But that line is a good piece of advice.</p>
<p>If you can learn to meet triumph and disaster</p>
<p>and greet these two imposters just the same.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s skipping off an amazing turn of line.</p>
<p>But I do think that it&rsquo;s a very sensible thing</p>
<p>to try to greet triumph and disaster</p>
<p>and regard them as imposters and greet them just the same.</p>
<p>And actually, anyone who knows me knows that I never,</p>
<p>partly it&rsquo;s because I have a sort of belief in the old gods</p>
<p>and that the moment that I thought</p>
<p>that I was at the moment of triumph,</p>
<p>the fates would hitch up their skirts</p>
<p>and run at me at a million miles an hour.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also because, anyone who knows me knows</p>
<p>I never have a moment when I say,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just great.</p>
<p>I feel totally fulfilled and victorious.</p>
<p>I mean, it happened to me recently</p>
<p>when the war in the West went straight to number one</p>
<p>in the bestseller list.</p>
<p>How long did that last in terms of your self satisfaction?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Not even for a brief moment?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>When I first saw that it was selling,</p>
<p>I had that moment of elation.</p>
<p>I thought, good, I&rsquo;ve done it, it&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>And I did have a moment of elation then, definitely.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t last, partly because I tell myself</p>
<p>it mustn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>Because as you said, fate hitches up its skirt.</p>
<p>Is that skirts?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, this, you brits with your poetry,</p>
<p>even when it&rsquo;s nauseating.</p>
<p>As of 2022, this year, what&rsquo;s your final analysis</p>
<p>of the political leadership and the human mind</p>
<p>and the human being of Donald Trump?</p>
<p>I sort of avoided this for years.</p>
<p>Just talking about Trump.</p>
<p>Tried to avoid talking about Trump for years.</p>
<p>Same reason I tried to avoid writing about Brexit.</p>
<p>Do you think that Trump, just sorry on a small tangent,</p>
<p>do you think that Trump&rsquo;s story is over</p>
<p>or are we just done with volume one?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>The people I know who know him say that he&rsquo;s running.</p>
<p>And I think that in general, Republicans have to,</p>
<p>do have a choice in front of them.</p>
<p>A one friend put it to me recently, said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to go in with your toughest fighter.</p>
<p>And I understand that instinct and I also think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very dangerous instinct</p>
<p>because what if your toughest fighter</p>
<p>is also your biggest liability?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best way to get out the Democrat vote</p>
<p>in 2024 than to have Donald Trump running?</p>
<p>And the people that are doing the war in the West,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty tough fighters.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m cautious about this because I know every way</p>
<p>I tread it&rsquo;s dangerous, but let me just be frank.</p>
<p>Tread gracefully.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tread as gracefully as I can.</p>
<p>My Wellington boots, my galoshes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, I think everybody knows what Trump is.</p>
<p>I think we all knew for years.</p>
<p>And I feel sorry for the conservatives who had to pretend</p>
<p>that he was something he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I felt sorry for the ones who had to pretend</p>
<p>that for instance he was some devout Christian</p>
<p>or a man of faith or a man of great integrity</p>
<p>or all of these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Because in the public eye for years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be obvious that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>But he has something extraordinary.</p>
<p>One thing is a method of communication</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve just got to say was unbelievable.</p>
<p>In one fundamental way that you can&rsquo;t look away</p>
<p>for some reason.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t look away.</p>
<p>I mean, I mean watching him clear everyone out of the way</p>
<p>in 2016 was thrilling</p>
<p>because those people needed clearing away.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, it&rsquo;s just horrifying.</p>
<p>What America is going to give us another Bush?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so great about this family?</p>
<p>America is going to give us another Clinton.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get to choose any Clinton on the Bush.</p>
<p>Mark Stein said, whatever, we&rsquo;ll just wait for the day</p>
<p>the Clintons and the Bushes into marry</p>
<p>and then we can really have a monarchy again.</p>
<p>So I was very pleased to see him clear them away.</p>
<p>I was very pleased to see him sort of raise</p>
<p>some of the issues that needed raising.</p>
<p>I thought it was a sort of breath of fresh air</p>
<p>and I wished it wasn&rsquo;t him doing it.</p>
<p>And then there was a question of him governing</p>
<p>and it was just perfectly clear</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know how to govern.</p>
<p>What he did have, however, what he does have</p>
<p>is an incredible ability to fight.</p>
<p>And some of the forces he was arraigned against</p>
<p>were arraigned against him.</p>
<p>My gosh, they would have taken down anyone else.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;d have probably done some similar BS</p>
<p>against Ted Cruz if he, you know, or Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;d have said, some people admitted,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d have accused all these people of racism</p>
<p>and misogyny and everything else as well,</p>
<p>just like they did Mitt Romney,</p>
<p>just like they did John McCain.</p>
<p>But Trump was the one ugly enough</p>
<p>and bruisey enough to fight.</p>
<p>And also a willingness or a lack of willingness</p>
<p>to play sort of the civil game of politics.</p>
<p>You know, at a party when politeness gets you in trouble.</p>
<p>You show up and everybody&rsquo;s polite</p>
<p>and you just out of momentum want to be being polite</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you&rsquo;re on an island</p>
<p>with Jeffrey Epstein and it gets you</p>
<p>into a huge amount of trouble.</p>
<p>But so Trump has these sort of extraordinary qualities,</p>
<p>but I just, you know, look, he screwed up</p>
<p>during his time in office because he didn&rsquo;t achieve</p>
<p>as much as he should have done.</p>
<p>And you could say that about every president,</p>
<p>but I refuse to acknowledge that two years</p>
<p>when he had both houses in the beginning,</p>
<p>he just didn&rsquo;t know what levers to pull.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, he was sitting in the office</p>
<p>behind the Oval Office tweeting, watching the news.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, that&rsquo;s not a president.</p>
<p>And he couldn&rsquo;t fill and didn&rsquo;t fill positions</p>
<p>because people knew, I mean,</p>
<p>people who were very loyal to him,</p>
<p>he would just, you know, he&rsquo;d get them to do something loyal</p>
<p>and then destroy them.</p>
<p>And I think, and then we get onto the thing about,</p>
<p>and here we get onto the, you know,</p>
<p>what of course is very, very fractious terrain,</p>
<p>but, you know, I covered the 2020 election</p>
<p>and I was traveling all around the states</p>
<p>and I went to Trump rally and all sorts of stuff.</p>
<p>And I, I mean, I was in DC on election night</p>
<p>and it got very ugly at one point</p>
<p>in so called Black Lives Matter Plaza.</p>
<p>When it looked like Trump might win,</p>
<p>when Florida came in and got really,</p>
<p>I could feel the air were very, very heated</p>
<p>and like some Antifa people started getting into black lock</p>
<p>and this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>And I thought this town is gonna burn, you know,</p>
<p>if Trump wins.</p>
<p>And in the aftermath of the vote,</p>
<p>I was willing to hang around in Washington for a bit</p>
<p>and then I saw what it was gonna drag on.</p>
<p>And I saw some of his people and others and people told me</p>
<p>they had great evidence of vote rigging</p>
<p>and all this sort of thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m one of those people</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t believe that the evidence that they presented</p>
<p>is good enough to justify the claim</p>
<p>that he won the election.</p>
<p>And I, and people say, have you seen 2000 mules</p>
<p>and have you seen, look, the evidence isn&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>that the election was won by Donald Trump.</p>
<p>And I think that what he did on January the 6th</p>
<p>was unbelievably dangerous.</p>
<p>And, you know, here it is possible for us to hold two ideas</p>
<p>in our head at the same time.</p>
<p>January the 6th was not nothing,</p>
<p>nor was it an insurrection and attempt to stage a coup.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a vanishing number of people in the US.</p>
<p>It was Eric Weinstein who said that the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, this is the roof that you have to walk along.</p>
<p>And like the sides are very steep</p>
<p>if you fall off either side.</p>
<p>Is there some sense, given the forces</p>
<p>that are waging war in the West,</p>
<p>you said this feeling, perhaps because of Antifa</p>
<p>or something else, that this town is gonna burn</p>
<p>and maybe a continued feeling that this town</p>
<p>is going to burn with the January 6th events.</p>
<p>Are you worried about the future of the United States</p>
<p>in the coming years because of the feeling of escalation?</p>
<p>Is that just a war of Twitter?</p>
<p>Or is there a real brewing of something?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>And how, well, let me then respond to that.</p>
<p>How, what is the hopeful?</p>
<p>If you 10 years from now look back at the United States</p>
<p>and say we turned it around, what would be the reason?</p>
<p>What would be the ways, the mechanisms that we do so?</p>
<p>Tell you, since I wrote this book,</p>
<p>there are two things in particular</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been really pleased that a specific type</p>
<p>of specialist has approached me on</p>
<p>to say that things I&rsquo;ve written about</p>
<p>actually have more application than I realized.</p>
<p>One is the gratitude issue.</p>
<p>A number of people have approached me</p>
<p>who have gone through AA, Alcoholics Anonymous.</p>
<p>They sometimes say, have you ever been to AA?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a bit of a personal question.</p>
<p>But they say, but the reason they ask it is because they say,</p>
<p>well, because if you go to drug rehabilitation</p>
<p>or Alcoholics Anonymous, Norm Macdonald said,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t sound very anonymous.</p>
<p>You stand up in a room, you say your name</p>
<p>and you tell everyone the worst things you&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>
<p>Sounds the opposite of anonymous.</p>
<p>Anyhow, but they say, look,</p>
<p>because if you go to these things,</p>
<p>apparently you&rsquo;re asked to, as part of your recovery,</p>
<p>say what you&rsquo;re grateful for,</p>
<p>like list what you&rsquo;re grateful for.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that by the way, until the book was out.</p>
<p>And so that turned out to have more application</p>
<p>than I knew.</p>
<p>The other thing though, is that I say</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s absolutely crucial in America</p>
<p>that we try to find things that we agree on.</p>
<p>And a couple of times since the book came out,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been approached by people who are marriage counselors.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve also said, have you ever been</p>
<p>through marriage counseling?</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s a very personal question.</p>
<p>Stop asking me personal questions.</p>
<p>No, but they said, and I said, well, why?</p>
<p>Because this is one of the things that we do</p>
<p>in couples therapy, is try to find things you agree on.</p>
<p>And I think this is very important in America.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s made much harder by the fact,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve said this many times,</p>
<p>but forgive me if I&rsquo;m repeating myself,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s made much harder by the fact</p>
<p>that having different opinions is very last century.</p>
<p>Now we all have different facts,</p>
<p>or at least the two sides have different facts.</p>
<p>One half of the country roughly,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say 40%, 30%, whatever you want to put it,</p>
<p>with a tired minority in the middle.</p>
<p>One segment of the country believes</p>
<p>that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election</p>
<p>and that the Russians interfered</p>
<p>and got Donald Trump into power.</p>
<p>Another half of the country believes</p>
<p>that Donald Trump won the 2020 election.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t agree on who wins elections,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to see what you agree on as a country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons I mind the war</p>
<p>on American history and Western history,</p>
<p>is one of the things you have to agree on</p>
<p>is at least some attitude towards your past.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to agree on everything.</p>
<p>But the public square has to have public heroes</p>
<p>who are agreed to be heroes to some extent,</p>
<p>warts and all.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>if actually you think for instance,</p>
<p>half the country thinks the founding fathers</p>
<p>were pretty good,</p>
<p>the other half thinks they were absolutely rotten,</p>
<p>racist and so on.</p>
<p>If half the country basically thinks</p>
<p>it would have been better if Columbus</p>
<p>had taken a different turn, never found America,</p>
<p>gone back home and said, I don&rsquo;t know, nothing out there,</p>
<p>that would have been better.</p>
<p>And the other half&rsquo;s pretty glad in the end</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve got America.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to agree on something.</p>
<p>And I just see in America,</p>
<p>I do think we&rsquo;ve got to try to find things to agree on,</p>
<p>like a reasonable attitude towards the past.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why that matters.</p>
<p>And again, I stress, I&rsquo;m not trying to say</p>
<p>that everything in the American past was good.</p>
<p>God knows that wouldn&rsquo;t stand up to a second of scrutiny</p>
<p>or self scrutiny.</p>
<p>But nor was it all bad.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a country formed in sin</p>
<p>and in an eradicable sin.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t founded in 1619</p>
<p>in order to make the country wicked</p>
<p>and incapable of escaping that wickedness.</p>
<p>These are things that will matter enormously</p>
<p>in the years ahead,</p>
<p>because if you can&rsquo;t agree on anything,</p>
<p>including who your heroes are,</p>
<p>the whole thing is just one massive division</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see what I think we&rsquo;re already seeing,</p>
<p>which is people basically going to states</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s more like the life they want to live.</p>
<p>And some people say to me, well, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And the genius of the founding is that it allows for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s possible, but it&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>it eradicates part of what has been American public life,</p>
<p>which is the ability to look at each other</p>
<p>and discuss face to face.</p>
<p>And I see things like this bomb placed under America</p>
<p>the other week with the Supreme Court League,</p>
<p>the draft league as being just a further example of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very, very worried about it in America.</p>
<p>And because if America screws up everything,</p>
<p>everything else in the world goes.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s the degree to which America is still</p>
<p>the beacon of these ideas on which the country was founded</p>
<p>and has been able to live out in better and better forms,</p>
<p>sort of live out the actual ideals of the founding principles</p>
<p>versus like.</p>
<p>And with the desire to improve.</p>
<p>Yeah, constantly.</p>
<p>An imperfect union.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, as I generally have hope that people want</p>
<p>to sort of, in terms of gratitude,</p>
<p>people are aware of how good it feels to be grateful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a better life psychologically.</p>
<p>The resentment is a thing that destroys you from within.</p>
<p>So I just feel that people will long for that</p>
<p>and will find that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the American way.</p>
<p>Some of the division that we reveal now has to do</p>
<p>with new technologies like social media.</p>
<p>That kind of is a small kind of deviation</p>
<p>from the path we&rsquo;re on because it&rsquo;s a new,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a new toy, just like nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Yeah, which are relatively new.</p>
<p>But we need to find reasonable attitudes</p>
<p>towards these things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I say it matters how you and my feedback</p>
<p>on social media, because we&rsquo;re all going through it</p>
<p>to some extent.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got to learn how to do this without going mad.</p>
<p>I say this, it was my minimalist call to friends</p>
<p>in this era was the main job is not to go insane.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And yeah, like walk towards sanity.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a Hunter S. Thompson quote</p>
<p>in there, like insanity on the weekends</p>
<p>can be at least fun.</p>
<p>Okay, do you have advice for young people</p>
<p>that just put down their TikTok and are listening</p>
<p>to this podcast in high school and college</p>
<p>about how to have a career, how to have a life</p>
<p>they can be proud of?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very broad question.</p>
<p>But of course, I mean, I can give specific advice</p>
<p>to people who want to be writers and so on,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a bit niche, maybe.</p>
<p>Well, writers will be very interesting,</p>
<p>sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>Also how to put your ideas down on paper</p>
<p>and think through the ideas, develop them</p>
<p>and have the guts to go to a large audience,</p>
<p>especially when the ideas are sort of controversial</p>
<p>or dangerous or difficult.</p>
<p>Well, the main thing to do is to read.</p>
<p>When I was a schoolboy, I&rsquo;d ever have a book in my pocket,</p>
<p>the side pocket of my jacket, only side pocket,</p>
<p>and would read.</p>
<p>And that wasn&rsquo;t just because I was swatish in some way,</p>
<p>but because I discovered probably at some point</p>
<p>in my early teens, I discovered something.</p>
<p>I wrote about this once.</p>
<p>I discovered that books were dangerous,</p>
<p>which was a thrilling discovery.</p>
<p>I discovered that they could contain anything.</p>
<p>And also people didn&rsquo;t know what you were reading.</p>
<p>I remember I get far too young an age,</p>
<p>I read The Doors of Perception of Aldous Huxley,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t make head or tail of it probably,</p>
<p>but I knew that it was about something really interesting</p>
<p>and dangerous.</p>
<p>And I thought constantly when I read poetry</p>
<p>or read history, I think I was just constantly thrilled</p>
<p>and wanted to know more.</p>
<p>And if you wanna become a writer, you have to be a reader.</p>
<p>You have to read the best stuff.</p>
<p>And obviously people disagree or agree on what that is,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll find the people that really impress you.</p>
<p>But I know that I just came across certain writers</p>
<p>who just knocked me off my feet.</p>
<p>And when you find those people, read everything</p>
<p>and cling on to them and find other people like that,</p>
<p>find other writers like that, people that are connected</p>
<p>by history or scholarship or circles or whatever.</p>
<p>For you, was it fiction or nonfiction?</p>
<p>Is there a particular books that you just remember</p>
<p>or just give you pause?</p>
<p>Well, I remember that the first book</p>
<p>that absolutely threw me was the Lord of the Flies</p>
<p>of William Golding, which used to be a signed text</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s a bit snotty about because it&rsquo;s so popular.</p>
<p>But I was thrown because I think it was the first adult book</p>
<p>I read in that I had been used to the world</p>
<p>of children&rsquo;s literature of everything ends up fine</p>
<p>in the end, the lost all get found.</p>
<p>And this was the first book I read where that&rsquo;s not the case</p>
<p>the world turns out differently.</p>
<p>And I remember for days afterwards,</p>
<p>I was just in a state of shock.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I&rsquo;d just discovered</p>
<p>and partly because I sort of intuited it must be true.</p>
<p>And of course, that is not to say that the Lord of the Flies</p>
<p>lots of scholarship on what children do in this situation</p>
<p>of being on the island when they do congregate and anyhow.</p>
<p>But yes, that was a sort of introduction to the adult world</p>
<p>and it was shocking and thrilling and I wanted more of it.</p>
<p>It was dangerous.</p>
<p>And it was dangerous.</p>
<p>And then of course, when I became interested in sex,</p>
<p>let alone when I realized I was gay,</p>
<p>I realized books were a very, very good way to learn</p>
<p>about what I was.</p>
<p>And that was even more dangerous in a way.</p>
<p>And I thought, I mean, nobody knows what I know.</p>
<p>You discovered sex, that was an invention in books?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>No, what I mean is, nobody, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>What I mean is that one of the things that gay people have</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re growing up is that</p>
<p>you have this terribly big secret</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t think the world will ever know,</p>
<p>you hope the world will never know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been called by one psychologist,</p>
<p>the little boy with a big secret.</p>
<p>And so if you discover that other people</p>
<p>have the same secret, there&rsquo;s a sort of,</p>
<p>thank God for that.</p>
<p>But I mean, that&rsquo;s just a version</p>
<p>of what everybody gets in reading in a way,</p>
<p>which is the thrill of discovery</p>
<p>that somebody else thought something you thought</p>
<p>only you&rsquo;d thought.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the greatest thrills in all of literature</p>
<p>is when a voice comes from across the centuries</p>
<p>and seems to leave a handprint, you know.</p>
<p>And makes you feel a little bit less alone</p>
<p>because somebody else feels,</p>
<p>sees the world the same way, is the same way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what C.S. Lewis is said to have said,</p>
<p>we read to know we&rsquo;re not alone.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t only read to know we&rsquo;re not alone,</p>
<p>we read to become other people.</p>
<p>I mean, I think I saw in books</p>
<p>a version of the life I wanted to live</p>
<p>and then I decided to live it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to have done so.</p>
<p>I wanted to live in the world of ideas</p>
<p>and books and debate.</p>
<p>I wanted to live in the debates of my time, you know.</p>
<p>And I remember when, like a lot of people,</p>
<p>I read Auden when I was young.</p>
<p>And, you know, certain lines obviously stuck with me.</p>
<p>But that poem of his which everybody, you know,</p>
<p>knows and which he hated, September the 1st, 1939,</p>
<p>I remember certain lines in that just like whacked me.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that one, you know, sitting on a dive</p>
<p>and for a second or three, degraded and alone,</p>
<p>at the end of a low, dishonest decade.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a problem with that line,</p>
<p>which is you kind of want to be living</p>
<p>at the end of a low, dishonest decade as well.</p>
<p>It sounds sort of cool in a way.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re the only person who sees it.</p>
<p>But, so yeah, anyhow, that&rsquo;s the diversion.</p>
<p>But the point is, if you want to be a writer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to be a reader.</p>
<p>And apart from anything else,</p>
<p>you discover the lilt of language</p>
<p>and the things you can do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve read people who, and I still do,</p>
<p>I think, my God, I didn&rsquo;t know, how did you do that?</p>
<p>In fact, books for me now, and articles and other things,</p>
<p>fall into two categories.</p>
<p>One is, I know how you did that.</p>
<p>And the other is, I don&rsquo;t know how you did that.</p>
<p>And the best feeling as a writer</p>
<p>is when you do the second one.</p>
<p>And it happens occasionally in my writing life.</p>
<p>Will you almost like return to something you&rsquo;ve written</p>
<p>or like right after you write it?</p>
<p>No, the moment you write it.</p>
<p>You wonder, how did I do that?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most, I&rsquo;ve never said that before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the happiest thing in writing.</p>
<p>Very occasionally, it sounds,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve occasionally finished something.</p>
<p>Funny enough, it happened some years ago</p>
<p>in a long piece I wrote about the artist, Basquiat.</p>
<p>I finished the piece and I gasped.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know, because that&rsquo;s also a thing with writing,</p>
<p>is you, it&rsquo;s not, sometimes people say you need to write</p>
<p>in order to know what you think.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not quite true.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s a very bad piece of advice</p>
<p>for some writers who don&rsquo;t know what they think</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna become clearer</p>
<p>if they just start typing.</p>
<p>But sometimes it is true that you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thought that&rsquo;s just waiting there</p>
<p>and a clarity that comes across</p>
<p>and suddenly the sentence emerges in your brain.</p>
<p>And by the time you typed it, you just go, yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the greatest feeling as a writer.</p>
<p>Almost like it came from somewhere else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Bakunin says about what&rsquo;s the moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Tom Stoppard&rsquo;s favorite quote</p>
<p>about Bakunin saying what happens in the moment</p>
<p>where the writer&rsquo;s pen, when he pauses,</p>
<p>where does he go in that moment?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Because I think the answer to that question</p>
<p>will help us explain consciousness</p>
<p>and all those other weird things about the human mind.</p>
<p>So that was advice for writers.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really give any advice for people in general.</p>
<p>Is that, oh, you wanna give health advice?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>To your channel, Churchill?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t wanna give health advice.</p>
<p>Clearly.</p>
<p>Because you implied that Churchill</p>
<p>was one of your early guides in that aspect.</p>
<p>So when you discovered your sexuality,</p>
<p>let me ask about love.</p>
<p>Far too personal of a question to ask a Brit.</p>
<p>But what was that like?</p>
<p>And broadly speaking, what&rsquo;s the role of love</p>
<p>in the human condition?</p>
<p>Sex and love.</p>
<p>And for you personally, discovering that you were</p>
<p>and maybe telling the world that you were gay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very perilously personal.</p>
<p>I do actually have a sort of rule</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t talk about in my personal life.</p>
<p>Rules are meant to be broken.</p>
<p>Okay, well I&rsquo;ll break it a little bit.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which growing up</p>
<p>and realizing you&rsquo;re gay differs from growing up</p>
<p>and being straight is that it&rsquo;s almost inevitable</p>
<p>that your first passions will be unrequited.</p>
<p>Oh wow, I never thought about that, yeah.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not to say, there&rsquo;s plenty of unrequited love</p>
<p>among young men for young women,</p>
<p>young women for young men, plenty of that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s almost inevitable if you&rsquo;re gay</p>
<p>that your first passions will be totally unrequited.</p>
<p>Because the odds are that the person in question</p>
<p>will not be gay.</p>
<p>So the experience of love is mostly heartbreak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heartbreak and disappointment.</p>
<p>Heartbreak can be beautiful too, it&rsquo;s formative.</p>
<p>Well again, it comes back to the thing</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a writer or something,</p>
<p>that you can always do something with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why all writers are sort of not to be trusted.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t trust you the moment you walked in here.</p>
<p>No, I mean, it&rsquo;s a famous problem with writers</p>
<p>because you always think, well I could use that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dangerous thing and all writers should be aware.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a drug, right?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not like a drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fear that all things,</p>
<p>even the greatest suffering could be material.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the danger in that exactly?</p>
<p>That seeing the material in the human experience,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t experience it fully?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t experience it fully and you might be using it.</p>
<p>I had a friend who wrote a poem about a friend</p>
<p>who died in a motorcycle accident in Sydney in the 60s.</p>
<p>And he said he knew at the moment</p>
<p>he was told about his friend&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>A tiny bit of him thought I could use this for a poem.</p>
<p>And he did and the poem was wonderful.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always that slight guilt for writers</p>
<p>of am I going to use that?</p>
<p>Anyhow, that&rsquo;s a diversion.</p>
<p>Life is full of guilty pleasures</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>Because if you feel that guilt,</p>
<p>really what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re capturing that moment</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to impact the lives of many, many people</p>
<p>by writing about that moment</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to stimulate something</p>
<p>that resonates with those people</p>
<p>because they had similar kinds of memories</p>
<p>about a loss and a passion towards somebody</p>
<p>that they had to lose.</p>
<p>So yes, but there&rsquo;s a good sign, perhaps.</p>
<p>More obvious perhaps problem is reporting from war zones</p>
<p>or bad places and wanting to find bad stories</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>And there is a definite guilt you get</p>
<p>from that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Like the worse the situation, the more useful.</p>
<p>Anyhow, no, so that&rsquo;s sort of the only difference</p>
<p>that happens from growing up being gay.</p>
<p>And it means that most, certainly in my generation,</p>
<p>most gay men came to sexual or romantic maturity later.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of explanations of that</p>
<p>maybe being one of the reasons for perceived</p>
<p>or otherwise promiscuity among gay men,</p>
<p>which is, I think, more easily persuaded</p>
<p>by the fact that gay men behave like men would</p>
<p>if women were men.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one explanation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s both a feature and a bug</p>
<p>that you come to sexual flourishing later in life.</p>
<p>That could be seen as a, in the trajectory of human life,</p>
<p>that could be a positive or a negative.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s, broadly speaking, is the role of love</p>
<p>in the human condition, Douglas?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the nearest thing we have to finding the point.</p>
<p>What is the point?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the meaning is a hard one, of course.</p>
<p>Where is the meaning is slightly easier.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say that everyone can find that.</p>
<p>You gravitate towards the places you find meaning.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a conservative answer to this,</p>
<p>which is quite useful,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s certainly more useful than any others,</p>
<p>because the conservative answer is find meaning</p>
<p>where people have found it before,</p>
<p>which is a very, very good answer.</p>
<p>If your ancestors have found meaning in a place of worship</p>
<p>or a particular canon of work, go there,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been proven by time</p>
<p>to be able to give you the goods.</p>
<p>Much more sensible than saying,</p>
<p>hey, I don&rsquo;t know, discover new ways of meaning.</p>
<p>But love is,</p>
<p>love is probably the nearest thing we can have</p>
<p>to the divine on Earth.</p>
<p>And of course, the problem of what exactly,</p>
<p>what type of love we mean is an issue.</p>
<p>Well, that goes to the fact</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t like definitions anyway.</p>
<p>I do like definitions.</p>
<p>I just think they need to be pinned down.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s not go there at the moment,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not pinned down love at the moment.</p>
<p>Well, no, because as you know,</p>
<p>I mean, because of the different varieties of love</p>
<p>and the fact that we have one word for it in our culture</p>
<p>and that it means an awful lot of things</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t delineate it well.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say human love</p>
<p>with the greatest fulfillment in sexual,</p>
<p>fulfillment in sexual love with another person</p>
<p>is probably the greatest intimation you can have</p>
<p>of what might otherwise only be superseded by divine love.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the sense that all young lovers have,</p>
<p>which is that they&rsquo;ve just walked through the low door</p>
<p>in the garden and found themselves in bliss.</p>
<p>And that this is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a beautiful, beautiful poem of,</p>
<p>can I read it to you?</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to find it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful poem of Philip Larkins,</p>
<p>which slightly says what I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying not to duck your question</p>
<p>by referring to other people, but.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the best way to answer the question.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>Is to read a poem.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a poem by Philip Larkin called High Windows,</p>
<p>which is remarkable because he came to sexual,</p>
<p>he was straight, he had a rather unhappy sex life,</p>
<p>but he came to sexual affection in the 40s and 50s</p>
<p>and all the hell that that involved.</p>
<p>And he took what I,</p>
<p>I regard as being a really remarkable and important view</p>
<p>on the sexual revolution in the 60s,</p>
<p>which is that most people of his generation,</p>
<p>most older people resented the young.</p>
<p>They resented the freedom they had,</p>
<p>and actually they pretended the freedom was terrible</p>
<p>and it was always getting likely to.</p>
<p>And Philip Larkin, rather surprisingly,</p>
<p>he was a very conservative person, took a different view.</p>
<p>And he says it in his poem,</p>
<p>and the opening of the poem is he says,</p>
<p>when I see a couple of kids and guess he&rsquo;s fucking her</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s taking pills or wearing a diaphragm,</p>
<p>I know this is paradise.</p>
<p>Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives,</p>
<p>bonds and gestures pushed to one side</p>
<p>like an outdated combine harvester,</p>
<p>and everyone young going down the long slide</p>
<p>to happiness endlessly.</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone looked at me 40 years back and thought,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be the life, no God anymore,</p>
<p>or sweating in the dark about hell and that,</p>
<p>or having to hide what you think of the priest.</p>
<p>He and his lot will all go down the long slide</p>
<p>like free bloody birds.</p>
<p>And immediately, rather than words,</p>
<p>comes the thought of high windows,</p>
<p>the some comprehending glass,</p>
<p>and beyond it the deep blue air</p>
<p>that shows nothing and is nowhere and is endless.</p>
<p>The divine, he found it.</p>
<p>He found it in seeing a couple of young kids</p>
<p>and knowing that one of them was wearing a diaphragm.</p>
<p>Do you see what I mean?</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s very counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but secondly, this is the point that sex</p>
<p>had been so tied up with misery.</p>
<p>I mean, people don&rsquo;t remember this now</p>
<p>when they talk about the past.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s one of my favorite books,</p>
<p>Stefan Zweig&rsquo;s The World of Yesterday,</p>
<p>you know, descriptions of what it was like</p>
<p>trying to have sex in pre First World War Vienna.</p>
<p>You know, all the men ended up</p>
<p>going to female prostitutes.</p>
<p>You know, so many of them got syphilis,</p>
<p>and this was their first experience of sex.</p>
<p>It was so goddamn awful,</p>
<p>and they were stuck with it all their lives.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s lots of stuff that&rsquo;s gone better</p>
<p>in our last century, and that&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>But you ask about love.</p>
<p>Yes, I do think that love is basically</p>
<p>the thing that gives us the best glimpse of the divine.</p>
<p>And by the way, sex, liberating sex,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t buy you love either.</p>
<p>No, I mean, it throws in an entirely,</p>
<p>it threw in another set of problems.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s any meaning on top of all of that</p>
<p>is we like to find problems and solve that</p>
<p>as a human species, and sometimes we even create problems.</p>
<p>Douglas, thank you for highlighting</p>
<p>all the problems of human civilization</p>
<p>and giving us a glimmer of hope for the future.</p>
<p>This is an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor, thank you.</p>
<p>It was very kind of you to say that, thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Douglas Murray.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Douglas Murray himself.</p>
<p>Disagreement is not oppression.</p>
<p>Argument is not assault.</p>
<p>Words, even provocative and repugnant ones,</p>
<p>are not violence.</p>
<p>The answer to speech we do not like is more speech.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
