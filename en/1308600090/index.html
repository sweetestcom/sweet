    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Recently, I had the pleasure of hosting two live events,</p>
<p>one in Seattle, Washington, and one in Portland, Oregon,</p>
<p>both entitled The Brain-Body Contract,</p>
<p>where I discussed science and science-related tools</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>My favorite part of each evening, however,</p>
<p>was the question-and-answer period</p>
<p>that followed the lecture.</p>
<p>I love the question-and-answer period</p>
<p>because it gives me an opportunity</p>
<p>to hear directly from the audience</p>
<p>as to what they want to know most,</p>
<p>and indeed, to get into a bit of dialogue</p>
<p>so we really clarify what are the underlying mechanisms</p>
<p>of particular tools, how best to use the tools</p>
<p>for things like focus and sleep.</p>
<p>We also touched on some things</p>
<p>related to mental health and physical health.</p>
<p>It was a delight for me,</p>
<p>and I like to think that the audience learned a lot.</p>
<p>I know that many of you weren&rsquo;t able to attend those events,</p>
<p>but we wanted to make the information available to you.</p>
<p>Therefore, what follows this is a recording</p>
<p>of the question-and-answer period</p>
<p>from the lecture in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll find it to be both interesting and informative.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to thank our sponsors of these live events.</p>
<p>The first is Momentous Supplements,</p>
<p>which is our partner with the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>providing supplements that are of the very highest quality,</p>
<p>that ship international,</p>
<p>and that are arranged in dosages</p>
<p>and single-ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that make it possible for you</p>
<p>to develop the optimal supplement strategy for you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d also like to thank our other sponsor,</p>
<p>which is InsideTracker,</p>
<p>which provides blood tests and DNA tests</p>
<p>so you can monitor your immediate</p>
<p>and long-term health progress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to announce</p>
<p>that there are two new live events scheduled.</p>
<p>The first one is going to take place Sunday, October 16th</p>
<p>at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The other live event will take place Wednesday, November 9th</p>
<p>at the Beacon Theater in New York City.</p>
<p>Tickets to both of those events are now available online</p>
<p>at hubermanlab.com slash tour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hubermanlab.com slash tour.</p>
<p>I do hope that you learn from and enjoy the recording</p>
<p>of the question and answer period that follows this.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
<p>What are the current best practices for post-TBIs,</p>
<p>traumatic brain injuries,</p>
<p>for those of you that aren&rsquo;t familiar with TBI,</p>
<p>especially long-term multiple, ooh, et cetera.</p>
<p>Thoughts on hyperbaric, oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you asked this,</p>
<p>Danny.</p>
<p>Moralage as treatment for TBIs.</p>
<p>Okay, TBI.</p>
<p>One thing about TBI and concussion,</p>
<p>everyone thinks football.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>Most of the TBI is not football.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t that many football players.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just large, so they stand out.</p>
<p>There might be a few here this evening.</p>
<p>Of course, football players are a concern</p>
<p>when it comes to TBI.</p>
<p>Most head injuries are going to be construction workers.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the hard hats they wear?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if they are just there for show.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>And we actually have a lab at Stanford</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s focused very hard on trying to solve this problem.</p>
<p>So construction workers, car accidents,</p>
<p>bicycle accidents, Portland, amazing city to cycle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m frankly afraid to cycle.</p>
<p>I feel bad for people who are small moving objects</p>
<p>around these big objects and people are staring</p>
<p>into their little aperture on their phone while driving.</p>
<p>I mean, whatever happened to that, by the way,</p>
<p>of not texting while driving?</p>
<p>Somehow, that just disappeared.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it really has just disappeared.</p>
<p>There was all this science showing</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s worse than drunk driving.</p>
<p>TBI.</p>
<p>Well, the basic rules of the don&rsquo;ts apply.</p>
<p>If you get a head injury,</p>
<p>but that often isn&rsquo;t feasible for people</p>
<p>that need to continue working construction</p>
<p>or that are struggling, what do we know?</p>
<p>Well, this is a great opportunity for me</p>
<p>to distinguish modulatory foundational tools</p>
<p>from things that directly change your brain</p>
<p>and nervous system the way that you want to.</p>
<p>What do I mean by modulatory?</p>
<p>We hear so much and there&rsquo;s so many studies</p>
<p>showing that great sleep, quality nutrition,</p>
<p>good social interactions, avoiding chronic stress,</p>
<p>and on and on and on are important for everything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re related to Alzheimer&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re related to ADHD.</p>
<p>I mean, we could do thousands of podcast episodes</p>
<p>just returning to the same 10 things.</p>
<p>Sleep, don&rsquo;t stress too much or too long,</p>
<p>good social connection, avoid toxic people,</p>
<p>eat good food, not too much processed food.</p>
<p>We could have an argument all night</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to have one about whether or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mainly plants or this.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously eating high quality food</p>
<p>is something that we should all be doing.</p>
<p>Which foods you select is a topic that is very barbed wire</p>
<p>and I can give only my opinions.</p>
<p>All of that modulates your brain function,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mediate or change anything directly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s setting a foundation of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So we should all be doing those things</p>
<p>and especially people who have TBI.</p>
<p>Now, this question relates to hyperbaric chamber.</p>
<p>Hyperbaric chamber, there&rsquo;s very interesting data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially a hyperoxygenation of the brain</p>
<p>for very brief periods of time.</p>
<p>I think the data on hyperbaric chamber and TBI</p>
<p>are very encouraging.</p>
<p>The problem is, much in the way that a few years ago,</p>
<p>cryo was only available in a few places</p>
<p>and now people are doing ice baths</p>
<p>and cold showers on their own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find a hyperbaric chamber.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t just laying around</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have them at spas typically</p>
<p>and they are quite expensive.</p>
<p>So yes, there are interesting and important data,</p>
<p>I think, on hyperbaric chamber.</p>
<p>You definitely wanna work with a physician</p>
<p>or somebody who is very skilled,</p>
<p>a practitioner who&rsquo;s very skilled in hyperbaric chamber.</p>
<p>They do seem to improve brain function</p>
<p>by hyperoxygenating the brain for brief periods of time.</p>
<p>Seems to improve a number of things.</p>
<p>But above all, it seems to improve the quality</p>
<p>and duration of sleep,</p>
<p>which indirectly allows the brain to repair itself</p>
<p>because as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>brain repair occurs or brain change largely occurs in sleep.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t have access to hyperbaric chamber,</p>
<p>but you do have TBI,</p>
<p>what are some of the other data?</p>
<p>What do those point to?</p>
<p>Well, I go on and on</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to get this from supplements,</p>
<p>you can get it from food,</p>
<p>but this threshold level of essential,</p>
<p>these EPA essential fatty acids,</p>
<p>there are now so many data,</p>
<p>so much data on the valuable role</p>
<p>of these essential EPA fatty acids,</p>
<p>thresholds being somewhere between one</p>
<p>and two grams per day of the EPA.</p>
<p>So much so, actually,</p>
<p>that there are now prescription forms of EPA</p>
<p>that doctors are starting to prescribe for people with TBI.</p>
<p>Although for most people,</p>
<p>you can get this through,</p>
<p>you can look up,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve done podcast episodes</p>
<p>about different ways to access this.</p>
<p>Also functions as an antidepressant,</p>
<p>equally good, believe it or not,</p>
<p>in clinical trials to SSRIs,</p>
<p>once one gets over the one</p>
<p>or basically two grams per day of the EPA.</p>
<p>The resident expert on the internet about this</p>
<p>is pretty extreme about the dosages</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s Dr. Rhonda Patrick,</p>
<p>who, by the way, deserves a nod</p>
<p>of acknowledgement and support</p>
<p>because it turns out that before me</p>
<p>or David Sinclair or Matt Walker</p>
<p>or any of these guys were blabbing to the world</p>
<p>about stuff that they had learned</p>
<p>in the archives of science and in their laboratories,</p>
<p>the first person in was this woman named Rhonda Patrick,</p>
<p>as far as I know,</p>
<p>the first public-facing,</p>
<p>formally trained scientist</p>
<p>to start going on all these podcasts</p>
<p>and risk her reputation</p>
<p>and this kind of stuff that you deal with</p>
<p>when you put your neck out there like that.</p>
<p>And Rhonda&rsquo;s, I think, terrific.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t agree on everything,</p>
<p>and it would be weird if we did,</p>
<p>but I think she&rsquo;s really been the proponent</p>
<p>of these higher doses of EPAs for TBI</p>
<p>and for cognitive function into all ages.</p>
<p>We often hear about ways to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>However, are there effective ways to decrease dopamine</p>
<p>when you get too much of it for certain behaviors</p>
<p>or habits we wanna break?</p>
<p>Katie Hamm, I think, is the last name.</p>
<p>Thank you, Katie, for your question.</p>
<p>Yeah, dopamine is a slippery slope,</p>
<p>and Dr. Anna Lembke is the expert in this,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve had a lot of conversations.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s one of my closer friends on the faculty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her,</p>
<p>our coffee discussions often last four hours or more,</p>
<p>her poor patients and family.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>When dopamine is higher in your brain and body,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve deployed it through excitement</p>
<p>or pharmacology or otherwise,</p>
<p>it tends to narrow your focus</p>
<p>and make you seek more of it in that general theme</p>
<p>that you happen to be focused on.</p>
<p>Could be anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the scary thing about dopamine.</p>
<p>What can you do to control it and to reduce it?</p>
<p>Well, for those of you that are engaging</p>
<p>in habits that are healthy,</p>
<p>maybe that doesn&rsquo;t require reducing dopamine.</p>
<p>How do you define healthy versus unhealthy?</p>
<p>Well, I think the simplest way to define addiction,</p>
<p>at least by my mind,</p>
<p>is that addiction is a progressive narrowing</p>
<p>of the things that bring you pleasure,</p>
<p>and a good life is a progressive expansion</p>
<p>of the things that bring you pleasure.</p>
<p>A rather simple definition,</p>
<p>and yet when we think about the biology of dopamine,</p>
<p>dopamine is not unique to one pursuit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unique to the pursuit of sex</p>
<p>or the pursuit of warmth when you&rsquo;re cold</p>
<p>or cool environments when you&rsquo;re too warm</p>
<p>or food or social media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a dumb molecule that puts you</p>
<p>into this forward state of mass,</p>
<p>small visual aperture,</p>
<p>and a kind of obsessive-like nature.</p>
<p>What can you do to counter that?</p>
<p>Well, the best thing to do is to not get</p>
<p>into that state too long,</p>
<p>but if you do, the best thing you can do</p>
<p>is to try and switch off that system,</p>
<p>not through pharmacology,</p>
<p>but by not pursuing more dopamine.</p>
<p>The day after a big event,</p>
<p>the so-called postpartum depression,</p>
<p>named, of course, because of true postpartum</p>
<p>after the delivery of a child</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s quite common for people to get very, very depressed,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of neurochemical</p>
<p>and hormonal adjustments that are occurring,</p>
<p>but different types of postpartum depression occur.</p>
<p>After a big party, the Monday blues,</p>
<p>the Sunday blues, the post-whatever blues,</p>
<p>the four-month mark in a relationship</p>
<p>is typically when dopamine starts to drop.</p>
<p>I always tell people, just wait.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling somebody very close to me right now,</p>
<p>just wait four months.</p>
<p>Four months, four months,</p>
<p>and also spend as much time with that person as possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what this deal is</p>
<p>about not spending as much time with people.</p>
<p>I think people are afraid that the dopamine wave pool</p>
<p>is just gonna pull them both under.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve called that</p>
<p>the escalator model of relationship,</p>
<p>where you just sort of find yourself in the relationship</p>
<p>because you went through the stages</p>
<p>without actually deciding on them in any event.</p>
<p>Four months seems to be the stage</p>
<p>in which the dopamine crescendo starts</p>
<p>to relax a little bit,</p>
<p>not in a long-distance relationship, however.</p>
<p>We know this, right?</p>
<p>Anticipation is dopamine, that positive anticipation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole beautiful science of this,</p>
<p>and I should say psychology of this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful book, actually.</p>
<p>The name of the book is embarrassing, always.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, for me to say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by a psychologist called Ken Love Last,</p>
<p>which is a psychoanalytic book</p>
<p>about this dopamine-serotonin system</p>
<p>and the kind of seesawing back and forth,</p>
<p>and the fact that in relationships,</p>
<p>people often just slam on the dopamine side of things,</p>
<p>and then they hit a wall and wanna break up,</p>
<p>or they go into this warm, cozy, fuzzy-feeling thing,</p>
<p>and they go, well, I guess the exciting part is over,</p>
<p>and this idea that one could actually,</p>
<p>or two people, or however many people were in Portland,</p>
<p>could oscillate this seesaw.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that you want to use pharmacology</p>
<p>to turn off the dopamine system,</p>
<p>but for people that have a hard time sleeping</p>
<p>and that are really in a state of agitation</p>
<p>and constantly obsessing, the psychiatrist,</p>
<p>one of the oldest and most effective treatments,</p>
<p>is that the psychiatrist,</p>
<p>and this does have to be prescribed,</p>
<p>will use a very, very low dose</p>
<p>of a dopamine receptor blocker like haloperidol,</p>
<p>which is used to treat schizophrenia,</p>
<p>very low dose to shut down the obsession component.</p>
<p>Smart, well-educated psychiatrists</p>
<p>know this as a useful tool,</p>
<p>but this is a one-time thing with a very low dose</p>
<p>because having your dopamine blocked sucks.</p>
<p>It does not feel good, but not being able to sleep</p>
<p>and being in an obsessive mode also sucks.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually a very potent clinical tool.</p>
<p>So pharmacology is one tool,</p>
<p>but really at the far end of things.</p>
<p>I believe that one should try</p>
<p>and modulate their own dopamine</p>
<p>by not rewarding oneself on a regular basis,</p>
<p>but only randomly.</p>
<p>Random intermittent reward</p>
<p>is truly the best schedule of reward,</p>
<p>hence slot machines and so on.</p>
<p>And you should engage random intermittent reward.</p>
<p>And I think this is also the way that we should train kids.</p>
<p>I call it training kids.</p>
<p>You can tell I don&rsquo;t have kids.</p>
<p>The, you don&rsquo;t reward them every time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe everyone should get a trophy every time,</p>
<p>nor should you always just reward the winners</p>
<p>because those winners often,</p>
<p>we see cases of this, high-profile cases of this,</p>
<p>they often crash and burn.</p>
<p>I mean, the number of high performers</p>
<p>that crash and burn publicly,</p>
<p>and Lord knows how many do it privately, is remarkable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because their dopamine system is all messed up.</p>
<p>So random intermittent reward is the schedule of reward</p>
<p>that we should impart on ourselves.</p>
<p>If you had 10 minutes a day to improve your brain plasticity,</p>
<p>what would you do and when would you do it?</p>
<p>Richard Conlon, thank you.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m gonna say again,</p>
<p>I would absolutely anchor my physiology</p>
<p>with morning sunlight viewing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s interesting?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you very briefly.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s special about morning sunlight,</p>
<p>this low-solar angle sunlight?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve talked about this much</p>
<p>on social media or on the podcast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a group at the University of Washington,</p>
<p>a couple, Jay and Maureen Knights,</p>
<p>they run a lab together.</p>
<p>That sounds like a horrible thing,</p>
<p>but they do it and they get along very well.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve discovered that the cells in your eye,</p>
<p>the neurons that set your circadian clock,</p>
<p>make you alert during the day</p>
<p>and make you sleepy at night and so on.</p>
<p>Those cells respond best to yellow-blue contrast</p>
<p>and orange tones.</p>
<p>Now, this is important</p>
<p>because when you go out in the morning,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not at sunrise, but it&rsquo;s close to sunrise,</p>
<p>or you look at the sun in the evening,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll see is yellow-blue contrast or orange,</p>
<p>yellow, blue, orange,</p>
<p>that old thing from kindergarten or first grade.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the color of light that you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>when the sun is overhead.</p>
<p>Now, this also is really interesting</p>
<p>because artificial lights, at least to my understanding,</p>
<p>even the daylight simulators have not picked up on this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just about bright light.</p>
<p>Someone ought to design something that can mimic this,</p>
<p>but nature has done this beautifully for us.</p>
<p>And so viewing low solar angle sunlight</p>
<p>in the morning and in the evening</p>
<p>is most effective because of those yellow-blue contrasts.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the really wild thing.</p>
<p>Those circuits that set your levels of alertness and sleep,</p>
<p>yes, they respond best to yellow-blue contrast,</p>
<p>but what that tells us is crazy.</p>
<p>What that means is that color vision</p>
<p>was probably not related to color perception first</p>
<p>because all of that is completely subconscious.</p>
<p>The pathways that do this are present in people</p>
<p>who are pattern vision blind.</p>
<p>So what do I mean?</p>
<p>I mean that color vision likely evolved</p>
<p>from a need to synchronize your internal state</p>
<p>with the external world,</p>
<p>and the best stimulus in the outside world to do that</p>
<p>is yellow-blue contrast.</p>
<p>In other words, our ability to detect color</p>
<p>was first and foremost,</p>
<p>and we understand this based on evolutionary genomics</p>
<p>and so forth, to extract time of day information,</p>
<p>not color of fruit or color of skin or anything like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all secondary, which is wild and crazy.</p>
<p>And this is yet another example</p>
<p>of the way we think things work is not the way they work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely 180 degrees opposite.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just gonna give you a little teaser.</p>
<p>I had a guest on the podcast.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t aired the episode yet.</p>
<p>His name is Eric Jarvis.</p>
<p>He works on speech and language.</p>
<p>He also was admitted into Alvin Ailey Dance Company.</p>
<p>Again, who are these people?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor at the Rockefeller.</p>
<p>Anyway, I learned from Eric,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll learn when that episode comes out</p>
<p>that you only find elaborate speech and language</p>
<p>in species that also engage in dance and song,</p>
<p>and the genomics point to the fact</p>
<p>that song and singing came first and language came second.</p>
<p>And that led me, during that episode of the podcast,</p>
<p>I wrote down in my notes, I was listening to him talk,</p>
<p>and I wrote down in my notebook.</p>
<p>It just scrawled in big letters.</p>
<p>It says, I am so happy right now.</p>
<p>I was just blown away.</p>
<p>And it makes so much sense when you hear it</p>
<p>that the colors in the sky were what we,</p>
<p>our system is trying to extract,</p>
<p>not a perception of those colors in the sky</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re informing us about time</p>
<p>and orienting us in time.</p>
<p>That song and the communication of emotional states</p>
<p>would be simpler and more foundational</p>
<p>in communication about specific patterns of language.</p>
<p>When you hear it, suddenly it makes sense.</p>
<p>But of course, we&rsquo;re human beings,</p>
<p>and unless you&rsquo;re Eric Jarvis or Ali Crum or Anna Lembke,</p>
<p>you think about all this stuff backwards, as I do.</p>
<p>How can I navigate my way through taking supplements</p>
<p>to optimize my health when my career demands</p>
<p>army infantry prevent me from being able</p>
<p>to establish consistent routines?</p>
<p>Andrew Yegan, well, thank you for doing what you do, Andrew.</p>
<p>So, the consistent routine thing is tough.</p>
<p>You know, here are the, here&rsquo;s what I can say</p>
<p>without going into a long two and a half hour episode</p>
<p>about jet lag and shift work, which we&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>The most powerful way to anchor your brain and body in time</p>
<p>is indeed viewing light, sunlight,</p>
<p>at consistent times of day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something I made up.</p>
<p>We know this based on a lot of work</p>
<p>that dates back to the 1930s.</p>
<p>The second most powerful stimulus is going to be movement</p>
<p>and changes in body temperature.</p>
<p>In particular, increases in body temperature</p>
<p>tend to make us alert, and decreases in body temperature</p>
<p>tend to make us sleepy.</p>
<p>Body temperature drops one to three degrees</p>
<p>to get us into sleep.</p>
<p>Why does a cold shower wake you up?</p>
<p>Adrenaline is released, and believe it or not,</p>
<p>your body is heating up internally to combat that cold,</p>
<p>unless you make yourself hypothermic.</p>
<p>So, sauna, hot baths to get sleepy,</p>
<p>cold showers, ice baths, et cetera, to wake up.</p>
<p>Sort of obvious when you hear it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s counterintuitive because you think,</p>
<p>oh, heating up the body to wake up</p>
<p>and cooling down the body to go to sleep,</p>
<p>so getting into cold ought to cool me down,</p>
<p>but your body compensates,</p>
<p>just like if you threw a cold towel on a thermostat,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d crank up the temperature in the room</p>
<p>and vice versa for heat.</p>
<p>Okay, so what do you do?</p>
<p>You want to try and use as many of these things,</p>
<p>light, temperature, exercise, food, when you eat,</p>
<p>is typically associated with waking.</p>
<p>Very few of us are capable of eating in our sleep.</p>
<p>And then the other one is social activity and rhythms.</p>
<p>Now, the discombobulated person is gonna be the person</p>
<p>that has not aligned to these things in a consistent way.</p>
<p>So while schedules vary,</p>
<p>and Andrew, I don&rsquo;t know your exact schedule,</p>
<p>what I can say is, if you suddenly go from daytime behavior</p>
<p>and sleeping at night to the so-called vampire shift,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called in the military,</p>
<p>and suddenly you&rsquo;re up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sleeping during the day,</p>
<p>then when you come off that shift,</p>
<p>what you want to do is try and combine</p>
<p>as many of those same things at one time.</p>
<p>So it would be get your sunlight,</p>
<p>so go jogging without your sunglasses,</p>
<p>drink your coffee, engage with other people</p>
<p>and communicate, eat a meal afterwards,</p>
<p>or as the case may be before,</p>
<p>try and bring as many of those things together</p>
<p>at the same time of day for a few days,</p>
<p>and pretty soon your system will map around that.</p>
<p>So the reason I encourage for those of us</p>
<p>that are not doing shift work</p>
<p>to try and be fairly consistent about sunlight viewing</p>
<p>is it sets in motion everything else that&rsquo;s correct,</p>
<p>but if in terms of timing of eating,</p>
<p>appetite will follow, when you&rsquo;re alert will follow,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start to learn your own rhythms.</p>
<p>When you can&rsquo;t control your schedule,</p>
<p>try and combine as many of those cues,</p>
<p>again, light, temperature, exercise, food,</p>
<p>social engagement into one period of time</p>
<p>and try and lock that into a more or less</p>
<p>a one or two hour period,</p>
<p>or plus or minus one or two hours</p>
<p>at a particular time of day for at least two or three days,</p>
<p>and your schedule, meaning your internal clocks</p>
<p>will lock to that.</p>
<p>How is social media changing our brains?</p>
<p>Thomas, well, you hear all the terrible ways</p>
<p>in which it&rsquo;s changing our brains,</p>
<p>and I think that, again, we go back to this thing</p>
<p>as is it the aperture that we&rsquo;re looking at?</p>
<p>So is it the format that we&rsquo;re engaging in things,</p>
<p>or is it the content?</p>
<p>Well, the way I like to think about the phone</p>
<p>is the way that we&rsquo;ve been engaging with the phone</p>
<p>and the laptop, for that matter,</p>
<p>in staring into the small visual aperture each day</p>
<p>is sort of like walking like this all day long, right?</p>
<p>We have this amazing ability to shuffle our feet</p>
<p>and take small steps or to take big strides,</p>
<p>to run, to move, I think that&rsquo;s the sagittal plane</p>
<p>for movement, I know it for the brain,</p>
<p>the PTs are vicious people online, by the way,</p>
<p>the PTs and nutrition people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to just not say anything about that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a PT and I&rsquo;m not a physical therapist,</p>
<p>and they do incredible work,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very spirited crowd,</p>
<p>and the nutrition thing is really weird how,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just incredible,</p>
<p>people are either throwing liver at you</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re throwing celery at you</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re fasting or they&rsquo;re not fasting, it&rsquo;s nuts.</p>
<p>In any case, the social media</p>
<p>and staring at a small visual aperture</p>
<p>is changing our brains,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s one way I know in which it&rsquo;s changing our brains</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll tell you how to fix it,</p>
<p>if you stare or look at something within two feet of you</p>
<p>for a certain number of hours each day,</p>
<p>your eyeball actually gets longer,</p>
<p>and the visual image then is focused</p>
<p>in front of your neural retina,</p>
<p>not onto your neural retina,</p>
<p>and you are becoming myopic, nearsighted,</p>
<p>and if you look at things in the distance enough,</p>
<p>guess what, your eyeball changes shape</p>
<p>and your lens will focus appropriately</p>
<p>the image onto your retina, take some work,</p>
<p>kids that look at things up close too much</p>
<p>and adults that look at things up close too much</p>
<p>become nearsighted,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a beautiful set of clinical trials now</p>
<p>where mainly in kids,</p>
<p>if kids get outside for two hours a day,</p>
<p>getting a lot of this UVB and blue light</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re told is so terrible for us,</p>
<p>but they get it from sunlight,</p>
<p>they actually can reverse myopia</p>
<p>or reduce the incidence of myopia,</p>
<p>maybe even glaucoma, although that&rsquo;s a big maybe,</p>
<p>so how much staring into a small visual aperture</p>
<p>is too much, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but what we do know is that we are literally</p>
<p>becoming myopic in terms of our vision</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re becoming myopic in terms of our cognition,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the whole business</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s actually contained in those tweets</p>
<p>and those social media feeds and those news stories,</p>
<p>which, frankly, I feel like you lose either way,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re in one political camp</p>
<p>or another political camp,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re upset about half of the information out there,</p>
<p>so I feel like it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not someone who knows how to talk about politics</p>
<p>without stumbling,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do well in social studies in this sort of thing,</p>
<p>it just never made sense to me,</p>
<p>it just felt like the prize goes to the person</p>
<p>who can shout the loudest</p>
<p>and the most coherently for a moment,</p>
<p>but I encourage, of course, people to be politically active</p>
<p>and I vote,</p>
<p>but the content is tricky to navigate</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t really speak to that,</p>
<p>except that it seems to be bothering everybody</p>
<p>on one side or the other or in the middle,</p>
<p>and the format is something that we really understand,</p>
<p>and again, I don&rsquo;t know of many people</p>
<p>that are talking about this narrow visual window format</p>
<p>and that sort of thing,</p>
<p>it came up more during the lockdowns</p>
<p>when we were all inside a lot</p>
<p>and not looking out at a distance,</p>
<p>the data say to really to try and get at least 10 minutes</p>
<p>of long distance viewing,</p>
<p>so longer than 10 feet away from us</p>
<p>for every 30 minutes of closeup viewing</p>
<p>and not a lot of us are doing that,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re walking to your car looking at your phone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re definitely losing an opportunity.</p>
<p>What new piece of neurological research</p>
<p>are you most excited about, Mateo Minotto?</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>I think the piece of neurological research that,</p>
<p>all right, the weird stuff,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this colleague at Stanford,</p>
<p>Tony Weiss-Corey,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really into taking,</p>
<p>literally taking proteins from young blood</p>
<p>and young spinal cord, cerebral spinal fluid</p>
<p>and putting it into older people and animals</p>
<p>and they get younger, that stuff&rsquo;s pretty wild.</p>
<p>The fecal transplant stuff is pretty wild, right?</p>
<p>You take the microbiome from one person</p>
<p>and as it sounds, you transplant it to somebody else</p>
<p>and they take on the physical characteristics of the donor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Until I talked to Mike,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some shouts for fecal transplant.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I have never read the method sections of those papers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually afraid to read the method sections.</p>
<p>You know, I would say this is not neurological,</p>
<p>but the work from Chris Gardner and Justin Sonnenberg,</p>
<p>also at Stanford,</p>
<p>it makes it sound like I just like Stanford,</p>
<p>Stanford&rsquo;s here,</p>
<p>but these are the people I&rsquo;m closest to and surrounded by.</p>
<p>There are excellent places everywhere, of course,</p>
<p>including OHSU, and I&rsquo;m not just saying that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m here, actually,</p>
<p>I have close colleagues here and friends here at OHSU.</p>
<p>Also amazing, although that tram thing freaks me out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I always just have all these ideas</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s gonna happen if that thing breaks.</p>
<p>But the,</p>
<p>the microbiome data are really interesting.</p>
<p>I never understood why getting your gut microbiome</p>
<p>was important,</p>
<p>and it turns out it&rsquo;s because your gut actually makes</p>
<p>many of the neurotransmitter precursors</p>
<p>that your brain uses.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>And I always thought it would be a complicated thing</p>
<p>to get your gut microbiome right,</p>
<p>but it turns out that it&rsquo;s fermented foods</p>
<p>that seem to have the biggest effect.</p>
<p>There was all this argument about fiber,</p>
<p>and yes, fiber is important.</p>
<p>And here I am getting nervous talking about nutrition,</p>
<p>because the people are gonna like come at me with fiber.</p>
<p>But the,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very clear from Justin and Chris&rsquo;s data</p>
<p>that people who are getting four servings a day</p>
<p>of these fermented foods,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s kimchi or sauerkraut or kombucha,</p>
<p>that stuff actually seems to encourage</p>
<p>a healthy gut microbiome,</p>
<p>and people feel better and their immune system works better.</p>
<p>And I like this because it actually,</p>
<p>it resolves an issue, which is that high dose probiotics,</p>
<p>these very expensive, need to be refrigerated things,</p>
<p>those actually can create brain fog and other issues.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re for real severe cases of dysbiosis.</p>
<p>So I always like an instance where one can look to foods</p>
<p>which are good, because I like to eat</p>
<p>in order to resolve these issues.</p>
<p>In terms of other neurologic issues,</p>
<p>I think that, frankly, I think the stuff on dopamine</p>
<p>is fundamentally important.</p>
<p>So much addiction, that&rsquo;s a severe case,</p>
<p>but also so much waxing and waning of motivation.</p>
<p>And once you understand the dopamine system,</p>
<p>and you say, what activities am I engaging in,</p>
<p>or pharmacology am I engaging in,</p>
<p>what am I doing to spike dopamine?</p>
<p>You start to go, oh, I get it.</p>
<p>The waves in this wave pool are too high,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t do this consistently.</p>
<p>And then you do the counterintuitive thing</p>
<p>of approaching things with a little less excitement,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re able to do them more consistently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, ah, and maybe with some luck,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll end up finishing this book</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been working on for four and a half years</p>
<p>as a consequence, because I can&rsquo;t seem to.</p>
<p>Thinking about the Wim Hof Method,</p>
<p>do you believe it?</p>
<p>How is it really working?</p>
<p>What process is happening in his brain?</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Madison Cameron, everyone here</p>
<p>is probably familiar with Wim Hof,</p>
<p>whose occupation on Wikipedia used to be daredevil.</p>
<p>That was cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, evil can evil, had it, and Wim had it.</p>
<p>I got a story about Wim, actually in 2016,</p>
<p>I heard about this guy, Wim Hof,</p>
<p>and I got ahold of him, actually his children,</p>
<p>and I had one vacation that year,</p>
<p>and I flew to Spain,</p>
<p>and I spent some time mountaineering with Wim,</p>
<p>which was absolutely terrifying.</p>
<p>I almost lost a leg, legitimately.</p>
<p>I tied in wrong on a bridge sling.</p>
<p>He told me it was good for me.</p>
<p>He told me to stare into the lizard&rsquo;s eyes,</p>
<p>and I stared into the lizard&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>I jumped backwards off this homemade bridge sling thing,</p>
<p>and I had the rope wrapped through my leg in it.</p>
<p>I came back with basically the tendon</p>
<p>on the back of my knee exposed,</p>
<p>and sitting next to me on the plane</p>
<p>was our vice dean of research at Stanford,</p>
<p>and I had to explain to him what I was doing and why.</p>
<p>It was very embarrassing.</p>
<p>What did we do on that trip?</p>
<p>Well, a couple of things</p>
<p>that will help me answer your question.</p>
<p>First of all, when I arrived,</p>
<p>I suffered terribly from jet lag,</p>
<p>but the moment I got there, Wim did not say hello.</p>
<p>He literally told me to get into the ice bath,</p>
<p>and I did 10 minutes in the ice bath,</p>
<p>not because I&rsquo;m tough,</p>
<p>but because he held me down in the ice bath.</p>
<p>He is indeed one of the strongest human beings.</p>
<p>He reminds me of the bus driver on The Simpsons,</p>
<p>or the janitor, excuse me.</p>
<p>No, Otto is the bus driver, right?</p>
<p>The janitor on The Simpsons, like, ooh, that guy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s Wim, incredibly physically strong guy.</p>
<p>What do I think&rsquo;s going on with Wim Hof stuff?</p>
<p>Well, Wim Hof, whether or not he understands it or not,</p>
<p>I always think he&rsquo;s sort of the Bob Dylan of breath work.</p>
<p>Like, everything he says</p>
<p>seems to have some intuitive sense,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>what in the world he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna come after me now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a good but complicated relationship,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just confess.</p>
<p>Maybe someday we&rsquo;ll resolve that.</p>
<p>No big scandal or story there,</p>
<p>just we communicate very differently.</p>
<p>Wim has a couple methods.</p>
<p>One is to deliberately hyperventilate.</p>
<p>This is also called tumor breathing.</p>
<p>My lab actually studies this.</p>
<p>We have a paper that I&rsquo;m happy to share with you</p>
<p>the results, although they&rsquo;re not published yet,</p>
<p>where people do deliberate cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>which as the name suggests,</p>
<p>you just breathe really deeply in</p>
<p>and really deeply out 25 times,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re Wim, you say in and out, in and out.</p>
<p>I just tell people, here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>You go, ah, ah, you do that 25 times,</p>
<p>and you heat up and you feel really agitated,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because of adrenaline.</p>
<p>If you throw yourself into an ice bath or a cold shower,</p>
<p>adrenaline.</p>
<p>If somebody upsets you or you get a triggering text,</p>
<p>adrenaline.</p>
<p>Adrenaline sounds like a terrible thing,</p>
<p>except when you deliberately induce it,</p>
<p>as my colleague David Spiegel says,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big difference between going into a state</p>
<p>and you controlling your entry into a state.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about the state you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about how you got there</p>
<p>and whether or not you had anything to do with it.</p>
<p>States of high adrenaline are very powerful.</p>
<p>When you self-induce adrenaline by cold shower,</p>
<p>cyclic hyperventilation, aka Wim Hof breathing,</p>
<p>or Tummo breathing,</p>
<p>you then have an opportunity</p>
<p>to create a very distinct mind-body relationship.</p>
<p>We all hear that interoception</p>
<p>and the mind-body relationship,</p>
<p>interoception, just your ability to sense your heartbeats</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on in your body, powerful, right?</p>
<p>Terrible how you feel sucks.</p>
<p>So interoception is wonderful,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re anxious,</p>
<p>it actually is more adaptive</p>
<p>to be able to maintain your thinking</p>
<p>and get yourself out of that anxious state.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trembling and your body&rsquo;s freaking out</p>
<p>and your cheeks are flushing</p>
<p>and your brain is following your bodily state,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody,</p>
<p>and sadly this happens a lot,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve experienced a lot of trauma,</p>
<p>or typically this is people that have been barred</p>
<p>with extreme criticism or physical abuse</p>
<p>or other kinds of abuse during development,</p>
<p>they actually can seem very calm,</p>
<p>but internally they&rsquo;re freaking out in their head</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just thinking, just get me through this,</p>
<p>and they just go into a state</p>
<p>where no one knows they&rsquo;re upset.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known people like this,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s eerie to me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve never had that response to stress,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very common.</p>
<p>And so we should learn and be careful</p>
<p>about deciding that people are in one state or another</p>
<p>based on their bodily or their mental response.</p>
<p>Vimhoff breathing, cold showers, et cetera,</p>
<p>are a great practice in my opinion,</p>
<p>because they allow you to spike your adrenaline,</p>
<p>and you can do that, for instance,</p>
<p>by making the water colder if you want more adrenaline,</p>
<p>staying in longer if you want more adrenaline,</p>
<p>moving your limbs around in the water</p>
<p>will give you more adrenaline</p>
<p>because it breaks up that thermal layer,</p>
<p>it makes it a lot colder,</p>
<p>or doing 50 deep inhales and exhales.</p>
<p>That is very useful because then you have the opportunity</p>
<p>to use that prefrontal cortex and to stop</p>
<p>and sense all that adrenaline in your body</p>
<p>and yet maintain clarity of mind.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an absolutely powerful tool.</p>
<p>I would even call it a power tool.</p>
<p>And Vim figured this out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know this,</p>
<p>but the way that Vim discovered all this</p>
<p>was he was in deep grief about the tragic death of his wife.</p>
<p>She committed suicide, jumped off an eight-story building,</p>
<p>just truly tragic death.</p>
<p>And he was in situation,</p>
<p>he had four children at the time, now he has five.</p>
<p>And he was in a state of depression</p>
<p>and he ended up going into the canal in Amsterdam</p>
<p>and it was very cold and it shocked his system.</p>
<p>And in that shock to his system,</p>
<p>which is caused by adrenaline,</p>
<p>he somehow was able to anchor his thinking</p>
<p>and in a kind of genius of sorts,</p>
<p>Vim thought, wow, I can intervene in my physiology</p>
<p>with this strange activity.</p>
<p>And then he realized that breathing would do it as well.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have to get into cold water.</p>
<p>And then years later, we discovered,</p>
<p>not we meaning my lab, but other labs,</p>
<p>that when you get into cold water,</p>
<p>even just 60 degree water,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a very long lasting increase in dopamine</p>
<p>that is 2.5X above baseline,</p>
<p>which is on par with some prescription drugs</p>
<p>for increasing dopamine.</p>
<p>So when people laugh at me, oh, this cold water thing,</p>
<p>I get teased a lot on the internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard on the internet that I eat sticks of butter,</p>
<p>which I never said.</p>
<p>I said, I like, I said, I like butter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told, I&rsquo;ve been told all sorts of things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told I eat sticks of butter.</p>
<p>I was like, I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that I&rsquo;m dead.</p>
<p>That was an interesting one.</p>
<p>That was one of the cooler ones.</p>
<p>But you know, when I was going out there</p>
<p>as a serious scientist and saying, you know,</p>
<p>using deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>you can use all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Or, you know, if you come to my lab,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to put you in VR</p>
<p>and expose you to all sorts of scary stuff</p>
<p>where we can inject you with adrenaline</p>
<p>or you can inject yourself with adrenaline</p>
<p>and titrate that, adjust the levels of that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very powerful tool.</p>
<p>And I think that Wim and others deserve credit</p>
<p>for really tapping into that.</p>
<p>And as a last point, there&rsquo;s a beautiful study</p>
<p>in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>years ago using this deliberate cyclic hyperventilation</p>
<p>thing, 25 breaths, and then another group meditates,</p>
<p>and then they inject them both with E. coli.</p>
<p>And the people injected with E. coli who meditate</p>
<p>get nauseous, vomit, diarrhea, and they get a fever.</p>
<p>And the people who, first, far fewer symptoms, if any.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because adrenaline actually suppresses</p>
<p>a lot of these innate immune responses</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s healthy in the short term.</p>
<p>This is why you can work, work, work, work, work,</p>
<p>or you can study for finals,</p>
<p>you can take care of a loved one,</p>
<p>and then you finally stop and rest and go on vacation,</p>
<p>and then you get sick.</p>
<p>Stress activates your nervous system,</p>
<p>and in doing so, it activates your immune system.</p>
<p>Makes perfect sense when you think about it.</p>
<p>How would we ever go through famine</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just getting flus whenever you&rsquo;re stressed?</p>
<p>We can deal with a lot.</p>
<p>My suggestion is if you&rsquo;re coming off a period</p>
<p>of high stress, to do some sort of adrenaline</p>
<p>spiking behavior as you taper out of that stressful period,</p>
<p>not going strictly to massage vacation</p>
<p>and yoga nidra all day long, as I would reflexively do.</p>
<p>Can red light therapy help treat exercise intolerance</p>
<p>and fatigue and mitochondrial disease?</p>
<p>Allison, I&rsquo;m glad you brought this up.</p>
<p>This is another case where I thought,</p>
<p>oh no, this red light stuff is crazy.</p>
<p>And then I went into the literature,</p>
<p>and it turns out that in 1908,</p>
<p>the Nobel Prize was actually given for phototherapy.</p>
<p>So there we go again, and here,</p>
<p>I have this slide, I chose not to use slides tonight,</p>
<p>but I have this slide that shows Ken Kesey</p>
<p>and the magic bus and stuff from the 1930s</p>
<p>and psychedelics and people getting into cold water.</p>
<p>And then here we are, 2019, 2020,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got Wim Hof and Matt Johnson</p>
<p>giving people macro doses of psilocybin.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re right back where we were.</p>
<p>And one of my major goals is to really try</p>
<p>and create some scientific discussion around these things.</p>
<p>This stuff is crazy on the face of it,</p>
<p>but there are mechanisms that are real that underlie it.</p>
<p>Red light, because it&rsquo;s long wavelength light,</p>
<p>longer literally as opposed to short wavelength light,</p>
<p>can penetrate through things like skin</p>
<p>and can indeed change mitochondria.</p>
<p>One of the more impressive results on red light</p>
<p>comes from my good friend Glenn Jeffries&rsquo; lab</p>
<p>at the University of College London.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known Glenn for years.</p>
<p>In a few years, he was a basic vision scientist,</p>
<p>and a few years ago, he started using red light.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d have people look at red light</p>
<p>at a distance of about two feet in the morning.</p>
<p>This is long wavelength light,</p>
<p>and sometimes even just take a flashlight,</p>
<p>a torch as they call it in England,</p>
<p>and cover it with a red film,</p>
<p>and they would look at this stuff</p>
<p>for a few minutes each morning,</p>
<p>and it can reverse some forms of age-related vision loss</p>
<p>and macular degeneration,</p>
<p>how we now know it can improve mitochondrial function</p>
<p>in photoreceptors by reducing</p>
<p>what are called reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It only seems to work in people older than 40,</p>
<p>and it seems to only work if you do it</p>
<p>within the first three hours of waking,</p>
<p>and the incredible thing is you can do this</p>
<p>for one or two minutes a week,</p>
<p>and some of the positive effects</p>
<p>last as long as three weeks,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s affecting a very specific form</p>
<p>of visual improvement, which is acuity,</p>
<p>kind of fine detail stuff in my particular wavelength,</p>
<p>so particular colors and objects and things.</p>
<p>Pretty impressive, so yes,</p>
<p>red light can improve mitochondrial function</p>
<p>to the photoreceptors.</p>
<p>If you are gonna try and do this stuff,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put it too close.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any affiliation</p>
<p>with any red light panel company,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t say anything there.</p>
<p>They are rather expensive.</p>
<p>Nowadays, people are putting red light everywhere,</p>
<p>and I do mean everywhere.</p>
<p>People are putting red light on their stomach</p>
<p>for improving ovarian function.</p>
<p>Whether or not it can penetrate isn&rsquo;t clear to me.</p>
<p>All the way down there, people are trying to do this.</p>
<p>I have a friend, I won&rsquo;t name him.</p>
<p>Recently, he told me he&rsquo;s really into the red light therapy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s putting it on his testicles</p>
<p>to try and increase testosterone,</p>
<p>but he told me that after he handed me the red light.</p>
<p>True story.</p>
<p>My team knows who this is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no one on my team, thank goodness.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think you wanna contact</p>
<p>the red lights directly to your skin.</p>
<p>So red light is powerful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have, aside from the vision protocol,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s clear which protocols are best.</p>
<p>I will say, if you&rsquo;re into red light infrared sauna,</p>
<p>typically, those don&rsquo;t get hot enough.</p>
<p>Typically, if you wanna get the benefits of sauna,</p>
<p>you wanna get between 80 and 100 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>which is 176 to 210 or 208 Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t actually do the conversion in my head.</p>
<p>I memorize it.</p>
<p>You mentioned the consequences of blasting your brain</p>
<p>with too much dopamine.</p>
<p>Is it possible to overdo ice baths</p>
<p>while following the same line of thinking?</p>
<p>Will you experience extreme low in dopamine</p>
<p>with too many ice baths?</p>
<p>Thank you for the question.</p>
<p>Any behavior that spikes adrenaline,</p>
<p>you will eventually get better at tolerating it.</p>
<p>You will become cold adapted,</p>
<p>and you will become comfortable at high adrenaline states.</p>
<p>And you just have to ask yourself this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like lifting weights in the gym or running.</p>
<p>You need to leave some space for improvement.</p>
<p>So if you run, as people do, and you do your half marathon,</p>
<p>your 5K, then your 10K, then your half marathon,</p>
<p>maybe a 10K is a half marathon, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But anyway, then you&rsquo;re doing your marathon,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re doing ultras that are 50 miles and 100 miles.</p>
<p>I mean, eventually, you&rsquo;re gonna start doing damage.</p>
<p>And eventually, you look at every ultra runner,</p>
<p>and typically, these are people</p>
<p>who are very much on the dopamine pursuit system.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think that he would mind.</p>
<p>My good friend and a podcaster</p>
<p>who I have tremendous respect for, a rich role,</p>
<p>amazing human being,</p>
<p>and also has an amazing story about addiction.</p>
<p>He was an alcoholic, and I&rsquo;m not sharing anything</p>
<p>that he hasn&rsquo;t already shared</p>
<p>in this amazing book, Finding Ultra.</p>
<p>He got really into running, running, running all the time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a dopamine history there for him.</p>
<p>Some of us can use ice baths so consistently</p>
<p>and make it so cold and doing them longer and longer</p>
<p>that indeed, you&rsquo;re playing with the dopamine system.</p>
<p>Is it bad?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on what you&rsquo;re trading that in for.</p>
<p>At the expense of what?</p>
<p>Is it giving up cocaine?</p>
<p>Yeah, great, stick with the ice bath.</p>
<p>But you can only make it so cold,</p>
<p>and you can only stay in there so long</p>
<p>before you become Wim Hof, right?</p>
<p>And it worked out for Wim,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s really only one Wim Hof.</p>
<p>And in general, that speaks to a larger theme,</p>
<p>which is I love the idea of people using tools</p>
<p>and understanding mechanism.</p>
<p>I mean, of course I love that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I talk about and think about so much of my life.</p>
<p>But for most of us,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t make a living doing those things.</p>
<p>And so I do think that the ideal situation</p>
<p>is to have behaviors and tools that you intersperse</p>
<p>throughout your day and throughout the week.</p>
<p>For instance, I think three times a week</p>
<p>is fine for the ice bath.</p>
<p>No one said you had to do it every day,</p>
<p>but you should see sunlight every morning if you can.</p>
<p>Just because if you miss a day,</p>
<p>your system will be fine.</p>
<p>Just spend twice as long outside the next day, seriously,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a slow integrating system.</p>
<p>But for most of these high intensity things,</p>
<p>the less often you do them, the more powerful they are.</p>
<p>In fact, if you get into a very hot sauna</p>
<p>for four, excuse me, 30 minute sessions on one day.</p>
<p>So you go 30 minutes, get out for five minutes.</p>
<p>30 minutes, get out for five minutes.</p>
<p>Two hours a day in the sauna, that&rsquo;s a lot of sauna.</p>
<p>But the growth hormone released from that type of protocol</p>
<p>is a 16X increase in growth hormone.</p>
<p>This has been measured in humans.</p>
<p>Whereas if you do it every day</p>
<p>or three or four times a week,</p>
<p>you get diminishing returns on that.</p>
<p>So I actually am a big fan of doing really intense stuff</p>
<p>only every once in a while.</p>
<p>This is also why I only take one long run per week</p>
<p>or one long hike.</p>
<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t have time for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an ultra runner.</p>
<p>I got other things to do.</p>
<p>And second of all, it&rsquo;s a strong stimulus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sore until Tuesday</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t wanna run until Tuesday anyway.</p>
<p>I actually think that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And I actually encourage</p>
<p>kind of more healthy rational schedules</p>
<p>of these kinds of behaviors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no rule that says you have to do something every day</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re trying to engage neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>You can learn French or an instrument</p>
<p>by practicing three times a week</p>
<p>as long as your practice is very focused, right?</p>
<p>Daily perhaps would be better,</p>
<p>but very few of us have the opportunity</p>
<p>to do things every day consistently.</p>
<p>And I really wanna encourage a more balanced approach.</p>
<p>Before working through Thasher, what&rsquo;s the base?</p>
<p>Oh, goodness gracious.</p>
<p>The skateboarders are always in the house.</p>
<p>My first non-biological family</p>
<p>was a skateboarding community</p>
<p>when I have great relationship with my parents now.</p>
<p>But because there was a time</p>
<p>when there was no one to go to soccer games</p>
<p>or do any of that stuff,</p>
<p>the skateboard community took me in</p>
<p>because there were no parents involved.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>There were no referees or coaches</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t like authority.</p>
<p>And it was awesome.</p>
<p>And there was no nutritional plan.</p>
<p>You drank your Slurpee and you sat on the curb</p>
<p>and it was fantastic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do that anymore.</p>
<p>But the skateboarding community</p>
<p>is one that I&rsquo;ve remained close with.</p>
<p>I did write for Thrasher under a different name</p>
<p>while I was a postdoc to make some extra cash.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t find those articles anywhere, I hope.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not very good.</p>
<p>And Best Skate Shirt,</p>
<p>well, I was involved in it enough</p>
<p>that this only makes sense to three people in the audience,</p>
<p>but I had decent heel flip.</p>
<p>I could nollie better than I could ollie.</p>
<p>And I was never very good.</p>
<p>And I just, oh, there are more skateboarders in the audience.</p>
<p>What I will say, though,</p>
<p>is you have to be very careful with skateboarders</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to claim that I was any good.</p>
<p>Any success that I had was out of sympathy of others</p>
<p>for letting me hang around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great community.</p>
<p>And it gave me great appreciation</p>
<p>for indeed communities of kids</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have structure and sports leagues and teams</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it&rsquo;s actually a much different landscape.</p>
<p>And I have to also say what it&rsquo;s really amazing</p>
<p>to see all the incredible girls and women skateboarders.</p>
<p>Also, there were none.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Olympic sport now for women and girls,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s Olympic sport for boys and men too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s awesome to see that community.</p>
<p>Okay, what are your favorite brain hacks</p>
<p>for doing hard things,</p>
<p>ranging from cold exposure to getting through selection?</p>
<p>Hobie Darling, thanks for the question.</p>
<p>Yeah, hard things.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll be honest.</p>
<p>I learned how to hack into my adrenaline system</p>
<p>a long time ago through the worst possible mechanism,</p>
<p>which is that I would set up battles in my mind.</p>
<p>I would get into competition with people imagined or real,</p>
<p>or I would get into states of fearing, shame,</p>
<p>and screwing up.</p>
<p>So this is what a lot of people do, I think.</p>
<p>You end up scaring yourself</p>
<p>into trying to do the hard thing, and it works.</p>
<p>The problem is it feels rather like a downward spiral</p>
<p>because those negative states of mind</p>
<p>work to liberate adrenaline</p>
<p>and get you in through hard things.</p>
<p>So being as a kind of rebellious kid,</p>
<p>resistance was if someone told me I couldn&rsquo;t do something,</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, try me, this kind of thing.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I wasn&rsquo;t crazy about authority.</p>
<p>And so that was the method for a long time.</p>
<p>And then I started reading Oliver Sacks&rsquo;s books,</p>
<p>and I started learning from people</p>
<p>who seemed to access things through this whole love thing.</p>
<p>And I tried that love and kindness meditation thing,</p>
<p>and that didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And what I started doing was I actually,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you, before I came out here tonight</p>
<p>and before I do anything challenging,</p>
<p>I just actually like to imagine</p>
<p>the people that have supported me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird tool.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever shared it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually slightly embarrassed to share this out</p>
<p>because there are only two things that make me cry,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s talking about my bulldog</p>
<p>and talking about my graduate advisor.</p>
<p>And if I talk about it any longer, I&rsquo;ll probably cry.</p>
<p>But I think about them a lot</p>
<p>because they were kind of similar.</p>
<p>They were kind of ornery, and they were hard on me,</p>
<p>and I adored them both.</p>
<p>And so these days I try and think about people</p>
<p>that really, that I love.</p>
<p>And so I have been trying to do this whole</p>
<p>like doing things from a place of love thing.</p>
<p>And so for me, that&rsquo;s animals and people that I love.</p>
<p>Okay, now I am better to move on.</p>
<p>So, oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, they&rsquo;re telling me one more question,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to answer one more.</p>
<p>What do I fear?</p>
<p>How do you manage your fear, KB?</p>
<p>Oh, gosh, this is gonna turn into a,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s gonna be satisfied until I cry.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I do cry, but again, about the things I mentioned before.</p>
<p>I realized something, by the way.</p>
<p>We just recorded an episode on grief.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t come out yet.</p>
<p>Fascinating topic.</p>
<p>I realized at one point, by the way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give this away,</p>
<p>that I thought I was really sad about losing them.</p>
<p>I thought I would tear up really easily</p>
<p>because I was sad about them.</p>
<p>But then I realized, gosh,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m gonna do this.</p>
<p>But I realized that feeling that I was feeling</p>
<p>is the exact same feeling of love</p>
<p>that I had when they were alive.</p>
<p>So grief is love, and when you look at the literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically that, but your brain is freaking out</p>
<p>because that map of knowing</p>
<p>where people are in space and time,</p>
<p>grief is basically a remapping of the space,</p>
<p>where are they, time, when are they,</p>
<p>and then this kind of abstract map representation</p>
<p>that we call closeness.</p>
<p>And grief is this process</p>
<p>of ripping ourselves off of that.</p>
<p>So in any event, what do I fear</p>
<p>talking about things like this?</p>
<p>What do I fear?</p>
<p>Quite honestly, my biggest fear,</p>
<p>the thing that would just make me feel just horrible</p>
<p>is I fear letting down my friends.</p>
<p>I have an amazing, I love my family and they&rsquo;re wonderful,</p>
<p>but I have this incredible relationship to friendship.</p>
<p>And I just, I adore my friends</p>
<p>and I would sooner give up all my limbs</p>
<p>and die before I would deliberately let them down.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I fear most.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I also fear I&rsquo;ve gone long</p>
<p>and so my team has shut this down.</p>
<p>I just wanna just briefly, two things.</p>
<p>First of all, I of course wanna thank everyone</p>
<p>for coming here tonight.</p>
<p>I realize it&rsquo;s the middle of the week</p>
<p>and to commit some hours of your life</p>
<p>to thinking about these brain mechanisms,</p>
<p>but we got pretty nerdy there for a minute.</p>
<p>And hopefully the tools redeemed those</p>
<p>who were only interested</p>
<p>or mostly interested in practical tools,</p>
<p>but hopefully some of the insights</p>
<p>about how you work were useful as well.</p>
<p>I do wanna just make brief mention</p>
<p>of the sponsors that made this possible</p>
<p>because they did make this possible.</p>
<p>And we made every effort to try</p>
<p>and keep the ticket prices manageable for people.</p>
<p>And thanks to InsideTracker and Momentus</p>
<p>for making this possible.</p>
<p>And then of course I would be completely remiss</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t say thank you for your interest in science.</p>
<p>Wooo!</p>
<p>Wooo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>Everyone be sure to get home safely tonight.</p>
