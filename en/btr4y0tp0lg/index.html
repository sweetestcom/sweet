<p>like you have to wait till next year so</p>
<p>definitely check it out so yeah let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk so lately a lot of things</p>
<p>going in the news I you know I always</p>
<p>check in to see what video that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>releasing and things and you know</p>
<p>because we actually are kind of a same</p>
<p>same wavelength for sure and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole bunch of data on eggs you know and</p>
<p>cholesterol and so do you have you have</p>
<p>anything interesting to comment on this</p>
<p>egg thing yeah I just put it you know I</p>
<p>know you put a video up like a month or</p>
<p>so ago when this first came out and and</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s kind of beating a</p>
<p>dead horse a little bit with this whole</p>
<p>anything but it&rsquo;s I think one thing that</p>
<p>just really needs to be out there is</p>
<p>people understanding that it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>cholesterol it&rsquo;s the inflammation that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what we have to look at and you can pick</p>
<p>apart they can pick apart any food they</p>
<p>want to like I could I could find a</p>
<p>problem with broccoli I could find a</p>
<p>problem with cabbage I mean you can find</p>
<p>a problem with any food and when it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cohort study like that when things don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look at the big picture it&rsquo;s very easy</p>
<p>to just extract what you want to extract</p>
<p>out of a study and having been involved</p>
<p>in clinical studies before and seeing</p>
<p>them it&rsquo;s the unfortunate thing as dr.</p>
<p>Barragan you know this and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unfortunately it breaks it breaks down a</p>
<p>lot of people is know</p>
<p>that clinical studies aren&rsquo;t always the</p>
<p>gospel I told it great it&rsquo;s about a</p>
<p>corruption I mean you know like I just</p>
<p>did a video on this recently apparently</p>
<p>and I there&rsquo;s a rule that was passed I</p>
<p>think in 2005 that faith I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they follow this but you have to be</p>
<p>transparent you have to upload all the</p>
<p>studies that you actually do including</p>
<p>the ones that don&rsquo;t turn out that well</p>
<p>do the ones that have complications but</p>
<p>into I guess it&rsquo;s a clinical studies</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t quote me but the point is that</p>
<p>before 2005 they can trick what studies</p>
<p>they want to put up and so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting this altered so-called facts and</p>
<p>I mean one thing they can do they can</p>
<p>actually filter out the first six weeks</p>
<p>data so you know you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always go by these studies I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>insane well in the first sometime I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve heard that before you can</p>
<p>filter out the first six to eight weeks</p>
<p>and the fact is the first six weeks</p>
<p>sometimes that&rsquo;s for both positive and</p>
<p>negative that&rsquo;s a really important</p>
<p>period of time like people have radical</p>
<p>ships in so many different important</p>
<p>markers in those first six weeks and a</p>
<p>lot can happen in six weeks a lot of</p>
<p>good and bad and you know of course the</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s gonna come back to whatever</p>
<p>homeostasis is theirs but the whole</p>
<p>purpose of them kind of being able to</p>
<p>take away that first six weeks at first</p>
<p>I thought it was put in place out of</p>
<p>good good faith I thought maybe okay</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re trying to get rid of the</p>
<p>impulse response that happens with the</p>
<p>body sometimes you know massive</p>
<p>course-correction</p>
<p>I mean someone goes on keto they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have massive potentially</p>
<p>reductions in inflammation within the</p>
<p>first few weeks just because it&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>shock to their system in their bodies</p>
<p>coming into a whole new world and then</p>
<p>it can kind of balance out sometimes but</p>
<p>most of the time how quickly someone</p>
<p>adapts to something is a very good</p>
<p>indicator of how their lifestyle was</p>
<p>before so I think it&rsquo;s very good</p>
<p>information that should be included in</p>
<p>the study and also rounds out what the</p>
<p>ultimate conclusion is of that study and</p>
<p>what do you do with studies that are ten</p>
<p>weeks long that means you only have four</p>
<p>four weeks of aggregate data right yeah</p>
<p>I mean even one of the things that they</p>
<p>they have listed it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>non-compliance and so if you look at</p>
<p>what they mean by non-compliance it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost like side effects so you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>gonna eliminate all the side effects</p>
<p>okay so and I don&rsquo;t know how much of the</p>
<p>how much of this is like diet related I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a mainly talking about more</p>
<p>of the drug studies that they do yeah</p>
<p>which you I think you you were in that</p>
<p>field for a while so yeah it was yeah</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a really gnarly world</p>
<p>so I was in the lab services world so</p>
<p>you know we were kind of some of the</p>
<p>first that we&rsquo;re doing like the old zrt</p>
<p>cortisol salivary testing and stuff like</p>
<p>that way back in the day when it was</p>
<p>just concierge doctors doing it so it</p>
<p>was interesting seeing as we were in</p>
<p>direct competition with the</p>
<p>organizations that were just trying to</p>
<p>go for a maximum reimbursement you know</p>
<p>so we were working with like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>familiar with concierge medicine</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s very similar to</p>
<p>chiropractic and stuff that&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>medical side so it&rsquo;s just where&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doctors that were generally working with</p>
<p>patients on a fee-for-service basis not</p>
<p>based on insurance reimbursable so that</p>
<p>being said a lot of the doctors that I</p>
<p>was working with we&rsquo;re very invested in</p>
<p>keeping their patients happy and doing</p>
<p>the right thing because if they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>getting good patient outcomes they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t getting paid because it was the</p>
<p>affluent patients that were paying them</p>
<p>directly whereas we were working you</p>
<p>know the other side of the equation or</p>
<p>the doctors that we&rsquo;re just going for</p>
<p>the jugular with whatever they could a</p>
<p>maximum reimbursement so then you have</p>
<p>doctors that will lobby for specific</p>
<p>drugs depending on what the</p>
<p>reimbursements going to be on it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like oh my gosh it really is saying yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying you know one one really</p>
<p>touchy subject today I haven&rsquo;t done a</p>
<p>lot of videos not and I probably won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>for various reasons but and I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to get too into it but vaccinations you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s the only thing I want to say</p>
<p>about it is and I&rsquo;ll shut up but you</p>
<p>have to say oh yeah it&rsquo;s safe but over</p>
<p>four billion dollars we&rsquo;re spent on the</p>
<p>vaccine courts yeah see you a vaccine</p>
<p>court like wait a second now if you earn</p>
<p>on a slight drug they don&rsquo;t have a side</p>
<p>truck or it&rsquo;s like but you have a</p>
<p>vaccine court</p>
<p>and apparently they don&rsquo;t even have</p>
<p>judges they have like health and</p>
<p>services employees I&rsquo;m like what and</p>
<p>then so you have this situation where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like interesting interesting data</p>
<p>in a year yeah you know so I think as as</p>
<p>time goes on more and more things will</p>
<p>pop up on that but I do know that</p>
<p>certain friends of mine that had have</p>
<p>quite large</p>
<p>YouTube channels they had some of their</p>
<p>social media taken away because they</p>
<p>talked a little too much about that so</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just an area that I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>probably stay away from right now but</p>
<p>you know people always ask me and I just</p>
<p>like well you do the research you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s looking just look into what why</p>
<p>they have the backs of vaccination</p>
<p>courts and then also how much is paid</p>
<p>out and then of course we have to do</p>
<p>companies don&rsquo;t pay that we have to pay</p>
<p>a tax payers pay that I&rsquo;m like what the</p>
<p>heck is up with that so yeah you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you have studies you have the data</p>
<p>but I think you need to personally</p>
<p>experience some of these these things</p>
<p>yourself to see if it works for you and</p>
<p>then you really know agreed agreed and</p>
<p>and you know back to the original topic</p>
<p>at hand which was the egg study where it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t even called the egg study I mean</p>
<p>am i calling it the egg study I was like</p>
<p>the eggs are just like this</p>
<p>cherry-picked portion of it the fact was</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve touched on and I&rsquo;ve touched on</p>
<p>it they asked these patients once if</p>
<p>they consume dicks you know and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like asking it&rsquo;s going up to a 16 year</p>
<p>old asking if they consume a Snickers</p>
<p>bar and I was like if they said no</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be lying but if they said yes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna assume that you did every</p>
<p>day that&rsquo;s not very fair I mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of backing someone into a corner so</p>
<p>you can at the very and I have a video</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t gone live yet talking about</p>
<p>the skipping breakfast study there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another study that came out that said</p>
<p>skipping breakfast is correlated with</p>
<p>increased risk of CVD and all this - and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s if you haven&rsquo;t if you haven&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>the whole thing else and did a link but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just and and the way that I</p>
<p>even opened my video on that I was</p>
<p>talking about okay</p>
<p>like literally by saying like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting someone into a corner just by</p>
<p>how you frame the question so for</p>
<p>example dr. Burke if I say dr. Burke do</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>yep breakfast the word skip and its very</p>
<p>nature is implying that if by skipping</p>
<p>breakfast you&rsquo;re doing something wrong</p>
<p>whereas if I always say dr. Burton</p>
<p>do you eat breakfast or not right</p>
<p>different questions so right yes by how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s phrased in the study itself even in</p>
<p>the abstract skip skip breakfast so you</p>
<p>can tell that they&rsquo;re there they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting people on edge so if someone</p>
<p>comes to me and says you skip do you</p>
<p>skip breakfast and I&rsquo;m you know someone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s intimidating because I&rsquo;m in a</p>
<p>clinical setting and I&rsquo;m not familiar</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t know how to navigate the world</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying like of course someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna put me in a corner I&rsquo;m gonna say</p>
<p>no I don&rsquo;t skip breakfast like now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not supposed to breakfast on skipper how</p>
<p>do you neglect your breakfast no yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just crazy so you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the questionnaire studies the</p>
<p>video yeah yeah it&rsquo;s so I mean and those</p>
<p>having those have a valid place but we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take questionnaire studies and</p>
<p>really try to extrapolate like concrete</p>
<p>clinical evidence that&rsquo;s gonna dictate</p>
<p>what we eat and don&rsquo;t eat didn&rsquo;t I mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s just not there and all the</p>
<p>study said and the other thing we had to</p>
<p>look at is the skipping breakfast study</p>
<p>what they don&rsquo;t mention in the primary</p>
<p>ports in this study that you have to dig</p>
<p>deeper and those that skipped breakfast</p>
<p>also happen to be generally smokers</p>
<p>drinkers and chronic drinkers and those</p>
<p>that had other unhealthy lifestyle</p>
<p>habits so it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s not to say</p>
<p>everyone that&rsquo;s gets breakfast does but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big big difference between</p>
<p>consciously skipping breakfast because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fast named or you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>around with time restrictive eating and</p>
<p>just forgetting breakfast because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not paying attention to what you eat or</p>
<p>what you don&rsquo;t eat you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of people that get up in the morning</p>
<p>and then just like breakfast isn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>a thought because they&rsquo;re just stressed</p>
<p>out and they&rsquo;re going through their day</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s no fault of their</p>
<p>own but they&rsquo;re just they&rsquo;re just going</p>
<p>through life and they&rsquo;re not thinking</p>
<p>about it then there&rsquo;s the people that</p>
<p>have maybe watched our videos and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen this and they&rsquo;re like oh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>consciously going to skip breakfast and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make sure that I get my greens</p>
<p>and make sure I get my nutrients within</p>
<p>my respective eating window big</p>
<p>difference between skipping breakfast</p>
<p>and that absolutely absolutely yeah so</p>
<p>you um</p>
<p>you have a small boy right I mean Siwon</p>
<p>years older hose it he&rsquo;s 18 months now</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going west just now how do I slow</p>
<p>him down you know if I had the answers</p>
<p>that I would probably be sitting here</p>
<p>right now now so we have a little little</p>
<p>baby in the house</p>
<p>five months Lucy so so we&rsquo;re similar</p>
<p>with my granddaughter and so she we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing cod liver oil every morning just a</p>
<p>little bit and of course breastfed and</p>
<p>talk about like robust cheeks and just</p>
<p>spot and like the tea I mean teeth are</p>
<p>coming in now but everything&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>coming out perfect so what what do you</p>
<p>what did you guys do with your child did</p>
<p>you did your wife breastfeed and yeah so</p>
<p>he was so my wife was kedo when we got</p>
<p>pregnant she went through a period</p>
<p>during her pregnancy she went through a</p>
<p>period of time where she she thought it</p>
<p>was wise to bring in some low glycemic</p>
<p>carbohydrates just to introduce a limit</p>
<p>of everything and then the third</p>
<p>trimester she went back strict keto baby</p>
<p>was born healthy and very big my wife is</p>
<p>not a large woman she&rsquo;s 5 to 5 3 about</p>
<p>115 pounds and the baby was over nine</p>
<p>pounds so here&rsquo;s the big boy</p>
<p>and it was like okay how did this happen</p>
<p>so then yes I mean the funny thing is</p>
<p>you said cod liver oil so cod liver oil</p>
<p>is we give it to him in the evening so I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t asked you select digression is</p>
<p>there a reason that you give in cod</p>
<p>liver oil or her cod liver oil in the</p>
<p>morning or evening or is it just the</p>
<p>best time oh not any specific time in</p>
<p>the evening you know she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>you know breastfeeding probably several</p>
<p>times a day yeah but she just that baby</p>
<p>is hungry so we gotta like so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing the egg yolk cooked of course just</p>
<p>egg yolk and then with a common one that</p>
<p>seems to I mean Lucy just sucks it up</p>
<p>just you know yeah he likes it</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s learning how to swim just really</p>
<p>happy baby no problems no health issues</p>
<p>you know I I always get I&rsquo;m sure you</p>
<p>probably get questions about kids too</p>
<p>with you know what do I do for this</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re always sick you know we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t have in that situation</p>
<p>yeah Tommy in the 18 months you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been sick</p>
<p>Mary got sick</p>
<p>really bad over his first birthday and I</p>
<p>think it was just because his immune</p>
<p>system was crushed because he had four</p>
<p>molars coming in at one time where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry canine and three more or so he had</p>
<p>one coming in and the other one was</p>
<p>coming in later and I think it just</p>
<p>crushed his immune system that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little sinuses where he&rsquo;s is all</p>
<p>inflamed but you know he&rsquo;s just had</p>
<p>other than that you know one other</p>
<p>little cold and it&rsquo;s just I mean he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a good bait what I noticed when</p>
<p>Amber was breastfeeding was that there</p>
<p>was a period of time where she kind of</p>
<p>tested it where she wasn&rsquo;t kedo and the</p>
<p>breast when it would go in the fridge</p>
<p>the fat that would have come to the top</p>
<p>was about yay big</p>
<p>maybe like a centimeter versus when she</p>
<p>would go back in Quito and then we would</p>
<p>actually refrigerate me whatever she was</p>
<p>pumping I&rsquo;m kidding you not Eric it was</p>
<p>like an inch of fat that was float to</p>
<p>the top it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>the overall volume of liquid was less I</p>
<p>would say and that makes sense because</p>
<p>probably in a slight state of not want</p>
<p>to say dehydration but just less fluid</p>
<p>just because your keto and but I was so</p>
<p>amazed like net net calorie content I</p>
<p>had to have been double just because the</p>
<p>amount of fat was twice as much so like</p>
<p>he would latch and he had a little bit</p>
<p>of an issue with latching because he had</p>
<p>a totally you know you&rsquo;re familiar with</p>
<p>a tongue tie so he had a tongue tie</p>
<p>where the tongue basically a little flap</p>
<p>of skin that holds the tongue to the</p>
<p>bottom of the mouth was a little bit too</p>
<p>large or it was just fastened a little</p>
<p>bit too close to even to the tongue so</p>
<p>he was having a hard time latching so we</p>
<p>were concerned that he wasn&rsquo;t getting</p>
<p>enough nutrients but here this kid was</p>
<p>growing like a weed and the fact that</p>
<p>the number was on keto he didn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>consume nearly as much milk just because</p>
<p>the fat content was so high so it was ah</p>
<p>yeah it was really interesting now how</p>
<p>long did she breastfeed for so she</p>
<p>stressed fed for about seven months</p>
<p>before her supply started to go and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you know so we were like okay</p>
<p>well what do we do because we were</p>
<p>really cuz we don&rsquo;t like formula no but</p>
<p>then we actually did find we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>okay if we we can do peas a little hard</p>
<p>to digest but they do make a goat milk</p>
<p>formula which is a to casein so if you</p>
<p>people out there do have to supplement</p>
<p>and it does happen go with like a goat</p>
<p>milk formula or something that&rsquo;s a to do</p>
<p>not this is okay I mean I can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>parental advice I&rsquo;m not having a dad</p>
<p>long enough but come on like that the</p>
<p>the formulas that are out there like you</p>
<p>can get a goat milk for me</p>
<p>I think the one we used was Holly an</p>
<p>organic goat milk that&rsquo;s a to casein</p>
<p>those of you are familiar with a 2 a 1 a</p>
<p>2 is the beta casein that is not doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have nearly as many inflammatory</p>
<p>linkages to it and it also doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the the high opioid level that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically the opiate response level that</p>
<p>typical a 1 this so yeah not addictive</p>
<p>because little babies get don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>it but they get addicted to formula so</p>
<p>oh my gosh it&rsquo;s just insane so so you um</p>
<p>you started to enhance the diet and then</p>
<p>did you do you actually do solid foods</p>
<p>as well oh yeah he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s been on</p>
<p>solid food we did you familiar with baby</p>
<p>led weaning yeah so baby led weaning is</p>
<p>where you you let them start to have</p>
<p>solid food at a pretty young age like 6</p>
<p>months you just learnt letting them kind</p>
<p>of like pick at it and you just monitor</p>
<p>them closely and you know so by the time</p>
<p>he was 8 months he was eating solid food</p>
<p>so we figured okay if if the supply is</p>
<p>you know not as great as we want to be</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get him on solid for as much as we</p>
<p>can and you know everything that we were</p>
<p>diving into research wives saying no the</p>
<p>only reason yeah you continued to either</p>
<p>a breast feed or formula feed or milk</p>
<p>feed if the baby&rsquo;s not getting enough</p>
<p>nutrients and our baby was he was eating</p>
<p>I mean you know the funny thing his</p>
<p>favorite food was broccolini like baby</p>
<p>broccoli so he was just devouring that</p>
<p>stuff yeah so it&rsquo;s well it&rsquo;s good these</p>
<p>babies can adapt I mean they they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna quickly develop what they need to</p>
<p>digest that food I think the big</p>
<p>challenge that I think we&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>is other relatives and that you know</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re gonna bring Lucy&rsquo;s somewhere</p>
<p>to a party or something</p>
<p>all the other garbage because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really hard to get everyone in my entire</p>
<p>environment to be on page with that so</p>
<p>you know last thing I&rsquo;m gonna do is have</p>
<p>some of these you know these parties</p>
<p>where they have all the sugar and then</p>
<p>start that yeah I&rsquo;m gonna try to avoid</p>
<p>it as much as possible I want her to be</p>
<p>a Kido Kido baby yeah as long as</p>
<p>possible</p>
<p>agreed agreed and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bummer cause I mean it&rsquo;s I try to keep</p>
<p>it out of my mind but it&rsquo;s a reality</p>
<p>that as kids get older they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be exposed to these things and the only</p>
<p>thing that you can do is teach them that</p>
<p>the way that your</p>
<p>teaching them to eat not necessarily is</p>
<p>the right way but make it fun and if</p>
<p>they feel good there&rsquo;s gonna be a simple</p>
<p>Pavlovian response where they go and</p>
<p>they have that garbage food and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna feel good right and you know I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be the dad that&rsquo;s saying like you</p>
<p>go to Jimmy&rsquo;s house and you don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>dare eat that isn&rsquo;t a breed resentment</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna work but I know that</p>
<p>if he goes to Jimmy&rsquo;s house and he has a</p>
<p>pop tart that he&rsquo;s gonna come home and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a dad I don&rsquo;t feel so good right I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t exactly yeah I don&rsquo;t want to use</p>
<p>too much force but I do want to educate</p>
<p>them what I do with my kids is I I</p>
<p>showed him a couple of videos on just</p>
<p>foods in general one was actually about</p>
<p>GMO foods and I did see when they were</p>
<p>probably like six or seven eight this</p>
<p>shift so they&rsquo;re like you know what you</p>
<p>see the you know the point where now</p>
<p>they can I&rsquo;m gonna start a woody now</p>
<p>versus me telling what to eat so yeah I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a self-determined thing that</p>
<p>they have to eventually you know have a</p>
<p>lipoma offered of course used too much</p>
<p>force they&rsquo;re just gonna do the opposite</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re gonna go okay I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>do this despite you so good yeah not</p>
<p>exactly but I mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so fun to</p>
<p>watch and it&rsquo;s so fun to see just</p>
<p>everything click and knowing that you</p>
<p>know this high DHA diet that you know my</p>
<p>babies eating is is working and I am NOT</p>
<p>one to ever like try to compare to</p>
<p>others but I see his development</p>
<p>compared to a lot of others and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>like wow okay it&rsquo;s a boat of confidence</p>
<p>for me and we&rsquo;re doing something right</p>
<p>if I fail at everything else I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>in life right now</p>
<p>I know that at least I think we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>something right here and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>amazing and that was one of the you know</p>
<p>one of the key supplements that my wife</p>
<p>took the route pregnancy was you know</p>
<p>like high dose of DHA docosahexaenoic</p>
<p>acid know whether it be from shallow</p>
<p>marine whether it be from some forms of</p>
<p>krill alcohol oil we rotated them up and</p>
<p>I think that I made a really big big</p>
<p>change I&rsquo;m really think of it yes brain</p>
<p>development yeah I optic nerve do you</p>
<p>find that what about nutritional yeast</p>
<p>did you use that at all we haven&rsquo;t used</p>
<p>it with with him I mean I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>practically addicted to the stuff I put</p>
<p>everything if I&rsquo;ve seen my video where I</p>
<p>but always put it like my favorite is</p>
<p>putting in a nutritional yeast with a</p>
<p>little bit of coconut oil or premise of</p>
<p>putting it with asparagus and a little</p>
<p>bit of coconut oil and mixing it up and</p>
<p>I mean it tastes amazing but I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>done any anything with him and</p>
<p>nutritional yeast however he I mean he</p>
<p>eats the asparagus that I make with</p>
<p>nutritional yeast didn&rsquo;t devours it but</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done any specific protocols or</p>
<p>anything like that now when you were a</p>
<p>kid did you were you a junkie or did you</p>
<p>were you raised really healthy in the</p>
<p>very beginning and then what what</p>
<p>happened what did you eat yeah it was</p>
<p>interesting my mom was was hard on us</p>
<p>kids in a really interesting way like I</p>
<p>ran my first marathon when I was 11</p>
<p>years old which was probably too young</p>
<p>to run a marathon but you know my mom&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always about pushing us and it was</p>
<p>interesting I think it raised my sister</p>
<p>raised my sister and I in a very unique</p>
<p>way so it was interesting like from what</p>
<p>I recall with my childhood was was</p>
<p>definitely was not a junk food junkie at</p>
<p>all but there would be random things</p>
<p>that my parents would be wildly opposed</p>
<p>to and random things that they would</p>
<p>allow like I do remember going to</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s and getting McChicken</p>
<p>sandwiches somewhat frequently but then</p>
<p>I also remember hearing that cornflakes</p>
<p>which weren&rsquo;t even sweetened were by</p>
<p>abstain from them at all costs don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever touch a cornflake so there was just</p>
<p>these weird mixed messages that I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>like okay I go get a McChicken</p>
<p>but I keep you know these weird personal</p>
<p>biases or just getting kind of put onto</p>
<p>us with no real rhyme or reason but I</p>
<p>learned at a really young age I took a</p>
<p>took a real interest in just my blood</p>
<p>work by the time I was like 13 years old</p>
<p>I was really interested in things I I</p>
<p>started working out and I had a friend</p>
<p>that was a doctor and or his friends who</p>
<p>dad was a doctor and I I got some blood</p>
<p>work done for some routine thing and I</p>
<p>started getting like really interested</p>
<p>in like what makes the body tick and I</p>
<p>remember seeing I remember vividly my</p>
<p>middle school cross-country coach</p>
<p>telling me that his triglycerides were</p>
<p>high and this was like a super health</p>
<p>guy and then I remember looking at my</p>
<p>lab results for some reason and finding</p>
<p>that my triglycerides are high that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>triglyceride</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a thin runner and like what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on and it just so it was at that very</p>
<p>point in time where I started learning</p>
<p>about okay well you could be a seemingly</p>
<p>healthy person very athletic person</p>
<p>and I have a high storage form of fat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not actually depositing as</p>
<p>adipose tissue and I was like I remember</p>
<p>freaking out me like I&rsquo;m fat on the</p>
<p>inside I&rsquo;m actually I&rsquo;m fat on the</p>
<p>inside I&rsquo;m just not fat so I developed</p>
<p>this sort of interest in it and then I</p>
<p>worked really interesting as I remember</p>
<p>my parents were divorced after about 13</p>
<p>14 years old and I remember I used to go</p>
<p>to dinner with my dad</p>
<p>a couple times per week or one time per</p>
<p>week and I remember I used to feel so</p>
<p>much better if I if I would go with my</p>
<p>dad we&rsquo;d go out to pizza but I always</p>
<p>found that if I just abstained from food</p>
<p>throughout the course of the day that I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t bloat as much when I ate the</p>
<p>pizza so it was funny I look back I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like oh my gosh I was intermittent</p>
<p>fasting at 14 years old</p>
<p>various I just felt better granted I was</p>
<p>breaking my fast food Pizza but I was</p>
<p>like I feel so much better</p>
<p>the day after I eat it was wild</p>
<p>interesting well I saw your picture that</p>
<p>you have posted and some of the videos</p>
<p>as well you you were very large at one</p>
<p>time yeah what was it like was it close</p>
<p>to 300 yeah I was about 200 205 pounds</p>
<p>so that was so I went from being super</p>
<p>athletic in high school a little bit of</p>
<p>college to getting into the corporate</p>
<p>world I was in corporate healthcare and</p>
<p>I was a physician recruiter and honestly</p>
<p>I just I cut my lifting down from four</p>
<p>days five days per week down to like one</p>
<p>day per week and I was just it quite</p>
<p>frankly doctor it was like a it was kind</p>
<p>of a bulk gone wrong like it was like I</p>
<p>started me like I want to put some</p>
<p>muscle on and then just stop worrying</p>
<p>about the gym portion altogether because</p>
<p>I was focused on making money in my</p>
<p>career and yada yada and you know next</p>
<p>thing I know it&rsquo;s been really six seven</p>
<p>months later I&rsquo;m looking at myself being</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m a shell if the person I used to</p>
<p>be like what the heck is going on you</p>
<p>know so it&rsquo;s I wasn&rsquo;t overweight for a</p>
<p>really long period of time but what made</p>
<p>it really interesting was that I had</p>
<p>experience I was I looked like the the</p>
<p>football coach that just kind of just</p>
<p>let himself go they used to play</p>
<p>football and then just stop playing</p>
<p>football and just continue to eat like</p>
<p>that I like I was a decently muscled</p>
<p>person but I was just sloppy and what</p>
<p>age was that so I was young I was 22 so</p>
<p>it was like I was way too young and you</p>
<p>know so it wasn&rsquo;t until you know I was</p>
<p>our pre diet</p>
<p>at 22 I went from being seemingly pretty</p>
<p>darn healthy to gaining a ton of weight</p>
<p>and ICRP levels were off the charts I</p>
<p>was in the healthcare world so I mean I</p>
<p>had access to amazing physicians and</p>
<p>everything else so unfortunately I was</p>
<p>at a young age which I think thank</p>
<p>goodness I was at a young age because I</p>
<p>was able to bounce back and recover and</p>
<p>get my head on straight</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m I was fearful that I had had</p>
<p>gone on for another ten years</p>
<p>it could have been really serious yeah</p>
<p>Wow interesting yeah I was uh I was very</p>
<p>very thin did the whole wrestling thing</p>
<p>in college and then you know I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you know I need to gain some weight so I</p>
<p>start eating potatoes at first I was</p>
<p>trying like just milk fat cheese butter</p>
<p>and I noticed I was trying to I was</p>
<p>getting skinnier this is actually in San</p>
<p>Diego and I&rsquo;m like well that didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>so I started doing potatoes and I did</p>
<p>not gain any weight to a hit like 28</p>
<p>years old and then I was started to</p>
<p>putting a little pizza crust around my</p>
<p>waist at 28 so but I didn&rsquo;t you know get</p>
<p>extremely weight away but the point is</p>
<p>that I started having a combination of</p>
<p>inflammatory problems probably so much</p>
<p>of you I started noticing arthritis in</p>
<p>my fingers and my back and got so bad</p>
<p>where I actually was living I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where I was at the time but I flew to</p>
<p>Bernard Jensen remember him yep</p>
<p>he was to colon hydrotherapy genius guy</p>
<p>so I got there a visit him because I I</p>
<p>figure well maybe he knows what&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>with me and I said I waited all day to</p>
<p>see what was wrong and I said I stand in</p>
<p>line and I said what is going on because</p>
<p>look at my eyes they&rsquo;re all bloodshot</p>
<p>the inside of the eyelids he looked at</p>
<p>me and he just said I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like I came all the way out here I</p>
<p>thought you were gonna solve all my</p>
<p>problems right so that was just a severe</p>
<p>hypoglycemia um it was bad blood sugar</p>
<p>problems high insulin was inflamed and I</p>
<p>was in San Diego at the time and I was</p>
<p>driving on the street and I said honey</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s since the health house let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>see the house is just like yellow</p>
<p>building so we go in there this guy had</p>
<p>all these protein</p>
<p>protein pills and raw milk and so I</p>
<p>started that and he&rsquo;s had us back in his</p>
<p>backyard working out like all these</p>
<p>things I was I remember I was just</p>
<p>searching so desperately to try to find</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong and then I just happened to</p>
<p>stumble on this book mastering the zone</p>
<p>I started reading the saying about</p>
<p>inside my what I studied this in school</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t really click so I I started</p>
<p>eating buffalo burger for breakfast and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like and no more life cereal and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like God do I feel good so I started to</p>
<p>go Karen this is it this is amazing you</p>
<p>know sorry I just don&rsquo;t write in</p>
<p>headfirst she and ice I said I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>actually I don&rsquo;t want to do chiropractic</p>
<p>anymore she goes what do you want to do</p>
<p>its energy nutrition she goes you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know anything about it I said I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>learn so I said you okay so you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>quit chiropractic and get a nutrition I</p>
<p>say yep so here I am in the basically in</p>
<p>our library or actually on our living</p>
<p>room studying and trying to learn and</p>
<p>going to coast graduate seminars and</p>
<p>stuff and that&rsquo;s kind of how it started</p>
<p>but it was out of desperation for just</p>
<p>straight trying to figure out this</p>
<p>inflammatory condition and severe</p>
<p>insomnia and all that stuff I think I</p>
<p>think most people that I know even when</p>
<p>when do I need the last summit like no</p>
<p>one really gets into this unless they</p>
<p>have a personal health crisis I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know do you know you know have anyone</p>
<p>that got into it because well I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>already doing good I think I just want</p>
<p>to go do beat Duke II know yeah I mean</p>
<p>the only time that I see that is people</p>
<p>that are in the biohacking world that I</p>
<p>want an additional tool but there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>real call to action there it&rsquo;s more so</p>
<p>just oh well you tell me that I can you</p>
<p>know hiding my cognitive function and do</p>
<p>this so there is a small subset there</p>
<p>but yeah there&rsquo;s almost always a call to</p>
<p>action and like my call to action was I</p>
<p>was you know I was in the healthcare</p>
<p>world and I was the epitome of being</p>
<p>unhealthy like it was just and so if I</p>
<p>had a just a connection at that point</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m going oh my gosh okay like</p>
<p>this is a perfect example of what is</p>
<p>wrong with our healthcare system but</p>
<p>also what is wrong with me Rann</p>
<p>so I mean for me it was</p>
<p>was that it was like I want to do the</p>
<p>opposite of what I&rsquo;m doing now but in</p>
<p>the same vein of helping people right</p>
<p>and as you know then there is the side</p>
<p>mission okay well I&rsquo;ve already lost this</p>
<p>way now I want to get really good shape</p>
<p>and see how far I can take this and kind</p>
<p>of a personal mission and then my next</p>
<p>step was I realized that the fitness</p>
<p>industry was extremely unhealthy and</p>
<p>like the fitness industry is like</p>
<p>artificially healthy fluorescent powders</p>
<p>and and whatever it takes to look a</p>
<p>certain way for a finite period of time</p>
<p>and then not really think about their</p>
<p>health I&rsquo;m like boy oh boy is there a</p>
<p>gap that needs to be bridged here where</p>
<p>you can actually apply true health</p>
<p>principles to fitness okay it&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>concept okay yeah I am I mean out of</p>
<p>desperation I I remember going into a</p>
<p>room with patients and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>complaining about some symptom and</p>
<p>thinking if they only knew how effed up</p>
<p>I was here like I&rsquo;m coming out of I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t slept in four days I just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sleep on chronically fatigued with</p>
<p>arthritis and they&rsquo;re complaining I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like I should be the patient you know so</p>
<p>there was that little secret that I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know but yeah</p>
<p>things start turning around but yeah it</p>
<p>was some out of even in like</p>
<p>chiropractic I remember we lived in this</p>
<p>house all these curls and we would have</p>
<p>deep fry night like three times a week</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just healthy deep fry night</p>
<p>right it was no it was Crisco it was</p>
<p>like they would do that and then we</p>
<p>would do meatloaf with counting like it</p>
<p>just constantly carved out and extreme</p>
<p>and I remember having severe right</p>
<p>shoulder pain going what is that coming</p>
<p>from you know mr. gallbladder was</p>
<p>completely inflamed so I think out of</p>
<p>all the people that I&rsquo;ve ever met I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;ve had every single symptom that</p>
<p>everyone complains about so I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how I that helped me relate to</p>
<p>people I&rsquo;m like oh you you have that no</p>
<p>I had that too so and it&rsquo;s good and bad</p>
<p>at the same time but I think for me if I</p>
<p>never went through that I would never</p>
<p>push myself to learn some of the stuff</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m into right now would you no no</p>
<p>definitely I mean there&rsquo;s people always</p>
<p>comment in my videos that oh you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>such a energy that&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>passion is there because every time I</p>
<p>learn something I&rsquo;m applying it to my</p>
<p>own regimen right and I&rsquo;m learning it so</p>
<p>that I can be better too so the funny</p>
<p>thing is is here I am an online</p>
<p>Authority like you and but I&rsquo;m learning</p>
<p>as I go to and it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s great like I</p>
<p>there sure I have a foundational</p>
<p>knowledge and there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve learned and haven&rsquo;t built a</p>
<p>great repository of clinical studies and</p>
<p>information but like I learned and I</p>
<p>love sharing and when you see the</p>
<p>passion you know specific video where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like aww Thomas is really heated</p>
<p>or he seems really amped up about this</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s genuine</p>
<p>excitement because I just learned</p>
<p>something that I&rsquo;m applying to my life</p>
<p>now and seeing a result and I know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the same way and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m not just going to like</p>
<p>regurgitate something that&rsquo;s boring to</p>
<p>me I like I&rsquo;m gonna stick with in the</p>
<p>vein of what I&rsquo;m passionate and excited</p>
<p>about and where I&rsquo;ve been and where I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been able to see a change in my life</p>
<p>because I know that my viewers have</p>
<p>expressed the same issues and concerns</p>
<p>you know whether it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>inflammation based or whether it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be fat loss based or workout based I</p>
<p>know where they&rsquo;re coming from</p>
<p>yes even though I was only there for a</p>
<p>short amount of time I&rsquo;ve been there and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s a so it&rsquo;s fun that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why I love I love what I do now and I</p>
<p>know you do too it&rsquo;s just I can&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>imagine being back in that you know</p>
<p>corporate junkie position I know I know</p>
<p>I I&rsquo;m actually doing exactly what I want</p>
<p>to do like every day I like to research</p>
<p>I like to figure out mysteries of things</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to educate people and I</p>
<p>could just keep doing that and I do a</p>
<p>lot of that but yeah it&rsquo;s fun and you</p>
<p>know my wife says don&rsquo;t you even want to</p>
<p>read anything else I&rsquo;m like you know um</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t you interested like now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>interested like I have this new here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>book right here I&rsquo;m reading right now</p>
<p>natural products and drug discovery an</p>
<p>integrated approach so first of all like</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>book written by Indian doctors about all</p>
<p>of the natural remedies that drug</p>
<p>companies get their ideas from I mean</p>
<p>this is like pure gold and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going into like these herbs in the</p>
<p>history of the anti inflammatories</p>
<p>signals but down and of course you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain everything my wife and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like ok can we talk about</p>
<p>something else</p>
<p>yeah appreciate it that I&rsquo;m at least</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s into it but unfortunately</p>
<p>though some of these books are this was</p>
<p>like $150 I&rsquo;m like he can&rsquo;t just go and</p>
<p>get him for $29 so some of these really</p>
<p>technical books and filled with gold</p>
<p>sometimes you have to be learned you</p>
<p>know but you know I&rsquo;ll have three ideas</p>
<p>for rough to bat for videos that I&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>just to research on it like they have if</p>
<p>a drug company takes a property off of</p>
<p>garlic extract um they&rsquo;re gonna invest a</p>
<p>lot of money in something like that for</p>
<p>because obviously it must work so I want</p>
<p>to know all about it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating ya know that is</p>
<p>fascinating and you know well I know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got your you know electrolyte</p>
<p>blend and everything like that I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve read have you read this book this</p>
<p>is actually one that I the sole fix</p>
<p>bucket Jenek the reason that you know I</p>
<p>I have not in a Kindle it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>interesting book I like a really really</p>
<p>interesting book and when you apply it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some of a lot of the things that he</p>
<p>talks about dr. Jeannette talks about or</p>
<p>just exacerbated on a keto diet in a</p>
<p>positive way I mean it&rsquo;s just like the</p>
<p>impact of so that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s been my</p>
<p>recent you know third outlet</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always have at least one or two nerd</p>
<p>outlets going at a specific absolutely</p>
<p>so so what&rsquo;s a good takeaway that you</p>
<p>want to tell people about that book that</p>
<p>you kind of just just generalized I mean</p>
<p>I did a video on it some people saw it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one thing called the NST</p>
<p>receptors which is a wild wild world</p>
<p>like basically they now find that salt</p>
<p>and being deprived of salt or being</p>
<p>deficient in sodium literally if someone</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s put it better to put it in an</p>
<p>analogy or an example if you were</p>
<p>deficient in salt or you&rsquo;re on the keto</p>
<p>diet and you&rsquo;re not getting enough salt</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not salt in your food with</p>
<p>good healthy salt and you were creating</p>
<p>salt well salt is the one</p>
<p>thing that our bodies inherently know to</p>
<p>get when we are deficient in it hence</p>
<p>why livestock directly know how to go to</p>
<p>a Salt Lick it&rsquo;s really wild and as like</p>
<p>oh my gosh that just clicked like dick</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got horses so we know like we can</p>
<p>put any color salt brick in the middle</p>
<p>of the pasture and they&rsquo;ll go to it</p>
<p>because we know sou means into that</p>
<p>critical to our function know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really wild is in human studies if you</p>
<p>give human something sweet when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in salt it&rsquo;s gonna satisfy the</p>
<p>same receptor that would have been</p>
<p>satisfied if they had salt so what that</p>
<p>means is that we have signals that get</p>
<p>crossed that make it like so on keto</p>
<p>like if someone does start getting</p>
<p>cravings the first thing I say is</p>
<p>increase your salt because the signals</p>
<p>are getting across and you might be</p>
<p>craving something sweet because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really craving salt and they do that and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like I got just like the salt</p>
<p>cravings gone it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s why a lot of</p>
<p>people crave salt and sugar at the same</p>
<p>time I&rsquo;m sure it is it&rsquo;s a combination</p>
<p>of that plus of course the hyper</p>
<p>palatability that&rsquo;s just not a natural</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same thing why fats and carbs</p>
<p>together are so interesting like I think</p>
<p>there was one study I just thought the</p>
<p>other day it&rsquo;s an older study but let</p>
<p>you look at I took subjects that would</p>
<p>say then give show a picture of cards</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;d show a picture of meat</p>
<p>and fat and then they&rsquo;d show them a</p>
<p>picture of like a pastry where it come</p>
<p>by and the salivary response and</p>
<p>everything of the combined fats in cars</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not something that would</p>
<p>really occur in nature like we wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really very seldom do you have things</p>
<p>that are naturally high in fat and carbs</p>
<p>at the same time very few you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a whole lot of that and it&rsquo;s so I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple there&rsquo;s the hyper call</p>
<p>ability there&rsquo;s the signals getting</p>
<p>crossed I mean I&rsquo;m not a neuroscientist</p>
<p>but about that whole world fascinates me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting because I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m kind</p>
<p>of like the same way like I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>right now I&rsquo;m into vitamin D hardcore so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just I can&rsquo;t get enough information</p>
<p>about him indeed but I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll kind of</p>
<p>go rotate in two different areas but</p>
<p>vitamin D and I&rsquo;ll just kind of touch on</p>
<p>it just because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like every</p>
<p>single immune cell has a receptor for</p>
<p>vitamin D mm-hmm and you have the cell</p>
<p>called a neutrophil and it&rsquo;s it is</p>
<p>basically an assassin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of your soldier immune cells</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s triggered by vitamin D and it</p>
<p>has many different strategies one is it</p>
<p>has enzymes that basically will kill</p>
<p>bacteria eats bacteria but it has this</p>
<p>this net structure that&rsquo;s about 25 times</p>
<p>its size that it throws over bacteria</p>
<p>and viruses and and then it releases</p>
<p>free radicals and enzymes and then it</p>
<p>just explodes it actually explodes like</p>
<p>a little popper and kills the thing</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s suicide bombers yeah so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like fascinating so when your vitamin D</p>
<p>deficient they don&rsquo;t gonna work they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work that well so it really brings</p>
<p>up raise your defenses way down makes</p>
<p>you susceptible so I am just like this</p>
<p>could be a science fiction I mean sci-fi</p>
<p>movie like incredible just about what</p>
<p>happens inside your body</p>
<p>and like even with vitamin D there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>four mutations that people can have so</p>
<p>if you limitation you&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>absorb vitamin D and you can get these</p>
<p>tested genetically and so you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take either take more or you can</p>
<p>do other things as well to increase the</p>
<p>absorption like take my assaults but I</p>
<p>mean especially with even breastfeeding</p>
<p>a mother that&rsquo;s breastfeeding if they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take some additional vitamin D</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really out of all the nutrients</p>
<p>that one is the the hardest to achieve</p>
<p>just regular foods because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>really you know it&rsquo;s like sunshine but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not in a lot of foods unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing combat oil I mean maybe a little</p>
<p>bit of mushrooms but I think mushrooms</p>
<p>is that d2 yep yeah you&rsquo;ve got to be</p>
<p>able to have that active conversion and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an cod liver oil that&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m a huge proponent of a tube since</p>
<p>the bite bioavailable you&rsquo;re not looking</p>
<p>synthetic and the same thing not to</p>
<p>digress but I mean the live an ad</p>
<p>combination liver oil the the retinol a</p>
<p>the true bioavailable form that actually</p>
<p>has what are called pro resolving</p>
<p>mediators I mean it&rsquo;s like that whole</p>
<p>world and you&rsquo;re totally dead on you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really get vitamin D from really</p>
<p>good food sources and the egg supply</p>
<p>that we do wouldn&rsquo;t normally get vitamin</p>
<p>D from I mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s negligible to be completely</p>
<p>honest and right but then everything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying about you know that the</p>
<p>t-cell and the diet item D receptors and</p>
<p>everything it makes sense why we get so</p>
<p>sick in the wintertime when we have less</p>
<p>sun exposure and we&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s a we could</p>
<p>we should have a whole series on this</p>
<p>where we could probably drive people</p>
<p>crazy with with this stuff for for six</p>
<p>hours at a time</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>well I wanted to just chat with you a</p>
<p>little bit I I know your time you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to get back to</p>
<p>studies and or your family right now but</p>
<p>I wanted to touch base and just</p>
<p>collaborate a little bit and also just</p>
<p>tell people that you are going to be at</p>
<p>the event coming at the end of August 29</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re gonna have a blast and so for</p>
<p>you for those of you who are watching</p>
<p>you should you should definitely sign up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put a link down below and we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wait to meet you guys so definite Amoz</p>
<p>thank you so much for this interview and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll definitely do more definitely it</p>
<p>was nice to touch base absolutely and</p>
<p>and yeah it&rsquo;s I mean literally at your</p>
<p>event it&rsquo;s probably the only time in the</p>
<p>foreseeable future that people are going</p>
<p>to be able to be with dr. Berg and</p>
<p>Thomas de Lauer at the same time so</p>
<p>world we&rsquo;ve got a lot of mutual</p>
<p>followers and everyone that follows my</p>
<p>channel is a huge fan of yours and so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do whatever I can to help you know</p>
<p>spread spread the worry but excited to</p>
<p>see a lot of people there cuz I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>tracking the who&rsquo;s signing up and I had</p>
<p>I had you know several people I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if it was a group or something but</p>
<p>my staff always surveys like what why</p>
<p>why do you want to come well we want to</p>
<p>meet that just added Tom we want to meet</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s yeah you know I mentioned it so</p>
<p>you know what it was I mentioned it it</p>
<p>was right after you&rsquo;d reached out to me</p>
<p>I just mentioned it in a lesson of a</p>
<p>live broadcast and it was like a subtle</p>
<p>mention it was just like yeah I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>be a doctor burgers event and you know</p>
<p>so I think that might have been a little</p>
<p>cluster of people that came from just</p>
<p>from that little live broadcast so yeah</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to you know as you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t want to just like put</p>
<p>it out to my audience and if but I mean</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to if we spread the word more</p>
<p>but I also don&rsquo;t want I know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>limited on seats so I don&rsquo;t want to like</p>
<p>have both of us blow it up too much and</p>
<p>have people miss out and I like that so</p>
<p>right exactly well we&rsquo;ll just invite the</p>
<p>people that we know</p>
<p>okay</p>
