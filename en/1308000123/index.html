    <p>Hey, everybody, Merry Christmas. Happy Holidays. It is the end</p>
<p>of 2022. And once again, we&rsquo;re doing our bestie awards. Yes, at</p>
<p>the end of the year, we do our bestie awards. This is where we</p>
<p>give awards to the biggest winners, losers, and many other</p>
<p>categories that you love with me again, of course, the Sultan of</p>
<p>science, deep in his Kurosawa vibes. How are you doing</p>
<p>Sultan? It was great to see you guys for dinner last night,</p>
<p>Sachs, we missed you. That was a lot of fun. We all got together</p>
<p>twice this week for dinner while we were on vacation. And during</p>
<p>our dinner, we took a vote and Sachs you are now the director</p>
<p>of the all in summit. Congratulations. Congratulations.</p>
<p>Yes, the grift is on my first act is to veto it. Okay, sorry</p>
<p>to the fans. Also with us, of course, is the dictator himself</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya deep in his turtleneck phase and his vibes</p>
<p>tell us about your winter vibes, bestie.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t believe that we all took over Lake Tahoe for a</p>
<p>week together. It&rsquo;s cool. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun. I gotta say,</p>
<p>Sachs, you&rsquo;ll be surprised Jay cow has the life hack of life</p>
<p>hacks here. He&rsquo;s figured out how to basically get everything</p>
<p>pre wired. All the restaurants all the reservations. It&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>great. I&rsquo;ve loved it. We&rsquo;ve had a wonderful time. It&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>eight person table for every night. And he does it what</p>
<p>months in advance. So every two weeks out, I get a table of</p>
<p>eight for five, six nights in a row. And then I invite my</p>
<p>besties out. And oddly, it turned out there was only one</p>
<p>person from Jake outside just himself. Yes. For the rest of us</p>
<p>to show. We had a wonderful time. I picked up the check for</p>
<p>the nachos and Chamath brought $6,000 worth of wine. I brought</p>
<p>my own also to the restaurant yesterday so we could open the</p>
<p>line properly. It was wonderful. We&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>wonderful time. And of course with us looks like he had to</p>
<p>work over the Christmas break. Sachs How are you doing,</p>
<p>brother? You working today? I&rsquo;m good. I&rsquo;m just hanging out</p>
<p>somewhere. Well, come on. You could be honest. You&rsquo;re at the</p>
<p>Twitter HQ. I recognize that incredible architecture and</p>
<p>design. They spent so much money on that office space.</p>
<p>Beautiful. That&rsquo;s definitely beautiful office got their own</p>
<p>bespoke coffee shop here called the perch. We&rsquo;re the people that</p>
<p>work there.</p>
<p>Too soon. People are working too hard to be hanging out in the</p>
<p>coffee shop.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride. Rain Man David.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s get started with our bestie awards. This is a</p>
<p>very controversial. We start with a political award. And last</p>
<p>year, you know, this is our just so we&rsquo;re clear, this is not the</p>
<p>prediction show. That next week will be the prediction show.</p>
<p>This week is our winners. Cue the music. Yes. Cue the music.</p>
<p>Right there. Okay, here we go. 2022 predictions. This is what</p>
<p>we predicted for the bestie award for biggest political</p>
<p>winner. I said Ron DeSantis, and so did David Sachs, we predicted</p>
<p>in 20 after me, you said it after me. And the way you</p>
<p>introduced it, you said, What did Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s writers</p>
<p>come up with? I said DeSantis. And then you said DeSantis. Are</p>
<p>you starting already? Literally, I&rsquo;m trying to give you your</p>
<p>flowers.</p>
<p>Okay, take it easy. You&rsquo;re gonna get your flowers. So Ron DeSantis</p>
<p>obviously a big winner. So those were those were great</p>
<p>predictions. Freeberg with a wildcard there. He predicted</p>
<p>Putin would be a winner in 2022. That one fell a little flat. Did</p>
<p>it not our friend Freeberg? Not a winner.</p>
<p>No, I think he you know, I mean, my projection was really built</p>
<p>on what I thought would be a big kind of influence that he</p>
<p>would gain this year. You know, whether he&rsquo;s viewed negatively</p>
<p>or positively, he&rsquo;s certainly at the center of the stage right</p>
<p>now. Now, Chamath, your 22 prediction, this is your</p>
<p>prediction last year for this year, was that the biggest</p>
<p>political winner would be Xi Jinping. Okay. Now we go to our</p>
<p>actual biggest winner. This is where we tell you who we thought</p>
<p>was the biggest winner of 2022. Let&rsquo;s start with you, Sax. Who</p>
<p>is your biggest winner for 2022? Political biggest winner?</p>
<p>This was the prediction that I nailed as you mentioned it. So</p>
<p>the red wave fizzled everywhere else, but it crashed over</p>
<p>Florida hard. So DeSantis is my pick. He won reelection by about</p>
<p>20 points. And his coattails carried four new GOP house</p>
<p>seats, which happens to be the exact size of the GOP majority.</p>
<p>Several polls have now shown him beating Donald Trump by</p>
<p>significant margins for the 2024 GOP nomination. He is</p>
<p>shattering fundraising records, Florida is now the fastest</p>
<p>growing state. So he is my pick for the biggest winner,</p>
<p>political winner of 2022. Great. Who is your biggest political</p>
<p>winner?</p>
<p>Chama? I mean, it&rsquo;s obvious. It&rsquo;s a huge impact. You know,</p>
<p>there is no single person in the world that is now as powerful as</p>
<p>this one man, he has complete authoritarian control over 1.2</p>
<p>odd billion people and 20% of the world&rsquo;s GDP and a large</p>
<p>amount of the world&rsquo;s debt, including a lot of us dollar</p>
<p>debt. And so you know, it&rsquo;s pretty, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to find anybody that won nearly as much as he did.</p>
<p>Okay, now to you, Friedberg, who is your biggest political</p>
<p>winner of 2022?</p>
<p>I mean, I think you&rsquo;re the Santas and G. Jinping calls were</p>
<p>really like, good. I think the biggest surprising winner for me</p>
<p>is like, you know, unexpected. And that would be Zelensky from</p>
<p>the Ukraine. I don&rsquo;t think going into this year, people paid as</p>
<p>much attention to him. He was certainly not a song hero. But</p>
<p>coming through this conflict, and I think leading the</p>
<p>storyline, about our common enemy of the West, and common</p>
<p>enemy of democracy being Vladimir Putin, really kind of</p>
<p>made him a superstar and a hero on a global stage. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s evidenced by the fact that he&rsquo;s in the White House.</p>
<p>And he gave an address to the US Congress yesterday. So I would</p>
<p>make him kind of the biggest winner of the year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to go against a Santa. So, you know, he clearly has,</p>
<p>as sacks correctly pointed out, gone into the lead, we&rsquo;ll see if</p>
<p>he can be Trump in the primaries. I have my doubts,</p>
<p>but he does seem to be pulling in some of those moderates,</p>
<p>right? I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand why you guys say he&rsquo;s a political winner. What did he</p>
<p>win? He hasn&rsquo;t won the nomination yet. He got reelected</p>
<p>to a state that he had before 2022. So what did he win</p>
<p>exactly?</p>
<p>Well, I think a couple of things. One is when he won</p>
<p>election to the governorship four years ago, it was by less</p>
<p>than 1%. It was a tiny margin of victory. This was margin of</p>
<p>almost 20%. He had coattails. And he is now the front runner</p>
<p>for the GOP nomination in 24. I think you can argue you can make</p>
<p>the case that maybe he&rsquo;s peaking too soon.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad you brought that up. Because if you look at the</p>
<p>data, you know, I think in the last seven or eight nomination</p>
<p>cycles, the person that&rsquo;s been leading the popularity contest</p>
<p>going into the Iowa caucuses has not won the nomination. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>peaking too soon almost.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a possibility. Because when you&rsquo;re the front runner,</p>
<p>everyone takes shots at you. On the other hand, if he stays this</p>
<p>dominant, he will drive out other contenders out of the</p>
<p>primary, and he may be able to solidify it. And if it can just</p>
<p>be DeSantis versus Trump in the primary, he has a much better</p>
<p>shot than if it&rsquo;s Trump versus a bunch of other challengers. And</p>
<p>I think that if he continues to pull this well within the</p>
<p>Republican Party, I think Trump might not run again, because</p>
<p>Trump definitely does not want to risk being a loser in the</p>
<p>Republican primary. So yeah, there&rsquo;s always front runner</p>
<p>risk. But it&rsquo;s hard to say that coming out of this year, that he</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t a huge political winner. Okay, if we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>challenge other people&rsquo;s picks, I would maybe challenge</p>
<p>Zelensky. There&rsquo;s no question that he&rsquo;s been a global media</p>
<p>hero. But two thirds of Kiev is currently without power. 80% of</p>
<p>Kiev doesn&rsquo;t have water, 30% of the Ukrainian power stations</p>
<p>have been destroyed, nearly half of the country&rsquo;s without power.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something like 8 million displaced Ukrainians in the</p>
<p>country. And over 100,000 Ukrainians have been killed in</p>
<p>this war. So yes, he&rsquo;s been a very strong, charismatic war</p>
<p>leader for them. But</p>
<p>Friedberg your response, I&rsquo;m not advocating for his performance</p>
<p>as a leader, I&rsquo;m advocating for his accumulation of political</p>
<p>goodwill. And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Okay, and he is winning the war. So is that winning? Well, in</p>
<p>war, they say there, nobody wins. But it&rsquo;s certainly better</p>
<p>than having your country taken over by Putin. So some would</p>
<p>argue that&rsquo;s winning. Let&rsquo;s go to biggest losers, biggest</p>
<p>losers. In 2022. We predicted again, this is our predictions</p>
<p>from last year. And then we&rsquo;ll go on to our actuals for this</p>
<p>year. Last year, we predicted Chamath said the progressive</p>
<p>left, Sachs said Nancy Pelosi, Friedberg, you said us influence</p>
<p>globally interesting. And I said the extremes both Biden and</p>
<p>Trump. Let&rsquo;s go with our predictions. I&rsquo;m sorry with our</p>
<p>actuals for this year. Chamath, why don&rsquo;t you go first this</p>
<p>time? Who is your biggest political loser for 2022?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as written about as much but the</p>
<p>progressive left did see as much failure as the MAGA right. So</p>
<p>they were a huge loser. I mean, to the extent that anybody</p>
<p>thought that leftist, you know, quasi socialist policies and</p>
<p>politics was a winning strategy. I think that was pretty soundly</p>
<p>refuted, even in places that were pretty staunchly Democrat,</p>
<p>it was really difficult for the progressive left to do much of</p>
<p>anything but lose. So I think that was a really powerful and</p>
<p>important repudiation. And I think it&rsquo;s marginalized as them</p>
<p>to a bunch of, you know, kooks almost. And I think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really healthy for politics going forward.</p>
<p>So your prediction and your actual are going to be the same</p>
<p>the left,</p>
<p>I think they were the biggest political loser in the United</p>
<p>States, at least.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, Elizabeth Warren, we don&rsquo;t hear people talking about</p>
<p>Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders much this year.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I think that the biggest political loser outside</p>
<p>of the United States was probably the European Union.</p>
<p>Okay, you want to expand on that a little bit. If you just think</p>
<p>about the corner that they painted themselves into how much</p>
<p>they had to basically literally go 180 degrees away from what</p>
<p>their policies were, you know, there was a huge raft of whether</p>
<p>it was green ESG kind of woke liberal politics that manifested</p>
<p>itself in all kinds of national security decisions and energy</p>
<p>decisions that in this last year, they literally had to undo</p>
<p>in order to stay alive. And that makes that whole political</p>
<p>construct, I think, very fragile. So they were they were a</p>
<p>pretty big political loser outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Okay, Saks can be hard here to guess this one. But Saks, who is</p>
<p>your biggest political loser in 2022? I have no idea who you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to pick.</p>
<p>By the way, I got Pelosi right last year that she did lose the</p>
<p>gavel. So you&rsquo;ve got to say that the war in Ukraine was the</p>
<p>biggest event of the year. And obviously, you can spread the</p>
<p>blame around to a lot of people starting with Putin, because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the one who ordered the invasion. But I would say this</p>
<p>is a slightly different take on the category, which is biggest</p>
<p>political blunder occurred on January 27 of this year, when</p>
<p>Blinken said that NATO&rsquo;s door is open and must remain open. And</p>
<p>that is our commitment. He basically shut the door. He kept</p>
<p>NATO&rsquo;s door open, but shut the door on any means of a</p>
<p>diplomatic off ramp to end this conflict by promising Russia,</p>
<p>the Ukraine would not become part of NATO. That was the</p>
<p>single biggest diplomatic blunder of this year, or maybe</p>
<p>the last couple of decades, because there&rsquo;s a good chance we</p>
<p>could have avoided this disastrous war, if we had just</p>
<p>been willing to close NATO&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>Wonderful, great, crisp answer. Thank you for that nice and</p>
<p>tight. Friedberg, who&rsquo;s your biggest political loser for</p>
<p>2022?</p>
<p>It was a tie for me between Jerome Powell, and Liz truss</p>
<p>Liz truss just has to get recognition here for only being</p>
<p>in office for 45 days as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that is cannot be overlooked. The some of the</p>
<p>policy and folks that she put in, in office, caused, you know,</p>
<p>massive chaos, it was just a clear dysfunction over a very</p>
<p>short period of time. Jerome Powell, I think this was a big</p>
<p>surprise this year, to see how the Fed Chair became so</p>
<p>politicized, and his role became so politicized, both kind of the</p>
<p>left and the right, finding reasons to question his</p>
<p>leadership, and his decision making the failure to raise</p>
<p>rates soon enough, led to massive inflation is what you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>hear from one contingent of politicians and the public at</p>
<p>large. And then the rate at which he&rsquo;s raising rates now to</p>
<p>catch up to the to calm inflation is causing people to</p>
<p>complain on the other side. So there is really no one that</p>
<p>seems to be happy with Jerome Powell. And I think that that</p>
<p>was a shooting star that seems to have completely lost its</p>
<p>luster.</p>
<p>Okay, so the Fed, yes, good pull there. Okay, mine is pretty</p>
<p>clear. And objectively, it is, of course, the GOP, the red wave</p>
<p>failed, it turned into a trickle. Trump is back. And I</p>
<p>believe there&rsquo;s a good chance he will win the primary Roe v.</p>
<p>Wade, a complete unmitigated disaster for Republicans, they</p>
<p>caught the car and plus marriage equality and having to deal with</p>
<p>that women and the LGBT community vote and they have</p>
<p>long memories, the GOP, the biggest political losers for me.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m sure sex has no rebuttal there. So we will move</p>
<p>on to the next category, which is,</p>
<p>by the way, if you say it that way, then you know, the biggest</p>
<p>political loser in 2022 were women look like fundamental</p>
<p>human rights were stripped away from 50% of the population. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not cool.</p>
<p>And they could have left it alone.</p>
<p>And they could have left it alone.</p>
<p>Well, if if what you mean is that the issue was sent to the</p>
<p>states and each state then gets to decide, then you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But but if you look at the battles have happened at the</p>
<p>states, even red states like Kentucky and Kansas have</p>
<p>rejected the subsequent political push to outlaw</p>
<p>abortion. So it has not turned out to be just by the fact that</p>
<p>all of these red states basically re confirmed and</p>
<p>enshrined a woman&rsquo;s right to choose may actually go more to</p>
<p>show that the Supreme Court is totally out of touch, and that</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t need to touch Roe v. Wade. And the fact that they</p>
<p>did opened up, you know, a huge can of worms in 50 states that</p>
<p>now go and need to go and adjudicate this thing, where it</p>
<p>looked like actually that decision, even back in the day,</p>
<p>even though the way that it was done, you know, there was a lot</p>
<p>of room for improvement, clearly, everybody agrees with</p>
<p>that, but was actually after, you know, 50 plus years</p>
<p>reasonable law. And so now that you took that law away, now</p>
<p>folks, even in the red states are like, No, it was fine. Which</p>
<p>means that this whole thing was a huge political gambit more</p>
<p>than it was actual societal intention.</p>
<p>Okay, so we are going to move on now I just I&rsquo;ll add my final two</p>
<p>cents to that. As I said, I do think women and the LGBT</p>
<p>community have very long memories and the people who are</p>
<p>in the moderate are not going to forget how they were treated by</p>
<p>the GOP in this specific issue. So biggest political surprise,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t do predictions last year. But I&rsquo;ll just run down</p>
<p>what everybody said was their political surprise. I said, the</p>
<p>fact that Kamala Harris was sidelined was pretty surprising</p>
<p>to me. And that&rsquo;s continued. Chamath, you said Joe Manchin</p>
<p>was your biggest political surprise. Glenn Youngkin</p>
<p>winning sacks that was your biggest surprise. And Friedberg</p>
<p>the January six crowd, making it into the Capitol during the</p>
<p>insurrection was your biggest political surprise. So here we</p>
<p>go. Our 2022 biggest political surprise. Saks, let&rsquo;s start with</p>
<p>you. You have a lot to say about politics. Go.</p>
<p>Well, the biggest political surprise to me was no red wave.</p>
<p>So I admit, I got this prediction wrong. You know, I</p>
<p>got all my previous ones, right, Jake House, I&rsquo;m gonna admit, I</p>
<p>got this one wrong. You know, I believe that the electorate would</p>
<p>focus on the fundamentals three quarters of the country thought</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on the wrong track. Three quarters think we&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>recession. Nevertheless, the Republicans did not do nearly as</p>
<p>well as predicted. They only gained nine seats in the House</p>
<p>actually lost a seat in the Senate. And I think that that</p>
<p>something to do with candidate quality. And of course, the</p>
<p>whole election denial narrative, basically was a disaster for</p>
<p>them. I hope that the Republicans move on and stop</p>
<p>talking about the past. What voters want to hear about is the</p>
<p>future.</p>
<p>Friedberg, did you have a biggest political surprise for</p>
<p>2022? Friedberg?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s also the failure of the red wave. I mean, that was</p>
<p>my, my pick. I think the consensus going into the</p>
<p>election was with, you know, rising inflation and the disdain</p>
<p>that everyone had for the way politicians kind of managed us</p>
<p>through COVID and then managed us through the economic</p>
<p>recovery. It&rsquo;s, it was inevitable to see a flip and it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t happen. I think obviously, we talked about why</p>
<p>that is, but that was a big surprise for everyone.</p>
<p>Chamath, what was your biggest political surprise of 2022?</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya?</p>
<p>The absolute toothlessness of MAGA and Donald Trump. I mean,</p>
<p>he was just a scarlet letter. If you were anywhere near this guy,</p>
<p>you were going to lose. And that&rsquo;s surprising, considering</p>
<p>how traditional Republicans were pandering to him, up until</p>
<p>frankly, just a few months ago. So I think that we exposed the</p>
<p>emperor of as having no clothes, and that he marginalizes and</p>
<p>sidelines candidates into a fringe following that cannot go</p>
<p>mainstream. That was a it was really surprising to see how</p>
<p>stark that was this year.</p>
<p>Fantastic. I&rsquo;m going to build on your Chamath. I had two here.</p>
<p>Number two was Roe v. Wade, but we&rsquo;ve beaten that. I think it</p>
<p>would just get us disgusted as much as we possibly could. My</p>
<p>number one, building on your Chamath is that despite what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened with Trump, the documents that the his cases in</p>
<p>the United States in New York, and about taxes, despite all of</p>
<p>this, the January 6 insurrection, despite all this,</p>
<p>Trump is still viable. I can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s still viable in</p>
<p>that he is going to be out there in the primaries, and he&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to have to debate DeSantis. And I don&rsquo;t know that DeSantis can</p>
<p>beat him in a debate. I think he might win. So this is completely</p>
<p>scary for both me and sacks. I think it&rsquo;s terrifying sacks his</p>
<p>nightmare and mine.</p>
<p>Well, I think he&rsquo;s mainly viable in the minds of the maggot</p>
<p>deadenders and the mainstream media who want to keep him</p>
<p>alive. And the Biden administration wants to keep him</p>
<p>alive, and they&rsquo;ll do anything to keep him alive and in the</p>
<p>news. And you love keeping him in the news. So it&rsquo;s a yes, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a codependent relationship between the mainstream media,</p>
<p>which you sometimes front for, and Trump.</p>
<p>Oh, be careful telling me what I need to end this codependency</p>
<p>J. Cal.</p>
<p>Well, I wish the Republican Party would finally take</p>
<p>ownership of this disaster that is Trump and tell him that he</p>
<p>has no business, but you guys keep him in the game. And the</p>
<p>fact that he&rsquo;s viable, again, your personal nightmare and</p>
<p>mine. Okay, biggest business winner, everybody excited to get</p>
<p>off politics right now and get to our kill zone, which is</p>
<p>business. So last year, we had predictions in this category. I</p>
<p>had said Disney, that&rsquo;s an up and down prediction. I&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>into that in a moment. Tremont, you said small and medium sized</p>
<p>businesses, the old SMBs. SAC said rise of the rest, the fly</p>
<p>over states. And Freeberg, you said stripe. Tremont, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>start with you SMBs. What did you get? Right? What did you get</p>
<p>wrong here?</p>
<p>I mean, I whiffed, it just completely missed the global</p>
<p>macro shift that we embarked on in full force. Starting in q1 of</p>
<p>this year, it was, it is the most important business story of</p>
<p>the year. It&rsquo;s just like we have an absolute complete regime</p>
<p>change. And by the way, that regime change is so complete,</p>
<p>and so, you know, thorough, that it even touched Japan just a few</p>
<p>weeks ago, or sorry, just a few days ago, where Japan who find,</p>
<p>you know, finally yielded on this idea of, you&rsquo;re gonna,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have negative interest rates and yield curve</p>
<p>control, even they finally broken it and raised rates. So it</p>
<p>is an absolute worldwide sea change in how we need to think</p>
<p>about risk. And I think that&rsquo;s worth talking about a little bit</p>
<p>later in the show. But that was the single biggest business</p>
<p>story of the</p>
<p>year. I&rsquo;ll add to what Tremont said, I missed this too, even</p>
<p>though on another prediction, when you asked what the biggest</p>
<p>business loser would be, I think I said that it would be</p>
<p>asset classes that have been pumped up by the feds money</p>
<p>printing, because you start to feel now. So I got that part</p>
<p>right. But what I didn&rsquo;t connect it to, were all the asset</p>
<p>classes actually got pummeled. So I kind of conceptually</p>
<p>understood that rates were rising, but I totally</p>
<p>underestimated the magnitude of the shift, the way that gross</p>
<p>stocks would get hammered the way that crypto would get</p>
<p>destroyed, the fact that like Tiger basically got blown out</p>
<p>of the industry. I mean, I had the right general intuition, but</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t translate it into the specific asset types and the</p>
<p>magnitude of the shift. And also the like what you must set a</p>
<p>real regime change now, and how markets are viewing stock</p>
<p>performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really incredible. Freeberg, let&rsquo;s get in on this.</p>
<p>This is somewhere where you can contribute deeply. What do you</p>
<p>think about your take last year, and you still believe in stripe?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a business that obviously</p>
<p>benefited greatly from the pandemic and the adoption of,</p>
<p>you know, the payment processing infrastructure that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>built across their across various kind of e commerce</p>
<p>platforms. It&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;m not an investor, so I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any numbers. But there are public reports that have</p>
<p>highlighted that the revenue increased 66%. This year,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve indicated that they&rsquo;re probably going to experience</p>
<p>significant revenue slowdown with the recession ahead. But it</p>
<p>still seems like a super high quality business. And you know,</p>
<p>valuation wise, who knows what things are going to be worth</p>
<p>when they ultimately come to market. There&rsquo;s certainly no</p>
<p>one going to going public right now. So at some point, we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>you know, whether valuations play out, but it seems like it</p>
<p>continues to be a very strong, one of the strongest private</p>
<p>businesses that&rsquo;s being built in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>We will get to 2022. biggest business winners in one second.</p>
<p>I will just say for Disney have man what a swing, Bob chapik in</p>
<p>and then out and now Bob Iger back. So I feel like I got this</p>
<p>one wrong and right. At the same time, I still believe in the</p>
<p>company deeply. I think they&rsquo;re gonna have a big win. Let&rsquo;s get</p>
<p>to our actual biggest winner of 2022. Sachs, why don&rsquo;t you lead</p>
<p>us off with your biggest winner of 2022 for business?</p>
<p>I said Lockheed Martin along with other defense stocks,</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin, which makes javelins and high Mars is up 40%</p>
<p>in the past year when most of the market&rsquo;s been way down.</p>
<p>Northrop Grumman is also up almost 40%. And even some of the</p>
<p>lesser performers like Raytheon and General Dynamics are up</p>
<p>about almost 20% in a terrible market environment. The fact of</p>
<p>the matter is war is terrible, but it appears to be good</p>
<p>business. We&rsquo;ve sent so many weapons to Ukraine, that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>recent press reports that are the US stockpiles of missiles,</p>
<p>javelins and stingers are now depleted. So these companies are</p>
<p>going to keep doing well for the next year, at least. Now there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a new appropriation sailing through something like 44</p>
<p>billion of new funding for the war. It&rsquo;s now over $100 billion.</p>
<p>McConnell says this is a republicans number one priority.</p>
<p>This is now a bipartisan concern. And if you think the</p>
<p>war is expensive, just wait for reconstruction that&rsquo;s estimated</p>
<p>to cost at roughly a trillion dollars to build Ukraine back</p>
<p>sex. Can I ask a question about that? Are these when we fund</p>
<p>these wars? I&rsquo;ve heard different versions of this can&rsquo;t get a</p>
<p>clear answer. When we provide weapons and systems like this,</p>
<p>are they not on account and we asked for money back at some</p>
<p>point? Do you know the answer to that question?</p>
<p>You think we&rsquo;re gonna get money back? Are you kidding me? It</p>
<p>seems to be sometimes that we do. So that&rsquo;s why I was asking. I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s something there hasn&rsquo;t been clarity on</p>
<p>look, I think the the war has been phenomenal business for the</p>
<p>military industrial complex. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re seeing here.</p>
<p>Not so great for the rest of the economy.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what do you got? Yeah, I mean, I think you guys will</p>
<p>remember last November, I predicted energy and defense to</p>
<p>be the best performing stocks for this year. sax is right. I</p>
<p>think defense is up 40%. So I kind of went with the bigger oil</p>
<p>and gas companies are up, you know, across the board about 47%</p>
<p>in terms of equity value in the public markets a year to date,</p>
<p>compared to the S&amp;P being down about 20%. So over the short</p>
<p>term, I would argue oil and gas companies, but I think that over</p>
<p>the long term, there were a couple of big breakthrough</p>
<p>moments that I would give kind of, you know, the winner in</p>
<p>business that will benefit over the long term to open AI and to</p>
<p>fusion startups. And we&rsquo;ll talk more about why for those two,</p>
<p>obviously later when we get to the biggest winner in tech and</p>
<p>science. But yeah, short term oil and gas, they benefited from</p>
<p>the supply constraints and the conflict in the Ukraine. And</p>
<p>then longer term, I think opening I infusion startups</p>
<p>well, and by the way, I mean, just just to give freebird some</p>
<p>credit here, you actually predicted the war, or you</p>
<p>predicted a war? I don&rsquo;t know if you predicted this war, but you</p>
<p>predicted</p>
<p>Yeah, I predicted the war and Putin kind of rising to the</p>
<p>center stage and the dog</p>
<p>that was a huge prediction, because I don&rsquo;t think most</p>
<p>people even most analysts, well, they were surprised even when</p>
<p>the invasion happened. I think people were still very surprised</p>
<p>both that Putin would order it. But also, if you say the</p>
<p>situation, I think you got to be surprised that we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>negotiate harder to try and prevent it.</p>
<p>I traded it too. I bought I bought an energy ETF. So it</p>
<p>worked out for me. Okay, Chamath, your biggest business</p>
<p>winner of 2022.</p>
<p>Nick can throw it up. But it&rsquo;s basically any single person that</p>
<p>understands the following formula. So if you this is the</p>
<p>good, this is the this is the capital asset pricing model. So</p>
<p>what is this? This is like before you make any investment,</p>
<p>what it actually tells you is here&rsquo;s the rate of return that</p>
<p>you need to generate above the risk free rate, in order for you</p>
<p>to justify making that investment. And if you really</p>
<p>understood the capital asset pricing model going into 2022,</p>
<p>it would have been difficult for you to not make money. Because</p>
<p>all of a sudden, as the 10 year flexed up, and as you know, the</p>
<p>volatility, particularly of things like tech stocks, went</p>
<p>crazy, you could have figured out where you to park your</p>
<p>money. And all these people that have built businesses</p>
<p>around this capital asset pricing model. So you have</p>
<p>companies, obviously, so you know, you have sectors of the</p>
<p>economy, like defense or energy stocks, consumer goods and</p>
<p>staples, they all had moments where they all did well. But if</p>
<p>you take it one step above the organizations that actually ran</p>
<p>big macro books, or really understood how to algorithmically</p>
<p>implement this capital asset pricing model just ran rough</p>
<p>shot over the markets. And, you know, said in a different way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of my background, which is, you know, if you</p>
<p>understood the capital asset pricing model, you would have</p>
<p>been a massive bear. And the bear got fed this year to a</p>
<p>degree that none of us could have anticipated.</p>
<p>Okay, so am I correct saying the capital asset pricing model is</p>
<p>the biggest winner?</p>
<p>Or no people that understood it.</p>
<p>People that understood it. Got it. Okay. And for my biggest</p>
<p>winner, I went with chat GPT slash open AI and their partner</p>
<p>Microsoft. Why did I pick that as the biggest winner? Well, on</p>
<p>my other podcast this week in startups, we played a game chat</p>
<p>GPT versus the first result of Google&rsquo;s. And Molly and I could</p>
<p>not tell the difference. And in fact, we picked chat GPT is</p>
<p>answers. Often above Google&rsquo;s Google, one of the greatest</p>
<p>businesses and franchises ever created, has no answer at</p>
<p>currently for chat GPT. Because Google&rsquo;s business model is to</p>
<p>get you to click on an ad between links. If you give the</p>
<p>actual answer, then the person doesn&rsquo;t stops clicking. If they</p>
<p>stop clicking, Google stops making money, there is no</p>
<p>business model in search, if the person gets their answer,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re done. This is an existential threat like we have</p>
<p>not seen. And our friend Sam Altman has a line chat GPT</p>
<p>slash open AI with Microsoft. Microsoft, I think is going to</p>
<p>release a and there&rsquo;s a prediction as well, a search</p>
<p>engine with open AI that has a significant impact on Google&rsquo;s</p>
<p>franchise. We didn&rsquo;t think this would ever happen. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here. Okay, the biggest losers in business. We made predictions</p>
<p>last year. I said in 2020, I predicted in 2021, the biggest</p>
<p>loser in 2022 would be crypto. By the way, Friedberg, you</p>
<p>agreed with me. And we nailed it. You agreed with me? Well,</p>
<p>yes, that&rsquo;s correct. We were in agreement. How about that? We</p>
<p>were in. We were in agreement. Independent. You said, and</p>
<p>Chamath visa slash MasterCard, we&rsquo;ll get into that. And sacks,</p>
<p>you said asset classes benefiting from government</p>
<p>pumps. Very interesting. The Fed stopping QE. Interesting.</p>
<p>Anybody have comments on their predictions or each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>predictions from last year?</p>
<p>On a percentage basis? David absolutely nailed it. sacks</p>
<p>absolutely nailed it. On a dollar basis, the biggest</p>
<p>business loser of this year was big tech. And I think that you</p>
<p>saw three things happen, which I think are important for the</p>
<p>future. The first was it was the most crowded trade, both by</p>
<p>professional money managers as well as retail. And that fever</p>
<p>finally broke in the last half of in the second half of this</p>
<p>year. And now going into, into these last few weeks, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing a lot of panicked selling to cover losses and other</p>
<p>things. So I think that number one, that happened. Number two,</p>
<p>regulators basically said we&rsquo;re going to go after these guys</p>
<p>every single which way we can. And then number three, I think</p>
<p>it started to change the innovation cycle where people</p>
<p>now actually believe that they can&rsquo;t outspend because folks</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t tolerate it. And the things that they&rsquo;re spending</p>
<p>their money on seem kind of foolish. And so I think the, you</p>
<p>know, big tech is probably not discussed enough, but it was a</p>
<p>huge loser for this year, in terms of what happened to them.</p>
<p>2022 is actual biggest business loser. Chamath says big tech,</p>
<p>Freeberg, who is your biggest business loser for 2022?</p>
<p>I mean, this one&rsquo;s just a simple FTX. I mean, that was such a</p>
<p>incredible revelation of the scale of the scam and the fraud</p>
<p>and the craziness that went on. And I think what was interesting</p>
<p>about FTX is it had implications, not just for</p>
<p>crypto, and not just for kind of offshore regulatory and not just</p>
<p>for fraud, but also for the investors, we had a whole debate</p>
<p>about whether the press and journalists failed to kind of,</p>
<p>you know, appropriately investigate this guy rather than</p>
<p>give him accolades, because he said the right things, which he</p>
<p>said he did over I am. And investors fail to do relevant</p>
<p>amounts of due diligence or form a board and have proper</p>
<p>governance over him, because they wanted to be part of the hot</p>
<p>new thing and everyone had capital to deploy. And I think</p>
<p>what was interesting about the FTX failure is it didn&rsquo;t just it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t just a failure due to fraud, but it revealed so many</p>
<p>parts of kind of, you know, I call it, you know, systemic</p>
<p>laziness and systemic kind of blind eye and systemic bias that</p>
<p>allowed and enabled this to happen. It was really a</p>
<p>revealing kind of failure. And that&rsquo;s why I kind of gave it the</p>
<p>the award, Mr. David Sachs, who is your biggest business loser</p>
<p>of 2022?</p>
<p>Well, you kind of mentioned this, I picked Bob J. Peck is</p>
<p>the former Disney CEO, he was eigers handpicked successor three</p>
<p>years ago, then the pandemic hit, which shut down the theme</p>
<p>parks. But then I think the big mistake was allowing himself to</p>
<p>be Mao Mao by woke employees into picking a fight with</p>
<p>DeSantis over the so called don&rsquo;t say gay bill. That caused</p>
<p>DeSantis to retaliate by threatening the special</p>
<p>privileges that Disney enjoys in the state. And then he had</p>
<p>eiger undermining him behind the scenes, this was revealed, I</p>
<p>think, as a Wall Street Journal story, that he was grousing to</p>
<p>insiders that JPEG was not soliciting his advice. And he</p>
<p>was undermining confidence in with the board. And recently,</p>
<p>JPEG was forced out and I was put back in charge.</p>
<p>Fantastic choice for the biggest loser.</p>
<p>How brutal does eiger look in that Wall Street Journal piece?</p>
<p>I mean, would anybody work for him?</p>
<p>Yes, he is incredible. He looks terrible. I agree. I read that</p>
<p>piece twice, actually. The CFO calling him up, she was the one</p>
<p>who stabbed him, you know, in knife JPEG. It&rsquo;s a great wall.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that I don&rsquo;t think that that happens without</p>
<p>the support of the person waiting in the wings.</p>
<p>Hey, listen, there&rsquo;s a couple of jobs, you never quit. You never</p>
<p>quit a hit TV show. You never quit a hit band like Roger</p>
<p>Wattard is with Pink Floyd.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t they just extend this</p>
<p>for the Disney job? It&rsquo;s the best job as a job in the world.</p>
<p>But Jason, why go through this? Why go through the theatrics of</p>
<p>like grooming somebody putting them in your job and then</p>
<p>undermining them? Like I all I&rsquo;m saying is if you&rsquo;re I think he</p>
<p>made a mistake. I think he made a mistake. He quit and he wanted</p>
<p>and also if like if you&rsquo;re a good up and coming exec. I mean,</p>
<p>what do you do if like all of a sudden, like, you know, you have</p>
<p>the opportunity to get groomed for that job. It just seems</p>
<p>really risky.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think Bob Iger realized when he in that piece,</p>
<p>they say he went on his yacht, his wife didn&rsquo;t come with him.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal piece is incredible. And he&rsquo;s got bored.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s 70 something years old. He&rsquo;s like an early 70s. Why</p>
<p>would you give up the greatest job in the world? So he went</p>
<p>back and he took it back.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t Disney have a mandatory retirement age?</p>
<p>But this is my point is he was so he was so prolific, he could</p>
<p>have extended it. Why not just extend it and be done with it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you guys read the book he wrote? That ride of a lifetime?</p>
<p>What is it? Yeah. And I think that what was interesting about</p>
<p>that book was the entire thing was built around a series of</p>
<p>deals that he did. It was like I did this acquisition, then I did</p>
<p>this acquisition, then I did this acquisition. And</p>
<p>everything for him was building this this this empire by doing</p>
<p>deals. And someone whose storyline and narrative that</p>
<p>they tell of themselves, that&rsquo;s built as a series of deals is a</p>
<p>deal junkie. And you&rsquo;re not going to be a deal junkie, where</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s your excitement. That&rsquo;s the thrill. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>adventure that you get out of life. And then you go and sit on</p>
<p>a yacht, you&rsquo;re not doing any deal sitting on a yacht. And</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to get back to that. And I think it&rsquo;s less</p>
<p>about kind of management and product. And it was much more</p>
<p>about being in the midst of doing deals. And that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>why I came back.</p>
<p>If this was part of Iger&rsquo;s diabolical strategy to get back,</p>
<p>let me just say, like, one of the ways he did it, I mean,</p>
<p>Chapek had the right instincts, which is when this whole</p>
<p>Florida debate happened over don&rsquo;t say gay, highly</p>
<p>contentious, no comment. No comment, his instinct was just</p>
<p>to stay out of it. But then Iger made some statements about how</p>
<p>companies have to live up to their values and that kind of</p>
<p>stuff. And then the employee started, you know, again, you</p>
<p>know, Mau Mau him to get involved. And he took the bait.</p>
<p>And he got involved. And what he didn&rsquo;t expect is that DeSantis</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t going to just roll over. DeSantis hit him back really</p>
<p>hard. And it cost them economically. And then</p>
<p>and in the first interview that Iger gave when asked about this</p>
<p>question, he was like, no comment.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re not gonna get involved in politics</p>
<p>anymore. We&rsquo;re not gonna get involved in politics anymore. It</p>
<p>was hilarious. That wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>nuts, JPEG to basically get involved in politics. And then</p>
<p>JPEG basically became cannon fodder for DeSantis. Exactly.</p>
<p>And then I was like, Oh, we&rsquo;re out of this now. I mean, how</p>
<p>diabolical is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so diabolical, so dirty. The other two were cheap. It</p>
<p>said, we&rsquo;re going to take away your PNLs to each of the</p>
<p>leaders that is like just neutering them that he basically</p>
<p>said, everybody&rsquo;s under the CFO, everybody&rsquo;s going to be on one</p>
<p>PNL. That infuriated all the creatives. And then he went to</p>
<p>war with Scarlett Johansson over a $10 million settlement for her</p>
<p>black widow. He couldn&rsquo;t handle talent. He couldn&rsquo;t handle the</p>
<p>politics. And he wanted to control everybody&rsquo;s PNL just</p>
<p>unforced error after unforced error. Congratulations to my guy</p>
<p>Bob Iger, I own the stock.</p>
<p>Do you think he was diabolical at all?</p>
<p>Oh, in the best possible way. In the best possible way, which</p>
<p>means that Disney stock is going to go up. Yes, I&rsquo;m buying more</p>
<p>Disney stock this year.</p>
<p>Is all the woke progressive politics that he projects? Is</p>
<p>that all just a game to mask what a viper&rsquo;s nest their</p>
<p>executive suite really is?</p>
<p>Are you telling me that Disney is a political corporation after</p>
<p>Eisner and Bob Iger and all of his Michael Ovitz? I mean, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the history of Disney. It&rsquo;s the greatest job in the world. It is</p>
<p>Game of Thrones to get that job. And Bob Iger got it back. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my guy. I&rsquo;m sticking with them. Okay, they have the best IP in</p>
<p>the business. I don&rsquo;t care how he gets that job back. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome.</p>
<p>I gotta say the IP at Warner Media is a real strong</p>
<p>contender. I mean, that white Lotus we were talking about</p>
<p>this yesterday, how good white Lotus season two was. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>open up the discussion. It is incredible how HBO produces</p>
<p>extraordinary hit after extraordinary hit. The quality</p>
<p>and the consistency of that quality coming out of HBO is</p>
<p>like nothing else. You&rsquo;ll go I mean, look, Avatar two, I did</p>
<p>not like Avatar one, I thought it was junk. Avatar two is</p>
<p>getting panned for being junk as well. Not everything that comes</p>
<p>out of Disney is a hit. They certainly have the best</p>
<p>franchises. But man, Warner Media has a lot to contend with</p>
<p>and you know, they could end up being a real challenger to</p>
<p>Disney in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Saks Did you watch the white Lotus season two? Yes or no?</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t gotten me. No problem. It is absolutely</p>
<p>fantastic. We have to do a little fan service here. What</p>
<p>did you love Chamath about white Lotus season two? Give the fans</p>
<p>a little service here.</p>
<p>Wait, it&rsquo;s on season two. I didn&rsquo;t even see season one. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know what you guys are talking about.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s the hottest show in television.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s incredible is there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>diversity of characters and they weave the super like, you know,</p>
<p>interesting story together. But each of the characters are so</p>
<p>distinct. And the characters are played so well. I mean, we were</p>
<p>talking about, you know, we were kind of at dinner last</p>
<p>night talking about who our favorite character was on the</p>
<p>show. And everyone has a different answer. And everyone</p>
<p>has a different reason. And then there are characters that you</p>
<p>hate. But the fact that you hate them, and the fact that you</p>
<p>despise them draws you in you&rsquo;re drawn into these characters. I</p>
<p>think that the the way that they kind of portrayed and the way</p>
<p>that the characters were acted by the by the actors, and then</p>
<p>the way that they all kind of weave together to tell this</p>
<p>extraordinary story. It was really, it was really compelling.</p>
<p>And it was like, just super impressive. Directing, acting,</p>
<p>writing everything.</p>
<p>There are a handful of scenes in season one, and season two,</p>
<p>which I would say are unbelievably psychologically</p>
<p>violent. And there&rsquo;s just no other way to describe like, how</p>
<p>they just expose and by the way, they do it with simple shots,</p>
<p>very simple dialogue, it&rsquo;s almost nonchalant in the way</p>
<p>that they present these truth bombs. And you have to sit there</p>
<p>and process it. And you&rsquo;re just like, Oh my god, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wave after wave. It&rsquo;s an incredible, incredibly well</p>
<p>written show.</p>
<p>The character development is extraordinary.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Production and set design, by the way. Also, I mean, when you</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t you want it, you want to cool it. You want to go</p>
<p>to those locations.</p>
<p>Do you guys remember in season one, Saks will remember this</p>
<p>because Saks watched it season one, the family is sitting at</p>
<p>the table where they&rsquo;re watching the Hawaiian dance. And</p>
<p>Paula, the guest of the family gets up and leave, she can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take it anymore. And then the next day, they&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>discussion about it. And the father says something about, I</p>
<p>think, hierarchy or imperialism or something. And it goes around</p>
<p>the table, and she just deadpan. She says, Well, maybe it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>time for others to eat. Talking about, you know, like fixing</p>
<p>these wrongs. And I had to listen to it two or three times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Oh, my God, that is that is a line that just sticks</p>
<p>in your brain. There&rsquo;s a few of those in that show that I think</p>
<p>Eric said, and I was saying, like, they really draw you in.</p>
<p>The set design, the production design is so compelling. You</p>
<p>want to be there, you want to be in that experience with those</p>
<p>characters.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re totally drawn to the pineapple suite. I mean, and</p>
<p>then in this season, that whole hotel, I looked up the hotel, by</p>
<p>the way, online, they hadn&rsquo;t, you know, their their own set</p>
<p>design, people come in and redo the hotel, but it is an actual</p>
<p>hotel. It&rsquo;s a real, they just made it so magical. Yeah, it was</p>
<p>such an incredible,</p>
<p>Oh, free book, we should make that the host of the All in</p>
<p>Summit 2023. I&rsquo;m working on my Jennifer Coolidge.</p>
<p>Tell your director, David Sachs, what you&rsquo;d like to do for you.</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<p>my biggest loser was crypto. And I think there&rsquo;ll be a</p>
<p>subsequent domino to fall, which is now that Gary G, head of the</p>
<p>SEC has FT x and the FTT tokens as the grift, he&rsquo;s going to go</p>
<p>down the list of other tokens. And he is going to start doing</p>
<p>more prosecutions of grifts in crypto biggest loser for me.</p>
<p>All right, biggest business surprise. Let&rsquo;s see if we can</p>
<p>get sacks back engaged in the conversation now that we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>talking about art and life. sacks. Last year, your biggest</p>
<p>business surprise,</p>
<p>sacks just produced a movie about Dolly. I know he is. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>joking with him. He&rsquo;s a true artist. And he sold it to Mark</p>
<p>Cuban. Congratulations on the sale. David, I guess me and</p>
<p>Cuban are besties now. Fantastic. In 2021. Our</p>
<p>selections for business biggest business surprises. I was very</p>
<p>surprised by Dow&rsquo;s Chamath by Moderna. sacks by tech moving to</p>
<p>Miami and Friedberg. You were surprised by NF T&rsquo;s. What were</p>
<p>we surprised by in 2022? Friedberg, we&rsquo;ll start with you</p>
<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s acquisition of Twitter, I think took everyone by</p>
<p>surprise. It kind of went I mean, this is such an obvious</p>
<p>one, but it went from a whimsical fantasy and idea to</p>
<p>suddenly, you know, cold hearted reality with, you know, a huge</p>
<p>kind of negotiating saga that took place and court battles and</p>
<p>all the drama that ensued. And here&rsquo;s what I think was most</p>
<p>surprising about it. It wasn&rsquo;t just the acquisition and the and</p>
<p>the fact that the acquisition closed, but it was the the</p>
<p>incredible veracity of the head cutting, cost cutting the</p>
<p>demands that people return to work return to the office. And</p>
<p>then what was most surprising that followed that is the impact</p>
<p>that that seems to have had on the rest of Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>where now nearly every VC I speak with every CEO, every</p>
<p>board is looking to Elon&rsquo;s behavior for right or for wrong</p>
<p>for you know, moral, moral or not. And saying that&rsquo;s a model</p>
<p>for how you can challenge your team to achieve the impossible</p>
<p>in an impossibly difficult environment, which is what we</p>
<p>find ourselves in. And so I think it was a series of</p>
<p>surprising events. He bought Twitter, he made these</p>
<p>incredible changes, and then everyone seems to be looking to</p>
<p>that as a model. And it&rsquo;s really resonated, it&rsquo;s created a</p>
<p>rippling effect. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bad. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s moral right or wrong. But the whole</p>
<p>thing was really an incredible, surprising, unexpected saga this</p>
<p>year. So I give the Elon acquisition of Twitter kind of</p>
<p>the award.</p>
<p>Chamath, do you have a biggest surprise?</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s Jerome Powell and the Fed and their staunch</p>
<p>hawkishness on inflation. I think everybody wants all of</p>
<p>this to be over. And I think we&rsquo;re definitely in the last few</p>
<p>innings of it. But I think what was surprising was how</p>
<p>consistent and how hawkish and how bearish Jerome Powell was</p>
<p>every chance he got. He didn&rsquo;t capitulate or waiver from the</p>
<p>key message, which he was saying from the beginning, which</p>
<p>is, we have the tools to fix a broken economy. But we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the tools to fix runaway inflation. And so we will raise</p>
<p>rates higher than anyone expects and keep them there longer than</p>
<p>anybody wants. Because on the back end of it, we can fix a few</p>
<p>broken bones. But if left unchecked, this could really do</p>
<p>a lot of damage. And I think that that was an enormous</p>
<p>surprise that all the political pressure in the world, all of</p>
<p>the financial capital markets pressure in the world, did</p>
<p>nothing to change his position. Sachs, what was your biggest</p>
<p>business surprise of 2022? David Sachs biggest?</p>
<p>Well, it was it was a pretty big surprise that Adobe bought</p>
<p>Figma for 20 billion. That price tag in this environment, pretty</p>
<p>big surprise. But I got to say, I think Freeberg nailed it. Got</p>
<p>to say that the business saga of the year was Elon buying Twitter.</p>
<p>First, liberal media was up in arms that he might do it, then</p>
<p>they insisted that he must complete the deal. In any event,</p>
<p>he he did ultimately buy the company. Now he&rsquo;s affecting his</p>
<p>changes. I agree. That&rsquo;s the big business story of this year.</p>
<p>Certainly was a big surprise for me that I got deposition for</p>
<p>six hours.</p>
<p>Is it a surprise that you&rsquo;re sitting in Twitter&rsquo;s headquarters</p>
<p>today right now?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a surprise. But just by the way, the rumors and</p>
<p>speculation are getting out of hand. I am not a candidate for</p>
<p>CEO of Twitter. So I want to put the kibosh on that because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>starting to get out of hand.</p>
<p>J Cal, the job is yours, my friend. Congratulations. All</p>
<p>right, I guess. Let me know when I start. Okay, you&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>hard.</p>
<p>J Cal the last man standing last man standing outwit outlast.</p>
<p>Now that Saks has said he is not taking the job a bunch of libs</p>
<p>have just stopped taking Xanax. The libs biggest fear was Saks</p>
<p>was gonna get that job. We just canceled a bunch of Xanax</p>
<p>prescriptions. Congratulations to the libs. Saks is not going</p>
<p>to be your overlord on Twitter. For me. It&rsquo;s obvious. The</p>
<p>Twitter acquisition is the biggest surprise by far and away.</p>
<p>Freeberg I couldn&rsquo;t summarize it better. I will say in six</p>
<p>weeks, what we have seen there is nothing short of</p>
<p>extraordinary. Have there been bumps in the road? Has it been a</p>
<p>little chaotic at times perhaps, but the features that are coming</p>
<p>fast and furious are going to be the story going forward. You&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen Twitter for business. Saks had his fingerprints, all that</p>
<p>you may fingerprints all over that. You may have seen hashtags</p>
<p>for stock tickers. I was briefly involved in that. There are</p>
<p>going to be so many features coming. And this is what Elon</p>
<p>zone of excellence is product. He is an engineer. He&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>product genius. The proof is in the pudding, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rocket ships or the cars, we&rsquo;re going to see a parade of</p>
<p>features. I predict in another six to 18 weeks, we will see</p>
<p>people talking about all the great features in Twitter, not</p>
<p>any of the transitional issues and people will be shocked my</p>
<p>runner up metastock collapsing. That was my runner up for the</p>
<p>biggest business shock is that they just absolutely collapsed.</p>
<p>I was just gonna add to what you&rsquo;re saying about new features</p>
<p>launching while we&rsquo;ve been sitting here on this pod and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been checking my Twitter feed. There&rsquo;s a new feature where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a view count on all of your tweets and all of everybody</p>
<p>else&rsquo;s tweets as well. So you can see how many views a tweet</p>
<p>is generating. So this tweet that I posted yesterday has 1.5</p>
<p>million views. It&rsquo;s like incredible. So it really shows</p>
<p>the incredible reach of Twitter. And anybody who&rsquo;s thinking about</p>
<p>going to like some knockoff like Macedon or something is gonna</p>
<p>have to contend with the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t have nearly the</p>
<p>distribution. So I think this really shows the power of</p>
<p>Twitter. And then Dave Rubin noticed my I tweeted this just a</p>
<p>second ago. And Dave Rubin noted that the New York Times doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have anywhere near the views for its tweets, because they bought</p>
<p>all their followers, which is interesting. I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>But I just went over to the New York Times profile and my tweets</p>
<p>are routinely getting 10 to 20 times more reach more views than</p>
<p>theirs. So this is a super interesting indicator of who</p>
<p>actually people are paying attention to on Twitter. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating.</p>
<p>This is fascinating. I&rsquo;m looking at my own I just did how do you</p>
<p>give a $30 billion fraud bail, referring to SPF. And that was</p>
<p>just less than an hour ago. No, it&rsquo;s 30 minutes. Yeah, an hour</p>
<p>ago. And I have 50,000 views already, which is 10% of my</p>
<p>follower count. So this is an extraordinary you see right next</p>
<p>to likes retweets, quote tweets, the feature train is</p>
<p>coming. And this will change the dialogue all these haters who</p>
<p>are like Twitter is going to go down who are rooting against</p>
<p>Elon. Let me tell you something, if a guy can land two rockets at</p>
<p>a time, and he can literally restart the electric car</p>
<p>movement, and he becomes the number one car in any category,</p>
<p>he releases a car and how on earth would you bet against him</p>
<p>to build software, you have to be idiotic.</p>
<p>This is way too much. I mean, you guys like we should sorry,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing the awards. I get it. It&rsquo;s like an ad. Yeah, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>selling a partner for a company that you guys are working at.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, come on, I&rsquo;m not working. Well, you guys are</p>
<p>advisors, right? I mean, Nick, can you let me show another</p>
<p>feature? So I think it&rsquo;s cool. Nick. Let&rsquo;s go. Yeah, keep on</p>
<p>featuring. Let&rsquo;s go pull up my profile real quick. Welcome to</p>
<p>this week in Twitter. Oh, my god. Twitter now has affiliate</p>
<p>badges. You can see I&rsquo;ve got a little craft ventures badge next</p>
<p>to my name. So if you, you should be able to click on it</p>
<p>actually, to get to the craft ventures profile. Yeah. So</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to affiliate users with business</p>
<p>accounts. And it creates kind of secondary badges after the blue</p>
<p>check. I think even the corporate journalists are going</p>
<p>to love this because if you&rsquo;re a New York Times writer, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have a little NYT badge next to your name, Wall Street Journal,</p>
<p>whatever, you&rsquo;ll have that little badge. So more and more</p>
<p>people are going to get blue checks, and then people are</p>
<p>going to have secondary or even tertiary badges that are</p>
<p>basically specific to their affiliations. Okay, so I think</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make sure we get let&rsquo;s get an all in bad. We are going to</p>
<p>have all in badges really soon. Awesome. Okay, let&rsquo;s go for</p>
<p>free work free works. That was our biggest business surprises.</p>
<p>And we just canceled your account freeberg. It&rsquo;s locked</p>
<p>out. We just took away. No one goes to it. Anyway, it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>good. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Okay, best science breakthrough</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an easy one for us to do. 2022 biggest science</p>
<p>breakthrough. What have you got? Sultan of science we core of</p>
<p>course, I have to start with your 22 biggest science</p>
<p>breakthrough freeberg.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna give it obviously to the the</p>
<p>demonstration of net energy gain from the National Ignition</p>
<p>Facility in plasma fusion that we talked about last week. I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t call it a breakthrough. By the way, I think we use that</p>
<p>as a misnomer last week, but I&rsquo;m still gonna put it in this</p>
<p>category. It&rsquo;s more of a milestone along a very long</p>
<p>path, a very arduous path of very difficult work that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>taking decades. So it&rsquo;s a great milestone. But I think what was</p>
<p>so important and impactful and powerful about it is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really catalyzed to change a sea change in the investing in the</p>
<p>outlook that this is becoming more reality. As I mentioned</p>
<p>last week, we&rsquo;ve seen an increase of nearly 40% in the</p>
<p>number of fusion startups, and the amount of capital that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>flowing in is now reaching 10 billion a year. So this is</p>
<p>becoming you know, a real investable or an area that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting real investment. Some people might not think it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>investable. But that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s been an important</p>
<p>year for fusion. And I think, you know, it&rsquo;s something I</p>
<p>highlighted last year, I was excited about</p>
<p>and I to pick fusion. Also, just point of clarity last week,</p>
<p>some people Chamath before you go to your prediction, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying, hey, you&rsquo;re talking your book on solar when you were in</p>
<p>your disagreement with Friedberg. That&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been very upfront that you&rsquo;re investing in solar, you</p>
<p>placed your bet.</p>
<p>Yeah, 100%.</p>
<p>Yeah. So just to</p>
<p>everybody knows he made that bet. He&rsquo;s talked about it</p>
<p>incessantly.</p>
<p>Plus, those idiots that were saying that are stupid. But</p>
<p>yes, let me, let me further clarify what I said last week</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s important. If Nick, can you bring up the capital</p>
<p>asset pricing model again, the most important thing for me is</p>
<p>to make sure that we don&rsquo;t misallocate human capital into</p>
<p>endeavors that I think are best left for research institutions</p>
<p>funded by the government. And I think when you look at a capital</p>
<p>asset pricing model and try to build one out for fusion, as an</p>
<p>example, the expected rate of return that you need to get from</p>
<p>this is just astronomically high, because of the beta of</p>
<p>that investment risk, and the market risk premium you have to</p>
<p>generate. And so, you know, from my perspective, I think that</p>
<p>there are probably four or five labs in the world that are</p>
<p>capable of actually getting us to a positive energy equation. I</p>
<p>think Friedberg, I really thank you for actually saying that it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t a breakthrough and more of a milestone. I think the real</p>
<p>breakthrough is when we have positive, not just joules, but</p>
<p>we actually convert that into electrical energy, right. And we</p>
<p>actually talk about power and watts. And I think that most</p>
<p>people listening probably don&rsquo;t even understand the difference</p>
<p>between joules and watts or don&rsquo;t even care. And they want</p>
<p>to jump around here or there. So the point is that there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>enormous path we need to take in physics. And I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>best done in governments. And I don&rsquo;t want to see a bunch of</p>
<p>billions of dollars get wasted to get to to get marginal cost</p>
<p>of energy to zero right now, I think there is a point in time</p>
<p>where private startups can take the last 20 or 30%. But I think</p>
<p>about this, like the internet, which is you need a DARPA to</p>
<p>build v one. And then it could be handed over to private</p>
<p>industry. And I think fusion, when we look back, will look</p>
<p>very similar. And all the folks that try to build, you know,</p>
<p>versions of the internet that were private, I think found</p>
<p>themselves lagging, because there&rsquo;s just a level of</p>
<p>investment that&rsquo;s required, that&rsquo;s best served in</p>
<p>government. So anyways, that&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s clarify that for all the</p>
<p>folks who got their panties in a bunch of dudes. But in any</p>
<p>event, my science breakthrough of the year is that there was a</p>
<p>13 year old girl, this was, you know, because of all of this</p>
<p>fusion stuff, actually, we didn&rsquo;t even get to cover it</p>
<p>because it happened in the same week. And I think this is</p>
<p>infinitely more impressive and is an actual breakthrough, which</p>
<p>is a 13 year old girl in the United Kingdom, who had a</p>
<p>heretofore, uncurable form of leukemia, T cell acute</p>
<p>lymphoblastic leukemia. So typically, you start in</p>
<p>chemotherapy. If chemotherapy doesn&rsquo;t work, you move to bone</p>
<p>marrow transplants. And it was uncurable. And a lab in the UK,</p>
<p>basically using CRISPR edited these transplant T cells to go</p>
<p>in and wipe out her cancer. And now her cancer is literally</p>
<p>undetectable. Now, if you bring up that capital asset pricing</p>
<p>model, again, Nick, what I&rsquo;ll tell you is, the rate of return</p>
<p>on a human life, in my opinion, is infinite. And so here is an</p>
<p>unbelievable breakthrough that got very little attention</p>
<p>because everybody was wrapped around the axle of fusion. It</p>
<p>happened in the same week. So maybe it&rsquo;s understandable, I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t understand it. But I think this is the single most</p>
<p>important thing that happened in science, not just this year, but</p>
<p>frankly, in the last decade, because if you can actually now</p>
<p>do base editing, and eradicate, at least in this case, a blood</p>
<p>based cancer, and eventually we&rsquo;ll be able to bring that and</p>
<p>use that towards solid state tumor cancers. It&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>breakthrough in just human longevity and human quality of</p>
<p>life. And that happened just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Okay. And of course, for David Sacks, his biggest science</p>
<p>breakthrough is I don&rsquo;t care. So moving on. Go ahead, tell us.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, this category reminds me of when Biden had that</p>
<p>moment where he&rsquo;s like, America can be defined in a single word.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s kind of how I feel about this category.</p>
<p>America is a nation that can be defined in a single word. I was</p>
<p>gonna foot him. Excuse me.</p>
<p>Amazing how you figured out a way to be derogatory about Biden</p>
<p>in the science section. A new low even for you, sacks. Oh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good one. Thanks. I like it. All right, biggest flash in</p>
<p>the pan. 2021. This is what we said were the biggest flash in</p>
<p>the pan. I said the woke socialist leadership of cities</p>
<p>i.e. Chesa Boudin. freeberg said the Constitution down. sack</p>
<p>said the word transitory very well played. And Shemot said the</p>
<p>metaverse also very well played. Everybody that</p>
<p>very good. Everybody get your flowers. Enjoy all of those seem</p>
<p>like pretty good selections. But this year is what everybody</p>
<p>wants to hear about. freeberg. Tell us now who is your 2022</p>
<p>biggest flash in the pan, the undisputable who we got biggest</p>
<p>flash in the pan of 2022 was the all in summit. Oh, man, it</p>
<p>went. That will always be a strong and significant memory.</p>
<p>It was such a hot thing for a minute. And then it died. So to</p>
<p>the all in summit, I went out my glass, I pour one out. I toast</p>
<p>to you to Miami. And unless David Sachs carries it from</p>
<p>here. It was a flash in the pan. It was a flash in the pan.</p>
<p>sacks, who&rsquo;s your flash? Which democrat is a flash in the pan</p>
<p>for you?</p>
<p>This is where I had Liz truss. As you guys mentioned, she only</p>
<p>survived 44 days as PM. I mean, that&rsquo;s only for scaramoochies.</p>
<p>She was basically fired by the bond markets after she combined</p>
<p>a Thatcher s tax cut with massive energy subsidies to</p>
<p>counter the price spikes caused by the war in Ukraine that she</p>
<p>was fanatically committed to. This was deemed untenable by the</p>
<p>UK Central Bank, it crashed the pound. And I think there is a</p>
<p>serious point here, which is that as much as Thatcher and</p>
<p>Reagan were the two towering heroic figures of the 1980s, I</p>
<p>think zombie Thatcherism is not going to be electorally viable</p>
<p>in the UK, just like zombie Reaganism is not going to be</p>
<p>viable in the United States. I think that the conservative</p>
<p>movement has to stop living in the past, we have to develop</p>
<p>fresh ideas to meet the economic and foreign policy challenges</p>
<p>of today.</p>
<p>Chamath, do you have a flash in the pan?</p>
<p>I actually think fusion literally was a flash in the pan.</p>
<p>It was it lasted 10 to the negative 10 seconds. So that</p>
<p>more less of a flash you can&rsquo;t have without being a flash in</p>
<p>the pan.</p>
<p>Ah, they haven&rsquo;t. Hey,</p>
<p>Saks, look who&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>Oh, look.</p>
<p>Oh, is it the proprietor?</p>
<p>The proprietor, the owner</p>
<p>for our customer support at your service.</p>
<p>Saks, you spent the last 15 minutes selling your new</p>
<p>features on the podcast. Pretty exciting.</p>
<p>Well, the like the views are like incredible. Yeah. I mean,</p>
<p>and I saw Dave Rubin already made an observation that if you</p>
<p>look at New York Times, their views are maybe one 10th like my</p>
<p>views, just me as a lone tweeter. And he said that their</p>
<p>followers are inflated by just basically buying a bunch of</p>
<p>follower accounts.</p>
<p>Yeah, the views thing is huge. That&rsquo;s why I pushed the views,</p>
<p>which is like actually a lot harder feature to implement than</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d think because the sheer number of transactions per</p>
<p>second like it&rsquo;s, I think it sort of requires system wide on</p>
<p>the order of three, 3 million transactions a second to</p>
<p>actually calculate the view to, you know, calculate and display</p>
<p>the view count. If I put Twitter, Twitter global, so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like 3 million per second. It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>For those of you listening, Elon Musk has had joined the</p>
<p>pod. Elon, how&rsquo;s, how&rsquo;s the first six weeks been generally</p>
<p>speaking of owning Twitter?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been quite a roller coaster, which obviously you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>witnessed and been on the roller coaster as well.</p>
<p>Yes, the dramamine. I&rsquo;ve taken the dramamine. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s quite</p>
<p>up. Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s exciting. But I think it sort of has its</p>
<p>highs and lows to say the least. But overall, it seems to be</p>
<p>going in a good direction. And, you know, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of</p>
<p>the expenses reasonably under control. So the company&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like on the in the fast lane of bankruptcy anymore. And we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>releasing features faster than Twitter&rsquo;s history, at the same</p>
<p>time as having contained the costs and reduce the cost</p>
<p>structure by a factor of three, maybe, maybe four. So you know,</p>
<p>the verified is obviously that that&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>the verified is obviously that that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s revenue stream as well as a means of identifying of like,</p>
<p>knowing that it&rsquo;s a real person and not a barter or trial</p>
<p>situation. The having the affiliation organization</p>
<p>affiliation, which I suspect you talked about that was a idea of</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s that was great to have organization affiliation. So you</p>
<p>can know that somebody is an actual professor at Stanford or</p>
<p>that this particular handle is actually Disney, not someone</p>
<p>simply putting I work at Disney in my in their bio. So I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be really helpful. It just really just having</p>
<p>detailed and nuanced verification. So of all the</p>
<p>various things that you say you are, are these things validated</p>
<p>by other people and organizations?</p>
<p>Can you tell us how you do product iteration, Ilan? Because</p>
<p>one of the things that I think some people got jolted by over</p>
<p>the last couple of weeks is like a bunch of things got taken away</p>
<p>or changed or rules changed, or policies changed, and there was</p>
<p>very quick action. And then people had all this negative</p>
<p>feedback about the quick action without communication. But your</p>
<p>extraordinary talent is to iterate product to success. Can</p>
<p>you just maybe share with people how you do product iteration in</p>
<p>this context, to help them understand how some of these</p>
<p>decisions get made, and why moving quickly is so important.</p>
<p>And just, you know, how you&rsquo;re doing this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in like, you want to look at the net output.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like, you know, what&rsquo;s the batting average? If</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like baseball? The point is, is not that you like, you</p>
<p>know, hit the ball, but it&rsquo;s like, well, how many home runs</p>
<p>you get? And how like, what&rsquo;s your actual</p>
<p>your slugging percentage?</p>
<p>Yeah, slugging percentage? Yeah, yeah. It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>swing for the fences, you&rsquo;re gonna, you&rsquo;re gonna, you know,</p>
<p>strike out a bit more, but we&rsquo;re gonna swing for the fences here</p>
<p>at Twitter. And we&rsquo;re gonna do it quickly. So and I think,</p>
<p>generally, like my error rate, and sort of being the chief</p>
<p>twit will be less over time. But, you know, in the beginning,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll make obviously sort of a lot more mistakes. And, you</p>
<p>know, because it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m new to the I&rsquo;m like, hey, I just got</p>
<p>here, man. So, I mean, if you look at like, the actual amount</p>
<p>of improvement that&rsquo;s happened at Twitter in terms of like,</p>
<p>like, having costs that are not insane, and getting an actually</p>
<p>shipping product that on balance is good. I think that is that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great. Like, I think we&rsquo;re actually executing well</p>
<p>and getting things done. I think we&rsquo;ll have fewer, fewer gaps in</p>
<p>the future.</p>
<p>How did you get to your intuition on what the efficient</p>
<p>frontier of employees needed to be to make the product better?</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I was a part of this, we&rsquo;re basically asked the</p>
<p>question, who here is critical? And who here is exceptional?</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, so, I mean, really, the what the criteria is trying</p>
<p>to apply, and obviously, you&rsquo;re gonna be perfect. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>moving fast, and there&rsquo;s a lot of, you know, people you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about here is that anyone who is exceptional at</p>
<p>what they do, where the role is critical, they have a positive</p>
<p>effect on others. And they are trusted, meaning they put the</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s interests before their own should stay pretty</p>
<p>straightforward. Yeah. And also, and it also is up for working,</p>
<p>you know, working hard, like, that would not that would have</p>
<p>not just this, this, this, that&rsquo;s not was not Twitter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>prior culture.</p>
<p>Yeah. Were you surprised that that the intersection of circle</p>
<p>and the people that left was basically 25%? Were you</p>
<p>surprised it was that deep? Or did you think your intuition was</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s probably somewhere in here?</p>
<p>Well, I think you could just stand back and say, without</p>
<p>knowing how many employees Twitter has at all, and say, how</p>
<p>many people are really needed to run Twitter? Like, let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what the playhead count number is at all. How many</p>
<p>people are needed to keep the site operational? Like, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say, excluding product, product evolution, you basically have to</p>
<p>keep the service going. And you have to have customer sort of a</p>
<p>support function to take down material that is in violation of</p>
<p>the law. How many people? What&rsquo;s the minimum number of people?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the hundreds, probably.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not like a giant number.</p>
<p>Yeah. Twitter still has like 2000 people, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, we still have 2000 people. It&rsquo;s not nothing. And actually,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s actually on the order of like, almost 5000</p>
<p>contractors. Like, almost, yeah, almost all of the what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>trust and safety work, which is like, the support functions for</p>
<p>the site are done by contractors.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing a lot more to take down hate speech than the</p>
<p>company previously was doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. The hate speech impressions are down by a</p>
<p>third, and we&rsquo;ll get even lower.</p>
<p>Maybe you could speak a little bit to the what we discovered, I</p>
<p>think, in those early weeks, which was the incentive. The</p>
<p>incentive previously was to create as many accounts as</p>
<p>possible. And there were a lot of quick fixes to lowering all</p>
<p>these, you know, what people might call bought accounts. In</p>
<p>some cases, it was people opening many millions of</p>
<p>accounts. But we discovered this very early. How easy was it for</p>
<p>you with the tech team to maybe lower the bot count and all the</p>
<p>fake accounts? Maybe you could speak a little bit to that</p>
<p>because people have seemed to think that, gosh, it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>hard thing to get rid of bots. And it turns out it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We still have a fair number of bots in the system. But the, I</p>
<p>think that the incentive structure, the way Twitter set</p>
<p>up previously was this relentless focus on what they</p>
<p>called MDAL, which is monetizable daily active users,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;d say the monetizable part is dubious. But at least</p>
<p>things that appeared to be monetized or could be passed off</p>
<p>as monetizable daily active users. So this, I created an</p>
<p>incentive, an incentive to turn a blind eye to a fake accounts.</p>
<p>So if the incentive structure is like, you know, maximize the</p>
<p>appearance of monetizable daily active users, then you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a strong incentive to pretend that a bot is real. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happened. So we&rsquo;re taking a lot of steps to reduce</p>
<p>the bots and troll situation. So many. And I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing that in the usage, like, it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>relatively rare to have your replies filled with crypto</p>
<p>scams.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not seeing any anymore. Freeberg, you had a question?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, just on your earlier question, you know,</p>
<p>Elon, when you first started making changes at Twitter after</p>
<p>you bought the business, a lot of people kind of took notice</p>
<p>at how extraordinarily swift and significant those changes were.</p>
<p>Yeah. And there&rsquo;s a lot of technology companies that have</p>
<p>CEOs and investors and boards. And we all talked to a lot of</p>
<p>them. And they&rsquo;re all now having a conversation like, look at</p>
<p>what Elon did a Twitter, how can we do something as aggressive as</p>
<p>swift as deep? Do you think much about kind of the model you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>playing for other businesses and other business leaders,</p>
<p>particularly in Silicon Valley and how you&rsquo;re operating</p>
<p>Twitter? Do you ever kind of talk about that? Because I know</p>
<p>you, you mostly talk about your business, and you talk about the</p>
<p>businesses you&rsquo;re running. But you&rsquo;re having a big influence, I</p>
<p>think, and how other people kind of act and behave that are other</p>
<p>business leaders and run other technology companies.</p>
<p>I mean, to be frank, I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not really, you know, thinking</p>
<p>about that much, because I&rsquo;m just thinking about like, how do</p>
<p>we just, you know, just get Twitter to be in a financially</p>
<p>healthy place, and, and, and fix the engine of engineering so we</p>
<p>can have a rapid evolution of new products. So and, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, I guess I&rsquo;m in sort of, in some ways, unfortunate</p>
<p>position where I don&rsquo;t have to answer. It&rsquo;s not public. And we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a board, really. So I mean, so I can just go, you</p>
<p>know, and I can take actions that are drastic. And obviously,</p>
<p>if I make a bunch of mistakes, then the Twitter won&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll be pretty embarrassing and sad. But as</p>
<p>long as like I said, as long as the batting averages is good,</p>
<p>that that the wins out, you know, significantly outweigh the</p>
<p>mistakes, then, you know, it&rsquo;ll be a great future. And I think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very optimistic about where things are headed.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people want to talk about your understand,</p>
<p>Elon, your position on freedom of speech and your principles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, you&rsquo;ve been pretty upfront about it. How do you</p>
<p>think about it post acquisition? You know, what</p>
<p>speech should be allowed in the platform, Kanye came back, he</p>
<p>just went insane. His account got revoked. What have you</p>
<p>learned, I guess, now that you own it, because you must be</p>
<p>getting a lot of inbound from people asking you, hey, how are</p>
<p>decisions going to be made, etc. You&rsquo;ve been clear,</p>
<p>transparency is super important in this. But what are your</p>
<p>thoughts on free speech and speech on a platform like this?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the general principle, I think, is that we</p>
<p>should hew close to the law in any given country. So the law is</p>
<p>very, quite a lot by by country. And so I think we</p>
<p>should be doing free speech that&rsquo;s close, close to the law.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the general principle. The, I think</p>
<p>there are other things where it&rsquo;s like, okay, we like, for</p>
<p>example, like, if you&rsquo;re an advertiser, you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t want your ad, like, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>family movie, next to some, you know, NSFW content, even if that</p>
<p>content is text, you know, it&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;ll be like, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably that&rsquo;s we don&rsquo;t, you know, so so that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, part of what you know, like, like, so there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more of an allowance for what you might what some I call hate</p>
<p>speech on the system, but it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>promoted. It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re not going to be</p>
<p>recommending hate speech. It&rsquo;s a risk of stating the obvious. And</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to monetize hate speech. So or negative speech,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s not what advertisers want us to, you know, any any, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s going to be a rare product that wants to be next</p>
<p>seriously negative stuff.</p>
<p>I was gonna say you referred to it as hey, freedom of speech,</p>
<p>but not reach, because this is a very nuanced discussion. Like,</p>
<p>should this stuff be able to hit the trends, you know, and that</p>
<p>kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s only possible that some things that will be</p>
<p>regarded as hate speech will hit will hit will hit trends. But I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna be relatively unusual, especially as we are</p>
<p>doing a better job of controlling the bots and trolls</p>
<p>situation. And I do want to emphasize, like, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>difference between bots and trolls, like bots, like fully</p>
<p>automated accounts, but like a troll phone would be where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got like, you know, 100 people in a warehouse somewhere</p>
<p>each with 100 phones. And so they&rsquo;re actually humans, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to pass a capture test or, you know, and they can,</p>
<p>you know, reply, reply, and they&rsquo;re because they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>good humans, but it&rsquo;s actually 10,000 accounts that are just</p>
<p>that are obviously not operating as as as real people. So that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, you know, stuff like that can cause things to trend</p>
<p>negatively. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m like a big proponent of having just a</p>
<p>low cost verification capability. And, yeah, so, like,</p>
<p>this is definitely a work in progress. So there&rsquo;s, like, so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be, and I did, like, one of the first things I</p>
<p>said, after the acquisition closed was like, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>make a bunch of mistakes, but then we&rsquo;ll try to recover from</p>
<p>them quickly. And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve done. And I</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve generally succeeded in recovering up from them</p>
<p>quickly. And it&rsquo;s been going pretty well.</p>
<p>Was the Paul Graham and journalists suspensions</p>
<p>mistakes? Have you talked about this publicly about how that all</p>
<p>kind of got resolved at the end?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the Paul Graham suspension was definitely a</p>
<p>mistake. And I actually called Paul Graham to apologize</p>
<p>personally for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, great.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, you know, on the journalist front, the I think</p>
<p>the journalist essential suspensions were not not a</p>
<p>mistake, in that, for some reason, a bunch of journalists</p>
<p>thought they were better than regular than everyone else. And</p>
<p>that if they engage in doxing and, you know, other and break</p>
<p>the rules in various ways, that that they&rsquo;re not subject to</p>
<p>suspension, even though your average your average citizen is</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s just messed up. The same rules should apply</p>
<p>to people who call themselves journalists as to, you know,</p>
<p>anyone else on the system. They shouldn&rsquo;t be sort of above the</p>
<p>rules. For some reason, they thought they should be that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that doesn&rsquo;t make sense. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah. And the rules being transparent and upfront. I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what everybody&rsquo;s looking forward to maybe some</p>
<p>just complete clarity and transparency. And you&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>from the beginning, when somebody gets suspended, or the</p>
<p>shadow banning of this sort of would tips into this really</p>
<p>weird stuff that we discovered during or you discovered where</p>
<p>the journalists discovered during the Twitter files, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a bummer that people are being sanctioned or</p>
<p>shadow banned. And they don&rsquo;t know it. If we&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>a system, the rules should be clear to everybody.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. So the saying I&rsquo;ve committed to and we&rsquo;ll,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll, I think, probably be able to roll that out in January.</p>
<p>Just by the way, there is like a bit of a, you know, we are not</p>
<p>going to be rolling out a ton of new features over, you know,</p>
<p>Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s and stuff. So there&rsquo;s like a, you</p>
<p>know, the next sort of feature set will probably roll out</p>
<p>mid to late January. And hopefully in that we can include</p>
<p>information about why an account is suspended, or has what is</p>
<p>called within Tesla to Twitter visibility filtering, aka shadow</p>
<p>banning. So and some of these things like, are like this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things that just happen accidentally, where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, you know, the rules in the system that are meant to</p>
<p>detect whether someone&rsquo;s a sort of bot or troll or like</p>
<p>brigading, whether like, you know, and then an account is</p>
<p>sort of innocently caught up in that. So, like, there was some</p>
<p>accounts just suspended yesterday, because, but</p>
<p>temporarily suspended, like they got like 12 hour suspensions,</p>
<p>because someone in customers is someone in trust and safety</p>
<p>thought that they had posted a nude photo of Hunter Biden or</p>
<p>something. But they hadn&rsquo;t they hadn&rsquo;t actually done that. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know, it was just basically a mistake. There were</p>
<p>some accounts that were there were got a 12 hour suspension</p>
<p>yesterday for it in error. And they weren&rsquo;t sure why it why it</p>
<p>happened. It was just essentially a mistake in the</p>
<p>with Twitter customer support that was corrected.</p>
<p>Ilan, let me, let me ask you just a slightly broader</p>
<p>question. One of the things we just talked about was the regime</p>
<p>change that&rsquo;s happened where, you know, we all have to act</p>
<p>differently now that the risk free rate is probably going to</p>
<p>get to 5%. And I&rsquo;m just curious, across all your businesses. So</p>
<p>Twitter, yes, but really, more importantly, Tesla, SpaceX, are</p>
<p>their decisions that you will make differently or not at all</p>
<p>or will make that you wouldn&rsquo;t have made otherwise, in this new</p>
<p>regime? And how often do you think about that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s more like, like, it does seem like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>headed into a recession here. In 2023, the magnitude that</p>
<p>recession is debatable, but I think it&rsquo;s at least a light to</p>
<p>moderate recession, potentially, it&rsquo;s on the order of 2009. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, so I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s wise to kind of like,</p>
<p>prepare for the worst, hope for the best prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get too adventurous, like, like, watch out for margin</p>
<p>debt. Like, I would really advise people to not have margin</p>
<p>debt in a volatile stock market. And, you know, from a cash</p>
<p>standpoint, keep keep powder dry. You can get some pretty</p>
<p>extreme things happening in a down market. Like Brett Johnson,</p>
<p>who was a CFO, who is a CFO, CFO of SpaceX was at Broadcom in</p>
<ol start="2000">
<li>And he said that, and that&rsquo;s a good company making</li>
</ol>
<p>good products. And he said the, the from, from peak to trough, I</p>
<p>think in less than 12 months, Broadcom went down 97%. So like,</p>
<p>even if you had a small margin loan there, you got you got</p>
<p>crushed. And subsequently recovered, and I think, you</p>
<p>know, to much higher levels, but you know, if there&rsquo;s like mass</p>
<p>panic in the stock market, then you got to be really be careful</p>
<p>about margin debt. So but I mean, this is just as we know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the economy is cyclic. So you and it&rsquo;s somewhat overdue</p>
<p>for a recession. And my best guess is that, you know, we</p>
<p>have sort of stormy times for a year to a year and a half, and</p>
<p>then things start to dawn breaks roughly in q2 24. If I were to</p>
<p>get it, that&rsquo;s like my best guess. recessions don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>booms don&rsquo;t last forever, forever, but neither do</p>
<p>recessions. And it&rsquo;s a 14 year boom. So a six quarter</p>
<p>recession seems like that may that might actually bounce out</p>
<p>the last time it was what four or five quarters. So it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>easy. Hey, the Twitter files. How much longer are these going</p>
<p>to go on? It seems like every week, another drop. And these</p>
<p>are pretty controversial. How much longer are the Twitter</p>
<p>files going to go on? In your mind? Yeah. And maybe why is</p>
<p>this important to you to make sure that people understand the</p>
<p>stuff? Yeah,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to like, if we&rsquo;re going to be trusted in</p>
<p>the future to kind of clear the decks for stuff that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>in the past. So I mean, to be totally frank, almost every</p>
<p>conspiracy theory that people had about Twitter turned out to</p>
<p>be true. So is there a conspiracy theory about Twitter</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t turn out to be true? So far, they&rsquo;ve all turned out</p>
<p>to be true. And if not, more true than people thought.</p>
<p>Is there a part of the files that really shocked you more</p>
<p>than the rest of them? Like of the things that have been</p>
<p>disclosed? Of all of these things? Is there something that</p>
<p>really sticks out with you as like, holy shit, I had no idea</p>
<p>this was happening? Or is the whole thing just a big dumpster</p>
<p>they were just looking at one huge thing. Um, you know, like</p>
<p>psyops versus the hunter Biden thing versus the Yeah, the</p>
<p>number of FBI people involved. That was pretty intense. Yeah,</p>
<p>the FBI psyops stuff, to me was probably the one that was the</p>
<p>most insidious, like, the rest of it, I could think of, like,</p>
<p>you know, a bunch of overzealous libs got used. Yeah, got it. You</p>
<p>know what I mean? Sure, sure. But to have like a secure skiff</p>
<p>that essentially sends things that, you know, government</p>
<p>agents want the populace to basically think seems like kind</p>
<p>of like a really bad dystopian novel. And then it turns out it</p>
<p>existed. And then it also the thing is, it couldn&rsquo;t have just</p>
<p>existed at Twitter. So what do we do about all the other places</p>
<p>where this shit&rsquo;s happened? YouTube, Facebook? Yeah, it did.</p>
<p>None of it seemed that surprising to me. I mean, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know, maybe I just believed all the conspiracy</p>
<p>theories. But I&rsquo;ve also been inside some of these companies</p>
<p>and seen how they operate. So honestly, none of it was a</p>
<p>surprise to me. Was it a big shock to you, Elon?</p>
<p>Wait, you, Friberg, you were, I think you can claim that you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t surprised that these companies were shadow banning,</p>
<p>although they denied it. But did you really suspect that the FBI</p>
<p>was playing a role in flagging content for these companies to</p>
<p>take down? Like that blew me away.</p>
<p>Content that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with like, terrorism.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re not investigating crimes. There&rsquo;s no crime. Right?</p>
<p>Yeah, they literally flagged satire. Maybe they didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the joke. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t seem to be a humor driven group. But they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to have the best senses of humor. But aren&rsquo;t they supposed</p>
<p>to get warrants? Isn&rsquo;t that how it&rsquo;s supposed to work in a</p>
<p>democracy? They want information.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re all that&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s troubling to me.</p>
<p>Put yourself on either side of the extremes.</p>
<p>We have Michael Schellenberger here who broke the FBI story in</p>
<p>the Twitter file. So let&rsquo;s look at him and to see. Because I</p>
<p>think maybe the audience isn&rsquo;t caught up on like what was</p>
<p>discovered. So</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now I know I have to follow Elon Musk. That doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem fair. Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Hey, Michael, how are you? I&rsquo;m good. Just a quick question for</p>
<p>Michael.</p>
<p>Michael, first of all, first of all, who makes that sweater?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send you mine, man. Do you want it? Are you making fun of</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the master of sweaters. High praise from you, brother.</p>
<p>High praise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking. I&rsquo;m asking. I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>Just briefly, Michael, isn&rsquo;t the FBI supposed to get warrants to</p>
<p>Yes, take actions with folks. And then I guess is that at the</p>
<p>crux of this? Are they doing this at other companies? You</p>
<p>think? Are they just like embedded in YouTube? Should we</p>
<p>expect they&rsquo;re embedded at meta, and that they don&rsquo;t get warrants</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of tipping the scales? And is that a good thing</p>
<p>for society or a bad thing for society? It&rsquo;s a bit of a basic</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I think there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s multiple issues relating</p>
<p>to FBI that I think have to be unpacked a bit. But the first</p>
<p>one is that yeah, FBI was constantly pushing the</p>
<p>boundaries of what is legally and ethically acceptable in</p>
<p>terms of requesting information. Now, I think what you saw over</p>
<p>the last three weeks was a shift. And I think our own</p>
<p>understanding that we did see more pushback from Twitter</p>
<p>executives against FBI, and some alarm bells being rung in</p>
<p>terms of the requests that were being made from the intelligence</p>
<p>community. But these guys were really persistent, they kept</p>
<p>asking for more, they kept getting more and more</p>
<p>cooperation. It&rsquo;s very troubling. It does look like</p>
<p>Congress is going to look into this, the two heads of the</p>
<p>committees that are tasked with this or have said that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to look into it next year. I think the other thing that we</p>
<p>saw that I think is is more troubling was this persistent</p>
<p>effort to basically communicate to Twitter executives, but also</p>
<p>to news media, national security correspondents, that there was</p>
<p>this heavy foreign infiltration going on this, this Russian</p>
<p>disinformation. And it appeared to me looking at all the</p>
<p>evidence both that we saw from within Twitter and from outside</p>
<p>of it, that this was pretty organized effort to convince</p>
<p>key executives at Twitter and Facebook, but also these key</p>
<p>reporters, that they should expect a hack and leak</p>
<p>operation sometime right before the elections having to do with</p>
<p>Hunter Biden. I find that very suspicious.</p>
<p>Can I make an observation? I think that maybe what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>finding out is that the mainstream media tried to go</p>
<p>back to its 1980 Cold War playbook and turn Russia into a</p>
<p>boogeyman. But as we&rsquo;re seeing in the Ukraine war, you know,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re not nearly the formidable foe that we thought</p>
<p>they were. And so it could probably be the case that in</p>
<p>2016, they were as inept technically as as they are</p>
<p>militarily right now. And so we may have just built up this</p>
<p>monster that is kind of more like, you know, a much smaller</p>
<p>thing to be worried about. And we all ran with it because we</p>
<p>had no evidence. But the Ukraine, Russia war is evidence</p>
<p>that you know, this highly sophisticated war machine and</p>
<p>propaganda machine is not that good at their job.</p>
<p>Right? Yeah, I mean, I think that what&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>interest that we&rsquo;re being served by hyping the so called Russian</p>
<p>misinformation threat. I mean, one of them was just to simply</p>
<p>explain away the Trump phenomenon, as a consequence of</p>
<p>foreign interference. Certainly the people that ran Hillary</p>
<p>Clinton&rsquo;s campaign had an interest in doing that. But then</p>
<p>you saw it become a sort of way, I think, to condition people for</p>
<p>the release of the Biden laptop. And again, we can&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t prove that. But it is striking that the Yole Roth,</p>
<p>this means Twitter executive, who I think was the object of</p>
<p>this misinformation campaign, testified under oath that he was</p>
<p>being bombarded with these messages all throughout 2020,</p>
<p>that they should expect some sort of a hack and leak</p>
<p>operation. So when the New York Post finally did report on that</p>
<p>computer, in 2014, it was briefly censored by Twitter. But</p>
<p>I think more importantly, it was discredited in the minds of many</p>
<p>voters, including myself, I really didn&rsquo;t think that that</p>
<p>laptop was what they said it was. And it turned out that it</p>
<p>was. So I do think it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a real troubling pattern of</p>
<p>behavior by both the FBI agents, but also by the former FBI</p>
<p>executives, including the Deputy Chief of Staff and the Chief</p>
<p>Counsel from FBI that that were at Twitter as executives at the</p>
<p>time. And in fairness, Michael, this has been brought up many</p>
<p>times. But I just would like your take on it, because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a lifelong Democrat, correct? Until until last year. Great. So</p>
<p>it would, you know, just lest anybody think that you are like</p>
<p>some MAGA supporter here. My sweater. This was all on the</p>
<p>backdrop of Trump, asking for the Russians, you know, during</p>
<p>that debate to hack Hillary for him interfering with Zelensky</p>
<p>and trying to get him to give dirt on Biden. And the fact that</p>
<p>Hunter Biden was obviously dirty. So to expect a hack,</p>
<p>there was massive precedent for it. So that set the stage for</p>
<p>this, correct?</p>
<p>For sure. And there&rsquo;s definitely that going on. And maybe that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all there was to it. It is just striking, of course, because I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even mentioned in my this was, by the way, this is</p>
<p>Twitter thread, part seven that I did on this issue. I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even get into the fact that, you know, within a few days, the</p>
<p>many of former senior heads of intelligence organizations and</p>
<p>others came out and said that it was the result of a Russian</p>
<p>disinformation campaign. So yeah, sure. I mean, I guess we</p>
<p>could find some other explanation for it, whether it</p>
<p>was innocent or coordinated, but it is it is striking. Also, I</p>
<p>think the other thing that we found was the contrast between</p>
<p>the the threat inflation and what what Twitter was finding</p>
<p>themselves. I mean, there was, you know, you&rsquo;ll repeatedly</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll Roth would respond to FBI that, yeah, we looked into</p>
<p>these accounts that you mentioned, and they were all</p>
<p>very low follower accounts with very little activity. So they</p>
<p>just weren&rsquo;t finding very much foreign influence on the Twitter</p>
<p>platform. And so I just think it was grossly inflated, either</p>
<p>for kind of good reasons or bad reasons, I would say, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. And it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s no perfect way to police this</p>
<p>stuff, obviously. And okay, well, listen, we appreciate</p>
<p>your reporting. Thanks for doing it. And if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>read Michael&rsquo;s book, San Francisco, you did some great</p>
<p>reporting there as well. And continued success in your</p>
<p>investigative journalism. Thank you, Michael. Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>Appreciate it. All right, cool. Sorry. Awesome. Sorry.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still here.</p>
<p>Hey, you did an interview on that. I think I saw it on</p>
<p>YouTube or something where you interviewed someone who was</p>
<p>homeless in San Francisco, and they were addicted to drugs. And</p>
<p>they kind of said some narrative about how they were in this</p>
<p>condition, because San Francisco basically pays them to be</p>
<p>homeless and pays them to do drugs on the street. Did that</p>
<p>ever get published? And did that come out? Because it was such a</p>
<p>compelling couple of minutes that you got on tape there. It</p>
<p>really, for me sent home a message of how far kind of</p>
<p>progressive policies can take a society. And it&rsquo;s such a beacon</p>
<p>for where things might go as other people start to think</p>
<p>about adopting similar policies around the world, which is why I</p>
<p>thought it was such important reporting, whatever happened</p>
<p>with that. And where can folks see that? Because it was such a</p>
<p>moving interview for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you just Google Michael Schellenberger, YouTube</p>
<p>homeless, you&rsquo;ll be able to find all my videos. There&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>them that we did with people on the street. All of them, of</p>
<p>course, people asking and wanting to do them. But yeah, I</p>
<p>mean, what we I also wrote about that in my book, which is</p>
<p>basically a San Francisco pays cash welfare payment of somewhere</p>
<p>between six to $700. Plus, you can get $200 in food stamps. And</p>
<p>a lot of people sadly use that to maintain their addiction. And</p>
<p>this gentleman, James with the tattoos on his face was very</p>
<p>honest about how he was playing the system. In fact, he was</p>
<p>himself, we found this increasingly kind of horrified by</p>
<p>the incentives that San Francisco was creating for</p>
<p>people to live on the streets and, and live on the streets in</p>
<p>their in their addiction. So yeah, you can find that on</p>
<p>so many people say incentives drive behavior. And</p>
<p>unfortunately, these policies all came from a good place from</p>
<p>a kind heart. And the idea that we could help people in need.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, the way that the incentives get structured,</p>
<p>they can actually cause more harm than good. It&rsquo;s such an</p>
<p>important lesson. I just wanted to say that because I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re reporting on this really hit that home. So so thanks for</p>
<p>doing that. I think it&rsquo;s really important because we have we</p>
<p>have to do the right thing for people. But we also have to be</p>
<p>careful that the policies are done in the right way. So I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s so well said, Friedberg, because when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Michael, and I just think you&rsquo;re very courageous for doing it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very easy for somebody to say, Oh, well, you</p>
<p>are being callous. The truth is incentives matter. And we saw</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen this over and over again, if you pay for something,</p>
<p>you get more of it. And really, San Francisco is bearing the</p>
<p>burden. I think this is what your book and, you know, in a</p>
<p>lot of the videos you&rsquo;ve made, at least the message I got was,</p>
<p>San Francisco has the lowest price of drugs, the lowest</p>
<p>enforcement, and the most incentives, therefore, they</p>
<p>suffer, because every person who is, you know, addicted comes</p>
<p>here, because they speak to each other. And 90% of the people who</p>
<p>are in San Francisco are here, because we have created an</p>
<p>incentive structure. Is that directionally correct? As we</p>
<p>wrap here? Yeah, 100% correct, including just the non</p>
<p>enforcement of laws against sleeping on the sidewalk doing</p>
<p>drugs in public, not requiring ultimately, three times more</p>
<p>people die, living outside as an unsheltered homeless person</p>
<p>rather than live than being in a shelter. And for me, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all you need to know to know that you usually cannot allow</p>
<p>our brothers and sisters to sleep on the street, no matter</p>
<p>how desperate they sound about wanting to avoid going inside,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s three times deadlier to be on the street than inside.</p>
<p>So the compassionate thing is to force people into housing. Yes.</p>
<p>People to say, but you know, because you&rsquo;re, we have this</p>
<p>perception that people have freedom, and they should have</p>
<p>the right to do this. But a person who&rsquo;s taking fentanyl, in</p>
<p>your research, is not thinking correctly. And if it was any</p>
<p>family member of ours, we would not want them to make that</p>
<p>decision for themselves. We&rsquo;d want somebody else to make that</p>
<p>decision for them. Correct.</p>
<p>Abs, I would want that from if I was on the street, so desperate</p>
<p>that I was, you know, smoking fentanyl and breaking multiple</p>
<p>laws every day. Of course, I would want to be hospitalized.</p>
<p>You know, and usually, you know, people overcome their addiction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the good news. We always leave out of it. But it is</p>
<p>possible people do overcome their addiction all the time.</p>
<p>But they often need some some intervention from family and</p>
<p>friends. And if that&rsquo;s too late for that, then you need the</p>
<p>intervention from the from the city.</p>
<p>All right, Michael, thank you, Michael. Appreciate it. So as we</p>
<p>get back to the all in news network, we&rsquo;ve now gone 24 hours</p>
<p>a day, the all in news network has launched. We&rsquo;ll just have a</p>
<p>road we should sit at various offices throughout Silicon</p>
<p>Valley, letting executives and CEOs</p>
<p>imagine we did like a 12 hour marathon show for charity, where</p>
<p>just people showed up. And we did a what do they call those on</p>
<p>TV? What is the charity?</p>
<p>Telephone by Jekyll Jekyll a plane?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, just a ticket. Telephone. Jekyll has to still</p>
<p>fly commercial. We&rsquo;ll do a telethon. Hey, Saks, thank you</p>
<p>for setting up those amazing drop ins. Well done. Thanks,</p>
<p>Saks. Thanks, Saks.</p>
<p>I think that was good. Your jacket. That&rsquo;s a great jacket.</p>
<p>Is that custom? That is an Eastside. I&rsquo;ll Stuart Eastside.</p>
<p>This is the Christmas or holiday jacket.</p>
<p>Who is it by Eastside?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Valentino.</p>
<p>All right. Well, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s nice. Also. Okay.</p>
<p>But okay, let&rsquo;s keep going here. We got to go to lightning round.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s move biggest flash in the pan. We were was</p>
<p>our last. I went with crypto. Pretty easy to say that. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to give myself a big high five. But what do you guys think</p>
<p>of the Elon conversation real quick? Well, he&rsquo;s very talkative</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s anything interesting or surprising for you. I mean, he</p>
<p>said the biggest, you know, thing that people want to make</p>
<p>sure to avoid is margin debt. That was I mean, he&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>hard. And he&rsquo;s just such a product of focused guy. He just</p>
<p>gets his he&rsquo;s like, so deeply into it. It&rsquo;s like, yeah, just</p>
<p>ultimately, product wins, right? Friedberg. I mean, if anything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on my god, of course, that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s it. Yeah. So I mean, and</p>
<p>then, you know, products are made by teams. So what I think</p>
<p>is distinctly different here, I&rsquo;m just giving my personal</p>
<p>opinion. I don&rsquo;t know what Microsoft Teams. No, no, no.</p>
<p>Teams make products. And so what I just want to say here is, you</p>
<p>know, like, Microsoft Teams suck. No, that I&rsquo;m not. No,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t trigger the bundle. But I just want to say, you know,</p>
<p>like, this is a takeover. As opposed to building a company</p>
<p>from scratch, he&rsquo;s had to assemble a team, and then work</p>
<p>at this incredible product pace. And I think those two things are</p>
<p>starting to click week. Yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna look very different</p>
<p>than week the first six weeks. So yeah, the products are already</p>
<p>looking awesome. And it was nice to him to give me that shout</p>
<p>out on the you know, the affiliate badges, but I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>give a shout out. I didn&rsquo;t hear it. What was it? Oh, well, he</p>
<p>gave me he gave me some credit for the affiliate badges. But I</p>
<p>wanted to give credit to the PMs who approached me about that</p>
<p>troll. I went again. Okay, is there? Let me give me give</p>
<p>credit to the actual PMs, Evan Jones and Patrick Trauger, who</p>
<p>they approached me about this idea they had. And then I</p>
<p>helped, you know, give it some momentum.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the truth. When Dave and I spent the first couple weeks</p>
<p>there. Now that it&rsquo;s a little more public, he wants to be on</p>
<p>the program. What we found over and over again, was that there</p>
<p>were great features that were ready to be released, that were</p>
<p>being held back by management. And there were brilliant people</p>
<p>with all the ideas that you think should have been released.</p>
<p>And they just weren&rsquo;t allowed to release a lot of these products.</p>
<p>Why? Who knows. But now that he&rsquo;s in charge, I think you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see the product cycle is going to go much quicker.</p>
<p>The most important thing I saw, which is such an important</p>
<p>lesson for anyone running a business in Silicon Valley is</p>
<p>that the pace of decision making matters far more than the</p>
<p>accuracy of decision making. It&rsquo;s always been like one of my</p>
<p>three big mottos.</p>
<p>Say more about that for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Yeah, for me, like my number one, like my three things are</p>
<p>always like grit, bias to action, and then narrative, but</p>
<p>like bias to action, the rate at which you can make decisions is</p>
<p>a far greater predictor of success than the accuracy of the</p>
<p>decisions you do make. And so you have to be willing to</p>
<p>embrace failure, you have to be willing to make decisions that</p>
<p>could result in something not being done correctly, or making</p>
<p>a mistake, and even getting embarrassed on the internet, you</p>
<p>know, by making mistakes and having to call people like Paul</p>
<p>Graham and apologize for them. And that was a big moment. But</p>
<p>as a business scales, as professional managers are</p>
<p>brought in, their incentive is to not make mistakes, their</p>
<p>incentive is to do things that are predictably going to work,</p>
<p>and are predictably not going to fail. And therefore, they avoid</p>
<p>taking the risks, and they reduce the rate of action, the</p>
<p>rate of decision making. And that&rsquo;s why so many businesses</p>
<p>ultimately don&rsquo;t scale past some sort of inflection point, or</p>
<p>when founders that are willing to push that envelope step out,</p>
<p>everything starts to fall apart. And it&rsquo;s so critically</p>
<p>important, I think, to look at that as being, I think, Elon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>defining trait and characteristics that this,</p>
<p>regardless of the scale of the organization and the enterprise,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s still willing to act with that level of bias to action</p>
<p>that you typically see in a small startup. Okay. And put his</p>
<p>reputation on the at risk. Yeah.</p>
<p>Just so that I sat in a meeting yesterday, he said that, if</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not rolling back 10% of the time, we haven&rsquo;t pushed hard</p>
<p>enough. Right? Wonderful. There you go. I mean, it&rsquo;s like, if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never rolling anything back, because you never make a</p>
<p>mistake, maybe you&rsquo;re just not right, moving fast enough. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have an ambitious enough, you&rsquo;re not fast enough of a</p>
<p>bias towards action, you&rsquo;re too afraid of making a mistake.</p>
<p>By the way, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so interesting about the views</p>
<p>feature is that a bunch of websites, I think it started</p>
<p>because Instagram did a bunch of apps, deprecated, you know,</p>
<p>likes, because they felt that it was too. It was part of this</p>
<p>negative cycle. And so they took all this stuff away. And</p>
<p>basically, views is going sort of back in that direction and</p>
<p>giving more granularity in terms of outside in social engagement</p>
<p>on a post, which is, I think, interesting to see it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening in a moment where all these other sites, and apps are</p>
<p>actually going in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like a standard feature on YouTube. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very powerful for YouTube&rsquo;s network effects, because it</p>
<p>shows you how many views you get. So it discourages people</p>
<p>from using other sites, because you know, you get the most</p>
<p>distribution on YouTube. So it&rsquo;s weird that other social</p>
<p>networks don&rsquo;t want to follow suit. I mean, in one hour,</p>
<p>they had it, but they deprecated. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>interesting.</p>
<p>But I guess, you know, my point is, we&rsquo;ve only had this feature</p>
<p>for an hour. And I didn&rsquo;t realize how much distribution my</p>
<p>tweets were getting. And it definitely undermines my</p>
<p>incentive to want to go use some other platform when I see the</p>
<p>distribution I&rsquo;m getting on Twitter.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re getting 10 times more distribution in the New</p>
<p>York Times, you know, what&rsquo;s going to happen is people stopped</p>
<p>listening and reading.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s sort of like this podcast itself. Like, I</p>
<p>mean, we people ask us to go</p>
<p>and my point is, we have to rely on social proof, and anecdotes</p>
<p>about the actual scale and the breadth and the reach because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible for us to get one holistic view that shows</p>
<p>across all of these different modalities, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Spotify, or Apple podcasts, or YouTube, how many people listen</p>
<p>or watch and you know, we add it all up. And you know, we think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in this, you know, sort of three to 5 million range of</p>
<p>people. But if you just had a numerical canonical number that</p>
<p>was irrefutable, you just run over everybody.</p>
<p>This turns it into a meritocracy is gonna be terrifying to some</p>
<p>blue check marks when they see that the people who they report</p>
<p>on get 10 times as many views as they do, of course, is why when</p>
<p>when journalists look at Sean Hannity, go to Sean Hannity&rsquo;s</p>
<p>profile, and for the number of followers he has, how</p>
<p>pathetically engaged his audiences, it&rsquo;s all bots, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all trolls, it&rsquo;s all nobody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>looked at Mitt Romney just put out a video, whatever. In the</p>
<p>first like half hour, he had 100,000 views, like, every</p>
<p>politician who starts seeing this is going to go wait a</p>
<p>second, I mean, the world is getting more views here than I</p>
<p>am on MSNBC, or Fox, the world is I need to do this rational</p>
<p>place if Mitt Romney actually has more influence than Sean</p>
<p>Hannity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope Okay, let&rsquo;s move on. We got to get through this</p>
<p>quickly. It&rsquo;s our longest episode ever. Here we go. We are</p>
<p>going to do next up. It&rsquo;s very, this is a very important</p>
<p>category. Best CEO of 2022. In 2021. I went with Frank</p>
<p>Slootman and Elon Musk. Chamath went with Satya Nadella. Saks</p>
<p>went with Brian Armstrong and Freeberg went with Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>Now we go on to 2022. Saks who everybody wants to know Saks is</p>
<p>best CEO of 2022. Go ahead, Saks.</p>
<p>Every founder took my advice to get leaner, slow down their</p>
<p>burn, create runway, you know, weather the storm down, you</p>
<p>know, generic answer, not a person. Yeah, exactly. I mean,</p>
<p>look, I think, actually, a lot of the names names. Well, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the problem is that, you know, yeah, can I finish Jacob? The</p>
<p>names that you mentioned from last year will be the top</p>
<p>candidates for this year. I mean, I think Satya Nadella had</p>
<p>a good year. Obviously, what Elon&rsquo;s doing, we just talked</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s amazing. Brian Armstrong, I think the stock</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t done great, but he&rsquo;s been a strong CEO, but I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to repeat the same names. I think that, you know, every CEO</p>
<p>who responded to the regime change by cutting costs,</p>
<p>getting leaner, extending runway, I think deserves to be</p>
<p>on this list. And unfortunately, a lot of them are just</p>
<p>resisting, and they&rsquo;re just not yet taking the medicine, or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been taking the medicine in little drips and drabs</p>
<p>instead of just like swallowing it whole and getting a move on.</p>
<p>Yeah, just drink the whole two tablespoons of medicine. Don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sip it, you got to just take it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not getting better. I mean, the stock market today should be</p>
<p>a wake up call. I mean, this is one of the worst days in the</p>
<p>market the whole year. So things are getting worse before they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting better.</p>
<p>Chamath, who is your best CEO of the year?</p>
<p>Well, the numerical answer is Vicky Holub, who&rsquo;s the CEO of</p>
<p>Occidental Petroleum stocks up like 140%. This year, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>technically the best performing stock of the year. $63 billion</p>
<p>company. But that&rsquo;s just a numerical answer who I, I</p>
<p>actually want to double down on David&rsquo;s answer, Saksa&rsquo;s answer,</p>
<p>because I agree with that. I have been guiding our portfolio</p>
<p>company CEOs to be at cash flow break even now or extend runway</p>
<p>to q1 2025. And they&rsquo;re 25. Yes, because I mean, I think, well,</p>
<p>Elon and I are kind of roughly in the same place we have been</p>
<p>for a while, which is like, you know, mid 24 is when the</p>
<p>recession ends, and you need to give yourself two to three</p>
<p>quarters of buffer so that you can go and raise around which</p>
<p>takes a quarter to two quarters. And once you start to get kind</p>
<p>of get escape velocity out of a recession, having money through</p>
<p>end of q1 2025, I think is a is a minimum requirement. And, you</p>
<p>know, of the companies that I think were the most precariously</p>
<p>positioned, there was five of them that got their acts</p>
<p>together and really did it. But these are all CEOs of companies</p>
<p>that, you know, I mean, if you said them, you would know some</p>
<p>of them. But I do agree with David, I think the CEO that bit</p>
<p>the bullet, so maybe publicly, what I would say is, you know,</p>
<p>the CEO of Karna deserves a huge, you know, medal for having</p>
<p>the courage to do it before anybody else did the CEO of</p>
<p>checkout.com just took a huge write down. These CEOs are</p>
<p>making sure their companies survive. Friedberg best CEO</p>
<ol start="2022">
<li>My vote for best CEO is Warren Buffett. And I think it</li>
</ol>
<p>is just simple arithmetic. He has for years and now for</p>
<p>decades proven himself to be just not just an exceptional</p>
<p>investor, stock picker, whatever the kind of typical quip is</p>
<p>about what he does for a living. But I think what&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>extraordinary about Buffett is that regardless of the market</p>
<p>conditions, he can kind of remain steadfast in his intent</p>
<p>and in his mission. And he doesn&rsquo;t kind of waiver. And, you</p>
<p>know, he doesn&rsquo;t take an active role in ranting and complaining</p>
<p>about markets and politics. And I think that that&rsquo;s what makes</p>
<p>him such an extraordinary leader, he stays within his zone</p>
<p>of competence, he doesn&rsquo;t do things that he doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about. He doesn&rsquo;t let the macro drive him and cause him to be</p>
<p>kind of, you know, affected by it. And he says, this is what I</p>
<p>know how to do, this is what I can do. And that is all that he</p>
<p>does do. And he does it so exceptionally well. And to</p>
<p>Chamath&rsquo;s point, he is the largest shareholder of</p>
<p>Occidental Petroleum, along with many other incredible</p>
<p>businesses. And I think he&rsquo;s proven in a market like we just</p>
<p>had this year, why he is kind of the most extraordinary CEO, or</p>
<p>one of the most extraordinary CEOs, but one of the best kind</p>
<p>of capital allocators of all time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go in a similar fashion, as Chamath and sacks</p>
<p>and go with the money losing CEOs who have dedicated</p>
<p>themselves to free cash flow, and to getting to profitability</p>
<p>from the last cycle, Airbnb, and Uber were the money losers. And</p>
<p>now Airbnb is my number one, they become a money printer,</p>
<p>they are now making bank, and they&rsquo;re still growing very</p>
<p>quickly. And then Uber, I put in my second, they need to do</p>
<p>another riff, they need to cut some expenses, but they too are</p>
<p>hitting the free cash flow and the network effects. So I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>giving it to Chesky, and then Dara, one and two. Okay, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>keep moving best investor. For me, I&rsquo;m going with the</p>
<p>investors, like a general category, who are demanding</p>
<p>governance and doing diligence again, or who never stopped, let</p>
<p>me say it that way. There&rsquo;s a generation of investors who</p>
<p>raised their funds in the last five years and didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>diligence didn&rsquo;t demand board seats, didn&rsquo;t demand boards.</p>
<p>Those idiots are now paying the price, and they created a lot of</p>
<p>this mess of entitlement and a lack of governance. I want to</p>
<p>give a shout out to the Bill Gurley&rsquo;s of the world, who</p>
<p>fought for governance and fought for diligence in the face of</p>
<p>being told, okay, boomer, you don&rsquo;t get it. Who do you have</p>
<p>best investors? Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>I will pick the what are called the pod shops. So these are</p>
<p>folks that have strategies where they have hundreds of investing</p>
<p>pods underneath an umbrella. And they have this very</p>
<p>sophisticated risk infrastructure. So this is what</p>
<p>Ken Griffin owns in Citadel. This is what Izzy Englander owns</p>
<p>in Millennium. Brevin Howard is another one. D.E. Shaw is</p>
<p>another one. So they have all kinds of strategies, but that</p>
<p>are essentially run by computers that allocate risk, you know,</p>
<p>scale you up, scale you back, turn you on, turn you off, fire</p>
<p>you overnight. And those strategies as a whole ran over</p>
<p>the market this year. They were the best performers. They are</p>
<p>giving back billions of dollars, they&rsquo;ve generated double digit</p>
<p>positive returns. They&rsquo;re raising their fees, in some</p>
<p>cases, some of these folks are moving their annual fee up to</p>
<p>4% a year, their carry up to 40% a year. Incredibly,</p>
<p>incredibly well run performant businesses. They were by and</p>
<p>away the best investors this year.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re gonna go lightning round from here. Saks, do you</p>
<p>have a best investor?</p>
<p>Yeah, I said, Stan Druckenmiller. He, as you</p>
<p>recall, last year, he predicted that inflation would be lasting.</p>
<p>This was the spring of 2021. When transitory was the word of</p>
<p>the day. This year, he predicted the bear market rally we had in</p>
<p>July and August. And I remember back at the CO2 summit in May,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re around that time, he was interviewed. And he basically</p>
<p>was saying that as soon as there was a bear market rally over the</p>
<p>summer, that he would then put a short position on I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if he actually did that. But he said he was going to do that.</p>
<p>And then it turns out that the summer rally that we had was a</p>
<p>dead cat bounce. So he was right about that. And now he is</p>
<p>predicting a hard landing in 2023, with a deeper recession</p>
<p>than many expect. So sadly, I suspect he may be right yet</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>Friedberg best investor for you.</p>
<ol start="2022">
<li>I had Druckenmiller, I indicated that he&rsquo;s been doing</li>
</ol>
<p>interviews pretty much every quarter for the last two years.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been pounding the table telling everyone what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>happen. And it all happened. And even told people the trades in</p>
<p>mid 2021. He said he was short long dated treasuries, and he</p>
<p>was long commodities. And if you had put those two trades on at</p>
<p>that time and held them to today, you would have made a</p>
<p>fortune. And so I think he&rsquo;s extraordinary in his ability to</p>
<p>kind of see macro in a way that others don&rsquo;t, but also to take</p>
<p>extremely brave action with his portfolio. He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s renowned for</p>
<p>how big the bets are that he makes, and how quickly he can</p>
<p>change his mind when he&rsquo;s wrong, and make another big bet to and</p>
<p>still get himself out of the hole. He&rsquo;s incredible. So I</p>
<p>definitely give it to Stanley Druckenmiller this year.</p>
<ol start="2021">
<li>We did our best turnarounds. I picked Disney</li>
</ol>
<p>Chamath Ford, Friedberg, we were</p>
<p>should we skip this category? What do you guys do? What about</p>
<p>the worst investor of 2022? Can we do that?</p>
<p>Good, Chamath. You want to freestyle? Tell us your worst</p>
<p>investor of 2022.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll put myself in the category along with anybody else</p>
<p>who was long tech based if Nick if you can just bring please back</p>
<p>up this capital asset pricing model. Any of us that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand this got run over this year. And just to put some</p>
<p>very specific numbers here. There was a decent little tweet</p>
<p>thread that Elon was a part of where he they actually</p>
<p>calculated what the expected rate of return of Tesla was and</p>
<p>it turned out to be almost 14% a year. And so you know, when</p>
<p>you start to compound 14% over three, four or five years, these</p>
<p>numbers get very big very quickly. And the reason why is</p>
<p>that it has a huge beta. And we&rsquo;re in a world now where the</p>
<p>risk free rate is quite high. So all of us benefited from this</p>
<p>equation, essentially being upside down for the last 15</p>
<p>years. And all of us who were over allocated into things that</p>
<p>benefited from those dynamics, frankly got run over this year.</p>
<p>So we were as a class, the worst investors of 2022.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go. Let&rsquo;s do our best turnaround. I am going to</p>
<p>go with me for me, it&rsquo;s meta. They were losing money, hand</p>
<p>over fist, they refuse to do a rift. And then finally, bestie</p>
<p>Brad Gerstner said, Let&rsquo;s get fit. He did a memo. And finally,</p>
<p>finally, Zuckerberg made some cuts, reportedly rumors he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>making a 15 10 or 15% cut I heard in the back channels right</p>
<p>now based on performance. So he&rsquo;s not calling it a riff or a</p>
<p>layoff. They&rsquo;re just gonna cut the bottom 10 or 15% again. So I</p>
<p>think Zuck&rsquo;s gonna turn it around. Anybody have a best</p>
<p>turnaround?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying Zuck mission accomplished?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t turn around this year. I&rsquo;m going with meta.</p>
<p>So your answer is meta was turned around by Zuck this year?</p>
<p>Yes, they&rsquo;ve got down to $85. And now they&rsquo;re up at what, what</p>
<p>110 115? Yes, he turned it around at the end of the year.</p>
<p>It was like a Hail Mary at the end of the year. He&rsquo;s turned it</p>
<p>around. I think he&rsquo;s going to continue to Yes, that is my</p>
<p>position.</p>
<p>Listen, I bought the stock at 94.</p>
<p>Go with that, Jacob.</p>
<p>Okay, so if we&rsquo;re talking about very partial turnarounds here, I</p>
<p>would say, I would say that</p>
<p>you can measure the turnaround as of October 24 to now.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly. So San Francisco still overall a mess. But there</p>
<p>were a few positive events that happened over the past year. And</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;re looking back, we should call these out. So first</p>
<p>of all, back, this is towards the beginning of the year, we</p>
<p>recalled three members of the school board, most particularly</p>
<p>Allison Collins, remember her, this was done by something like</p>
<p>a 7030 margin and 8020 on on Collins. This was the school</p>
<p>board that had dragged its feet on school reopenings, they</p>
<p>destroyed the merit based Lowell High School, they wasted hours</p>
<p>of meetings on a silly plan to remove the names of names like</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln from the from the schools. In any event, they</p>
<p>were removed. Then Jake, how you refer to this, we got chase a</p>
<p>Boudin recalled by a 6040 margin as San Francisco da. This was</p>
<p>the da who whose agenda was decarceration. He tried to</p>
<p>release as many repeat offenders as possible. The voters in</p>
<p>San Francisco had enough. And then most recently, the far less</p>
<p>supervisor Gordon Marr just got rejected by his own community</p>
<p>this November. And the new tough da Brooke Jenkins got reelected</p>
<p>in her own right after being appointed by London breed. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a long way to go in San Francisco. But there are</p>
<p>definitely some green shoes start that the electorate here</p>
<p>has had enough and is looking for the let&rsquo;s say called the</p>
<p>centrist Democrats as opposed to the radicals.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re in the lightning round here. We&rsquo;re in our three</p>
<p>of the all in podcast, marathon, this telethon.</p>
<p>Shemoth, you got a best turnaround for 2022. Hard, hard,</p>
<p>hard one to give. So any green shoots for 2022? As Saks would</p>
<p>say,</p>
<p>no, I mean, everything, everything is just called a</p>
<p>disaster.</p>
<p>Great. Freeberg, anything that you</p>
<p>there may be no turnaround award until 2025.</p>
<p>Fine. Okay. Yeah. We&rsquo;re gonna split on this freeberg. You got</p>
<p>your, your incisive fucking viewpoint. And I&rsquo;ll pick Zack</p>
<p>and meta that made so much sense.</p>
<p>At 94. It&rsquo;s at 117. It&rsquo;s one of my best j trades.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you also say Disney was your pick of the year or</p>
<p>something? I&rsquo;m buying more. I&rsquo;m buying more Disney. I&rsquo;m buying</p>
<p>more. This is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you Disney Warner, which you talked about before.</p>
<p>Yeah. And Facebook are three of my bit and, you know, are three</p>
<p>of my big ones. Let&rsquo;s say worst human being here.</p>
<p>Well, I think, look, given that this is supposed to be the year</p>
<ol start="2022">
<li>I mean, you got to say that. Yes. Sbf was the winner of</li>
</ol>
<p>this hands down.</p>
<p>Okay. Congratulations to Sbf. You are consensus worst human</p>
<p>being for this year. I mean, not ever, but only for this year.</p>
<p>Right? Yeah, we all hate you equally. Okay, who&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>number two? Why do you hate him? Why do I hate him? Because all</p>
<p>those people lost their money. And you know, there&rsquo;s some it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>causing chaos. I feel terrible for all these people who lost</p>
<p>money. That&rsquo;s why I hate him.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s disgusting. Did you see anybody have a second?</p>
<p>The two guys copped to please Caroline Ellison and Gary like</p>
<p>pancakes flip and but it turns out that they actually did</p>
<p>engineer a backdoor into FTX and has been doing this for years.</p>
<p>Oh my god. Oh my god. That&rsquo;s game over. You&rsquo;re getting 10</p>
<p>years. He&rsquo;s getting life game over.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re talking about an interesting defense strategy</p>
<p>that we were discussing in the chat. Oh, yeah. I think this is</p>
<p>actually a fascinating defense strategy. I think this is their</p>
<p>only shot. One of our besties had this theory that he was</p>
<p>prescribed to prescription drugs. One was Adderall. What</p>
<p>was the other one called? This was</p>
<p>he said, the patch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a drug I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with. I guess it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>patch. But when you combine these two things, apparently it</p>
<p>basically shuts down or kills the part of your brain that</p>
<p>deals with</p>
<p>inhibition inhibition. It&rsquo;s cocaine. Yeah. What if his</p>
<p>defense strategy was? Yeah, like only an insane person would do</p>
<p>this. And I was acting insane because I was prescribed these</p>
<p>drugs that had these drug conflicts. And it like killed</p>
<p>part of my brain. I mean, and you think about every criminal</p>
<p>on Wall Street said cocaine is my defense. But this you could</p>
<p>say he was maybe he was legally prescribed if you could show the</p>
<p>prescription. By the way, I&rsquo;m not saying yes, should get him</p>
<p>off. I&rsquo;m just, we&rsquo;re basically workshopping. What is the only</p>
<p>shot of his defense would be right?</p>
<p>Well, and think about it, sex. He acted manic after FTX</p>
<p>collapsed. So that mania of doing 20 Twitter spaces would be</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something so insane about what he did, right? That</p>
<p>you that all it&rsquo;s almost like a like a prescribed insanity</p>
<p>defense. Like I was prescribed a drug combination that made me</p>
<p>insane. Anybody have a most loathsome company has we wrapped</p>
<p>the only way that you could come up with that it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have to have two parents that were like law professors or</p>
<p>something. Right? Most most loathsome company. His defense,</p>
<p>you know, my parents boohoo. No, no, no, no, he&rsquo;ll claim</p>
<p>insanity. J. Cal, he&rsquo;ll say, of course, yeah. And they&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>fun. I mean, do we think that his parents aren&rsquo;t going to help</p>
<p>his defense?</p>
<p>You know, at this point, this, this kid&rsquo;s got to go away for</p>
<p>life. That&rsquo;s it. Well, I think it&rsquo;s got to be life. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be 30 plus years. I mean, it&rsquo;s just going to be</p>
<p>billions of dollars. What kind of justice system do we have?</p>
<p>When people go away for 2030? How many years per billion?</p>
<p>Would you sentence?</p>
<p>A decade per billion, at least? Yeah, I mean, just you got 100</p>
<p>years. Sax, you got to don&rsquo;t you think the justice system needs</p>
<p>to look at other people who are in jail for selling cocaine for</p>
<p>selling marijuana for for robbing a convenience store?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll put somebody away for robbing a convenience store for</p>
<p>a decade or two. Where do they get to put him in jail for just</p>
<p>because somebody came in with a gun and robbed a convenience</p>
<p>store, they get 20 years, this kid&rsquo;s gonna get off.</p>
<p>Screw that. Look, I think what do you guys think the over under</p>
<p>is here? You think it&rsquo;s like set it at I&rsquo;ll set it at 35 years.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll take the over. I&rsquo;ll take 30. I think this is made</p>
<p>off. I said a good line, then</p>
<p>which I think this is I think this is made off. No, I agree</p>
<p>over on 30. Yeah, I think I think I said 35. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be 100 multiple hundreds of years. I agree. And you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>gone for life. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s gonna be life. But I said a</p>
<p>good line. Okay, most slow some company is FDX. Anybody want to</p>
<p>go for a second?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ll add one. I&rsquo;m gonna this year, I&rsquo;m gonna give my last</p>
<p>year, I gave it to Tyson foods, one of the largest slaughter of</p>
<p>animals on earth. This year, I&rsquo;m going to give it to a company</p>
<p>called innovative i n o t IV. This is the company that was</p>
<p>busted by the feds for their animal abuse in their dog</p>
<p>breeding facility, where 4000 beagles were rescued, one of</p>
<p>which I adopted. And this is a publicly traded company stocks</p>
<p>down 90 some odd percent, which I&rsquo;m thrilled to see terrible</p>
<p>business, awful, awful, kind of, you know, inhumane behavior. And</p>
<p>so I want to kind of give them a special shout out this year.</p>
<p>Hmm, look at you. And you&rsquo;re getting the virtue signaling</p>
<p>points of rescuing the dog to increase your Q factor amongst</p>
<p>besties. Well done.</p>
<p>Max Q factor. Max Q factor. Max Q factor. Yeah. Anybody else have</p>
<p>a lonesome? Yes. I&rsquo;d like to pick this company zebra. Which</p>
<p>destroyed the environment for a bunch of endangered species that</p>
<p>I would otherwise have used for various for pelts for my</p>
<p>sweaters and such.</p>
<p>Yes. And I would like to go with blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>which was torturing puppies, 18 of which I rescued and I am now</p>
<p>have them in the J Cal puppy rescue. I am the most sensitive</p>
<p>and caring person. Also, I would like to add SeaWorld. I am in</p>
<p>the process of raising money to build bigger pools to eventually</p>
<p>release all the orcas in captivity. That is my new focus</p>
<p>for next year. Okay. Moving on. Oh, God, do we want to do best</p>
<p>meme? Do we want to do best new tech?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do best new tech. I don&rsquo;t have a best name.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going with fusion for best new tech. I&rsquo;m going with</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go with chat GPT. I think what was so impressive</p>
<p>about chat GPT and and the experience that everyone&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>using it is that it really for the first time I think</p>
<p>elucidated where these kind of machine learning tools can take</p>
<p>us and what the kind of new product experience can be what</p>
<p>generative AI can yield things beyond I think the scope of what</p>
<p>a lot of people were imagining before. So it was really so</p>
<p>revealing. And as you guys know, there&rsquo;s an absolute</p>
<p>friggin tidal wave of people trying to start companies that</p>
<p>are leveraging tools and generative AI to kind of</p>
<p>reinvent everything from what workplace tools, enterprise</p>
<p>software, all the way through to media games and entertainment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I think chat GPT was the most impressive new</p>
<p>technology new tech tomorrow 2020. And then sacks lightning</p>
<p>round, please best new tech</p>
<p>alpha fold three, which basically has almost near</p>
<p>perfect accuracy and protein folding sacks best new tech.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t improve on the chat GPT. So yeah, let&rsquo;s keep rolling.</p>
<p>Best trend best trend in business and in the world. Mine</p>
<p>is startups getting back and investors getting back to</p>
<p>reality and the what I call the age of austerity, the age of</p>
<p>focus after the age of excess. That&rsquo;s the best trend in our</p>
<p>world, the age of austerity, which are best trend for 2022</p>
<p>marginal cost of energy generation and storage is now in</p>
<p>the low single digit pennies per kilowatt hour, which basically</p>
<p>means that not only will energy be free and abundant, but it</p>
<p>will, I think over the next decade or two, create a massive</p>
<p>peace dividend, it will rewrite our foreign policy, it will</p>
<p>rewrite national security. That is the reason why people should</p>
<p>care about energy transition, not necessarily climate change,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s important. It&rsquo;s a distant second to keeping men</p>
<p>and women out of war, and keeping our borders safe.</p>
<p>Well said anybody else have a best trend?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pick it up. Last year, I said the creator economy, which</p>
<p>I think referred to all these kind of creators creating new</p>
<p>products and businesses beyond their content. This year, I</p>
<p>think that the trend that was again enabled and demonstrated</p>
<p>through chat GPT is the narrator economy. I think this is going</p>
<p>to be a really important trend going forward. We&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>it in the prediction episode. But I think the idea that people</p>
<p>are and they&rsquo;re starting to experience this and using chat</p>
<p>GPT and Dolly and other kind of generative AI tools is how much</p>
<p>you can kind of narrate the product you want to see created</p>
<p>and have it created for you on the fly. And I think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really kind of powerful mind shift for people and frame shift</p>
<p>for people. And I think it really starts to change a lot of</p>
<p>the way that people behave, entertain themselves, businesses</p>
<p>operate, and so on. So I&rsquo;d call it the narrator economy. And I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s really kind of starting to emerge.</p>
<p>Okay, do you have a trend? Sax?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say best friend is the growing realization that the</p>
<p>corporate media is failing does not tell the truth. It has an</p>
<p>agenda, more and more people are opting out of it and going with</p>
<p>independent media, I think, you know, what Elon mentioned, where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to start holding these corporate journalists, the</p>
<p>same standard on Twitter, as regular citizens, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>outraged by that. But that&rsquo;s a huge step in the right</p>
<p>direction. The fact of the matter is, is that the press or</p>
<p>the media is the prism through which reality is refracted. And</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not giving us an accurate representation of the</p>
<p>world, we can&rsquo;t begin to solve our problems, because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have accurate information. And I think more and more people are</p>
<p>waking up from the matrix and realizing that we&rsquo;re living in</p>
<p>this media controlled simulation. And again, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re going to make progress until the this power</p>
<p>that the media seems to have over our reality gets gets</p>
<p>broken.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go for worst trend. My worst trend is the Fed trying to</p>
<p>play catch up the Fed trying to play catch up. Sorry, buddy. The</p>
<p>Fed trying to play catch up is the worst trend for me</p>
<p>oversteering into the crash. What do you got Chamath for the</p>
<p>worst trend of 20?</p>
<p>Worst trend was the continued profligate spending by the</p>
<p>federal government. We have record deficits, record debt. And</p>
<p>this year, we&rsquo;re ending the year by adding another $1.65 trillion</p>
<p>of spending that nobody can seemingly account for. It is</p>
<p>truly the Christmas tree of Christmas trees in terms of</p>
<p>bills. So we just have not gotten religion yet around being</p>
<p>measured and how we spend money. Good one.</p>
<p>Worst trend sex.</p>
<p>Last year, my worst trend was authoritarianism growing all</p>
<p>over the world. And I think that&rsquo;s pretty decent prediction.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s worst trend is the government colluding with big</p>
<p>tech to engage in censorship. This is how they&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>the authoritarianism. We talked about it with Schellenberger and</p>
<p>Elon, this whole series revelations, notice the Twitter</p>
<p>files, we can see this collusion, this cozy relationship</p>
<p>between the censors at Twitter and big tech and the bureaucrats</p>
<p>at the FBI and DHS and Pentagon. This is a really disturbing</p>
<p>dystopian relationship, as we talked about earlier. And you</p>
<p>know, I feel like we spend all this time talking about the</p>
<p>authoritarianism in Russia, and China, we seem to be obsessed</p>
<p>with combating that and going to war with that. But we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>spend enough time talking about this growing authoritarianism at</p>
<p>home. The media doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to report on the Twitter</p>
<p>files at all. Let&rsquo;s focus on stopping authoritarianism here.</p>
<p>Well said Friedberg, what&rsquo;s your worst trend trend for 2022 is</p>
<p>what I would call interest rate mania. And I think that this is</p>
<p>the mania that we&rsquo;ve been caught up in on this show that other</p>
<p>people on our thread, people in the business community and the</p>
<p>investing community, where everyone&rsquo;s obsession with did</p>
<p>the Fed act soon enough or late enough, and that interest rates</p>
<p>ultimately drive success or failure with building businesses</p>
<p>and making good investments. All right. The truth is, when</p>
<p>interest rates go the wrong way, good investments, you know,</p>
<p>can kind of strengthen their way can can can make their way</p>
<p>through those environments, bad investments cannot, good</p>
<p>businesses can make their way through and bad investments</p>
<p>cannot. And so I think our mania around the fact that interest</p>
<p>rates and the Fed ultimately drove bad outcomes in businesses</p>
<p>and investments is a flawed kind of assertion. And we all want to</p>
<p>kind of get back to the drunken days, where, you know, a low</p>
<p>interest rate environment enables us all to be successful</p>
<p>and wealthy. And I think that that&rsquo;s kind of changed. So I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s time for us to get away from the interest rate</p>
<p>mania and focus more on solid investing and solid business</p>
<p>building. Okay, here we go lightning round. We got two to</p>
<p>go favorite media of 2022. For me, it was Top Gun, House of</p>
<p>the Dragon, White Lotus two, but I&rsquo;m going to pick my favorite</p>
<p>here, something you may not have heard of the film tar, I highly</p>
<p>recommend it. But I did like those other three tremendously.</p>
<p>What do you got sacks for your favorite media of 2022</p>
<p>House of the Dragon, I guess I enjoyed quite a bit. Like you</p>
<p>did. I&rsquo;ll give a shout out to my movie Dolly land, which will</p>
<p>be coming out next summer. If we&rsquo;re going to include podcast</p>
<p>episodes, I would give a shout out to the unheard episode where</p>
<p>Freddie Sayers interviews john Mearsheimer, the professor of</p>
<p>international relations. He explains the origins of the</p>
<p>Ukraine war and has some really pessimistic predictions about</p>
<p>what might happen next. I suggest everyone watch it if</p>
<p>they want to understand this conflict and where it may be</p>
<p>going next year.</p>
<p>Chamath, you have any favorite media for 2022? You want to</p>
<p>share? I thought Yellowstone kicked ass. Absolutely</p>
<p>incredible. There&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s on Hulu. But there&rsquo;s a show</p>
<p>with Steve Carell, a little short series called the patient,</p>
<p>which is about a serial killer that kidnaps his psychologist,</p>
<p>and locks him in his basement to try to help him prevent him</p>
<p>killing more people. I thought it was really, really well done.</p>
<p>Never have I ever, the latest season, another just brilliant</p>
<p>offering from Mindy Kaling. She&rsquo;s unbelievable. Those are</p>
<p>those are probably the top ones. What do you got? Freeberg? Any</p>
<p>media? Yeah, I read a book this year that I really liked. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the vital question by a guy named Nick Lane. Someone</p>
<p>recommended it to me. It&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s a biochemist and he kind of</p>
<p>talks a little bit about the origin of life on earth. It</p>
<p>really ties into this idea that there are certain call it</p>
<p>certain, call it principles of physics and statistics that make</p>
<p>life predictive and predictable. But I think the way that he kind</p>
<p>of walks through how a lot of things emerge in life. And how</p>
<p>life ultimately kind of developed on this planet are</p>
<p>really well shown. So yeah, I give I give his book a shout</p>
<p>out. It was it was a really good read. So that book, the vital</p>
<p>question is incredible. The other one that he wrote, which</p>
<p>is called life ascending. Those two books you must read if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be a Luddite, in my opinion. All right. I will</p>
<p>also also for those people who don&rsquo;t understand the difference</p>
<p>between power and energy, you will learn what that is very</p>
<p>good. I have two book recommendations putting the</p>
<p>rabbit in the hat is Brian Cox, you may know him from secession.</p>
<p>He has a great book and he reads the audio book very</p>
<p>enjoyable. I&rsquo;m halfway through Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s cinema</p>
<p>speculation and enjoying it very much. So you will enjoy it</p>
<p>tremendously. Okay. And now we do the Rudy Giuliani Award for</p>
<p>self immolation. This is for the person who poured lighter</p>
<p>fluid and gasoline over themselves and lit themselves on</p>
<p>fire for no apparent reason. I go with Kevin O&rsquo;Leary, who</p>
<p>secured a $15 million bag from FT x and then decided to try to</p>
<p>defend it. 18 ways to Sunday burning whatever reputation he</p>
<p>had. Who do you have in your Rudy Giuliani Award? This will</p>
<p>be controversial for you guys. I&rsquo;m going to go with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that he&rsquo;ll put himself in the position that he</p>
<p>did with bad intentions or without paying attention. I</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s taken on a role in buying and running Twitter. That</p>
<p>is, you know, principled. And, you know, in his mind, and many</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s minds, a really important role that someone</p>
<p>needs to play. Unfortunately, I think his reputation has gotten</p>
<p>really hurt. Because of, you know, that role, he&rsquo;s not making</p>
<p>a lot of friends. And he&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s causing a lot of</p>
<p>reputational damage. He obviously had a lot of good and</p>
<p>important things he was working on prior to taking on the</p>
<p>additional burden of Twitter. And while many people appreciate</p>
<p>his doing it, I think that it&rsquo;s causing him a lot of</p>
<p>reputational damage. And so yeah, I don&rsquo;t mean to kind of be</p>
<p>offensive in saying that, but I think he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s gotten the</p>
<p>biggest certainly been a hard thing to do. It&rsquo;s certainly been</p>
<p>a hard thing to do. But you&rsquo;re saying self immolation free</p>
<p>broke because he took it on himself. He could have just took</p>
<p>it on himself. Yeah, I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>interpretation. Yeah, it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not like the Rudy Giuliani</p>
<p>idiocy. I think he&rsquo;s taken on the burden of doing this. And I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s causing him a lot of reputation.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s an interpretation of the award. What do you got?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if if I were to interpret the award, I think the</p>
<p>way it was originally intended, I think I got to give it to</p>
<p>Herschel Walker this year, unfortunately, and I wish</p>
<p>Republicans would stop winning this award. At least, Herschel</p>
<p>never gave any speeches next to a dildo shop. But nonetheless,</p>
<p>I am so sorry that I&rsquo;m so delighted sacks that you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>so self aware about the follies of the dying maga. The last</p>
<p>throws of the maga nation. I want to find some Democrats to</p>
<p>give this to I want to give it to that brain dead senator from</p>
<p>Pennsylvania. What&rsquo;s his name? Fetterman Fetterman. Thank you.</p>
<p>I wanted to give it to Fetterman, but he won. So I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m supposed to do. You know, it&rsquo;s like no,</p>
<p>listen, when when a Republican self immolates like Rudy or</p>
<p>Herschel or something like that, they get laughed out of town.</p>
<p>And when the democrat does it like a Fetterman, they just get</p>
<p>elected. So I don&rsquo;t know what to say. All right, you got any</p>
<p>final words here? Good. I mean, and this episode is gonna be the</p>
<p>longest episode ever. Who think it&rsquo;s poor, poor producer, Nick,</p>
<p>whoever signed the papers for the whole search and seizure at</p>
<p>Mar-a-Lago looks kind of like an idiot. So that that was not</p>
<p>politically astute. Okay, I think you would say the FBI</p>
<p>then. Okay. poorly handled. That&rsquo;s actually a great. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a great one. Actually, if we&rsquo;re going to get serious for a</p>
<p>second, the combination of revelations, if we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>look over this whole year. Remember, Jason, when I I</p>
<p>basically spoke up at the time they raided Mar-a-Lago and said</p>
<p>that it was heavy handed and unnecessary. And now you guys</p>
<p>for years, Donald Trump is an idiot savant minus the savant.</p>
<p>Why all of you guys just project all of this like insane,</p>
<p>genius, evil level stuff. He&rsquo;s not capable of that. This is a</p>
<p>simpleton who likes attention. He stole a bunch of souvenirs</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t read when I was in my position hasn&rsquo;t read now</p>
<p>kept in a box downstairs just to say he had them. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly right. I was the one who championed the souvenir. I know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a souvenir guy. You said he was selling secrets to the</p>
<p>Saudis. No, I did not say that. I said it was souvenirs. No,</p>
<p>just did it. You said</p>
<p>hold on, you were turning Jared Kushner and elaborate</p>
<p>conspiracy theory. I&rsquo;m saying I know it&rsquo;s not a conspiracy</p>
<p>theory when you do it. And and guys, and this is the same</p>
<p>person that basically, in the in the beginning of his</p>
<p>presidential campaign in 2016, in front of Hillary Clinton</p>
<p>said, absolutely, I bend the laws that you created the tax</p>
<p>laws to my favor, because I&rsquo;m not stupid, when she called him</p>
<p>a tax dodger. And it turns out after all these years, he was</p>
<p>telling the truth. He basically, once again, the show</p>
<p>ends with Trump. He&rsquo;s been a great 2022. No, no, but</p>
<p>honestly, like, like, did we learn anything except that these</p>
<p>tax laws are egregiously stupid. And the only people that are</p>
<p>consistently guaranteed to make money in these tax laws are real</p>
<p>estate investors. If you put these two things together, a</p>
<p>real estate investor, who happened to be very poor at his</p>
<p>job, which Trump turned out to be packed billions of dollars</p>
<p>of NOLs that he was able to use to wash his taxes for years and</p>
<p>years. And by the way, and he was clearly proud of it. He was</p>
<p>just goading the Democrats in not releasing them. They went</p>
<p>through all this rigmarole. And what did we find out he had huge</p>
<p>NOLs. He had huge deductions, and he paid no taxes. Is that</p>
<p>shocking to any of us? It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like Chappelle said, he</p>
<p>came out of the house, told everyone everything you think is</p>
<p>going on inside that house is going on and went back and he</p>
<p>walked back inside the house. Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty great. Chappelle got it. All right, listen, for</p>
<p>David Sachs, the rain man, for the Queen of Quinoa, Sultan of</p>
<p>Science, David Friedberg, and the dictator himself, Chamath</p>
<p>Palihapitiya, it has been an honor and a privilege to do this</p>
<p>podcast with you gentlemen. This is the longest show in the</p>
<p>history of the pod. Enjoy everybody. R.I.P. Producer</p>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s next 48 hours and we&rsquo;ll see everybody next year.</p>
<p>Love you guys. Happy Holidays.</p>
<p>Love you bestest.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge</p>
<p>orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this like</p>
<p>sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
