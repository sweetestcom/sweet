    <p>The following is a conversation with Jeff Hawkins, a neuroscientist seeking to understand</p>
<p>the structure, function, and origin of intelligence in the human brain.</p>
<p>He previously wrote a seminal book on the subject titled On Intelligence, and recently a new book</p>
<p>called A Thousand Brains, which presents a new theory of intelligence that Richard Dawkins,</p>
<p>for example, has been raving about, calling the book quote brilliant and exhilarating.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t read those two words and not think of him saying it in his British accent.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Codecademy, Biooptimizers, ExpressVPN, Asleep, and Blinkist.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that one small but powerful idea that Jeff Hawkins mentions</p>
<p>in his new book is that if human civilization were to destroy itself, all of knowledge,</p>
<p>all our creations will go with us. He proposes that we should think about how to save that</p>
<p>knowledge in a way that long outlives us, whether that&rsquo;s on Earth, in orbit around Earth,</p>
<p>or in deep space, and then to send messages that advertise this backup of human knowledge</p>
<p>to other intelligent alien civilizations. The main message of this advertisement is not that</p>
<p>we are here, but that we were once here. This little difference somehow was deeply humbling</p>
<p>to me, that we may, with some nonzero likelihood, destroy ourselves, and that an alien civilization</p>
<p>thousands or millions of years from now may come across this knowledge store, and they</p>
<p>would only with some low probability even notice it, not to mention be able to interpret it.</p>
<p>And the deeper question here for me is what information in all of human knowledge is even</p>
<p>essential? Does Wikipedia capture it or not at all? This thought experiment forces me</p>
<p>to wonder what are the things we&rsquo;ve accomplished and are hoping to still accomplish that will</p>
<p>outlive us? Is it things like complex buildings, bridges, cars, rockets? Is it ideas like science,</p>
<p>physics, and mathematics? Is it music and art? Is it computers, computational systems,</p>
<p>or even artificial intelligence systems? I personally can&rsquo;t imagine that aliens wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>already have all of these things, in fact much more and much better. To me, the only</p>
<p>unique thing we may have is consciousness itself, and the actual subjective experience</p>
<p>and the actual subjective experience of suffering, of happiness, of hatred, of love. If we can</p>
<p>record these experiences in the highest resolution directly from the human brain, such that aliens</p>
<p>will be able to replay them, that is what we should store and send as a message. Not</p>
<p>Wikipedia, but the extremes of conscious experiences, the most important of which, of course, is</p>
<p>love. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Jeff Hawkins.</p>
<p>We previously talked over two years ago. Do you think there&rsquo;s still neurons in your brain</p>
<p>that remember that conversation, that remember me and got excited? Like there&rsquo;s a Lex neuron</p>
<p>in your brain that just like finally has a purpose? I do remember our conversation. I</p>
<p>have some memories of it, and I formed additional memories of you in the meantime. I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say there&rsquo;s a neuron or neurons in my brain that know you. There are synapses in my brain</p>
<p>that have formed that reflect my knowledge of you and the model I have of you in the</p>
<p>world. Whether the exact same synapses were formed two years ago, it&rsquo;s hard to say because</p>
<p>these things come and go all the time. One of the things to know about brains is that</p>
<p>when you think of things, you often erase the memory and rewrite it again. Yes, but I have</p>
<p>a memory of you, and that&rsquo;s instantiated in synapses. There&rsquo;s a simpler way to think about</p>
<p>it. We have a model of the world in your head, and that model is continually being updated.</p>
<p>I updated this morning. You offered me this water. You said it was from the refrigerator.</p>
<p>I remember these things. The model includes where we live, the places we know, the words,</p>
<p>the objects in the world. It&rsquo;s a monstrous model, and it&rsquo;s constantly being updated.</p>
<p>People are just part of that model. Our animals, our other physical objects, our events we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done. In my mind, it&rsquo;s no special place for the memories of humans. Obviously, I know a lot about</p>
<p>my wife and friends and so on, but it&rsquo;s not like a special place for humans or over here.</p>
<p>We model everything, and we model other people&rsquo;s behaviors too. If I said there&rsquo;s a copy of your</p>
<p>mind in my mind, it&rsquo;s just because I&rsquo;ve learned how humans behave, and I&rsquo;ve learned some things</p>
<p>about you, and that&rsquo;s part of my world model. Well, I just also mean the collective intelligence</p>
<p>of the human species. I wonder if there&rsquo;s something fundamental to the brain that enables that,</p>
<p>so modeling other humans with their ideas. You&rsquo;re actually jumping into a lot of big</p>
<p>topics. Collective intelligence is a separate topic that a lot of people like to talk about.</p>
<p>We could talk about that. That&rsquo;s interesting. We&rsquo;re not just individuals. We live in society</p>
<p>and so on. From our research point of view, again, let&rsquo;s just talk. We studied the neocortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sheet of neural tissue. It&rsquo;s about 75% of your brain. It runs on this very repetitive</p>
<p>algorithm. It&rsquo;s a very repetitive circuit. You can apply that algorithm to lots of different</p>
<p>problems, but underneath, it&rsquo;s the same thing. We&rsquo;re just building this model. From our point</p>
<p>of view, we wouldn&rsquo;t look for these special circuits someplace buried in your brain that</p>
<p>might be related to understanding other humans. It&rsquo;s more like, how do we build a model of</p>
<p>anything? How do we understand anything in the world? Humans are just another part of</p>
<p>the things we understand. There&rsquo;s nothing to the brain that knows the</p>
<p>emergent phenomena of collective intelligence. Well, I certainly know about that. I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>the terms, I&rsquo;ve read. No, but that&rsquo;s as an idea.</p>
<p>Well, I think we have language, which is built into our brains. That&rsquo;s a key part of collective</p>
<p>intelligence. There are some prior assumptions about the world we&rsquo;re going to live in. When</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re born, we&rsquo;re not just a blank slate. Did we evolve to take advantage of those situations?</p>
<p>Yes. Again, we study only part of the brain, the neocortex. There&rsquo;s other parts of the</p>
<p>brain that are very much involved in societal interactions and human emotions and how we</p>
<p>interact and even societal issues about how we interact with other people, when we support</p>
<p>them, when we&rsquo;re greedy and things like that. Certainly, the brain is a great place</p>
<p>where to study intelligence. I wonder if it&rsquo;s the fundamental atom of intelligence.</p>
<p>Well, I would say it&rsquo;s absolutely in a central component, even if you believe in collective</p>
<p>intelligence as, hey, that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s all happening. That&rsquo;s what we need to study,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t believe that, by the way. I think it&rsquo;s really important, but I don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>is the thing. Even if you do believe that, then you have to understand how the brain works in</p>
<p>doing that. It&rsquo;s more like we are intelligent individuals and together, we are much more</p>
<p>magnified, our intelligence. We can do things that we couldn&rsquo;t do individually, but even as</p>
<p>individuals, we&rsquo;re pretty damn smart and we can model things and understand the world and interact</p>
<p>with it. To me, if you&rsquo;re going to start someplace, you need to start with the brain. Then you could</p>
<p>say, well, how do brains interact with each other? What is the nature of language? How do we share</p>
<p>models that I&rsquo;ve learned something about the world, how do I share it with you? Which is really</p>
<p>what sort of communal intelligence is. I know something, you know something. We&rsquo;ve had different</p>
<p>experiences in the world. I&rsquo;ve learned something about brains. Maybe I can impart that to you. You&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned something about physics and you can impart that to me. Even just the epistemological</p>
<p>question of, well, what is knowledge and how do you represent it in the brain? That&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to reside for in our writings. It&rsquo;s obvious that human collaboration, human interaction</p>
<p>is how we build societies. But some of the things you talk about and work on,</p>
<p>some of those elements of what makes up an intelligent entity is there with a single person.</p>
<p>Absolutely. I mean, we can&rsquo;t deny that the brain is the core element here. At least I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obvious. The brain is the core element in all theories of intelligence. It&rsquo;s where knowledge</p>
<p>is represented. It&rsquo;s where knowledge is created. We interact, we share, we build upon each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>work. But without a brain, you&rsquo;d have nothing. There would be no intelligence without brains.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where we start. I got into this field because I just was curious as to who I am.</p>
<p>How do I think? What&rsquo;s going on in my head when I&rsquo;m thinking? What does it mean to know something?</p>
<p>I can ask what it means for me to know something independent of how I learned it from you or from</p>
<p>someone else or from society. What does it mean for me to know that I have a model of you in my</p>
<p>head? What does it mean to know I know what this microphone does and how it works physically,</p>
<p>even when I can&rsquo;t see right now? How do I know that? What does it mean? How the neurons do that</p>
<p>at the fundamental level of neurons and synapses and so on? Those are really fascinating questions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to be just happy to understand those if I could.</p>
<p>So in your new book, you talk about our brain, our mind as being made up of many brains.</p>
<p>So the book is called A Thousand Brain Theory of Intelligence. What is the key idea of this book?</p>
<p>The book has three sections and it has sort of maybe three big ideas. So the first section is</p>
<p>all about what we&rsquo;ve learned about the neocortex and that&rsquo;s the thousand brains theory. Just to</p>
<p>complete the picture, the second section is all about AI and the third section is about the future</p>
<p>of humanity. So the thousand brains theory, the big idea there, if I had to summarize into one</p>
<p>big idea, is that we think of the brain, the neocortex as learning this model of the world.</p>
<p>But what we learned is actually there&rsquo;s tens of thousands of independent modeling systems going</p>
<p>on. And so each, we call the column in the cortex is about 150,000 of them, is a complete modeling</p>
<p>system. So it&rsquo;s a collective intelligence in your head in some sense. So the thousand brains theory</p>
<p>says, well, where do I have knowledge about this coffee cup or where&rsquo;s the model of this cell phone?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in one place. It&rsquo;s in thousands of separate models that are complimentary and</p>
<p>they communicate with each other through voting. So this idea that we feel like we&rsquo;re one person,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our experience. We can explain that. But reality, there&rsquo;s lots of these, it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>little brains, but they&rsquo;re sophisticated modeling systems, about 150,000 of them in each human</p>
<p>brain. And that&rsquo;s a total different way of thinking about how the neocortex is structured</p>
<p>than we or anyone else thought of even just five years ago. So you mentioned you started</p>
<p>this journey just looking in the mirror and trying to understand who you are.</p>
<p>So if you have many brains, who are you then? So it&rsquo;s interesting. We have a singular perception,</p>
<p>right? We think, oh, I&rsquo;m just here. I&rsquo;m looking at you. But it&rsquo;s composed of all these things,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s sounds and there&rsquo;s vision and there&rsquo;s touch and all kinds of inputs. Yeah,</p>
<p>we have the singular perception. And what the thousand brain theory says, we have these models</p>
<p>that are visual models. We have a lot of models that are auditory models, models that talk to</p>
<p>models and so on, but they vote. And so these things in the cortex, you can think about these</p>
<p>columns as like little grains of rice, 150,000 stacked next to each other. And each one is its</p>
<p>own little modeling system, but they have these long range connections that go between them.</p>
<p>And we call those voting connections or voting neurons. And so the different columns try to</p>
<p>reach a consensus. Like, what am I looking at? Okay. Each one has some ambiguity, but they come</p>
<p>to a consensus. Oh, there&rsquo;s a water bottle I&rsquo;m looking at. We are only consciously able to</p>
<p>perceive the voting. We&rsquo;re not able to perceive anything that goes on under the hood. So the</p>
<p>voting is what we&rsquo;re aware of. The results of the vote.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, you can imagine it this way. We were just talking about eye movements a moment ago. So</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m looking at something, my eyes are moving about three times a second. And with each movement,</p>
<p>a completely new input is coming into the brain. It&rsquo;s not repetitive. It&rsquo;s not shifting it around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally unaware of it. I can&rsquo;t perceive it. But yet if I looked at the neurons in your brain,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going on and off, on and off, on and off, on and off. But the voting neurons are not.</p>
<p>The voting neurons are saying, we all agree, even though I&rsquo;m looking at different parts of this,</p>
<p>this is a water bottle right now. And that&rsquo;s not changing. And it&rsquo;s in some position and</p>
<p>pose relative to me. So I have this perception of the water bottle about two feet away from me</p>
<p>at a certain pose to me. That is not changing. That&rsquo;s the only part I&rsquo;m aware of. I can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>aware of the fact that the inputs from the eyes are moving and changing and all this other tapping.</p>
<p>So these long range connections are the part we can be conscious of. The individual activity in</p>
<p>each column doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere else. It doesn&rsquo;t get shared anywhere else. There&rsquo;s no way to extract</p>
<p>it and talk about it or extract it and even remember it to say, oh, yes, I can recall that.</p>
<p>But these long range connections are the things that are accessible to language and to our,</p>
<p>like the hippocampus, our memories, our short term memory systems and so on. So we&rsquo;re not aware of</p>
<p>95% or maybe it&rsquo;s even 98% of what&rsquo;s going on in your brain. We&rsquo;re only aware of this sort of</p>
<p>stable, somewhat stable voting outcome of all these things that are going on underneath the hood.</p>
<p>So what would you say is the basic element in the thousand brains theory of intelligence</p>
<p>of intelligence? Like what&rsquo;s the atom of intelligence when you think about it? Is it</p>
<p>the individual brains and then what is a brain? Well, let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s, can we just talk about what</p>
<p>intelligence is first and then, and then we can talk about the elements are. So in my, in my book,</p>
<p>intelligence is the ability to learn a model of the world, to build internal to your head,</p>
<p>a model that represents the structure of everything, you know, to know what this is a</p>
<p>table and that&rsquo;s a coffee cup and this is a gooseneck lamp and all this to know these things.</p>
<p>I have to have a model of it in my head. I just don&rsquo;t look at them and go, what is that?</p>
<p>I already have internal representations of these things in my head and I had to learn them. I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>born of any of that knowledge. You were, you know, we have some lights in the room here. I, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not part of my evolutionary heritage, right? It&rsquo;s not in my genes. So, um, we have this</p>
<p>incredible model and the model includes not only what things look like and feel like, but where</p>
<p>they are relative to each other and how they behave. I&rsquo;ve never picked up this water bottle</p>
<p>before, but I know that if I took my hand on that blue thing and I turn it, it&rsquo;ll probably make a</p>
<p>funny little sound as the little plastic things detach and then it&rsquo;ll rotate and it&rsquo;ll rotate a</p>
<p>certain way and it&rsquo;ll come off. How do I know that? Because I have this model in my head.</p>
<p>So the essence of intelligence as our ability to learn a model and the more sophisticated our</p>
<p>model is, the smarter we are. Uh, not that there is a single intelligence, because you can know</p>
<p>about, you know, a lot about things that I don&rsquo;t know. And I know about things you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And we can both be very smart, but we both learned a model of the world through interacting with it.</p>
<p>So that is the essence of intelligence. Then we can ask ourselves, what are the mechanisms in the</p>
<p>brain that allow us to do that? And what are the mechanisms of learning, not just the neural</p>
<p>mechanisms, what are the general process by how we learn a model? So that was a big insight for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what are the, what is the actual things that, how do you learn this stuff? It turns out</p>
<p>you have to learn it through movement. Um, you can&rsquo;t learn it just by that&rsquo;s how we learn. We</p>
<p>learn through movement. We learn. Um, so you build up this model by observing things and</p>
<p>touching them and moving them and walking around the world and so on. So either you move or the</p>
<p>thing moves somehow. Yeah. You obviously can learn things just by reading a book, something like that.</p>
<p>But think about if I were to say, oh, here&rsquo;s a new house. I want you to learn, you know,</p>
<p>what do you do? You have to walk, you have to walk from room to the room. You have to open the doors,</p>
<p>look around, see what&rsquo;s on the left, what&rsquo;s on the right. As you do this, you&rsquo;re building a model in</p>
<p>your head. It&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing. You can&rsquo;t just sit there and say, I&rsquo;m going to grok</p>
<p>the house. No. You know, or you can do it. You don&rsquo;t even want to just sit down and read some</p>
<p>description of it, right? Yeah. You literally physically interact. The same with like a smartphone.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to learn a new app, I touch it and I move things around. I see what happens when I,</p>
<p>when I do things with it. So that&rsquo;s the basic way we learn in the world. And by the way,</p>
<p>when you say model, you mean something that can be used for prediction in the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used for prediction and for behavior and planning. Right. And does a pretty good job</p>
<p>doing so. Yeah. Here&rsquo;s the way to think about the model. A lot of people get hung up on this. So</p>
<p>you can imagine an architect making a model of a house, right? So there&rsquo;s a physical model that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>small. And why do they do that? Well, we do that because you can imagine what it would look like</p>
<p>from different angles. Okay. Look from here, look from there. And you can also say, well,</p>
<p>how, how far to get from the garage to the, to the swimming pool or something like that. Right. You</p>
<p>can imagine looking at this and you can say, what would be the view from this location? So we build</p>
<p>these physical models to let you imagine the future and imagine behaviors. Now we can take</p>
<p>that same model and put it in a computer. So we now, today they&rsquo;ll build models of houses in a</p>
<p>computer and they, and they do that using a set of, we&rsquo;ll come back to this term in a moment,</p>
<p>reference frames, but basically you assign a reference frame for the palace and you assign</p>
<p>different things for the house in different locations. And then the computer can generate</p>
<p>an image and say, okay, this is what it looks like in this direction. The brain is doing something</p>
<p>remarkably similar to this surprising. It&rsquo;s using reference frames. It&rsquo;s building these,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s similar to a model on a computer, which has the same benefits of building a physical model.</p>
<p>It allows me to say, what would this thing look like if it was in this orientation? What would</p>
<p>likely happen if I push this button? I&rsquo;ve never pushed this button before, or how would I accomplish</p>
<p>something? I want to, I want to convey a new idea I&rsquo;ve learned. How would I do that? I can imagine</p>
<p>in my head, well, I could talk about it. I could write a book. I could do some podcasts. I could,</p>
<p>you know, maybe tell my neighbor, you know, and I can imagine the outcomes of all these things</p>
<p>before I do any of them. That&rsquo;s what the model lets you do. It lets us plan the future and</p>
<p>imagine the consequences of our actions. Prediction, you asked about prediction. Prediction</p>
<p>is not the goal of the model. Prediction is an inherent property of it, and it&rsquo;s how the model</p>
<p>corrects itself. So prediction is fundamental to intelligence. It&rsquo;s fundamental to building a model,</p>
<p>and the model&rsquo;s intelligent. And let me go back and be very precise about this. Prediction,</p>
<p>you can think of prediction two ways. One is like, hey, what would happen if I did this? That&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>type of prediction. That&rsquo;s a key part of intelligence. But using prediction is like, oh,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s this water bottle going to feel like when I pick it up, you know? And that doesn&rsquo;t seem very</p>
<p>intelligent. But one way to think about prediction is it&rsquo;s a way for us to learn where our model is</p>
<p>wrong. So if I picked up this water bottle and it felt hot, I&rsquo;d be very surprised. Or if I picked</p>
<p>it up and it was very light, I&rsquo;d be surprised. Or if I turned this top and I had to turn it the other</p>
<p>way, I&rsquo;d be surprised. And so all those might have a prediction like, okay, I&rsquo;m going to do it. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>drink some water. I&rsquo;m okay. Okay, I do this. There it is. I feel opening, right? What if I had to turn</p>
<p>it the other way? Or what if it&rsquo;s split in two? Then I say, oh my gosh, I misunderstood this. I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have the right model of this thing. My attention would be drawn to it. I&rsquo;d be looking at</p>
<p>it going, well, how the hell did that happen? Why did it open up that way? And I would update my</p>
<p>model by doing it. Just by looking at it and playing around with that update and say, this is</p>
<p>a new type of water bottle. So you&rsquo;re talking about sort of complicated things like a water bottle,</p>
<p>but this also applies for just basic vision, just like seeing things. It&rsquo;s almost like a</p>
<p>precondition of just perceiving the world is predicting it. So just everything that you see</p>
<p>is first passed through your prediction. Everything you see and feel. In fact,</p>
<p>this was the insight I had back in the early 80s. And I know that people have reached the same idea</p>
<p>is that every sensory input you get, not just vision, but touch and hearing, you have an</p>
<p>expectation about it and a prediction. Sometimes you can predict very accurately. Sometimes you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t predict what next word is going to come out of your mouth. But as you start talking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get better and better predictions. And if you talk about some topics, I&rsquo;d be very surprised.</p>
<p>So I have this sort of background prediction that&rsquo;s going on all the time for all of my senses.</p>
<p>Again, the way I think about that is this is how we learn. It&rsquo;s more about how we learn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a test of our understanding. Our predictions are a test. Is this really a water bottle? If it</p>
<p>is, I shouldn&rsquo;t see a little finger sticking out the side. And if I saw a little finger sticking</p>
<p>out, I was like, oh, what the hell&rsquo;s going on? That&rsquo;s not normal. I mean, that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>that&hellip; Let me linger on this for a second. It really honestly feels that prediction is</p>
<p>fundamental to everything, to the way our mind operates, to intelligence. So it&rsquo;s just a different</p>
<p>way to see intelligence, which is like everything starts a prediction. And prediction requires a</p>
<p>model. You can&rsquo;t predict something unless you have a model of it. Right. But the action is</p>
<p>prediction. So the thing the model does is prediction. But it also&hellip; Yeah. But you can</p>
<p>then extend it to things like, oh, what would happen if I took this today? I went and did this.</p>
<p>What would be likely? Or how&hellip; You can extend prediction to like, oh, I want to get a promotion</p>
<p>at work. What action should I take? And you can say, if I did this, I predict what might happen.</p>
<p>If I spoke to someone, I predict what might happen. So it&rsquo;s not just low level predictions.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s all predictions. It&rsquo;s all predictions. It&rsquo;s like this black box so you can ask basically</p>
<p>any question, low level or high level. So we started off with that observation. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this nonstop prediction. And I write about this in the book. And then we asked, how do neurons</p>
<p>actually make predictions physically? Like what does the neuron do when it makes a prediction?</p>
<p>Or the neural tissue does when it makes a prediction. And then we asked, what are the</p>
<p>mechanisms by how we build a model that allows you to make predictions? So we started with prediction</p>
<p>as sort of the fundamental research agenda, if in some sense. And say, well, we understand how</p>
<p>the brain makes predictions. We&rsquo;ll understand how it builds these models and how it learns.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the core of intelligence. So it was the key that got us in the door</p>
<p>to say, that is our research agenda. Understand predictions.</p>
<p>So in this whole process, where does intelligence originate, would you say?</p>
<p>So if we look at things that are much less intelligence to humans and you start to build</p>
<p>up a human through the process of evolution, where&rsquo;s this magic thing that has a prediction</p>
<p>model or a model that&rsquo;s able to predict that starts to look a lot more like intelligence?</p>
<p>Is there a place where Richard Dawkins wrote an introduction to your book, an excellent</p>
<p>introduction? I mean, it&rsquo;s, it puts a lot of things into context and it&rsquo;s funny just looking</p>
<p>at parallels for your book and Darwin&rsquo;s Origin of Species. So Darwin wrote about the origin</p>
<p>of species. So what is the origin of intelligence?</p>
<p>Well, we have a theory about it and it&rsquo;s just that, it&rsquo;s a theory. The theory goes as follows.</p>
<p>As soon as living things started to move, they&rsquo;re not just floating in sea, they&rsquo;re not just a</p>
<p>plant, you know, grounded someplace. As soon as they started to move, there was an advantage to</p>
<p>moving intelligently, to moving in certain ways. And there&rsquo;s some very simple things you can do,</p>
<p>you know, bacteria or single cell organisms can move towards the source of gradient of</p>
<p>food or something like that. But an animal that might know where it is and know where it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>and how to get back to that place, or an animal that might say, oh, there was a source of food</p>
<p>someplace, how do I get to it? Or there was a danger, how do I get to it? There was a mate, how</p>
<p>do I get to them? There was a big evolutionary advantage to that. So early on, there was a</p>
<p>pressure to start understanding your environment, like where am I and where have I been? And what</p>
<p>happened in those different places? So we still have this neural mechanism in our brains. In the</p>
<p>mammals, it&rsquo;s in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, these are older parts of the brain.</p>
<p>And these are very well studied. We build a map of the of our environment. So these neurons in</p>
<p>these parts of the brain know where I am in this room, and where the door was and things like that.</p>
<p>So a lot of other mammals have this?</p>
<p>All mammals have this, right? And almost any animal that knows where it is, and get around</p>
<p>must have some mapping system, must have some way of saying, I&rsquo;ve learned a map of my environment,</p>
<p>I have hummingbirds in my backyard. And they go to the same places all the time. They must know</p>
<p>where they are. They just know where they are when they&rsquo;re not just randomly flying around. They</p>
<p>know. They know particular flowers they come back to. So we all have this. And it turns out it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very tricky to get neurons to do this, to build a map of an environment. And so we now know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these famous studies that are still very active about place cells and grid cells and these</p>
<p>other types of cells in the older parts of the brain, and how they build these maps of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really clever. It&rsquo;s obviously been under a lot of evolutionary pressure over a long period</p>
<p>of time to get good at this. So animals now know where they are. What we think has happened,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence to suggest this, is that that mechanism we learned to map,</p>
<p>like a space, was repackaged. The same type of neurons was repackaged into a more compact form.</p>
<p>And that became the cortical column. And it was in some sense, genericized, if that&rsquo;s a word. It</p>
<p>was turned into a very specific thing about learning maps of environments to learning maps</p>
<p>of anything, learning a model of anything, not just your space, but coffee cups and so on. And</p>
<p>it got sort of repackaged into a more compact version, a more universal version,</p>
<p>and then replicated. So the reason we&rsquo;re so flexible is we have a very generic version of</p>
<p>this mapping algorithm, and we have 150,000 copies of it. Sounds a lot like the progress</p>
<p>of deep learning. How so? So take neural networks that seem to work well for a specific task,</p>
<p>compress them, and multiply it by a lot. And then you just stack them on top of it. It&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>story of transformers in natural language processing. Yeah. But in deep learning networks,</p>
<p>they end up, you&rsquo;re replicating an element, but you still need the entire network to do anything.</p>
<p>Right. Here, what&rsquo;s going on, each individual element is a complete learning system. This is</p>
<p>why I can take a human brain, cut it in half, and it still works. It&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing. It&rsquo;s fundamentally distributed. It&rsquo;s fundamentally distributed,</p>
<p>complete modeling systems. But that&rsquo;s our story we like to tell. I would guess it&rsquo;s likely largely</p>
<p>right. But there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence supporting that story, this evolutionary story. The thing</p>
<p>which brought me to this idea is that the human brain got big very quickly. So that led to the</p>
<p>proposal a long time ago that, well, there&rsquo;s this common element just instead of creating</p>
<p>new things, it just replicated something. We also are extremely flexible. We can learn things that</p>
<p>we had no history about. And that tells it that the learning algorithm is very generic. It&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>kind of universal because it doesn&rsquo;t assume any prior knowledge about what it&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>And so you combine those things together and you say, okay, well, how did that come about? Where</p>
<p>did that universal algorithm come from? It had to come from something that wasn&rsquo;t universal. It</p>
<p>came from something that was more specific. So anyway, this led to our hypothesis that</p>
<p>you would find grid cells and place cell equivalents in the neocortex. And when we</p>
<p>first published our first papers on this theory, we didn&rsquo;t know of evidence for that. It turns out</p>
<p>there was some, but we didn&rsquo;t know about it. So then we became aware of evidence for grid</p>
<p>cells in parts of the neocortex. And then now there&rsquo;s been new evidence coming out. There&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>interesting papers that came out just January of this year. So one of our predictions was if this</p>
<p>evolutionary hypothesis is correct, we would see grid cell place cell equivalents, cells that work</p>
<p>like them through every column in the neocortex. And that&rsquo;s starting to be seen. What does it mean</p>
<p>that, why is it important that they&rsquo;re present? Because it tells us, well, we&rsquo;re asking about the</p>
<p>evolutionary origin of intelligence, right? So our theory is that these columns in the cortex</p>
<p>are working on the same principles, they&rsquo;re modeling systems. And it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how</p>
<p>neurons do this. And so we said, hey, it&rsquo;s really hard to imagine how neurons could learn these</p>
<p>models of things. We can talk about the details of that if you want. But there&rsquo;s this other part</p>
<p>of the brain, we know that learns models of environments. So could that mechanism to learn</p>
<p>to model this room be used to learn to model the water bottle? Is it the same mechanism? So we said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more likely the brain&rsquo;s using the same mechanism, which case it would have these equivalent</p>
<p>cell types. So it&rsquo;s basically the whole theory is built on the idea that these columns have</p>
<p>reference frames and they&rsquo;re learning these models and these grid cells create these reference frames.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically the major, in some sense, the major predictive part of this theory is that we</p>
<p>will find these equivalent mechanisms in each column in the neocortex, which tells us that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing. They&rsquo;re learning these sensory motor models of the world. So we&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>confident that would happen, but now we&rsquo;re seeing the evidence. So the evolutionary process, nature</p>
<p>does a lot of copy and paste and see what happens. Yeah. Yeah. There&rsquo;s no direction to it. But it</p>
<p>just found out like, hey, if I took these elements and made more of them, what happens? And let&rsquo;s hook</p>
<p>them up to the eyes and let&rsquo;s hook them to ears. And that seems to work pretty well for us. Again,</p>
<p>just to take a quick step back to our conversation of collective intelligence.</p>
<p>Do you sometimes see that as just another copy and paste aspect is copying and pasting</p>
<p>these brains and humans and making a lot of them and then creating social structures that then</p>
<p>almost operate as a single brain? I wouldn&rsquo;t have said that, but you said it sounded pretty good.</p>
<p>So to you, the brain is its own thing.</p>
<p>I mean, our goal is to understand how the neocortex works. We can argue how essential</p>
<p>that is to understand the human brain because it&rsquo;s not the entire human brain. You can argue</p>
<p>how essential that is to understanding human intelligence. You can argue how essential this</p>
<p>is to sort of communal intelligence. Our goal was to understand the neocortex.</p>
<p>Yeah. So what is the neocortex and where does it fit</p>
<p>in the various aspects of what the brain does? Like how important is it to you?</p>
<p>Well, obviously, again, I mentioned again in the beginning, it&rsquo;s about 70 to 75% of the volume of</p>
<p>the human brain. So it dominates our brain in terms of size. Not in terms of number of neurons,</p>
<p>but in terms of size.</p>
<p>Size isn&rsquo;t everything, Jeff.</p>
<p>I know, but it&rsquo;s not that. We know that all high level vision,</p>
<p>hearing, and touch happens in the neocortex. We know that all language occurs and is understood</p>
<p>in the neocortex, whether that&rsquo;s spoken language, written language, sign language,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s language of mathematics, language of physics, music. We know that all high level</p>
<p>planning and thinking occurs in the neocortex. If I were to say, what part of your brain designed</p>
<p>a computer and understands programming and creates music? It&rsquo;s all the neocortex.</p>
<p>So then that&rsquo;s an undeniable fact. But then there&rsquo;s other parts of our brain are important too,</p>
<p>right? Our emotional states, our body regulating our body. So the way I like to look at it is,</p>
<p>can you understand the neocortex without the rest of the brain? And some people say you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and I think absolutely you can. It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re not interacting, but you can understand.</p>
<p>Can you understand the neocortex without understanding the emotions of fear? Yes,</p>
<p>you can. You can understand how the system works. It&rsquo;s just a modeling system. I make the analogy</p>
<p>in the book that it&rsquo;s like a map of the world, and how that map is used depends on who&rsquo;s using it.</p>
<p>So how our map of our world in our neocortex, how we manifest as a human depends on the rest of our</p>
<p>brain. What are our motivations? What are my desires? Am I a nice guy or not a nice guy?</p>
<p>Am I a cheater or not a cheater? How important different things are in my life?</p>
<p>But the neocortex can be understood on its own. And I say that as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s all these interactions, and I don&rsquo;t want to say I don&rsquo;t know them and we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think about them. But from a layperson&rsquo;s point of view, you can say it&rsquo;s a modeling system.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t generally think too much about the communal aspect of intelligence, which you brought up a</p>
<p>number of times already. So that&rsquo;s not really been my concern.</p>
<p>I just wonder if there&rsquo;s a continuum from the origin of the universe, like</p>
<p>this pockets of complexities that form living organisms. I wonder if we&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>if you look at humans, we feel like we&rsquo;re at the top. And I wonder if there&rsquo;s like just,</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s like just where everybody probably every living type pocket of complexity</p>
<p>probably thinks they&rsquo;re the, pardon the French, they&rsquo;re the shit. They&rsquo;re at the top of the</p>
<p>pyramid. Well, if they&rsquo;re thinking. Well, then what is thinking? In this sense,</p>
<p>the whole point is in their sense of the world, their sense is that they&rsquo;re at the top of it.</p>
<p>I think what is a turtle, but you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re bringing up, you know,</p>
<p>the problems of complexity and complexity theory are, you know, it&rsquo;s a huge,</p>
<p>interesting problem in science. Um, and you know, I think we&rsquo;ve made surprisingly little progress</p>
<p>and understanding complex systems in general. Um, and so, you know, the Santa Fe Institute was</p>
<p>founded to study this and even the scientists there will say, it&rsquo;s really hard. We haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really been able to figure out exactly, you know, that science hasn&rsquo;t really congealed yet. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still trying to figure out the basic elements of that science. Uh, what, you know, where does</p>
<p>complexity come from and what is it and how you define it, whether it&rsquo;s DNA creating bodies or</p>
<p>phenotypes or it&rsquo;s individuals creating societies or ants and, you know, markets and so on. It&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very complex thing. I&rsquo;m not a complexity theorist person, right? Um, and I, I think you</p>
<p>should ask, well, the brain itself is a complex system. So can we understand that? Um, I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress understanding how the brain works. So, uh, but I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>brought it out to like, oh, well, where are we on the complexity spectrum? You know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>um, it&rsquo;s a great question. I&rsquo;d prefer for that answer to be we&rsquo;re not special. It seems like</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re honest, most likely we&rsquo;re not special. So if there is a spectrum or probably not in some</p>
<p>kind of significant place, there&rsquo;s one thing we could say that we are special. And again,</p>
<p>only here on earth, I&rsquo;m not saying is that if we think about knowledge, what we know,</p>
<p>um, we clearly human brains have, um, the only brains that have a certain types of knowledge.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the only brains on this earth to understand, uh, what the earth is, how old it is,</p>
<p>that the universe is a picture as a whole with the only organisms understand DNA and</p>
<p>the origins of, you know, of species. Uh, no other species on, on this planet has that knowledge.</p>
<p>So if we think about, I like to think about, you know, one of the endeavors of humanity is to</p>
<p>understand the universe as much as we can. Um, I think our species is further along in that</p>
<p>undeniably, um, whether our theories are right or wrong, we can debate, but at least we have</p>
<p>theories. You know, we, we know that what the sun is and how its fusion is and how what black holes</p>
<p>are and, you know, we know general theory of relativity and no other animal has any of this</p>
<p>knowledge. So in that sense that we&rsquo;re special, uh, are we special in terms of the hierarchy of</p>
<p>complexity in the universe? Probably not. Can we look at a neuron? Yeah. You say that prediction</p>
<p>happens in the neuron. What does that mean? So the neuron traditionally is seen as the</p>
<p>basic element of the brain. So we, I mentioned this earlier that prediction was our research agenda.</p>
<p>Yeah. We said, okay, um, how does the brain make a prediction? Like I I&rsquo;m about to grab this water</p>
<p>bottle and my brain is predicting what I&rsquo;m going to feel on, on all my parts of my fingers. If I</p>
<p>felt something really odd on any part here, I&rsquo;d notice it. So my brain is predicting what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to feel as I grab this thing. So what does that, how does that manifest itself in neural</p>
<p>tissue? Right. We got brains made of neurons and there&rsquo;s chemicals and there&rsquo;s neurons and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spikes and the connect, you know, where, where is the prediction going on? And one argument could be</p>
<p>that, well, when I&rsquo;m predicting something, um, a neuron must be firing in advance. It&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>this neuron represents what you&rsquo;re going to feel and it&rsquo;s firing. It&rsquo;s sending a spike.</p>
<p>And certainly that happens to some extent, but our predictions are so ubiquitous</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re making so many of them, which we&rsquo;re totally unaware of just the vast majority of me</p>
<p>have no idea that you&rsquo;re doing this. Um, that it, there wasn&rsquo;t really, we were trying to figure,</p>
<p>how could this be? Where, where are these, where are these happening? Right. And I won&rsquo;t walk you</p>
<p>through the whole story unless you insist upon it. But we came to the realization that most of your</p>
<p>predictions are occurring inside individual neurons, especially these, the most common</p>
<p>are in the parameter cells. And there are, there&rsquo;s a property of neurons. We, everyone knows,</p>
<p>or most people know that a neuron is a cell and it has this spike called an action potential,</p>
<p>and it sends information. But we now know that there&rsquo;s these spikes internal to the neuron,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called dendritic spikes. They travel along the branches of the neuron and they don&rsquo;t leave</p>
<p>the neuron. They&rsquo;re just internal only. There&rsquo;s far more dendritic spikes than there are action</p>
<p>potentials, far more. They&rsquo;re happening all the time. And what we came to understand that those</p>
<p>dendritic spikes, the ones that are occurring are actually a form of prediction. They&rsquo;re telling the</p>
<p>neuron, the neuron is saying, I expect that I might become active shortly. And that internal,</p>
<p>so the internal spike is a way of saying, you&rsquo;re going to, you might be generating external spikes</p>
<p>soon. I predicted you&rsquo;re going to become active. And, and we&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve, we wrote a paper in 2016</p>
<p>which explained how this manifests itself in neural tissue and how it is that this all works</p>
<p>together. But the vast majority, we think it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence supporting it. So we,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where we think that most of these predictions are internal. That&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be, they&rsquo;re internal to the neuron, you can&rsquo;t perceive them.</p>
<p>Well, from understanding the prediction mechanism of a single neuron, do you think there&rsquo;s deep</p>
<p>insights to be gained about the prediction capabilities of the mini brains of the neural</p>
<p>brain? Of the mini brains and then the bigger brain and the brain?</p>
<p>Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So having a prediction side of their individual neuron is not that useful.</p>
<p>So what? The way it manifests itself in neural tissue is that when a neuron, a neuron emits these</p>
<p>spikes are a very singular type event. If a neuron is predicting that it&rsquo;s going to be active, it</p>
<p>emits its spike very, a little bit sooner, just a few milliseconds sooner than it would have</p>
<p>been. It&rsquo;s like, I give the analogy of the book is like a sprinter on a, on a starting blocks in a,</p>
<p>in a race. And if someone says, get ready, set, you get up and you&rsquo;re ready to go. And then when</p>
<p>your race starts, you get a little bit earlier start. So that it&rsquo;s that, that ready set is like</p>
<p>the prediction and the neurons like ready to go quicker. And what happens is when you have a whole</p>
<p>bunch of neurons together and they&rsquo;re all getting these inputs, the ones that are in the predictive</p>
<p>state, the ones that are anticipating to become active, if they do become active, they, they</p>
<p>sooner, they disable everything else. And it leads to different representations in the brain. So</p>
<p>you have to, it&rsquo;s not isolated just to the neuron, the prediction occurs with the neuron,</p>
<p>but the network behavior changes. So what happens under different predictions, different inputs</p>
<p>have different representations. So how I, what I predict is going to be different under different</p>
<p>contexts, you know, what my input will be is different under different contexts. So this is,</p>
<p>this is a key to the whole theory, how this works. So the theory of the thousand brains,</p>
<p>if you were to count the number of brains, how would you do it? The thousand brain theory says</p>
<p>that basically every cortical column in the, in your, in your cortex is a complete modeling system.</p>
<p>And that when I ask, where do I have a model of something like a coffee cup? It&rsquo;s not in one of</p>
<p>those models. It&rsquo;s in thousands of those models. There&rsquo;s thousands of models of coffee cups. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what the thousand brains, then there&rsquo;s a voting mechanism, which you lead, which you&rsquo;re, which is</p>
<p>the thing you&rsquo;re, which you&rsquo;re conscious of, which leads to your singular perception. That&rsquo;s why you,</p>
<p>you perceive something. So that&rsquo;s the thousand brains theory. The details, how we got to that</p>
<p>theory are complicated. It wasn&rsquo;t, we just thought of it one day. And one of those details that we</p>
<p>had to ask, how does a model make predictions? And we&rsquo;ve talked about just these predictive neurons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of this theory. It&rsquo;s like saying, Oh, it&rsquo;s a detail, but it was like a crack in the</p>
<p>door. It&rsquo;s like, how are we going to figure out how these neurons built through this? You know,</p>
<p>what is going on here? So we just looked at prediction as like, well, we know that&rsquo;s ubiquitous.</p>
<p>We know that every part of the cortex is making predictions. Therefore, whatever the predictive</p>
<p>system is, it&rsquo;s going to be everywhere. We know there&rsquo;s a gazillion predictions happening at once.</p>
<p>So this is where we can start teasing apart, you know, ask questions about, you know, how could</p>
<p>neurons be making these predictions? And that sort of built up to now what we have this thousand</p>
<p>brains theory, which is complex. You know, it&rsquo;s just, I can state it simply, but we just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of it. We had to get there step by step, very, it took years to get there.</p>
<p>And where does reference frames fit in? So, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. So again, a reference frame, I mentioned earlier about the model of a house. And I said,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to build a model of a house in a computer, they have a reference frame. And you</p>
<p>can think of reference frame like Cartesian coordinates, like X, Y, and Z axes. So I could</p>
<p>say, oh, I&rsquo;m going to design a house. I can say, well, the front door is at this location, X, Y,</p>
<p>Z, and the roof is at this location, X, Y, Z, and so on. That&rsquo;s a type of reference frame.</p>
<p>So it turns out for you to make a prediction, and I walk you through the thought experiment in the</p>
<p>book where I was predicting what my finger was going to feel when I touched a coffee cup.</p>
<p>It was a ceramic coffee cup, but this one will do. And what I realized is that to make a prediction</p>
<p>of what my finger&rsquo;s going to feel, like it&rsquo;s going to feel different than this, what&rsquo;s it feel</p>
<p>different if I touch the hole or this thing on the bottom, make that prediction. The cortex needs to</p>
<p>know where the finger is, the tip of the finger, relative to the coffee cup. And exactly relative</p>
<p>to the coffee cup. And to do that, I have to have a reference frame for the coffee cup. It has to</p>
<p>have a way of representing the location of my finger to the coffee cup. And then we realized,</p>
<p>of course, every part of your skin has to have a reference frame relative to things that touch.</p>
<p>And then we did the same thing with vision. So the idea that a reference frame is necessary</p>
<p>to make a prediction when you&rsquo;re touching something or when you&rsquo;re seeing something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re moving your eyes or you&rsquo;re moving your fingers, it&rsquo;s just a requirement</p>
<p>to predict. If I have a structure, I&rsquo;m going to make a prediction. I have to know where it is I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>looking or touching it. So then we said, well, how do neurons make reference frames? It&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>X, Y, Z coordinates don&rsquo;t exist in the brain. It&rsquo;s just not the way it works. So that&rsquo;s when we</p>
<p>looked at the older part of the brain, the hippocampus and the anterior cortex, where we knew</p>
<p>that in that part of the brain, there&rsquo;s a reference frame for a room or a reference frame for an</p>
<p>environment. Remember, I talked earlier about how you could make a map of this room. So we said,</p>
<p>oh, they are implementing reference frames there. So we knew that reference frames needed to exist</p>
<p>in every quarter of a column. And so that was a deductive thing. We just deduced it. It has to</p>
<p>exist. So you take the old mammalian ability to know where you are in a particular space</p>
<p>and you start applying that to higher and higher levels.</p>
<p>Yeah. First you apply it to like where your finger is. So here&rsquo;s what I think about it.</p>
<p>The old part of the brain says, where&rsquo;s my body in this room? The new part of the brain says,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s my finger relative to this object? Where is a section of my retina relative to</p>
<p>this object? I&rsquo;m looking at one little corner. Where is that relative to this patch of my retina?</p>
<p>And then we take the same thing and apply it to concepts, mathematics, physics, humanity,</p>
<p>whatever you want to think about. And eventually you&rsquo;re pondering your own mortality.</p>
<p>Well, whatever. But the point is when we think about the world, when we have knowledge about</p>
<p>the world, how is that knowledge organized, Lex? Where is it in your head? The answer is it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>reference frames. So the way I learned the structure of this water bottle where the</p>
<p>features are relative to each other, when I think about history or democracy or mathematics,</p>
<p>the same basic underlying structure is happening. There&rsquo;s reference frames for where the knowledge</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re assigning things to. So in the book, I go through examples like mathematics</p>
<p>and language and politics. But the evidence is very clear in the neuroscience. The same mechanism</p>
<p>that we use to model this coffee cup, we&rsquo;re going to use to model high level thoughts.</p>
<p>Your demise of humanity, whatever you want to think about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think about how different are the representations of those higher dimensional</p>
<p>concepts, higher level concepts, how different the representation there is in terms of reference</p>
<p>frames versus spatial. But the interesting thing, it&rsquo;s a different application, but it&rsquo;s the exact</p>
<p>same mechanism. But isn&rsquo;t there some aspect to higher level concepts that they seem to be</p>
<p>hierarchical? Like they just seem to integrate a lot of information into them. So is our physical</p>
<p>objects. So take this water bottle. I&rsquo;m not particular to this brand, but this is a Fiji</p>
<p>water bottle and it has a logo on it. I use this example in my book, our company&rsquo;s coffee cup has</p>
<p>a logo on it. But this object is hierarchical. It&rsquo;s got like a cylinder and a cap, but then it</p>
<p>has this logo on it and the logo has a word, the word has letters, the letters have different</p>
<p>features. And so I don&rsquo;t have to remember, I don&rsquo;t have to think about this. So I say,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s a Fiji logo on this water bottle. I don&rsquo;t have to go through and say, oh, what is the</p>
<p>Fiji logo? It&rsquo;s the F and I and the J and I, and there&rsquo;s a hibiscus flower. And, oh, it has the</p>
<p>statement on it. I don&rsquo;t have to do that. I just incorporate all of that in some sort of hierarchical</p>
<p>representation. I say, put this logo on this water bottle. And then the logo has a word</p>
<p>and the word has letters, all hierarchical. All that stuff is big. It&rsquo;s amazing that the</p>
<p>brain instantly just does all that. The idea that there&rsquo;s water, it&rsquo;s liquid and the idea that you</p>
<p>can drink it when you&rsquo;re thirsty, the idea that there&rsquo;s brands and then there&rsquo;s like all of that</p>
<p>information is instantly like built into the whole thing once you proceed. So I wanted to</p>
<p>get back to your point about hierarchical representation. The world itself is hierarchical,</p>
<p>right? And I can take this microphone in front of me. I know inside there&rsquo;s going to be some</p>
<p>electronics. I know there&rsquo;s going to be some wires and I know there&rsquo;s going to be a little</p>
<p>diaphragm that moves back and forth. I don&rsquo;t see that, but I know it. So everything in the world</p>
<p>is hierarchical. You just go into a room. It&rsquo;s composed of other components. The kitchen has a</p>
<p>refrigerator. The refrigerator has a door. The door has a hinge. The hinge has screws and pin.</p>
<p>So anyway, the modeling system that exists in every cortical column learns the hierarchical</p>
<p>structure of objects. So it&rsquo;s a very sophisticated modeling system in this grain of rice. It&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to imagine, but this grain of rice can do really sophisticated things. It&rsquo;s got 100,000 neurons in</p>
<p>it. It&rsquo;s very sophisticated. So that same mechanism that can model a water bottle or a coffee cup</p>
<p>can model conceptual objects as well. That&rsquo;s the beauty of this discovery that this guy,</p>
<p>Vernon Malmkastel, made many, many years ago, which is that there&rsquo;s a single cortical algorithm</p>
<p>underlying everything we&rsquo;re doing. So common sense concepts and higher</p>
<p>level concepts are all represented in the same way?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re set in the same mechanisms, yeah. It&rsquo;s a little bit like computers. All computers are</p>
<p>universal Turing machines. Even the little teeny one that&rsquo;s in my toaster and the big one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>running some cloud server someplace. They&rsquo;re all running on the same principle. They can</p>
<p>apply different things. So the brain is all built on the same principle. It&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>learning these structured models using movement and reference frames. And it can be applied to</p>
<p>something as simple as a water bottle and a coffee cup. And it can be applied to thinking</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the future of humanity and why do you have a hedgehog on your desk? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Nobody knows. Well, I think it&rsquo;s a hedgehog. That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s a hedgehog in the fog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Russian reference. Does it give you any inclination or hope about how difficult</p>
<p>it is to engineer common sense reasoning? So how complicated is this whole process?</p>
<p>So looking at the brain, is this a marvel of engineering or is it pretty dumb stuff</p>
<p>stuck on top of each other over? Can it be both? Can it be both, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it can be both because if it&rsquo;s an incredible engineering job, that means it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so evolution did a lot of work. Yeah, but then it just copied that.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right. So as I said earlier, figuring out how to model something like a space is really hard</p>
<p>and evolution had to go through a lot of trick. And these cells I was talking about,</p>
<p>these grid cells and place cells, they&rsquo;re really complicated. This is not simple stuff.</p>
<p>This neural tissue works on these really unexpected, weird mechanisms.</p>
<p>But it did it. It figured it out. But now you could just make lots of copies of it.</p>
<p>But then finding, yeah, so it&rsquo;s a very interesting idea that&rsquo;s a lot of copies</p>
<p>of a basic mini brain. But the question is how difficult it is to find that mini brain</p>
<p>that you can copy and paste effectively. Today, we know enough to build this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting here with, I know the steps we have to go. There&rsquo;s still some engineering problems</p>
<p>to solve, but we know enough. And this is not like, oh, this is an interesting idea. We have</p>
<p>to go think about it for another few decades. No, we actually understand it pretty well in details.</p>
<p>So not all the details, but most of them. So it&rsquo;s complicated, but it is an engineering problem.</p>
<p>So in my company, we are working on that. We are basically a roadmap of how we do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to take decades. It&rsquo;s a matter of a few years optimistically,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s possible. It&rsquo;s, you know, complex things. If you understand them,</p>
<p>you can build them. So in which domain do you think it&rsquo;s best to build them?</p>
<p>Are we talking about robotics, like entities that operate in the physical world that are</p>
<p>able to interact with that world? Are we talking about entities that operate in the digital world?</p>
<p>Are we talking about something more like more specific, like it&rsquo;s done in the machine learning</p>
<p>community where you look at natural language or computer vision? Where do you think is easiest?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first, it&rsquo;s the first two more than the third one, I would say.</p>
<p>Again, let&rsquo;s just use computers as an analogy. The pioneers in computing, people like John</p>
<p>Van Norman and Alan Turing, they created this thing, you know, we now call the universal</p>
<p>Turing machine, which is a computer, right? Did they know how it was going to be applied?</p>
<p>Where it was going to be used? Could they envision any of the future? No. They just said,</p>
<p>this is like a really interesting computational idea about algorithms and how you can implement</p>
<p>them in a machine. And we&rsquo;re doing something similar to that today. Like we are building this</p>
<p>sort of universal learning principle that can be applied to many, many different things.</p>
<p>But the robotics piece of that, the interactive&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay. All right. Let&rsquo;s be just specific. You can think of this cortical column as</p>
<p>what we call a sensory motor learning system. It has the idea that there&rsquo;s a sensor</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s moving. That sensor can be physical. It could be like my finger</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s moving in the world. It could be like my eye and it&rsquo;s physically moving.</p>
<p>It can also be virtual. So, it could be, an example would be, I could have a system that</p>
<p>lives in the internet that actually samples information on the internet and moves by</p>
<p>following links. That&rsquo;s a sensory motor system. Something that echoes the process of a finger</p>
<p>moving along a cortical&hellip; But in a very, very loose sense. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>again, learning is inherently about discovering the structure of the world and discover the</p>
<p>structure of the world, you have to move through the world. Even if it&rsquo;s a virtual world, even if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a conceptual world, you have to move through it. It doesn&rsquo;t exist in one&hellip; It has some structure</p>
<p>to it. So, here&rsquo;s a couple of predictions at getting what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>In humans, the same algorithm does robotics. It moves my arms, my eyes, my body.</p>
<p>And so, in the future, to me, robotics and AI will merge. They&rsquo;re not going to be separate fields</p>
<p>because the algorithms for really controlling robots are going to be the same algorithms we</p>
<p>have in our brain, these sensory motor algorithms. Today, we&rsquo;re not there, but I think that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to happen. But not all AI systems will have to be robotics. You can have systems that have very</p>
<p>different types of embodiments. Some will have physical movements, some will not have physical</p>
<p>movements. It&rsquo;s a very generic learning system. Again, it&rsquo;s like computers. The Turing machine,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t say how it&rsquo;s supposed to be implemented, it doesn&rsquo;t tell you how big it is,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t tell you what you can apply it to, but it&rsquo;s a computational principle.</p>
<p>The cortical column equivalent is a computational principle about learning. It&rsquo;s about how you</p>
<p>learn and it can be applied to a gazillion things. I think this impact of AI is going to be as large,</p>
<p>if not larger, than computing has been in the last century, by far, because it&rsquo;s getting at</p>
<p>a fundamental thing. It&rsquo;s not a vision system or a learning system. It&rsquo;s not a vision system or</p>
<p>a hearing system. It is a learning system. It&rsquo;s a fundamental principle, how you learn the structure</p>
<p>in the world, how you can gain knowledge and be intelligent. That&rsquo;s what the thousand brains says</p>
<p>was going on. We have a particular implementation in our head, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be like that</p>
<p>at all. Do you think there&rsquo;s going to be some kind of impact? Okay, let me ask it another way.</p>
<p>What do increasingly intelligent AI systems do with us humans in the following way? How hard is</p>
<p>the human in the loop problem? How hard is it to interact? The finger on the coffee cup equivalent</p>
<p>of having a conversation with a human being. How hard is it to fit into our little human world?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a lot of engineering problems. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a fundamental problem.</p>
<p>I could ask you the same question. How hard is it for computers to fit into a human world?</p>
<p>Right. That&rsquo;s essentially what I&rsquo;m asking. How elitist are we as humans? We try to keep out</p>
<p>systems. I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s the right question. Let&rsquo;s look at computers as an</p>
<p>analogy. Computers are a million times faster than us. They do things we can&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Most people have no idea what&rsquo;s going on when they use computers. How do we integrate them</p>
<p>in our society? Well, we don&rsquo;t think of them as their own entity. They&rsquo;re not living things.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t afford them rights. We rely on them. Our survival as seven billion people or something</p>
<p>like that is relying on computers now. Don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s a fundamental problem</p>
<p>that we see them as something we don&rsquo;t give rights to?</p>
<p>Computers? Yeah, computers. Robots,</p>
<p>computers, intelligence systems. It feels like for them to operate successfully,</p>
<p>they would need to have a lot of the elements that we would start having to think about.</p>
<p>Should this entity have rights? I don&rsquo;t think so. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tempting to think that way. First of all, hardly anyone thinks that for computers today.</p>
<p>No one says, oh, this thing needs a right. I shouldn&rsquo;t be able to turn it off. If I throw it</p>
<p>in the trash can and hit it with a sledgehammer, it might form a criminal act. No one thinks that.</p>
<p>Now we think about intelligent machines, which is where you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, you&rsquo;re like, well, now we can&rsquo;t do that. I think the basic problem we have here</p>
<p>is that people think intelligent machines will be like us. They&rsquo;re going to have the same emotions</p>
<p>as we do, the same feelings as we do. What if I can build an intelligent machine that absolutely</p>
<p>could care less about whether it was on or off or destroyed or not? It just doesn&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like a map. It&rsquo;s just a modeling system. There&rsquo;s no desires to live. Nothing.</p>
<p>Is it possible to create a system that can model the world deeply and not care</p>
<p>about whether it lives or dies? Absolutely. No question about it.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s not 100% obvious. It&rsquo;s obvious to me. We can debate it if we want.</p>
<p>Where does your desire to live come from? It&rsquo;s an old evolutionary design. We could argue,</p>
<p>does it really matter if we live or not? Objectively, no. We&rsquo;re all going to die eventually.</p>
<p>Evolution makes us want to live. Evolution makes us want to fight to live. Evolution makes us want</p>
<p>to care and love one another and to care for our children and our relatives and our family and so</p>
<p>on. Those are all good things. They come about not because we&rsquo;re smart, because we&rsquo;re animals</p>
<p>that grew up. The hummingbird in my backyard cares about its offspring. Every living thing</p>
<p>in some sense cares about surviving. When we talk about creating intelligent machines,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not creating life. We&rsquo;re not creating evolving creatures. We&rsquo;re not creating living</p>
<p>things. We&rsquo;re just creating a machine that can learn really sophisticated stuff. That machine,</p>
<p>it may even be able to talk to us. It&rsquo;s not going to have a desire to live unless somehow we put it</p>
<p>into that system. Well, there&rsquo;s learning, right? The thing is&hellip; But you don&rsquo;t learn to want to</p>
<p>live. It&rsquo;s built into you. It&rsquo;s part of your DNA. People like Ernest Becker argue,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the fact of finiteness of life. The way we think about it is something we learned,</p>
<p>perhaps. Okay. Yeah. Some people decide they don&rsquo;t want to live. Some people decide the desire to</p>
<p>live is built in DNA, right? But I think what I&rsquo;m trying to get to is in order to accomplish goals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s useful to have the urgency of mortality. It&rsquo;s what the Stoics talked about,</p>
<p>is meditating in your mortality. It might be a very useful thing to do to die and have the urgency</p>
<p>of death and to realize that to conceive yourself as an entity that operates in this world that</p>
<p>eventually will no longer be a part of this world and actually conceive of yourself as a conscious</p>
<p>entity might be very useful for you to be a system that makes sense of the world. Otherwise,</p>
<p>you might get lazy. Well, okay. We&rsquo;re going to build these machines, right? So we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about building AIs. But we&rsquo;re building the equivalent of the cortical columns.</p>
<p>The neocortex. The neocortex. And the question is, where do they arrive at? Because we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hard coding everything in. Well, in terms of if you build the neocortex equivalent,</p>
<p>it will not have any of these desires or emotional states. Now, you can argue that</p>
<p>that neocortex won&rsquo;t be useful unless I give it some agency, unless I give it some desire,</p>
<p>unless I give it some motivation. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll be just lazy and do nothing, right?</p>
<p>You could argue that. But on its own, it&rsquo;s not going to do those things. It&rsquo;s just not going</p>
<p>to sit there and say, I understand the world. Therefore, I care to live. No, it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to do that. It&rsquo;s just going to say, I understand the world. Why is that obvious to you? Do you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible? Okay, let me ask it this way. Do you think it&rsquo;s possible it will at least assign to</p>
<p>itself agency and perceive itself in this world as being a conscious entity as a useful way to</p>
<p>operate in the world and to make sense of the world? I think an intelligent machine can be</p>
<p>conscious, but that does not, again, imply any of these desires and goals that you&rsquo;re worried about.</p>
<p>We can talk about what it means for a machine to be conscious.</p>
<p>By the way, not worry about, but get excited about. It&rsquo;s not necessary that we should worry</p>
<p>about it. I think there&rsquo;s a legitimate problem or not problem, a question asked,</p>
<p>if you build this modeling system, what&rsquo;s it going to model? What&rsquo;s its desire? What&rsquo;s its</p>
<p>goal? What are we applying it to? That&rsquo;s an interesting question. One thing, and it depends</p>
<p>on the application, it&rsquo;s not something that inherent to the modeling system. It&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>we apply to the modeling system in a particular way. If I wanted to make a really smart car,</p>
<p>it would have to know about driving and cars and what&rsquo;s important in driving and cars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to figure that on its own. It&rsquo;s not going to sit there and say, I&rsquo;ve understood</p>
<p>the world and I&rsquo;ve decided, no, no, no, no, we&rsquo;re going to have to tell it. We&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>say, so I imagine I make this car really smart. It learns about your driving habits. It learns</p>
<p>about the world. Is it one day going to wake up and say, you know what? I&rsquo;m tired of driving</p>
<p>and doing what you want. I think I have better ideas about how to spend my time.</p>
<p>Okay. No, it&rsquo;s not going to do that. Well, part of me is playing a little bit of devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>but part of me is also trying to think through this because I&rsquo;ve studied cars quite a bit and</p>
<p>I studied pedestrians and cyclists quite a bit. And there&rsquo;s part of me that thinks</p>
<p>that there needs to be more intelligence than we realize in order to drive successfully.</p>
<p>That game theory of human interaction seems to require some deep understanding of human nature</p>
<p>that, okay. When a pedestrian crosses the street, there&rsquo;s some sense. They look at a car usually,</p>
<p>and then they look away. There&rsquo;s some sense in which they say, I believe that you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to murder me. You don&rsquo;t have the guts to murder me. This is the little dance of pedestrian car</p>
<p>interaction is saying, I&rsquo;m going to look away and I&rsquo;m going to put my life in your hands because</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re human. You&rsquo;re not going to kill me. And then the car in order to successfully</p>
<p>operate in like Manhattan streets has to say, no, no, no, no. I am going to kill you like a little</p>
<p>bit. There&rsquo;s a little bit of this weird inkling of mutual murder. And that&rsquo;s a dance and somehow</p>
<p>successfully operate through that. Do you think you were born of that? Did you learn that social</p>
<p>interaction? I think it might have a lot of the same elements that you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>which is we&rsquo;re leveraging things we were born with and applying them in the context that.</p>
<p>All right. I would have said that that kind of interaction is learned because people in different</p>
<p>cultures to have different interactions like that. If you cross the street in different cities and</p>
<p>different parts of the world, they have different ways of interacting. I would say that&rsquo;s learned.</p>
<p>And I would say an intelligent system can learn that too, but that does not lead. And the intelligent</p>
<p>system can understand humans. It could understand that just like I can study an animal and learn</p>
<p>something about that animal. I could study apes and learn something about their culture and so on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to be an ape to know that. I may not be completely, but I can understand something.</p>
<p>So intelligent machine can model that. That&rsquo;s just part of the world. It&rsquo;s just part of the</p>
<p>interactions. The question we&rsquo;re trying to get at, will the intelligent machine have its own personal</p>
<p>agency that&rsquo;s beyond what we assign to it or its own personal goals or will it evolve and create</p>
<p>these things? My confidence comes from understanding the mechanisms I&rsquo;m talking about creating.</p>
<p>This is not hand wavy stuff. It&rsquo;s down in the details. I&rsquo;m going to build it. And I know what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to look like. And I know what it&rsquo;s going to behave. I know what the kind of things</p>
<p>it could do and the kind of things it can&rsquo;t do. Just like when I build a computer, I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to, on its own, decide to put another register inside of it. It can&rsquo;t do that. No way.</p>
<p>No matter what your software does, it can&rsquo;t add a register to the computer.</p>
<p>So in this way, when we build AI systems, we have to make choices about how we embed them.</p>
<p>So I talk about this in the book. I said intelligent system is not just the neocortex</p>
<p>equivalent. You have to have that. But it has to have some kind of embodiment, physical or virtual.</p>
<p>It has to have some sort of goals. It has to have some sort of ideas about dangers,</p>
<p>about things it shouldn&rsquo;t do. We build in safeguards into systems. We have them in our</p>
<p>bodies. We put them into cars. My car follows my directions until the day it sees I&rsquo;m about to hit</p>
<p>something and it ignores my directions and puts the brakes on. So we can build those things in.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a very interesting problem, how to build those in. I think my differing opinion about the</p>
<p>risks of AI for most people is that people assume that somehow those things will disappear</p>
<p>automatically and evolve. And intelligence itself begets that stuff or requires it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not. Intelligence of the neocortex equipment doesn&rsquo;t require this. The neocortex</p>
<p>equipment just says, I&rsquo;m a learning system. Tell me what you want me to learn and ask me questions</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tell you the answers. And that, again, it&rsquo;s again like a map. A map has no intent about</p>
<p>things, but you can use it to solve problems. Okay. So the building, engineering the neocortex</p>
<p>in itself is just creating an intelligent prediction system.</p>
<p>Modeling system. Sorry, modeling system. You can use it to then make predictions.</p>
<p>But you can also put it inside a thing that&rsquo;s actually acting in this world.</p>
<p>You have to put it inside something. Again, think of the map analogy, right? A map on its own doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do anything. It&rsquo;s just inert. It can learn, but it&rsquo;s just inert. So we have to embed it somehow</p>
<p>in something to do something. So what&rsquo;s your intuition here? You had a conversation with</p>
<p>Sam Harris recently that was sort of, you&rsquo;ve had a bit of a disagreement and you&rsquo;re sticking on</p>
<p>this point. Elon Musk, Stuart Russell kind of have us worry existential threats of AI.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition? Why, if we engineer increasingly intelligent neocortex type of system</p>
<p>in the computer, why that shouldn&rsquo;t be a thing that we&hellip;</p>
<p>It was interesting to use the word intuition and Sam Harris used the word intuition too.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t use that intuition, that word. I immediately stopped and said,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s the crux of the problem. He&rsquo;s using intuition. I&rsquo;m not speaking about my intuition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking about something I understand, something I&rsquo;m going to build, something I am</p>
<p>building, something I understand completely, or at least well enough to know what&hellip; I&rsquo;m guessing,</p>
<p>I know what this thing&rsquo;s going to do. And I think most people who are worried, they have trouble</p>
<p>separating out&hellip; They don&rsquo;t have the knowledge or the understanding about what is intelligence,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s it manifest in the brain, how&rsquo;s it separate from these other functions in the brain.</p>
<p>And so they imagine it&rsquo;s going to be human like or animal like. It&rsquo;s going to have the same sort of</p>
<p>drives and emotions we have, but there&rsquo;s no reason for that. That&rsquo;s just because there&rsquo;s an unknown.</p>
<p>If the unknown is like, oh my God, I don&rsquo;t know what this is going to do. We have to be careful.</p>
<p>It could be like us, but really smarter. I&rsquo;m saying, no, it won&rsquo;t be like us. It&rsquo;ll be really</p>
<p>smarter, but it won&rsquo;t be like us at all. But I&rsquo;m coming from that, not because I&rsquo;m just guessing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not using intuition. I&rsquo;m basing it on like, okay, I understand this thing works. This is what</p>
<p>it does. It makes money to you. Okay. But to push back, so I also disagree with the intuitions that</p>
<p>Sam has, but I also disagree with what you just said, which, you know, what&rsquo;s a good analogy. So</p>
<p>if you look at the Twitter algorithm in the early days, just recommender systems, you can understand</p>
<p>how recommender systems work. What you can&rsquo;t understand in the early days is when you apply</p>
<p>that recommender system at scale to thousands and millions of people, how that can change societies.</p>
<p>Yeah. So the question is, yes, you&rsquo;re just saying this is how an engineer in your cortex works,</p>
<p>but the, like when you have a very useful, uh, TikTok type of service that goes viral when your</p>
<p>neural cortex goes viral and then millions of people start using it, can that destroy the world?</p>
<p>No. Uh, well, first of all, this is back. One thing I want to say is that, um, AI is a dangerous</p>
<p>technology. I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not denying that. All technology is dangerous. Well, and AI,</p>
<p>maybe particularly so. Okay. So, um, am I worried about it? Yeah, I&rsquo;m totally worried about it.</p>
<p>The thing where the narrow component we&rsquo;re talking about now is the existential risk of AI, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. So I want to make that distinction because I think AI can be applied poorly. It can be applied</p>
<p>in ways that, you know, people are going to understand the consequences of it. Um, these are</p>
<p>all potentially very bad things, but they&rsquo;re not the AI system creating this existential risk on</p>
<p>its own. And that&rsquo;s the only place that I disagree with other people. Right. So I, I think the</p>
<p>existential risk thing is, um, humans are really damn good at surviving. So to kill off the human</p>
<p>race, it&rsquo;d be very, very difficult. Yes, but you can even, I&rsquo;ll go further. I don&rsquo;t think AI systems</p>
<p>are ever going to try to, I don&rsquo;t think AI systems are ever going to like say, I&rsquo;m going to ignore</p>
<p>you. I&rsquo;m going to do what I think is best. Um, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to happen, at least not</p>
<p>in the way I&rsquo;m talking about it. So you, the Twitter recommendation algorithm is an interesting</p>
<p>example. Let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s use computers as an analogy again, right? I build a computer. It&rsquo;s a universal</p>
<p>computing machine. I can&rsquo;t predict what people are going to use it for. They can build all kinds of</p>
<p>things. They can, they can even create computer viruses. It&rsquo;s, you know, all kinds of stuff. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some unknown about its utility and about where it&rsquo;s going to go. But on the other hand,</p>
<p>I pointed out that once I build a computer, it&rsquo;s not going to fundamentally change how it computes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I use the example of a register, which is a part, internal part of a computer. Um, you</p>
<p>know, I say it can&rsquo;t just sit there because computers don&rsquo;t evolve. They don&rsquo;t replicate,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t evolve. They don&rsquo;t, you know, the physical manifestation of the computer itself</p>
<p>is not going to, there&rsquo;s certain things that can&rsquo;t do right. So we can break into things like things</p>
<p>that are possible to happen. We can&rsquo;t predict and things that are just impossible to happen.</p>
<p>Unless we go out of our way to make them happen, they&rsquo;re not going to happen unless somebody makes</p>
<p>them happen. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a bunch of things to say. One is the physical aspect,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re absolutely right. We have to build a thing for it to operate in the physical world</p>
<p>and you can just stop building them. Uh, you know, the moment they&rsquo;re not doing the thing you want</p>
<p>them to do or just change the design or change the design. The question is, I mean, there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>uh, it&rsquo;s possible in the physical world. This is probably longer term is you automate the building.</p>
<p>It makes, it makes a lot of sense to automate the building. There&rsquo;s a lot of factories that</p>
<p>are doing more and more and more automation to go from raw resources to the final product.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to imagine that obviously much more efficient to keep, to create a factory that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating robots that do something, uh, you know, that do something extremely useful for society.</p>
<p>It could be a personal assistance. It could be, uh, it could, it could be your toaster, but a</p>
<p>toaster as much as deeper knowledge of your culinary preferences. Yeah. And that could,</p>
<p>uh, I think now you&rsquo;ve hit on the right thing. The real thing we need to be worried about is</p>
<p>self replication. Right. That is the thing that we&rsquo;re in the physical world or even the virtual</p>
<p>world self replication because self replication is dangerous. It&rsquo;s probably more likely to be</p>
<p>killed by a virus, you know, or a human hand veneered virus. Anybody can create a, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the technology is getting so almost anybody, but not anybody, but a lot of people</p>
<p>could create a human engineered virus that could wipe out humanity. That is really dangerous. No</p>
<p>intelligence required, just self replication. So, um, so we need to be careful about that.</p>
<p>So when I think about, you know, AI, I&rsquo;m not thinking about robots, building robots. Don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do that. Don&rsquo;t build a, you know, just, well, that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re interesting creating</p>
<p>intelligence. It seems like self replication is a good way to make a lot of money. Well,</p>
<p>fine. But so is, you know, maybe editing viruses is a good way too. I don&rsquo;t know. The point is,</p>
<p>if as a society, when we want to look at existential risks, the existential risks we face</p>
<p>that we can control almost all evolve around self replication. Yes. The question is, I don&rsquo;t see a</p>
<p>good, uh, way to make a lot of money by engineering viruses and deploying them on the world. There</p>
<p>could be, there could be applications that are useful, but let&rsquo;s separate out, let&rsquo;s separate out.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t need to, you only need some, you know, terrorists who wants to do it. Cause</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of money to make viruses. Um, let&rsquo;s just separate out what&rsquo;s risky and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not risky. I&rsquo;m arguing that the intelligence side of this equation is not risky. It&rsquo;s not risky at</p>
<p>all. It&rsquo;s the self replication side of the equation that&rsquo;s risky. And I&rsquo;m arguing that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not risky. And I&rsquo;m not dismissing that. I&rsquo;m scared as hell. It&rsquo;s like the paperclip</p>
<p>maximizer thing. Yeah. Those are often like talked about in the same conversation.</p>
<p>Um, I think you&rsquo;re right. Like creating ultra intelligent, super intelligent systems</p>
<p>is not necessarily coupled with a self replicating arbitrarily self replicating systems. Yeah. And</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get evolution unless you&rsquo;re self replicating. Yeah. And so I think that&rsquo;s the gist</p>
<p>of this argument that people have trouble separating those two out. They just think,</p>
<p>Oh yeah, intelligence looks like us. And look how, look at the damage we&rsquo;ve done to this planet,</p>
<p>like how we&rsquo;ve, you know, destroyed all these other species. Yeah. Well we replicate,</p>
<p>which the 8 billion of us are 7 billion of us now. So, um, I think the idea is that the,</p>
<p>the more intelligent we&rsquo;re able to build systems, the more tempting it becomes from a capitalist</p>
<p>perspective of creating products, the more tempting it becomes to create self, uh, reproducing</p>
<p>systems. All right. So let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s true. So does that mean we don&rsquo;t build intelligent systems?</p>
<p>No, that means we regulate, we, we understand the risks. Uh, we regulate them. Uh, you know,</p>
<p>look, there&rsquo;s a lot of things we could do as society, which have some sort of financial</p>
<p>benefit to someone, which could do a lot of harm. And we have to learn how to regulate those things.</p>
<p>We have to learn how to deal with those things. I will argue this. I would say the opposite. Like I</p>
<p>would say having intelligent machines at our disposal will actually help us in the end more,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll help us understand these risks better. It&rsquo;ll help us mitigate these risks</p>
<p>better. It might be ways of saying, oh, well, how do we solve climate change problems? You know,</p>
<p>how do we do this? Or how do we do that? Um, that just like computers are dangerous in the hands of</p>
<p>the wrong people, but they&rsquo;ve been so great for so many other things. We live with those dangers.</p>
<p>And I think we have to do the same with intelligent machines. We just, but we have to be</p>
<p>constantly vigilant about this idea of a bad actors doing bad things with them and be,</p>
<p>um, don&rsquo;t ever, ever create a self replicating system. Um, uh, and, and by the way, I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know if you could create a self replicating system that uses a factory. That&rsquo;s really dangerous.</p>
<p>You know, nature&rsquo;s way of self replicating is so amazing. Um, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t require</p>
<p>anything. It just, you know, the thing and resources and it goes right. Um, if I said to</p>
<p>you, you know what we have to build, uh, our goal is to build a factory that can make that builds</p>
<p>new factories and it has to end to end supply chain. It has to bind the resources, get the</p>
<p>energy. I mean, that&rsquo;s really hard. It&rsquo;s, you know, no one&rsquo;s doing that in the next, you know,</p>
<p>a hundred years. I&rsquo;ve been extremely impressed by the efforts of Elon Musk and Tesla to try to do</p>
<p>exactly that. Not, not from raw resource. Well, he actually, I think states the goal is to go from</p>
<p>raw resource to the, uh, the final car in one factory. Yeah. That&rsquo;s the main goal. Of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not currently possible, but they&rsquo;re taking huge leaps. Well, he&rsquo;s not the only one to do</p>
<p>that. This has been a goal for many industries for a long, long time. Um, it&rsquo;s difficult to do.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of people, what they do is instead they have like a million suppliers and then they</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s, they all co locate them and they, and they tie the systems together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fundamental, I think that&rsquo;s, that also is not getting at the issue I was just talking about,</p>
<p>um, which is self replication. It&rsquo;s, um, I mean, self replication means there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>entity involved other than the entity that&rsquo;s replicating. Um, right. And so if there are</p>
<p>humans in this, in the loop, that&rsquo;s not really self replicating, right? It&rsquo;s unless somehow we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>duped into doing it. But it&rsquo;s also, I don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>agree with you because you&rsquo;ve kind of mentioned that AI will not say no to us.</p>
<p>I just think they will. Yeah. Yeah. So like, uh, I think it&rsquo;s a useful feature to build in. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just trying to like, uh, put myself in the mind of engineers to sometimes say no, you know, if you,</p>
<p>I gave the example earlier, right? I gave the example of my car, right? My car turns the wheel</p>
<p>and, and applies the accelerator and the brake as I say, until it decides there&rsquo;s something dangerous.</p>
<p>Yes. And then it doesn&rsquo;t do that. Now that was something it didn&rsquo;t decide to do. It&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>we programmed into the car. And so good. It was a good idea, right? The question again, isn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>if we create an intelligent system, will it ever ignore our commands? Of course it will. And</p>
<p>sometimes is it going to do it because it came up, came up with its own goals that serve its purposes</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t care about our purposes? No, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Okay. So let me ask you about these, uh, super intelligent cortical systems that we engineer</p>
<p>and us humans, do you think, uh, with these entities operating out there in the world,</p>
<p>what is the future most promising future look like? Is it us merging with them or is it us?</p>
<p>Like, how do we keep us humans around when you have increasingly intelligent beings? Is it, uh,</p>
<p>one of the dreams is to upload our minds in the digital space. So can we just</p>
<p>give our minds to these, uh, systems so they can operate on them? Is there some kind of more</p>
<p>interesting merger or is there more, more communication? I talked about all these</p>
<p>scenarios and let me just walk through them. Sure. Um, the uploading the mind one. Yes. Extremely,</p>
<p>really difficult to do. Like, like, we have no idea how to do this even remotely right now. Um,</p>
<p>so it would be a very long way away, but I make the argument you wouldn&rsquo;t like the result.</p>
<p>Um, and you wouldn&rsquo;t be pleased with the result. It&rsquo;s really not what you think it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>Um, imagine I could upload your brain into a, into a computer right now. And now the computer</p>
<p>sitting there going, Hey, I&rsquo;m over here. Great. Get rid of that old bio person. I don&rsquo;t need them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still sitting here. Yeah. What are you going to do? No, no, that&rsquo;s not me. I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>Right. Are you going to feel satisfied then? Then you, but people imagine, look, I&rsquo;m on my deathbed</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m about to, you know, expire and I pushed the button and now I&rsquo;m uploaded. But think about</p>
<p>it a little differently. And, and so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be a thing because people,</p>
<p>by the time we&rsquo;re able to do this, if ever, because you have to replicate the entire body,</p>
<p>not just the brain. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s, I walked through the issues. It&rsquo;s really substantial.</p>
<p>Um, do you have a sense of what makes us us? Is there, is there a shortcut to what can only save</p>
<p>a certain part that makes us truly ours? No, but I think that machine would feel like it&rsquo;s you too.</p>
<p>Right. Right. You have two people, just like I have a child, I have a child, right? I have two</p>
<p>daughters. They&rsquo;re independent people. I created them. Well, partly. Yeah. And, um, uh, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re somewhat like me, I don&rsquo;t feel on them and they don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m me. So</p>
<p>if you split apart, you have two people. So we can tell them, come back to what, what makes,</p>
<p>what consciousness do you want? We can talk about that, but we don&rsquo;t have like remote consciousness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sitting there going, Oh, I&rsquo;m conscious of that. You know, I mean, that system of,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say, let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s stay on our topic. One was uploading a brand. Yep. It ain&rsquo;t gonna happen</p>
<p>in a hundred years, maybe a thousand, but I don&rsquo;t think people are going to want to do it. The</p>
<p>merging your mind with, uh, you know, the neural link thing, right? Like again, really, really</p>
<p>difficult. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s one thing to make progress, to control a prosthetic arm. It&rsquo;s another to have</p>
<p>like a billion or several billion, you know, things and understanding what those signals</p>
<p>mean. Like it&rsquo;s the one thing that like, okay, I can learn to think some patterns to make something</p>
<p>happen. It&rsquo;s quite another thing to have a system, a computer, which actually knows exactly what</p>
<p>cells it&rsquo;s talking to and how it&rsquo;s talking to them and interacting in a way like that. Very,</p>
<p>very difficult. We&rsquo;re not getting anywhere closer to that. Um, interesting. Can I, can I, uh, can</p>
<p>I ask a question here? What, so for me, what makes that merger very difficult practically in the next</p>
<p>10, 20, 50 years is like literally the biology side of it, which is like, it&rsquo;s just hard to do</p>
<p>that kind of surgery in a safe way. But your intuition is even the machine learning part of it,</p>
<p>where the machine has to learn what the heck it&rsquo;s talking to. That&rsquo;s even hard. I think it&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>harder. And it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s easy to do when you&rsquo;re talking about hundreds of signals. It&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a totally different thing to say, talking about billions of years. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a totally</p>
<p>different thing to say, talking about billions of signals. So you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the raw,</p>
<p>the it&rsquo;s a machine learning problem. You don&rsquo;t think it could be learned? Well, I&rsquo;m just saying,</p>
<p>no, I think you&rsquo;d have to have detailed knowledge. You&rsquo;d have to know exactly what the types of</p>
<p>neurons you&rsquo;re connecting to. I mean, in the brain, there&rsquo;s these, there are all different</p>
<p>types of things. It&rsquo;s not like a neural network. It&rsquo;s a very complex organism system up here. We</p>
<p>talked about the grid cells or the place cells, you know, you have to know what kind of cells</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking to and what they&rsquo;re doing and how their timing works and all, all this stuff,</p>
<p>which you can&rsquo;t today. There&rsquo;s no way of doing that. Right. But I think it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I think the problem you&rsquo;re right. That the biological aspect of like who wants to have</p>
<p>a surgery and have this stuff inserted in your brain. That&rsquo;s a problem. But this is when we</p>
<p>solve that problem. I think the, the information coding aspect is much worse. I think that&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>worse. It&rsquo;s not like what they&rsquo;re doing today. Today. It&rsquo;s simple machine learning stuff</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing simple things. But if you want to merge your brain, like I&rsquo;m thinking on</p>
<p>the internet, I&rsquo;m merged my brain with the machine and we&rsquo;re both doing, that&rsquo;s a totally different</p>
<p>issue. That&rsquo;s interesting. I tend to think if the, okay. If you have a super clean signal</p>
<p>from a bunch of neurons at the start, you don&rsquo;t know what those neurons are. I think that&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>easier than the getting of the clean signal. I think if you think about today&rsquo;s machine learning,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you would conclude. Right. I&rsquo;m thinking about what&rsquo;s going on in the brain</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t reach that conclusion. So we&rsquo;ll have to see. Sure. But I don&rsquo;t think even, even then,</p>
<p>I think this kind of a sad future. Like, you know, do I, do I have to like plug my brain</p>
<p>into a computer? I&rsquo;m still a biological organism. I assume I&rsquo;m still going to die.</p>
<p>So what have I achieved? Right. You know, what have I achieved? Oh, I disagree that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what those are, but it seems like there could be a lot of different applications. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like virtual reality is to expand your brain&rsquo;s capability to, to like, to read Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Yeah. But, but fine. But, but you&rsquo;re still a biological organism.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes. You know, you&rsquo;re still, you&rsquo;re still mortal. All right. So,</p>
<p>so what are you accomplishing? You&rsquo;re making your life in this short period of time better. Right.</p>
<p>Just like having the internet made our life better. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So I think that&rsquo;s of,</p>
<p>of, if I think about all the possible gains we can have here, that&rsquo;s a marginal one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an individual, Hey, I&rsquo;m better, you know, I&rsquo;m smarter. But you know, fine. I&rsquo;m not against it.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s earth changing. I, but, but it w so this is the true of the internet.</p>
<p>When each of us individuals are smarter, we get a chance to then share our smartness.</p>
<p>We get smarter and smarter together as like, as a collective, this is kind of like this</p>
<p>ant colony. Why don&rsquo;t I just create an intelligent machine that doesn&rsquo;t have any of this biological</p>
<p>nonsense that has all the same. It&rsquo;s everything except don&rsquo;t burden it with my brain. Yeah.</p>
<p>Right. It has a brain. It is smart. It&rsquo;s like my child, but it&rsquo;s much, much smarter than me.</p>
<p>So I have a choice between doing some implant, doing some hybrid, weird, you know, biological</p>
<p>thing that bleeding and all these problems and limited by my brain or creating a system,</p>
<p>which is super smart that I can talk to. Um, that helps me understand the world that can</p>
<p>read the internet, you know, read Wikipedia and talk to me. I guess my, the open questions there</p>
<p>are what does the men manifestation of super intelligence look like? So like, what are we</p>
<p>going to, you, you talked about why do I want to merge with AI? Like what, what&rsquo;s the actual</p>
<p>marginal benefit here? If I, if we have a super intelligent system, how will it make our life</p>
<p>better? So let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a great question, but let&rsquo;s break it down to little pieces. All</p>
<p>right. On the one hand, it can make our life better in lots of simple ways. You mentioned</p>
<p>like a care robot or something that helps me do things. It cooks. I don&rsquo;t know what it does. Right.</p>
<p>Little things like that. We have super better, smarter cars. We can have, you know, better agents</p>
<p>aids helping us in our work environment and things like that. To me, that&rsquo;s like the easy stuff, the</p>
<p>simple stuff in the beginning. Um, um, and so in the same way that computers made our lives better</p>
<p>in ways, many, many ways, I will have those kinds of things. To me, the really exciting thing about AI</p>
<p>is the sort of it&rsquo;s transcendent, transcendent quality in terms of humanity. We&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>biological organisms. We&rsquo;re still stuck here on earth. It&rsquo;s going to be hard for us to live</p>
<p>anywhere else. Uh, I don&rsquo;t think you and I are going to want to live on Mars anytime soon. Um,</p>
<p>um, and, um, and we&rsquo;re flawed, you know, we may end up destroying ourselves. It&rsquo;s totally possible.</p>
<p>Uh, we, if not completely, we could destroy our civilizations. You know, it&rsquo;s this face the fact</p>
<p>we have issues here, but we can create intelligent machines that can help us in various ways. For</p>
<p>example, one example I gave, and that sounds a little sci fi, but I believe this. If we really</p>
<p>wanted to live on Mars, we&rsquo;d have to have intelligent systems that go there and build</p>
<p>the habitat for us, not humans. Humans are never going to do this. It&rsquo;s just too hard. Um, but could</p>
<p>we have a thousand or 10,000, you know, engineer workers up there doing this stuff, building things,</p>
<p>terraforming Mars? Sure. Maybe we can move Mars. But then if we want to, if we want to go around</p>
<p>the universe, should I send my children around the universe or should I send some intelligent machine,</p>
<p>which is like a child that represents me and understands our needs here on earth that could</p>
<p>travel through space. Um, so it&rsquo;s sort of, it, in some sense, intelligence allows us to transcend</p>
<p>our, the limitations of our biology, uh, with, and, and don&rsquo;t think of it as a negative thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in some sense, my children transcend my, the, my biology too, cause they, they live beyond me.</p>
<p>Yeah. Um, and we impart, they represent me and they also have their own knowledge and I can</p>
<p>impart knowledge to them. So intelligent machines will be like that too, but not limited like us.</p>
<p>I mean, but the question is, um, there&rsquo;s so many ways that transcendence can happen</p>
<p>and the merger with AI and humans is one of those ways. So you said intelligent,</p>
<p>basically beings or systems propagating throughout the universe, representing us humans.</p>
<p>They represent us humans in the sense they represent our knowledge and our history,</p>
<p>not us individually. Right. Right. But I mean, the question is, is it just a database</p>
<p>with, uh, with the really damn good, uh, model of the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conscious, it&rsquo;s conscious just like us. Okay. But just different?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different. Uh, just like my children are different. They&rsquo;re like me, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>different. Um, these are more different. I guess maybe I&rsquo;ve already, I kind of,</p>
<p>I take a very broad view of our life here on earth. I say, you know, why are we living here?</p>
<p>Are we just living because we live? Is it, are we surviving because we can survive? Are we fighting</p>
<p>just because we want to just keep going? What&rsquo;s the point of it? Right. So to me, the point,</p>
<p>if I asked myself, what&rsquo;s the point of life is what&rsquo;s transcends that ephemeral sort of biological</p>
<p>experience is to me, this is my answer is the acquisition of knowledge to understand more about</p>
<p>the universe, uh, and to explore. And that&rsquo;s partly to learn more. Right. Um, I don&rsquo;t view it as</p>
<p>a terrible thing. If the ultimate outcome of humanity is we create systems that are intelligent</p>
<p>that are offspring, but they&rsquo;re not like us at all. And we stay, we stay here and live on earth</p>
<p>as long as we can, which won&rsquo;t be forever, but as long as we can and, but that would be a great</p>
<p>thing to do. It&rsquo;s not a, it&rsquo;s not like a negative thing. Well, would, uh, you be okay then if, uh,</p>
<p>the human species vanishes, but our knowledge is preserved and keeps being expanded by intelligence</p>
<p>systems. I want our knowledge to be preserved and expanded. Yeah. Am I okay with humans dying? No,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that to happen. But if it, if it does happen, what if we were sitting here and this is</p>
<p>all the real, the last two people on earth and we&rsquo;re saying, Lex, we blew it. It&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>Right. Wouldn&rsquo;t I feel better if I knew that our knowledge was preserved and that we had agents</p>
<p>that knew about that, that were trans, you know, there were that left earth. I wouldn&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>Mm. It&rsquo;s better than not having that, you know, I make the analogy of like, you know,</p>
<p>the dinosaurs, the poor dinosaurs, they live for, you know, tens of millions of years.</p>
<p>They raised their kids. They, you know, they, they fought to survive. They were hungry. They,</p>
<p>they did everything we do. And then they&rsquo;re all gone. Yeah. Like, you know, and, and if we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>discover their bones, nobody would ever know that they ever existed. Right. Do we want to be like</p>
<p>that? I don&rsquo;t want to be like that. There&rsquo;s a sad aspect to it. And it&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s jarring to</p>
<p>think about that. It&rsquo;s possible that a human like intelligence civilization has previously existed</p>
<p>on earth. The reason I say this is like, it is jarring to think that we would not, if they went</p>
<p>extinct, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to find evidence of them after a sufficient amount of time. Of course,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like, like basically humans, like if we destroy ourselves now, the human civilization</p>
<p>destroyed ourselves. Now, after a sufficient amount of time, we would not be, we&rsquo;d find evidence of</p>
<p>the dinosaurs would not find evidence of humans. Yeah. That&rsquo;s kind of an odd thing to think about.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m not sure if we have enough knowledge about species going back for billions of years,</p>
<p>but we could, we could, we might be able to eliminate that possibility, but it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>question. Of course, this is a similar question to, you know, there were lots of intelligent</p>
<p>species throughout our galaxy that have all disappeared. That&rsquo;s super sad that they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>exactly that there may have been much more intelligent alien civilizations in our galaxy</p>
<p>that are no longer there. Yeah. You actually talked about this, that humans might destroy</p>
<p>ourselves and how we might preserve our knowledge and advertise that knowledge to other. Advertise</p>
<p>is a funny word to use. From a PR perspective. There&rsquo;s no financial gain in this.</p>
<p>You know, like make it like from a tourism perspective, make it interesting. Can you</p>
<p>describe how you think about this problem? Well, there&rsquo;s a couple things. I broke it down</p>
<p>into two parts, actually three parts. One is, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of things we know that,</p>
<p>what if, what if we were, what if we ended, what if our civilization collapsed? Yeah. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>talking tomorrow. Yeah. We could be a thousand years from now, like, so, you know, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know, but, but historically it would be likely at some point. Time flies when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having fun. Yeah. That&rsquo;s a good way to put it. You know, could we, and then intelligent life</p>
<p>evolved again on this planet. Wouldn&rsquo;t they want to know a lot about us and what we knew? Wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to ask us questions? So one very simple thing I said, how would we archive</p>
<p>what we know? That was a very simple idea. I said, you know what, that wouldn&rsquo;t be that hard to put</p>
<p>a few satellites, you know, going around the sun and we&rsquo;d upload Wikipedia every day and that kind</p>
<p>of thing. So, you know, if we end up killing ourselves, well, it&rsquo;s up there and the next intelligent</p>
<p>species will find it and learn something. They would like that. They would appreciate that.</p>
<p>Um, uh, so that&rsquo;s one thing. The next thing I said, well, what if, you know, how outside,</p>
<p>outside of our solar system, we have the SETI program. We&rsquo;re looking for these intelligent</p>
<p>signals from everybody. And if you do a little bit of math, which I did in the book, uh, and</p>
<p>you say, well, what if intelligent species only live for 10,000 years before, you know,</p>
<p>technologically intelligent species, like ones are really able to do the stuff we&rsquo;re just starting</p>
<p>to be able to do. Um, well, the chances are we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see any of them because they</p>
<p>would have all been disappeared by now. Um, they would, they&rsquo;ve lived for 10,000 years and now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gone. And so we&rsquo;re not going to find these signals being sent from these people because, um,</p>
<p>but I said, what kind of signal could you create that would last a million years or a billion years</p>
<p>that someone would say, dammit, someone smart lived there that we know that that would be a</p>
<p>life changing event for us to figure that out. Well, what we&rsquo;re looking for today in the study</p>
<p>program, isn&rsquo;t that we&rsquo;re looking for very coded signals in some sense. Um, and so I asked myself,</p>
<p>what would be a different type of signal one could create? Um, I&rsquo;ve always thought about</p>
<p>this throughout my life. And in the book, I gave one, one possible suggestion, which was, um, uh,</p>
<p>we now detect planets going around other, other suns, uh, other stars, uh, excuse me. And we do</p>
<p>that by seeing this, the, the slight dimming of the light as the planets move in front of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how, uh, we detect, uh, planets elsewhere in our galaxy. Um, what if we created something</p>
<p>like that, that just rotated around our, our, our, around the sun and it blocked out a little</p>
<p>bit of light in a particular pattern that someone said, Hey, that&rsquo;s not a planet. That is a sign</p>
<p>that someone was once there. You can say, what if it&rsquo;s beating up pie, you know, three point,</p>
<p>whatever. Um, so I did it from a distance. Broadly broadcast takes no continue activation on our</p>
<p>part. This is the key, right? No one has to be senior running a computer and supplying it with</p>
<p>power. It just goes on. So we go, it&rsquo;s continuous. And, and I argued that part of the study program</p>
<p>should be looking for signals like that. And to look for signals like that, you ought to figure</p>
<p>out what the, how would we create a signal? Like what would we create that would be like that,</p>
<p>that would persist for millions of years that would be broadcast broadly. You could see from</p>
<p>a distance that was unequivocal, came from an intelligent species. And so I gave that one</p>
<p>example. Um, cause they don&rsquo;t know what I know of actually. And then, and then finally, right.</p>
<p>If, if our, ultimately our solar system will die at some point in time, you know, how do we go</p>
<p>beyond that? And I think it&rsquo;s possible if it all possible, we&rsquo;ll have to create intelligent machines</p>
<p>that travel throughout the, throughout the solar system or the galaxy. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be humans. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be biological organisms. So these are just things to</p>
<p>think about, you know, like, what&rsquo;s the old, you know, I don&rsquo;t want to be like the dinosaur. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to just live in, okay, that was it. We&rsquo;re done. You know, well, there is a kind of</p>
<p>presumption that we&rsquo;re going to live forever, which, uh, I think it is a bit sad to imagine</p>
<p>that the message we send as, as you talk about is that we were once here instead of we are here.</p>
<p>Well, it could be, we are still here. Uh, but it&rsquo;s more of a, it&rsquo;s more of an insurance policy</p>
<p>in case we&rsquo;re not here, you know? Well, I don&rsquo;t know, but there is something I think about,</p>
<p>we as humans don&rsquo;t often think about this, but it&rsquo;s like, like whenever I, um,</p>
<p>record a video, I&rsquo;ve done this a couple of times in my life. I&rsquo;ve recorded a video for my future</p>
<p>self, just for personal, just for fun. And it&rsquo;s always just fascinating to think about</p>
<p>that preserving yourself for future civilizations. For me, it was preserving myself for a future me,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a little, that&rsquo;s a little fun example of archival.</p>
<p>Well, these podcasts are, are, are preserving you and I in a way. Yeah. For future,</p>
<p>hopefully well after we&rsquo;re gone. But you don&rsquo;t often, we&rsquo;re sitting here talking about this.</p>
<p>You are not thinking about the fact that you and I are going to die and there&rsquo;ll be like 10 years</p>
<p>after somebody watching this and we&rsquo;re still alive. You know, in some sense I do. I&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>cause I want to talk about ideas and these ideas transcend me and they transcend this time and, and</p>
<p>on our planet. Um, we&rsquo;re talking here about ideas that could be around a thousand years from now.</p>
<p>Or a million years from now. I, when I wrote my book, I had an audience in mind and one of the</p>
<p>clearest audiences was aliens. No. Were people reading this a hundred years from now? Yes.</p>
<p>I said to myself, how do I make this book relevant to someone reading this a hundred years from now?</p>
<p>What would they want to know that we were thinking back then? What would make it like,</p>
<p>that was an interesting, it&rsquo;s still an interesting book. I&rsquo;m not sure I can achieve that, but that was</p>
<p>how I thought about it because these ideas, like especially in the third part of the book, the ones</p>
<p>we were just talking about, you know, these crazy, sounds like crazy ideas about, you know,</p>
<p>storing our knowledge and, and, you know, merging our brains with computers and, and sending, you</p>
<p>know, our machines out into space. It&rsquo;s not going to happen in my lifetime. Um, and they may not</p>
<p>have been happening in the next hundred years. They may not happen for a thousand years. Who knows?</p>
<p>Uh, but we have the unique opportunity right now. We, you, me, and other people in the world,</p>
<p>right now, we, you, me, and other people like this, um, to sort of at least propose the agenda,</p>
<p>um, that might impact the future like that. That&rsquo;s a fascinating way to think, uh, both like</p>
<p>writing or creating, try to make, try to create ideas, try to create things that, uh, hold up</p>
<p>in time. Yeah. You know, when understanding how the brain works, we&rsquo;re going to figure that out</p>
<p>once. That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s going to be figured out once. And after that, that&rsquo;s the answer. And</p>
<p>people will, people will study that thousands of years now. We still, we still, you know,</p>
<p>venerate Newton and, and Einstein and, um, and, you know, because, because ideas are exciting,</p>
<p>even well into the future. Well, the interesting thing is like big ideas, even if they&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>are still useful. Like, yeah, especially if they&rsquo;re not completely wrong, right? Right.</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s laws are not wrong. They&rsquo;re just Einstein&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re better. Um, so yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re talking with Newton and Einstein, we&rsquo;re talking about physics. I wonder if we&rsquo;ll ever</p>
<p>achieve that kind of clarity, but understanding, um, like complex systems and the, this particular</p>
<p>manifestation of complex systems, which is the human brain. I&rsquo;m totally optimistic. We can do</p>
<p>that. I mean, we&rsquo;re making progress at it. I don&rsquo;t see any reasons why we can&rsquo;t completely. I mean,</p>
<p>completely understand in the sense, um, you know, we don&rsquo;t really completely understand what all</p>
<p>the molecules in this water bottle are doing, but, you know, we have laws that sort of capture it</p>
<p>pretty good. Um, and, uh, so we&rsquo;ll have that kind of understanding. I mean, it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to know what every neuron in your brain is doing. Um, but enough to, um, first of all,</p>
<p>to build it. And second of all, to do, you know, do what physics does, which is like have, uh,</p>
<p>concrete experiments where we can validate this is happening right now. Like it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>this is not some future thing. Um, you know, I&rsquo;m very optimistic about it because I know about our,</p>
<p>our work and what we&rsquo;re doing. We&rsquo;ll have to prove it to people. Um, but, um,</p>
<p>I, I consider myself a rational person and, um, you know, until fairly recently,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have said that, but right now I&rsquo;m, where I&rsquo;m sitting right now, I&rsquo;m saying, you know,</p>
<p>we, we could, this is going to happen. There&rsquo;s no big obstacles to it. Um, we finally have a</p>
<p>framework for understanding what&rsquo;s going on in the cortex and, um, and that&rsquo;s liberating. It&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, Oh, it&rsquo;s happening. So I can&rsquo;t see why we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to understand it. I just can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Okay. So, I mean, on that topic, let me ask you to play devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>Is it possible for you to imagine, look, look a hundred years from now and looking at your book,</p>
<p>uh, in which ways might your ideas be wrong? Oh, I worry about this all the time. Um,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s still useful. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think there&rsquo;s, you know, um, well I can, I can best relate it to like things I&rsquo;m worried</p>
<p>about right now. So we talked about this voting idea, right? It&rsquo;s happening. There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening, but it could be far more, um, um, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s enough things I don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>it that it might be working into ways differently than I&rsquo;m thinking about the kind of what&rsquo;s voting,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s voting, you know, where are representations? I talked about, like, you have a thousand models</p>
<p>of a coffee cup like that. That could turn out to be wrong. Um, because it may be, maybe there are a</p>
<p>thousand models that are sub models, but not really a single model of the coffee cup. Um,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s things, these are all sort of on the edges, things that I present as like,</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s so simple and clean. Well, it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s always going to be more complex.</p>
<p>And, um, and there&rsquo;s parts of the theory, which I don&rsquo;t understand the complexity well. So I think,</p>
<p>I think the idea that this brain is a distributed modeling system is not controversial at all. Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s well understood by many people. The question then is,</p>
<p>are each quarter of a column an independent modeling system? Um, I could be wrong about that.</p>
<p>Um, I don&rsquo;t think so, but I worry about it. My intuition, not even thinking why you could</p>
<p>be wrong is the same intuition I have about any sort of physicist, uh, like string theory</p>
<p>that we as humans desire for a clean explanation. And, uh, a hundred years from now, uh,</p>
<p>intelligent systems might look back at us and laugh at how we try to get rid of the whole mess</p>
<p>by having simple explanation when the reality is it&rsquo;s way messier. And in fact, it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>to understand. You can only build it. It&rsquo;s like this idea of complex systems and cellular automata</p>
<p>is you can only launch the thing. You cannot understand it. Yeah. I think that, you know,</p>
<p>the history of science suggests that&rsquo;s not likely to occur. Um, the history of science suggests that</p>
<p>as a theorist and we&rsquo;re theorists, you look for simple explanations, right? Fully knowing</p>
<p>that whatever simple explanation you&rsquo;re going to come up with is not going to be completely correct.</p>
<p>I mean, it can&rsquo;t be, I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just more complexity, but that&rsquo;s the role of theorists</p>
<p>play. They, they sort of, they give you a framework on which you now can talk about a problem and</p>
<p>figure out, okay, now we can start digging more details. The best frameworks stick around while</p>
<p>the details change. You know, again, you know, the classic example is Newton and Einstein, right? You</p>
<p>know, um, Newton&rsquo;s theories are still used. They&rsquo;re still valuable. They&rsquo;re still practical. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not like wrong. It&rsquo;s just, they&rsquo;ve been refined. Yeah. But that&rsquo;s in physics. It&rsquo;s not obvious,</p>
<p>by the way, it&rsquo;s not obvious for physics either that the universe should be such that&rsquo;s amenable</p>
<p>to these simple. But it&rsquo;s so far, it appears to be as far as we can tell. Um, yeah. I mean,</p>
<p>but as far as we could tell, and, but it&rsquo;s also an open question whether the brain is amenable to</p>
<p>such clean theories. That&rsquo;s the, uh, not the brain, but intelligence. Well, I, I, I don&rsquo;t know. I would</p>
<p>take intelligence out of it. Just say, you know, um, well, okay. Um, the evidence we have suggests</p>
<p>that the human brain is, is a, at the one time extremely messy and complex, but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>parts that are very regular and structured. That&rsquo;s why we started the neocortex. It&rsquo;s extremely</p>
<p>regular in its structure. Yeah. And unbelievably so. And then I mentioned earlier, the other thing is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s universal abilities. It is so flexible to learn so many things. We don&rsquo;t, we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>figured out what it can&rsquo;t learn yet. We don&rsquo;t know, but we haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet, but it</p>
<p>can learn things that it never was evolved to learn. So those give us hope. Um, that&rsquo;s why I</p>
<p>went into this field because I said, you know, this regular structure, it&rsquo;s doing this amazing</p>
<p>number of things. There&rsquo;s gotta be some underlying principles that are, that are common and other,</p>
<p>other scientists have come up with the same conclusions. Um, and so it&rsquo;s promising and,</p>
<p>um, and that&rsquo;s, and whether the theories play out exactly this way or not, that is the role that</p>
<p>theorists play. And so far it&rsquo;s worked out well, even though, you know, maybe, you know, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand all the laws of physics, but so far it&rsquo;s been pretty damn useful. The ones we have</p>
<p>are our theories are pretty useful. You mentioned that, uh, we should not necessarily be,</p>
<p>at least to the degree that we are worried about the existential risks of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>relative to, uh, human risks from human nature being existential risk.</p>
<p>What aspect of human nature worries you the most in terms of the survival of the human species?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m disappointed in humanity, humans. I mean, all of us, I&rsquo;m one. So I&rsquo;m disappointed</p>
<p>myself too. Um, it&rsquo;s kind of a sad state. There&rsquo;s two things that disappoint me. One is</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s difficult for us to separate our rational component of ourselves from our evolutionary</p>
<p>heritage, which is, you know, not always pretty, you know, um, uh, rape is a, is an evolutionary</p>
<p>good strategy for reproduction. Murder can be at times too, you know, making other people miserable</p>
<p>at times is a good strategy for reproduction. It&rsquo;s just, and it&rsquo;s just, and, and so now that</p>
<p>we know that, and yet we have this sort of, you know, we, you and I can have this very rational</p>
<p>discussion talking about, you know, intelligence and brains and life and so on. So many, it seems</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s so hard. It&rsquo;s just a big, big transition to get humans, all humans to, to make the</p>
<p>transition from be like, let&rsquo;s pay no attention to all that ugly stuff over here. Let&rsquo;s just focus</p>
<p>on the interesting. What&rsquo;s unique about humanity is our knowledge and our intellect. But the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re striving is in itself amazing, right? The fact that we&rsquo;re able to overcome that part.</p>
<p>And it seems like we are more and more becoming successful at overcoming that part. That is the</p>
<p>optimistic view. And I agree with you, but I worry about it. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m worrying about it. I</p>
<p>think that was your question. I still worry about it. Yes. You know, we could be in tomorrow because</p>
<p>some terrorists could get nuclear bombs and, you know, blow us all up. Who knows? Right. The other</p>
<p>thing I think I&rsquo;m disappointed is, and it&rsquo;s just, I understand it. It&rsquo;s, I guess you can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>be disappointed. It&rsquo;s just a fact is that we&rsquo;re so prone to false beliefs that we, you know, we have</p>
<p>a model in our head, the things we can interact with directly, physical objects, people, that</p>
<p>model is pretty good. And we can test it all the time, right? I touch something, I look at it,</p>
<p>talk to you, see if my model is correct. But so much of what we know is stuff I can&rsquo;t directly</p>
<p>interact with. I only know because someone told me about it. And so we&rsquo;re prone, inherently prone</p>
<p>to having false beliefs because if I&rsquo;m told something, how am I going to know it&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>or wrong? Right. And so then we have the scientific process, which says we are inherently flawed.</p>
<p>So the only way we can get closer to the truth is by looking for contrary evidence.</p>
<p>Yeah. Like this conspiracy theory, this theory that scientists keep telling me about that the</p>
<p>earth is round. As far as I can tell, when I look out, it looks pretty flat.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, yeah, there is a tension, but it&rsquo;s also, I tend to believe that we haven&rsquo;t figured</p>
<p>out most of this thing, right? Most of nature around us is a mystery. And so it&hellip;</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t, does that worry you? I mean, it&rsquo;s like, oh, that&rsquo;s like a pleasure,</p>
<p>more to figure out, right? Yeah. That&rsquo;s exciting. But I&rsquo;m saying like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of quote unquote, wrong ideas. I mean, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about</p>
<p>engineering systems like social networks and so on. And I&rsquo;ve been worried about censorship</p>
<p>and thinking through all that kind of stuff, because there&rsquo;s a lot of wrong ideas. There&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of dangerous ideas, but then I also read a history, read history and see when you censor</p>
<p>ideas that are wrong. Now this could be a small scale censorship, like a young grad student who</p>
<p>comes up, who like raises their hand and says some crazy idea. A form of censorship could be,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t use the word censorship, but like de incentivize them from no, no, no, no,</p>
<p>this is the way it&rsquo;s been done. Yeah. Yeah. You&rsquo;re a foolish kid. Don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s it. Yeah. You&rsquo;re foolish. So in some sense,</p>
<p>those wrong ideas, most of the time end up being wrong, but sometimes end up being</p>
<p>I agree with you. So I don&rsquo;t like the word censorship. Um, at the very end of the book, I,</p>
<p>I ended up with a sort of a, um, a plea or a recommended force of action. Um, the best way I</p>
<p>could, I know how to deal with this issue that you bring up is if everybody understood as part of</p>
<p>your upbringing in life, something about how your brain works, that it builds a model of the world,</p>
<p>uh, how it works, you know, how basically it builds that model of the world and that the model</p>
<p>is not the real world. It&rsquo;s just a model and it&rsquo;s never going to reflect the entire world. And it</p>
<p>can be wrong and it&rsquo;s easy to be wrong. And here&rsquo;s all the ways you can get a wrong model in your</p>
<p>head. Right? It&rsquo;s not prescribed what&rsquo;s right or wrong. Just understand that process. If we all</p>
<p>understood the processes and I got together and you say, I disagree with you, Jeff. And I said,</p>
<p>Lex, I disagree with you that at least we understand that we&rsquo;re both trying to model</p>
<p>something. We both have different information, which leads to our different models. And therefore</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t hold it against you and you shouldn&rsquo;t hold it against me. And we can at least agree that,</p>
<p>well, what can we look for in that&rsquo;s common ground to test our, our beliefs, as opposed to so much,</p>
<p>uh, as we raise our kids on dogma, which is this is a fact, this is a fact, and these people are</p>
<p>bad. And, and, and, you know, where every, if everyone knew just to, to be skeptical of every</p>
<p>belief and why, and how their brains do that, I think we might have a better world.</p>
<p>Do you think the human mind is able to comprehend reality? So you talk about this creating models</p>
<p>how close do you think we get to, uh, to reality? There&rsquo;s so the wildest ideas is like Donald</p>
<p>Hoffman saying, we&rsquo;re very far away from reality. Do you think we&rsquo;re getting close to reality?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on what you define reality. Uh, we are getting, we have a model of the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very useful, right? For, for basic goals. Well, for our survival and our pleasure right</p>
<p>now. Right. Um, so that&rsquo;s useful. Um, I mean, it&rsquo;s really useful. Oh, we can build planes. We can build computers. We can do these things. Right.</p>
<p>Uh, I don&rsquo;t think, I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question. Um, I think that&rsquo;s part of the</p>
<p>question we&rsquo;re trying to figure out, right? Like, you know, obviously if you end up with a theory of</p>
<p>everything that really is a theory of everything and all of a sudden everything comes into play</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no room for something else, then you might feel like we have a good model of the world.</p>
<p>Yeah. But if we have a theory of everything and somehow, first of all, you&rsquo;ll never be able to</p>
<p>really conclusively say it&rsquo;s a theory of everything, but say somehow we are very damn sure it&rsquo;s a theory</p>
<p>of everything. We understand what happened at the big bang and how just the entirety of the</p>
<p>physical process. I&rsquo;m still not sure that gives us an understanding of, uh, the next</p>
<p>many layers of the hierarchy of abstractions that form. Well, also what if string theory</p>
<p>turns out to be true? And then you say, well, we have no reality, no modeling what&rsquo;s going on in</p>
<p>those other dimensions that are wrapped into it on each other. Right. Or, or the multiverse,</p>
<p>you know, I honestly don&rsquo;t know how for us, for human interaction, for ideas of intelligence,</p>
<p>how it helps us to understand that we&rsquo;re made up of vibrating strings that are</p>
<p>like 10 to the whatever times smaller than us. I don&rsquo;t, you know, you could probably build better</p>
<p>weapons, a better rockets, but you&rsquo;re not going to be able to understand intelligence. I guess,</p>
<p>I guess maybe better computers. No, you won&rsquo;t be. I think it&rsquo;s just more purely knowledge.</p>
<p>You might lead to a better understanding of the, of the beginning of the universe,</p>
<p>right? It might lead to a better understanding of, uh, I don&rsquo;t know. I guess I think the acquisition</p>
<p>of knowledge has always been one where you, you pursue it for its own pleasure. Um, and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always know what is going to make a difference. Yeah. Uh, you&rsquo;re pleasantly surprised by the,</p>
<p>the weird things you find. Do you think, uh, for the, for the neocortex in general, do you,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s a lot of innovation to be done on the machine side? You know,</p>
<p>you use the computer as a metaphor quite a bit. Is there different types of computer that would</p>
<p>help us build intelligence manifestations of intelligent machines? Yeah. Or is it, oh no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be totally crazy. Uh, we have no idea how this is going to look out yet.</p>
<p>You can already see this. Um, today we&rsquo;ve, of course, we model these things on traditional</p>
<p>computers and now, now GPUs are really popular with, with, uh, you know, neural networks and so</p>
<p>on. Um, but there are companies coming up with fundamentally new physical substrates, um, that</p>
<p>are just really cool. I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re going to work or not. Um, but I think there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be decades of innovation here. Yeah. Totally. Do you think the final thing will be messy,</p>
<p>like our biology is messy? Or do you think, uh, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s the old bird versus</p>
<p>airplane question, or do you think we could just, um, build airplanes that, that fly way better</p>
<p>than birds in the same way we could build, uh, uh, electrical neocortex? Yeah. You know,</p>
<p>can I, can I, can I riff on the bird thing a bit? Because I think that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>People really misunderstand this. The Wright brothers, um, the problem they were trying to</p>
<p>solve was controlled flight, how to turn an airplane, not how to propel an airplane.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t worried about that. Interesting. Yeah. They already had, at that time,</p>
<p>there was already wing shapes, which they had from studying birds. There was already gliders</p>
<p>that carry people. The problem was if you put a rudder on the back of a glider and you turn it,</p>
<p>the plane falls out of the sky. So the problem was how do you control flight? And they studied</p>
<p>birds and they actually had birds in captivity. They watched birds in wind tunnels. They observed</p>
<p>them in the wild and they discovered the secret was the birds twist their wings when they turn.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what they did on the Wright brothers flyer. They had these sticks that</p>
<p>you would twist the wing. And that was the, that was their innovation, not the propeller.</p>
<p>And today airplanes still twist their wings. We don&rsquo;t twist the entire wing. We just twist</p>
<p>the tail end of it, the flaps, which is the same thing. So today&rsquo;s airplanes fly on the</p>
<p>same principles as birds would observe. So everyone get that analogy wrong, but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>step back from that. Once you understand the principles of flight, you can choose</p>
<p>how to implement them. No one&rsquo;s going to use bones and feathers and muscles, but they do have wings</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t flap them. We have propellers. So when we have the principles of computation that</p>
<p>goes on to modeling the world in a brain, we understand those principles very clearly.</p>
<p>We have choices on how to implement them. And some of them will be biological like and some won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And, but I do think there&rsquo;s going to be a huge amount of innovation here.</p>
<p>Just think about the innovation when in the computer, they had to invent the transistor,</p>
<p>they invented the Silicon chip. They had to invent, you know, then this software. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s millions of things they had to do, memory systems. We&rsquo;re going to do, it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>similar. Well, it&rsquo;s interesting that the deep learning, the effectiveness of deep learning for</p>
<p>specific tasks is driving a lot of innovation in the hardware, which may have effects for actually</p>
<p>allowing us to discover intelligence systems that operate very differently or at least much</p>
<p>bigger than deep learning. Yeah. Interesting. So ultimately it&rsquo;s good to have an application</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s making our life better now because the capitalist process, if you can make money.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. That works. I mean, the other way, I mean, Neil deGrasse Tyson writes about this</p>
<p>is the other way we fund science, of course, is through military. So like, yeah. Conquests.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an interesting thing we&rsquo;re doing on this regard. So we&rsquo;ve decided, we used to have</p>
<p>a series of these biological principles and we can see how to build these intelligent machines,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve decided to apply some of these principles to today&rsquo;s machine learning techniques.</p>
<p>So one of the, we didn&rsquo;t talk about this principle. One is a sparsity in the brain,</p>
<p>um, most of the neurons are active at any point in time. It&rsquo;s sparse and the connectivity is sparse</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s different than deep learning networks. Um, so we&rsquo;ve already shown that we can speed up</p>
<p>existing deep learning networks, uh, anywhere from 10 to a factor of a hundred. I mean,</p>
<p>literally a hundred, um, and make a more robust at the same time. So this is commercially very,</p>
<p>very valuable. Um, and so, you know, if we can prove this actually in the largest systems that</p>
<p>are commercially applied today, there&rsquo;s a big commercial desire to do this. Well,</p>
<p>sparsity is something that doesn&rsquo;t run really well on existing hardware. It doesn&rsquo;t really run</p>
<p>really well, um, on, um, GPUs, um, and on CPUs. And so that would be a way of sort of bringing more,</p>
<p>more brain principles into the existing system on a, on a commercially valuable basis.</p>
<p>Another thing we can think we can do is we&rsquo;re going to use these dendrites,</p>
<p>um, models that we, uh, I talked earlier about the prediction occurring inside a neuron</p>
<p>that that basic property can be applied to existing neural networks and allow them to</p>
<p>learn continuously, which is something they don&rsquo;t do today. And so the dendritic spikes that you</p>
<p>were talking about. Yeah. Well, we wouldn&rsquo;t model the spikes, but the idea that you have</p>
<p>that neuron today&rsquo;s neural networks have this company called the point neurons is a very simple</p>
<p>model of a neuron. And, uh, by adding dendrites to them at just one more level of complexity,</p>
<p>uh, that&rsquo;s in biological systems, you can solve problems in continuous learning, um,</p>
<p>and rapid learning. So we&rsquo;re trying to take, we&rsquo;re trying to bring the existing field,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see if we can do it. We&rsquo;re trying to bring the existing field of machine learning,</p>
<p>um, commercially along with us, you brought up this idea of keeping, you know,</p>
<p>paying for it commercially along with us as we move towards the ultimate goal of a true AI system.</p>
<p>Even small innovations on your own networks are really, really exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it seems like such a trivial model of the brain and applying different insights</p>
<p>that just even, like you said, continuous, uh, learning or, uh, making it more asynchronous</p>
<p>or maybe making more dynamic or like, uh, incentivizing, making it robust and making it</p>
<p>somehow much better incentivizing sparsity, uh, somehow. Yeah. Well, if you can make things a</p>
<p>hundred times faster, then there&rsquo;s plenty of incentive. That&rsquo;s true. People, people are</p>
<p>spending millions of dollars, you know, just training some of these networks. Now these, uh,</p>
<p>these transforming networks, let me ask you the big question for young people listening to this</p>
<p>today in high school and college, what advice would you give them in terms of, uh, which career</p>
<p>path to take and, um, maybe just about life in general? Well, in my case, um, I didn&rsquo;t start</p>
<p>life with any kind of goals. I was, when I was going to college, it&rsquo;s like, Oh, what do I study?</p>
<p>Well, maybe I&rsquo;ll do this electrical engineering stuff, you know? Um, it wasn&rsquo;t like, you know,</p>
<p>today you see some of these young kids are so motivated, like I&rsquo;m changing the world. I was</p>
<p>like, you know, whatever. And, um, but then I did fall in love with something besides my wife,</p>
<p>but I fell in love with this, like, Oh my God, it would be so cool to understand how the brain works.</p>
<p>And then I, I said to myself, that&rsquo;s the most important thing I could work on. I can&rsquo;t imagine</p>
<p>anything more important because if we understand how the brains work, you build tells the machines</p>
<p>and they could figure out all the other big questions of the world. Right. So, and then I</p>
<p>said, but I want to understand how I work. So I fell in love with this idea and I became passionate</p>
<p>about it. And this is a trope. People say this, but it was, it&rsquo;s true because I was passionate</p>
<p>about it. I was able to put up almost so much crap, you know, you know, I was, I was in that,</p>
<p>you know, I was like person said, you can&rsquo;t do this. I was, I was a graduate student at Berkeley</p>
<p>when they said, you can&rsquo;t study this problem, you know, no one&rsquo;s can solve this or you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>funded for it. You know, then I went into do mobile computing and it was like, people say,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that. You can&rsquo;t build a cell phone, you know? So, but all along I kept being motivated</p>
<p>because I wanted to work on this problem. I said, I want to understand the brain works. And I got</p>
<p>myself, you know, I got one lifetime. I&rsquo;m going to figure it out, do the best I can. So by having</p>
<p>that, cause you know, it&rsquo;s really, as you pointed out, Lex, it&rsquo;s really hard to do these things.</p>
<p>People, it just, there&rsquo;s so many downers along the way. So many ways, obstacles to get in your</p>
<p>way. Yeah. I&rsquo;m sitting here happy all the time, but trust me, it&rsquo;s not always like that.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, I guess the happiness, the passion is a prerequisite for surviving the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so. I think that&rsquo;s right. And so I don&rsquo;t want to sit to someone and say, you know,</p>
<p>you need to find a passion and do it. No, maybe you don&rsquo;t. But if you do find something you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>passionate about, then you can follow it as far as your passion will let you put up with it.</p>
<p>Do you remember how you found it? How the spark happened?</p>
<p>Why specifically for me?</p>
<p>Yeah. Cause you said it&rsquo;s such an interesting, so like almost like later in life, by later,</p>
<p>I mean like not when you were five, you didn&rsquo;t really know. And then all of a sudden you fell</p>
<p>in love with that idea. Yeah, yeah. There was two separate events that compounded one another.</p>
<p>One, when I was probably a teenager, it might&rsquo;ve been 17 or 18, I made a list of the most</p>
<p>interesting problems I could think of. First was why does the universe exist? It seems like</p>
<p>not existing is more likely. The second one was, well, given it exists, why does it behave the way</p>
<p>it does? Laws of physics, why is it equal MC squared, not MC cubed? That&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>question. The third one was like, what&rsquo;s the origin of life? And the fourth one was, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>intelligence? And I stopped there. I said, well, that&rsquo;s probably the most interesting one. And I</p>
<p>put that aside as a teenager. But then when I was 22 and I was reading the, no, excuse me, it was</p>
<p>1979, excuse me, 1979, I was reading, so I was, at that time I was 22, I was reading the September</p>
<p>issue of Scientific American, which is all about the brain. And then the final essay was by Francis</p>
<p>Crick, who of DNA fame, and he had taken his interest to studying the brain now. And he said,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s something wrong here. He says, we got all this data, all this fact, this is 1979,</p>
<p>all these facts about the brain, tons and tons of facts about the brain. Do we need more facts? Or do</p>
<p>we just need to think about a way of rearranging the facts we have? Maybe we&rsquo;re just not thinking</p>
<p>about the problem correctly. Cause he says, this shouldn&rsquo;t be like this. So I read that and I said,</p>
<p>wow. I said, I don&rsquo;t have to become like an experimental neuroscientist. I could just</p>
<p>take, look at all those facts and try and become a theoretician and try to figure it out. And I said</p>
<p>that I felt like it was something I would be good at. I said, I wouldn&rsquo;t be a good experimentalist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the patience for it, but I&rsquo;m a good thinker and I love puzzles. And this is like the</p>
<p>biggest puzzle in the world. It&rsquo;s the biggest puzzle of all time. And I got all the puzzle</p>
<p>pieces in front of me. Damn, that was exciting. And there&rsquo;s something obviously you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>convert into words that just kind of sparked this passion. And I have that a few times in my life,</p>
<p>just something just like you, it grabs you. Yeah. I felt it was something that was both</p>
<p>important and that I could make a contribution to. And so all of a sudden it felt like,</p>
<p>oh, it gave me purpose in life. I honestly don&rsquo;t think it has to be as big as one of those four</p>
<p>questions. I think you can find those things in the smallest. Oh, absolutely. David Foster Wallace</p>
<p>said like the key to life is to be unboreable. I think it&rsquo;s very possible to find that intensity</p>
<p>of joy in the smallest thing. Absolutely. I&rsquo;m just, you asked me my story. Yeah. No, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually speaking to the audience. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be those four. You happen to get excited by one</p>
<p>of the bigger questions of in the universe, but even the smallest things and watching the Olympics</p>
<p>now, just giving yourself life, giving your life over to the study and the mastery of a particular</p>
<p>sport is fascinating. And if it sparks joy and passion, you&rsquo;re able to, in the case of the</p>
<p>Olympics, basically suffer for like a couple of decades to achieve. I mean, you can find joy and</p>
<p>passion just being a parent. I mean, yeah, the parenting one is funny. So I was, not always,</p>
<p>but for a long time, wanted kids and get married and stuff. And especially that has to do with the</p>
<p>fact that I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people that I respect get a whole nother level of joy from kids. And</p>
<p>at first is like, you&rsquo;re thinking is, well, like I don&rsquo;t have enough time in the day, right? If I</p>
<p>have this passion to solve, but like, if I want to solve intelligence, how&rsquo;s this kid situation</p>
<p>going to help me? But then you realize that, you know, like you said, the things that sparks joy,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very possible that kids can provide even a greater or deeper, more meaningful joy than</p>
<p>those bigger questions when they enrich each other. And that seemed like, obviously when I</p>
<p>was younger, it&rsquo;s probably a counterintuitive notion because there&rsquo;s only so many hours in the</p>
<p>day, but then life is finite and you have to pick the things that give you joy.</p>
<p>Yeah. But you also understand you can be patient too. I mean, it&rsquo;s finite, but we do have, you know,</p>
<p>whatever, 50 years or something. So in my case, I had to give up on my dream of the neuroscience</p>
<p>because I was a graduate student at Berkeley and they told me I couldn&rsquo;t do this and I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get funded. And so I went back in the computing industry for a number of years. I thought it</p>
<p>would be four, but it turned out to be more. But I said, I&rsquo;ll come back. I&rsquo;m definitely going to</p>
<p>come back. I know I&rsquo;m going to do this computer stuff for a while, but I&rsquo;m definitely coming back.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that. And it&rsquo;s like raising kids. Well, yeah, you have to spend a lot of time with</p>
<p>your kids. It&rsquo;s fun, enjoyable. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to give up on other dreams. It just</p>
<p>means that you may have to wait a week or two to work on that next idea. Well, you talk about the</p>
<p>darker side of me, disappointing sides of human nature that we&rsquo;re hoping to overcome so that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t destroy ourselves. I tend to put a lot of value in the broad general concept of love,</p>
<p>of the human capacity of compassion towards each other, of just kindness, whatever that longing of</p>
<p>like just the human to human connection. It connects back to our initial discussion. I tend to</p>
<p>see a lot of value in this collective intelligence aspect. I think some of the magic of human</p>
<p>civilization happens when there&rsquo;s a party is not as fun when you&rsquo;re alone. I totally agree with</p>
<p>you on these issues. Do you think from a neocortex perspective, what role does love play in the human</p>
<p>condition? Well, those are two separate things from a neocortex point of view. It doesn&rsquo;t impact</p>
<p>our thinking about the neocortex. From a human condition point of view, I think it&rsquo;s core.</p>
<p>I mean, we get so much pleasure out of loving people and helping people. I&rsquo;ll rack it up to</p>
<p>old brain stuff and maybe we can throw it under the bus of evolution if you want. That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t impact how I think about how we model the world, but from a humanity point of view,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s essential. Well, I tend to give it to the new brain and also I tend to give it to</p>
<p>the old brain. Also, I tend to think that some aspects of that need to be engineered into AI</p>
<p>systems, both in their ability to have compassion for other humans and their ability to maximize</p>
<p>love in the world between humans. I&rsquo;m more thinking about social networks. Whenever there&rsquo;s a deep</p>
<p>AI systems in humans, specific applications where it&rsquo;s AI and humans, I think that&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>often not talked about in terms of metrics over which you try to maximize,</p>
<p>like which metric to maximize in a system. It seems like one of the most</p>
<p>powerful things in societies is the capacity to love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating. I think it&rsquo;s a great way of thinking about it. I have been thinking more of</p>
<p>these fundamental mechanisms in the brain as opposed to the social interaction between humans</p>
<p>and AI systems in the future. If you think about that, you&rsquo;re absolutely right. That&rsquo;s a complex</p>
<p>system. I can have intelligent systems that don&rsquo;t have that component, but they&rsquo;re not interacting</p>
<p>with people. They&rsquo;re just running something or building some place or something. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But if you think about interacting with humans, yeah, but it has to be engineered in there. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to appear on its own. That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, we could, we&rsquo;ll leave that open. In terms of, from a reinforcement learning</p>
<p>perspective, whether the darker sides of human nature or the better angels of our nature win out,</p>
<p>statistically speaking, I don&rsquo;t know. I tend to be optimistic and hope that love wins out in the end.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done a lot of incredible stuff and your book is driving towards this fourth question that</p>
<p>you started with on the nature of intelligence. What do you hope your legacy for people reading</p>
<p>a hundred years from now? How do you hope they remember your work? How do you hope they remember</p>
<p>this book? Well, I think as an entrepreneur or a scientist or any human who&rsquo;s trying to accomplish</p>
<p>some things, I have a view that really all you can do is accelerate the inevitable. Yeah. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, if we didn&rsquo;t figure out, if we didn&rsquo;t study the brain, someone else will study the</p>
<p>brain. If, you know, if Elon didn&rsquo;t make electric cars, someone else would do it eventually.</p>
<p>And if, you know, if Thomas Edison didn&rsquo;t invent a light bulb, we wouldn&rsquo;t be using candles today.</p>
<p>So, what you can do as an individual is you can accelerate something that&rsquo;s beneficial</p>
<p>and make it happen sooner than it would have. That&rsquo;s really it. That&rsquo;s all you can do.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t create a new reality that it wasn&rsquo;t going to happen. So, from that perspective,</p>
<p>I would hope that our work, not just me, but our work in general, people would look back and said,</p>
<p>hey, they really helped make this better future happen sooner. They, you know, they helped us</p>
<p>understand the nature of false beliefs sooner than they might have. Now we&rsquo;re so happy that</p>
<p>we have these intelligent machines doing these things, helping us that maybe that solved the</p>
<p>climate change problem and they made it happen sooner. So, I think that&rsquo;s the best I would hope</p>
<p>for. Some would say those guys just moved the needle forward a little bit in time.</p>
<p>Well, I do. It feels like the progress of human civilization is not, is there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of trajectories. And if you have individuals that accelerate towards one direction that helps steer</p>
<p>human civilization. So, I think in those long stretch of time, all trajectories will be traveled.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s nice for this particular civilization on earth to travel down one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not. Well, I think you&rsquo;re right. We have to take the whole period of, you know, World War II,</p>
<p>Nazism or something like that. Well, that was a bad sidestep, right? We&rsquo;ve been over there for a</p>
<p>while. But, you know, there is the optimistic view about life that ultimately it does converge</p>
<p>in a positive way. It progresses ultimately, even if we have years of darkness. So, yeah. So,</p>
<p>I think you can perhaps that&rsquo;s accelerating the positive could also mean eliminating some bad</p>
<p>missteps along the way, too. But I&rsquo;m an optimistic in that way. Despite we talked about the end of</p>
<p>civilization, you know, I think we&rsquo;re going to live for a long time. I hope we are. I think our</p>
<p>society in the future is going to be better. We&rsquo;re going to have less discord. We&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>less people killing each other. You know, we&rsquo;ll make them live in some sort of way that&rsquo;s compatible</p>
<p>with the carrying capacity of the earth. I&rsquo;m optimistic these things will happen. And all we</p>
<p>can do is try to get there sooner. And at the very least, if we do destroy ourselves,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have a few satellites orbiting that will tell alien civilization that we were once here.</p>
<p>Or maybe our future, you know, future inhabitants of earth. You know, imagine we,</p>
<p>you know, the planet of the apes in here. You know, we kill ourselves, you know,</p>
<p>a million years from now or a billion years from now. There&rsquo;s another species on the planet.</p>
<p>Curious creatures were once here. Jeff, thank you so much for your work. And thank you so much for</p>
<p>talking to me once again. Well, actually, it&rsquo;s great. I love what you do. I love your podcast.</p>
<p>You have the most interesting people, me aside. So it&rsquo;s a real service, I think you do for,</p>
<p>in a very broader sense for humanity, I think. Thanks, Jeff. All right. It&rsquo;s a pleasure.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jeff Hawkins. And thank you to</p>
<p>Codecademy, BioOptimizers, ExpressVPN, Asleep, and Blinkist. Check them out in the description</p>
<p>to support this podcast. And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus.</p>
<p>An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself. I like this, because I&rsquo;m happy to be</p>
<p>both halves, the watcher and the watched. Can they be brought together? This is the</p>
<p>practical question we must try to answer. Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.</p>
