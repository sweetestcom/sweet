through a wormhole</p><p>they travel to a distant part in the galaxy</p><p>by folding the space and time together</p><p>like 2 pieces of paper</p><p>punching a hole through it</p><p>and arriving on the other end</p><p>but when they did that</p><p>they didn&rsquo;t realize that they actually went to hell</p><p>so these guys get to this Event Horizon ship</p><p>it comes back</p><p>everyone&rsquo;s dead</p><p>and they get a video of the crew</p><p>and the captain and everything</p><p>like they find out later in the movie</p><p>what happened to them</p><p>and they&rsquo;re pulling their own eyeballs out</p><p>and screaming shit in Latin</p><p>and killing each other and biting each other apart</p><p>cut each other open</p><p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s gonna look like</p><p>it&rsquo;s

fucking</p><p>money and what the hillbillies out</p><p>the real motherfuckers that you needed</p><p>in case you gotta go like woody</p><p>creek to find those people like you gotta go</p><p>woody creek is that</p><p>still fucking amateurs to really</p><p>bunch of fucking boozes up there you really</p><p>you got to go deep</p><p>deep in the mountains of gunnison and shit like that</p><p>find those crazy</p><p>gunderson gunnison</p><p>brian you got the volume on</p><p>we&rsquo;re echoing</p><p>gunnison gunderson</p><p>gunnison where&rsquo;s that</p><p>that&rsquo;s down south</p><p>what do you think</p><p>about all that shit</p><p>about the denver airport do you know anything</p><p>about the conspiracy behind the denver airport</p><p>where is it now</p><p>the denver airport</p><p>first of all they</p><p>moved way more dirt than they needed to</p><p>and so there&rsquo;s this</p><p>all this thought that there&rsquo;s some sort of subterranean</p><p>tunnel system</p><p>it&rsquo;s all based on the end of the world</p><p>and shelters</p><p>they fucked</p><p>up staple to the airport was a brilliant airport</p><p>it was like</p><p>burbank you could</p><p>smuggle a fucking dead fucking kilo coconut</p><p>nobody said nothing</p><p>and all of a</p><p>sudden they came up with a bright idea</p><p>let&rsquo;s fucking make an airport ninety</p><p>miles farther out by kansas</p><p>so when it snows we really get fucking buried</p><p>we have no protection</p><p>that&rsquo;s a bunch of cowboys bro making decisions and</p><p>trust me they&rsquo;re too</p><p>stupid to even know what a conspiracy theory is</p><p>the people that</p><p>built it maybe but if the government was really</p><p>truly behind it like all these people think</p><p>what it is is that they</p><p>made an airport there</p><p>but in constructing the airport they also</p><p>built some sort of underground safeguard</p><p>three more strongholds there so there&rsquo;s</p><p>gotta be some kinky shit yeah</p><p>well you know if it&rsquo;s</p><p>close i mean that</p><p>would be a move right</p><p>build an airport and then</p><p>build some shelters i mean that airport is like fucking</p><p>kansas when you go out to kansas</p><p>they were a dick out there that&rsquo;s what they call it the</p><p>it was easy man when i lived in denver or in boulder</p><p>it was easy to drive there how small</p><p>was the drive fucking hour nothing</p><p>never any traffic</p><p>be 25 minutes</p><p>here&rsquo;s the deal though bro</p><p>there&rsquo;s no traffic out that don&rsquo;t matter used to be</p><p>twenty five minutes with no traffic</p><p>on some fucking tunes crack the window a little bit</p><p>they built this</p><p>monster to spend money yeah they</p><p>built this monster this monster to to to just</p><p>you know like when i went to fucking newark to see the</p><p>fights with you</p><p>they we did knew it they</p><p>built the soccer stadium</p><p>right fucking soccer stadium and newer</p><p>they&rsquo;re spending</p><p>money left and</p><p>right but they</p><p>still can&rsquo;t put a left hand turning signal</p><p>so if you got to make a left</p><p>29 fucking miles of people got</p><p>well they&rsquo;re trying to keep up</p><p>their reputation as the car jack capital of the</p><p>world and if you got like some left</p><p>turn signals you got some outlets people can escape</p><p>can escape the</p><p>drama fucking</p><p>amazing that&rsquo;s the thing</p><p>about that it&rsquo;s like</p><p>you know they</p><p>think that&rsquo;s</p><p>there&rsquo;s something really</p><p>going on inside that denver airport there&rsquo;s all</p><p>these documentaries</p><p>dedicated to it</p><p>and one of the reasons for it is because</p><p>there&rsquo;s these</p><p>crazy murals that they&rsquo;re</p><p>painted up in the denver airport</p><p>and they&rsquo;re really disturbing man</p><p>they&rsquo;re apocalyptic</p><p>like one guy&rsquo;s got a fucking gas mask on</p><p>with a giant</p><p>sword and there&rsquo;s like</p><p>pictures of children and coffins and there&rsquo;s</p><p>in the background have you ever seen that shit yeah but</p><p>yeah we&rsquo;ve actually talked</p><p>about it on this podcast before we did yeah</p><p>but do you think that has anything to do with</p><p>with that and</p><p>you putting the two</p><p>together i don&rsquo;t</p><p>think that it does</p><p>definitely but</p><p>it&rsquo;s interesting</p><p>you know i mean i&rsquo;ll have opinion</p><p>one way or another i&rsquo;ve listened to the people talk</p><p>about how it&rsquo;s a some great</p><p>escape base and that</p><p>2012 is gonna be</p><p>you know fucking</p><p>asteroids gonna hit that they&rsquo;re</p><p>tracking it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna kill everybody</p><p>except the

you</p><p>gotta do is go down the hill and she get the</p><p>party started</p><p>where you put it before</p><p>motherfucker that&rsquo;s a witness relocation plan</p><p>she had to drive 90</p><p>miles before she even seen a denny&rsquo;s dog</p><p>there was another 20</p><p>miles she was from all the</p><p>way up in boulder</p><p>the first mall that she cares</p><p>about is cherry fucking

healthy</p><p>i think there&rsquo;s something</p><p>exciting about living in a big city</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re</p><p>you know you&rsquo;re involved in the hustle and bustle</p><p>and you&rsquo;re really trying to make something happen and</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s</p><p>i don&rsquo;t know i can&rsquo;t</p><p>believe that</p><p>if you got divorced</p><p>you probably

way to get a fucking car for her</p><p>to the mall</p><p>where he actually i</p><p>could do that don&rsquo;t</p><p>worry about</p><p>that you gotta move a little closer</p><p>that was too</p><p>yeah a little</p><p>close and you just need to move to</p><p>texas texas is</p><p>cool this is the answer too i like austin</p><p>i&rsquo;m a big fan of that austin</p><p>texas i&rsquo;ll tell you that

nothing</p><p>all i remember is</p><p>crossing the fucking</p><p>street on eighty</p><p>ninth and broadway up to ps one c six</p><p>sixty six and</p><p>thinking to myself finally i&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna

answer</p><p>right there</p><p>but even at that</p><p>age i knew my</p><p>mother was fucking crazy so</p><p>i knew i was in a full fledged american</p><p>but looking at that flag</p><p>when you look at that flag and you just come here</p><p>they have a</p><p>scene in the</p><p>beginning of scarface when they&rsquo;re on the boat</p><p>and they finally</p><p>see land and they show the american flag</p><p>and the director</p><p>whoever the guy is brilliant enough to show</p><p>he showed it from a different</p><p>angle what that flag looks like it&rsquo;s not just</p><p>we overlooked that flag</p><p>every fucking day</p><p>we overlooked that flag</p><p>you don&rsquo;t know what it is to look at that flag when you</p><p>first come here</p><p>and to know that that&rsquo;s your fucking that&rsquo;s your</p><p>magic carpet</p><p>it&rsquo;s the highest</p><p>ideal in the</p><p>world it&rsquo;s the highest</p><p>ideal that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s</p><p>so infuriating when politicians are fucking corrupt</p><p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so you know people say</p><p>you know why do you criticize</p><p>what america does overseas don&rsquo;t you love america</p><p>yeah if you love it you want to tell the fucking</p><p>truth about what it&rsquo;s doing</p><p>you know if you love it you&rsquo;re supposed to</p><p>stand up and go what the fuck is</p><p>going on it&rsquo;s like</p><p>you don&rsquo;t love it by letting it get away with</p><p>stupid shit</p><p>because there&rsquo;s some corrupt</p><p>cons at the wheel</p><p>that&rsquo;s not it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t love the idea</p><p>of america i fucking love the idea of america for sure</p><p>always remember we only see the one side of that flag</p><p>we never see both sides together gentlemen</p><p>and that&rsquo;s the point we</p><p>only see that one side of the flag</p><p>right now you&rsquo;ve discussed that the cia is setting up</p><p>things in libya</p><p>what are they setting up they&rsquo;re</p><p>starting a war they&rsquo;re</p><p>starting business yeah</p><p>they&rsquo;re getting</p><p>things going</p><p>that&rsquo;s the other side of that flag that we&rsquo;re</p><p>never able to see we</p><p>only see one</p><p>side he put a</p><p>mirror on the</p><p>other side of the flag you know</p><p>i&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s the one side of the flag that we have</p><p>since we accept this side of the flag</p><p>we gotta accept that side</p><p>yeah the only way that side</p><p>this side is possible</p><p>where it&rsquo;s easy to</p><p>drive around</p><p>is if they&rsquo;re doing all this creepy shit you</p><p>gotta bring</p><p>unless we bring the</p><p>whole world together in on everything</p><p>and that&rsquo;s just not</p><p>gonna happen and we&rsquo;ve done creepy</p><p>fucking shit as a</p><p>man they&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna do creepy shit too and we</p><p>can&rsquo;t trust them</p><p>you know you can&rsquo;t</p><p>trust people to be cool</p><p>you know look the</p><p>natural instinct if someone can get into a position of</p><p>power is to be qaddafi</p><p>that&rsquo;s the natural instinct</p><p>the natural instinct is to get botox when you&rsquo;re eighty</p><p>have this big</p><p>stupid looking rubber face</p><p>wear goofy clothes</p><p>and just be running shit</p><p>even though you&rsquo;re this old cunt</p><p>you

it&rsquo;s</p><p>true or not that&rsquo;s the side we&rsquo;re not supposed to see</p><p>we&rsquo;re supposed to be</p><p>focused on the other side</p><p>on what that machine is supposed to mean to us

momos and</p><p>the fucking</p><p>money came in the fake fucking</p><p>money and what the hillbillies out</p><p>the real motherfuckers that you needed</p><p>in case you gotta go like Woody</p><p>Creek to find those people like you gotta go</p><p>woody Creek is that still fucking amateurs to really</p><p>bunch of fucking boozes up there you really</p><p>you got to go deep</p><p>deep in the mountains of Gunnison and shit like that</p><p>find those crazy</p><p>gunderson gunnison</p><p>Brian you got your volume on</p><p>we&rsquo;re echoing</p><p>gunnison gunderson gunnison</p><p>where&rsquo;s that</p><p>that&rsquo;s down south</p><p>what do you think</p><p>about all that shit</p><p>about the Denver airport do you know anything</p><p>about the conspiracy</p><p>behind the Denver airport what is it no</p><p>the Denver airport</p><p>first of all they</p><p>moved way more dirt than they needed to</p><p>and so there&rsquo;s this</p><p>all this thought that there&rsquo;s some sort of subterranean</p><p>tunnel system</p><p>it&rsquo;s all based on the end of the</p><p>world shelters</p><p>they fucked</p><p>up staple to the airport was a brilliant airport</p><p>it was like</p><p>Burbank you could</p><p>smuggle a fucking dead fucking</p><p>kilo coke in</p><p>there nobody said nothing</p><p>and all of a</p><p>sudden they came up with a bright idea</p><p>let&rsquo;s fucking make an airport</p><p>90 miles farther out by Kansas</p><p>so when it snows we really get fucking buried</p><p>we have no protection</p><p>that&rsquo;s a bunch of cowboys bro making decisions and</p><p>trust me they&rsquo;re too</p><p>stupid to even know what a conspiracy theory is well</p><p>the people that built it</p><p>maybe but if the government was really</p><p>truly behind it like all</p><p>these people think</p><p>what it is is that they</p><p>made an airport there</p><p>but in constructing the airport they also</p><p>built some sort of</p><p>underground safeguard</p><p>stronghold there</p><p>so there&rsquo;s got to be some kinky yeah</p><p>well you know if it&rsquo;s</p><p>close I mean that</p><p>would be a move right no</p><p>resin airport and then</p><p>build some shelters I mean that airport is bike</p><p>fucking Kansas when you</p><p>watch Kansas</p><p>there ain&rsquo;t</p><p>dick out there that&rsquo;s what they call it the airport</p><p>it was easy man when I</p><p>lived in Denver or in Boulder</p><p>it was easy to</p><p>drive there how</p><p>often to drive fucking hour nothing</p><p>never any traffic</p><p>be 25 minutes</p><p>here&rsquo;s the deal though bro</p><p>there&rsquo;s no traffic out that don&rsquo;t matter used to be</p><p>25 minutes with no traffic</p><p>on some fucking tunes</p><p>crack the window a little bit</p><p>they built this</p><p>monster to spend</p><p>money yeah they</p><p>built this monster</p><p>this monster to</p><p>to just you</p><p>know like when I went to fucking Newark to see the</p><p>fights with you</p><p>they we did Newark they</p><p>built the soccer stadium</p><p>right fucking soccer stadium and newer</p><p>they&rsquo;re spending</p><p>money left and</p><p>right but they</p><p>still can&rsquo;t put a left hand turning signal</p><p>so if you got to make a left</p><p>29 fucking miles of people got</p><p>well they&rsquo;re trying to keep up</p><p>their reputation as the car Jack capital of the</p><p>world and if you</p><p>got like some left turn signals you got some outlook</p><p>people can escape</p><p>can escape the</p><p>drama fucking</p><p>amazing that&rsquo;s the</p><p>thing about that it&rsquo;s like</p><p>you know they</p><p>think that&rsquo;s</p><p>there&rsquo;s something really</p><p>going on inside that Denver airport there&rsquo;s all</p><p>these documentaries</p><p>dedicated to it</p><p>and one of the reasons for it is because</p><p>there&rsquo;s these</p><p>crazy murals that they&rsquo;re</p><p>painted up in the Denver airport</p><p>and they&rsquo;re really disturbing man</p><p>they&rsquo;re apocalyptic</p><p>like one guy&rsquo;s got a fucking gas mask on</p><p>with a giant</p><p>sword and there&rsquo;s like</p><p>pictures of children and coffins and there&rsquo;s</p><p>in the background have you ever seen that shit yeah but</p><p>yeah we&rsquo;ve actually talked</p><p>about it on this podcast before we</p><p>did yeah but do you</p><p>think that has anything to do with</p><p>with that and they</p><p>keep putting the 2</p><p>together I don&rsquo;t</p><p>think that it does</p><p>definitely but</p><p>it&rsquo;s interesting</p><p>you know I mean I&rsquo;ll have opinion</p><p>one way or another I&rsquo;ve listened to the people talk</p><p>about how it&rsquo;s some great</p><p>escape base and then</p><p>2012 there&rsquo;s gonna be</p><p>you know fucking</p><p>asteroids gonna hit that they&rsquo;re</p><p>tracking it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna kill everybody</p><p>except the people that are in this</p><p>underground bunker</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know man</p><p>I watch the TV show on</p><p>those dudes</p><p>those dudes that have</p><p>they&rsquo;ve bought like</p><p>fucking condos</p><p>out in

compound</p><p>wheel at 2 000 acres or something like that</p><p>and it was all fenced in</p><p>and he had all</p><p>these animals</p><p>living inside his compound and he</p><p>would just go and Jack

I</p><p>love you to</p><p>death I love you to death</p><p>here&rsquo;s the problem Joe roland&rsquo;s got</p><p>Joe rogan&rsquo;s got a great wife</p><p>and Joe Rogan I went to his home last week</p><p>and that was one of the</p><p>first times that Mrs Rogan was home a couple times</p><p>so I&rsquo;ve been up there</p><p>like 4 times Mrs Rogan likes to rock the house Mrs</p><p>Roland don&rsquo;t like to sit at home</p><p>and the problem is all</p><p>up where you live now all you</p><p>gotta do is go down the hill and she get the</p><p>party started</p><p>where you put it before</p><p>motherfucker that&rsquo;s a witness</p><p>relocation plan</p><p>she had to drive 90</p><p>miles before she even seen a denny&rsquo;s dog</p><p>it was another 20</p><p>miles she was from

there&rsquo;s</p><p>a more relaxed vibe and I</p><p>think that shit is healthy</p><p>think there&rsquo;s something</p><p>exciting about living in a big city</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re</p><p>you know you&rsquo;re involved in the hustle and bustle</p><p>and you&rsquo;re really trying to make something happen and</p><p>you know I don&rsquo;t know I can&rsquo;t</p><p>believe that</p><p>if you

God</p><p>why am I so fucking</p><p>stupid you&rsquo;re so smart</p><p>no they&rsquo;re not like that</p><p>they&rsquo;re just themselves</p><p>you know what I mean</p><p>it&rsquo;s like that must be a strange strange existence</p><p>where you know that&rsquo;s part of being dumb</p><p>is that you&rsquo;re</p><p>too dumb to realize you&rsquo;re dumb you know and if you</p><p>I&rsquo;m not saying dumb like</p><p>they&rsquo;re lazy like they have an</p><p>issue there&rsquo;s a mental issues</p><p>a mental imbalance</p><p>whatever the fuck it is but I mean</p><p>they&rsquo;re impaired</p><p>but they&rsquo;re</p><p>so impaired they don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re impaired</p><p>like they&rsquo;ve</p><p>lost the ability to see that they&rsquo;re impaired</p><p>you know what&rsquo;s a

from</p><p>Tater Tots well</p><p>there&rsquo;s probably</p><p>now though there&rsquo;s probably a lot of that yeah I</p><p>think there&rsquo;s a</p><p>bunch of different</p><p>types of you</p><p>know being fucked up</p><p>right you know for sure there&rsquo;s that too</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not just simple as you know</p><p>there&rsquo;s some of there&rsquo;s varying degrees</p><p>yeah there&rsquo;s varying degrees</p><p>along the way that are you know means fucking</p><p>crazy thing man</p><p>to have your mind impaired you know and like</p><p>look our minds are impaired in</p><p>comparison I was</p><p>watching this fucking</p><p>12 year old kid</p><p>his autistic kid with a hundred and</p><p>70 IQ doing</p><p>his take on the theory of relativity</p><p>and

what&rsquo;s</p><p>going on up there</p><p>it&rsquo;s chaos to me</p><p>but to him it&rsquo;s so</p><p>clear it&rsquo;s a language it&rsquo;s like well</p><p>quite simply you have to move this and this becomes X</p><p>equals Y equals to</p><p>we are the retards</p><p>to that kid</p><p>hmm you know maybe like</p><p>maybe like you know people with Down</p><p>syndrome they feel bad with people

Italy</p><p>now here I am in the land of the free the home of the</p><p>brave you know I&rsquo;m in America and I&rsquo;m in</p><p>school and I&rsquo;m</p><p>learning English</p><p>and I&rsquo;m just</p><p>gonna go fucking</p><p>crazy over here</p><p>they&rsquo;re just so</p><p>happy and Joe Rogan that&rsquo;s the 1/2 of it</p><p>because I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>leave Cuba crying when we</p><p>moved I woke up on 89th</p><p>Street and Riverside Drive</p><p>I had all the fucking</p><p>things that a rich kid</p><p>would have right</p><p>and here I was walking</p><p>around this fucking city but I didn&rsquo;t know English</p><p>and all you</p><p>wanna do in your</p><p>heart is just fit in</p><p>and you have no idea this is not</p><p>trying to fit in when you&rsquo;re in grammar</p><p>school and you</p><p>should get a</p><p>tattoo or long hair</p><p>all you wanna know is</p><p>for them not to know that you came from somewhere else</p><p>I can&rsquo;t describe it to you I can&rsquo;t even fucking</p><p>start to tell you</p><p>like sometimes I have this</p><p>anger at me and it&rsquo;s</p><p>cause I I we</p><p>were so lucky</p><p>we were so lucky any 3 of us</p><p>could have been born one of</p><p>those black kids and fucking Haiti with</p><p>flies on you yeah any 3 of us</p><p>and we have so many fucking opportunities</p><p>and sometimes I wake up in the</p><p>morning this really hits me sometimes I go how fucking</p><p>lucky am I that my</p><p>mother came here</p><p>and here I am sitting here smoking dope</p><p>I gotta go mug somebody</p><p>you know I&rsquo;m saying like</p><p>think about that&rsquo;s what an immigrant was like</p><p>you know I&rsquo;m</p><p>telling you for a long time I&rsquo;ve been writing this</p><p>thing and that&rsquo;s how it</p><p>starts with it</p><p>you know I don&rsquo;t remember anything I don&rsquo;t remember the</p><p>plane right from Cube I remember nothing</p><p>all I remember is</p><p>crossing the fucking street</p><p>on 89th and</p><p>Broadway up to PS One C 6 66</p><p>and thinking to myself finally I&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna be a fucking American</p><p>what does that mean</p><p>looking at that flag</p><p>really believe in something dog</p><p>it&rsquo;s not just a</p><p>piece of fucking rag</p><p>looking at that flag and going</p><p>What the fuck</p><p>like looking at the wind blowing that flag and going</p><p>What the fuck</p><p>that flag is</p><p>the answer to all my fucking problem that&rsquo;s the answer</p><p>right there</p><p>but even at that</p><p>age I knew my</p><p>mother was fucking crazy so</p><p>I knew I was</p><p>in the full fledged American but looking at that flag</p><p>when you look at that flag and you just come here</p><p>they have a</p><p>scene in the</p><p>beginning of Scarface when they&rsquo;re on the boat</p><p>and they finally</p><p>see land and they show the American flag</p><p>and the director</p><p>whoever the guy is brilliant enough to show</p><p>he showed it from a different</p><p>angle what that flag looks like it&rsquo;s not just</p><p>we overlooked that flag</p><p>every fucking day</p><p>we overlooked that flag</p><p>you don&rsquo;t know what it is to look at that flag when you</p><p>first come here</p><p>and to know that that&rsquo;s your fucking that&rsquo;s your</p><p>magic carpet</p><p>it&rsquo;s the highest</p><p>ideal in the</p><p>world it&rsquo;s the highest</p><p>ideal that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s</p><p>so infuriating when politicians are fucking corrupt</p><p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so you know people say</p><p>you know why do you criticize</p><p>what America does overseas don&rsquo;t you love America</p><p>yeah if you love it you want to tell the fucking</p><p>truth about what it&rsquo;s doing</p><p>you know if you love it you&rsquo;re supposed to</p><p>stand up and go what the fuck is</p><p>going on it&rsquo;s like</p><p>you don&rsquo;t love it by letting it get away with</p><p>stupid shit</p><p>because there&rsquo;s some corrupt</p><p>content the</p><p>wheel that&rsquo;s not</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t love the idea</p><p>of America I fucking love the idea of America for sure</p><p>always remember we only see the one side of that flag</p><p>we never see both sides together gentlemen</p><p>and that&rsquo;s the point we</p><p>only see that one side of the flag</p><p>right now you discuss that the CIA is setting up</p><p>things in Libya</p><p>when are they setting up they&rsquo;re</p><p>starting the war they&rsquo;re</p><p>starting business yeah</p><p>they&rsquo;re getting</p><p>things going</p><p>that&rsquo;s the other side of that flag that we&rsquo;re</p><p>never able to see we only</p><p>see once you</p><p>put a mirror on the</p><p>other side of the flag you know</p><p>I&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s the one side of the flag that we have</p><p>since we accept this side of the flag</p><p>we gotta accept that side</p><p>yeah the only way that side</p><p>this side is possible</p><p>where it&rsquo;s easy to</p><p>drive around</p><p>is if they&rsquo;re doing all this creepy shit you</p><p>gotta bring</p><p>unless we bring the whole</p><p>world together in on everything</p><p>and that&rsquo;s just not</p><p>gonna happen and we&rsquo;ve done creepy fucking shit</p><p>and they&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna do creepy shit too and</p><p>we can&rsquo;t trust them</p><p>you know you can&rsquo;t</p><p>trust people to be cool</p><p>you know look the</p><p>natural instinct if someone can get into a position of</p><p>power is to be qaddafi</p><p>that&rsquo;s the natural instinct</p><p>the natural instinct is to get Botox when you&rsquo;re 80</p><p>have this big</p><p>stupid looking rubber face</p><p>wear goofy clothes</p><p>and just be running shit</p><p>even though you&rsquo;re this old cunt</p><p>living in some fucking castle with billions of</p><p>dollars why is</p><p>he doing that job can you tell me why is he doing that</p><p>maybe we put that billions of</p><p>dollars for</p><p>money that side</p><p>that flag is</p><p>money Joe Rogan</p><p>that&rsquo;s a lot of people</p><p>never had comprehend that</p><p>that&rsquo;s the reality of it</p><p>stand up is a beautiful</p><p>thing to do</p><p>yeah some guys are brilliant</p><p>some guys aren&rsquo;t doing the millionaires the</p><p>other 4 between the crack</p><p>the other side the</p><p>stand up it&rsquo;s a business</p><p>yeah it really is</p><p>a fucking business guys and it&rsquo;s like anything else the</p><p>other side of that flag</p><p>is a business guys</p><p>and the same way we want Social Security when we&rsquo;re 65</p><p>our country has to do sell a couple kilos</p><p>every once in a while</p><p>to replenish</p><p>those fucking funds you know what I&rsquo;m saying</p><p>and that&rsquo;s a side the American public don&rsquo;t wanna know</p><p>that&rsquo;s the side that included Kennedy</p><p>that&rsquo;s the side that Alex</p><p>Jones talks about</p><p>whether it&rsquo;s</p><p>true or not that&rsquo;s the side we&rsquo;re not supposed to see</p><p>we&rsquo;re supposed to be</p><p>focused on the other side</p><p>on what that machine is supposed to mean to us and</p><p>for guys like</p><p>you and I I like looking behind the curtain but I don&rsquo;t</p><p>I don&rsquo;t because I grew up in a corrupt</p><p>hometown I seen what politics is</p><p>out of my new</p><p>level I can&rsquo;t even</p><p>dream of what it is in a national fucking level when</p><p>I&rsquo;m taking political contributions but I&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna pass your fucking Bill so you could</p><p>pass that law that&rsquo;ll</p><p>make people&rsquo;s hands grow back</p><p>but they&rsquo;re also</p><p>gonna give him cancer in the eyeballs</p><p>that&rsquo;s part of it</p><p>it grows when</p><p>I grew up in it when it was in the</p><p>micro process</p><p>now it&rsquo;s in</p><p>the national</p><p>level of corruption is in a</p><p>macro process</p><p>and it starts with little</p><p>things and townships</p><p>where is a macro</p><p>smaller than my yeah</p><p>micro macro I&rsquo;m a little high I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>guys but you</p><p>understand Mike I know exactly what you&rsquo;re saying yeah</p><p>it&rsquo;s very interesting</p><p>corruption if not</p><p>checked grows it all just keeps getting</p><p>bigger it&rsquo;s not like they go hey we got to cut the shit</p><p>I know we&rsquo;ve been making millions of dollars on the</p><p>sneak tip but everybody&rsquo;s gotta

general</p><p>that&rsquo;s why these assholes</p><p>wanna put that guy in jail they</p><p>wanna say it compromises Americans</p><p>no it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>he did exactly what the New York</p><p>Times was supposed to do if they got that information</p><p>we should have</p><p>done that on twitter</p><p>though can you imagine if there was just like this</p><p>twitter address that everyone followed that everyone</p><p>well they have</p><p>no tweet twitter</p><p>by the way JFK here&rsquo;s</p><p>pictures of JK</p><p>SO and cocaine too</p><p>dude wikileaks has a twitter and they

are</p><p>influenced by</p><p>genetically modified foods and how we are trying to</p><p>force them on</p><p>other countries</p><p>and we&rsquo;re fucking with</p><p>other countries if they</p><p>don&rsquo;t go into the genetically modified food they don&rsquo;t</p><p>start growing like Monsanto corn and shit like that</p><p>these giant companies</p><p>are way too embedded into the political system</p><p>they&rsquo;re not doing</p><p>stuff for the</p><p>greater good of people they&rsquo;re doing</p><p>stuff for the profitability</p><p>of giant corporations that</p><p>moved them into position in the</p><p>first place</p><p>the whole thing has been corrupted</p><p>like to sit down and pretend</p><p>that it&rsquo;s real is insulting</p><p>it&rsquo;s like a</p><p>stupid argument</p><p>it&rsquo;s like people</p><p>argue about pro wrestling</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s like what are you arguing</p><p>about this is a fake nonsense process</p><p>if you

when i went home last week yeah</p><p>i was a kid i seen to do some wild shit what you do</p><p>when i was about</p><p>when i was about eight</p><p>you know my</p><p>mother had a bar and all</p><p>these people coming to</p><p>shake it down you know cops are coming nice guys</p><p>just white guys</p><p>come in that&rsquo;s part of the business when you have a bar</p><p>you know somebody gets</p><p>stabbed you want the cops there first</p><p>you got to give an envelope</p><p>you know and then</p><p>after about</p><p>three months this guy</p><p>started coming he was a cuban guy look like serpico</p><p>but he would come in and</p><p>break the cubans balls</p><p>he went after cubans</p><p>he went after cubans and</p><p>seventy six and</p><p>seventy five he went</p><p>after

first</p><p>then eventually the</p><p>guy just slowly wears you down slowly wears you down</p><p>and then boom stops you in the</p><p>twelfth with like</p><p>seconds to go</p><p>they stop the fight</p><p>like that&rsquo;s a</p><p>crushing blow</p><p>a devastating blow</p><p>you know to have the referee</p><p>look at you when there&rsquo;s like</p><p>was there like two</p><p>seconds left in the clock</p><p>and the referee</p><p>shakes him off and chavez</p><p>wins like what what</p><p>that&rsquo;s like a</p><p>spirit crusher</p><p>we&rsquo;re talking</p><p>about the fucking</p><p>spirit

are</p><p>so the person</p><p>i was with i own the dog they were like my dog has</p><p>never a humped anything and b</p><p>my dog is a girl dog so i don&rsquo;t even know why</p><p>it&rsquo;s like trying to hump your dog&rsquo;s ass because it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t have a dick</p><p>so joey what what do you</p><p>think about rss feeds</p><p>i have no idea what they even fucking up</p><p>here to pick</p><p>up the line</p><p>you don&rsquo;t know anything about computers yeah</p><p>what they&rsquo;re designed to</p><p>pump out a like if you have a website</p><p>it&rsquo;s designed only</p><p>for we&rsquo;re mostly for</p><p>sending out your website so</p><p>other applications and other websites can</p><p>add it to their website</p><p>and their applications</p><p>but if you don&rsquo;t</p><p>want to do that you don&rsquo;t have an rss feed</p><p>so i could see you wouldn&rsquo;t want an rss feed</p><p>i know nothing</p><p>about it talk to me about something i fucking need you</p><p>can play like</p><p>oh is that real that&rsquo;s real bitch</p><p>see now that&rsquo;s why you agitate you don&rsquo;t talk</p><p>look at your</p><p>boys walking right into the fucking fucking</p><p>i had to pee i&rsquo;m sorry ladies and gentlemen i apologize</p><p>i was working on that video game all day today</p><p>smells like gyros i kidding</p><p>i was working on that</p><p>ufc video game</p><p>today and i drink tea when i work on that show</p><p>the video game is like it&rsquo;s very</p><p>it&rsquo;s like a script and</p><p>i have to pretend that fights are going on</p><p>so it&rsquo;s like for hours and hours and</p><p>hours you&rsquo;re talking at that like really intense</p><p>fast and you know</p><p>your voice gets really tired so</p><p>i had to drink a lot of tea</p><p>so i could not hold in my urine so</p><p>what you were saying</p><p>before i left so rudely is that your dog&rsquo;s a whore</p><p>such a whore that</p><p>lesbians are raping your dog no</p><p>yeah exactly and like</p><p>do all dogs</p><p>have just the intuition</p><p>to get on top of another dog and hump it</p><p>even if they don&rsquo;t have a dick because it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p><p>sense no it</p><p>does my dog used to do that she was a female pit bull</p><p>and i had a male pit bull that was a puppy</p><p>and she used to get on</p><p>top of them and hump them just like rubbing pussies and</p><p>no no it&rsquo;s a dominant</p><p>thing it&rsquo;s like what she&rsquo;s doing</p><p>is saying that if i wanted to fuck you in the ass i</p><p>could i can get to the position</p><p>where i&rsquo;m on top of you</p><p>i&rsquo;m stronger than you</p><p>they jockey</p><p>for position</p><p>you have to almost like</p><p>it&rsquo;s a social thing</p><p>it&rsquo;s like for</p><p>a dog to be able to get on top of you and dry hump you</p><p>it&rsquo;s not just that he&rsquo;s</p><p>horny it&rsquo;s also</p><p>that he&rsquo;s trying to let you know he can do that</p><p>he can impose himself on you</p><p>like my two dogs they have very</p><p>clear rules</p><p>like johnny&rsquo;s a mastiff he&rsquo;s a big fucking dog</p><p>and you know he&rsquo;s got this</p><p>giant fucking head and he&rsquo;s a</p><p>sweet heart of a dog</p><p>but the other dogs a bulldog shibu</p><p>inu bix and the</p><p>other dog doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>get no saying shit that&rsquo;s just the way it is they don&rsquo;t</p><p>fight they don&rsquo;t argue</p><p>but when i open up the door</p><p>johnny walks in</p><p>first every time</p><p>every time the</p><p>other dog will stop and let johnny go through first why</p><p>cause johnny&rsquo;s a hundred and forty</p><p>pound mastiff he&rsquo;s fucking huge</p><p>you know so there&rsquo;s just</p><p>clear rules</p><p>if johnny wanted to hump brutus</p><p>he could get away with it</p><p>but if brutus</p><p>tried to hump johnny they</p><p>would be chaos</p><p>it would be like what the fuck</p><p>brutus probably</p><p>would growl</p><p>and snap a johnny if johnny</p><p>tried to hump them but the</p><p>point is the</p><p>other way is</p><p>absolutely preposterous it&rsquo;s</p><p>never gonna happen there&rsquo;s like a this is</p><p>with animals there&rsquo;s an alpha</p><p>and then there&rsquo;s the the ones who give into the alpha</p><p>and your dog</p><p>clearly is like the most beta dog ever</p><p>i know it&rsquo;s</p><p>so much on me dog say</p><p>that we give it</p><p>is that what it is</p><p>so i guess the way it works is that they just</p><p>feel her submissiveness</p><p>and they want to</p><p>mount her their instinct is to</p><p>mount her and dominate her</p><p>this the old</p><p>dog i used to have was always a bad dog and</p><p>every time it was bad i would</p><p>just like kind of put her in between my legs</p><p>and my arm and kind of get in like a crouching position</p><p>and kind of just like</p><p>put her in between me and like hold her</p><p>and so i was</p><p>kind of like on top of her i wasn&rsquo;t like fucking her</p><p>right you know she was just like on like</p><p>underneath my</p><p>belly like a little cave</p><p>i would make</p><p>i would just sit there for like ten minutes</p><p>and you could tell the dog at</p><p>first trying to get out</p><p>and then finally just kind of some</p><p>submissors are</p><p>you know just kind of lays down</p><p>and it gives up</p><p>dog is just fine</p><p>you know just walks around</p><p>weird i don&rsquo;t</p><p>think you&rsquo;re supposed to do that i</p><p>think you fucked up your dog&rsquo;s head you like</p><p>rape your dog</p><p>every time it shit on the carpet</p><p>every time it shits</p><p>on the carpet you rape it well no no it&rsquo;s something i</p><p>learned kind of from caesar</p><p>oh really like is that what caesar does he fucks yeah</p><p>after showtime that&rsquo;s</p><p>after night&rsquo;s showtime version of it no</p><p>that&rsquo;s his secret</p><p>that probably</p><p>would be the best way to do it yeah</p><p>well he didn&rsquo;t say it like that he said that you</p><p>should grab it</p><p>by the back of the neck and like hold it down</p><p>for a while</p><p>that&rsquo;s pretty much</p><p>what i was doing i was pretty much getting on top of it</p><p>and just kind of</p><p>getting like yo</p><p>i am the master here</p><p>the whole dog</p><p>thing is crazy man</p><p>do you have</p><p>these animals that listen to you</p><p>right now like what the fuck or what&rsquo;s</p><p>wrong with us</p><p>there&rsquo;s not</p><p>another animal that keeps animals that they love</p><p>right you know</p><p>it&rsquo;s weird and we&rsquo;ve got them engineered to be like the</p><p>sweetest nicest</p><p>things ever</p><p>i mean look at your dog dude your dog is</p><p>ridiculously affectionate</p><p>right i&rsquo;ve never seen a dog that</p><p>not just affectionate</p><p>but so needy</p><p>to her it&rsquo;s like</p><p>every breath</p><p>but taking a breath</p><p>she needs that much</p><p>attention like it&rsquo;s like as much as she&rsquo;s breathing</p><p>she needs someone</p><p>touching her</p><p>as much as she needs to take in air</p><p>she needs someone to</p><p>touch her it&rsquo;s like that</p><p>extreme it&rsquo;s like a stripper or something way worse</p><p>way worse than</p><p>is there any animal that has pubic hair</p><p>i was thinking the</p><p>other day i was like</p><p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if like animals had</p><p>pubic hairs and</p><p>like you like trim them</p><p>or you could just get a full bush</p><p>you know like if your cat</p><p>well the animal</p><p>would have to have</p><p>nothing else around it i mean they have pubic hair over</p><p>their whole fucking body that&rsquo;s</p><p>basically what&rsquo;s</p><p>going on kind of</p><p>sure but i mean like even like bald</p><p>eagles if bald</p><p>eagles had bushes</p><p>those are feathers but i mean like why don&rsquo;t they have</p><p>what are you talking</p><p>about like bald</p><p>eagles have</p><p>penises right</p><p>yes why are</p><p>humans the only ones that have</p><p>pubic hairs</p><p>because we don&rsquo;t have hair on</p><p>the rest of our body there&rsquo;s very few animals that have</p><p>exposed skin</p><p>very few animals that have exposed skin</p><p>that ain&rsquo;t shit dude if</p><p>you were a coyote</p><p>i would take you to the vet</p><p>i believe this poor</p><p>thing is dying</p><p>because all its hair is missing what</p><p>you think is hairy is only hairy to a hairless person</p><p>you know i&rsquo;m</p><p>covered in hair too that&rsquo;s not</p><p>harry is that&rsquo;s your</p><p>hairless you just</p><p>you have a little hair compared to the</p><p>other hairless</p><p>folks why don&rsquo;t</p><p>monkeys have huge bushes</p><p>they do man</p><p>they do they have pubic hairs</p><p>they do they don&rsquo;t get long and</p><p>crazy like ours</p><p>because they just have different kind of hair</p><p>but they have hair around</p><p>their dick and balls</p><p>the fuck is</p><p>wrong with you son</p><p>you gotta do some research before you come up with</p><p>these crazy pubic hair theories</p><p>well i mean they</p><p>don&rsquo;t have bushes like we do that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m talking</p><p>about why do we</p><p>have them because</p><p>we don&rsquo;t have it anywhere else</p><p>joey if it like it would be</p><p>weird if like animals you know</p><p>i mean there&rsquo;s</p><p>only the only animal</p><p>that&rsquo;s like us that is hair and certain parts of his</p><p>body is like some</p><p>some dogs and i</p><p>i just wish all</p><p>enough experience in why</p><p>i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p><p>about animal pubic</p><p>is worried about people</p><p>dying of radiation poisoning in japan and</p><p>fucking why are we in libya the ca</p><p>involving our life</p><p>i&rsquo;m worried</p><p>about animals do</p><p>you think peta</p><p>would exist if animals have cares</p><p>ryan don&rsquo;t make me get bill</p><p>burr here fuck</p><p>you fuck you in the ass with his laptop</p><p>with fucking brock lesnar</p><p>right now bill

brock les</p><p>all right all right what&rsquo;s going on</p><p>bill burrow did a video</p><p>where he fucking</p><p>talked about the</p><p>thing that there&rsquo;s a video on youtube sony&rsquo;s made it</p><p>six minutes long</p><p>he talked about the argument on his own</p><p>for another six minutes</p><p>and at the end of it he goes yeah and i was right</p><p>that&rsquo;s the point that guy that little computer</p><p>guy he doesn&rsquo;t know about computers</p><p>and they&rsquo;re trying to rip you off and take the</p><p>money for the artist they never have</p><p>money for the artist</p><p>fucking rss feeds</p><p>you know what</p><p>you know what the thing that bugged me the most</p><p>six minutes this is the</p><p>experience you talked about this is the</p><p>thing that bugged me the most i&rsquo;ve met him like</p><p>four times five times before right</p><p>he even did</p><p>we did a comedy show the following night or that night</p><p>that night we did a comedy show and</p><p>he was the following night the following night</p><p>and i was like</p><p>the host of the show and i&rsquo;m like he knew that i&rsquo;m a</p><p>comic also he knows who i am</p><p>right and if he&rsquo;s nice</p><p>fucking whatever</p><p>so he on the beginning of the video he goes yeah and</p><p>so there&rsquo;s that guy that little</p><p>guy that whatever that the male assistant guy the guy</p><p>turns the not</p><p>fucking male assistant to something over there yeah</p><p>yeah this guy</p><p>whatever the fuck he is hey fucking give me a gyro</p><p>yeah come on</p><p>but but fuck in</p><p>the thing that bugs me the most is</p><p>and i i was pretty</p><p>baked when that argument happened but the</p><p>thing that bug me the most</p><p>about everything</p><p>was my whole</p><p>thing wasn&rsquo;t that i&rsquo;m like yeah what</p><p>stitchers doing is a hundred percent</p><p>legal know what</p><p>what i was saying is</p><p>if you have something on your website</p><p>that that you put on your website</p><p>right that is only put on your website if you</p><p>wanna broadcast your stuff</p><p>you don&rsquo;t want that then take it off your website it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t change anything</p><p>my whole argument is like</p><p>why do you have an rss feed on your website</p><p>why what what</p><p>what why did you put it on me are we really having</p><p>this conversation what are you doing no but i mean</p><p>so my art yeah but</p><p>but my argument</p><p>that i&rsquo;m just saying i know what your argument was you</p><p>brought it up</p><p>here we go again</p><p>but no no no</p><p>here we go i know</p><p>what his argument is i know what your arguments i&rsquo;m</p><p>aware of the the general details of the disagreement</p><p>i know but how is</p><p>what i&rsquo;m saying is that&rsquo;s not a</p><p>wrong or right</p><p>thing that&rsquo;s just</p><p>a question actually i don&rsquo;t care</p><p>anymore i don&rsquo;t</p><p>care anymore what&rsquo;s way more fascinating to me</p><p>is how involved you two got</p><p>that was way more fascinating and</p><p>when you&rsquo;re getting a actual</p><p>issue the actual issue</p><p>the actual issue</p><p>the actual issue was</p><p>minuscule compared</p><p>to how psychologically captivating it was</p><p>and how he was genuinely getting</p><p>upset and you were getting upset too</p><p>and i was trying to mediate</p><p>because i generally did see both sides</p><p>i genuinely did but what i couldn&rsquo;t</p><p>understand is how you guys are getting so goddamn</p><p>upset and then</p><p>when i would</p><p>bring it up</p><p>building oh this is a fucking new spa</p><p>joe rogan the joe rogan from 1994</p><p>would a fucking stab somebody by now</p><p>we didn&rsquo;t even know each</p><p>other back then man you&rsquo;re just</p><p>assuming you&rsquo;re</p><p>assuming i would have done that</p><p>well you know what it was just to me it was like</p><p>i&rsquo;ve already said the same</p><p>thing five times i can&rsquo;t say anything else</p><p>about that i</p><p>couldn&rsquo;t get you guys to stop it was fascinating</p><p>you like two dogs shut up</p><p>stop and there also</p><p>also comes to a</p><p>point where</p><p>you are like feel like you&rsquo;re talking to your mom doing</p><p>email that&rsquo;s how i get</p><p>about certain</p><p>things well you must have saw his</p><p>point a little bit</p><p>no i see what he&rsquo;s</p><p>saying but that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m saying i&rsquo;m not saying i</p><p>agree with him or disagree with him</p><p>on that he wasn&rsquo;t</p><p>willing to listen to what you were saying</p><p>about the whole concept of an rss</p><p>which stands for</p><p>really simple syndication</p><p>right and what&rsquo;s syndication mean you want to syndicate</p><p>yeah what&rsquo;s that mean</p><p>you want to</p><p>spread it out to as many people as possible absolutely</p><p>available on your website</p><p>absolutely but</p><p>the real problem was</p><p>the problem is itunes</p><p>numbers and that&rsquo;s what he really wants to say is that</p><p>stitcher was helping it hurting his itunes numbers</p><p>and probably that he</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t know</p><p>what an rss feed it why it&rsquo;s on his website</p><p>if he wants people to go to his website</p><p>take off your rss feed that&rsquo;s all you have to do</p><p>make don&rsquo;t make your rss feed public</p><p>just give it to itunes only</p><p>hide your rss feed</p><p>and then everyone will come to your website</p><p>and you&rsquo;ll have your itunes only well</p><p>we do one better than that we</p><p>allow people to download it not just on</p><p>stitcher but i</p><p>allow people to download it directly</p><p>so the moment it goes live i have a download link so</p><p>i don&rsquo;t want you have to wait</p><p>so my itunes numbers will be higher</p><p>to me all that matters is that you get it out there</p><p>you don&rsquo;t get cookies for being number</p><p>three or number four</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s cute it&rsquo;s nice to see the number</p><p>but what&rsquo;s important</p><p>to me is just that it gets distributed</p><p>to as many people as possible as easily as possible</p><p>some people don&rsquo;t like fucking with itunes</p><p>right some dudes who love the zoom</p><p>you know i heard the news is pretty badass i</p><p>think they stopped making them bro oh did they yeah</p><p>i lied out my ass turn it</p><p>i mean to some people that have just little</p><p>mp3 players</p><p>those little</p><p>flash mp3 players are like a little</p><p>you gotta have it available for</p><p>everything and anybody</p><p>yeah droids and</p><p>i especially when it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s a free</p><p>thing that you</p><p>just want to get out your podcast to people</p><p>you know you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re not doing like doug benson</p><p>when you&rsquo;re charging</p><p>money you&rsquo;re just trying to get your podcast</p><p>calling out doug</p><p>benson i can&rsquo;t believe you i mean</p><p>what the the honest</p><p>thing is the future of podcast how are podcasters</p><p>gonna make money</p><p>what doug is doing is pretty</p><p>interesting he&rsquo;s charging</p><p>money now for like certain shows</p><p>i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p><p>every show i</p><p>think it&rsquo;s like he has like certain shows marin</p><p>does that too yeah it&rsquo;s like</p><p>something where you become like some</p><p>super member or some shit</p><p>right i mean</p><p>i honestly think</p><p>the only way really to make</p><p>money is to get sponsors</p><p>you know yeah i</p><p>think the way you got to get a lot of</p><p>a lot of listeners</p><p>and get sponsors that&rsquo;s the way to do it</p><p>right i agree</p><p>i think because i</p><p>think we&rsquo;ve just reached</p><p>this time on the internet we have to look at the</p><p>music industry</p><p>we have to see look the</p><p>music industry has</p><p>changed it&rsquo;s not that people</p><p>started stealing</p><p>and taking shit from the</p><p>music industry</p><p>that happened and</p><p>there was no way to stop that</p><p>so the music</p><p>industry has to reorganize re figure out how they do it</p><p>and that&rsquo;s gonna happen with</p><p>everything and you can&rsquo;t fucking</p><p>stop it you just</p><p>gotta go with what you</p><p>think is going to happen</p><p>and that&rsquo;s like podcasting</p><p>no one knows what&rsquo;s happening with podcasting</p><p>but you have to pretty much go with what you can do</p><p>right now well we</p><p>also have the luxury</p><p>thing we also have the luxury of doing</p><p>other things</p><p>i have the luxury of not having to rely</p><p>completely on my podcast</p><p>the ufc and we&rsquo;re doing</p><p>stand up especially we&rsquo;re doing</p><p>stand up right</p><p>because the podcast</p><p>definitely enhances the</p><p>stand up insanely</p><p>and also just look at philly</p><p>i mean philly you just sold out all philly</p><p>right yeah it&rsquo;s sold out in two</p><p>weeks from now i mean how</p><p>when was the last time that happened so</p><p>it wasn&rsquo;t happening like that before it&rsquo;s like that</p><p>everywhere yeah</p><p>pulled seattle last weekend was fucking crazy man</p><p>eighteen hundred people</p><p>and when i asked him</p><p>i like how many guys listen the podcast it was like the</p><p>whole crowd it was</p><p>a hundred percent of the crowd</p><p>do you get that</p><p>now joey i get people yelling out do joe diaz mark</p><p>has changed</p><p>completely and with</p><p>music what&rsquo;s really</p><p>going on with</p><p>music is that</p><p>they had to give it away</p><p>so now you you make</p><p>money performing</p><p>but these bitches can&rsquo;t perform</p><p>yeah there&rsquo;s a lot of them

fourteen</p><p>have your thought</p><p>maybe because</p><p>you can&rsquo;t imagine because you don&rsquo;t remember it</p><p>no i can&rsquo;t imagine it not the</p><p>first all red man i&rsquo;m the real fucking the i remember i</p><p>know you&rsquo;re the real deal so so</p><p>i just like smoking weed the people i grew</p><p>the type of person i grew up with when i went to</p><p>colorado i was around a lot of heads</p><p>they like weed they</p><p>enjoy weed when i got home yesterday i said that</p><p>that thing was</p><p>thirty one percent i</p><p>tweeted it and ten people got back to me that said go</p><p>drive up in san</p><p>diego that&rsquo;s ahead</p><p>that&rsquo;s not a kid that says</p><p>oh my god i got the</p><p>what&rsquo;s the name that we play like express no</p><p>there&rsquo;s certain weed that&rsquo;s got a name that you just</p><p>smoke it to be cool</p><p>then there&rsquo;s this what&rsquo;s this</p><p>stuff again</p><p>called call matt</p><p>number one og</p><p>matt&rsquo;s number one</p><p>og look matt like some</p><p>famous growers no</p><p>no matt is the guy that owns kush mart so when he took</p><p>he bought that</p><p>brand and wanted to grow for him</p><p>and this is a hybrid</p><p>it&rsquo;s a hybrid</p><p>that he&rsquo;s got the</p><p>snoop dogg that&rsquo;s a 28</p><p>that&rsquo;s this</p><p>stuff might be the perfect weed</p><p>i might be the</p><p>greatest weed</p><p>ever i smoked it and i realized when i smoked it the</p><p>other day i&rsquo;ve been</p><p>going i know</p><p>cc and i&rsquo;ve been buying 50</p><p>fucking eights</p><p>and i realized that the pot was good</p><p>and some days when i buy</p><p>gram like by six o&rsquo;clock half the</p><p>gram was gone</p><p>i&rsquo;m smoking too much bottle in a bomb that&rsquo;s too much</p><p>when i hit weed and i remember that how i</p><p>started this diet</p><p>was it matt&rsquo;s og</p><p>when you smoked in the morning the sativa</p><p>would take over your mind so quickly</p><p>that i have to get out of the</p><p>house before my head blew up</p><p>and i would have to get on the bike and i</p><p>would just get on the bike and</p><p>pedal because i put somebody chasing me</p><p>and that&rsquo;s how i lost a hundred fucking</p><p>pounds on that bike smoking the max og</p><p>because it&rsquo;s a</p><p>teva wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>speed you up by cocaine</p><p>it speed you up at a grad</p><p>control you</p><p>and it went from being a sativa into</p><p>methodically like an indica</p><p>was the weirdest</p><p>thing people don&rsquo;t</p><p>understand the</p><p>sativa actually makes you ambitious people think that</p><p>it&rsquo;s people who look at</p><p>pot and look at people being</p><p>you know potheads being like unambitious and lazy</p><p>sativa makes me way more ambitious it makes me</p><p>aware of the consequences of not</p><p>working as hard as you can</p><p>and how you feel</p><p>you know it makes me</p><p>super sensitive</p><p>to my own actions positive or negative so it makes me</p><p>super sensitive to doing</p><p>things that i</p><p>should be doing</p><p>as far as like getting work done as far as like</p><p>writing and performing</p><p>and doing podcasts and</p><p>i don&rsquo;t ever cancel podcast man you know</p><p>i&rsquo;d have to be sick as fuck and i don&rsquo;t get sick very</p><p>often so we do them you know it&rsquo;s like</p><p>sativa makes me</p><p>know hyper aware</p><p>and when i&rsquo;m</p><p>hyper aware i&rsquo;m</p><p>more diligent</p><p>you know so i</p><p>think it makes me more ambitious</p><p>but do you guys</p><p>think if you had if you wanted to take a</p><p>month off do you think you</p><p>could possibly easily do it sure i&rsquo;ve done that</p><p>and i haven&rsquo;t</p><p>taken a month off but i&rsquo;ve</p><p>taken weeks off</p><p>i could take a couple days</p><p>off but why</p><p>just to see if we can</p><p>do it i don&rsquo;t see the</p><p>what is this fear factor</p><p>here&rsquo;s the purpose</p><p>here&rsquo;s the purpose</p><p>i&rsquo;ve tried i&rsquo;ve thought</p><p>about it you</p><p>smoke a shitload of weed you have to be</p><p>spending a shitload of</p><p>money i smoke a shitload of weed</p><p>and the people around me</p><p>smoke a shitload of weed</p><p>i get it dog</p><p>it&rsquo;s really</p><p>weird that the people around me are into it</p><p>like i&rsquo;m into it like the type people well we all have</p><p>fun together and</p><p>what people don&rsquo;t understand</p><p>about marijuana is that they</p><p>think it&rsquo;s some sort of an escape</p><p>it&rsquo;s an enhancement</p><p>it&rsquo;s not an escape we&rsquo;re living in the same</p><p>world you&rsquo;re living in man</p><p>it&rsquo;s just more fun when you&rsquo;re high</p><p>it&rsquo;s really that simple and it&rsquo;s not ruining your body</p><p>it&rsquo;s bullshit</p><p>and i&rsquo;m not saying</p><p>you steak no</p><p>it ain&rsquo;t for take</p><p>take can&rsquo;t smoke weed</p><p>you know stan hope</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t like</p><p>weed there&rsquo;s a lot of our friends don&rsquo;t like weed</p><p>that&rsquo;s all well and good man</p><p>fine yeah you know i don&rsquo;t like</p><p>i mean i&rsquo;ve been smoking weed so much that i mean i</p><p>could take a couple days off i could take</p><p>probably a week</p><p>i&rsquo;ve probably</p><p>taken a week off recently but but</p><p>that the idea of taking a</p><p>month off is so</p><p>weird foreign to me that i almost</p><p>want to do it just to see what happens like you must</p><p>talk about it do she you&rsquo;d become a republican i</p><p>watch bill o&rsquo;reilly i have no idea he&rsquo;s</p><p>right we do have to be afraid of mexicans i&rsquo;ve been</p><p>stop smoking weed</p><p>since fourteen fifteen i tell a</p><p>point in my life of my weed career</p><p>i can&rsquo;t write anymore when i get really high</p><p>really you like when i get up in the morning</p><p>i get high it&rsquo;s to go on twitter and facebook and</p><p>make adjustments</p><p>here and get my day</p><p>ready right</p><p>but like now when i</p><p>write i try to be a little straighter</p><p>really when i work out i got a</p><p>blaze dog if i</p><p>could get an edible</p><p>i gotta get an edible</p><p>me i love working out stone</p><p>that is my life that was how i did</p><p>thirty years ago</p><p>i love not remembering what set it is and i know my</p><p>shoulders on fire</p><p>you know i&rsquo;m saying i love the fact that</p><p>if i get if i don&rsquo;t get high i&rsquo;ll</p><p>still work out an hour</p><p>and i still do a good job</p><p>but if i work if i get high i work on an hour forty</p><p>it&rsquo;s just a little tighter i concentrate</p><p>on my kicks i concentrate</p><p>on the form</p><p>yeah i know what you mean i try to do</p><p>everything i</p><p>when i kick the bag on them how usually i don&rsquo;t</p><p>what a great</p><p>feel i don&rsquo;t</p><p>usually i kick the</p><p>pole holding the bag by mistake i won&rsquo;t</p><p>but i like getting on the bike stone yeah</p><p>think about it i like</p><p>the elliptical</p><p>the elliptical</p><p>stone is a fucking different world</p><p>you know how many people roll stoned</p><p>jiu jitsu oh you have to everybody does no no no</p><p>especially eddie&rsquo;s classes</p><p>eddie&rsquo;s classes like you walk in the room you</p><p>smell reefer</p><p>you some everyone</p><p>smells like reefer there&rsquo;s like half</p><p>of his fucking students are high as fuck when you take</p><p>you eat a piece of banana cake and you go to yoga oh</p><p>yeah my god</p><p>would you know that that&rsquo;s mckenna</p><p>used to say that that&rsquo;s what yoga was invented for</p><p>what yoga was invented for was</p><p>maximizing cannabis it was</p><p>these people</p><p>would be eating cannabis</p><p>and when they were eating it they realized how good</p><p>it felt when you hold your body in certain positions</p><p>with no fucking</p><p>idea so they came up with this like</p><p>connection to spirituality</p><p>through eating cannabis</p><p>and holding</p><p>these poses</p><p>these difficult</p><p>poses fucking amazing</p><p>yeah cause something i don&rsquo;t know what it is</p><p>about the energy of the</p><p>pose that makes you go into some</p><p>state when you&rsquo;re high as fuck</p><p>but it really</p><p>does even if when you&rsquo;re sober man i&rsquo;ve done yoga sober</p><p>and after it&rsquo;s over i felt high well the breathing</p><p>the breathing</p><p>intent the breathing that&rsquo;s</p><p>going through your body is</p><p>focusing so much on the breathing</p><p>when i go in and i</p><p>ate a little</p><p>piece of banana</p><p>bread cause it&rsquo;s</p><p>eight thirty in the morning when i</p><p>gotta go to you oh my goodness so i gotta</p><p>start blazing the</p><p>seven thirty but by the</p><p>time how long does it take to for a banana</p><p>bread to hit you</p><p>twenty minutes</p><p>twenty minutes</p><p>twenty five minutes i kick a little jaffa j to get</p><p>everything going</p><p>by ten afternoon</p><p>i&rsquo;ve been downward dog i&rsquo;ve been fucking</p><p>pigeons i&rsquo;m in fun</p><p>and it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s you think</p><p>about your breathing</p><p>is so beautiful when you&rsquo;re high</p><p>i want you to go in the water</p><p>and you have like and you</p><p>could hear your breathe</p><p>like right now yes</p><p>yeah when you</p><p>do yoga you can hear if you hear that you&rsquo;ve reached it</p><p>right you reach that</p><p>level in that position</p><p>right and with the weed it makes it a lot easier</p><p>for me i&rsquo;m a</p><p>loser i know ain&rsquo;t</p><p>gonna lie you know you ain&rsquo;t a</p><p>loser what you</p><p>talking about man really</p><p>like i said that&rsquo;s what the reason why</p><p>yoga may have</p><p>very well been invented according to mckenna they</p><p>believe they were they invented yoga to maximize</p><p>the the effects of eating cannabis</p><p>it&rsquo;s some i&rsquo;ve gotten high play</p><p>basketball i&rsquo;ve got high lifting weights</p><p>there&rsquo;s nothing like eating</p><p>a little bit of weed and</p><p>going to yoga even if it&rsquo;s a</p><p>basic class</p><p>just to focus on your breathing i do it</p><p>every tuesday</p><p>tomorrow i can&rsquo;t i</p><p>gotta rush and then go to the airport</p><p>but i&rsquo;ll do it i&rsquo;ll eat an</p><p>edible in the morning</p><p>cause i have nothing else</p><p>and it is just fucking brilliant my body</p><p>randy parsons your good friend</p><p>ryan ryan parsons was at</p><p>the gym one day at justin&rsquo;s and there was an argument</p><p>going on between</p><p>trainers and</p><p>these guys were</p><p>white guys they were in heads</p><p>the guy was saying that he&rsquo;s been telling all his</p><p>clients to if please</p><p>after their workouts</p><p>their weight workouts to</p><p>smoke a little reef</p><p>because it&rsquo;s</p><p>anti inflammatory</p><p>and it works better than anything</p><p>else even like the lettuce and shit it pulls the acid</p><p>out of your muscles lettuce</p><p>like lettuce when you</p><p>eat lettuce it pulls the acid out of your muscles when</p><p>you work out something like that</p><p>acid does something</p><p>lettuce does something</p><p>after you work out okay the</p><p>acid out of your muscles</p><p>so they can recover or something</p><p>okay well this guy was talking</p><p>about that weed</p><p>does that weeds an anti inflammatory yes really</p><p>and that they&rsquo;re</p><p>scared to tell people because we&rsquo;ll go fucking crazy</p><p>well it kind of makes</p><p>sense if it&rsquo;s a pain killer if people</p><p>enjoy it for pain</p><p>it kind of makes</p><p>sense that it</p><p>would also be</p><p>you know for</p><p>inflammation he said it&rsquo;s</p><p>really good for your joints yeah do something with the</p><p>well that&rsquo;s one of the reason</p><p>they prescribe it for arthritis arthritis</p><p>yeah people a lot of people that have chronic arthritis</p><p>like i&rsquo;ve talked to people that said that they they</p><p>literally couldn&rsquo;t move</p><p>and then they would</p><p>smoke weed and then all the</p><p>sudden they</p><p>could walk around like they</p><p>could function</p><p>you know it allowed them to be mobile</p><p>i don&rsquo;t know man it makes</p><p>sense i mean</p><p>it helps a lot</p><p>of people in a lot of different ways it&rsquo;s just a</p><p>shame that we have to pretend that something</p><p>wrong with it</p><p>and people want us to</p><p>think it&rsquo;s not a big deal like why do you guys talk</p><p>about weed all time fucking</p><p>losers first of</p><p>all we&rsquo;re not</p><p>losers and don&rsquo;t be mean</p><p>and second of all</p><p>it is a fucking important</p><p>issue man it</p><p>is important we know ourselves how it affects us</p><p>we know ourselves how much more aware</p><p>thank god you turn his mic off right</p><p>still get here and still get</p><p>that&rsquo;s i wanted from</p><p>what i wanted from we</p><p>twenty years ago</p><p>is not what i

i couldn&rsquo;t</p><p>use it no there&rsquo;s garbage no what happened was wrong</p><p>it was really</p><p>weird joe because</p><p>if you notice</p><p>after that i</p><p>changed everything</p><p>i hate listening to myself or</p><p>watching myself let&rsquo;s get this out of the way</p><p>i got boxes of shit at the</p><p>house people give me</p><p>a but i taped you i don&rsquo;t want to see myself not at all</p><p>and i thought there was a problem and one that i</p><p>watched that johnny depp on let him in</p><p>and let him</p><p>set them so</p><p>after the thing is no no no no</p><p>after i shoot</p><p>it&rsquo;s over i don&rsquo;t</p><p>watch myself because really i</p><p>felt okay i&rsquo;m not the only retard i don&rsquo;t like nothing</p><p>about that that&rsquo;s why i</p><p>never listen to myself doing stand up</p><p>i can&rsquo;t take my voice</p><p>but after i take that</p><p>special and i listen to it i was so ashamed of myself</p><p>that i made notes and shit</p><p>really help me and i</p><p>still i bring the ipod on i tape myself on</p><p>short sets during the week</p><p>i&rsquo;m up to like six minutes and i got to shut it off</p><p>you know i can&rsquo;t listen to the</p><p>whole thing and some</p><p>it&rsquo;s hard to listen</p><p>to yourself but it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s good</p><p>because like what you said</p><p>how you you</p><p>force yourself to really</p><p>yeah five years</p><p>twisted you</p><p>got to do that man you got to do that you can&rsquo;t</p><p>just take it on the audience&rsquo;s reaction you got to</p><p>judge it as if you&rsquo;re a comic</p><p>listening to another comic too</p><p>you know when i listen to my</p><p>stuff i go hmm</p><p>what how would i feel</p><p>about this is this</p><p>funny to me</p><p>you know i listen to it and i you know</p><p>forget about</p><p>how the audience is</p><p>laughing what does this make me</p><p>think does this make me do i</p><p>think this is the</p><p>right way to do this bit</p><p>should i shorten this part</p><p>this to verbose is this to this is this to that</p><p>and when you do that man</p><p>everything gets tighter and</p><p>stronger you</p><p>focus on it</p><p>it&rsquo;s uncomfortable though it&rsquo;s a terrible feeling</p><p>you feel like you&rsquo;re</p><p>it&rsquo;s a weird thing man</p><p>because the same the energy that</p><p>brings you to be creative</p><p>the energy that</p><p>brings you to</p><p>smash it on stage</p><p>that is not a</p><p>selfish energy people</p><p>think it is</p><p>because it seems like it is</p><p>cause you&rsquo;re on</p><p>stage going what the fuck cocksucker</p><p>and everyone&rsquo;s laughing</p><p>but to do it</p><p>right to be</p><p>tuned in to</p><p>those people</p><p>really you have to be almost</p><p>selfless you</p><p>have to be tuned in this crazy way</p><p>where it&rsquo;s all just</p><p>about this fun that we&rsquo;re having it&rsquo;s not</p><p>about me it ain&rsquo;t</p><p>about me you know i&rsquo;m saying</p><p>so it&rsquo;s like</p><p>the opposite that you</p><p>would get from</p><p>like someone who like listens</p><p>to themselves like yeah i&rsquo;m the shit listen to me</p><p>i&rsquo;m the shit</p><p>it&rsquo;s almost like you know that that&rsquo;s the poison that</p><p>thinking like that is the poison that takes away the</p><p>magic because if you</p><p>start thinking you&rsquo;re the shed you</p><p>start thinking you know</p><p>that you&rsquo;re something special and</p><p>you lose your</p><p>whole connection with the</p><p>magic you know</p><p>so that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why you feel uncomfortable</p><p>you don&rsquo;t wanna listen and</p><p>you don&rsquo;t wanna be that guy who wants</p><p>to get get in my car listen to my new</p><p>my set last</p><p>night tell me</p><p>tell me what i did you know</p><p>you ever been in someone&rsquo;s car and they make you listen</p><p>to their fucking routine</p><p>tell me about this new bit is there anything you</p><p>could add to this</p><p>like oh jeez i</p><p>wrote this joke i want to try oh no</p><p>yeah yeah don&rsquo;t try i&rsquo;ve</p><p>never tried i don&rsquo;t try</p><p>yeah you say it or you don&rsquo;t say it</p><p>you know if you just the idea that you&rsquo;re trying it out</p><p>look it ain&rsquo;t a fucking weapon all</p><p>right it&rsquo;s goddamn joke doing a</p><p>stage do it on a</p><p>stage take your goddamn chances</p><p>and the more</p><p>you do that the more you know what the fucks</p><p>gonna work in the</p><p>first place you don&rsquo;t have to talk to people</p><p>about stuff like that you know it&rsquo;s</p><p>crazy because with</p><p>me i have a hard time writing if i&rsquo;m not in the zone</p><p>hmm well i&rsquo;m with people like i like</p><p>getting pissed off to a degree before i go on stage</p><p>like i like get a little</p><p>pissed off is</p><p>something i make yeah you get mad you get like</p><p>fake arguments with people i want to do that one time</p><p>eddie bravo we were all in</p><p>the back at the</p><p>house of blues</p><p>he&rsquo;s like you guys with your fucking bullshit</p><p>you fucking</p><p>me and he&rsquo;s like why is joey getting</p><p>upset i&rsquo;m like</p><p>just gotta put himself in that place</p><p>he&rsquo;s not really mad at us</p><p>no

was smoking weed with an</p><p>apple when i was five</p><p>it&rsquo;s just really</p><p>crazy how when i&rsquo;m around you guys</p><p>sometimes just being mad makes me</p><p>say something you like joey you got a fucking say that</p><p>yeah and i&rsquo;ll forget for a</p><p>month i&rsquo;ll forget</p><p>you guys like joey did you say the fucking</p><p>stage yet i&rsquo;m like</p><p>you guys gotta</p><p>force me i&rsquo;m</p><p>like your records keeper i&rsquo;m always telling</p><p>you about that shit</p><p>did you do you</p><p>still doing that thing</p><p>about a dead dick

fucking christ</p><p>i&rsquo;ve never seen anybody kill harder than that</p><p>the only thing</p><p>that was closer to someone killing harder than that</p><p>was when you killed in</p><p>vegas at the</p><p>mandalay bay theater</p><p>holy shit when you were doing that bit</p><p>about fucking</p><p>having that fist</p><p>fight with the nun</p><p>holy shit i</p><p>might not have ever</p><p>laughed that hard at anything ever in my whole life</p><p>it was the funniest</p><p>thing i&rsquo;ve ever seen you know we missed a comedy store</p><p>and that&rsquo;s the bad</p><p>thing because during the week that&rsquo;s what you enjoyed</p><p>laughing at each</p><p>other laughing</p><p>at each other and</p><p>that really</p><p>took away from my career because you see bill</p><p>burgold on a tuesday yeah</p><p>and wanna die you know he don&rsquo;t care he&rsquo;s so confident</p><p>that you want to try different things</p><p>you know we always get into conversations nostalgic</p><p>about the store and</p><p>at the end they were constant</p><p>whatever but</p><p>you know i don&rsquo;t take away the</p><p>truth from anything</p><p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really lacking i wish we had and the</p><p>sounds is becoming sounds is</p><p>becoming that we just need some more people to go</p><p>down there support i&rsquo;ve been out of town on wednesdays</p><p>we&rsquo;ve got a</p><p>plenty plenty of people bill burr was by last week and</p><p>sarah sylvan</p><p>was by the week before</p><p>and it&rsquo;s doug benson&rsquo;s coming down all the time</p><p>steve renezez</p><p>he came and</p><p>crushed it really</p><p>i need to meet that dude i</p><p>still never met that dude</p><p>i don&rsquo;t know</p><p>i&rsquo;m a big fan of that dude that dude makes me laugh</p><p>he makes me laugh like</p><p>very few dudes he&rsquo;s one of my top favorite guys to</p><p>watch that was like if</p><p>someone sends me a clip</p><p>someone sends me a clip and says</p><p>hey check out this katt williams clip</p><p>that fucking</p><p>thing where he was</p><p>going after</p><p>steve harvey</p><p>oh shit that&rsquo;s funny</p><p>and one of the</p><p>things he&rsquo;s accentuate something</p><p>and as they accentuate it he</p><p>slides across the room</p><p>like he&rsquo;s kicking someone in the nuts</p><p>and as he does it he goes i&rsquo;m a little nigga i</p><p>fight dirty</p><p>and he slides</p><p>slides on the stage</p><p>with his little</p><p>foot up in the air like he&rsquo;s kicking somebody</p><p>in the balls</p><p>he&rsquo;s a wild</p><p>dude man he makes me</p><p>laugh hard we were talking</p><p>about him a nerve</p><p>yeah you have no idea the numbers he does oh he does</p><p>crazy numbers</p><p>he goes you know that</p><p>place where we go to the ufc</p><p>he does that he does the</p><p>pearl at the palms that&rsquo;s like 5 000 seats</p><p>that&rsquo;s a big ass</p><p>place they have</p><p>big bands there katt william sells that fucker out man</p><p>and there&rsquo;s</p><p>pictures of him in</p><p>the casino with like fur coats on and shit and diamonds</p><p>he&rsquo;s hilarious man</p><p>that dude really makes me laugh</p><p>cause he&rsquo;s just</p><p>going for it all the time</p><p>he&rsquo;s not trying to be anything</p><p>other than he is</p><p>he&rsquo;s just trying to be</p><p>funny he&rsquo;s just</p><p>going for it all the time</p><p>going for the funny</p><p>going for the funny</p><p>and he&rsquo;s fucking good dude</p><p>he does a funny thing</p><p>about fucking shaquille o&rsquo;neal trying to be a cop</p><p>dude it&rsquo;s fucking hilarious</p><p>it&rsquo;s about how</p><p>shaquille o&rsquo;neal&rsquo;s</p><p>three year old was his height</p><p>it&rsquo;s oh oh oh dude</p><p>it&rsquo;s so funny</p><p>that special and that</p><p>thing that he did on michael jackson that made him a</p><p>storm when you</p><p>watch that bit on youtube</p><p>you watch that and you see the</p><p>black people</p><p>they don&rsquo;t even know how to act because he&rsquo;s saying</p><p>the truth yeah see the</p><p>truth is a motherfucker when you say it the</p><p>right way on stage</p><p>even if it&rsquo;s</p><p>wrong what he was saying</p><p>where&rsquo;s michael jackson</p><p>he&rsquo;s probably</p><p>smelling little</p><p>baby&rsquo;s booty holes or</p><p>something that is a</p><p>classic fucking line and he just runs from</p><p>there with it guys yeah he runs with it he attacked</p><p>when was the last time you seen michael jackson with a</p><p>woman not never</p><p>because all that</p><p>crazy shit brother that shit was that made him</p><p>a star that little piece</p><p>of him being himself</p><p>just that little</p><p>piece that comics pray for that utopia to come</p><p>one day it&rsquo;s important to have guys like that out there</p><p>i like guys that are just</p><p>going for it</p><p>you know i like guys are out there just fucking</p><p>going for it</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that</p><p>think the comedy</p><p>is you know comedy is</p><p>about the respect of your peers and creating the proper</p><p>clever joke with the</p><p>right wording and</p><p>it&rsquo;s not man it&rsquo;s</p><p>about entertainment</p><p>value it&rsquo;s about your</p><p>stand up comedy</p><p>and to these</p><p>these days man</p><p>you comedy doesn&rsquo;t even nearly have</p><p>to be that deep anymore if you want to get deep man</p><p>why you tell you know</p><p>you can you</p><p>could do a podcast and get deep you could</p><p>write a blog and get deep you know you could you</p><p>you can have a conversation with an intelligent person</p><p>you don&rsquo;t have to get that deep beer comedy</p><p>the shit that makes me</p><p>laugh is cat williams sliding across the floor</p><p>kicking some dude in the ball</p><p>i&rsquo;m a little</p><p>nigga i fight dirty</p><p>and when he does it&rsquo;s so natural</p><p>it&rsquo;s so funny man</p><p>ah that guy kills me man he&rsquo;s got some great shit</p><p>i i and you know what he had</p><p>he actually had some real good advice too that i took</p><p>he said that</p><p>he listens to</p><p>he has on his ipod he has like a playlist</p><p>of all music that he listens to</p><p>right before he goes on stage</p><p>and i&rsquo;m like damn that&rsquo;s a</p><p>great idea because i have just like a</p><p>group of like some of my favorite songs</p><p>on my ipod that i just i</p><p>throw on it&rsquo;s on my iphone too i&rsquo;ll</p><p>throw them on like when i&rsquo;m</p><p>at the gym or whatever but i don&rsquo;t have a specific list</p><p>just for stand up</p><p>but that&rsquo;s a good fucking idea</p><p>it&rsquo;s a real good idea so i</p><p>started doing that</p><p>i started doing that just</p><p>based on that</p><p>because i know</p><p>music if you listen to like</p><p>the right kind of music</p><p>the right kind of</p><p>music can fucking get you in a good groove</p><p>man you know</p><p>especially if you haven&rsquo;t</p><p>sometimes when</p><p>you listen to</p><p>music too much you lose its</p><p>power you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have that feeling anymore it just loses its impact</p><p>but every now and then a song will just</p><p>jack you and let you know what&rsquo;s possible</p><p>remember when we were at the brea</p><p>improv and we were in the parking lot</p><p>and i had that nissan truck</p><p>and you got out and had that crazy</p><p>sound system in</p><p>and you got out of your car you like joe rogan</p><p>joe rogan put this fucking cd in</p><p>right now in the summer down to summer</p><p>hot stuff you put on hot stuff</p><p>sitting here eating</p><p>my heart oh it&rsquo;s a</p><p>good shit on that</p><p>greatest hits</p><p>some music drives you fucking nuts</p><p>i love music i love music</p><p>i love love it skinner</p><p>listen to let it skin it lately oh shit</p><p>i love that</p><p>skinner i love</p><p>almond brothers from the 70s leonard skinner</p><p>i love that vibe man there&rsquo;s</p><p>something about that time like</p><p>if i&rsquo;m in a pool hall and</p><p>sweet home alabama comes on it&rsquo;s like</p><p>like your girlfriend just comes over and rubs your neck</p><p>you know i&rsquo;m saying</p><p>it&rsquo;s like someone comes over and gives you a hug</p><p>like that&rsquo;s like don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t</p><p>you know that you</p><p>oh sweet song</p><p>what a great song</p><p>this guy blue</p><p>what&rsquo;s
