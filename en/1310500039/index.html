    <p>The following is a conversation with Colin Angle.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the CEO and co founder of iRobot,</p>
<p>a robotics company that for 29 years</p>
<p>has been creating robots that operate successfully</p>
<p>in the real world.</p>
<p>Not as a demo or on a scale of dozens,</p>
<p>but on a scale of thousands and millions.</p>
<p>As of this year, iRobot has sold more than</p>
<p>25 million robots to consumers,</p>
<p>including the Roomba vacuum cleaning robot,</p>
<p>the Bravo floor mopping robot,</p>
<p>and soon the Terra lawn mowing robot.</p>
<p>29 million robots successfully operating autonomously</p>
<p>in real people&rsquo;s homes,</p>
<p>to me is an incredible accomplishment</p>
<p>of science, engineering, logistics,</p>
<p>and all kinds of general entrepreneurial innovation.</p>
<p>Most robotics companies fail.</p>
<p>iRobot has survived and succeeded for 29 years.</p>
<p>I spent all day at iRobot,</p>
<p>including a long tour and conversation with Colin</p>
<p>about the history of iRobot,</p>
<p>and then sat down for this podcast conversation</p>
<p>that would have been much longer</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t spend all day learning about</p>
<p>and playing with the various robots</p>
<p>and the company&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll release the video of the tour separately.</p>
<p>Colin, iRobot, its founding team, its current team,</p>
<p>and its mission has been and continues to be</p>
<p>an inspiration to me and thousands of engineers</p>
<p>who are working hard to create AI systems</p>
<p>that help real people.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give it five stars on iTunes,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Colin Angle.</p>
<p>In his 1942 short story, Runaround,</p>
<p>from his iRobot collection, Asimov proposed</p>
<p>the three laws of robotics in order,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t harm humans, obey orders, protect yourself.</p>
<p>So two questions.</p>
<p>First, does the Roomba follow these three laws?</p>
<p>And also, more seriously,</p>
<p>what role do you hope to see robots take</p>
<p>in modern society and in the future world?</p>
<p>So the three laws are very thought provoking</p>
<p>and require such a profound understanding</p>
<p>of the world a robot lives in,</p>
<p>the ramifications of its action and its own sense of self</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not a relevant bar,</p>
<p>at least it won&rsquo;t be a relevant bar for decades to come.</p>
<p>And so if Roomba follows the three laws,</p>
<p>and I believe it does,</p>
<p>it is designed to help humans, not hurt them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s designed to be inherently safe,</p>
<p>and we designed it to last a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not through any AI or intent on the robot&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because following the three laws</p>
<p>is aligned with being a good robot product.</p>
<p>So I guess it does,</p>
<p>but not by explicit design.</p>
<p>So then the bigger picture,</p>
<p>what role do you hope to see robotics, robots take</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s currently mostly a world of humans?</p>
<p>We need robots to help us continue</p>
<p>to improve our standard of living.</p>
<p>We need robots because the average age</p>
<p>of humanity is increasing very quickly,</p>
<p>and simply the number of people young enough</p>
<p>and spry enough to care</p>
<p>for the elder growing demographic is inadequate.</p>
<p>And so what is the role of robots?</p>
<p>Today, the role is to make our lives a little easier,</p>
<p>a little cleaner, maybe a little healthier.</p>
<p>But in time, robots are going to be the difference</p>
<p>between real gut wrenching declines</p>
<p>in our ability to live independently</p>
<p>and maintain our standard of living,</p>
<p>and a future that is the bright one</p>
<p>where we have more control over our lives,</p>
<p>can spend more of our time focused</p>
<p>on activities we choose.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so honored and excited</p>
<p>to be playing a role in that journey.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve given me a tour.</p>
<p>It showed me some of the long histories,</p>
<p>now 29 years that iRobot has been at it,</p>
<p>creating some incredible robots.</p>
<p>You showed me Pacbot.</p>
<p>You showed me a bunch of other stuff that led up to Roomba,</p>
<p>that led to Braava and Terra.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s skip that incredible history</p>
<p>in the interest of time,</p>
<p>cause we already talked about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show this incredible footage.</p>
<p>You mentioned elderly and robotics in society.</p>
<p>I think the home is a fascinating place for robots to be.</p>
<p>So where do you see robots in the home?</p>
<p>Currently, I would say, once again,</p>
<p>probably most homes in the world don&rsquo;t have a robot.</p>
<p>So how do you see that changing?</p>
<p>What do you think is the big initial value add</p>
<p>that robots can do?</p>
<p>So iRobot has sort of, over the years,</p>
<p>narrowed in on the home, the consumer&rsquo;s home,</p>
<p>as the place where we want to innovate</p>
<p>and deliver tools that will help a home</p>
<p>be a more automatically maintained place,</p>
<p>a healthier place, a safer place,</p>
<p>and perhaps even a more efficient place to be.</p>
<p>And today, we vacuum, we mop,</p>
<p>soon we&rsquo;ll be mowing your lawn.</p>
<p>But where things are going is,</p>
<p>when do we get to the point where the home,</p>
<p>not just the robots that live in your home,</p>
<p>but the home itself becomes part of a system</p>
<p>that maintains itself and plays an active role</p>
<p>in caring for and helping the people live in that home.</p>
<p>And I see everything that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>as steps along the path toward that future.</p>
<p>So what are the steps?</p>
<p>So if we can summarize some of the history of Roomba,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve mentioned, and maybe you can elaborate on it,</p>
<p>but you mentioned that the early days</p>
<p>were really taking a robot from something that works</p>
<p>either in the lab or something that works in the field</p>
<p>that helps soldiers do the difficult work they do</p>
<p>to actually be in the hands of consumers</p>
<p>and tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of robots</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t break down over how much people love them</p>
<p>over months of very extensive use.</p>
<p>So that was the big first step.</p>
<p>And then the second big step was the ability</p>
<p>to sense the environment, to build a map, to localize,</p>
<p>to be able to build a picture of the home</p>
<p>that the human can then attach labels to</p>
<p>in terms of giving some semantic knowledge</p>
<p>to the robot about its environment.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s like a huge, two big, huge steps.</p>
<p>Maybe you can comment on them,</p>
<p>but also what is the next step</p>
<p>of making a robot part of the home?</p>
<p>Sure, so the goal is to make a home</p>
<p>that takes care of itself,</p>
<p>takes care of the people in the home,</p>
<p>and gives the user an experience of just living their life</p>
<p>and the home is somehow doing the right thing,</p>
<p>turning on and off lights when you leave,</p>
<p>cleaning up the environment.</p>
<p>And we went from robots that were great in the lab,</p>
<p>but were both too expensive</p>
<p>and not sufficiently capable to ever do an acceptable job</p>
<p>of anything other than being a toy or a curio in your home</p>
<p>to something that was both affordable</p>
<p>and sufficiently effective to drive,</p>
<p>be above threshold and drive purchase intent.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve disrupted the entire vacuuming industry.</p>
<p>The number one selling vacuums, for example, in the US</p>
<p>are Roombas, so not robot vacuums, but vacuums,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really crazy and weird.</p>
<p>We need to pause that. I mean, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible that a robot</p>
<p>is the number one selling thing that does something.</p>
<p>Yep. Something as essential as vacuuming.</p>
<p>Yep. Congratulations.</p>
<p>Thank you. It&rsquo;s still kind of fun to say,</p>
<p>but just because this was a crazy idea</p>
<p>that just started, you know, in a room here,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like, do you think we can do this?</p>
<p>So, hey, let&rsquo;s give it a try.</p>
<p>But now the robots are starting to understand their environment.</p>
<p>And if you think about the next step,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two dimensions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working so hard since the beginning of iRobot</p>
<p>to make robots are autonomous,</p>
<p>that, you know, they&rsquo;re smart enough</p>
<p>and understand their task enough,</p>
<p>they can just go do it without human involvement.</p>
<p>Now what I&rsquo;m really excited and working on</p>
<p>is how do I make them less autonomous?</p>
<p>Meaning that the robot is supposed to be your partner,</p>
<p>not this automaton that just goes and does what a robot does.</p>
<p>And so that if you tell it,</p>
<p>hey, I just dropped some flour by the fridge in the kitchen,</p>
<p>can you deal with it?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be awesome if the right thing just happened</p>
<p>based on that utterance?</p>
<p>And to some extent, that&rsquo;s less autonomous</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually listening to you,</p>
<p>understanding the context and intent of the sentence,</p>
<p>mapping it against its understanding</p>
<p>of the home it lives in and knowing what to do.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an area of research.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an area where we&rsquo;re starting to roll out features.</p>
<p>You can now tell your robot to clean up the kitchen</p>
<p>and it knows what the kitchen is and can do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of 1.0 of where we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>The other cool thing is that we&rsquo;re starting</p>
<p>to know where stuff is.</p>
<p>And why is that important?</p>
<p>Well, robots are supposed to have arms, right?</p>
<p>Data had an arm, Rosie had an arm, Robbie the robot had an arm.</p>
<p>I mean, robots are, you know, they are physical things</p>
<p>that move around in an environment</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re supposed to like do work.</p>
<p>And if you think about it,</p>
<p>if a robot doesn&rsquo;t know where anything is,</p>
<p>why should it have an arm?</p>
<p>But with this new dawn of home understanding</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re starting to go enjoy,</p>
<p>I know where the kitchen is.</p>
<p>I might in the future know where the refrigerator is.</p>
<p>I might, if I had an arm, be able to find the handle,</p>
<p>open it and even get myself a beer.</p>
<p>Obviously, that&rsquo;s one of the true dreams of robotics</p>
<p>is to have robots bringing us a beer</p>
<p>while we watch television.</p>
<p>But, you know, I think that that new category of tasks</p>
<p>where physical manipulation, robot arms,</p>
<p>is just a potpourri of new opportunity and excitement.</p>
<p>And you see humans as a crucial part of that.</p>
<p>So you kind of mentioned that.</p>
<p>And I personally find that a really compelling idea.</p>
<p>I think full autonomy can only take us so far,</p>
<p>especially in the home.</p>
<p>So you see humans as helping the robot understand</p>
<p>or give deeper meaning to the spatial information.</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s a partnership.</p>
<p>The robot is supposed to operate according to descriptors</p>
<p>that you would use to describe your own home.</p>
<p>The robot is supposed to, in lieu of better direction,</p>
<p>kind of go about its routine,</p>
<p>which ought to be basically right,</p>
<p>and lead to a home maintained in a way</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s learned you like,</p>
<p>but also be perpetually ready to take direction</p>
<p>that would activate a different set of behaviors</p>
<p>or actions to meet a current need</p>
<p>to the extent it could actually perform that task.</p>
<p>So I got to ask you, I think this is a fundamental</p>
<p>and a fascinating question,</p>
<p>because iRobot has been a successful company</p>
<p>and a rare successful robotics company.</p>
<p>So Anki, Jibo, Mayfield Robotics with their robot curry,</p>
<p>SciFi Works, Rethink Robotics, these are robotics companies</p>
<p>that were founded and run by brilliant people.</p>
<p>But all, very unfortunately, at least for us roboticists,</p>
<p>all went out of business recently.</p>
<p>So why do you think they didn&rsquo;t last longer?</p>
<p>Why do you think it is so hard to keep a robotics company alive?</p>
<p>You know, I say this only partially in jest</p>
<p>that back in the day before Roomba,</p>
<p>you know, I was a high tech entrepreneur building robots.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t until I became a vacuum cleaner salesman</p>
<p>that we had any success.</p>
<p>So, I mean, the point is technology alone</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t equal a successful business.</p>
<p>We need to go and find the compelling need</p>
<p>where the robot that we&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>can deliver clearly more value to the end user</p>
<p>than it costs.</p>
<p>And this is not a marginal thing</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re looking at the scale and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>Maybe we can hold our breath and make it work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clearly more value than the cost of the robot</p>
<p>to bring, you know, in the store.</p>
<p>And I think that the challenge has been finding</p>
<p>those businesses where that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>in a sustainable fashion.</p>
<p>You know, when you get into entertainment style things,</p>
<p>you could be the cat&rsquo;s meow one year,</p>
<p>but 85% of toys, regardless of their merit,</p>
<p>fail to make it to their second season.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just super hard to do so.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just a tough business.</p>
<p>And there has been a lot of experimentation</p>
<p>around what is the right type of social companion,</p>
<p>what is the right robot in the home</p>
<p>that is doing something other than tasks people do every week</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;d rather not do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;ve got it all figured out right.</p>
<p>And so that you get brilliant roboticists</p>
<p>with super interesting robots</p>
<p>that ultimately don&rsquo;t quite have that magical user experience</p>
<p>and thus that value benefit equation remains ambiguous.</p>
<p>So you as somebody who dreams of robots changing the world,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your estimate?</p>
<p>How big is the space of applications</p>
<p>that fit the criteria that you just described</p>
<p>where you can really demonstrate an obvious significant value</p>
<p>over the alternative non robotic solution?</p>
<p>Well, I think that we&rsquo;re just about none of the way</p>
<p>to achieving the potential of robotics at home.</p>
<p>But we have to do it in a really eyes wide open,</p>
<p>honest fashion.</p>
<p>And so another way to put that is the potential is infinite</p>
<p>because we did take a few steps,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying those steps are just very initial steps.</p>
<p>So the Roomba is a hugely successful product,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s just the very, very beginning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the very, very beginning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the foot in the door.</p>
<p>And I think I was lucky that in the early days of robotics,</p>
<p>people would ask me, when are you going to clean my floor?</p>
<p>It was something that I grew up saying,</p>
<p>I got all these really good ideas,</p>
<p>but everyone seems to want their floor clean.</p>
<p>And so maybe we should do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, your good ideas.</p>
<p>Earn the right to do the next thing after that.</p>
<p>So the good ideas have to match with the desire of the people</p>
<p>and then the actual cost has to like the business,</p>
<p>the financial aspect has to all match together.</p>
<p>Yeah, during our partnership back a number of years ago</p>
<p>with Johnson Wax, they would explain to me</p>
<p>that they would go into homes and just watch how people lived</p>
<p>and try to figure out what were they doing</p>
<p>that they really didn&rsquo;t really like to do,</p>
<p>but they had to do it frequently enough</p>
<p>that it was top of mind and understood as a burden.</p>
<p>Hey, let&rsquo;s make a product or come up with a solution</p>
<p>to make that pain point less challenging.</p>
<p>And sometimes we do certain burdens so often as a society</p>
<p>that we actually don&rsquo;t even realize,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s actually hard to see that that burden</p>
<p>is something that could be removed.</p>
<p>So it does require just going into the home and staring at,</p>
<p>wait, how do I actually live life?</p>
<p>What are the pain points?</p>
<p>Yeah, and getting those insights is a lot harder</p>
<p>than it would seem it should be in retrospect.</p>
<p>So how hard on that point?</p>
<p>I mean, one of the big challenges of robotics</p>
<p>is driving the cost down to something</p>
<p>that consumers, people would afford.</p>
<p>So people would be less likely to buy a Roomba</p>
<p>if it cost $500,000, which is probably</p>
<p>sort of what a Roomba would cost several decades ago.</p>
<p>So how do you drive, which I mentioned is very difficult,</p>
<p>how do you drive the cost of a Roomba or a robot down</p>
<p>such that people would want to buy it?</p>
<p>When I started building robots, the cost of the robot</p>
<p>had a lot to do with the amount of time it took to build it.</p>
<p>And so that we build our robots out of aluminum,</p>
<p>I would go spend my time in the machine shop</p>
<p>on the milling machine, cutting out the parts and so forth.</p>
<p>And then when we got into the toy industry,</p>
<p>I realized that if we were building at scale,</p>
<p>I could determine the cost of the Roomba</p>
<p>instead of adding up all the hours to mill out the parts,</p>
<p>but by weighing it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s liberating.</p>
<p>You can say, wow, the world has just</p>
<p>changed as I think about construction</p>
<p>in a different way.</p>
<p>The 3D CAD tools that are available to us today,</p>
<p>the operating at scale where I can do tooling and injection</p>
<p>mold, an arbitrarily complicated part,</p>
<p>and the cost is going to be basically</p>
<p>the weight of the plastic in that part,</p>
<p>is incredibly exciting and liberating</p>
<p>and opens up all sorts of opportunities.</p>
<p>And for the sensing part of it, where we are today is instead</p>
<p>of trying to build skin, which is really hard.</p>
<p>For a long time, I spent creating strategies and ideas</p>
<p>around how could we duplicate the skin on the human body</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such an amazing sensor.</p>
<p>Instead of going down that path, why don&rsquo;t we focus on vision?</p>
<p>And how many of the problems that</p>
<p>face a robot trying to do real work</p>
<p>could be solved with a cheap camera and a big ass computer?</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s law continues to work.</p>
<p>The cell phone industry, the mobile industry</p>
<p>is giving us better and better tools that can run</p>
<p>on these embedded computers.</p>
<p>And I think we passed an important moment maybe</p>
<p>two years ago where you could put machine vision</p>
<p>capable processors on robots at consumer price points.</p>
<p>And I was waiting for it to happen.</p>
<p>We avoided putting lasers on our robots to do navigation</p>
<p>and instead spent years researching</p>
<p>how to do vision based navigation</p>
<p>because you could just see where these technology</p>
<p>trends were going.</p>
<p>And between injection molded plastic and a camera</p>
<p>with a computer capable of running machine learning</p>
<p>and visual object recognition, I could</p>
<p>build an incredibly affordable, incredibly capable robot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be the future.</p>
<p>So on that point with a small tangent,</p>
<p>but I think an important one, another industry in which I</p>
<p>would say the only other industry in which there</p>
<p>is automation actually touching people&rsquo;s lives today</p>
<p>is autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>What the vision you just described</p>
<p>of using computer vision and using cheap camera sensors,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a debate on that of LIDAR versus computer vision.</p>
<p>And the Elon Musk famously said that LIDAR</p>
<p>is a crutch that really in the long term,</p>
<p>camera only is the right solution, which echoes some</p>
<p>of the ideas you&rsquo;re expressing.</p>
<p>Of course, the domain in terms of its safety criticality</p>
<p>is different.</p>
<p>But what do you think about that approach</p>
<p>in the autonomous vehicle space?</p>
<p>And in general, do you see a connection</p>
<p>between the incredible real world challenges</p>
<p>you have to solve in the home with Roomba?</p>
<p>And I saw a demonstration of some of them, corner cases</p>
<p>literally, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s absolutely a tremendous overlap</p>
<p>between both the problems a robot vacuum</p>
<p>and an autonomous vehicle are trying to solve</p>
<p>and the tools and the types of sensors</p>
<p>that are being applied in the pursuit of the solutions.</p>
<p>In my world, my environment is actually</p>
<p>much harder than the environment an automobile travels.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have roads.</p>
<p>We have t shirts.</p>
<p>We have steps.</p>
<p>We have a near infinite number of patterns and colors</p>
<p>and surface textures on the floor.</p>
<p>Especially from a visual perspective.</p>
<p>So the way the world looks is an infinitely variable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, safety is way easier on the inside.</p>
<p>My robots, they&rsquo;re not very heavy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not very fast.</p>
<p>If they bump into your foot, you think it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>And autonomous vehicles kind of have the inverse problem.</p>
<p>And so that for me saying vision is the future,</p>
<p>I can say that without reservation.</p>
<p>For autonomous vehicles, I think I</p>
<p>believe what Elon&rsquo;s saying about the future</p>
<p>is ultimately going to be vision.</p>
<p>Maybe if we put a cheap lighter on there as a backup sensor,</p>
<p>it might not be the worst idea in the world.</p>
<p>So the stakes are much higher.</p>
<p>The stakes are much higher.</p>
<p>You have to be much more careful thinking through how far away</p>
<p>that future is.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I think that the primary environmental understanding</p>
<p>sensor is going to be a visual system.</p>
<p>Visual system.</p>
<p>So on that point, well, let me ask,</p>
<p>do you hope there&rsquo;s an iRobot robot in every home</p>
<p>in the world one day?</p>
<p>I expect there to be at least one iRobot robot in every home.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve sold 25 million robots.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in about 10% of US homes, which is a great start.</p>
<p>But I think that when we think about the numbers of things</p>
<p>that robots can do, today I can vacuum your floor,</p>
<p>mop your floor, cut your lawn, or soon</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be able to cut your lawn.</p>
<p>But there are more things that we could do in the home.</p>
<p>And I hope that we continue using the techniques I described</p>
<p>around exploiting computer vision and low cost</p>
<p>manufacturing that we&rsquo;ll be able to create these solutions</p>
<p>at affordable price points.</p>
<p>So let me ask on that point of a robot in every home,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my dream as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see that.</p>
<p>I think the possibilities there are indeed</p>
<p>infinite positive possibilities.</p>
<p>But in our current culture, no thanks to science fiction</p>
<p>and so on, there&rsquo;s a serious kind of hesitation, anxiety,</p>
<p>concern about robots, and also a concern about privacy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a fascinating question to me</p>
<p>why that concern is amongst a certain group of people</p>
<p>is as intense as it is.</p>
<p>So you have to think about it because it&rsquo;s a serious concern.</p>
<p>But I wonder how you address it best.</p>
<p>So from a perspective of vision sensors,</p>
<p>so robots that move about the home and sense the world,</p>
<p>how do you alleviate people&rsquo;s privacy concerns?</p>
<p>How do you make sure that they can</p>
<p>trust iRobot and the robots that they share their home with?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve really leaned way forward on this</p>
<p>because given our vision as to the role the company intends</p>
<p>to play in the home, really for us,</p>
<p>make or break is can our approach</p>
<p>be trusted to protecting the data</p>
<p>and the privacy of the people who have our robots?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve gone out publicly with a privacy</p>
<p>manifesto stating we&rsquo;ll never sell your data.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve adopted GDPR not just where GDPR is required,</p>
<p>but globally.</p>
<p>We have ensured that images don&rsquo;t leave the robot.</p>
<p>So processing data from the visual sensors</p>
<p>happens locally on the robot.</p>
<p>And only semantic knowledge of the home with the consumer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>consent is sent up.</p>
<p>We show you what we know and are trying</p>
<p>to go use data as an enabler for the performance of the robots</p>
<p>with the informed consent and understanding of the people who</p>
<p>own those robots.</p>
<p>We take it very seriously.</p>
<p>And ultimately, we think that by showing a customer that</p>
<p>if you let us build a semantic map of your home</p>
<p>and know where the rooms are, well, then</p>
<p>you can say clean the kitchen.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want the robot to do that, don&rsquo;t make the map.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll do its best job cleaning your home.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t be able to do that.</p>
<p>And if you ever want us to forget that we know that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your kitchen, you can have confidence</p>
<p>that we will do that for you.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to go and be a data 2.0 perspective company</p>
<p>where we treat the data that the robots have</p>
<p>of the consumer&rsquo;s home as if it were the consumer&rsquo;s data</p>
<p>and that they have rights to it.</p>
<p>So we think by being the good guys on this front,</p>
<p>we can build the trust and thus be entrusted</p>
<p>to enable robots to do more things that are thoughtful.</p>
<p>You think people&rsquo;s worries will diminish over time?</p>
<p>As a society, broadly speaking, do you</p>
<p>think you can win over trust not just for the company,</p>
<p>but just the comfort that people have with AI in their home</p>
<p>enriching their lives in some way?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in an interesting place today</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s less about winning them over</p>
<p>and more about finding a way to talk about privacy in a way</p>
<p>that more people can understand.</p>
<p>I would tell you that today, when there&rsquo;s a privacy breach,</p>
<p>people get very upset and then go to the store</p>
<p>and buy the cheapest thing, paying no attention</p>
<p>to whether or not the products that they&rsquo;re buying</p>
<p>honor privacy standards or not.</p>
<p>In fact, if I put on the package of my Roomba,</p>
<p>the privacy commitments that we have,</p>
<p>I would sell less than I would if I did nothing at all.</p>
<p>And that needs to change.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a question about earning trust.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s necessary but not sufficient.</p>
<p>We need to figure out how to have</p>
<p>a comfortable set of what is the grade A meat</p>
<p>standard applied to privacy that customers can trust</p>
<p>and understand and then use in their buying decisions.</p>
<p>That will reward companies for good behavior</p>
<p>and that will ultimately be how this moves forward.</p>
<p>And maybe be part of the conversation</p>
<p>between regular people about what it means,</p>
<p>what privacy means.</p>
<p>If you have some standards, you can say,</p>
<p>you can start talking about who&rsquo;s following them,</p>
<p>who does not have more.</p>
<p>Because most people are actually quite clueless</p>
<p>about all aspects of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>the data collection, and so on.</p>
<p>It would be nice to change that for people</p>
<p>to understand the good that AI can do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not some system that&rsquo;s trying to steal</p>
<p>all the most sensitive data.</p>
<p>Do you think, do you dream of a Roomba</p>
<p>with human level intelligence one day?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned a very successful localization</p>
<p>and mapping of the environment, being</p>
<p>able to do some basic communication to say,</p>
<p>go clean the kitchen.</p>
<p>Do you see in your maybe more bored moments,</p>
<p>once you get the beer, to sit back with that beer</p>
<p>and have a chat on a Friday night with a Roomba</p>
<p>about how your day went?</p>
<p>So to your latter question, absolutely.</p>
<p>To your former question as to whether a Roomba</p>
<p>can have human level intelligence, not in my lifetime.</p>
<p>You can have you.</p>
<p>I think you can have a great conversation,</p>
<p>a meaningful conversation with a Roomba</p>
<p>without it having anything that resembles</p>
<p>human level intelligence.</p>
<p>And I think that as long as you realize that conversation</p>
<p>is not about the robot and making the robot feel good.</p>
<p>That conversation is about you learning interesting things</p>
<p>that make you feel like the conversation that you</p>
<p>had with the robot is a pretty awesome way</p>
<p>of learning something.</p>
<p>And it could be about what kind of day your pet had.</p>
<p>It could be about how can I make my home more energy efficient.</p>
<p>It could be about if I&rsquo;m thinking about climbing</p>
<p>Mount Everest, what should I know?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very doable thing.</p>
<p>But if I think that that conversation</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have with the robot is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be rewarded by making the robot happy,</p>
<p>well, I could just put a button on the robot</p>
<p>that you could push and the robot would smile.</p>
<p>And that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So I think you need to think about the question</p>
<p>in the right way.</p>
<p>And robots can be awesomely effective at helping people</p>
<p>feel less isolated, learn more about the home</p>
<p>that they live in, and fill some of those lonely gaps</p>
<p>that we wish we were engaged learning</p>
<p>cool stuff about our world.</p>
<p>Last question.</p>
<p>If you could hang out for a day with a robot</p>
<p>from science fiction, movies, books,</p>
<p>and safely pick its brain for that day, who would you pick?</p>
<p>Data.</p>
<p>From Star Trek.</p>
<p>I think that A, data is really smart.</p>
<p>Data has been through a lot trying</p>
<p>to go and save the galaxy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really interested actually in emotion</p>
<p>and robotics.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;d have a lot to say about that.</p>
<p>Because I believe actually that emotion</p>
<p>plays an incredibly useful role in doing reasonable things</p>
<p>in situations where we have imperfect understanding of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>In social situations when there&rsquo;s imperfect information.</p>
<p>In social situations, also in competitive or dangerous</p>
<p>situations that we have emotion for a reason.</p>
<p>And so that ultimately, my theory</p>
<p>is that as robots get smarter and smarter,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually going to get more emotional.</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t actually survive on pure logic.</p>
<p>Because only a very tiny fraction of the situations</p>
<p>we find ourselves in can be resolved reasonably with logic.</p>
<p>And so I think Data would have a lot to say about that.</p>
<p>And so I could find out whether he agrees.</p>
<p>If you could ask Data one question,</p>
<p>you would get a deep, honest answer to what would you ask.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Captain Picard really like?</p>
<p>OK, I think that&rsquo;s the perfect way to end it.</p>
<p>Colin, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
