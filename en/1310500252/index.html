    <p>The following is a conversation with Norman Namark,</p>
<p>a historian at Stanford specializing in</p>
<p>genocide, war, and empire.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Norman Namark.</p>
<p>Did Stalin believe that communism was good</p>
<p>not just for him, but for the people of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and the people of the world?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, I mean, Stalin believed that, you know,</p>
<p>socialism was the be all and end all of,</p>
<p>you know, human existence.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a true Leninist,</p>
<p>and in Lenin&rsquo;s tradition, this was, you know,</p>
<p>what he believed.</p>
<p>I mean, that set of beliefs didn&rsquo;t exclude</p>
<p>other kinds of things he believed or thought or did.</p>
<p>But, no, the way he defined socialism,</p>
<p>the way he thought about socialism,</p>
<p>you know, he absolutely thought it was in the interest</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union and of the world.</p>
<p>And, in fact, that the world was one day going to go</p>
<p>socialist, in other words.</p>
<p>I think he believed in, eventually,</p>
<p>in the international revolution.</p>
<p>So, given the genocide in the 1930s that you describe,</p>
<p>was Stalin evil, delusional, or incompetent?</p>
<p>Evil, delusional, or incompetent.</p>
<p>Well, you know, evil is one of those words,</p>
<p>you know, which has a lot of kind of religious</p>
<p>and moral connotations.</p>
<p>And, in that sense, yes, I think he was an evil man.</p>
<p>I mean, he, you know, eliminated people</p>
<p>absolutely unnecessarily.</p>
<p>He tortured people, had people tortured.</p>
<p>He was completely indifferent to the suffering of others.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t have carried a wit, you know,</p>
<p>that millions were suffering.</p>
<p>And so, yes, I consider him an evil man.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, historians don&rsquo;t like to.</p>
<p>Use the word evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s a word for moral philosophers,</p>
<p>but I think it certainly fits who he is.</p>
<p>I think he was delusional.</p>
<p>And there is a wonderful historian at Princeton,</p>
<p>a political scientist, actually, named Robert Tucker,</p>
<p>who said he suffered from a paranoid delusional system.</p>
<p>And I always remember that of Tucker&rsquo;s writing</p>
<p>because what Tucker meant is that he was not just paranoid,</p>
<p>meaning, you know, I&rsquo;m paranoid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried you&rsquo;re out to get me, right?</p>
<p>But that he constructed whole plots of people,</p>
<p>whole systems of people who were out to get him.</p>
<p>So, in other words, his delusions were that there were</p>
<p>all of these groups of people out there</p>
<p>who were out to diminish his power</p>
<p>and remove him from his position</p>
<p>and undermine the Soviet Union, in his view.</p>
<p>So, yes, I think he did suffer from delusions.</p>
<p>And this had a huge effect,</p>
<p>because whole groups then were destroyed by his activities,</p>
<p>which he would construct based on these delusions.</p>
<p>He was not incompetent.</p>
<p>He was an extremely competent man.</p>
<p>I mean, I think most of the research that&rsquo;s gone on,</p>
<p>especially since the Stalin archive was opened</p>
<p>at the beginning of the century,</p>
<p>and I think almost every historian who goes in that archive</p>
<p>comes away from that archive</p>
<p>with the feeling of a man who is enormously hardworking,</p>
<p>intelligent, you know, with an acute sense of politics,</p>
<p>a really excellent sense of political rhetoric,</p>
<p>a fantastic editor, you know, in a kind of agitational sense.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a real agitator, right?</p>
<p>And of a, you know, a really hard worker.</p>
<p>I mean, somebody who works from morning till night</p>
<p>a micromanager in some ways.</p>
<p>So his competence, I think, was really extreme.</p>
<p>Now, there were times when that fell down,</p>
<p>you know, times in the 30s, times in the 20s,</p>
<p>times during the war where he made mistakes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if he didn&rsquo;t make any mistakes.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, you look at his stuff,</p>
<p>you know, you look at his archives, you look what he did.</p>
<p>I mean, this is an enormously competent man</p>
<p>who in many, many different areas of his life,</p>
<p>areas of enterprise, because he, you know,</p>
<p>he had this notion that he should know everything</p>
<p>and did know everything.</p>
<p>I remember one archive, it&rsquo;s called, you know,</p>
<p>a kind of folder that I looked at</p>
<p>where he actually went through the wines</p>
<p>that were produced in his native Georgia</p>
<p>and wrote down how much they should make</p>
<p>of each of these wines, you know,</p>
<p>how many barrels they should produce of these wines,</p>
<p>which grapes were better than the other grapes,</p>
<p>sort of correcting, in other words,</p>
<p>what people were putting down there.</p>
<p>So he was, you know, his competence ranged very wide,</p>
<p>or at least he thought his competence ranged very wide.</p>
<p>I mean, both things, I think, are the case.</p>
<p>If we look at this paranoid delusional system,</p>
<p>Stalin was in power for 30 years.</p>
<p>He is, many argue, one of the most powerful men in history.</p>
<p>Did, in his case, absolute power corrupt him</p>
<p>or did it reveal the true nature of the man?</p>
<p>And maybe just in your sense,</p>
<p>as we kind of build around this genocide</p>
<p>of the early 1930s, this paranoid delusional system,</p>
<p>did it get built up over time?</p>
<p>Was it always there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a question of did the genocide,</p>
<p>was that always inevitable, essentially, in this man,</p>
<p>or did power create that?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a great question, and I don&rsquo;t think you can,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can say that it was always</p>
<p>kind of inherent in the man.</p>
<p>I mean, the man without his position and without his power,</p>
<p>you know, wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to accomplish</p>
<p>what he eventually did in the way of murdering people,</p>
<p>you know, and murdering groups of people,</p>
<p>which is what genocide is.</p>
<p>So, you know, I don&rsquo;t, it wasn&rsquo;t sort of in him.</p>
<p>I mean, there were, and again, you know,</p>
<p>the new research has shown that, you know,</p>
<p>he had his childhood was, you know,</p>
<p>not a particularly nasty one.</p>
<p>People used to say, you know, the father beat him up,</p>
<p>and it turns out, actually, it wasn&rsquo;t the father,</p>
<p>it was the mother once in a while.</p>
<p>But basically, you know, he was not</p>
<p>an unusual young Georgian kid or student even.</p>
<p>And, you know, it was the growth of the Soviet system</p>
<p>and him within the Soviet system,</p>
<p>I mean, his own development within the Soviet system,</p>
<p>I think that led, you know, to the kind of mass killing</p>
<p>that occurred in the 1930s.</p>
<p>You know, he essentially achieved complete power</p>
<p>by the early 1930s.</p>
<p>And then as he, as he rolled with it,</p>
<p>as you would say, you know, or people would say,</p>
<p>you know, it increasingly became murderous.</p>
<p>And there was no, you know, there were no checks</p>
<p>and balances, obviously, on that murderous system.</p>
<p>And not only that, you know, people supported it</p>
<p>in the NKVD and elsewhere, he learned</p>
<p>how to manipulate people.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a superb, you know, political manipulator</p>
<p>of those people around him.</p>
<p>And, you know, we have, we&rsquo;ve got new transcripts,</p>
<p>for example, of, you know, police bureau meetings</p>
<p>in the early 1930s.</p>
<p>And you read those things and you read, you know,</p>
<p>he uses humor and he uses sarcasm, especially,</p>
<p>he uses verbal ways to undermine people, you know,</p>
<p>to control their behavior and what they do.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a really, you know, he&rsquo;s a real,</p>
<p>I guess, manipulator is the right word.</p>
<p>And he does it, he does it with, you know,</p>
<p>a kind of skill that on the one hand is admirable.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, of course, is terrible</p>
<p>because it ends up, you know, creating the system</p>
<p>of terror that he creates.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess just to linger on it,</p>
<p>I just wonder how much of it is a slippery slope</p>
<p>in the early 20s, 1920s, did he think he was going</p>
<p>to be murdering even a single person,</p>
<p>but thousands and millions?</p>
<p>I just wonder maybe the murder of a single human being</p>
<p>just to get them, you know, because you&rsquo;re paranoid</p>
<p>about them potentially threatening your power,</p>
<p>does that murder then open a door?</p>
<p>And once you open the door,</p>
<p>you become a different human being.</p>
<p>A deeper question here is the soldier Knitsen,</p>
<p>you know, the line between good and evil runs</p>
<p>in every man, are all of us once we commit one murder</p>
<p>in the situation, does that open a door for all of us?</p>
<p>And I guess even the further deeper questions,</p>
<p>how easy it is for human nature to go</p>
<p>on the slippery slope that ends in genocide?</p>
<p>There are a lot of questions in those questions.</p>
<p>And, you know, the slippery slope question</p>
<p>I would answer, I suppose by saying, you know,</p>
<p>Stalin wasn&rsquo;t the most likely successor of Lenin,</p>
<p>there were plenty of others, there were a lot</p>
<p>of political contingencies that emerged in the 1920s</p>
<p>that made it possible for Stalin to seize power.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think of him as, you know,</p>
<p>if you would just know him in 1925,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody would say much less himself</p>
<p>that this was a future mass murderer.</p>
<p>I mean, Trotsky mistrusted him and thought he was,</p>
<p>you know, a mindless bureaucrat.</p>
<p>You know, others were less mistrustful of him,</p>
<p>but, you know, he managed to gain power</p>
<p>in the way he did through this bureaucratic</p>
<p>and political maneuvering that was very successful.</p>
<p>You know, the slippery slope, as it were,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really begin until the 1930s, in my view.</p>
<p>In other words, once he gains complete power</p>
<p>and control of the Politburo,</p>
<p>once the programs that he institutes</p>
<p>of the Five Year Plan and collectivization go through,</p>
<p>once he reverses himself and is able to reverse himself</p>
<p>or reverse the Soviet path, you know,</p>
<p>to give various nationalities their, you know,</p>
<p>their ability to develop their own cultures</p>
<p>and sort of internal politics, once he reverses all that,</p>
<p>you know, you have the Ukrainian famine in 32, 33,</p>
<p>you have the murder of Kirov,</p>
<p>who is one of the leading figures, you know,</p>
<p>in the political system, you have the suicide of his wife,</p>
<p>you have all these things come together in 32, 33</p>
<p>that then, you know, make it more likely,</p>
<p>in other words, that bad things are gonna happen.</p>
<p>And people start seeing that, too, around him.</p>
<p>They start seeing that it&rsquo;s not a slippery slope,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a dangerous, it&rsquo;s a dangerous situation</p>
<p>which is emerging, and some people really understand that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I really do see a differentiation</p>
<p>then between the 20s.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true that Stalin, during the Civil War,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of, you know, good research on that,</p>
<p>you know, shows that he already had some of these</p>
<p>characteristics of being, as it were, murderous</p>
<p>and being, you know, being dictatorial</p>
<p>and pushing people around and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>That was all there, but I don&rsquo;t really see that</p>
<p>as kind of the necessary stage</p>
<p>for the next thing that came, which was the 30s,</p>
<p>which was really terror of the worst sort,</p>
<p>you know, where everybody&rsquo;s afraid for their lives</p>
<p>and most people are afraid for their lives</p>
<p>and their family&rsquo;s lives and where torture</p>
<p>and that sort of thing becomes a common part,</p>
<p>you know, of who, what people had to face.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a different, it&rsquo;s a different world.</p>
<p>And you know, people will argue,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll argue this kind of Lenin, Stalin continuity debate,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s been going on</p>
<p>since I was an undergraduate, right?</p>
<p>That argument, you know, was Stalin the natural</p>
<p>sort of next step from Lenin</p>
<p>or was he something completely different?</p>
<p>Many people will argue, you know,</p>
<p>because of Marxism, Leninism, because of the ideology</p>
<p>that, you know, it was the natural,</p>
<p>it was a kind of natural next step.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>You know, I would tend to lean the other way.</p>
<p>Not absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, I won&rsquo;t make an absolute argument</p>
<p>that what Stalin became had nothing to do with Lenin</p>
<p>and nothing to do with Marxism, Leninism.</p>
<p>It had a lot to do with it.</p>
<p>But you know, he takes it one major step further.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like the slippery slope,</p>
<p>you know, metaphor,</p>
<p>because that means it&rsquo;s kind of slow and easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a leap.</p>
<p>And we call, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>historians talk about the Stalin revolution,</p>
<p>you know, in 28 and 29, you know,</p>
<p>that he, in some senses, creates a whole new system,</p>
<p>you know, through the five year plan,</p>
<p>collectivization and seizing political power</p>
<p>the way he does.</p>
<p>Can you talk about the 1930s?</p>
<p>Can you describe what happened in Holodomor,</p>
<p>the Soviet terror famine in Ukraine</p>
<p>in the 32 and 33?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That killed millions of Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long story, you know,</p>
<p>but let me try to be as succinct as I can be.</p>
<p>I mean, the Holodomor, the terror famine of 32, 33</p>
<p>comes out of, in part, an all union famine</p>
<p>that is the result of collectivization.</p>
<p>You know, collectivization was a catastrophe.</p>
<p>You know, the more or less, the so called kulaks,</p>
<p>the more or less richer farmers,</p>
<p>I mean, they weren&rsquo;t really rich, right?</p>
<p>Anybody with a tin roof and a cow was considered a kulak,</p>
<p>you know, and other people who had nothing</p>
<p>were also considered kulaks if they opposed collectivization.</p>
<p>So these kulaks, we&rsquo;re talking millions of them, right?</p>
<p>And Ukraine, it&rsquo;s worth recalling,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure you know this,</p>
<p>was a, you know, heavily agricultural area,</p>
<p>and Ukrainian peasants, you know,</p>
<p>were in the countryside and resisted collectivization</p>
<p>more than even Russian peasants resisted collectivization,</p>
<p>suffered during this collectivization program.</p>
<p>And they, you know, burned sometimes their own houses,</p>
<p>they killed their own animals,</p>
<p>they were shot, you know, sometimes on the spot,</p>
<p>and tens of thousands and others were sent into exile.</p>
<p>So there was a conflagration in the countryside.</p>
<p>And the result of that conflagration</p>
<p>in Ukraine was terrible famine.</p>
<p>And again, there was famine all over the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>but it was especially bad in Ukraine,</p>
<p>in part because Ukrainian peasants resisted.</p>
<p>Now in 3233, a couple of things happen.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve argued this in my writing,</p>
<p>and, you know, I&rsquo;ve also worked on this,</p>
<p>I continue to work on it, by the way,</p>
<p>with a museum in Kiev that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>about the Holodomor.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re building the museum now,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be a very impressive set of exhibits,</p>
<p>and talk with historians all the time about it.</p>
<p>So what happens in 3233, a couple of things.</p>
<p>First of all, the Stalin develops,</p>
<p>develops an even stronger, I say even stronger,</p>
<p>because they already had an antipathy for the Ukrainians,</p>
<p>an even stronger antipathy for the Ukrainians in general.</p>
<p>First of all, they resist collectivization.</p>
<p>Second of all, he&rsquo;s not getting all the grain he wants</p>
<p>out of them, and which he needs.</p>
<p>And so he sends in, then, people to expropriate the grain,</p>
<p>and take the grain away from the peasants.</p>
<p>These teams of people, you know, some policemen,</p>
<p>some urban thugs, some party people,</p>
<p>some poor peasants, you know, take part too,</p>
<p>go into the villages, and forcibly seize grain</p>
<p>and animals from the Ukrainian peasantry.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re seizing it all over.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s remember again,</p>
<p>this is all over the Soviet Union, in 32, especially.</p>
<p>Then, you know, in December of 1932, January of 33,</p>
<p>February of 33, Stalin has convinced the Ukrainian peasantry</p>
<p>needs to be shown who&rsquo;s boss,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not turning over their grain,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re resisting the expropriators,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re hiding the grain,</p>
<p>which they do sometimes, right?</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re basically not loyal to the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re acting like traitors,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re ready, and he says this, you know,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Kaganovich he says it too,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re ready to kind of pull out</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union and join Poland.</p>
<p>I mean, he thinks Poland is, you know,</p>
<p>out to get Ukraine, and so he&rsquo;s gonna then,</p>
<p>essentially, break the back of these peasantry.</p>
<p>And the way he breaks their back</p>
<p>is by going through another expropriation program,</p>
<p>which is not done in the rest of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s taking away everything they have,</p>
<p>everything they have.</p>
<p>There are new laws introduced,</p>
<p>where they will actually punish people,</p>
<p>including kids, with death, if they steal any grain,</p>
<p>you know, if they take anything from the,</p>
<p>you know, from the fields.</p>
<p>So, you know, you can shoot anybody,</p>
<p>you know, who is looking for food.</p>
<p>And then he introduces measures in Ukraine,</p>
<p>which are not introduced into the rest of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>For example, the Ukrainian peasantry</p>
<p>are not allowed to leave their villages anymore.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t go to the city to try to find some things.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve got pictures of, you know,</p>
<p>Ukrainian peasants dying on the sidewalks</p>
<p>in Kharkiv, and in Kiev, and places like that,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve managed to get out of the village</p>
<p>and get to the cities, but now they can&rsquo;t leave.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t leave Ukraine to go to Belorussia,</p>
<p>or Belarus today, or to Russia, you know, to get any food.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, he won&rsquo;t allow any relief to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Number of people offer relief, including the Poles,</p>
<p>but also the Vatican offers relief.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t allow any relief to Ukraine.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t admit that there&rsquo;s a famine in Ukraine.</p>
<p>And instead, what happens is that Ukraine turns into,</p>
<p>the Ukrainian countryside turns into what my now past</p>
<p>colleague who died several years ago, Robert Conquest,</p>
<p>called a vast Belsen.</p>
<p>And by that, you know, the image is of bodies</p>
<p>just lying everywhere, you know, people dead.</p>
<p>And dying, you know, of hunger, which is, by the way,</p>
<p>I mean, as you know, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>studying genocide, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything worse</p>
<p>than dying of hunger from what I have read.</p>
<p>I mean, you see terrible ways that people die, right?</p>
<p>But dying of hunger is just such a horrible, horrible thing.</p>
<p>And so, for example, we know there were many cases</p>
<p>of cannibalism in the countryside</p>
<p>because there wasn&rsquo;t anything to eat.</p>
<p>People were eating their own kids, right?</p>
<p>And Stalin knew about this.</p>
<p>And again, you know, we started with this question</p>
<p>a little bit earlier, he doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a sign of remorse, not a sign of pity, right?</p>
<p>Not a sign of any kind of human emotion</p>
<p>that normal people would have.</p>
<p>What about the opposite of joy for teaching them a lesson?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s joy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure Stalin really understood</p>
<p>emotion, what joy was, you know.</p>
<p>I think he felt it was necessary to get those SOBs, right?</p>
<p>That they deserved it.</p>
<p>He says that several times, this is their own fault, right?</p>
<p>This is their own fault.</p>
<p>And as their own fault, you know,</p>
<p>they get what they deserve, basically.</p>
<p>How much was the calculation?</p>
<p>How much was it reason versus emotion?</p>
<p>In terms of, you said he was competent.</p>
<p>Was there a long term strategy</p>
<p>or was this strategy based on emotion and anger?</p>
<p>No, I think actually the right answer is a little of both.</p>
<p>I mean, usually the right answer in history</p>
<p>is something like that.</p>
<p>A little of both?</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just, I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>you know, the Soviets had it in for Ukraine</p>
<p>and Ukrainian nationalism, which they really didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And by the way, Russians still don&rsquo;t like it, right?</p>
<p>So they had it in for Ukrainian nationalism.</p>
<p>They feared Ukrainian nationalism.</p>
<p>As I said, you know, Stalin writes, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll lose Ukraine, you know, if these guys win.</p>
<p>You know, so there&rsquo;s a kind of long term determination,</p>
<p>as I said, you know, to kind of break the back</p>
<p>of Ukrainian national identity and Ukrainian nationalism</p>
<p>as any kind of separatist force whatsoever.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s that rational calculation.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think Stalin is annoyed</p>
<p>and peeved and angry on one level</p>
<p>with the Ukrainians for resisting collectivization</p>
<p>and for being difficult and for not conforming, you know,</p>
<p>to the way he thinks peasants should act in this situation.</p>
<p>So you have both things.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also very angry at the Ukrainian party</p>
<p>and eventually purges it for not being able</p>
<p>to control Ukraine and not be able to control the situation.</p>
<p>You know, Ukraine is in theory the bread basket, right?</p>
<p>Of Europe.</p>
<p>Well, how come the bread basket isn&rsquo;t turning over to me</p>
<p>all this grain so I can sell it abroad</p>
<p>and, you know, build new factories</p>
<p>and support the workers in the cities?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of annoyance.</p>
<p>You know, when things fail,</p>
<p>and this is absolutely typical of Stalin,</p>
<p>when things fail, he blames it on other people</p>
<p>and usually groups of people, right?</p>
<p>Not individuals, but groups again.</p>
<p>So a little bit of both I think is the right answer.</p>
<p>This blame, it feels like there&rsquo;s a playbook</p>
<p>that dictators follow.</p>
<p>I just wonder if it comes naturally</p>
<p>or just kind of evolves.</p>
<p>Because, you know, blaming others</p>
<p>and then telling these narratives</p>
<p>and then creating the other</p>
<p>and then somehow that leads to hatred and genocide.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s too many commonalities</p>
<p>for it not to be a naturally emergent strategy</p>
<p>that works for dictatorships.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a very good point.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s one, you know, that has its merits.</p>
<p>In other words, I think you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s certain kinds of strategies</p>
<p>by dictators that, you know, are common to them.</p>
<p>A lot of them do killing, not all of them</p>
<p>of that sort that Stalin did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about Mao and Pol Pot, you know, and Hitler.</p>
<p>And, you know, there is a sort of, as you say,</p>
<p>a kind of playbook for political dictatorship.</p>
<p>Also for, you know, a kind of communist totalitarian way</p>
<p>of functioning, you know?</p>
<p>And that way of functioning was described already</p>
<p>by Hannah Arendt early on</p>
<p>when she wrote The Origins of Totalitarianism.</p>
<p>And she more or less writes the playbook</p>
<p>and Stalin does follow it.</p>
<p>The real question, it seems to me, is to what extent,</p>
<p>you know, and how deep does this go</p>
<p>and how often does it go in that direction?</p>
<p>I mean, you can argue, for example,</p>
<p>I mean, Fidel Castro was not a nice man, right?</p>
<p>He was a dictator, he was a terrible dictator.</p>
<p>But he did not engage in mass murder.</p>
<p>Ho Chi Minh was a dictator, a communist dictator</p>
<p>who grew up, you know, in the communist movement,</p>
<p>went to Moscow, you know, spent time in Moscow in the 30s</p>
<p>and went to find, found the Vietnamese Communist Party.</p>
<p>You know, he was a horrible dictator.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he was responsible</p>
<p>for a lot of death and destruction.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t a mass murderer.</p>
<p>And so you get those, you know.</p>
<p>I mean, I would even argue, others will disagree,</p>
<p>that Lenin wasn&rsquo;t a mass murderer.</p>
<p>You know, that he didn&rsquo;t kill the same way,</p>
<p>you know, that Stalin killed.</p>
<p>Or people after him, they&rsquo;re communist dictators too,</p>
<p>after all, Khrushchev, you know, was a communist dictator.</p>
<p>But he stopped this killing.</p>
<p>And, you know, he&rsquo;s still responsible for a gulag</p>
<p>and people sent off into a gulag and imprisonment</p>
<p>and torture and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not at all the same thing.</p>
<p>So there are some, you know, like Stalin, like Mao,</p>
<p>like Pol Pot, you know, who commit these horrible,</p>
<p>horrible atrocities, extensively engaging,</p>
<p>in my view, in genocide.</p>
<p>And there are some who don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And, you know, what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>Well, you know, the difference is partly in personality,</p>
<p>partly in historical circumstance, you know,</p>
<p>partly in who is it that controls the reins of power.</p>
<p>How much do you connect the ideas of communism</p>
<p>or Marxism or socialism to Holodomor, to Stalin&rsquo;s rule?</p>
<p>So how naturally, as you kind of alluded to,</p>
<p>does it lead to genocide?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also, I mean, in some ways,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just addressed that question by saying</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t always lead to genocide.</p>
<p>You know, in the case, again, you know,</p>
<p>Cuba is not pretty, but it didn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>there was no genocide in Cuba.</p>
<p>And same thing in North Vietnam.</p>
<p>You know, even North Korea, as awful as it is,</p>
<p>is a terrible dictatorship, right?</p>
<p>And people&rsquo;s rights are totally destroyed, right?</p>
<p>They have no freedom whatsoever.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not, as far as we know, genocidal.</p>
<p>Who knows whether it could be</p>
<p>or whether if they took over South Korea,</p>
<p>you know, mass murder wouldn&rsquo;t take place</p>
<p>and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But my point is, is that the ideology</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily dictate genocide.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s an ideology, I think,</p>
<p>that makes genocide sometimes too easily possible</p>
<p>given, you know, the way it thinks through history</p>
<p>as being, you know, you&rsquo;re on the right side of history</p>
<p>and some people are on the wrong side of history</p>
<p>and you have to destroy those people</p>
<p>who are on the wrong side of history.</p>
<p>I mean, there is something in, you know, Marxism, Leninism,</p>
<p>which, you know, has that kind of language</p>
<p>and that kind of thinking.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily that way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful historian at Berkeley</p>
<p>named Martin Malia who has written, you know,</p>
<p>wrote a number of books on this subject</p>
<p>and he was very, very, he was convinced</p>
<p>that the ideology itself, you know,</p>
<p>played a crucial role in the murderousness</p>
<p>of the Soviet regime.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not completely convinced.</p>
<p>You know, when I say not completely convinced,</p>
<p>I think you could argue it different ways.</p>
<p>Equally valid, you know, with equally valid arguments.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something about the ideology of communism</p>
<p>that allows you to decrease the value of human life.</p>
<p>Almost like this philosophy, if it&rsquo;s okay to crack</p>
<p>a few eggs to make an omelet.</p>
<p>So maybe that, if you can reason like that,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s easier to take the leap of,</p>
<p>for the good of the country, for the good of the people,</p>
<p>for the good of the world, it&rsquo;s okay to kill a few people.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s where, I wonder about the slippery slope.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, again, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a slippery slope.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>In other words, I think it&rsquo;s dangerous,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t consider, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like Marxism, Leninism any better than the next guy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve lived in plenty of those systems</p>
<p>to know how they can beat people down</p>
<p>and how they can, you know,</p>
<p>destroy human aspirations</p>
<p>and human interaction between people.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not necessarily murderous systems.</p>
<p>They are systems that contain people&rsquo;s autonomy,</p>
<p>that force people into work and labor and lifestyles</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t want to live.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time, you know,</p>
<p>with East Germans and Poles, you know,</p>
<p>who lived in, and even in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>you know, in the post Stalin period,</p>
<p>where people lived lives they didn&rsquo;t want to live,</p>
<p>you know, and didn&rsquo;t have the freedom to choose.</p>
<p>And that was terrifying in and of itself,</p>
<p>but these were not murderous systems.</p>
<p>And they, you know, ascribed to Marxism, Leninism.</p>
<p>So I suppose it&rsquo;s important to draw the line</p>
<p>between mass murder and genocide and mass murder</p>
<p>versus just mass violation of human rights.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And the leap to mass murder, you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>maybe easier in some ideologies than others,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not clear that somehow one ideology</p>
<p>definitely leads to mass murder and not.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I wonder how many factors, what factors,</p>
<p>how much of it is a single charismatic leader?</p>
<p>How much of it is the conflagration</p>
<p>of multiple historical events?</p>
<p>How much of it is just dumb, the opposite of luck?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense where if you look at a moment</p>
<p>in history, predict, looking at the factors,</p>
<p>whether something bad&rsquo;s going to happen here?</p>
<p>When you look at Iraq at when Saddam Hussein</p>
<p>first took power, well, you could,</p>
<p>or you can, you know, go even farther back in history,</p>
<p>would you be able to predict?</p>
<p>So you said, you already kind of answered that</p>
<p>with Stalin saying there&rsquo;s no way you could have predicted</p>
<p>that in the early 20s.</p>
<p>Is that always the case?</p>
<p>You basically can&rsquo;t predict.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much always the case.</p>
<p>In other words, I mean, history is a wonderful,</p>
<p>you know, discipline and way of looking at life</p>
<p>and the world in retrospect, meaning it happened.</p>
<p>It happened.</p>
<p>And we know it happened.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s too easy to say sometimes it happened</p>
<p>because it had to happen that way.</p>
<p>It almost never has to happen that way.</p>
<p>And, you know, things.</p>
<p>So I very much am of the school that emphasizes,</p>
<p>you know, contingency and choice and difference</p>
<p>and different paths and not, you know,</p>
<p>not necessarily a path that has to be followed.</p>
<p>And those, you know, and, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes you can warn about things.</p>
<p>I mean, you can think, well, something&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And usually the way it works,</p>
<p>let me just give you one example.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m thinking about an example right now,</p>
<p>which was the war in Yugoslavia, you know,</p>
<p>which came in the 1990s and eventually</p>
<p>ventuated in genocide in Bosnia.</p>
<p>And, you know, I remember very clearly, you know,</p>
<p>the 1970s and 1980s in Yugoslavia,</p>
<p>and people would say, you know, there&rsquo;s trouble here</p>
<p>and, you know, something could go wrong.</p>
<p>But no one in their wildest imagination</p>
<p>thought that there would be outright war between them all.</p>
<p>Then the outright war happened, genocide happened,</p>
<p>and afterwards people would say, I saw it coming.</p>
<p>You know, so you get a lot of that,</p>
<p>especially with pundits and journalists,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s, I saw it coming, I knew it was happening.</p>
<p>You know, well, I mean, what happens in the human mind,</p>
<p>and it happens in your mind too,</p>
<p>is, you know, you go through a lot of alternatives.</p>
<p>I mean, think about January 6th, you know, in this country,</p>
<p>and all the different alternatives</p>
<p>which people had in their mind,</p>
<p>or before January 6th, you know, after the lost election.</p>
<p>You know, things could have gone in lots of different ways,</p>
<p>and there were all kinds of people</p>
<p>choosing different ways it could have gone,</p>
<p>but nobody really knew how it was going to turn out.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t as smart people really understood</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;d be this kind of cockamamie uprising</p>
<p>on January 6th, you know, that almost,</p>
<p>you know, caused us enormous grief.</p>
<p>So all of these kinds of things in history,</p>
<p>you know, are deeply contingent.</p>
<p>They depend on, you know, factors that we cannot predict,</p>
<p>and, you know, and it&rsquo;s the joy of history that it&rsquo;s open.</p>
<p>You know, you think about how people are now,</p>
<p>I mean, let me give you one more example,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll shut up, but, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the environmental example.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re all threatened, right?</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>We know there&rsquo;s trouble, right?</p>
<p>We know there&rsquo;s gonna be a catastrophe at some point,</p>
<p>but when?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the catastrophe?</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s the nature of the catastrophe?</p>
<p>Everyone says catastrophe.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the nature of it, right, right, right.</p>
<p>Is it gonna be wars because resource constraint?</p>
<p>Is it going to be hunger?</p>
<p>Is it gonna be, like, mass migration of different kinds</p>
<p>that leads to some kind of conflict and immigration,</p>
<p>and maybe it won&rsquo;t be that big of a deal,</p>
<p>and a total other catastrophic event</p>
<p>will completely challenge the entirety</p>
<p>of the human civilization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point, that&rsquo;s my point, that&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>You know, we really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot we do know.</p>
<p>I mean, the warming business and all this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s scientifically there,</p>
<p>but how it&rsquo;s going to play out.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s saying, you know, different things.</p>
<p>And then you get somewhere in 50 years or 60 years,</p>
<p>which I won&rsquo;t see, and people say, aha,</p>
<p>I told you it was gonna be X,</p>
<p>or it was gonna be Y, or it was gonna be Z.</p>
<p>So I just don&rsquo;t think in history you can,</p>
<p>well, you can&rsquo;t predict.</p>
<p>You simply cannot predict what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of when you just look at Hitler in the 30s,</p>
<p>for me, oftentimes when I kind of read different accounts,</p>
<p>it is so often, certainly in the press,</p>
<p>but in general, me just reading about Hitler,</p>
<p>I get the sense, like, this is a clown.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way this person will gain power.</p>
<p>Which one, Hitler or Stalin?</p>
<p>Hitler, Hitler.</p>
<p>No, no, no, with Stalin, you don&rsquo;t get a sense</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a clown, he&rsquo;s a really good executive.</p>
<p>You think, you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll lead to mass murder,</p>
<p>but you think he&rsquo;s going to build a giant bureaucracy,</p>
<p>at least with Hitler, it&rsquo;s like a failed artist</p>
<p>who keeps screaming about stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s gonna, I mean,</p>
<p>you certainly don&rsquo;t think about the atrocities,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s going to gain power,</p>
<p>especially against communism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many other competing forces</p>
<p>that could have easily beat him.</p>
<p>But then, you realize, event after event,</p>
<p>where this clown keeps dancing,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden, he gains more and more power,</p>
<p>and just certain moments in time,</p>
<p>he makes strategic decisions in terms of cooperating</p>
<p>or gaining power over the military,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things that eventually</p>
<p>give him the power.</p>
<p>I mean, this clown is one of the most impactful</p>
<p>in the negative sense human beings in history.</p>
<p>Right, and even the Jews who are there</p>
<p>and are being screamed at and discriminated against,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a series of measures taken against them</p>
<p>incrementally during the course of the 1930s,</p>
<p>and very few who leave.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, some pick up and go and say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting the hell out of here, and some Zionists</p>
<p>try to leave, too, and go to the United States and stuff,</p>
<p>but go to Israel and Palestine at the time,</p>
<p>but, or to Britain or France.</p>
<p>But in general, even the Jews who should have been</p>
<p>very sensitive to what was going on</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really understand the extent of the danger,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really hard for people to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible, in fact, I think.</p>
<p>So most of the time, in that exact situation,</p>
<p>nothing would have happened,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;d be some drama and so on,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;d be there&rsquo;s some bureaucrat,</p>
<p>but every once in a while in human history,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of turn,</p>
<p>and maybe something catalyzes something else,</p>
<p>and just it accelerates to accelerate,</p>
<p>escalates, escalates, and then war breaks out,</p>
<p>or totally, you know, revolutions break out.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Can we go to the big question of genocide?</p>
<p>What is genocide?</p>
<p>What are the defining characteristics of genocide?</p>
<p>Dealing with genocide is a difficult thing</p>
<p>when it comes to the definition.</p>
<p>There is a definition, the December 1948 UN Convention</p>
<p>on the Prep Prevention and Punishment of Genocide</p>
<p>is considered the sort of major document of definition,</p>
<p>in the definitional sense of genocide,</p>
<p>and it emphasizes the intentional destruction</p>
<p>of an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group,</p>
<p>those are the four groups, again, comma, as such.</p>
<p>And what that means, basically,</p>
<p>is destroying the group as a group.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s a kind of beauty in human diversity,</p>
<p>and different groups of people, you know,</p>
<p>Estonians, you know, a tribe of Native Americans,</p>
<p>South African tribes, you know, the Rohingya in Myanmar,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of beauty humanity recognizes</p>
<p>in the distinctiveness of those groups.</p>
<p>You know, this was a notion that emerges really</p>
<p>with Romanticism after the French Revolution,</p>
<p>then the beginning of the 19th century,</p>
<p>with Herder, mostly.</p>
<p>And this beauty of these groups, then,</p>
<p>you know, is what is under attack in genocide.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s with intent, you know,</p>
<p>the idea is that it&rsquo;s intentional destruction.</p>
<p>So this is a kind of, you know,</p>
<p>analogy to first degree, second degree,</p>
<p>and third degree murder, right?</p>
<p>First degree murder, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out to kill this person, and you plan it,</p>
<p>and you go out, and you do it, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s intent, right?</p>
<p>Manslaughter is not intent.</p>
<p>You end up doing the same thing, but it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>So, you know, the major person behind the definitions,</p>
<p>a man named Raphael Lemkin, I don&rsquo;t know if you heard</p>
<p>his name or not, but he was a Polish Jewish jurist</p>
<p>who came, you know, from Poland,</p>
<p>came to the United States during the war,</p>
<p>and had been a kind of crusader for recognizing genocide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a word that he created, by the way,</p>
<p>and he coined the term in 1943,</p>
<p>and then published it in 1944 for the first time.</p>
<p>Geno, meaning people, and side, meaning killing, right?</p>
<p>And so Lemkin then had this term,</p>
<p>and he pushed hard to have it recognized,</p>
<p>and it was in the UN Convention.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the rough definition.</p>
<p>The problem with it is the definition,</p>
<p>the problems with the definition are several.</p>
<p>You know, one of them is, is it just these four groups?</p>
<p>You know, racial, religious, ethnic, or national?</p>
<p>See, this comes right out of the war.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s in people&rsquo;s minds in 1948 are Jews,</p>
<p>Poles, Russians, Yugoslavs sometimes,</p>
<p>who were killed by the Nazis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in their mind.</p>
<p>But there are other groups, too, if you think about it,</p>
<p>you know, who are killed,</p>
<p>social groups or political groups.</p>
<p>And that was not allowed in the convention,</p>
<p>meaning for a lot of different reasons,</p>
<p>the Soviets were primary among them.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want other kinds of groups,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say Kulaks, for example, to be considered.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a social group.</p>
<p>Or peasants, which is a social group.</p>
<p>So, or a political group.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s take a group, you know, communists killed</p>
<p>groups of people, but non communists also killed</p>
<p>groups of people in Indonesia in 1965, 66, they killed,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t know exactly,</p>
<p>but roughly 600,000 Indonesian communists.</p>
<p>Well, is that genocide or not?</p>
<p>You know, at my point of view, it is genocide,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s Indonesians killing Indonesians.</p>
<p>And we have the same problem with the Cambodian genocide.</p>
<p>I mean, we talk about a Cambodian genocide,</p>
<p>but most of the people killed in the Cambodian genocide</p>
<p>were other Cambodians.</p>
<p>They give it the name, they&rsquo;re ready to recognize</p>
<p>this genocide because they also killed some other peoples,</p>
<p>meaning the Vietnamese, Aham people who are,</p>
<p>you know, Muslim, smaller Muslim people in the area,</p>
<p>and a few others.</p>
<p>So the question then becomes, well,</p>
<p>does it have to be a different nationality</p>
<p>or ethnic group or religious group for it to be genocide?</p>
<p>And my answer is no.</p>
<p>You know, you need to expand the definition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like with our constitution.</p>
<p>We got a constitution, but we don&rsquo;t live</p>
<p>in the end of the 18th century, right?</p>
<p>We live in the 21st century.</p>
<p>And so you have to update the constitution</p>
<p>over the centuries.</p>
<p>And similarly, the genocide convention needs updating too.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I work with the definition.</p>
<p>So this is this invention.</p>
<p>Was it an invention, this beautiful idea,</p>
<p>romantic idea that there&rsquo;s groups of people</p>
<p>and the group is united by some unique characteristics?</p>
<p>That was an invention in human history, this idea?</p>
<p>Not to see as individuals?</p>
<p>In some senses, it was.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not, you know,</p>
<p>there are things that are always constructed</p>
<p>in one fashion or another and the construction,</p>
<p>you know, more or less represents the reality.</p>
<p>And what the reality is always much more complicated</p>
<p>than the construction or the invention of a term</p>
<p>or a concept or a way of thinking about a nation, right?</p>
<p>And this way of thinking of nations, you know,</p>
<p>as again, you know, groups of religious, linguistic,</p>
<p>not political necessarily, but cultural entities</p>
<p>is something that was essentially invented, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, you know, if you look at&hellip;</p>
<p>There are no Germans in the 17th century.</p>
<p>There are no Italians in the 17th century, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re only there after, you know,</p>
<p>the invention of the nation, which comes again,</p>
<p>mostly out of the French Revolution</p>
<p>and in the Romantic movement,</p>
<p>a man named Johann Gottfried von Herder, right?</p>
<p>Who was really the first one who sort of went around,</p>
<p>collected people&rsquo;s languages and collected their sayings</p>
<p>and their dances and their folkways and stuff</p>
<p>and said, isn&rsquo;t this cool, you know,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re Estonians and that they&rsquo;re Latvians</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re these other,</p>
<p>these interesting different peoples</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t even know necessarily</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re different peoples, right?</p>
<p>That comes a little bit later, right?</p>
<p>Once the concept is invented, then people start to say,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re nations too, you know?</p>
<p>And the Germans decide they&rsquo;re a nation and they unify.</p>
<p>And the Italians discover they&rsquo;re a nation</p>
<p>and they unify instead of being, you know,</p>
<p>Florentines and Romans and, you know, Sicilians.</p>
<p>But then beyond nations, there&rsquo;s political affiliations,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that, you know, you start,</p>
<p>look at the early Homo sapiens</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s obviously tribes, right?</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s very concrete.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a geographic location and it&rsquo;s a small group</p>
<p>of people and you have warring tribes probably connected</p>
<p>to just limited resources.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fascinating to think that that is then taken</p>
<p>to the space of ideas, to where you can create a group</p>
<p>at first to appreciate its beauty.</p>
<p>You create a group based on language,</p>
<p>based on maybe even political, philosophical ideas,</p>
<p>religious ideas, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And then that naturally then leads</p>
<p>to getting angry at groups and making them the other.</p>
<p>And then hatred.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That comes more towards the end of the 19th century,</p>
<p>you know, with the influence of Darwin.</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t blame Darwin for it,</p>
<p>but neo Darwin, Darwinians, you know,</p>
<p>who start to talk about, you know,</p>
<p>the competition between nations, the natural competition,</p>
<p>the weak ones fall away, the strong ones get ahead.</p>
<p>You know, you get this sort of combination also</p>
<p>with, you know, modern antisemitism</p>
<p>and with racial thinking, you know,</p>
<p>the racial thinking at the end of the 19th century</p>
<p>is very powerful.</p>
<p>So now, you know, at the end of the 19th century</p>
<p>versus the beginning of the, you know,</p>
<p>the middle of the 19th century, you know,</p>
<p>you can be a German and be a Jew</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no contradiction.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As long as you speak the language and you, you know,</p>
<p>you dress and think and act and share the culture.</p>
<p>By the end of the 19th century, people saying, no, no,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re not Germans.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re Jews, they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>They have different blood.</p>
<p>They have different, they don&rsquo;t say genes yet,</p>
<p>but you know, that&rsquo;s sort of a sense of people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this sense of superiority too, and inferiority.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, that they&rsquo;re inferior to us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, and that we&rsquo;re the strong ones</p>
<p>and we have to, you know, and Hitler, by the way,</p>
<p>just adopts this hook line and sinker.</p>
<p>I mean, there are a whole series of thinkers</p>
<p>at the end of the 19th and beginning of 20th century</p>
<p>who he cites in Mein Kampf, you know,</p>
<p>which is written in the early 1920s,</p>
<p>that, you know, basically pervades this racial thinking.</p>
<p>So nationalism changes.</p>
<p>So nationalism in and of itself is not bad.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not bad, you know,</p>
<p>to share culture and language and, you know,</p>
<p>folkways and a sense of common belonging.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing bad about it inherently.</p>
<p>But then what happens is it becomes, you know,</p>
<p>frequently is used and becomes, especially on fascism,</p>
<p>becomes dangerous.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s especially dangerous</p>
<p>when the two conflicting groups share geographic location.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So like with Jews, you know, I come, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Russian Jew and it&rsquo;s always interesting.</p>
<p>I take pride in, you know, I love the tradition</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union, of Russia.</p>
<p>I love America.</p>
<p>So I love these countries.</p>
<p>They have beautiful tradition in literature and science</p>
<p>and art and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny that people, not often,</p>
<p>but sometimes correct me that I&rsquo;m not Russian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Jew.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a nice reminder.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That that is always there,</p>
<p>that desire to create these groups.</p>
<p>And then when they&rsquo;re living in the same place</p>
<p>for that division between groups,</p>
<p>that hate between groups can explode.</p>
<p>And I just, I wonder why is that there?</p>
<p>Why does, why does the human heart tend so easily</p>
<p>towards this kind of hate?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a big question in and of itself.</p>
<p>You know, the human heart is full of everything, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of hate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of indifference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of apathy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of energy.</p>
<p>So, I mean, hate is something, you know, that,</p>
<p>I mean, I think, and, you know,</p>
<p>along with hate, you know, the ability to really hurt</p>
<p>and injure people is something that&rsquo;s within all of us.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s within all of us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just something that&rsquo;s part of who we are</p>
<p>and part of our society.</p>
<p>So, you know, we&rsquo;re shaped by our society</p>
<p>and our society can do with us often what it wishes.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so much nicer to live in a</p>
<p>more or less beneficent society</p>
<p>like that of a democracy in the West</p>
<p>than to live in the Soviet Union, right?</p>
<p>I mean, because, you know, you have more or less</p>
<p>the freedom to do what you wish</p>
<p>and not to be forced into situations</p>
<p>in which you would have to then do nasty to other people.</p>
<p>You know, some societies, as we talked about,</p>
<p>you know, are more have proclivities towards,</p>
<p>you know, asking of its people to do things</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to do and forcing them to do so.</p>
<p>So, you know, freedom is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>To be able to choose not to do evil is a great thing,</p>
<p>you know, whereas in some societies, you know,</p>
<p>you feel in some ways for not so much for the NKVD bosses,</p>
<p>but for the guys on the ground, you know, in the 1930s</p>
<p>or not so much for the Nazi bosses,</p>
<p>but for the guys, you know, in the police battalion</p>
<p>that were told, go shoot those Jews, you know?</p>
<p>And you do it, not necessarily because</p>
<p>they force you to do it, but because your social,</p>
<p>you know, your social situation, you know, encourages you to</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have the courage not to.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was just, as I often do,</p>
<p>rereading Viktor Frankl&rsquo;s Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning</p>
<p>and he said something, I just, I often pull out sort of lines.</p>
<p>The mere knowledge that a man was either a camp guard</p>
<p>or a prisoner tells us almost nothing.</p>
<p>Human kindness can be found in all groups,</p>
<p>even those which as a whole, it would be easy to condemn.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s speaking to, you feel for those people</p>
<p>at the lowest level implementing the orders of those above.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And also you worry yourself what will happen</p>
<p>if you were given those same orders, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, what would you do?</p>
<p>You know, what kind of reaction would you have</p>
<p>in a similar situation?</p>
<p>And you know, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I could see myself in World War II</p>
<p>while fighting for almost any country that I was born in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a love of community, there&rsquo;s a love of country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just, at least to me it comes naturally,</p>
<p>just love of community and countries wanting such community.</p>
<p>And I could see fighting for that country,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re sold a story that you&rsquo;re fighting evil</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure every single country</p>
<p>was sold that story effectively.</p>
<p>And then when you&rsquo;re in the military</p>
<p>and you have a gun in your hand</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in the police force and you&rsquo;re ordered,</p>
<p>go to this place and commit violence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to know what you would do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mix of fear, it&rsquo;s a mix of,</p>
<p>maybe you convince yourself, you know,</p>
<p>what can one person really do?</p>
<p>And over time, it&rsquo;s again, that slippery slope.</p>
<p>Because you could see all the people who protest,</p>
<p>who revolt, they&rsquo;re ineffective.</p>
<p>So like, if you actually want to practically help somehow,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to convince yourself that you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>one person can&rsquo;t possibly help.</p>
<p>And then you have a family, so you want to make,</p>
<p>you know, you want to protect your family.</p>
<p>You tell all these stories and over time,</p>
<p>it, you naturally convince yourself to dehumanize the other.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think about this a lot,</p>
<p>mostly because I worry that I wouldn&rsquo;t be a good German.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And one of the, you know, one of my tasks as a teacher,</p>
<p>right, our students, and I have, you know,</p>
<p>classes on genocide, I have one now.</p>
<p>And another one, by the way, on Stalin.</p>
<p>But the one on genocide, you know,</p>
<p>one of my tasks is to try to get the students to understand</p>
<p>this is not about weird people who live far away</p>
<p>in time and in place, but it&rsquo;s about them, you know?</p>
<p>And that, you know, that&rsquo;s a hard lesson,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an important one, you know,</p>
<p>that this is in all of us, you know, it&rsquo;s in all of us.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing, you know,</p>
<p>and you just try to gird yourself up, you know,</p>
<p>to try to figure out ways that maybe you won&rsquo;t be complicit.</p>
<p>And that you learn how to stand by your principles,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very hard, it&rsquo;s extremely difficult.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t, the other interesting thing about it</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not predictable.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;ve done a lot of studies of Poles,</p>
<p>for example, who during the war saved Jews, you know?</p>
<p>Well, who are the Poles who saved Jews</p>
<p>versus those who turned them in?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely unpredictable.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes it&rsquo;s the worst anti Semites</p>
<p>who protect them because they don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>they should be killed, right?</p>
<p>And sometimes, you know, it&rsquo;s not predictable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if the humanists among us, you know,</p>
<p>are the ones who, you know, consistently show up,</p>
<p>you know, and experience danger, in other words,</p>
<p>and are ready to take on danger</p>
<p>to defend, you know, your fellow human beings.</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes simple people do it,</p>
<p>and sometimes they do it for really simple reasons.</p>
<p>And sometimes, people you would expect to do it don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got that mix, and it&rsquo;s just not predictable.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learned in this age of social media</p>
<p>is it feels like the people with integrity</p>
<p>and the ones who would do the right thing</p>
<p>are the quiet ones.</p>
<p>In terms of humanists, in terms of activists,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many points to be gained</p>
<p>of declaring that you would do the right thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the simple, quiet folks.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve seen quite, on a small,</p>
<p>obviously much smaller scale,</p>
<p>just shows of integrity and character.</p>
<p>When there was sacrifice to be made and it was done quietly.</p>
<p>Now, sort of the small heroes, those are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s surprising, but they&rsquo;re often quiet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m distrustful of people</p>
<p>who kind of proclaim that they would do the right thing.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And there are different kinds of integrity, too.</p>
<p>I mean, I edited a memoir of a Polish underground fighter,</p>
<p>member of the underground who was in Majdanek</p>
<p>in the concentration camp at Majdanek.</p>
<p>You know, and it was just an interesting mix</p>
<p>of different kinds of integrity.</p>
<p>You know, on the one hand,</p>
<p>it really bothered him deeply</p>
<p>when Jews were killed or sent to camp</p>
<p>or that sort of thing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he was something of an anti Semite.</p>
<p>You know, he would, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes if Jews were his friends, he would help them.</p>
<p>And if they weren&rsquo;t, sometimes he was really mean to them.</p>
<p>You know, and you could, in their various levels,</p>
<p>you know, a concentration camp is a terrible social experiment</p>
<p>in some ways, right?</p>
<p>But you learn a lot from how people behave.</p>
<p>And what you see is that, you know,</p>
<p>people behave sometimes extraordinarily well</p>
<p>in some situations and extraordinarily poorly in others.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s mixed and you can&rsquo;t predict it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to find consistency.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, I think we claim too much consistency</p>
<p>for the people we study</p>
<p>and the people we think about in the past.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re not consistent any more than we are</p>
<p>consistent, right?</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about human nature here on both sides.</p>
<p>So first, what have you learned about human nature</p>
<p>from studying genocide?</p>
<p>Why do humans commit genocide?</p>
<p>What lessons, first of all, why is a difficult question,</p>
<p>but what insights do you have into humans</p>
<p>that genocide is something that happens in the world?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really big and difficult question, right?</p>
<p>And it has to be parsed, I think,</p>
<p>into different kinds of questions.</p>
<p>You know, why does genocide happen?</p>
<p>You know, which the answer there is frequently political,</p>
<p>meaning, you know, why Hitler ended up killing the Jews.</p>
<p>Well, it had a lot to do with the political history</p>
<p>of Germany and wartime history of Germany, right?</p>
<p>In the 30s, and, you know, it&rsquo;s traceable to then.</p>
<p>No, like you mentioned it yourself,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t imagine Hitler in the mid 20s</p>
<p>turning into anything of the kind of dictator</p>
<p>he ended up being and the kind of murderer,</p>
<p>mass murderer he ended up being.</p>
<p>So, and the same thing goes, by the way,</p>
<p>for Stalin and Soviet Union and Pol Pot.</p>
<p>I mean, these are all essentially political movements</p>
<p>where the polity state is seized, you know,</p>
<p>by a ideological or, you know, party, single party movement</p>
<p>and then is moved in directions</p>
<p>where mass killing takes place.</p>
<p>The other question, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s separate that question out.</p>
<p>The other question is why do ordinary people participate?</p>
<p>Because the fact of the matter is,</p>
<p>just ordering genocide is not enough.</p>
<p>Just saying, you know, go get them is not enough.</p>
<p>There have to be people who will cooperate</p>
<p>and who will do their jobs, you know,</p>
<p>both at the kind of mezzo level,</p>
<p>the middle level of a bureaucracy,</p>
<p>but also at the everyday level.</p>
<p>You know, people who have to pull the triggers</p>
<p>and that kind of thing and, you know,</p>
<p>force people into the gas chamber</p>
<p>and grab people, you know, in Kiev in September 1941</p>
<p>at Babin Yar and push them, you know, towards the ravine</p>
<p>where the machine gunners are gonna shoot them down.</p>
<p>You know, and those are all different questions.</p>
<p>The question of, you know, especially the lower level people</p>
<p>who actually do the killing is a question</p>
<p>which I think we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>which is that within all of us,</p>
<p>you know, is the capability of being murderers</p>
<p>and mass murderers.</p>
<p>I mean, to participate in mass murder.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t call them laws of social psychology,</p>
<p>but the character of social psychology.</p>
<p>You know, we will do it in most cases.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the shocking things that I learned</p>
<p>just a few years ago studying the Holocaust</p>
<p>is that you could pull out.</p>
<p>In other words, if they order a police battalion</p>
<p>to go shoot Jews, you didn&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>
<p>You could pull out.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t gonna, they never killed anybody.</p>
<p>They never executed anybody.</p>
<p>They never even punished people for saying,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m not gonna do that.</p>
<p>So people are doing it voluntarily.</p>
<p>They may not want to do it.</p>
<p>You know, they give them booze to try to, you know,</p>
<p>numb the pain of murder,</p>
<p>because they know there is pain.</p>
<p>I mean, people experience pain when they murder people,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t pull out.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s the character of who we are in the society,</p>
<p>in groups, and we&rsquo;re very, very influenced.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re highly influenced by the groups</p>
<p>in which we operate.</p>
<p>And, you know, who we talk to,</p>
<p>and who our friends are within that group,</p>
<p>and who is the head of the group.</p>
<p>And I mean, you see this even,</p>
<p>I mean, you see it in any group, you know,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in the academy, right, at Stanford,</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s, you know, in a labor union,</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s in a church group in Tennessee,</p>
<p>or wherever, you know, people pay attention to each other,</p>
<p>and they are unwilling, frequently, to say no.</p>
<p>This is wrong.</p>
<p>Even though all of you think it&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, you just don&rsquo;t do that, usually,</p>
<p>especially in societies that are authoritarian,</p>
<p>or totalitarian, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s harder, because there&rsquo;s a backup to it, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the NKVD there, or there&rsquo;s the Gestapo there,</p>
<p>and there are other people there.</p>
<p>So you just, you know, they may not be forcing you to do it,</p>
<p>but your social being, plus this danger in the distance,</p>
<p>you know, you do it.</p>
<p>But then, if you go up the hierarchy,</p>
<p>at the very top, there&rsquo;s a dictator.</p>
<p>Presumably, you know, you go to, like, middle management</p>
<p>to the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The higher you get up there,</p>
<p>the more power you have to change the direction</p>
<p>of the Titanic.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>But nobody seems to do it.</p>
<p>Right, or what happens, and it does happen.</p>
<p>It happens in the German army.</p>
<p>I mean, it happens in the case of the Armenian genocide,</p>
<p>where we know there are governors who said,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m not gonna kill Armenians.</p>
<p>What kind of business is this?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just removed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re removed, and you find a replacement very easily.</p>
<p>So, you know, you do see people who stand up.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s not really predictable who it will be.</p>
<p>I would maintain.</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t done the study of the Armenian governors</p>
<p>who said no.</p>
<p>I mean, the Turkish governors who said no</p>
<p>to the Armenian genocide.</p>
<p>But, you know, there are people who do step aside</p>
<p>every once in a while in the middle level.</p>
<p>And again, they&rsquo;re German generals who say,</p>
<p>wait a minute, what is this business in Poland</p>
<p>when they start to kill Jews or in Belorussia?</p>
<p>And, you know, they&rsquo;re just pushed aside.</p>
<p>You know, if they don&rsquo;t do their job, they&rsquo;re pushed aside.</p>
<p>Or they end up doing it.</p>
<p>And they usually do end up doing it.</p>
<p>What about on the victim side?</p>
<p>So, I mentioned man&rsquo;s search for meaning.</p>
<p>What can we learn about human nature,</p>
<p>the human mind from the victims of genocide?</p>
<p>So, Viktor Frankl talked about the ability</p>
<p>to discover meaning and beauty, even in suffering.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about, you know,</p>
<p>in your studying of genocide</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve learned about human nature?</p>
<p>Well, again, I don&rsquo;t, I have to say,</p>
<p>I come out of the study of genocide</p>
<p>with a very pessimistic view of human nature.</p>
<p>A very pessimistic view.</p>
<p>Even on the victim side?</p>
<p>Even on the victim side.</p>
<p>I mean, the victims will eat their children, right?</p>
<p>Ukrainian case, they have no choice.</p>
<p>You know, the victims will rob each other.</p>
<p>The victims will form hierarchies within victimhood.</p>
<p>So, you see, let me give you an example.</p>
<p>Again, I told you I was working on Majdanek.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, in Majdanek, at a certain point in 42,</p>
<p>a group of Slovak Jews were arrested</p>
<p>and sent to Majdanek.</p>
<p>Those Slovak Jews were a group,</p>
<p>somehow they stuck together, they were very competent,</p>
<p>they were, you know, many of them were businessmen,</p>
<p>they knew each other,</p>
<p>and for a variety of different reasons within the camp.</p>
<p>And again, this shows you the diversity of the camps</p>
<p>and also, you know, these images of black and white</p>
<p>in the camps are not very useful.</p>
<p>They ruled the camp.</p>
<p>I mean, they basically had all the important jobs</p>
<p>in the camp, including jobs like beating other Jews,</p>
<p>and persecuting other Jews, and persecuting other peoples,</p>
<p>which they did.</p>
<p>And this Polish guy who I mentioned to you,</p>
<p>who wrote this memoir, hated them</p>
<p>because of what they were doing to the Poles, right?</p>
<p>And he, you know, he&rsquo;s incensed</p>
<p>because aren&rsquo;t these supposed to be the Untermenschen?</p>
<p>He says, and look what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re treating us, you know, like dirt.</p>
<p>And they do, they treat them like dirt.</p>
<p>So, you know, in this kind of work on Majdanek,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certainly parts of it that, you know,</p>
<p>were inspiring, you know, people helping each other,</p>
<p>people trying to feed each other,</p>
<p>people giving warmth to each other.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some very heroic Polish women</p>
<p>who end up having a radio show called Radio Majdanek,</p>
<p>which they put on every night in the women&rsquo;s camp,</p>
<p>which is, you know, to raise people&rsquo;s spirits.</p>
<p>And they, you know, sing songs</p>
<p>and do all this kind of stuff, you know,</p>
<p>to try to keep themselves from, you know,</p>
<p>the horrors that they&rsquo;re experiencing around them.</p>
<p>And so you do see that, and you do see,</p>
<p>you know, human beings acting in support of each other.</p>
<p>But, you know, I mean, Primo Levi is one of my favorite</p>
<p>writers about the Holocaust and about the camps.</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t think Primo Levi saw anything.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, he had pals, you know,</p>
<p>who he helped and who helped him.</p>
<p>I mean, but he describes this kind of, you know,</p>
<p>terrible inhuman environment,</p>
<p>which no one can escape, really, no one can escape.</p>
<p>He ends up committing suicide too, I think,</p>
<p>because of his sense of, we don&rsquo;t know exactly why,</p>
<p>but probably because of his sense</p>
<p>of what happened in the camp.</p>
<p>I mean, later he goes back to Italy,</p>
<p>becomes a writer and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, especially in the concentration camps,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to find places like Wickel Frankel</p>
<p>where you can say, you know,</p>
<p>I am moved in a positive way, you know, by what happened.</p>
<p>There were cases, there&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>People hung together, they tried to help each other,</p>
<p>but, you know, they were totally, totally caught</p>
<p>in this web of genocide.</p>
<p>See, so there are stories, but the thing is, I have this</p>
<p>sense, maybe it&rsquo;s a hope, that within most,</p>
<p>if not every human heart, there&rsquo;s a kind of, like,</p>
<p>flame of compassion and kindness and love that waits,</p>
<p>that longs to connect with others,</p>
<p>that ultimately en masse overpowers everything else.</p>
<p>If you just look at the story of human history,</p>
<p>the resistance to violence and mass murder and genocide</p>
<p>feels like a force that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And it feels like a force that&rsquo;s more powerful</p>
<p>than whatever the dark momentum that leads to genocide is.</p>
<p>It feels like that&rsquo;s more powerful, it&rsquo;s just quiet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell the story of that little flame</p>
<p>that burns within all of our hearts,</p>
<p>that longing to connect to other human beings.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something also about human nature</p>
<p>and us as storytellers, that we&rsquo;re not very good</p>
<p>at telling the stories of that little flame.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re much better at telling the stories of atrocities.</p>
<p>No, you know, I think maybe I fundamentally</p>
<p>disagree with you, I think maybe I fundamentally,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree that there is that flame.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s just too easily doused.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s too easily goes out in a lot of people.</p>
<p>And I mean, like I say, I come away from this work,</p>
<p>a pessimist.</p>
<p>You know, there is this work by a Harvard psychologist,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m forgetting his name.</p>
<p>Stephen Pinker.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, Stephen Pinker, that shows over time, you know,</p>
<p>and you know, initially I was quite skeptical of the work,</p>
<p>but in the end, I thought he was quite convincing</p>
<p>that over time, the incidence of homicide, you know,</p>
<p>goes down, the incidence of rape goes down,</p>
<p>the incidence of genocide, except for the big blip,</p>
<p>you know, in the middle of the 20th century goes down.</p>
<p>Not markedly, but it goes down generally,</p>
<p>that you know, more than norms, international norms</p>
<p>are changing how we think about this and stuff like that.</p>
<p>I thought he was pretty convincing about that.</p>
<p>But think about, you know, we&rsquo;re modern people.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve advanced so fast in so many different areas.</p>
<p>I mean, we should have eliminated this a long time ago,</p>
<p>a long time ago.</p>
<p>You know, how is it that, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still facing this business of genocide in Myanmar,</p>
<p>in Xinjiang, in, you know, Tigray, in Ethiopia,</p>
<p>you know, the potentials of genocide there.</p>
<p>And all over the world, you know, we still have this thing</p>
<p>that we cannot handle, that we can&rsquo;t deal with.</p>
<p>And, you know, again, you know, electric cars and planes</p>
<p>that fly from here to, you know, Beijing.</p>
<p>Think about the differences between 250 years ago</p>
<p>or 300 years ago and today, but the differences in genocide</p>
<p>are not all that great.</p>
<p>I mean, the incidence has gone down.</p>
<p>I think Pinker has demonstrated, I mean,</p>
<p>there are problems with his methodology,</p>
<p>but on the whole, I&rsquo;m with him on that book.</p>
<p>I thought in the end, it was quite well done.</p>
<p>So, you know, I do not, I have to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an optimist about what this human flame can do.</p>
<p>And, you know, I once, someone once said to me,</p>
<p>when I posed a similar kind of question to a seminar,</p>
<p>a friend of mine at Berkeley once said,</p>
<p>remember original sin, Norman, well, I don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very Catholic and I don&rsquo;t really think</p>
<p>in terms of original sin, but in some ways, you know,</p>
<p>her point is we carry this with us, you know,</p>
<p>we carry with us a really potentially nasty mean streak</p>
<p>that can do harm to other people.</p>
<p>Well, we carry the capacity to love too.</p>
<p>Yes, we do, yes, we do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the deal.</p>
<p>You have a bias in that you have studied</p>
<p>some of the darker aspects of human nature</p>
<p>and human history.</p>
<p>So it is difficult from the trenches, from the muck,</p>
<p>to see a possible sort of way out through love.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not obvious that that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>You mentioned electric cars and rockets and airplanes.</p>
<p>To me, the more powerful thing is Wikipedia, the internet.</p>
<p>Only 50% of the world currently has access to the internet,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s growing in information and knowledge and wisdom,</p>
<p>especially among women in the world.</p>
<p>As that grows, I think it becomes a lot more difficult</p>
<p>if love wins, it becomes a lot more difficult</p>
<p>for somebody like Hitler to take power,</p>
<p>for genocide to occur, because people think,</p>
<p>and the masses, I think, the people have power</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re able to think,</p>
<p>when they can see the full kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>First of all, when they can study your work,</p>
<p>they can know about the fact that genocide happens,</p>
<p>how it occurs, how the promises of great charismatic leaders</p>
<p>lead to great, destructive mass genocide.</p>
<p>And just even studying the fact that the Holocaust happened</p>
<p>for a large number of people is a powerful preventer</p>
<p>of future genocide.</p>
<p>One of the lessons of history is just knowing</p>
<p>that this can happen, learning how it happens,</p>
<p>that normal human beings, leaders that give big promises,</p>
<p>can also become evil and destructive.</p>
<p>The fact, knowing that that can happen</p>
<p>is a powerful preventer of that,</p>
<p>and then you kind of wake up from this haze</p>
<p>of believing everything you hear,</p>
<p>and you learn to just, in your small, local way,</p>
<p>to put more love out there in the world.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s possible, it&rsquo;s not too good,</p>
<p>sort of to push back, it&rsquo;s not so obvious to me</p>
<p>that in the end, I think in the end, love wins.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my intuition, I&rsquo;ve had to put money on it.</p>
<p>I have a sense that this genocide thing</p>
<p>is more and more going to be an artifact of the past.</p>
<p>Well, I certainly hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, I certainly hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And it could be you are, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But the evidence is different.</p>
<p>The evidence is different.</p>
<p>And the capacity of human beings to do evil</p>
<p>to other human beings is repeatedly demonstrated.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s in massacres in Mexico,</p>
<p>or ISIS and the Yazidi Kurds,</p>
<p>or you can just go on and on.</p>
<p>Syria, I mean, look what, I mean,</p>
<p>Syria used to be a country, and now it&rsquo;s been a mass grave,</p>
<p>and people then have left in the millions</p>
<p>for other places.</p>
<p>And you know, I&rsquo;m not saying, you know, I&rsquo;m not saying,</p>
<p>I mean, the Turks have done nice things for the Syrians,</p>
<p>and the Germans welcomed in a million or so,</p>
<p>and actually reasonably absorbed them.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying bad things only happen in the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re good and bad things that happen,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re on the path</p>
<p>to eliminating these bad things,</p>
<p>really bad things from happening.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think we are.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the facts demonstrate it.</p>
<p>I mean, I hope, I hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But I think otherwise, it&rsquo;s just an article of faith.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>You know, which is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to have that article of faith</p>
<p>than to have an article of faith which says,</p>
<p>you know, things should get bad, or things like that.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not just fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only way if you want to build a better future.</p>
<p>So optimism is a prerequisite</p>
<p>for engineering a better future.</p>
<p>So like, okay, so a historian</p>
<p>has to see clearly into the past.</p>
<p>An engineer has to imagine a future</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different from the past,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s better than the past.</p>
<p>Because without that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to be able to build a better future.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of saying,</p>
<p>like you have to consider the facts.</p>
<p>Well, at every single moment in history,</p>
<p>if you allow yourself to be too grounded</p>
<p>by the facts of the past,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to create the future.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the tension that we&rsquo;re living with.</p>
<p>To have a chance, we have to imagine</p>
<p>that the better future is possible.</p>
<p>But one of the ways to do that is to study history.</p>
<p>Which engineers don&rsquo;t do enough of.</p>
<p>They do not.</p>
<p>Which is a real problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real problem.</p>
<p>Or basically a lot of disciplines in science</p>
<p>and so on don&rsquo;t do enough of.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of China from 1958 to 1962,</p>
<p>what was called the Great Leap Forward,</p>
<p>orchestrated by Chairman Mao Zedong</p>
<p>that led to the deaths of tens of millions of people</p>
<p>making it arguably the largest famine in human history?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a terrible set of events</p>
<p>that led to the death.</p>
<p>People will dispute the numbers.</p>
<p>15 million, 17 million, 14 million,</p>
<p>20 million people died in the Great Leap.</p>
<p>Many people say 30, 40, 50 million.</p>
<p>Some people will go that high too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Essentially, Mao and the Communist Party leadership,</p>
<p>but it was mostly Mao&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>decided he wanted to move the country into communism.</p>
<p>And part of the idea of that</p>
<p>was rivalry with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Mao was a good Stalinist,</p>
<p>or at least felt like Stalin</p>
<p>was the right kind of communist leader to have,</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t like Khrushchev at all,</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t like what he thought were Khrushchev&rsquo;s reforms</p>
<p>and also Khrushchev&rsquo;s pretensions</p>
<p>to moving the Soviet Union into communism.</p>
<p>So Khrushchev started talking about giving more power</p>
<p>to the party, less power to the state,</p>
<p>and if you have more power to the party versus the state,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re moving into communism quicker.</p>
<p>So what Mao decided to do was to engage in this vast program</p>
<p>of building what were called people&rsquo;s communes.</p>
<p>And these communes were enormous conglomerations</p>
<p>of essentially collective farms,</p>
<p>and what would happen on those communes</p>
<p>is there would be places for people to eat,</p>
<p>and there would be places for the kids to be raised</p>
<p>in essentially kind of separate homes,</p>
<p>and they would be schooled.</p>
<p>Everybody would turn over their metal,</p>
<p>which was one of the,</p>
<p>actually it turned out to be a terribly negative phenomenon,</p>
<p>their metal pots and pans to be melted to then make steel.</p>
<p>Every of these big communes would all have little steel plants</p>
<p>and they would build steel</p>
<p>and the whole countryside would be transformed.</p>
<p>Well, like many of these sort of,</p>
<p>I mean a true megalomaniac project,</p>
<p>like some of Stalin&rsquo;s projects too.</p>
<p>And this particular project then,</p>
<p>the people had no choice.</p>
<p>They were forced to do this.</p>
<p>It was incredibly dysfunctional for Chinese agriculture</p>
<p>and ended up creating, as you mentioned, a terrible famine</p>
<p>that everybody understood was a famine as a result of this.</p>
<p>I mean, there were also some problems of nature</p>
<p>at the same time and some flooding and bad weather</p>
<p>and that sort of thing, but it was really a manmade famine.</p>
<p>And Mao said at one point, who cares if millions die?</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got millions more left.</p>
<p>I mean, he would periodically say things like this</p>
<p>that showed that like Stalin, he had total indifference</p>
<p>to the fact that people were dying in large numbers.</p>
<p>It led again to cannibalism</p>
<p>and to terrible wastage all over the country</p>
<p>and millions of people died</p>
<p>and there was just no stopping it.</p>
<p>There were people in the party</p>
<p>who began to kind of edge towards telling Mao</p>
<p>this wasn&rsquo;t a great idea and that he should back off,</p>
<p>but he wouldn&rsquo;t back off.</p>
<p>And the result was catastrophe in the countryside</p>
<p>and all these people dying.</p>
<p>And then compounding the problem was the political elite,</p>
<p>which then if peasants would object</p>
<p>or if certain people would say,</p>
<p>no, they&rsquo;d beat the hell out of them.</p>
<p>They would beat people who didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>what they wanted them to do.</p>
<p>So it was really, really a horrific set of events</p>
<p>on the Chinese countryside.</p>
<p>I mean, and people wrote about it.</p>
<p>I mean, we learned about it.</p>
<p>There were people who were keeping track</p>
<p>of what was going on and eventually wrote books about it.</p>
<p>So we have, I mean, we have pretty good documentation,</p>
<p>not so much on the numbers.</p>
<p>Numbers are always a difficult problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m facing this problem, by the way,</p>
<p>this is a little bit separate with the Holodomor,</p>
<p>where Ukrainians are now claiming</p>
<p>11.5 million people died in Holodomor.</p>
<p>And most people assume it&rsquo;s somewhere</p>
<p>in the neighborhood of four million, 4.5 million maybe.</p>
<p>So you have wildly different numbers that come out.</p>
<p>Then we have different kinds of numbers,</p>
<p>as you mentioned too, with the Great Leap Forward.</p>
<p>So it was a huge catastrophe for China</p>
<p>and now only backed off when he had to.</p>
<p>And then revived a little bit</p>
<p>with the Red Guards Movement later on</p>
<p>when he was upset that the bureaucracy</p>
<p>was resisting him a little bit</p>
<p>when it came to the Great Leap.</p>
<p>But he had to back off.</p>
<p>It was such a terrible catastrophe.</p>
<p>So one of the things about numbers</p>
<p>is that you usually talk about deaths,</p>
<p>but with the famine, with starvation,</p>
<p>the thing I often think about</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s impossible to put into numbers</p>
<p>is the number of people</p>
<p>and the degree to which they were suffering.</p>
<p>You know, the number of days spent in suffering.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, oh yeah.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, death is,</p>
<p>death is just one of the consequences of suffering.</p>
<p>To me, it feels like one, two, three years or months</p>
<p>and then years of not having anything to eat is worse.</p>
<p>And those aren&rsquo;t put into numbers often.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And the effect on people long term,</p>
<p>you know, in terms of their mental health,</p>
<p>in terms of their physical health,</p>
<p>their ability to work, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, Ukrainians are working on,</p>
<p>there are people working on this subject now.</p>
<p>You know, the longterm effect of the hunger famine on them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a similar kind of longterm effect</p>
<p>on Chinese peasantry of what happened.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, you&rsquo;re destroying.</p>
<p>Multigenerational.</p>
<p>Yes, multigenerational.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s a really, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>This is a terrible, terrible way to die.</p>
<p>And it lasts a long time.</p>
<p>And sometimes you don&rsquo;t die, you survive,</p>
<p>but you know, in the kind of shape</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t function.</p>
<p>Now your brain&rsquo;s been injured, you know.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a really, these famines are really horrible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So when you talk about genocide,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often talking about murder.</p>
<p>Where do you place North Korea in this discussion?</p>
<p>We kind of mentioned it.</p>
<p>So in the, what is it?</p>
<p>The Arduous March of the 1990s,</p>
<p>where it was mass starvation.</p>
<p>Many people describe mass starvation</p>
<p>going on now in North Korea.</p>
<p>When you think about genocide,</p>
<p>when you think about atrocities going on in the world today,</p>
<p>where do you place North Korea?</p>
<p>So take a step back.</p>
<p>When the, there were all these courts</p>
<p>that were set up for Bosnia and for Rwanda</p>
<p>and for other genocides in the 1990s.</p>
<p>And then the decision was made</p>
<p>by the international community, UN basically,</p>
<p>to set up the International Criminal Court,</p>
<p>which would then try genocide in the more modern period</p>
<p>and the more contemporary period.</p>
<p>And the ICC lists three crimes basically.</p>
<p>The genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes.</p>
<p>And subsumed to crimes against humanity</p>
<p>are a lot of the kinds of things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about with North Korea.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s torture, it&rsquo;s artificial,</p>
<p>sometimes artificial famine or famine,</p>
<p>that is not necessary, right?</p>
<p>Not necessary to have it.</p>
<p>And there are other kinds of, you know,</p>
<p>mass rape and stuff like that.</p>
<p>There are other kinds of things that fit</p>
<p>into the crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of where I think about North Korea</p>
<p>as committing crimes against humanity, not genocide.</p>
<p>And again, remember, genocide is meant to be,</p>
<p>I mean, some people, there&rsquo;s a disagreement</p>
<p>among scholars and jurists about this.</p>
<p>Some people think of genocide as the crime of crimes,</p>
<p>the worst of the three that I just mentioned.</p>
<p>But some think of them as co equal.</p>
<p>And the ICC, the International Criminal Court,</p>
<p>is dealing with them more or less as co equal,</p>
<p>even though we tend to think of genocide as the worst.</p>
<p>So I mean, what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t wanna split hairs.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s sort of morally and ethically unseemly,</p>
<p>you know, the split hairs about what is genocide,</p>
<p>what is the crime against humanity.</p>
<p>You know, this is for lawyers, not for historians.</p>
<p>But terminology wise.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you know, you don&rsquo;t wanna get into that.</p>
<p>Because it, I mean, it happened with Darfur a little bit,</p>
<p>where the Bush administration had declared</p>
<p>that Darfur was a genocide.</p>
<p>And the UN said, no, no, it wasn&rsquo;t genocide,</p>
<p>it was a crime against humanity.</p>
<p>And then, you know, that confused things</p>
<p>versus clarified them.</p>
<p>I mean, we damn well knew what was happening.</p>
<p>People were being killed and being attacked.</p>
<p>And so, you know, on the one hand,</p>
<p>I think the whole concept and the way of thinking</p>
<p>about history using genocide as an important part</p>
<p>of human history is crucial.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t like to, you know,</p>
<p>get involved in the hair splitting,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s genocide and what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So that, you know, North Korea, I tend to think of,</p>
<p>like I said, as committing crimes against humanity</p>
<p>and, you know, forcibly incarcerating people,</p>
<p>torturing them, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>You know, routinely incarcerating, depriving them</p>
<p>of certain kinds of human rights</p>
<p>can be considered a crime against humanity.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think of it in the same way</p>
<p>I think about genocide, which is an attack</p>
<p>on a group of people.</p>
<p>Let me just leave it at that.</p>
<p>What in this, if we think about, if it&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>can we loosely use the term genocide here,</p>
<p>just let&rsquo;s not play games with terminology.</p>
<p>Just bad crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>Of particular interest are the ones</p>
<p>that are going on today still,</p>
<p>because it raises the question to us,</p>
<p>what do people outside of this,</p>
<p>what role do they have to play?</p>
<p>So what role does the United States,</p>
<p>or what role do I, as a human being who has food today,</p>
<p>who has shelter, who has a comfortable life,</p>
<p>what role do I have when I think about North Korea,</p>
<p>when I think about Syria,</p>
<p>when I think about maybe the Uighur population in China?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the role is the same role I have,</p>
<p>which is to teach and to learn</p>
<p>and to get the message out that this is happening,</p>
<p>because the more people who understand it,</p>
<p>the more likely it is that the United States government</p>
<p>will try to do something about it,</p>
<p>within the context of who we are and where we live, right?</p>
<p>And so, I write books, you do shows,</p>
<p>or maybe you write books too, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I do not write books, but I tweet.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s good too.</p>
<p>Ineloquently, but that&rsquo;s not the,</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s not the, yes, so certainly this is true.</p>
<p>And in terms of a voice, in terms of words,</p>
<p>in terms of books, you are, I would say,</p>
<p>a rare example of somebody</p>
<p>that has powerful reach with words.</p>
<p>But I was also referring to actions.</p>
<p>In the United States government, what are the options here?</p>
<p>So, war has costs,</p>
<p>and war seems to be, as you have described,</p>
<p>sort of potentially increase the atrocity, not decrease it.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anything that challenges my hope for the future</p>
<p>is the fact that sometimes we&rsquo;re not powerless to help,</p>
<p>but very close to powerless to help,</p>
<p>because trying to help can often lead to,</p>
<p>in the near term, more negative effects than positive effects.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I mean, the unintended consequences of what we do</p>
<p>can frequently be as bad, if not worse,</p>
<p>than trying to relieve the difficulties</p>
<p>that people are having.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re caught a little bit,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also true, I think, that we can be more forceful.</p>
<p>I think we can be more forceful without necessarily war.</p>
<p>There is this idea of the so called responsibility</p>
<p>to protect, and this was an idea that came up</p>
<p>after Kosovo, which was what, 1999,</p>
<p>and when the Serbs looked like they were going to engage</p>
<p>in a genocidal program in Kosovo,</p>
<p>and it was basically a program of ethnic cleansing,</p>
<p>but it could have gone bad and gotten worse,</p>
<p>not just driving people out, but beginning to kill them.</p>
<p>And the United States and Britain and others intervened.</p>
<p>And Russians were there too, as you probably recall.</p>
<p>And I think correctly, people have analyzed this</p>
<p>as a case in which genocide was prevented or stopped.</p>
<p>In other words, the Serbs were stopped in their tracks.</p>
<p>I mean, some bad things did happen.</p>
<p>We bombed Belgrade and the Chinese embassy</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But it was stopped, and following upon that,</p>
<p>then there was a kind of international consensus</p>
<p>that we needed to do something.</p>
<p>I mean, because of Rwanda, Bosnia,</p>
<p>and the positive example of Kosovo, right?</p>
<p>That genocide did not happen in Kosovo.</p>
<p>I think that argument has been substantiated.</p>
<p>Anyway, and this notion of the,</p>
<p>or this doctrine or whatever,</p>
<p>of the responsibility to protect them</p>
<p>was adopted by the UN in 2005, unanimously.</p>
<p>And what it says is there&rsquo;s a hierarchy of measures</p>
<p>that should be, well, let me take a step back.</p>
<p>It starts with the principle that sovereignty of a country</p>
<p>is not, you don&rsquo;t earn it just by being there</p>
<p>and being your own country.</p>
<p>You have to earn it by protecting your people.</p>
<p>So every, this was all agreed</p>
<p>with all the nations of the UN agreed,</p>
<p>Chinese and Russians too,</p>
<p>that sovereignty is there because you protect your people</p>
<p>against various depredations, right?</p>
<p>Including genocide, crimes against humanity,</p>
<p>forced imprisonment, torture, and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>If you violate that justification for your sovereignty,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re protecting your people,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not protecting them,</p>
<p>the international community has the obligation</p>
<p>to do something about it, all right?</p>
<p>Now, then they have a kind of hierarchy</p>
<p>of things you can do, you know, starting with,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not quoting exactly,</p>
<p>but, you know, starting with kind of push and pull,</p>
<p>you know, trying to convince people,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that, you know, to Myanmar,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that to the Rohingya people, right?</p>
<p>Then it goes down the list, you know,</p>
<p>and you get to sanctions or threatening sanctions</p>
<p>and then sanctions, you know, like we have against Russia,</p>
<p>but you go down the list, right?</p>
<p>You go down the list and eventually</p>
<p>you get to military intervention at the bottom,</p>
<p>which they say is the last thing, you know,</p>
<p>and you really don&rsquo;t wanna do that.</p>
<p>And not only do you not wanna do it,</p>
<p>but it, just as you said, just as you pointed out,</p>
<p>it can have unintended consequences, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll do everything we can short,</p>
<p>you know, of military intervention,</p>
<p>but, you know, if necessary,</p>
<p>that can be undertaken as well.</p>
<p>And so the responsibility to predict, I think,</p>
<p>is, you know, it was not implementable.</p>
<p>Oh, one of the things it says in this last category, right?</p>
<p>The military intervention is that the intervention</p>
<p>cannot create more damage than it relieves, right?</p>
<p>And so for Syria, we came to the conclusion,</p>
<p>you know, that, I mean, the international community</p>
<p>in some ways said this in so many words,</p>
<p>even though the Russians were there, obviously,</p>
<p>we ended up being there and that sort of thing,</p>
<p>but the international community basically said,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s no way you can intervene in Syria.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s just no way without causing more damage,</p>
<p>you know, than you would relieve.</p>
<p>So, you know, in some senses,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the international community is saying</p>
<p>about, you know, Xinjiang and the Uighurs too.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, you can&rsquo;t even imagine</p>
<p>what hell would break loose</p>
<p>if there was some kind of military trouble, you know,</p>
<p>to threaten the Chinese with.</p>
<p>But you can go down that list</p>
<p>with the, you know, the military leadership of Myanmar,</p>
<p>and you can go down that list</p>
<p>with the Chinese Communist Party,</p>
<p>and you can go down the list, you know,</p>
<p>with others who are threatening, you know, with Ethiopia</p>
<p>and what it&rsquo;s doing in Tigray.</p>
<p>And, you know, you can go down that list and start pushing.</p>
<p>I think what happened,</p>
<p>you know, there was more of a willingness in the 90s,</p>
<p>and in, you know, right at the turn of the century,</p>
<p>you know, to do these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And then, you know, when Trump got elected and, you know,</p>
<p>he basically said, you know, America first</p>
<p>and out of the world,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna do any of this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And now Biden has the problem</p>
<p>of trying to rebuild consensus</p>
<p>on how you deal with these kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>
<p>I mean, here I tend to be maybe more of an optimist than you.</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s not impossible</p>
<p>that the international community can, you know,</p>
<p>muster some internal fortitude</p>
<p>and push harder, short of war, you know,</p>
<p>to get the Chinese and to get the, again, Myanmar,</p>
<p>and to get others to kind of back off</p>
<p>of violations of people&rsquo;s rights</p>
<p>the way they are routinely doing it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s in the space of geopolitics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the space of politicians and UN and so on.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about China,</p>
<p>and this is a difficult topic,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many financial interests</p>
<p>that not many voices with power and with money</p>
<p>speak up, speak out against China</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very interesting effect</p>
<p>because it costs a lot for an individual to speak up</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to suffer.</p>
<p>I mean, China just cuts off the market.</p>
<p>Like if you have a product, if you have a company</p>
<p>and you say something negative, China just says, okay,</p>
<p>well then they knock you out of the market.</p>
<p>And so any person that speaks up,</p>
<p>they get shut down immediately financially.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge cost, sometimes millions or billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And so what happens is everybody of consequences,</p>
<p>sort of financially, everybody with a giant platform</p>
<p>is extremely hesitant to speak out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, it&rsquo;s a different kind of hesitation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s financial in nature.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that was always the case.</p>
<p>It seems like in history, people were quiet</p>
<p>because of fear, because of a threat of violence.</p>
<p>Here, there&rsquo;s almost like a self interested</p>
<p>preservation of financial, of wealth.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what to do that.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you can say something there,</p>
<p>like the genocide going on</p>
<p>because people are financially self interested.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I think, I mean, I think the analysis is correct.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only, but it&rsquo;s not only corporations,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the American government</p>
<p>that represents the American people</p>
<p>that also feels compelled not to challenge the Chinese</p>
<p>on human rights issues.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing is it&rsquo;s not just,</p>
<p>you know, I know a lot of people from China</p>
<p>and first of all, amazing human beings</p>
<p>and a lot of brilliant people in China,</p>
<p>they also don&rsquo;t want to speak out</p>
<p>and not because they&rsquo;re sort of quote unquote,</p>
<p>like silenced, but more because they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to also lose financially.</p>
<p>They have a lot of businesses in China.</p>
<p>They, you know, they&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>in fact, the Chinese government and the country</p>
<p>has a very interesting structure</p>
<p>because it has a lot of elements that enable capitalism</p>
<p>within a certain framework.</p>
<p>So you have a lot of very successful companies</p>
<p>and they operate successfully.</p>
<p>And then the leaders of those companies,</p>
<p>many of whom have either been on this podcast,</p>
<p>or want to be on this podcast,</p>
<p>they really don&rsquo;t want to say anything negative</p>
<p>about the government.</p>
<p>And the nature of the fear I sense</p>
<p>is not the kind of fear you would have in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very kind of, it&rsquo;s a mellow,</p>
<p>like why would I speak out when it has a negative effect</p>
<p>on my company, on my family, in terms of finance,</p>
<p>strictly financially.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different problem to solve.</p>
<p>That feels solvable.</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s a money problem.</p>
<p>If you can control the flow of money</p>
<p>where the government has less power</p>
<p>to control the flow of money,</p>
<p>it feels like that&rsquo;s solvable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where capitalism is good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where a free market is good.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s where a lot of people</p>
<p>in the cryptocurrency space,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you follow them,</p>
<p>they kind of say, okay, take the monetary system,</p>
<p>the power to control money away from governments.</p>
<p>Make it a distributed,</p>
<p>like allow technology to help you with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hopeful message there.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of people argue</p>
<p>that kind of Bitcoin and these cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>can help deal with some of these authoritarian regimes</p>
<p>that lead to violations of basic human rights.</p>
<p>If you can control, if you can give the power</p>
<p>to control the money to the people,</p>
<p>you can take that away from governments.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another source of hope</p>
<p>where technology might be able to do something good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something different about the 21st century</p>
<p>than the 20th is there&rsquo;s technology</p>
<p>in the hands of billions of people.</p>
<p>I mean, I have to say,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re a naive when it comes to technology.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not someone who understands technology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s wrong of me to argue with you</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t really spend much time with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like it very much.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m neither a fan nor a connoisseur.</p>
<p>So I just don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>But what human history has shown basically,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a big statement.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna pretend I can tell you</p>
<p>what human history has shown.</p>
<p>But technology, atom bomb,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a perfect example of technology.</p>
<p>What happens when you discover new things?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a perfect example.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on with Facebook now?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolutely perfect example.</p>
<p>And I once went to a lecture by Eric Schmidt</p>
<p>about the future and about all the things</p>
<p>that were gonna happen and all these wonderful things</p>
<p>like you wouldn&rsquo;t have to translate yourself anything,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t have to read a book,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t have to drive a car,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to do this, you don&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>What kind of life is that?</p>
<p>So my view of technology is it&rsquo;s subsumed</p>
<p>to the political, social and moral needs of our day</p>
<p>and should be subsumed to that day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna solve anything by itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be you and me that solve things.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re solved, there are political system</p>
<p>that solve things.</p>
<p>Technology is neutral on one level.</p>
<p>It is simply a human, I mean, they&rsquo;re talking now</p>
<p>about how artificial intelligence is gonna do this</p>
<p>and is gonna do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure there&rsquo;s anything necessarily positive</p>
<p>or negative about it except it does obviously</p>
<p>make work easier and things like that.</p>
<p>I mean, I like email and I like word processing</p>
<p>and all that stuff is great,</p>
<p>but actually solving human relations in and of itself</p>
<p>or international relations or conflict among human beings.</p>
<p>I mean, I see technology as causing as many problems</p>
<p>as it solves and maybe even more.</p>
<p>You know, the kind.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Maybe even more. Maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The question is, so like you said, technology is neutral.</p>
<p>I agree with this.</p>
<p>Technology is a toolkit, is a tool set that enables humans</p>
<p>to have wider reach and more power, the printing press.</p>
<p>The rare reason I can read your books is I would argue,</p>
<p>so first of all, the printing press and then the internet.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, I think, has immeasurable effect on humanity.</p>
<p>Technology is a double edged sword.</p>
<p>It allows bad people to do bad things</p>
<p>and good people to do good things.</p>
<p>It ultimately boils down to the people</p>
<p>and whether you believe the capacity for good</p>
<p>outweighs the capacity of bad.</p>
<p>And so you said that I&rsquo;m naive.</p>
<p>It is true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m naively optimistic.</p>
<p>I would say you&rsquo;re naively cynical about technology.</p>
<p>Here we have one overdressed naive optimist</p>
<p>and one brilliant, but nevertheless,</p>
<p>technologically naive cynic and we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether the capacity for good</p>
<p>or the capacity for evil wins out in the end.</p>
<p>And like we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>the trajectory of human history seems to pivot</p>
<p>in a lot of random seeming moments.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But as a builder of technology, I remain optimistic.</p>
<p>And I should say kind of when you are optimistic,</p>
<p>it is often easy to sound naive.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of that small effect.</p>
<p>Not to linger on specific words,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve noticed that people who kind of are cynical</p>
<p>about the world somehow sound more intelligent.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>The issue is how can you be realistic about the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not optimistic or pessimistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not cynical.</p>
<p>The question is how can you be a realist, right?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Realism depends on a combination of knowledge and wisdom</p>
<p>and good instincts and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we strive for, is a kind of realism.</p>
<p>We both strive for that kind of realism.</p>
<p>But I mean, here&rsquo;s an example I would give you.</p>
<p>What about, again, we&rsquo;ve got this environmental issue,</p>
<p>and technology has created it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s created it.</p>
<p>I mean, the growth of technology,</p>
<p>I mean, we all like to be heated well in our homes,</p>
<p>and we wanna have cars that run quickly and fast on gas.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re all consumers and we all profit from this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, not everybody profits from it,</p>
<p>but we wanna be comfortable.</p>
<p>And technology has provided us with a comfortable life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also provided us with this incredible danger,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s not solving, at least not now.</p>
<p>And it may solve, but it may, it&rsquo;s only,</p>
<p>my view is, you know what&rsquo;s gonna happen?</p>
<p>A horrible catastrophe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only way, it&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>we will direct ourselves</p>
<p>to actually trying to do something about it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the wisdom and the realism</p>
<p>and the sense of purpose, you know, what&rsquo;s her name?</p>
<p>Greta goes blah, blah, blah, something like that</p>
<p>in her last talk about the environmental summit</p>
<p>in Glasgow or whatever it was.</p>
<p>And, you know, we just don&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>unless we&rsquo;re hit upside the head really, really hard.</p>
<p>And then maybe, you know, the business with nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>you know, I think somehow we got hit upside the head</p>
<p>and we realized, oh man, you know,</p>
<p>this could really do it to the whole world.</p>
<p>And so we started, you know, serious arms control stuff.</p>
<p>And, you know, but up to that point, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, there was just something about, you know,</p>
<p>Khrushchev&rsquo;s big bomb, his big hydrogen bomb,</p>
<p>which he exploded in the times,</p>
<p>I think it was the anniversary or something like that.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, just think what we could have done</p>
<p>to each other.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the double edged sword of technology.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree, it&rsquo;s a double edged sword.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people, there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that argue that nuclear weapons is the reason</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t had a World War III.</p>
<p>So nuclear weapons, the mutually assured destruction</p>
<p>leads to a kind of like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve reached a certain level of destructiveness</p>
<p>with our weapons where we were able to catch ourselves,</p>
<p>not to create, like you said, hit really hard.</p>
<p>This is the interesting question about kind of hard,</p>
<p>hard and really hard upside the head.</p>
<p>With the environment, I would argue,</p>
<p>see, we can&rsquo;t know the future,</p>
<p>but I would argue as the pressure builds,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s already, because of this created urgency,</p>
<p>the amount of innovation that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>that sometimes is unrelated to the environment,</p>
<p>but kind of sparked by this urgency,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been humongous, including the work of Elon Musk,</p>
<p>including the work of just,</p>
<p>you could argue that the SpaceX</p>
<p>and the new exploration of space is kind of sparked</p>
<p>by this environmental like urgency.</p>
<p>I mean, connected to Tesla and everything they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with electric vehicles and so on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge amount of innovation</p>
<p>in the space that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I could see the effect of climate change</p>
<p>resulting in more positive innovation</p>
<p>that improves the quality of life across the world</p>
<p>than the actual catastrophic events that we&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>which we cannot even currently predict.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be more extreme weather events.</p>
<p>What does that even mean?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a gradual increase</p>
<p>of the level of water.</p>
<p>What does that even mean in terms of catastrophic events?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be pretty gradual.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be migration.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t predict what that means.</p>
<p>And in response to that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a huge amount of innovators born today</p>
<p>that have dreams and that will build devices and inventions</p>
<p>and from space to vehicles to in the software world</p>
<p>that enable education across the world,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things that will on mass, on average,</p>
<p>increase the quality of life on average across the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not at all obvious that these,</p>
<p>the things that the technologies</p>
<p>that are creating climate change, global warming,</p>
<p>are going to have a negative, net negative effect.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m kind of inspired by the dreamers,</p>
<p>the engineers, the innovators and the entrepreneurs</p>
<p>that build, that wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>see problems in the world and dream</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to be the ones who solve those problems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the human spirit.</p>
<p>And that I&rsquo;m not exactly,</p>
<p>it is true that we need those deadlines.</p>
<p>We need to be freaking out about stuff.</p>
<p>And the reason we need to study history</p>
<p>and the worst of human history is then we can say,</p>
<p>oh shit, this too can happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slap in the face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wake up call that if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>if you get complacent, if you get lazy,</p>
<p>this is going to happen.</p>
<p>And that, listen, there&rsquo;s a lot of really intelligent people,</p>
<p>ambitious people, dreamers.</p>
<p>Skilled dreamers that build solutions</p>
<p>that make sure this stuff doesn&rsquo;t happen anymore.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, I think there&rsquo;s reason to be optimistic</p>
<p>about technology, not in a naive way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an argument to be made in a realistic way</p>
<p>that like with technology, we can build a better future.</p>
<p>And then Facebook is a lesson in the way Facebook</p>
<p>has been done is a lesson how not to do it.</p>
<p>And that lesson serves as a guide</p>
<p>of how to do it better, how to do it right,</p>
<p>how to do it in a positive way.</p>
<p>And the same, every single sort of failed technology</p>
<p>contains within it the lessons of how to do it better.</p>
<p>And I mean, without that,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the source of hope for human civilization?</p>
<p>You know, that, I mean, by way of question,</p>
<p>you have truly studied some of the darkest moments</p>
<p>in human history.</p>
<p>Put on your optimist hat.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>That one.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There are glimmers of it.</p>
<p>Yes, what is your source of hope</p>
<p>for the future of human civilization?</p>
<p>Well, I think it resides in, you know,</p>
<p>some of what you&rsquo;ve been saying,</p>
<p>which is the, in the persistence of this civilization</p>
<p>over time, despite, you know, the incredible setbacks,</p>
<p>you know, two enormous world wars, you know,</p>
<p>the nuclear standoff, the, you know,</p>
<p>the horrible things we&rsquo;re experiencing now</p>
<p>with climate change and migration and stuff like that,</p>
<p>that despite these things, you know,</p>
<p>we are persisting and we are continuing.</p>
<p>And like you say, we&rsquo;re continuing to invent</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re continuing to try to solve these problems.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;re continuing to love as well as hate.</p>
<p>And, you know, that, you know, I&rsquo;m basically,</p>
<p>I mean, I have children and grandchildren</p>
<p>and I think they&rsquo;re gonna be just fine.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not a doom and gloomer, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a Cassandra saying the world is coming to an end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like that at all, you know,</p>
<p>I think that, you know, things will persist.</p>
<p>Another, by the way, source of tremendous optimism</p>
<p>on my part, the kids I teach, you know,</p>
<p>I teach some unbelievably fantastic young people,</p>
<p>you know, who are sort of like you say,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re dreamers and they&rsquo;re problem solvers</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re, I mean, they have enormously humane values</p>
<p>and ways of thinking about the world</p>
<p>and they wanna do good.</p>
<p>You know, if you take the kind of,</p>
<p>I mean, this has probably been true all the way along,</p>
<p>but I mean, the percentage of do gooders,</p>
<p>you know, is really enormously large.</p>
<p>Now, whether they end up working</p>
<p>for some kind of shark law firm or something,</p>
<p>you know, or, you know, that kind of thing,</p>
<p>or whether they end up human rights lawyers</p>
<p>is they all wanna be, right?</p>
<p>You know, is a different kind of question,</p>
<p>but certainly, you know, these young people are talented,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re smart, they have wonderful values,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re energetic, they work hard, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re focused and of course, it&rsquo;s not just Stanford.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s all over the country,</p>
<p>you know, you have young people</p>
<p>who really wanna contribute and they wanna contribute.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true some of them end up,</p>
<p>you know, working to get rich.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s inevitable, right?</p>
<p>But the percentages are actually rather small,</p>
<p>at least at this age, you know,</p>
<p>maybe when they get a mortgage and a family</p>
<p>and that sort of thing, you know,</p>
<p>financial wellbeing will be more important to them.</p>
<p>But right now, you know, you catch this young generation</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fantastic, they&rsquo;re fantastic.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not what they&rsquo;re often portrayed as being,</p>
<p>you know, kind of silly and naive and knee jerk leftists</p>
<p>and that, they&rsquo;re not at all like that.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re really fine young people.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a source of optimism to me too.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to those young people today,</p>
<p>maybe in high school, in college, at Stanford,</p>
<p>maybe to your grandchildren about how to have a career</p>
<p>they can be proud of, have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Pursue careers that are in the public interest,</p>
<p>you know, in one fashion or another</p>
<p>and not just in their interests.</p>
<p>And that would be, I mean, it&rsquo;s not bad to pursue a career</p>
<p>in your own interests.</p>
<p>I mean, as long as it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s useful</p>
<p>and positive for their families or whatever.</p>
<p>But yeah, so I mean, I try to advise kids</p>
<p>to find themselves somehow, you know, find who they wanna be</p>
<p>and what they wanna be and try to pursue it.</p>
<p>And the NGO world is growing, as you know,</p>
<p>and a lot of young people are kind of throwing themselves</p>
<p>into it and, you know, human rights watch</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And, you know, they wanna do that kind of work</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very admirable.</p>
<p>I tend to think that even if you&rsquo;re not working</p>
<p>in human rights, there&rsquo;s a certain way in which</p>
<p>if you live with integrity, I believe that all of us</p>
<p>or many of us have a bunch of moments in our lives</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re posed with a decision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quiet one.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll never be written about or talked about.</p>
<p>But you get to choose whether you, there&rsquo;s a choice</p>
<p>that is difficult to make, it may require sacrifice,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the choice that the best version</p>
<p>of that person would make.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way I can sort of say</p>
<p>how to act with integrity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the very thing that would resist the early days</p>
<p>in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>It sounds dramatic to say, but those little actions.</p>
<p>And I feel like the best you can do</p>
<p>to avoid genocide on scale is for all of us</p>
<p>to live in that way, within those moments,</p>
<p>unrelated potentially to human rights, to anything else,</p>
<p>is to take those actions.</p>
<p>Like I believe that all of us know the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You put it very well.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have done it better myself.</p>
<p>No, no, I agree.</p>
<p>I agree completely that there are, to live with truth,</p>
<p>which is what V√°clav Havel used to say,</p>
<p>this famous Czech dissident talked about living in truth,</p>
<p>but also to live with integrity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really super important.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about love.</p>
<p>What role does love play in this whole thing</p>
<p>in the human condition?</p>
<p>In all of the study of genocide,</p>
<p>it does seem that hardship in moments</p>
<p>brings out the best in human nature</p>
<p>and the best in human nature is expressed through love.</p>
<p>Well, as I already mentioned to you,</p>
<p>I think hardship is not a good thing for,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not the best thing for love.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s better to not have to suffer</p>
<p>and not have to, yes, I think it is.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, you know, as I mentioned to you,</p>
<p>you know, studying concentration camps,</p>
<p>you know, this is not a place for love.</p>
<p>It happens, it happens,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really a place for love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place for rape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place for torture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place for killing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a place for inhuman action one to another,</p>
<p>you know, and also, as I said,</p>
<p>among those who are suffering,</p>
<p>not just between those who are,</p>
<p>and then there are whole gradations,</p>
<p>you know, the same thing in the gulag.</p>
<p>You know, there are gradations all the way</p>
<p>from the criminal prisoners</p>
<p>who beat the hell out of the political prisoners,</p>
<p>you know, who then have others below them</p>
<p>who they beat down, you know,</p>
<p>so everybody&rsquo;s being the hell out of everybody else.</p>
<p>So I would not idealize in any way suffering as,</p>
<p>you know, a source of beauty and love.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t do that at all.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a whole lot better</p>
<p>for people to be relatively prosperous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying super prosperous,</p>
<p>but to be able to feed themselves</p>
<p>and to be able to feed their families</p>
<p>and house their families and take care of themselves,</p>
<p>you know, to foster loving relations between people.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think it&rsquo;s no accident</p>
<p>that, you know, poor families have much worse records</p>
<p>when it comes to crime and things like that, you know,</p>
<p>and also to wife beating and to child abuse</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>I mean, you just, you don&rsquo;t want to be poor and indigent</p>
<p>and not have a roof over your head, be homeless.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t mean, again, you know,</p>
<p>homeless people are mean people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that, you know,</p>
<p>what we want to try to foster in this country</p>
<p>and around the world, and one of the reasons, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m very critical of the Chinese in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>but I mean, we have to remember they pulled that country</p>
<p>out of horrible poverty, right?</p>
<p>And I mean, there&rsquo;s still poor people in the countryside.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still problems, you know,</p>
<p>with want and need among the Chinese people.</p>
<p>But, you know, there were millions and millions of Chinese</p>
<p>who were living at the bare minimum of life,</p>
<p>which is no way to live, you know,</p>
<p>and no way, again, to foster love and compassion</p>
<p>and getting along.</p>
<p>So I want to be clear, I don&rsquo;t speak for history, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving you, there used to be historians,</p>
<p>you know, in the 19th century who really thought</p>
<p>they were speaking for history, you know?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that way at all.</p>
<p>I mean, I understand I&rsquo;m a subjective human being</p>
<p>with my own points of view and my own opinions, but.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember this in this conversation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re, despite the fact that you&rsquo;re brilliant</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve written brilliant books,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just human with an opinion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, yeah, no, no, that&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>And I tell my students that too.</p>
<p>I mean, I make sure they understand</p>
<p>this is not history speaking, you know,</p>
<p>this is me and Norman and I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>and this is what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>I mean, I spent a long time studying history</p>
<p>and have enjoyed it enormously.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;m an individual with my points of view.</p>
<p>And one of them is that I&rsquo;ve developed over time,</p>
<p>is that, you know, human want is a real tragedy for people</p>
<p>and it hurts people and it also causes upheavals</p>
<p>and difficulties and stuff.</p>
<p>So I feel for people, you know, I feel for people in Syria,</p>
<p>I feel for people in, you know, in Ethiopia, in Tigray,</p>
<p>you know, when they don&rsquo;t have enough to eat.</p>
<p>And, you know, what that does, I mean,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t love each other, right?</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t love their kids.</p>
<p>But it does mean that it&rsquo;s harder, you know, to do that.</p>
<p>And to, and&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure, it&rsquo;s obvious to me that it&rsquo;s harder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s suffering, there is suffering.</p>
<p>But the numbers, we&rsquo;ve been talking about deaths,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about suffering,</p>
<p>but the numbers we&rsquo;re not quantifying.</p>
<p>The history that you haven&rsquo;t perhaps been looking at</p>
<p>is all the times that people have fallen in love,</p>
<p>deeply with friends, with romantic love,</p>
<p>the positive emotion that people have felt.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not so sure that amidst the suffering,</p>
<p>those moments of beauty and love can be discovered.</p>
<p>And if we look at the numbers,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure the story is obvious.</p>
<p>That, you know, I mean, again,</p>
<p>I suppose you may disagree with Viktor Frankl.</p>
<p>I may too, maybe depending on the day.</p>
<p>I mean, he says that if there&rsquo;s meaning to this life at all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s meaning to the suffering too,</p>
<p>because suffering is part of life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about accepting the ups and downs,</p>
<p>even when the downs go very low.</p>
<p>And within all of it, finding a source of meaning.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s arguing from the perspective of psychology,</p>
<p>but just this life is an incredible gift,</p>
<p>almost no matter what.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not, it&rsquo;s easy to look at suffering</p>
<p>and think if we just escape the suffering,</p>
<p>it will all be better, but we all die.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s beauty in the whole thing.</p>
<p>And it is true that it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>from all the stories I&rsquo;ve read,</p>
<p>especially in famine and starvation, it&rsquo;s just horrible.</p>
<p>It is horrible suffering.</p>
<p>But I also just want to say that there&rsquo;s love amidst it,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t forget that.</p>
<p>No, no, I don&rsquo;t forget it, I don&rsquo;t forget it.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s from the stories.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want to make that compromise or that trade,</p>
<p>but the intensity of friendship in war,</p>
<p>the intensity of love in war is very high.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of these calculations,</p>
<p>but if you look at the stories,</p>
<p>some of the people I&rsquo;m closest with,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never experienced anything</p>
<p>even close to any of this,</p>
<p>but some of the people I&rsquo;m closest with</p>
<p>is people I&rsquo;ve gone through difficult times with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a society or a group where things are easy.</p>
<p>The intensity of the connection between human beings</p>
<p>is not as strong.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that calculus</p>
<p>because I too agree with you.</p>
<p>I want to have as little suffering in the world as possible,</p>
<p>but we have to remember about the love</p>
<p>and the depth of human connection</p>
<p>and find the right balance there.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s something to what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s clearly something to what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I was just thinking about the Soviet Union</p>
<p>when I lived there and people on the streets</p>
<p>were so mean to one another and they never smiled.</p>
<p>You grew up there?</p>
<p>No, but you were, you&rsquo;re too young to.</p>
<p>No, no, I remember well.</p>
<p>I came here when I was 13, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so anyway, I remember living there</p>
<p>and just how hard people were on each other on the streets.</p>
<p>And when you got inside people&rsquo;s apartments,</p>
<p>when they started to trust you,</p>
<p>the friendships were so intense and so wonderful.</p>
<p>So in that sense, I mean, they did live a hard life,</p>
<p>but there wasn&rsquo;t a food on the table</p>
<p>and there was a roof over their heads.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain line.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain, there are lines.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one line,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of a shading.</p>
<p>And the other story I was thinking of as you were talking</p>
<p>was not a story, it&rsquo;s a history,</p>
<p>a book by a friend of mine</p>
<p>who wrote about love in the camps,</p>
<p>in the refugee camps for Jews in Germany after the war.</p>
<p>So these were Jews who had come mostly from Poland</p>
<p>and some survived the camps,</p>
<p>came from awful circumstances.</p>
<p>And then they were put in these camps,</p>
<p>which were not joyful places.</p>
<p>I mean, they were guarded sometimes by Germans even,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re basically under the British control</p>
<p>and they were trying to get to Israel,</p>
<p>trying to get to Palestine right after the war.</p>
<p>And how many pairs there were, how many people coupled up.</p>
<p>But remember, this is after being in the concentration camp.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not being in the concentration camp.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also being free to, more or less free,</p>
<p>to express their emotions and to be human beings</p>
<p>after this horrible thing which they suffered.</p>
<p>So I wonder whether there&rsquo;s, as you say,</p>
<p>some kind of calculus there where the level of suffering</p>
<p>is such that it&rsquo;s just too much for humans to bear.</p>
<p>And which I would suggest,</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t studied this myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just giving you my point of view,</p>
<p>my off the cuff remarks here.</p>
<p>But it was very inspiring to read about these couples</p>
<p>who had met right in these camps</p>
<p>and started to couple up and get married.</p>
<p>And tried to find their way to Palestine,</p>
<p>which was a difficult thing to do then.</p>
<p>When did you live in Russia and the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your memory of the time?</p>
<p>Well, so a number of different times.</p>
<p>So I went there, I first went there in 69, 70.</p>
<p>Wow. A long time ago.</p>
<p>And then I lived in Leningrad mostly,</p>
<p>but also in Moscow in 1975.</p>
<p>So it was detente time.</p>
<p>But it was also a time of political uncertainty</p>
<p>and also hardship for Russians themselves,</p>
<p>standing in long lines.</p>
<p>I mean, you must remember this for food</p>
<p>and for getting anything was almost impossible.</p>
<p>It was a time when Jews were trying to get out.</p>
<p>In fact, I just talked to a friend of mine from those days</p>
<p>who I helped get out and get to Boston</p>
<p>and the lovely people who had managed to have a good life</p>
<p>in the United States after they left.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t an easy time.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an easy time at all.</p>
<p>I remember people set fire to their doors</p>
<p>and their daughter was persecuted in school</p>
<p>once they declared that they wanted to immigrate</p>
<p>and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So it was a very, it was a lot of antisemitism.</p>
<p>So it was a tough time.</p>
<p>Dissidents hung out with some dissidents</p>
<p>and one guy was actually killed.</p>
<p>We think by the, nobody knows exactly by the KGB,</p>
<p>but his art studio was,</p>
<p>he had a separate studio in Leningrad,</p>
<p>St. Petersburg today, just a small studio</p>
<p>where he did his art and somebody set it on fire.</p>
<p>And we think it was KGB, but you never really know.</p>
<p>And he died in that fire.</p>
<p>So it was not, it was a tough time.</p>
<p>And you knew you were followed,</p>
<p>you knew you were being reported on</p>
<p>as a foreign scholar as I was.</p>
<p>There was a formal exchange between the United States</p>
<p>and the Soviet Union and they let me work in the archives,</p>
<p>but then Ivanov got to work in the physics lab</p>
<p>at Rochester or something like that.</p>
<p>So it was an exchange which sent historians</p>
<p>and literary people and some social scientists to Russia</p>
<p>and they sent all scientists here to grab what they could</p>
<p>from MIT and those places.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s your Russian?</p>
<p>Do you have any knowledge of Russian language</p>
<p>that has helped you to understand?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I can read it fine.</p>
<p>And the speaking comes and goes,</p>
<p>depending on whether I&rsquo;m there or I&rsquo;ve been there recently</p>
<p>or if I spend some time there,</p>
<p>because I really need, you know,</p>
<p>I have Russian friends who speak just Russian.</p>
<p>So, you know, when I&rsquo;m there, I then, you know,</p>
<p>I can communicate pretty well.</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t really write it unfortunately.</p>
<p>I mean, I can, but it&rsquo;s not very good,</p>
<p>but I get along fine in Russia.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your fondest memory of the Soviet Union, of Russia?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>Friends?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s friends, it&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>Was it vodka involved or is it just vodka involved?</p>
<p>Little bit, you know, I&rsquo;m not much of a drinker.</p>
<p>So I would, you know, they&rsquo;d just make fun of me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d make fun of myself and that was easy enough.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like, you know, a heavy drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a lot of that, not a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d done some of that, but I never really enjoyed it</p>
<p>and would get sick and stuff.</p>
<p>But no, it&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>You know, one friend I made in the dormitory, you know,</p>
<p>it was a dormitory for foreigners,</p>
<p>but also Siberians who had come, you know,</p>
<p>to Leningrad to study.</p>
<p>And so I met a couple of guys</p>
<p>and one in particular from Omsk became a wonderful friend.</p>
<p>And we talked and talked and talked outside.</p>
<p>You know, we would go walk outside</p>
<p>because we both knew they were, you know,</p>
<p>people were listening and stuff.</p>
<p>And he would say, well, this is, he was an historian,</p>
<p>you know, and so we would talk history.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d say, well, this was the case, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I said, no, I&rsquo;m sorry, Sasha, it wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>It was, you know,</p>
<p>we think Stalin actually had a role in killing Kirov.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not sure, but he said, no.</p>
<p>I said, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, so, you know, we had these conversations</p>
<p>and he was, what I would,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he would agree with me or not.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re still friends.</p>
<p>So he was a naive, maybe he&rsquo;ll listen to the blog</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll send it to him or something.</p>
<p>He was a kind of naive Marxist, Leninist.</p>
<p>And he thought I was, you know, I was, you know,</p>
<p>I had this capitalist ideology.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d say, what ideology you have?</p>
<p>And I said, I don&rsquo;t have an ideology.</p>
<p>You know, I try to just put together kind of reason</p>
<p>and facts and accurate stories</p>
<p>and try to tell them in that way.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, you must, you know, you&rsquo;re a bourgeois,</p>
<p>you know, this or that.</p>
<p>I said, no, I&rsquo;m really not.</p>
<p>And so we would have these talks</p>
<p>and these kinds of arguments.</p>
<p>And then, I mean, sure enough, you know,</p>
<p>we corresponded for a while</p>
<p>and then he had to stop corresponding</p>
<p>because he became a kind of local official in Omsk.</p>
<p>And he sort of migrated more and more to being a Democrat.</p>
<p>And he was then in the, you know,</p>
<p>democratic movement under Gorbachev</p>
<p>and, you know, in the council of people&rsquo;s deputies,</p>
<p>which they set up, which was, you know,</p>
<p>elected as a Democrat from Omsk</p>
<p>and had a political career through the Yeltsin period.</p>
<p>And once Putin came along, you know, it was over.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t like Putin and, you know,</p>
<p>and Putin didn&rsquo;t like the Yeltsin people, right?</p>
<p>Who were, tried to be, some of them tried to be Democrats.</p>
<p>And Sasha was one who really did.</p>
<p>He just published his memoirs in Russian, by the way,</p>
<p>which are very good, I think.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve been hearing it.</p>
<p>Komanderovkifovlast, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to translate in English, Komanderovkifovlast.</p>
<p>But I mean, I translated it full points once for him.</p>
<p>This is so beautiful.</p>
<p>Like the, do you find that the translation is a problem</p>
<p>or no?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a different language.</p>
<p>Yes, translation is very difficult.</p>
<p>With the Russian language, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the only language I know deeply except English.</p>
<p>And it seems like so much is lost of the pain,</p>
<p>the poetry, the beauty of the people.</p>
<p>And translators are to be treasured and good ones,</p>
<p>to be, I mean, those who do the translations,</p>
<p>when you read things in translation,</p>
<p>sometimes they&rsquo;re quite beautiful,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Russian or Polish or German or anything French.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m actually traveling to Paris</p>
<p>to talk to the famous translators that Dostoevsky told story.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just gonna do a several conversations with them</p>
<p>about like, you could just sometimes just grab</p>
<p>a single sentence and just talk about the translation</p>
<p>in that sense, that&rsquo;s, and also, as you said,</p>
<p>I would love to be a fly on the wall</p>
<p>with some of those friends that you had</p>
<p>because the perspective on history, nonacademic,</p>
<p>sort of without just as human beings is so different</p>
<p>from the United States versus Russia.</p>
<p>When you talk about the way the World War II is perceived</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>History also has, in it, opinion and perspective.</p>
<p>And so sometimes stripping that away is really difficult.</p>
<p>And then I guess that is your job and at its highest form,</p>
<p>that is what you do as a historian.</p>
<p>Well, Norman,</p>
<p>Spasibo bashoi shto sivonya samaya katorini.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your valuable time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly an honor to talk to you</p>
<p>and thank you for taking us through a trip,</p>
<p>through some of the worst parts of human history</p>
<p>and talking about hope and love at the end.</p>
<p>So I really appreciate your time today.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Norman Namark.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Stalin.</p>
<p>A single death is a tragedy.</p>
<p>A million deaths is a statistic.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
