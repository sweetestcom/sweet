    <p>Hey, Kyle, you look a little grifty.</p>
<p>You okay?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m great.</p>
<p>You look half a milli richer today.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like to be half a milli richer?</p>
<p>Jay Kyle, you look like a failed hostage taker.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Laugh it up, boys.</p>
<p>Laugh it up, boys.</p>
<p>Laugh it up, boys.</p>
<p>When you see my other projects drop,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be crying again.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you take yes for an answer, Jay Kyle?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken yes for an answer.</p>
<p>Welcome to the All In podcast</p>
<p>with three miserable, rich bastards</p>
<p>who pull up the ladder behind him.</p>
<p>Do you want to explain why it took us a month</p>
<p>to produce a new episode, Jay Kyle?</p>
<p>What about the, whoa, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Attorney, let me give you guys the TLDR.</p>
<p>Jay Kyle thought the All In pod was his</p>
<p>and then he realized it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If you guys want to go, there we go.</p>
<p>There, I&rsquo;m totally transparent.</p>
<p>I requested, I requested to own 6% more</p>
<p>of the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Back up to the summit.</p>
<p>Back up to when you wanted to kick me off the show.</p>
<p>Back up before that, where we-</p>
<p>Oh my God, are we really doing this?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>Okay, if you want to do it, we do it.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t talk about this for 45 minutes</p>
<p>because what happens-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so boring.</p>
<p>So boring, so boring.</p>
<p>We plan the summit.</p>
<p>Jay Kyle doesn&rsquo;t like how I was concerned</p>
<p>about the summit and I bitched at him</p>
<p>and you know, I was negative to him.</p>
<p>Finish the summit.</p>
<p>Jay Kyle wants to kick me off the show.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Brad Gerstner, Bill Gurley would have higher rates.</p>
<p>Here comes the bullying.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think it was me and Jay Kyle getting into it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It was actually, it started with Friedberg</p>
<p>and Jay Kyle getting into it.</p>
<p>Jay Kyle wanted me off the show.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ll, do I get to explain</p>
<p>the series of events or no?</p>
<p>You wanted me off the show.</p>
<p>True or false, Jay Kyle?</p>
<p>I felt that if Friedberg,</p>
<p>if Friedberg wasn&rsquo;t enjoying his time here</p>
<p>and was going to constantly complain every week</p>
<p>about every detail of why the show is not good,</p>
<p>there was always the option for him</p>
<p>to maybe do half the shows</p>
<p>and have Brad Gerstner do half the shows</p>
<p>or have Bill Gurley or rotate in.</p>
<p>And so if he was going to be miserable all the time</p>
<p>and worried about the show,</p>
<p>I gave him the option to have somebody else take his spot.</p>
<p>Did you or did you not say that this is your show?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the leader and you wanted me off the show.</p>
<p>I never said that.</p>
<p>Nor would I say that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to say that.</p>
<p>You said you could summarily replace any of us.</p>
<p>Effectively, you acted like we all worked for you.</p>
<p>I never said that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your show.</p>
<p>Sax, I don&rsquo;t think Chamath&rsquo;s replaceable,</p>
<p>just for the record, so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>He does think that.</p>
<p>I do not think Chamath&rsquo;s replaceable.</p>
<p>Friedberg, I do think,</p>
<p>I mean, I could pull up the Brad Gerstner episodes.</p>
<p>I think they have slightly more views.</p>
<p>So, but people love you.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll keep you.</p>
<p>But J. Cal told my mom and my wife</p>
<p>that he thought I was replaceable on the show.</p>
<p>Guys, I would like to jump in by just summarizing this</p>
<p>so that we can move on.</p>
<p>So basically what happened was we had an agreement</p>
<p>that it was 25% each.</p>
<p>There was a moment where J. Cal believed</p>
<p>that he deserved more.</p>
<p>We had to sort through a lot of the underlying issues</p>
<p>that caused him to believe that.</p>
<p>We got to a good consensus.</p>
<p>We now have a signed agreement that governs how the show</p>
<p>and other things around the show</p>
<p>and offshoots of the show will work.</p>
<p>We are 25% equal partners, and now we can move on.</p>
<p>So enough of the bitching, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>All good.</p>
<p>And I love you all.</p>
<p>I love you all too.</p>
<p>I love you all too.</p>
<p>To be clear, my position,</p>
<p>I do feel like this needs to be out here,</p>
<p>was if we&rsquo;re gonna make it into a media company,</p>
<p>my request was, listen, I think I own,</p>
<p>I should have 10% more equity</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll go to work every day and do the work</p>
<p>and you guys can just show up.</p>
<p>You guys agreed to that.</p>
<p>And then you guys said, you don&rsquo;t wanna do it.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, fine.</p>
<p>So here we are, we&rsquo;re back at square one.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just get to work.</p>
<p>We just wanna do a pod and we just wanna talk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not gonna be any more summits.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not gonna be any business here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a pod.</p>
<p>I have other events I do.</p>
<p>I have other pods I do.</p>
<p>If I want to get paid, I&rsquo;ll do them over there.</p>
<p>And here, it&rsquo;s just a pod that you see every week.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to talk about markets.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, if you guys want your intros,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 1% each.</p>
<p>Intros, go do it.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>Those are 1% each.</p>
<p>So when you guys are willing to pay me</p>
<p>my 1% additional equity, you get the intros.</p>
<p>And when you want the all in summit 2023,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get an invoice each week from JCal now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get, it&rsquo;s gonna be prorated monthly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be 0.8% equity per month vested.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s so fascinating</p>
<p>that we went through all of this,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Sturm und Drang or whatever,</p>
<p>this like month of non taping.</p>
<p>And, you know, and this like,</p>
<p>all this turmoil in our relationship.</p>
<p>So you could get an extra 1% from us.</p>
<p>2% each, 31%.</p>
<p>I believe I should, just so you know,</p>
<p>I do this for a living.</p>
<p>And if I do extra work, I believe I should.</p>
<p>And if you want me to be the de facto CEO of this,</p>
<p>then I should get a little extra.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want that, so that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>This is just gonna be a project.</p>
<p>We do it every week.</p>
<p>And then all your griffs, whatever, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re spinning out from the production board</p>
<p>or whatever copycat app you&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>you can fucking do as a side grift.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Do the intros, let&rsquo;s get going.</p>
<p>Come on, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, no, there&rsquo;s no, zero intros.</p>
<p>No intros.</p>
<p>Intros are out.</p>
<p>But what about, hey, everybody?</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do a, hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody on the house.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to us.</p>
<p>Is that free for me?</p>
<p>Free for you.</p>
<p>Hey, it&rsquo;s free for you.</p>
<p>You let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Satterthwaite.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And it said, we open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back for episode 84 with me, of course,</p>
<p>the Sultan of Science, the Prince of Panic Attacks,</p>
<p>the Queen of Quinoa himself, David Friedberg.</p>
<p>How are you doing, buddy?</p>
<p>Great to be here.</p>
<p>Great to be here.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>Can you feel the tension?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of tension.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still tension.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a little tension there.</p>
<p>Jekyll and I will be hanging out tomorrow night.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make it.</p>
<p>Have you guys resolved it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m cool with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m cool with Friedberg.</p>
<p>I mean, I bought him dinner.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>He did buy me a wonderful dinner.</p>
<p>Oh my Lord.</p>
<p>After the Warriors game.</p>
<p>Shout out to the Warriors.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And of course, with us is the Rain Man himself,</p>
<p>David Sacks.</p>
<p>How are you doing, buddy?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>You ready to go?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try and deflect this thing onto me.</p>
<p>I was only tangentially involved.</p>
<p>It says the guy who spent 72 hours on-</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I wrote the contract.</p>
<p>You did write the contract.</p>
<p>I wrote a very fair contract so that we can move forward.</p>
<p>Just to be clear.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then you proceeded to break it</p>
<p>in the first 15 minutes by slandering me</p>
<p>and disparaging me, but okay, whatever.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>That was good for ratings.</p>
<p>Good for ratings.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I thought your meme was pretty great.</p>
<p>He did the meme.</p>
<p>The two buttons of the superhero trying to pick.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>And I was like, Jason.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>Making jokes, breaking the non-disparaging clause.</p>
<p>And then of course, the dictator himself,</p>
<p>from some undisclosed location in a European city.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m allowed to say that.</p>
<p>Jamal Thapaliapatiya, welcome back, boys.</p>
<p>Episode 84.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up, boys?</p>
<p>All right, well, since we last convened-</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get it on.</p>
<p>Yes, the All In Summit is finished.</p>
<p>All the episodes have been released,</p>
<p>including Pomerleki yesterday.</p>
<p>And here we go.</p>
<p>The markets are in complete turmoil.</p>
<p>Spy down 21% year to date.</p>
<p>Dow&rsquo;s down 17% year to date.</p>
<p>17% year to date, as Sax has pointed out.</p>
<p>That is not representative of what happened</p>
<p>to GrowthSox at the same time.</p>
<p>And the May CPI went up and it was at 8.6.</p>
<p>We also got to 75 basis point rate hike.</p>
<p>Who wants to start here?</p>
<p>Chamath, I mean, it&rsquo;s markets.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;ll just dump it to you first</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll go around the horn to Sax and then Friedberg.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot to say.</p>
<p>So bear with me for a second.</p>
<p>But the thing that you have to do</p>
<p>before you talk about what is happening now,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably useful to go back.</p>
<p>And you have to really start</p>
<p>at the end of the great financial crisis.</p>
<p>And the reason is there was a bunch of people</p>
<p>coming out of the GFC who confused what the US government</p>
<p>and some European governments were doing.</p>
<p>At the time, there was the risk</p>
<p>of a huge financial contagion.</p>
<p>And so the US stepped in and the Federal Reserve</p>
<p>started to use their balance sheet</p>
<p>to buy toxic assets, right?</p>
<p>And the ECB did that.</p>
<p>And I think Japan did that as well.</p>
<p>Anyways, a bunch of banks did it.</p>
<p>I mean, a bunch of governments did it.</p>
<p>And then there was this body</p>
<p>of pseudoscientists, specific economists</p>
<p>who coined this thing called modern monetary theory,</p>
<p>which basically said, hey, you can keep printing money</p>
<p>and introducing it into the economy</p>
<p>to smooth things out</p>
<p>and to actually drive long-term growth.</p>
<p>And it turns out that a bunch</p>
<p>of government officials fell for it.</p>
<p>And if you fast forward to 2022, so 14 years later,</p>
<p>governments around the world had printed something</p>
<p>to the tune of about 30, 35 odd trillion dollars</p>
<p>of money into the economy that should have never been there.</p>
<p>So the thing to remember is like,</p>
<p>we have not necessarily just been obfuscating</p>
<p>true supply demand in the last six or eight months</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;ve been talking about a recession or inflation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been actually doing it since 2008.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s been building up in the system.</p>
<p>So one of the things that we have to realize</p>
<p>is that all of that money somehow needs to get destroyed</p>
<p>in some way, shape, or form</p>
<p>if the true economic equilibrium is meant to be found.</p>
<p>What is true supply?</p>
<p>What is true demand?</p>
<p>In the absence of government sloshing money around,</p>
<p>trying to prop up things that should not be propped up</p>
<p>or buying votes or all the grifts</p>
<p>that these folks have engaged in</p>
<p>in the last decade and a half have to get undone.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the backdrop.</p>
<p>So if you think about taking $30 trillion</p>
<p>out of the global economy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about almost,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 85 trillion is the world GDP.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost half of an entire year&rsquo;s worth of global GDP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take three years probably</p>
<p>of the slow, meticulous running off of money,</p>
<p>not reintroducing new money.</p>
<p>So it seems like we&rsquo;re at the beginning of the beginning</p>
<p>of something that&rsquo;s gonna be long and drawn out.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s separate from,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s separate from whether we&rsquo;re in a recession</p>
<p>or not, that&rsquo;s just the bear market that we&rsquo;re in, right?</p>
<p>And so you have to look at asset prices today</p>
<p>as a microcosm of a much larger trend</p>
<p>that has to be about fake money pushing asset prices up</p>
<p>and now taking all that fake money out</p>
<p>and finding out what the real price of something is.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t think that takes six months.</p>
<p>So for all the people that were fingers crossed,</p>
<p>hoping that this would be the end of it,</p>
<p>Fed raises 75, we&rsquo;re done with this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna raise 75 more.</p>
<p>I just think that&rsquo;s not how it&rsquo;s probably gonna be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take, you know, 24, 36 months.</p>
<p>That may mean the bottom doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>for another 18 months.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a, we&rsquo;re in for a lot</p>
<p>of choppy market action.</p>
<p>Saks, three asset bubbles, clearly all,</p>
<p>you know, being impacted.</p>
<p>We had stocks, looks like that story was pretty violent.</p>
<p>Then we had crypto, this last two or three weeks</p>
<p>have been absolutely insane in terms of that asset bubble.</p>
<p>And now record high inventories for homes,</p>
<p>record sales are now dipping below the average</p>
<p>of the last 20 years.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing mortgage origination</p>
<p>just absolutely get crushed.</p>
<p>6% mortgages just a couple of months ago,</p>
<p>it was 2.X for some folks.</p>
<p>So when you look at those three asset bubbles,</p>
<p>do you buy Chamaths?</p>
<p>Hey, we&rsquo;re gonna see even more deprecation</p>
<p>in these for another 18 months possibly,</p>
<p>or do you think we&rsquo;ve taken such crazy action,</p>
<p>this has come down so violently</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re now bouncing along the bottom,</p>
<p>bouncing along the bottom or 18 months of more pain?</p>
<p>Well, the stock market, especially gross stocks</p>
<p>may have taken the majority of the carnage,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re right, there are other asset classes.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re gonna see the carnage</p>
<p>start to rotate into those.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right, if you look at residential real estate now,</p>
<p>the prices are at the highest they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>relative to median income.</p>
<p>So I think there are gonna be more shoes to drop.</p>
<p>I just want to build on Chamath&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>about root causes here.</p>
<p>Milton Friedman once said that there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>quite so permanent as a temporary government program.</p>
<p>The temporary government program was quantitative easing.</p>
<p>We had this great recession of 2008</p>
<p>that could have turned into a depression,</p>
<p>they broke the glass in case of emergency,</p>
<p>they started this QE, which is basically</p>
<p>the government&rsquo;s ability to do business</p>
<p>with the government.</p>
<p>And then they broke the glass in case of emergency,</p>
<p>they started this QE, which is basically</p>
<p>the government intervening to buy bonds in the market.</p>
<p>They had never done that before.</p>
<p>And they loaded up their balance sheet.</p>
<p>The crazy thing is that program was still continuing</p>
<p>until last year, why?</p>
<p>I mean, it was like on cruise control.</p>
<p>And so last year-</p>
<p>No, no, no, it was continuing until last month</p>
<p>and countries like Europe are still doing it.</p>
<p>9% inflation in Europe and they&rsquo;re still buying bonds.</p>
<p>Right, so you go back to last year,</p>
<p>the Fed bought 54% of the government&rsquo;s debt</p>
<p>despite the fact that the economy was growing</p>
<p>at like 5% GDP, that it was bouncing back</p>
<p>really strongly from COVID,</p>
<p>that you had the stock market at all time highs.</p>
<p>And yet they were still intervening with this massive QE.</p>
<p>And then when we got the surprise 5.1% inflation print</p>
<p>last summer, they didn&rsquo;t stop QE till the end of Q1.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right, they kept basically printing money</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still going on and that&rsquo;s created</p>
<p>massive distortions in the economy.</p>
<p>Now, so the Fed I would say is the number one culprit here</p>
<p>and J-PAL is the number one culprit,</p>
<p>but the number two culprit is the Biden administration.</p>
<p>And I think Biden did three things very early on</p>
<p>in the first few months of his presidency</p>
<p>to effectively tank his presidency.</p>
<p>Number one, he canceled our energy independence</p>
<p>on his first day in office,</p>
<p>canceling the Keystone Pipeline</p>
<p>and making it much harder to drill.</p>
<p>And of course, energy inflation is the number one factor</p>
<p>in this sort of overall inflation.</p>
<p>Number two, he pushed through that last 2 trillion</p>
<p>of stimulus on straight party lines, the ARP,</p>
<p>the American Rescue Plan, after Larry Summers said,</p>
<p>economists in his own party said,</p>
<p>this is gonna create inflation, don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And then the third thing is,</p>
<p>and no one really talks about this,</p>
<p>is that Biden could have used diplomacy in 2021</p>
<p>to basically find an off-ramp to this Ukraine crisis</p>
<p>before it turned into a full-fledged war.</p>
<p>And if you listen to the economists,</p>
<p>the international development economists</p>
<p>like Jeffrey Sachs,</p>
<p>he basically says that Biden pulled his cabinet and said,</p>
<p>listen, should we negotiate</p>
<p>and compromise with the Russians?</p>
<p>They all said no.</p>
<p>And Biden handed down the order,</p>
<p>we will not compromise with the Russians.</p>
<p>So now we have this massive war in Ukraine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fueling food and energy inflation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna tank his presidency.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even think there was any debate</p>
<p>in his cabinet about this.</p>
<p>We may not be negotiating against Russia,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re enabling them to print</p>
<p>enormous surpluses.</p>
<p>Meaning, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw,</p>
<p>but there was an article today,</p>
<p>Janet Yellen is traveling around</p>
<p>basically convincing folks to not include Russian oil</p>
<p>from a bunch of import bans</p>
<p>so that these Russian oil tankers can be insured.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>So that they can sell this oil</p>
<p>to places like China and India, et cetera.</p>
<p>The ruble&rsquo;s at a five-year high.</p>
<p>The ruble&rsquo;s at a five-year high.</p>
<p>We push for all these sanctions.</p>
<p>Europe gets on board and says,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do it and we&rsquo;re gonna take the lumps.</p>
<p>And then we go around Europe and basically say,</p>
<p>well, we kind of want to fight this proxy war,</p>
<p>but at the same time,</p>
<p>we want to try to fix inflation</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t mean to cause this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s completely disorganized,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>So if you had six minutes in the pool</p>
<p>for when Sachs would blame Biden for the economy, you win.</p>
<p>Well, who do you blame?</p>
<p>Of course the president&rsquo;s responsible.</p>
<p>We talked about quantitative easing starting in 2008.</p>
<p>So that goes over a couple of presidents.</p>
<p>And I guess the question I would have for you, Sachs,</p>
<p>is how much of the spending, the freewheeling spending,</p>
<p>was from the previous administration?</p>
<p>Because it does seem like-</p>
<p>Overspending is a bipartisan problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question about it.</p>
<p>But what-</p>
<p>I just want to make sure that we point that out, yeah.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And Republicans only seem to find their principles</p>
<p>on spending when there&rsquo;s a Democrat in the White House.</p>
<p>I totally get it.</p>
<p>And I would like to see more fiscal responsibility</p>
<p>regardless of which party is in power.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to see the Republicans</p>
<p>be less hypocritical in their principles on this.</p>
<p>But look, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>The economy was bouncing back strongly last year,</p>
<p>and Biden still pushed for this last 2 trillion of spending,</p>
<p>and then 1.2 trillion more on infrastructure.</p>
<p>Thank God we didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And then remember, the 4 trillion to build back better</p>
<p>where Manchin saved them from themselves?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, what would that have looked like?</p>
<p>Freeberg, you haven&rsquo;t spoken yet.</p>
<p>Thoughts on these asset bubbles, I guess,</p>
<p>and then the buying of the bonds</p>
<p>seem completely unnecessary for some period of time.</p>
<p>If we are acting as the 50% plus buyer of bonds,</p>
<p>what kind of distortion does that create in the market?</p>
<p>Because if the government&rsquo;s competing against other people</p>
<p>in the marketplace to buy those bonds,</p>
<p>how could they possibly be priced correctly?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just be very careful about our framing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the US Treasury, which issues bonds</p>
<p>and raises capital on behalf of the US government</p>
<p>for spending programs.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the central bank, the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>And our central bank&rsquo;s job is to, number one,</p>
<p>maintain liquidity in the capital markets</p>
<p>so that businesses can invest in growing their products</p>
<p>and growing their businesses and the economy grows</p>
<p>while not providing too much liquidity</p>
<p>that you end up with inflationary effects.</p>
<p>And inflationary effects means</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s too much money in the market</p>
<p>and you see that money find its way</p>
<p>into escalating prices on different assets.</p>
<p>And the Fed&rsquo;s long-term goal, remember,</p>
<p>is to provide, a stated goal of Jerome Powell</p>
<p>in particular right now, this changes over time,</p>
<p>but generally the intention of the Federal Reserve</p>
<p>is to make liquidity, to make cash available to banks</p>
<p>who ultimately make it available to businesses</p>
<p>in such a way that there&rsquo;s enough cash in the system</p>
<p>that the businesses grow</p>
<p>and that people have capital to invest in growth</p>
<p>while keeping inflation at 2%.</p>
<p>So their long-term target is 2% inflation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>and making sure that there&rsquo;s enough cash</p>
<p>to support economic growth.</p>
<p>So remember last year, you&rsquo;ll remember Stan Druckenmiller</p>
<p>was very public about how insane it was</p>
<p>that the Federal Reserve was still buying bonds.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s one way to introduce cash into the system</p>
<p>is to make cash available as a loan to banks.</p>
<p>And then those, you know,</p>
<p>banks use that money to loan to businesses</p>
<p>and it makes its way through the economy.</p>
<p>Another way is for the Federal Reserve to step in</p>
<p>and actually buy bonds,</p>
<p>freeing up the money that other people</p>
<p>would be otherwise using to buy bonds</p>
<p>to go and invest in other things.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re effectively forcing liquidity into the market</p>
<p>by taking bonds out of the market.</p>
<p>And last summer, or Q2 of last year,</p>
<p>Druckenmiller was pounding the table saying,</p>
<p>guys, the economic indicators on how quickly the markets,</p>
<p>or how quickly the economy is growing</p>
<p>relative to how much inflation there is</p>
<p>indicates that we should stop buying bonds</p>
<p>and we should stop injecting liquidity into the markets.</p>
<p>This makes no sense.</p>
<p>It is nonsensical.</p>
<p>And there was no strong point of view</p>
<p>from the Fed at the time,</p>
<p>other than there was uncertainty</p>
<p>about the bounce back from the recession from COVID.</p>
<p>There was uncertainty about what else was happening</p>
<p>in the economy and yada, yada.</p>
<p>But the numbers, the economic indicators</p>
<p>were showing very clearly</p>
<p>the economy is growing at a robust pace,</p>
<p>low unemployment, and inflation is starting to pick up.</p>
<p>Holy crap, it&rsquo;s time to cool it off.</p>
<p>And the Fed made a judgment call</p>
<p>and their judgment call really kind of was to keep going.</p>
<p>And then we end up</p>
<p>in this massive runaway inflationary problem</p>
<p>where if you keep too much liquidity</p>
<p>in the system for too long, you have inflation,</p>
<p>even if you have economic growth.</p>
<p>And now by pulling the money out of the system</p>
<p>super, super fast,</p>
<p>we reduce the inflationary effects potentially,</p>
<p>but we tank the economy</p>
<p>because now all this money coming out of the market</p>
<p>means people are spending less and buying less</p>
<p>and businesses have less to borrow.</p>
<p>The borrowing costs are high.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s the big vacuum.</p>
<p>Hold on, let me go to Chamath and then Sachs.</p>
<p>I just want to say one thing,</p>
<p>the rate at which we pull the money out,</p>
<p>which has had to be really, really fast</p>
<p>over the last few weeks, can cause a recession.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the biggest concern right now</p>
<p>is will that actually trigger a massive recession or not</p>
<p>that everyone&rsquo;s watching?</p>
<p>So Chamath, I guess one of the things</p>
<p>we need to clarify here is the actual mandate of the Fed.</p>
<p>I was under the understanding</p>
<p>that the Fed really was there</p>
<p>to make sure of maximum employment</p>
<p>and that low interest loans were available</p>
<p>and price stability.</p>
<p>These were the stated goals for a long time.</p>
<p>Not low interest rates.</p>
<p>Capital is available for the economy to grow</p>
<p>at moderate rates without exceeding inflation of 2%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>So maximum employment, price stability</p>
<p>was also in there.</p>
<p>Maximize GDP growth,</p>
<p>because remember, we can&rsquo;t ever pay our debt</p>
<p>if our GDP is not growing</p>
<p>while minimizing, while keeping inflation below 2%.</p>
<p>Chamath, whatever point you want to make, feel free to make.</p>
<p>But also I was just wanting to know from you,</p>
<p>where did the Fed go wrong with their mandate,</p>
<p>if at all here?</p>
<p>Because we do have maximum employment right now,</p>
<p>but we have out of control price stability.</p>
<p>Look, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I think we have to also be sensitive</p>
<p>to the fact that the Fed operates</p>
<p>on a certain class of data.</p>
<p>And that data in the 21st century is pretty pathetic.</p>
<p>Nick, you can probably find this, but there was an article,</p>
<p>I think it was in the New York Times,</p>
<p>that really walked through how CPI is calculated.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a bunch of people that work for the government</p>
<p>that walk around with iPads,</p>
<p>building relationships with local businesses</p>
<p>and all these random places all around the country</p>
<p>and asking them to chit chat for 15 minutes</p>
<p>and do these surveys.</p>
<p>Now, you would have thought that in 2023 or 2022,</p>
<p>what the government would have said to Visa, MasterCard,</p>
<p>American Express, all the payment rails,</p>
<p>the banks and Stripe is,</p>
<p>send me a feed in the following structured way</p>
<p>so that I can actually have</p>
<p>an absolute precise sense of inflation</p>
<p>because inflation really only occurs</p>
<p>when a good or a service trades hands for money.</p>
<p>And you calculate what did that thing trade at</p>
<p>the day before and what does it trade for today.</p>
<p>So you could get an absolute precise sense of it.</p>
<p>Instead, we do this random sampling thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s subjective, humans, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you read this article, your takeaway will be,</p>
<p>oh my God, this is very rickety</p>
<p>and it drives an enormous hammer</p>
<p>that we use to try to manage the economy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>I think you need to buckle your seatbelt</p>
<p>because the next three, four, five months of CPI</p>
<p>will probably be very, very bad.</p>
<p>Seven, eight, 9%.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>There are a handful of components</p>
<p>that have gotten completely runaway.</p>
<p>Number one, the biggest one is rent.</p>
<p>And so rent works on a three month lag.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna reintroduce what the true</p>
<p>owner&rsquo;s equivalent rent is into CPI.</p>
<p>So we can already forecast that CPI going up.</p>
<p>Oil is at 105 bucks a barrel.</p>
<p>Russia is basically trying to break the back of Europe</p>
<p>by now messing with their nat gas supplies.</p>
<p>The German energy minister yesterday</p>
<p>said that if that happens,</p>
<p>it could be a contagion equivalent to Lehman Brothers</p>
<p>with respect to energy.</p>
<p>When you play all of these things out,</p>
<p>what you have is unfortunately rampant runaway costs</p>
<p>that really have no mechanism to get back in check</p>
<p>in the absence of some real governmental changes</p>
<p>or policy on this Ukraine-Russia war,</p>
<p>how we intend to sort of work or cooperate</p>
<p>or fight with China.</p>
<p>All of these things have to get solved.</p>
<p>So in the absence of that,</p>
<p>prices are gonna continue to go up.</p>
<p>And so what does the Fed do?</p>
<p>How does it throw away what little credibility it has left</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s eight and 9% inflation prints</p>
<p>and saying, we think we&rsquo;re done for right now?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So they will overcorrect</p>
<p>because there is just gonna be so much pressure</p>
<p>for them to act.</p>
<p>All roads, I think, lead to lower equity prices.</p>
<p>And I think what David said astutely is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen the first wave,</p>
<p>but now it has to touch all these other areas.</p>
<p>For example, we have gotten totally drunk on debt</p>
<p>as a country.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious places</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve been serving alcohol far too late into the night</p>
<p>is in the financing of all these private equity</p>
<p>leverage buyouts.</p>
<p>Right, these are sketchy companies</p>
<p>that are sort of like teetering on insolvency at times</p>
<p>where private equity comes in,</p>
<p>levers up the balance sheet with debt.</p>
<p>They price it right to the edge of what&rsquo;s legally allowed</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s financeable.</p>
<p>And then they go do it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all assuming the economy continues to grow.</p>
<p>And so if all of a sudden you have some recessionary forces</p>
<p>or prices go up and earnings don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a contagion in the debt markets.</p>
<p>You could have a contagion in the commodity market.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re dealing with some really tough boundary conditions.</p>
<p>I mean, most Americans have most of their net worth</p>
<p>tied up in real estate.</p>
<p>And if we see a 30% correction in real estate,</p>
<p>it could be a real problem,</p>
<p>particularly with rising interest rates,</p>
<p>inability to refinance.</p>
<p>Saks, the dual mandate is, hey, keep inflation 2%</p>
<p>and then keep the unemployment rate reasonable.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>with still so many jobs out there, even with these layoffs.</p>
<p>In fact, one might argue we made too many jobs available</p>
<p>to the point at which people maybe aren&rsquo;t working as much</p>
<p>or just, you know, underworking</p>
<p>and not taking advantage of these amazing jobs out there.</p>
<p>Where do you see this going, Saks, now</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t seem to get inflation under control</p>
<p>and people are looking at their 401ks,</p>
<p>they feel a lot poorer, but is the demand side gone yet?</p>
<p>Have consumers decided, I&rsquo;m not going to buy the next house,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going on this vacation,</p>
<p>$6 gas makes no sense, $7 gas makes no sense,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna go on this weekend excursion, I&rsquo;m staying home.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, consumer confidence</p>
<p>just had the biggest drop, I think, in 40 or 50 years.</p>
<p>If you look at like right track, wrong track polling</p>
<p>for the country, only something like 24%</p>
<p>believes that the country&rsquo;s on the right track right now.</p>
<p>If you poll people, are we in a recession?</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t look at like, you know,</p>
<p>the quarter over quarter growth,</p>
<p>they just look at what they&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>56% of the country says we&rsquo;re already in recession.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 70% Republicans, about 50% Democrats.</p>
<p>So the country is already hurting,</p>
<p>people are already feeling it.</p>
<p>And this is gonna-</p>
<p>Is it psychological, Saks,</p>
<p>or are they actually making decisions now to spend less?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>I mean, you start with the real inflation</p>
<p>and people feel it and they also hear about it in the media</p>
<p>and then they start to adjust their decisions.</p>
<p>And this is the problem with fixing an inflation problem</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s based on expectations.</p>
<p>So once people start to expect inflation,</p>
<p>then businesses have to start operating</p>
<p>as if there&rsquo;s gonna be an inflation rate next year.</p>
<p>So they have to start raising prices</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually very hard</p>
<p>to put the horse back in the barn.</p>
<p>And this is why I think the Fed is probably more likely</p>
<p>to overshoot on raising rates</p>
<p>is because if they really wanna stop inflation now,</p>
<p>they really have to slam on the brakes</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s gonna lead to a recession.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>then we end up with like a chronic</p>
<p>sort of stagflationary situation</p>
<p>where you get lower growth and inflation persists.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bunch of bad options right now.</p>
<p>And I think to the point Freeberg was making earlier,</p>
<p>you know, this Ray Dalio piece</p>
<p>that he just published as a blog on LinkedIn,</p>
<p>he said, look, what you want is a Fed</p>
<p>that is alert at the wheel</p>
<p>and gently applies the accelerator or the brakes</p>
<p>based on what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And instead what we had</p>
<p>is the Fed was asleep at the wheel.</p>
<p>They should have started reacting gently</p>
<p>to inflation last summer.</p>
<p>Instead, they waited nine months</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re slamming on the brakes.</p>
<p>And this is a bunch of bad options.</p>
<p>I think, you know, we are gonna have a recession.</p>
<p>The way this unravels-</p>
<p>Can I just make one suggestion?</p>
<p>I wanna put this out there</p>
<p>because I sent it on our texts</p>
<p>and anyone that&rsquo;s listening in DC,</p>
<p>please think about how we can change</p>
<p>the way the Federal Reserve operates.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>to have humans with subjectivity</p>
<p>applying their subjectivity to a set of,</p>
<p>as Chamath pointed out,</p>
<p>infrequent data that comes in chunks and comes in spurts</p>
<p>and only having a mechanism of changing rates</p>
<p>by 25% each month,</p>
<p>or sorry, 25 basis points once a month.</p>
<p>We should have continuous real-time monitoring</p>
<p>of economic data</p>
<p>and software or AI</p>
<p>or some sort of informed set of models</p>
<p>that should then predict</p>
<p>what inflation and economic growth rates will be</p>
<p>as that data comes in,</p>
<p>react in real time,</p>
<p>and on a daily basis,</p>
<p>we should be adjusting the overnight rate</p>
<p>in a one basis point increment.</p>
<p>So we can have the ability to more quickly,</p>
<p>more efficiently,</p>
<p>and in a higher resolution way-</p>
<p>And smooth, yeah, smooth it out.</p>
<p>A smoother way and a higher resolution way</p>
<p>make these adjustments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s silly that we&rsquo;re still operating the way we did</p>
<p>in a pre-digital age,</p>
<p>as it is with a lot of industries</p>
<p>and a lot of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>But in this case, it&rsquo;s particularly prudent</p>
<p>and particularly important and relevant,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re seeing right now</p>
<p>with the stagflation risk that we&rsquo;re facing,</p>
<p>where we could have massive inflation</p>
<p>and recession at the same time.</p>
<p>Because if we had made smaller adjustments every day</p>
<p>for a period of time,</p>
<p>as these economic data indicated</p>
<p>that we should be making them more quickly,</p>
<p>we would not be in this problem.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that having humans and their judgment</p>
<p>should necessarily be the way that we drive this thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but listen,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need them making daily adjustments.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Fed can fine tune an outcome like that.</p>
<p>I just think that they can&rsquo;t be asleep at the wheel</p>
<p>for nine months.</p>
<p>Software could.</p>
<p>I mean, we should have AI running this frigging thing.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>Listen, I actually don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>when you said that Congress needs to somehow change</p>
<p>the way the Fed does business,</p>
<p>I actually think that the Fed has the correct mandate,</p>
<p>which is the dual mandate</p>
<p>of considering inflation and unemployment.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be basically junking that up</p>
<p>by adding a bunch of mandates.</p>
<p>And actually the administration</p>
<p>has been trying to add mandates.</p>
<p>They basically gave the Fed a mandate</p>
<p>around climate change.</p>
<p>They gave them a mandate around equity.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t change the mandate.</p>
<p>It just can&rsquo;t be multivariable.</p>
<p>This would get too complex.</p>
<p>The tools should change.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, we really want a focused Fed.</p>
<p>And I think the administration</p>
<p>has been politicizing the Fed</p>
<p>by giving them a bunch of mandates.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>If you want to pursue those policies, do it at HHS.</p>
<p>Do it in the Interior Department.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t basically confuse the Fed</p>
<p>and make them pursue climate change</p>
<p>or equity or what have you.</p>
<p>I mean, that is just bad.</p>
<p>That is not their remit, right?</p>
<p>Their remit is controlling inflation.</p>
<p>I really think this just comes down to the fact</p>
<p>that for nine months, they sat on their hands</p>
<p>and ignored the inflation evidence.</p>
<p>Remember this word, transitory?</p>
<p>You know, we heard so much last year</p>
<p>about inflation being transitory.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d they know that?</p>
<p>You know, why didn&rsquo;t they start</p>
<p>rethinking this quantitative easing?</p>
<p>The headline from the Wall Street Journal says it all.</p>
<p>How the inflation rate is measured,</p>
<p>477 government workers at grocery stores.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Software should be taking data</p>
<p>from different feeds and software can learn.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with you.</p>
<p>And what are the predictors of inflation</p>
<p>and what are the predictors of growth?</p>
<p>And make a recommendation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with you that it needs to be real time.</p>
<p>In fact, I think it would do more harm than good.</p>
<p>But I do think that we can know these things</p>
<p>without sampling in such a porous way.</p>
<p>And, you know, you can work with private companies</p>
<p>to give you the feed of data to allow you to do it.</p>
<p>And now, you know, we&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>look, we&rsquo;ve had a system of over-correcting</p>
<p>and under-correcting for years.</p>
<p>The problem is the stakes get higher and higher</p>
<p>as the economy grows and becomes more complicated</p>
<p>and intertwined with other economies.</p>
<p>And we have more leverage.</p>
<p>And we have more industries that are leveraged</p>
<p>and more asset classes that are leveraged, like housing.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re off by even a few points,</p>
<p>you could tank everything.</p>
<p>I also want to tell you guys a quick story.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting canaries in the coal mine</p>
<p>of all of this was two days ago</p>
<p>and what happened to Facebook.</p>
<p>And this sort of ties a lot of this stuff together</p>
<p>in terms of like economics, inflation,</p>
<p>asset prices, equities, tech,</p>
<p>we can try to talk about non sort of, you know, big tech.</p>
<p>But everybody was saying,</p>
<p>oh gosh, the market&rsquo;s going to rip on the open.</p>
<p>You know, we were closed for Juneteenth.</p>
<p>And then on Tuesday, the market, you know,</p>
<p>the S&amp;P was up like 250 basis points, 2.5%.</p>
<p>And the NASDAQ was also up, you know,</p>
<p>call it maybe 300 basis points, roughly.</p>
<p>But Facebook was down like 400 points, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a big spread.</p>
<p>And why is that?</p>
<p>And I was like, this makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>What is going on with this price action?</p>
<p>Everything was up, Apple was up, Google was up.</p>
<p>And so I called around and, you know, I was like,</p>
<p>why is this happening?</p>
<p>And this is the best explanation I got.</p>
<p>When you look at who the incremental buyer is</p>
<p>in the stock market,</p>
<p>it tends to give you a sense of whether prices can go up</p>
<p>or will continue to go down.</p>
<p>And the poorest informed buyer tends to be retail.</p>
<p>And the most informed buyer</p>
<p>tends to be these very large institutional hedge funds.</p>
<p>Right, so there&rsquo;s a spectrum.</p>
<p>And Facebook is an example of one of the,</p>
<p>of big tech that is poorly owned by retail.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s mostly owned by smart money.</p>
<p>And the case that smart money makes for owning Facebook</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s got an extremely cheap</p>
<p>price to earnings ratio.</p>
<p>So you must own it.</p>
<p>And what they said was that they, you know,</p>
<p>looking at the tea leaves of consumer demand,</p>
<p>what they actually re-underwrote was that actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that the price to earnings was cheap,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that the E in PE was just wrong.</p>
<p>And if they pass through all of these increases</p>
<p>in inflation and, you know,</p>
<p>their earnings expectations into Facebook,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually more like fair value at a lower price.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they sold it so much</p>
<p>on a day where the market was up.</p>
<p>Now, why is that important?</p>
<p>Well, eventually you&rsquo;re gonna touch</p>
<p>all these other stocks as well</p>
<p>that are gonna go through earnings revisions</p>
<p>in this recession.</p>
<p>This is where I think Wall Street has done a very poor job</p>
<p>on behalf of retail.</p>
<p>If you look at the average estimates of earnings,</p>
<p>you will be shocked to hear that Wall Street</p>
<p>actually has this year being record earnings,</p>
<p>next year earnings continuing to go up.</p>
<p>How is that even possible?</p>
<p>Well, I actually have a feeling.</p>
<p>How do you see earnings continuing to go up</p>
<p>into these prints like this,</p>
<p>when you cannot pass through, you know,</p>
<p>80, 90% increases in energy and COGS and whatnot?</p>
<p>How does that happen?</p>
<p>I think what people would say</p>
<p>is maybe they&rsquo;re gonna lower their costs.</p>
<p>And so with layoffs and lowering salaries</p>
<p>and lowering spend on advertising,</p>
<p>you know, the E could go up.</p>
<p>If people start belt tightening</p>
<p>and then we start having companies that are being run,</p>
<p>you know, just more for the bottom line.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to sell fewer things</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;ll be fewer people with jobs to buy things.</p>
<p>But we have 10 million job openings.</p>
<p>So this is the weird thing about this recession</p>
<p>is because we haven&rsquo;t let a lot of people</p>
<p>immigrate into the country,</p>
<p>but we have so many jobs.</p>
<p>Is that what you think the consensus view on Wall Street is</p>
<p>that basically a bunch of people get fired</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s why earnings continue to go up?</p>
<p>Well, they stopped hiring for two years in advance, right?</p>
<p>Facebook said they were hiring for like 2024.</p>
<p>Their hiring plans were looking out two years.</p>
<p>So now if they go on a hiring freeze,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s, you know, and that&rsquo;s their number one cost.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just putting out a theory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you the counterfactual.</p>
<p>I think Wall Street&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I think that earnings are gonna go down this year</p>
<p>and will definitely go down in 23.</p>
<p>And so I think what probably happens</p>
<p>is the entire world of equities needs to get repriced</p>
<p>at a lower price.</p>
<p>And in that, it&rsquo;s gonna put enormous pressure</p>
<p>on these cash burning, non-profitable tech companies.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>But in the ones that are profitable, Chamath,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re aware of this.</p>
<p>Facebook just canceled like two of their prototypes</p>
<p>they were working on to save money.</p>
<p>So that whole $10 billion into, you know, VR,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re trying to make that number look smaller.</p>
<p>Sax, what do you think?</p>
<p>Well, I think you&rsquo;re bringing up a really interesting point</p>
<p>with this, the 10 million, you know, job openings.</p>
<p>And now that number&rsquo;s coming down really fast</p>
<p>as companies close open recs</p>
<p>and they basically freeze hiring.</p>
<p>So that number&rsquo;s gonna come down very, very fast.</p>
<p>But one of the major contributors to inflation</p>
<p>is that the labor force participation has been very low.</p>
<p>Millions of people left the labor force during COVID</p>
<p>as a result of the stimulus checks</p>
<p>and the freezing of rent and evictions.</p>
<p>I mean, look, rent&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s number one expense.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t have to pay rent for a couple of years,</p>
<p>a lot of them may not work or may not work as much.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had this problem where we really need</p>
<p>about 2 million people to reenter the labor force.</p>
<p>And if you describe inflation as too much money</p>
<p>chasing too few goods,</p>
<p>we need to increase production and productive capacity.</p>
<p>And when you have millions of people</p>
<p>dropping out of the labor force,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got less goods and services being produced</p>
<p>that people want.</p>
<p>So just reducing the money supply</p>
<p>is not gonna get us out of this mess.</p>
<p>We also need to improve productive capacity.</p>
<p>Just to put a number on that,</p>
<p>we peaked in the 1999 era at 67%</p>
<p>of participational labor force.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s been down in this low 60, 61, 62,</p>
<p>and it continues to be low.</p>
<p>But that is the solution here.</p>
<p>We get that 7%, that gap could change everything.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just fix the demand side</p>
<p>because if all you do is fix the demand side,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re killing the economy</p>
<p>to reduce demand in order to bring down prices.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very painful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all pain.</p>
<p>But what you also have to do is fix the supply side.</p>
<p>You have to increase the availability</p>
<p>of all the critical inputs into the economy.</p>
<p>So labor obviously is one of them,</p>
<p>but also critical resources like energy,</p>
<p>you know, oil, natural gas, and so on.</p>
<p>And that goes back to fixing the supply chain,</p>
<p>hopefully getting a resolution of the situation</p>
<p>in Ukraine, the war.</p>
<p>So if we could fix those things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a way to improve the economy</p>
<p>without creating more pain.</p>
<p>Freeberg, if the prices of just daily living,</p>
<p>of which transportation and housing and healthcare</p>
<p>are now the top three, I believe,</p>
<p>groceries and healthcare I think have flip flopped</p>
<p>a couple of times in the last decade in terms of costs.</p>
<p>If those things go up, would that make people</p>
<p>want to go back to work to pay for those things?</p>
<p>Or does it create capitulation where people say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m moving in with my cousin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to lower my balance sheet.</p>
<p>What is your prediction there?</p>
<p>Are more people going to go to work?</p>
<p>Or do we still have this, you know,</p>
<p>call it 10 million people in the country</p>
<p>who just don&rsquo;t want to go to work?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned this in the past,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another kind of interesting outcome of this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had several months in a row</p>
<p>of pretty significant increase in consumer credit.</p>
<p>And I think the reason is things are getting more expensive.</p>
<p>People generally do not like to reduce their spend on stuff</p>
<p>or their living, their lifestyle.</p>
<p>Once you get used to a lifestyle,</p>
<p>like going out to dinner once a week</p>
<p>or going to the movies every week and you create a budget,</p>
<p>you create a life experience around that,</p>
<p>a model around that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to say, okay, I got to cut budget now.</p>
<p>And I got to reduce my life.</p>
<p>I would rather say, I&rsquo;m going to keep doing that.</p>
<p>Or at least there&rsquo;s some inertia or some momentum</p>
<p>to keep spending on the things that you&rsquo;ve been spending on.</p>
<p>And the way you do that in a model</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have as much income</p>
<p>or you have less income and things are getting more expensive</p>
<p>is you take on more debt.</p>
<p>And so there is a little bit of a nervousness</p>
<p>that I have had that people&rsquo;s response generally,</p>
<p>the consumer response to inflation</p>
<p>and to a kind of a shifting income environment like this</p>
<p>is not necessarily to cut as quickly,</p>
<p>but take on more debt and keep buying.</p>
<p>And so I am a little nervous about that,</p>
<p>but I do think obviously at some point,</p>
<p>everyone has to figure out ways to generate income.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of these kind of ancillary markets</p>
<p>that are typically the first to go,</p>
<p>these extra services markets where people,</p>
<p>have found other ways to make money,</p>
<p>side hustles and whatnot that may or may not be as robust</p>
<p>as they have been historically.</p>
<p>And so people may need to go back</p>
<p>for more secure, stable income and these jobs get filled.</p>
<p>I mean, as we all know, there&rsquo;s an opportunity</p>
<p>and this is the whole concept,</p>
<p>I think behind Build Back Better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not super thoughtful in terms of the approach.</p>
<p>I think based on my understanding</p>
<p>of where that money is supposed to go,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t create long-term jobs,</p>
<p>but there is an opportunity to build new manufacturing</p>
<p>and new infrastructure jobs in the US right now</p>
<p>that could enable a healthy transition here.</p>
<p>But that legislation needs to be done smart.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be done with this,</p>
<p>like, hey, let&rsquo;s build a bunch of bridges</p>
<p>and then a bunch of contractors make a bunch of money</p>
<p>and no one has any long-term jobs out of it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to find ways to spend money</p>
<p>on creating long-term sustainable new industry here.</p>
<p>Yeah, job openings 11.4, it&rsquo;s come down about six or 7%.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be trailing, but it&rsquo;s for sure,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing it in our industry with the hiring freezes</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna work through those open jobs.</p>
<p>What are the chances that inflation gets under control</p>
<p>in the next year?</p>
<p>And should the Fed go for like the 1% slam on the brakes?</p>
<p>There was some talk about that.</p>
<p>Obviously they went from 50 to 75.</p>
<p>Remember a lot of the elements that we were kind of saying,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, I can&rsquo;t believe the climate prices.</p>
<p>So wheat is down, I think 30%, lumber is down 50%,</p>
<p>gas prices are coming down.</p>
<p>So there are some of these commodity spikes</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve experienced over the past couple of quarters,</p>
<p>particularly recently, that have had a significant part</p>
<p>of the fueling effect on the inflationary trickle down</p>
<p>into ultimately end products and whatnot.</p>
<p>And those are coming down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real question of how quickly that flows</p>
<p>through the economy and flows through to the price of goods</p>
<p>that consumers ultimately end up paying for.</p>
<p>The gas prices right now are the biggest concern, right?</p>
<p>Like unless you can get gas prices under control,</p>
<p>that always, always has a massive impact on spending,</p>
<p>on consumer spending, which drives a recessionary cycle.</p>
<p>And so if I&rsquo;m the Biden administration,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m first and foremost,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about the general inflationary indicators</p>
<p>as much as I care about getting the price of gas down.</p>
<p>That is a super, super critical number to fix.</p>
<p>Is this, are these gas prices gonna change</p>
<p>how Americans look at what car they buy?</p>
<p>Because this is what happened last time we had that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna get worse.</p>
<p>People started looking at not buying SUVs.</p>
<p>We could have $7 gas.</p>
<p>There was a picture actually, I tweeted in California,</p>
<p>there was a $7 and 11 cents gas.</p>
<p>Broadly, broadly, we could have $7 gas</p>
<p>all throughout the country.</p>
<p>But J. Cal, remember the average automobile</p>
<p>in the US lasts for 12 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how often people change out their cars.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s 8% of the fleet being changed per year.</p>
<p>And the interest rates for auto loans</p>
<p>have spiked like crazy now</p>
<p>with this change in the Fed rates.</p>
<p>And as a result, the delinquency on auto loan portfolios</p>
<p>has spiked like crazy.</p>
<p>And so, you know, yes, sure, theoretically,</p>
<p>people will think about buying an electric car,</p>
<p>but most people aren&rsquo;t thinking about that on average</p>
<p>for five or six years from now,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the average of a 12 year cycle, right?</p>
<p>Five years from now.</p>
<p>Wait till all these Peloton bikes need to get repossessed.</p>
<p>Well, all these, actually the wait for cars</p>
<p>and the overpricing of cars has ended in the last two months.</p>
<p>And there are multiple cars now on the market,</p>
<p>25, 30K for a 50 plus mile per gallon car.</p>
<p>I think this actually,</p>
<p>one of the silver linings coming out of this</p>
<p>is people might actually stop buying as many SUVs</p>
<p>or, you know, I think our average</p>
<p>is in the low 20s right now</p>
<p>and Europe&rsquo;s is in the high 40s.</p>
<p>The problem is like, you know, every other-</p>
<p>For miles per gallon.</p>
<p>Part of the government acknowledges</p>
<p>that you have to really ring fence</p>
<p>and protect consumers, right?</p>
<p>Like if you look at the securities laws,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re meant to protect them at all costs.</p>
<p>And Jason, you&rsquo;ve, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been frustrated by some of the rules</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>And when they change, they change so slowly.</p>
<p>But the reason is because sometimes</p>
<p>that you want people to make good decisions.</p>
<p>And if you, you know, give them a bunch of firepower,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just gonna spend it.</p>
<p>And, you know, what we really did</p>
<p>was we gave folks just a ton of money.</p>
<p>And what did they do?</p>
<p>They acted rationally, they spent it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And now we have to take it all back.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s gonna be as easy</p>
<p>or as simple as people think.</p>
<p>What percentage of the money supply</p>
<p>do you think is in excess right now in the United States?</p>
<p>Well, look, I told you this</p>
<p>because I wrote this in my annual letter,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s stunning that, you know,</p>
<p>the reason the stock market went up dollar for dollar</p>
<p>was actually tied to the growth in the M2 money supply.</p>
<p>The correlation was 0.92.</p>
<p>So for every dollar that the Fed printed,</p>
<p>the stock market went up by 92 cents.</p>
<p>So, you know, it stands to reason</p>
<p>that if the Fed is gonna take three</p>
<p>to $5 trillion of value out,</p>
<p>then we have to re-rate the equity markets</p>
<p>by three to $5 trillion at a minimum.</p>
<p>And then you have to re-rate and re-baseline for earnings.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s probably another 20 or 30%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna-</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the end game here.</p>
<p>The rates go up, people stop buying homes,</p>
<p>people go back to work,</p>
<p>and energy prices come back down</p>
<p>because people are not buying as much of it.</p>
<p>Spending goes down and people rebalance,</p>
<p>and that takes a year.</p>
<p>The job openings could also disappear, by the way.</p>
<p>I mean, like-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re assuming-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking out 400,000 a month is what, you know,</p>
<p>from the peaks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re assuming that all of a sudden,</p>
<p>like, demand is stable, but it&rsquo;s not necessarily stable.</p>
<p>And in a demand contraction, yes, people get fired,</p>
<p>but then also new job openings change, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s fewer of them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more specific in the way</p>
<p>that people will recruit for people.</p>
<p>Salaries go down, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the next piece. Salaries go down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the piece I&rsquo;m waiting for.</p>
<p>To me, that would be,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys have early warning signs,</p>
<p>but the two early warning signs I have in my, you know,</p>
<p>job of investing in early stage companies</p>
<p>is when people-</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s the average salary for an engineer?</p>
<p>If that hasn&rsquo;t gone down by now,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s never going to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lagging indicator, right?</p>
<p>Well, that would be, to me, capitulation.</p>
<p>Salaries go down, or people,</p>
<p>instead of laying people off sacks,</p>
<p>they do salary cuts at a company.</p>
<p>That is really hard to do, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gnarly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think they do salaries.</p>
<p>More liquidation preferences and deals.</p>
<p>Right, I think the way the salaries come down</p>
<p>is that startups freeze their hiring plans</p>
<p>or they lay people off,</p>
<p>and now all of a sudden the war for talent subsides,</p>
<p>easier to hire people,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no need to keep raising up salaries.</p>
<p>Are you seeing that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we&rsquo;re seeing the beginning of it,</p>
<p>but I gotta tell you, I mean,</p>
<p>I think that startups have not fully embraced</p>
<p>or realized what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I just got back from the Cotu Summit</p>
<p>over the past couple of days.</p>
<p>This was an event that was hosted by Cotu,</p>
<p>you know, whose founders are Philippe and Thomas Lafont.</p>
<p>Very smart guys, very smart investors</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been public market sort of hedge fund investors</p>
<p>for a long time,</p>
<p>so have a large venture fund to do growth stage investing.</p>
<p>Some of the takeaways from that conference,</p>
<p>some of the more vivid lines that stuck with me</p>
<p>is that one of the speakers said that,</p>
<p>he said that when it comes to runway for startups,</p>
<p>three to four years is the new two years</p>
<p>because if you just have two years of runway,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need to raise in a year,</p>
<p>and in a year from now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be in the middle of a recession.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re predicting, they&rsquo;re forecasting</p>
<p>that capital availability is gonna decline about 75%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s venture money that&rsquo;s available to the ecosystem</p>
<p>down by three quarters.</p>
<p>So if you try to raise in that environment,</p>
<p>either you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to</p>
<p>or investors are gonna, you know, have all the leverage.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get terms that you like.</p>
<p>So they were recommending three to four years of runway.</p>
<p>So that is not what I think a lot of companies</p>
<p>are planning for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not even possible.</p>
<p>The other thing that, the other really vivid takeaway</p>
<p>is that they did some polling of the startup founders</p>
<p>who are in attendance, okay?</p>
<p>And what the numbers basically showed is a contradiction.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the founders sort of understood</p>
<p>that intellectually that we&rsquo;re headed into a downturn,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re headed to a recession,</p>
<p>and so the polling reflected that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you ask the founders</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re gonna react to it,</p>
<p>what are you gonna do about it?</p>
<p>Are you gonna cut headcount?</p>
<p>Are you gonna accelerate your business to beat competitors?</p>
<p>Everybody said, oh, we&rsquo;re gonna out-accelerate</p>
<p>our competitors.</p>
<p>So everybody thought that they&rsquo;re the exception.</p>
<p>In other words, everyone understood</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re headed for this massive recession</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be really bad,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna be the one company</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t need to cut.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually gonna grow.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna accelerate during the downturn.</p>
<p>So there was a real contradiction</p>
<p>in how founders are interpreting this advice.</p>
<p>And I have to tell you,</p>
<p>when I talk to founders in our own portfolio,</p>
<p>what I see is we&rsquo;ve now done multiple meetings</p>
<p>where we lay out what&rsquo;s happening in the economy,</p>
<p>and they get it, they understand it.</p>
<p>And when we do a board meeting,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna go look at our plan</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna reevaluate</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna make major cuts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna bring our burn multiple</p>
<p>down to where it should be.</p>
<p>But then when you&rsquo;re checking with them</p>
<p>a couple of months later and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>where are you on the plan?</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t taken the medicine.</p>
<p>Or the medicine is like a 10% cut.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, guys, like 10% is a performance review.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you should be doing every year anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, you get rid of the bottom,</p>
<p>like the C performers, you promote the A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and you get rid of the C.</p>
<p>So no one really wants to take the medicine yet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>I mean, Sequoia has this great chart</p>
<p>called survival of the quickest</p>
<p>that we should put up on the screen.</p>
<p>And it shows two lines.</p>
<p>One company is the one that takes the medicine right away,</p>
<p>brings their burn down to where it should be.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re able to grow from there.</p>
<p>And they really will out-accelerate the competitors.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s the company</p>
<p>that basically delays and waits.</p>
<p>And what happens is by the time</p>
<p>they finally get religion to make the cuts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too late because even after they make the cuts,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have enough runway on the other side.</p>
<p>They burn the capital, yeah.</p>
<p>They burn the capital and then they&rsquo;re in a death spiral.</p>
<p>So I think what companies need to think about</p>
<p>is this 75% reduction.</p>
<p>Imagine if you did $100 million round last year, right?</p>
<p>If you go try to raise next year in the middle of this</p>
<p>recession, that $100 million round</p>
<p>might look like a $25 million round.</p>
<p>So imagine if you&rsquo;re burning an extra 25 to 50 million more</p>
<p>than you should be according to your burn multiple,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically burning the next round.</p>
<p>Forget about the fact that the last round</p>
<p>gave you all this cushion.</p>
<p>Think about how much of the next round you&rsquo;re burning.</p>
<p>And if you reorient your thinking around that,</p>
<p>it could lead to a change in behavior.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I&rsquo;m seeing people come back</p>
<p>from rounds where they were expecting 40 or $50 million.</p>
<p>In some cases, like with 250K in revenue, 500K in revenue,</p>
<p>they were living in a 200, 300 times revenue kind of world.</p>
<p>It was just insane.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re now coming back with $10 million caps,</p>
<p>$15 million caps on their notes.</p>
<p>I was offered $100 million of at a 50% discount.</p>
<p>And I said, call me when you get to 65.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the best company.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally the best company.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best and the best founders to bet on, right?</p>
<p>Of probably most private companies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like that valuation Chamath?</p>
<p>What is that valuation?</p>
<p>40 at 50% off?</p>
<p>I, it&rsquo;s less of a judgment on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just more an observation</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re at the beginning of the beginning.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re at the beginning of the beginning, okay?</p>
<p>For all of us that lived through the 2000,</p>
<p>this was four years of sheer hell and a grind.</p>
<p>Now we have $30 trillion</p>
<p>that we have to work through the economy,</p>
<p>a recession we have to overcome, a war we need to end.</p>
<p>And people all of a sudden assume</p>
<p>that two or three rate hikes</p>
<p>and five or six months of headlines are enough.</p>
<p>And on the margin, maybe they&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>but from my perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less a judgment on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just an observation</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re at the beginning of something</p>
<p>that just fundamentally has to take some amount of time</p>
<p>to work its way through the system.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t understand why anybody</p>
<p>would give up their liquidity in this moment right now.</p>
<p>Why would you, why would I give up $100 million of cash</p>
<p>in my bank account?</p>
<p>I would not do that right now.</p>
<p>Because the cash gives you so much optionality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically.</p>
<p>So much optionality.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to be looking for distress</p>
<p>and this is the thing.</p>
<p>So you have a huge amount of capital leaving the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Like we know Tiger is basically out.</p>
<p>I mean, they were the, basically the default provider</p>
<p>of growth stage capital over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>So you have a lot of liquidity leaving the system.</p>
<p>And then the liquidity that&rsquo;s in the system</p>
<p>is waiting for distress.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a quarter.</p>
<p>I mean, like we talked about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a quarter trillion dollars</p>
<p>of quote unquote dry powder.</p>
<p>I mean, I know Chamath thinks</p>
<p>that people are going to give that money back,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s never been as much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not that much, a lot of that&rsquo;s deployed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to give it back.</p>
<p>Giving a lot of that&rsquo;s deployed?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look at that, that Tiger fund.</p>
<p>Tiger raised a new $12 billion fund</p>
<p>that was announced in March.</p>
<p>And TechCrunch, we covered it on the show a month ago.</p>
<p>TechCrunch had an article saying</p>
<p>it was already deployed in six months.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t on that show.</p>
<p>Oh, that was the one where Jekyll</p>
<p>tried to replace you with Brad Gerstner.</p>
<p>We should do the show weekly going forward</p>
<p>instead of monthly.</p>
<p>It might be better to keep up with these trends.</p>
<p>Okay, speaking of trends.</p>
<p>Jekyll, you made a good point there.</p>
<p>Can we just go back to this for a second?</p>
<p>You said the founders were,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still anchored on this world</p>
<p>of two to 300 times ARR valuations.</p>
<p>Let me just tell you where the new valuation levels are.</p>
<p>And this is obviously in flux,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty sure the valuation levels</p>
<p>are at 20 to 30 times ARR.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for a company that&rsquo;s growing 3X year over year.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>3X year over year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best of the best.</p>
<p>The reason how you get there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s 10X next year is ARR basically.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And the way that you get there</p>
<p>is that if you look at like the multiples</p>
<p>for like the best public SaaS companies</p>
<p>that are like say a 40% grower,</p>
<p>like a Snowflake, they&rsquo;re at 8X.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, so basically it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving more credit for the higher growth rate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, but they really have to have that 3X growth.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you&rsquo;re a founder,</p>
<p>think about the fact that when you try</p>
<p>to go raise next year,</p>
<p>assuming you&rsquo;re the best of the best,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get 20 to 30 times ARR.</p>
<p>Now think about you&rsquo;re spending not last round&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re spending the next round&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>If you could just reorient your thinking that way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d burn a lot less money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I literally had a deal, you know,</p>
<p>in the 30 and 40 range and angel investors who never,</p>
<p>early stage angel investors seed funds</p>
<p>that did not look at multiples are now asking me,</p>
<p>because when I send a deal memo to 10,000 people</p>
<p>for my syndicate, people hit reply.</p>
<p>People are hitting reply now and saying,</p>
<p>I did the math on this.</p>
<p>This is the multiple.</p>
<p>This is this.</p>
<p>This is the burn multiple.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually doing the math.</p>
<p>So we all of a sudden have discipline</p>
<p>that I have not seen in this investor class</p>
<p>in the 10 years I&rsquo;ve been doing it.</p>
<p>So that is to me, one of the great silver linings here.</p>
<p>I think people are going to do a better job</p>
<p>with their personal balance sheets.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to invest less in speculative stuff</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to invest more</p>
<p>in the actual builders who have discipline.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to see this massive swing to discipline</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to flush out all the people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have product market fit.</p>
<p>Think about all those folks,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s happened in the last six months.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;ve been long, unprofitable tech.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got smoked by 75 to 85%.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been long crypto.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gotten spoked by 65%.</p>
<p>More, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, if they weren&rsquo;t using a calculator then</p>
<p>they sure as hell should be using a calculator now</p>
<p>to figure it out.</p>
<p>People are, well, you think about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole group of investors</p>
<p>who have only known the up market.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole group of founders</p>
<p>who only know the growth market.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re under 40 years old,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re about to experience.</p>
<p>And here we are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a perfect time to segue into crypto.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s price is down 71% from the all time high</p>
<p>69K in November of 2021, bottomed out at 17,000 or so</p>
<p>on June 18th, Ethereum&rsquo;s price down 78%.</p>
<p>And if you look at the craziness</p>
<p>since the last all in episode,</p>
<p>you know, this 3AC, three arrow capital,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a crypto hedge fund that was letting people</p>
<p>basically loan out their crypto.</p>
<p>They are basically closing a $10 billion crypto hedge fund</p>
<p>at its peak.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re insolvent according to the reports.</p>
<p>Terra Luna collapsed.</p>
<p>The founders and employees at that company</p>
<p>are not being allowed to leave South Korea.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re guilty,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s certainly not looking good.</p>
<p>And there is a whole situation with Solana</p>
<p>and a company built on top of it, Solend,</p>
<p>which is not Solana.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an application built on top of it.</p>
<p>I talked to Vinny Lingam, our friend,</p>
<p>earlier this week about it.</p>
<p>They had a whale who had tried to loan out 100 million</p>
<p>and they had to freeze their account</p>
<p>because they thought the downward pressure,</p>
<p>since there was not many buyers in crypto right now,</p>
<p>could collapse Solana.</p>
<p>So thoughts on crypto writ large.</p>
<p>What is this going to look like, Sax,</p>
<p>over the next year for crypto?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like the dot com crash all over again.</p>
<p>I mean, basically you had an extremely promising technology.</p>
<p>I mean, it is a promising technology.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a future technology platform,</p>
<p>but the price action got totally decoupled</p>
<p>from the level of progress in the space.</p>
<p>And people were not valuing these things</p>
<p>based on real customers, real usage, and real use cases,</p>
<p>but it became very speculative.</p>
<p>And again, all of this was fueled</p>
<p>by the excess liquidity that was pumped into the system.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve said it before</p>
<p>that crypto is like a liquidity sponge.</p>
<p>It sucks up, when there&rsquo;s a lot of excess liquidity,</p>
<p>it sucks up that liquidity,</p>
<p>but now that sponge is getting wrung out.</p>
<p>And part of the problem is with interest rates going up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing when you have negative real interest rates</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t earn a return on your money,</p>
<p>then you start to get,</p>
<p>you basically people start to push the envelope</p>
<p>and invest in more and more speculative things.</p>
<p>But as you can get a real return in,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s like a real risk-free rate,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s alternatives for all that cash.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got the problem of leverage as well,</p>
<p>which I think over the last few weeks,</p>
<p>the crypto space was heavily over levered</p>
<p>and a lot of people got margin called and wiped out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the contagion that&rsquo;s occurred.</p>
<p>And people were levered up five, 10 times</p>
<p>their Bitcoin on these roads.</p>
<p>Wait till these token sale things get litigated.</p>
<p>I mean, the amount of grift</p>
<p>by so many of these venture firms</p>
<p>in running these sketchy deals</p>
<p>where they would put in some amount of money.</p>
<p>This is my understanding of the scam</p>
<p>because it was explained to me.</p>
<p>You put in a little bit of equity at some crazy price</p>
<p>and then you get these tokens.</p>
<p>And apparently there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>like you can just sell these tokens day one.</p>
<p>And so what happens is like you price the equity</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s meaningless because really what you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>is the right to get some amount of these tokens.</p>
<p>The price is crazy, you sell it</p>
<p>and then you just kind of walk away.</p>
<p>And apparently, you do these deals</p>
<p>where you just rinse and repeat this thing.</p>
<p>Well, wait till that gets exposed.</p>
<p>I mean, that seems like a total.</p>
<p>The firm that did this the most is Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>Chris Dixon, I think was considered</p>
<p>like the best investor last year or the year before</p>
<p>because of all these token returns.</p>
<p>I gotta wonder when they go,</p>
<p>now that this people are losing money,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when people start suing.</p>
<p>I mean, what is it gonna look like if they were,</p>
<p>what do you think their marks looked like last year</p>
<p>versus right now?</p>
<p>I mean, and all these coins,</p>
<p>like looking back in the review mirror and saying,</p>
<p>hey, you bought all these coins,</p>
<p>you flipped some number of coins.</p>
<p>To your point, Chamath, what is the litigation path</p>
<p>and the shadow economy that was created?</p>
<p>What is that gonna look like?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an article and I think it was in Bloomberg</p>
<p>about folks trying to figure out how to get</p>
<p>a lawsuit filed against Binance.</p>
<p>And the problem was that they didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what entity to sue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear who owns what and what owns the other</p>
<p>and who the ultimate look through ownership structure is.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t mean that Binance is guilty of anything,</p>
<p>but the article was just showing how there was a US investor</p>
<p>who lost $1.2 million who wanted to file a lawsuit</p>
<p>and they have every right to do that.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t even find the corporate entity</p>
<p>to actually file this lawsuit against.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening in a trillion dollar market,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of oversight that we&rsquo;ve missed.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what is this gonna do to regulation in crypto</p>
<p>at this point?</p>
<p>Because crypto regulators are gonna just be looking</p>
<p>at this going, wow, look at all the pain and suffering.</p>
<p>And when a local DA gets five or six of their people</p>
<p>complaining they lost money in Terraluna or whatever it is,</p>
<p>this is like the perfect opportunity for them</p>
<p>to collect a pelt and get some crypto kid</p>
<p>and hold them responsible and get some great headlines.</p>
<p>I mean, what do you think happens from this point forward</p>
<p>in the crypto land?</p>
<p>What you just said.</p>
<p>Okay, there you have it, folks.</p>
<p>But what about regulation?</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the next piece</p>
<p>because all of these entities have taken a very-</p>
<p>The SEC last July or August published</p>
<p>this kind of initial opinion letter.</p>
<p>But remember, there&rsquo;s also the CFTC,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of regulatory authorities</p>
<p>in the United States that have a longer process</p>
<p>than governments ex-US that have had a much more</p>
<p>kind of stringent point of view</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of casino-like gambling going on</p>
<p>with these things and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no functional utility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, is it a security</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s no underlying business?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not a security, then it&rsquo;s just a bet on something.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a bet on something, it&rsquo;s gambling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that-</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a security, it has to be governed by the SEC.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a future or a commodity, it&rsquo;s the CFTC.</p>
<p>And the problem is we need Congress</p>
<p>to pass some legislative framework</p>
<p>that puts the puck in one side of the arena,</p>
<p>a rink or the other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And otherwise-</p>
<p>Otherwise all this gray is going to exist for a long time</p>
<p>and people, if governments really hate it</p>
<p>when retail investors lose money,</p>
<p>well, watch out because they just had $2 trillion of money.</p>
<p>In the US, we have a lot of other regulators</p>
<p>that can prosecute cases like the DFS in New York.</p>
<p>This is the Department of Financial Services.</p>
<p>They are a pretty litigious prosecutorial group.</p>
<p>I mean, they go after scams and people preying on consumers</p>
<p>and retail investors in a very aggressive way,</p>
<p>often outside of the purview of the SEC.</p>
<p>They often coordinate with the DOJ or the SEC</p>
<p>in evaluating enforcement decisions,</p>
<p>but they will prosecute.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s a, as you said,</p>
<p>a lot of opportunity when people have been grifted</p>
<p>out of their money for politically motivated</p>
<p>and people that generally have kind of the right point</p>
<p>of view that are in a position to prosecute</p>
<p>to go after the offenders.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right, there will be a lot of action on this</p>
<p>over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>And then Chamath is right,</p>
<p>the way it gets resolved is a congressional act.</p>
<p>But by the way, I&rsquo;ll just point out,</p>
<p>in the year 2000, Congress passed what was called</p>
<p>the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.</p>
<p>And that CFMA was really meant to kind of quote,</p>
<p>bring commodities and futures into the digital age.</p>
<p>And they started working on it in 1996.</p>
<p>It took four years to get it done.</p>
<p>Within four years, it was already out of date.</p>
<p>And a lot of what was going on with respect</p>
<p>to how exchanges operate and the types of contracts</p>
<p>that are being created, it was already missed.</p>
<p>So, you know, the problem we have here is that</p>
<p>by legislating the state of the market today,</p>
<p>without creating enough flexibility</p>
<p>in how enforcement action can be pursued</p>
<p>and how things can be interpreted in the future,</p>
<p>you could end up in a similar situation</p>
<p>where people just find and run around</p>
<p>and the whole thing repeats itself in the next few years.</p>
<p>Because guess what?</p>
<p>People will always want to gamble</p>
<p>and grifters will always want to grift.</p>
<p>And so there will always be a way</p>
<p>to try and scam people out of their money.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>Hey-o!</p>
<p>Hey-o!</p>
<p>By the way, are you&hellip;</p>
<p>J-Cal&rsquo;s always going to want a J-Cal.</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Oh, you get out of here with your calling.</p>
<p>Everybody download Call-In.</p>
<p>You can get the after gym podcast.</p>
<p>J-Cal&rsquo;s going to J-Cal.</p>
<p>Before we pivot, if you want a perfect example of this,</p>
<p>and this is just a lesson to founders out there.</p>
<p>If you feel like you&rsquo;re in a gray area, you probably are.</p>
<p>People were like, oh, NFTs, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just trading cards, yada, yada.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a big deal that somebody at OpenSea</p>
<p>decided to front run the market.</p>
<p>Oh, they just bought a trading card</p>
<p>ahead of everybody else.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>Well, you know who cares?</p>
<p>Turns out the Southern District of New York cares</p>
<p>and they are a pretty serious group of people.</p>
<p>Former employee of NFT Marketplace,</p>
<p>OpenSea was charged in the first ever</p>
<p>Digital Asset Insider Trading Scheme.</p>
<p>So just because insider trading</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t exist as a concept for NFTs before, congratulations.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t exist in crypto.</p>
<p>I mean, if they want to really find the honeypots here,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the worst kept secret in crypto</p>
<p>how much insider trading is going on</p>
<p>amongst the organizations that run the exchanges</p>
<p>and their side pockets that they use to manage liquidity.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the biggest thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been happening in crypto.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why people were spending</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of dollars on a board ape</p>
<p>or whatever, like there might&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>some shenanigans going on here.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>I mean, no, but Jason, it&rsquo;s not illegal.</p>
<p>This is my understanding though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not illegal to front run crypto trade.</p>
<p>So most of these organizations that run an exchange, right?</p>
<p>Compete for order flow.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re able to just look at that order flow</p>
<p>and then they front run the trade</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re on the other side of that.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re always making money.</p>
<p>And so they were making tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>All these exchanges were.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then I guess the question becomes Saks,</p>
<p>you know, in terms of, since you&rsquo;re an attorney,</p>
<p>like how you interpret this stuff,</p>
<p>there may not be a law on the books</p>
<p>about front running NFTs,</p>
<p>but there are laws on the books about fraud and NFT</p>
<p>and conspiracy to, you know,</p>
<p>grift people out of their money.</p>
<p>So this is all gonna come crashing down</p>
<p>and the discovery is going to be next level.</p>
<p>If the Southern District of New York</p>
<p>actually subpoenaed any of these exchanges,</p>
<p>all hell would break loose.</p>
<p>Oh, no, they are.</p>
<p>You can be sure that&rsquo;s in process.</p>
<p>If they go after one NFT flipper.</p>
<p>No, forget NFTs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying coins, crypto, like that&rsquo;s the huge market.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re turning over these cards</p>
<p>because you know how they like to work.</p>
<p>They like to flip their way up to the top person.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not talking about January 6th here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about gas in the Ukraine next.</p>
<p>Hey-oh.</p>
<p>Hey-ho.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little reference for you.</p>
<p>Listen, now that we&rsquo;re an hour and 10 in</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve kind of like broken the ice</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re friends again.</p>
<p>Yes, I feel good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re playing as a team again.</p>
<p>You want to redo our intros</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not being such a bitch?</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Can we just move forward?</p>
<p>I think we all understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to be recognized.</p>
<p>You said that you were workshopping an intro.</p>
<p>So do you want to do your intros at the end of this or not?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing the intros.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m on strike on intros.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what it was.</p>
<p>I wanted to, the intros.</p>
<p>He needs an extra point.</p>
<p>He needs an extra point to do the intros.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not about the point.</p>
<p>That was a joke.</p>
<p>I wanted to do intros.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know coming into this</p>
<p>how sensitive people would be.</p>
<p>And then Saks is like,</p>
<p>I need to have in the contract a non disparaging NDA.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m scared about the things I said.</p>
<p>So spike content needs to be-</p>
<p>No, I actually took that out.</p>
<p>You were the spike content guy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the most concerned about spike content.</p>
<p>No, we have an agreement around that.</p>
<p>Spike content is a good rule.</p>
<p>Non disparagement, he didn&rsquo;t want to have in there.</p>
<p>I under-</p>
<p>Oh, he didn&rsquo;t want non disparagement.</p>
<p>He wants to have free reign to disparage you day and night.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s ready to go.</p>
<p>To be honest, I took it out</p>
<p>because I thought you would be more sensitive</p>
<p>about accusing others of disparaging you.</p>
<p>This whole show is you disparaging me, Saks.</p>
<p>Do you have an intro or not for the viewers?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have intros prepared.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ll do intros next episode.</p>
<p>I promise everybody.</p>
<p>I wanted to take the temperature of my besties.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people are sensitive right now.</p>
<p>You want me to make a joke about Brad Gershner?</p>
<p>Look, we got real shit to talk about.</p>
<p>Can we talk about Ukraine and World War III?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all about our narcissistic nonsense</p>
<p>as four teenage boys running amok.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Saks.</p>
<p>Something happened in the last week</p>
<p>that I think is pretty disconcerting.</p>
<p>I mean, just intellectually speaking,</p>
<p>we all know that wars that go on and on</p>
<p>have a tendency to escalate.</p>
<p>And there was an example of how this could happen</p>
<p>over the past week.</p>
<p>Lithuania is now essentially stopping the flow of goods</p>
<p>from the Russian mainland to another part of Russia</p>
<p>called Kaliningrad, which is, it&rsquo;s called an oblast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little area, but it&rsquo;s outside the Russian mainland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically between Poland and Lithuania.</p>
<p>And so goods go by rail from the Russian mainland</p>
<p>to Kaliningrad, and they&rsquo;ve been stopping these goods</p>
<p>because they say they&rsquo;re under EU sanction.</p>
<p>The problem is, listen, when you think about a sanction,</p>
<p>a sanction is me not buying goods from you</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair game.</p>
<p>Everyone has a choice over who they want to buy from.</p>
<p>But this is not that.</p>
<p>This is Lithuania deciding to stop goods</p>
<p>going from Russia to Russia.</p>
<p>And so the Russians say this is a blockade,</p>
<p>I think with some justification,</p>
<p>and blockades are understood to be an act of war.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got Lithuania basically engaging</p>
<p>in this act of escalation against Russia.</p>
<p>We always thought it would be Poland, but it&rsquo;s Lithuania.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>And remember, Lithuania is a member of NATO,</p>
<p>so they have an Article V guarantee.</p>
<p>Now, think about the upside versus downside of this action.</p>
<p>In terms of from the Western point of view,</p>
<p>the upside is this has absolutely no impact</p>
<p>on the outcome of the war.</p>
<p>This is not gonna help anyone in Ukraine</p>
<p>to blockade Kaliningrad and prevent coal</p>
<p>and building materials and steel from reaching Kaliningrad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna have any impact on the war.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s zero upside to this from a military standpoint.</p>
<p>But the downside is that you now have Lithuania</p>
<p>and Russia getting into it.</p>
<p>And if they get into a war,</p>
<p>then we are instantly pulled in under Article V.</p>
<p>So this is the kind of dangerous escalatory act</p>
<p>that has no upside, only downside for us.</p>
<p>And my view on it is that we have to tell,</p>
<p>we have to instruct, frankly, our treaty allies</p>
<p>not to engage in these types of dangerous acts</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a huge externality.</p>
<p>We could be pulled in.</p>
<p>This is very dangerous.</p>
<p>And I just wonder if the administration is on top of this.</p>
<p>Did they give the green light to the Lithuanians to do this</p>
<p>or were they caught by surprise?</p>
<p>And what is the reaction to acts like this?</p>
<p>What I worry is that we&rsquo;re conducting foreign policy</p>
<p>by virtue signaling, where we just say,</p>
<p>who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?</p>
<p>And if the Russians are the bad guys,</p>
<p>Lithuanians are the good guys, so therefore this is okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like playing cops and robbers on a global stage.</p>
<p>I think we need to be asking the question,</p>
<p>is this smart or is it dumb?</p>
<p>Is this prudential or is it reckless?</p>
<p>Is this in our interest or is it not in our interest?</p>
<p>And I really got to wonder about</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s mining the store on this.</p>
<p>Day 120, and it feels like this is just,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have an end in sight.</p>
<p>Is there an end in sight here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the end?</p>
<p>I mean, the end is a negotiation.</p>
<p>I mean, what do the two parties want?</p>
<p>Yeah, what do the two parties want at this point?</p>
<p>I mean, the people in Russia are suffering during this.</p>
<p>The people in the Ukraine are being murdered,</p>
<p>in Ukraine are being murdered.</p>
<p>I mean, how does it end at this point?</p>
<p>The problem is that Biden engaged the United States</p>
<p>in a proxy war without our real explicit discussion,</p>
<p>number one.</p>
<p>And then number two is then we pulled</p>
<p>and we pressured Europe to really draw a hard line,</p>
<p>but then now are kind of working around it</p>
<p>so that the countries that suffer the most are Europe.</p>
<p>Now, I think you starting to see the tea leaves though.</p>
<p>Last week, there was a group of European leaders.</p>
<p>I think it was Macron, Draghi, and I can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>if it was the German chancellor or not,</p>
<p>and one other person who went to Ukraine.</p>
<p>And if I had to bet, I think the message was kind of like,</p>
<p>all right, listen, we need to find an organized detente here</p>
<p>because there is, according to Europe,</p>
<p>a Lehman-like situation in terms of economic contagion</p>
<p>that could manifest over the next months.</p>
<p>I think that the end game is probably some organized,</p>
<p>negotiated detente and ceasefire.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody will be happy with it,</p>
<p>but I think by and large, Russia is and has won,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;ve won economically.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re selling oil like it&rsquo;s going out of style.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not selling it to Europe and to America.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re selling it to China, they&rsquo;re selling it to Africa,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re selling it to India.</p>
<p>If they have time with it, they&rsquo;ll take some cheap oil.</p>
<p>Well, also, Chamath, they&rsquo;ve won,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re winning on the battlefield.</p>
<p>There was an article in the Washington Post,</p>
<p>there was an article in the Washington Post</p>
<p>in the last week or so, and the Washington Post</p>
<p>is basically the house organ of the Washington establishment</p>
<p>and the blob, basically saying that hopes are dimming</p>
<p>for Ukraine on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The Russians have now won 20 to 25% of the country.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve won that eastern, that Donbass region.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done it with the help of Russian separatists</p>
<p>in Ukraine, and the amazing thing in this article</p>
<p>was that they were saying that the Ukrainians</p>
<p>were days away from running out of ammunition,</p>
<p>despite the 40 billion that we just appropriated to them.</p>
<p>Where did that money go?</p>
<p>And conversely, they&rsquo;re saying Russia&rsquo;s having</p>
<p>just unbelievable casualties,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re running out of weapons,</p>
<p>and they are obviously out of Kiev now,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in the Donbass mostly.</p>
<p>So, it does seem like both-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Russians are running out of anything.</p>
<p>The Russians, so listen, I said on this pod,</p>
<p>three weeks ago- Well, they said</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re out of tanks, right?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve adjusted their strategy,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re learning, they&rsquo;re adapting</p>
<p>to this new kind of warfare, this asymmetric warfare,</p>
<p>where you can take out a tank with a drone, you know?</p>
<p>But look, remember on this pod, three weeks into the war,</p>
<p>everybody who was in favor of this proxy war</p>
<p>was saying how great it was, and they were saying</p>
<p>it was gonna lead to a new birth of freedom in the West,</p>
<p>that it was strengthening our alliances.</p>
<p>You had Francis Fukuyama predicting</p>
<p>that we were gonna win the war,</p>
<p>and it would lead to this rebirth of freedom in the West.</p>
<p>We should have known at that moment.</p>
<p>Everything that Fukuyama basically predicts,</p>
<p>the opposite comes true. He&rsquo;s always wrong.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s always wrong. He&rsquo;s always wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like negative one correlation.</p>
<p>And remember, I said three weeks in</p>
<p>that we were potentially, I think Putin made the mistake</p>
<p>in the first three weeks of thinking this would be</p>
<p>a cakewalk, but that we were making the mistake</p>
<p>of thinking the next phase would be a cakewalk.</p>
<p>And sure enough, here we are.</p>
<p>Russia has now won the eastern part of the country.</p>
<p>Just to build on what you said,</p>
<p>we engage in economic sanctions,</p>
<p>and I was the first one to say,</p>
<p>hey, this could really work,</p>
<p>and this could be a roadmap for how to do it.</p>
<p>And it turned out this is the roadmap for how not to do it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t on the front door say, here are these sanctions,</p>
<p>and then walk around the back door</p>
<p>and basically open the door for them.</p>
<p>These sanctions were so porous as to be like Swiss cheese.</p>
<p>We focused on virtue signaling acts like confiscating a plane</p>
<p>or a boat or a house, but we didn&rsquo;t focus</p>
<p>on the structural things we needed to actually</p>
<p>make the mandate that we believe to be just to come to life.</p>
<p>And so Russia&rsquo;s completely worked around it.</p>
<p>Their economy effectively is thriving.</p>
<p>So what have we gained?</p>
<p>How is it thriving?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know that thriving</p>
<p>is how they would describe their economy right now, yeah.</p>
<p>I mentioned this- Jason, they&rsquo;re printing</p>
<p>record surpluses. The rubles</p>
<p>that are five-year high, Jason.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re selling gas, they&rsquo;re selling phosphate,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually making a market,</p>
<p>and the prices have doubled and tripled in those commodities</p>
<p>because the flow has been restricted.</p>
<p>It was the exact opposite of what we tried to do.</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;ll point out something</p>
<p>that I pointed out in February,</p>
<p>which was the biggest concern for me at the time.</p>
<p>When we stopped allowing trading</p>
<p>in the securities of Russian companies,</p>
<p>we yanked away $400 billion of market cap</p>
<p>that was held primarily by pension funds</p>
<p>and retirement funds in the US and Europe,</p>
<p>and gave that value to Russia for free.</p>
<p>We basically said, here you go,</p>
<p>here are all these securities.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re no longer allowed to trade in them.</p>
<p>So guess what?</p>
<p>You guys can trade in them.</p>
<p>You can have them.</p>
<p>They got all of their gas and energy</p>
<p>and nickel and mining companies for free.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s such a good point.</p>
<p>For zero, they paid $0 for these companies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>We gave them, we ripped the stock out of retirement funds</p>
<p>and we gave it to the Russians and said,</p>
<p>here you go, Putin, take all of these securities for free.</p>
<p>Enjoy, oh, and by the way,</p>
<p>because of our idiotic sanctions</p>
<p>and the way we&rsquo;re employing them,</p>
<p>the commodity prices are gonna double and triple</p>
<p>and all these companies are gonna have</p>
<p>record profits this year.</p>
<p>Happy fucking birthday.</p>
<p>The ruble&rsquo;s up five X.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not up five X, but yeah, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great point because if Putin had retaliated</p>
<p>against the West by nationalizing 400 billion</p>
<p>of Western assets in Russia,</p>
<p>everyone would have been up in arms.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t even have to do that</p>
<p>because we just gave him the 400 billion.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I mean, how did this policy make sense?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this policy of conducting, again,</p>
<p>of conducting foreign-</p>
<p>You cannot trade in Russian securities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m frigging BlackRock.</p>
<p>I own a billion dollars of Russian securities.</p>
<p>The US government just took it out of my portfolio</p>
<p>that my clients own stakes in</p>
<p>and gave it to the Russians for free.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>Poof.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>I think, listen, I think we&rsquo;ve got like a two-level problem</p>
<p>on this Ukraine war.</p>
<p>One is that our policy hasn&rsquo;t made sense.</p>
<p>We should have been using diplomacy last year to avoid it.</p>
<p>We had all these false hopes around strengthening the West</p>
<p>and the Western alliance by allowing this war to happen.</p>
<p>We then, instead of trying to shut it down</p>
<p>through a negotiated settlement,</p>
<p>we tried to use it as a proxy war to weaken Putin.</p>
<p>Instead, it&rsquo;s done the opposite.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole series of policy failures here,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s another deeper level to the failure,</p>
<p>which is the personnel who are implementing these policies,</p>
<p>the Washington establishment, the blob,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been, of both parties, the sort of uni party,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been implementing these policies.</p>
<p>There has been no dissent</p>
<p>within the Washington establishment.</p>
<p>The only guy who really spoke up in a decisive way</p>
<p>was John Mearsheimer,</p>
<p>the professor of international relations</p>
<p>from the University of Chicago,</p>
<p>and he was treated as a pariah</p>
<p>by the blob in the Washington establishment.</p>
<p>Everything he predicted has come true.</p>
<p>He predicted this years ago, years ago.</p>
<p>He predicted the US was leading Ukraine</p>
<p>down the primrose path,</p>
<p>and the result was that Ukraine was gonna get wrecked,</p>
<p>and so it has.</p>
<p>Can I just read the first paragraph</p>
<p>of this Bloomberg article that I just posted?</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s current account surplus more than tripled</p>
<p>in the first four months of the year to 95.8 billion.</p>
<p>The central bank said,</p>
<p>as prices surge for its oil and gas imports</p>
<p>and imports plunged under the weight of sanctions.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re Putin and you&rsquo;re looking at this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, wow,</p>
<p>maybe I should be under sanctions more often.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>What country should I invade next?</p>
<p>All that sanctions were was a restriction</p>
<p>on the free market,</p>
<p>and when you restricted the free market,</p>
<p>you basically created a spike in price,</p>
<p>but his market could still operate</p>
<p>with a narrower set of trading partners.</p>
<p>He is selling energy to certain trading partners,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s selling phosphates, he&rsquo;s making money,</p>
<p>they are exporting product,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re making more</p>
<p>because certain people can&rsquo;t buy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got to go drive the price up elsewhere.</p>
<p>So not only did our sanctions package not work,</p>
<p>and not only is the treasury flailing around now</p>
<p>trying to find even more back doors,</p>
<p>we actually opened a very dangerous precedent,</p>
<p>which is now we allowed oil to settle in currencies</p>
<p>that are not just the United States dollar.</p>
<p>And now Russia and China are trading and settling in CNY.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not good for us.</p>
<p>This is not how you preserve the integrity</p>
<p>of the reserve currency of America.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the EU of cutting all of their energy</p>
<p>and then becoming dependent on Russia,</p>
<p>then creating a ban and sanctions,</p>
<p>but then they made a carve out that oil delivered</p>
<p>by pipeline.</p>
<p>Janet Yellen has been negotiating this carve out.</p>
<p>We have been enabling Russia to sell.</p>
<p>We.</p>
<p>No, the EU passed this legislation.</p>
<p>Jason, look in the Wall Street Journal today,</p>
<p>the article is there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading the CNBC right now about it.</p>
<p>Like the EU passed this landmark sanctions package in May,</p>
<p>but they also allowed the stuff that&rsquo;s coming by pipeline</p>
<p>for some reason to be a carve out.</p>
<p>If the EU wants to contain Putin from invading countries</p>
<p>on their doorstep,</p>
<p>they got to actually become energy independent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beginning and end of this.</p>
<p>It is not popular.</p>
<p>And this is the problem with populism.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not popular?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not popular to continue to have energy independent.</p>
<p>Nuclear was not popular.</p>
<p>And so the politicians,</p>
<p>the legislators responded in a short sighted way</p>
<p>to the popular opinion of the day.</p>
<p>And this is the challenge.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Huge mistake on German&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>They closed three nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>Popular sentiment in Europe got highly affected</p>
<p>by these environmental groups.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>But in the US,</p>
<p>I think the people of the country</p>
<p>want us to be energy independent.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s elite opinion that bought into these foolish ideas</p>
<p>that basically we should cancel energy independence.</p>
<p>We should cancel the Keystone pipeline.</p>
<p>Job number one.</p>
<p>We should cancel new drilling.</p>
<p>America should be a net energy exporter.</p>
<p>Job number one is to be energy independent.</p>
<p>And job number two is to move to renewables.</p>
<p>But look at Biden now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another piece to this, right?</p>
<p>You gotta do this in sequence.</p>
<p>So when he came in,</p>
<p>he said that he was gonna make the Saudis a pariah</p>
<p>on the world stage.</p>
<p>Remember this?</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s going hat in hand to them</p>
<p>to try and get them to produce more oil and lower the price.</p>
<p>So what was the point of this foreign policy?</p>
<p>It was contradictory.</p>
<p>He cancels their energy independence.</p>
<p>He basically insults the Saudis</p>
<p>on which we&rsquo;re even more dependent for oil.</p>
<p>And then he basically refuses</p>
<p>to engage in diplomacy on Ukraine.</p>
<p>These policies are contradictory.</p>
<p>Even if your goal was to basically isolate the Russians,</p>
<p>you would then want to improve our relationship with Saudi.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d want to produce more of our own oil.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Yeah, he overplayed his hand for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t not have heat in the winter in Germany</p>
<p>and the Germans are completely-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming by the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>You think things are bad right now, wait until winter.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s only gonna increase Putin&rsquo;s leverage.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re gonna see a real fracture</p>
<p>in the Western alliance.</p>
<p>This idea that Ukraine strengthened the Western alliance,</p>
<p>I think you will start to see the fractures</p>
<p>come this winter.</p>
<p>Nationalism-</p>
<p>I mean, Germany&rsquo;s gotta put those nukes back online.</p>
<p>The slow march of nationalism will continue</p>
<p>and this will be another catalyzing event for it.</p>
<p>Turn your nukes back on, Germany.</p>
<p>And I also think that,</p>
<p>in thinking about the Western alliance,</p>
<p>I think that countries like Germany and France</p>
<p>are really gonna question U.S. leadership</p>
<p>when they have basically a huge economic recession</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re wondering how they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>heat their homes in the winter.</p>
<p>But I think in the U.S. it&rsquo;s time to reevaluate</p>
<p>some of the alliances that we&rsquo;ve gotten ourselves in.</p>
<p>Again, with this Lithuania situation,</p>
<p>do you really think that Lithuania would be</p>
<p>basically poking that big Russian bear</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t have the U.S. standing behind them</p>
<p>as a bodyguard?</p>
<p>No way, they would be much more circumspect and prudential.</p>
<p>And the fact of the matter is</p>
<p>that these Eastern European countries,</p>
<p>the Baltic countries, and Poland,</p>
<p>they have enmities, they have friction</p>
<p>with Russia going back hundreds of years.</p>
<p>And these guys basically,</p>
<p>they have very provocative attitudes towards Russia</p>
<p>and our alliance with them can draw us in.</p>
<p>So we have to really keep a close lid on that.</p>
<p>We do not want them making moves on their own</p>
<p>because we could get drawn into a world war here.</p>
<p>Yeah, and by the way, to your point, Sax,</p>
<p>also, there continues to be escalating issues</p>
<p>with debt and concerns about debt repayment across the EU.</p>
<p>And while Germany is looking to the U.S. for support</p>
<p>and worried about energy prices,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna end up having to foot the bill</p>
<p>to support a bunch of these EU member nations</p>
<p>that are facing debt crises</p>
<p>and will continue to face significant debt crises</p>
<p>over the years ahead.</p>
<p>I mean, Greece made a payment recently,</p>
<p>but Greece&rsquo;s debt to GDP is still over 200%.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s at 155%.</p>
<p>Portugal&rsquo;s at 134%.</p>
<p>I mean, the numbers are pretty significant</p>
<p>and as rates climb.</p>
<p>I mean, you saw it today.</p>
<p>You know, it was.</p>
<p>Yeah, the spread on Italian debt</p>
<p>has spiked over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Spiked, Bridgewater basically is big as short.</p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s got another frigging crisis to fight now.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The Western alliance is more than just military</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this, you know,</p>
<p>do I really wanna be the economic savior</p>
<p>over and over again of my smaller member states?</p>
<p>And guess who&rsquo;s gonna benefit in all of this?</p>
<p>China.</p>
<p>Like, they&rsquo;re gonna look at this fracturing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna be like, great.</p>
<p>By the way, just speaking of China for a second,</p>
<p>you know, we talk on,</p>
<p>we bloviate about our desire for energy independence</p>
<p>and, you know, we exclude Tesla from, you know,</p>
<p>any sort of major meaningful legislation.</p>
<p>We trumpet, you know,</p>
<p>these companies that are just completely woefully behind</p>
<p>in building energy independence.</p>
<p>We think about like a gas tax holiday,</p>
<p>but as like kind of like a, you know,</p>
<p>something that still needs an act of Congress to pass,</p>
<p>even though Congress has said</p>
<p>they have absolutely no intention of passing it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we keep losing our footing to China.</p>
<p>Just today, CATL,</p>
<p>which is one of the largest battery manufacturers,</p>
<p>announced a pretty meaningful improvement</p>
<p>in their, you know, 3.0 battery design.</p>
<p>These guys are now building batteries</p>
<p>that can go a thousand kilometers</p>
<p>in both of the major, you know,</p>
<p>compositions that really matter, NMC and LFP.</p>
<p>And I just look at these things and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>wow, we cannot actually get capacity funded</p>
<p>to build domestic battery capability</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re too busy kind of basically virtue signaling</p>
<p>on things that don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And in return, nothing happens.</p>
<p>China continues to lap us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really bad state of affairs.</p>
<p>We are in a very odd period</p>
<p>in terms of government effectiveness.</p>
<p>If you think about China&rsquo;s foreign policy,</p>
<p>how have they lost out</p>
<p>by not being part of all these conflicts?</p>
<p>How have they lost out?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re buying prices of oil</p>
<p>that were nine months ago to 18 months ago.</p>
<p>And so there not only has Russia&rsquo;s output price been capped,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s input cost has been capped.</p>
<p>And so they don&rsquo;t suffer the same rate of inflation</p>
<p>that the rest of us do.</p>
<p>So to your point, David, you know,</p>
<p>our quote unquote, you know,</p>
<p>exclusionary sanctions were ineffective.</p>
<p>They were porous and we allowed</p>
<p>our largest competitive frenemy, if you will,</p>
<p>to basically be able to, you know,</p>
<p>drive their entire economy at 30 to 40% of the discount</p>
<p>to what we have to pay to do the same.</p>
<p>When China goes abroad,</p>
<p>they go abroad in search of economic resources</p>
<p>and economic development.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point of Belt and Road.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t insert themselves</p>
<p>in these middle of these conflicts</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>They were never involved in the Middle East.</p>
<p>They were never involved in like policing,</p>
<p>you know, all these different countries.</p>
<p>That has cost us a fortune.</p>
<p>And now the bill is finally coming due</p>
<p>in the form of this inflation.</p>
<p>We are gonna have some form or another</p>
<p>of austerity in this country.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s partly because</p>
<p>of this highly militarized foreign policy</p>
<p>in which we have sent ourselves abroad</p>
<p>to be the world&rsquo;s policemen.</p>
<p>We can no longer afford to do that.</p>
<p>Can I make a generalization, Sachs?</p>
<p>You react and tell me if this is true or not.</p>
<p>If you have a country that has existed</p>
<p>in some way, shape or form, you know,</p>
<p>the borders could be blurry,</p>
<p>but roughly for hundreds and hundreds of years,</p>
<p>and in some cases, thousands of years,</p>
<p>where internally the population</p>
<p>of that country views themselves, you know,</p>
<p>in a great way.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t feel like their country</p>
<p>is a meaningless nothing country.</p>
<p>Any attempt to economically humiliate such a country</p>
<p>tends to have failed in the past</p>
<p>and will continue to fail.</p>
<p>And there tends to be other countries</p>
<p>who view it as one of these things where,</p>
<p>well, if them, then why not us?</p>
<p>And then they sort of, you know,</p>
<p>in a backhanded way, support everybody.</p>
<p>So we end up in this odd situation</p>
<p>where we are picking fights we cannot win.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And the consequences for us</p>
<p>are economically really damaging.</p>
<p>Right, absolutely.</p>
<p>And then the consequences for everybody else</p>
<p>to stay on the sidelines is like economic prosperity.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re in Europe and you&rsquo;re afraid</p>
<p>that Russia is going to roll over more countries</p>
<p>and that you have this existential risk</p>
<p>that this dictator is going to attack more countries.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re living in Eastern Europe,</p>
<p>you might have a different view of it.</p>
<p>You might very much accept and want some help</p>
<p>from, you know, NATO and other folks who-</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not getting that help.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sad part about all of this.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if it&rsquo;s poorly executed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not working at this point in time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a valid criticism.</p>
<p>If you look at the EU, okay, as an entity,</p>
<p>they have almost the same GDP and output as the US.</p>
<p>And if you compare them to Russia,</p>
<p>their economy, their GDP is 10 times greater than Russia.</p>
<p>They are rich.</p>
<p>They can afford to allocate a few percent of their GDP,</p>
<p>of their government budget to defense.</p>
<p>They should be able to defend themselves.</p>
<p>They really should.</p>
<p>And so this idea that we have to go over to Europe</p>
<p>and bankrupt ourselves to defend rich Europeans,</p>
<p>they should be picking up 100% of the cost of that, 100%.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why we&rsquo;re paying for rich Europeans</p>
<p>when our country is massively in debt.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t we passing the bill to them for that?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we&rsquo;re absolutely,</p>
<p>yeah, do we have to spend that much money to do that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And then obviously the wars in the Middle East were</p>
<p>just disastrous. Let me pick up</p>
<p>on this world&rsquo;s policemen idea.</p>
<p>What kind of policing works the best?</p>
<p>Community policing.</p>
<p>When the policemen are from the neighborhood</p>
<p>and they know all the players,</p>
<p>they understand the subtlety of the area.</p>
<p>Yeah, boots on the ground.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The U.S. has made itself the world&rsquo;s policemen.</p>
<p>We parachute into areas that we don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>We did in the Middle East.</p>
<p>It was very ineffective.</p>
<p>What we should do is let the regions deal</p>
<p>with the problems themselves first.</p>
<p>And we should be the policemen of last resort,</p>
<p>not first resort.</p>
<p>Let the Europeans take the lead.</p>
<p>They should be paying for their own defense.</p>
<p>You know, we could still have NATO,</p>
<p>but they should be paying for it.</p>
<p>They should be the first responders.</p>
<p>And if they can&rsquo;t handle it, then we can back them up.</p>
<p>But this idea that we need to be on the bleeding edge</p>
<p>of all these conflicts, bankrupting ourselves,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a foolish idea.</p>
<p>Energy independence is a solution to all of this.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with these despots</p>
<p>if we had energy independence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting circles run around us by China, Jason,</p>
<p>on the innovations front.</p>
<p>Circles run around us by China on the innovation front.</p>
<p>Example?</p>
<p>I just told you, the CATL battery</p>
<p>that they just announced today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, battery technologies,</p>
<p>we have a lot going on there as well.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like the battery technology issue</p>
<p>has been solved for EVs for some time now.</p>
<p>I mean, if an EV can go 200 miles</p>
<p>and we can build them at scale,</p>
<p>which seems like we&rsquo;re on the precipice of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be good.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need more than 200 miles on average.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a luxury every mile after that,</p>
<p>given how fast superchargers are working.</p>
<p>So just practically speaking,</p>
<p>95% of Americans will do just fine</p>
<p>with a electric car that does 200 mile range.</p>
<p>And the other 5% can do a hybrid or can still burn oil.</p>
<p>We just need to get more.</p>
<p>We have to be more serious about the miles per gallon.</p>
<p>Right now, we are just absolutely abhorrent</p>
<p>in our use of fuel in this country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just crazy that we have low 20 miles per gallon</p>
<p>as our average when other countries are 30, 40, 50,</p>
<p>or 30 and 40.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because we like our seven seat suburbans.</p>
<p>Which is ridiculous</p>
<p>because 99 out of a hundred missions in that suburban</p>
<p>are done with one or two people in it.</p>
<p>The fact that our Ubers and our Lyfts or whatever</p>
<p>are coming with giant suburbans with one person in it</p>
<p>is just ridiculous.</p>
<p>I have a Fiat E500 here, like a little mini.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, this is why, I mean, this is the path.</p>
<p>If we can just, if you just think about it,</p>
<p>if we were to double our miles per gallon,</p>
<p>there are cars right now that are doing 50, 55</p>
<p>miles per gallon.</p>
<p>We really have to be more punitive</p>
<p>in terms of taxation on the SUVs.</p>
<p>Give me the forecast, J. Cal,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen with Biden?</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So I guess.</p>
<p>Give me your scorecard.</p>
<p>Give me your grade.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s he doing?</p>
<p>For Biden?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s disastrous.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the only thing more disastrous than Biden</p>
<p>would be having Trump do a second, third, and fourth term.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>So play it out, play it out.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s going to run again.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re going to have to put another candidate.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think Biden&rsquo;s going to run again?</p>
<p>I think there, I think between then and now,</p>
<p>if the economy keeps going the way it&rsquo;s going,</p>
<p>he would be a lame duck and impossible.</p>
<p>And I think he might say, you know what,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to retire to spend time with my kids</p>
<p>and my golden years.</p>
<p>And they might convince him that him running again</p>
<p>is a really bad idea.</p>
<p>And Kamala Harris is a disaster as well.</p>
<p>She hasn&rsquo;t proven anything in the first two years.</p>
<p>Yeah, who would the Dems put up?</p>
<p>J. Cal, J. Cal, as a Democrat,</p>
<p>who would you want to have put up?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be DeSantis versus Newsom in 24.</p>
<p>I, yeah, I.</p>
<p>But sorry, explain that.</p>
<p>Okay, so, but which part of it, Newsom or DeSantis?</p>
<p>How does Newsom get the nod?</p>
<p>Okay, so Newsom has a very weak challenger in California.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a plus 30 Dem state.</p>
<p>But can he win?</p>
<p>Hold on, so he&rsquo;s going to handily win</p>
<p>re-election in California.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already, he&rsquo;s not even campaigning</p>
<p>for re-election in California.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already campaigning to be president.</p>
<p>The thing that he did that was politically smart,</p>
<p>and I say this not as a fan of Newsom,</p>
<p>but just as someone who&rsquo;s analyzing the politics of it,</p>
<p>is that he went on true social</p>
<p>and to basically counter Republican lies.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s positioning himself</p>
<p>as a fighter for progressive values.</p>
<p>And the reason why that&rsquo;s going to be flattering</p>
<p>to the Democratic base is that</p>
<p>when the Democrats lose big in November,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to have, there&rsquo;s going to be a reckoning.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to have to understand why they lost.</p>
<p>And the fact of the matter is that</p>
<p>ideologues never blame themselves or their agenda.</p>
<p>They are going to say that it was not communicated well,</p>
<p>and that we needed a basically a better communicator</p>
<p>who was a fighter.</p>
<p>And so they will basically pin the blame</p>
<p>even more on Biden.</p>
<p>And so Newsom is positioning himself</p>
<p>as that sort of Democratic progressive fighter.</p>
<p>If you go back, remember when Michael Avenatti,</p>
<p>like they were, you know,</p>
<p>progressives were talking about him</p>
<p>as a presidential candidate for a brief minute.</p>
<p>They swooned over him.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t he go to jail?</p>
<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s in jail right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s a total grifter scumbag.</p>
<p>A total grifter scumbag.</p>
<p>But you got to remember CNN had him on there every day</p>
<p>because he was a fighter.</p>
<p>J. Cal says his name in the funniest way possible.</p>
<p>I remember in our poker game</p>
<p>when like Helmuth said he had no numbers on it.</p>
<p>J. Cal, what&rsquo;s this guy&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>Say his name.</p>
<p>Michael Avenatti.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>I never met the guy.</p>
<p>Michael Avenatti.</p>
<p>Bada bing, bada boom, I&rsquo;m Michael Avenatti, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a disaster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting concept.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Zach, giving the Dems will give Newsom the nod.</p>
<p>Can he actually win in some of these middle states?</p>
<p>Well, you got to remember,</p>
<p>and this is true for both parties,</p>
<p>that the general electorate does not pick the candidates.</p>
<p>The parties pick the candidates</p>
<p>and the base of the party picks the candidates.</p>
<p>And they want to have a winner.</p>
<p>They want someone that can win Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>They want someone that can win Florida.</p>
<p>Yeah, but yes and no.</p>
<p>So if you remember when Bill Clinton</p>
<p>pulled the Democratic Party back to the center in 1992</p>
<p>and the whole Democratic Leadership Council,</p>
<p>and they really remade the Democratic Party</p>
<p>at that time as a more centrist party,</p>
<p>they had just come off</p>
<p>three disastrous presidential elections.</p>
<p>So Reagan in 80 and 84,</p>
<p>and then Herbert Walker Bush in 88.</p>
<p>So it took three big losses for them to rethink.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think progressives are gonna rethink their agenda</p>
<p>based on one midterm loss,</p>
<p>even though I think it&rsquo;s gonna be gargantuan</p>
<p>later this year.</p>
<p>So I think they need more losses</p>
<p>to really reevaluate their agenda.</p>
<p>I mean, look, the activists in the party</p>
<p>are deeply invested in their agenda.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not gonna give it up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna blame it on a communication problem.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna say, let&rsquo;s find a new messenger.</p>
<p>And Newsom will seem like a younger, fresh face.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s how it could happen.</p>
<p>And if you look at the Democratic bench,</p>
<p>who else they got?</p>
<p>Well, he can also say, can he also,</p>
<p>who else they got as the issue?</p>
<p>Who else they got?</p>
<p>I mean, Buttigieg.</p>
<p>You mean Elizabeth Warren?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>Buttigieg and AOC, if they wanna go full,</p>
<p>like crazy left, would be,</p>
<p>and then if they wanna go more moderate, Gavin.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t win an election.</p>
<p>You gotta find someone that can win the election, so.</p>
<p>I agree, I agree.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s gonna be about turnout.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna say that Newsom is the governor</p>
<p>of a big state, which is, as of now,</p>
<p>$100 billion surplus looks good for him.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, Gavin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scenario.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scenario.</p>
<p>But look, I think the Republicans.</p>
<p>The big question is,</p>
<p>will the Republicans field Trump after January 6th?</p>
<p>And I.</p>
<p>I think the answer is no, and.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too shameful, right, to do that?</p>
<p>I think that, look, I think Trump&rsquo;s problem</p>
<p>is he won&rsquo;t stop talking about the last election.</p>
<p>And I think elections are always about the future.</p>
<p>And the Republicans ultimately are gonna nominate</p>
<p>a candidate who represents the future.</p>
<p>No Republicans want him as going out there</p>
<p>trying to steal an election again.</p>
<p>No Republicans want that on their hands.</p>
<p>If you look at straw polls, okay,</p>
<p>if you look at straw polling,</p>
<p>DeSantis now is beating Trump in straw polls</p>
<p>in the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Jonathan Chait, who is a pretty smart liberal,</p>
<p>definitely not a Republican,</p>
<p>but he sometimes has very smart observations.</p>
<p>Remember the whole zero COVID thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, he has an article just today</p>
<p>talking about how DeSantis has now eclipsed Trump</p>
<p>within the Republican base.</p>
<p>And if you look at the numbers within,</p>
<p>if you poll Fox News viewers</p>
<p>and likely Republican primary voters,</p>
<p>DeSantis is up a couple of points in the straw polls,</p>
<p>but among Fox News viewers, he&rsquo;s up like 10 to 14 points.</p>
<p>So in other words, the Republican base,</p>
<p>the activists who are the influencers,</p>
<p>they already have moved from Trump to DeSantis.</p>
<p>No, they love him, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I think the field-</p>
<p>Also, I mean, if DeSantis runs,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna win a landslide.</p>
<p>This is why I say it&rsquo;s DeSantis versus Newsom, I think.</p>
<p>But look, it could be DeSantis versus Biden.</p>
<p>It could even be Trump versus Newsom.</p>
<p>I think the configurations that win for the Republicans,</p>
<p>I think if Biden&rsquo;s on the ticket,</p>
<p>I think any Republican wins.</p>
<p>I think if it&rsquo;s DeSantis versus Newsom,</p>
<p>I think DeSantis wins.</p>
<p>I think, however,</p>
<p>and this is sort of the nightmare scenario,</p>
<p>I think if it&rsquo;s something like a Newsom versus Trump,</p>
<p>I think Republicans could lose that</p>
<p>just because the people-</p>
<p>People think about the future.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna be reminded of the past.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s risks there.</p>
<p>No more octogenarians.</p>
<p>Also, the past is insane and deranged.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have two 80-year-olds running for president.</p>
<p>No more octogenarians.</p>
<p>That would be great, yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Nothing against octogenarians.</p>
<p>Hard cap at 75 years old would be good for me.</p>
<p>All right, this has been a very long episode.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, well,</p>
<p>considering how much Sachs is gonna spike,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get it back down to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>It was an amazing episode.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back. I love you guys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really nice to be back. We&rsquo;re not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Everybody relax. We&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>Jake Allen&rsquo;s back. I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna need a wrecking ball to take me out of here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna just send</p>
<p>him to the National Guard. We never wanted</p>
<p>to get rid of you, J-Cal.</p>
<p>J-Cal, we don&rsquo;t wanna get rid of you,</p>
<p>but now all we need is three out of four votes, so.</p>
<p>All right, good luck.</p>
<p>Vote me off.</p>
<p>We never wanted to get rid of you, J-Cal,</p>
<p>but we knew we had to do certain things</p>
<p>to get you to act right.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Oh boy, here it comes.</p>
<p>Here it comes.</p>
<p>J-Cal brought a knife to a gunfight.</p>
<p>He came to negotiate.</p>
<p>You guys don&rsquo;t want any intros.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re too cheap to give me two points.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>J-Cal came to negotiate the Treaty of Westphalia</p>
<p>and he left with half a Snickers bar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You guys don&rsquo;t get, no more intros for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a lot of scraps.</p>
<p>No more Holland Summit.</p>
<p>No more intros.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna hold back our payment.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m about to get on a call with our lawyers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get the account set up,</p>
<p>get all the money transferred from your Summit.</p>
<p>Yum, yum, yum.</p>
<p>Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.</p>
<p>Good luck with that money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s long gone.</p>
<p>I put that on the Warriors.</p>
<p>I tripled it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, we&rsquo;ll see you next time</p>
<p>on the All in One podcast.</p>
<p>Love you, boys.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sassman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And it said, we open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Sex.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avatar will meet me at&hellip;</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have this one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Let your, that&rsquo;ll be, let your be.</p>
<p>Let your be.</p>
<p>Be.</p>
<p>Let your be.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
