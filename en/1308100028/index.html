    <p>That was so good right off the bat.</p>
<p>That was a really good one.</p>
<p>Pabs, look at your cute little smile.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so proud of yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a low bar.</p>
<p>It is a very low bar.</p>
<p>Well Pabs, you know, I know you&rsquo;re happy and everything, but tell me what you&rsquo;ve had it</p>
<p>with this week.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve had it with is FaceTiming and not just, I mean, I have a million bitches about</p>
<p>FaceTime.</p>
<p>I can do that.</p>
<p>But in specific to today, my hate of FaceTime and what I&rsquo;ve had it with is that when somebody</p>
<p>FaceTimes me and I answer it, the person looking back at me, which is me, looks 110 years old.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, can&rsquo;t we put a filter on that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It is so bad.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t consider myself a particularly vain person, although did you know about the</p>
<p>badges at the courthouses?</p>
<p>So attorneys, you have to go through a metal detector and attorneys just, they can get</p>
<p>a badge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like $25.</p>
<p>You go get your picture made, whatever, you badge in.</p>
<p>Because my pictures look like an old woman and in my mind I&rsquo;m young and cute, I stand</p>
<p>in line with the criminals.</p>
<p>So I am a little bit more vain than I think I am.</p>
<p>I think everybody&rsquo;s vain.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just telling you, when I FaceTime, it is horrific.</p>
<p>No, I know exactly what you mean because in my mind, like you, I&rsquo;m around 30.</p>
<p>I have a little bit of age wrinkles, but they&rsquo;re the sexy kind and everything&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>and tight and I don&rsquo;t feel that mature as evidenced by the production of this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re profoundly immature.</p>
<p>And then I see in the FaceTime, I&rsquo;m like, who is that woman?</p>
<p>Who is she?</p>
<p>Who is, tell her to get Botox and filler and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s rough.</p>
<p>It is tough.</p>
<p>It is rough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really hard.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s bad enough that you can&rsquo;t do what you used to do, but just the looks department.</p>
<p>Like every time I watch one of these podcasts, I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t have a double chin in person,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m carrying around 15 double chins every time I look at a video.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just noticing today in your Barney the Dinosaur purple sweater, your boobs really</p>
<p>are ginormous.</p>
<p>I know, I hate them.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re awful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gigantic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>What size bra is that?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a 40D.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>I probably could go double D, but anyway, so back to the FaceTiming.</p>
<p>If somebody would stand on the top of a building for me and hold the phone, I look better if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking up because like gravity pulls it all back.</p>
<p>But the gravity, like you got to, if I&rsquo;m ever going to be on FaceTime, I need somebody on</p>
<p>a ladder holding it.</p>
<p>What are the people with stilts on at the circus?</p>
<p>Stilt people?</p>
<p>The stilt people.</p>
<p>I need a person that is on stilts.</p>
<p>But nobody FaceTimes me because they know I have a blanket, no FaceTiming at all.</p>
<p>Well, I used to FaceTime you and you wouldn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>And then you would get so mad at me because I wanted to see your face or show you something</p>
<p>and you are such an insufferable bitch when I FaceTime you.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I&rsquo;m an insufferable bitch when it&rsquo;s FaceTiming.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re wanting to show me something for a minute, I can do that, but it drives</p>
<p>me crazy when people FaceTime each other like if you and I were to FaceTime each other.</p>
<p>We see each other every day.</p>
<p>We know what each other look like.</p>
<p>Why on earth would we FaceTime all the time?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you the FaceTiming like, so my son goes to school in New York.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to FaceTime.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great way.</p>
<p>My son just had a baby and he lives in Georgia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen what the baby looks like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the baby smile, cooing.</p>
<p>And so there are benefits to FaceTime.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Out of state, people that live apart.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re shriveled up like a fucking raisin.</p>
<p>Which I guess I am.</p>
<p>Then you don&rsquo;t want to FaceTime.</p>
<p>And I clearly am a raisin because it is just, it&rsquo;s more than I can take.</p>
<p>Let me segue to what I&rsquo;ve had it with because bizarrely these are very in sync.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You live your life, okay?</p>
<p>And you see NFL football players and you think they&rsquo;re men, right?</p>
<p>And you go to the doctor and it&rsquo;s an adult.</p>
<p>And then you see basketball players, NBA players, and they&rsquo;re men.</p>
<p>And you see these models and they look like grown women.</p>
<p>And then something happens through time that all of a sudden these NFL football players</p>
<p>look like children and the NBA players look like children.</p>
<p>And the doctor walks into the room and they&rsquo;re younger than you are.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m starting to experience this.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like even if somebody&rsquo;s 10 years younger as an athlete, it&rsquo;s still kind of the same generation.</p>
<p>But when you get to 20, 25 years younger, it&rsquo;s jarring.</p>
<p>It is jarring because you&rsquo;re like, oh my God, he&rsquo;s 22.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or like some of the NBA players are like 19, our kid&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s weird about it is I remember watching football and thinking how cool it was.</p>
<p>You know, that they were older and they were playing football, you know, yada, yada, yada.</p>
<p>And then when I had my first child, I thought, oh my gosh, we&rsquo;re about the same age.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m the same age with the people that I&rsquo;m watching on TV.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m old enough to be their grandmother.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Did you just say that to be published on?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>I forget how much older you are than me.</p>
<p>Oh, fuck you.</p>
<p>That is not even true.</p>
<p>We could be grandmothers.</p>
<p>You speak for yourself.</p>
<p>No, but if we have 20-year-olds, I have a 22-year-old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mathematically possible.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to be broadcasting that energy.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying mathematically.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to be broadcasting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not broadcast.</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re grandmothers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not grandmothers.</p>
<p>A.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Zip it.</p>
<p>For God&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Are you going to have your grandchildren call you Ms. Welch?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m going to embrace it, but you don&rsquo;t just need to be over here blabbing all this</p>
<p>blasphemy about our age.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck has gotten into you, but I remember when I was younger,</p>
<p>my mother would be so offended if we referred to her as old and I never quite understood</p>
<p>it until you started with all this nonsense about us being old enough.</p>
<p>You need to zip it.</p>
<p>Welcome, everybody, to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>We call her Pumps.</p>
<p>Today we are going to talk about baby showers.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Sip and Cs.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Have you had it with those?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with all of those.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I have had it with those as well.</p>
<p>And we have a guest today.</p>
<p>Her name is Kristen Key.</p>
<p>She is a comedian, a musician, a crocheter, a very proud lesbian.</p>
<p>Hilarious.</p>
<p>I did a massive, massive deep dive into her Instagram account, and I think she has just</p>
<p>the type of smart cynicism that we&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast, Kristen Key.</p>
<p>Hi, Kristen.</p>
<p>Hi, we&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here together, the three of us, as we were intended to be.</p>
<p>I love your background.</p>
<p>Are those framed pictures of cats behind you?</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I was just introducing you, and I said she is a comedian, a musician, a crocheter,</p>
<p>a proud lesbian, and it looks like a cat lover.</p>
<p>A cat.</p>
<p>I love cats.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I have a cat, and I&rsquo;ve had it with my cat.</p>
<p>My cat&rsquo;s got diabetes.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s overweight.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s lazy as fuck.</p>
<p>And I think she could potentially be a Trump supporter.</p>
<p>I think you just ought to put that cat down.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I take care of her.</p>
<p>I give her her insulin, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re compatible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had her since 2009, but we&rsquo;ve just drifted.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;ve drifted.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You sound like Angela Martin from The Office.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve got to give her her insulin.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to give her my death store.</p>
<p>So we want to talk about what you&rsquo;ve had it with today.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Where do we begin?</p>
<p>First, right off the bat, it&rsquo;s baby showers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with baby showers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I got out of baby showers for several years because when I got sober, I said, that is</p>
<p>one thing I will never do again, and I used that as my card.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t go to a baby shower.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that was my hill to die.</p>
<p>I was like, it&rsquo;ll make me drink.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so miserable.</p>
<p>I mean, you get like one card when you get sober.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, I can play it.</p>
<p>Not very often, but I played it at baby showers.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m not going to baby shower.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a trigger for me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I just hate them so much.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s genius, though, actually.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s worth getting sober just to skip a lot of baby showers.</p>
<p>My husband&rsquo;s in recovery, too, so we&rsquo;re able to get out of a lot of shit because of it.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s a wonderful card.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely awesome.</p>
<p>What is your least favorite part of a baby shower?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to hold a baby.</p>
<p>See, I don&rsquo;t like babies to begin with, so I don&rsquo;t want to hold a baby, but you like</p>
<p>babies.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wish it was more like it&rsquo;s a baby shower.</p>
<p>Everybody gets a baby when you show up, and you get to have the baby the whole time, and</p>
<p>then you leave the party.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, thank you.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s just like you just have to go around and be around a bunch of women and</p>
<p>not in a fun way.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We did a little research about baby showers before you came on, and there was a Reddit</p>
<p>thread.</p>
<p>And here are some of the worst gifts that expecting mothers have received at a baby</p>
<p>shower.</p>
<p>One woman received a cross for her Jewish child from her mother-in-law at her baby shower.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>I hate the mother-in-law.</p>
<p>Total C-U-N-T.</p>
<p>I mean, total.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was on purpose.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even want to say the balls, but the ovaries on that woman.</p>
<p>Because I was saying if it was from someone who, if it&rsquo;s the Midwest, you don&rsquo;t know someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Jewish, the Midwest, a cross for everything.</p>
<p>You have a cross, and you have a cross, and look under your chair.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s someone that full on knows that you&rsquo;re Jewish, you&rsquo;re like, this will fix you, cross</p>
<p>for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s a bitch.</p>
<p>That is a bitch right there.</p>
<p>Total bitch.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Another woman received a card from her sister-in-law saying, I know you&rsquo;re not ready to be a mom,</p>
<p>and I hope you don&rsquo;t mess up your child, but here are the what to expect when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>expecting books.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin with this woman.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is editing.</p>
<p>This was a card edit.</p>
<p>This should have been a, you write it, and you show it to your spouse, and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>maybe just like, congrats.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to congratulations?</p>
<p>Maybe not go to the shower.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re such a bitch, don&rsquo;t go to the shower.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>People are getting these onesies.</p>
<p>So you know these, you know, adults wear shirts with words, and then they project the shirts</p>
<p>with words onto children, and they come in the form of onesies.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s one that says, I&rsquo;m not milk drunk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tit-faced.</p>
<p>What every baby needs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>Made in va-china.</p>
<p>The kid doesn&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>The kid has no choice.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s put in this.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It is now the spokesperson for tit-faced.</p>
<p>Tit-faced.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think about baby showers.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re kind of insufferable because you have this circle jerk of women that are</p>
<p>going around holding up these horrific onesies.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, baby showers are a big grift.</p>
<p>We all know it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to get people.</p>
<p>And listen, I have had baby showers posted for me.</p>
<p>I have two children.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s had baby showers hosted for her.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re a huge part of the problem.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No doubt.</p>
<p>As you know, as you should.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But we just hate them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;re miserable.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s bring up, have you ever heard, Kristen, of a baby sprinkle?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the, wait, is this the second kid?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Second or third or fourth?</p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And you still want to party and gifts?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So instead of a shower, a rain shower, it&rsquo;s a little sprinkle.</p>
<p>So I had never heard of this until about six months ago.</p>
<p>A girl that I adore sends me a text, a screenshot of an invitation, and it says, please come</p>
<p>to the baby sprinkle.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, what the hell is a sprinkle?</p>
<p>So I Google it, and it&rsquo;s a millennial thing where, you know, because they celebrate everything.</p>
<p>Everything is produced and celebrated.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a baby sprinkle that they&rsquo;re having now for the second kid and, or the third or</p>
<p>the fourth.</p>
<p>And so not only have you had to go to the gender reveal, watch all the shit on Instagram,</p>
<p>the nonstop, this is the first person that has ever bred and is producing a child on</p>
<p>the planet.</p>
<p>Then you go to the baby shower, then you go to the sip and see, then you go to the fucking</p>
<p>diaper drive, and then they&rsquo;re just knocking out another one again.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got a baby sprinkle.</p>
<p>A baby sprinkle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never ending.</p>
<p>First, they need to change the name to, oops, we did it again.</p>
<p>More people would come and maybe make it Britney themed, but it&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much for one baby, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess the sprinkle is okay because I was a second child and I feel like we did</p>
<p>not get near as much attention.</p>
<p>So who knows what this is going to do to like middle children and third children down the</p>
<p>road that actually, oh, someone knew we were there.</p>
<p>There are pictures of us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Other than that, from the friend point of view, the person, I will send a bigger gift</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t have to go.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I am a hundred percent with you on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like immediately scan the invitation for the registry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I will spend an additional hundred dollars on this to not have to go because</p>
<p>I will go to the ends of the earth to avoid unnecessary interactions.</p>
<p>And is this fun for the mom?</p>
<p>Because I always look at the pregnant lady in a room full of drunks, literally all of</p>
<p>her friends are just like, champagne shit face, like I want to touch your belly.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s really uncomfortable and sweating, you know, really, really pregnant.</p>
<p>So who is this fun for?</p>
<p>So I think the grandmother&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>Well no, when I was pregnant with my first child, my best gay guy friend threw a couple</p>
<p>shower for me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And it was fabulous.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s men and women that can come.</p>
<p>And so about the first 30, 45 minutes and you don&rsquo;t feel nor look your best.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly shallow in vain about my appearance.</p>
<p>So I did not like being eight months pregnant.</p>
<p>And I realized that&rsquo;s really bad, but I just am.</p>
<p>And so we have, we go to the party and about the first 30, 45 minutes, everybody&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>greeting everybody&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Well then I start to notice everybody&rsquo;s pupils are gigantic and like 12 of the guests are</p>
<p>totally tripping Molly at the baby shower.</p>
<p>They all get drunk.</p>
<p>I ended up leaving by around nine.</p>
<p>I think they all raged until three to four in the morning.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, is it fun to be the pregnant woman at the baby shower?</p>
<p>The answer is a resounding no, it&rsquo;s not fun at all.</p>
<p>I remember at my baby shower, I mean, and there were several, I&rsquo;m going to go ahead</p>
<p>and admit it.</p>
<p>I would hate, like I&rsquo;d open up a gift and I would be so appreciative of the gift, but</p>
<p>then I would immediately get resentful because of the thank you notes.</p>
<p>I hate writing thank you notes.</p>
<p>And I would almost rather not have the gift so that I don&rsquo;t have to write the thank you</p>
<p>note.</p>
<p>Like, please keep your gifts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to write you a thank you note.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I feel about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What happens if you don&rsquo;t write the thank you note?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>But your mom thinks you&rsquo;re an asshole and their friend, the grandmas, that crew talks</p>
<p>to each other.</p>
<p>But your mom already thinks you&rsquo;re an asshole.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying, like, then you would get other people&rsquo;s moms.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t, I mean, at the time I cared.</p>
<p>Now I would just send out a group text, thanks so much and call it.</p>
<p>But back in the day, I was, I wanted to make sure I didn&rsquo;t offend anybody that gave me</p>
<p>a gift.</p>
<p>God, who, who was I?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a minefield of pleasantries that-</p>
<p>And etiquette.</p>
<p>See, I didn&rsquo;t, I was-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another good reason to get sober.</p>
<p>You can just be like, oh, thank you cards are a trigger.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I used to write it when I was drunk.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, I sort of think, but I think Pamps actually had what now we know as a baby sprinkle, but</p>
<p>she had a baby sprinkle for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d already had my first child and I was actively wanting to have a second child.</p>
<p>So Pamps says, I&rsquo;m going to be your fertility coach.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve got this.</p>
<p>Full proof.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s the first date of your period?</p>
<p>So I tell her, so she&rsquo;s calculating.</p>
<p>And then she calls me, you need to have Josh come home from work right now and you all</p>
<p>need to have sex.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>You need to have a pillow under your pelvis.</p>
<p>And then when he&rsquo;s finished, just keep your legs up in the air and a hundred percent,</p>
<p>it will be a girl.</p>
<p>Cause I wanted my second child to be a girl.</p>
<p>I do exactly what she told me to do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I had read the book on it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I do exactly as instructed, right?</p>
<p>Josh comes home.</p>
<p>We have sex.</p>
<p>Keep my feet up in the air.</p>
<p>I do the pillow, the whole nine.</p>
<p>About six days later, she&rsquo;s like, Hey, I bought a pregnancy test.</p>
<p>Please come over to my house.</p>
<p>So I go over to her house and I said, Hey, I think it&rsquo;s going to be like 14 before it</p>
<p>shows up.</p>
<p>No, do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done everything.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The way the book told me.</p>
<p>I was so proud of my performance.</p>
<p>I pee on the pregnancy stick.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pregnant.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Josh is like all, literally all he is in this child is the sperm donor at this point.</p>
<p>I mean, she has basically, we&rsquo;re having a baby, right?</p>
<p>It was our baby.</p>
<p>And it was a girl.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So witchcraft.</p>
<p>You conjured that baby.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it was 16 years ago.</p>
<p>And so you had to wait to 20 weeks to get the ultrasound to see if there was a vagine</p>
<p>or a little pee pee.</p>
<p>And so we wait for the 20 weeks and I was like, you can go get all the ultrasound you</p>
<p>want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a girl.</p>
<p>I nailed this thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I nailed it.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>Balls penis.</p>
<p>And then I said her daughter, remember Stephanie took you to the hospital.</p>
<p>Her sister is a radiologist.</p>
<p>So she did an early ultrasound and said, there&rsquo;s a penis.</p>
<p>Now her sister is a radiologist physician.</p>
<p>I start arguing with her that it cannot be a penis because I got her pregnant with a</p>
<p>girl.</p>
<p>I remember and Stephanie was like, you&rsquo;re a fucking lunatic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I can see that as well.</p>
<p>But no, I was like, I wondered, did you use the wrong pillow?</p>
<p>I really, I seriously, I was butthurt about it not being.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve decided certain males are only female sperm, only male sperm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced if Josh had a hundred kids, they&rsquo;d all be boys.</p>
<p>That makes me feel better.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d like to test that theory.</p>
<p>I think we should take some of the sperm and start impregnating women for this show.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like we owe it to the world to do this.</p>
<p>We can just get the turkey baster out, line up lesbians and then just, you know, just</p>
<p>impregnate them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know, just a line of lesbians.</p>
<p>Girl, put down the pickleball paddles.</p>
<p>We need to try and experiment.</p>
<p>Legs in the air.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So back to pickleball.</p>
<p>So I play all the time and a big part of our group are lesbians.</p>
<p>And I get so mad because they beat me all the time and I&rsquo;ll say, you know what?</p>
<p>There is no more LGBTQIA.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s B-T-Q-I-A.</p>
<p>Screw you bitches.</p>
<p>You beat me all the time on the court.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no longer an ally.</p>
<p>No, of course we all giggle and laugh, but I mean, they are so good at pickleball.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, pickleball is one of those sports that&rsquo;s so competitive.</p>
<p>You can turn to gay bashing when you&rsquo;re upset.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally fair.</p>
<p>I bash the L&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that we, that lesbians are so into it because it was, it&rsquo;s such a, like a, it</p>
<p>started with old people.</p>
<p>And so then it was just old people and lesbians.</p>
<p>And I feel like these are two groups that needed to come together.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Because I play on cruise ships a lot because I work on cruise ships often.</p>
<p>What do you do on cruise ships?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a standup comedian.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the entertainer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, um, I&rsquo;ll end up playing in the mornings with, you know, 60, 70, 80 year olds and me.</p>
<p>And sometimes I&rsquo;m the first lesbian they&rsquo;ve ever said hello to, but it&rsquo;s such a good game</p>
<p>for like, like integrating people.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Everything on the court though, it changes because I was in a tournament with a guy in</p>
<p>a wheelchair and we did, we just kept hitting it at his wheels.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m not proud of it because we wanted to win and we did.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you got to do.</p>
<p>Did you just say, I&rsquo;m not proud of it, but I&rsquo;m not ashamed.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe I might have.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to the subject of we, we&rsquo;ve established that you have crossed over into</p>
<p>your forties and you&rsquo;re starting to do the things that 40 year old women have to do.</p>
<p>And one of those things is get a mammogram.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with mammograms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I had, okay.</p>
<p>So I, I got a mammogram like you&rsquo;re supposed to.</p>
<p>And everybody out there, if you&rsquo;re over 40, get your mammogram, talk to your doctor, whatever.</p>
<p>And I did that.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m a good girl.</p>
<p>I go get mammograms.</p>
<p>I get my parts checked because it&rsquo;s preventative medicine.</p>
<p>And no one prepared me for this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked to lots of women and the day I&rsquo;m going, another comedian friend of mine,</p>
<p>Debbie Gutierrez, she goes, what are you doing later?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting a mammogram.</p>
<p>She goes, oh honey.</p>
<p>And I go, no, no, no.</p>
<p>My wife said it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>She goes, girl, it hurts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>I was like, what?</p>
<p>She was right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so glad she said that because it was awful.</p>
<p>It is so painful.</p>
<p>It hurt me real bad.</p>
<p>Like I wanted to cry and, and, and anyway, I had to get two.</p>
<p>And then after the second, like I have dense breast tissue.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a nightmare.</p>
<p>So at the end it was just an ultrasound, which you thought would be better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, a little wand that they just put on your nerve and dig in.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>None of it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>My, my issue.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how this is the best imaging technology we could come up with for a breast</p>
<p>in 2023 is essentially like, like taking your boob and rolling it up in a car window.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your best pick.</p>
<p>I mean, you couldn&rsquo;t just.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>TSA can see inside your colon.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we just walk through a thing?</p>
<p>Put your arms up.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfathomable that the technology has not advanced more.</p>
<p>And I guarantee you if it were a scan of the penis, it would not be so invasive.</p>
<p>They would not panini that bitch.</p>
<p>No, they would not.</p>
<p>They would not.</p>
<p>Feel like a human s&rsquo;more in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>So the first time I ever had one, I go in there, the breathing, like hold your breath.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Exhale.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hold your breath.</p>
<p>I have the dense breasts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to do it over and over again.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Are they stupid or are they thick?</p>
<p>I mean, we are women.</p>
<p>I mean, and we&rsquo;re vulnerable.</p>
<p>Find a nicer way to put that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Like you got big old tough titties.</p>
<p>So I pass out, Kristen.</p>
<p>I pass out with my mammogram.</p>
<p>I mean, that is embarrassing.</p>
<p>So now when I go, I request a chair and I sit down for the whole thing and I still get</p>
<p>lightheaded.</p>
<p>You have to hold your breath.</p>
<p>Hold your breath.</p>
<p>Now exhale.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re a weenie about any kind of medical anything.</p>
<p>I am a pussy.</p>
<p>A total.</p>
<p>I admit it.</p>
<p>But fainting at your mammogram.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s top of the list.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I wonder if I could play my alcoholic card.</p>
<p>Oh, I can&rsquo;t get a mammogram.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get a mammogram.</p>
<p>It makes me want to drink.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is the question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently had to get several mammograms.</p>
<p>Did the ladies that were doing your boobs wear gloves?</p>
<p>Because mine didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to check next time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>And I remember feeling her hand.</p>
<p>So I think the first one, she had real warm hands.</p>
<p>I was like, this is going to be awesome.</p>
<p>This is not going to be bad.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s real gentle.</p>
<p>And then she really manhandled me and I&rsquo;m like, you.</p>
<p>She turned from just like, oh, I&rsquo;ll wear this warm robe to like, take your clothes off.</p>
<p>She goes-</p>
<p>Nurse ratchet.</p>
<p>I was going to say, I don&rsquo;t care if they wear gloves as long as they don&rsquo;t have Cheeto dust</p>
<p>on their fingers.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like sexual or anything.</p>
<p>I was like, we have to wear a mask in here and you&rsquo;re just flopping my boob up there</p>
<p>with no glove.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, I was just kind of like, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I appreciate that you verified for Kristen and me that the mammogram wasn&rsquo;t sexual.</p>
<p>I appreciated that, didn&rsquo;t you, Kristen?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think they were like hitting on me or anything.</p>
<p>Then I asked her to stick her finger in my ass.</p>
<p>So that was sexual.</p>
<p>Anything that was tracked from the machine.</p>
<p>Like I would, I&rsquo;m not a big ass play person, but if it makes me not think of the mammogram,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, let&rsquo;s try it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to anything at this point.</p>
<p>We need a second nurse to work on the back so the front doesn&rsquo;t go, hey, oh, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>You know, that might be better.</p>
<p>One time we were in Mexico on a girl&rsquo;s trip and we go get massages and we&rsquo;re, we all are</p>
<p>in individual rooms.</p>
<p>And then after we get the massage, she comes up to me and she says, I think my masseuse</p>
<p>was hitting on me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, she was not hitting on you.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, no, a hundred percent.</p>
<p>She kept, she kept looking at me saying, kiss me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought she was saying.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like a hundred percent.</p>
<p>That just was not happening.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I swear to God, I swear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a five-star hotel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that absolutely was not happening.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d never had a massage before that they did your boobs either.</p>
<p>It was the first massage that she ripped down my thing and was massaging my boobs.</p>
<p>Plus I was intoxicated.</p>
<p>You were.</p>
<p>To the max.</p>
<p>And maybe a little stone.</p>
<p>And I felt like she went right into my ear while she was rubbing my boobs saying, kiss</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>And I flew out of that room with my hair on fire because do you remember me coming around</p>
<p>that corner?</p>
<p>Cause y&rsquo;all were all sitting there and you were like, what the fuck happened?</p>
<p>I was like, oh my God, she&rsquo;s like the masseuse, the masseuse massaged my boobs.</p>
<p>I go, that&rsquo;s, you know, we&rsquo;re in Mexico and Europe and places they do, they&rsquo;re not prudes</p>
<p>like Americans.</p>
<p>They do the full body.</p>
<p>And it was like, she kept saying, kiss me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that just wasn&rsquo;t happening.</p>
<p>It could have.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what she was saying.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t kiss her.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re wondering.</p>
<p>I was, yeah, I was like, is that where you ran?</p>
<p>Was she a bad kisser?</p>
<p>Like, why did you leave?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a masseuse, like the top that like, I&rsquo;m like, oh, that, oh, that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s gentle.</p>
<p>I had a male masseuse that would massage like your hamstring.</p>
<p>And then like, there&rsquo;s like a groin area that I dated a masseuse for a while.</p>
<p>And she talked about like, like that massage and how, like how good it is for you.</p>
<p>And so I was like, oh, like, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to roll with it.</p>
<p>This is good.</p>
<p>Like I, but he got fired shortly after.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, did I, was I, was that illegal?</p>
<p>Should I not have let him do that?</p>
<p>Let me tell you what we found out here in Oklahoma City at, since your parents are in</p>
<p>Broken Arrow, this is a public service announcement.</p>
<p>There are happy ending places, massage places for women.</p>
<p>We just found out about this like two years ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s got to take forever.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I was like, you always know the men go for the happy ending.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And these are heterosexual, church going, carpool line attending, yoga attending, Starbucks</p>
<p>carrying, Target shopping, housewives, power moms that are going to the massage parlor</p>
<p>and getting finger diddled by the male masseuse.</p>
<p>Like happy ending.</p>
<p>For girls.</p>
<p>Did you even know that existed?</p>
<p>I did not know that existed.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>Of course, Pumps and I immediately did a drive by the massage parlor.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t crack any case yet, but we need to put that on our list to go drive back by</p>
<p>there again.</p>
<p>I kind of want to get a massage.</p>
<p>I was going to say, go inside.</p>
<p>See what the cohort is.</p>
<p>I mean, if you can&rsquo;t beat him, join him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be the one that got put on the perp walk.</p>
<p>The cops would immediately vest it right as exactly at my timing.</p>
<p>That was exactly what would happen to me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my first time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done anything like this before.</p>
<p>Well, Kristen, can you think of anything else?</p>
<p>Did you bring your guitar?</p>
<p>I have four right next to me.</p>
<p>Can you do a little bit?</p>
<p>I told Pumps about your guitar comedy stuff.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so clever and so awesome.</p>
<p>Could you do a little bit to close us out?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clean, but it&rsquo;s not dirty.</p>
<p>I just crocheted last night.</p>
<p>This is a true story.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the other room.</p>
<p>I crocheted a boob for this other show I&rsquo;m going on later on today.</p>
<p>I made one and my wife said, and I said, I got to make two because you need two boobs.</p>
<p>My wife said, why don&rsquo;t you make three?</p>
<p>I said, why three?</p>
<p>She goes, because then you could juggle them.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve crocheted some weird things, but I crocheted a penis a while ago to raffle</p>
<p>off, but I didn&rsquo;t know how much I could sell it for.</p>
<p>So I looked on Etsy and there&rsquo;s a lot of Etsy shops with crocheted penises.</p>
<p>And I wrote a song about my favorite.</p>
<p>Her name is Nasty Grandma, and this is called Nasty Grandma&rsquo;s Handmade Wangs.</p>
<p>Well nobody knows what&rsquo;s gotten into Granny.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s always crocheted, but lately it&rsquo;s nasty.</p>
<p>If you go for a visit, don&rsquo;t bring your kids, because Nasty Grandma won&rsquo;t stop crocheting</p>
<p>dicks.</p>
<p>Nasty Grandma won&rsquo;t stop crocheting tits.</p>
<p>She puts squeakers in the balls and she even circumcises the tits.</p>
<p>She ain&rsquo;t seen a real one since 93, so she makes them all from her memories.</p>
<p>Nasty Grandma won&rsquo;t stop crocheting dicks.</p>
<p>Well, she&rsquo;s kind of old and her income is fixed, but she does all right with her little</p>
<p>dick business.</p>
<p>Her dog ran off with one in his mouth, and now the mailman won&rsquo;t bring mail to her house.</p>
<p>Her couch is covered in wang-shaped pillows and her salt and pepper shakers are testicles.</p>
<p>Nasty Grandma won&rsquo;t stop crocheting dicks.</p>
<p>Nasty Grandma won&rsquo;t stop crocheting tits.</p>
<p>She puts squeakers in the balls and she even circumcises those tits.</p>
<p>She ain&rsquo;t seen a real one since 93, so she makes them all from her memories.</p>
<p>I remember this beautiful dick I saw back before the war.</p>
<p>Nasty Grandma won&rsquo;t stop crocheting tits.</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>That was amazing!</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>God, you make me and Pumps feel like we&rsquo;re total losers.</p>
<p>Failures.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You even have a good voice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not intended.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That song was supposed to be an uplifting song.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uplifting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re funny, pretty.</p>
<p>Talented.</p>
<p>Talented.</p>
<p>Great skin.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The sunscreen has paid off.</p>
<p>Kristen Key.</p>
<p>Oh, I could talk to you guys all day.</p>
<p>You just keep going.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Love your song.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so great.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Kristen Key, thank you so much for joining us.</p>
<p>Our listeners can find you at TheKristenKey and on her podcast, Kristen Knows Blank.</p>
<p>Kristen Knows Blank.</p>
<p>I play a Mad Lib with a comedian every episode.</p>
<p>How fun.</p>
<p>That is so fun.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Kristen.</p>
<p>We enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Next time you&rsquo;re in Oklahoma, think of us.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yay, I&rsquo;ll be in Oklahoma City this summer.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Text us.</p>
<p>Call me, Kristen.</p>
<p>Call me.</p>
<p>You got it, girl.</p>
<p>You call me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll play pickleball.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll play pickleball.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll go get a massage.</p>
<p>Bye, Kristen.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you guys so much for having me on.</p>
<p>Bye bye.</p>
<p>I love her.</p>
<p>She is so funny.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>I love the bag of dicks.</p>
<p>Yeah, she is so fun.</p>
<p>So I like the idea that she plays the, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t go to baby showers because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trigger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell Josh to update his trigger list.</p>
<p>Any time you don&rsquo;t want to go and you weren&rsquo;t Josh, that triggers Josh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to update the trigger list to pretty much cover everything.</p>
<p>Graduations.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ll be furious if you get out all the graduations.</p>
<p>Sip and Cs.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal on graduations.</p>
<p>You should only have to go to your own children.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I would never expect you to come to Dylan or Roman&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>I would never do that to you because I care about you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to torture you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have another baby because I am still able.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I would not make you come to my baby shower because I love you.</p>
<p>Maybe you should try to get you pregnant again.</p>
<p>Maybe you could try to get me pregnant again.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t use Josh&rsquo;s sperm because I&rsquo;m convinced it&rsquo;s only boys.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Listener, we will see you soon.</p>
<p>I think we need to wrap this before Josh taps it.</p>
<p>Please send us a voice memo via Instagram.</p>
<p>Follow us.</p>
<p>Like us.</p>
<p>Subscribe to us.</p>
<p>And we will see you next Tuesday.</p>
