    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Lane Norton.</p>
<p>Dr. Norton is one of the foremost experts</p>
<p>in protein metabolism, fat loss, and nutrition.</p>
<p>He did his degrees in biochemistry and nutritional sciences</p>
<p>and is considered one of the world experts</p>
<p>in understanding how we extract energy from our food</p>
<p>and how exercise and what we eat combine</p>
<p>to impact things like body composition and overall health.</p>
<p>Today, we discuss an enormous number of topics</p>
<p>under the umbrella of nutrition and fitness,</p>
<p>including, for instance, what is energy balance?</p>
<p>That is, how do we actually extract energy from our food?</p>
<p>We also discuss the somewhat controversial topic</p>
<p>of artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>whether or not they are safe or not,</p>
<p>and whether or not they are an effective tool</p>
<p>for weight loss, in particular for people suffering</p>
<p>from obesity and different types of diabetes.</p>
<p>We also talk about gut health, that is the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s impacted by food</p>
<p>and how it can actually impact the metabolism</p>
<p>of the foods that we eat.</p>
<p>We also discuss fasting, or so-called intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>or time-restricted feeding, what it does</p>
<p>and what it does not do in terms of how effective it is</p>
<p>for weight loss and perhaps even for health and longevity.</p>
<p>We also talk about protein and define very clearly</p>
<p>how much protein each and all of us need,</p>
<p>depending on our daily activities and life demands.</p>
<p>We discuss the various types of diets</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve probably heard about,</p>
<p>including ketogenic diets, vegan diets, vegetarian diets,</p>
<p>and pure carnivore diets,</p>
<p>as well as more typical omnivore diets,</p>
<p>and how to make sure that you get all</p>
<p>of the essential amino acids that are critical</p>
<p>for healthy weight maintenance, weight loss,</p>
<p>or directed muscle gain.</p>
<p>We also talk about supplements, in particular,</p>
<p>the supplements for which there is an immense amount</p>
<p>of science pointing to their safety and efficacy</p>
<p>for fitness and for overall body composition.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m sure will become clear to you</p>
<p>as you hear Lane talk about each and every one</p>
<p>of these topics is that he has an incredible ability</p>
<p>to both understand the mechanistic science,</p>
<p>but also the real-world applications</p>
<p>of the various discoveries that are made</p>
<p>in particular papers, and in particular,</p>
<p>in the randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>That is, when a given scientific hypothesis has been raised,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s extremely good at understanding why it was raised,</p>
<p>but also at evaluating whether or not it works</p>
<p>in the real world, which is what I believe</p>
<p>most everybody out there is concerned with.</p>
<p>I think this is one of the things</p>
<p>that really distinguishes him from the other voices</p>
<p>in the nutritional landscape.</p>
<p>I assure you that by the end of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>you will have a much clearer understanding</p>
<p>about what the science says about nutrition, about fitness,</p>
<p>and about how different diets and fitness programs combine</p>
<p>to achieve the results that you want.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Lane Norton.</p>
<p>Lane, Dr. Norton, thank you so much for being here.</p>
<p>This is a long time coming,</p>
<p>and I have to say I&rsquo;m really excited</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen you in the social media sphere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also listened to a number of your other podcasts,</p>
<p>and as a fellow PhD scientist,</p>
<p>I feel a great kinship with you.</p>
<p>I know you have tremendous experience</p>
<p>in fitness and nutrition, a number of areas.</p>
<p>We also got a lot of questions from our audience,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to talking with you today.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m excited too.</p>
<p>I mean, like you said, it&rsquo;s been something</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about for a long time,</p>
<p>so I was glad we were able to make it happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, indeed, and I think some of the audience</p>
<p>has requested a debate or a battle,</p>
<p>and I can tell you right now, it&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the things that brought Lane and I together</p>
<p>in conversation online and then via text, et cetera,</p>
<p>was the fact that I love to be corrected,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>I did a post about artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>which we will talk about a little bit later in the episode,</p>
<p>and Lane pointed out some areas of the study</p>
<p>that I had missed or maybe even misunderstood,</p>
<p>and I revised my opinions, and I think it&rsquo;s wonderful,</p>
<p>and other studies have come out since then,</p>
<p>so hopefully, our conversation will serve as a message</p>
<p>of how science and actionable science can be perceived</p>
<p>and that it doesn&rsquo;t always have to be a battle,</p>
<p>but hey, if we get into it, we get into it.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t get physical because we know you would win.</p>
<p>So in any case, I&rsquo;d like to start</p>
<p>with something that&rsquo;s rather basic</p>
<p>and yet can be pretty complex,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s this issue of energy balance</p>
<p>and energy utilization.</p>
<p>I think most people have heard of a calorie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that most people don&rsquo;t actually know</p>
<p>what that is in terms of how it works, what it represents,</p>
<p>and so maybe you could just explain for people</p>
<p>what happens when we eat food of any kind</p>
<p>and how is that actually converted into energy</p>
<p>as a way of framing up the discussion around weight loss,</p>
<p>weight maintenance, weight gain, and body composition.</p>
<p>So a great question, and like you said,</p>
<p>this is one of those things where people use the term</p>
<p>calories in, calories out,</p>
<p>and they say, well, that&rsquo;s way too simplistic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, if you look at what actually makes up</p>
<p>calories in, calories out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually very complicated, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s deal with what you mentioned first.</p>
<p>What is a calorie?</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of people don&rsquo;t quite understand this.</p>
<p>So a calorie just refers to a unit of energy,</p>
<p>of heat specifically.</p>
<p>And so, well, what does that have to do with food?</p>
<p>What does that have to do with what we digest and eat?</p>
<p>Really, what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is the potential chemical energy</p>
<p>that is in the bonds of the macronutrients of food, right?</p>
<p>And by digesting, assimilating,</p>
<p>and metabolizing those nutrients,</p>
<p>we are able to create energy.</p>
<p>And the end product of that mostly is ATP,</p>
<p>adenosine triphosphate,</p>
<p>which is your body&rsquo;s energy currency.</p>
<p>So to understand ATP, just try to think about</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to power</p>
<p>these various reactions in your body,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about tens of thousands of enzymes</p>
<p>that require ATP,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make sense that you would have to create</p>
<p>a bunch of micro explosions, right?</p>
<p>You want something that can transfer high energy phosphates</p>
<p>to power these reactions,</p>
<p>to give up essentially its energy,</p>
<p>to power something that might otherwise be unfavorable.</p>
<p>So a lot of metabolism is simply creating ATP,</p>
<p>which the end of the line of that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna kind of work backwards,</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called oxidative respiration.</p>
<p>So that happens in the mitochondria.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s heard mitochondria, powerhouse of the cell.</p>
<p>And that is done through essentially creating</p>
<p>a hydrogen ion gradient across the mitochondria,</p>
<p>which powers the production of ATP</p>
<p>by converting free phosphate plus ADP to ATP.</p>
<p>Now, the way that hydrogen ion gradient is created</p>
<p>is through creating hydrogen ions</p>
<p>that can be donated through the Krebs cycle.</p>
<p>Now, the Krebs cycle is linked to glycolysis.</p>
<p>So if we talk about carbohydrate metabolism,</p>
<p>basically other than fructose,</p>
<p>get converted into glucose,</p>
<p>which can go into glycolysis,</p>
<p>and you can produce some ATPs through glycolysis,</p>
<p>and then it boils down to pyruvate,</p>
<p>then acetyl-CoA, which goes through the Krebs cycle,</p>
<p>produces a lot more ATPs from that.</p>
<p>If you talk about protein,</p>
<p>protein&rsquo;s a little bit different</p>
<p>because protein gets converted to amino acids,</p>
<p>which can be used for muscle protein synthesis</p>
<p>or protein synthesis in other tissues,</p>
<p>but it also can be converted</p>
<p>through gluconeogenesis to glucose.</p>
<p>And there also are some ketogenic amino acids as well.</p>
<p>And so you can have a few different ways</p>
<p>to get to the Krebs cycle,</p>
<p>either being through acetyl-CoA</p>
<p>or through glucose going through the glycolysis to pyruvate.</p>
<p>Then you have fatty acids,</p>
<p>which are able to create energy</p>
<p>through what&rsquo;s called beta-oxidation,</p>
<p>where essentially you&rsquo;re taking these fatty acids</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re lopping them off two carbons at a time</p>
<p>to produce acetyl-CoA,</p>
<p>which again can go into the Krebs cycle,</p>
<p>produce those hydrogen ions</p>
<p>that can then power the production of ATP.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of like at the cellular level</p>
<p>of how this stuff works.</p>
<p>But stepping back and taking it back out,</p>
<p>like what does that have to do</p>
<p>with weight loss or weight gain, right?</p>
<p>Well, when you think about the balance</p>
<p>of energy in versus energy out,</p>
<p>sounds very simple,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s look at what actually makes up</p>
<p>energy in versus energy out.</p>
<p>First of all, you&rsquo;ve got to realize</p>
<p>that the energy inside of the equation</p>
<p>is more difficult to track than people think, right?</p>
<p>So one, food labels, which we like to think</p>
<p>as being, you know, like from upon high,</p>
<p>can have up to a 20% error in them.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>So a hundred calorie,</p>
<p>is something listed as a hundred calories per serving,</p>
<p>it could, what&rsquo;s actually in there,</p>
<p>it could be 80 or 120.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one aspect of it.</p>
<p>The second aspect is there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called your energy,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also metabolizable energy, right?</p>
<p>So if you have a food stuff</p>
<p>with say a lot of insoluble fiber,</p>
<p>typically insoluble fiber is not really digestible.</p>
<p>And so you could have, you know,</p>
<p>quite a bit of carbohydrate, you know,</p>
<p>but if you can&rsquo;t extract the energy from it,</p>
<p>and typically this is because insoluble fiber</p>
<p>from like plant material,</p>
<p>the carbohydrate or, and even some of the protein</p>
<p>is bound up in the plant structure,</p>
<p>which makes it inaccessible to digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>And so this is what like adds bulk</p>
<p>to your stool and whatnot.</p>
<p>But again, reduces the metabolizable energy in there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some evidence</p>
<p>that based on people&rsquo;s individual gut microbiome,</p>
<p>that some people may actually be better</p>
<p>at extracting energy out of fiber compared to other people.</p>
<p>So just starting off right there, okay,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s quite a bit of play in the energy inside of things.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things people will say is,</p>
<p>well, see, that&rsquo;s why you shouldn&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about tracking calories,</p>
<p>because you know, if the food labels can be 20% off,</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;ll say is, okay,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s, I understand where you&rsquo;re coming from,</p>
<p>but typically if it&rsquo;s off, it&rsquo;s gonna be consistently off.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re consistent with how you track it,</p>
<p>eventually you&rsquo;ll be able to know</p>
<p>kind of what you&rsquo;re taking in.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of, that&rsquo;s kind of like saying,</p>
<p>well, don&rsquo;t worry about tracking, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re, I like to use financial examples.</p>
<p>You know, we know that to save money,</p>
<p>or you have to earn more money than you spend.</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t exactly know how much money</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re earning at a time, you know,</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s inflation and then there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if you have investments, those can be, you know,</p>
<p>different interest rates and whatnot.</p>
<p>So, okay, but you&rsquo;re, you know, if you have a budget,</p>
<p>you have a reasonable idea of what it&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>you know, and you make certain assumptions,</p>
<p>but you can relatively guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good example.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s look at the energy outside of the equation,</p>
<p>which is actually way more complicated, right?</p>
<p>And so your energy out is a few different buckets.</p>
<p>The first one and the biggest one</p>
<p>is your resting metabolic rate, so your RMR.</p>
<p>And that for most people is anywhere from 50 to 70%</p>
<p>of your total daily energy expenditure.</p>
<p>Now, people use the term metabolic rate</p>
<p>and energy expenditure kind of interchangeably,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not the same thing.</p>
<p>So your total daily energy expenditure</p>
<p>is the summation of all the energy you expend in a day.</p>
<p>Walking upstairs, exercise if you do it.</p>
<p>Fidgeting, yeah.</p>
<p>Plus your resting metabolic rate.</p>
<p>Right, so resting metabolic rate is a big part of that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the only thing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s usually about 50 to 70%.</p>
<p>And sedentary people will be on the higher end of that,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;ll be a bigger proportion,</p>
<p>whereas people who are more active,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be a little bit lower,</p>
<p>not because their metabolic rate is lower,</p>
<p>but because they&rsquo;re expending a greater percentage</p>
<p>of their calories from physical activity.</p>
<p>Then you have something called the thermic effect of food,</p>
<p>which is a relatively small percentage</p>
<p>of your total daily energy expenditure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about five to 10%.</p>
<p>And very difficult to measure,</p>
<p>and usually what researchers do</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re kind of looking at this stuff</p>
<p>is they just kind of make an assumption about it.</p>
<p>They use a constant.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s about five to 10%</p>
<p>of your daily energy expenditure.</p>
<p>And that refers to the amount of energy it takes</p>
<p>to extract the energy out of food.</p>
<p>So think about your body kind of like a car, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just have gas in your tank</p>
<p>and it spontaneously starts up, right?</p>
<p>Like you have to have a battery,</p>
<p>so you put in energy so you can get the energy</p>
<p>out of the petrol that you have in your car.</p>
<p>Similar with food, you can&rsquo;t just eat food</p>
<p>and then it just appears in your cells</p>
<p>and you start doing stuff.</p>
<p>It has to be systematically broken down</p>
<p>and put into forms that can actually produce energy.</p>
<p>And so you have to put some energy in to achieve that.</p>
<p>And a lot of times people will say something like,</p>
<p>well, not all calories are created equal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true because calories</p>
<p>just a unit of measurement, right?</p>
<p>That would be like saying not all seconds</p>
<p>on a clock are created equal.</p>
<p>Yes, they are.</p>
<p>All sources of calories may have differential effects</p>
<p>on energy expenditure and appetite.</p>
<p>So if we look at something like fat, for example,</p>
<p>the TEF of fat is about zero to 3%,</p>
<p>meaning if you eat 100 calories from fat,</p>
<p>your net will be about 97 to 100.</p>
<p>So the process of breaking down that fat</p>
<p>essentially subtracts some of the calories away</p>
<p>because you used it in creating energy</p>
<p>by breaking those chemical bonds to create ATP.</p>
<p>Correct, correct.</p>
<p>So you have like, for example,</p>
<p>some enzymes that require ATP to run these processes.</p>
<p>Now, fat is actually the easiest thing</p>
<p>to convert into energy.</p>
<p>Then you have carbohydrate,</p>
<p>which has a TEF of like five to 10%.</p>
<p>So you eat 100 calories from carbohydrate.</p>
<p>And obviously like the fiber content</p>
<p>makes a big difference on this.</p>
<p>But if you eat 100 calories, you&rsquo;ll net 90 to 95.</p>
<p>Protein is about a 20 to 30% TEF.</p>
<p>So if you eat 100 calories from protein,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only netting 70 to 80.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re still net, you know, people say,</p>
<p>well, you can&rsquo;t eat too much protein.</p>
<p>Well, you know, people will ask,</p>
<p>well, can protein be stored as fat?</p>
<p>The carbons from protein,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unlikely it&rsquo;s gonna wind up in adipose tissue.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re eating a lot of protein</p>
<p>overall as part of a lot of calories,</p>
<p>it does, it has to be oxidized</p>
<p>and it can provide a calorie cushion</p>
<p>for other things to be stored in fat.</p>
<p>But protein itself does provide, you know,</p>
<p>a net positive for calories,</p>
<p>but less so than carbohydrate or fat</p>
<p>and tends to be more satiating.</p>
<p>So again, when people talk about, you know,</p>
<p>are all the calories created equal?</p>
<p>Yes, but all sources of calories</p>
<p>may have differential effects</p>
<p>on energy expenditure and appetite.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the TEF bucket and the BMR bucket.</p>
<p>Then we go to physical activity</p>
<p>and physical activity is essentially two parts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s exercise,</p>
<p>which is kind of your purposeful movements.</p>
<p>Like you go out for a walk,</p>
<p>you do a training session, I mean, whatever,</p>
<p>any purposeful activity.</p>
<p>And then you have what&rsquo;s called NEAT,</p>
<p>which is non-exercise activity thermogenesis,</p>
<p>which I think is actually really cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I was actually hanging out</p>
<p>with somebody last night and I was noticing them.</p>
<p>They were fidgeting their feet and their fingers.</p>
<p>And I said, you know,</p>
<p>have you always like been pretty lean?</p>
<p>And they were like, yeah,</p>
<p>I never really had a problem maintaining leanness.</p>
<p>And when you look at the obese resistant phenotype,</p>
<p>people think they have high BMR or, you know,</p>
<p>they exercise a lot.</p>
<p>And really what it seems to be is NEAT.</p>
<p>They tend to, if they overeat,</p>
<p>they just spontaneously increase their physical activity.</p>
<p>Now people get NEAT confused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard people say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m going to go out for a walk to get my NEAT up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not NEAT.</p>
<p>NEAT is not something you can consciously modify.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing there, if it&rsquo;s purposeful, it&rsquo;s exercise.</p>
<p>So for example, if I, when I&rsquo;m talking,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m waving around my hands,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m tapping my feet, if I&rsquo;m whatever, that&rsquo;s NEAT.</p>
<p>But, you know, trying to like get yourself,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m just going to tap my foot more.</p>
<p>Well, now if I&rsquo;m consciously having to do this,</p>
<p>then my focus, I mean, you know how the brain works.</p>
<p>Very hard to do.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t really do two things at once.</p>
<p>You kind of switch quickly between tasks, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Can I quickly ask,</p>
<p>was the person that you&rsquo;re referring to our friend,</p>
<p>Ben Bruno?</p>
<p>No, no, but he is fidgety too.</p>
<p>Amazing online fitness channel.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a freakishly strong individual.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t remember whether or not Ben,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a fidgeter or not, but anyway,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to go check and we&rsquo;ll measure your fidgeting.</p>
<p>About non-exercise induced thermogenesis, NEAT,</p>
<p>my understanding of the old papers on this,</p>
<p>old being, I guess, back to the mid nineties,</p>
<p>is that the calorie burn from NEAT</p>
<p>is actually pretty significant.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about a hundred calories</p>
<p>or 200 calories per day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about in some cases, hundreds of thousand,</p>
<p>excuse me, hundreds to maybe even close</p>
<p>to a thousand calories per day.</p>
<p>Could you elaborate on that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there was actually a really classic study,</p>
<p>I think from, I want to say it&rsquo;s from Levine in 1995.</p>
<p>It was a metabolic ward study.</p>
<p>And hopefully I don&rsquo;t butcher the study</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to, you know, pull it out of my brain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect you to have PubMed in your head,</p>
<p>although I must say you have a quite extensive</p>
<p>PubMed ID grab bag in there.</p>
<p>I try to bring the receipts.</p>
<p>I try to bring the receipts.</p>
<p>We will put a link to this study in the show note captions</p>
<p>so people can peruse it if they like.</p>
<p>So I believe they had people overeat.</p>
<p>And I think it was by like a thousand calories a day,</p>
<p>I think for six weeks.</p>
<p>And I mean, this is the metabolic ward.</p>
<p>So they are, this is very tightly controlled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as tight as you get.</p>
<p>And what was interesting is of course,</p>
<p>on average people gained weight and gained fat mass,</p>
<p>but some people gained more than expected.</p>
<p>And there was one person in particular</p>
<p>who only gained like just over half a kilo, right?</p>
<p>They should have gained like,</p>
<p>I think it was something like three to four kilos</p>
<p>it was predicted.</p>
<p>And what they found is this individual</p>
<p>just spontaneously increased their physical activity.</p>
<p>Like he didn&rsquo;t purposely do it.</p>
<p>It just happened.</p>
<p>And I mean, you know, anecdotally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people who are, again, you know, very lean,</p>
<p>even eat a meal, sit down and start sweating, you know,</p>
<p>and be very fidgety.</p>
<p>There was a natural bodybuilder back in the day</p>
<p>named Jim Cordova.</p>
<p>And this guy was just very lean all the time.</p>
<p>And he was exactly that phenotype.</p>
<p>You know, he would walk up a flight of stairs</p>
<p>and all of a sudden he&rsquo;s sweating,</p>
<p>sit down, eat a meal, he&rsquo;s sweating.</p>
<p>You know, he just-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a furnace.</p>
<p>Just expending energy.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s very interesting about NEAT</p>
<p>is that seems to be the most modifiable.</p>
<p>I mean, exercise is very modifiable</p>
<p>because you can be intentional with that.</p>
<p>But of, you know, BMR, TEF and NEAT,</p>
<p>NEAT seems to be far more modifiable.</p>
<p>So even a body weight reduction of 10%,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve observed a decrease in NEAT</p>
<p>of almost 500 calories a day</p>
<p>for a 10% reduction in body weight.</p>
<p>Now, you also do get a decline in BMR when you lose weight.</p>
<p>One, because you&rsquo;re just in a smaller body now.</p>
<p>And so it takes less energy to locomote.</p>
<p>But also there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called metabolic adaptation,</p>
<p>which is a further reduction in your BMR</p>
<p>than expected from the loss of body mass.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s on average, usually around like 15%.</p>
<p>But it does seem to be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s new evidence coming out</p>
<p>on the metabolic adaptation from BMR.</p>
<p>And it seems to be a little bit</p>
<p>kind of in the transition phases.</p>
<p>So if you start a diet, within the first few weeks,</p>
<p>you will have a reduction in BMR</p>
<p>that then kind of just thereafter,</p>
<p>any further reduction is mostly</p>
<p>from the amount of body mass you lose.</p>
<p>And then if you, like for example, finish a diet</p>
<p>and move your calories to maintenance,</p>
<p>within a few weeks, BMR kind of starts to come back up.</p>
<p>There is still a small reduction,</p>
<p>but I used to be somebody who thought the BMR,</p>
<p>the metabolic adaptation was a big reason</p>
<p>why people stopped losing weight or plateaued.</p>
<p>And now I think it&rsquo;s much more to do with NEAT.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve said that it can&rsquo;t be conscious</p>
<p>because that will distract us from other activities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve had a chance to look at this study</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll send it to you.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;d be fun to do a kind of an online journal club</p>
<p>about this at some point soon.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a study that came out</p>
<p>at University of Houston recently,</p>
<p>having people do, now this is a long period of time,</p>
<p>four hours a day of basically a soleus pushup,</p>
<p>which is basically a heel raise,</p>
<p>kind of a seated calf raise with one foot, not weighted.</p>
<p>And then they looked at a bunch of things</p>
<p>about glucose metabolism</p>
<p>and glucose clearance and insulin levels.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t conclude</p>
<p>that people burned a ton of calories,</p>
<p>but what they concluded was</p>
<p>that blood sugar regulation improved greatly.</p>
<p>And I think there was a lot of excitement</p>
<p>about this at some level,</p>
<p>but based on everything you&rsquo;re telling me,</p>
<p>this fits perfectly with what&rsquo;s known about NEAT.</p>
<p>So this sort of fell somewhere in between with,</p>
<p>in between, excuse me, sort of deliberate exercise</p>
<p>and spontaneous movement.</p>
<p>I guess they&rsquo;ve tried to make that spontaneous movement</p>
<p>a little bit more conscious.</p>
<p>Well, what I&rsquo;ll tell people is if you&rsquo;re worried about NEAT,</p>
<p>one thing you can do, like these watches, for example,</p>
<p>a lot of people are like,</p>
<p>oh, well, it told me I burned this many calories.</p>
<p>They are not accurate for energy expenditure.</p>
<p>I mean, it is like, there was a meta-analysis in 2018,</p>
<p>I wanna say, between a 28 and 93% overestimation</p>
<p>of energy expenditure by these watches.</p>
<p>So for those of you listening,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna name the brand,</p>
<p>but fitness trackers, so wrist-worn fitness trackers.</p>
<p>And this is across the board.</p>
<p>So like depending on the brand,</p>
<p>it could be more or less,</p>
<p>but they all overestimated the amount of,</p>
<p>the calories you burn from exercise.</p>
<p>So this is actually a great example where people go,</p>
<p>well, calories in, calories out doesn&rsquo;t work for me</p>
<p>because I ate in a calorie deficit and I didn&rsquo;t lose weight.</p>
<p>And when I talked to them, usually it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>they went to an online calculator.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a few things.</p>
<p>They went to an online calculator,</p>
<p>put in their information,</p>
<p>it spat out some calories to eat</p>
<p>and they ate that and didn&rsquo;t lose weight.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, what do you think is more likely,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re defying the laws of conservation of energy</p>
<p>or that you might&rsquo;ve not gotten the right number for you?</p>
<p>The measurement tool was off.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The next thing is a lot of people weigh very sporadically.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell people like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna make an intentional weight loss a goal,</p>
<p>and again, this can be different for different people,</p>
<p>but typically I tell people,</p>
<p>weigh in first thing in the morning</p>
<p>or after you go to the bathroom,</p>
<p>do it every day and take the average of that for the week.</p>
<p>And then compare that to the next week&rsquo;s average.</p>
<p>Can I ask one quick, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but one quick question about that.</p>
<p>When you say go to the bathroom,</p>
<p>not to get too detailed here for unnecessarily,</p>
<p>but are you talking about urination and emptying your bowels?</p>
<p>Ideally, because you can eat a big meal the night before.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, got it.</p>
<p>Wake up, use the bathroom in all forms that you&rsquo;re ready.</p>
<p>And then get on the scale, take that measurement,</p>
<p>average that across the week.</p>
<p>And then maybe every Monday you take that value</p>
<p>and see how you progress.</p>
<p>And the reason I recommend doing that is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just kind of sporadically weighing in,</p>
<p>as somebody who weighs themselves pretty regularly,</p>
<p>I mean, my weight will fluctuate five, six pounds</p>
<p>and not seemingly changing much.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>those short-term changes are fluid.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had it before where week to week,</p>
<p>my average didn&rsquo;t change,</p>
<p>but between the lowest weigh-in from a previous week</p>
<p>and the highest weigh-in</p>
<p>might&rsquo;ve been like eight pounds, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who just randomly is weighing in</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re eating in a calorie deficit</p>
<p>and you just weigh in one day where you&rsquo;ve just,</p>
<p>whatever reason holding some more fluid,</p>
<p>then you go, oh, see, this isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>When in reality, your average might be dropping.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the reasons.</p>
<p>And actually, believe it or not,</p>
<p>weight fluctuations are actually identified</p>
<p>as a major reason why people get discouraged</p>
<p>from weight loss.</p>
<p>That it kind of stops the buy-in, you know,</p>
<p>when they have a fluctuation up.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the reasons early on</p>
<p>that low carb diets tend to work really well</p>
<p>is because people lose a lot of water weight really quickly</p>
<p>and they get that buy-in, right?</p>
<p>So, oh, this is working.</p>
<p>Yeah, we can return to that in a little bit</p>
<p>because I have theories as to how that, you know,</p>
<p>when people eat less carbohydrate,</p>
<p>they screep more water and they&rsquo;ll see, you know,</p>
<p>for the first time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll see some definition in their abs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll go, oh my God, this diet&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And the fluid loss does hold that promise.</p>
<p>I think fluid loss can do some other things</p>
<p>that might make people literally feel lighter,</p>
<p>although it can have some negative effects.</p>
<p>I do have one quick question</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll return to Neat in a moment.</p>
<p>But when you say the caloric burn</p>
<p>as a consequence of exercise,</p>
<p>I want to ask about the caloric burn during that exercise.</p>
<p>So for instance, somebody is on the treadmill</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll see, okay, they burn, you know, 400 calories.</p>
<p>Actually, I think this is a month</p>
<p>where a number of prominent podcasters</p>
<p>like Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>others are doing, they call it sober October,</p>
<p>but in addition to avoiding alcohol,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re burning 500 calories per day during the exercise.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re measuring it.</p>
<p>A lot of people do this.</p>
<p>They think they take track of whether, excuse me,</p>
<p>take stock of how many calories they burned.</p>
<p>My understanding is that</p>
<p>if that particular form of exercise</p>
<p>is a muscle building form of exercise,</p>
<p>that at some point later,</p>
<p>there might be an increase in muscle.</p>
<p>If you did everything right, do everything right,</p>
<p>and then you will burn more energy</p>
<p>as a consequence of adding that tissue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long process as you know, and we will discuss.</p>
<p>But I have heard about this post-exercise</p>
<p>induced increase in oxidative metabolism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably not using the right language in here.</p>
<p>So if I were to go out, for instance, in sprint,</p>
<p>do some sprints, run hard for a minute,</p>
<p>jog for a minute, run hard for a minute,</p>
<p>and do that 10 times over,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume I burn 400 calories during that exercise bout.</p>
<p>But my understanding is that in the hours that follow,</p>
<p>my basal metabolic rate will have increased.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>And is it significant enough to care about?</p>
<p>So answer both those questions.</p>
<p>Yes, there does seem to be a small increase</p>
<p>in metabolic rate.</p>
<p>And no, it does not appear to be enough</p>
<p>to actually make a difference.</p>
<p>So when they look at, and again, this is where</p>
<p>I tell people, I think I have a good perspective on this</p>
<p>because my undergraduate degree was a biochemistry degree.</p>
<p>So I was very into mechanisms, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It was like, oh, if we just do this and this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get this, right?</p>
<p>And then I did nutrition as a graduate degree.</p>
<p>And then my advisor was so great</p>
<p>because you could do something over here</p>
<p>and he could tell you how it would affect</p>
<p>vitamin D metabolism over here.</p>
<p>This is Don Lehman.</p>
<p>Yeah, Don Lehman.</p>
<p>So he would always kind of say,</p>
<p>yeah, but what&rsquo;s the outcome gonna be, right?</p>
<p>So this is actually one of the things I changed my mind on</p>
<p>was I used to be very much, well, I think,</p>
<p>high intensity interval training is probably better</p>
<p>because you get this post-exercise energy burn,</p>
<p>which they do see in some of these studies.</p>
<p>But in the kind of meta-analyses</p>
<p>and more tightly controlled studies</p>
<p>where they equate work between high intensity intervals</p>
<p>and moderate or low intensity cardio.</p>
<p>So equating work,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t see differences in the loss of body fat.</p>
<p>And so to me, if I&rsquo;m looking at,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the example of a mechanism, which is,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re seeing this small increase</p>
<p>in basal metabolic rate</p>
<p>that should lead to increased loss of body fat.</p>
<p>But again, remember,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re capturing a snapshot in time, right?</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t see a difference in the loss of body fat.</p>
<p>So what may be happening, and again, I&rsquo;m just speculating,</p>
<p>but a way to explain it could be,</p>
<p>you might have an increase</p>
<p>and then you might actually have a decrease</p>
<p>that tends to just kind of wash it out, right?</p>
<p>And I have to imagine some forms of exercise,</p>
<p>this will be highly individual,</p>
<p>but will spike appetite more than others.</p>
<p>So for instance, if I go out for a 45 minute jog,</p>
<p>which I do a 45 to 60 minute hike or jog once a week,</p>
<p>I just make it a point to do that</p>
<p>or rock or something like that,</p>
<p>throw on a weight vest and hike.</p>
<p>After that, I find I&rsquo;m very thirsty, I want to hydrate,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not that hungry.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true of most all cardiovascular exercise for me.</p>
<p>But after I weight train, about 60 to 90 minutes later,</p>
<p>I wanna eat the refrigerator.</p>
<p>And so obviously calories in, calories out dictates</p>
<p>that that will play an important role</p>
<p>as to whether or not I gain or lose weight, et cetera.</p>
<p>So is it safe to say that the specific form of exercise</p>
<p>that people choose needs to be taken</p>
<p>in consideration of calories in, calories out?</p>
<p>So how much is burned during the exercise?</p>
<p>Also, how much of that exercise</p>
<p>tends to stimulate appetite?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether or not people explore this</p>
<p>in the rigorous studies.</p>
<p>And whether or not that form of exercise</p>
<p>actually increases lean muscle mass or not.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve taken exercise</p>
<p>and split it into a number of different dimensions,</p>
<p>but this is what you are so masterful at</p>
<p>is really parsing how the different components</p>
<p>work individually and together.</p>
<p>So if you would just expand on that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to know what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is actually a really fascinating thing.</p>
<p>So first thing, I wanna just go back to talking about,</p>
<p>like for example, Bert and Tom and Joe,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do 500 calories a day on whatever.</p>
<p>So those apparatuses don&rsquo;t measure those things</p>
<p>effectively either, right?</p>
<p>Just like these watches.</p>
<p>But the one thing I will say is if you are,</p>
<p>like for example, if I do two hours of resistance training,</p>
<p>typically this will say I burned about 1,000 calories.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of resistance training.</p>
<p>My weight workouts are like warm up for 10 minutes</p>
<p>and then one hour of work done.</p>
<p>I love to train.</p>
<p>And you can recover from,</p>
<p>my recovery quotient is pretty low.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been training for 30 plus years</p>
<p>and I found that if I do more than an hour of hard work</p>
<p>in the gym, meaning resistance training,</p>
<p>if 75 minutes, maybe I&rsquo;m okay, but past that,</p>
<p>I have to take two, maybe even three days off</p>
<p>before I can train.</p>
<p>My nervous system just doesn&rsquo;t tolerate it well.</p>
<p>So I limit it to an hour, you know.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>And part of that to remember is like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of built up to that</p>
<p>over a long period of time, right?</p>
<p>You know, so you couldn&rsquo;t just throw somebody in</p>
<p>and start having them do two hours a day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna go well for them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>But I will say about the calorie trackers is,</p>
<p>so if I&rsquo;m used to, okay,</p>
<p>usually burn about a thousand calories according to this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not accurate.</p>
<p>But if I go in tomorrow and I do 1300,</p>
<p>it may not be accurate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the exact number is,</p>
<p>but I can be relatively confident</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s more than the previous session, right?</p>
<p>And so in terms of comparison, it might be okay.</p>
<p>Kind of within subject.</p>
<p>And then the other thing I was kind of circling around on</p>
<p>was if you&rsquo;re worried about NEAT,</p>
<p>tracking your steps can be helpful</p>
<p>because people&rsquo;s step counts can spontaneously decrease</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re on a fat loss diet.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even realize it.</p>
<p>So, and that, again, not a complete measure of NEAT,</p>
<p>but what we&rsquo;ve had some clients do</p>
<p>with our team biling coaches is they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;re at 8,000 steps right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna add any purposeful cardio,</p>
<p>but whatever you need to do</p>
<p>to maintain that 8,000 steps, do that.</p>
<p>And sometimes they have to add, you know,</p>
<p>15, 20, 30 minutes of cardio</p>
<p>because their spontaneous activity</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not even aware of goes down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really excellent point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard, you know, the 10,000 steps per day number was,</p>
<p>we all heard that.</p>
<p>And then I learned that 10,000 was just kind of thrown out</p>
<p>as an arbitrary number.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like the eight hour intermittent fasting thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a story behind that.</p>
<p>Cause I actually spoke to Sao Chin</p>
<p>and it turns out that the graduate student in his lab</p>
<p>that did that initial study, which was on mice, by the way,</p>
<p>was limited to being in lab for about eight hours</p>
<p>by their significant other.</p>
<p>So the eight hour feeding window is actually the consequence</p>
<p>of this person&rsquo;s relationship.</p>
<p>That is a really great point that people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>when they, a lot of people will try to copy</p>
<p>like scientific studies.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell people like, listen,</p>
<p>scientific studies are so confined.</p>
<p>You need to be very careful</p>
<p>with how broadly you apply what&rsquo;s in there, right?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re a very big hammer</p>
<p>is kind of the way I look at it, okay?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not a scalpel, they&rsquo;re a big hammer.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of times in terms of coaching,</p>
<p>scientific studies will tell you what not to do</p>
<p>rather than what to do, right?</p>
<p>But getting back to your question</p>
<p>about like exercise appetite.</p>
<p>So first off, I&rsquo;m not really aware</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s evidence showing like differential effects</p>
<p>of different forms of exercise on appetite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>But again, it also could be like a placebo effect, right?</p>
<p>Because we, like for example,</p>
<p>you and I grew up in an era where the muscle magazines,</p>
<p>it was like, well, as soon as you finish your workout,</p>
<p>you can have your biggest meal of the day, right?</p>
<p>And when I say placebo effect,</p>
<p>I think people have the wrong idea</p>
<p>of what the placebo effect is.</p>
<p>They think that&rsquo;s just a feeling.</p>
<p>Placebo effect can actually change your physiology.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t realize this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s research showing that a placebo</p>
<p>or the power of suggestion is basically</p>
<p>as powerful as some pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>And one of the great examples I like to use</p>
<p>is actually there was a study we just covered</p>
<p>in our research review on creatine</p>
<p>where they did four groups,</p>
<p>not supplemented with creatine,</p>
<p>told they weren&rsquo;t supplemented with creatine,</p>
<p>not supplemented, told they were supplemented,</p>
<p>supplemented, told they weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>supplemented, told they were.</p>
<p>Basically, it just matters what they told them.</p>
<p>This is incredible.</p>
<p>I have to get this study so we can link to it.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine at Stanford,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been on the podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to introduce you to her</p>
<p>because I think you guys would really riff.</p>
<p>First of all, she was a former D1 athlete</p>
<p>and then runs a lab at Stanford in psychology.</p>
<p>This is Leah Crum.</p>
<p>And she grew up in this,</p>
<p>very athletic, obviously, and very, very smart.</p>
<p>And her laboratory focuses</p>
<p>on these belief-slash-placebo effects</p>
<p>where if you tell people</p>
<p>all the horrible things that stress do to you</p>
<p>in terms of your memory and cognitive functioning,</p>
<p>and then you give them a memory test,</p>
<p>they perform well below baseline.</p>
<p>If you tell them that stress sharpens them</p>
<p>in the short term,</p>
<p>and that adrenaline is this powerful molecule</p>
<p>that can really tune up a number of memory systems,</p>
<p>memory improves.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s consistent.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve done this for any number of different things,</p>
<p>including food allergies, for instance.</p>
<p>Incredible results.</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re bringing this up.</p>
<p>I take creatine monohydrate</p>
<p>and I have for years, five grams a day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I believe it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So is there a compound effect of believing it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>and it actually being great?</p>
<p>Not in this study.</p>
<p>But so I think the thing to point out,</p>
<p>people will misinterpret that as creatine doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what that says.</p>
<p>What it says is your beliefs about what it does</p>
<p>are probably just as powerful as what it does, right?</p>
<p>So they actually did a study,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have the citation,</p>
<p>but it was I think within the last 10 years,</p>
<p>where they told people</p>
<p>they were putting them on anabolic steroids.</p>
<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t you know it,</p>
<p>they had better gains,</p>
<p>even though they weren&rsquo;t actually on anabolic steroids,</p>
<p>they had better gains than people</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t tell were anabolic steroids.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like hard outcomes, strength, lean body mass,</p>
<p>you know, those sorts of things.</p>
<p>So when people say,</p>
<p>well, I wouldn&rsquo;t fall for the placebo effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, eh, you don&rsquo;t have to fall for it.</p>
<p>If you believe it to be true,</p>
<p>the power of belief is very, very powerful.</p>
<p>And as a scientist,</p>
<p>I wish sometimes I was ignorant</p>
<p>so that I could subject myself</p>
<p>to the placebo effect more often.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So kind of getting back to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a possible explanation of maybe why,</p>
<p>you know, and I&rsquo;m the same way,</p>
<p>like I get done with a workout,</p>
<p>like a resistance training session,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m ready to eat, right?</p>
<p>Now, if you look at the literature overall</p>
<p>on exercise and appetite,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not always what you&rsquo;d expect.</p>
<p>Consistently, it seems to show that exercise</p>
<p>actually has an appetite suppressant effect.</p>
<p>So people don&rsquo;t tend to compensate at least fully</p>
<p>for the amount of movement they do.</p>
<p>And there is some evidence that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve probably heard people say,</p>
<p>well, exercise is a really poor weight loss tool, right?</p>
<p>Like if you figure out how many calories</p>
<p>you should be burning from it and you do that,</p>
<p>you end up getting less weight loss</p>
<p>than you would predict.</p>
<p>I have a family member who is perfectly happy to eat less,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t loathe exercise, but dislikes exercise.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re of healthy weight,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m always encouraging them to exercise more.</p>
<p>And so this is an ongoing battle</p>
<p>in our sibling relationship.</p>
<p>Well, one thing I would say is that</p>
<p>exercise independent of anything</p>
<p>that happens with your body weight,</p>
<p>you will be healthier.</p>
<p>So exercise is one of the only things</p>
<p>that will actually improve your biomarkers of health</p>
<p>without even losing weight.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;ll improve your insulin sensitivity,</p>
<p>inflammation, all that stuff.</p>
<p>So everybody out there looking for a hack to be healthier,</p>
<p>exercise is the hack, right?</p>
<p>Crucial point.</p>
<p>And our mutual friend, Dr. Peter Atiyah,</p>
<p>I think has gone on record several times now saying that</p>
<p>of all the things that one could take,</p>
<p>et cetera, metformin of all,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not one takes those</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t take those,</p>
<p>that the positive effects on the longevity</p>
<p>by way of biomarkers from regular exercise</p>
<p>is far outweighs all of those things combined.</p>
<p>Not that those things don&rsquo;t necessarily work,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not going through them in detail now,</p>
<p>but that exercise is by far the best thing we can do</p>
<p>for our healthspan and lifespan.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I 100% agree.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re talking about weight loss,</p>
<p>people miss the point of exercise, I think.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some work that came out from Herman Ponser as well</p>
<p>that basically showed like,</p>
<p>well, if you do 100 calories from exercise,</p>
<p>you have a like 28 calorie reduction</p>
<p>in your basal metabolic rate in response to that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like this constrained energy expenditure</p>
<p>model, right?</p>
<p>But what I would say is, okay,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s still a net of 72, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still okay.</p>
<p>And the other thing is,</p>
<p>I think the effects of exercise on weight loss</p>
<p>are actually more due to what it does to appetite.</p>
<p>So if you look at people who lose weight</p>
<p>and keep it off for a number of years,</p>
<p>kind of outliers because most people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t keep it off for years,</p>
<p>over 70% of them engage in regular exercise.</p>
<p>Of people who do not keep weight loss,</p>
<p>like maintain weight loss,</p>
<p>less than 30% exercise regularly.</p>
<p>So now that&rsquo;s just a correlation</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily prove causation,</p>
<p>but there are some pretty compelling studies</p>
<p>showing that exercise increases your sensitivity</p>
<p>to satiety signals.</p>
<p>So basically you can have the same satiety signals,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re more sensitive to them when you exercise.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a really classic study</p>
<p>from the 1950s in Bengali workers,</p>
<p>where they looked at basically</p>
<p>four different quadrants of activity.</p>
<p>So you had sedentary, lightly active,</p>
<p>moderately active, heavily active.</p>
<p>Basically based on their job choice.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t have an intervention.</p>
<p>They just wanted to track them and see how much,</p>
<p>you know, how many calories did they actually eat?</p>
<p>So it was like a J-shaped curve.</p>
<p>So the sedentary actually ate more food</p>
<p>than the lightly active or moderately active,</p>
<p>but from lightly active to heavily active,</p>
<p>they almost perfectly compensated</p>
<p>how many calories they should be eating.</p>
<p>So to me, that suggests when you become active,</p>
<p>you can actually regulate your appetite appropriately</p>
<p>or much more appropriately than if you&rsquo;re sedentary.</p>
<p>And do you think this has to do with changes in the brain,</p>
<p>brain centers that respond to satiety signals</p>
<p>from the periphery?</p>
<p>And, or do you think it has to do with</p>
<p>changes in blood sugar regulation?</p>
<p>What I was taught,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if this is still considered true,</p>
<p>is that, you know, spikes in blood sugar</p>
<p>will trigger a desire to eat more,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s kind of exactly the opposite</p>
<p>of what you need when you have a spike in blood sugar.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this kind of,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get into this</p>
<p>when we talk about artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this idea in mind,</p>
<p>I think I adopted perhaps falsely,</p>
<p>that, you know, you eat something that&rsquo;s sweet</p>
<p>or that tastes really good</p>
<p>and you are suddenly on the train of wanting to eat more.</p>
<p>And I could imagine how exercise,</p>
<p>if it is increasing the satiety signals,</p>
<p>could be working in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the effect</p>
<p>is probably mostly at the brain level.</p>
<p>You know, the effects on blood sugar</p>
<p>and the research out there is not very compelling</p>
<p>for blood sugar driving appetite.</p>
<p>Now, if you become hypoglycemic,</p>
<p>yes, you&rsquo;ll get hungry,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a different kind of hunger than like your normal,</p>
<p>like I feel kind of empty and my stomach&rsquo;s growling.</p>
<p>Like those are, they can go together,</p>
<p>but usually like the hypoglycemia is like,</p>
<p>I am hot, I feel like I&rsquo;m gonna pass out.</p>
<p>Like you wanna eat something,</p>
<p>not because your stomach&rsquo;s growling,</p>
<p>but because you know that you just need some fuel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re getting pulled under.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there when I&rsquo;ve done longer fasts,</p>
<p>something I don&rsquo;t do anymore,</p>
<p>and drank a lot of black coffee.</p>
<p>There was probably an electrolyte effect there</p>
<p>because coffee has you excrete sodium</p>
<p>and other electrolytes.</p>
<p>And then just feeling like I needed something,</p>
<p>this whole thing, like I need something,</p>
<p>this kind of desperation.</p>
<p>I never wanna be back here again.</p>
<p>Hypoglycemia is very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>So, you know, again, when they,</p>
<p>and then when they look at, you know,</p>
<p>actual randomized control trials</p>
<p>of implementing some exercise</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re, you know, pretty controlled environment,</p>
<p>they typically see people, if anything,</p>
<p>they eat less as opposed to eating more.</p>
<p>Now, some people, again, that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>studies report averages, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s individual data points.</p>
<p>So there are some people who at least anecdotally report</p>
<p>that exercise makes them more hungry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s completely valid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now, it could be their beliefs around it.</p>
<p>It could be a number of different things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>that there is individual variability.</p>
<p>And I think one of the things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve learned to appreciate more</p>
<p>is not trying to separate psychology and physiology.</p>
<p>We do this a lot.</p>
<p>And so, well, I wanna know the physiology.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about the psychology of it.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m kind of appreciating more</p>
<p>psychology is physiology.</p>
<p>You know, that like with most things now</p>
<p>we have kind of the biopsychosocial model.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you an example of this.</p>
<p>A lot of people get really caught up with appetite.</p>
<p>And if we could just suppress people&rsquo;s appetite,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>But people don&rsquo;t just eat because they&rsquo;re hungry.</p>
<p>They eat for a lot of different reasons,</p>
<p>social reasons, especially.</p>
<p>So can you remember the last social event</p>
<p>you ever went to that didn&rsquo;t have food?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If you look at dinner plates from the 1800s,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re about this big.</p>
<p>Now, how big are dinner plates?</p>
<p>The whole buffet.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>If you, there&rsquo;s situational cues, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sitting down to watch TV.</p>
<p>Oh, grab some popcorn.</p>
<p>Grab some, you know, snack, whatever.</p>
<p>I even see this with, you know,</p>
<p>how one person will pick up their phone</p>
<p>and then everyone picks up their phone.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a similar effect with food.</p>
<p>Yeah, and same thing, right?</p>
<p>Like how many times have we either done it ourselves</p>
<p>or been experienced people saying,</p>
<p>oh, you should have some, you should have like,</p>
<p>you know, alcohol especially, right?</p>
<p>Like people will,</p>
<p>I was hanging out with somebody last night</p>
<p>and I had a beer and they just had, you know, a water.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I feel no need to try and convince them</p>
<p>to do that with me.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>But as humans, you know, we&rsquo;re kind of herd animals.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t want to be doing something out</p>
<p>in isolation on our own.</p>
<p>This is a very tenuous, I guess, belief of mine.</p>
<p>But, you know, doing things alone in isolation,</p>
<p>you know, during kind of, you know, ancestral times,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna set off your alarm system, you know?</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t have other people,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t protect yourself, right?</p>
<p>So typically things were done together in groups.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a lot of the reason</p>
<p>why we tend to be just tribal in nature</p>
<p>about a lot of things, right?</p>
<p>So the whole point to that is, you know,</p>
<p>on the list of reasons why people eat,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where I think</p>
<p>that hunger is actually not even the main reason people eat.</p>
<p>You know, stress, lack of sleep.</p>
<p>Boredom.</p>
<p>Boredom?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So unless, you know, we can do something</p>
<p>that addresses all those things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a line from a review paper.</p>
<p>This review paper came out in 2011</p>
<p>by a researcher named McLean.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the best review paper I&rsquo;ve ever read.</p>
<p>It was called,</p>
<p>Biology&rsquo;s Response to Dieting,</p>
<p>The Impetus for Weight Regain.</p>
<p>And basically went through all the mechanisms</p>
<p>of these adaptations that happen during fat loss diets</p>
<p>and how biology&rsquo;s response is to try to drive you back</p>
<p>to your previous.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna butcher the quote,</p>
<p>but at the end of the study,</p>
<p>he said, basically,</p>
<p>the body&rsquo;s systems are comprehensive,</p>
<p>redundant, and well-focused</p>
<p>on restoring depleted energy reserves.</p>
<p>And any attempt or any kind of strategy for weight loss</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t attempt to address a broad spectrum</p>
<p>of these things is going to fail.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why when people say,</p>
<p>well, just do low carb, you won&rsquo;t be hungry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, but people don&rsquo;t just eat</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re hungry.</p>
<p>So I think really like trying to get outside the box</p>
<p>and think about these things.</p>
<p>And especially when you read some of the literature,</p>
<p>I recently read a systematic review</p>
<p>of successful weight loss maintainers,</p>
<p>which I thought was really interesting.</p>
<p>So they took people who had lost a significant amount</p>
<p>of body weight and kept it off for,</p>
<p>I think it was three years.</p>
<p>And they basically asked them questions</p>
<p>and tried to identify commonalities.</p>
<p>And there were some things that I expected</p>
<p>like cognitive restraint, self-monitoring,</p>
<p>exercise.</p>
<p>And then one of the things they said</p>
<p>that I found really fascinating</p>
<p>was pretty ubiquitous between people.</p>
<p>They said, I had to develop a new identity.</p>
<p>So are you familiar with Ethan Supley?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So Ethan is a actor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been in like, remember the Titans</p>
<p>and American History X.</p>
<p>I certainly saw American History X.</p>
<p>Yeah, so he was very large.</p>
<p>Like he was like 550 pounds</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s like 230 and jacked.</p>
<p>Wait, he was how much?</p>
<p>550 pounds.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And whenever he puts a post on his Instagram</p>
<p>of him training, it&rsquo;ll say, I killed my clone today.</p>
<p>And I asked him, like, is this what you&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Like creating a new identity.</p>
<p>And he said, this is exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>because I had to kill who I was</p>
<p>because there was no way I was gonna be able</p>
<p>to make long-term changes</p>
<p>if I just didn&rsquo;t become a new person.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s, I mean, and addicts talk about this, right?</p>
<p>Like people who are alcoholics,</p>
<p>they had to get new friends.</p>
<p>They had to hang out at different places</p>
<p>because their entire life had been set up</p>
<p>around this lifestyle for alcohol.</p>
<p>And I would actually argue that eating disorders</p>
<p>or disordered eating patterns is much harder to break</p>
<p>than other forms of addiction.</p>
<p>And think about food addiction.</p>
<p>Well, in some ways, bulimia and anorexia</p>
<p>are still addictions.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t stop eating.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re an alcoholic, you can abstain from alcohol.</p>
<p>If you become addicted to, say, cocaine,</p>
<p>you can abstain from that.</p>
<p>You can never abstain from food.</p>
<p>And so now imagine telling a gambling addict,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;ve gotta play this slot a couple times a day,</p>
<p>but no more.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s really challenging.</p>
<p>So yeah, I just like all this stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so important to be comprehensive</p>
<p>with how we treat these things.</p>
<p>These are incredibly important points.</p>
<p>And to my knowledge, I don&rsquo;t think anyone</p>
<p>has really described it in a cohesive way</p>
<p>the way that you&rsquo;re doing here.</p>
<p>So important for people to understand this</p>
<p>because obviously as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>I think the nervous system is creating our thoughts.</p>
<p>Our thoughts and feelings are related to psychology.</p>
<p>And therefore, of course, our physiology</p>
<p>and our psychology are one in the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bi-directional.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest in brain body,</p>
<p>in particular gut-brain access.</p>
<p>And we can talk about that.</p>
<p>But I really appreciate that you&rsquo;re spelling out</p>
<p>how there are these different variables.</p>
<p>Each one can account for a number of different things.</p>
<p>Exercise clearly has a remarkably potent effect,</p>
<p>both during the exercise in terms of caloric burn,</p>
<p>overall health and biomarkers.</p>
<p>And then this is wonderful to learn</p>
<p>that it can increase the sensitivity to satiety signals.</p>
<p>I think that makes, at least in my mind,</p>
<p>places very high on the list of things</p>
<p>that people should absolutely do.</p>
<p>But that there are other factors too.</p>
<p>And the identity piece is fascinating.</p>
<p>It reminds me also, your story reminds me also</p>
<p>of David Goggins, who is, you know,</p>
<p>he talks about his former very overweight self</p>
<p>almost as if it was a different person.</p>
<p>And he uses language that I&rsquo;m not gonna use here.</p>
<p>I met David, know David a bit,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s every bit as intense and driven</p>
<p>and a remarkable human being as he appears to be online.</p>
<p>He is that guy.</p>
<p>But it does seem like he had to more or less kill off</p>
<p>a former version of himself</p>
<p>and continues to do that every day.</p>
<p>And I think what your point about this other fellow</p>
<p>who does it through a similar process,</p>
<p>the word today seems to really matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you defeat this former version of yourself</p>
<p>and then that person is buried and gone.</p>
<p>You said, you know, I killed my clone today.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way that David talks about it also.</p>
<p>So this is a daily process.</p>
<p>And I think this is not just a small detail</p>
<p>in tying together all these things.</p>
<p>I think that what you are describing is fundamental</p>
<p>because we can pull on each one of these variables</p>
<p>and talk about each one of them.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a cohesive whole as an individual.</p>
<p>Sorry, you were about to say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually one of my favorite topics,</p>
<p>which is, you know, why do we have such a hard time</p>
<p>with losing weight, but more so keeping it off?</p>
<p>Because of obese people,</p>
<p>six out of every seven obese people</p>
<p>will lose a significant amount of body weight in their life.</p>
<p>So why do we still have an obesity problem?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t keep it off.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they keep it off?</p>
<p>When you look at the research,</p>
<p>basically what it suggests is,</p>
<p>because people think about I&rsquo;m going to do a diet</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to lose this weight,</p>
<p>and they do not give any thought</p>
<p>to what happens afterwards, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, think about if you have</p>
<p>some kind of chronic disease or a diabetic, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just take insulin once and that&rsquo;s it, right?</p>
<p>You got to take it continuously,</p>
<p>otherwise you&rsquo;re going to have problems.</p>
<p>If you do a diet and you lose, you know, 30 pounds, fantastic.</p>
<p>But if you then just go back to all your old habits,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go back to where you were, if not more.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t create a new version of yourself</p>
<p>while dragging your old habits and behaviors behind you.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ll tell people is,</p>
<p>because people say, well, I&rsquo;m doing a carnivore diet</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m doing this diet or that diet.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Do you see yourself doing that for the rest of your life?</p>
<p>And if the answer is yes,</p>
<p>if you really believe that that&rsquo;s going to be sustainable for you</p>
<p>and plenty of people, low carb, intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>whatever they say, felt easy.</p>
<p>You know, I could do this forever, great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to lose weight,</p>
<p>you have to invoke some form of restriction,</p>
<p>whether it is a nutrient restriction,</p>
<p>like low carb, low fat, a time restriction,</p>
<p>intermittent fasting, any form of time restricted eating,</p>
<p>or calorie restriction, tracking macros, whatever.</p>
<p>So you get to pick the form of restriction.</p>
<p>So pick the form of restriction</p>
<p>that feels the least restrictive to you as an individual.</p>
<p>And also do not assume</p>
<p>that it will feel the same for everybody else.</p>
<p>Because I made this mistake,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, I track things.</p>
<p>And so I allow myself to eat a variety of foods.</p>
<p>I allow myself to eat some fun foods.</p>
<p>But I track everything.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m able to modify my body composition</p>
<p>and be in good health doing that.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&rsquo;t feel hard for me.</p>
<p>Part of it is I&rsquo;ve just been doing it for so long.</p>
<p>But to other people, that&rsquo;s very stressful.</p>
<p>They said, well, I&rsquo;d rather just not eat for 16 hours.</p>
<p>If that feels easy for them, do that.</p>
<p>Because the one thing that&hellip;</p>
<p>There was a couple of meta-analyses on popular diets.</p>
<p>And basically what they showed</p>
<p>was they were all equally terrible for long-term weight loss.</p>
<p>But when they stratified them by adherence,</p>
<p>and none of them were better for adherence overall,</p>
<p>but when they stratified people</p>
<p>just according from lowest adherence to best adherence,</p>
<p>it was a linear effect on weight loss.</p>
<p>So really what it says is,</p>
<p>what is the diet that&rsquo;s going to be easiest for you to adhere to</p>
<p>in the long term?</p>
<p>And you should probably do that.</p>
<p>And people&hellip;</p>
<p>Again, this is where I step back and take the 10,000-foot view.</p>
<p>Somebody will say, well, I&rsquo;m going to do ketogenic</p>
<p>because I want to increase my fat oxidation</p>
<p>and I want to do this.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re talking about all these mechanisms and everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Can you do it for the rest of your life?</p>
<p>Is this going to be something sustainable for you?</p>
<p>And if the answer is no,</p>
<p>you probably need to rethink what your approach is going to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredibly important message.</p>
<p>Basically that.</p>
<p>If I could highlight&hellip;</p>
<p>If there was a version of highlighter, boldface, and underline</p>
<p>in the podcast space,</p>
<p>I would highlight boldface and underline what you just said.</p>
<p>And for those of you that heard it,</p>
<p>listen to it twice and then go forward because it&rsquo;s absolutely key.</p>
<p>I think it also explains a lot of the so-called controversy</p>
<p>that exists out there.</p>
<p>I think it also crosses over with the placebo effect.</p>
<p>I almost want to say,</p>
<p>pick the nutrition plan that you think you can stick to</p>
<p>for a long period of time, ideally forever.</p>
<p>And pick your placebo too</p>
<p>because there is a lot of placebo woven into each and every one of these things.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting, keto,</p>
<p>probably even vegan versus omnivore versus carnivore.</p>
<p>Well, they even talk about the diet honeymoon period, right?</p>
<p>Where you go into a diet and you&rsquo;re all fired up about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very adherent.</p>
<p>And then what happens with every single diet,</p>
<p>without exception in research studies,</p>
<p>is once you get past a few months,</p>
<p>adherence just starts waning and going off.</p>
<p>Here we are really talking about a form of relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that to be tongue-in-cheek.</p>
<p>Actually, we had a guest early on in the podcast, Dr. Karl Deisseroth.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a psychiatrist and bioengineer at Stanford.</p>
<p>Tremendously successful Lasker Award winner, etc.</p>
<p>And he talked about love as an interesting aspect of our psychology</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a story that you co-create with somebody,</p>
<p>but that you live into the future of that story.</p>
<p>When you pair up with somebody,</p>
<p>he was referring to romantic love,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this sort of mutual agreement</p>
<p>to create this idea that you&rsquo;re going to live into.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about how you feel in the moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also that you project into the future quite a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of parallels with a highly functional and effective diet.</p>
<p>And I love it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not setting this parallel up artificially.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m setting it up because I think that ultimately</p>
<p>it boils down to what you said earlier,</p>
<p>which is that the brain and our decisions</p>
<p>about what we are going to stick to are tremendously powerful.</p>
<p>I think one thing I will say is keep in mind</p>
<p>when you look at the research data,</p>
<p>the meta-analyses on, say, time-restricted eating versus non,</p>
<p>when calories are equated,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a difference in weight loss, fat loss,</p>
<p>in most biomarkers of health.</p>
<p>Same thing for low-carb versus low-fat.</p>
<p>If you equate calories and protein,</p>
<p>there was a meta-analysis done by Kevin Hall back in 2017</p>
<p>where they looked at the, and again, actual loss of body fat.</p>
<p>And another important point was,</p>
<p>I think there was 22 studies in this,</p>
<p>but all of them provided food to the participants, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important because that ensures</p>
<p>that adherence can be much higher in those studies,</p>
<p>whereas various free-living studies,</p>
<p>sometimes you can see funky results.</p>
<p>People are sneaking food or they&rsquo;re just not really eating</p>
<p>the way that the study would ideally have them eat.</p>
<p>Unless the person is getting continuous support,</p>
<p>like studies where they have a dietician talk to people every week</p>
<p>tend to actually have pretty good adherence.</p>
<p>But I mean, that&rsquo;s expensive to have done the study.</p>
<p>And again, like what limits studies?</p>
<p>Money, money, and money, right?</p>
<p>But the low-carb versus low-fat,</p>
<p>when protein and calories are equated,</p>
<p>basically no difference in fat loss.</p>
<p>Now, some people get upset about this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, well, to me, that&rsquo;s like, this is great</p>
<p>because you get to pick the tool you want.</p>
<p>The one tool, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be that much better than another,</p>
<p>so pick the one that works for you, right?</p>
<p>Whatever lever you&rsquo;ve got to pull, you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of different options.</p>
<p>You mentioned picking something you can stick to for a period of time.</p>
<p>Is there ever a case for someone saying,</p>
<p>look, I like to eat low-carb or even keto for six months</p>
<p>and then switch to a more standard omnivore,</p>
<p>caloric maintenance type diet, and then switch back?</p>
<p>Is there any downside to doing that for sake of health</p>
<p>or weight loss over time or weight maintenance over time?</p>
<p>Because I realize not everyone is trying to lose weight.</p>
<p>And I definitely want to talk about, at some point,</p>
<p>how to eat to maintain weight</p>
<p>because I think there are a significant fraction of people out there</p>
<p>who are trying to do that.</p>
<p>But is there any downside to being a dabbler,</p>
<p>keto for a few months and then omnivore for a few months, et cetera?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually a great thing,</p>
<p>especially to maybe find what you feel is easiest for you, right?</p>
<p>But in terms of like as a strategy,</p>
<p>I mean I guess some people, this might get into dopamine,</p>
<p>but like, oh, change and get something new</p>
<p>and you feel a little bit more positive about it.</p>
<p>A new partner model.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s how I would usually set things up initially for somebody.</p>
<p>But if somebody said, hey, I just like to have some variety and change it up,</p>
<p>as long as they&rsquo;re still like their behaviors</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing portion control or whatever it is</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re able to sustain a calorie deficit</p>
<p>or depending on whatever their goal is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s really any downside to it.</p>
<p>I do think the one thing to keep in mind is</p>
<p>when you look at like going between extremes,</p>
<p>so like low fat to low carb or vice versa,</p>
<p>there can be in that transition period a little bit of weirdness,</p>
<p>for lack of a better term.</p>
<p>Like for example, if you&rsquo;ve been on a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you move to like a higher carb diet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be like basically insulin resistant</p>
<p>for just a short period of time.</p>
<p>Now, is that going to cause any health problems?</p>
<p>Probably not in the long term,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re still controlling calories.</p>
<p>But just because your body has kind of like upregulated these systems,</p>
<p>dealing mostly with fat and glucose production</p>
<p>rather than glucose metabolism,</p>
<p>so now if you start taking glucose or carbohydrate back in,</p>
<p>like for example, you get somebody on a glucose tolerance test</p>
<p>after they&rsquo;ve been on keto,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll do pretty terribly at it.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t last that long.</p>
<p>About how long?</p>
<p>A few weeks.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s important for people to know</p>
<p>because I have a feeling during those first few weeks</p>
<p>are the period of time when a lot of people go running back</p>
<p>to what they were doing previously,</p>
<p>which is not to say that they shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve certainly done that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried a very low carbohydrate diet</p>
<p>and I would have assumed, and now I know I&rsquo;m completely wrong,</p>
<p>but I assumed that I was so carbohydrate starved for so long</p>
<p>that my insulin sensitivity,</p>
<p>which is a good thing by the way, folks,</p>
<p>would have gone through the roof</p>
<p>and I would be able to just sponge up every bit of glucose</p>
<p>that I would have ingested through carbohydrate.</p>
<p>So I did indeed switch over</p>
<p>and I felt like I had pretty terrible brain fog.</p>
<p>I even got some jitters and I thought, wait, what is this?</p>
<p>My blood sugar was low before.</p>
<p>Now my blood sugar should be in more moderate territory.</p>
<p>But based on what you just said,</p>
<p>I had upregulated the enzymes and systems in the body</p>
<p>for fat metabolism on the keto diet</p>
<p>and then switching over.</p>
<p>There was basically a ramping up of the molecules involved in,</p>
<p>presumably in glycolysis.</p>
<p>Transition period.</p>
<p>I mean, think about like if you haven&rsquo;t weight trained before</p>
<p>and you start weight training,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel pretty terrible, right?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re going to be sore and stiff and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I will say you aren&rsquo;t necessarily wrong</p>
<p>in what you said about being more insulin sensitive</p>
<p>because it depends on how you measure insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>So if you measure with something like fasting blood glucose</p>
<p>or fasting insulin or even HOMA-IR,</p>
<p>those tend to be pretty good on low carb.</p>
<p>But then if you do an oral glucose tolerance test,</p>
<p>it tends to be pretty bad.</p>
<p>And so it depends on your specific measure, right?</p>
<p>So I think that the idea that keto makes you glucose intolerant</p>
<p>or insulin resistant, I think, again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a transition period and I&rsquo;m not too worried about it.</p>
<p>But there is something important to keep in mind</p>
<p>and one of the reasons like if somebody was to transition out of keto,</p>
<p>typically if like I&rsquo;m working with them</p>
<p>or one of our coaches are working with them,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll kind of instruct them to do it like slowly</p>
<p>and kind of systematically over like a four to eight week period.</p>
<p>That way hopefully they&rsquo;re not having that period of two weeks</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re like, oh man, why do I feel so terrible?</p>
<p>Very important point.</p>
<p>I want to go to the other end literally and figuratively</p>
<p>and talk about gut health.</p>
<p>Because up until now-</p>
<p>I see what you did with that pun.</p>
<p>And certainly in the last few minutes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about sort of top-down processes,</p>
<p>the brain, the psychology, placebo effects,</p>
<p>but the very real aspects of those.</p>
<p>Not that I can imagine 2,000 calories is 1,000 calories</p>
<p>and somehow change the law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve been sort of top-down</p>
<p>and integrating a lot of different ideas</p>
<p>into weight loss maintenance and weight gain.</p>
<p>But gut health,</p>
<p>at least the more popular studies on gut health,</p>
<p>have kind of blown a lot of things out of the water.</p>
<p>For instance, this idea that you could take obese mice</p>
<p>and literally give them fecal transplants from lean mice.</p>
<p>And yes, that sounds like what it sounds like.</p>
<p>Fecal transplants definitely inserted</p>
<p>through the same end in which it comes out.</p>
<p>And I point that out because a lot of people have asked me.</p>
<p>It was kind of scary to me.</p>
<p>I thought, yes, this is not about ingesting feces.</p>
<p>They literally do a transplant of feces from lean mice</p>
<p>into obese mice, and the obese mice get lean.</p>
<p>And yes, this has been done in humans.</p>
<p>Limited number of studies and observed</p>
<p>some pretty impressive effects on weight loss</p>
<p>that I have to assume could be related to placebo effect.</p>
<p>They might have told these obese people,</p>
<p>hey, look, you&rsquo;re going to get lean</p>
<p>through this fecal transplant from lean people.</p>
<p>But more likely, it had some effect</p>
<p>on their core physiology.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which aspects, although I</p>
<p>can speculate which ones.</p>
<p>And they became leaner.</p>
<p>They lost weight.</p>
<p>And that is, in some sense, miraculous,</p>
<p>especially given the important role of psychology and exercise</p>
<p>and satiety signals, because I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to assume that they controlled for a number</p>
<p>of those other variables, although no study is perfect.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about gut health</p>
<p>as it relates to metabolism, energy utilization, and balance?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the first thing I&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m not a gut health expert, but I</p>
<p>feel relatively comfortable talking about it</p>
<p>based on conversations I&rsquo;ve had with people who are experts,</p>
<p>one being Suzanne Devcota, who&rsquo;s, are you familiar with her?</p>
<p>Well, she&rsquo;s sort of a phenom in this area,</p>
<p>from what I understand.</p>
<p>So she was actually doing her master&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>I was doing my PhD in Lehman&rsquo;s Lab.</p>
<p>So she was one of my lab mates.</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>And the other thing to say is even gut health experts,</p>
<p>and Suzanne will tell you this, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>talk to me in 20 years.</p>
<p>We just know so little.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an overall thing that people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>is the scientific consensus moves very, very slow.</p>
<p>And probably for good reason, because if we just</p>
<p>flipped our scientific consensus based on one study,</p>
<p>I mean, it would be a mess, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to take time before you really</p>
<p>understand the implications of the gut and what it means.</p>
<p>So when it comes to weight loss, there probably</p>
<p>is a role in there.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve seen that there&rsquo;s something going on.</p>
<p>Now, whether that&rsquo;s, is it something</p>
<p>where a gut microbiome makeup that&rsquo;s more obese resistant,</p>
<p>perhaps it extracts less calories out</p>
<p>of the food you eat, right?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it&rsquo;s elevating BMR.</p>
<p>Although I think that that&rsquo;s probably somewhat unlikely.</p>
<p>Do you think it could impact the way satiety signals are?</p>
<p>I mean, back to the brain again is the question.</p>
<p>So we know that there&rsquo;s a link in the gut-brain axis.</p>
<p>And so my suspicion is that it probably</p>
<p>is working via appetite regulation.</p>
<p>So I mean, if we look at the most effective obesity</p>
<p>treatments out there, which is like semaglutide,</p>
<p>I mean, you consistently see a 15% on average</p>
<p>loss of body weight, which is massive.</p>
<p>And people keep it off.</p>
<p>That is a GLP-1 memetic, which is a gut hormone.</p>
<p>And it basically just is a very, very powerful appetite</p>
<p>suppressant.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I&rsquo;m interrupting, but hopefully with a purpose.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this really interesting study.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in mice, admittedly, but published</p>
<p>in a neuroscience journal recently.</p>
<p>And basically the takeaway is that like so many things</p>
<p>in neuroscience, the GLP-1 works in two parallel pathways.</p>
<p>In the brain, it seems to impact neurons</p>
<p>in the hypothalamus that control satiety.</p>
<p>So exactly what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And in the gut, it seems to create an activation</p>
<p>of the mechanosensors in the gut.</p>
<p>So the perception is that the gut is full or fuller.</p>
<p>I should say not full, because I think people</p>
<p>who take semaglutide don&rsquo;t feel bloated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They might.</p>
<p>But that one feels as if their gut is actually fuller</p>
<p>because these mechanosensors that stretch</p>
<p>are sending signals to the brain.</p>
<p>Oh, I actually have some food.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not empty down there.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m tickled by this result, mostly</p>
<p>because every time I hear about a drug or a molecule having</p>
<p>an effect, we think it has an effect at one location.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of interesting that, especially</p>
<p>for something like appetite regulation,</p>
<p>that it would be impacting body and brain in parallel.</p>
<p>Anyway, forgive me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>You can tell I&rsquo;m really excited about this.</p>
<p>And here, you are telling a neuroscientist, me,</p>
<p>that a lot perhaps circles back to these brain</p>
<p>mechanisms of satiety.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that, and especially looking</p>
<p>at the research on leptin, we used to think, OK,</p>
<p>metabolism is mostly like liver-based.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s metabolism in the adipocyte</p>
<p>and skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>But none of this stuff exists in isolation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much crosstalk between these pathways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, when we get into mechanisms,</p>
<p>the one of the things, I love mechanisms.</p>
<p>But one of the things I tell people</p>
<p>is keep in mind that when you&rsquo;re dealing with an outcome,</p>
<p>so like when I say outcome-based,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about physical outcomes like weight loss,</p>
<p>fat loss, changes in blood markers, whatever.</p>
<p>That is the summation of thousands</p>
<p>of different mechanisms.</p>
<p>So sure, sometimes you can affect a mechanistic pathway,</p>
<p>and you get kind of straight down the line outcome.</p>
<p>But not always.</p>
<p>Whenever you make a treatment or kind of anything</p>
<p>into the system, it&rsquo;s like throwing a pebble in a lake.</p>
<p>It creates ripples.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t always know what those are going to be, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, I mean, we&rsquo;ve seen certain drugs.</p>
<p>Well, it works on this pathway.</p>
<p>And then they list off all the side effects.</p>
<p>And you go, well, how would it create that many side effects?</p>
<p>Because nothing, for the most part,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t just work in one place.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a multitude of places it works.</p>
<p>And to your point about semi-glutide</p>
<p>and the effects on mechanosensors,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably why a lot of people</p>
<p>report actually kind of like low-grade nausea</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re using semi-glutide.</p>
<p>Because of that.</p>
<p>Because that feeling is usually not</p>
<p>like a real comfortable feeling.</p>
<p>But I mean, it will get you to not eat.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s absolutely likely a connection.</p>
<p>But we haven&rsquo;t fully elucidated how that works.</p>
<p>And when you think about how complicated the gut is,</p>
<p>I think I heard something like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more cells in our microbiome by far</p>
<p>than there are in our body.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re actually more, in terms of a cell-per-cell level,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually more bacteria than we are eukaryote, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Justin Sonnenberg,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of the world experts on microbiome.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in the lab upstairs from mine at Stanford.</p>
<p>And he has this idea, it&rsquo;s just an idea,</p>
<p>that because we are indeed more bacteria than we are cells,</p>
<p>the question is who&rsquo;s the host and who&rsquo;s the passenger?</p>
<p>You know, like maybe we are just,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re exploiting us to take them around and interact</p>
<p>because they interact and grow on one another.</p>
<p>And so this idea, this freaks people out.</p>
<p>Lex Friedman will love this,</p>
<p>that maybe human beings are just actually the vehicles</p>
<p>for the microbiome and not the other way around.</p>
<p>Anyway, kind of a scary thought.</p>
<p>Do you do anything specifically to support your gut microbiome?</p>
<p>Are you a probiotic guy or a fermented foods guy</p>
<p>or a fiber guy?</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m going to kind of go straight down the line</p>
<p>from what I&rsquo;ve heard from Suzanne and other experts.</p>
<p>So if you want to improve gut health,</p>
<p>one of the biggest levers,</p>
<p>the three biggest levers you can pull</p>
<p>is not eating too many calories, exercising.</p>
<p>There is a connection between exercise in the gut and fiber.</p>
<p>So we, it is, of the things we know,</p>
<p>dietary fiber seems to positively impact the gut</p>
<p>because it is a, what&rsquo;s called a prebiotic.</p>
<p>So your gut microbiota can take, especially soluble fiber,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s actually some evidence, at least in mice,</p>
<p>that it might be able to use some insoluble fiber as well.</p>
<p>I think Suzanne was doing a study looking at hemicellulose</p>
<p>and actually seeing that some specific forms of microbiota</p>
<p>flourish with hemicellulose,</p>
<p>suggesting that they may actually be getting</p>
<p>some kind of fuel out of it, which is really interesting.</p>
<p>But again, in mice, so just huge caveat.</p>
<p>So your gut microbiome can produce these short-chain fatty acids</p>
<p>from, by fermenting this soluble fiber,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s quite a bit of evidence</p>
<p>that these volatile fatty acids,</p>
<p>which can be then actually reabsorbed into the liver,</p>
<p>that they have some positive effects.</p>
<p>Like, for example, butyrate,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;ve done butyrate supplementation,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve actually seen positive effects on insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>So what we seem to understand</p>
<p>is that more diversity seems to be better,</p>
<p>fiber seems to be positive,</p>
<p>prebiotics seem to work much better than probiotics.</p>
<p>Supplemented prebiotics.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So the problem with most of the probiotics</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re typically not concentrated enough</p>
<p>to actually colonize.</p>
<p>And even if you do colonize,</p>
<p>what happens is, like, let&rsquo;s say you colonize some microbiota</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t really have much of.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not fueling it with the appropriate fiber,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to stay anyway</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s essentially going to starve.</p>
<p>So the research seems to really clearly suggest</p>
<p>that eating enough fiber, which is, again, a prebiotic,</p>
<p>that that is a better way to get a healthier gut per se</p>
<p>than probiotic.</p>
<p>What fiber sources do you use?</p>
<p>And I realize there&rsquo;s a huge array of choices out there,</p>
<p>but people will want to have some ideas</p>
<p>as to how they could perhaps mimic what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I would just say diversity, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s various evidence</p>
<p>from various different fiber sources.</p>
<p>Fruits and vegetables, obviously.</p>
<p>You know, grains, some whole grains,</p>
<p>some cereals, and then various other sources.</p>
<p>So this is one of the things</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t really have a good idea</p>
<p>if, you know, this one source of fiber</p>
<p>is better than another source of fiber.</p>
<p>We just know that fiber overall is pretty good.</p>
<p>And one thing I&rsquo;ll tell people is, like,</p>
<p>if you want a longevity hack,</p>
<p>I mean, fiber is kind of the longevity hack.</p>
<p>If you look at some of these cohort studies,</p>
<p>there was actually a recent really large meta-analysis</p>
<p>of over a million subjects.</p>
<p>And basically what it showed was</p>
<p>that for every 10-gram increase in fiber,</p>
<p>there was a 10% reduction in the risk of mortality.</p>
<p>And that extended specifically also</p>
<p>to cardiovascular disease and cancer.</p>
<p>So one of the things I&rsquo;ll tell people</p>
<p>when they get, like, really into, you know,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s intermittent fasting</p>
<p>or, you know, all these other things,</p>
<p>say, that&rsquo;s great, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Are you eating, like, over 50, 60 grams of fiber a day?</p>
<p>And I just conceptualize 50 to 60 grams.</p>
<p>So if I were to eat, like, a bowl,</p>
<p>like a, let&rsquo;s just say a quarter plate of broccoli,</p>
<p>and the broccoli isn&rsquo;t stacked to the ceiling.</p>
<p>The broccoli is just reasonably stacked on there.</p>
<p>Approximately how many grams of fiber is that?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s, like, two cups of broccoli.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you, like, 200 grams of broccoli per se</p>
<p>would probably be, like, five, six grams of fiber.</p>
<p>And I need to get how much per day, ideally?</p>
<p>Well, I would say, I would,</p>
<p>typically what the recommended dose is</p>
<p>is 15 grams per 1,000 calories intake.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re eating, you know, low calories,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to get enough fiber in.</p>
<p>But based on, and again, these are cohort studies, so,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t do 20-year-long</p>
<p>randomized human control trials, unfortunately.</p>
<p>There doesn&rsquo;t really appear to be a top end,</p>
<p>at least for the benefits of fiber.</p>
<p>It probably boils down to, like,</p>
<p>how much you can tolerate without feeling uncomfortable, right?</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re eating, like, a ton of fiber,</p>
<p>I mean, at some point,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be very comfortable.</p>
<p>Yeah, exercise becomes uncomfortable or hazardous, yeah.</p>
<p>And actually, kind of touching on that,</p>
<p>because I think it is important.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people have kind of,</p>
<p>in the carnivore community, said,</p>
<p>well, you don&rsquo;t need fiber.</p>
<p>You poop just fine without it.</p>
<p>And I always say, well,</p>
<p>pooping is the last reason to have fiber.</p>
<p>Like, yes, it does help.</p>
<p>It does seem to make elimination easier.</p>
<p>You can, you know, do it more frequently,</p>
<p>adds bulk to stool.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not why you should eat fiber.</p>
<p>Why you should eat fiber</p>
<p>is because of the effects of mortality.</p>
<p>And, you know, some of the pushback will be,</p>
<p>well, this is healthy user bias.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ll say is.</p>
<p>Meaning healthy people do this,</p>
<p>and therefore it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>Healthy people eat more fiber, and therefore.</p>
<p>And, I mean, yeah, there&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>But if it was just healthy user bias,</p>
<p>typically you would see some disagreement</p>
<p>between the studies.</p>
<p>And a great example of that is, like, red meat.</p>
<p>So, not every study shows red meat</p>
<p>has an association with cancer and mortality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s differences depending on the population used,</p>
<p>depending on, like, what they define as high red meat,</p>
<p>low red meat, whether it&rsquo;s processed, unprocessed.</p>
<p>But I have not found a study on fiber</p>
<p>and cardiovascular disease and cancer and mortality</p>
<p>where it did not show improvements from higher fiber.</p>
<p>So, to me, that suggests that that effect is real.</p>
<p>And so, again, you know,</p>
<p>as much fiber as you can get in comfortably,</p>
<p>I would try to do it.</p>
<p>Because it seems to have some really powerful effects</p>
<p>and is good for the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>The other thing that may be a consideration</p>
<p>for the microbiome is there&rsquo;s some evidence</p>
<p>that saturated fat may not be great for the microbiome,</p>
<p>that it reduces the prevalence</p>
<p>of some of the more positive strains of bacteria.</p>
<p>And that appears to be not so much</p>
<p>from the saturated fat itself,</p>
<p>but from the bile end products</p>
<p>that combine with saturated fat.</p>
<p>Seems to have a negative effect</p>
<p>on some of these more healthier forms of gut microbiota.</p>
<p>But, again, this is really difficult</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t even know necessarily yet</p>
<p>which species of gut microbiota are positive or negative.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I mean, this gets into some of these studies</p>
<p>where they may call it dysbiosis.</p>
<p>Sounds scary, but dysbiosis just means that the gut changed.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily, I mean,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t tell you anything qualitative</p>
<p>about whether the change was bad or good.</p>
<p>And so these are just things I think we need to keep in mind</p>
<p>when we talk about this stuff,</p>
<p>but this stuff is still very much in its infancy.</p>
<p>But in terms of the big levers,</p>
<p>I mean, it pretty much fits</p>
<p>with what we know about a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Exercise, don&rsquo;t eat too much,</p>
<p>consume a good amount of fiber from diverse sources.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Fantastic because it fits with what I like to think of</p>
<p>as kind of the center of mass of evidence, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m starting to get some window</p>
<p>into what your process is around selection of studies</p>
<p>and no one study being holy.</p>
<p>But when you look at, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>all the studies on fiber having a positive effect</p>
<p>to some degree or another,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty hard to refute that</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t something really interesting there.</p>
<p>And one thing I&rsquo;ll tell people is like, you know, one study,</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes I&rsquo;ll change my opinion</p>
<p>based on a single study</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s really well done and very powerful.</p>
<p>But usually like one study is just going to move me</p>
<p>just a little bit, right?</p>
<p>And then maybe if another one comes up,</p>
<p>move me a little bit more, right?</p>
<p>And then like very slowly, I&rsquo;m going to get some,</p>
<p>I mean, my experience with LDL cholesterol,</p>
<p>this is something I changed my mind on a while back</p>
<p>when I was younger, like circa 2005,</p>
<p>getting into grad school,</p>
<p>kind of the prevailing thought was,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s not so much the LDL,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the ratio of LDL to HDL that&rsquo;s what matters.</p>
<p>And probably about five years ago,</p>
<p>and I was pretty strong about that opinion.</p>
<p>And then five years ago,</p>
<p>looking at these Mendelian randomization studies,</p>
<p>I kind of went, I can&rsquo;t hold this position anymore.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your new, what is your revised position on LDL?</p>
<p>So, if you look at the research,</p>
<p>HDL is important because it&rsquo;s a marker of metabolic health.</p>
<p>If you have high HDL,</p>
<p>it suggests that you are metabolically quite healthy.</p>
<p>You very rarely will you have high HDL</p>
<p>and like high CRP, which is an inflammatory marker,</p>
<p>or dysregulated blood glucose,</p>
<p>almost exclusively people who have high HDL</p>
<p>will have good biomarkers of metabolic health.</p>
<p>But if you take drugs that raise HDL,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>In Mendelian randomization studies,</p>
<p>which Mendelian randomization basically uses natural randomization.</p>
<p>So, some people are, in the case of HDL,</p>
<p>naturally higher secretors or naturally lower secretors of HDL.</p>
<p>And, you know, we talked about how you can&rsquo;t really do</p>
<p>a 20-year human randomized control trial.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re trying to examine something like heart disease,</p>
<p>I mean, that is a lifetime exposure issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unlikely that you&rsquo;re going to pick out differences</p>
<p>between treatments in two years or even five years.</p>
<p>I mean, people don&rsquo;t develop,</p>
<p>typically don&rsquo;t develop heart disease</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re in their, you know, 50s, 60s, and 70s.</p>
<p>What Mendelian randomization allows is to say,</p>
<p>okay, we have these people who naturally secrete more or less,</p>
<p>so we can stratify those and look at what is their risk.</p>
<p>So, if you look at people who are low secretors of HDL</p>
<p>versus high secretors of HDL</p>
<p>with holding some of the other key variables consistent, like LDL,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see an effect on heart disease, really.</p>
<p>Of LDL?</p>
<p>Of HDL.</p>
<p>Got it. Okay.</p>
<p>But when you look at LDL</p>
<p>and you look at the lifetime exposure to LDL,</p>
<p>it is like a linear effect on heart disease.</p>
<p>And we know that it&rsquo;s actually not so much LDL,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more apolipoprotein B,</p>
<p>but that tends to track with LDL just in general.</p>
<p>And if you look at the mechanism,</p>
<p>I mean, we know that LDL can penetrate the endothelium,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s the mechanism is present.</p>
<p>If we look at the epidemiology,</p>
<p>it supports that it&rsquo;s an independent risk factor.</p>
<p>And then, again, these Mendelian randomization studies</p>
<p>where we can kind of look at people&rsquo;s exposure over a lifetime</p>
<p>and then we see that linear kind of dose-dependent effect,</p>
<p>to me, that was convincing enough</p>
<p>to change my mind on that particular topic.</p>
<p>And then if you look at, like, some of the Framingham data,</p>
<p>look at high, if you, like, stratify,</p>
<p>like high HDL versus low HDL,</p>
<p>both groups looking at high LDL and low LDL.</p>
<p>So if you have high HDL, low LDL,</p>
<p>you will still be lower risk factor</p>
<p>than somebody who has high HDL and high LDL, right?</p>
<p>So the ratio does matter.</p>
<p>So the ratio does matter.</p>
<p>Same thing with inflammation.</p>
<p>If you look at people who are low inflammation, low LDL,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have a lower risk</p>
<p>than people who are low inflammation, high LDL.</p>
<p>So, again, that was kind of sufficient for me to change my mind.</p>
<p>But it took, it was like not just one study came out.</p>
<p>It was, okay, then there was another study</p>
<p>and then another study and then another study.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, I go, okay, well,</p>
<p>now I either have to change my mind</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m basically just going to be cognitively dissonant</p>
<p>and say, nope, I don&rsquo;t believe all that, you know.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s one of the things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>People will say, oh, you&rsquo;re saying this is a bad study.</p>
<p>Very rarely will I call something a bad study</p>
<p>because data is just data.</p>
<p>But the issue becomes how it is presented</p>
<p>and how broadly it&rsquo;s applied in the mainstream media</p>
<p>or by people on fitness influencers.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ll do is try to step in and say,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s consider X, Y, and Z as well.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s not a bad study,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just be careful about how broadly</p>
<p>we imply the interpretation.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and I think you are in a very unique</p>
<p>and important position to be able to place things</p>
<p>into their proper context because of this,</p>
<p>for lack of a better word, holistic view</p>
<p>of how the psychology, placebo effects,</p>
<p>also core physiology relate to one another and so on.</p>
<p>In fact, I think that your training as a biochemist</p>
<p>and then training in nutrition with somebody who,</p>
<p>Don Lehman, who was pushing you to focus on outcomes,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a beautiful capture of the continuum</p>
<p>at which one can look at something.</p>
<p>Because for those of you who don&rsquo;t know out there,</p>
<p>you know a lot of laboratory studies on mice and humans,</p>
<p>for instance, in the realm of biochemistry</p>
<p>or in vitro studies, you&rsquo;ll see a change</p>
<p>in some molecule can be quite traumatic.</p>
<p>And then the assumption is, oh, you just take the drug</p>
<p>that will change that molecule in a particular direction</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll get the effect you want</p>
<p>at the whole organism level.</p>
<p>The person will lose weight.</p>
<p>The person will gain muscle.</p>
<p>The animal will not have Alzheimer&rsquo;s, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it just doesn&rsquo;t work that way</p>
<p>because of the redundancy and this interplay.</p>
<p>Well, a great example of that is,</p>
<p>so my research was actually in rodents,</p>
<p>all my studies on protein metabolism,</p>
<p>and leucine in particular is what we were studying.</p>
<p>Well, we know if you give leucine,</p>
<p>it increases muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>But we also know if you supplement with leucine,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t get more muscular.</p>
<p>I was about to say,</p>
<p>all you have to do is supplement with leucine?</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>And so how is that possible?</p>
<p>Muscle building is not just protein synthesis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the balance between synthesis and degradation.</p>
<p>And degradation just happens to be</p>
<p>very, very difficult to measure.</p>
<p>But a great example, and again,</p>
<p>one of the cool things about my PhD</p>
<p>was it actually changed the way I ate,</p>
<p>which I think is interesting.</p>
<p>So before, I had been like,</p>
<p>I eat eight meals a day, eat every two hours.</p>
<p>Eight meals a day?</p>
<p>Yeah, when I got to grad school.</p>
<p>In order to get that 30 grams of protein per meal.</p>
<p>Get that amino drip going in was the idea, right?</p>
<p>Like just have an IV hooked up with amino acids.</p>
<p>Not really, folks.</p>
<p>Not really, yeah.</p>
<p>But that was kind of the concept.</p>
<p>But the first study I did,</p>
<p>we basically looked at, okay,</p>
<p>a lot of people had measured the amplitude</p>
<p>of protein synthesis in response to a meal.</p>
<p>We wanted to see how long does this last</p>
<p>and where does it peak, right?</p>
<p>And so my thought was, okay,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;ll probably track with plasma leucine.</p>
<p>You give, for those that are not familiar,</p>
<p>leucine is the amino acid that is</p>
<p>almost exclusively responsible</p>
<p>for increasing muscle protein synthesis</p>
<p>when you eat protein.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of the branched amino acids.</p>
<p>So we wanted to see, okay,</p>
<p>how long does this effect last?</p>
<p>So we fed these animals whey protein.</p>
<p>And again, I thought, okay,</p>
<p>well, however long plasma leucine stays up,</p>
<p>that will be how long protein synthesis stays up.</p>
<p>And so we got the protein synthesis data back</p>
<p>and it was peaked at 90 minutes,</p>
<p>or sorry, peaked from 45 to 90 minutes</p>
<p>and then was back down to baseline by 180 minutes.</p>
<p>And so when I went to do the plasma leucine analysis,</p>
<p>my shock was at three hours,</p>
<p>plasma leucine was still plateaued out.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, well,</p>
<p>when I look at the initiation factors,</p>
<p>that will show me something.</p>
<p>So for those not familiar,</p>
<p>this is part of the mTOR signaling pathway.</p>
<p>So one of the, two of the targets of mTOR,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s stimulated, leucine stimulates mTOR,</p>
<p>two of the targets of mTOR are a protein compound</p>
<p>called 4-EBP1.</p>
<p>And then another one is called ribosomal protein S6K.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to get into the specifics about it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of beyond the scope,</p>
<p>but basically when these things are phosphorylated by mTOR,</p>
<p>it increases the rate of translation initiation,</p>
<p>which translation initiation is basically</p>
<p>the process of the ribosome hooking onto the mRNA</p>
<p>and then starting protein synthesis.</p>
<p>So I was looking at the phosphorylation of 4-EBP1</p>
<p>and RPS6.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably see these things come down at three hours,</p>
<p>still plateaued.</p>
<p>And so then it was like, what is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>So I kept,</p>
<p>I actually kept rerunning the data and rerunning the data</p>
<p>and rerunning the data.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll never forget, I went into the layman&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and this is like, you know,</p>
<p>six months after we&rsquo;ve done this study</p>
<p>because this analysis takes time.</p>
<p>I was like, so where are we with this duration study?</p>
<p>I said, well, I just got to run the plasma data again</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, why is it not right?</p>
<p>And I said, well, it just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And I kind of went through, he&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>like describe to me your technique.</p>
<p>Like, how are you doing this?</p>
<p>And I described it.</p>
<p>And he said, well, what, how&rsquo;s your standard error?</p>
<p>I told him what the numbers were.</p>
<p>He said, it sounds like it&rsquo;s good data.</p>
<p>He said, it sounds like you are trying to get the data</p>
<p>to fit your conclusion</p>
<p>and you need to change your conclusion to fit the data.</p>
<p>And that statement.</p>
<p>This is why we do PhDs.</p>
<p>This is why, yeah.</p>
<p>You need an advisor.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m so skeptical of everything</p>
<p>because I have had so many of my ideas crushed</p>
<p>by my own data, right?</p>
<p>So we actually ended up, this kind of effect,</p>
<p>this phenomenon is called muscle protein</p>
<p>synthetic refractory period.</p>
<p>So basically like once you trigger the system,</p>
<p>kind of runs for a defined period of time</p>
<p>and then it takes time to essentially like reset</p>
<p>for lack of a better term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also been referred to as the muscle full effect.</p>
<p>But so I looked at that and said,</p>
<p>why am I eating every two hours then?</p>
<p>You know, and there was even a study out of Wolf&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>like back in 99, I think,</p>
<p>where they infused essential amino acids for six hours.</p>
<p>Protein synthesis went up, peaked at 60 minutes,</p>
<p>came back down to 120 and never went back up again.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m being naive,</p>
<p>but I would have thought that if protein synthesis goes up</p>
<p>and then comes back down,</p>
<p>that eating more often would be exactly the thing</p>
<p>you would want to do</p>
<p>if your goal was to get increased protein synthesis</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d be pinging the system periodically.</p>
<p>But the problem is the plasma amino acids</p>
<p>are still elevated.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s essentially like eating the whole way through.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>From the perspective of leucine.</p>
<p>From the cells, yeah.</p>
<p>So that was one of those things where I said,</p>
<p>you know what, I&rsquo;m actually going to eat less often</p>
<p>because like if I&rsquo;m eating and three hours later</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still got, you know, capped out plasma amino acids,</p>
<p>you know, and we looked at all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>Like we looked at intracellular leucine</p>
<p>just to make sure that, you know,</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t falling off.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We looked at all the plasma essential amino acids</p>
<p>because we were thinking, well,</p>
<p>maybe protein synthesis is, you know,</p>
<p>sucking some of these amino acids out of the plasma</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re dropping and that&rsquo;s causing it</p>
<p>to kind of short circuit the system.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>It just essentially what the evidence suggests,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re the only ones to show this so far.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not ready to say that this is a real effect</p>
<p>because I hold out the idea that data artifacts do exist</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t be totally sure.</p>
<p>But we saw an increase in AMP kinase</p>
<p>kind of around this mark where protein synthesis</p>
<p>started falling off.</p>
<p>And we also saw a decrease in intracellular ATP.</p>
<p>And protein synthesis is an ATP dependent process.</p>
<p>And so what we think might be happening is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, you know, consuming protein</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re increasing muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>And then at a certain point it has enough effect</p>
<p>on your, you know, energy metabolism in your cells</p>
<p>that it kind of short, not short circuits it,</p>
<p>but it kind of cuts it off, right?</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re the only ones to show that,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>And that was, again, in rats.</p>
<p>I always talk about data.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s data I&rsquo;m willing to bet my toe on,</p>
<p>my foot on, my leg on, and my life on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably barely bet the end of my little toe on that one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure, but it&rsquo;s interesting nonetheless.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great example of, okay,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at this mechanism of mTOR signaling.</p>
<p>And if we just looked at that, we&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>oh, well, protein synthesis is going to stay elevated</p>
<p>for, you know, past three hours.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what we saw.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think it&rsquo;s, again,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I really try to get people to say, well,</p>
<p>mechanisms are important.</p>
<p>And especially if you&rsquo;re seeing an outcome,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to identify mechanisms that may explain that.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s step back from the mechanisms,</p>
<p>from trying to chase mechanisms,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s look at like chasing outcomes</p>
<p>in terms of what we recommend to people.</p>
<p>Excellent point.</p>
<p>In terms of chasing outcomes,</p>
<p>a number of people I know are interested in weight loss</p>
<p>or weight maintenance.</p>
<p>And several times throughout today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve come back to this issue of satiety signals,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re brain-based, body-based, or both.</p>
<p>You know, not wanting to eat more</p>
<p>is a great way to maintain or lose weight</p>
<p>because you simply don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>I heard you mention earlier that protein</p>
<p>and maybe specific types of protein or sources of protein</p>
<p>may provide better satiety signals</p>
<p>than other macronutrients.</p>
<p>Could you briefly talk about how macronutrients,</p>
<p>including protein, but also carbohydrates and fats,</p>
<p>impact satiety?</p>
<p>And from the standpoint of somebody who, for instance,</p>
<p>would like to, quote-unquote, lose a few pounds, right,</p>
<p>probably would be happy to gain a little bit of lean body mass,</p>
<p>provided it was in a particular location on their body.</p>
<p>That seems to be a thing now,</p>
<p>directed hypertrophy, if you will.</p>
<p>And how much they should focus on protein</p>
<p>as a core component of creating this diet, you know,</p>
<p>assuming everything else is being done correctly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to hit the right number of calories</p>
<p>relative to their output, meat, etc.</p>
<p>How should we think about protein and satiety signals?</p>
<p>And are animal sources of protein indeed more bioavailable?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tricky word.</p>
<p>For sake of muscle building,</p>
<p>but also for sake of somebody who just would like to lose body fat.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to lose muscle,</p>
<p>they want to bring their weight down a few pounds.</p>
<p>Or more.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of things to unpack there.</p>
<p>Of the macronutrients,</p>
<p>protein is definitely the biggest lever that you can pull.</p>
<p>Because even if, you know,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t take a ton of protein to get a lot of the muscle building benefits.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the benefits really start to plateau out</p>
<p>around 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evidence that maybe even up to like 2.4 or 2.8 grams per kilo</p>
<p>may give like a little bit more benefit.</p>
<p>I think it probably looks something like an asymptote in terms of a curve</p>
<p>where as you put more into the system,</p>
<p>you always get a little bit more,</p>
<p>but it just gets to the point where it&rsquo;s so infinitesimally small benefit</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s for all intents and purposes, no benefit.</p>
<p>But you mentioned 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.</p>
<p>Would you consider that a threshold that most people should try and achieve daily?</p>
<p>I see very few downsides to hitting that.</p>
<p>I mean, I know some people,</p>
<p>and this is going to get into a separate conversation,</p>
<p>but I know some people will say,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t want to stimulate mTOR because that&rsquo;s going to make me die early.</p>
<p>I think one of the things to keep in mind is if you look at ‚Äì</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of this thought process out there that if you&rsquo;re stimulating mTOR,</p>
<p>the protein is going to make you die early.</p>
<p>First off, we have very little human outcome data to support that claim.</p>
<p>The second thing is if you look at any macronutrient isolation,</p>
<p>I can make a mechanistic argument that it&rsquo;s going to kill you.</p>
<p>So fat, if you take in fat, it decreases flow-mediated dilation.</p>
<p>Flow-mediated dilation is important for heart health in the short term.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates stimulate insulin.</p>
<p>Insulin, pro-inflammatory and all these other things.</p>
<p>And so I can make an argument for any single macronutrient to be negative for longevity.</p>
<p>I really want people ‚Äì this is something that even scientists get wrong.</p>
<p>They look at an acute response of something and assume that that is going to relate to long-term outcomes and signaling.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just take exercise, for example.</p>
<p>If I ‚Äì if you didn&rsquo;t know anything about exercise and I said to you,</p>
<p>Andrew, I&rsquo;m going to do something that&rsquo;s going to make you ‚Äì your heart rate go up,</p>
<p>your blood pressure go up, your inflammatory markers go up,</p>
<p>your reactive oxygen species increase.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to say ‚Äì and it&rsquo;s going to damage your muscles.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to say, I&rsquo;m not doing that.</p>
<p>That sounds horrible.</p>
<p>But it does all those things in the short term.</p>
<p>But what is the long-term effect of exercise?</p>
<p>You actually get healthier.</p>
<p>All those things improve.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that protein is a longevity hack or anything like that.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is I think some of the arguments out there based on mechanistic ‚Äì</p>
<p>this increases mTOR, therefore we don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p>
<p>I think it is a much more complicated argument than just that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>So protein is the biggest lever.</p>
<p>I would shoot for 1.6 grams per kilogram.</p>
<p>If you can do more, great.</p>
<p>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be really downsides to it.</p>
<p>Even like up to very high levels of protein.</p>
<p>Jose Antonio did a study that was a year-long randomized control trial.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s just one year.</p>
<p>But they were looking at all sorts of different biomarkers.</p>
<p>Basically, even up to like four grams per kilogram of protein,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t really find any negative health outcomes from it.</p>
<p>Other than people were just so satiated, they ended up eating less calories.</p>
<p>So protein is a big lever because, one, it has a higher thermic effect to food.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re getting a little bit more calorie burn per day even though it&rsquo;s not a ton</p>
<p>because TEF is a pretty small percentage of your overall energy expenditure.</p>
<p>But still a benefit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting the effects on lean body mass.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a diet, it&rsquo;s going to help preserve lean body mass.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at maintenance, it&rsquo;s going to help build or preserve lean body mass.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re in a surplus, it&rsquo;s going to help build or preserve lean body mass.</p>
<p>Then you get the effects on appetite.</p>
<p>So now I want to be careful because appetite effects</p>
<p>tend to be very specific to individual foods.</p>
<p>So you can take a high-protein food and make it not very satiating.</p>
<p>So take, for example, like a really tasty protein bar,</p>
<p>which back when we were getting into this, no such thing existed.</p>
<p>Now you have protein bars that actually taste pretty darn good.</p>
<p>But if you eat one of them, I mean, are you really satiated?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really feel satiated after a protein bar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my pre-meal snack.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So why?</p>
<p>Because, I mean, it&rsquo;s processed, refined, and made to be very palatable.</p>
<p>Take something like a 200-gram chicken breast.</p>
<p>Very satiating, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why when people say, well, carbohydrates aren&rsquo;t very satiating.</p>
<p>It depends on the carbohydrate.</p>
<p>I mean, when you look at the satiety index,</p>
<p>a plain baked potato is about as satiating as it gets.</p>
<p>If I eat a bowl of oatmeal, I feel pretty good afterward for a while.</p>
<p>I mean, usually I&rsquo;ll eat that along with some other things.</p>
<p>But I completely agree.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that the form that it comes in,</p>
<p>maybe even how much chewing is required, how good it smells,</p>
<p>that your psychological associations.</p>
<p>Because to me, a steak is an incredible meal.</p>
<p>I mean, if I had to pick one food that I could eat,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m not pure carnivore, for the rest of my life,</p>
<p>it would be that because I think it would get me where I need to go,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;d probably have to sneak some fiber.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an excellent point.</p>
<p>I have a question that I don&rsquo;t want to take us off track,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m hoping it relates enough that you could answer it now.</p>
<p>In the context of this, if I&rsquo;m going to eat, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>two grams per kilogram of body weight protein,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not eating multiple meals,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m eating two or three meals per day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly going to be eating more than the 30-gram threshold</p>
<p>that was thrown around for a long time,</p>
<p>that we can only assimilate 30 grams of protein per meal.</p>
<p>Should I just not worry about that?</p>
<p>Some of it is going to go towards the thermic effect of food.</p>
<p>Some of that might be converted into glucose, of all things,</p>
<p>into a neogenesis.</p>
<p>So should I worry about this 30-gram cutoff?</p>
<p>Because I think balancing the 1.6 gram per kilogram body weight threshold</p>
<p>with number of meals, with the need to exercise and work and live my life</p>
<p>and sleep, et cetera, pretty soon you run into bottlenecks</p>
<p>where you just can&rsquo;t do it all,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re spending so much time trying to focus on it all.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t optimize all the things at the same time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d lose your mind and your body.</p>
<p>So what is necessary in terms of frequency</p>
<p>if one is getting enough protein?</p>
<p>And then tied into that question,</p>
<p>is there any reality to this idea that if you eat one meal per day</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re fasting and then you eat, let&rsquo;s say, 200 grams of protein</p>
<p>in a single feeding,</p>
<p>that you can assimilate more because you were protein-starved?</p>
<p>Is that a real thing?</p>
<p>So most of the studies with protein are after a fast.</p>
<p>Because to assess it with stable isotope, you have to be in a steady state.</p>
<p>So we haven&rsquo;t observed that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appear that fasting really kind of allows you</p>
<p>to assimilate more protein after a fast.</p>
<p>So this gets into a core of one of the things I looked at in my PhD,</p>
<p>which is does protein distribution matter?</p>
<p>Because most Americans get about 65% to 70% of their protein at dinner.</p>
<p>Breakfast tends to be pretty minimal protein foods.</p>
<p>Do any cultures actually eat a big breakfast and not a big lunch and dinner?</p>
<p>We all heard that that was ideal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into circadian timing in a little bit.</p>
<p>But does anyone actually do that?</p>
<p>Steak and eggs for breakfast and then taper off the rest of the day?</p>
<p>I know German culture tends to have a big breakfast,</p>
<p>but it also tends to be like sugary foods and whatnot.</p>
<p>As far as teleologically, I&rsquo;m actually not sure about that.</p>
<p>So if you look at that,</p>
<p>and then you consider that protein doesn&rsquo;t really have a storage mechanism.</p>
<p>People will say, well, lean tissue is a storage mechanism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like saying a house is a storage facility for wood.</p>
<p>Yeah, if the house is made out of wood, you could get wood out of it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not why you build the house.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re building the house out of a demand.</p>
<p>Same thing for muscle tissue.</p>
<p>There is a free pool of amino acids, but it&rsquo;s very, very small.</p>
<p>So when you consider things like fat, which basically has unlimited storage capacity,</p>
<p>carbohydrate, a relatively large storage capacity,</p>
<p>you can store 400 or 500 grams of carbohydrate between your liver and muscles,</p>
<p>and then protein, which almost has no storage capacity.</p>
<p>The idea that, okay, you could make up for a low protein at one meal</p>
<p>by overconsuming another meal didn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>So one of the studies we did, and again, in rats,</p>
<p>we took both groups were getting whey protein,</p>
<p>so high-quality protein.</p>
<p>They were getting the exact same amount of calories,</p>
<p>exact same amount of nitrogen, exact same macros.</p>
<p>Everything was the same.</p>
<p>The only difference was one group basically got kind of three meals</p>
<p>of similar amounts of protein, like dinner was a little bit bigger</p>
<p>because we wanted to keep it somewhat similar to how people eat,</p>
<p>but each meal was going to be over the threshold to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Whereas the other group, I constructed it so the first two meals of the day</p>
<p>should not stimulate muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>It should be under that threshold.</p>
<p>And then the last meal was about 70% of their total daily protein.</p>
<p>And so we had them eat those for 11 weeks, and I&rsquo;ll never forget this.</p>
<p>This is how, like, obsessive I became about it,</p>
<p>is there was 110 animals in this study, and I made all the diets,</p>
<p>and I weighed out exactly every single meal for every single animal for 11 weeks.</p>
<p>So I was in there at 6 a.m., I was in there at noon,</p>
<p>and I was in there at 6 p.m., you know?</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of Ph.D. student that professors dream of.</p>
<p>You guys have been a dream student.</p>
<p>So at the end of 11 weeks, we looked at, like, lean body mass,</p>
<p>we looked at body fat, we looked at hind limb weights.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really see differences in lean body mass,</p>
<p>but what we did see was a difference in hind limb weights.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t massive, but there was a significant difference</p>
<p>in the size of the muscles of the hind limbs of these animals.</p>
<p>And so it was interesting that there wasn&rsquo;t a difference in lean body mass,</p>
<p>and what we found, at least with the liver,</p>
<p>the animals that were eating, like, one meal with really high protein</p>
<p>actually had bigger livers, not, like, a huge amount</p>
<p>and not something that I would consider unsafe,</p>
<p>but it was a statistically significant difference.</p>
<p>And so to me, at least, like, if I&rsquo;m trying to explain, like,</p>
<p>no difference in lean body mass but a difference in these hind limb weights,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s some, like, sequestering of, you know,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s fueling a little bit more protein synthesis of the splint neck tissues</p>
<p>rather than, you know, because you&rsquo;re capping out skeletal muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>And we do know that the splint neck tissues are more sensitive</p>
<p>or have a greater rate of protein synthesis per day.</p>
<p>Like, the rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis in humans is about, like, 1% per day.</p>
<p>So it takes, like, 100 days to turn over, you know, skeletal muscle,</p>
<p>whereas, like, your entire gut, your entire GI will turn itself over in, like,</p>
<p>two to three days, right?</p>
<p>So really, and the liver also has a very high amount of protein synthesis,</p>
<p>which is one of the reasons it&rsquo;s actually one of the most metabolically active organs.</p>
<p>So all that to say, it has not‚Äî</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been one human study that showed something similar,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s been a couple others that didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then in the intermittent fasting studies,</p>
<p>which is maybe a good tool to look at compared to continuous feeding,</p>
<p>one thing I will say is it looks like the 16-8 intermittent fasting style.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a couple studies with Grant Tinsley,</p>
<p>and this is something I&rsquo;ve changed my mind on as well.</p>
<p>Grant Tinsley has done a couple studies where they did use the 16-8 protocol.</p>
<p>They had them train during their feeding window,</p>
<p>and they had them eat, I think it was at least three protein-containing meals during those eight hours.</p>
<p>These are humans?</p>
<p>These are humans.</p>
<p>And they saw no difference in lean body mass at the end of the study</p>
<p>compared to people who were eating, like, you know,</p>
<p>as many times as they wanted throughout the day.</p>
<p>Now, if you look at some of the more extreme forms of fasting,</p>
<p>like alternate-day fasting or, like, 22-2 or 24,</p>
<p>there are some studies where you do start to see differences in lean body mass.</p>
<p>So my suspicion is‚Äîand I&rsquo;m just guessing, so this is tenuous‚Äî</p>
<p>my suspicion is probably if you&rsquo;re getting, like,</p>
<p>two to three, like, high-quality protein meals in a day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting the vast majority of the benefits of protein.</p>
<p>The most important thing is getting enough total.</p>
<p>And then secondarily, trying to get, you know,</p>
<p>at least two or three meals with high-quality protein in.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going, like, pretty extreme with, like, alternate-day fasting</p>
<p>or, you know, maybe only one meal a day,</p>
<p>then I think there may be some effects on lean body mass.</p>
<p>But again, these can be mitigated as well if you&rsquo;re doing, you know, hard resistance training.</p>
<p>Typically, that is the biggest lever in terms of lean body mass.</p>
<p>Yes, you know, protein distribution may make a difference,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m trying to put it in context so people don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>they need to go out and eat, you know, four meals a day.</p>
<p>But again, so what I would say is, like, some of the more milder forms of,</p>
<p>you know, time-restricted eating appear to be fine for lean body mass.</p>
<p>Now, the caveat is the following.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about animal studies is when you consider</p>
<p>if you want to have a high subject number, high level of control,</p>
<p>and a long duration, it&rsquo;s pretty much your only option, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve, in our research review reps, I created a Venn diagram,</p>
<p>which basically is, like, three, you know, circles crossing over.</p>
<p>One is study duration, one is level of control,</p>
<p>and the other one is subject number.</p>
<p>And to get all three of those circles to cross over,</p>
<p>it almost has to be in animals.</p>
<p>And reps, it&rsquo;s a newsletter or a book?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s our monthly research review.</p>
<p>So every month we review, like, five studies that come out</p>
<p>in fitness and nutrition.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;ll usually do at least one nutrition, one training,</p>
<p>and one supplement per month.</p>
<p>We will put a link to where people can sign up.</p>
<p>This is a sign-up format? Great.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a subscription-based service.</p>
<p>So basically, when people might look at, like, my study,</p>
<p>well, why did you see a difference in muscle weights,</p>
<p>whereas some of these other studies don&rsquo;t see a difference?</p>
<p>I weighed out every single meal for 11 weeks.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that 11 weeks in a rodent&rsquo;s lifespan</p>
<p>is a really long time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about an eighth of their total lifespan.</p>
<p>So is it that there&rsquo;s no effect,</p>
<p>or is it that the effect is relatively small</p>
<p>and would take a really long time</p>
<p>and very high level of control to see in humans?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I think what I would say, relatively confidently,</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re going to do, like, a 16-8 intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably fine.</p>
<p>Especially, and again, what is the goal, right?</p>
<p>Like, if you&rsquo;re a bodybuilder looking to be</p>
<p>the most massive person you possibly can,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re a football player,</p>
<p>in some field that having as much lean body mass as possible</p>
<p>is really important for you,</p>
<p>then I would say, well, you&rsquo;re not really gaining a whole lot</p>
<p>by doing some form of time-restricted eating.</p>
<p>I think most of the people listening to this</p>
<p>do not fall into that category.</p>
<p>I think most people want to maintain or lose weight.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d like to perhaps add a bit of, quote-unquote,</p>
<p>shape or muscle to specific areas of their body</p>
<p>and lose body fat.</p>
<p>And I think your normal forms of time-restricted eating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably perfectly fine for that, right?</p>
<p>And again, I don&rsquo;t want somebody to think,</p>
<p>well, I do alternate-day fasting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point to me resistance training</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m going to lose muscle mass.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You can still build muscle doing that.</p>
<p>You just might not build as much muscle as you would</p>
<p>if you were eating in a more traditional format.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s something that works for you and your goals,</p>
<p>and especially if it&rsquo;s fat loss or controlling your calories,</p>
<p>then again, it&rsquo;s about the hierarchy of what&rsquo;s important, right?</p>
<p>So, to answer your question,</p>
<p>I do think that timing and frequency matters a little.</p>
<p>Not so much frequency, but distribution more so.</p>
<p>So I think the distribution matters,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a much smaller lever</p>
<p>than just getting enough total protein in.</p>
<p>And then as far as animal versus plant,</p>
<p>I used to be in the camp of</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way somebody can build as much muscle</p>
<p>on a plant-based diet.</p>
<p>And now I think I&rsquo;ve come back to,</p>
<p>you can, it just requires a little bit more planning.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to say always,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very difficult to do</p>
<p>without an isolated source of protein.</p>
<p>So unless you&rsquo;re going to supplement</p>
<p>with an isolated plant source of protein,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to get enough</p>
<p>without going over on total calories</p>
<p>because you can figure that,</p>
<p>especially like take somebody who may be calorically restricted,</p>
<p>trying to get enough protein from whole intact plant sources.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a few different things working against you.</p>
<p>One, the sources of protein you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>also have carbohydrate and or fat.</p>
<p>Two, it&rsquo;s a less bioavailable form of protein.</p>
<p>And three, it&rsquo;s a lower quality of protein</p>
<p>in terms of it has typically less leucine,</p>
<p>less branched amino acids,</p>
<p>and less essential amino acids.</p>
<p>You answered the question</p>
<p>that I almost interrupted you to ask,</p>
<p>which was, does it boil down to the leucine content?</p>
<p>And it sounds like that is one of the components</p>
<p>and that a lot of the vegan and vegetarian sources</p>
<p>of excellent protein,</p>
<p>that excellent protein vegetarian or vegan source</p>
<p>is co-packaged with calories from carbohydrates and or fat</p>
<p>that make it hard to stay under the caloric threshold.</p>
<p>Whereas a steak is,</p>
<p>and obviously people might want to avoid that</p>
<p>for ethical reasons,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a different matter entirely.</p>
<p>But a steak or a piece of chicken or an egg is,</p>
<p>well an egg has a yolk, which is there&rsquo;s fat there,</p>
<p>but is almost a pure protein fat source.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no carbohydrate along for the ride.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I think what I would say is,</p>
<p>you can do it,</p>
<p>but it takes a little more planning.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re almost always,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a vegan,</p>
<p>especially you&rsquo;re going to be better off</p>
<p>like something with some isolated form of protein</p>
<p>or vegan form of protein.</p>
<p>Now this is where it gets into people say,</p>
<p>well what about the limiting amino acids</p>
<p>and those sorts of things?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a consideration.</p>
<p>Some of the better forms of vegan protein</p>
<p>in terms of amino acid content are like soy.</p>
<p>Now I can hear everybody screaming online</p>
<p>about their testosterone levels.</p>
<p>In terms of actual outcomes and looking at testosterone,</p>
<p>there was a recent meta-analysis looking at soy.</p>
<p>And I think if it&rsquo;s your only source of protein,</p>
<p>then maybe the dosage is high enough</p>
<p>to cause some weird effects.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re just using it like once or twice a day,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have an effect on testosterone or estrogen.</p>
<p>So that can be a decent source of protein</p>
<p>because it is a complete protein source.</p>
<p>It does have a PD cause of one,</p>
<p>which PD cause is basically a measure of protein quality</p>
<p>based on does it provide enough of all the amino acids</p>
<p>so that none are limiting.</p>
<p>And so soy is one of the only vegan sources that does that.</p>
<p>Interestingly, potato protein isolate</p>
<p>actually has a similar essential amino acid content to whey.</p>
<p>So isolated potato protein.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really hard to find.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to source it.</p>
<p>Vegetarians take note because,</p>
<p>or vegans rather because whey is vegetarian.</p>
<p>And whey is a very high-quality protein source.</p>
<p>Very high-quality protein source.</p>
<p>And actually, they&rsquo;re actually creating whey now out of,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I may mischaracterize this,</p>
<p>but I believe they&rsquo;re able to produce it now</p>
<p>out of yeast or something like that.</p>
<p>So for vegans, now this is a great option</p>
<p>because you can have whey that&rsquo;s not animal-based</p>
<p>that is going to be every bit as good as an animal-based whey.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Getting to the leucine, let me go back, sorry.</p>
<p>So another reason that using an isolated protein can be helpful</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s more bioavailable as well</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s been isolated out.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s the protein bound up in the actual plant material,</p>
<p>it tends to be less bioavailable.</p>
<p>Now cooking can help increase the bioavailability</p>
<p>because it breaks some of those bonds and whatnot.</p>
<p>But it still seems to be lower.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>There was a recent study where they did a corn, wheat,</p>
<p>and pea blend of protein versus whey.</p>
<p>And basically the outcome was 30 grams of each</p>
<p>stimulated protein synthesis to a similar degree.</p>
<p>But the plasma amino acids in the plant-based protein</p>
<p>still did not get as high as with whey.</p>
<p>Now it may be that that&rsquo;s just, it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>because once you get to a certain level,</p>
<p>you get all the benefits.</p>
<p>But I still found it interesting nonetheless</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t quite get as high.</p>
<p>The other thing to consider with the vegan sources of protein</p>
<p>is the leucine content.</p>
<p>So one of the studies we did was we looked at wheat, soy, egg, and whey.</p>
<p>Isonitrogenous, meaning we equated protein between the groups.</p>
<p>Isocaloric, we equated calories.</p>
<p>And we looked at muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>And I think this was the meals were 15% of total energy from protein.</p>
<p>So like your food guide pyramid level of protein.</p>
<p>And we saw that in the wheat and soy group,</p>
<p>they did not increase muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>But the egg and whey group increased muscle protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Now what&rsquo;s really interesting is we went back</p>
<p>and we took wheat and added free leucine to it</p>
<p>to match the leucine content of whey.</p>
<p>And the protein synthetic response was identical.</p>
<p>So again, I don&rsquo;t like to simplify things too much,</p>
<p>but leucine appears to really be driving this ship.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll never forget, Lehman called me into his office one day.</p>
<p>And he would always do these thought experiments.</p>
<p>He liked to think about why something occurs the way it does.</p>
<p>Dangerous territory.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he would say, one day, I&rsquo;ll never forget.</p>
<p>He said, Lane, why do you think the body evolved</p>
<p>to just sense leucine for muscle protein synthesis?</p>
<p>And of course, I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know, man.</p>
<p>I just work here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to get my PhD.</p>
<p>And he said, well, think about it.</p>
<p>You would want something that really wasn&rsquo;t extensively metabolized</p>
<p>by the gut and liver because you would want it to show up in the blood</p>
<p>in values that reflect what you just ate.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>And you would want it to have passive diffusion across the muscle cell</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d want to be concentration dependent, which it is.</p>
<p>Get into the tissues and cells that need it most.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So not having active transport, but rather passive transport.</p>
<p>So yeah, I thought that that was really interesting,</p>
<p>the way he broke that down.</p>
<p>So a few different options for the vegan folks out there.</p>
<p>You can use an isolated source of protein.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s going to be good options coming</p>
<p>because this plant-based way is going to be a great option for folks.</p>
<p>You can add free leucine to it, to whatever your source of protein is.</p>
<p>Just buy supplemented leucine powder.</p>
<p>Just buy leucine.</p>
<p>Now, it tastes horrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ve heard that.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ve even tried it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely nonpolar.</p>
<p>It does not dissolve in anything.</p>
<p>Can it be put into capsules?</p>
<p>It is gross.</p>
<p>It can be put into capsules, yeah.</p>
<p>So you could take a capsule.</p>
<p>Like, for example, if you&rsquo;re eating your normal meal,</p>
<p>you could just take a capsule of like one gram of leucine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably going to bump you up enough that you&rsquo;re going to be good to go.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s options like blends, especially with corn.</p>
<p>Corn is actually very high in leucine as a percentage of its protein.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;ve got to remember, like, you go eat corn on a cob</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting like two grams of total protein,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not that much leucine.</p>
<p>But if you isolate out the protein, put it into a powder,</p>
<p>well, now, you know, when you&rsquo;re getting like 80%, 90% of the weight is now protein,</p>
<p>corn is actually about 12% leucine in terms of the protein.</p>
<p>So a great source of leucine.</p>
<p>It is like almost frank deficient in some other amino acids,</p>
<p>but you can blend it with a few other sources of protein.</p>
<p>Like you could blend it with a soy, a pea,</p>
<p>and you can create these complementary blends</p>
<p>that would actually have quite a bit of leucine</p>
<p>but also some of the other essential amino acids.</p>
<p>So there are options out there for plant-based folks.</p>
<p>And, I mean, we have seen people who are plant-based, you know,</p>
<p>build impressive amounts of muscle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a few bodybuilders that are plant-based.</p>
<p>And a lot of the endurance athletes like it.</p>
<p>And even though when we talk about muscle,</p>
<p>we think about muscle building often, performance in endurance sports,</p>
<p>and also just performance for the typical person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing some cardiovascular training,</p>
<p>hopefully some resistance training also, and just living life.</p>
<p>I mean, many more people now, it seems, are vegan</p>
<p>or at least avoiding meat, in particular red meat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one of those people.</p>
<p>I limit the amount and I certainly focus on the quality of what I eat,</p>
<p>but I do eat red meat.</p>
<p>Which brings me to a question about, you know,</p>
<p>just generally in terms of food choice.</p>
<p>Can we come up with a relatively short summary of the following?</p>
<p>Tell me if this is correct or not.</p>
<p>I think that most of us should be focused on, for sake of health,</p>
<p>healthspan and lifespan,</p>
<p>should be focused on ingesting minimally non-processed</p>
<p>and minimally processed foods.</p>
<p>You know, maybe even cooking our own food.</p>
<p>You know, I realize that&rsquo;s heresy now, but ideally we would do some of that.</p>
<p>And really trying to avoid foods that are highly processed</p>
<p>and have lots of sugar.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m using this as a segue to get into a question</p>
<p>that I really want your answer to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been dying to ask you this,</p>
<p>which is if sugar intake is not actually going up</p>
<p>as much as people think it is,</p>
<p>why are people getting so much fatter?</p>
<p>So what do you think about just a general statement</p>
<p>that we should try and eat foods that are low to no,</p>
<p>minimally to not processed for about 80% of our foods?</p>
<p>Is that a reasonable number?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to actually get, you know, completely unprocessed food</p>
<p>because almost everything goes through some form of processing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thinking like anything that wouldn&rsquo;t survive long on,</p>
<p>without refrigeration, yeah, on a shelf,</p>
<p>like an apple or a banana or something.</p>
<p>Oatmeal, like ground oats to me,</p>
<p>as long as there isn&rsquo;t a bunch of other stuff in there,</p>
<p>would be minimally processed.</p>
<p>A steak is not really processed,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s cut off the animal, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a few steps in there.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s sort of, that&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>And I think everybody kind of gets the gist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably a little bit pedantic when it comes to this stuff.</p>
<p>No, this is good.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the things I appreciate about you</p>
<p>is something that I get teased a lot by people close to me,</p>
<p>which is the caveats and the insistence on precision is really important</p>
<p>because especially with online communications these days,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a runaway train.</p>
<p>You know, people will&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too easy to misinterpret what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Very easy to misinterpret.</p>
<p>And the misinterpretations are often used to leverage whole new ideas</p>
<p>about what is and isn&rsquo;t true, mostly about what is true.</p>
<p>So I really appreciate the nuance.</p>
<p>And this is what a long-form podcast really allows us to do</p>
<p>is catch every curve.</p>
<p>So I would 100% agree with what you said</p>
<p>that if you were going to make a broad stroke</p>
<p>that trying to focus on minimally processed foods is very important.</p>
<p>The one caveat I would say is I think it&rsquo;s important to understand why</p>
<p>because otherwise people can make this weird association</p>
<p>that like if I eat any processed food, it&rsquo;s going to kill me</p>
<p>or like every time I eat it, it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m smoking a cigarette</p>
<p>and my health, you know, my longevity is declining.</p>
<p>Based on the studies we have, it&rsquo;s mostly about the energy</p>
<p>that processed food just gets people to spontaneously eat more.</p>
<p>And Kevin Hull showed this in his study that was very&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, he designed some of the most elegant studies in nutrition.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And they basically took people from a minimally processed food diet</p>
<p>and then gave them access to ultra-processed foods,</p>
<p>very few instructions, just eat till you feel satisfied</p>
<p>and they spontaneously increased their calorie intake by 500 calories a day.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s massive.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s&hellip; and we haven&rsquo;t quite figured it out.</p>
<p>You know, people said, well, it&rsquo;s sugar.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appear to be sugar in terms of just an isolation.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s fats.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appear to be fats in isolation.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the combination of sugar and fat.</p>
<p>Partly, well, it&rsquo;s the combination of sugar, fat, and salt.</p>
<p>Partly, but there&rsquo;s some kind of like overall magic to the texture</p>
<p>and the mouthfeel and just the overall palatability of stuff,</p>
<p>which is always why I say there&rsquo;s like right and wrong ways</p>
<p>to do these different diets.</p>
<p>Like for example, there&rsquo;s a right way to do plant-based</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s, you know, like what&rsquo;s in some of these documentaries</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re eating like plant-based mac and cheese.</p>
<p>And again, I love a good mac and cheese, but like that should not form&hellip;</p>
<p>like that should not be pitched as a healthy diet</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s plant-based, right?</p>
<p>Because, I mean, you&rsquo;re eating a highly processed food</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very palatable and easy to overeat.</p>
<p>Same thing for keto.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve now got like keto ice creams and you&rsquo;ve got, you know,</p>
<p>keto cookies and all these sorts of things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah.</p>
<p>And if you look at them,</p>
<p>they actually have more calories than the normal stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, this is completely missing the point here.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re actually just taking yourself&hellip;</p>
<p>like the whole point of those diets is the reason you tend to lose weight</p>
<p>is originally like good luck, you know, 10 years ago</p>
<p>doing a keto diet eating processed food, right?</p>
<p>Like you just couldn&rsquo;t do it really.</p>
<p>Now you can.</p>
<p>But the problem is it&rsquo;s not going to work</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to be still consuming too many calories</p>
<p>because even though it&rsquo;s keto, what are they doing?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re trying to make it more palatable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to make it better mouthfeel,</p>
<p>which I guess if you&rsquo;re being keto for the sake of being keto, great.</p>
<p>But if you have hopes of body composition modification,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to really negatively impact.</p>
<p>So yes, I think minimizing the amount of processed food you consume</p>
<p>can be important.</p>
<p>Now that being said, it depends on the individual and their goals.</p>
<p>If your goal is to, for example, build muscle</p>
<p>or maintain a high body weight for a sport, for example,</p>
<p>like an NFL offensive lineman or something of that nature,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re, you know, I worked with an NBA team.</p>
<p>They were kind of, I can&rsquo;t disclose anything,</p>
<p>but they were looking at drafting a certain player.</p>
<p>And, you know, like for them, processed foods may actually be a tool.</p>
<p>Or teenagers.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, we all want young people to eat more healthily, I think,</p>
<p>develop great habits.</p>
<p>But some of them, their caloric needs are so high.</p>
<p>So high.</p>
<p>That if they were eating what I eat,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to dissolve into, you know, they&rsquo;re just waste away.</p>
<p>So I describe this again with a financial example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a budget, right?</p>
<p>So if I make a million dollars a year, for example,</p>
<p>is it okay for me to buy like a hundred thousand dollars sports car?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that loans don&rsquo;t exist, right?</p>
<p>Is it okay for me to buy a hundred thousand dollars sports car</p>
<p>if I still am able to pay my mortgage and pay my utilities</p>
<p>and like take care of my responsibilities,</p>
<p>the things I should do?</p>
<p>Is it okay if I do that?</p>
<p>If it like makes me feel good and it&rsquo;s fun?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fine, right?</p>
<p>Like it fits in your budget.</p>
<p>If I make, you know, 50 grand a year,</p>
<p>should I be going out and buying a sports car?</p>
<p>Probably not because I&rsquo;m not going to be able to pay my mortgage</p>
<p>and all these other responsibilities.</p>
<p>So your protein, your fiber, your micronutrients,</p>
<p>these are your responsibilities.</p>
<p>But those become much easier to hit when you have higher calories.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re, you know, eating 4,000 calories a day</p>
<p>for whatever goal you have,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to have some left over</p>
<p>and like good luck eating 4,000 calories from minimally processed foods.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, you&rsquo;ll be miserable</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to have such gut fill</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to feel like you can&rsquo;t even move.</p>
<p>And so again, now it becomes,</p>
<p>okay, well, is there something inherent to that food processing?</p>
<p>Is there something, you know, that we can pick out that we know,</p>
<p>okay, well, this is going to be a negative effect on health,</p>
<p>even like body composition stuff aside.</p>
<p>And I would say there&rsquo;s not really great evidence of that so far.</p>
<p>And a great example of that is sugar.</p>
<p>I mean, I actually just wrote a really long article on my website</p>
<p>about why I think sugar was not the root cause of the obesity epidemic.</p>
<p>And you kind of mentioned like sugar intake in the last 20 years</p>
<p>has actually gone down a little bit.</p>
<p>Well, if you look on the whole, it might have gone up a little bit,</p>
<p>but certainly in the male sector, it&rsquo;s gone way down.</p>
<p>Drinking used to be, there was a five o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>People were drinking all day.</p>
<p>People were smoking a lot less.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a real puzzle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to know what your hypotheses are.</p>
<p>Smoking can actually be an opposition</p>
<p>because nicotine is actually an appetite suppressant.</p>
<p>Appetite suppressant also increases focus.</p>
<p>The problem is it often arrives in a delivery device that can kill you.</p>
<p>But nicotine itself is a powerful agent.</p>
<p>It also can offset age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Not entirely, but it makes the brain work better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a buddy who doesn&rsquo;t like caffeine,</p>
<p>and he just takes those nicotine pouches</p>
<p>and basically has one in almost all day</p>
<p>because he has a very stressful job and is a high performer.</p>
<p>You have to be careful how you deliver it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a Nobel Prize winning neuroscientist</p>
<p>that will chew five or six pieces of Nicorette an hour,</p>
<p>which I do not recommend.</p>
<p>But when he quit smoking, he just simply couldn&rsquo;t function as well.</p>
<p>He was the one who pointed me to the literature</p>
<p>on offsetting age-related cognitive decline,</p>
<p>even neuron maintenance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty impressive nootropic, to be honest.</p>
<p>The first thing to realize is when we&rsquo;re talking about consumption data,</p>
<p>this is based on actual production, basically.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re assuming that, okay, we&rsquo;re producing this amount of these foods</p>
<p>so we can assume the consumption is going to follow that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a direct measurement.</p>
<p>But it has been validated in a few different studies.</p>
<p>We know that oil consumption has gone up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the big ones.</p>
<p>This kind of forms the crux of the seed oils or the root of-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely a question that I&rsquo;m going to ping you on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to come into your house and kick your dog</p>
<p>and punch your mom and all kinds of stuff,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m happy to address those.</p>
<p>So calories have still gone up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some people who claim that they&rsquo;ve plateaued.</p>
<p>I think the data seems to suggest that calorie intake is still increasing.</p>
<p>And the other thing to keep in mind is even if it&rsquo;s plateaued,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still at a high enough level that obesity is probably going to continue</p>
<p>to increase up to a point where it will probably plateau if calories are plateaued.</p>
<p>What about energy output?</p>
<p>Leaving aside meat, because that sounds highly individual.</p>
<p>I mean, the people we know are focusing on exercise,</p>
<p>but there are a lot of folks out there that don&rsquo;t exercise.</p>
<p>And energy output has gone down over the years.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very obvious when you look at how people work now</p>
<p>compared to even 30, 40 years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much different.</p>
<p>Less walking.</p>
<p>Also, I learned recently that kids in high school</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take PE class in many schools.</p>
<p>We had to suit up and run and suit up,</p>
<p>and if you didn&rsquo;t bring your change of clothes</p>
<p>or you didn&rsquo;t wash them, in which case you&rsquo;d be better off just not wearing them.</p>
<p>Nothing like the smell of a boy&rsquo;s locker room after a weekend.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to still remember it, and it&rsquo;s not pleasant.</p>
<p>But you had to run and do your push-ups with everybody else</p>
<p>or play volleyball in your regular school day clothes.</p>
<p>So my understanding is that physical education</p>
<p>is not part of the basic education any longer.</p>
<p>It probably depends on the state,</p>
<p>but I know many states have done away with it just because of budget cuts.</p>
<p>Caloric intake is going up, maybe plateauing.</p>
<p>Is that sufficient to explain the obesity epidemic?</p>
<p>Based on what I&rsquo;ve seen, I think it&rsquo;s pretty sufficient.</p>
<p>So it might not be that big of a mystery after all.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a big mystery.</p>
<p>I think that people don&rsquo;t like the concept of energy balance,</p>
<p>and I think because they insert judgment into it,</p>
<p>which is, okay, if you&rsquo;re gaining weight over time,</p>
<p>on a fundamental level, it means you are eating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consuming more energy than you&rsquo;re expending.</p>
<p>People insert the judgment, which is, you&rsquo;re lazy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a sloth. You&rsquo;re whatever it is.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there who actually think that.</p>
<p>I actually remember talking to somebody who was like,</p>
<p>well, I would never hire an obese person for a job</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just obvious that they&rsquo;re lazy.</p>
<p>And I just remember going, are you serious?</p>
<p>There are plenty of very, very smart, high-achieving people who are obese.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you just put people in buckets.</p>
<p>People are much more complicated than this.</p>
<p>Yes, there is some personal responsibility,</p>
<p>but then when you look through the data and you take ‚Äì</p>
<p>there was a study done in obese women</p>
<p>where they found that women who were obese were 50% more likely</p>
<p>to have had some form of sexual assault trauma in their past.</p>
<p>We know that people from lower income areas are more prone to be obese.</p>
<p>There are several people who have a higher ACE score, I believe,</p>
<p>which is kind of measures like traumatic childhood events.</p>
<p>I believe there was a study showing they&rsquo;re more likely to be obese.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s ‚Äì yes, it is an energy imbalance problem.</p>
<p>But just saying eat less, move more, that&rsquo;s like telling broke people,</p>
<p>well, just earn more money than you spend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s technically right, but it&rsquo;s very unhelpful, right?</p>
<p>What is more helpful is to describe and implement the habits and behaviors</p>
<p>that will allow them to achieve that, right?</p>
<p>So kind of ‚Äì I realize we kind of got off track a little bit,</p>
<p>but circling back to like sugar, circa 2005,</p>
<p>I believe that sugar was fattening and bad for your health</p>
<p>independent of any other variable.</p>
<p>So independent risk factor.</p>
<p>And again, I want to be very clear about what independent means.</p>
<p>Independent means independent of all of the variables.</p>
<p>This thing is bad for your health and body composition.</p>
<p>So on its own, independent of whether or not, for instance,</p>
<p>it increases hunger and appetite.</p>
<p>Right, or caloric intake, right?</p>
<p>I was at a graduate school mixer, and one of the professors there</p>
<p>was somebody who had done research on high fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>and fructose specifically as well.</p>
<p>And he was talking to another professor,</p>
<p>and he had done this study in rodents where he had fed like ‚Äì</p>
<p>I think it was like 60% or 70% of their calories from fructose.</p>
<p>And they saw some really weird things happen in the liver</p>
<p>with the NOVA lipogenesis and all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>The other professor is saying to him,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that high fructose corn syrup is fattening.</p>
<p>And this professor who had done this research said,</p>
<p>yeah, because it&rsquo;s ‚Äì people overeat.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s something inherent to it?</p>
<p>And he said, no, I think it&rsquo;s just calories.</p>
<p>People are eating too many calories.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, we did a proof of concept looking at could we ‚Äì</p>
<p>like try eating 70% of your daily calories from fructose.</p>
<p>You actually can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Like high fructose corn syrup is only 55% fructose.</p>
<p>So if you ate nothing but high fructose corn syrup,</p>
<p>you would still not get to this level that they fed in this study.</p>
<p>So that got me kind of like questioning my beliefs about it.</p>
<p>So then I went through and I said, okay, like let&rsquo;s take out the epidemiology.</p>
<p>Not that epidemiology is useless,</p>
<p>but people who eat more sugar are also likely to eat more calories.</p>
<p>So then I looked for the randomized control trials</p>
<p>where they match calories and vary the amount of sugar.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t seem to make a difference,</p>
<p>at least from fat loss or fat gain.</p>
<p>But what about health?</p>
<p>So for instance, if somebody ‚Äì and I know somebody like this who loves sweets,</p>
<p>is thin, gets some exercise, not a ton.</p>
<p>But my concern is that a significant fraction of their calories</p>
<p>are coming from these sugary foods</p>
<p>and therefore they&rsquo;re not getting enough fiber, maybe protein, et cetera.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at epidemiology for a second.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll address this more directly.</p>
<p>When we look at epidemiology,</p>
<p>people who eat higher amounts of sugar tend to be more obese.</p>
<p>They tend to have worse biomarkers of health.</p>
<p>But people who eat fruit, a lot of fruit sugar,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have those same associations.</p>
<p>So why is that?</p>
<p>Well, because fruit has fiber with it, right?</p>
<p>So I started to kind of believe, based on the data I was looking at,</p>
<p>that high sugar intake was not the problem per se.</p>
<p>The problem was that high sugary foods typically are very low in fiber.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re getting enough fiber, is sugar a problem?</p>
<p>So there was a classic study by Surwit in 1997.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s still the best study to this day looking at this.</p>
<p>I know those people say, well, it was done in 1997.</p>
<p>It has no relevance.</p>
<p>You know, I know.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a good study, it&rsquo;s a good study.</p>
<p>Some studies are timeless.</p>
<p>In fact, they have greater relevance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go back and undo the discovery of DNA</p>
<p>because it was 60 years ago or whatever it is.</p>
<p>So they looked at an 1100 calorie diet, so low calorie diet.</p>
<p>One group was eating over 110 grams of sugar a day, like sucrose.</p>
<p>The other group was eating about 10 grams of sugar per day.</p>
<p>Calories, protein, carbs, fats all matched, right?</p>
<p>And they provided all the meals to these participants.</p>
<p>So very tightly controlled.</p>
<p>And it was over six weeks.</p>
<p>Both groups lost the exact same amount of body fat.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter for body composition</p>
<p>in terms of like sugar per se.</p>
<p>Then they also looked at some biomarkers of health</p>
<p>like blood lipids and blood sugar and some other things.</p>
<p>Again, there was no real differences.</p>
<p>The only difference was ‚Äì so all their biomarkers improved in both groups.</p>
<p>The only real difference was a small difference in LDL.</p>
<p>So the group eating low sugar had a better improvement slightly in LDL.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s probably because they were eating more fiber.</p>
<p>And we know fiber can bind to cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol.</p>
<p>So is ‚Äì now I want to caveat this.</p>
<p>Sugar probably doesn&rsquo;t have any like positive health effects.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that, right?</p>
<p>And nutrition is an exchange.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re eating one thing, you&rsquo;re not eating another thing, right?</p>
<p>So I ‚Äì but what I would tell people is focus probably less on sugar.</p>
<p>Focus more on fiber.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re eating 30, 40, 50, 60 grams of fiber a day,</p>
<p>but your sugar is 80, 90 grams, I would not be that worried about it,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re controlling calories as well.</p>
<p>What I would be worried about is if you&rsquo;re eating just a decent amount of calories</p>
<p>and not getting enough fiber in general, right?</p>
<p>And even in studies, there&rsquo;s a few meta-analyses out now</p>
<p>looking at isoenergetic exchange of different carbohydrates with sugar carbohydrates,</p>
<p>so fructose and glucose and sucrose.</p>
<p>Now why is this important?</p>
<p>Well, again, if you&rsquo;re not ‚Äì when I say isoenergetic,</p>
<p>that means equal in energy, equal in calories.</p>
<p>So basically when they exchange either sucrose or glucose or fructose</p>
<p>for other forms of carbohydrate,</p>
<p>do they see differences in these markers of health like HbA1c,</p>
<p>fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, and with rare exceptions,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t remember all the data points exactly,</p>
<p>but the take home is it doesn&rsquo;t really seem to make a difference.</p>
<p>Now before anybody out there strawmans my argument,</p>
<p>I am not advocating for sugar consumption,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s important for people to not create weird associations in their minds</p>
<p>because one of the things I&rsquo;ve observed, especially in the fitness industry,</p>
<p>is when people feel like they can&rsquo;t eat something,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s one thing if you say I am choosing not to eat this just because I&rsquo;m choosing to,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very different thing when you&rsquo;re purposely restricting</p>
<p>because you feel like something is bad.</p>
<p>And this ‚Äì I mean you know the human brain is in many ways amazing,</p>
<p>in many ways really dumb.</p>
<p>So when you purposely try to restrict something,</p>
<p>what tends to happen is you&rsquo;re more prone to binge on it.</p>
<p>So people who will try to ‚Äì well, I&rsquo;m never going to eat sugar again,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to try and limit sugar.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the case for everybody,</p>
<p>but they have actually shown now in studies people who are purposely restricting a specific nutrient,</p>
<p>they tend to crave more of that nutrient.</p>
<p>And if they do get exposed to it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more likely to have what&rsquo;s called a disinhibition reflex,</p>
<p>which is basically a binge response.</p>
<p>Because the thinking goes, well, this is bad,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no context on dosage making the poison.</p>
<p>This is just bad in general.</p>
<p>So if I have it, I&rsquo;ve already screwed up.</p>
<p>I might as well just have as much as I want.</p>
<p>And I like Spencer Nadolsky&rsquo;s comparison to this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like getting a flat and then going out and slashing your other three tires</p>
<p>because you might as well.</p>
<p>So I really ‚Äì I try to come from that perspective of I&rsquo;ve seen so many people struggle with ‚Äì</p>
<p>maybe not an eating disorder,</p>
<p>but disordered eating patterns because of these kind of associations they&rsquo;ve made in their mind.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so pedantic and a stickler about saying,</p>
<p>okay, yes, it&rsquo;s a good idea to eat minimally processed food and try to avoid processed foods,</p>
<p>but not because processed foods are bad per se,</p>
<p>but what the outcome tends to be from a lot of processed food consumption,</p>
<p>which is overconsuming calories and then therefore energy toxicity negatively contributing to your health.</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems like it again returns this ‚Äì</p>
<p>the potential for a positive, negative, or neutral behavioral change</p>
<p>and perceptual change of like craving a food all the time that you can&rsquo;t have is terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible state to be in.</p>
<p>And this I think is a perfect segue for something that first brought us together.</p>
<p>Which was this thing about artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>And let me just for the record be very clear.</p>
<p>I have long ingested foods with artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>So I ‚Äì throughout graduate school, I didn&rsquo;t have the best habits.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re healthier now than they were back then.</p>
<p>But I would drink a Diet Coke or two per day.</p>
<p>I still have the occasional Diet Coke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not completely averse to drink something that has artificial sweetener.</p>
<p>Although I do avoid sucralose for reasons that maybe I can get into a little bit later.</p>
<p>But a lot of the things I consume contain stevia, which is not artificial,</p>
<p>but it is a plant-based non-caloric sweetener or low-caloric sweetener.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that.</p>
<p>I became very interested in artificial sweeteners because of the animal data</p>
<p>pointing to the idea that they may disrupt the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And then disrupt the gut microbiome, as you pointed out, is a very broad statement.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know the percentage of lactobacillus, exobacillus, or whatever,</p>
<p>whatever, cillus, illus in there.</p>
<p>They all seem to end in illus, is ideal.</p>
<p>And in fact, a lot of these companies that are having people send in their stool samples</p>
<p>for analysis of the microbiome, I mean, take note.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know what a healthy microbiome looks like.</p>
<p>But we know what an unhealthy microbiome might look like.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of diversity in there.</p>
<p>So I was interested in that.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the recent human study, which we should definitely get into.</p>
<p>But I was mostly interested in artificial sweeteners for the reason that</p>
<p>there is this food conditioning effect.</p>
<p>And you see it in animals and you see it in humans that if you ingest ‚Äì</p>
<p>well, coffee is a really good example.</p>
<p>Coffee doesn&rsquo;t actually taste good, folks, even though I like it.</p>
<p>But when you taste coffee for the first time, most people think it&rsquo;s bitter and disgusting.</p>
<p>Most everybody, like 95% of people, will say this doesn&rsquo;t taste good.</p>
<p>Wine, beer, same thing.</p>
<p>Yep, but people learn to associate the state of being caffeinated,</p>
<p>which most people like in order to just feel normal.</p>
<p>Caffeine is one of the few drugs we ingest just to feel ourselves enough that soon</p>
<p>myself included, really look forward to and enjoy a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a powerful example, in my opinion, of the food conditioning effect.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a Pavlovian thing.</p>
<p>Instead of salivating, you crave.</p>
<p>And it did seem that this study from Dana Small&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>which admittedly was a small, no-pun-intended study itself,</p>
<p>not very many subjects, showed that if you ingested artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>along with food that contained glucose, that you could maybe even get a heightened</p>
<p>glucose response just from the artificial sweeteners after a while.</p>
<p>You and I connected over this study on social media.</p>
<p>You pointed out that the design of the study wasn&rsquo;t superb.</p>
<p>There was co-consumption of glucose, which made it complicated.</p>
<p>We can go into that.</p>
<p>But the reason I&rsquo;m spouting off all this context is artificial sweeteners are many things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to talk about their effects on blood sugar in the acute sense</p>
<p>and according to what we might ingest them with</p>
<p>and how they might be changing blood sugar regulation at the level of brain and or body.</p>
<p>And then the gut microbiome data I think are interesting enough to discuss.</p>
<p>And I have changed my view on artificial sweeteners based on what you&rsquo;ve taught me.</p>
<p>So this is a case where I&rsquo;ve completely changed my view,</p>
<p>which is that now I don&rsquo;t have any problem with them whatsoever based on the current data,</p>
<p>which is not to say that I&rsquo;m gulping down a cup full of super lows,</p>
<p>but I feel okay ingesting some stevia and some aspartame and I&rsquo;m not too worried about it.</p>
<p>So I think kind of stepping back from a broad view,</p>
<p>we have to think about, again, the hierarchy of importance, right?</p>
<p>And what are you replacing with, right?</p>
<p>So there is no situation where it is not a net positive to take somebody who drinks sugar sweetened beverages</p>
<p>and have them drink an artificially sweetened beverage.</p>
<p>Like in the meta-analysis, there was actually a recent network meta-analysis</p>
<p>looking at markers of adiposity, HbA1c, a bunch of different health markers.</p>
<p>And when you substitute, we&rsquo;ll call it non-nutritive sweeteners since stevia is not artificial.</p>
<p>But so when you substitute NNS for the sugar sweetened beverages,</p>
<p>you see improvements in a lot of different things, okay?</p>
<p>What was really interesting about this network meta-analysis was</p>
<p>they also looked at water substitution in place of sugar sweetened beverages.</p>
<p>And the effect wasn&rsquo;t as powerful.</p>
<p>And these are randomized control trials.</p>
<p>So artificial sweetener containing beverages are more beneficial?</p>
<p>Were better for adiposity, for improving adiposity.</p>
<p>And then in the health markers, it was kind of a wash.</p>
<p>Water and non-nutritive sweetener beverages performed similar.</p>
<p>But they were better than sugar sweetened beverages, obviously.</p>
<p>So they then based on a network meta-analysis is kind of where you can compare two things</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t get compared directly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not many studies comparing NNS versus water directly.</p>
<p>But if you have a common comparator, so if you compare A to B and B gets compared to C,</p>
<p>you compare A to C based on how they interacted with B.</p>
<p>Butchering it a little bit, but that&rsquo;s kind of the crux of a network meta-analysis.</p>
<p>So they looked at NNS versus water and found that actually NNS was slightly better</p>
<p>for improving adiposity.</p>
<p>NNS, of course, being non-nutritive sweeteners.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So now again, if you like drinking water and you don&rsquo;t want to ‚Äì</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to convince anybody to do that.</p>
<p>What that seems to suggest is there is a little bit of an appetite suppressant effect</p>
<p>from these artificial sweeteners or non-nutritive sweeteners.</p>
<p>Now, this gets a little more complicated because if these were people drinking</p>
<p>sugar sweetened beverages, maybe they&rsquo;ve already developed a sweet taste</p>
<p>and trying to go to water is too much of a jump for them.</p>
<p>And so going to having something like intermediate is a little bit better.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot wrapped up in this.</p>
<p>But these are the randomized control trials, which are a little bit more tightly controlled,</p>
<p>which I tend to default to a little bit more than I do the epidemiology,</p>
<p>which epidemiology is just so messy because, sure,</p>
<p>non-nutritive sweetener consumption may be associated with different things,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a whole other set of lifestyle and habits that are tied up in that.</p>
<p>So I tend to hang my hat a little bit more on the randomized control trials.</p>
<p>So understanding that, okay, now all things being equal,</p>
<p>understanding that this is a tool that may help some people,</p>
<p>and whenever I post about non-nutritive sweeteners in the comments,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always one or two or three people who say,</p>
<p>all I did was cut out soda and I drank diet soda instead and I lost 50 pounds</p>
<p>or I lost 75 pounds. I even have 1%. I lost 100 pounds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing I did. I mean, that&rsquo;s a pretty massive lever to pull.</p>
<p>If you consider somebody who might be having like, I mean, five or six cokes a day.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, you know, we&rsquo;re talking a serious amount of calories.</p>
<p>And that also means that by replacing with artificial sweetener containing beverages,</p>
<p>they did not replace the soda with food.</p>
<p>Correct. So like, let&rsquo;s now let&rsquo;s talk about, right,</p>
<p>this is where we can get into the micro analysis,</p>
<p>but is that obese person who lost a hundred pounds by doing that?</p>
<p>Do I really care about maybe a small alteration to their gut microbiome?</p>
<p>No, because their gut microbiome is actually much more healthy now by them,</p>
<p>having lost all that excess adipose tissue.</p>
<p>So again, the ranking of what I&rsquo;m worried about, you know,</p>
<p>can change depending on the specific situation.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take somebody like me who&rsquo;s lean and doesn&rsquo;t really have, you know,</p>
<p>any health problems that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>What about artificial sweeteners for me?</p>
<p>Well, for me, I kind of got using them because of bodybuilding contest prep,</p>
<p>because it was about the only appetite suppressant that worked for me.</p>
<p>But do I think that they are healthful? Probably not.</p>
<p>Do I think they&rsquo;re unhealthy?</p>
<p>I would say based on the current data, I don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re unhealthy.</p>
<p>Now, the information on blood glucose.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some of the problems with some of these meta-analyses or these reviews</p>
<p>is they kind of lump all the non-nutritive sweeteners together,</p>
<p>and then they may say, well, there&rsquo;s no effect on this,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s an effect on this.</p>
<p>Well, the problem is these are different molecules,</p>
<p>and they can interact differently.</p>
<p>Aspartame very clearly seems to have no effect on blood sugar or insulin.</p>
<p>That has been repeatedly shown.</p>
<p>Stevia doesn&rsquo;t appear to have much effect.</p>
<p>Saccharin and sucralose, the jury is kind of mixed.</p>
<p>Now, there was the study that we first connected on,</p>
<p>which I think their primary outcome measure was actually</p>
<p>they were looking at like kind of the sweet taste,</p>
<p>like how it affected sweet taste.</p>
<p>So what they did was the group that was getting the sucralose</p>
<p>was also paired with maltodextrin.</p>
<p>The control group was getting sucrose,</p>
<p>which is an appropriate way to compare the sweet taste</p>
<p>because maltodextrin is not as sweet as sucrose.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re trying to combine sucralose, which is already sweet,</p>
<p>with another form of carbohydrate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d want something less sweet compared to your control.</p>
<p>But for the outcome measure of insulin and blood glucose,</p>
<p>probably not as appropriate because we know maltodextrin</p>
<p>has a much higher glycemic index than sucrose.</p>
<p>So they appropriately controlled for taste</p>
<p>and not for the effect of the sweeteners.</p>
<p>And I think that that was a key component.</p>
<p>And I think, yeah, the part of that study that intrigued me</p>
<p>actually was in a talk version of that</p>
<p>because that study drove me to watch a talk that,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get Dana Small on the podcast at some point, hopefully,</p>
<p>was that they had kids do this study</p>
<p>and they actually had to cease the study</p>
<p>because a couple of the kids became pre-diabetic.</p>
<p>I mean, it seemed like there was something hazardous about,</p>
<p>this was at Yale School of Medicine, it&rsquo;s a good place.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a range everywhere,</p>
<p>but it just seemed like there&rsquo;s something about sweet tastes</p>
<p>that if taken to the extreme might be able to impact blood sugar.</p>
<p>This has impacted my sort of behavior.</p>
<p>I try to avoid really sweet things</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re exceptionally delicious or the occasion calls for them</p>
<p>because I do think that it increases my craving for sweet things.</p>
<p>Well, it might not be necessarily a craving,</p>
<p>but it just programs you.</p>
<p>So your taste buds are extremely adaptable.</p>
<p>So take, for example, Indian food.</p>
<p>If you bring Indian people over to America</p>
<p>and have them eat some of our food, they think it tastes extremely bland</p>
<p>because they are used to such spicy food</p>
<p>that unless they have a certain level of spice,</p>
<p>they hardly even taste it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever done a high-sodium diet</p>
<p>and then gone to a low-sodium diet, it feels very bland.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a styrofoam.</p>
<p>But over time, your taste buds adjust.</p>
<p>So sweet is the same thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re used to eating a lot of sweet,</p>
<p>you get kind of desensitized to it,</p>
<p>and then if you go to something less sweet,</p>
<p>it can kind of taste bland at first.</p>
<p>Over time, it&rsquo;ll get better.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s one of those things that, again,</p>
<p>it depends on the situation, right?</p>
<p>If somebody&rsquo;s obese and they said,</p>
<p>well, this is going to help me eliminate sugar, sweet, and beverage,</p>
<p>why would you want to take that tool away from them?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great lever to pull.</p>
<p>I mean, if somebody can lose literally 100 pounds</p>
<p>from just one change in lifestyle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not even really that inconvenient of a change,</p>
<p>that is powerful.</p>
<p>But, again, is it the most healthy thing they could do?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s kind of what tends to get asked.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is it healthier than water?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Maybe as healthy as it?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>But I really make all those caveats</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to have people</p>
<p>who could use this as a tool think,</p>
<p>well, no, I can&rsquo;t do this because it&rsquo;s actually bad for me.</p>
<p>If it helps you lose 50 pounds or 75 pounds or whatever it is,</p>
<p>trust me, it&rsquo;s not bad for you, right?</p>
<p>Well, it does seem to increase these satiety signals.</p>
<p>What do you think about the microbiome effects in this recent study?</p>
<p>Because the recent study, I think, had some nice features to it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve done a detailed description of the study.</p>
<p>So for those that want that.</p>
<p>Is this a two-week study?</p>
<p>Yeah, and we will provide a link.</p>
<p>You did an excellent video on this on your YouTube channel</p>
<p>that really parses each piece.</p>
<p>But they compared the various artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>and looked at the glucose response,</p>
<p>looked at microbiome, a number of different measures.</p>
<p>What was your general takeaway?</p>
<p>And this was in humans for, I think,</p>
<p>the first time looking at microbiome in humans</p>
<p>due to artificial sweetener.</p>
<p>There are a few studies on the microbiome in humans</p>
<p>with artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>The first two that came out showed pretty much no effect.</p>
<p>But they were a little bit shorter in duration.</p>
<p>They were like two to four weeks.</p>
<p>And again, it depends on what bacteria are getting measured, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s many different kinds of bacteria.</p>
<p>So they could just be measuring one that didn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>And then there was a 10-week study that came out</p>
<p>that got a lot of press.</p>
<p>And they showed, I think it was sucralose, I think.</p>
<p>They showed an effect of change on the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Now, what was interesting is when I went into the species that changed,</p>
<p>the species that changed the most compared to control</p>
<p>was a species called, I&rsquo;m going to butcher the name,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like Blaudia coccoidus, I think it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>I must say for those that work on the microbiome,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so difficult to pronounce.</p>
<p>You need a nomenclature committee and you need acronyms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry. Just do it. Enough already.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re killing us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll call it BC.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to start the nomenclature committee without you</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t do it soon.</p>
<p>So they noticed that this went up by like three to fourfold.</p>
<p>So I kind of went down the rabbit hole on this.</p>
<p>So interestingly, that particular species of bacteria</p>
<p>is actually associated with lower adiposity,</p>
<p>better insulin sensitivity,</p>
<p>and people who are obese and children who are obese</p>
<p>tend to have less of it.</p>
<p>So I said, well, based on that study,</p>
<p>you could actually argue that maybe sucralose</p>
<p>actually improved the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Now, again, I&rsquo;m not making that claim</p>
<p>because we have a hard time understanding</p>
<p>what a healthy microbiome looks like already.</p>
<p>This last study that came out,</p>
<p>my biggest take-home was I think it&rsquo;s safe to say</p>
<p>that some of these non-nutritive sweeteners</p>
<p>are not metabolically inert.</p>
<p>There are some effects.</p>
<p>Now, are those effects good, bad, or neutral?</p>
<p>I think has yet to be fully elucidated.</p>
<p>Now, I focused more on the blood glucose responses in my analysis.</p>
<p>So in that 10-week study,</p>
<p>they did oral glucose tolerance tests.</p>
<p>And their conclusion, I didn&rsquo;t really feel like fit their data.</p>
<p>So their conclusion was that, and again, I think it was sucralose,</p>
<p>that it elevated blood glucose.</p>
<p>And this is where statistics can get kind of tricky.</p>
<p>So my take-home was the area under the curve,</p>
<p>the incremental area under the curve,</p>
<p>which is looking at basically the entire glucose response,</p>
<p>was not different between the control and the sucralose group.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s the biggest take-home.</p>
<p>There was one time point at the end of the study in the sucralose group,</p>
<p>the 30-minute time point,</p>
<p>that was statistically significantly higher blood glucose</p>
<p>than the control group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of one of those things where I go,</p>
<p>okay, it was one time point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s statistically significant,</p>
<p>but even then we&rsquo;ve seen things be statistically significant</p>
<p>that end up being data artifacts because they&rsquo;re not reproduced.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening here,</p>
<p>but again, the overall area under the curve was not different.</p>
<p>So to me, that was the biggest take-home.</p>
<p>And papers, we should probably mention,</p>
<p>are published because of effects, generally.</p>
<p>Lack of effect, harder to publish.</p>
<p>Null hypothesis doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s actually really unfortunate</p>
<p>because a null hypothesis is just as useful data</p>
<p>as the non-null hypothesis.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right, there is a very strong publication bias</p>
<p>towards showing an effect versus not.</p>
<p>Unless you can flip a field on its head entirely</p>
<p>by showing something did not happen,</p>
<p>typically the positive result out does the negative result in.</p>
<p>Positive meaning you see a result.</p>
<p>And then, of course, it&rsquo;s one study.</p>
<p>And I think that, as you talked about earlier,</p>
<p>the center of mass of data in a given field</p>
<p>are probably the best basis for what we should do.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not changing my behavior</p>
<p>around the intake of artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>I personally am still going to consume stevia and aspartame</p>
<p>in relatively small amounts.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m thinking, well, okay,</p>
<p>if something contains sucralose,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to perhaps actively avoid it.</p>
<p>Whereas before I was, I was actively avoiding it.</p>
<p>The new study I thought was very elegantly, very involved.</p>
<p>I mean, to be quite frank,</p>
<p>some of the animal stuff they did was extremely impressive.</p>
<p>So there was actually two arms to this study.</p>
<p>One was a human arm, one was the animal arm.</p>
<p>I focused much more on the human side of it.</p>
<p>So basically this was a two-week study.</p>
<p>And the really unique aspect of this,</p>
<p>which I think is both a strength and a weakness,</p>
<p>they had almost 1,400 people apply for this study.</p>
<p>And they only had 120, I think, that actually went into it</p>
<p>because they did a very detailed food analysis of these folks.</p>
<p>All these people said that they avoided artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>or didn&rsquo;t consume them.</p>
<p>And I think people don&rsquo;t realize how ubiquitous sweeteners are.</p>
<p>Prior to the study, these people were like,</p>
<p>it was like jury selection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like not ever hearing of the plaintiff and the defendant.</p>
<p>These are these mutant people</p>
<p>who have never had an artificial sweetener.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So the strength is now you don&rsquo;t have a lot of preexisting effects</p>
<p>that may be clouding what would actually happen when you add it in.</p>
<p>Like, for example,</p>
<p>if you have people who are already consuming artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>and then you have them consume artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>the likelihood things are going to change is pretty low, right?</p>
<p>So I think that that&rsquo;s a strength.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a weakness.</p>
<p>And I want to be really careful</p>
<p>because I think people took my words a little bit too far,</p>
<p>which means I probably didn&rsquo;t do a good job of being nuanced enough.</p>
<p>There is the possibility for a placebo effect here.</p>
<p>So to me, if somebody has gone through that much painstaking care</p>
<p>to avoid artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely they have a preconceived notion that those are bad for you</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s possible if they&rsquo;re eating a very minimally processed diet</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re just not exposed to them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very true as well.</p>
<p>But the other thing that the researchers acknowledged</p>
<p>was they weren&rsquo;t able to blind the study</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;ve never had an artificial sweetener before,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only used to, like, regular sugar,</p>
<p>and you have an artificial sweetener, you know.</p>
<p>You taste it.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still sweet, but it&rsquo;s not the same sweet.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s an interesting effect there</p>
<p>where a lot of people don&rsquo;t like the taste of aspartame the first time.</p>
<p>I actually quit drinking diet soda for a while thinking I should</p>
<p>and then had one.</p>
<p>It tasted really, I can only describe it as kind of artificial, chemical.</p>
<p>And then pretty soon, it tasted great again.</p>
<p>And so there is some attenuation there.</p>
<p>And whether or not that&rsquo;s central, meaning within the brain,</p>
<p>or peripheral, I don&rsquo;t know, but very interesting.</p>
<p>Well, I see you as playing a critical role</p>
<p>in defining what is and what isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>what still needs to be determined in terms of this landscape</p>
<p>and the entire landscape, really, of nutrition.</p>
<p>And that study did change my opinion in terms of,</p>
<p>okay, I think we can clearly say now that these aren&rsquo;t neutral,</p>
<p>or sorry, that they&rsquo;re not inert, right?</p>
<p>That was the thought process before.</p>
<p>It was, well, they&rsquo;re not digested or whatnot,</p>
<p>so they must be inert.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t appear to be the case.</p>
<p>But again, when we look at the blood glucose data,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying this is what happened.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is what happened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s possible this happened.</p>
<p>And so this is why we need more studies to verify.</p>
<p>If these people had a preconceived notion</p>
<p>that artificial sweeteners were bad for them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible, knowing they&rsquo;re ingesting artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>that they could have had a blood glucose response.</p>
<p>Now, my pushback on my own point there would be,</p>
<p>then we should have expected to see it</p>
<p>in all the non-nutritive sweeteners, which they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It was just in sucralose and saccharin.</p>
<p>It was kind of a graded effect,</p>
<p>where sucralose and saccharin showed the most dramatic change,</p>
<p>and stevia and a few of the others did not.</p>
<p>And the other issue I took with it,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a ticky-tack thing,</p>
<p>was their primary outcome measure was blood glucose,</p>
<p>the oral glucose tolerance test.</p>
<p>But they had people administer their own oral glucose tolerance test,</p>
<p>which basically they said, okay, drink this drink,</p>
<p>and they were wearing continuous glucose monitors,</p>
<p>which should have been fine.</p>
<p>But again, to me, and I&rsquo;m being ticky-tacky,</p>
<p>and again, I know all studies are limited by funding,</p>
<p>so I think overall this was a great study,</p>
<p>but I would have liked to have seen them monitor</p>
<p>the oral glucose tolerance test to administer it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and what they did before or after.</p>
<p>You want to know that they didn&rsquo;t ingest this or didn&rsquo;t ingest that.</p>
<p>Right. Those two things.</p>
<p>But one of the caveat is it was a two-week study.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got to be really careful how much we interpret in this,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also possible that this is a transient effect.</p>
<p>And maybe it goes away over time. We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But again, I think we can clearly say it&rsquo;s not inert.</p>
<p>Now, how much emphasis we put on that on a two-week study,</p>
<p>I still will say, okay, maybe if you&rsquo;re worried,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t consume Sucralose.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re 100 pounds overweight</p>
<p>and you want to use some Sucralose as a replacement to help you lose weight,</p>
<p>I would say don&rsquo;t let this study deter you from doing that,</p>
<p>because the net effect is still going to be more positive</p>
<p>than you not losing the weight.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s a tool that helps you, fine.</p>
<p>But I do hold open the idea that, well,</p>
<p>there could be negative effects from it as well.</p>
<p>But again, we&rsquo;re looking at what is the overall outcome, right?</p>
<p>And then when I looked at ‚Äì they examined some of the different things</p>
<p>that were increased with these different sweeteners.</p>
<p>And again, this word gets messy,</p>
<p>because one of the things they saw was a big increase in butyrate production</p>
<p>from the change in the gut microbiome, presumably.</p>
<p>Well, as we discussed earlier,</p>
<p>butyrate is actually associated with positive outcomes</p>
<p>in terms of insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and some other things.</p>
<p>So I just ‚Äì I want to be real cautious before people say,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s a change in the microbiome. It must be a bad change.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And again, if we have 10 more studies come out and start to show this,</p>
<p>then I will start to shift my personal opinion of artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>So in anticipation of sitting down today,</p>
<p>I did solicit for questions on social media.</p>
<p>And one of the questions that got a lot of upvotes, likes, if you will,</p>
<p>was one that I think raises interesting questions</p>
<p>about short-term and long-term health, and it&rsquo;s the following.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a common scenario.</p>
<p>A number of people want to know,</p>
<p>what is the healthiest way to approach a kind of rapid weight loss?</p>
<p>And here what I think is happening is somebody has an event coming up</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re just tired of being the weight they are</p>
<p>or carrying the amount of adipose tissue they are,</p>
<p>and they wanted to know whether or not it is safe to, for instance,</p>
<p>lose three pounds a week for a few weeks in anticipation of a wedding</p>
<p>or some other event, and whether or not straight caloric restriction</p>
<p>and increasing activity is the best way to approach that.</p>
<p>With the understanding that they may gain back a little afterwards,</p>
<p>I think ideally they&rsquo;d like to maintain it afterwards,</p>
<p>but what do you think of that sort of approach,</p>
<p>cutting caloric intake in half, for instance,</p>
<p>and then doubling and also doubling your physical output?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting because you might be surprised by what I&rsquo;m going to say,</p>
<p>which is the research data actually tends to suggest</p>
<p>that people who are obese, who lose a lot more weight early,</p>
<p>are more likely to keep it off,</p>
<p>which seems a little bit kind of contradictory, right?</p>
<p>Like, well, that doesn&rsquo;t seem very sustainable,</p>
<p>but again, you&rsquo;re weighing competing things,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s sustainability aspect,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also like buy-in is huge for sustainability, right?</p>
<p>So for a lot of overweight or obese people,</p>
<p>if they start a diet and they don&rsquo;t see something quickly,</p>
<p>they kind of bail on it because it&rsquo;s not working,</p>
<p>whereas if they see some rapid results pretty quickly,</p>
<p>they buy in even harder, right?</p>
<p>And so I think the conversation,</p>
<p>especially for if there&rsquo;s any coaches or trainers out there,</p>
<p>is just presenting that as the ‚Äì</p>
<p>one of my favorite lines is there are no solutions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only tradeoffs.</p>
<p>I think Thomas Sowell said that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re having a tradeoff here.</p>
<p>It is ‚Äì yes, you&rsquo;re going to lose fat faster.</p>
<p>You might lose lean mass a little bit faster too,</p>
<p>which can be a problem.</p>
<p>But I will say the more adipose tissue you have,</p>
<p>the more aggressively you can diet without negative consequences.</p>
<p>Somebody like me doing a really aggressive diet</p>
<p>is not going to be good for my lean mass.</p>
<p>One, I have a higher lean mass than normal.</p>
<p>Two, I have a lower body fat than normal.</p>
<p>As your body fat goes down,</p>
<p>the percentage of weight loss from lean mass goes up.</p>
<p>So people who are very obese,</p>
<p>because they have so much adipose tissue to pull from,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very little reason for the body to catabolize lean tissue.</p>
<p>Now, that being said,</p>
<p>if you go on a ‚Äì people misinterpret like ‚Äì</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, well, I got an in-body done and ‚Äì</p>
<p>or a dexed done and I&rsquo;ve lost two pounds of lean mass</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve lost 20 pounds overall.</p>
<p>Well, keep in mind adipose tissue itself is 13% lean mass.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually like protein component to ‚Äì</p>
<p>like the structural component of the adipose tissue</p>
<p>and it does have some water.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about 87% lipid but the other part is lean.</p>
<p>So at minimum, you should expect a 13% reduction in lean mass when you diet</p>
<p>and then when you consider like you lose body water overall,</p>
<p>which is ‚Äì registers as lean mass and you lose ‚Äì</p>
<p>your spleen tissues can shrink a little bit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s normal to lose ‚Äì</p>
<p>for the average person to lose like 25% or 30% of the weight</p>
<p>that they lose from lean mass but that doesn&rsquo;t mean skeletal muscle tissue.</p>
<p>And again, the more adipose you have,</p>
<p>the more aggressively you can approach the diet</p>
<p>without really negative long-term consequences to lean mass or your overall health.</p>
<p>But balance that with, okay, if I&rsquo;m going to do this,</p>
<p>I need to understand that I&rsquo;m not going to be dieting this way forever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing this to give myself a boost at the beginning</p>
<p>and I have to be okay at some point with transitioning to something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit more sustainable.</p>
<p>Based on what you just said, it reminds me of the satiety signal effect</p>
<p>of exercise you mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>that exercising can improve our sense of when we&rsquo;ve had enough to eat.</p>
<p>I just want to briefly mention that when Allie Crum was on the podcast,</p>
<p>she mentioned that they&rsquo;ve been doing a study that ‚Äì</p>
<p>I have to pair you two and hear the conversation as a fly on the wall</p>
<p>because what she was telling me was that if people believe</p>
<p>that a food is nutritious for them,</p>
<p>then eating less of it registers as more satiating.</p>
<p>Whereas if people view dieting as a deprivation system,</p>
<p>like, oh, dieting is hard and the food sucks and it&rsquo;s terrible,</p>
<p>well, then they crave all sorts of other things.</p>
<p>Whereas they actually observe in their studies where people report reduced craving</p>
<p>if they are told, for instance, a chicken breast and broccoli</p>
<p>and some olive oil and rice is actually quite nourishing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really good for you.</p>
<p>Then people eat that and they feel like they&rsquo;ve actually eaten more.</p>
<p>The satiety signaling goes up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a point that Allie made.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t my data.</p>
<p>Satiety is so impressive because even the rate at which you eat</p>
<p>and right down to the size of the plate and the color of the plate,</p>
<p>like the contrast in color.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>They see ‚Äì I can&rsquo;t remember exactly.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s if the plate is a similar color to the food,</p>
<p>I think people eat more.</p>
<p>Whereas if it&rsquo;s a bigger contrast, they eat less.</p>
<p>So even like plate color can make a difference on how much you eat.</p>
<p>So again, human brain, very amazing but also very dumb in some ways, right?</p>
<p>Not an optimized algorithm.</p>
<p>I always joke with people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, just look at how stupid humans are.</p>
<p>You put some water in front of them like the ocean.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, yeah, I&rsquo;ll pay ten times more for this.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;re kind of wired that way.</p>
<p>The reward signaling pathways in the brain run one chemical mainly, dopamine.</p>
<p>There are others, of course, and very few algorithms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like an intermittent reinforcement is one random reinforcement.</p>
<p>But in the end, there aren&rsquo;t many algorithms,</p>
<p>and we are probably not optimized, certainly not optimized for our own health</p>
<p>because people will eat themselves to death, drug themselves to death, et cetera,</p>
<p>simply because something felt good at one point.</p>
<p>It proves your point.</p>
<p>One of the things I tell people,</p>
<p>I said this on Andy Frisella&rsquo;s podcast was interestingly,</p>
<p>the dichotomy of life is if you do what&rsquo;s easy in the short term,</p>
<p>your life will be hard.</p>
<p>If you do what&rsquo;s hard in the short term, your life will get easier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very strange, and actually, Ethan Suplee had a great example of this.</p>
<p>When he was over 500 pounds, he said,</p>
<p>the amount of work I had to do to construct my life that I could just live</p>
<p>was so much more work than just going to the gym for a couple hours a day.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, the gym work is hard.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, but when I look back at how much work I had to do to sustain that lifestyle</p>
<p>versus just going to the gym and restricting calories,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, to maintain the lifestyle of being 500 pounds</p>
<p>was infinitely more difficult than what I do now.</p>
<p>And so, again, a great example.</p>
<p>Short term, hard, going to the gym, calorie restriction.</p>
<p>Long term, life&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>Just really interesting dichotomy, I think, about a lot.</p>
<p>And it probably can&rsquo;t be restated often enough.</p>
<p>Seed oils.</p>
<p>People want to ask about seed oils.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are listening who are wondering why we&rsquo;re sort of chuckling already,</p>
<p>I should mention that both in the Twitter sphere and Instagram and online,</p>
<p>there are these very polarized views that probably aren&rsquo;t worth focusing on for too long.</p>
<p>But there are a number of folks out there who are arguing that seed oils</p>
<p>are the source of all the obesity epidemic, inflammation, et cetera.</p>
<p>Illuminati.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>And then there are those that would argue just the opposite,</p>
<p>that meat is the source of all problems, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve, thanks to your nuance and expertise,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve hopefully appropriately framed things that it&rsquo;s never that black and white.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply not.</p>
<p>Rarely.</p>
<p>Rarely.</p>
<p>I love olive oil.</p>
<p>I realize that doesn&rsquo;t fit exactly into the seed oil category.</p>
<p>I love olive oil.</p>
<p>I use it in moderation.</p>
<p>I do also consume some butter in moderation, et cetera.</p>
<p>But are there any data on seed oils?</p>
<p>And here a good example I think would be like canola oil,</p>
<p>which comes from the rape seed that literally was renamed canola oil</p>
<p>because rape seed oil is not good marketing.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, exactly.</p>
<p>So the first thing I&rsquo;ll say is seed oils have negatively contributed</p>
<p>to our overall health because people in the last 20, 30 years,</p>
<p>what they have tended to add into their diet that has increased</p>
<p>the overall calorie load is oil, like these various,</p>
<p>mostly from seed oils.</p>
<p>But when we look at like one-to-one replacement with other fats,</p>
<p>and so if you look at the epidemiology, yeah,</p>
<p>you can find some epidemiology showing people who consume more seed oil</p>
<p>have more negative health outcomes.</p>
<p>Problem is, again, tied up with a multitude of other behaviors.</p>
<p>And then you can find mechanisms and the idea is, well, these have,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re polyunsaturated, which means in the fatty acid chain,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s multiple double bonds,</p>
<p>which those double bonds can be oxidized when they&rsquo;re exposed to heat</p>
<p>and some other things.</p>
<p>And so the idea is, well, when you cook with these things and they get,</p>
<p>they may get oxidized and that&rsquo;s going to cause inflammation in your body.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a plausible mechanism.</p>
<p>So as always, I defer to the human randomized control trials.</p>
<p>And so what you tend to find is when you substitute polyunsaturated fats,</p>
<p>or sorry, when you substitute saturated fats for polyunsaturated fats,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either neutral or positive in terms of the effects on,</p>
<p>like inflammation is basically neutral.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some studies that show a positive effect of doing polyunsaturated fats,</p>
<p>but it probably depends on the individual polyunsaturated fat.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the other thing I don&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>is difficult because you&rsquo;re categorizing like everything in this one bucket</p>
<p>and there are some differences between individual fatty acids.</p>
<p>Even with saturated fat, like for example,</p>
<p>stearic acid doesn&rsquo;t tend to raise LDL cholesterol,</p>
<p>whereas saturated fat as a whole tends to raise LDL cholesterol,</p>
<p>but there are some saturated fats that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re putting things in buckets</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a little more nuanced than that.</p>
<p>Then if you look at like the effects of polyunsaturated fats</p>
<p>on markers of cardiovascular disease,</p>
<p>again tends to either be a neutral or positive effect</p>
<p>when you substitute saturated fat for polyunsaturated fat.</p>
<p>Now if you want to get into like monounsaturated versus polyunsaturated,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s quite a bit of disagreement between the studies.</p>
<p>What I would say based on the human randomized control trials</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re probably better off consuming monounsaturated</p>
<p>and polyunsaturated in place of saturated fat.</p>
<p>But again, if the idea is,</p>
<p>well, that means polyunsaturated are good for me,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just going to dump a bunch of oil on everything</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re upping your calories.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a negative now because you have to deal</p>
<p>with the bigger problem of overall energy toxicity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not somebody who likes to demonize individual nutrients.</p>
<p>I just haven&rsquo;t seen really compelling evidence</p>
<p>that seed oils are the root cause of the problems that are being suggested.</p>
<p>And I think this is a good example of kind of like</p>
<p>whenever there&rsquo;s something that pops up in the fitness industry,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always like the opposite thing that pops up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like the reactionary extreme reaction</p>
<p>to whatever this thing was over here.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re seeing with some of the seed oil stuff</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s mostly people who are trying to kind of expose</p>
<p>the virtues of saturated fat.</p>
<p>And listen, I think it&rsquo;s fine to consume some saturated fat.</p>
<p>But again, I think limiting it to 7% to 10% of your daily calorie intake</p>
<p>is probably wise, again, based on all the consensus of the evidence I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>And so once again, like we&rsquo;re struggling with this.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ve got this epidemiology and these mechanisms that sound good,</p>
<p>but then what actually happens when we do some human randomized control trials</p>
<p>and so far I just haven&rsquo;t seen the evidence to suggest that</p>
<p>seed oils are independently bad for you independent of the calories they contain.</p>
<p>You said the words overall energy toxicity</p>
<p>and I just want to highlight that I think that&rsquo;s a fabulous term.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think enough people think about that</p>
<p>because they are primed or we are all primed to think,</p>
<p>okay, seed oils might be bad or artificial sweeteners might be bad</p>
<p>or this particular component of blood work might represent something good or bad</p>
<p>without taking into account overall energy toxicity,</p>
<p>the toxicity of over-consuming calories, energy.</p>
<p>And thank you for pointing out that most of the data point to the fact</p>
<p>that saturated fat should make up about no more than 7% to 10% of total daily caloric intake.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lower end threshold that can be problematic.</p>
<p>For instance, I&rsquo;ve noticed that my blood profiles,</p>
<p>especially in terms of hormones, improve when I&rsquo;m getting sufficient saturated fat.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a mutant, but years ago because I&rsquo;m a product of growing up in the 90s,</p>
<p>I tried a low-fat diet.</p>
<p>It certainly crushed my androgen levels.</p>
<p>I started adding some butter back in and I was right back in the sweet zone where I wanted to be.</p>
<p>So 7% to 10% of total daily caloric intake, I&rsquo;m guessing, is probably about what I do now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to check.</p>
<p>But is there a danger to going too low in saturated fats?</p>
<p>So again, no solutions, only trade-offs, right?</p>
<p>What maximizes out testosterone might not be the best thing for longevity and vice versa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making that claim specifically, but I think it&rsquo;s important to understand this,</p>
<p>that I think we all have this idea that there&rsquo;s this one iconic diet out there</p>
<p>that is going to be the best diet for building muscle and burning fat and preventing cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p>And the reality is there&rsquo;s overall healthy dietary patterns that we see that are good for those things.</p>
<p>But when we get down into the weeds, there&rsquo;s probably some push and pull here as well, right?</p>
<p>So when it comes to saturated fat, there is some evidence that if you&rsquo;re too low on it,</p>
<p>that yes, you can have a reduction in testosterone.</p>
<p>Now, is that reduction in testosterone, let&rsquo;s say 15%, 20%, whatever it may be,</p>
<p>is that sufficient to actually cause loss of lean mass?</p>
<p>That we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s never been shown.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I just remembered this.</p>
<p>There was one study that was comparing polyunsaturated fat versus saturated fat,</p>
<p>and they equated total fat.</p>
<p>And one of the really interesting things was the group getting the polyunsaturated fat</p>
<p>had more lean mass at the end of the study compared to the group getting saturated fat.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s only one study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen this replicated.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very ‚Äì this is a situation where I say I would like to find out what the mechanism of that is</p>
<p>because this could just be random.</p>
<p>But if that gets shown over and over, what I might say is,</p>
<p>okay, well, what are we ‚Äì if polyunsaturateds are somehow increasing lean mass compared to saturated fat,</p>
<p>who cares what happens with testosterone,</p>
<p>unless that reduction in testosterone is causing some kind of impotence for your life, right?</p>
<p>So all that to say, I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s something for those watching and listening, real experts,</p>
<p>every once in a while you should hear them say the following words, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>My graduate advisor was exceptional at that and she was brilliant, right?</p>
<p>And then in terms of like cholesterol synthesis,</p>
<p>you really need a very, very small amount of saturated fat for LDL cholesterol synthesis.</p>
<p>Your liver can synthesize.</p>
<p>Like the amount of LDL cholesterol or cholesterol that your body requires is so small</p>
<p>in terms of like just living and being healthy.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think you need to worry about that.</p>
<p>And from a cardiovascular disease standpoint,</p>
<p>there is some evidence that even taking people who have like quote unquote low LDL of like 80 or 90</p>
<p>and taking them down to like 30 or 40,</p>
<p>that there is still a benefit for the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>So again, you&rsquo;re weighing these two buckets, right?</p>
<p>So what I say, if you&rsquo;re doing 7 to 10 percent from saturated fat, you&rsquo;re probably fine.</p>
<p>I received a lot of questions about whether or not there are female specific diet</p>
<p>and exercise protocols.</p>
<p>And I realize this is a vast landscape,</p>
<p>but some of those questions related to menopause and premenopause</p>
<p>and some related to the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>most related to variations across the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>In terms of let&rsquo;s just say diet maintenance or subcaloric diet,</p>
<p>are there any things that you&rsquo;ve observed?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk a little bit later about this wonderful app that you&rsquo;ve produced,</p>
<p>this carbon app, which helps people manage their energy intake and a number of other things.</p>
<p>And so there you have a sort of a database or at least an experience base.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m guessing there are probably also studies exploring male versus female differences</p>
<p>in terms of adherence and what sorts of diets work.</p>
<p>Are there any general themes that one can extract from that?</p>
<p>This is going to be a really unpopular segment for the women.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to make a big difference.</p>
<p>Well, actually, they may be relieved to hear that</p>
<p>because it would make sorting through the information space</p>
<p>and certainly the information we&rsquo;ve covered in this podcast up until now simpler.</p>
<p>It means that everything isn&rsquo;t different for them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you look at the male versus female studies in relation to diet,</p>
<p>they seem to respond to some similar way,</p>
<p>like similar calorie deficit seems to produce similar results.</p>
<p>If you do low carb, high carb, regardless, it seems to boil down to the same principles.</p>
<p>Now, training wise, we do know that female,</p>
<p>like the muscle fibers adapt a little bit differently to training,</p>
<p>but without getting too far into the weeds,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really change the way you should train</p>
<p>because for the most part, building muscle, there&rsquo;s a lot of different ways to build muscle.</p>
<p>So we know that light loads up to maybe like 30 reps,</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s taken close to failure,</p>
<p>have basically the same effect on building muscle,</p>
<p>at least in the short term, as heavy loads for low reps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly about taking the muscle close to fatigue or failure.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go to failure, but getting close within a few reps.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re between one rep and 30 reps,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting close to failure, seem to produce similar results.</p>
<p>So again, great.</p>
<p>You can pick with whichever form of discomfort you prefer, right?</p>
<p>When it comes to female specific training,</p>
<p>again, females actually, this is one thing that a lot of people don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They actually put on a similar amount of lean mass</p>
<p>as a percentage of their starting lean mass as men.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s no statistically significant difference</p>
<p>in the amount of lean mass they put on.</p>
<p>Now, the absolute amount of lean mass that&rsquo;s added will be greater for men</p>
<p>because they started with a greater amount of lean mass.</p>
<p>But the relative increase in lean mass is pretty much the same from similar training.</p>
<p>Now, females, there&rsquo;s some differences in like fiber types.</p>
<p>Females tend to be a little bit less fatigable than men.</p>
<p>They can go a little bit harder, a little bit longer.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also some evidence that they recover a little bit better.</p>
<p>But that also could be simply due to the fact that they&rsquo;re not able to use</p>
<p>as heavy of loads to induce hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So I kind of have this theory that while, you know,</p>
<p>as a percentage of your one rep max, you can program things,</p>
<p>I think absolute load matters.</p>
<p>When you look at like the most elite power lifters,</p>
<p>the super heavyweights aren&rsquo;t squatting three or four times a week</p>
<p>because, you know, they&rsquo;re squatting 800, 900 pounds.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s an overall recovery effect there.</p>
<p>Again, I have no data to back this up.</p>
<p>This is just my observation.</p>
<p>But when you get into the lighter weight classes, and this goes for men too,</p>
<p>you do see quite a few people who do, you know, many training sessions at high RPEs</p>
<p>and seem to be able to recover from that.</p>
<p>So I do think the absolute load makes a difference.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to like menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>this is one of those things where I kind of tell people,</p>
<p>you know, do what you prefer.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some people who have said you should program,</p>
<p>you should like kind of schedule your training around your menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>which is whenever you&rsquo;re going through your menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>you know, reduce the intensity, reduce the volume,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re, you know, you&rsquo;re not going to feel as good,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to train as well.</p>
<p>What I would say is just auto-regulate that.</p>
<p>If you go in and you&rsquo;re on your period but you feel good</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing well that day,</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t think you necessarily need to back it off.</p>
<p>And there was one study that kind of supported that notion.</p>
<p>But if you go in and you feel terrible and, you know,</p>
<p>you feel like you could use, you know, a reduction in intensity and volume,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s totally fine to auto-regulate that.</p>
<p>And when I say auto-regulation,</p>
<p>auto-regulation means you are regulating the individual training session</p>
<p>based on your performance.</p>
<p>So I auto-regulate insofar as like I&rsquo;m a super nerd,</p>
<p>so I have a velocity device so I can actually attach to the bar</p>
<p>and see how fast the load moves.</p>
<p>And I know at various different like warm-up weights</p>
<p>what velocities I should be hitting.</p>
<p>So if I hit my last warm-up and my velocity is about 10% higher than usual,</p>
<p>I can be pretty confident that that&rsquo;s going to be a good day for me.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s lower, then I can back it off a little bit.</p>
<p>In fact, at Worlds, when I hit my last deadlift,</p>
<p>it was 30% ‚Äì my last deadlift warm-up,</p>
<p>it was 30% faster than I usually hit in the gym.</p>
<p>And I turned and looked at my coach and I said,</p>
<p>yeah, we&rsquo;re going to get this today.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s various forms of ways to auto-regulate.</p>
<p>But again, women, if you&rsquo;re on your period but you feel good,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any reason you need to back off.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not feeling good, then it&rsquo;s totally appropriate to back off.</p>
<p>Raw versus cooked foods.</p>
<p>People wanted to know whether or not, for instance,</p>
<p>eating a raw apple versus ‚Äì I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Does anyone cook apples?</p>
<p>People used to bake.</p>
<p>They were baked apples was a dessert when I was a kid.</p>
<p>It was kind of the letdown dessert.</p>
<p>Sorry, mom.</p>
<p>It was kind of like not awesome unless it had a scoop of ice cream in it.</p>
<p>Even then, maybe not awesome.</p>
<p>But anyway, raw versus cooked.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you burn a piece of meat to the point where it&rsquo;s pure charcoal,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>There is a small movement surrounding eating raw meats.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something I particularly enjoy, frankly.</p>
<p>Sushi is the only raw food I personally ingest.</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p>I am very careful about the sourcing, frankly.</p>
<p>Reputable places.</p>
<p>Is there anything real about this in terms of being able to extract the amino acids,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals from the food raw versus cooked?</p>
<p>It just looks cool for Instagram.</p>
<p>When you cook foods, they actually tend to become ‚Äì in terms of protein-containing foods,</p>
<p>they tend to become more digestible, not less.</p>
<p>Eggs are this way.</p>
<p>Meats are this way.</p>
<p>People say, well, when you heat protein, you denature it.</p>
<p>I think they hear that word denature and they think destroy.</p>
<p>That is not what denature means.</p>
<p>Proteins fold up into 3D dimensional structures.</p>
<p>You know this, of course, based on their amino acid sequence</p>
<p>and their specific energies of those amino acids.</p>
<p>When you heat protein or add acid, it starts to unfold that protein structure.</p>
<p>That happens during digestion anyway.</p>
<p>So I always chuckle when ‚Äì like I&rsquo;ve seen some companies come out with</p>
<p>way that you can cook with, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to destroy the amino acids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, so you mean like regular way, right?</p>
<p>So yeah, typically cooking actually makes amino acids more bioavailable, not less.</p>
<p>Now I would stay away from charring your meat because there is some evidence</p>
<p>that charring creates polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which at least in animals,</p>
<p>when they give those, they appear to be carcinogenic.</p>
<p>So if you do char your meat by accident, I would just cut off the charred portions</p>
<p>and then you should be fine.</p>
<p>Char is delicious.</p>
<p>Not if it&rsquo;s charred too much, but there is something about a charred crust on a meat.</p>
<p>My dad&rsquo;s Argentinean. I would like a good charred barbecue.</p>
<p>What about ‚Äì people referred to them in their questions as carb blockers,</p>
<p>but I think what they&rsquo;re referring to are things like berberine</p>
<p>and some of the glucose scavengers.</p>
<p>One glucose scavenger I&rsquo;d love for you to comment on is this assertion</p>
<p>that taking a brisk walk after a meal or maybe even a slow walk after a meal,</p>
<p>some movement can help downshift the amount of circulating glucose in some way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that.</p>
<p>Not a lot of people, but some are starting to pay attention to this idea</p>
<p>of taking things like berberine or even metformin can scavenge glucose.</p>
<p>I personally can&rsquo;t take berberine.</p>
<p>If I take it, I get massive headaches unless I&rsquo;ve ingested tons of sugar</p>
<p>and carbohydrates, so I just don&rsquo;t mess around with it.</p>
<p>But I know there are a number of people out there that want to know</p>
<p>whether or not these glucose scavengers can be useful.</p>
<p>I think that is really majoring in the minors, if I&rsquo;m being honest.</p>
<p>As far as the carb blockers, there&rsquo;s some white kidney bean extract</p>
<p>and those sorts of things.</p>
<p>They do block the digestion of carbohydrates, some.</p>
<p>So when I say block, that&rsquo;s those watching or listening.</p>
<p>Metabolism is typically not on and off switches.</p>
<p>When we say things like block or attenuate or inhibit,</p>
<p>typically we&rsquo;re not talking about just a switch on the wall</p>
<p>that you press it and everything turns off.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a dimmer switch.</p>
<p>It just changes the emphasis.</p>
<p>But these carb blockers can reduce the absorption of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>Now, they don&rsquo;t seem to cause weight loss when you just do it a normal diet.</p>
<p>Now, why is that?</p>
<p>Well, all it does is once those carbohydrates get to the large intestine</p>
<p>and your bacteria get a hold of them,</p>
<p>they start fermenting them to volatile fatty acids</p>
<p>which get reabsorbed into your liver.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t get the increase in blood glucose,</p>
<p>but you still get almost all the calories from it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just in a different form.</p>
<p>So if carb blockers, if they actually worked really well,</p>
<p>I mean, if you block something from being absorbed,</p>
<p>your GI typically does not just let undigested materials sit in there.</p>
<p>You get diarrhea.</p>
<p>I mean, that would be the outcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also how I debunk the whole 30 grams of protein at a meal.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t absorb any more than that.</p>
<p>If that was the case, when you ate a steak,</p>
<p>you would just start having diarrhea</p>
<p>every time you went over that 30-gram threshold, right?</p>
<p>I remember during college, so this would be early 90s,</p>
<p>there was the Olestra craze,</p>
<p>this idea of putting a non-digestible thing into things like potato chips</p>
<p>so that it would clear through the GI tract faster,</p>
<p>not absorb as many calories.</p>
<p>This went nowhere, obviously.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hear about this anymore.</p>
<p>But it does raise an interesting question related to energy balance,</p>
<p>which is gastric emptying time.</p>
<p>And obviously in the landscape of eating disorders,</p>
<p>in particular anorexia, abuse and abuse of laxatives</p>
<p>is a way in which people will, in an unhealthy way,</p>
<p>try and control their weight.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of problems with that approach.</p>
<p>But what about gastric emptying time?</p>
<p>Is this one way that people could control their energy balance in a healthy way?</p>
<p>And where does fiber come into play?</p>
<p>Fiber tends to improve GI transit time because it adds bulk.</p>
<p>Your GI system is basically a tube,</p>
<p>and it has peristalsis, which is wave-like contractions</p>
<p>that moves the food down through the tube.</p>
<p>Well, if you have more bulk to the food, like with fiber,</p>
<p>you can move it through a little bit better.</p>
<p>Now, in the gastric, the stomach specifically,</p>
<p>fiber tends to delay gastric emptying and slow it a bit,</p>
<p>probably because it congeals a little bit.</p>
<p>Now, this kind of gets into the glycemic index argument.</p>
<p>If you do low GI foods, you&rsquo;ll have a slower release of glucose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slower gastric emptying time.</p>
<p>Does that affect energy balance?</p>
<p>And so there are quite a few studies looking at low GI versus high GI foods.</p>
<p>In the studies where they don&rsquo;t control calories,</p>
<p>low GI tends to outperform high GI.</p>
<p>But when they control calories, there&rsquo;s no difference.</p>
<p>And so what I think that suggests is low GI foods,</p>
<p>just by their nature, tend to be higher in fiber.</p>
<p>And so I think it just kind of comes back to the fiber issue.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask you about supplements for a moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an enormous landscape,</p>
<p>but I believe there are a few things that you believe in,</p>
<p>meaning they exist and there are decent data to support their use,</p>
<p>maybe even some anecdotal data based on your own experience.</p>
<p>As long as we highlight it as such, it could be interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard you talk about two in particular,</p>
<p>one that I&rsquo;m very familiar with, which is creatine monohydrate.</p>
<p>If you could share your thoughts on that,</p>
<p>not just for muscle building, but maybe any other purposes for it.</p>
<p>And then the other one is one that, frankly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning more about all the time now thanks to your prompt,</p>
<p>which is Redolia Rosea.</p>
<p>I think I pronounced that correctly.</p>
<p>And why that might be interesting or of use to people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Touching on creatine, it is the most tested,</p>
<p>safe and effective sports supplement we have.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>there are thousands of studies on creatine monohydrate now.</p>
<p>And I would say very clearly too,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re using any other form of creatine,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re wasting your money.</p>
<p>Creatine hydrochloride has some hype around it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s apparently it&rsquo;s a little more soluble.</p>
<p>The claim is that you need less,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s only a couple of studies on it and it&rsquo;s more expensive.</p>
<p>And creatine monohydrate is not particularly expensive.</p>
<p>I realize people have different budgets, but it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t land in the, it&rsquo;s not a budget breaker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten more expensive because of COVID and supply chain issues.</p>
<p>Even the there&rsquo;s forms of creatine that appear to be as good like</p>
<p>hydrochloride, but it&rsquo;s more expensive.</p>
<p>And then things like creatine ethyl ester has been shown to be worse than</p>
<p>creatine monohydrate.</p>
<p>Buffered creatine is as good or worse.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s much more expensive.</p>
<p>So I tell people just take creatine monohydrate.</p>
<p>It is tried and true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been shown to saturate the muscle cells 100% with phosphocreatine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you want.</p>
<p>So creatine works through a few different methodologies.</p>
<p>One through increasing phosphocreatine content,</p>
<p>which helps improve exercise performance.</p>
<p>It also appears to improve in cover.</p>
<p>It appears to improve recovery and it increases lean mass.</p>
<p>A lot of which is through bringing water into the muscle cells,</p>
<p>but that is, I mean, muscle cells are mostly water.</p>
<p>So when people say, well, it&rsquo;s just water,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what muscle cells mostly are.</p>
<p>And it also increases strength and some other metrics.</p>
<p>Now it also has been shown in studies that people tend to get a decrease in</p>
<p>body fat percentage.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s probably because they&rsquo;re getting an increase in lean mass.</p>
<p>And so the relative is a decrease in body fat percentage,</p>
<p>but there are a few studies that show a decrease in fat mass as well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that creatine is a fat burner.</p>
<p>I think that people are able to train harder, build more lean tissue.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s probably having an effect on fat mass.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;ve actually shown more recently some cognitive benefits to creatine,</p>
<p>which I find really interesting as well,</p>
<p>but the only knock on creatine that anybody&rsquo;s been able to come up with,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve debunked the kidney stuff, they&rsquo;ve debunked the liver study.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence that it harms healthy kidney or liver.</p>
<p>Is hair loss.</p>
<p>So what about hair loss?</p>
<p>Because there was one study in 2009 that showed the creatine increased DHT,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t really show an effect on any other sex hormone.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of strange.</p>
<p>Like you would think if there was an increase in DHT,</p>
<p>there would be like something else that changes as well.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only one study.</p>
<p>And again, didn&rsquo;t directly measure hair loss, measured DHT,</p>
<p>which we know is involved in the loss of the follicle.</p>
<p>So what I would say is that I am not convinced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only one study, never been replicated to my knowledge,</p>
<p>and it was looking at a mechanism rather than an outcome.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s prone to hair loss</p>
<p>and you want to avoid creatine because of that, I understand.</p>
<p>But for most people, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s something to worry about.</p>
<p>Do you emphasize the classic loading of creatine,</p>
<p>taking it a bunch of times per day and then backing off</p>
<p>or just taking it consistently at the, I think, 5 grams per day</p>
<p>is kind of the typical dose that people take?</p>
<p>So again, no solutions, only trade-offs.</p>
<p>You can load it and you will saturate your phosphocreatine stores faster,</p>
<p>like usually within a week.</p>
<p>If you just take 5 grams per day, it&rsquo;ll take 2, 3, 4 weeks.</p>
<p>But you will get to the same place,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re probably going to have a much lower risk of GI issues.</p>
<p>Some people, creatine can be a gut irritant.</p>
<p>If it is for some folks, I would recommend splitting it into multiple doses,</p>
<p>so maybe like multiple to 1 or 2 gram doses per day.</p>
<p>And definitely don&rsquo;t load it if you&rsquo;re somebody who has GI issues from it.</p>
<p>As far as rhodiola rosea, the research is still in its infancy.</p>
<p>I was just reading a new systematic review</p>
<p>that kind of concluded that we need more high-quality research.</p>
<p>But the research that is out there seems to suggest</p>
<p>that not only does it reduce physical fatigue,</p>
<p>but it also reduces the perception of fatigue</p>
<p>and may also enhance memory and cognition as well.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s referred to as an adaptogen.</p>
<p>So I really like it.</p>
<p>My anecdotal experience is when I combine that with caffeine,</p>
<p>it tends to kind of smooth out the effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a more pleasant experience.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also some evidence that if you&rsquo;re like coming off caffeine,</p>
<p>that it can reduce the negative side effects to caffeine withdrawal,</p>
<p>which by the way, I didn&rsquo;t really believe in that</p>
<p>until I actually did a cold turkey.</p>
<p>So before I meet, I will cut out caffeine for 7 days</p>
<p>because you can basically reset your caffeine tolerance in 7 days.</p>
<p>And like 2 days in, I mean, I&rsquo;m groggy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the headaches.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get like body aches that come up because caffeine is actually a mild analgesic.</p>
<p>And yeah, so it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>But I slept like a baby, I&rsquo;ll tell you that.</p>
<p>And then you took caffeine prior to your event.</p>
<p>To the meat, yeah.</p>
<p>So you really want the maximum punch from it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and like I said, rhodiola tends to ‚Äì</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t eliminate those negative effects,</p>
<p>but it tends to dampen them a little bit.</p>
<p>So I really like it.</p>
<p>Again, would like to see more research on it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot more stuff coming out.</p>
<p>Like ashwagandha is another thing that looks pretty promising.</p>
<p>Seems to increase testosterone modestly.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s ‚Äì like they&rsquo;ve shown increases in lean mass.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the increase in testosterone explains the increase in lean mass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a big enough increase.</p>
<p>Could it be the decrease in cortisol?</p>
<p>People have talked about ‚Äì</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It does decrease stress, stress hormones.</p>
<p>It also has been shown to help with sleep.</p>
<p>But I would like to see more research looking at mechanistically</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s increasing lean mass before I kind of say conclusively</p>
<p>that this is the next creatine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more research that needs to come out.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s some other things that have an effect.</p>
<p>Citrulline malate, there was a new meta-analysis</p>
<p>that showed that citrulline malate can reduce fatigue</p>
<p>and increase I think time to fatigue.</p>
<p>It may actually have some small recovery benefits as well.</p>
<p>Different forms of carnitine can actually have recovery benefits</p>
<p>and actually interesting, I think it&rsquo;s carnitine tartrate</p>
<p>actually has been shown.</p>
<p>Volick published a study that actually showed</p>
<p>that it increased androgen receptor density in muscle cells.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>L-carnitine and its other forms are pretty ‚Äì</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s good evidence that they can improve sperm</p>
<p>and egg health for people who are looking to conceive.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There are surprising number of studies on this in humans.</p>
<p>But yeah, androgen receptor density.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from oral L-carnitine.</p>
<p>People are taking capsules, not injecting directly into a muscle.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got things like ‚Äì</p>
<p>obviously like the other most effective supplement out there</p>
<p>is probably caffeine.</p>
<p>I mean like if you look at the research studies,</p>
<p>caffeine produces very consistently improvements in performance.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t like the effect of caffeine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s OK but ‚Äì</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know because I&rsquo;ve never come off it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Well, interestingly, they do show that the effect appears to be consistent,</p>
<p>that even if you&rsquo;re a habitual caffeine user,</p>
<p>you do still get a benefit every time you take it.</p>
<p>But like you said, you&rsquo;re just used to it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s those things.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got things like beta-alanine, which for ‚Äì</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in our pre-workout.</p>
<p>Probably not super helpful for most people for resistance training.</p>
<p>It does seem to have some benefits for like high intensity.</p>
<p>Like if you get out more than like 45 seconds or 60 seconds</p>
<p>of like really hard training,</p>
<p>it does appear to help with delaying fatigue for that.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got things like betaine, also called trimethylglycine,</p>
<p>which there&rsquo;s some evidence it can improve lean mass.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evidence that it can improve power output.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a few things out there.</p>
<p>But most of the stuff is not very good.</p>
<p>So I think that that&rsquo;s ‚Äì those kinds of supplements, very useful.</p>
<p>But again, I would never tell people they need supplements.</p>
<p>Again, even like something like creatine is going to be a very small effect</p>
<p>compared to like proper nutrition, recovery, and hard training.</p>
<p>One of the things I was ‚Äì I was talking with Ben Bruno the other day</p>
<p>and I said, you know, like some people will ask me like,</p>
<p>how does this person make progress because their programming is not evidence-based</p>
<p>or this guy, how is he ‚Äì like his exercises are dumb.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, yeah, but they train really hard for 20 years.</p>
<p>Like one commonality you see between like really successful athletes</p>
<p>or bodybuilders is they train really hard.</p>
<p>One of the things I have observed is the more into the weeds people tend to get,</p>
<p>and again, this is just my own anecdote and observation.</p>
<p>The more in the weeds they tend to get, the less hard I see them train.</p>
<p>So one of the things I really like that Mike Israetel said,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got a PhD and is a bodybuilder himself.</p>
<p>He said you can&rsquo;t out-science hard training,</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re looking to build muscle</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking to improve your body composition,</p>
<p>that the main thing is just doing the work over time.</p>
<p>And I would add to that, and this is true of academic endeavors too, of course.</p>
<p>I think ‚Äì I hope you&rsquo;ll agree.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Which is that, yeah, you know, the other thing is given the mental side.</p>
<p>Earlier we were talking about how satiety signals in the brain</p>
<p>and what you think about foods can be relevant.</p>
<p>Learning to really enjoy training hard in addition to learning to really enjoy eating well,</p>
<p>not just for the effects that it has on body composition,</p>
<p>excuse me, those two, of course,</p>
<p>but just learning to really enjoy the process of training hard</p>
<p>and a really hard workout or a really hard paper that you have to sort through</p>
<p>or really digging through a book that&rsquo;s challenging.</p>
<p>Learning to really enjoy that I think is a ‚Äì</p>
<p>if there is a power tool out there, it&rsquo;s the psychological end.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of that is getting the confidence of doing something hard</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a payoff at the end.</p>
<p>A lot of people ‚Äì I get asked a lot in my Q&amp;As, how do I get more confident?</p>
<p>How do I become more confident?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell people you have to do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no hack.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t read about it.</p>
<p>You got to get in the arena.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean like compete in sports necessarily,</p>
<p>but like doing a PhD or doing something, just something hard</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re putting yourself out there and you&rsquo;re saying this is my goal</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to go for it.</p>
<p>You just learn so much by doing that about yourself.</p>
<p>And so just what you said, I will reframe things in my mind</p>
<p>when bad things happen from ‚Äì it&rsquo;s not to say I never get stressed out</p>
<p>because I do and it&rsquo;s not to say that I never get down because I do</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a human.</p>
<p>But when something bad happens ‚Äì I should post about this in my story today.</p>
<p>When something bad happens, I very rarely anymore do I go,</p>
<p>woe is me, why did this happen to me?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re in the universe, random bad things are going to happen.</p>
<p>So instead I say ‚Äì if I&rsquo;m not dead.</p>
<p>Instead I say, well, what an exciting opportunity to overcome an obstacle</p>
<p>and I bet because in the experience of my life, the biggest lessons</p>
<p>and the best things in my life have actually come out of the most challenging,</p>
<p>worst things that have happened.</p>
<p>And so again, this is ‚Äì I would never have been able to do these sorts of things</p>
<p>if I hadn&rsquo;t taken up weightlifting because weightlifting taught me so much</p>
<p>about perseverance, delayed gratification, overcoming obstacles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I love it even to this day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll still get butterflies when I go in for a squat session</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 23 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s clear that you embrace hard things.</p>
<p>And for people listening to this, obviously it doesn&rsquo;t have to be weightlifting,</p>
<p>picking hard things, learning an instrument, learning a language.</p>
<p>Challenge is an absolute builder.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve actually shown like those sorts of things,</p>
<p>like when you challenge yourself and also mentally that ‚Äì</p>
<p>I think there was a new study that came out basically showing a reduction</p>
<p>in the risk of Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>I mean basically like use it or lose it, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, the will ‚Äì the desire and the will to persevere no doubt</p>
<p>translates to this thing that we call the will to live, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to the will to live.</p>
<p>Well, I think that what you just said beautifully embodies</p>
<p>what most people are aspiring to, which is to ‚Äì</p>
<p>I think most people actually want to do hard things.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t just want to have the results.</p>
<p>I think that most people deep down have some understanding</p>
<p>that their reward system works that way.</p>
<p>I must say this conversation for me has been tremendously rewarding.</p>
<p>First of all, it allowed me to meet you in person for the first time,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed.</p>
<p>Again, this won&rsquo;t be our last interaction on this podcast and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Also, the amount of knowledge that you contain inside you is astonishing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff rattling around out there.</p>
<p>We all benefit because your ability to pull from the mechanistic side,</p>
<p>again, I think not limited to but relate to your background in biochemistry</p>
<p>all the way through to the impact in humans, animal studies,</p>
<p>being able to understand where those sit relative to one another.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re obviously a practitioner.</p>
<p>You practice what you preach.</p>
<p>What you talk about pertains to men, to women, younger people, older people,</p>
<p>people who are vegan, keto, carnivore.</p>
<p>You really are able to net a tremendous number of ideas</p>
<p>while staying really nuanced and data-driven.</p>
<p>So I just want to say for myself and on behalf of the listeners,</p>
<p>really appreciate you coming in here today and sharing with us your knowledge.</p>
<p>We will absolutely point people in the direction</p>
<p>of where they can learn more about you.</p>
<p>One of the places that I definitely want to mention before we part, however,</p>
<p>is this Carbon app.</p>
<p>I should just mention this isn&rsquo;t a paid promotion or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>Actually, one of our podcast team members has been using Carbon for a long time.</p>
<p>This is an app that you devised which allows people to navigate</p>
<p>the exercise, nutrition, energy balance space for weight loss,</p>
<p>muscle gain, fat loss, weight maintenance.</p>
<p>I would just like to briefly ask you about that before we conclude.</p>
<p>Without necessarily telling us everything that&rsquo;s in the Carbon app,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to know what are the major things that it does and is good for,</p>
<p>and then what were some of the key things that you wanted to make sure</p>
<p>were in there when you built it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the sort of logical backbone behind it?</p>
<p>Because I think there are a lot of food counting, calorie counting,</p>
<p>exercise apps out there.</p>
<p>Everyone I&rsquo;ve talked to that uses Carbon,</p>
<p>including our mutual friend Cigar and Getty,</p>
<p>this member of my podcast, etc., raves about it.</p>
<p>What is Carbon and what does it do,</p>
<p>and what was your mindset in building it?</p>
<p>What did you really want to see there that you didn&rsquo;t see elsewhere?</p>
<p>Those listening may not know, but I started online coaching people</p>
<p>for nutrition back in 2005.</p>
<p>That was the vast majority of my business all the way up until 2017.</p>
<p>I had a lot of success with that,</p>
<p>whether it be just average folks looking to lose weight or build muscle,</p>
<p>and right up to elite-level competitors in physique sport.</p>
<p>I kind of had this idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say I had the idea.</p>
<p>A few people had the idea.</p>
<p>I wanted to take what I do in coaching</p>
<p>and try to automate as much of that as possible.</p>
<p>By the time I was becoming a really popular coach, I was expensive.</p>
<p>You were looking at me charging.</p>
<p>I got to the point where I was charging about $1,000 a month for coaching.</p>
<p>Most people cannot afford that.</p>
<p>I would like to not just coach rich people.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I would like to be able to help other people.</p>
<p>The idea was to create an app that could do some of this stuff.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s always a place for human interaction,</p>
<p>but for people who can&rsquo;t afford that, our app is basically $10 a month.</p>
<p>Basically, what we wanted to do was set up an app</p>
<p>where think about if you went to a nutrition coach.</p>
<p>What would they do?</p>
<p>They would probably ask you some questions about your goals,</p>
<p>take some anthropometrics,</p>
<p>and then they would use that information, maybe dietary preference.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d use that information to formulate a baseline plan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Carbon does.</p>
<p>We ask you, I think there&rsquo;s eight questions in the sign-up flow,</p>
<p>about your activity, your exercise, your lifestyle,</p>
<p>your body weight, your body fat percentage.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know it, we help you calculate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s better than nothing.</p>
<p>Then your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>We use that to come up with your baseline.</p>
<p>Your baseline will be your calories, your protein, your carbohydrates, and fats.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s different about our app,</p>
<p>because apps like MyFitnessPal or whatever will do that as well,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s different about ours is we encourage people to log their weight daily</p>
<p>for the reasons that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Then you can also track your food in the app.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think our food tracker is actually way easier to use</p>
<p>than most of them out there.</p>
<p>What we typically get great, rave reviews about</p>
<p>is how user-friendly our interface is, that it makes intuitive sense.</p>
<p>So you track your food, try to hit these macros that you&rsquo;re prescribed,</p>
<p>and each week you will be prompted to check in with the coach</p>
<p>on your check-in day.</p>
<p>Then you put in some information, and then based on how you&rsquo;re progressing,</p>
<p>the app will adjust or not adjust based on how you&rsquo;re progressing.</p>
<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re hitting a weight loss plateau,</p>
<p>it will sense that, and it will reduce your calories.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re trying to gain weight and you hit a plateau,</p>
<p>it will increase your calories.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of back-end algorithm stuff that takes care of this,</p>
<p>but the fundamental crux of the app is we try to determine</p>
<p>your total daily energy expenditure,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to tell us the first big thing we need to know,</p>
<p>which is how many calories do you need to be eating for your goal, right?</p>
<p>So on the front end, we basically do our best guess</p>
<p>based on your anthropometrics.</p>
<p>Not going to be perfect, but it will get us in the ballpark.</p>
<p>And if you do know, like some people already know,</p>
<p>well, I know what I maintain my body weight on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually a spot where you can manually enter that</p>
<p>during the sign-up flow.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s helpful for people who are super nerds like me.</p>
<p>But then if you&rsquo;re just, people will ask,</p>
<p>well, do you take Apple Watch data?</p>
<p>Do you take this? Do you take that?</p>
<p>And no, for the reasons we talked about,</p>
<p>that it overestimates energy expenditure.</p>
<p>What our app does is it&rsquo;s an algebra equation.</p>
<p>If you, because your body weight, your maintenance calories</p>
<p>is your total daily energy expenditure.</p>
<p>Your average calories that you eat to maintain your body weight</p>
<p>will be the same as your total daily energy expenditure.</p>
<p>So if we know how body weight is changing</p>
<p>and we know how many calories the person&rsquo;s consuming,</p>
<p>we can actually solve for what energy expenditure is, right?</p>
<p>And you can see in the app that we&rsquo;ll,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of a maintenance calorie tracker</p>
<p>or energy expenditure tracker.</p>
<p>And typically after about three to four weeks,</p>
<p>even if the app was off at first,</p>
<p>it will have you pretty darn close.</p>
<p>Because, like let&rsquo;s say somebody comes on</p>
<p>and their goal is to lose, you know,</p>
<p>a pound and a half a week or something like that.</p>
<p>And the first week they lose three pounds.</p>
<p>Now the app actually accounts for the fact</p>
<p>that you can lose more water weight the first week,</p>
<p>so they probably wouldn&rsquo;t get an adjustment.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say the next week they lose three pounds.</p>
<p>The app will sense that and adjust their calories up</p>
<p>because it will be estimating that their energy expenditures</p>
<p>are actually higher than what it had previously estimated</p>
<p>based on the amount of weight they&rsquo;re losing.</p>
<p>And the same thing goes in reverse.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not losing the amount of weight</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re supposed to, it will lower them</p>
<p>based on the fact that it may have overestimated</p>
<p>their energy expenditure.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the first crux of it,</p>
<p>is tracking that energy expenditure.</p>
<p>And then the next thing is protein.</p>
<p>So when the backend algorithm stuff is happening,</p>
<p>calories are set first based on your energy expenditure</p>
<p>and your goal.</p>
<p>So for example, if you&rsquo;re on an aggressive diet,</p>
<p>your calories are going to be lower</p>
<p>even if your energy expenditure might be a little bit high.</p>
<p>Just because if you&rsquo;re trying to lose two pounds a week,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re going to be in a pretty aggressive calorie deficit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to set the calories first.</p>
<p>Then it will set protein based on your lean body mass.</p>
<p>Then the calories that are left over</p>
<p>will be allotted to carbohydrate and fat</p>
<p>depending on your dietary preference.</p>
<p>And we have a few different dietary preferences.</p>
<p>You have balanced, which is about 50-50 to 60-40</p>
<p>carbohydrate to fat of the remaining calories.</p>
<p>Then you have low fat,</p>
<p>which is obviously a higher ratio of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>You have low carb.</p>
<p>You have a ketogenic diet, which is very, very low carb.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also a plant-based option.</p>
<p>And within each of those options,</p>
<p>still you can go in and actually shimmy the macros</p>
<p>a little bit within a certain range</p>
<p>to kind of dial in what your specific dietary preference is.</p>
<p>Because again, if we go back to</p>
<p>what is going to produce the best long-term results,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s whatever the person can adhere to.</p>
<p>So we really try to start with the concept of adherence</p>
<p>by allowing people to have the dietary preference that they want.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some other apps out there that are good apps.</p>
<p>Like, for example, we get asked a lot,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between our app and the Renaissance Periodization app?</p>
<p>And they have a great app.</p>
<p>But theirs is kind of more rigid, and it&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to eat this many meals,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to have these foods at these times.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re kind of the opposite.</p>
<p>We want to give you maximum flexibility.</p>
<p>Now, for some people, they would prefer the rigid structure at first.</p>
<p>But we find that for most people,</p>
<p>giving them more flexibility</p>
<p>typically improves adherence over the long run.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of how the app works.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s multiple different goals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a weight loss app.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a maintenance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a muscle building.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got all kinds of different goals that can be accommodated,</p>
<p>different rates of each of those goals.</p>
<p>And, I mean, I&rsquo;ve used the app for over three years now to do my body weight.</p>
<p>And, I mean, like when I say that it&rsquo;s dialed me in</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m very regimented with logging and logging my weight.</p>
<p>So what I targeted to weigh in at Worlds,</p>
<p>I got down to the 0.1 kilogram.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty cool to be able to use a tool that I helped develop</p>
<p>to actually coach me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great tool.</p>
<p>We did some statistics.</p>
<p>We polled 2,500 members.</p>
<p>And one of the questions we asked is,</p>
<p>would you recommend this to a friend?</p>
<p>And 91% said yes.</p>
<p>So I think our average retention is like seven months,</p>
<p>which for an app that costs $10 a month is really great.</p>
<p>Yeah, as I mentioned, a number of people I know use it.</p>
<p>This is not a paid promotion.</p>
<p>But I think people need guidance and tools.</p>
<p>And what we know about the human brain is that winging it can work,</p>
<p>but that the brain will cheat itself often.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Feynman quote about this, and I&rsquo;ll get it wrong.</p>
<p>And always bad to try and quote Feynman anyway because he said it so much better.</p>
<p>But that we are the easiest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to fool ourselves, basically, is what he was saying.</p>
<p>Easiest to fool ourselves.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Sounds great.</p>
<p>We will put a link to it so that people can check it out.</p>
<p>Again, it sounds like a wonderful tool.</p>
<p>And a tool that nets a lot of the principles that sit as major themes for weight loss,</p>
<p>weight gain, I would assume directed lean muscle, lean tissue gain is what most people are after,</p>
<p>and weight maintenance because a number of people would like to just maintain.</p>
<p>Listen, I really appreciate your time and all that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Certainly your time and energy and knowledge today,</p>
<p>but also what you&rsquo;re doing on the various social media channels.</p>
<p>And just the fact that somebody from the depths of academia is out there sharing so much knowledge across so many domains.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a gem in this landscape of nutrition and one that people really need to hear from.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do it again.</p>
