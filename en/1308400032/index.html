    <p>Hi friends, so I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead and start this episode off with an apology</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sorry for how this episode is about to fuck your shit up okay you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna be the same after it your whole outlook&rsquo;s gonna change it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>hurt your feelings about 49 times and I&rsquo;m sorry about it these are all the</p>
<p>things I&rsquo;ve learned about missing someone something missing memories</p>
<p>missing a certain time in your life we&rsquo;re gonna get into all of it but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just about like missing something whether it&rsquo;s a person place thing noun</p>
<p>idea we&rsquo;re gonna get into each little area but I gotta tell you some things</p>
<p>about how to navigate it and just a lot of shit that&rsquo;s going on that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize so like I&rsquo;m unpack it all for you I am gonna be vulnerable in this</p>
<p>episode and I&rsquo;m gonna give you personal examples from shit that I&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>through and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you how I got through it okay so the first thing I</p>
<p>want to start off talking about is when you miss a person whether it&rsquo;s a friend</p>
<p>a sibling a partner a parent anything you miss like especially a goddamn ex I</p>
<p>guess the fucking worst thing it makes you want to fucking throw up like I feel</p>
<p>like a cat with a hairball like I don&rsquo;t want to fucking be dealing with that you</p>
<p>know so I&rsquo;ve only ever been in one relationship and y&rsquo;all know that and I</p>
<p>avoid talking about that shit because of how it ended it ended in court it ended</p>
<p>as bad as you could imagine a breakup going like the shit that fucking happened</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t even make up for a goddamn movie okay like one what happened in the</p>
<p>relationship you couldn&rsquo;t make up for a movie and then how it ended bitch oh my</p>
<p>fucking god like I don&rsquo;t even want to touch on it I don&rsquo;t even want to touch</p>
<p>that topic with a 10-foot pole like one day maybe when I write a book about my</p>
<p>fucking fucked up life I&rsquo;ll include it but I&rsquo;m gonna dodge that but I am gonna</p>
<p>talk about missing that motherfucker okay so this person did some of the</p>
<p>worst shit you can imagine to me and I need to point that out and I need to</p>
<p>like talk about that because it&rsquo;s very important and you&rsquo;re gonna get how I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>feeling and like what I&rsquo;m about to say so not too long ago I started to have</p>
<p>the feeling that I missed my ex and when I tell you I wanted to fucking rip my</p>
<p>soul out and light it on fire like you motherfucker how dare you make me miss</p>
<p>him you know but like it scared the shit out of me it scared the absolute shit</p>
<p>out of me that I missed this person like how could you hurt me this bad and I</p>
<p>miss you like I got so mad at myself and I got so frustrated with myself I was</p>
<p>like what the fuck how are you even considering this you know like I started</p>
<p>attacking the shit out of myself like how the fuck could you miss him and</p>
<p>honestly I got scared I was like no I don&rsquo;t want to miss him like I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to deal with this like everything that&rsquo;s about to come with this like it sent me</p>
<p>into a full-blown panic I was like I know I don&rsquo;t fucking miss you fuck you</p>
<p>like I was like trying to convince myself I didn&rsquo;t miss him and then I was</p>
<p>trying to tell myself I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if you do miss him shut up like I</p>
<p>was just like I was literally being so mean to myself and I was being so</p>
<p>dismissive because I was so fucking scared I did not want to miss him</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with that but after trying to fight it off</p>
<p>for like a week I finally sat down and was like you know what face it okay if</p>
<p>you feel like you miss him motherfucker I want a list then like I literally sat</p>
<p>myself down I was like make a list make a list I want to see what you missed</p>
<p>about him so bad write it out and I made myself write it out like I full-on made</p>
<p>myself write down every single thing I felt like I was missing about him and by</p>
<p>finally facing the fact that I felt like I missed my ex and like acknowledging it</p>
<p>and trying to understand it and going into it like I realized a lot of shit I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t ready for like I missed a lot more than I thought I did but after</p>
<p>looking at my list I realized everything on this list is just like shit that I</p>
<p>miss about having a partner and having someone to date like I know that sounds</p>
<p>so shitty but like it&rsquo;s the truth like I was so scared to acknowledge that I</p>
<p>missed him because of everything that came with it but after I made the list</p>
<p>and I got very clear of everything that I thought I missed about him I realized</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t miss shit about him I missed having a person and honestly that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>role that can be filled by any human being with a goddamn pulse like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry to say it and I&rsquo;m not dismissing the whole situation like it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>fucking small but I have not let myself get into another relationship but this</p>
<p>whole thing made me realize that I&rsquo;ve been neglecting myself of that for a</p>
<p>while and it&rsquo;s something that I would like to have again like I miss having a</p>
<p>person I really fucking do so deadass like make a list and full-on fucking look</p>
<p>at everything you think you miss about this person and then be like okay is</p>
<p>this something actually like special to the person or could like anybody do this</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s the voids that you miss being filled that used to be filled by</p>
<p>this person like you&rsquo;ll see very quickly the person&rsquo;s not shit and even if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like oh my god I was so close with them closeness if you break it down comes</p>
<p>from spending time with someone to feel close to someone you have to know them</p>
<p>you have to spend time with them that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not just like easily</p>
<p>replicated if you meet someone new so you might be like oh no I was close with</p>
<p>them that can&rsquo;t be replicated it can it just can&rsquo;t be replicated quickly you can</p>
<p>feel close with more people you can feel close with other people it just takes</p>
<p>time and that&rsquo;s something people don&rsquo;t understand about closeness and feeling</p>
<p>connected to people is it comes in those tiny little moments that nobody wants to</p>
<p>fucking do like all the little monotonous things you did together all</p>
<p>the time you spent together the little things that you went through together</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what brings you close to someone that&rsquo;s what makes you close with your</p>
<p>friends like if you look back at all the nights that you have with your friends</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the little moments where you were up late talking the little moments</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re outside of a club because it closed and you&rsquo;re like sitting on the</p>
<p>curb smoking a cigarette like you two just sitting there talking shit and</p>
<p>bonding like those are the nights that I remember with my best friend Genevieve</p>
<p>like when we would run away from the club when everybody was having a good</p>
<p>time me and her would take off and go get fucking food like and sit on the</p>
<p>curb and just eat it like those are the little bonding moments and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>you find closest with people like it&rsquo;s the tiny things that create closeness so</p>
<p>you might have felt close with this person that you miss but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that can be replicated it just takes time so you might look at like oh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna find that closest again you will it&rsquo;s not something you find</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that you build so once you realize that it&rsquo;ll help you kind of</p>
<p>detach off that motherfucker you feel like you missed so hard so another</p>
<p>dynamic of someone that you can miss as a friend and I swear to God that shit is</p>
<p>worse like thinking back to missing a friend like bro cuz like with the</p>
<p>relationship shit it&rsquo;s like you can convince yourself to move on and the</p>
<p>friendship thing you can do the same thing but it&rsquo;s a little bit harder but</p>
<p>the main point I want to get across is you can miss someone and still not go</p>
<p>back to them so just because you feel like you miss them so bad or anything</p>
<p>really like if you miss a person place or thing or whatever it is you can feel</p>
<p>that you miss them you can have it hurt that you miss them and still not choose</p>
<p>to go back so one thing I do is I allow myself to remember the good experiences</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like that was cute like I let myself think about the times that I feel like I</p>
<p>miss but I don&rsquo;t let myself say I miss this person because like with my ex</p>
<p>there are parts of the relationship and things that happen that I do miss and</p>
<p>that I do appreciate like there&rsquo;s certain parts that were just cute and</p>
<p>like great like that relationship was the best of the best and the worst of</p>
<p>the worst for me so there are moments where I&rsquo;m like oh my god I I really like</p>
<p>that experience or I miss this or I miss that but I do not let myself say I miss</p>
<p>him because in order to say I miss him that means I miss the entirety of him</p>
<p>which I fucking do not you can miss certain parts of someone or certain</p>
<p>things about someone but not miss others so don&rsquo;t say you miss a person say you</p>
<p>miss a memory or a feeling save that but these are just a couple things that I</p>
<p>keep in mind to help myself kind of sort out how I&rsquo;m feeling and what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking and it makes it easier you know because the last thing that you want to</p>
<p>do is make yourself convinced that that person is what you want like you left</p>
<p>for a reason it&rsquo;s over for a reason whether it&rsquo;s you outgrown a friend or</p>
<p>you outgrew a relationship or some shit happened or there was a betrayal or</p>
<p>whatever it was like you don&rsquo;t want your brain thinking of all these happy</p>
<p>memories to convince you to go back to them like don&rsquo;t do that it&rsquo;s okay to</p>
<p>miss certain things but do not say you miss the entirety of a person because I</p>
<p>guarantee you fucking don&rsquo;t so allow yourself to think of it think of the</p>
<p>times think of these chapters in your book like these are memories in your</p>
<p>life these are times that you&rsquo;ve had like they&rsquo;ve built you to who you are</p>
<p>like enjoy thinking about them they&rsquo;re fun don&rsquo;t force yourself to think of the</p>
<p>negative experiences to to cancel out the positive just allow yourself to</p>
<p>think about the good times and be like okay I&rsquo;m still not gonna go back I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still not gonna change anything just because of how I feel like if I know</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve outgrown a certain friend thinking about times that we had I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna go choose back into that friendship because I miss you for a</p>
<p>minute like once I come back to my senses once I come back logical I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna remember okay we aren&rsquo;t a fucking match anymore like just let yourself go</p>
<p>through the process of experiencing the good shit you know what I mean like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try to hold yourself back from that like yeah it sucks that it was that</p>
<p>with that person but just let yourself experience that little memory and then</p>
<p>keep your ass moving so the next thing I want to get into is another thing I had</p>
<p>a fucking almost breakdown about when I was like do I miss this place is the</p>
<p>place that I moved away from which was Pensacola so I moved to Houston I live</p>
<p>in Houston now I&rsquo;ve been here for like a month and a half but like a week ago I</p>
<p>started freaking out because I was like thinking about my friends that I had at</p>
<p>Pensacola and the things I used to do in Pensacola and like I started to miss it</p>
<p>and I was like no the fuck you don&rsquo;t like that aggravated side of me came out</p>
<p>again and I was like shut up I was like you don&rsquo;t fucking miss it you were</p>
<p>fucking miserable you want to kill yourself shut up like I was so mad at</p>
<p>myself that I thought that I missed this fucking place so I learned from the last</p>
<p>time with my ex look at what you think you miss before you say I miss this</p>
<p>thing so I didn&rsquo;t have to make a list this time like I just sat down and</p>
<p>thinking about Pensacola so I&rsquo;ve always emotionally felt alone but in Pensacola</p>
<p>with all the little friends that I had I didn&rsquo;t feel physically alone because I</p>
<p>knew I could call them at any moment and I could go be around people like as soon</p>
<p>as I want to call them and I have a couple people in Houston I can call but</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re always fucking busy or I&rsquo;m always fucking busy it just doesn&rsquo;t line</p>
<p>up but in Pensacola I had people that I could like go to if I wanted to be</p>
<p>around them you know I don&rsquo;t have that here so it&rsquo;s not Pensacola I miss it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not those specific friends I miss it&rsquo;s the fact that I don&rsquo;t feel like I have</p>
<p>people at my disposal for when I want to see them that&rsquo;s the feeling I miss and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to unpack a lot more shit because with going out like with going</p>
<p>out in Pensacola it didn&rsquo;t matter if I didn&rsquo;t have someone to go out with for</p>
<p>the night as I knew so many people around the town and around all the bars</p>
<p>and clubs and shit that I could go out alone and still run into people and have</p>
<p>a good fucking night like I felt a sense of like comfortability and like</p>
<p>familiarity with everything around like I was familiar with all the places I was</p>
<p>familiar with the people nothing was new nothing was unknown like it was all kind</p>
<p>of like a sense of security because I knew what to expect I knew where</p>
<p>everything was like I wasn&rsquo;t having to use my fucking GPS for everything like I</p>
<p>do here there was a sense of like familiarity and connectedness like not</p>
<p>even connectedness I don&rsquo;t know the fucking word it was like comfortability</p>
<p>like you I knew I was comfortable there was not really ever an unknown of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen so that&rsquo;s a feeling I kind of miss because like going out here I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fucking know nobody like I&rsquo;m confused and I&rsquo;m just like I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the bars look like I don&rsquo;t know the layout I don&rsquo;t know where everything is</p>
<p>like if I&rsquo;m drunk downtown I don&rsquo;t know how to navigate it like I know how to</p>
<p>navigate it in Pensacola I don&rsquo;t know how to navigate here and these are all</p>
<p>normal things that I&rsquo;m feeling because I moved to a whole new fucking place duh</p>
<p>but the whole reason I&rsquo;m bringing all that up is because the other night I was</p>
<p>sitting there and I was like I miss going out in Pensacola and as soon as I</p>
<p>thought that sentence I was like no the fuck you don&rsquo;t like I used to fucking</p>
<p>hate that place like it was a weird I loved it but I hated it but my memory</p>
<p>was just like making me remember all the best times I was like oh my god I miss</p>
<p>all the people I miss the bars like I was just like being a little fucking</p>
<p>whiny little sensitive bitch the other night but as soon as I thought that I</p>
<p>was like it doesn&rsquo;t make sense because I know I didn&rsquo;t like it when I was there</p>
<p>but my memory is like gaslighting me like if I think back to how I felt like</p>
<p>I never fucking liked going out there the bars were shit the people were mad</p>
<p>fucking weird once I realized it&rsquo;s the sense of familiarity and the</p>
<p>comfortability and the knowing people and then knowing where I&rsquo;m at that made</p>
<p>sense so I was okay that&rsquo;s what I miss and familiarity with the location of</p>
<p>Pensacola is something I also miss because here I don&rsquo;t fucking know where</p>
<p>shit is like I&rsquo;m slowly learning it like I know my route to the gym I know my</p>
<p>route to the tanning salon I know my route to the mall like but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking know shit else like I don&rsquo;t know really directions like I don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>pick up on shit and like I don&rsquo;t know and it kind of like makes me miss</p>
<p>knowing where I was going you know like that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s something I didn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>I would miss by moving but that&rsquo;s one thing like I&rsquo;ll gladly take moving here</p>
<p>over what the fuck I gave up like trust me I&rsquo;m so happy with my decision but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another point I want to get into is by feeling all these things and</p>
<p>thinking that I miss all these things if I miss label this shit and I tell myself</p>
<p>no I actually miss Pensacola it&rsquo;s gonna make me think I made the wrong decision</p>
<p>and want to go back and that&rsquo;s the opposite of what I&rsquo;m doing like I&rsquo;m too</p>
<p>aware to do some shit like that but my point is like if you mislabel something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll make you second-guess yourself so don&rsquo;t mislabel it like understand the</p>
<p>way you&rsquo;re feeling first because when I say I miss the familiarity like I had</p>
<p>spots in Pensacola where I would go to cry like I would go climb the scoreboard</p>
<p>at the baseball stadium and go up there and have a cigarette and I would talk to</p>
<p>myself and I would cry that was like my smoke spot I gotta go up there and like</p>
<p>counsel myself and I would have like a little meeting with me I would check in</p>
<p>with me cuz like I was real high up in the air no one could hear me no one</p>
<p>fucking knew I was up there it was overlooking the water it was real</p>
<p>fucking pretty like it was just my little spot I could run away to and I</p>
<p>loved it like I always love having little spots like that I also had a dock</p>
<p>like my friend had a dock and I could like go out on the dock and sit on the</p>
<p>water at night and just like be by myself and just have a new place to go</p>
<p>like I love little hideouts I love little spots like that and I had this</p>
<p>one church that I used to always go break into I mean visit and I would just</p>
<p>go there when I got like emotional or whatever like I had these spots I would</p>
<p>go to when I wasn&rsquo;t feeling like all that good and I just wanted to kind of</p>
<p>go explore be by myself or just I don&rsquo;t know like I just had little comfort</p>
<p>spots that I went to that weren&rsquo;t home and I miss not having that because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in Houston now I don&rsquo;t fucking know where to go I don&rsquo;t know where these</p>
<p>little spots are it&rsquo;s like I have to go find them but like I don&rsquo;t know where</p>
<p>the fuck to find them like it took me so long to find the spots of Pensacola</p>
<p>like you just have to come across them you know but a couple places in Houston</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to go like I&rsquo;ve tried to go to a parking garage and like I want to</p>
<p>go get on the roof like of a parking garage like the top at night and just</p>
<p>smoke a fucking cigarette and look out over the edge and look at all the city</p>
<p>lights and look at all this shit but I can&rsquo;t fucking find one like none of them</p>
<p>are open to the public and it&rsquo;s so fucking frustrating because like last</p>
<p>night all I wanted to do was go fucking cry like I just wanted to go and look at</p>
<p>all the lights of the city and just cry and be fucking dramatic and I kept</p>
<p>driving up the fucking parking garages and at the top level it would kept being</p>
<p>locked off and I also had to pay to get into the fucking parking garages which</p>
<p>is pissing me off like God forbid I want to go cry in peace it&rsquo;s gonna cost me</p>
<p>ten bucks and I can&rsquo;t go the rooftop like fuck but last night was another</p>
<p>moment where I&rsquo;m just like I miss the fucking spots I used to go to like I</p>
<p>miss my comfort spots because I don&rsquo;t have those here and it doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not gonna find them but I just don&rsquo;t have any readily accessible to me while</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m upset you know and also I miss Publix like grocery store oh my god like</p>
<p>HEB is cool Kroger is cool but like nothing beats fucking Publix bro like</p>
<p>Publix shits on everybody I&rsquo;m sorry there&rsquo;s just something about it like I</p>
<p>hate that it&rsquo;s green but there&rsquo;s just something about a Publix that like they</p>
<p>have everything you fucking need everything is nice it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the target of grocery stores Kroger is like ugly as fuck okay why am</p>
<p>I talking about grocery stores oh my god Leo get back to the fucking point</p>
<p>also another thing I miss is like having good restaurants I know where they&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>that I can go to when I&rsquo;m kind of like down so one thing I like to do when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>down is go eat like bitch I love to just go I don&rsquo;t eat out a lot but like when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad I&rsquo;m like fuck it I&rsquo;m gonna fucking eat and I&rsquo;ll like go take</p>
<p>myself a dinner and I don&rsquo;t know no place here and also like here you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just show up looking bum as fuck anywhere used to I would like go to a</p>
<p>nice restaurant and I would show up like in a wife beater and look like shit</p>
<p>and I would just tip like 50% on my bill so that like I&rsquo;m just like here like</p>
<p>you just leave me be like let me sit here and be ugly and I&rsquo;ll ruin the vibe</p>
<p>of the atmosphere but like I&rsquo;m just gonna tip you good okay so and I would</p>
<p>go somewhere in order like the most expensive shit on the menu so they would</p>
<p>just leave me alone but I don&rsquo;t know the places here to like do that like every</p>
<p>place in Houston like you gotta dress up bitch there&rsquo;s no like slum it like you</p>
<p>gotta fucking like dress cute all the time and I like that but like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know the places to go to that I want to have like comfort food you know like in</p>
<p>Pensacola like George Bistro was my motherfucking comfort place like I could</p>
<p>go there in some goddamn house shoes like a slipper and they would fucking</p>
<p>let me in because I knew everybody there everybody was cool but they had the best</p>
<p>fucking food and like it was it&rsquo;s like a little pricey for Pensacola but like I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t give a fuck like when I&rsquo;m sad I don&rsquo;t give a shit about anything like I</p>
<p>just want to eat but that was my comfort spot and I don&rsquo;t have one of</p>
<p>those here so like I was missing a little bit of comfort you know what I</p>
<p>mean like comfort spots to go shit to do but yeah I just started to miss a lot of</p>
<p>shit like I thought I was missing a lot of shit was the thing it&rsquo;s like I</p>
<p>thought I was missing a lot of things about Pensacola and as soon as I was</p>
<p>like did I make the right decision moving I was like absolutely not we</p>
<p>ain&rsquo;t even considering that like I went into what I was actually feeling and I</p>
<p>came to the realization of like I was missing the familiarity the</p>
<p>comfortability the sense of knowing where I&rsquo;m going the sense of knowing</p>
<p>people there&rsquo;s everything that I felt while I was there like it was the</p>
<p>feeling states that I missed not the location or the people so as soon as I</p>
<p>realized it was the feeling states that I was actually missing I felt so much</p>
<p>better I felt so much more relieved because I&rsquo;m like now I just have to look</p>
<p>for how I can create those feeling states here you know like that&rsquo;s all I</p>
<p>have to do now like it&rsquo;s real simple now but moving on into my last point the</p>
<p>last section I kind of want to talk about is missing a certain time in your</p>
<p>life or missing a certain memory so I can look back on a lot of times in my</p>
<p>life where I&rsquo;m like oh my god I missed that like while I was going through it I</p>
<p>was like you this is the worst fucking thing ever but now looking back I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>oh my god like I would kill for that like when I was going through a lot of</p>
<p>shit emotionally and like all the shit with my ex and he was like fucking my</p>
<p>life up I was going out on the weekends and getting like blackout fucked up</p>
<p>drunk rolling on Molly every other fucking weekend I just wanted to escape</p>
<p>my reality like all week I would work and I would get my fucking shit done and</p>
<p>then on the weekends I would just let myself completely like leave my reality</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to be in my head I didn&rsquo;t want to think thoughts I didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>do shit like I just wanted to fucking escape it you know what I mean so I gave</p>
<p>myself that I started thinking back of like oh my god I missed that and</p>
<p>logically I&rsquo;m like Leo you do not miss where you were when you were doing that</p>
<p>like you were trying to escape so hard because you hated how you felt so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually miss that time in your life so what feelings do you miss what I</p>
<p>realized that shocked the fuck out of me with what I actually missed about</p>
<p>that was it wasn&rsquo;t what I was feeling it was what I was not feeling that I missed</p>
<p>because back in that time I didn&rsquo;t feel the pressure that I feel now because now</p>
<p>I have shit to lose now I have so much more going for me that I have to behave</p>
<p>in a more constructed way and I have to be a lot more strategic like I&rsquo;m known</p>
<p>now like people recognize me I&rsquo;m seen I&rsquo;m recognized and I&rsquo;m not recognized</p>
<p>for like some little bullshit like I&rsquo;m not a fucking influencer like I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>full-on coach like I get people through their hardest times mentally so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a certain level of like respect that has to be upheld with that like sure I show</p>
<p>certain sides of my personality and I&rsquo;m goofy and I&rsquo;m whatever but you&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>catch me out somewhere like fucked up out of my mind I&rsquo;ll never do drugs in</p>
<p>public like showing that I&rsquo;m like fucked up like I will never do that now</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t give myself that freedom anymore because I hold myself to</p>
<p>a higher standard and really it&rsquo;s like the person I am now like I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>do that anymore really but looking back I missed not having this pressure you</p>
<p>know like I have such an important job and so much is reliant on that and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much responsibility and it&rsquo;s not even just my coaching business I have it&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>tik-tok my app I have so much to uphold now I have so much to work on I have so</p>
<p>much to do and also I didn&rsquo;t care about my job I had before like I didn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>job that I truly was emotionally invested in like I&rsquo;m so invested in my</p>
<p>coaching I love it so much I try so hard to do my best at it and like it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>big priority in my life that I will not let anything interfere with it like I</p>
<p>will not let anything fuck with it like I will not get fucked up if I know I</p>
<p>have a call the next day like I&rsquo;m not gonna let anything impact my mood that</p>
<p>will fuck with my ability to coach someone because the people that reach</p>
<p>out to me and the people that are trying to work with me are people that fucking</p>
<p>need me and I&rsquo;m not gonna let them down and that comes with a lot of pressure</p>
<p>like I chose that pressure I like this pressure but I kind of forgot what it</p>
<p>was like to not have that and thinking back to that time in my life where I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have that pressure it&rsquo;s not that I missed that time at all it&rsquo;s just I</p>
<p>remiss I missed that little bit of relief and it&rsquo;s like I was a lot more</p>
<p>carefree I had a lot less to take into consideration like I&rsquo;ve grown up</p>
<p>basically like I&rsquo;ve grown up and I have a lot that I&rsquo;m working on and I have a</p>
<p>lot that I care about and I have a lot that I want to do and that&rsquo;s just a lot</p>
<p>of responsibility and it&rsquo;s a lot of pressure so it signaled to me like I</p>
<p>need to have more times in my life where I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m under so</p>
<p>much pressure so that I don&rsquo;t have to sit here and like miss all these times</p>
<p>where I was like fucked up on the weekends not caring about shit you know</p>
<p>so I just kind of use like those feelings of like I miss something like I</p>
<p>say about feelings they&rsquo;re a messenger you feel the way that you do for a</p>
<p>reason so try to figure out why like the feeling of missing those days and those</p>
<p>times in my life like I look at it like it&rsquo;s a message of I need to have a break</p>
<p>from the amount of pressure that I put on myself I need to find a way to</p>
<p>healthily like let loose and have fun you know but then I also think about in</p>
<p>Pensacola I had a couple of friends that were very well established let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>put it that way they were like highly known and I used to get to party with</p>
<p>them we used to have fun we would let loose and it was all in the privacy of</p>
<p>our own home or we would go on a trip together we would all just have fun like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that group of people to go hang out with anymore and it&rsquo;s like now</p>
<p>I need that the most like I need a house where we can all just hang out and relax</p>
<p>and not have to worry about our image we don&rsquo;t have to worry about fucking</p>
<p>anything up we can all just go and have fun and let loose in the house you know</p>
<p>like I had that and now I don&rsquo;t have that I&rsquo;m just kind of like fuck cuz like</p>
<p>this is the time that I need it the most but that&rsquo;s just another thing that I</p>
<p>have been missing I guess I&rsquo;m just kind of venting this episode so yeah I&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>rambling about that shit but the whole thing with missing someone or missing</p>
<p>something or missing a certain time in your life I just want you to kind of do</p>
<p>what I did like how I explained in this episode just look at why you think you</p>
<p>miss this thing what feelings are you missing okay what pressures do you miss</p>
<p>not being under like just take a genuine curiosity if you feel like you miss</p>
<p>someone before you freak out because that&rsquo;s one thing I learned from</p>
<p>freaking the fuck out is like you gotta face it like don&rsquo;t get mad at yourself</p>
<p>for thinking you miss someone no matter how fucking bad they did you it might</p>
<p>not be them you miss and I promise you it&rsquo;s not like if you just question and</p>
<p>try to understand what you missed so much it&rsquo;s never them I just hope I can</p>
<p>prevent you from going through what I did which was that period of like ah</p>
<p>fuck like panic like no you don&rsquo;t miss them like I don&rsquo;t want you to go through</p>
<p>that so I&rsquo;m gonna leave it off there but if you made it this far in the</p>
