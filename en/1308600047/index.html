    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are talking about time perception.</p>
<p>Our perception of time is perhaps the most important factor</p>
<p>in how we gauge our life.</p>
<p>That is, whether or not we think we are being successful,</p>
<p>whether or not we are failing,</p>
<p>whether or not we live in fear,</p>
<p>whether or not we live in relation to things</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s positive.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that our perception of time</p>
<p>is directly linked to the neurochemical states</p>
<p>that control mood, stress, happiness, excitement,</p>
<p>and of course, it frames the way</p>
<p>in which we evaluate our past.</p>
<p>So whether or not we think of our past</p>
<p>as successful or unsuccessful, it frames our present,</p>
<p>whether or not we think we are on track or off track,</p>
<p>and it frames our sense of the future,</p>
<p>whether or not we think we have a bright future,</p>
<p>a dim future, or whether or not the future</p>
<p>is very uncertain or not.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk</p>
<p>about the science of time perception,</p>
<p>and we are going to talk about tools and protocols</p>
<p>that you can use that can enhance your ability</p>
<p>to dilate and contract time.</p>
<p>What do we mean by dilate and contract time?</p>
<p>We can control the speed at which we experience life.</p>
<p>We can slow things down,</p>
<p>or we can speed our experience of life up,</p>
<p>and we can do that in a very direct and dynamic way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not that hard</p>
<p>once you understand how time perception works.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to come away from today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>with a lot of new knowledge,</p>
<p>and certainly with many tools that you can try</p>
<p>in your daily life, whether or not that&rsquo;s work, sport,</p>
<p>relational, emotional, and so on.</p>
<p>Before we begin our discussion about time perception,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to answer some questions that I received</p>
<p>related to the episode on fasting</p>
<p>and time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen that episode,</p>
<p>this information should still be of use to you.</p>
<p>Time-restricted feeding involves eating</p>
<p>for a particular period of time in each 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fairly regular.</p>
<p>So this would be an eight-hour most often,</p>
<p>or a 10-hour block.</p>
<p>Some people do shorter feeding windows,</p>
<p>but regardless, that feeding window is supposed to fall</p>
<p>at more or less the same period within each 24-hour day.</p>
<p>This has a number of positive effects on gene expression</p>
<p>that regulate a number of positive effects</p>
<p>on the different tissues of the body.</p>
<p>And for some people, not all,</p>
<p>but for some people makes weight loss easier</p>
<p>because of the way that they are not eating</p>
<p>for large periods of each 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>In any event, one of the major questions I got</p>
<p>after that episode was, do supplements break a fast?</p>
<p>And during that episode,</p>
<p>I talked about what breaks a fast is highly contextual.</p>
<p>It basically boils down to whether or not</p>
<p>something you ingest, whether it be liquid or food,</p>
<p>increases your resting blood glucose,</p>
<p>how much it increases that resting blood glucose,</p>
<p>and how long that increase lasts.</p>
<p>So you can check out the episode</p>
<p>for more about what breaks a fast,</p>
<p>but to address this issue about supplements</p>
<p>and whether or not supplements in particular break a fast,</p>
<p>many of the questions were about Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is a sponsor of this podcast.</p>
<p>It is also a terrific supplement</p>
<p>that I had been taking for more than a decade</p>
<p>before this podcast launched,</p>
<p>and many people have been using</p>
<p>and continue to use Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Does Athletic Greens break a fast?</p>
<p>Well, that will somewhat depend on whether or not</p>
<p>your resting blood glucose tends to run high or low,</p>
<p>but for most people, including me,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve measured it,</p>
<p>ingesting Athletic Greens does not break a fast,</p>
<p>and if it happens to break a fast,</p>
<p>it would be a very transient break in fast.</p>
<p>So without knowing your resting blood glucose levels</p>
<p>on an individual basis,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way I can say for sure</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t break a fast,</p>
<p>but chances are it does not</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t contain much carbohydrate or sugar,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t tend to therefore pull you out</p>
<p>of the molecular milieu associated</p>
<p>with low blood glucose states.</p>
<p>The other question I get is whether or not</p>
<p>things like fish oil break a fast,</p>
<p>and once again, this will be contextual,</p>
<p>but because fish oil is a fat,</p>
<p>mainly essential fatty acids, in particular EPA and DHA,</p>
<p>those don&rsquo;t tend to raise blood glucose very much.</p>
<p>In my case, having measured</p>
<p>using a continuous glucose monitor,</p>
<p>my resting blood glucose,</p>
<p>fish oil does not in any way change</p>
<p>my resting blood glucose.</p>
<p>Chances are it won&rsquo;t do that for most people as well,</p>
<p>so does fish oil break a fast?</p>
<p>Chances are it does not,</p>
<p>and of course, people wanted to know</p>
<p>about pill-type supplements,</p>
<p>you know, caffeine and things that raise dopamine</p>
<p>and their vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>In general, if something doesn&rsquo;t contain sugar</p>
<p>or much carbohydrate of any kind,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to raise blood glucose very much.</p>
<p>Now, of course, protein can raise blood glucose,</p>
<p>and fat can too as well,</p>
<p>although to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>So again, this is all contextual,</p>
<p>but at least by the logic that I just spelled out,</p>
<p>athletic greens, fish oil,</p>
<p>and most forms of supplements,</p>
<p>provided they don&rsquo;t have any sugar or protein content,</p>
<p>should not, quote-unquote, break a fast.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day,</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome,</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain, to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs,</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages that allow you</p>
<p>to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve partnered with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about time perception.</p>
<p>And the most fundamental aspect of time perception</p>
<p>is something called entrainment.</p>
<p>Entrainment is the way in which your internal processes,</p>
<p>your biology and your psychology,</p>
<p>are linked to some external thing.</p>
<p>And the most basic form of entrainment</p>
<p>that we are all a slave to all year round</p>
<p>for our entire life are so-called circanual rhythms.</p>
<p>We have neurons, nerve cells in our eye,</p>
<p>in our brain, and in our body</p>
<p>that are marking off the passage of time</p>
<p>throughout the year,</p>
<p>literally a calendar system in your brain and body.</p>
<p>And the way this works is beautifully simple.</p>
<p>Light seen by your eyes inhibits,</p>
<p>meaning it reduces the amount of a hormone</p>
<p>released in your brain called melatonin.</p>
<p>Melatonin has two major functions.</p>
<p>One function is to make you sleepy at night,</p>
<p>and the other is to regulate</p>
<p>some of the other hormones of the body,</p>
<p>in particular testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>When we view light,</p>
<p>we reduce the amount of melatonin released.</p>
<p>In fact, if you wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>when melatonin typically is pretty high</p>
<p>in your brain and body,</p>
<p>and you flip on a bright light in the bathroom,</p>
<p>your melatonin levels crash down to almost zero</p>
<p>and stay there.</p>
<p>Light is a very powerful modulator of melatonin,</p>
<p>and light inhibits melatonin.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, depending on where you live,</p>
<p>day length varies.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>the amount of light from the sun</p>
<p>that is available to you varies.</p>
<p>So when days are long,</p>
<p>the amount of melatonin in your brain and body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released tends to be less.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less of it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s released for shorter amounts of time,</p>
<p>because light inhibits melatonin.</p>
<p>When days are very short,</p>
<p>the amount of melatonin that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>and the duration that that melatonin exists</p>
<p>in your brain and body tends to be much longer.</p>
<p>So melatonin correlates with day length.</p>
<p>And if we are viewing more light,</p>
<p>we have less melatonin, we view less light,</p>
<p>we have more melatonin.</p>
<p>You see different amounts of light each day,</p>
<p>but we have a process in our brain and body</p>
<p>that averages the amount of light that you&rsquo;re seeing,</p>
<p>both from artificial sources and from sunlight,</p>
<p>and measures that off.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so exquisitely precise</p>
<p>that for a given, say, eight-hour day in the spring,</p>
<p>because spring in the Northern Hemisphere or elsewhere,</p>
<p>you know, days are getting longer,</p>
<p>that means that the amount of melatonin</p>
<p>is getting progressively less and less,</p>
<p>and that signal is conveyed</p>
<p>to all the systems of your brain and body.</p>
<p>And this is why most people, not all,</p>
<p>but most people feel like they have more energy</p>
<p>in the spring.</p>
<p>Conversely, when you have an eight-hour day in the winter,</p>
<p>the amount of melatonin that corresponds</p>
<p>to that eight-hour day</p>
<p>is getting progressively greater and greater,</p>
<p>because why?</p>
<p>Days are getting shorter,</p>
<p>so melatonin is increasing from day to day to day.</p>
<p>Every cell and system of your body pays attention to this,</p>
<p>and as a consequence, most people, not all,</p>
<p>but most people feel they have a little less</p>
<p>or sometimes a lot less energy</p>
<p>and a slightly lower mood in the winter months.</p>
<p>Now, there are exceptions to this, of course,</p>
<p>but the melatonin signal is the way</p>
<p>in which your internal state, your mood,</p>
<p>your sense of energy, even your appetite is entrained,</p>
<p>is matched to some external event.</p>
<p>In this case, the event is the rotation</p>
<p>of the earth around the sun.</p>
<p>There are other forms of entrainment,</p>
<p>meaning the matching of your brain and body</p>
<p>to things that are happening in your external environment.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting example of this</p>
<p>was published last year by Perik et al.</p>
<p>in Cell Report, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,</p>
<p>showing that across the calendar year,</p>
<p>the amount of testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>that human beings make varies,</p>
<p>such that in longer days,</p>
<p>they tend to make more testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>than in shorter days,</p>
<p>and this was correlated with things like</p>
<p>desire to seek out romantic partners</p>
<p>or have romantic interactions with their existing partners,</p>
<p>even aggression, although not violent aggression,</p>
<p>but sense of kind of willingness to argue</p>
<p>and to get into kind of combative states</p>
<p>and overall energy and mood.</p>
<p>This is something that had been hypothesized</p>
<p>for a long time,</p>
<p>but it had never really been cleanly demonstrated,</p>
<p>and what they showed was that it&rsquo;s actually the skin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s taking information about the amount of light</p>
<p>and converting it into these increases</p>
<p>in testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>Light exposure to the skin,</p>
<p>turns out about two hours a day,</p>
<p>this was sunlight in this case, to the upper body.</p>
<p>These people weren&rsquo;t naked.</p>
<p>They were wearing clothes, but their arms were exposed.</p>
<p>Their upper back and neck and face were exposed.</p>
<p>They were not wearing hats.</p>
<p>Resulted in large increases,</p>
<p>significant increases in testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>Now you could probably export a tool from that if you liked.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really what this podcast is about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very clear that because the skin is acting</p>
<p>as an endocrine organ, excuse me,</p>
<p>as kind of a hormone influencing organ,</p>
<p>that getting light on the skin, not just to the eyes,</p>
<p>can influence our sense of wellbeing</p>
<p>by these hormone pathways.</p>
<p>And the threshold there, again,</p>
<p>seemed to be about two hours a day.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be very bright outside.</p>
<p>There can be cloud cover and so on.</p>
<p>Many people will probably ask,</p>
<p>will sunscreen inhibit this effect?</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t appear that it does.</p>
<p>Obviously prioritize skin health and avoiding skin cancer.</p>
<p>Sunscreen is kind of a controversial topic nowadays.</p>
<p>Maybe the topic for another podcast episode at some point.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, what the Periketol study shows,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s most relevant to today&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>is that we are entrained,</p>
<p>we are matched to the external light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>And as the day length changes, our hormones change.</p>
<p>And we can override that with exposure to bright lights.</p>
<p>You know, people go sit on tanning beds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a practice I particularly myself engage in,</p>
<p>but you know, there are a number of different ways</p>
<p>that people can override these processes.</p>
<p>But the point is very simple.</p>
<p>The point is that our perception of time is both conscious,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s waiting, watching the clock tick down,</p>
<p>and there are these slower, what we call oscillatory,</p>
<p>meaning up and down repeatedly,</p>
<p>slower oscillatory events related to day length</p>
<p>that are influencing our hormones,</p>
<p>like melatonin, testosterone, and estrogen,</p>
<p>and therefore our mood, our outlook, and even our behavior.</p>
<p>The next level of time, or bin of time, as we say,</p>
<p>that we are all entrained or matched to</p>
<p>is the so-called circadian time cycle,</p>
<p>which is 24-hour rhythm.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most powerful rhythm</p>
<p>that we all contain and that none of us can escape from.</p>
<p>We all have this circadian clock</p>
<p>that resides over the roof of our mouth.</p>
<p>The cells in that circadian clock fire,</p>
<p>meaning they release chemicals into our brain and body</p>
<p>on a very regular rhythm.</p>
<p>So across the 24-hour cycle,</p>
<p>they will be very active at some periods</p>
<p>and less active at others.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there are periods of every 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>when we are very active and we tend to be alert,</p>
<p>and others when we are asleep.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about circadian rhythms and sleep</p>
<p>on this podcast previously,</p>
<p>and so I don&rsquo;t want to repeat too much</p>
<p>of that information in detail,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just going to give a summary</p>
<p>of how circadian entrainment works,</p>
<p>because I haven&rsquo;t really covered that</p>
<p>in the context of time perception.</p>
<p>We have the circadian clock.</p>
<p>It oscillates, it goes up and down</p>
<p>once every 24 hours and then repeats.</p>
<p>Every cell of our body has a 24-hour oscillation</p>
<p>in the expression of various genes.</p>
<p>How that works is actually really simple,</p>
<p>elegant, and interesting.</p>
<p>DNA genes make RNA.</p>
<p>RNA is converted into proteins.</p>
<p>Every cell in our body has this beautiful 24-hour timer</p>
<p>where a gene is expressed,</p>
<p>and the important thing to understand</p>
<p>about a given gene in this context</p>
<p>is that that gene is inhibited,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s reduced by a particular protein,</p>
<p>by a little biological molecule in that cell.</p>
<p>So the gene gets expressed</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s very little of that other molecule around.</p>
<p>DNA then becomes RNA.</p>
<p>RNA is translated into a protein,</p>
<p>and that protein goes way, way up, and the gene shuts down.</p>
<p>But as that protein gets used up</p>
<p>and its levels eventually drop low, low, low, low, low</p>
<p>to zero, the gene cycle kicks in again,</p>
<p>and the gene gets expressed,</p>
<p>the RNA gets expressed, and the protein again.</p>
<p>This all happens on a 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little built-in timer</p>
<p>in each and every one of our cells.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t list off the genes,</p>
<p>but for the aficionados out there,</p>
<p>they go by names like PER for period, BMAL, clock,</p>
<p>and all these different things,</p>
<p>we call them the clock genes.</p>
<p>And those clock genes regulate</p>
<p>a number of different functions.</p>
<p>So every cell in our body has a 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>of gene and protein expression,</p>
<p>and the earth rotates once every 24 hours,</p>
<p>and the processes that are happening</p>
<p>in every cell of our body are linked.</p>
<p>They are entrained, as we say,</p>
<p>to the outside light-dark cycle</p>
<p>because morning sunlight, evening sunlight,</p>
<p>and the lack of light in the middle of the night</p>
<p>make sure that the changes,</p>
<p>these oscillations that are occurring</p>
<p>within the cells of our brain and body</p>
<p>are matched to the outside light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>And I want to go into all the details of how that happens,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some very simple tools</p>
<p>that one can use to ensure that your entrainment,</p>
<p>your circadian entrainment, is precise.</p>
<p>And I cannot emphasize enough how important it is</p>
<p>that your circadian entrainment be precise.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because disruptions in circadian entrainment</p>
<p>cause huge health problems.</p>
<p>They increase cancer risk.</p>
<p>They increase obesity.</p>
<p>They increase mental health issues.</p>
<p>They decrease wound healing.</p>
<p>They decrease physical and mental performance.</p>
<p>They disrupt hormones.</p>
<p>You want your cells to be linked</p>
<p>to the circadian cycle that&rsquo;s outside you,</p>
<p>and the circadian cycle outside you</p>
<p>mainly consists of when there&rsquo;s sunlight</p>
<p>and when there is not.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the simple protocols</p>
<p>to fall out of this whole discussion</p>
<p>about circadian entrainment are the following.</p>
<p>View 10 to 30 minutes of bright light,</p>
<p>ideally sunlight, within an hour of waking,</p>
<p>assuming that you&rsquo;re waking early in the day,</p>
<p>especially you wake up early in the day,</p>
<p>get outside, see sunlight.</p>
<p>Do that again in the afternoon or around evening,</p>
<p>10 to 30 minutes, depending on how bright it is outside.</p>
<p>Artificial lights throughout the day,</p>
<p>or if you want to be awake and you wake up early</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no sunlight outside,</p>
<p>you can, of course, turn on artificial lights</p>
<p>if you want to be awake,</p>
<p>but basically you want as much bright light,</p>
<p>ideally from sunlight,</p>
<p>coming in through your eyes throughout the day.</p>
<p>And then in the evening,</p>
<p>you want as little bright light coming in through your eyes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this over and over and over again on this podcast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a lot of negotiations,</p>
<p>but I want to make a few things clear.</p>
<p>Try not to wear sunglasses if you can do it safely.</p>
<p>Fine to wear eyeglasses or contacts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to be a problem.</p>
<p>The light viewing that you do</p>
<p>and the avoidance of light at night</p>
<p>set the fundamental layer of your time perception.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to disrupt your perception of time</p>
<p>in the ways that we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>in the subsequent portions of the podcast</p>
<p>is to disrupt your circadian clock.</p>
<p>And that is not a good thing</p>
<p>for a number of different reasons.</p>
<p>There are other ways to so-called</p>
<p>entrain your circadian clock.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to do that</p>
<p>is to engage in physical activity</p>
<p>at fairly regular times of day.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do it every day,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re going to exercise,</p>
<p>try and exercise at a fairly consistent time of day.</p>
<p>Probably better to exercise than to not exercise,</p>
<p>even if you have to move that time of day.</p>
<p>But light activity,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about the third in a minute, food,</p>
<p>are the major ways that you entrain</p>
<p>your internal perception of time</p>
<p>to the external events of the world,</p>
<p>meaning that the turning of the earth</p>
<p>and therefore the exposure to sunlight or not.</p>
<p>So in addition to the sunlight</p>
<p>viewing in the morning and throughout the day</p>
<p>and avoiding bright light at night of any kind,</p>
<p>not just blue light,</p>
<p>trying to get your activity,</p>
<p>your exercise at fairly regular</p>
<p>within plus or minus two hours</p>
<p>from each day to the next</p>
<p>is going to have a very positive effect</p>
<p>on so-called circadian entrainment.</p>
<p>And also eating at fairly regular times.</p>
<p>However, this is exciting.</p>
<p>The data mainly point to the fact</p>
<p>that you need to eat</p>
<p>within more or less the same time window each day,</p>
<p>not that you always need to eat your meals</p>
<p>at exactly the same time.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to eat lunch at noon</p>
<p>and a snack at four and dinner at eight</p>
<p>in order to keep your circadian entrainment aligned</p>
<p>or sharp.</p>
<p>You could, for instance, have a small snack at noon</p>
<p>and then eat at two and then have dinner at six</p>
<p>and then a small snack at eight.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t so much matter when the exact meals fall,</p>
<p>so much as that they fall more or less</p>
<p>within a consistent period or phase of each 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>What happens when this circadian clock</p>
<p>starts getting disrupted?</p>
<p>I mean, this is after all an episode about time perception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an episode about circadian rhythms and entrainment.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a classic study by Ashoff done in 1985</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now been repeated many times</p>
<p>where they had people go into environments</p>
<p>where they didn&rsquo;t have clocks and they didn&rsquo;t have windows</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t have watches.</p>
<p>And they were sometimes even in constant dark</p>
<p>or constant light.</p>
<p>And they evaluated how well people perceive</p>
<p>the passage of time on shorter timescales.</p>
<p>And what they found was really interesting.</p>
<p>What they found is that people underestimate</p>
<p>how long they were in these isolated environments.</p>
<p>So after 42 days or so, they&rsquo;d ask people,</p>
<p>how long do you think you&rsquo;ve been in here?</p>
<p>And people would say 28 days or 36 days.</p>
<p>They generally underestimated how long they had been</p>
<p>in this very odd environment with no clocks or watches</p>
<p>or exposure to sunlight or regular rhythms</p>
<p>of artificial light.</p>
<p>In addition, they found that their perception</p>
<p>of shorter time intervals was also really disrupted.</p>
<p>So if they asked them to measure off two minutes,</p>
<p>normally people are pretty good at measuring off two minutes.</p>
<p>People come within five to 15 seconds at most.</p>
<p>If you kind of had to sit there and just wait,</p>
<p>you have a pretty good idea of when two minutes is up.</p>
<p>You say two minutes is up.</p>
<p>Well, when people circadian clocks</p>
<p>or circadian entrainment, I should say, was disrupted,</p>
<p>their perception of time measurement on shorter timescales</p>
<p>of minutes or even seconds was greatly disrupted.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll see in a couple of minutes,</p>
<p>that actually causes great problems</p>
<p>for how you contend with work,</p>
<p>how you contend with challenges of different kinds.</p>
<p>You want your circadian entrainment to be pretty locked in</p>
<p>or pretty entrained to the outside light-dark cycle</p>
<p>so that your perception of time</p>
<p>on shorter time intervals can be precise</p>
<p>because the ability to perceive time accurately</p>
<p>for the given task or given thing that you&rsquo;re involved in</p>
<p>turns out to be one of the most fundamental ways</p>
<p>that predicts how well or poorly</p>
<p>you perform that thing or task.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about circanual entrainment,</p>
<p>the matching of the cells and tissues</p>
<p>and organs of our body to the 365-day journey</p>
<p>that the earth takes around the sun each year.</p>
<p>And we talked about circadian entrainment,</p>
<p>the way that the 24-hour genetic and protein clocks</p>
<p>of each and every one of our cells</p>
<p>is matched to the rotation of the earth on its axis</p>
<p>and the exposure or lack of exposure to the sun</p>
<p>because of that rotation on its axis.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;d like to talk about so-called ultradian entrainment.</p>
<p>Ultradian rhythms are rhythms of about 90 minutes or so,</p>
<p>and all of our existence is broken up</p>
<p>into these 90-minute ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>When you go to sleep at night,</p>
<p>whether or not you sleep six hours or four hours</p>
<p>or eight hours or 10 hours,</p>
<p>that entire period of sleep is broken up</p>
<p>into these 90-minute ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>Early in the night, you tend to have more slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>Later in the night, you tend to have more REM sleep,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, your sleep is broken up</p>
<p>into these 90-minute cycles.</p>
<p>However, when you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>many of the things that you do</p>
<p>are governed by these ultradian rhythms.</p>
<p>For instance, if you were to work,</p>
<p>meaning do math or try and learn a language</p>
<p>or do physical work of any kind or work out,</p>
<p>the 90-minute time block seems to be the one</p>
<p>in which the brain can enter a state of focus and alertness</p>
<p>and do hard work and focus, focus, focus,</p>
<p>and then at about 90 minutes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a significant drop in your ability to engage</p>
<p>in this mental or physical work.</p>
<p>Now, everybody from the self-help literature</p>
<p>to the business literature to the pop psychology literature</p>
<p>has tried to leverage these ultradian cycles</p>
<p>by saying, if you&rsquo;re going to do something hard</p>
<p>and you want to focus on it, limit it to 90 minutes or less.</p>
<p>And I am one of those people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also joined that conversation.</p>
<p>And indeed, I use 90-minute work cycles,</p>
<p>and I think they are extremely powerful.</p>
<p>One should never expect that you&rsquo;re going to drop</p>
<p>immediately into a state of high focus at the beginning</p>
<p>and then remain there for 90 minutes.</p>
<p>We all struggle to varying degrees to achieve focus</p>
<p>and motivation and drive within those 90-minute cycles.</p>
<p>But it is true, meaning there is ample literature</p>
<p>to support the idea that after about 90 minutes,</p>
<p>we tend to go into a state of less ability to focus.</p>
<p>So while this isn&rsquo;t time perception per se,</p>
<p>it is again, an example of entrainment.</p>
<p>What are we entraining to, right?</p>
<p>Just because we can focus for 90 minutes</p>
<p>and then not so well at 100 minutes or 120 minutes,</p>
<p>what are we entraining to?</p>
<p>Well, what you&rsquo;re entraining to</p>
<p>is the release of particular neurochemicals,</p>
<p>in this case, acetylcholine and dopamine,</p>
<p>that allow your brain to focus</p>
<p>for particular periods of time, 90 minutes or so.</p>
<p>And after about 90 minutes or so,</p>
<p>the amount of those chemicals that can be released</p>
<p>tends to drop very low,</p>
<p>which is why your ability to focus becomes diminished.</p>
<p>If one would like to explore more</p>
<p>about the kind of backbone and basis</p>
<p>of these alternating rhythms,</p>
<p>it goes by a different name.</p>
<p>This was originally called the basic rest activity cycle.</p>
<p>This was proposed many years ago by Nathaniel Kleitman.</p>
<p>It was established to be true within sleep states,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before.</p>
<p>Then it was debated for a long time</p>
<p>whether or not these 90-minute cycles</p>
<p>also control our ability to focus</p>
<p>and perform work in wakeful states.</p>
<p>And it turns out that they do.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot of literature to support that.</p>
<p>I always get the question,</p>
<p>how do you know when the 90-minute cycle begins?</p>
<p>In other words, let&rsquo;s say you wake up at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>and you just finished a 90-minute sleep cycle.</p>
<p>Does that mean that your next 90-minute cycle</p>
<p>where you could do work begins right at 8.01?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about these basic rest activity cycles,</p>
<p>these alternating rhythms,</p>
<p>is that you can initiate them whenever you want.</p>
<p>This is not like a circadian rhythm,</p>
<p>which is a hardwired, unerring signal of 24 hours.</p>
<p>The alternating rhythms that occur during sleep</p>
<p>are hardwired, unerring.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get the option of making your sleep cycles</p>
<p>at 120 minutes or five minutes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get that option.</p>
<p>But if you decide that you want to apply</p>
<p>alternating rhythms to work and performance,</p>
<p>you can set a clock and decide,</p>
<p>okay, now the focus begins.</p>
<p>Now the work begins.</p>
<p>And this 90-minute cycle</p>
<p>is the period in which I&rsquo;m going to do work.</p>
<p>And I actually do this.</p>
<p>I, you know, mid-morning and sometimes twice a day,</p>
<p>I do a 90-minute cycle where I limit</p>
<p>all distraction as much as possible,</p>
<p>put away my phone, often turn off the internet as well.</p>
<p>I talked about this in an episode</p>
<p>on kind of an optimal workday, at least for me,</p>
<p>just to give an example of how this might work.</p>
<p>But I want to emphasize again</p>
<p>that these alternating rhythms are ones that you set.</p>
<p>So you decide I&rsquo;m going to work for 90 minutes.</p>
<p>What you can&rsquo;t negotiate, however,</p>
<p>is that at about 100 minutes or 120 minutes,</p>
<p>no matter who you are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see a diminishment in performance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to focus as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s again, because of the way</p>
<p>that these 90-minute cycles are linked</p>
<p>to the ability of the neurons</p>
<p>that release acetylcholine and dopamine,</p>
<p>and to some extent, norepinephrine,</p>
<p>the things that give us narrow focus, motivation, and drive.</p>
<p>The way that these 90-minute cycles</p>
<p>are involved in those circuits.</p>
<p>After about 90 minutes,</p>
<p>those circuits are far less willing to engage,</p>
<p>and therefore it&rsquo;s much harder</p>
<p>to continue to focus to a high degree.</p>
<p>Some people like to do multiple 90-minute cycles</p>
<p>per day of focus.</p>
<p>In that case, you need to separate them out.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do one 90-minute cycle,</p>
<p>then go right into another 90-minute cycle,</p>
<p>then another 90-minute cycle.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t cheat these circuits</p>
<p>related to acetylcholine and dopamine</p>
<p>and norepinephrine, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I suggest that people do no more than three,</p>
<p>and ideally it would be two</p>
<p>or just one of these 90-minute cycles.</p>
<p>Why did I say ideally?</p>
<p>Well, they are very taxing.</p>
<p>You are in a very narrow tunnel of focus.</p>
<p>So for me, I can do one mid-morning.</p>
<p>I can probably do another one in the afternoon.</p>
<p>This is not the kind of work that&rsquo;s like checking email</p>
<p>or text messaging or social media.</p>
<p>This is very focused, hard work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s working on hard problems of various kinds,</p>
<p>and this will be different for everybody.</p>
<p>So I recommend that they be spaced</p>
<p>by at least two to four hours,</p>
<p>and most people probably won&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to handle more than two per day.</p>
<p>There are probably some mutants out there</p>
<p>that could do three or four, but that&rsquo;s exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>I think even one a day is going to feel</p>
<p>like a significant mental investment,</p>
<p>and afterwards you&rsquo;re going to feel pretty taxed.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve talked about circanual, circadian,</p>
<p>and ultradian rhythms,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t really talked about time perception per se.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mainly talked about the subconscious,</p>
<p>slow, oscillatory ways in which we are entrained</p>
<p>or matched to the year or to the day,</p>
<p>and these ultradian cycles</p>
<p>that we can impose on our work</p>
<p>and that we can leverage toward more focus if we like.</p>
<p>But what about the actual perception of time?</p>
<p>What actually controls how fast</p>
<p>or how slowly we perceive time going by?</p>
<p>There are basically three forms of time perception</p>
<p>that we should all be aware of.</p>
<p>One is our perception of the passage of time in the present,</p>
<p>how quickly or slowly things seem to be happening for us.</p>
<p>This is kind of like an interval timer,</p>
<p>ticking off time, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either fine slicing like that or tick,</p>
<p>tick, tick.</p>
<p>We have interval timers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll discuss the basis of those interval timers.</p>
<p>We also engage in what&rsquo;s called prospective timing,</p>
<p>which is like a stopwatch,</p>
<p>measuring off things as they go forward.</p>
<p>That might sound a little bit like what I just described,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually a little bit different.</p>
<p>For instance, if I told you to start measuring off</p>
<p>a two-minute time interval into the future,</p>
<p>you could do that pretty well.</p>
<p>But if I told you you had to measure</p>
<p>a five-minute time interval into the future</p>
<p>and you couldn&rsquo;t use any clocks or watches or your phone</p>
<p>or anything like that,</p>
<p>you would have to set the tick marks.</p>
<p>You would have to decide how many times</p>
<p>you were going to count off</p>
<p>during that five-minute time block.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also retrospective time,</p>
<p>which is how you measure off time in the past.</p>
<p>So if I say, you know, last week,</p>
<p>I know you went to the park,</p>
<p>you did some things with friends,</p>
<p>you know, you went out in the evening.</p>
<p>How long was it between lunch</p>
<p>and when you went to dinner with friends?</p>
<p>You probably think, okay, well,</p>
<p>I remember I went to dinner at seven</p>
<p>and we had lunch right around two.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using memory to reconstruct</p>
<p>certain sets of events in the past</p>
<p>and get a sense of their relative positioning within time.</p>
<p>Okay, so we have retrospective,</p>
<p>current time interval measurements,</p>
<p>and then a prospective time measurement into the future.</p>
<p>The beauty of time perception in the human nervous system</p>
<p>is that it boils down to a couple of simple molecules</p>
<p>that govern whether or not we are fine slicing time</p>
<p>or whether or not we are batching time in larger bins.</p>
<p>Those molecules go by names that maybe you&rsquo;ve heard,</p>
<p>things like dopamine and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>neuromodulators, called neuromodulators</p>
<p>because they modulate,</p>
<p>they change the way that other neural circuits work.</p>
<p>Also things like serotonin.</p>
<p>Serotonin is released from a different site in the brain</p>
<p>than dopamine and norepinephrine is</p>
<p>and has a different effect on time perception.</p>
<p>So just to give you an example</p>
<p>of how things like dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>can modulate our perception of time,</p>
<p>I want to focus on a little bit of literature</p>
<p>that now has been done fortunately in animals and humans,</p>
<p>and which essentially shows that the more dopamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released into our brain,</p>
<p>the more we tend to overestimate</p>
<p>the amount of time that has just passed.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that.</p>
<p>The more dopamine that is released into our brain,</p>
<p>the more we tend to overestimate how much time has passed.</p>
<p>These experiments are very straightforward, excuse me,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very objective, which is really nice,</p>
<p>which is you can give people or an animal a drug</p>
<p>that increases the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>and then ask them to measure off</p>
<p>without any measurement device like a watch or a clock</p>
<p>when one minute has passed.</p>
<p>As dopamine levels will rise in the brain,</p>
<p>people tend to think that the minute is up before a minute.</p>
<p>So at the 38 second mark, they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>okay, I think a minute is up.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve overestimated how much time has passed, okay?</p>
<p>The higher the level of dopamine,</p>
<p>the more people tend to overestimate.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s also true that norepinephrine,</p>
<p>also called noradrenaline, plays a role</p>
<p>and its role is very similar to that of dopamine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because norepinephrine and dopamine</p>
<p>are close cousins.</p>
<p>As some of you may recall,</p>
<p>that they are actually manufactured from one another, okay?</p>
<p>So dopamine can actually make epinephrine</p>
<p>and norepinephrine biochemically.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cascade in which dopamine can be made</p>
<p>into norepinephrine and epinephrine, which is remarkable.</p>
<p>How does having elevated levels of dopamine</p>
<p>and norepinephrine cause one to overestimate</p>
<p>how much time has passed?</p>
<p>Well, it does it because of the way</p>
<p>that it causes fine slicing of your time bins.</p>
<p>So fine slicing of time bins</p>
<p>is like increasing the frame rate on your camera, right?</p>
<p>Slow motion is achieved in movies and elsewhere</p>
<p>by increasing the frame rate.</p>
<p>So if you take a movie at 30 frames per second and watch it,</p>
<p>it will appear to have a certain speed, right?</p>
<p>Because those are just snapshots, 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>In contrast, if you took that same movie</p>
<p>at 4,000 frames per second, you are fine slicing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to see every little detail.</p>
<p>And as you play each one of those frames,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to look like it moved slower, okay?</p>
<p>Whatever, so the kind of jump shot in basketball</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s done slowly, any slow motion</p>
<p>is the consequence of higher frame rate.</p>
<p>So dopamine and norepinephrine increase frame rate.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, they tend to lead us</p>
<p>to overestimate the amount of time that&rsquo;s passed.</p>
<p>Conversely, the neuromodulator serotonin</p>
<p>causes people to underestimate</p>
<p>the amount of time that&rsquo;s passed.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve done these experiments.</p>
<p>They actually have done these experiments</p>
<p>using in humans with drugs that increase serotonin.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also done them with cannabis,</p>
<p>which increases serotonin among other things,</p>
<p>including the cannabinoid receptor activation.</p>
<p>And when people have elevated levels of 5-HT</p>
<p>or whether or not they&rsquo;ve ingested cannabis,</p>
<p>they tend to underestimate how much time has passed.</p>
<p>You do the equivalent experiment.</p>
<p>You tell people that they have to guess</p>
<p>or tell you when five minutes, for instance, has passed,</p>
<p>just to use five minutes as an example this time.</p>
<p>And generally they will miss the five minute mark.</p>
<p>They will think, they&rsquo;ll let six minutes pass</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll think it was five minutes</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;ve underestimated how much time has passed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because serotonin</p>
<p>and some of the related molecules in the brain</p>
<p>tend to lead to slower frame rates, right?</p>
<p>They take the frame rate from, in the example I used before,</p>
<p>from 4,000 frames per second</p>
<p>down to say 20 frames per second.</p>
<p>So this is very interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting in terms of how pharmacology can be used</p>
<p>to adjust time perception,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also interesting in the context</p>
<p>of that circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some emerging evidence</p>
<p>that throughout the 24-hour cycle,</p>
<p>there are robust changes</p>
<p>in the amount of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin</p>
<p>that are present in the brain and bloodstream and body</p>
<p>depending on time of day within the circadian cycle.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not talking about during sleep.</p>
<p>During sleep, there are definitely variations</p>
<p>in things like dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.</p>
<p>I talked about that in the episodes on sleep.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m just talking about the role of these molecules</p>
<p>in time perception during wakefulness.</p>
<p>So much of the evidence points to the fact</p>
<p>that in the first half of the day,</p>
<p>approximate first half of the day,</p>
<p>dopamine and norepinephrine are elevated</p>
<p>in the brain, body, and bloodstream</p>
<p>much more than is serotonin.</p>
<p>And that in the second half of the day,</p>
<p>and in particular towards evening and nighttime,</p>
<p>serotonin levels are going up.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fairly well-established now.</p>
<p>What that means based on what we just discussed</p>
<p>about the role of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin</p>
<p>in setting the frame rate of time perception</p>
<p>is that our perception of the passage of time</p>
<p>will be very different in the early part of the day</p>
<p>and in the latter half of the day.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s starting to be some evidence to support this</p>
<p>that early in the day,</p>
<p>people tend to overestimate how much time has passed.</p>
<p>And later in the day,</p>
<p>they tend to underestimate how much time has passed.</p>
<p>And this is independent of taking any kind of substance</p>
<p>that would increase or decrease dopamine or serotonin.</p>
<p>Now, this is important in terms of how one thinks</p>
<p>about structuring their day,</p>
<p>because I know many people are thinking about</p>
<p>the various tasks that they need to do throughout their day.</p>
<p>Many, or I should say, all of the literature,</p>
<p>at least that I can find on productivity</p>
<p>and things of that sort,</p>
<p>point to the idea that we should be doing the hardest task,</p>
<p>the thing that we want to do the least</p>
<p>or the most important task early in the day</p>
<p>as a kind of a psychological tool for getting it done</p>
<p>and feeling as if we accomplished something.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an excellent protocol, frankly,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s an excellent protocol</p>
<p>because of the way that we sense accomplishment,</p>
<p>or at least it&rsquo;s not only an excellent protocol</p>
<p>because of the way that we sense accomplishment.</p>
<p>Another reason to move something that&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>into the early part of the day</p>
<p>is that if indeed the dopaminergic</p>
<p>and noradrenergic circuits are more active</p>
<p>at that time,</p>
<p>we are actually in a better position cognitively</p>
<p>to parse that hard problem</p>
<p>because of the way that we are able to fine slice</p>
<p>our perception of time</p>
<p>and fine slice all the perceptual events outside us.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m really saying is that early in the day,</p>
<p>you are a much more high resolution camera, so to speak,</p>
<p>than you are later in the day.</p>
<p>Now, different types of tasks</p>
<p>and different types of things require different frame rates</p>
<p>or different ways of perceiving time.</p>
<p>And indeed, this also lends itself to a tool</p>
<p>whereby for activities that involve</p>
<p>more kind of creative thinking</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t as constrained by particular answers or outcomes</p>
<p>and in which we need to kind of blend</p>
<p>different aspects of our memory,</p>
<p>different aspects of task utilization.</p>
<p>In other words, for creative works, for brainstorming,</p>
<p>for things that are a bit more fluid, so to speak,</p>
<p>the more serotonergic second half of the day,</p>
<p>and because of the way the serotonergic</p>
<p>second half of the day lends itself to our time perception</p>
<p>may actually be more beneficial for those sorts of tasks.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll put a reference to a couple of the studies</p>
<p>that point to this idea</p>
<p>that in these higher dopaminergic states,</p>
<p>we are better at doing certain sorts of tasks.</p>
<p>And in these more serotonergic states,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re better at doing other sorts of tasks</p>
<p>and how the dopamine tends to be earlier than the day</p>
<p>and the serotonin later in the day, so to speak.</p>
<p>These are broad, I&rsquo;m painting with broad strokes here,</p>
<p>but I think these lend themselves</p>
<p>to some really excellent tools</p>
<p>because I think we all understand the value</p>
<p>of doing something that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>or challenging early in the day,</p>
<p>but we should ask ourselves, hard or challenging how?</p>
<p>What does that task actually really require</p>
<p>in terms of time perception?</p>
<p>Some people might appreciate some examples</p>
<p>of how this might work.</p>
<p>Basically what I&rsquo;m saying is if you are doing work</p>
<p>that involves adhering to some rigid rules,</p>
<p>so math or a recipe or execution of musical scales</p>
<p>or physical skills or accounting</p>
<p>or something that requires a lot of precision</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a right and wrong answer and it&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>I would suggest that you do that</p>
<p>in the early part of the day</p>
<p>because of the way that dopamine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>impact time perception.</p>
<p>You are literally better at slicing up time.</p>
<p>You are a higher resolution brain during those times.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s going to lend itself better</p>
<p>to events and demands that require high resolution.</p>
<p>Whereas in the afternoon,</p>
<p>in this more of what I&rsquo;m calling serotonergic state,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re going to be better at brainstorming</p>
<p>and creative works where there&rsquo;s some flexibility</p>
<p>in terms of how you&rsquo;re batching time and perceiving time.</p>
<p>And there isn&rsquo;t so much rigid oversight</p>
<p>of a right or wrong answer.</p>
<p>And as an aside to support what I said,</p>
<p>but also to take us back to this critical role</p>
<p>of the circadian rhythm,</p>
<p>there is a lot of evidence</p>
<p>that when one&rsquo;s sleep is disrupted,</p>
<p>when sleep is either too short or is fragmented</p>
<p>or is not of high enough quality for enough days,</p>
<p>one of the first things to happen</p>
<p>is that there is a dysregulation</p>
<p>of these dopaminergic, neurogeneric,</p>
<p>and serotonergic states throughout the day.</p>
<p>They get kind of mishmashed up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re a total mess,</p>
<p>but they aren&rsquo;t as cleanly defined.</p>
<p>And I think this is one of the reasons</p>
<p>why when we haven&rsquo;t slept well or we haven&rsquo;t slept enough,</p>
<p>we tend to feel a little off, like we can&rsquo;t concentrate.</p>
<p>Part of that lack of concentration is due to other things,</p>
<p>but part of that concentration could be due to the fact</p>
<p>that our sense of the passage of time is disrupted.</p>
<p>So there seems to be some value</p>
<p>in keeping the dopaminergic, neurogeneric state</p>
<p>kind of limited to the early part of the day</p>
<p>and the serotonergic state, as we&rsquo;re calling it,</p>
<p>kind of pushed towards the second half of the day.</p>
<p>Now there is a version of how dopamine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>can impact our perception of the passage of time</p>
<p>in ways that can be very disruptive or even maladaptive.</p>
<p>And the best example that I&rsquo;m aware of is trauma.</p>
<p>Many people who have been in car accidents</p>
<p>or who have experienced some other form of major trauma</p>
<p>do what&rsquo;s called overclocking.</p>
<p>Overclocking is when levels of dopamine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>increase so much during a particular event,</p>
<p>our level of alertness has increased so much</p>
<p>during a given event that we find slice.</p>
<p>In other words, the frame rate is increased so much so</p>
<p>that we perceive things as happening in ultra slow motion.</p>
<p>Now that might not seem like a bad thing overall,</p>
<p>but the problem with overclocking is the way</p>
<p>in which that information gets stamped down</p>
<p>into the memory system.</p>
<p>So the memory system, which involves areas of the brain</p>
<p>like the hippocampus, but also the neocortex</p>
<p>is basically a space-time recorder.</p>
<p>What do I mean by space-time recorder?</p>
<p>Well, your nervous system of course is housed</p>
<p>in the darkness of your skull.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have a whole lot of information</p>
<p>about the outside world,</p>
<p>except light coming in through the eyes</p>
<p>and whatever happens to hit our ears</p>
<p>and in terms of sound waves and skin and so forth.</p>
<p>So it has to take all those neural signals</p>
<p>and it has to create a record of what happened.</p>
<p>Now it doesn&rsquo;t create a record of everything that happened,</p>
<p>but car accidents and trauma and things of that sort</p>
<p>oftentimes are stamped down into our record</p>
<p>of what happened.</p>
<p>And what gets stamped down,</p>
<p>what we actually mean by the phrase stamped down</p>
<p>is that the precise firing of the sequence of neurons</p>
<p>that reflected some events.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m in a car accident,</p>
<p>certain neurons are firing because of the flipping of the car</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s screams or there&rsquo;s blood</p>
<p>or things of that sort.</p>
<p>All of that neural activity gets repeated</p>
<p>in the hippocampus and then the sequence</p>
<p>of the firing of those neurons is also remembered.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that neuron one, two, three, four</p>
<p>fired in that sequence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also that neuron one, two, three, four</p>
<p>fired at a particular rate.</p>
<p>So it would be one, two, three, four</p>
<p>during the actual event,</p>
<p>and then the memory is stored as firing of those neurons</p>
<p>as one, two, three, four, right?</p>
<p>If during the event it was one, two, three, four</p>
<p>at that rate, the storage of the memory</p>
<p>is not going to be one, two, three, four, okay?</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s both a space code as we say,</p>
<p>meaning the particular neurons that fire is important</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a rate code,</p>
<p>how quickly those neurons fire or the relative firing,</p>
<p>the timing of the firing of those neurons</p>
<p>is also part of the memory.</p>
<p>This affords our memory system tremendous flexibility.</p>
<p>What it means is that you can take the same set of neurons</p>
<p>in the hippocampus and stamp down</p>
<p>many, many more memories</p>
<p>because all you have to do is use a match</p>
<p>of the different rates of the different neurons</p>
<p>that were firing in order to set that code, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, otherwise if you needed a different set of neurons</p>
<p>for every memory, you&rsquo;d need an enormous hippocampus,</p>
<p>you need an enormous head.</p>
<p>So I think you get the basic idea.</p>
<p>Overclocking is a case in which the frame rate is so high</p>
<p>that a memory gets stamped down</p>
<p>and people have a very hard time shaking that memory</p>
<p>and the emotions associated with that memory.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the topic of today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>but we will cover trauma in a future episode in detail,</p>
<p>but many of the treatments for trauma, EMDR,</p>
<p>nowadays there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement</p>
<p>also about ketamine therapies, exposure therapies,</p>
<p>you know, like cognitive behavioral therapies</p>
<p>involve not just trying to reduce the amount of emotion</p>
<p>associated with a memory,</p>
<p>but also a deliberate speeding up</p>
<p>or slowing down of that memory.</p>
<p>In other words, trying to allow the person</p>
<p>who experienced the trauma to take control</p>
<p>of the rate of the experience in their memory,</p>
<p>not just whether or not the memory happened at all.</p>
<p>In fact, you know, one of the first things</p>
<p>that trauma victims learn is that</p>
<p>they aren&rsquo;t going to forget what happened,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s eventually going to happen ideally</p>
<p>with good treatment is that the emotional weight</p>
<p>of the experience will eventually be divorced</p>
<p>from the memory of the experience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s done again by trying to reduce the amount</p>
<p>of emotional activation during the recall</p>
<p>of that experience.</p>
<p>And one of the best ways to do that</p>
<p>is to alter the rate of the memory playback.</p>
<p>In other words, taking that firing of neurons</p>
<p>that might&rsquo;ve been one, two, three, four,</p>
<p>again, it would be much more complicated,</p>
<p>but one, two, three, four for the car crash</p>
<p>and getting the memory to play back</p>
<p>at a rate of one, two, three, four,</p>
<p>or even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.</p>
<p>In other words, allowing the person</p>
<p>or instructing the person to take control</p>
<p>of the rate of the playback.</p>
<p>And in that way, there seems to be still yet</p>
<p>unknown mechanism by which people can uncouple</p>
<p>some of the emotional weight</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with that memory.</p>
<p>So overclocking is a kind of extreme example</p>
<p>of where the dopaminergic and the neuroadrenergic system</p>
<p>is ramped up so high that people have this,</p>
<p>unfortunately, what seems like indelible mark</p>
<p>in their brain of a particular event.</p>
<p>But again, trauma treatment is designed</p>
<p>to uncouple the emotional load of that event.</p>
<p>Some of you are probably saying why dopamine during trauma?</p>
<p>I thought dopamine was the feel-good molecule.</p>
<p>Well, in reality, dopamine is not necessarily</p>
<p>a molecule of reward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a molecule of motivation, pursuit, and drive.</p>
<p>And because of the close relationship</p>
<p>between dopamine and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>oftentimes they are co-released.</p>
<p>So whether or not dopamine is released</p>
<p>during car crashes or other forms of trauma,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But what we do know is that both the dopamine system</p>
<p>and the neuroadrenergic system,</p>
<p>when we say neuroadrenergic, we mean norepinephrine,</p>
<p>those systems are greatly increased</p>
<p>anytime there&rsquo;s a heightened state of arousal.</p>
<p>And arousal can have negative valence,</p>
<p>like a meaning associated with an event that we really hate,</p>
<p>that we would prefer not to be involved in,</p>
<p>or it can have positive valence.</p>
<p>But dopamine and norepinephrine are kind of</p>
<p>the common hallmark of all things of elevated arousal.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why we see evidence for dopamine</p>
<p>being associated with these changes in time perception,</p>
<p>both for positive events and for negative events.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very interesting relationship</p>
<p>between arousal, dopamine, time perception, and blinking.</p>
<p>And this is all supported by a really interesting paper.</p>
<p>First author Terhune is the last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s published in Current Biology,</p>
<p>self-pressed journal, excellent journal.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>Time Dilates After a Spontaneous Blinking.</p>
<p>So heightened states of arousal</p>
<p>are associated with heightened levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>You now know that dopamine leads</p>
<p>to a kind of fine slicing of time.</p>
<p>And one of the ways that we fine slice time is by blinking.</p>
<p>You know, we think of blinking as just a thing</p>
<p>to like lubricate our eyes</p>
<p>or to limit the amount of light coming into our eyes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a shutter on our experience.</p>
<p>So much of the information</p>
<p>that coming into the brain through our eyes</p>
<p>impacts our attention.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before on this podcast</p>
<p>that cognitive attention follows visual attention,</p>
<p>at least for sighted individuals.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that dopamine</p>
<p>and increases in dopamine are associated</p>
<p>with increases in spontaneous blink rate.</p>
<p>So the more aroused we are, the more awake we are,</p>
<p>there are a number of effects,</p>
<p>pupil&rsquo;s dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera,</p>
<p>but also blink rate increases.</p>
<p>And every time we blink, this study cleanly shows,</p>
<p>we shift our perception of time,</p>
<p>leading to, as I mentioned before, overestimations of time.</p>
<p>So it seems as though in some way,</p>
<p>blink rate is actually related to frame rate.</p>
<p>And so this is very, very interesting.</p>
<p>And the way that you could think about leveraging this</p>
<p>would be if you wanted to actually slow down</p>
<p>your perception of time, you would blink less.</p>
<p>And if you want to speed up your perception of time,</p>
<p>you would blink more.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;d have to think of a scenario</p>
<p>in which that would be useful to you.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you&rsquo;re going to blink,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to miss things as well.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s a very interesting parameter</p>
<p>of our visual attention as it relates to time perception,</p>
<p>because what it really speaks to</p>
<p>is that these neuromodulators like dopamine or serotonin</p>
<p>that adjust frame rate,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not doing it through some magical mechanism.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s no single brain area</p>
<p>that we can say controls time perception.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t said today, oh, you know, it&rsquo;s the striatum.</p>
<p>Well, it involves the striatum,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to say, for instance,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s the cerebellum.</p>
<p>The cerebellum is definitely involved in timing of movement,</p>
<p>something for a future podcast.</p>
<p>But time perception is what we call</p>
<p>a distributed phenomenon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a network of areas in the brain working together.</p>
<p>But dopamine in the way that it relates</p>
<p>to the shuttering of your eyes</p>
<p>seems to be controlling the frame rate on your experience.</p>
<p>Numerous times on this podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about cold exposure.</p>
<p>And nowadays there&rsquo;s a lot of interest</p>
<p>in things like cold showers, ice baths,</p>
<p>submersion in cold water tanks and, you know,</p>
<p>lakes and oceans and things of that sort.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different positive effects</p>
<p>of cold exposure.</p>
<p>Provided it&rsquo;s done properly,</p>
<p>it can lead to increases in metabolism,</p>
<p>brown fat stores, which are the good fat stores</p>
<p>that you want.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sort of like a furnace to the heat</p>
<p>that allow you to heat yourself up,</p>
<p>stay warm in cold environments,</p>
<p>to reduce inflammation,</p>
<p>to increase resilience and so forth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study published</p>
<p>in the European Journal of Physiology</p>
<p>showing that cold exposure</p>
<p>can increase our baseline levels of dopamine robustly,</p>
<p>2.5X, and it&rsquo;s a long lasting increase in dopamine</p>
<p>and appears to be a healthy one,</p>
<p>meaning it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be addictive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are some people out there</p>
<p>addicted to ice baths.</p>
<p>But, you know, when you think about the range</p>
<p>of dopamine inducing behaviors that are addictive,</p>
<p>that seems to be more on the health promoting side.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that because cold water exposure</p>
<p>increases dopamine,</p>
<p>it will also change your perception of time.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever done one of these cold water exposures,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve experienced this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve experienced getting in and feeling like,</p>
<p>wow, making it three minutes is a really, really long time.</p>
<p>And you are fine slicing time.</p>
<p>Your frame rate is going up.</p>
<p>Part of that, just at a kind of a course level</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re thinking, this is painful, I don&rsquo;t like this.</p>
<p>I want to get out, right?</p>
<p>But part of it is also that your dopamine levels</p>
<p>are going up very quickly.</p>
<p>And therefore your perception of that discomfort</p>
<p>is also being fine sliced.</p>
<p>And so you could leverage a tool, for instance,</p>
<p>where you try and entrain your thinking to something other</p>
<p>than your immediate experience, right?</p>
<p>This is a kind of a controversy, if you will,</p>
<p>in the cold exposure world.</p>
<p>The question is, do you try and lean into the experience</p>
<p>and really feel it?</p>
<p>Or do you try and distract yourself?</p>
<p>You know, sing a song or count off, you know,</p>
<p>from one to a hundred.</p>
<p>Just know that whatever tactic you use</p>
<p>to get through the cold exposure,</p>
<p>that the dopamine level that&rsquo;s now increased in your system</p>
<p>is going to cause you to fine slice</p>
<p>or experience that at slow motion.</p>
<p>So a minute is going to seem like a lot longer</p>
<p>than a minute in reality.</p>
<p>So you could, for instance,</p>
<p>decide to pay attention to some external cue.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a metronome that ticks once every 10 seconds.</p>
<p>You could decide to think about something else.</p>
<p>You could decide to sing a song in your head</p>
<p>or sing a song out loud.</p>
<p>All of that will divorce you from the sensation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re experienced somewhat,</p>
<p>but more so it will divorce you from the perception</p>
<p>of your experience as governed by that dopamine increase</p>
<p>in frame rate.</p>
<p>If that isn&rsquo;t clear, just know this.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in the ice bath, your dopamine levels are high.</p>
<p>When your dopamine levels are high,</p>
<p>your experience of the discomfort that ice bath</p>
<p>is at higher resolution.</p>
<p>Now, up until now, I&rsquo;ve been talking about how dopamine</p>
<p>and to some extent serotonin</p>
<p>can differentially impact your perception of how fast</p>
<p>or how slowly things are happening in the moment.</p>
<p>But remember, we have prospective time.</p>
<p>We have our experience of time in the moment</p>
<p>and we have retrospective time.</p>
<p>And there are beautiful studies that have showed</p>
<p>that the dopaminergic state changes the way,</p>
<p>not just that we experience things now,</p>
<p>but that it changes the way in which we remember things</p>
<p>in the past and the rate at which those things occurred.</p>
<p>And those are in opposite direction.</p>
<p>So to make this very simple,</p>
<p>if something that you experience is fun or varied,</p>
<p>meaning it has a lot of different components in it,</p>
<p>and in other words, is associated with an increase</p>
<p>in dopamine in your brain,</p>
<p>you will experience that as going by very fast.</p>
<p>Now, this is different than the ice bath,</p>
<p>which I just said you experience as going by very slowly,</p>
<p>but here I&rsquo;m talking about something that&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>and varied that you really like.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll feel like it goes by very, very fast.</p>
<p>Imagine an amazing day for a kid at an amusement park.</p>
<p>They can do a ton of things, it&rsquo;s all new,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very excited,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll feel like it goes by very fast.</p>
<p>But later, they will remember that experience</p>
<p>as being very long,</p>
<p>that it was a long day full of many, many events.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this paradoxical relationship</p>
<p>between how we perceive fun, exciting, varied events</p>
<p>in the present and how we remember them in the past.</p>
<p>For those of you who&rsquo;ve gone on vacation,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve had an amazing day on vacation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll seem like, or an amazing vacation overall,</p>
<p>it will seem like it goes by very fast.</p>
<p>The last day of vacation, you sort of go,</p>
<p>whoa, it went by so fast</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much happening.</p>
<p>But in memory, six to eight months later,</p>
<p>you remember, wow, that just went,</p>
<p>that was a long, long thing.</p>
<p>We had this, then we had that,</p>
<p>then we did this, then we had that.</p>
<p>It tends to spool out in a longer memory</p>
<p>than the actual experience.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you are bored with something</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s something you really don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to seem like it takes a long time</p>
<p>to go through that experience in the moment.</p>
<p>But retroactively looking back,</p>
<p>it will seem like that moment was very short.</p>
<p>So if the other day I was waiting</p>
<p>in the waiting room for the dentist,</p>
<p>it was pretty boring.</p>
<p>I was just kind of sitting there.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much going on.</p>
<p>And it did seem like it was going on an awfully long time.</p>
<p>But indeed, looking back, it just seems like,</p>
<p>okay, I sat in that room, not much happened.</p>
<p>And so it seems like a very short time bin.</p>
<p>This seems to be an efficiency</p>
<p>of how the brain stores information.</p>
<p>Dopamine being associated, of course,</p>
<p>with fun and varied experiences</p>
<p>and low dopamine being associated</p>
<p>with kind of empty, boring,</p>
<p>or what at the time seemed like long experiences.</p>
<p>And this whole thing has been stamped down</p>
<p>into the scientific literature</p>
<p>by those earlier experiments</p>
<p>where they take human beings</p>
<p>and isolate them in certain environments.</p>
<p>Take away all the clocks and watches and cues</p>
<p>and about what time of day it is</p>
<p>and what time of night it is</p>
<p>and allow people to have a life</p>
<p>where they can either read and work and do things</p>
<p>or where they have very little to do.</p>
<p>When people are isolated in very boring environments</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have access to time cues, time dilates.</p>
<p>They tend to assume that time has gone on very, very long.</p>
<p>And so the reason I bring this up</p>
<p>is we aren&rsquo;t just driven by these circadian clocks</p>
<p>and these circanual clocks and these ultradian clocks.</p>
<p>We are driven by these timers</p>
<p>that vary depending on our level of excitement.</p>
<p>And they vary depending on our level of excitement</p>
<p>because of these neuromodulators, dopamine and serotonin.</p>
<p>So the way I like to think about it</p>
<p>is that you have two clocks, two stopwatches.</p>
<p>One is a dopaminergic stopwatch</p>
<p>that find slices really closely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like counts off milliseconds</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s grabbing a movie of your experience</p>
<p>at very high resolution.</p>
<p>And then the other hand,</p>
<p>you have a stopwatch that&rsquo;s gathering big time bins,</p>
<p>big ticks along the, you know,</p>
<p>that the hand is moving at bigger intervals,</p>
<p>you know, marking off time.</p>
<p>And depending on whether or not you&rsquo;re excited</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re bored,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using different stopwatches on time</p>
<p>and therefore you&rsquo;re perceiving your experience differently.</p>
<p>One very interesting aspect to the way</p>
<p>that neuromodulators like dopamine and novelty</p>
<p>interact with time perception and memory</p>
<p>is how we perceive our relationship to places and people.</p>
<p>So really interesting literature</p>
<p>showing that the more novel experiences we have in a place,</p>
<p>the more we feel we know that place, obviously,</p>
<p>but the longer we feel we&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the kind of Gedanken or thought experiment</p>
<p>that illustrates what&rsquo;s in the literature.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I were to move to New York City.</p>
<p>I happen to really like New York City.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never lived there, but let&rsquo;s say I lived there.</p>
<p>I lived in a given apartment for a year</p>
<p>and I would have a number of different experiences.</p>
<p>In this mental experiment,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I had a hundred different</p>
<p>exciting and new experiences.</p>
<p>I would, at the end of that year,</p>
<p>feel as if I lived there a certain period of time, one year.</p>
<p>I would actually know I lived there one year.</p>
<p>If, however, I lived in three different places</p>
<p>in New York City and I met three times as many people</p>
<p>and I had three times as many novel experiences,</p>
<p>I would actually feel as if I had been there much longer</p>
<p>than had I only lived in one location.</p>
<p>This is also true for social interactions.</p>
<p>When we move to multiple or several novel environments</p>
<p>with somebody else, we tend to feel</p>
<p>as if we know that person much better</p>
<p>and that they know us much better.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we get the opportunity</p>
<p>to interact with those people in different contexts.</p>
<p>And so, indeed, we do get the opportunity to see them,</p>
<p>for instance, at the coffee shop, how they order coffee.</p>
<p>You maybe go to a sports event, how they act there,</p>
<p>maybe how they interact with your family.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting a sense of them in different contexts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly playing a role.</p>
<p>But it seems as if the more novelty</p>
<p>you experience with somebody,</p>
<p>not only the more familiar they are to you,</p>
<p>but the more time you feel you&rsquo;ve spent with them,</p>
<p>even though the total amount of time</p>
<p>can be exactly the same.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a very interesting aspect</p>
<p>of how our perception of time in these neuromodulators</p>
<p>and novelty can shape the way,</p>
<p>not just that we perceive a given event in our world,</p>
<p>but how we relate to a place or relate to a person.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the different neurochemicals</p>
<p>and how those neurochemicals can influence</p>
<p>our perception of time.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked a lot about the neural circuits</p>
<p>and the various areas of the brain that underlie this.</p>
<p>I do want to touch on that</p>
<p>by highlighting a really wonderful study.</p>
<p>This was a study published in Neuron,</p>
<p>also a Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is Behavioral, Physiological,</p>
<p>and Neural Signatures of Surprise</p>
<p>During Naturalistic Sports Viewing.</p>
<p>This experiment is really cool.</p>
<p>They did brain imaging on individuals</p>
<p>who are watching basketball games.</p>
<p>These were basketball games that actually took place</p>
<p>that were recorded.</p>
<p>The subjects watching these basketball games,</p>
<p>in some cases, not all,</p>
<p>had some interest in who would win or lose.</p>
<p>And in some cases, not all,</p>
<p>the subjects in these studies had some prior knowledge</p>
<p>of which team they thought was better,</p>
<p>which team was likely to win or not likely to win.</p>
<p>The basic findings of the study were</p>
<p>that they could measure surprise</p>
<p>by the release of dopamine in two areas of the brain,</p>
<p>part of what is called, excuse me,</p>
<p>the mesolimbic reward pathway.</p>
<p>So the two areas of the brain that are important here</p>
<p>are the nucleus accumbens and the VTA,</p>
<p>the ventral tegmental area.</p>
<p>These are areas that release dopamine</p>
<p>as kind of a token of reward</p>
<p>anytime something is surprising</p>
<p>or a positive expectation is met, okay?</p>
<p>So if I predict that my team dribbling down court</p>
<p>is going to score on this drive</p>
<p>and they get the ball in the basket,</p>
<p>a little bit of dopamine is released,</p>
<p>these two brain areas light up in the functional imaging,</p>
<p>so-called fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging</p>
<p>that they used in the study.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really interesting about this study</p>
<p>is not just that dopamine was released</p>
<p>anytime that something the subject wanted to see happened,</p>
<p>right, anytime they wanted to see their team score,</p>
<p>they scored, but also during surprise.</p>
<p>So if they thought, for instance,</p>
<p>and they would hit a button to predict</p>
<p>that their team was going to score on this particular drive</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t, well,</p>
<p>then dopamine could also be released</p>
<p>in response to that surprise.</p>
<p>So this speaks again to dopamine</p>
<p>being something that&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>not just for positive events, but for unexpected events.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s all very interesting</p>
<p>and speaks to the fact that dopamine</p>
<p>is a kind of flexible currency in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doled out, if you will,</p>
<p>or released when something that one hopes will happen happens</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s released when there&rsquo;s a surprise,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a kind of a negative surprise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not something that the subject wanted to happen.</p>
<p>But the more interesting thing</p>
<p>is how that relates to time perception.</p>
<p>What they found was,</p>
<p>regardless of what caused the dopamine release,</p>
<p>the frequency of dopamine release</p>
<p>predicted how the subjects parsed the time bins</p>
<p>of the game they were watching.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, when you watch a basketball game</p>
<p>or you watch anything, children playing</p>
<p>or talking to your spouse or whatever,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re batching time.</p>
<p>How are you batching time?</p>
<p>Well, you could batch a meal by the, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the appetizer, the main course and the dessert,</p>
<p>but it turns out that&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re batching time</p>
<p>according to the frequency of dopamine pulses,</p>
<p>the frequency of dopamine release.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they saw in this study.</p>
<p>If they evaluated people&rsquo;s perceptions</p>
<p>of the passage of time,</p>
<p>what they found is that that matched</p>
<p>not whether or not it was a particular time point</p>
<p>in the game,</p>
<p>not whether or not their team was going down court</p>
<p>or running back up court to play defense,</p>
<p>but the dopamine release served as markers</p>
<p>which would predict the frame rate</p>
<p>of their perception of the experience.</p>
<p>And if that sounds complicated,</p>
<p>what I mean is how often and when you release dopamine</p>
<p>is actually setting the frame rate</p>
<p>on the entire perception of everything,</p>
<p>not just of her positive events or negative events.</p>
<p>So what this means is as you&rsquo;re going through life,</p>
<p>dopamine and the release of dopamine is saying,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s over and now you&rsquo;re in a new phase of your life,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s very short, right?</p>
<p>So if I get up in the morning</p>
<p>and I really need a cup of coffee,</p>
<p>as you probably all know,</p>
<p>I wait 90 minutes to 120 minutes before I drink my coffee,</p>
<p>but then I get my coffee</p>
<p>and surely there&rsquo;s a dopamine hit there, I promise you.</p>
<p>I actually am starting to carve up my day</p>
<p>according to dopamine hits.</p>
<p>I am with consciously or subconsciously,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually carving up my experience</p>
<p>according to when I&rsquo;m getting dopamine throughout my day.</p>
<p>This governance over our perception of time</p>
<p>that dopamine has points to a very clear,</p>
<p>very actionable and very powerful tool.</p>
<p>And that is a tool that many people</p>
<p>have talked about before, which are habits.</p>
<p>People have discussed habits in a variety of contexts,</p>
<p>but in the context of dopamine reward and time perception,</p>
<p>what this means is that placing specific habitual routines</p>
<p>at particular intervals throughout your day</p>
<p>is a very, not just convenient,</p>
<p>but a very good way to incorporate the dopamine system</p>
<p>so that you divide your day</p>
<p>into a series of what I would call functional units.</p>
<p>What would this look like?</p>
<p>It would mean waking up and having one specific habit</p>
<p>that you always engage in that causes a release of dopamine.</p>
<p>You could say, well, great, that&rsquo;ll make me feel good.</p>
<p>And I would agree,</p>
<p>dopamine release generally makes us feel motivated,</p>
<p>but it would have an additional effect</p>
<p>of marking that time of day</p>
<p>as the beginning of a particular time bin.</p>
<p>Then inserting another habit, perhaps the beginning of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, your breakfast or something,</p>
<p>but recognizing that that&rsquo;s a habit</p>
<p>and being fairly habitual.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be obsessively precise about the timing,</p>
<p>but that regular sequencing of things</p>
<p>is going to lead not just to dopamine release</p>
<p>as it relates to reward and motivation and feeling good,</p>
<p>but it actually becomes the way in which we carve up</p>
<p>our entire experience of our day.</p>
<p>And this is almost a circular argument.</p>
<p>You could say, well, of course,</p>
<p>I do one thing, then I do the next,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how I perceive my day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my list, it&rsquo;s my to-do list, et cetera.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is that on the basis of this study,</p>
<p>I should mention the first author,</p>
<p>his last name is Antony.</p>
<p>It was Antony et al, it was published in 2020.</p>
<p>The study on basketball viewing,</p>
<p>what it points to is that by engaging in specific habits</p>
<p>that we know we can perform well,</p>
<p>we are actually setting the frame rate on our day.</p>
<p>And so I think there will soon come a time</p>
<p>where human beings are not just thinking of,</p>
<p>okay, my morning routine and my afternoon routine.</p>
<p>I think that can be useful.</p>
<p>And in fact, I used or mentioned a structure</p>
<p>of that sort earlier in the episode,</p>
<p>but rather thinking about what&rsquo;s actually going on</p>
<p>at the level of our biology,</p>
<p>which is that dopamine is marking time.</p>
<p>Habits are a very clear way</p>
<p>in which we can invoke dopamine release</p>
<p>and therefore provide time markers.</p>
<p>And what this means is that, for instance,</p>
<p>during your morning, you might insert habit one</p>
<p>and habit two at say, I don&rsquo;t know, 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.</p>
<p>And in doing that, that marks an epoch,</p>
<p>a little batch of time in your morning routine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s distinct from the second half of your morning.</p>
<p>In other words, habits serve as flankers or markers</p>
<p>for the passage of your day.</p>
<p>Now, if that seems kind of hyper-neurotic</p>
<p>or why would I want to structure my life like that?</p>
<p>I would say that many people would do well</p>
<p>to structure their life like that and to utilize habits,</p>
<p>not just for sake of what you do during the habit,</p>
<p>but because of the fact that the habits serve as a marker</p>
<p>because of the way they can evoke dopamine release.</p>
<p>And in doing that, you&rsquo;re able to segment your day</p>
<p>into a bunch of smaller, if you want them to be smaller,</p>
<p>or larger functional units.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to experiment with this,</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab Podcast puts out a newsletter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Neural Network Newsletter.</p>
<p>You can sign up for it at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>We put it out each month.</p>
<p>You can see the previous newsletters.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re zero cost.</p>
<p>We have our privacy statement there.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t share your email or anything.</p>
<p>And there you&rsquo;ll find the 12 steps to improving sleep</p>
<p>was the first one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another, the second newsletter</p>
<p>was all about neuroplasticity and using scientific literature</p>
<p>to improve learning and teaching.</p>
<p>And in the next newsletter,</p>
<p>I intend to include a example protocol</p>
<p>of how one could use habits</p>
<p>and the relationship between habits and dopamine,</p>
<p>and time perception to structure your day</p>
<p>according to performance of particular types of tasks.</p>
<p>Today, we covered a lot about time perception.</p>
<p>We certainly didn&rsquo;t cover everything about time perception,</p>
<p>but we covered things like entrainment,</p>
<p>the role of dopamine, habits, and various routines</p>
<p>that can adjust your sense of time</p>
<p>for sake of particular goals.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more</p>
<p>about time perception,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to point you to a really excellent book</p>
<p>called Your Brain is a Time Machine,</p>
<p>the Neuroscience and Physics of Time.</p>
<p>The book was written by professor, Dr. Dean Buonamano,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a professor at UCLA and a world expert</p>
<p>in the neuroscience and physics of time.</p>
<p>I do hope to get Dean on the podcast</p>
<p>in the not too distant future.</p>
