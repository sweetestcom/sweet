<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>well hello and welcome back we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>for another cue at a anything that I say</p>
<p>is definitely not intended to cure any</p>
<p>diseases check with your doctor before</p>
<p>implementing any of the things we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to talk about and we have a great</p>
<p>lineup great questions</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s get started all right very good</p>
<p>let me look at this I&rsquo;m going to reach</p>
<p>back here a little bit Eddie uh excuse</p>
<p>me Terry is so good at this there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>that someone wrote and dagged me but I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t find it but they were talking</p>
<p>about how great they did a 60 pound loss</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific from all the things that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t tell people to do or don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>insist that it will help so that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>Dr Berg somehow it filters through and</p>
<p>people get these great results</p>
<p>nonetheless so congratulations to you</p>
<p>sir I&rsquo;ll find you again somewhere for</p>
<p>your 60 pound loss he&rsquo;s feeling terrific</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s on uh the Dr Berg regimes so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wonderful other people on uh</p>
<p>social media which we love they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>flooding the questions in Hilda from</p>
<p>YouTube do you have a guide that we</p>
<p>could access that recommends which</p>
<p>vitamins to take on a daily basis and</p>
<p>how much thank you that is a good</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s been difficult to find a guy</p>
<p>like that and unfortunately um</p>
<p>I could do it maybe I could just get my</p>
<p>cell phone out and people can just call</p>
<p>me randomly but that probably won&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>either so what I can do is I can uh</p>
<p>how about this I&rsquo;ll create a video</p>
<p>a very detailed video on just</p>
<p>supplements so I&rsquo;m making a note right</p>
<p>there so that way</p>
<p>I can do that and solve that problem but</p>
<p>there are I do want to list a network of</p>
<p>at least some good docs that I know that</p>
<p>are good evaluators</p>
<p>um because you you need a good evaluator</p>
<p>to figure things out so I will also work</p>
<p>on that I had it on the list at one time</p>
<p>and I I need to do that because it would</p>
<p>be nice to have</p>
<p>um someone to help people specifically</p>
<p>like one-on-one</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s uh just a terrific</p>
<p>oh here we go I want to give credit to</p>
<p>Noah from YouTube I&rsquo;ve lost 60 pounds</p>
<p>while on healthy keto since last</p>
<p>November thank you from all of us for</p>
<p>your help and your resources you have</p>
<p>put together with a bunch of exclamation</p>
<p>marks so that&rsquo;s great Noah what a great</p>
<p>feeling that is</p>
<p>okay and if any if if you have had a</p>
<p>great success please please please go to</p>
<p>our website there&rsquo;s a little button</p>
<p>there and upload your before and afters</p>
<p>or your testimonial with a picture of</p>
<p>you I&rsquo;d really appreciate that because I</p>
<p>would love to read your own success</p>
<p>story and hear it from it and we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like to just um</p>
<p>you know have as many success stories as</p>
<p>possible and uh I think you just</p>
<p>sometimes need to ask for one right so</p>
<p>this is my request well that&rsquo;s great and</p>
<p>by the way uh audience Dr Berg takes</p>
<p>your questions very seriously in fact</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty critical because he&rsquo;s put</p>
<p>out thousands of videos and he wants to</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s on your mind so he can serve</p>
<p>you and so when you put these out and</p>
<p>unfortunately we can&rsquo;t obviously get</p>
<p>them all on the air uh but the the rest</p>
<p>of them he goes through them and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the fodder for the videos that you watch</p>
<p>so thank you all for uh you know making</p>
<p>uh the entire Berg program better by</p>
<p>your input so he learns a lot from your</p>
<p>questions all right let&rsquo;s see um</p>
<p>poor Joanna from YouTube I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>diarrhea for weeks now with no</p>
<p>resolution I&rsquo;ve been on keto and iaf</p>
<p>since April stools were first firm if</p>
<p>you want that much information uh and</p>
<p>form but now I&rsquo;m experiencing explosive</p>
<p>diarrhea how awful help well it sounds</p>
<p>to me like there&rsquo;s something that you</p>
<p>newly introduced to your diet that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>causing this and that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>dangerous to have diarrhea for that long</p>
<p>because you lose your electrolytes which</p>
<p>can really mess everything up so what I</p>
<p>would recommend is</p>
<p>take a look at what you ate before and</p>
<p>what you introduced is it is it just uh</p>
<p>more greens than usual some people can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tolerate the greens and they have</p>
<p>diarrhea just from too too much salad</p>
<p>that could be it could it could it be a</p>
<p>supplement that you added that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating diarrhea</p>
<p>um so you really need to figure that out</p>
<p>fast uh in the meantime I think adding</p>
<p>uh some kefir with blackberries blend it</p>
<p>up in a a little shake and consume that</p>
<p>that that tends to stop diarrhea</p>
<p>um and you need more probiotics too but</p>
<p>um it sounds to me there&rsquo;s something in</p>
<p>your diet that you&rsquo;re and then in the</p>
<p>past I think for my observation it could</p>
<p>be just the introduction of all way too</p>
<p>many vegetables that you can&rsquo;t tolerate</p>
<p>so you might need to back off and see if</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t help all right good luck to</p>
<p>you that&rsquo;s a terrible issue uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>Andrea from Facebook this is interesting</p>
<p>what could be the cause of night</p>
<p>paralysis what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s a normal thing that happens</p>
<p>with um our sleep cycles there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>certain uh thing that kicks in that</p>
<p>causes us to be paralyzed but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually you&rsquo;re in deep sleep right but</p>
<p>it uh there is another condition</p>
<p>um which is associated with called</p>
<p>narcolepsy which you just</p>
<p>can fall asleep during the day so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not specifically what uh understanding</p>
<p>exactly</p>
<p>you know what exactly your problem is</p>
<p>um is you said it&rsquo;s at night it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>paralysis well you probably want to be</p>
<p>paralyzed that when you&rsquo;re sleeping</p>
<p>right I so I I would have to have more</p>
<p>data to really know more about that but</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s during the day you should then</p>
<p>watch my video on narcolepsy which uh</p>
<p>people just it could be dangerous you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>driving and you fall asleep that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>good well you know the audience might</p>
<p>relate to this and I&rsquo;ve had this a few</p>
<p>times in my life where I am just on the</p>
<p>brink of sleep and feel Frozen and then</p>
<p>suddenly Lurch out of it uh and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very uncomfortable so I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re talking about but um</p>
<p>but no yeah it could be very uh bad if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re driving right which which oh yeah</p>
<p>you know falling asleep just because you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t slept well</p>
<p>um I think uh one little thing is if you</p>
<p>do have sleeping problems uh I would</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>as a way of coping with it as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching my videos to solve it</p>
<p>take naps lay in bed longer so you could</p>
<p>eventually maybe get some additional</p>
<p>hours</p>
<p>but having a sufficient sleep boy does</p>
<p>that solve so many problems related to</p>
<p>hunger cravings blood sugars stress in</p>
<p>the heart uh energy during the day Focus</p>
<p>cognitive function overall mood during</p>
<p>the day it&rsquo;s really really key okay I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got a question for you doc so I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>that if you can&rsquo;t sleep but your lane</p>
<p>still lights are off your eyes are</p>
<p>closed and you&rsquo;re just sort of well I</p>
<p>guess existing but relaxing that you can</p>
<p>still gain some of the benefits of sleep</p>
<p>is that true or not</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s true you can gain some of them</p>
<p>not many but it&rsquo;s definitely better than</p>
<p>nothing yeah</p>
<p>um so like even some people if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>driving they feel tired they pull over</p>
<p>somewhere and they&rsquo;re just resting and</p>
<p>now they can keep driving because they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t fall asleep but they can rest</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of Lucky and then I can</p>
<p>literally pull over close my eyes and</p>
<p>actually go take a three minute power</p>
<p>nap and feel refreshed</p>
<p>um some people can&rsquo;t do that I I lucked</p>
<p>out on that so that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>all right here we go again people</p>
<p>bragging about the wonderful life that</p>
<p>has spawned from their knowing you Tina</p>
<p>from Fresno on YouTube uh has lost 65</p>
<p>pounds upping our last uh person by five</p>
<p>pounds in the last year following your</p>
<p>programs thank you Dr Byrd so there we</p>
<p>go again wow that&rsquo;s and then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing other people that have</p>
<p>experienced that and are hopeful are the</p>
<p>ones listening to us around the world so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like to say a good morning to all</p>
<p>of them viewing um and joining us today</p>
<p>from the UK Canada Mexico Jordan Spain</p>

<p>Bulgaria Dubai Iran Colombia Micronesia</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve had them on maybe we</p>
<p>have Kurdistan South Korea Libya the</p>
<p>Philippines Abu Dhabi Iraq Somalia</p>
<p>Switzerland Armenia Ireland and all</p>
<p>across the United States well that ate</p>
<p>up all our time doc</p>
<p>he will be back no that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>only viewers that&rsquo;s the only viewers</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a Believer well audience yeah</p>
<p>audience we hope you like that it does</p>
<p>take a little bit of time but man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just amazing and people seem to like to</p>
<p>throw in their name on that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always a couple of stragglers they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coming about what about us so uh I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s appreciated all right uh let&rsquo;s get</p>
<p>our first quiz question for the day up</p>
<p>there and Doc here it is</p>
<p>the one Trace mineral that the Japanese</p>
<p>consume 20 times</p>
<p>more of or 20 times more of huh everyone</p>
<p>else in the world</p>
<p>all right climb on it and by the way and</p>
<p>by the way certain parts of Japan they</p>
<p>they live a lot longer so it might be</p>
<p>good to know this question and how it</p>
<p>could relate to maybe longevity possibly</p>
<p>no kidding I&rsquo;d like a few more years</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s go back to uh I tell it let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to the green room and June from Juno</p>
<p>Beach she is a repeat customer here</p>
<p>calling in so she&rsquo;s an expert on one</p>
<p>question 30 seconds she&rsquo;s going to lead</p>
<p>the way and tell the rest of the people</p>
<p>in The Green Room just exactly how to</p>
<p>behave and start off to see if she</p>
<p>remembered to unmute herself so June</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with Dr Burke I did I unmuted</p>
<p>myself hi good morning Dr Berg thank you</p>
<p>so thank you so much for being so</p>
<p>accessible to us all and I pre</p>
<p>appreciate your uh teaching style and</p>
<p>how concise you are and how you break</p>
<p>things down for us to digest it I even</p>
<p>have my own little Dr bird Notebook</p>
<p>every time I watch a video so I wanted</p>
<p>to say thank you</p>
<p>um I believe it was your birthday in</p>
<p>March when I first got to speak with you</p>
<p>and you helped me with my sleep issues</p>
<p>and I was having heat running up and</p>
<p>down my spine at night while I slept you</p>
<p>gave me suggestions of seek help</p>
<p>um tocatrinol and desiccated adrenal and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following I fell in love with</p>
<p>your formula right I don&rsquo;t know sleeping</p>
<p>and I also was</p>
<p>um taking your electrolyte because I was</p>
<p>having cramping and like the woman</p>
<p>Joanna who posed the question</p>
<p>I all of a sudden traded off all my</p>
<p>great sleep</p>
<p>for a very loose bowel issues so I</p>
<p>figured it must have been the Magnesium</p>
<p>Citrate because you even have a video</p>
<p>about magnesium citrate and how it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>laxative</p>
<p>however I don&rsquo;t want to give up my sleep</p>
<p>and I just wanted to tell you that I now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking the adrenal stress I take</p>
<p>three plus one sleep aid and I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>sleeping great but I and I&rsquo;ve done the</p>
<p>kefir you you have a video about what to</p>
<p>take and things to try</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;ve done the key for the</p>
<p>blackberries I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve gone through the</p>
<p>gamut I&rsquo;m taking something to bind me</p>
<p>I just I&rsquo;m so afraid to completely stop</p>
<p>all the supplements that are helping me</p>
<p>to sleep so my question is what do I do</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to trade off my</p>
<p>sleep</p>
<p>so I think the best thing to do</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s most likely the Magnesium</p>
<p>Citrate which is in the electrolyte</p>
<p>powder so what you can do take that one</p>
<p>put it to the side for a little bit</p>
<p>until you re-establish your your system</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re good which might take a couple</p>
<p>days then at that point</p>
<p>um maybe you take a good amount less so</p>
<p>we take less of that</p>
<p>um if there is a problem with slate the</p>
<p>the other form of magnesium that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>create diarrhea is magnesium glycinate</p>
<p>so glycinate and uh that one helps sleep</p>
<p>big time</p>
<p>just like magnesium citrate but without</p>
<p>the laxative effect</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>and I know one of the problems with</p>
<p>having loose bowels is that you lose</p>
<p>your electrolytes so now we have to</p>
<p>replace those so it&rsquo;s kind of like a</p>
<p>double-edged sword so here we have</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I have a product that has uh something</p>
<p>in there that is really good for people</p>
<p>with constipation but it might might be</p>
<p>too much so I would reintroduce maybe</p>
<p>start off with like a quarter of it just</p>
<p>a quarter of it and with a quarter of a</p>
<p>little uh scooper with the electrolyte</p>
<p>when you start re introducing and see if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an issue I doubt it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a problem but I think you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>getting too much magnesium citrate</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s one solution and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think um magnesium citrate is in any</p>
<p>other products it&rsquo;s in um I&rsquo;m sorry I um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obsessed with your product so</p>
<p>just wanted you to know that there is in</p>
<p>the sleep aid there&rsquo;s seven milligrams</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why I went down to one</p>
<p>um and then</p>
<p>um I take a cocktail of different things</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s your magnesium glycinate so</p>
<p>okay so</p>
<p>um you might might be getting a little</p>
<p>too much magnesium but I think um that</p>
<p>that small amount in the Sleep formula</p>
<p>is so small that would not create a</p>
<p>problem but in the electrolyte powder</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s higher amounts that might be the</p>
<p>source so that&rsquo;s the one I would just</p>
<p>kind of put to the side for a little bit</p>
<p>and I think that should solve solve the</p>
<p>issue</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>um maybe you also at the same time just</p>
<p>take</p>
<p>one of the capsules of the Magnesium</p>
<p>glycinate so that way you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a good amount but not</p>
<p>like too much and you can just kind of</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>cope with that a little bit as you</p>
<p>re-establish things um</p>
<p>um and I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>getting magnesium from your diet too</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re following it so you can imagine</p>
<p>like you might just be getting</p>
<p>accumulated accumulating just a bit too</p>
<p>much magnesium in general</p>
<p>okay because it relaxes muscles and</p>
<p>smooth muscles of the colon</p>
<p>um so if you&rsquo;re doing like for example</p>
<p>just three cups of leafy greens will</p>
<p>give you about</p>
<p>400 milligrams of potassium so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you&rsquo;re doing seven to ten cups</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re getting a lot of</p>
<p>potassium you might be getting a little</p>
<p>too much</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s great well June thank</p>
<p>you so much and we hope that works out</p>
<p>and and of course you demonstrated to</p>
<p>the audience that you can come back if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got some follow-up answers uh you</p>
<p>know for us so thank you for being such</p>
<p>a great contestant if that&rsquo;s what we</p>
<p>call you that&rsquo;s a wonderful let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>quiz question number one uh created a</p>
<p>stir people looked at that and answered</p>
<p>it and then asked what is the one Trace</p>
<p>mineral that the Japanese who are all so</p>
<p>annoyingly healthy consume 20 more 20</p>
<p>times more of and it&rsquo;s 57 say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fermented foods like NATO natto 33 foods</p>
<p>rich in iodine that&rsquo;s what I guessed and</p>
<p>10 say fish or fish oils any winners</p>
<p>okay the winners uh are iodine they</p>
<p>consume 20 times more iodine than than</p>
<p>most other countries so that&rsquo;s in Sea</p>
<p>calpin c c vegetables so iodine is um</p>
<p>very very interesting because it greatly</p>
<p>significantly reduces the risk of breast</p>
<p>cancer prostate cancer stomach cancer it</p>
<p>helps your thyroid it helps</p>
<p>regulate excessive amounts of estrogen</p>
<p>so it does a lot</p>
<p>um but I think</p>
<p>we could take good advice from them and</p>
<p>start consuming more foods rich in</p>
<p>iodine sea kelp is a no-brainer but um</p>
<p>make sure if you&rsquo;re doing a seek help uh</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s from seaweed coming from a</p>
<p>part of our oceans that are in the clean</p>
<p>because sometimes there could be heavy</p>
<p>metals involved so you want a good</p>
<p>source very good speaking of which is</p>
<p>there better controls over Farm fish I</p>
<p>remember you were talking about last</p>
<p>week it&rsquo;s kind of gray salmon but is it</p>
<p>otherwise safer in terms of mercury or</p>
<p>the other elements to have a farm</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s not safer there is more</p>
<p>omega-3 but there&rsquo;s also way too much</p>
<p>omega-6 in farm fish farm-raised fish so</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s uh it comes with a package</p>
<p>um and uh also you know why is it gray</p>
<p>why do they have to add synthetic</p>
<p>pigments coloring well because people</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t eat it number one and why is it</p>
<p>gray in the first place because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not eating what normal fish eat and so</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to eat food or fish or plants</p>
<p>whatever that doesn&rsquo;t really come in the</p>
<p>natural form</p>
<p>is it healthy I I don&rsquo;t think it is so</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s hard to get health from things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t necessarily grown in a</p>
<p>healthy way that&rsquo;s just my theory</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sticking to it Steve all right</p>
<p>very good okay let&rsquo;s see uh Sandra from</p>
<p>Facebook my husband gets pins and</p>
<p>needles feelings in his hands at night</p>
<p>at night time what could be the cause of</p>
<p>this condition</p>
<p>that is called peripheral peripheral</p>
<p>neuropathy and</p>
<p>most the time it&rsquo;s related to blood</p>
<p>sugars and pre-diabetes or insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>so in that case you would want to change</p>
<p>your diet get off the sugar and refine</p>
<p>carbs get on keto intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and also take benefit mean</p>
<p>and maybe even alpha lipoic acid</p>
<p>together those uh that benfotamine which</p>
<p>is a B vitamin will help correct that as</p>
<p>long as you correct your diet but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say for example you&rsquo;re already on keto</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s going great and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the problem which is a smaller</p>
<p>percentage of this time and you still</p>
<p>have these these symptoms pins and</p>
<p>needles then you need to look at</p>
<p>calcium because</p>
<p>hypercalcemia too much calcium can</p>
<p>create the same symptoms which is</p>
<p>interesting so that&rsquo;s just another cause</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more rare</p>
<p>so I have a video on that you can search</p>
<p>that out all right very good let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>Rachel from YouTube I have been insulin</p>
<p>resistant and have Hashimoto&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>on keto for four months but still have</p>
<p>low blood sugar levels any suggestions</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d recommend Dr Berg</p>
<p>well some people are concerned about</p>
<p>this hypoglycemia and I&rsquo;m not talking</p>
<p>about those that are a diabetic type 1</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re taking insulin they have</p>
<p>to take it and also to get on keto and</p>
<p>it ends up low well then they go oh my</p>
<p>gosh that&rsquo;s dangerous and I have to take</p>
<p>more medication well why don&rsquo;t you just</p>
<p>cut back on the insulin that&rsquo;s pushing</p>
<p>it down</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d Be A New Concept but for everyone</p>
<p>else if you end up with low blood sugar</p>
<p>and you feel good which is the majority</p>
<p>of the time that&rsquo;s a normal response</p>
<p>when you start reducing the amount of</p>
<p>carbohydrate in your diet your blood</p>
<p>sugars will come down sometimes even in</p>
<p>the 60s</p>
<p>and this is your new normal</p>
<p>is it unhealthy no</p>
<p>um maybe if you feel like weak and tired</p>
<p>you need to eat but the point is that</p>
<p>that hypoglycemia thing</p>
<p>is uh really uh caused by higher levels</p>
<p>of insulin that are pushing that blood</p>
<p>sugar down so when you correct that with</p>
<p>keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your your uh your system will come back</p>
<p>and balance and uh you&rsquo;ll find that you</p>
<p>just won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um need that that sugar at one at 80</p>
<p>anymore it can go down a little bit</p>
<p>lower and you&rsquo;ll feel fine so you have</p>
<p>to you you have to use common sense and</p>
<p>judgment and look at the whole picture</p>
<p>um and just because your blood sugars</p>
<p>are low if you feel fine</p>
<p>why would you want to raise them now</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s your new normal that makes</p>
<p>sense well I forgot that our friend in</p>
<p>Canada Bindi</p>
<p>excuse me is at work and so I just let</p>
<p>him sit there and rot while I took</p>
<p>another collar that was just terrible</p>
<p>Bindi I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg with your brief</p>
<p>question go ahead Mindy</p>
<p>yeah thanks for taking my call here so I</p>
<p>got two tests done that you recommend I</p>
<p>got the calcium the cactus done which my</p>
<p>score came as zero then I got the</p>
<p>particle size test done which I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>little bit confused about so my LDL p8</p>
<p>came around 3 000 Nemo per liter and my</p>
<p>small ldlp came around 1100 Nano moles</p>
<p>per liter</p>
<p>and my LDL size is 20.6</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s something to be concerned</p>
<p>about or</p>
<p>so your your your small dense particle</p>
<p>size are less than your</p>
<p>your large buoyant correct</p>
<p>uh large buoyant</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>okay well that&rsquo;s good that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>um because</p>
<p>um even like when and this is a</p>
<p>confusion a lot of people have when they</p>
<p>measure their cholesterol</p>
<p>um cholesterol does not exist in the</p>
<p>blood by itself it&rsquo;s in a package with</p>
<p>protein so it can move around so then</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re dealing with the LDL</p>
<p>and LDL is uh comes in different sizes</p>
<p>and um yeah if it&rsquo;s the large buoyant</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot less uh going to penetrate</p>
<p>the inside of your endothelial wall and</p>
<p>the arteries</p>
<p>so the fact that your large buoyant is</p>
<p>greater than your small dents this is a</p>
<p>really good thing also the fact that</p>
<p>your CAC which is a coronary artery</p>
<p>calcification test is zero is a really</p>
<p>good thing too it means you&rsquo;d have no</p>
<p>calcium in your arteries which is</p>
<p>um that test is probably one of the best</p>
<p>predictors of mortality so that means</p>
<p>chances are there&rsquo;s no inflammation</p>
<p>going on to for your body to accumulate</p>
<p>calcium in the first place or</p>
<p>or any type of clotting or any of that</p>
<p>stuff so</p>
<p>um it sounds like you&rsquo;re in pretty good</p>
<p>shape</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>perfect thank you I appreciate that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thank you so much bendy and</p>
<p>by the way I don&rsquo;t know where you should</p>
<p>advertise but it looks like you worked</p>
<p>for Ashley Furniture and I got my living</p>
<p>room filled from that great company I</p>
<p>really love them so um Ashley if you</p>
<p>want to send me a free easy chair or</p>
<p>something for saying that I sure</p>
<p>appreciate it all right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>move on</p>
<p>uh and that was a hint for you airbendi</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be expecting that you have my</p>
<p>address all right next Quiz question</p>
<p>please and here it is</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>what is the best healing</p>
<p>and repair food as it relates to</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>simple enough</p>
<p>climb on that audience let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>the Green Room this time Christina is</p>
<p>coming to us from Spain</p>
<p>Christina let me see oh There She Goes</p>
<p>her head popped up from her business and</p>
<p>there you go you&rsquo;re all with Dr Berg one</p>
<p>quick question 30 seconds go</p>
<p>yes what is the best way to lose a belly</p>
<p>fat because I have a lot and</p>
<p>seems very slow since I have</p>
<p>heco Motors</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>it was Hashimoto&rsquo;s I believe the the</p>
<p>best thing is to um first of all with</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s surprise the most important</p>
<p>thing and this would be</p>
<p>completely handled when you did my</p>
<p>healthy version of the ketogenic diet is</p>
<p>get off the gluten and the grains cut</p>
<p>the grains out no grains and I know they</p>
<p>probably don&rsquo;t have a lot of grains in</p>
<p>Spain so I think you&rsquo;re safe on that</p>
<p>that was a sarcasm</p>
<p>um but um also I think I would I would</p>
<p>do the</p>
<p>um low carb I would cut out the</p>
<p>carbohydrates and also any and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about sugars but not the</p>
<p>vegetables so if you do a lot of uh meat</p>
<p>meats and uh</p>
<p>high quality sausage especially that you</p>
<p>have over there that&rsquo;s really healthy</p>
<p>and the olive oil and all that and then</p>
<p>low carb you&rsquo;re going to start to um</p>
<p>lose weight okay and primarily it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be first of the liver and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to notice your stomach</p>
<p>started to reduce so you want to get on</p>
<p>a healthy ketogenic diet and you could</p>
<p>find that right on my website and get</p>
<p>the carbs down I would get the carbs</p>
<p>down to like 10 grams per day then what</p>
<p>you do is you add in a lot of walking</p>
<p>um in fact I don&rsquo;t know if you know this</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a place in Spain where you</p>
<p>can actually even walk across the entire</p>
<p>um country I think I think it&rsquo;s the 12</p>
<p>Day walk if I&rsquo;m not mistaken you should</p>
<p>get on that walk because walking is one</p>
<p>of the best things to also help reduce</p>
<p>your your stomach weight as well</p>
<p>um and that way you could focus on</p>
<p>a lot of that so the combination of both</p>
<p>of those</p>
<p>um but I think uh you should just jump</p>
<p>on that start now and I think um you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be pleasantly surprised how it helps</p>
<p>your belly</p>
<p>all right well okay thank you</p>
<p>Christina she is at the world record</p>
<p>with the most succinct question boy</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re proud of you let&rsquo;s give her a bell</p>
<p>ring for that that was great and that</p>
<p>helps us get excuse me everything done</p>
<p>on the show now I have a frog in my</p>
<p>throat okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see how about back to social media</p>
<p>Sparky from YouTube please share your</p>
<p>suggestions for Stress Management</p>
<p>sort of a big question</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great book uh it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>relax and win by a</p>
<p>um Olympic coach and I really like his</p>
<p>philosophy he&rsquo;s worked with many many</p>
<p>Olympic athletes and helped athletes</p>
<p>become record world record holders I</p>
<p>think it was like was it I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken 17 world record holders so</p>
<p>obviously he&rsquo;s doing something right and</p>
<p>he really has to train his athletes on</p>
<p>how to relax more while they&rsquo;re training</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re recovering during the</p>
<p>match before the match so I think um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a a mind shift of</p>
<p>start focusing on your breathing don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take things so serious uh have a very</p>
<p>Carefree attitude towards life don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch the news or things that are</p>
<p>talking about bad news hang out with</p>
<p>people that are not so darn negative and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to help you now from a diet</p>
<p>standpoint</p>
<p>keto is going to help reduce the</p>
<p>sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>ashwagandha is one of the best herbs</p>
<p>that you can take as an adaptogen and of</p>
<p>course</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s many other things you</p>
<p>can take like lemon balm tea is a great</p>
<p>one for stress as well but um I think</p>
<p>those are my quick tips of the day for</p>
<p>that well that&rsquo;s great news is one of</p>
<p>the mental sufferers around the world I</p>
<p>just always like to reiterate that it is</p>
<p>the best antidepressant that I have ever</p>
<p>found is following uh Dr Berg&rsquo;s various</p>
<p>regimes intermittent fasting for me and</p>
<p>lower sugar I can&rsquo;t call myself keto but</p>
<p>when I eat a bunch of sugar I feel like</p>
<p>crap for days and I I am not depressed</p>
<p>when I am fairly</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know diligent on following them so</p>
<p>anybody that&rsquo;s listening just wondering</p>
<p>well I don&rsquo;t care if my stomach sticks</p>
<p>out how about your mood if you want to</p>
<p>see that improve enormously uh give this</p>
<p>thing a shot and if it didn&rsquo;t work Dr</p>
<p>Berg will gladly refund your misery</p>
<p>so that is a great guarantee right well</p>
<p>also you take the nutritional yeast</p>
<p>which is full of the vitamins especially</p>
<p>B1 oh yeah that&rsquo;s the thing I forgot</p>
<p>about the B1 is uh it&rsquo;s a nutritional</p>
<p>yeast is uh Dynamite for instant stress</p>
<p>relief you&rsquo;ll feel like within three</p>
<p>minutes you just feel like a sense of</p>
<p>relief I can breathe again it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>um effect I used to use in practice all</p>
<p>the time but</p>
<p>um that that&rsquo;s a no-brainer that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it works nearly 100 of the time when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrific okay quiz question number</p>
<p>two asked what is the best healing</p>
<p>repair food as it relates to exercise</p>
<p>and our audience 65 percent of them say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a form of protein like meat or eggs</p>
<p>25 say healthy fats five percent say</p>
<p>leafy vegetables like spinach and five</p>
<p>percent say foods rich in creatine</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re absolutely right it is meat</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s definitely red meat red meat</p>
<p>has one of the best Healers of anything</p>
<p>or exercise recovery I mean think about</p>
<p>what red meat is it&rsquo;s muscle meat and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s red what is that redness that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>iron that is um loaded with B12</p>
<p>um and it&rsquo;s the most bioavailable B12</p>
<p>and iron that you can have plus it has</p>
<p>the more concentrated amino acids than</p>
<p>even eggs so it&rsquo;s better to recover than</p>
<p>even eating eggs so um and also I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never in practice found any patient ever</p>
<p>allergic to red meat or meat in general</p>
<p>um definitely eggs and shellfish and soy</p>
<p>and these other things but not red meat</p>
<p>now some people</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that red meat is</p>
<p>carcinogenic or they&rsquo;ve been told that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s bad for you it&rsquo;s unhealthy</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>the hot dogs you&rsquo;re getting at 7-Eleven</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about uh grass-fed quality</p>
<p>red meat as we get older we lose the</p>
<p>stomach acid to digest it and then our</p>
<p>taste for it might go down</p>
<p>um so just take butane hydrochloride</p>
<p>increase the stomach acid but I will say</p>
<p>that for healing especially as someone</p>
<p>ages that I think red meat would be a</p>
<p>good solution in general there are</p>
<p>certain other conditions that are um</p>
<p>that maybe you might do better with fish</p>
<p>especially if you have more inflammation</p>
<p>but generally speaking if we compare the</p>
<p>two there&rsquo;s more uh concentrated amino</p>
<p>acids more concentrated nutrition as</p>
<p>well as omega-3 than many many other</p>
<p>types of protein so I will create a</p>
<p>video on that and uh</p>
<p>share that data with you but I consume a</p>
<p>lot of red meat but it&rsquo;s in the form of</p>
<p>hamburger</p>
<p>um of course from my own Farm but you</p>
<p>can get it from</p>
<p>you know U.S Wellness meats you can</p>
<p>order online or even like just at the</p>
<p>farmer&rsquo;s market or even at the grocery</p>
<p>store but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty um good for</p>
<p>Recovery because those amino acids and</p>
<p>all the cofactors that allow it to work</p>
<p>versus doing protein powder like way</p>
<p>without all these co-factors cofactors</p>
<p>are the key to allow these amino acids</p>
<p>to really be activated in your body so</p>
<p>stay tuned for a more depth video on</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>the the recently uh very popular doctor</p>
<p>Jordan Peterson I just heard him the</p>
<p>other day he&rsquo;s been on red meat for five</p>
<p>years straight that&rsquo;s all he eats and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s enormously healthy he reports and</p>
<p>he looks at and it doesn&rsquo;t appear that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s succumbed to cancer or anything</p>
<p>else awful so that just amazes me but he</p>
<p>just eats red meat and he did mention</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you know high quality but anyway</p>
<p>that that really surprised me what an</p>
<p>amazing thing that is he&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a uh</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing the carnivore diet because of</p>
<p>his digestive problems</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s doing it um I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m half carnivore and half vegan so if</p>
<p>you can you put them together I&rsquo;m I ate</p>
<p>the plants and the and the meat and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother me and I like it</p>
<p>for various reasons but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to say about</p>
<p>that Steve well what do you have to say</p>
<p>about this doc our next question</p>
<p>okay all right so right when the uh</p>
<p>dog is barking okay which food contains</p>
<p>the greatest amount of vitamin A</p>
<p>that was pretty simple audience climb on</p>
<p>that please</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Tina from Fresno on YouTube</p>
<p>oh wait did I read that I think I did 65</p>
<p>pounds in the last year I did I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>Terry you popped it back up but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth hearing about</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see um oh and see what happens you</p>
<p>mentioned who&rsquo;s watching and other</p>
<p>people say hey what about me a shout out</p>
<p>to our viewers joining us today from</p>
<p>Italy uh uh Moldova Estonia Sri Lanka</p>
<p>ice Iceland I was about to say Iceberg</p>
<p>thinking of lettuce Greece and finally</p>
<p>Bangladesh so thank you all for joining</p>
<p>in and enjoying the great health that</p>
<p>has spawned from all of our discussions</p>
<p>here on the Dr Berg live show okay uh</p>
<p>how about Isabel uh she wants to know</p>
<p>from Facebook by the way what&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>natural way to treat diverticulosis</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s a that is a problem with</p>
<p>your digestive system it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>involving inflammation needing Scar</p>
<p>Tissue so glutamine is the best hand</p>
<p>hands down uh remedy for leaky gut and</p>
<p>irritation to the colon okay so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thing as a supplement but the other</p>
<p>thing is you probably want to do the</p>
<p>carnivore diet for about two months do</p>
<p>it healthily and that will help heal the</p>
<p>stomach because you might have a problem</p>
<p>with them</p>
<p>uh plants and they can act irritate your</p>
<p>colon</p>
<p>okay well good luck with that let&rsquo;s move</p>
<p>on here Terry I don&rsquo;t know how you type</p>
<p>so much stuff it&rsquo;s unbelievable uh</p>
<p>we talked to about Stress Management</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see diverticulated smell now wow</p>
<p>sorry folks I should be better prepared</p>
<p>your time&rsquo;s valuable Spider-Man 83 from</p>
<p>YouTube</p>
<p>um it just popped up Tara you told me</p>
<p>not to scroll back up and I just did it</p>
<p>so let me look down here okay thank you</p>
<p>Terry he got fed me another Marcella</p>
<p>from YouTube I was curious if you had</p>
<p>any special recommendations for diets</p>
<p>for dogs I&rsquo;m hoping uh you might have</p>
<p>some suggestions that something to talk</p>
<p>about Don</p>
<p>yeah dogs do uh do not they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>vegans they&rsquo;re not vegetarians they do</p>
<p>good on meat and organ meats and if you</p>
<p>could find a dog food that is</p>
<p>freeze-dried that&rsquo;s even better but um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to do uh actually I might have</p>
<p>done a video on this already but I do</p>
<p>have a dog food that seems to work well</p>
<p>but unfortunately a lot of them are are</p>
<p>not freeze-dried so you get uh you tend</p>
<p>to get this over cooked uh and then they</p>
<p>add soy on there and gluten and all</p>
<p>sorts of things that dogs don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>have in their diet so</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination of meat and organ</p>
<p>Meats would be the best</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s terrific now our final</p>
<p>Green Room contestant is Tammy and I</p>
<p>must do a shout out to her husband who</p>
<p>acted as the I.T professional and got I</p>
<p>got her set up proving that men are</p>
<p>worth more than just belching and</p>
<p>drinking beer so thank you sir for</p>
<p>helping her out and uh let&rsquo;s see let me</p>
<p>bring her on and there you are and it</p>
<p>sounds like you&rsquo;re on muted go ahead</p>
<p>with your one question in 30 seconds</p>
<p>Tammy</p>
<p>good morning Dr Burke I&rsquo;ve watched you</p>
<p>for a few years and thank you for having</p>
<p>me my question to you is I am type 2</p>
<p>diabetic I have</p>
<p>neuropathy retinopathy charcoal in the</p>
<p>left foot high blood pressure and now</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>low functioning</p>
<p>kidneys at 29 my GFR and I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>conflicted between I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m well versed</p>
<p>with fasting</p>
<p>and but I&rsquo;m conflicted between Keto</p>
<p>and Whole Food plant-based</p>
<p>um can you kind of help me with that and</p>
<p>why why do you choose keto I yeah</p>
<p>yeah well if you take a look at just uh</p>
<p>the problem that you have you have</p>
<p>diabetes right diabetes is one problem</p>
<p>so if we take a look at what diabetes is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a disease of high sugar okay so it</p>
<p>involves insulin involves carbohydrates</p>
<p>and so naturally the solution would be</p>
<p>to reduce the amount of carbohydrates</p>
<p>because the need for medication will go</p>
<p>down</p>
<p>um and so now the question is how do you</p>
<p>do that do you do it with plants uh well</p>
<p>plants are necessary to help you for</p>
<p>sure but you also need um</p>
<p>protein high quality protein simply</p>
<p>because when you have insulin resistance</p>
<p>now you can&rsquo;t pull in these amino acids</p>
<p>so what would give you the most</p>
<p>bioavailable proteins of anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the question and that would be animal</p>
<p>products because it&rsquo;s very difficult to</p>
<p>get the sufficient high quality amino</p>
<p>acids as well as the B12 and these other</p>
<p>things that normally come from animal</p>
<p>products so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there are diabetics that that can do</p>
<p>plant-based but it&rsquo;s more difficult</p>
<p>because of the also the grains that are</p>
<p>involved and the digestive problems with</p>
<p>um that come and go come along with the</p>
<p>beans and legumes and things like that</p>
<p>but there it&rsquo;s a possible it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>lot more difficult so I think it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be easier for you to do this uh with</p>
<p>um a combination of plants and proteins</p>
<p>from meats and eggs and fish</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s my take on it and then</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re still confused then why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you for yourself try out one</p>
<p>method for a while see how you do and</p>
<p>then try out the other method and see</p>
<p>which works better for you then you</p>
<p>really will know and you don&rsquo;t even have</p>
<p>to wait for the next scientific study to</p>
<p>come out but I will say for that</p>
<p>neuropathy that you have as a quick</p>
<p>solution Ben otamine is a really good</p>
<p>remedy and you can get it anywhere</p>
<p>online benfotamine and just take four of</p>
<p>those a day spread them out and give it</p>
<p>about a week or two and see what happens</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll be pleasantly surprised</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s awesome thank you I appreciate</p>
<p>it can you direct me to uh</p>
<p>um specific book</p>
<p>um for the clean keto yeah I just happen</p>
<p>to have one it&rsquo;s called the keto the</p>
<p>healthy keto plant</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s right on my website or it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>Amazon but uh yeah I do have a book on</p>
<p>that that gives you the details and you</p>
<p>can even while you&rsquo;re waiting for that</p>
<p>book you can actually go to my website</p>
<p>under videos and there&rsquo;s a video that</p>
<p>says start here</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;d start and then</p>
<p>when you get done with that video</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be video number two and then</p>
<p>three and then at least you&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to get into it pretty quick</p>
<p>alrighty</p>
<p>um so you you really feel that</p>
<p>um having kidney function problems like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stage four that it would be safe for</p>
<p>me to do them so the there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely you need to help with</p>
<p>your doctor because</p>
<p>um when you start getting up there with</p>
<p>kidney disease then you need some help</p>
<p>to make sure you&rsquo;re not taking too much</p>
<p>of this versus that and that usually is</p>
<p>stage five is the problem that you need</p>
<p>to really but stage four is borderline</p>
<p>so I would get with your doctor to make</p>
<p>sure but</p>
<p>um you know what I&rsquo;m recommending is a</p>
<p>healthy diet that is not not necessarily</p>
<p>taking large amounts of vitamins we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just talking about a diet itself and so</p>
<p>um like I didn&rsquo;t even mention potassium</p>
<p>at all I&rsquo;m just talking about the diet</p>
<p>um but if you even take a look at one</p>
<p>more piece of data</p>
<p>um the number one cause of kidney</p>
<p>disease is diabetes right</p>
<p>so you really need something that can</p>
<p>fix your diabetes and the healthy</p>
<p>version of the ketogenic diet is is</p>
<p>really your answer</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s kind of where you want to</p>
<p>go because that&rsquo;s like at the root of</p>
<p>the problem that&rsquo;s great well Tammy</p>
<p>thank you so much sure appreciate you</p>
<p>coming along with us we gotta move along</p>
<p>here and Tammy I want you to watch this</p>
<p>too because you&rsquo;re going to get the</p>
<p>exciting answer from quiz question</p>
<p>number three which asks which food</p>
<p>contains the greatest amount of vitamin</p>
<p>A and I immediately thought Bugs Bunny</p>
<p>in the carrots the audience differed 55</p>
<p>percent of respondents say it&rsquo;s beef</p>
<p>liver 25 say cod liver or cod liver oil</p>
<p>10 say eggs or dairy and 10 say parsley</p>
<p>well eggs are egg yolk is a really good</p>
<p>source of vitamin A okay even more than</p>
<p>meat but</p>
<p>liver as in beef liver has 70 times more</p>
<p>vitamin A dang so the answer is liver</p>
<p>and uh uh I I wish I liked liver I would</p>
<p>have some but I don&rsquo;t so I&rsquo;ll stick with</p>
<p>my eggs but if you have a little liver a</p>
<p>couple times a week Steve you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>enough vitamin A to get you through any</p>
<p>deficiency problem that you have and</p>
<p>remember vitamin A is um</p>
<p>will help you see in the dark at night</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re driving and so also it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for your skin it&rsquo;s good for the</p>
<p>immune system and any type of</p>
<p>problem that you have with your inner</p>
<p>skin like the esophagus the inside of</p>
<p>the colon inside of the mouth the</p>
<p>sinuses especially the lungs vitamin A</p>
<p>is a really important but I never would</p>
<p>recommend taking vitamin A as a</p>
<p>supplement</p>
<p>but anytime you do you&rsquo;ll see that it</p>
<p>says beta-carotene we&rsquo;ll realize that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a precursor that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about like retinol we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the precursor so you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about that I&rsquo;m but you do have to</p>
<p>worry about some of these synthetic</p>
<p>versions of vitamin A that people take</p>
<p>in supplements I don&rsquo;t recommend those</p>
<p>when that&rsquo;s interesting you spoke or</p>
<p>someone did of diverticulitis and</p>
<p>everyone seems to have it at least guys</p>
<p>do when you have a</p>
<p>colonoscopy but a friend of mine it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more serious and you can think his</p>
<p>intestines or his colon blew up he was</p>
<p>on a colostomy he almost died from</p>
<p>infection it was a big big deal so</p>
<p>taking care of your gut you know is more</p>
<p>than just reading the sheet I guess but</p>
<p>that scared me so he he was in tough</p>
<p>shape for almost a year before he</p>
<p>finally got sewn back together so do you</p>
<p>know what you know what the best food</p>
<p>for the for that condition would be of</p>
<p>any food on the planet Earth would be</p>
<p>Raw</p>
<p>sauerkraut huh</p>
<p>and you can when you buy sauerkraut you</p>
<p>go to the store don&rsquo;t get the ones that</p>
<p>are sitting on the shelf that have</p>
<p>preservatives those are are sterilized</p>
<p>the benefit of the sauerkraut is all the</p>
<p>microbes but you have to go to the</p>
<p>healthy store for that or make it your</p>
<p>own</p>
<p>um yourself but you buy it um a high</p>
<p>quality sauerkraut and just have a</p>
<p>little bit before you eat really really</p>
<p>amazing for your gut way more microbes</p>
<p>than any probiotic you can take it is a</p>
<p>probiotic and it&rsquo;s a Prebiotic and the</p>
<p>other thing</p>
<p>which is the icing on the cake is the</p>
<p>Cabbage that they use for that</p>
<p>sauerkraut cabbage happens to be</p>
<p>um very unique in certain things that</p>
<p>heal the colon and the stomach and</p>
<p>gastritis</p>
<p>um anytime someone has a problem with</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>they will have problems with vegetables</p>
<p>but somehow they&rsquo;re okay with cabbage in</p>
<p>different forms so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s just a side tip stage for</p>
<p>for someone that they&rsquo;re if you want a</p>
<p>good idea on that well they should</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of diverticulitis and</p>
<p>among those I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people</p>
<p>suffering so thank you Dr Berg and</p>
<p>audience this is exciting it&rsquo;s a true</p>
<p>falsa which means you have a 50 chance</p>
<p>of being smart even if you&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>okay true or false it is not uncommon</p>
<p>for grocery store eggs to be 60 days old</p>
<p>before you buy them</p>
<p>interesting I heard that they peel</p>
<p>easier if you leave them in the</p>
<p>refrigerator later I mean they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hard-boiled but who knows I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll tell us all about that and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to social media</p>
<p>uh Miriam from YouTube I was told that</p>
<p>she needs a knee replacement what are</p>
<p>your thoughts on the impact of</p>
<p>artificial joints on the rest of the</p>
<p>body how big a deal is that</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>you mean she&rsquo;s considering getting</p>
<p>artificial joints and other joints well</p>
<p>she needs a knee replacement she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>worried about in addition to the knee</p>
<p>what does it do to her otherwise</p>
<p>well I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it really depends on your situation I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not qualified to tell you one way or the</p>
<p>other it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>surgery and uh you have to be pretty</p>
<p>healthy to go through a surgery uh to</p>
<p>recover from that but um some people</p>
<p>need it because the joint is bone on</p>
<p>bone but you know I will say uh one</p>
<p>thing that I would recommend looking</p>
<p>into is stem cell for your joints I am</p>
<p>blown away at what that can do and of</p>
<p>course if you are going to consider that</p>
<p>you want to research the type</p>
<p>mesenchymal stem cell which is involving</p>
<p>taking your own fat spinning it down</p>
<p>with enzymes to then pull through stem</p>
<p>cells and put them back in you so I just</p>
<p>had it done</p>
<p>and so far so good I need another month</p>
<p>to report back and I will do a video on</p>
<p>that but stem cell is fascinating for</p>
<p>for anything arthritis joint so many</p>
<p>different problems</p>
<p>um to help heal heal the body</p>
<p>um so anyway that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>possibly take a look at all right very</p>
<p>good we have a worldwide consensus the</p>
<p>last question to which they answered</p>
<p>almost instantly true false it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>uncommon for grocery store eggs to be 60</p>
<p>days old before you buy them 100 of the</p>
<p>audience say that that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s no um</p>
<p>exact law that states that you have to</p>
<p>even put an expiration date on it and so</p>
<p>uh unfortunately a lot of these</p>
<p>commercial eggs sit on the Shelf</p>
<p>for quite some time I mean that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy to even think about that</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>of course I get my own eggs if I like</p>
<p>the eggs that I eat have been</p>
<p>around for a couple days and uh if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wash them they last for</p>
<p>you know a good good amount of time but</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;d want to put them in the</p>
<p>refrigerator eventually to help them</p>
<p>last longer but the point is 60 days is</p>
<p>kind of old</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you have to there&rsquo;s a huge difference</p>
<p>between the commercial eggs that you buy</p>
<p>conventional eggs and the eggs that are</p>
<p>pastured raised</p>
<p>organic there&rsquo;s a huge difference</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so you</p>
<p>you know if even if we take a regular</p>
<p>egg and that&rsquo;s you know that these poor</p>
<p>chickens are in cages okay they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>cages right their whole life they never</p>
<p>see the light of day those can&rsquo;t be good</p>
<p>but then you have cage free</p>
<p>uh cage-free allows them one square foot</p>
<p>of space okay so they don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>in the cage but they&rsquo;re still in this</p>
<p>Barn where you have sometimes up to 20</p>
<p>to 30 to 80 to 100 000 chickens in one</p>
<p>space right that can&rsquo;t be healthy but</p>
<p>then you have free range which allows</p>
<p>maybe a hole in the barn where they can</p>
<p>stick their head out and see outside for</p>
<p>a little bit</p>
<p>and then we have pasture pastured raised</p>
<p>which allows the chicken to have</p>
<p>108 foot per chicken square foot so that</p>
<p>gives them a much more more space to</p>
<p>roam around</p>
<p>um to eat insects and bugs and things</p>
<p>like that so unfortunately there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big difference I would not</p>
<p>consume a commercial chicken egg I would</p>
<p>always do a pastured raised and if I</p>
<p>could I would also add that word organic</p>
<p>um for various reasons and that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to relate to the next question that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to bring up</p>
<p>all right very good uh and here&rsquo;s our</p>
<p>final one of the day a true falser</p>
<p>here we go true or false animal waste is</p>
<p>a common ingredient in animal feeds</p>
<p>okay well that&rsquo;s the last time I take a</p>
<p>little bite out of my cat&rsquo;s Purina can</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s off the table now after reading</p>
<p>that so you can only pray we&rsquo;re not just</p>
<p>talking about that Steve we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about any animal feeds oh like how do</p>
<p>they throw yeah yeah chickens you know</p>
<p>that type of stuff all right very good</p>
<p>audience gross but I want you to hold</p>
<p>your nose and answer the question as</p>
<p>honestly as you can</p>
<p>all right back to YouTube KL from</p>
<p>YouTube what&rsquo;s the best way to add</p>
<p>stinging nettle root to our diets</p>
<p>it is supplements you can even grow it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably already in your backyard</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know it you should take a</p>
<p>see what it looks like it&rsquo;s growing all</p>
<p>around where I am and let&rsquo;s say you had</p>
<p>arthritis in your hands you could just</p>
<p>take some of that and just rub it around</p>
<p>your hands it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll create a</p>
<p>little numbness but it&rsquo;s great for</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis or you can even</p>
<p>cook it or steam it and have it in a tea</p>
<p>or buy it as a tea but um that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>much the the ways I would recommend it</p>
<p>um but it&rsquo;s quite effective for</p>
<p>arthritis and inflammation it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>potent anti-inflammatory stinging nettle</p>
<p>root</p>
<p>all right very good Faye Julie in</p>
<p>Bangladesh on Facebook Dr Berg we are</p>
<p>experiencing an outbreak of dingy fever</p>
<p>throughout the country what would you</p>
<p>recommend we do to protect ourselves</p>
<p>I would start uh number one increasing a</p>
<p>lot of garlic in your diet</p>
<p>oregano oil</p>
<p>and vitamin D3 in large amounts that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would do if I were you there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>many other things you can take as well</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh like black walnut Halls</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>I I have a video on on</p>
<p>that topic you can search that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how old it is but that might give</p>
<p>you more detailed information</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see Paulette</p>
<p>from Facebook my husband has a sharp</p>
<p>pain under his left rib cage his doctor</p>
<p>felt the area and said he could feel</p>
<p>spasms he took a muscle relaxer and that</p>
<p>helped with the pain but now he has</p>
<p>constipation what are your thoughts</p>
<p>about this condition</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>you got to find out what&rsquo;s causing it I</p>
<p>mean that that&rsquo;s an area that&rsquo;s could be</p>
<p>referred from the heart so you might</p>
<p>want to get a evaluation of the heart</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important you have the</p>
<p>spleen over there as well</p>
<p>you know so the pancreas could be</p>
<p>digestive related but it sounds to me</p>
<p>like I would get I would check the heart</p>
<p>too because okay let&rsquo;s get rid of that</p>
<p>that angina pain and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden it comes comes back where you</p>
<p>have side effects from the medication so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that is the problem with the side</p>
<p>effects from medications is that the</p>
<p>side effects so unfortunately</p>
<p>um you want to find the root cause not</p>
<p>just treat the symptom</p>
<p>wow and here&rsquo;s Emily from Facebook what</p>
<p>do you recommend for panic attacks and</p>
<p>anxiety for some reason in my teenage</p>
<p>years I had a panic attack and I almost</p>
<p>went to the hospital I&rsquo;d rather have my</p>
<p>arm chopped off and go through that for</p>
<p>any length of time it&rsquo;s just absolutely</p>
<p>horrifying so my heart goes out to you</p>
<p>Emily and what do you think Doc and what</p>
<p>you can do uh to help that the fastest</p>
<p>way to get rid of a panic attack is to</p>
<p>slow your breathing down</p>
<p>um and breathe through your nose</p>
<p>in and out at the same rate maybe three</p>
<p>or four seconds in three or four seconds</p>
<p>out that will pull just about anyone out</p>
<p>of a panic attack breathe through the</p>
<p>nose</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna then restrict the</p>
<p>oxygen and increase the CO2 and balance</p>
<p>it out it takes CO2 to absorb the oxygen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called Uh the bore effect b-o-r-h I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s pronounced uh spelled and</p>
<p>this is why even breathing in a paper</p>
<p>bag will pull someone out of a panic</p>
<p>attack uh because you&rsquo;re increasing CO2</p>
<p>not O2 versus hyperventilation as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting too much oxygen and that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to worsen the situation</p>
<p>so um and then if you could find some B1</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another a nutritional yeast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another way to to reduce</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the tendency to get panic attacks and</p>
<p>anxiety you&rsquo;ll feel much better after</p>
<p>you do that and then you could work on</p>
<p>getting on the right diet to um</p>
<p>um you know keep your mood in check</p>
<p>all right very good well Emily earlier</p>
<p>we had uh Benji who was from Canada from</p>
<p>a nice furniture store I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>recommend he send you a nice sectional</p>
<p>couch to cheer you up Benji so if you</p>
<p>can clam on that request as well that</p>
<p>would be terrific let&rsquo;s move on</p>
<p>um see Terry you know we&rsquo;ve gotten so</p>
<p>efficient</p>
<p>um that we&rsquo;re running out of questions</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s another one Sharon from</p>
<p>Facebook I suffer from pre-sleep</p>
<p>dystonia and can&rsquo;t get into REM sleep</p>
<p>please help what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>the first question are you taking any</p>
<p>medications because so many medications</p>
<p>interfere with REM sleep</p>
<p>and so will alcohol so will wine so will</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in order to get the Sleep your</p>
<p>mitochondria the energy factories need</p>
<p>to have enough energy as well and so</p>
<p>probably the most beneficial thing you</p>
<p>could do is to start taking the B</p>
<p>complex</p>
<p>the hog B complex and maybe even a trace</p>
<p>mineral which is exactly right what I</p>
<p>recommend for for doing keto but both of</p>
<p>those um those compounds the B vitamins</p>
<p>and the electrolytes will support</p>
<p>um what&rsquo;s called the Krebs cycle in the</p>
<p>mitochondria which will then</p>
<p>um most likely help you not just with</p>
<p>your sleep</p>
<p>and the REM sleep</p>
<p>but also uh the uh the energy during the</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>however that being said if we want to</p>
<p>get real specifically a very specific</p>
<p>copper is also involved in helping</p>
<p>people to get more REM sleep and um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re deficient in Copper you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have more gray hair you can see right</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>more problems with um melanin which is a</p>
<p>skin pigment so if you have a lot of sun</p>
<p>uh you&rsquo;ll it can deplete your copper or</p>
<p>if you if you exercise intensely as an</p>
<p>athlete especially a high altitude</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be a little low in Copper which</p>
<p>can then affect the Sleep Cycle so</p>
<p>sometimes people have to just take</p>
<p>copper as a supplement for a while until</p>
<p>their sleep is better but also remember</p>
<p>that you need the balance of the other</p>
<p>trace minerals</p>
<p>and even too much zinc without copper</p>
<p>can create a copper imbalance so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you need to look up the whole picture</p>
<p>when we talk about copper but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely I mean think about even like</p>
<p>pain and inflammation what do people do</p>
<p>who are the copper bracelets they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>copper</p>
<p>lotions and and for their joints copper</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>involved in little patches around the</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>so copper is a really interesting</p>
<p>element and that can help a lot of</p>
<p>different things all right very good</p>
<p>Anna from YouTube what&rsquo;s the best way or</p>
<p>dosage of wormwood to treat parasites</p>
<p>wormy stuff or parasites that seems</p>
<p>counterintuitive before or after a meal</p>
<p>morning or night</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty harsh from the stomach so</p>
<p>you want to take it with meals okay not</p>
<p>an empty stomach and I would just take</p>
<p>whatever&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>uh the directions in the back of the</p>
<p>supplement because it comes in different</p>
<p>Doses and um whatever&rsquo;s recommended</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would recommend that you</p>
<p>do because I</p>
<p>um there is really no exact dosage</p>
<p>uh for a certain problem it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to test out</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so but take it with with meals and um</p>
<p>and also be consistent with it and take</p>
<p>it uh maybe for</p>
<p>up to a</p>
<p>four to six weeks</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but probably not continue to take it</p>
<p>after that it&rsquo;s not meant for a very</p>
<p>long-term solution it&rsquo;s a short-term</p>
<p>Quick Fix and then boom</p>
<p>um parasites are gone all right very</p>
<p>good remember audience all these great</p>
<p>things that Dr Berg is sharing with you</p>
<p>most have been</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>immortalized in video and if you want a</p>
<p>quick and easy way to get through it all</p>
<p>get his free that&rsquo;s right free app for</p>
<p>iOS or YouTube or is that OS I forget</p>
<p>but apple or um boy did I blow that uh</p>
<p>with um Android or Apple software there</p>
<p>you go got it out okay and also I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if there&rsquo;s any new developments Dr</p>
<p>Berg and the availability of products</p>
<p>internally which has from time to time</p>
<p>been difficult</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re now in the Philippines so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>um and then Steve do you have the um the</p>
<p>the answer for the last quiz questions</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that you and Terry are on it</p>
