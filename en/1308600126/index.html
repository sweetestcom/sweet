    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,</p>
<p>where I and an expert guest discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode marks the sixth and final</p>
<p>of the six episode series</p>
<p>on fitness, exercise, and performance.</p>
<p>And today&rsquo;s discussion is all about nutrition</p>
<p>and supplementation to maximize your fitness, exercise,</p>
<p>and performance goals.</p>
<p>Dr. Andy Yalpin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited to discuss today&rsquo;s topic,</p>
<p>which is nutrition and supplementation</p>
<p>for performance and recovery.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m particularly excited about this conversation</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been interested in supplementation</p>
<p>and nutrition for performance really since my teens,</p>
<p>but also because in recent years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve witnessed a massive transformation</p>
<p>in the general public in terms of their view</p>
<p>of supplementation and nutrition.</p>
<p>First of all, more people are thinking about nutrition.</p>
<p>What is good nutrition?</p>
<p>What is not?</p>
<p>A very barbed wire topic, as you know,</p>
<p>but there are some truths in there that we&rsquo;ll discuss,</p>
<p>but also supplementation.</p>
<p>Whereas 10, 15 years ago,</p>
<p>I think most people would either be really into supplements.</p>
<p>That was a small percentage of people,</p>
<p>but the majority of people were either told</p>
<p>or were thinking, oh, you know, vitamins,</p>
<p>you mostly excrete them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just expensive urine.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it seems that many people,</p>
<p>including many of my colleagues and physicians,</p>
<p>all the way down to sports performance experts,</p>
<p>are taking and making recommendations</p>
<p>about certain supplements.</p>
<p>And so the way that I like to think about supplements</p>
<p>is that they aren&rsquo;t necessarily just supplements,</p>
<p>which makes it sound like they are augmenting</p>
<p>what should already be there,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not quite getting enough of.</p>
<p>But indeed, a lot of these things we call supplements</p>
<p>are very potent compounds that can transform our ability</p>
<p>to perform in the short term, to recover from exercise,</p>
<p>and that can really shape brain chemistry,</p>
<p>hormone patterns acutely, and when taken long-term.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very excited about today&rsquo;s topic</p>
<p>and to be able to try and sort through this,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it a cloud, hopefully not a storm,</p>
<p>but this cloud of supplements that are out there.</p>
<p>Because indeed, many of them are excellent</p>
<p>and can provide us a lot.</p>
<p>Some of them are terrible,</p>
<p>and then some just don&rsquo;t do anything,</p>
<p>and therefore are terrible</p>
<p>because either they have side effects</p>
<p>or because they&rsquo;re very expensive and they don&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>And then of course, within the realm of nutrition,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an equal amount of confusion,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m talking to you,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna put clarity and structure and definition</p>
<p>on these incredibly important topics.</p>
<p>You absolutely nailed it there.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons supplements can work</p>
<p>is because you can consume nutrients</p>
<p>in extremely high concentrations,</p>
<p>such that you would not get in nature through food.</p>
<p>Having said that, you really do wanna focus</p>
<p>on the basics, sleep, nutrition, hydration,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to get into very specific detail later</p>
<p>with some of those things.</p>
<p>That said, there are plenty of situations and circumstances</p>
<p>when supplementation can do exactly what you said.</p>
<p>Also though, because you are taking them</p>
<p>in such high concentrations,</p>
<p>they can also be unproductive, they can be destructive,</p>
<p>or they can be counterproductive.</p>
<p>So in case if you&rsquo;re taking a couple of supplements</p>
<p>over here, it may actually be counteracting the benefits</p>
<p>of some of the other supplements over there.</p>
<p>So in the ideal situation,</p>
<p>we would be able to work like snipers here.</p>
<p>So we would be able to run full biological testing,</p>
<p>so extensive blood work and saliva and urine and stool,</p>
<p>and have an in-depth analysis of your gut microbiome</p>
<p>and your stress patterns and your time of day</p>
<p>and your cortisol curve, and like all the things</p>
<p>that we do in our high-performance folks.</p>
<p>With that then, we can get extremely high precision</p>
<p>supplementation, and quite honestly, our philosophy is</p>
<p>we only give individuals exactly what they need.</p>
<p>So even some of the standard generally safe</p>
<p>and effective supplements,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really necessarily use them</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s no specific need.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve talked about the consequences of this</p>
<p>with things like antioxidants,</p>
<p>but even simple stuff like stimulants</p>
<p>and other tools that are effective for recovery,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t use them unless we have a reason.</p>
<p>That said, that&rsquo;s not the reality for a lot of people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna be able to do something like that</p>
<p>without somebody who can help them in that.</p>
<p>So there are a handful of supplements</p>
<p>that I would consider to be in my 80-20 rule,</p>
<p>which is sort of like the 20% of supplements</p>
<p>that are gonna give you 80% of the benefit</p>
<p>for the lowest cost.</p>
<p>And so what I can actually do is just sort of start there,</p>
<p>even though this burns my skin and my soul a little bit,</p>
<p>I absolutely hate this.</p>
<p>I am the context guy.</p>
<p>It depends, it&rsquo;s high-precision guy, but let&rsquo;s be real.</p>
<p>There are a number of supplements that are fairly effective</p>
<p>and fairly cheap for a wide range of outcomes.</p>
<p>So this is for general public.</p>
<p>This is for people who wanna do the three buckets, right?</p>
<p>You wanna look a certain way.</p>
<p>So supplements that could enhance muscle growth</p>
<p>and fat loss, non-hormonal-based supplements, of course.</p>
<p>Supplements that can improve energy or physical performance.</p>
<p>Again, from everything from squatting more</p>
<p>to feeling better in your yoga class</p>
<p>to having more energy throughout the day</p>
<p>to our third major bucket that we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>throughout this entire series, which are longevity.</p>
<p>So we can cover those first if you&rsquo;d like to start there.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start there.</p>
<p>Oftentimes when we think of supplements,</p>
<p>we immediately jump to high sport performance type of things</p>
<p>or vigorous workouts or muscle building.</p>
<p>Though that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be the case.</p>
<p>Take for example, creatine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve spoken about this at length</p>
<p>and with Darren Kandow,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done a tremendous amount of research.</p>
<p>I was just up at his lab recently in Canada</p>
<p>and he has covered extensively.</p>
<p>In fact, I think I put up a post,</p>
<p>perhaps I could draw this up,</p>
<p>where he laid out all the myriad of benefits of creatine.</p>
<p>This is taken in the typically three to five grams</p>
<p>per day of dose of creatine monohydrate,</p>
<p>which has the most research behind it.</p>
<p>Seems to be extremely low side effects in almost anyone.</p>
<p>And the benefits include, of course,</p>
<p>things like muscle performance and strength</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>And if you go back to our discussion</p>
<p>in our episode on metabolism and endurance,</p>
<p>we talked about the phosphocreatine system.</p>
<p>So you can figure out kind of what this is going to do</p>
<p>in terms of effect.</p>
<p>That said, there&rsquo;s excellent information</p>
<p>and data coming out now on the benefits</p>
<p>of bone mineral density in creatine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of work looking at a host of cognitive factors</p>
<p>from memory, executive function,</p>
<p>to effects potentially on even things like depression,</p>
<p>mood, to Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Parkinson&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>all forms of neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious,</p>
<p>the brain loves creatine as a fuel.</p>
<p>And so not only, we sort of discussed in the episode</p>
<p>as being the fuel for skeletal muscle contraction,</p>
<p>but the brain needs to do that as well.</p>
<p>The astrocytes around the brain</p>
<p>need to be able to provide energy, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very clear that metabolism in the brain</p>
<p>is reduced with things like TBI and potentially concussions.</p>
<p>So now to be extremely clear,</p>
<p>creatine does not prevent any of those diseases.</p>
<p>It does not treat any of them and the data are mixed,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more and more are coming.</p>
<p>Some show a little bit of benefit,</p>
<p>some show maybe none,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not aware of any research in those areas</p>
<p>that show it has any downside.</p>
<p>For the most part, side effects are extremely minimal,</p>
<p>if not null, and then potentially some benefit</p>
<p>depending on the specific study.</p>
<p>So we could put up a, if you&rsquo;d like,</p>
<p>a couple of links directly to those meta-analyses</p>
<p>and folks can go through those things one by one.</p>
<p>So I only say that to, again,</p>
<p>maybe expand our understanding or thinking</p>
<p>about what these types of supplements can do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about growing muscle or high performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything to, again,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an association with recovery.</p>
<p>So creatine is fantastic for recovery from muscle,</p>
<p>for muscle damage,</p>
<p>helps and can potentially aid in fat loss</p>
<p>and a whole host of things.</p>
<p>So you can actually also even look at websites</p>
<p>like examine.com.</p>
<p>I have no affiliation with them whatsoever,</p>
<p>but if you want to just type in something</p>
<p>like creatine monohydrate,</p>
<p>you can see a whole list</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to see thousands of studies</p>
<p>of the potential benefits of creatine.</p>
<p>So that is always number one on my list.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m relieved to hear that creatine sits at the top</p>
<p>of your supplementation list,</p>
<p>because, well, first of all,</p>
<p>I started taking it when I was in college.</p>
<p>At that time, I was taking it in this kind of loading mode</p>
<p>where you take it in, you know,</p>
<p>anywhere from 15 to 25 grams per day,</p>
<p>often causing some gastric distress,</p>
<p>often combining with fruit juice</p>
<p>to try and shuttle it into the muscles.</p>
<p>And then so-called maintenance phase</p>
<p>of reducing to 10 or 15 grams per day.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I just take about five grams or so,</p>
<p>although later, I know you&rsquo;re going to tell me</p>
<p>why I should probably be taking more than five grams per day</p>
<p>given my body weight.</p>
<p>So I know we&rsquo;ll get into some of those specifics</p>
<p>a little bit later.</p>
<p>But in addition to experiencing direct effects</p>
<p>on muscle size and strength, which I did,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it contributed to my cognitive function</p>
<p>or if it does now,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s really no way to tease that out</p>
<p>with standard at-home tests, like a scale.</p>
<p>But it is very clear to me based on the literature</p>
<p>that you described and some of which we&rsquo;ve covered</p>
<p>on other episodes of the podcast</p>
<p>that the phosphocreatine system</p>
<p>is vitally important for forebrain function, right?</p>
<p>Forebrain, of course, being the portion of brain,</p>
<p>broadly speaking, the portion of brain</p>
<p>just behind your forehead</p>
<p>that is responsible for planning action,</p>
<p>setting rules and context.</p>
<p>So even as simple as if you&rsquo;re going downfield</p>
<p>in a game of soccer or basketball and you&rsquo;re on offense,</p>
<p>and then you make an attempt on goal or basket,</p>
<p>and then it switches and you go back,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re on defense.</p>
<p>Being on defense is very different than being on offense.</p>
<p>And that goal, excuse me,</p>
<p>that rule switching is a prefrontal cortical function</p>
<p>as is every context-dependent way of thinking or acting.</p>
<p>And so anything that can favor function of the forebrain</p>
<p>I think is good for humans in general.</p>
<p>It suppresses anxiety,</p>
<p>allows us to interpret what&rsquo;s going on for us.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m very relieved and gratified to hear</p>
<p>that creatine sits at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Also, as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll point out again later,</p>
<p>creatine is for the most part</p>
<p>a relatively affordable supplement for most people.</p>
<p>So here we&rsquo;re not talking about something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really esoteric or that you have to fly</p>
<p>to some remote location to get an infusion of.</p>
<p>Right, although I apologize to all you</p>
<p>because I know the price has skyrocketed recently.</p>
<p>Really? Yeah.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, well, nobody knows,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s quote unquote a supply and demand issue,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>So those prices have gone up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also, of course,</p>
<p>been shipping problems in the world and things.</p>
<p>So every time I talk about creatine right now,</p>
<p>people just flame me for like,</p>
<p>oh my God, it&rsquo;s so expensive now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I know, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>but honestly, it&rsquo;s only so expensive</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re used to being so cheap.</p>
<p>So when you counter the fact that you&rsquo;re like.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, like relative to the other stuff</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably taking,</p>
<p>relative to any other number of purchases for the,</p>
<p>it still lands very high in my ROI list,</p>
<p>my 80, 20, because of that.</p>
<p>It can be taken any time of the day.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be in magical combination.</p>
<p>You talked about co-ingesting with carbohydrates.</p>
<p>That can enhance how quickly it can get into the system.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s gonna work on the exact same mechanisms</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll probably or potentially talk about in hydration,</p>
<p>but these things are shuttled.</p>
<p>So anytime you bring in carbohydrate,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be shipped into tissue</p>
<p>as quickly as it can.</p>
<p>Creatine then goes along for the ride</p>
<p>and then it brings water for the ride.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you enhance hydration.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to have carbohydrates</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to hydrate.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just gonna take it in there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also why you get quote unquote cell swelling,</p>
<p>which is a good thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just enhancing hydration.</p>
<p>We actually use it a ton in our post weigh-in protocols.</p>
<p>So in individuals that have to cut water weight,</p>
<p>creatine is a great thing to throw back in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna help you rehydrate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why when you take 30 grams of it,</p>
<p>it can pull a bunch of fluid in the intestines</p>
<p>and there you go with your little bit of GI distress.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of fun things</p>
<p>you can talk about there.</p>
<p>I just had to flag that</p>
<p>because every time I&rsquo;ve been talking about it recently</p>
<p>and I say it&rsquo;s cheap, people are killing me for it.</p>
<p>So I apologize.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to make it any cheaper,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still fairly affordable.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say relatively inexpensive</p>
<p>compared to a lot of supplements out there.</p>
<p>And when thinking about the return on investment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite good.</p>
<p>Yeah, so like actually, sorry to cut you off,</p>
<p>but I was just also thinking,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a number of studies</p>
<p>on sleep deprivation as well with creatine that can help.</p>
<p>So obviously sleep deprivation</p>
<p>will generally reduce cognitive function</p>
<p>and creatine can ameliorate some of that drop.</p>
<p>So if you think about it in that context,</p>
<p>I had a crummy night of sleep.</p>
<p>Well, and if that enables you to perform</p>
<p>a little bit better in your job,</p>
<p>then you would make up the dollar or so,</p>
<p>whatever you paid for that day&rsquo;s supply of creatine.</p>
<p>So it is something I kind of on that note,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to work as an acute response.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;re like, I feel terrible.</p>
<p>Let me throw some creatine down the hatch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll feel better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take several weeks to have a noticeable effect.</p>
<p>It needs to be stored in tissue.</p>
<p>It needs to be built up</p>
<p>before you can actually do much of anything.</p>
<p>So it is unlike some of the other things</p>
<p>like stimulants or caffeine</p>
<p>that have an acute response right now.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re going to take it,</p>
<p>you probably need to consume it consistently.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>then really there&rsquo;s no point in doing it.</p>
<p>And the loading phase you mentioned,</p>
<p>distance we&rsquo;re here, is something you can do.</p>
<p>Again, if you need to enhance</p>
<p>the storage of it really quickly.</p>
<p>So say for example,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done this in some military cases</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like you get back to base</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve only got a week and then you got to go back out.</p>
<p>We may actually have to do a little bit</p>
<p>of a loading phase then.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s not the case,</p>
<p>the loading phase is unnecessary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really harmful other than maybe GI stress</p>
<p>and maybe waste.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re going to have three or four weeks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to reach full saturation,</p>
<p>plenty of time to be there in that,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in that three to seven grams per day range.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned</p>
<p>the slow accumulating positive effects of creatine</p>
<p>as compared to so-called acute effects.</p>
<p>Because the way that I think of health promoting</p>
<p>and performance enhancing protocols</p>
<p>like viewing morning sunlight</p>
<p>or endurance exercise for that matter,</p>
<p>or creatine or sleep for instance,</p>
<p>is that while they can have effects in the immediate term,</p>
<p>you might feel a little bit,</p>
<p>or in the case of a good night&rsquo;s sleep, a lot better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the cumulative effect</p>
<p>of raising your baseline level of functioning.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s another way to think about it</p>
<p>is these supplements or behaviors and quality nutrition</p>
<p>when done consistently over time,</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t mean 100% of the time,</p>
<p>but you know, probably 80% of the time,</p>
<p>lead to a sort of buoyancy in your system</p>
<p>that allows you to be more resilient</p>
<p>under conditions where conditions aren&rsquo;t perfect, right?</p>
<p>And if conditions are made perfect or close to perfect</p>
<p>and you already have that buoyancy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you really start to see</p>
<p>the ultra high performance effects that are so much fun,</p>
<p>but they have to be established</p>
<p>through consistent supplementation,</p>
<p>consistent nutritional intake.</p>
<p>So today I know we&rsquo;re going to distinguish between,</p>
<p>normally they&rsquo;re called chronic and acute effects,</p>
<p>but that makes it sound like chronic illness.</p>
<p>The moment people hear chronic,</p>
<p>well, they might think of other things,</p>
<p>but in the context of health,</p>
<p>they typically think of chronic illness,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not talking about that.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about is slow,</p>
<p>modulatory effects in the body.</p>
<p>A lot of things in the body take time to build up,</p>
<p>but once they&rsquo;ve built up, they clearly can benefit us.</p>
<p>And then other things, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>you know, a stimulant, for instance,</p>
<p>has a very acute effect that is going to occur with,</p>
<p>you know, peak within 30 minutes</p>
<p>and wear off within four hours or so,</p>
<p>can also have some chronic effects,</p>
<p>but typically it&rsquo;s a short-lived effect.</p>
<p>So we just want to frame up the language</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll be using,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really excited to dive into this topic,</p>
<p>and I think creatine is a beautiful example</p>
<p>of a supplement that has positive chronic,</p>
<p>mental, and physical benefits.</p>
<p>Down the road, I can come back</p>
<p>and talk a little bit more about creatine,</p>
<p>and we can cover some other information</p>
<p>regarding best practices for getting the most out of it,</p>
<p>as well as we&rsquo;ll certainly dive into</p>
<p>some of the common side effects,</p>
<p>or at least a thought of side effects.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re here, though,</p>
<p>I also could throw in a few other</p>
<p>of these high-impact, low-cost, generally safe,</p>
<p>things that are my 80-20 rule, if you will.</p>
<p>So the way I actually kind of think about it is</p>
<p>you want one from each of three categories,</p>
<p>and these categories are fuel,</p>
<p>stimulant, and fatigue blockers.</p>
<p>So creatine is actually in the fuel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a stimulant,</p>
<p>as we talked about the chronic effect there.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve already knocked that one off.</p>
<p>Another one from the fatigue blocker</p>
<p>is gonna be anything like beta-alanine</p>
<p>or sodium bicarbonate.</p>
<p>And then from the stimulant use,</p>
<p>of course, we have anything like a beetroot juice</p>
<p>to a caffeine or something of the equivalent.</p>
<p>So we can come back again</p>
<p>and talk about all those in more detail a little bit later.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is also separate from Dr. Andy Galpin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of our desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Momentus.</p>
<p>Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering</p>
<p>with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>their supplements are of extremely high quality.</p>
<p>Second of all, their supplements are generally</p>
<p>in single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to develop a supplementation protocol,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to focus mainly</p>
<p>on using single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>With single ingredient formulations,</p>
<p>you can devise the most logical and effective</p>
<p>and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally,</p>
<p>and this is, of course, important because we realize</p>
<p>that many of the Huberman Lab podcast listeners</p>
<p>reside outside the United States.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try the various supplements</p>
<p>mentioned on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>in particular supplements for hormone health,</p>
<p>for sleep optimization, for focus,</p>
<p>as well as a number of other things,</p>
<p>including exercise recovery,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Levels.</p>
<p>Levels is a program that lets you see</p>
<p>how different foods and activities affect your health</p>
<p>by giving you real-time feedback on your blood glucose</p>
<p>using a continuous glucose monitor.</p>
<p>Many people are aware that their blood sugar,</p>
<p>that is their blood glucose level,</p>
<p>is critical for everything from fat loss to muscle gain</p>
<p>to healthy cognition, and indeed,</p>
<p>aging of the brain and body.</p>
<p>Most people do not know, however,</p>
<p>how different foods and different activities,</p>
<p>including exercise or different temperature environments,</p>
<p>impact their blood glucose levels,</p>
<p>and yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive</p>
<p>to all of those things.</p>
<p>I first started using Levels about a year ago</p>
<p>as a way to understand how different foods,</p>
<p>exercise and timing of food relative to exercise</p>
<p>and quality of sleep at night</p>
<p>impact my blood glucose levels,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve learned a tremendous amount from using Levels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taught me when best to eat, what best to eat,</p>
<p>when best to exercise, how best to exercise,</p>
<p>and how to modulate my entire schedule</p>
<p>from work to exercise and even my sleep.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about Levels</p>
<p>and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s levels.link slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that contains the exact ratios</p>
<p>of the electrolytes sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>to optimize cellular functioning</p>
<p>for mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>Most people realize that hydration is key.</p>
<p>We need to ingest enough fluids</p>
<p>in order to feel our best and perform our best,</p>
<p>but what most people do not realize</p>
<p>is that the proper functioning of our cells</p>
<p>and nerve cells, neurons in particular,</p>
<p>requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>be present in the correct ratios.</p>
<p>Now, of course, people with prehypertension</p>
<p>and hypertension need to be careful</p>
<p>about their sodium intake,</p>
<p>but what a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is that if you drink caffeine,</p>
<p>if you exercise,</p>
<p>and in particular, if you&rsquo;re following a very clean diet,</p>
<p>that is not a lot of processed foods,</p>
<p>which of course is a good thing,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re not getting enough sodium,</p>
<p>potassium, and magnesium</p>
<p>to optimize mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed ratio of 1,000 milligrams,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium and no sugar.</p>

<p>To start off, I want to ask you about something</p>
<p>that as soon as I say it,</p>
<p>some people might roll their eyes or wonder,</p>
<p>why are we even talking about that now?</p>
<p>But that I have to believe is among the more fundamental,</p>
<p>if not foundational aspects of nutrition</p>
<p>and supplementation for performance,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s hydration, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think we hear hydration,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, we have to drink</p>
<p>six to eight glasses of water every day,</p>
<p>our urine should be relatively clear,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s too dark yellow,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not doing a good job of hydrating enough.</p>
<p>How much of that is true?</p>
<p>Is alkaline water worthwhile</p>
<p>for changing the alkalinity of my body?</p>
<p>I learned when I was in college and graduate school</p>
<p>that the alkalinity of the different tissues in your body</p>
<p>is very well controlled in order to keep you alive,</p>
<p>and that you don&rsquo;t want it to shift too much</p>
<p>or you can enter pretty horrible states of seizure,</p>
<p>vomiting, and even death.</p>
<p>So tell me about hydration and woven into that,</p>
<p>if you would, educate me on electrolytes and hydration,</p>
<p>because I think most often when people ingest electrolytes,</p>
<p>sure, they could be ingesting salt tablets,</p>
<p>probably getting some electrolytes,</p>
<p>by the way, electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, potassium,</p>
<p>through their food,</p>
<p>I think most people think about drinking electrolytes.</p>
<p>So water and electrolytes,</p>
<p>I think is a vitally important topic to kick this off with.</p>
<p>Sure, we can jump right into your alkaline water.</p>
<p>While there&rsquo;s perhaps much to say about this,</p>
<p>we can maybe revisit this in another seven part series</p>
<p>all on its own.</p>
<p>I would just say it this way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably a few things you should do</p>
<p>before worrying about the alkalinity of your water,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>Meaning the alkalinity of the water is sort of irrelevant?</p>
<p>Not that you won&rsquo;t go that far,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s probably,</p>
<p>remember we sort of started off talking about 80-20?</p>
<p>Well, this would be in my like 99-1,</p>
<p>in terms of like,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re really at the level of worrying about the pH</p>
<p>of your drinking fluid,</p>
<p>we have optimized so many other things</p>
<p>that then we can talk about it.</p>
<p>But until we have nailed months and years of work</p>
<p>on other things,</p>
<p>this is just not gonna make much of an impact.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Then perhaps you could tell us about</p>
<p>what volume of water we should be drinking,</p>
<p>when we should be drinking that water relative to training</p>
<p>and just generally,</p>
<p>and anything else related to water and electrolytes</p>
<p>that can improve mental performance, physical performance</p>
<p>and offset any ill effects.</p>
<p>I like the fact that you mentioned</p>
<p>physical and mental performance,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s clear in both cases.</p>
<p>We hear that we need to drink more water,</p>
<p>and I can give you some numbers and I will in a second.</p>
<p>What we also need to recognize is there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>this is hormesis.</p>
<p>We talked about hormesis a few episodes ago,</p>
<p>and this is the case, right?</p>
<p>Whether we talked about food or hydration,</p>
<p>or I think I gave you the example of cyanide,</p>
<p>naturally occurring in your food,</p>
<p>hot water is the same way.</p>
<p>So if you are under hydrated or dehydrated,</p>
<p>then there is a clear negative effect on your body.</p>
<p>And as I increase the level</p>
<p>or improve the level of hydration, things get better,</p>
<p>whether this is your physical performance</p>
<p>or whether this is mental performance.</p>
<p>In fact, we know that a body weight reduction</p>
<p>of as low as 2% via dehydration.</p>
<p>So imagine you&rsquo;re doing a bout of exercise</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sweating and you lose 2% of your body weight.</p>
<p>That alone is enough to reduce accuracy and performance.</p>
<p>So the classic study we talk about here</p>
<p>was in basketball players.</p>
<p>So shooting accuracy, so free throw shooting,</p>
<p>I think is specifically what they looked at.</p>
<p>Significant reduction in performance</p>
<p>with as little as 2% dehydration.</p>
<p>At that level, you also see a significant increase</p>
<p>in perception of difficulty of exercise.</p>
<p>And so only right at 2%.</p>
<p>And again, when I say 2%, I mean,</p>
<p>percent body weight lost, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what that means.</p>
<p>You start getting the three, four, 5% dehydration,</p>
<p>and you start having a significant reduction</p>
<p>in blood volume.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s incredibly important for endurance.</p>
<p>Your blood becomes viscous, it gets hard to pump through,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna start having all kinds of issues.</p>
<p>So being dehydrated is again,</p>
<p>not only going to reduce performance,</p>
<p>but because of the mental aspect,</p>
<p>which we just walked through,</p>
<p>and neuromuscular issue, you&rsquo;re gonna lose accuracy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna lose total endurance performance,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna lose speed and power.</p>
<p>So we have the triad there.</p>
<p>No matter what you&rsquo;re interested in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be harmed by being dehydrated.</p>
<p>That also is happening then</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re starting your program dehydrated.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re already 1% or so dehydrated,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re like a little under hydrated</p>
<p>and you lose a little bit of sweat,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already hit that 2%.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re starting to see reductions</p>
<p>in performance there.</p>
<p>The same happens on the other side of that hormetic curve.</p>
<p>So if you are optimally hydrated in some large window,</p>
<p>but you start going past that,</p>
<p>we can start running into equal problems.</p>
<p>Remember, there is a need for an optimal concentration</p>
<p>of sodium and potassium and chloride</p>
<p>between your cell, inside your cell and outside your cell.</p>
<p>These are electrolytes.</p>
<p>This is what we call osmolality and osmolarity.</p>
<p>This is really what it is.</p>
<p>Think of it like concentration and osmosis,</p>
<p>if you remember those terms.</p>
<p>So if we are trying to create a muscle contraction</p>
<p>that requires an electrical gradient,</p>
<p>and so sodium and potassium,</p>
<p>specifically in magnesium, calcium are positively charged</p>
<p>and chloride is negatively charged.</p>
<p>And we need to have a certain amount inside the cell</p>
<p>and outside the cell so that the positives</p>
<p>and the negatives are balanced appropriately</p>
<p>so that when we move one, we change the voltage</p>
<p>and we have, in the case of a muscle contraction.</p>
<p>Okay, I just skimmed through a whole lot of physiology there</p>
<p>to say, if you then go mess with fluid only,</p>
<p>and you say, if I were to give you a bolus</p>
<p>of three liters of pure water right now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to dilute your blood.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s not going to be as many chemical,</p>
<p>there won&rsquo;t be as many electrical signals in there</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve taken the same amount of sodium,</p>
<p>potassium, et cetera,</p>
<p>and put it in a larger volume of pure water.</p>
<p>So that gradient is now changed.</p>
<p>That becomes a significant problem for contraction.</p>
<p>I mean, quite literally, it can kill you.</p>
<p>This is what we call hyponatremia.</p>
<p>So natremia spelled N-A, hypo being low.</p>
<p>Hyponatremia, if you actually go to the periodic chart,</p>
<p>N-A is what we use for sodium.</p>
<p>So hyponatremia, it&rsquo;s because the word is natremia actually.</p>
<p>So what that literally means is low sodium.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t get that from sweating out all your sodium.</p>
<p>You actually get hyponatremia from drinking</p>
<p>in too much water.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that the total amount of sodium gets low,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fact that the concentration gets low</p>
<p>from excessive fluid intake.</p>
<p>So in the extremes, in fact, if you look at the literature,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see anywhere between like two to 15% of people</p>
<p>who finish endurance races are into hyponatremia.</p>
<p>And that varies wildly.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing Ironman in Kona versus like,</p>
<p>you know, the marathon in Denver in October, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be totally different</p>
<p>depending on weather conditions,</p>
<p>but these are all important.</p>
<p>So while like death happens, that is sort of extreme.</p>
<p>If you back up just a little bit,</p>
<p>you start seeing the same types of performance decrements.</p>
<p>In fact, the symptoms can be identical.</p>
<p>Brain fog, confusion, performance, irritation,</p>
<p>a GI distress, and you think, man,</p>
<p>these are symptoms of dehydration.</p>
<p>So then you drink more water</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just exacerbating the problem.</p>
<p>And I can actually give you one little example of this.</p>
<p>We had an executive, actually a female CEO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say she&rsquo;s probably was in her early forties.</p>
<p>And so she came to us and she thought, man, for sure,</p>
<p>she has some sort of gut problem going on.</p>
<p>Cause we hear a lot about kind of like gut health</p>
<p>and how it affects everything.</p>
<p>And so she&rsquo;s just like, I have brain fog</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done all these things and I got blood work done</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Like nothing&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I think I must have some sort of gut thing going on</p>
<p>or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And we just started going through her stuff</p>
<p>and she was, I think about 170 pounds, plus or minus.</p>
<p>And she was consuming like 250 to 60 ounces of water a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a ton of water.</p>
<p>And we were like, holy shit, what are you doing this for?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s just like, that&rsquo;s sort of like my thing.</p>
<p>It was, but she didn&rsquo;t realize it was more</p>
<p>of like a nervous tick than it was anything else, right?</p>
<p>She just like sip, sip, sip, sip, sip water.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, man, how often did you go pee?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, yeah, like every, you know,</p>
<p>30 minutes or something.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, fantastic sleep problems, focus.</p>
<p>And so she&rsquo;s smashing caffeine.</p>
<p>She was at like eight cups of coffee a day.</p>
<p>Which is also going to add to excretion of sodium.</p>
<p>Totally, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, okay, we don&rsquo;t really need to come in</p>
<p>and run a sleep study on you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just going to lower your water.</p>
<p>And she was like, what?</p>
<p>We dropped her down to like 180.</p>
<p>So basically an ounce per pound of body weight,</p>
<p>which is still high.</p>
<p>Cause she did train.</p>
<p>180 ounces.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>She does work out.</p>
<p>So she needed to replenish some stuff.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll cover these numbers in a second.</p>
<p>Instantaneously, I mean like two days in,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like, oh my God,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t slept six to eight hours in years.</p>
<p>And then after that, it was like,</p>
<p>basically tears coming back to us, right?</p>
<p>My focus, my brain fog is gone.</p>
<p>Cause she&rsquo;s in a very high pressure job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, everything&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>Like now she was down to three or so cups of coffee a day,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Like the whole thing, digestion improved, all of it.</p>
<p>She was sick.</p>
<p>Like her only problem after all the analyses</p>
<p>was she was just drinking way, way too much water</p>
<p>and adding more salt to her</p>
<p>would not have solved the problem.</p>
<p>Cause she would have just had simply</p>
<p>way too much fluid in her system.</p>
<p>She was having all kinds of ADH problems and aldosterone,</p>
<p>like the whole thing.</p>
<p>And then that rolls into cortisol,</p>
<p>the whole like system goes into chaos.</p>
<p>So it is important that you pay attention to hydration,</p>
<p>even though, as you sort of mentioned,</p>
<p>people tend to just kind of like roll their eyes around it.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re in the middle, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re anywhere past, not even the extreme extremes,</p>
<p>but just that first standard deviation away,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have problems.</p>
<p>And you might be thinking adrenal fatigue.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to think all these things</p>
<p>and you simply just haven&rsquo;t actually dialed in</p>
<p>your hydration.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think people sometimes roll their eyes</p>
<p>at the discussion of hydration</p>
<p>because it just doesn&rsquo;t sound very sexy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sound like a neurotransmitter or a hormone.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound like testosterone or estrogen or DHEA</p>
<p>or dopamine, but it actually is all of those things.</p>
<p>It sits at a level beneath all of those,</p>
<p>but not beneath on a hierarchy,</p>
<p>beneath in terms of a foundation.</p>
<p>Without proper electrolyte balance and hydration,</p>
<p>none of the cells of the body can function.</p>
<p>And then I think people also hear that,</p>
<p>oh, you know, we are 70% water</p>
<p>and somehow like that statistic alone</p>
<p>or that fact alone doesn&rsquo;t seem to stimulate</p>
<p>any kind of actionable takeaway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, great, you know,</p>
<p>like gravity also, you know, keeps us, you know,</p>
<p>from jumping as high as we like, you know, what do I do?</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s important that people understand</p>
<p>that every cellular process in the body</p>
<p>critically relies on having enough sodium,</p>
<p>magnesium, potassium around.</p>
<p>And the way that it&rsquo;s concentrated in fluid water</p>
<p>is really the way that you allow every cell in their body</p>
<p>to function as well as it possibly could</p>
<p>and respond to all of the sorts of kind of quote, unquote,</p>
<p>high performance tools that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;ve observed many times over</p>
<p>is that if people are ingesting too much water</p>
<p>and also drinking a lot of caffeine</p>
<p>and their electrolytes are low, they get shaky</p>
<p>and they actually can have anxiety like symptoms.</p>
<p>When people come into my lab to do studies on anxiety</p>
<p>and fear, we ask a few questions</p>
<p>and those questions include how much water</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had that day.</p>
<p>Also a sort of bizarre fact,</p>
<p>but one that I think is worth mentioning</p>
<p>is that when the bladder is full,</p>
<p>it stimulates a sort of anxiety.</p>
<p>If you ever had to urinate very badly</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in the car or you can&rsquo;t urinate</p>
<p>and then you get to the door,</p>
<p>talk about anxiety.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a direct neural pathway</p>
<p>from the bladder that registers the mechanosensors,</p>
<p>how much stretch there is on the bladder</p>
<p>that sends a signal to the brainstem alertness areas,</p>
<p>broadly speaking, locus coeruleus and others</p>
<p>that wake us up.</p>
<p>These are the, when we&rsquo;re awake, it makes us more awake</p>
<p>and when we&rsquo;re asleep, this is what wakes us up</p>
<p>to urinate in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s actually why you can use night urination</p>
<p>as a pretty good diagnostic of sleep disorders.</p>
<p>So if, because of vasopressin, right?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having sleep disorder issues</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re staying awake and vasopressin gets taken off,</p>
<p>right, and APN goes straight to the kidneys,</p>
<p>your kidneys are supposed to be dormant,</p>
<p>basically at night, you&rsquo;re not supposed to be filtering</p>
<p>a lot and producing a lot of urine at night.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s happening and say you have any number of apneas</p>
<p>kicking on or anything going on,</p>
<p>vasopressin keeps going, keeps sending a signal,</p>
<p>kidneys start filtering.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re waking up and peeing multiple times a night,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called nocturia.</p>
<p>That is a very, very good sign</p>
<p>that either one of two things happen.</p>
<p>One, you have some sort of sleep disorder</p>
<p>or two, you&rsquo;re drinking outrageous amounts of water.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s actually a bit of a backward cycle now, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re drinking way too much water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re waking up and peeing all night,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually ruining your sleep.</p>
<p>And so we have seen this a number of times</p>
<p>with our sleep company as we go in</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like, you don&rsquo;t need any of this crap.</p>
<p>You just need to be properly hydrated.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your hydration is sounding,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still waking up more than one time a night</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re still waking up to pee on average,</p>
<p>then you almost, well, I shouldn&rsquo;t say it like that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a potential that you actually have</p>
<p>some sort of a sleep disorder or sleep condition going in.</p>
<p>So the rule of thumb on that, just so we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>once or night, once a night or so of urination is fine.</p>
<p>If it is routinely or consistently more than two,</p>
<p>you need to make some adjustments, start with hydration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the simplest way, right?</p>
<p>Getting a full sleep study done, just figure out hydration.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had this happen a number of times</p>
<p>where people wanna get more health conscious</p>
<p>and they just get, they hear things like this</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, I gotta get on my water</p>
<p>and then they just start train wrecking their sleep</p>
<p>and then waking it up.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re waking up multiple times and you&rsquo;re urinating</p>
<p>and it is a large amount of urine for you and it is clear,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably not sleep apnea induced nocturia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably excessive hydration.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re waking up a bunch of times</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fairly small amounts of urine,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s probably not the fluid issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the fact that the vasopressin</p>
<p>is kicking your kidneys into gear.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not a perfect criteria,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just like a quick little tool</p>
<p>you can sort of use.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually one of the reasons</p>
<p>why we measure almost always your body weight at night,</p>
<p>as well as in the morning.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like the combat sport in the UFC fighters boxers,</p>
<p>we call that your float.</p>
<p>So how much you floated overnight.</p>
<p>I like to know that number</p>
<p>because I wanna know as well, your first morning void.</p>
<p>So when you wake up and you went to bed at 200 pounds,</p>
<p>you woke up the next morning at 195.</p>
<p>Oh, you floated five pounds.</p>
<p>Did you pee last night?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, three times.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>In another case, you woke up,</p>
<p>you went to bed at 200 pounds.</p>
<p>You wake up at 199.5.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re dehydrated</p>
<p>because you should have a certain amount of fluid</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just respiring out</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re breathing throughout your nose</p>
<p>throughout night ideally.</p>
<p>Guaranteed, you&rsquo;re gonna wake up.</p>
<p>What was your urine like?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, a little bit pretty dark.</p>
<p>Like shocker, you&rsquo;re dehydrated.</p>
<p>So you can kind of look at numbers like that.</p>
<p>A general float is something like a pound to two pounds</p>
<p>for the 170 plus pound person.</p>
<p>As you scale up, that number can go up a little bit,</p>
<p>but you can kind of use these to triage a little bit</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on with this kind of combination.</p>
<p>Everything is everything, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not just about one system.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna pay attention.</p>
<p>You can also look,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you wanna jump into it, we can,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of ways</p>
<p>I can teach you to diagnose hydration.</p>
<p>And then maybe we can start there</p>
<p>and then we can talk about hydration numbers.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;d love to talk about diagnostics</p>
<p>for hydration, over-hydration, dehydration.</p>
<p>To start off, would you be willing to give us some numbers?</p>
<p>How much water should we be drinking?</p>
<p>The classic rule here,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re making me do what I hate, right?</p>
<p>I wanna give all the caveats first,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll go straight to your number.</p>
<p>Half an ounce per pound of body weight is a rough rule.</p>
<p>So if you weigh, again, 200 pounds,</p>
<p>that would mean you drink a hundred ounces of water a day.</p>
<p>Most water bottles are like 12 to 20 ounces,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>So, you know, you end up drinking six of those or so a day,</p>
<p>kind of like plus or minus, which is not that unreasonable.</p>
<p>This does depend on a number of factors,</p>
<p>which I could go over, but that is a rough starting place.</p>
<p>The only other thing to add to that is</p>
<p>that does not account for exercise-induced water loss</p>
<p>or sauna or anything like that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s assuming just like basal daily needs.</p>
<p>If you are exercising or sweating at all for any reasons</p>
<p>or work-related, so folks that work outside</p>
<p>or in the heat or a humid environment,</p>
<p>these numbers all change and you can slide the scale up.</p>
<p>But you generally want to drink about 125%</p>
<p>of the fluids you&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>during that physical activity back.</p>
<p>And how much do you lose per hour of exercise?</p>
<p>That number ranges between one to five pounds,</p>
<p>depending on the person.</p>
<p>Nick can even be higher with some of our athletes.</p>
<p>Like I can think of a number of NFL players right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for those guys to do eight or nine pounds,</p>
<p>even not even like crazy circumstances.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s August and we&rsquo;re in Jacksonville,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not wild for us, those guys to go nine, 10 pounds.</p>
<p>What about the typical person who goes</p>
<p>to a air conditioned gym or goes out for a run on a day</p>
<p>that is somewhere between let&rsquo;s say 55 degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p>and 85 degrees Fahrenheit?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably looking at like a pound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not extremely high.</p>
<p>If you are totally soaked,</p>
<p>might be like a pound and a half to two pounds.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like come back and like your pits</p>
<p>are a little sweaty and there&rsquo;s a little bit of water</p>
<p>kind of on your neck line,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably like a more like a pound or so.</p>
<p>So in that case, you might drink back</p>
<p>a pound and a half of water.</p>
<p>Okay, so just to review these numbers</p>
<p>to make sure that I&rsquo;m on the correct page here.</p>
<p>A half an ounce of fluid per pound of body weight</p>
<p>is a sort of a foundation for hydration.</p>
<p>And then you want to replace 125%</p>
<p>of the fluid lost during exercise.</p>
<p>And exercise varies, where exercise is done varies</p>
<p>whether or not people are wearing uniforms or helmets</p>
<p>is gonna impact how much fluid they lose, et cetera.</p>
<p>In a very hot environment that the amount of fluid lost</p>
<p>can be anywhere from one to five,</p>
<p>maybe even 10 pounds per hour of hard exertion.</p>
<p>For most exercise done in conditions</p>
<p>of 55 degrees Fahrenheit to 75, excuse me,</p>
<p>85 degrees Fahrenheit done with some degree of effort,</p>
<p>one might lose a pound or two pounds of water.</p>
<p>Super easy way to find out.</p>
<p>All you have to do is weigh yourself naked,</p>
<p>go do your workout, come back in, dry off,</p>
<p>weigh yourself naked.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll tell you exactly what you lost.</p>
<p>So if you went in, you were 160 pounds,</p>
<p>you come back out, you weight, you&rsquo;re 158,</p>
<p>you lost two pounds, drink back two and a half pounds</p>
<p>of water, you&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>So that is, honestly, it&rsquo;s like fairly gold standard</p>
<p>for identifying, you can actually buy</p>
<p>a whole bunch of technology for this</p>
<p>and they are using the exact same equation,</p>
<p>which is your body weight when you were there.</p>
<p>Now, if you do that though, you do need to account</p>
<p>for any fluid you drank during the workout</p>
<p>because that then offsets it.</p>
<p>Simple, but I think important question.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a half an ounce of fluid</p>
<p>per pound of body weight.</p>
<p>Does that include things like coffee, tea, soda,</p>
<p>pre-workout drinks, mid-workout drinks,</p>
<p>mate, matcha, whatever the, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a yerba mate, there are a million things out there,</p>
<p>or just water?</p>
<p>Any fluid for the most part is gonna count.</p>
<p>And is it true that fluids that contain caffeine</p>
<p>generally cause us to secrete sodium?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so do you recommend including electrolyte powder</p>
<p>or a small pinch of sodium or any number</p>
<p>of other supplement type electrolytes</p>
<p>that can replace that sodium, magnesium and potassium?</p>
<p>A couple of things we have to pay attention to</p>
<p>to accurately answer that question.</p>
<p>What you also sort of asked about,</p>
<p>you may have not even realized,</p>
<p>is does caffeine actually enhance dehydration?</p>
<p>Which is not really what you asked,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably a lot of people thought that as well.</p>
<p>So caffeine can, but coffee doesn&rsquo;t necessarily do that</p>
<p>because remember, you&rsquo;re co-ingesting that with fluid.</p>
<p>And so we used to say that all the time,</p>
<p>coffee dehydrates you.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, it might make your urine yellow.</p>
<p>It certainly gives off an odor in your urine.</p>
<p>But in general, coffee will not do that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re ingesting.</p>
<p>If you were to now be taking caffeine pills alone,</p>
<p>now there is a bit of a diuretic effect there.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re gonna urinate.</p>
<p>How much?</p>
<p>Maybe not enough for you to be really concerned with,</p>
<p>especially when you balance that</p>
<p>against the ergogenic effects and benefits of caffeine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something we are concerned about.</p>
<p>Second part of your question,</p>
<p>do you need to then offset the loss of sodium?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not super concerned about the amount</p>
<p>of sodium lost to caffeine.</p>
<p>I am more concerned about simply the amount</p>
<p>of sodium being correct</p>
<p>because of the bigger circumstances,</p>
<p>like how much is actually in your system</p>
<p>and how much you lost in the training session.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the caffeine that I care about that much</p>
<p>relative to, if you lost three grams of sodium</p>
<p>because of the training</p>
<p>and you added another few milligrams</p>
<p>because of the caffeine, I don&rsquo;t really care or didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you brought up the difference</p>
<p>between a substance like caffeine</p>
<p>and the vehicle it&rsquo;s contained in, like coffee.</p>
<p>This is all really important.</p>
<p>And it also raises a question about individual differences</p>
<p>in sweating ability.</p>
<p>And I call it sweating ability</p>
<p>because I have a good friend I&rsquo;ve known for ages really,</p>
<p>actually work with him in my laboratory as well.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s one of these people</p>
<p>that the moment he starts any physical activity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a flood warning, right?</p>
<p>He just soaks through clothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the sweating adaptation</p>
<p>is exceedingly robust in him, other people less so.</p>
<p>So is it true that sweating and our ability to dump heat</p>
<p>through it by loss of water is something</p>
<p>that we tend to vary on</p>
<p>and that also that we can build up that capacity?</p>
<p>I know a number of people are probably thinking,</p>
<p>ew, gross, why would I want to sweat more?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s actually a huge advantage</p>
<p>to be able to dump body heat during exertion</p>
<p>because body heat in some ways sets the cap for performance.</p>
<p>Many, many ways.</p>
<p>Including mental performance.</p>
<p>Our ability to stay alert often is enhanced by being cold.</p>
<p>And of course we all want to warm up properly.</p>
<p>But in terms of loss of fluid through sweating,</p>
<p>is there a way to easily bin ourselves</p>
<p>into kind of a low sweater, medium sweater, heavy sweater?</p>
<p>That sounds like an article of clothing.</p>
<p>But in any case, you know what I&rsquo;m, you know.</p>
<p>Man, another, a lot to say here.</p>
<p>Wish we had a whole series on this.</p>
<p>Listen, if we have to go 17 hours, we can do it.</p>
<p>Just everybody hydrate well.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve shown the listeners that is a real threat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very real threat.</p>
<p>Podcasting to failure.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do every set in the gym to failure,</p>
<p>but here we are attempting to podcast failure.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, what is the role of sweating ability?</p>
<p>And is this something that any of us should care about</p>
<p>or train for or pay attention to?</p>
<p>Or is this just kind of getting into the arcane?</p>
<p>Number one, you can train your ability to sweat.</p>
<p>This is important for heat acclimation.</p>
<p>And why that matters, when you sweat,</p>
<p>that actually is not what regulates your temperature.</p>
<p>What you want to have happen is the fluid to hit your skin</p>
<p>and that to be evaporated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the actual mechanism.</p>
<p>In fact, if you stop sweating,</p>
<p>you can guarantee within a short amount of time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be done moving.</p>
<p>Oh, very interesting.</p>
<p>I hope people heard that</p>
<p>and really are highlighting that in their mind,</p>
<p>that sweating is a process of bringing fluid</p>
<p>from your body onto the surface of your skin.</p>
<p>And then the heat dumping aspect of sweating</p>
<p>is the evaporation of that off your body,</p>
<p>which brings to mind all sorts of ideas</p>
<p>about how to dress during exercise, et cetera.</p>
<p>But what you said is that if you are not sweating enough,</p>
<p>you are limiting your output capacity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about having enough fluid to sweat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about being able to sweat</p>
<p>and being dressed appropriately to allow that sweat</p>
<p>to evaporate off your body.</p>
<p>Yep, and heat acclimation training</p>
<p>is as simple as it sounds.</p>
<p>So just practice it more.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going into a process</p>
<p>where you either need to be in a hot environment</p>
<p>or you need to improve your sweat rate,</p>
<p>you just need to practice sweating</p>
<p>and your body will get better at that.</p>
<p>Practice a sauna, practice a jacuzzi,</p>
<p>just get in those things</p>
<p>and you will improve your ability to do that.</p>
<p>Now, there is a huge genetic component.</p>
<p>I have one individual, actually,</p>
<p>a UFC fighter I&rsquo;ve been working with,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mind mentioning his name.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll give me full permission, Scott Holtzman.</p>
<p>Many, many years, he&rsquo;s actually fighting right now.</p>
<p>Actually, today he&rsquo;ll be going.</p>
<p>He is like you described,</p>
<p>like buckets and buckets and buckets of fluids</p>
<p>come off this guy when he&rsquo;s tying his shoes.</p>
<p>Like he just goes, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve improved that, he actually sweat too much.</p>
<p>We worked on that a lot early in his career</p>
<p>and we got some improvements down</p>
<p>to get him to hold on to fluids better.</p>
<p>That being said, I&rsquo;ve worked with other individuals</p>
<p>in his weight category and it&rsquo;s the opposite, right?</p>
<p>So we can have them literally do</p>
<p>the exact same training session together</p>
<p>and Scott will dump six pounds</p>
<p>and other folks at his size will dump two, two and a half.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a genetic component that is just there</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it there.</p>
<p>So can you identify if you are a heavy salt sweater or not?</p>
<p>Well, you have a whole bunch of routes for this.</p>
<p>Number one is you can use the old free,</p>
<p>cost free test of just looking at your clothing</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re seeing that white residue all over it,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ve all have the friend</p>
<p>who probably wears that same baseball hat</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve had for eight years.</p>
<p>If it is covered in the white junk all over the place,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a sign of a higher salt sweater.</p>
<p>If the opposite happens</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like you can pull their clothing back</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just nothing there,</p>
<p>there may be a little bit of a lower salt sweater.</p>
<p>You can also use any number of hydration tests.</p>
<p>I know that there is some coming out in the market</p>
<p>very, very soon that can give you theoretically real time</p>
<p>measurements just like a CGM would be,</p>
<p>although I haven&rsquo;t seen any data on if those are accurate</p>
<p>or not and I haven&rsquo;t used one yet,</p>
<p>but there are a number that are all super cheap,</p>
<p>10, 15, 20 bucks all the way up to a couple of hundred</p>
<p>dollars where you can buy these patches,</p>
<p>put them on you and get a reasonably close estimate.</p>
<p>And again, if those things are five or 10 or 20% off,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, we have to see independent data</p>
<p>come out first, but even if they are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not worried about the specific milligrams, right?</p>
<p>Whether you sweat out, you know,</p>
<p>1250 milligrams at a workout or if it&rsquo;s 1340,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to look for big, big numbers, right?</p>
<p>Are you losing 500 milligrams using three and a half grams</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re at?</p>
<p>So those things will get you in a ballpark</p>
<p>to do exactly what you just said.</p>
<p>Am I high, medium or low?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of them that I&rsquo;ve used in the past.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another way to go about it.</p>
<p>Then what you want to do is probably match</p>
<p>your electrolyte intake to something close</p>
<p>to what you sweat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ideal scenario.</p>
<p>You can get a lot of information about hydration from blood.</p>
<p>You can look at like acute markers of dehydration,</p>
<p>like hemoglobin, hematocrit.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like, if your hemoglobin is like 15 plus,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this in a few episodes before,</p>
<p>but I see that and I&rsquo;m like, man, that dude&rsquo;s super fit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a 15 for hemoglobin would be pretty high,</p>
<p>14 or so would be pretty good for a female.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also the exact same thing</p>
<p>as the sign of acute dehydration.</p>
<p>So hematocrit, same thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re north of 50%, you&rsquo;re probably dehydrated.</p>
<p>So you can get a lot.</p>
<p>There are also though a lot of biomarkers</p>
<p>that can tell you more about chronic dehydration.</p>
<p>So you can run through those things as well.</p>
<p>So a good blood chemistry test can tell you a lot</p>
<p>and you can actually get some insights</p>
<p>of your sodium and potassium.</p>
<p>Albumin is another fantastic way to measure longer term</p>
<p>hydration status.</p>
<p>Now one of these amazing globulins</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve sort of talked a lot about.</p>
<p>So you can do all those things.</p>
<p>You can also simply measure the body weight pre and post</p>
<p>and use a sweat patch or not</p>
<p>and use the freer version of your clothing test</p>
<p>and get a rough idea of where you&rsquo;re getting it from.</p>
<p>So those are good places to start.</p>
<p>I wanna go back though and make sure I wasn&rsquo;t over</p>
<p>terrifying the audience too much on a silver piece.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re performing a type of training or exercise</p>
<p>or sport in which you&rsquo;re not losing more than 2%</p>
<p>of your body weight,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to be overly concerned</p>
<p>about hydrating in the sport.</p>
<p>And so we can actually get into some equations</p>
<p>for how much water to drink during training right now.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re, again, losing less than that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not critical.</p>
<p>You can have some fluids if it makes you feel better,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not gonna be experiencing tremendous amounts</p>
<p>of performance decrements.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, again, out playing a baseball game</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s 50 degrees out, you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>You can drink some water,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not gonna be compromising performance</p>
<p>or recovery.</p>
<p>So we can actually then, if you&rsquo;d like,</p>
<p>I can go through the three-step system</p>
<p>for optimizing hydration, but those are,</p>
<p>I wanna make sure I planted that flag</p>
<p>so people aren&rsquo;t just terrified</p>
<p>that they gotta be guzzling down water</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re going to their physical therapist</p>
<p>for some stretching.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably not super important.</p>

<p>I would love for you to tell us</p>
<p>what I refer to as the Galpin equation.</p>
<p>Understanding, of course, that you did not name it</p>
<p>the Galpin equation.</p>
<p>Listen, folks, scientists can have things named after them,</p>
<p>but in general, it&rsquo;s not reflective of healthy psychology</p>
<p>if they name things after themselves.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Sometimes, yes, neuroanatomists used to do that,</p>
<p>but in any case, Dr. Andy Galpin</p>
<p>did not name the Galpin equation after himself.</p>
<p>I named it after him, and the Galpin equation</p>
<p>for how much fluid to ingest during exercise is?</p>
<p>You want to take your body weight in pounds</p>
<p>and divide that by 30,</p>
<p>and you want to consume that number,</p>
<p>which would be in ounces, about every 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>So in the example of you being 200 pounds,</p>
<p>you would take 200 divided by 30,</p>
<p>which is, let&rsquo;s just call that number seven to be close,</p>
<p>which means you would consume about seven ounces of water</p>
<p>every 15 or 20 minutes or so.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now, as a little bit of a point,</p>
<p>while I also did not name it, I also didn&rsquo;t do the research.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to point out that other scientists</p>
<p>figured these things out.</p>
<p>I just read their papers and made that derivation</p>
<p>of their equation to make it a little bit easier</p>
<p>for us folks who do not work on the metric system.</p>
<p>Okay, a couple of things.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m not 200 pounds,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t matter how much I weigh</p>
<p>because the point is that the listener-</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Should take their body weight in pounds divided by 30</p>
<p>and ingest that number of ounces in fluid every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And then for those out there outside the US</p>
<p>that are accustomed to thinking in milliliters</p>
<p>and liters, not ounces, and kilograms, not pounds,</p>
<p>what is the Galpin equation in the metric system?</p>
<p>This would be two milliliters per kilogram,</p>
<p>which again, if you were, let&rsquo;s say 200 pounds,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be something roughly like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll call it 90 kilos.</p>
<p>And so if you did two milliliters per kilo,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be something like 180 milliliters of fluid,</p>
<p>again, every 15 or 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Great, and how should people ingest that fluid?</p>
<p>And of course, I would imagine it&rsquo;s through their mouth,</p>
<p>I would hope.</p>
<p>I hope.</p>
<p>There are other orifices that it might suffice,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s not go there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re drinking that water consistently,</p>
<p>or is it every 15 minutes they slug it back?</p>
<p>Does it matter?</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, that&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>Handful of things.</p>
<p>In general, when you talk hydration,</p>
<p>the slower and steady, you can go the better.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason this two milliliters per kilogram</p>
<p>number came out is because a number of trials were run</p>
<p>where they looked at that every 15 minutes,</p>
<p>just one bolus of it, in different variations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty clear that the slower pace</p>
<p>one could do it, the better.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re doing it every 10 minutes</p>
<p>or 15 or 20 minutes, the reason we actually give that gap</p>
<p>is because you have to be also offset</p>
<p>a little bit of GI distress.</p>
<p>In fact, like kind of the four golden rules of recovery,</p>
<p>if you will, we use sort of three R&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You need to rebuild, rehydrate, and replenish.</p>
<p>What that really means is you need to have</p>
<p>a continuous glucose stream,</p>
<p>you need to have a continuous amino acid stream,</p>
<p>you need to hydrate, and you need to do all one,</p>
<p>two, and three without disturbing your gut too much.</p>
<p>And so in this particular case,</p>
<p>it was sort of found that we can hit that level in general</p>
<p>and be just fine for most people.</p>
<p>So, I mean, a little bit of context,</p>
<p>the example we gave there, in both cases,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something like six to seven ounces</p>
<p>for 15 or 20 minutes.</p>
<p>If you think about that, there&rsquo;s 16 ounces in a pound.</p>
<p>And most water bottles, like if you go buy a water bottle</p>
<p>at a store here, they generally come</p>
<p>in like 16 ounce bottles-ish.</p>
<p>So six or seven ounces is really like a third</p>
<p>of a water bottle, maybe, every 15 or 20 or so minutes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not some egregious amount of water</p>
<p>that you have to slam down.</p>
<p>Now, that is influenced heavily</p>
<p>by how hydrated you started the session with,</p>
<p>so how hydrated you came in.</p>
<p>External factors like heat, humidity,</p>
<p>temperature, things like that.</p>
<p>But that gives you a rough idea that, again,</p>
<p>and these are numbers that you would need to consume</p>
<p>to optimize performance.</p>
<p>At the end of that, then is when you would look</p>
<p>to see how much I lost, like we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>and then add back that 125%,</p>
<p>taking into account how much fluid you ingested.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re 200 pounds and you drank a total of,</p>
<p>say, a pound of water during the training,</p>
<p>and you started off at 200 and you finished at 198,</p>
<p>you actually lost three pounds, not two pounds,</p>
<p>because you lost three, you drank one during it,</p>
<p>so your final net number is two.</p>
<p>So now you really need to drink back 125%</p>
<p>of that remaining two pounds,</p>
<p>two and a half pounds, something like that.</p>
<p>These numbers, especially that 125,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just rough guidelines.</p>
<p>Some actually papers suggest it&rsquo;s all the way up to 150%.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just like an idea.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t measure out whether you need 5.5 ounces</p>
<p>or 6.2 ounces.</p>
<p>It just sort of gives you an idea of where to start.</p>
<p>All right, a few sips every 15 or 20 minutes</p>
<p>is close enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually started using the Galpin equation</p>
<p>to determine how much fluid I need for mental work.</p>
<p>Given the now robust data that are out there</p>
<p>on the relationship between hydration and mental work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been very effective for me.</p>
<p>And again, there are peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that support the idea that hydration is important</p>
<p>for proper mental clarity and energy and focus,</p>
<p>and that even being slightly dehydrated can disrupt that.</p>
<p>But if one is drinking so much water</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re frequently going to the restroom</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t comfortably focus on the work they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also an issue.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very helpful.</p>
<p>What are the three most critical features of hydration?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d like to move on to some of the more particulars</p>
<p>about supplementation and nutrition.</p>
<p>Three parts, start hydrated,</p>
<p>maintain hydration throughout.</p>
<p>Part three is hydrate post to fix it.</p>
<p>We gave you the half ounce per pound of body weight equation.</p>
<p>So you start the training hydrated.</p>
<p>We gave you the two milliliters per kilogram</p>
<p>slash body weight divided by 30 to stay hydrated.</p>
<p>Then we gave you the 125%.</p>
<p>But I can actually just give you sort of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving you another list here, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>but it is my five-step cheater guide</p>
<p>for optimizing hydration for performance.</p>
<p>Sorry, step number one,</p>
<p>drink a lot of water first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>This gets everything kickstarted, gets you going.</p>
<p>It also saves you from having to drink</p>
<p>a bunch of water at night,</p>
<p>which is then going to compromise your sleep.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a lot?</p>
<p>Depending on how big you are,</p>
<p>the general thing I&rsquo;ll tell people is,</p>
<p>like one of the very first things you should do</p>
<p>throughout your day, you wake up, go to the bathroom,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re consuming your sunlight, consume water.</p>
<p>This is maybe chugging a full glass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s honestly what I do, it&rsquo;s not the best route,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just get that going.</p>
<p>So 16 ounces.</p>
<p>16 ounces or so is great, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re larger, I&rsquo;m 165 to 70 pounds,</p>
<p>depending on what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>maybe a little higher sometimes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re 225 pounds, maybe that number is 30 ounces.</p>
<p>So you just sort of scale up and down.</p>
<p>And the only reason I say a lot</p>
<p>is it just depends on what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I also should clarify,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really literally mean chug.</p>
<p>Just like sips, because the faster you drink water,</p>
<p>the faster it&rsquo;s going to expand blood volume.</p>
<p>The faster it extends blood volume,</p>
<p>the faster you get rid of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people know that.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe this is clarifying.</p>
<p>This is also, we sort of talked about earlier,</p>
<p>if you drink too much water, you&rsquo;ll dilute the system.</p>
<p>Well, if you have a diluted system,</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s first reaction is to rid of water,</p>
<p>to bring total blood volume down, right?</p>
<p>Remember, if you were to go to a doctor</p>
<p>and they looked at your total blood volume,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, man, you&rsquo;re five and a half liters.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be like, holy crap,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be put on a diuretic</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to have a heart attack</p>
<p>and have blood pressure.</p>
<p>I wonder if people are drinking a 16 ounce glass of water</p>
<p>or other fluid all at once before going to sleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re waking up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Given what you just said,</p>
<p>probably a better protocol would be</p>
<p>to sip on a glass of water in the final hour,</p>
<p>two hours before sleep.</p>
<p>Generally, the number we say is three hours.</p>
<p>In the three hours preceding sleep,</p>
<p>you want to basically limit fluid intake to sipping</p>
<p>as needed.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m going to start that tonight</p>
<p>because I wake up generally once per night</p>
<p>to use the bathroom.</p>
<p>And I do drink some fluids before I go to sleep,</p>
<p>mostly because I&rsquo;m pretty thirsty at that time.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to start sipping that water</p>
<p>in the three hours heading into sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can actually pay attention to is,</p>
<p>to go back, this is actually, I love doing this stuff.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re waking up at night</p>
<p>and you have a very dry mouth.</p>
<p>Not for me.</p>
<p>All right, because it can be one of two things.</p>
<p>You might actually be dehydrated.</p>
<p>And so then what the mistake people make is like,</p>
<p>man, my mouth is so dry.</p>
<p>I keep getting up to drink water at night.</p>
<p>That makes you then pee too much.</p>
<p>What that also indicates is probably your mouth breathing.</p>
<p>So a lot of ways to fix people waking up</p>
<p>and urinating too much at night is to tape your mouth</p>
<p>and or use a dilator over your nose.</p>
<p>And then what happens is you don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>like you have a dry mouth.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t get up to consume any extra water</p>
<p>throughout the night.</p>
<p>So that actually reduces your fluid intake.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have the problem of actually now having</p>
<p>too much fluid to do it.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s another reasons why mouth taping</p>
<p>can really, really help.</p>
<p>If you are having those issues and or snoring,</p>
<p>those are not benign.</p>
<p>You really should get some work on those.</p>
<p>Something, you&rsquo;re not sleeping very well</p>
<p>is the way I&rsquo;ll say it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean something life-threatening,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a good thing.</p>
<p>So you got to run kind of your triaging things</p>
<p>back and forth.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m waking up to pee a lot,</p>
<p>but my mouth isn&rsquo;t thirsty.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Then you may actually have just a water consumption issue.</p>
<p>If it is, my mouth is dry, but I&rsquo;m actually waking up</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m having these large urinations,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not actually dehydrated.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just breathing through your mouth.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re waking up and your mouth is dry</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not a lot of pee there,</p>
<p>then you actually might actually legitimately</p>
<p>be under hydrated.</p>
<p>So a little bit of a game you can play there.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s super informative.</p>
<p>I think that the point alone that gulping a bunch of water</p>
<p>all at once is going to cause you to need to excrete</p>
<p>that water soon after is a really important point.</p>
<p>Also for people that are going to, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>give a talk or you don&rsquo;t want to have to get up</p>
<p>to use the restroom.</p>
<p>You have to sit through a long meeting.</p>
<p>Clearly I&rsquo;m violating all these rules up until right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, you know, not,</p>
<p>I sort of follow the seagull approach to consuming fluids,</p>
<p>just gulp, gulp in enormous volumes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start sipping fluids instead.</p>
<p>What are some of the other rules of hydration?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to wake up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start your day and start hydrated.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re consuming a larger percentage of your water</p>
<p>earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Then you get all the performance enhancing effects of water</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it compromising your sleep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s step number one.</p>
<p>Also, now you&rsquo;re going to start your session</p>
<p>closer to hydration.</p>
<p>All right, great.</p>
<p>Number two, eat mostly real whole foods.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>What you may or not have thought about</p>
<p>is a huge determinant of your hydration status</p>
<p>is your food choices.</p>
<p>If you look at different foods, for example, most fruit,</p>
<p>watermelon.</p>
<p>Watermelon is like 95 plus percent water.</p>
<p>Fantastic source.</p>
<p>Also, by the way, since we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>it is not extremely high in carbohydrate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not extremely high in sugar.</p>
<p>It is by percentage,</p>
<p>but since it is almost exclusively water you&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>it is not something that is extremely dangerous</p>
<p>in terms of sugar.</p>
<p>I, there alone, probably of all the things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about in the six episodes,</p>
<p>that comment right there will probably</p>
<p>blow the internet to pieces</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll probably get hate mail for life for it, but.</p>
<p>From people throwing watermelons, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think the point</p>
<p>is that sugar is necessarily bad.</p>
<p>I think the point is that for most people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ingesting too much sugar.</p>
<p>Most people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>oftentimes the people who are justifying</p>
<p>the ingestion of sugar are exactly the kind of people</p>
<p>that should not ingest so much sugar.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a little bit of a user bias there.</p>
<p>The point here is if you&rsquo;re eating whole real food,</p>
<p>this is like, now we&rsquo;re kind of splitting hairs</p>
<p>about this thing, so.</p>
<p>So morning hydration, consumed food.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, important point here.</p>
<p>If you compare it to other foods,</p>
<p>like actually meat is a very high percentage of fluid.</p>
<p>Depending on how well or long you&rsquo;ve cooked it,</p>
<p>you will reduce it.</p>
<p>Remember you said earlier, we&rsquo;re 70% water, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re eating meat,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting actually a big chunk of water.</p>
<p>As you cook it, of course you lose some of that.</p>
<p>But meat can be like,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a hydrating food item,</p>
<p>but it is not as low as something like a biscuit,</p>
<p>which can be actually like 10% water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s like dry and dense,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s bad for you, but there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re eating highly processed foods,</p>
<p>almost by association,</p>
<p>that means they&rsquo;ve been dehydrated or partially, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just getting less total fluid intake.</p>
<p>In addition, they have also been highly salted in general.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re in this position where we&rsquo;re under hydrated</p>
<p>and highly salted, bad spot.</p>
<p>If you now switch over to mostly,</p>
<p>again, just mostly whole real food-ish,</p>
<p>whatever that means to you,</p>
<p>then your hydration is going to skyrocket.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have a lot.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re eating a ton of food.</p>
<p>In fact, it should be a large percentage</p>
<p>of the fluid intake you have actually</p>
<p>should be coming from your food.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t have to be smashing water bottles</p>
<p>after water bottle all day.</p>
<p>In that case though, you do need to add salt back.</p>
<p>So we do see this a lot</p>
<p>with people who try to make a transition</p>
<p>for maybe a suboptimal nutritional lifestyle.</p>
<p>And they give up a little bit of the processed food</p>
<p>and they come over and they start having problems</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not actually consuming enough salt.</p>
<p>So add that back.</p>
<p>Easy way to do that.</p>
<p>You can use electrolytes</p>
<p>and we could talk about those numbers if you want.</p>
<p>If you just salt your food that you&rsquo;re making to taste,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to get most people in a pretty good spot.</p>
<p>So start hydrated, consume hydrating foods.</p>
<p>Step number two.</p>
<p>Step number three, you want to pre-hydrate.</p>
<p>If you know you&rsquo;re going to do a workout session</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be hot and long or one of those things,</p>
<p>you want to look for that half a pound</p>
<p>per body weight of ounces.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the number we&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>to start our hydration session.</p>
<p>We do that, we&rsquo;re pretty much taken care of.</p>
<p>And then, like I said, adjust depending on lifestyle,</p>
<p>humidity, and other factors like that.</p>
<p>You can use what is called the what system, WUT.</p>
<p>I think Bob Kenefick has done a ton of research in this area.</p>
<p>If you want to read more, look up his research.</p>
<p>It is simply weight, urine, and thirst.</p>
<p>So in other words, check your body weight,</p>
<p>look at your urine color, and gauge your thirst.</p>
<p>And actually, you can use those three things,</p>
<p>and those can significantly predict</p>
<p>actual hydration status, independent of actually</p>
<p>measuring osmolality or anything like that.</p>
<p>So those three metrics alone are a pretty good indicator</p>
<p>of where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to have that normal amount of water,</p>
<p>plus or minus.</p>
<p>If you miss that number for whatever reason,</p>
<p>you get distracted, the number we typically tell people</p>
<p>is something like 400 to 500 milliliters of water</p>
<p>in the hour preceding the training.</p>
<p>All right, so that&rsquo;s like 13 to 20 ounces.</p>
<p>So you know you&rsquo;re going to go work out at three o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s two o&rsquo;clock, and you realize,</p>
<p>oh man, I have not drank much water today.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to go smash tons and tons and tons,</p>
<p>just look for something like that,</p>
<p>call it a bottle of water, if you will.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not enough, if you&rsquo;re in a really tough spot,</p>
<p>you can do more like five to eight ounces,</p>
<p>15 or 20 minutes before exercise.</p>
<p>You want to be really careful about drinking</p>
<p>a whole bunch of water in the seconds before exercise,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just going to feel a whole bunch of water</p>
<p>bouncing up and down in your stomach and nobody likes that.</p>
<p>So one to 300 milliliters, 15 or so 20 minutes before.</p>
<p>That assumes you&rsquo;re in this 185 pound range-ish.</p>
<p>Again, if you&rsquo;re talking people of much larger size,</p>
<p>you may need to increase those values accordingly.</p>
<p>If you do all that, then you use the Galpin equation</p>
<p>for your intra-workout hydration,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a pretty good spot.</p>
<p>What you want to consume in that is what I call sweat.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is you don&rsquo;t actually want to</p>
<p>necessarily consume water only during a workout.</p>
<p>You want to consume something that is iso-osmotic</p>
<p>to your blood.</p>
<p>So something that is the same concentration</p>
<p>that you lost in your sweat.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve done a sweat test,</p>
<p>you would then drink a fluid</p>
<p>that is of the same osmolality.</p>
<p>The short version of that,</p>
<p>something in the neighborhood of 200 to 400 milligrams</p>
<p>of sodium.</p>
<p>Most electrolytes products are going to be</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>Now I know Element is a thousand milligrams</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a lot higher,</p>
<p>but most products now that you&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>are 250 to 400 milligrams.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re typically in the like two to maybe up to</p>
<p>three to one sodium to potassium range, right?</p>
<p>Coconut water is actually cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like basically the opposite.</p>
<p>Like a cup of coconut water,</p>
<p>I think has something like 200 milligrams of sodium,</p>
<p>but like 600 milligrams of potassium.</p>
<p>So like total spoiler alert,</p>
<p>but when we use coconut water,</p>
<p>a lot of hydration just add a little pinch of salt</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;ll bring the sodium way back up.</p>
<p>Yeah. One note about sodium.</p>
<p>Obviously people who have prehypertension or hypertension</p>
<p>want to be careful with their sodium intake.</p>
<p>Anytime I&rsquo;ve suggested that people might consider</p>
<p>ingesting more sodium, you know, it&rsquo;s sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like putting a target on your,</p>
<p>on your back and yet the data are pretty good</p>
<p>showing that if people are not getting enough sodium,</p>
<p>their mental clarity, their focus, their mental stamina,</p>
<p>their physical stamina really suffers.</p>
<p>And then people argue,</p>
<p>well, most of us are getting too much salt.</p>
<p>That often is true for people that are eating</p>
<p>a lot of processed foods.</p>
<p>And not training.</p>
<p>And not training.</p>
<p>But for many people who are already sort of health conscious</p>
<p>who are training, they&rsquo;re largely consuming</p>
<p>or I should say they&rsquo;re consuming largely non-processed</p>
<p>or minimally processed foods.</p>
<p>And especially for folks who are not ingesting</p>
<p>many carbohydrates and are consuming caffeine.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that carbohydrates hold water</p>
<p>and that makes it sound bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily that, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get subcutaneous swelling of your body.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s recovering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bringing water into your system and it holds water.</p>
<p>So when you drop carbohydrates, starches in particular,</p>
<p>you urinate a lot more.</p>
<p>And when you drink caffeine, you also urinate a lot more</p>
<p>as you pointed out earlier.</p>
<p>So you start combining a few things</p>
<p>like slightly lower carbohydrate or low carbohydrate,</p>
<p>eating really quote unquote clean.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not getting a lot of salt in your food</p>
<p>and drinking caffeine and then exercising.</p>
<p>And then pretty soon those numbers that come along</p>
<p>with a gram of sodium in your electrolyte drink</p>
<p>are not all that outrageous.</p>
<p>And what you find is people feel much, much better</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re getting enough sodium.</p>
<p>And of course I should say that there&rsquo;s no reason</p>
<p>why someone has to ingest a supplement like Element</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other ways</p>
<p>to bring sodium into your system.</p>
<p>You can use a pinch of pink salt or Himalayan salt</p>
<p>or sea salt or even just table salt in water</p>
<p>or just making sure that you&rsquo;re salting your food enough.</p>
<p>And I think that there too, salt appetite</p>
<p>and salt taste is a pretty good guide.</p>
<p>If you taste something and it tastes really salty to you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an indication that either it&rsquo;s really salty</p>
<p>or your salt stores are kind of tapped off, you&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re craving salt and you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>gosh, I really want to put salt on this already salty thing,</p>
<p>not necessarily, but oftentimes that means</p>
<p>that you are salt deficient.</p>
<p>So salt appetite is a pretty hardwired set</p>
<p>of neural circuits and hormones.</p>
<p>And I think we would all be wise to learn to tap</p>
<p>into our kind of intuition about salt intake,</p>
<p>but of course also to measure your blood pressure, et cetera.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>If you think you have some sort of contraindication there</p>
<p>that work with a medical specialist without question,</p>
<p>those situations you laid out though were very real.</p>
<p>A lot of people are living like that.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s important for those folks to understand</p>
<p>if you are going through symptoms, fatigue,</p>
<p>lack of focus, cognitive function, performance isn&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>then hey, like you may be under salted.</p>
<p>And again, actually a good amount of blood chemistry work</p>
<p>can unravel that a lot.</p>
<p>And it can sort of tell you if you&rsquo;re running out of whack.</p>
<p>There are a number of folks who are extremely sensitive</p>
<p>to sodium in terms of health risk.</p>
<p>And that is a real thing.</p>
<p>Again, work with your individual folks on that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t work with anyone for disease treatment</p>
<p>or management at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said that probably four times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it six more times.</p>
<p>I only take people who are healthy</p>
<p>and try to make them perform at their best possible level.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually funny you mentioned that</p>
<p>because I was going to give people my recommendation</p>
<p>for sodium intake in general throughout the day.</p>
<p>And then I decided I&rsquo;m not going to say that</p>
<p>because all it&rsquo;s going to do is make all the rest</p>
<p>of the people who aren&rsquo;t coming to come after me</p>
<p>for the watermelon comment, come after me for that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll say that number.</p>
<p>Well, by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>the goal is that everyone&rsquo;s coming after you,</p>
<p>but also that everyone has learned something of value.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already given us tremendous insights</p>
<p>and actionable information on creatine and hydration.</p>
<p>And along those lines, I&rsquo;d love for you to tell us</p>
<p>about some of the things that we can do</p>
<p>with supplementation in order to enhance training</p>
<p>by taking certain things before we train.</p>
<p>And I also have the question of how long before training</p>
<p>should we start thinking about supplying nutrients</p>
<p>and supplements for the training session?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I actually finished my five</p>
<p>or maybe I wasn&rsquo;t clear enough about the last one.</p>
<p>So I just want to tie that bow</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll go to the next one.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it was probably my fault.</p>
<p>So Matt, in addition to the Galpin equation</p>
<p>in terms of amount,</p>
<p>I ran a recommended at roughly three to one</p>
<p>sodium to potassium recommendation.</p>
<p>And I gave you some rough numbers for things like that.</p>
<p>I actually, in all honesty,</p>
<p>use probably six to 10 different electrolyte companies,</p>
<p>depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Some of them are really good.</p>
<p>In the case, again, like Element,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s nice about that is there&rsquo;s no carbohydrate.</p>
<p>However, the downside is there&rsquo;s no carbohydrate.</p>
<p>So sometimes I want carbohydrates in the training</p>
<p>because as you mentioned, there&rsquo;s significant evidence</p>
<p>going back actually several decades</p>
<p>on the benefit of carbohydrate during exercise.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in a situation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to, again,</p>
<p>maximize actual exercise performance,</p>
<p>especially if it is either a long duration,</p>
<p>so more than two hours or extremely high intensity,</p>
<p>and this has to be well north of 100% of your VO2 max.</p>
<p>In that situation,</p>
<p>as we talked about in the endurance episode,</p>
<p>you can actually start having a decrement in performance</p>
<p>because of a drop of muscle glycogen.</p>
<p>Liver glycogen can start coming down.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>augmenting with the carbohydrates during the training</p>
<p>that is going to enhance performance,</p>
<p>do what we call spare the liver,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to keep my second rule of my four,</p>
<p>which is maintain a glucose ingestion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to keep that going.</p>
<p>In general, what you&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>is the number is like a five to 9%</p>
<p>glucose concentration in your fluid,</p>
<p>which turns out to be like exactly the number</p>
<p>that most sports drinks have,</p>
<p>as well as I think that&rsquo;s pretty much exactly</p>
<p>what a coconut water is.</p>
<p>The downside of sports drinks, since we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>is they actually tend to be under salted</p>
<p>and so that they don&rsquo;t provide enough of them.</p>
<p>If you look at the numbers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to say something like 60 to 100 grams</p>
<p>of carbohydrate per hour is the target.</p>
<p>And now if you&rsquo;re using the sort of Galvin equation</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re splitting that up into 15 minute intervals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something again, like 20 or so grams of carbs</p>
<p>per 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing, again, an hour long plus training about.</p>
<p>So admittedly, 100 grams is a bit much for some folk,</p>
<p>depending on your size.</p>
<p>So I would recommend starting in that 60 gram or so range,</p>
<p>again, per hour total is what you want to get to.</p>
<p>And only in the situation in which</p>
<p>muscle glycogen depletion is becoming a limiting factor</p>
<p>to performance.</p>
<p>So the other benefit of that is, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>that actually drives water into the cell.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re going to be in that nice sweet spot</p>
<p>of you&rsquo;re actually keeping glucose going,</p>
<p>which is going to enhance performance</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re helping hydration at the same time.</p>
<p>So the other little part</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important to pay attention to here is</p>
<p>the type of carbohydrate matters.</p>
<p>So you can use actually a whole combination</p>
<p>of things called resistant starches,</p>
<p>which I will use for a long bouts of exercise.</p>
<p>But in the middle of the workout,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to focus on glucose and fructose,</p>
<p>mostly glucose.</p>
<p>Typically at least a two or three to one ratio</p>
<p>of glucose to fructose.</p>
<p>And the reason is those actually get into tissue</p>
<p>through separate transporters.</p>
<p>And so what happens is once the glucose transporters</p>
<p>get full, you can&rsquo;t bring anything else in.</p>
<p>However, since fructose comes in a separate route,</p>
<p>you can maximize total carbohydrate intake</p>
<p>by using two different unique forms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways you can do this,</p>
<p>but this is where the Momentous Fuel product</p>
<p>is like specifically has that exactly in it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>You can use food, no problem.</p>
<p>You can use a combination of things like honey</p>
<p>and different easily absorbable and usable</p>
<p>and things that you can actually like maybe put in a drink</p>
<p>to get away with.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots of routes for it,</p>
<p>but you want to look in that sort of combination</p>
<p>of five to 9% roughly glucose for there.</p>
<p>So you do need to train your gut.</p>
<p>So do not do anything.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a generally a good rule.</p>
<p>Do not do anything in your competition</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve never done in practice.</p>
<p>So try these food items, try these amounts,</p>
<p>the carbohydrate numbers, try the sodium numbers,</p>
<p>try the total amount of water, start low.</p>
<p>You can always increase.</p>
<p>What you don&rsquo;t want to do is have to run out</p>
<p>during the middle of your spin class</p>
<p>and sprint to the bathroom and hope nobody&rsquo;s in your way,</p>
<p>which in the lab we&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just say accidents like that occur more than once.</p>
<p>So just be careful of your stomach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>to acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>and wellbeing can only be analyzed</p>
<p>from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests</p>
<p>out there, however, is that you get information back</p>
<p>about various levels of lipids and hormones</p>
<p>and metabolic factors, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with that information.</p>
<p>InsideTracker makes knowing what to do</p>
<p>with all that information exceedingly easy.</p>
<p>They have a personalized platform</p>
<p>that lets you see what your specific numbers are,</p>
<p>of course, but then also what sorts</p>
<p>of behavioral do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts,</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional changes,</p>
<p>what sorts of supplementation would allow you</p>
<p>to bring those levels into the ranges</p>
<p>that are optimal for you.</p>

<p>I realized I jumped the gun a little bit</p>
<p>at asking you about supplementation</p>
<p>for before, during, and after a workout</p>
<p>because what I neglected to ask about</p>
<p>was training in the fasted state.</p>
<p>This is something that we talked about</p>
<p>in an earlier episode,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s worth highlighting now.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best way to supplement, if you will,</p>
<p>a workout or pre-workout is ingesting nothing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of these people.</p>
<p>I actually prefer to do my weight training</p>
<p>somewhere between 7 and 8 a.m. each morning,</p>
<p>sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little bit later.</p>
<p>I drink fluid, water, and I do ingest caffeine</p>
<p>prior to those training days.</p>
<p>On days when I don&rsquo;t train, I do,</p>
<p>as I often recommend people do,</p>
<p>delay my caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>But in any event, it&rsquo;s water and caffeine,</p>
<p>yerba mate or coffee or some sort of stimulant</p>
<p>for weight training workouts,</p>
<p>and generally not for cardiovascular training workouts,</p>
<p>although sometimes, yes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m training fasted.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m ingesting carbohydrate the night before</p>
<p>to make sure that I have glycogen stores</p>
<p>that are topped off.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s fasted, but with that caveat.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on training fasted?</p>
<p>And what I just described is fasted overnight,</p>
<p>but some people are training in the afternoon</p>
<p>and they may opt to not eat anything in the, you know,</p>
<p>two to four hours prior to training, or maybe even longer.</p>
<p>I personally find that caffeine hits my system a lot better</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m fasted.</p>
<p>Better meaning it just seems to have more of a potent effect.</p>
<p>So there are some reasons for that.</p>
<p>And of course, we dissuade people from ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>too late in the day, because it&rsquo;ll disrupt sleep.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying fast for three hours,</p>
<p>then drink caffeine, but who knows?</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s in your protocol.</p>
<p>The simple version of this question is,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on training fasted?</p>
<p>And if people are going to train fasted,</p>
<p>how should they modulate their fluid intake, if at all?</p>
<p>What happens with exercise?</p>
<p>In the endurance and metabolism episode,</p>
<p>we walk through and the fact that no matter</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re using for fuel, carbohydrates or fat,</p>
<p>or even other potential sources,</p>
<p>the end product of all of those is ATP, CO2 and water.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to make ATP, that is the fuel for exercise.</p>
<p>Now, ATP is adenosine triphosphate.</p>
<p>So one, two, three phosphates on top of an adenosine.</p>
<p>Well, what you may have not put together</p>
<p>is if you hydrolyze ATP</p>
<p>and you break off one of those phosphates,</p>
<p>you now have ADP.</p>
<p>If you do it again, you have AMP, adenosine monophosphate.</p>
<p>If you do it one more time, now you just have adenosine.</p>
<p>And if you have then therefore run through a lot</p>
<p>of exercise, burned a lot of energy,</p>
<p>you have increased the amount of adenosine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s floating around.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a high concentration of adenosine,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that going to make you want to do?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to bind to certain receptors.</p>
<p>And when we know when those receptors get bound to,</p>
<p>you fall asleep.</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>Caffeine will competitively bind to those receptors.</p>
<p>Therefore, that&rsquo;s why caffeine stops you</p>
<p>from feeling like you want to go to sleep, right?</p>
<p>So we have a very clear relationship between exercise fuel.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at the literature,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a pretty clear relationship</p>
<p>between the more caloric expenditure in different sports</p>
<p>and the higher amount of hours needed for sleep.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a nice tie between how hard you&rsquo;re exercising,</p>
<p>how much energy you&rsquo;re burning,</p>
<p>how much you need to sleep, stimulants,</p>
<p>which brings us all the way back to your question of fueling.</p>
<p>So do I need to fuel prior to my exercise bout?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to be limited in your exercise bout by fuel,</p>
<p>then fueling is necessary one way or the other.</p>
<p>If it is a type of training that is not,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s not going to matter.</p>
<p>And so the examples we gave,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to go do a 30 second bout</p>
<p>of maximal exertion, and you&rsquo;re going to do it one time,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to worry about fueling at all.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re eating within your workout</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s only 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Yeah, you got 30 seconds.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to worry about hydration post-exercise.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to worry about recovery.</p>
<p>Total energy expenditure is nothing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to go, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go practice,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go to the driving range</p>
<p>and practice your golf swing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to worry about it.</p>
<p>The total amount of energy expenditure is just not high.</p>
<p>In fact, in that case,</p>
<p>you might want to keep it somewhat low</p>
<p>because you want to keep blood glucose fairly even,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to bring it into the system.</p>
<p>You certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want to use stimulants, right?</p>
<p>So you may get over exerted inside.</p>
<p>In all of these things,</p>
<p>we probably should have started off</p>
<p>our conversation with this.</p>
<p>In terms of macronutrients,</p>
<p>the total amount throughout the day</p>
<p>is more important generally than the timing of them,</p>
<p>which is why you can do things like</p>
<p>have a bunch of carbohydrate at night,</p>
<p>not eat the next morning and lift and be just fine.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you didn&rsquo;t have them</p>
<p>in a few hours before,</p>
<p>your muscle glycogen is topped off,</p>
<p>your liver&rsquo;s glycogen is topped off,</p>
<p>you have plenty of fuel.</p>
<p>Even if you were to wait a few more hours,</p>
<p>in fact, even if you were to do conditioning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably fine.</p>
<p>I have plenty of athletes that prefer</p>
<p>to do many of their training sessions</p>
<p>faster than morning for personal reasons,</p>
<p>not because it enhances performance,</p>
<p>but if it doesn&rsquo;t enhance or harm it,</p>
<p>then, and it&rsquo;s a personal preference thing, fine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna go do a session though,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to be really concerned</p>
<p>with muscle glycogen depletion,</p>
<p>and again, you can go back to that episode</p>
<p>to learn different types,</p>
<p>when those thresholds hits and what you worry about,</p>
<p>then the fueling would be important.</p>
<p>You would either need to have something</p>
<p>before the session or consume it during the session.</p>
<p>So one of the other things we&rsquo;d like to say here</p>
<p>is recovery starts during the previous workout, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re working out right now</p>
<p>and you optimize nutrition right now,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t necessarily need it</p>
<p>for the current workout,</p>
<p>if you can get ahead on recovery,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna be fine the next day.</p>
<p>And the differentiation here</p>
<p>between carbohydrate and protein is important.</p>
<p>So the total amount of protein you ingest</p>
<p>throughout the day is probably a bigger determinant</p>
<p>for things like muscle growth than the timing.</p>
<p>So the post-exercise anabolic window,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily matter.</p>
<p>Carbohydrate is different.</p>
<p>The timing of that does matter.</p>
<p>It needs to be around and available</p>
<p>so you can maximize both hydration</p>
<p>and muscle glycogen resynthesis,</p>
<p>which is restoring the muscle glycogen</p>
<p>you burned during exercise.</p>
<p>I also work with athletes that train multiple times a day.</p>
<p>So in those particular cases,</p>
<p>a recovery window is half what you normally have.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in a situation</p>
<p>where you have two or three days before you work out again,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to worry</p>
<p>about getting carbohydrate in before, during, or after.</p>
<p>Because by the time you go to train again,</p>
<p>you will have restored your muscle glycogen levels easily.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re training every day or twice in a day,</p>
<p>then the timing of carbohydrate really starts to matter.</p>
<p>In that case, I see no reason</p>
<p>to not ingest those nutrients</p>
<p>either before, during, or after.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to necessarily do it,</p>
<p>but you can.</p>
<p>The general rule of thumb I give is something like this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing something</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to really work hard,</p>
<p>whether this is hypertrophy training</p>
<p>or a lot of endurance,</p>
<p>energy expenditure is gonna be high,</p>
<p>potential muscle damage is high,</p>
<p>and or energy utilization is high.</p>
<p>What you wanna look for is a number,</p>
<p>something in the area of like half a gram of carbohydrate</p>
<p>per pound of body weight.</p>
<p>So you weigh 200 pounds.</p>
<p>You wanna make sure that either pre, mid, or post, or total,</p>
<p>you bring in 100 grams of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a very rough number to start.</p>
<p>Protein is about half of that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about a quarter of your body weight, right?</p>
<p>So those numbers would be if you&rsquo;re 200 pounds,</p>
<p>make sure you have 100 grams of carbs</p>
<p>and 50 grams of protein.</p>
<p>And again, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be before,</p>
<p>or during, or after, and you&rsquo;ll be in a good spot.</p>
<p>All you need to do then is alter,</p>
<p>what I do, I should say,</p>
<p>is alter the amount of carbohydrate</p>
<p>based on energy expenditure.</p>
<p>So a lower energy and easier workout,</p>
<p>instead of having 100 grams of carbs,</p>
<p>I might tack that down to 75 or even 50</p>
<p>and be at a one-to-one carb protein ratio.</p>
<p>If it was even harder, more sun, hotter outside,</p>
<p>more fluid loss, I might go from 100 grams of carbs</p>
<p>up to 150 or 200 and get closer to like a three-to-one</p>
<p>or four-to-one carbohydrate to protein ratio.</p>
<p>So those are the numbers that I generally go by.</p>
<p>Well, as I take a sip of my double espresso Americano here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to tell us about stimulants.</p>
<p>Sure, there&rsquo;s no shortage of these in most of our lives.</p>
<p>And of course you can cover the health benefits of it later.</p>
<p>Maybe you have an episode.</p>
<p>Yes, we have an episode on caffeine</p>
<p>and it does have certain health benefits,</p>
<p>although one has to use caffeine correctly</p>
<p>in order to drive those.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, caffeine is the easy one to start with</p>
<p>and we won&rsquo;t belabor the point here.</p>
<p>The evidence is strong.</p>
<p>It has an ergogenic effect.</p>
<p>You can take it at whatever dosage is reasonable for you.</p>
<p>And of course there is a bit of a learning curve there</p>
<p>such that obviously the more you take it,</p>
<p>the more you need to take,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s actually some recent evidence showing</p>
<p>even folks who are acclimated to it</p>
<p>will still see an ergogenic benefit</p>
<p>even though if they don&rsquo;t feel a big boost of it.</p>
<p>So typically that takes 30 to 45 minutes or so,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s highly dependent upon the person.</p>
<p>So some people can smell coffee and immediately feel better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably working actually</p>
<p>through a different mechanism of anticipation,</p>
<p>but you can take it there.</p>
<p>The half-life of it is, you know,</p>
<p>four to six hours or something like that.</p>
<p>It can totally depends on the person.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t let it ruin your sleep.</p>
<p>But if you take it prior to performance,</p>
<p>it has a noticeable effect on particularly endurance.</p>
<p>Maximum strength may be less, well, quite clearly less so.</p>
<p>In fact, the data are mixed there</p>
<p>on whether it actually does anything for peak strength.</p>
<p>Although I think most people would suggest that, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna take it prior to trying to truly lift</p>
<p>as high as trying to, you know,</p>
<p>lift a one repetition max or similar.</p>
<p>But most of the documented effects</p>
<p>are on the endurance-based activities.</p>
<p>Yes, so my read of the literature</p>
<p>in terms of performance-enhancing effects of caffeine</p>
<p>are that one to three milligrams.</p>
<p>I wanna make sure that people hear the units correctly</p>
<p>before people blitz themselves out with that caffeine.</p>
<p>One to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight</p>
<p>about 30 minutes prior to exercise</p>
<p>has a definite performance-enhancing effect.</p>
<p>It also has a definite</p>
<p>mental performance-enhancing effect,</p>
<p>especially when people who are regular caffeine users</p>
<p>have abstained from caffeine</p>
<p>for anywhere from two to 15 days.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an extremely rare circumstance.</p>
<p>But even if they have not,</p>
<p>it appears that one to three milligrams per kilogram</p>
<p>of body weight of caffeine taken about,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s not super precise as far as I can see,</p>
<p>about 30 minutes before the event starts</p>
<p>can really enhance reaction time and power output.</p>
<p>As well as, as you mentioned, endurance.</p>
<p>When I was researching the caffeine episode,</p>
<p>one interesting caveat that I discovered</p>
<p>was that if people are not caffeine adapted,</p>
<p>they are not regular users of caffeine,</p>
<p>the sudden introduction of caffeine</p>
<p>can really degrade performance,</p>
<p>mostly because people don&rsquo;t know how to operate</p>
<p>at that high level of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>Have you ever observed that?</p>
<p>Yeah, 100%.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s actually data going up</p>
<p>as high as 10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>In fact, once you cross the five milligram</p>
<p>per kilogram threshold,</p>
<p>you will start seeing performance decrements.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s absolutely such a thing</p>
<p>of ruining your performance with too much caffeine.</p>
<p>So most people listening to this,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re thinking, wow, they said caffeine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all in and then you just stop listening</p>
<p>and now you go for your quad espresso shot</p>
<p>before every time you go to work out,</p>
<p>you probably are passing that threshold.</p>
<p>If you think about those numbers,</p>
<p>one to three milligrams per kilogram body weight.</p>
<p>If you weigh 100 kilograms, that&rsquo;s 220 pounds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be something like two to 500 milligrams of caffeine,</p>
<p>which is like a pretty high amount.</p>
<p>But a coffee is gonna get you close</p>
<p>and espresso is gonna get you somewhat in that ballpark</p>
<p>depending on source and stuff.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t really need to go</p>
<p>and blister your brain with caffeine.</p>
<p>In fact, if you do, it&rsquo;s quite common</p>
<p>and in fact likely that you&rsquo;ll actually</p>
<p>make performance worse.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The amount of caffeine in different coffees</p>
<p>and sodas, et cetera, of course varies.</p>
<p>One thing that people ought to know</p>
<p>is that the smallest of commercially available coffees</p>
<p>at the most popular commercial vendors</p>
<p>generally contain anywhere from 250</p>
<p>to 350 milligrams of caffeine.</p>
<p>What that means is that the so-called medium</p>
<p>and the large contain as much as 500 milligrams</p>
<p>or one gram of caffeine.</p>
<p>So for you morning large coffee</p>
<p>at a commercial vendor drinkers,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re wondering why you get a headache</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re 30 minutes late on that caffeine</p>
<p>or if you can&rsquo;t access that caffeine at all,</p>
<p>or even if you&rsquo;re drinking coffee, excuse me,</p>
<p>from another source and you&rsquo;re finding like,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s really not doing it for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because the amount of caffeine</p>
<p>in the now commercially sold coffees</p>
<p>is exceedingly high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about two or three times higher</p>
<p>than the standard lookup tables</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll see on the internet.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying that to demonize caffeine.</p>
<p>We can pretty quickly adapt to</p>
<p>and form a tolerance to caffeine.</p>
<p>Some people never really can get over the jitters.</p>
<p>Other people are just fine</p>
<p>with even a thousand milligrams of caffeine,</p>
<p>but only because they&rsquo;ve been drinking</p>
<p>a lot of caffeine consistently.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also wildly inconsistent from location to location,</p>
<p>the brew type, the functionality.</p>
<p>So yeah, that stuff can be very hard</p>
<p>to figure out what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one way really</p>
<p>to objectively measure caffeine</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s use caffeine tablets.</p>
<p>And they work pretty well.</p>
<p>Actually, someone I know who&rsquo;s prominent</p>
<p>in the podcast space uses 100 to 200 milligrams</p>
<p>of caffeine in tablet form combined with tea.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve now conditioned themselves</p>
<p>to think that herbal tea actually</p>
<p>has this caffeinating effect.</p>
<p>But tablet form caffeine,</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m not recommending it to outright,</p>
<p>it is going to give you the best sense</p>
<p>of how much caffeine you can tolerate</p>
<p>and how much is performance enhancing</p>
<p>or is performance degrading.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually another line</p>
<p>of supplementation that we can go down here,</p>
<p>which is not technically a stimulant,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something I use to help performance</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t want caffeine.</p>
<p>And so this thing specifically,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re one of those folks who have to exercise at night</p>
<p>and you want a little bit of boost for your training,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to have caffeine</p>
<p>because it messes up your sleep.</p>
<p>And this is when you can turn</p>
<p>to the whole like citrulline, arginine,</p>
<p>nitric oxide sort of route.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll skip the explanation there,</p>
<p>but effectively what happens is nitric oxide</p>
<p>is this wonderful compound that causes vasodilation.</p>
<p>And of course that&rsquo;s going to aid then</p>
<p>in transporting nutrients in and out of the cell.</p>
<p>So it has an ergogenic effect.</p>
<p>You have a number of ways you can go about this.</p>
<p>Some of them have more pros and cons than others.</p>
<p>And there are more and more data coming out</p>
<p>specifically on citrulline and more recently.</p>
<p>If you look though, in my opinion,</p>
<p>the most consistent evidence for the most consistent effect</p>
<p>is in the supplement of beetroot or beetroot juice</p>
<p>or extract or something like that.</p>
<p>So you can find those supplements and they tend to,</p>
<p>again, they&rsquo;re pretty effective at enhancing performance,</p>
<p>specifically anything moderate to longer duration</p>
<p>endurance performance, and they are not a stimulant.</p>
<p>So they won&rsquo;t ruin your sleep that much.</p>
<p>One note of caution for those of you</p>
<p>that are interested in citrulline or beetroot,</p>
<p>because they are in the arginine pathway,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who has a predisposition to cold sores,</p>
<p>oral cold sores that is, or other forms of cold sores,</p>
<p>that because activation of the arginine pathway</p>
<p>can exacerbate some of the neural related aspects</p>
<p>of cold sores, and that&rsquo;s because the viruses</p>
<p>that cause those cold sores actually live on neurons,</p>
<p>then you want to be very cautious with citrulline,</p>
<p>especially high dose citrulline.</p>
<p>I can really amplify the cold sore response.</p>
<p>What about non-stimulant yet focus enhancing supplements?</p>
<p>Things like alpha GPC, for example,</p>
<p>I routinely use 300 to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC</p>
<p>prior to hard physical training, typically weight training,</p>
<p>but occasionally I&rsquo;ll take 300 milligrams of alpha GPC</p>
<p>prior to a mental workout, less often these days,</p>
<p>because I kind of reserve it for physical training,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t tend to use it every day,</p>
<p>maybe once every third or fourth workout</p>
<p>combined with caffeine,</p>
<p>so that combination is pretty potent, I find.</p>
<p>And so technically, because it&rsquo;s a cholinergic agonist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a stimulant in the traditional sense,</p>
<p>but it has a focusing</p>
<p>and an alertness promoting aspect to it.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on those sorts of compounds?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much human exercise performance data on those.</p>
<p>There are certainly cognitive functioning tests on those,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not gonna find a lot of information,</p>
<p>though there isn&rsquo;t none.</p>
<p>We actually will use many of these substances,</p>
<p>you could globally call them nootropics,</p>
<p>which is any substance</p>
<p>that specifically enhances brain function</p>
<p>is a rough way to think about it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use them prior to more challenging bouts of training.</p>
<p>This is something that we&rsquo;ll pull out,</p>
<p>say, on the sparring day only,</p>
<p>or the most important training session,</p>
<p>or a session when you&rsquo;re trying to work on pitch command,</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re trying to enhance,</p>
<p>work on your shot as a basketball player,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re really trying to improve a certain swing</p>
<p>as a golfer or something like that.</p>
<p>But we do not use them every day.</p>
<p>We do not use them with every person.</p>
<p>So yeah, we will use those.</p>
<p>They are not stimulants,</p>
<p>but they can be performance enhancing.</p>
<p>And another kind of way to think about this is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the case of caloric restriction,</p>
<p>so whether you&rsquo;re trying to lose weight,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re actually trying to control weight</p>
<p>for weight purposes in terms of sports</p>
<p>where you have to be in a certain weight class</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>while we may not be able to give you food,</p>
<p>in fact, we may not be able to give you stimulants</p>
<p>because of the sleep thing,</p>
<p>or because we&rsquo;re already maxed out on stimulants,</p>
<p>now we can go this route.</p>
<p>And so at least mentally, you&rsquo;re a little bit there,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re more likely to be alert and focused,</p>
<p>and you can train harder</p>
<p>despite the fact that we didn&rsquo;t actually change fuel.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a little bit of a short game</p>
<p>in terms of that&rsquo;s not your permanent solution.</p>
<p>You eventually need to bring calories up</p>
<p>or whatever other training you&rsquo;re training</p>
<p>or whatever you&rsquo;re going to do,</p>
<p>but it can work in a nice short pinch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested to learn from you about fatigue reducers</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m hoping that Rhodiola Rosea</p>
<p>will come up in the conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah, great.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just start right there then.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a lot of research on this</p>
<p>despite most people not having heard of it.</p>
<p>I think I mentioned in a previous episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used it a lot over many, many years.</p>
<p>You have to be a little bit careful of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, well, first of all, no,</p>
<p>we should have said this at the onset,</p>
<p>no supplement is a panacea, right?</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s going to work for everything,</p>
<p>and Rhodiola is no different.</p>
<p>It can have a number of effects.</p>
<p>If you look across the literature,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find generally somewhere</p>
<p>between a small benefit to little benefit,</p>
<p>but not often is it detrimental with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>I know of a handful of papers</p>
<p>that would be two specifically,</p>
<p>where it may actually reduce muscular endurance.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>If you think about what&rsquo;s happening is</p>
<p>one of the benefits that has been seen so far</p>
<p>with Rhodiola is helpful at managing cortisol,</p>
<p>but cortisol suppression is not a necessarily good thing.</p>
<p>We talked about how if you do an acute bout of stress,</p>
<p>cortisol will go way up.</p>
<p>And that is a sign of acute stress.</p>
<p>However, a sign of long-term excessive stress</p>
<p>is cortisol suppression.</p>
<p>And so this is a thing to be really careful of</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re feeling down or lethargic or tired,</p>
<p>and you think your adrenals are messed up,</p>
<p>and then you start taking cortisol modulators,</p>
<p>you could be making the problem worse</p>
<p>because now your cortisol is actually suppressed.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re taking these things to blunt it</p>
<p>or keep it low, and you continue to feel lethargic</p>
<p>and lack of desire and libido and focus</p>
<p>and sort of all these things.</p>
<p>So cortisol is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>We want this to be going up and down</p>
<p>in the amounts that we want.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re thinking about like, for example, waking up,</p>
<p>you would want generally something like a 50% reduction</p>
<p>in the first hour in terms of cortisol concentrations.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re extremely suppressed already,</p>
<p>going down is only gonna be a problem.</p>
<p>So Rhodiola has a good evidence base</p>
<p>to support it for that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see actually a number of studies</p>
<p>that have looked at it in a whole host of areas</p>
<p>for benefits.</p>
<p>So something good to do.</p>
<p>The difficult part with Rhodiola, to be quite honest,</p>
<p>is getting it from a high quality brand and source.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to get as a single source,</p>
<p>which is a very, very important thing to do</p>
<p>with supplements is try to get them sourced alone.</p>
<p>Rhodiola typically comes in combination</p>
<p>with any other herbals or other stuff,</p>
<p>adrenal support, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And also then getting them then third-party certified,</p>
<p>which for most folks is not necessary,</p>
<p>but for any athletes</p>
<p>that need to go through drug testing systems,</p>
<p>you should not take any supplement at all</p>
<p>that does not have some sort of third-party certification.</p>
<p>So those are the challenges.</p>
<p>That being said, if you&rsquo;ve ever ran into somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s taken Rhodiola and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t do anything for me, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you know, nothing works for everyone.</p>
<p>It also could be just very poor quality sourcing.</p>
<p>So if you look at the,</p>
<p>there have been a number of papers</p>
<p>on its perception of fatigue.</p>
<p>And you sort of mentioned that you felt</p>
<p>pretty immediate effects of taking it a few times.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m fairly sensitive to supplements,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve started taking Rhodiola before workouts</p>
<p>and found that I could push much harder,</p>
<p>much longer through the workout.</p>
<p>Normally I would, or typically before taking it,</p>
<p>that is in sessions where I did not take it,</p>
<p>I would be able to work out very hard for 20 minutes or so.</p>
<p>The next 10 minutes, I could get some workout put</p>
<p>and then the remaining period of time,</p>
<p>it was kind of a tapering off.</p>
<p>Now, granted, these are very intense training sessions.</p>
<p>These are not the endurance training sessions.</p>
<p>These are the weight training sessions</p>
<p>that one time per week per body part type sessions.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve noticed is I can complete the entire 60 minutes</p>
<p>with minimal fatigue now.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously I hit fatigues within sets</p>
<p>and of course, you remain human despite taking it,</p>
<p>but I found it to be very useful</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been using it whenever I use Alpha-GPC</p>
<p>prior to workouts.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been impressed by it overall.</p>
<p>I do wanna highlight something that you said</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s so, so vitally important,</p>
<p>which is that using single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>for most things is critical to figuring out</p>
<p>what works for you, what doesn&rsquo;t, what dosages you need,</p>
<p>being able to take things two on, one off,</p>
<p>two days on, one day off, for instance,</p>
<p>being able to increase dosage in the morning</p>
<p>and then maybe reduce the dosage</p>
<p>and combine with something else in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>are pretty much the only way to do that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s perhaps only one supplement that I take at all</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s Athletic Greens</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;ve been a regular podcast sponsor for a long time,</p>
<p>that is a cocktail of many, many things.</p>
<p>And those are all adaptogens</p>
<p>as well as some probiotics and vitamins</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not opposed to blends</p>
<p>where the blends include a lot of nutrients</p>
<p>that are synergistic,</p>
<p>but for all pill capsule based supplements</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m looking for a very targeted effect</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just about some foundational nutrition,</p>
<p>I really believe strongly</p>
<p>that single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>are the way that you can build a rational approach</p>
<p>to supplementation and also make adjustments</p>
<p>if something isn&rsquo;t making you feel better</p>
<p>and also make adjustments</p>
<p>if something&rsquo;s really working for you.</p>
<p>So for instance,</p>
<p>some people might take alpha GPC 300 milligrams</p>
<p>and not feel anything, go up to 600 milligrams,</p>
<p>maybe just feel kind of eh, they don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Other people like myself</p>
<p>took 300 milligrams of alpha GPC the first time.</p>
<p>I was like, wow, this really puts me in the zone,</p>
<p>but I wanna be really careful how often I use it.</p>
<p>I did mention I go up to 600 milligrams occasionally,</p>
<p>but that really puts me on the outer threshold</p>
<p>of kind of overall levels of focus and amped up</p>
<p>such that if I drink too much caffeine,</p>
<p>it can tilt me over the edge.</p>
<p>So I encourage people to become scientists of themselves</p>
<p>and the only way to do that</p>
<p>is to try and limit the number of variables.</p>
<p>And the final point is that</p>
<p>I think that single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>are by far the best in terms of changing things over time.</p>
<p>This could be women during their menstrual cycle</p>
<p>might find that during certain phases of the cycle,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more sensitive to certain things than not others.</p>
<p>And for men and women,</p>
<p>it may be that certain times of year even</p>
<p>and certain supplements might go better closer to sleep</p>
<p>some earlier in the day and on and on and on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no real way in my opinion</p>
<p>to have a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that involves lots and lots of blends.</p>
<p>One or two blends, okay, but lots of blends,</p>
<p>I actually think that&rsquo;s potentially dangerous territory.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, just take rhodiola as a good example.</p>
<p>I know a new meta-analysis came out</p>
<p>just in the last few months looking at it</p>
<p>and they found in general,</p>
<p>you see again a slight to moderate improvement</p>
<p>in everything from a power output</p>
<p>to fatigue resistant antioxidant effects</p>
<p>to endurance performance.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, okay, great.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a little bit here.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s say you went to do it</p>
<p>and the only way you could access rhodiola</p>
<p>is in combination with that and some lion&rsquo;s mane</p>
<p>and some other of these adaptogens.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, wait a minute,</p>
<p>I just wanted to take this to get a better workout,</p>
<p>but now it also came with this stimulant</p>
<p>or this cortisol suppressor or cortisol activator.</p>
<p>Well, now all of a sudden you can&rsquo;t take it at night</p>
<p>or you can&rsquo;t take it in the morning</p>
<p>because you already had coffee.</p>
<p>Your options are just way limited.</p>
<p>So I think the biggest part of all that</p>
<p>is if something doesn&rsquo;t feel good,</p>
<p>you have absolutely no idea.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know if it was rhodiola.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know if it was the boswellian that&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know if it was any of the other things</p>
<p>that were smashed in there</p>
<p>or it could be something as simple as the citric acid</p>
<p>they use, like some other combination of thing.</p>
<p>And now here you are thinking that some supplement</p>
<p>that actually works for you doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and you throw that out of your repertoire</p>
<p>for the rest of your life, which is, you know,</p>
<p>not the biggest crime, but it&rsquo;s not needed</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not really going to know.</p>
<p>So yeah, I fully stamped.</p>
<p>You can look back at my course lectures for the last decade</p>
<p>and you will see like stamped number one</p>
<p>on the supplemental sections is make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking single ingredient supplements at all costs.</p>
<p>The last part about that too is you&rsquo;re more likely</p>
<p>to ensure the amount that is on the label is correct.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re taking rhodiola and it says, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hundred milligrams in there.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s only thing that&rsquo;s in there,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely than not to actually get something close.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re never perfect, but it will be close.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s in a combination of 20 other things,</p>
<p>you actually don&rsquo;t have any idea that&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>In fact, there have been many papers on melatonin</p>
<p>and vitamin D and a number of other supplements</p>
<p>in which when you actually just pull them off the shelf,</p>
<p>these are standard studies where they would go</p>
<p>and buy say like 20 to 25 different supplements</p>
<p>in the case of melatonin.</p>
<p>And it will actually measure the amount of melatonin</p>
<p>actually in them.</p>
<p>And despite the fact that the label says five milligrams,</p>
<p>they can be up to a 500 to a thousand fold</p>
<p>actual concentration in that supplement.</p>
<p>And then you wonder why some people react great</p>
<p>to melatonin and some people that absolutely destroys you.</p>
<p>And this is also why like we&rsquo;ll actually,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see this constantly where people will have</p>
<p>like 500 times the upper limit of melatonin</p>
<p>the morning after.</p>
<p>When the half-life is supposed to be more like 90 minutes,</p>
<p>it should be totally gone.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re seeing extremely high,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even talking like double,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking 10, 20, 30 X,</p>
<p>the upper limit range for melatonin the next morning.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, well, what are you taking?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, I got this melatonin at X store</p>
<p>or X website and you&rsquo;re like, holy cow.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not opposed to melatonin theoretically,</p>
<p>but you have to be careful with that one in particular.</p>
<p>So any supplement has that to be true.</p>
<p>So you want to buy them from as many places as you can</p>
<p>that are high quality.</p>
<p>And if they are third-party tested,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not a performance athlete,</p>
<p>I want to stress this,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not a performance athlete,</p>
<p>third-party certified and tested supplements are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re less likely to just get wildly high concentrations</p>
<p>or low concentrations of active ingredients.</p>
<p>And so relative to other ones who you might get for cheaper,</p>
<p>but you could be totally wrecking yourself</p>
<p>by getting 50 milligrams of melatonin every night</p>
<p>and not realizing it.</p>
<p>So then of course, the next morning</p>
<p>you drown yourself in caffeine</p>
<p>and then you can see what death cycle you&rsquo;re in now.</p>
<p>Yeah, and people can look for third-party certification</p>
<p>on the packaging.</p>
<p>And some websites will allow you to zoom in</p>
<p>on the bottle beforehand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s largely listed on certain vendor websites.</p>
<p>A brief point about supplement cost and blends.</p>
<p>And I promise this will be a brief point.</p>
<p>Different ingredients,</p>
<p>meaning different types of supplements</p>
<p>have widely varying costs</p>
<p>in order to get them to manufacture them.</p>
<p>So oftentimes what you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>is that blends will include the least amount</p>
<p>of the most expensive ingredient, right?</p>
<p>Not always the case.</p>
<p>There are certain exceptions to this.</p>
<p>And I mentioned some blends that I like a few minutes ago</p>
<p>that are for foundational nutrition,</p>
<p>adaptogens and probiotics.</p>
<p>Athletic greens, of course,</p>
<p>just being one of several examples out there.</p>
<p>But when it comes to say a sleep blend</p>
<p>or a pre-workout blend,</p>
<p>there are some decent products out there,</p>
<p>but a lot of them tend to put in</p>
<p>more of the least expensive ingredients</p>
<p>and less of the ones that you&rsquo;re actively seeking.</p>
<p>And so those tend to be,</p>
<p>caffeine tends to be a kind of a buffer</p>
<p>against the other things.</p>
<p>Meaning if you pre-workout,</p>
<p>putting caffeine in there isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing,</p>
<p>but if it has five other things in there,</p>
<p>oftentimes what manufacturers will cheat on</p>
<p>is the actual amount of the things that are costly.</p>
<p>So again, single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>for 80% of your supplements,</p>
<p>I think is really the way to go.</p>
<p>And the other thing that I know is gonna come up</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re talking about all these supplements</p>
<p>is this issue of dependency.</p>
<p>I often get this question.</p>
<p>And when I solicited for questions on social media</p>
<p>in anticipation of this episode,</p>
<p>number of people said,</p>
<p>okay, so if you take a sleep formulation,</p>
<p>do I need to take it every night?</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t take it,</p>
<p>will I have an incredibly hard time sleeping?</p>
<p>If I take a pre-workout every time I train,</p>
<p>will I need it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Some people will take supplement holidays</p>
<p>as they may be called for a couple of days each week,</p>
<p>back to back.</p>
<p>Some people take them straight through.</p>
<p>I myself take a sleep cocktail.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve described this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s magnesium, theanine and things.</p>
<p>This is not one ingredient.</p>
<p>These are multiple ingredients.</p>
<p>In fact, precisely because some people who have sleep,</p>
<p>walking and vivid dream issues</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take theanine before bed.</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ve had times</p>
<p>when I either forgot my supplements, that&rsquo;s rare,</p>
<p>or I just didn&rsquo;t have what I needed</p>
<p>or just simply took a break for a night</p>
<p>and it was not a problem.</p>
<p>But in terms of pre-workout,</p>
<p>I do think that people become dependent</p>
<p>on being in that really ramped up state.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think we view all this as like true dependency,</p>
<p>kind of like addiction.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I mean, I define addiction as a progressive narrowing</p>
<p>of the things that bring you pleasure.</p>
<p>So, I suppose people could get addicted to pre-workout,</p>
<p>but it seems a little unlikely.</p>
<p>More likely there would be a dependency</p>
<p>such that if you didn&rsquo;t have your pre-workout,</p>
<p>you might feel like, oh, you&rsquo;re not motivated to train.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts</p>
<p>on taking little holidays from supplements</p>
<p>and varying the frequency of supplement intake,</p>
<p>in particular as it relates to stimulants</p>
<p>and fatigue reducers?</p>
<p>The end goal anytime I coach somebody</p>
<p>is to get them into a physiological state</p>
<p>in which they require no or close to no supplementation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the target.</p>
<p>We should really be in a position</p>
<p>to where our lifestyle, our sunlight exposure,</p>
<p>our stress management, our physical activity,</p>
<p>our sleep and our hydration</p>
<p>and our whole food nutrition</p>
<p>provide us almost everything we need.</p>
<p>Now, look, again, there are some foundational items</p>
<p>that we can give people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve put together a little bundle actually for this,</p>
<p>the basic things that you can go look at.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the goal, right?</p>
<p>So the target is to let your physiology run the game.</p>
<p>Your physiology is way smarter than we are.</p>
<p>Even if I take a bunch of biomarkers from you,</p>
<p>your physiology still knows better</p>
<p>than those few markers can tell me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s always where we&rsquo;re ending up.</p>
<p>I actually personally don&rsquo;t like people being in a position</p>
<p>that they have to take a supplement for anything.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like it if you have to take a supplement</p>
<p>to have a good night of sleep.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it if you have to have a supplement to train.</p>
<p>We will use any of these stimulants very, very carefully</p>
<p>with any of the athletes we work with</p>
<p>and certainly for the non-athletes</p>
<p>because at least the athletes, we have an end date.</p>
<p>We have a fight scheduled.</p>
<p>We have a season.</p>
<p>We have a game you&rsquo;re gonna pitch, whatever.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of like you&rsquo;re in this endless cycle of,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re just gonna do that all day, every day.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really need to be in that spot.</p>
<p>So the way that I describe my philosophy is</p>
<p>I will use those short-term tactics</p>
<p>to symptom manage if I have to.</p>
<p>So if somebody comes to me and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling awful and we&rsquo;ve gotta get through the hump.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll give you something for sleep immediately</p>
<p>to get you sleeping.</p>
<p>That allows us to then come back</p>
<p>and work on the causal problem, right?</p>
<p>So this is, why are you having a hard time sleeping anyways?</p>
<p>If you have to take a nine cocktail supplement to sleep,</p>
<p>then all we&rsquo;re doing is blinding the reason.</p>
<p>Why are you in that position to begin with, right?</p>
<p>So we see this all the time, whether it is sleep problems,</p>
<p>whether it is cortisol or testosterone,</p>
<p>the question is, well, why is that low?</p>
<p>Now we may give you something again</p>
<p>to manage it immediately,</p>
<p>but the task, the mystery I&rsquo;m going to try to unveil is why?</p>
<p>Why is it there to begin with?</p>
<p>This could be something like, this is natural for you</p>
<p>and your lack of energy is something else.</p>
<p>Or it could be, actually it is not a natural level for you,</p>
<p>but something is suppressing it.</p>
<p>Any number of, you&rsquo;ve got some infection going on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some allergic reaction</p>
<p>to something in your environment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mold, mercury, like that one comes up a lot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see mercury in folks</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s causing a lot of problems</p>
<p>or any number of heavy metals or toxins,</p>
<p>any host of things, psychological distress, bad daily habit.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t ever see the sun, like you don&rsquo;t ever sweat.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t ever drink.</p>
<p>We was talking about so many things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m always going to hunt for that.</p>
<p>And I hate using this phrase,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s highly maligned for a good reason, but root cause.</p>
<p>All right, so we&rsquo;re trying to find that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, are we making sure</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not causing this problem?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to want to give you a supplement</p>
<p>to cover up something</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not even trying to solve the problem</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s being there.</p>
<p>That being said, am I that concerned</p>
<p>about people taking a multivitamin?</p>
<p>Just all throughout, no, not really.</p>
<p>Am I concerned about people taking creatine?</p>
<p>No, like go ahead.</p>
<p>Those ones are generally pretty fine to just take,</p>
<p>but anything else, I want a reason.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like giving people anything</p>
<p>in a super physiological concentration</p>
<p>or a super food concentration, right?</p>
<p>So again, an amount you wouldn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>in a normal food dosage,</p>
<p>unless we have really a specific reason.</p>
<p>Some of these things are more problematic.</p>
<p>Others are less problematic.</p>
<p>So to answer the question of dependency,</p>
<p>you have a combination</p>
<p>of actual physiological dependency, caffeine.</p>
<p>Like that actually creates a physiological dependency</p>
<p>versus a emotional or psychological dependency</p>
<p>or just a, I like drinking this.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s my habit, that&rsquo;s my routine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fancy scientific phrase for that,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So yeah, we want to get off that.</p>
<p>And like, again, my personal philosophy is</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you dependent upon anything.</p>
<p>I want to create extremely resilient people</p>
<p>and I want to create physiological resilience.</p>
<p>We actually have a fancy little algorithm we use</p>
<p>to measure that in people.</p>
<p>And so we can actually calculate that number.</p>
<p>And the goal of us is to push that number higher</p>
<p>so that we don&rsquo;t have to have anything.</p>
<p>So many situations pop up in your real life</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not going to have your supplement</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not going to have your routine</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not going to have your journal or whatever,</p>
<p>but also for the long-term.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to create a situation</p>
<p>in which this is a short-term success</p>
<p>that you have to now do that the rest of your life.</p>
<p>No, let&rsquo;s just get out of the way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s fix the problem.</p>
<p>If there is something, symptom management, that&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re actually searching</p>
<p>for better foundational habits.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to say about this is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re only covering symptom,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really missing signal, right?</p>
<p>Which is if you&rsquo;re constantly tired throughout the day</p>
<p>and all you&rsquo;re doing is giving yourself a number</p>
<p>of alpha GPCs and caffeines, et cetera,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s good literature over here,</p>
<p>are you really just using that</p>
<p>to allow your poor sleep hygiene to happen?</p>
<p>If they took those away, I bet you,</p>
<p>you would actually start addressing your sleep</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the cause, right?</p>
<p>Or your stress or your poor hydration.</p>
<p>Like you would go hunting for the problem.</p>
<p>And so you want to walk a fine line here</p>
<p>of going like, hey, look,</p>
<p>is an athletic greens supplement that big a deal?</p>
<p>No, probably not.</p>
<p>But wait a minute, am I actually now covering</p>
<p>up the pain point that is maybe needed?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a signal to actually get my ass in gear</p>
<p>to go make one of these changes, whatever it needs to be.</p>
<p>So I know I&rsquo;ve got like a little bit meta on you</p>
<p>and a little bit philosophical,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s honestly how I approach it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s really important that a friend of mine</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a physician has a great saying,</p>
<p>which is better living through chemistry</p>
<p>still requires better living.</p>
<p>Boy, that&rsquo;s golden, that&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>And it pertains also to things like antidepressants</p>
<p>and ADHD drugs and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Most all of those things were developed as tools</p>
<p>to allow people to move from a maladaptive state.</p>
<p>Okay, maladaptive is hard to define,</p>
<p>but think about in any domain of life,</p>
<p>you can either be back on your heels,</p>
<p>flat-footed or forward center of mass.</p>
<p>And there are times when people are so compromised</p>
<p>neurochemically that they need to use pharmacology</p>
<p>in order to get into a flat-footed position.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re really back on their heels,</p>
<p>flat-footed or forward center of mass.</p>
<p>But the idea was always</p>
<p>that those things were developed as things</p>
<p>to allow people to engage in the sorts of behaviors</p>
<p>that can produce the same sorts of neurochemical shifts.</p>
<p>And if people are thinking,</p>
<p>well, what sorts of behaviors</p>
<p>can induce these neurochemical shifts?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just zoom out myself for a moment here and say,</p>
<p>I am a big proponent, and I believe you are as well,</p>
<p>if I may, in doing behavioral tools first,</p>
<p>whenever possible, really establishing good habits,</p>
<p>the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts, which we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about</p>
<p>in this series and in this episode.</p>
<p>Then excellent nutrition, which involves do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts,</p>
<p>volume, food choice, timing, all the factors.</p>
<p>And then also supplementation.</p>
<p>And also there is sometimes a case</p>
<p>for prescription drugs, certainly.</p>
<p>And often brain machine interface</p>
<p>or body machine interface, measuring stuff, using devices.</p>
<p>But the foundation of behaviors and good nutrition</p>
<p>are really truly foundational.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard in anything to skip steps,</p>
<p>but supplements and prescription drugs are one place</p>
<p>where people often skip steps.</p>
<p>And then they don&rsquo;t actually learn</p>
<p>how to cultivate the best behavioral practices,</p>
<p>including the don&rsquo;ts, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>And then just one more point along these lines.</p>
<p>You talked about taking anything for energy</p>
<p>is really disruptive to the system.</p>
<p>And it is because especially caffeine,</p>
<p>while it has its uses and even health benefits,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really borrowing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s against the adenosine system with interest.</p>
<p>And so because caffeine acts</p>
<p>as an adenosine antagonist effectively,</p>
<p>while caffeine is present in those receptors,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel as sleepy, you have more energy,</p>
<p>your reaction time goes down,</p>
<p>memories, enhanced focus, performance of all kinds.</p>
<p>Yes, but then when that caffeine</p>
<p>is dislodged from the receptor,</p>
<p>then the adenosine can act even more potently</p>
<p>at those receptors.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like being able to borrow</p>
<p>against the normal variations in wakefulness and sleep.</p>
<p>And this is why we encourage people,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not training first thing in the morning</p>
<p>to push their caffeine intake out</p>
<p>about 90 to 120 minutes after waking,</p>
<p>so they can clear some of that adenosine in the morning,</p>
<p>which tends to happen even after we wake up.</p>
<p>People can listen to episodes on master your sleep</p>
<p>or perfect sleep or the caffeine episodes</p>
<p>to understand more about that.</p>
<p>But the final thing I just wanna say here,</p>
<p>and then it prompts a question,</p>
<p>is in thinking about supplement protocols,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people assume</p>
<p>that once they start taking something,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have to take it all the time.</p>
<p>And one idea perhaps is that people have some alpha GPC</p>
<p>around that they could take,</p>
<p>and granted it&rsquo;d be great if people could try things</p>
<p>without having to buy a whole product.</p>
<p>I think companies hopefully are listening to this</p>
<p>and will give people a sample</p>
<p>to see if something works for them</p>
<p>and then give them an opportunity to try it,</p>
<p>to have things around,</p>
<p>but not necessarily assume</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna take it every time, right?</p>
<p>Some things you take every day,</p>
<p>foundational nutrition supplements, for instance,</p>
<p>but then also to take a look</p>
<p>at how well you&rsquo;re eating or not eating, right?</p>
<p>At times when I&rsquo;m eating much better,</p>
<p>I consuming low sugar fermented foods,</p>
<p>which are great for the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>I consume less probiotics.</p>
<p>If ever I&rsquo;ve been really compromised for whatever reason,</p>
<p>then I will take pill form probiotics,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t take those all the time</p>
<p>because I get them from food</p>
<p>and from certain green strains</p>
<p>like athletic greens and so forth.</p>
<p>So I think that nutrition and supplementation</p>
<p>are tethered in this way in my mind.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that most people think of supplementation</p>
<p>as something that where you can induce a lot of variability</p>
<p>in when and how you take them.</p>
<p>But as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,</p>
<p>as long as they&rsquo;re single ingredient formulations,</p>
<p>you can use supplements once a week if you want.</p>
<p>You can use them seven days a week.</p>
<p>You could use them twice a day, four times a day, every day,</p>
<p>or you could use them not at all.</p>
<p>Agreed?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Some of them will have an effect randomly like that.</p>
<p>Others will not.</p>
<p>And we talked about creatine being one of them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to take it once or so a week,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s, I mean, basically.</p>
<p>No benefit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good point.</p>
<p>Yeah, creatine.</p>
<p>Beta alanine is another fantastic example</p>
<p>of something you need to take consistently</p>
<p>if you want some sort of benefit.</p>
<p>It needs to be built up in muscle.</p>
<p>We need to use that to create carnosine,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s actually gonna help us</p>
<p>with our fatigue management.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we call it like an acid buffer.</p>
<p>So in our previous metabolism episode,</p>
<p>we talked about that being a major cause of fatigue.</p>
<p>The wonderful part,</p>
<p>one of the reasons why beta alanine works so effectively</p>
<p>is it blocks that buildup.</p>
<p>So that is an example of another one</p>
<p>that you would want to take.</p>
<p>Other things like fish oil,</p>
<p>you could certainly skip a day here and there.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be that big a deal.</p>
<p>I also do support your comment</p>
<p>of you can take absolutely none of these things</p>
<p>and be just fine.</p>
<p>In terms of, and we&rsquo;ll come back maybe</p>
<p>to beta alanine in a second.</p>
<p>In terms of some other fun stuff,</p>
<p>my colleague Greg Gosicki ran a really cool number</p>
<p>of studies looking at how exercise</p>
<p>actually alters the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>This is actually an area that I probably have</p>
<p>300 stool samples sitting in my freezer in my lab.</p>
<p>Oh goodness, another reason to pause</p>
<p>before entering your lab.</p>
<p>Yeah, another reason to not apply</p>
<p>to come be one of my graduate students.</p>
<p>Unless you want to deal with that.</p>
<p>We actually have a number,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve applied for a couple of grants</p>
<p>to look more into this,</p>
<p>specifically with females.</p>
<p>So hopefully we can get that funded.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, you can actually see</p>
<p>some pretty traumatic,</p>
<p>and I say that word on purpose,</p>
<p>changes in the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>This one in particular study I was thinking of</p>
<p>that Greg did is he looked at the changes</p>
<p>pre, post and ultra marathon.</p>
<p>And even within a single bout of exercise,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the sum of the markers,</p>
<p>but I know one of the markers</p>
<p>was specifically increased by like 14,000%.</p>
<p>After a single bout of exercise.</p>
<p>Now this is an ultra marathon.</p>
<p>This is like totally absurd amount of exercise</p>
<p>relative to what normal people would be.</p>
<p>But that number I remember,</p>
<p>it was like 14,229% or like something,</p>
<p>some random number like that.</p>
<p>Of something meaningful?</p>
<p>Yeah, something meaningful.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember which marker that was.</p>
<p>That had changed.</p>
<p>I know streptococcus was in there.</p>
<p>Streptococcus went up</p>
<p>maybe something more like 30 or 40 or 50%.</p>
<p>The point is we haven&rsquo;t even had the proper time</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t to even launch into the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Supplementation there needs to be ultra specific.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t be best served to just jump in</p>
<p>and take random things there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole area of emerging science.</p>
<p>We know very, very, very little about it,</p>
<p>but there is a number of actionable things</p>
<p>one could do there.</p>
<p>So probably something to not mess with.</p>
<p>Certainly work with a qualified physician</p>
<p>if you think you have something going on clinical</p>
<p>or some actual problem there.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t work with someone who&rsquo;s not a specialist,</p>
<p>a medical doctor there.</p>
<p>But just randomly assigning a bunch of probiotics</p>
<p>or prebiotics without intention</p>
<p>is maybe the next forefront of human performance research.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll have to maybe come back in a few years</p>
<p>and dive into that in detail.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you can bring somebody out</p>
<p>as an expert in that to discuss that.</p>
<p>Yeah, gut microbiome is fascinating.</p>
<p>I think of sleep as the most powerful</p>
<p>performance enhancing activity.</p>
<p>Of course, you still have to do the activity.</p>
<p>I consider it foundational.</p>
<p>It basically raises the tide on mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, performance of all kinds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s recent data that during sleep,</p>
<p>your body goes through all its various forms</p>
<p>of metabolism possible, which is amazing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s measured from breath in human subjects,</p>
<p>breath metabolites in human subjects.</p>
<p>So obviously, if one is thinking about supplementation</p>
<p>and wondering, okay, what&rsquo;s the best supplement</p>
<p>to enhance performance, you gave some great rationale</p>
<p>for why creatine would be an excellent choice</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re eating well and hydrating well.</p>
<p>And then to my mind, the next thing on the list</p>
<p>would be anything that allows you to improve the quality</p>
<p>and maybe even the duration of your sleep.</p>
<p>Although if you wake up and you feel rested</p>
<p>throughout the day and only need a short nap</p>
<p>in the afternoon, not everyone needs one,</p>
<p>but then generally that means you&rsquo;re feeling okay.</p>
<p>People sometimes get flipped onto this idea</p>
<p>that they have insomnia.</p>
<p>Insomnia is excessive daytime sleepiness</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re falling asleep during the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insomnia.</p>
<p>Could also be narcolepsy, but that&rsquo;s insomnia.</p>
<p>But supplementation to improve the quality</p>
<p>or duration of sleep or both,</p>
<p>seems to me like the most direct route,</p>
<p>even though actually technically it&rsquo;s an indirect route</p>
<p>to performance enhancement.</p>
<p>And then thinking about things that increase alertness</p>
<p>and stimulants and fatigue reducers.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a good logic?</p>
<p>Yeah, we go to absurd lengths</p>
<p>to dial sleep in as much as we can.</p>
<p>I mean, the honest answer is like truly absurd.</p>
<p>This is a conflict of interest that my company,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a part of this, Absolute Rest is the name</p>
<p>of that company.</p>
<p>We actually go out to your house</p>
<p>and run a full clinical grade sleep study</p>
<p>in your bedroom on you and run that over multiple nights.</p>
<p>So instead of having to go to a sleep clinic</p>
<p>and have it done in this weird hospital room</p>
<p>or sort of setting with these people looking at you</p>
<p>through a mirror, it&rsquo;s like totally creepy.</p>
<p>That is important because that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>to truly determine how you are sleeping.</p>
<p>Now that said, the technology of wearable trackers</p>
<p>is getting better.</p>
<p>In fact, I would actually predict those things</p>
<p>will reach a level of accuracy equivalent to the PSG</p>
<p>in the next couple of years</p>
<p>and probably we&rsquo;ll get FDA approval</p>
<p>to be able to diagnose officially sleep disorders.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my prediction from some inside information.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that to be true,</p>
<p>but it is getting a lot better.</p>
<p>Right now, those wearables are not accurate enough</p>
<p>to meet that threshold.</p>
<p>So what we do is we bring up basically all the equipment</p>
<p>to do that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll come in and do that.</p>
<p>Now, once we understand exactly how you&rsquo;re sleeping,</p>
<p>the next question is to answer,</p>
<p>why are you sleeping that way?</p>
<p>And so this is a full fourfold system.</p>
<p>Number one is we&rsquo;re going to look at biology,</p>
<p>which means you&rsquo;re going to take saliva and blood.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re looking at everything from neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>concentrations to vitamins, B6, B12, et cetera,</p>
<p>that are important for sleep performance.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to see, is it a physiological problem?</p>
<p>Is there something happening?</p>
<p>There is cortisol, DHEA ratio</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve previously talked about,</p>
<p>or is something like that off?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not physiology,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re going on the next one, which is environmental.</p>
<p>We run a full environmental scan of your bedroom</p>
<p>during those nights of sleep that were there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>because we can look at everything from dander</p>
<p>and pollen and allergens that are in the air.</p>
<p>A quick tip here is wash your sheets at least once a week.</p>
<p>One of the common, most common places</p>
<p>that people get allergens in the air</p>
<p>is actually from accumulation on your sheets.</p>
<p>So if you clean those more often,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be in a better spot.</p>
<p>And next one, the next one there also is like,</p>
<p>keep your, I&rsquo;m sorry, this hurts my heart.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even, in truthfulness, I violate this,</p>
<p>but keep your pets out of your bedroom</p>
<p>and certainly keep them off your bed.</p>
<p>Our ghostface killer is my dog and Noki&rsquo;s my other one.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t go on my bed, but they&rsquo;re right next to my bed.</p>
<p>So we violate that one.</p>
<p>But full environmental scan includes all those things.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s, we measure light and temperature</p>
<p>and humidity and everything else that&rsquo;s going on in the room.</p>
<p>Volatile organics that are coming out of the mattress,</p>
<p>formaldehyde, lead out of the wall,</p>
<p>like all of these things</p>
<p>that could potentially disrupt your sleep.</p>
<p>And we want to make sure</p>
<p>that none of those things are kicking on.</p>
<p>We see this constantly.</p>
<p>People will have things like trying to be cool</p>
<p>and they want to be cold at night because that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ll turn an air conditioner on or a fan,</p>
<p>but the air conditioner kicking on and off at night</p>
<p>actually can shoot you out of various sleep stages.</p>
<p>So you want to be really careful that it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>The last metric on that is actually CO2.</p>
<p>And so what you remember from our metabolism discussion</p>
<p>is when you exhale, you&rsquo;re breathing out CO2.</p>
<p>Well, if your room is closed and the ventilation isn&rsquo;t great,</p>
<p>the amount of CO2 in your room starts to build up.</p>
<p>And we actually very specifically know the threshold</p>
<p>based on information collected</p>
<p>from the International Space Station, actually.</p>
<p>We know the threshold at which CO2 crosses</p>
<p>and starts disrupting sleep.</p>
<p>So we want to make sure that you&rsquo;re not sitting</p>
<p>in this CO2 bath in front of your face</p>
<p>and then breathing it back in and disrupting your sleep.</p>
<p>So environment is the second one.</p>
<p>The third one is actually now psychology.</p>
<p>So one of the members on our team</p>
<p>is a Harvard MD in psychiatry</p>
<p>and put together an entire sleep scan survey.</p>
<p>So we run through all that to see</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s anxiety, depression,</p>
<p>anything like that psychologically going on.</p>
<p>And then the fourth one there</p>
<p>is if you have some sort of actual sleep pathology.</p>
<p>And so this again will include some eye tracking stuff</p>
<p>that we can use.</p>
<p>So we take all those data, they go back to our team.</p>
<p>We work in combination with Steve Lockey from Harvard,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done a ton of stuff.</p>
<p>He actually set up a lot of the circadian rhythm stuff</p>
<p>in the International Space Station as well.</p>
<p>Himself, Jeffrey Drummer, an MD, PhD, et cetera.</p>
<p>And all of these folks in a room go over your data,</p>
<p>identify what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>and build action plans off of that.</p>
<p>Occasionally, those action plans will include</p>
<p>supplementation, but only if necessary.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really gonna try to come back</p>
<p>and work through a system to improve the sleep</p>
<p>however is needed.</p>
<p>So I realize that is not totally accessible</p>
<p>for a lot of people,</p>
<p>but if you really need to go to the end of the earth</p>
<p>to figure out sleep, that service is available.</p>
<p>AbsoluteRest sounds like an amazing tool,</p>
<p>given that most people won&rsquo;t be able to use it</p>
<p>or access it, although we will provide a link</p>
<p>in case people are interested in it and do want to try it.</p>
<p>You mentioned a few things that I think everyone</p>
<p>should assay their sleeping environment for</p>
<p>and determine whether or not they are hindering their sleep</p>
<p>without realizing it.</p>
<p>For instance, the air conditioning going on and off,</p>
<p>or this could be heater going on and off,</p>
<p>or central heating or cooling unit.</p>
<p>This could be keeping the room dark.</p>
<p>This could be cleaning your sheets.</p>
<p>Certainly that doesn&rsquo;t require</p>
<p>that one sign up for AbsoluteRest.</p>
<p>So cleaning one&rsquo;s sheets routinely,</p>
<p>keeping pets out of the bedroom.</p>
<p>As you admitted, you don&rsquo;t entirely.</p>
<p>Different opinions about that,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re having sleep issues,</p>
<p>the dander from animals may be part of those issues.</p>
<p>And then one that I&rsquo;ll just add,</p>
<p>which I think is pretty interesting,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s some beautiful data out of Michael Terman&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at Columbia Medical School in New York</p>
<p>on negative ionization.</p>
<p>And this sounds pretty wacky, kind of new agey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some of you are like, negative ionization?</p>
<p>But listen, the Terman lab is a serious laboratory</p>
<p>focused on circadian biology for many decades now.</p>
<p>Negative ion concentrations are higher</p>
<p>near coastal locations.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve ever gone to the sea or gone on vacation</p>
<p>and you sleep better near a body of water,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually a real thing.</p>
<p>And there are negative ionization machines,</p>
<p>but there are also some things that one can do</p>
<p>in order to increase the negative ion concentration</p>
<p>in their sleeping environment</p>
<p>that are nearly zero cost, if not zero cost.</p>
<p>You can look those up online</p>
<p>and we probably will do an entire episode</p>
<p>about this in the future.</p>
<p>But I think what you described for absolute rest</p>
<p>really highlights a more general set of themes</p>
<p>that I think are really important,</p>
<p>which is your sleep environment is an environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a lot going on in it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s worth running through the checklist</p>
<p>that you described and asking,</p>
<p>where are things maybe not optimized,</p>
<p>but where am I really getting in my own way</p>
<p>in terms of sleep?</p>
<p>All of this, again, being related to the fact</p>
<p>that getting excellent sleep consistently</p>
<p>will completely transform everything that you do</p>
<p>and not getting excellent sleep consistently,</p>
<p>which is a challenge for so, so many people,</p>
<p>will also transform everything that you do</p>
<p>and think and feel, but in the negative direction.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can also offer a few tips on sleep</p>
<p>based on things we find most consistently</p>
<p>for those that can&rsquo;t go through the whole protocol.</p>
<p>One quick little actually app called Time Shifter</p>
<p>is really cool for anyone that&rsquo;s dealing</p>
<p>with consistent travel and jet lag.</p>
<p>So you can go and enter your location, your time,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going, the location,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;ll actually back calculate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll give you full light,</p>
<p>stimulant, food, hydration and stuff protocol,</p>
<p>and you just follow along with that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve used that for many years actually,</p>
<p>especially when traveling to like Abu Dhabi for advice</p>
<p>and Mongolia and Brazil for the Olympics</p>
<p>and sort of all over the place.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think that app is still available, I hope so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great, a nice tool.</p>
<p>A couple of things we found major,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re dealing with acid reflex,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re someone who has problems like that,</p>
<p>you can just elevate the head of your bed</p>
<p>by like six inches.</p>
<p>So if you put little piece of wood</p>
<p>or something underneath it,</p>
<p>you can also buy very inexpensive pillows</p>
<p>that can elevate that.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not solving the problem,</p>
<p>but at least it can help you sleep,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s just that night</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s a consistent problem, you can do there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re snoring, like I said, that&rsquo;s not really benign,</p>
<p>you should probably take a look at that.</p>
<p>Your first step there is mouth tape.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>you can go through what&rsquo;s called myofunctional therapy,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve covered that before,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically tongue exercises.</p>
<p>And that can be quite effective</p>
<p>specifically for people who have problems with REM sleep.</p>
<p>So myofunctional therapy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like you do like,</p>
<p>depending on the protocol,</p>
<p>some tongue exercises kind of in the morning,</p>
<p>afternoon and night.</p>
<p>And that takes a while, to be honest,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to need at least six weeks</p>
<p>before you start seeing anything,</p>
<p>but that actually is pretty well demonstrated</p>
<p>to help with sleep.</p>
<p>So you can probably Google,</p>
<p>we could find a link for exact protocols,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna describe all them,</p>
<p>but yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna strengthen your tongue</p>
<p>so that it stops falling in the back of your neck</p>
<p>and waking you up at night.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really easy free protocol to use.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling with,</p>
<p>it could be insomnia,</p>
<p>but it could be just things like when you get into bed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re super tired and you can&rsquo;t fall asleep</p>
<p>or things like that.</p>
<p>Kind of a basic rule of thumb we use</p>
<p>is only two things happen in your bed.</p>
<p>And if you can make sure</p>
<p>those are the only two things you do in your bed,</p>
<p>the problems of falling asleep or insomnia tend to go down.</p>
<p>Those two things are you have sex and you sleep</p>
<p>and nothing else goes down in your bed.</p>
<p>And so you can make that environment very special</p>
<p>and that can help quite effectively improve</p>
<p>your ability to fall asleep and then not wake up early.</p>
<p>So keeping that environment specific to what it&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>can be effective.</p>
<p>The only other thing I would think of is,</p>
<p>and I hate to say this cause it&rsquo;s not super practical,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just quite clear at this point,</p>
<p>sleeping with a partner in your bed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not very good for sleep.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Good luck with that one.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You can do a couple of things if it helps.</p>
<p>You can get two smaller beds</p>
<p>and put them right next to each other.</p>
<p>If you can actually have separate sheets,</p>
<p>that alone can be helpful.</p>
<p>So if you get, even if you&rsquo;re on a king sized bed</p>
<p>or something, and again, I know some people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like, there&rsquo;s no chance,</p>
<p>but if you want to know the cost for your,</p>
<p>like the effect-</p>
<p>You can end your relationship.</p>
<p>Lose your, use your loved one.</p>
<p>Ideally-</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t, please don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p>So the only last thing I want to mention here</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s popped up just a few times recently,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to see more of,</p>
<p>which is called orthosomnia.</p>
<p>So that is a term that people are growing concerned over,</p>
<p>which is wearables and sleep trackers causing sleep issues.</p>
<p>So people basically become too obsessed</p>
<p>with optimizing, maximizing scores.</p>
<p>And that alone will actually, it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>so you learn when to wake up.</p>
<p>And so you have actually an anticipatory response</p>
<p>when many hours prior to waking up.</p>
<p>So if you actually learn to have a little bit of a,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that little molecule of like excitement and reward?</p>
<p>Oh, dopamine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one.</p>
<p>If you start getting that,</p>
<p>cause you wake up and you get super excited</p>
<p>to check your score or your phone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same thing if you check your phone or Twitter</p>
<p>or whatever in the morning,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll actually start carving back your wake up time</p>
<p>because you start launching it.</p>
<p>So it can ruin sleep, becoming too obsessed.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ll say is if you&rsquo;re going to use a sleep tracker</p>
<p>and you just like, don&rsquo;t care,</p>
<p>you want to check it and you have fun with it, great.</p>
<p>But if like you are really, really, really interested in it</p>
<p>and you pay a lot of attention to it,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t check your sleep score</p>
<p>for at least the first 60 minutes after waking up.</p>
<p>And then that should help you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great tool.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ll, and piece of advice, I think generally,</p>
<p>because I think a lot of people are waking up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>checking their phone two or three times per night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of wondering why they&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s this anticipatory wake up circuit.</p>
<p>Yeah, you absolutely should use either your night mode</p>
<p>or do not disturb or airplane mode or something overnight.</p>
<p>Or leave it out of the room.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, if you have to wake up</p>
<p>and like some people have like a family member</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s maybe not in great health</p>
<p>and so they have to get their phone around</p>
<p>in case they call or things like that.</p>
<p>So I get it, you&rsquo;re like, I can&rsquo;t leave it out.</p>
<p>Leave it in there, leave it in, do not disturb</p>
<p>and enter in their phone number or whoever&rsquo;s phone number</p>
<p>so only they can get through, but keep it black and white.</p>
<p>So if you do have to look at your phone at night,</p>
<p>you see black and white and you do not have notifications.</p>
<p>So make sure that there&rsquo;s no notification for no email</p>
<p>and no DM, like get all that stuff off your screen.</p>
<p>And so you look at the, did anybody call?</p>
<p>Did anybody text of importance?</p>
<p>What time is it?</p>
<p>No emergency going on, black and white,</p>
<p>okay, right back to sleep.</p>
<p>So that can help a little bit.</p>
<p>One of the supplements that I&rsquo;ve found is extremely useful</p>
<p>for being able to fall back asleep</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve woken up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and for some reason can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And is also very effective for enhancing sleep</p>
<p>when one is ingesting fewer carbohydrates,</p>
<p>an issue that a lot of people run into.</p>
<p>Or for people that are fasting for many hours before sleep,</p>
<p>people are trying to not eat anything</p>
<p>within two to four hours,</p>
<p>but is inositol, 900 milligrams of myo-inositol.</p>
<p>I find, again, this is anecdata to be clear,</p>
<p>that if I wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve taken 900 milligrams of inositol</p>
<p>before initially falling asleep,</p>
<p>that I fall back asleep much more easily.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve added 900 milligrams of inositol</p>
<p>to my so-called sleep stack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also tried just taking it alone</p>
<p>and it works well alone,</p>
<p>but it works better, of course,</p>
<p>with the mag three and eight</p>
<p>Apogen and Theanine sleep stack.</p>
<p>Also in terms of tools for sleep,</p>
<p>the app Reverie that was developed by my colleague,</p>
<p>Dr. David Spiegel, who is a medical doctor</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine Psychiatry.</p>
<p>There is a free trial.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a nominal cost if you use it month to month,</p>
<p>but the data are really strong</p>
<p>that people that use that,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s eight to 11 minutes sleep hypnosis once a week,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be in the middle of the night</p>
<p>when you wake up,</p>
<p>really helps improve people&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to fall asleep quickly, stay asleep,</p>
<p>fall back asleep if they wake up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>In some cases, curing insomnia.</p>
<p>In other cases, really just helping people</p>
<p>with their general sleep issues.</p>
<p>And I mentioned this because obviously it&rsquo;s a technology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a supplement,</p>
<p>but I know that some people are supplement-averse.</p>
<p>Also, if you look at the cost comparison</p>
<p>between taking the sleep stack-</p>
<p>And the Reverie app, it&rsquo;s pennies on the dollar, really.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m a proponent of both for myself,</p>
<p>but I realize that people have varying budgets.</p>
<p>And again, I should say, as always, behavioral tools first.</p>
<p>And I think of the Reverie app</p>
<p>as more or less a behavioral tool.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really just a tool.</p>
<p>Any of these breathwork protocols, hypnosis protocols,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just a tool for you to touch back in</p>
<p>with your own physiology,</p>
<p>rather than a substance that&rsquo;s coming in.</p>
<p>So I fully support those.</p>
<p>We have used a number of those in protocols.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other tricks that we can pull in those areas.</p>
<p>I probably shouldn&rsquo;t say this,</p>
<p>but the reality of it is,</p>
<p>depending on what&rsquo;s keeping you up,</p>
<p>sometimes we recommend just getting up and getting it done.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s a project or a thing or whatever,</p>
<p>like sometimes rather than laying there all night,</p>
<p>not sleeping, you can get up, get it done.</p>
<p>And then if you stay awake, fine,</p>
<p>at least the anxiety is gone.</p>
<p>Or sometimes you can actually go back to sleep</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like, especially if the task</p>
<p>only literally would take like 10 or 15 minutes.</p>
<p>It may ruin your sleep,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna have ruined sleep anyways.</p>
<p>So you can try that tool.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna pull that card very often</p>
<p>and you have to be very careful</p>
<p>with what you consider to be something worthy of doing that.</p>
<p>But that is like between me and you and nobody else here,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tool I have used personally more than a few times,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just like, I get an idea and I don&rsquo;t lose it.</p>
<p>Or like the solution for something you&rsquo;ve been doodling on</p>
<p>for a long time pops in your head</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not wanting to forget it.</p>
<p>Just get up, get it done and get on with your day.</p>
<p>In several previous episodes,</p>
<p>you emphasized how exercise induces various adaptations,</p>
<p>depending on the type, specificity, volume, intensity,</p>
<p>et cetera, of the exercise.</p>
<p>And that during exercise,</p>
<p>the degree of adaptation that one triggers</p>
<p>is often associated with things</p>
<p>that normally we don&rsquo;t associate</p>
<p>with exercise related health.</p>
<p>Things like huge increases in blood pressure during exercise,</p>
<p>huge increases in inflammatory markers, muscle damage.</p>
<p>And these things all sound terrible,</p>
<p>but as you beautifully explained,</p>
<p>all of that triggers adaptations</p>
<p>that then bring those markers below the baseline</p>
<p>with which they were previous to the exercise.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the adaptation and the recovery.</p>
<p>Within the realm of supplementation and nutrition,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of a number of things,</p>
<p>some herbal, some lipid-based, other compounds</p>
<p>that are used for various things,</p>
<p>but that are known to have a potent anti-inflammatory effect.</p>
<p>Things like omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>ashwagandha for its effect on cortisol,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s a bit indirect to the inflammatory pathway,</p>
<p>curcumin, and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Given that we want inflammation</p>
<p>in order to trigger the adaptation response to exercise,</p>
<p>and given that we want to reduce inflammation</p>
<p>in the recovery period,</p>
<p>can we put together a logical framework</p>
<p>as to when is best to take anything anti-inflammatory,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s supplement-based or prescription</p>
<p>or over-the-counter drug,</p>
<p>and when to strictly avoid</p>
<p>taking any anti-inflammatory supplement</p>
<p>or a behavioral tool?</p>
<p>You mentioned ice can reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t want to do it too close to exercise.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think you get the gist of the question.</p>
<p>What about specific supplements</p>
<p>related to inflammation and anti-inflammatory responses?</p>
<p>What are the best ones?</p>
<p>When should we take them?</p>
<p>When should we avoid taking them?</p>
<p>The way that I think about it</p>
<p>is understanding what we call the fitness fatigue model.</p>
<p>So what I mean by that is</p>
<p>whenever you do some sort of insult,</p>
<p>the whole idea is for you to come back</p>
<p>and get an adaptation.</p>
<p>Now, recovery is not adaptation.</p>
<p>Recovery is recovery.</p>
<p>Adaptation is what happens after you&rsquo;re recovered.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a very important distinction there.</p>
<p>Fitness fatigue model says basically you&rsquo;ve done something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got an adaptation and you&rsquo;ve enhanced fitness.</p>
<p>And by fitness, in this case,</p>
<p>I mean it as a nonspecific term.</p>
<p>So you got stronger, you&rsquo;ve improved your endurance,</p>
<p>like whatever thing you&rsquo;re trying to train for.</p>
<p>At the same time though, you&rsquo;re fatigue elevated.</p>
<p>So what happens is if fitness increases</p>
<p>at the same or similar rate as fatigue,</p>
<p>your performance actually isn&rsquo;t any better.</p>
<p>And so you may think, oh, my program isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>I need to then train harder</p>
<p>or I need to take more anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>or whatever the things are.</p>
<p>When in reality, all you really need to do is reduce fatigue.</p>
<p>And if you do that, your performance will increase</p>
<p>and all the training adaptations will be actualized.</p>
<p>So the way that we do that is a couple of things.</p>
<p>First and foremost is actually a taper.</p>
<p>So the first step I think of,</p>
<p>if someone is training very, very hard</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not seeing any results</p>
<p>and we wanna think about supplementation.</p>
<p>Before I get there, I wanna think about taper and deload.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re actually training hard and sleep</p>
<p>and everything else is taken care of.</p>
<p>So just without going too far into taper,</p>
<p>some general parameters there.</p>
<p>You wanna think about about a 50% reduction</p>
<p>in training volume over the course of about a week</p>
<p>for every eight weeks of training.</p>
<p>Super, super rough, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve been training hard</p>
<p>for three months for something,</p>
<p>you might wanna taper for two weeks.</p>
<p>Something like that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of a rough estimate.</p>
<p>That taper, you actually don&rsquo;t need to reduce intensity</p>
<p>because intensity is not the driver of fatigue.</p>
<p>It tends to be volume.</p>
<p>So as long as your volume is reduced by 50%,</p>
<p>you can maintain intensity.</p>
<p>You can maintain, in fact,</p>
<p>I generally would recommend maintaining frequency.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re used to working out four days a week,</p>
<p>keep it four days a week.</p>
<p>You can go down a little bit in frequency,</p>
<p>but if you go down too much in frequency,</p>
<p>you actually tend to feel super lethargic.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>If you do those things correctly,</p>
<p>you can typically see somewhere between like a three</p>
<p>to 8% improvement in performance within a matter of days.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to do that.</p>
<p>We actually ran a study on cross-country runners years ago,</p>
<p>testing on a metabolic heart, muscle biopsies,</p>
<p>blood, a whole bunch of things.</p>
<p>And we did it pre and post three weeks of taper.</p>
<p>And we actually, this was cool</p>
<p>because we did this in competitive season.</p>
<p>So these were collegiate cross-country runners.</p>
<p>And we got them to come to our lab</p>
<p>three weeks before their conference championship,</p>
<p>ran them all through a bunch of testing, biopsied them.</p>
<p>They went through their three-week taper</p>
<p>and then we biopsied them again.</p>
<p>And then they went and ran</p>
<p>their conference championships and stuff.</p>
<p>Well, what happened was they ended up hitting</p>
<p>about a 50% reduction because what they did</p>
<p>is they took out what we call the junk volume.</p>
<p>So they kept their race tempos,</p>
<p>high intensity stuff in there.</p>
<p>They kept their recovery stuff.</p>
<p>And then that medium pace, they just basically reduced.</p>
<p>Now they were terrified as any endurance runner</p>
<p>or endurance athlete or participant would understand.</p>
<p>When you take volume away, they tend to get very nervous.</p>
<p>And so they didn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>But as a result of that, what we saw is their VO2 max,</p>
<p>despite the fact that they covered half the mileage,</p>
<p>their VO2 max did not go down</p>
<p>in three weeks of reduced taper.</p>
<p>Your fitness is extremely stable.</p>
<p>And in fact, once we actually looked at their data,</p>
<p>the enzymes in their muscle were responsible</p>
<p>for oxidative metabolism were maintained.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about losing,</p>
<p>again, fitness or we&rsquo;re talking about overall performance</p>
<p>or even oxygen capacity, mitochondrial function, et cetera.</p>
<p>That was all preserved.</p>
<p>Obviously we saw performance go up.</p>
<p>What was actually really interesting is we saw,</p>
<p>I think it was around a 10% increase in type two,</p>
<p>which are fast twitch muscle fiber size.</p>
<p>So we saw a 10% increase in fast twitch fiber size</p>
<p>at the end of three weeks of tapering.</p>
<p>Now, what you may think is like, wow,</p>
<p>I guess tapering is anabolic,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably not what happened.</p>
<p>What realistically probably happened</p>
<p>was their volume of training</p>
<p>was actually causing their fibers to be reduced in size.</p>
<p>And then once we removed that fatigue,</p>
<p>they just recovered back to normal.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good example of what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Once you remove the fatigue,</p>
<p>you can actually see enhancements in performance,</p>
<p>not because you&rsquo;re necessarily getting better,</p>
<p>but because you&rsquo;re removing</p>
<p>the stimuli that&rsquo;s suppressing you.</p>
<p>So that being said,</p>
<p>the way that you wanna think about recovery like this</p>
<p>is although recovery, especially like injury recovery,</p>
<p>like seems chaotic, biology is very organized</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a very specific three-step process</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna go through for recovery.</p>
<p>And then there are different supplements</p>
<p>that can help you in each of those three areas.</p>
<p>So area one is basically inflammation.</p>
<p>So this is when the cytokine storm comes rolling out,</p>
<p>it starts signaling the injuries there,</p>
<p>in this case, even if it&rsquo;s muscle damage,</p>
<p>and activates the immune system to kick on</p>
<p>and that whole repair process happens there.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re trying to do effectively,</p>
<p>in fact, this is why you probably ever wonder like,</p>
<p>why is inflammation a thing?</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re trying to do is bring in fluid,</p>
<p>enhance the size and increase blood flow in</p>
<p>so that you can get nutrients for repair</p>
<p>and immune cells and everything like that in the system</p>
<p>and get the waste out.</p>
<p>So short-term inflammation,</p>
<p>even in the case of muscle soreness is the example</p>
<p>we talked about in the previous episode.</p>
<p>But any inflammation, it is part of the necessary process.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you would not wanna take an anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>in that state.</p>
<p>And so why you also would not wanna do things</p>
<p>like an ice bath.</p>
<p>So in that immediate inflammatory response time window,</p>
<p>this is seconds to hours after training,</p>
<p>you would wanna stay away from things like that.</p>
<p>A good option here are things like omega-3s.</p>
<p>Good evidence somewhere in the neighborhood</p>
<p>of like two to five grams total,</p>
<p>typically like a one-to-one EPA to DHA ratio is fine.</p>
<p>Similarly, this is another example of when good</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean more is better.</p>
<p>Because for example, there is actually evidence</p>
<p>showing up to 15 grams will harm the immune response.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t just wanna be like,</p>
<p>man, I&rsquo;m super sore, I&rsquo;m training harder,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna go to 10 grams a day or more and more,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually causing yourself more of a problem.</p>
<p>So antioxidants, anti-inflammatories are fine.</p>
<p>Again, omega-3s in that dosage are a decent thing.</p>
<p>You can also do something like 500 milligrams of curcumin</p>
<p>three times a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be enough to keep you in a decent spot.</p>
<p>There are some other things that you could look up,</p>
<p>maybe some potential benefit for ginger and beswellia</p>
<p>and some things like that for inflammation.</p>
<p>But unless we&rsquo;re in like very specific circumstances</p>
<p>where we have like an injury,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re probably not going to those areas.</p>
<p>I just wanted to highlight one thing</p>
<p>that came up in a previous episode.</p>
<p>Some, not all people, but some, including myself,</p>
<p>are very sensitive to curcumin.</p>
<p>It has a very potent effect in reducing DHT,</p>
<p>dihydrotestosterone, and leads to all sorts of clamping</p>
<p>of testosterone-associated positive things.</p>
<p>So I have experienced that myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had people write to me and say, I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I started taking a supplement.</p>
<p>Curcumin&rsquo;s supposed to be a great anti-inflammatory.</p>
<p>It flatlined my libido.</p>
<p>It took away my drive</p>
<p>and kind of wondering what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>
<p>Those people are very likely to be very DHT-sensitive.</p>
<p>Curcumin, while it&rsquo;s a potent anti-inflammatory,</p>
<p>can also potently reduce DHT,</p>
<p>but some people tolerate it quite well</p>
<p>and are hearing this and probably think that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s certainly substantiated</p>
<p>by the biochemical pathways that curcumin taps into</p>
<p>in the known roles of DHT on libido aggression,</p>
<p>power output, et cetera, and mood.</p>
<p>So just be wary that A, there&rsquo;s no way to predict this.</p>
<p>One simply has to figure it out empirically,</p>
<p>meaning you have to try and see if you like it or don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The good news is those negative effects on DHT</p>
<p>seem to reverse pretty quickly</p>
<p>after ceasing to take curcumin.</p>
<p>So just a mention of something</p>
<p>that came up in a previous episode,</p>
<p>but in case people didn&rsquo;t hear that on that segment,</p>
<p>just wanted to highlight those facts.</p>
<p>Further evidence, I strongly discourage,</p>
<p>strongly discourage taking anything</p>
<p>in the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant realm</p>
<p>unless you actually have a reason to do so.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re waking up and you&rsquo;re like, maybe I&rsquo;m inflamed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably not a good approach.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a reason to do so.</p>
<p>Step two is actually what we call proliferation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of like the cleanup crew.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re going to be going in there</p>
<p>and cleaning out dead cells and debris</p>
<p>and misfolded proteins and things like that.</p>
<p>At this stage,</p>
<p>a fantastic evidence-based supplement is glutamine.</p>
<p>Glutamine, 20 grams a day.</p>
<p>We typically honestly split it up into two dosage,</p>
<p>10 grams morning, 10 grams night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a conditional amino acid, which means you can make it,</p>
<p>your body can make enough of it at times</p>
<p>and other times you may want to support it.</p>
<p>Generally those conditional times are things</p>
<p>like burn victims, high stress situations</p>
<p>or injury, things like that.</p>
<p>So there isn&rsquo;t also like a ton of downside to glutamine</p>
<p>because it can go through a transamination,</p>
<p>which means your body can take it and say like,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need anything here for our muscle recovery.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make it into something else</p>
<p>and use it for whatever else is needed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of another one of these like low risk products.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why you see it in a lot of recovery products.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ever wondering like,</p>
<p>what the heck is that in there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need amino acids.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re thinking it&rsquo;s like for protein synthesis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not, it&rsquo;s because of this,</p>
<p>it is beneficial to this proliferation process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking glutamine for years.</p>
<p>I tend to take it in higher dosages</p>
<p>several times throughout the day</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m ever feeling particularly rundown.</p>
<p>I know there are decent data, not great,</p>
<p>but decent data on the role of glutamine for leaky gut.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>For offsetting leaky gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting a little bit into the realm</p>
<p>of like not super well substantiated,</p>
<p>but in the peer reviewed literature,</p>
<p>but a lot of anecdata</p>
<p>and certainly some peer reviewed work, but not a ton.</p>
<p>And then there is also growing interest</p>
<p>in the idea that glutamine,</p>
<p>because it can trigger activation of the neurons in the gut</p>
<p>that signal to the dopamine pathway in the brain,</p>
<p>that it can be used to offset sugar cravings.</p>
<p>This is kind of an interesting new and emerging theme,</p>
<p>which makes sense given the biology of the neurons</p>
<p>in the gut that respond to specific amino acids,</p>
<p>including glutamine, essential fatty acids, and sugar.</p>
<p>And because they respond to any and all three of those,</p>
<p>any one or combination of those, I should say,</p>
<p>to trigger this dopamine response.</p>
<p>Some people have taken to a teaspoon or so of glutamine</p>
<p>in some water or other drink a couple of times</p>
<p>throughout the day as a way to reduce</p>
<p>their sugar cravings,</p>
<p>because what it&rsquo;s essentially doing</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s tricking the pathway into activation</p>
<p>of those neurons through an alternate</p>
<p>ligand receptor interaction.</p>
<p>Right, also another interesting point,</p>
<p>there are very, I&rsquo;m trying to think right now</p>
<p>off the top of my head,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a time, and I&rsquo;ve used glutamine a lot,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a time where I&rsquo;ve ever heard anybody</p>
<p>come back with any side effect reports.</p>
<p>I think if you take enough of it,</p>
<p>you can get some gastric distress,</p>
<p>but of course, you take enough of any powdered substance</p>
<p>mixed in water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get a gastric distress response.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ve noticed about gastric distress</p>
<p>with things like creatine, glutamine,</p>
<p>and even protein powders, for that matter,</p>
<p>I use a high quality whey protein powder routinely,</p>
<p>is that if you build up to it over the course of a few days,</p>
<p>then you can get away with using much higher dosages</p>
<p>without any issue.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, beta alanine is the same thing, by the way.</p>
<p>We sort of talked about that earlier.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever tried that and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, I feel like I&rsquo;ve just rolled around in grass</p>
<p>and my skin is itching everywhere.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s that ants under the skin sensation?</p>
<p>Yeah, all that stuff.</p>
<p>You can just take a little bit of a lower dosage</p>
<p>and be fine for the most part.</p>
<p>And then you will build up a tolerance</p>
<p>to that pretty quickly,</p>
<p>so you can up that dosage along the way.</p>
<p>So what we will oftentimes do there</p>
<p>is start at a dosage that&rsquo;s pretty minimal, like two grams.</p>
<p>And then every week or so, you can go up another gram</p>
<p>until you get to whatever final point</p>
<p>you wanna be five, six grams a day, whatever.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another way you can sort of mitigate that problem.</p>
<p>So the third step in this recovery process</p>
<p>after inflammation, proliferation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now into remodeling.</p>
<p>And this is when you&rsquo;re actually, quote unquote,</p>
<p>growing back bigger and stronger.</p>
<p>This is where the majority of the repair</p>
<p>is actually taking place.</p>
<p>And at this point, we&rsquo;re basically playing a micronutrient</p>
<p>and macronutrient game, right?</p>
<p>By that, I mean, we&rsquo;ve talked about basic macronutrients.</p>
<p>One thing to pay attention to,</p>
<p>oftentimes if people are hurt,</p>
<p>whether they had an injury or they&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>just they&rsquo;re super sore</p>
<p>and they are concerned about eating excess calories,</p>
<p>they tend to wanna eat less food during this process</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m not working out so much,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna eat less calories.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things that you have to pay attention to</p>
<p>is injury can increase basal metabolic rate by up to 10%.</p>
<p>So what you want to do in general</p>
<p>is just take your calories up about 10%,</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s what I recommend.</p>
<p>If that is an extended period of time,</p>
<p>then yes, you may put on a slight amount</p>
<p>of body fat or something.</p>
<p>But if that also means you come back some percentage faster,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s worth the exchange.</p>
<p>So we recommend that.</p>
<p>In terms of your carbohydrate or fat split,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not super worried about it.</p>
<p>My general recommendation is just don&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>any major changes relative to what you were doing, right?</p>
<p>Keep yourself pretty much in the same spot.</p>
<p>In terms of protein, this is the big one.</p>
<p>You want to make sure you are absolutely</p>
<p>at one gram per pound of body weight</p>
<p>because we need those amino acids to come in</p>
<p>and start helping with recovery.</p>
<p>One gram of protein per pound of body weight</p>
<p>or more or one gram?</p>
<p>Or more, yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s gonna be very little downside to having more.</p>
<p>Remember, protein and carbohydrates,</p>
<p>both stimulate insulin.</p>
<p>And remember, insulin is anabolic.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re trying to drive this process of recovery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you want both.</p>
<p>So you wouldn&rsquo;t want to skimp on carbohydrates</p>
<p>in this phase, nor would you want to skimp on protein</p>
<p>because you need the activation,</p>
<p>the drive into the tissue, as well as the structure.</p>
<p>Going back to one of our earlier conversations,</p>
<p>and at this point in the week,</p>
<p>I honestly can&rsquo;t remember at all</p>
<p>what episode we covered this in,</p>
<p>but I gave an analogy about making a campfire</p>
<p>and using fat and carbohydrates as the wood</p>
<p>and the log and the protein were the metal structure.</p>
<p>So you need that supply.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to bank,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve cleared out in the previous step,</p>
<p>damaged proteins and you need to make new ones</p>
<p>to recover that process,</p>
<p>you have to have the raw supply and material.</p>
<p>So you wouldn&rsquo;t want to avoid either one of those things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually some indirect inflammation management</p>
<p>that comes from fatty acids,</p>
<p>which you actually sort of alluded to earlier.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to necessarily go crazy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to change your fat intake that much.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t drop it, depending on where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a little bit of a higher carb,</p>
<p>lower fat person, great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re moderate, great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the indirect, if you&rsquo;re higher fat,</p>
<p>lower carb person, awesome.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t make an extreme change</p>
<p>and try to not be on the extremes</p>
<p>of either one of those ratios.</p>
<p>But the only specific number to pay attention to again</p>
<p>is that protein number.</p>
<p>And if you go a little bit high or even a lot high,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally fine.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t go low.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the macronutrient portion of remodeling.</p>
<p>In terms of micronutrients, to be honest,</p>
<p>you just get your bases covered.</p>
<p>This is when a basic multivitamin is effective.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re really trying to look at here</p>
<p>are vitamin A and zinc.</p>
<p>They actually have independent mechanisms</p>
<p>that are helpful here.</p>
<p>But those are typically covered in most multivitamins.</p>
<p>So we generally just give people a multivitamin.</p>
<p>Magnesium actually has some benefits here,</p>
<p>something like six milligrams per kilogram of body weight</p>
<p>is the dosage you&rsquo;re looking for there.</p>
<p>Magnesium citrate probably has the most evidence</p>
<p>in terms of this respect,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mean I actually have no reason</p>
<p>to think you couldn&rsquo;t use glycinate</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re using another form for sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably fine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that for sure,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t think of a reason why the other forms</p>
<p>of magnesium would all of a sudden not work.</p>
<p>So you could probably choose whichever form you like,</p>
<p>albeit citrate has probably the most research</p>
<p>in this aspect.</p>
<p>The only other things you would probably consider here,</p>
<p>three things.</p>
<p>Calcium might be on your list,</p>
<p>particularly if you&rsquo;re concerned</p>
<p>with some sort of bone injury</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve sort of gone past like recovery</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re actually like into injury.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll see that in recovery products occasionally</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>And then the last two ones of course are vitamin D</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s pretty well researched.</p>
<p>And then the last one is actually something</p>
<p>that can help you if you&rsquo;re at this stage</p>
<p>and you still are dealing with a lot of soreness or not,</p>
<p>and that is tart cherry juice.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually effective for both DOMS,</p>
<p>muscle injury, muscle soreness,</p>
<p>and actually has another benefit</p>
<p>of potentially aiding with sleep.</p>
<p>So not a bad one to turn to as well.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a number of companies that make these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then there&rsquo;s actually more ongoing research</p>
<p>that I know of on those areas,</p>
<p>but a promising literature we&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>Not often, but every once in a while on this podcast,</p>
<p>I will solicit social media for questions from the audience</p>
<p>where I should say the audience to be,</p>
<p>and then ask some of those questions on the fly</p>
<p>during the podcast.</p>
<p>I did this with Dr. Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it with you.</p>
<p>Your goal is to answer each of these questions,</p>
<p>certainly not all of them,</p>
<p>thousands of them within the last couple of hours,</p>
<p>to answer each of these questions</p>
<p>in three or four sentences.</p>
<p>I certainly won&rsquo;t be counting the number of sentences</p>
<p>that you speak.</p>
<p>So just know that if you wanna go over a little bit,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine, but feel free to refer to your Instagram site</p>
<p>at a future time where you might go more in depth</p>
<p>or to refer to a study, or if you like,</p>
<p>you can also say pass if you don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that you can answer the question succinctly enough</p>
<p>for this format.</p>
<p>And here, the goal is not to put you on the spot.</p>
<p>The goal is simply to allow the audience</p>
<p>to ask some questions directly.</p>
<p>And I confess I&rsquo;m looking at these for the first time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll try and be quick with my reading.</p>
<p>Some of these we may have touched on in previous episodes</p>
<p>or in this episode even,</p>
<p>in which case you can just kind of cue us to the reminder.</p>
<p>This is not directly related to supplementation,</p>
<p>but it is related to nutrition.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we touched on this directly.</p>
<p>Can we do intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>AKA time-restricted feeding, with keto</p>
<p>and still gain muscle mass?</p>
<p>TBD.</p>
<p>I am quite clear such study does not exist.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve alluded to before that we did run</p>
<p>an intermittent fasting 16-8 hypertrophy study.</p>
<p>There was no keto arm.</p>
<p>The results of that study, by the time this comes out,</p>
<p>will probably be ready, though I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t comment on it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked at the data.</p>
<p>But regarding whether or not if you did that with keto or not</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t comment scientifically.</p>
<p>Do you ever prescribe the use of GABA supplements?</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t prescribe anything,</p>
<p>just to make sure we&rsquo;re clear.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re a professor, you can profess.</p>
<p>I can profess.</p>
<p>We generally don&rsquo;t spend too much time on GABA, rarely.</p>
<p>Is it okay to wait, train, fasted,</p>
<p>then not break the fast and eat for three or four hours</p>
<p>after training?</p>
<p>So in other words, train, fasted, I do this,</p>
<p>but then also not eat immediately following training</p>
<p>and wait another three to four hours after training.</p>
<p>Once we have our results from our intermittent fasting study</p>
<p>back, we will have a better answer here.</p>
<p>My general recommendation as it stands now, though,</p>
<p>is as long as your total protein intake is sufficient,</p>
<p>you should be in a decent spot.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>A lot of questions about fasting and training,</p>
<p>just to note that.</p>
<p>Can you train high performance fasted</p>
<p>and how long before you need to refuel the body?</p>
<p>Yeah, you can certainly do that.</p>
<p>I know of actually many athletes,</p>
<p>some athletes that will do that,</p>
<p>though the vast majority will not.</p>
<p>As it gets higher and higher in intensity and or duration,</p>
<p>it gets more challenging,</p>
<p>but it really does come down to what you did</p>
<p>the day before as well.</p>
<p>So if you ate sufficient calories the day before,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t train and your glycogen stores are topped off,</p>
<p>you have a fighting chance.</p>
<p>Now, the duration part of that equation</p>
<p>is really kind of dependent upon you.</p>
<p>So are you really talking 30, 45 minutes, 60 minutes?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably fine.</p>
<p>And whether you&rsquo;re out past that in several hours,</p>
<p>you may not be.</p>
<p>And then the only other comment I would make is there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>keep in mind whenever you think about fasting</p>
<p>and any other, let&rsquo;s say against the textbook,</p>
<p>quote unquote style,</p>
<p>you really, really need to be careful</p>
<p>in thinking the difference between can I do it?</p>
<p>And is it optimal?</p>
<p>So I have absolutely no reason to think</p>
<p>fasting like that would improve performance.</p>
<p>I only work for the most part with people</p>
<p>who are trying to perform at the highest level possible.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t think of a scenario in which I would</p>
<p>go to fasting to try to enhance performance.</p>
<p>So whether or not you can maintain</p>
<p>some level of performance, probably.</p>
<p>Will it provide any benefit?</p>
<p>I struggle to find scenarios in which</p>
<p>that would actually make you perform better.</p>
<p>How do different forms of carbohydrates impact performance?</p>
<p>And then right below it,</p>
<p>another question about carbohydrates,</p>
<p>which is, does carbohydrate cycling work?</p>
<p>So these are two questions from people</p>
<p>that I think don&rsquo;t know one another,</p>
<p>but a lot of questions about carbohydrates and performance,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve touched on.</p>
<p>Anything else that you want to add to that conversation?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I really,</p>
<p>maybe you might want to think about carb loading</p>
<p>slash carb cycling.</p>
<p>So carbohydrate loading does help.</p>
<p>However, a misconception there is it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you know, a big bowl of pasta the night before.</p>
<p>That can help top off storages,</p>
<p>but really optimal carbohydrate loading</p>
<p>prior to a long duration endurance performance</p>
<p>is probably best over the course of three or four days.</p>
<p>So you want to gradually increase carbohydrate intake</p>
<p>for multiple days,</p>
<p>rather than just have one big bowl of pasta.</p>
<p>Branch chain amino acids</p>
<p>and essential amino acid supplementation.</p>
<p>Yay, nay, or as I would say, meh.</p>
<p>Meh, usually.</p>
<p>If your total protein intake is fine,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t really have a need for them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, for whatever, any number of valid reasons,</p>
<p>total protein is not,</p>
<p>then going to an essential amino acid</p>
<p>would be my first step rather than a BCAA.</p>
<p>Now, admittedly, we actually do use</p>
<p>essential amino acids somewhat regularly</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also sort of like a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no real harm other than if you&rsquo;re price conscious</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sort of like, I&rsquo;m wasting money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>The people I work with generally, again,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a few dollars to maximize,</p>
<p>recovery is not that big.</p>
<p>So we will sometimes use that pre, mid or post training</p>
<p>in some circumstances.</p>
<p>Total protein would be a high quality way,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t use whey for whatever reason,</p>
<p>there are plenty of high quality vegan proteins</p>
<p>you could use.</p>
<p>If you want to top all that off though</p>
<p>and add some essential amino acids,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt anything and may potentially help slightly.</p>
<p>So you choose based on that algorithm.</p>
<p>Ah, I was hoping somebody would ask this.</p>
<p>We touched on it a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of a loaded question</p>
<p>the way they phrased it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m at risk of leading the witness.</p>
<p>Does the mythical anabolic window really exist?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just laughing because the way they posed the question,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re already telling us what their stance is,</p>
<p>making it more effective as to create hypertrophy,</p>
<p>to eat within a certain timeframe after working out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to assume that this person genuinely wants to know</p>
<p>whether or not the anabolic window really exists or not</p>
<p>because they refer to it as mythical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna assume that they&rsquo;re suspicious,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s the deal?</p>
<p>Is the anabolic window a real thing?</p>
<p>The post-exercise anabolic window is extremely real.</p>
<p>So what this is, you can see more detail</p>
<p>in a number of videos on my YouTube page, I believe.</p>
<p>It is the idea that you need to, must consume</p>
<p>some sort of nutrients, specifically, usually protein</p>
<p>in some time domain, 30 or 60 minutes post-exercise</p>
<p>in order to maximize growth.</p>
<p>So is that window real?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are you hypersensitized to nutrients in that timeframe?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is it very important that you rehydrate,</p>
<p>replenish muscle glycogen and rebuild tissue quickly</p>
<p>after exercise to maximize recovery?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not real though, in the sense that you have to have it</p>
<p>within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>In the case of protein, as we talked about a second ago,</p>
<p>your total protein intake throughout the day</p>
<p>is more important.</p>
<p>Timing though, for things like carbohydrate,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re training multiple times a day,</p>
<p>it is very real.</p>
<p>So it is a very real thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you may or may not actually care about it.</p>
<p>It may not be important for your context.</p>
<p>Garlic seems like an appropriate question.</p>
<p>What, if any, functional roles</p>
<p>does garlic have in performance?</p>
<p>Garlic&rsquo;s actually really cool.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a number of things you can dive into</p>
<p>that are outside of my three to four sentences,</p>
<p>considering I&rsquo;m at like two and a half probably already.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna find strong human data on garlic extract.</p>
<p>However, there is a little bit suggesting</p>
<p>it can actually enhance recovery from injury</p>
<p>or potentially tissue damage.</p>
<p>So you gotta kind of be careful though,</p>
<p>because in order to understand what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>you have to differentiate between innate</p>
<p>and adaptive recovery processes.</p>
<p>And when we say things like immunity,</p>
<p>realize friends, that&rsquo;s not one thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like a very colloquial term</p>
<p>for a number of things.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s a verb.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a noun, right, the immune system,</p>
<p>but immunity is a bunch of processes or processes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re about to correct my speech,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll correct yours right back.</p>
<p>Not yours, Andy, but the listeners.</p>
<p>Tomato, tomato.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a verb.</p>
<p>Immunity is a verb.</p>
<p>This is my problem with immune boosters.</p>
<p>Same issue, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>What are you boosting specifically?</p>
<p>Because in fact, if you&rsquo;re boosting the wrong part</p>
<p>of immunity during the wrong phase of recovery with garlic,</p>
<p>you may be actually hurting the process</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re theoretically could be trying</p>
<p>to down-regulate that portions</p>
<p>that you can up-regulate the next portion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the faster way to say it, if you will.</p>
<p>So we actually, you may see more data come out</p>
<p>that says the garlic extract&rsquo;s overrated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t even know yet.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t have enough human data on it,</p>
<p>but yeah, there&rsquo;s some stuff there</p>
<p>if you want to look hard enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask this question for myself</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m curious to know the answer.</p>
<p>Selfish.</p>
<p>Tart cherry extract.</p>
<p>Pretty effective, actually, for two things,</p>
<p>potentially aiding in sleep, getting to sleep,</p>
<p>as well as muscle soreness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bulk of the research is in muscle soreness</p>
<p>and it seems to be a moderate effect there.</p>
<p>I think for people that might be interested</p>
<p>in dosages of things like tart cherry extract,</p>
<p>garlic, et cetera, obviously Dr. Andy Galpin&rsquo;s Instagram</p>
<p>and Twitter are great places to ask questions like that</p>
<p>and to find answers to questions like that,</p>
<p>as well as examine.com is a terrific website.</p>
<p>They actually recently overhauled their entire website</p>
<p>so they have this human effect matrix</p>
<p>that shows the effects and the strength of different effects</p>
<p>in human studies of many, many different compounds</p>
<p>relating to everything to hormone health in men and women,</p>
<p>sports performance, cognitive performance.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t cover everything,</p>
<p>but it certainly covers a lot with links to studies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that&rsquo;s available at completely zero cost</p>
<p>by joining examine.com,</p>
<p>you can access some additional features</p>
<p>and this is by the way,</p>
<p>not a paid endorsement from examine.com.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simply a long time user of examine.com myself.</p>
<p>And so I just want to cue people to it.</p>
<p>And again, many of the resources there</p>
<p>are available completely free of cost.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful site.</p>
<p>So for dosages of garlic, tart cherry extract</p>
<p>and things of that sort,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re getting it from food</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re getting it from extract powders rather,</p>
<p>all of that information is pretty nicely laid out there.</p>
<p>So unless you have something to add to that,</p>
<p>I was just going to cue people to that resource.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve been using that</p>
<p>since the first day that website was launched.</p>
<p>I was made aware that it was coming,</p>
<p>been fortunate to know those guys for a while.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;ve used it.</p>
<p>I use it in all my classes.</p>
<p>I use it, I don&rsquo;t even know, probably weekly at this point.</p>
<p>Another nice feature that&rsquo;s actually on there</p>
<p>is they have a series of,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ll do some topical reviews basically.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll write a big paper out on muscle damage</p>
<p>or blood pressure.</p>
<p>Or testosterone, testosterone enhancement</p>
<p>or hormone menstrual cycle and.</p>
<p>Yeah, PCOS, I think they do one on and all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>So you can search by topic,</p>
<p>like energy or recovery or whatever.</p>
<p>Or you can search by black cumin seed extract</p>
<p>or like whatever number of things you want to do.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll also tell you if there&rsquo;s any interactions</p>
<p>to pay attention to.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really, really nice.</p>
<p>So be careful if you&rsquo;re taking A and B or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s wonderful, wonderful.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;ve done a marvelous job.</p>
<p>So thank you, examine.com, keep up the amazing work.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve come close to the end of this episode.</p>
<p>And that means that we&rsquo;re close to the end of this series</p>
<p>where you have so graciously joined us</p>
<p>for six full episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>to educate us on all things fitness.</p>
<p>Episode one, you reviewed and educated us</p>
<p>on assessing our level of fitness.</p>
<p>In fact, I learned so many ways of assessing fitness</p>
<p>that I had not thought about</p>
<p>and also assessing my recovery capacity, for instance.</p>
<p>One thing that I&rsquo;m definitely going to implement</p>
<p>from that episode is a routine broad jump test</p>
<p>and an in-home high jump, jump and touch test.</p>
<p>If people don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m referring to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all contained in that episode, it&rsquo;s timestamped.</p>
<p>These are very straightforward,</p>
<p>zero cost ways to assess one&rsquo;s level of fitness.</p>
<p>There are a few others that require</p>
<p>a bare minimum of technology, like taking your pulse rate</p>
<p>in very specific ways at specific times.</p>
<p>Also some timing of mile runs and some other things</p>
<p>related to strength and hypertrophy and on and on.</p>
<p>Really, it&rsquo;s a buffet of options that we can select from.</p>
<p>And I already know the four or five</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve started implementing this week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recognized how I&rsquo;m pretty good in a couple of areas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing maybe, maybe better than pretty well in one area,</p>
<p>but that I&rsquo;m doing abysmally poorly in a few areas</p>
<p>that I just wasn&rsquo;t aware of.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve already started taking on ways</p>
<p>to adjust that over time and I&rsquo;ll keep people posted.</p>
<p>So that first episode was absolutely incredible</p>
<p>and just provides so much actionable knowledge</p>
<p>and the rationale behind it.</p>
<p>The second episode, you educated us about strength,</p>
<p>speed and hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>And there too, an immense amount of incredible knowledge.</p>
<p>We got way down into the details.</p>
<p>You explained sets, reps, the rationale for sets, reps,</p>
<p>rest, cadence, number of workouts per week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely gonna take away my need</p>
<p>to do some speed-based training and some power-based training</p>
<p>normally I think in terms of strength or hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m relieved to learn that a lot of the speed</p>
<p>and power-based training, it&rsquo;s low intensity enough</p>
<p>that it can be done fairly often and incorporated</p>
<p>into my program, which already touches on strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy and indeed some endurance work as well.</p>
<p>So amazing tips that you provided there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly going to implement the three to five program</p>
<p>that you described, three to five exercises</p>
<p>done for three to five repetitions,</p>
<p>three to five minutes between sets.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing this three to five times per week</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>All the details, again, time-stamped</p>
<p>in the strength and hypertrophy episode show notes.</p>
<p>So just incredible.</p>
<p>We even use that to set up PR with you this week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, I did PR this week.</p>
<p>Thanks to your input and following that program.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really grateful for that.</p>
<p>It does feel good to break through a barrier.</p>
<p>And I intend to break through more barriers,</p>
<p>but not just with strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>because episode three, you taught us all about endurance,</p>
<p>the four different forms of endurance,</p>
<p>how to train for each of those different forms,</p>
<p>the value of doing even very brief 20 second sprints</p>
<p>or bouts of jumping jacks throughout the day,</p>
<p>which to some people might just sound like a, you know,</p>
<p>like a little hack or a gimmick,</p>
<p>but no, these are actually tapping into fuel systems</p>
<p>and modes of neuromuscular interactions</p>
<p>that greatly aid other forms of endurance</p>
<p>like long duration endurance.</p>
<p>I would love to return to my high school mile time.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t reveal what that is</p>
<p>because this is not really about me,</p>
<p>but I plan to start doing, if not mile repeats,</p>
<p>then doing some mile runs and testing there once a week.</p>
<p>You laid out a beautiful program for how to do that.</p>
<p>And then in the next episode,</p>
<p>you wowed us again with a description of the science</p>
<p>and the tools and this right down to the details,</p>
<p>but all laid out very cleanly and clearly</p>
<p>as to how to design an optimal fitness program.</p>
<p>What are the things that really represent</p>
<p>an optimal program?</p>
<p>What questions does one have to answer</p>
<p>before designing a program?</p>
<p>What are some of the barriers in the way,</p>
<p>this concept of defenders</p>
<p>as things that prevent you from reaching your goals?</p>
<p>And one of the key things,</p>
<p>I have it right here in front of me</p>
<p>that I took away from that episode</p>
<p>was this quadrant approach of really thinking about</p>
<p>and figuring out how much one intends to devote</p>
<p>to work career calling.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make that one bin.</p>
<p>Relationships, another bin.</p>
<p>Fitness in the other bin and recovery in the other bin.</p>
<p>And here we&rsquo;ll tip our hat to our good friend, Kenny Kane</p>
<p>for mentioning that overall scheme for doing this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been immensely useful</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve actually charted it out and thought about</p>
<p>and drawn out which different things</p>
<p>fall into each of these categories.</p>
<p>You might think it&rsquo;s obvious, okay, relationships,</p>
<p>but that includes a lot of different things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s crossover between these bins</p>
<p>in terms of how you can combine enhancing relationships</p>
<p>with fitness, work, recovery, and so on.</p>
<p>So that episode is just, again,</p>
<p>a treasure trove of knowledge.</p>
<p>And then in the next episode,</p>
<p>you educated us on recovery in all its forms</p>
<p>in the very short term within the workout,</p>
<p>immediately after the workout and from workout to workout,</p>
<p>ways to really accelerate recovery, assess recovery.</p>
<p>And as you pointed out, for people like me</p>
<p>who always assume that we don&rsquo;t recover very well</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s some sort of character trait</p>
<p>or nervous system thing or genetic,</p>
<p>to really think about how my training</p>
<p>is impacting my level of recovery.</p>
<p>And in doing so has revealed to me</p>
<p>that I have far more capacity than I thought I had.</p>
<p>And already this week, I&rsquo;ve managed to train more often,</p>
<p>doing more work, and I feel better than ever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also despite the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve spent a fair amount of time</p>
<p>in these chairs across from one another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind way to say it.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been a pleasure.</p>
<p>And then in today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you explained nutrition and supplementation</p>
<p>as it relates to performance.</p>
<p>And of course that touches into recovery,</p>
<p>but also optimal mental states for training,</p>
<p>how to approach one&rsquo;s training</p>
<p>and how to extract the most from training</p>
<p>through quality nutrition, right?</p>
<p>So what to eat and when,</p>
<p>which carbohydrates, protein amounts,</p>
<p>windows of opportunity,</p>
<p>windows you absolutely don&rsquo;t want to miss,</p>
<p>and then some that are a bit more flexible.</p>
<p>And then we went deep into the weeds of magnesium,</p>
<p>garlic, tart cherry extract, alpha GPC.</p>
<p>We touched on neurotransmitter related systems,</p>
<p>hormone related systems.</p>
<p>We went deep into a discussion about sleep</p>
<p>because of course sleep is the foundation</p>
<p>for recovery and performance of all kinds,</p>
<p>emotional, mental, and physical recovery and performance.</p>
<p>And in taking us through this enormous arc</p>
<p>of a journey through fitness,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that you&rsquo;ve given us</p>
<p>your knowledge contained in your head.</p>
<p>I was telling someone just the other day</p>
<p>that one of the things that I always lamented in science</p>
<p>is that I would encounter these incredible professors</p>
<p>and scientists and in other domains of life too.</p>
<p>And you just wish there was some way to download their brain</p>
<p>because they had so much knowledge inside them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking for a USB or USB-C port on you,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t see one yet,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;ve effectively done for us</p>
<p>across these six episodes</p>
<p>is to download the actionable knowledge.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>The information you&rsquo;ve provided is clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly, highly actionable.</p>
<p>And in many cases it&rsquo;s counterintuitive and surprising,</p>
<p>but once one understands the logic behind it,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve provided for us also,</p>
<p>then it all makes sense in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extremely satisfying and extremely motivating.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s certainly motivating me to change the way</p>
<p>that I train in a number of ways.</p>
<p>And I promise that I&rsquo;ll report back to our audience</p>
<p>and to you as to what my results are,</p>
<p>but really, as we both agree, this is not about me.</p>
<p>This is not about you.</p>
<p>This is really about the people listening.</p>
<p>And so for those of you listening,</p>
<p>I hope you can appreciate what an incredible gift it is</p>
<p>to have somebody of Dr. Andy Galpin&rsquo;s experience</p>
<p>and drive and scholarly background,</p>
<p>who also works with athletes and everyday people,</p>
<p>just to splay out all this knowledge for us</p>
<p>systematically over six episodes.</p>
<p>Dr. Andy Galpin, thank you ever so much.</p>
<p>I appreciate that far too kind of words to me.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following along through this entire journey,</p>
<p>as you called it, you know,</p>
<p>I like first principles thinking and I like lists.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to get you with one more list</p>
<p>and I got five things on this final list.</p>
<p>Get your pen and pad out, please.</p>
<p>Number one, I want to really emphasize</p>
<p>science itself is a verb,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s ongoing and changing.</p>
<p>I did my best over the course of these many, many,</p>
<p>many hours to provide my interpretation of the science,</p>
<p>to provide my practical knowledge and things that I use,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s fallible.</p>
<p>Science changes.</p>
<p>There are many, many things in my career</p>
<p>that I was very sure that the evidence was clear on</p>
<p>and then it changed.</p>
<p>So as you move forward,</p>
<p>do not think of any of the recommendations I gave you,</p>
<p>whether they were about supplement dosages and timing,</p>
<p>rep ranges or breathing tactics, anything in between.</p>
<p>Just use them as guidelines.</p>
<p>So number one, science is a verb.</p>
<p>Number two, I really want to thank the audience.</p>
<p>This has been an extremely long haul.</p>
<p>As some of you have somehow I&rsquo;m sure,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not sure how,</p>
<p>but some of you have probably made it</p>
<p>through this entire journey and listened to all six episodes</p>
<p>and you should probably get some sort of</p>
<p>free Huberman Lab shirt or something or a plaque</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>How about a Galpin plaque?</p>
<p>Ah, Galpin plaque.</p>
<p>How about a internet high five?</p>
<p>And even if you just dropped in for a few of the episodes,</p>
<p>I appreciate you taking the time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things you could be doing with your time</p>
<p>and to spend those resources on, my words is touching.</p>
<p>Number three, I want to actually thank you, of course,</p>
<p>Andrew and the whole team and the crew up here</p>
<p>for three things.</p>
<p>Number one, I think it&rsquo;s incredibly important</p>
<p>that you have gone out of your way</p>
<p>to give other people credit for their work.</p>
<p>You go out of your way on your large platforms</p>
<p>and social media to tag people,</p>
<p>to give scientists credit for their work.</p>
<p>Most people do not do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t have to do.</p>
<p>And I think that as a culture,</p>
<p>you know, I know why you do it.</p>
<p>You come from science.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just what you do.</p>
<p>You give people credit for their work,</p>
<p>but you go out of your way to do that.</p>
<p>And so I want to thank you for that.</p>
<p>The next one is many people who have outlets and platforms</p>
<p>will try to fill those with people</p>
<p>who are going to grow their platforms.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean these people are wrong or bad,</p>
<p>but I think what&rsquo;s extremely special</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;ve created here is, again,</p>
<p>you have gone out of your way</p>
<p>to bring on the direct source of information.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine how many of your podcast guests</p>
<p>have never been on a podcast before</p>
<p>or have been on a very short number of them.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve made an extremely large platform</p>
<p>for doing nothing but talking about super deep dork science</p>
<p>directly from the scientists themselves.</p>
<p>And to create a community like that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy that science is made up here.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve shown the world.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t stupid.</p>
<p>People want detail and people want science</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve given it to them.</p>
<p>And the last one, of course,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see if I get through this,</p>
<p>is thank you for what you&rsquo;ve done for me in my career.</p>
<p>I understand there could have been</p>
<p>any number of people in this chair.</p>
<p>To put me on your platform once was incredibly gracious,</p>
<p>but to do it for 600 hours</p>
<p>or whatever we did in this series is,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for that opportunity.</p>
<p>So I hope I lived up to it and I had a tremendous time.</p>
<p>And then thank you for being such a gracious host.</p>
<p>Well, you more than exceeded expectations.</p>
<p>You are absolutely the person to be in this chair</p>
<p>talking about these topics with me and for the world.</p>
<p>And once again, I just want to say thank you</p>
<p>as a colleague, as a public educator,</p>
<p>as an exercise scientist, and as a friend.</p>
<p>If you have questions for us or comments or suggestions</p>
<p>about topics you&rsquo;d like us to cover</p>
