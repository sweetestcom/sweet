    <p>Hello, dear listener. I&rsquo;m Megan, host of this series. And before we get into the show,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a minute to tell you about our sponsor, FIRE, the Foundation for Individual</p>
<p>Rights and Expression. We live in a moment when free speech, the bedrock of our democracy</p>
<p>and of all free societies, is often viewed as suspect, where many argue that the right</p>
<p>to free speech is too dangerous, and that even listening to ideological opponents is</p>
<p>morally wrong. Many people just don&rsquo;t see a problem with using the law, corporate power,</p>
<p>and even extraordinary social pressure to censor viewpoints they disagree with. But</p>
<p>many of us feel the costs of all this in our everyday lives. We feel it when we self-censor,</p>
<p>afraid to say what we really think, sometimes even in private conversations with friends</p>
<p>or loved ones. We feel it when we opt out of a growing number of public discussions,</p>
<p>afraid of the potential cost to our jobs and even our relationships. FIRE shares a mission</p>
<p>with this show, to remind us why a culture of free speech and open dialogue matters.</p>
<p>And regardless of how loud the calls for censorship are, FIRE&rsquo;s defense of that culture is unshakable</p>
<p>and invaluable. And if you want to remember why we choose freedom, even for people we</p>
<p>strenuously disagree with, you can learn more about FIRE&rsquo;s incredible work at thefire.org.</p>
<p>And now, on to the show.</p>
<p>How universal is the idea of the witch?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a pan-cultural concept. It begins in the ancient world when, in fact, witches</p>
<p>were often men.</p>
<p>This is Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Stacey Schiff, author of The Witches, Salem</p>
<ol start="1692">
<li>She says that witches are mentioned in several ancient scriptures, and that the</li>
</ol>
<p>first documented witch trial took place in ancient Greece. And from there, it spread</p>
<p>throughout the world. Stacey says there were witch hunts across Europe, largely in Germany</p>
<p>and France. There were witch hunts in Switzerland, Russia, Turkey, Sweden. It would be difficult</p>
<p>to say who were the greatest of witch hunters. There have been witch hunts by Protestants,</p>
<p>Catholics, Jews, Muslims, animists. There does seem to be something sort of archetypally</p>
<p>general about this doer of supernatural deeds, somehow bound up with many religious constructs.</p>
<p>In all of these different societies, across time, all over the world, that engaged in</p>
<p>this sort of behavior, is there anything you can point to that they all have in common?</p>
<p>Or like, is there a set of circumstances or underlying characteristics about a society</p>
<p>that make it more likely to succumb to a witch trial frenzy?</p>
<p>I think we tend to see that kind of fear when there&rsquo;s political dislocation of some kind.</p>
<p>So much of witchcraft is about assigning blame and discharging one&rsquo;s anxiety. And</p>
<p>political dislocation will make people feel that they are on edge and insecure, and therefore</p>
<p>more likely to point fingers.</p>
<p>Chapter 2. Burn the Witch</p>
<p>On New Year&rsquo;s Eve 1990, J.K. Rowling learned that her mother, just 45 years old, had died</p>
<p>after suffering for years from MS. She moved away, then suffered a miscarriage, and became</p>
<p>trapped in an abusive marriage. She escaped, but found herself penniless and sank into</p>
<p>a deep depression. And yet, by the end of that decade, she had become a mother and eventually</p>
<p>reached a level of success that no author had ever known. But what did that decade look</p>
<p>like to the people who would become her censors, to those who would accuse her of being dangerous</p>
<p>to children, and would lead to Harry Potter becoming one of the most banned books of the</p>
<p>21st century? Who were they? And what did all of this have to do with the 1990s?</p>
<p>For me and many others who grew up with Harry Potter, it&rsquo;s easy for us to remember the</p>
<p>90s for what was seemingly so great about them. It was a time when poverty was going</p>
<p>down and the economy was booming. We were awash in new technologies that many thought</p>
<p>could unite the world. It seemed like nearly everybody was watching the same movies and</p>
<p>cheering for the same stars. The 90s are remembered by many as a time when politics</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t everywhere all the time, and where real social progress was made, especially</p>
<p>around gay rights. Ellen DeGeneres comes out on network television, Rent is the biggest</p>
<p>musical on Broadway, Will &amp; Grace becomes a primetime hit, and President Clinton issues</p>
<p>a declaration naming June Gay and Lesbian Pride Month. Modernity is bursting out all</p>
<p>over and the biggest problem we&rsquo;ve got is the primitive age-old fear and hatred and</p>
<p>dehumanization of the other people who aren&rsquo;t like us. After several cities in Colorado</p>
<p>passed local laws protecting gays from discrimination, state voters in 1992 passed Constitutional</p>
<p>Amendment 2, wiping those laws off the books and forbidding legal protection for homosexuals.</p>
<p>But of course, things weren&rsquo;t really so unified, or as rosy as some remember. It is not something</p>
<p>that American society should condone and affirm in front of our children or in front of our</p>
<p>society in general. After Ellen came out on TV, there was a backlash where people tried</p>
<p>to get her show canceled, and ultimately, it led ABC to put a parental advisory trigger</p>
<p>warning at the start of each episode. There was a movement of people who believed passionately</p>
<p>that there was a dangerous progressive agenda forcing gay rights on the country. We need</p>
<p>to stop the homosexual agenda, which is going to take over our town, our schools, everything,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t put a stop to it. And if that sounds familiar, that&rsquo;s because so much of</p>
<p>the language and the passion around the most divisive social issues still alive today have</p>
<p>deep roots in the surprisingly similar political tensions of the 1990s.</p>
<p>There were the L.A. riots, where a video of white cops beating a black man ignited unrest</p>
<p>that eventually led to the deaths of 63 people, more than twice the number who died during</p>
<p>the riots in the summer of 2020. I feel that there is an undercurrent of racism and that</p>
<p>the system is rotten to the core. And it was one of the only other times in history that</p>
<p>America impeached a president. Today, drawn and bleary-eyed, Mr. Clinton joined the battle</p>
<p>to save his presidency. And it was a president who many saw as deeply immoral. But I want</p>
<p>to say one thing to the American people. I did not have sexual relations with that</p>
<p>woman.</p>
<p>Much of the youth culture that thrived in the 90s was intentionally transgressive. Provocatively</p>
<p>violent music, like gangsta rap, went mainstream. There was the anti-conformity of grunge. And</p>
<p>eventually the boom of a goth subculture.</p>
<p>They wear white makeup, dress up in black, and look like the living dead. But they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not real life vampires stalking the night. They&rsquo;re just part of the gothic movement.</p>
<p>Which some saw as just kids playing around with identity and being rebellious, as kids</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>This is Dan and his 18-year-old daughter, Sunny. She&rsquo;s been dressing and looking like</p>
<p>this since she was 12. She has pierced her ear, her own eyebrow, and plans to pierce</p>
<p>her lip, nose, and tongue.</p>
<p>But others worried was actually glorifying death.</p>
<p>I find society to be really bleak right now. I&rsquo;d rather be dead than conformed with it.</p>
<p>The very foundations of our society are in danger of being burned. The flames of hedonism,</p>
<p>the flames of narcissism, the flames of self-centered morality are licking at the very foundations</p>
<p>of our society.</p>
<p>There was a growing concern among many adults back then, just as there is today, that the</p>
<p>cultural forces influencing young people were leading them to be depressed, anxious, and</p>
<p>antisocial. And in response to this, they saw a subset of the country saying that what</p>
<p>these young people needed was medical intervention.</p>
<p>Ritalin is being increasingly prescribed for hyperactive and disruptive children.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Prozac hit the market in a whirlwind of publicity and praise. Today,</p>
<p>more than three and a half million patients worldwide are treated with Prozac.</p>
<p>Which sparked a national debate about whether to trust big pharmaceutical companies and</p>
<p>the doctors who were telling parents that their kids needed these drugs.</p>
<p>Why are the drug companies marketing so feverishly to children now? Because it&rsquo;s not just the</p>
<p>children&rsquo;s market. It&rsquo;s a lifetime patient.</p>
<p>The 90s saw the increasing influence of a disruptive form of media, the 24-hour news</p>
<p>cycle.</p>
<p>Show the people on the bridges, Jeff.</p>
<p>Reporters on camera, in real time, speculating about what&rsquo;s happening on the ground.</p>
<p>The siege began Sunday morning when ATF agents went to the French Davidian compound near</p>
<p>Waco to arrest cult leader David Koresh.</p>
<p>And what they were often capturing‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Cult leader David Koresh apparently remains holed up in his heavily armed fortress and</p>
<p>we assume that negotiations‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Were sensational and frightening tragedies, many of them involving the death of children.</p>
<p>At least seven bodies were in the compound. Victims from Sunday&rsquo;s shootout. Federal</p>
<p>agents have confirmed there are more dead inside the compound.</p>
<p>In the siege at Waco, Texas, 76 people were killed, including 25 children.</p>
<p>A massive car bomb exploded outside of a large federal building in downtown Oklahoma City,</p>
<p>killing children, killing federal employees, military men‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people, including 19 children.</p>
<p>Bombing in Oklahoma City was an attack on innocent children and defenseless citizens.</p>
<p>And then, most notoriously, there was Columbine.</p>
<p>Jefferson County, 911.</p>
<p>Yes, I am a teacher at Columbine High School. There is a student here with a gun.</p>
<p>I want a table, kids. Hands under the table.</p>
<p>Columbine wasn&rsquo;t the first school shooting, but largely because it was televised, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>seen as the school shooting that brought the issue front and center in America&rsquo;s consciousness,</p>
<p>where it has remained ever since.</p>
<p>People were getting shot all around me.</p>
<p>There was a guy at a table right next to us, next to me and her, and they just shot him</p>
<p>and then walked away and then he was just sitting there in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>35 students were shot, 14 of them died, and their bodies were brought out of the school</p>
<p>on live television.</p>
<p>Amid the gunshots and bomb blasts, hundreds of students ran for their lives.</p>
<p>The two killers belonged to a group of students that named itself the Trenchcoat Mafia, and</p>
<p>we are beginning to learn more about these teenagers.</p>
<p>And the massive coverage from the 24-hour news cycle?</p>
<p>The suspects were reportedly into the music of goth rocker Marilyn Manson, who has described</p>
<p>himself as a satanic priest and an outsider.</p>
<p>Quickly formed a narrative, even before an investigation could be done.</p>
<p>Several school districts in the Denver area are banning students from wearing goth-like</p>
<p>trenchcoats, and kids told us that police are rounding up some gothic teens.</p>
<p>This young man&rsquo;s friend was brought in for questioning.</p>
<p>One of my friends gets arrested off the street for wearing a black trenchcoat, walking down</p>
<p>the street for doing nothing wrong.</p>
<p>The speculation fueled fears about the influence of youth culture.</p>
<p>It even came out that the two killers were on antidepressants.</p>
<p>If Marilyn Manson can walk into our town and promote hate, violence, suicide, death, drug</p>
<p>use, and Columbine-like behavior, I can say, not without a fight, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We now know, and it&rsquo;s worth mentioning, that much of that story told by the media in the</p>
<p>aftermath of the shooting was wrong.</p>
<p>The two killers were not part of a goth gang.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t big fans of Marilyn Manson.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t bullied by jocks.</p>
<p>And in fact, one of them had been an athlete himself.</p>
<p>But the story that was told resonated so deeply with the larger fears and anxieties of the</p>
<p>90s that it stuck.</p>
<p>When the Columbine school shooting happened, it served as confirmation.</p>
<p>This is Jared Stacey, who was a teenager back in the 90s, growing up in a community that,</p>
<p>more than almost any other, feared the changes they were seeing in American society‚Äîevangelical,</p>
<p>fundamentalist Christians.</p>
<p>One of the features of the fundamentalism that I grew up in was this constant assumption</p>
<p>of persecution.</p>
<p>Many versions of Christian fundamentalism had thrived in America throughout the 20th</p>
<p>century.</p>
<p>So much so that by the start of the 1990s, Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority</p>
<p>Movement, had declared,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;our goal has been achieved.</p>
<p>The religious right is solidly in place, and religious conservatives in America are</p>
<p>now in for the duration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But by the end of the decade and the Columbine massacre in 1999, many Christians were changing</p>
<p>how they saw themselves and their standing in the culture.</p>
<p>The world was going to get worse, and that persecution for Christians would come.</p>
<p>And Columbine was huge.</p>
<p>The way that Columbine was presented to us was that it was perpetrated by young men who</p>
<p>were antagonistic towards Christians.</p>
<p>Well, they knew her, and they knew that she was a Christian, and they created a target</p>
<p>list.</p>
<p>There were certain things that those boys wanted to accomplish.</p>
<p>In addition to the reports about the Columbine killers being in a goth gang, many Christians</p>
<p>heard an additional story.</p>
<p>Schools across America were told that some students at Columbine had specifically been</p>
<p>targeted for their faith.</p>
<p>The killers allegedly walked up to these students, asked if they were Christians, and when the</p>
<p>answer was yes, they executed them.</p>
<p>When that young man asked Cassie if she believed in God, she boldly said yes.</p>
<p>One of these stories turned into the best-selling book, She Said Yes.</p>
<p>We looked at each other and we said,</p>
<p>Would I have done that?</p>
<p>I might have begged for my life.</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>She may have been 17, but she&rsquo;s probably a better woman than I will ever be.</p>
<p>Interviews with the victims&rsquo; parents were passed around churches and youth groups.</p>
<p>This confirms and justifies the paranoia that we have that we are under attack.</p>
<p>Now just like the broader media story surrounding Columbine, She Said Yes and these stories</p>
<p>of martyrs also turned out to be unfounded.</p>
<p>But at the time, it helped inspire this belief among evangelical Christians, who already</p>
<p>felt like the culture was turning against them, that now they were in real physical</p>
<p>danger.</p>
<p>As we approach the 21st century, it doesn&rsquo;t take a rocket scientist to recognize that</p>
<p>our entire culture is in trouble.</p>
<p>Columbine in some ways kind of proved that it was possible that you could walk out of</p>
<p>your house and have a gun to your head and be asked, Are you a Christian or not?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re staring down the barrel of a loaded gun and we can no longer afford to act like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s loaded with blanks.</p>
<p>There was Columbine, and I remember Harry Potter.</p>
<p>One of the bullets in this gun is the bullet of fantasy, which is just dominating our culture.</p>
<p>Just dominating.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s a sign of nihilism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sign of abandoning everything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a moral freefall.</p>
<p>When your children can be taught witchcraft by Harry Potter, that Heather has two mummies,</p>
<p>you can let your daughter go to school and she can get an abortion without your permission</p>
<p>or without your knowledge.</p>
<p>Something is dreadfully wrong when you as the parent cannot control the destiny of your</p>
<p>own child.</p>
<p>America has turned its back on the God of the Bible, and it&rsquo;s time for the church of</p>
<p>Jesus Christ to stand up and speak up and say, we have a right to the destiny of our own children.</p>
<p>I think my publishers were definitely on the alert for trouble.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>

<p>I am a person who can be pretty obsessive about my health.</p>
<p>My routine typically includes things like 10,000 steps a day and smoothies and strength</p>
<p>workouts.</p>
<p>And yes, I am even one of those people who forces myself to take cold showers, even in</p>
<p>the winter.</p>
<p>But a lot of that flew out the window when I had a baby six months ago, and I especially</p>
<p>struggled to make sure that I was getting good nutrition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was so excited to add AG1 from Athletic Greens to my routine.</p>
<p>I love that I can get 75 vitamins, minerals, and nutrients from whole food sources just</p>
<p>by adding a scoop of AG1 to my smoothie in the morning, or mixing it with a glass of</p>
<p>cold water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really simple habit to get into, and it&rsquo;s so much easier than swallowing</p>
<p>a bunch of pills, which is what I did for years and came to completely dread.</p>
<p>AG1 is different, and it makes me feel grateful that even during the most chaotic times in</p>
<p>my life, I can do this small, powerful thing to help me cover my nutritional bases every</p>
<p>day.</p>

<p>Under the category of children&rsquo;s fantasy literature, sales of Harry Potter books have received</p>
<p>phenomenal acceptance worldwide, breaking all records in children&rsquo;s literature.</p>
<p>Through Harry Potter books and audios, children as young as kindergarten age are being introduced</p>
<p>to human sacrifice, the sucking of blood from dead animals, and possession by spirit beings.</p>
<p>The question is, should parents be concerned that the alluring power behind witchcraft</p>
<p>is being made to look innocent and is being targeted towards their children through the</p>
<p>Harry Potter phenomenon?</p>
<p>In the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, in what has become a largely forgotten chapter</p>
<p>in the Harry Potter legacy, a passionate and motivated group of American Christians</p>
<p>did everything they could to stop the popularity and ubiquity of Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Witchcraft is sin.</p>
<p>Right next to drunkenness, drugs, homosexuality, adultery&hellip;</p>
<p>At first, it was just a fringe.</p>
<p>Do you remember when you first understood that people were calling your writing dangerous?</p>
<p>So I think it was in about 1999 that I first became aware that, yeah, the books were being banned.</p>
<p>Author J.K. Rowling.</p>
<p>That there was a vocal pushback against these books as dangerous and immoral.</p>
<p>But quickly, the movement spread to the airwaves of Christian radio.</p>
<p>God hates this. I mean, he really hates it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s darkness, and he is light. It is evil.</p>
<p>Wicked, you know, extreme words were being used that I was harming children,</p>
<p>that these books were poison for children&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>Then, to popular Christian televangelists like John Hagee.</p>
<p>When you reject the truth, all that&rsquo;s left is a lie.</p>
<p>When you reject love, all that&rsquo;s left is hate.</p>
<p>When you read books about witchcraft, throw Harry Potter in that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re opening the gates of your mind to the prince of darkness, and he will invade.</p>
<p>And once he gets invited in, he doesn&rsquo;t go out until he&rsquo;s cast out.</p>
<p>And the backlash, it kept growing.</p>
<p>As we crossed over into the year 2000,</p>
<p>suddenly everything seemed to just supersize itself.</p>
<p>Everything, from my point of view, became a bit more crazy.</p>
<p>I was signing for like 2,000 people.</p>
<p>I was signing for like a million people.</p>
<p>I was signing for a million people.</p>
<p>I was signing for a million people.</p>
<p>I was signing for a million people.</p>
<p>It was all crazy.</p>
<p>I was signing for like 2,000 people at a time.</p>
<p>And we had a bomb threat at one store,</p>
<p>allegedly from a far-right Christian person.</p>
<p>Although no bomb was ever found on the premises,</p>
<p>it was enough to frighten Rowling and her team,</p>
<p>especially because it was around this time that the fight against Harry Potter</p>
<p>was ramping up at school board meetings across America.</p>
<p>The book&rsquo;s U.S. publisher is the highly respected Scholastic Books,</p>
<p>which encourages teachers to read the books out loud to their students.</p>
<p>Parent Elizabeth Mounts objects</p>
<p>because she finds the books dark and disturbing.</p>
<p>There were book ban battles at school board meetings in Virginia, Texas,</p>
<p>New Mexico, California, Arkansas.</p>
<p>Our child came home, it was being read in his class,</p>
<p>and the concern we had with these books was the violent tones in here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s evil, there&rsquo;s death, there&rsquo;s lack of respect for human life,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the occult.</p>
<p>And then there was James Dobson,</p>
<p>the head of the most influential Christian organization in the country,</p>
<p>Focus on the Family.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t introduce your kids to a meaningful relationship with Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>then you will never see your kids again in the afterlife.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, this is job one for parents.</p>
<p>He joined the calls to boycott Potter,</p>
<p>which led to even more American parents forbidding their kids to read the books.</p>
<p>The Harry Potter books are mainstreaming witchcraft to our children.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re presenting it in a child-friendly format that&rsquo;s dangerous and deceptive.</p>
<p>By the early 2000s, this group of Christians,</p>
<p>even though they felt they were persecuted</p>
<p>and increasingly saw themselves as culturally marginalized,</p>
<p>we now know, thanks to a memoir by White House speechwriter Matt Latimer,</p>
<p>that people who opposed Rowling&rsquo;s work were in the White House.</p>
<p>We believe that the Almighty hears our prayers</p>
<p>and answers those who seek him.</p>
<p>According to Latimer,</p>
<p>members of George W. Bush&rsquo;s own administration</p>
<p>objected to giving J.K. Rowling the Presidential Medal of Freedom</p>
<p>because the books encouraged witchcraft.</p>
<p>And Rowling?</p>
<p>She says she wasn&rsquo;t exactly surprised by the backlash.</p>
<p>The experience in America was, not for the first time,</p>
<p>very different from the experience in the U.K.</p>
<p>I remember speaking to my American editor about it,</p>
<p>and he was pretty robust about it.</p>
<p>You know, he felt, it&rsquo;s not true, these are very moral books.</p>
<p>I remember saying to him, this was inevitable.</p>
<p>And by that I meant, it&rsquo;s got too big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just got too big.</p>
<p>You know, there are plenty of other books about witches and wizards out there.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of the pushback was the sheer scale of it.</p>
<p>People were alarmed by the scale of it.</p>
<p>To start, can you tell me your name and whatever title you&rsquo;d like us to use?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>My name is David Hogue, D-A-V-I-D H-O-G-U-E.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trained to do that in court, sorry.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a lawyer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been practicing since 1994, I think.</p>
<p>And when the Harry Potter case came up in Cedarville, Arkansas,</p>
<p>actually I reached out to the school district and offered my assistance.</p>
<p>David Hogue is a Christian parent and lawyer.</p>
<p>He represented an Arkansas school district in a Harry Potter book ban case in 2002</p>
<p>that set precedent for many school libraries still today.</p>
<p>Basically what happened in Cedarville was the librarian,</p>
<p>she got the books and put them in the library for kids to get and read</p>
<p>because it was popular then and it did get,</p>
<p>I mean kids were reading 300-page books, which was crazy.</p>
<p>So she put them in the library and then I think it was Angie Haney</p>
<p>who was the parent who found out about that</p>
<p>and wanted them taken out of the library altogether</p>
<p>or at least just put behind the desk so parents would have to approve.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it all started.</p>
<p>So does the hubbub over Harry Potter seem outlandish</p>
<p>or do parents have a real argument here?</p>
<p>There was people on both sides at the school board meetings.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just fantasy. It&rsquo;s a book, it&rsquo;s not reality,</p>
<p>and I think children can make the difference.</p>
<p>They can draw the line.</p>
<p>Some parents were saying these books are good for the kids</p>
<p>because it promotes literacy and some parents were saying</p>
<p>this is horrible for the kids because it promotes witchcraft.</p>
<p>The thing that we found, my wife and I found objectionable,</p>
<p>was it was being read aloud to our son in his class</p>
<p>and in this post-Columbine era that we&rsquo;re living in,</p>
<p>we felt like with kids living out their fantasies,</p>
<p>this book may have potential for that.</p>
<p>To say the least, it was tense.</p>
<p>And how urgent was this for them?</p>
<p>Oh, it was ridiculously urgent because the books were everywhere</p>
<p>and they were written for kids.</p>
<p>And a lot of parents were afraid that a child will read, you know,</p>
<p>a couple of the first pages and get hooked in and, you know,</p>
<p>hide it under their bed and keep reading</p>
<p>and be sucked into something they shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>This is from book one.</p>
<p>See what I have become, the face said, mere shadow and vapor.</p>
<p>I have form only when I can share another&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks.</p>
<p>Yikes, unicorn blood?</p>
<p>When was the first time you heard of Harry Potter?</p>
<p>Do you remember?</p>
<p>Honestly, the first time I heard of Harry Potter</p>
<p>was when the books first started coming out.</p>
<p>At first, when people would tell me, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these Harry Potter books and it&rsquo;s about a kid that&rsquo;s a witch</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of naturally in him that he&rsquo;s a witch</p>
<p>and then he learns the skills of a witch and so forth</p>
<p>and he goes to a witch school or a witch or wizardry school.</p>
<p>At first, I took it seriously like a lot of people do</p>
<p>because based on my own Baptist Christian raising</p>
<p>and my study of witchcraft and sorcery and demonology and so forth.</p>
<p>David actually told me that in college he&rsquo;d taken classes</p>
<p>trying to better understand things like exorcism</p>
<p>and some of the older practices in the Christian faith.</p>
<p>And I found some things that matched</p>
<p>sort of the real-life stuff that I&rsquo;d read about.</p>
<p>So Christianity, in its essence,</p>
<p>is a religion based on unearned grace and sacrifice.</p>
<p>The foundational claim of many Christians</p>
<p>is that God created all people and loved them so much</p>
<p>that he sent his own son to rescue them,</p>
<p>both from their own evil nature</p>
<p>and from all the darkness, pain, and injustice</p>
<p>that fills this world and makes life so hard.</p>
<p>In spite of our rebellion, in spite of our disobedience,</p>
<p>in spite of our sins, God loves us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thrilling thing about it.</p>
<p>And God loves every person in the whole world.</p>
<p>And in turn, Christians are commanded to love all people</p>
<p>and to fight against that darkness and injustice.</p>
<p>But many fundamentalists believe</p>
<p>that the same Bible that teaches them to love</p>
<p>also teaches them to take an active role</p>
<p>in shaping the morality of the broader culture</p>
<p>by challenging what they see as antithetical to Christian morals.</p>
<p>That Bible demands that they engage</p>
<p>in a cosmic war between good and evil</p>
<p>and that they must be on guard constantly</p>
<p>because evil is lurking everywhere.</p>
<p>We should love the things that God loves</p>
<p>and hate the things that God hates.</p>
<p>God hates divination, sorcery, and witchcraft,</p>
<p>and we should too.</p>
<p>And witchcraft is a part of that evil.</p>
<p>Witchcraft teaches that there&rsquo;s only one power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neutral.</p>
<p>The Bible says there&rsquo;s two powers,</p>
<p>the power of God and the power of the devil,</p>
<p>and this verse says that we are in a battle</p>
<p>between these two powers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an intense battle, and it&rsquo;s going on right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another verse in Revelation 9 I want to share with you.</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen specific references</p>
<p>to the evils of witchcraft in the Bible,</p>
<p>and one of the clearest is found in Leviticus.</p>
<p>A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit,</p>
<p>or that is a witch,</p>
<p>shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p>They shall stone them with stones.</p>
<p>Their blood shall be upon them.</p>
<p>Or in Exodus, the simple,</p>
<p>Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</p>
<p>But there are also many other verses</p>
<p>that warn about the evils of things associated with witchcraft,</p>
<p>like divination,</p>
<p>the seeking of unknown or future things</p>
<p>by supernatural forces.</p>
<p>And J.K. Rowling made divination</p>
<p>one of the classes in the fictional wizard school</p>
<p>that Harry attends.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 18 says,</p>
<p>Anyone who practices divination</p>
<p>or tells fortunes or interprets omens</p>
<p>or a sorcerer or a charmer or a Harry,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, or a medium or a necromancer</p>
<p>or one who inquires of the dead.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty big list.</p>
<p>And the central fear of these Christians</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t really that their kids are going to start predicting the future</p>
<p>or casting spells.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that these evil forces</p>
<p>will literally harm their children.</p>
<p>I believe that some of that is real,</p>
<p>and it concerned me that some of the things in Harry Potter,</p>
<p>which were put in a fiction book,</p>
<p>were actually taken from reality.</p>
<p>Like divination?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In my opinion, at first,</p>
<p>having not read the books,</p>
<p>it touched it a little bit too realistically,</p>
<p>and it touched it a little bit too much for my taste.</p>
<p>And maybe it sounds absurd</p>
<p>to be talking about witchcraft invading kids&rsquo; minds</p>
<p>in modern America.</p>
<p>But actually, it was something talked about,</p>
<p>not just in Christian circles,</p>
<p>but in the culture more broadly,</p>
<p>even on mainstream news.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know the exact numbers,</p>
<p>but Wicca is believed to be one of the fastest-growing religions</p>
<p>among high school and college students.</p>
<p>This form of witchcraft,</p>
<p>with its reverence for the earth and nature,</p>
<p>appeals to young environmentalists,</p>
<p>and Wicca&rsquo;s emphasis on a goddess as well as a god</p>
<p>draws young girls.</p>
<p>This is audio from an NPR news feature</p>
<p>that aired on All Things Considered</p>
<p>in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an increasing willingness to say,</p>
<p>well, what I believe is true,</p>
<p>but I believe that other individuals</p>
<p>have access to the truth as well.</p>
<p>In fact, I think I can have my beliefs</p>
<p>and add on to them</p>
<p>some beliefs of my neighbor.</p>
<p>And that, in part, explains the wild popularity</p>
<p>of Wicca, or witchcraft, among young people.</p>
<p>Wicca, with its mystical ceremonies,</p>
<p>its goddess worship,</p>
<p>its reverence for nature,</p>
<p>offers no specific doctrine.</p>
<p>Followers can stitch together</p>
<p>a personal religion with, say,</p>
<p>Native American prayer and Hindu meditation.</p>
<p>What counts is that it&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p>The reporter even discusses the connection</p>
<p>between pop culture and teenage interest in witchcraft.</p>
<p>She began noticing the surge in teen interest</p>
<p>with the release of a certain film in 1996,</p>
<p>when witchcraft became young and glamorous.</p>
<p>The Craft, a little-known movie among adults,</p>
<p>was a hit among teenage girls</p>
<p>and changed the way they thought about witches.</p>
<p>And even though that connection</p>
<p>is depicted as harmless in the story,</p>
<p>it was exactly what many Christians</p>
<p>advocating for boycotts were afraid of.</p>
<p>Hollywood is glorifying witchcraft.</p>
<p>Whether on TV&hellip;</p>
<p>One of the biggest ones here is</p>
<p>Sabrina the Teenage Witch.</p>
<p>Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</p>
<p>Charmed series.</p>
<p>Or in the movies.</p>
<p>Practical magic.</p>
<p>The Witches of Eastwick.</p>
<p>The Craft.</p>
<p>These programs and these movies</p>
<p>have been watched by kids and young adults</p>
<p>and adults over and over and over and over again.</p>
<p>And of course, then,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably the biggest of them all,</p>
<p>and that is Harry Potter.</p>
<p>It got to the point where Rowling, in interviews,</p>
<p>felt the need to say clearly</p>
<p>that she didn&rsquo;t actually believe in magic.</p>
<p>There are two groups of people</p>
<p>who think I am wholeheartedly with them.</p>
<p>One are people who believe passionately</p>
<p>in the boarding school system,</p>
<p>and the other group are practicing witches.</p>
<p>I have to say I&rsquo;m not on either of their sides.</p>
<p>That she wasn&rsquo;t trying to spread witchcraft at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in magic in that sense.</p>
<p>But some, like Christian film producer Carol Matriciana,</p>
<p>pushed back, essentially saying,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say.</p>
<p>We can see that you do, in fact, support witchcraft.</p>
<p>Many have argued that Joanne Rowling</p>
<p>is not teaching the children witchcraft</p>
<p>and the books are not about witchcraft.</p>
<p>The lie about this is this is a true representation</p>
<p>of witchcraft and the black arts and black magic.</p>
<p>Christian televangelist John Hagee</p>
<p>even wondered if she was a secret Nazi.</p>
<p>Even Harry Potter&rsquo;s forehead is marked</p>
<p>with the lightning bolt of the Hitler SS.</p>
<p>And so the calls for book bans continued.</p>
<p>The school board initially put the books</p>
<p>behind the librarian&rsquo;s desk</p>
<p>and required a parent&rsquo;s permission slip</p>
<p>for any child to check out those books</p>
<p>or even just to get them and read them in the library.</p>
<p>Again, attorney David Hogue,</p>
<p>who represented the Cedarville school board.</p>
<p>The school board said,</p>
<p>kind of it&rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to expose the kids to things</p>
<p>that the parents are vehemently opposed to</p>
<p>and the parents say are dangerous for the kids.</p>
<p>And so they thought that the best compromise position</p>
<p>would be, okay, the books are still available,</p>
<p>but you have to have parental permission</p>
<p>to get through the books.</p>
<p>PHONE RINGS</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Brian.</p>
<p>This call is being recorded.</p>
<p>Hi, Brian. Thank you so much for talking with me.</p>
<p>Hi. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>And this is Brian Meadows.</p>
<p>My name is Brian Meadows.</p>
<p>I used to be a trial lawyer in Arkansas,</p>
<p>and a large part of my practice</p>
<p>was handling the civil rights cases.</p>
<p>He was the attorney arguing on behalf of the parents</p>
<p>who wanted Potter to be freely available</p>
<p>in Cedarville school libraries.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s retired now,</p>
<p>but agreed to take my call from his home in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<p>Can you tell me what your side in this case was arguing?</p>
<p>My clients had a First Amendment right</p>
<p>to access information,</p>
<p>and this case focused on the issue</p>
<p>of how much control, if any,</p>
<p>a school board can exercise</p>
<p>on the content that is already in the school library.</p>
<p>Can they restrict certain viewpoints</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t personally like them</p>
<p>or they find that it goes against their religion?</p>
<p>Or is a school library an open forum</p>
<p>and age-appropriate material can be freely distributed?</p>
<p>We believe that it was the latter.</p>
<p>The school library is an open forum.</p>
<p>It is there for intellectually curious children,</p>
<p>and material that is already in the library</p>
<p>that is age-appropriate should be freely available</p>
<p>without any restriction based on the material&rsquo;s viewpoint.</p>
<p>And ultimately, Bryan&rsquo;s side won the case.</p>
<p>The court agreed with us</p>
<p>because we have very good precedent on our side.</p>
<p>The three school board members,</p>
<p>they all admitted under oath</p>
<p>that the reason they restricted those books</p>
<p>was because they didn&rsquo;t agree with the religious viewpoint.</p>
<p>They deemed the books to be inconsistent</p>
<p>with their version of Christianity,</p>
<p>and therefore they thought they were doing the right thing</p>
<p>by removing them or restricting access to the books.</p>
<p>Nobody was able to cite any kind of disruption</p>
<p>that the books caused.</p>
<p>At that point, that&rsquo;s a pretty solid case.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how David Hogue explains it.</p>
<p>The judge at that time ruled in favor of Bryan&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>that the right to freedom of information</p>
<p>would in this case overrule the right to parents</p>
<p>having a say in their children&rsquo;s education.</p>
<p>Even a minor child has that right to freedom of information</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t be abridged by the school</p>
<p>and the parents&rsquo; concerns about what may be in that information.</p>
<p>So ultimately, do you think the courts were right in how they ruled,</p>
<p>even though it meant that you lost the case?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Some cases need to be lost.</p>
<p>One strange thing about this story is that,</p>
<p>in talking to David,</p>
<p>I learned that he had completely changed his mind</p>
<p>about this case that he&rsquo;d argued so strongly long ago.</p>
<p>If Christians get all caught up in banning books</p>
<p>that we think are dangerous for our kids,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re legally opening the door to non-Christians</p>
<p>banning books for their kids that we think are good for their kids.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I wanted to talk to Bryan and David</p>
<p>is because of the many recent book bans</p>
<p>taking place across America right now.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t love freedom and ban books!</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t love freedom and ban books!</p>
<p>We want to turn now to the sharp rise in book bans</p>
<p>in America&rsquo;s schools and libraries.</p>
<p>A recent study found hundreds of books</p>
<p>mostly focused on LGBTQ themes or racial issues</p>
<p>have now been forbidden across the country.</p>
<p>Banning books over their subject matter.</p>
<p>The Hillsdale Library Board is looking at purging the shelves</p>
<p>of LGBTQ topics.</p>
<p>And how these Harry Potter book ban cases from years ago</p>
<p>are still having an effect on our culture today.</p>
<p>The battle is over these five books with LGBTQ themes.</p>
<p>These books on lifestyle choices are destructive and wrong.</p>
<p>Would you say that these cases involving Harry Potter-related</p>
<p>book bans and restrictions are now the kind of precedent</p>
<p>that is protecting LGBTQ books in public libraries?</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>The part of the legacy of Harry Potter</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s going to protect a lot of the LGBTQ books.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Things like this are going to always happen.</p>
<p>And they always have in American history.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be some group</p>
<p>that considers itself aggrieved.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to try to shut down viewpoints that they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>I think a good example of this might be Huckleberry Fenn.</p>
<p>Huckleberry Fenn has been attacked at different times</p>
<p>from both the right and the left.</p>
<p>Decades ago, the right attacked it</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t approve of the race mixing in the book.</p>
<p>And now, left-wing groups attack it</p>
<p>because they believe that it portrays African Americans</p>
<p>in a disfavorable light.</p>
<p>These things are always happening.</p>
<p>They become like dandelions in your yard.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can ever really get rid of them,</p>
<p>but you can just try to reduce the number.</p>
<p>What did you think of David Hogue,</p>
<p>who argued the case on the other side?</p>
<p>I like David Hogue.</p>
<p>David Hogue is one of many opposing counsel</p>
<p>who later became a friend of mine.</p>
<p>At that time in our lives,</p>
<p>David and I saw the world very differently.</p>
<p>But I liked him, and I respect him.</p>
<p>And David Hogue, for his part,</p>
<p>eventually read the Harry Potter series in its entirety</p>
<p>and changed his mind about it, too.</p>
<p>They are good books.</p>
<p>I think they do get a bit dark,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t see harm in those books.</p>
<p>And if you have contact with J.K. Rowling,</p>
<p>please thank her for the joy that those books are.</p>
<p>So looking back, would you say that the Christian parents</p>
<p>were maybe part of a moral panic,</p>
<p>specifically around those books?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scary world out there,</p>
<p>and I remember back then</p>
<p>that it seemed like the world was just getting to be</p>
<p>a more and more scary place.</p>
<p>Once you start seeing, you know, the 24-hour news cycle,</p>
<p>you know, CNN break off this direction</p>
<p>and Fox News break off this direction,</p>
<p>the Internet was just coming in,</p>
<p>and I think people were starting to have a little bit of fear</p>
<p>of what all was out there.</p>
<p>When you would see these people, you know, burning your books,</p>
<p>literally burning them and trying to get them banned</p>
<p>and removed from schools and libraries,</p>
<p>how did you understand what was going on inside of them?</p>
<p>Well, I think that this is something I explore</p>
<p>in the Potter books.</p>
<p>A sense of righteousness is not incompatible</p>
<p>with doing terrible things.</p>
<p>You know, most of the people in movements</p>
<p>that we consider hugely abhorrent,</p>
<p>many, many, many of the people involved in those movements</p>
<p>understood themselves to be on the side of righteousness,</p>
<p>believed they were doing the right thing,</p>
<p>felt themselves justified in what they were doing.</p>
<p>I suppose, for me, book burners by definition</p>
<p>book burners by definition, predictably,</p>
<p>to me have placed themselves across a line,</p>
<p>across a line of rational debate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simply going to destroy the idea that I don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>I will destroy the idea.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t destroy it, so I will destroy its representation.</p>
<p>I will burn this book.</p>
<p>There is no book on this planet that I would burn, no book,</p>
<p>including books that I do think are damaging.</p>
<p>Burning, to me, is the last resort of people who cannot argue.</p>
<p>One theme that really jumps out right at the start of the books</p>
<p>is how people like Harry&rsquo;s aunt and uncle</p>
<p>keep saying to him, don&rsquo;t ask questions.</p>
<p>And I just wonder, like, what&rsquo;s the significance of having</p>
<p>this whole seven-book journey start with that theme?</p>
<p>Well, there you are, you see.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just returned immediately to the book burners.</p>
<p>They are completely certain that they are doing the right thing,</p>
<p>and that justifies cruelty, unmerited punishment,</p>
<p>telling him he&rsquo;s things he&rsquo;s not, you know, he&rsquo;s bad, he&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>and hiding information.</p>
<p>And the don&rsquo;t ask questions and the burning of the letters,</p>
<p>there you are, you have it right at the start.</p>
<p>You are not allowed to look beyond what we say is normal,</p>
<p>what we say is the world.</p>
<p>There are plenty of stories, you know, especially children&rsquo;s stories,</p>
<p>where the heroes are the heroes and the villains are the villains,</p>
<p>and the only real question in the stories</p>
<p>is whether the heroes can defeat the villains.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the Harry Potter story at all.</p>
<p>You know, the heroes are flawed.</p>
<p>Some people we think of as villains turn out to be the ones who save the day.</p>
<p>And, you know, so many characters that we, at first glance,</p>
<p>think are bad or scary are actually just misunderstood.</p>
<p>And one of the early themes of the books is that</p>
<p>if you want to figure out the truth, you shouldn&rsquo;t jump to conclusions,</p>
<p>that your prejudices can betray you,</p>
<p>and that your first judgment might not be accurate.</p>
<p>You know, you really seem to have this deep awareness</p>
<p>of this type of human behavior that, you know,</p>
<p>the temptation to fall into this, like, very simplistic</p>
<p>black and white kind of morality.</p>
<p>But there is also a clear presence in the books</p>
<p>of the reality that there is such a thing as good</p>
<p>and there is such a thing as evil.</p>
<p>And even though it&rsquo;s not always easy to tell,</p>
<p>you ultimately have to, right?</p>
<p>How do you discern when a behavior falls on one side of that line or the other?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s such a deep question, and it goes to the heart of Potter,</p>
<p>and it goes to the heart of much of my worldview.</p>
<p>The irredeemably evil character in Potter has dehumanized himself.</p>
<p>So Voldemort has consciously and deliberately made himself less than human.</p>
<p>And we see the natural conclusion of what he&rsquo;s done to himself</p>
<p>through very powerful magic.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s left with is something less than human,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s done that deliberately.</p>
<p>He sees humane behavior as weakness.</p>
<p>He has reduced himself to something that cannot feel</p>
<p>the full range of human emotion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge appeal, and I try to show this in the Potter books,</p>
<p>to black and white thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the easiest place to be, and in many ways, it&rsquo;s the safest place to be.</p>
<p>If you take an all-or-nothing position on anything,</p>
<p>you will definitely find comrades.</p>
<p>You will easily find a community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sworn allegiance to this one simple idea.</p>
<p>What I try to show in the Potter books, and what I feel very strongly myself,</p>
<p>we should mistrust ourselves most when we are certain,</p>
<p>and we should question ourselves most when we receive a rush of adrenaline</p>
<p>by doing or saying something.</p>
<p>Many people mistake that rush of adrenaline for the voice of conscience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to rush from saying that. I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>In my worldview, conscience speaks in a very small and inconvenient voice,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s normally saying to you, think again, look more deeply, consider this.</p>
<p>And I was struck early on, actually, in the Potter phenomenon,</p>
<p>by how the two characters that caused the most furious debate,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m actually using the word furious quite literally there at times,</p>
<p>were Dumbledore and Snape.</p>
<p>People wanted Dumbledore to be perfect. He&rsquo;s deeply flawed.</p>
<p>But he is, to me, he is an exemplar of goodness.</p>
<p>He did wrong. He learnt. He grew wise.</p>
<p>But he has to make the difficult decisions that people in the real world have to make.</p>
<p>Very difficult decisions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you have Snape, incontrovertibly a bully.</p>
<p>He can be mean. He can be sadistic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s bitter, but he is courageous.</p>
<p>He is determined to make good what he did terribly wrong.</p>
<p>And without him, disaster would have occurred.</p>
<p>And I have had fans really angry at me for not categorising Snape in particular,</p>
<p>just wanting clarity and simplicity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just agree this is a really bad guy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking, well, I can&rsquo;t agree with you, because I know him.</p>
<p>But also I can&rsquo;t agree with you full stop, because people can be deeply flawed.</p>
<p>People can make mistakes. People can do bad things.</p>
<p>In fact, show me the human being who hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And they can also be capable of greatness.</p>
<p>And I mean greatness in a moral sense, not in a fame or an achievement sense.</p>
<p>So let me talk about the infamous book burning video for a second.</p>
<p>I am not just offended by what J.K. Rowling says.</p>
<p>I am fearful because of what she is promoting on her platform.</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling is literally putting trans lives at further risk.</p>
<p>She just is. It&rsquo;s disgusting and it&rsquo;s problematic.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s face it, Hermione would punch this woman in the face right now.</p>
<p>Harry Potter franchise is literally making this world unsafe for kids today.</p>
<p>Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut it down!</p>
<p>Shut it down! Shut it down!</p>
