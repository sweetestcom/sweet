Berg here in this video we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about the parathyroid gland now what are the parathyroid glands okay there&amp;rsquo;s four of them now if we take a look at the Adam&amp;rsquo;s apple which is right up here on the top of the trachea right below it is the thyroid so the thyroid is located about two-and-a-half inches at the bottom of your neck okay the parent thyroid are behind the thyroid gland okay they&amp;rsquo;re in the back part and they control calcium in fact the name of the hormone that controls calcium is the parathyroid hormone okay pretty simple right so what does it do if this is such a tight control for calcium in the blood like it always wants to maintain a constant stable calcium it will do anything to keep that level there so it&amp;rsquo;ll increase in decrease based on the level of calcium in the blood it&amp;rsquo;s like a thermostat if you set it at 72 your your thermostat is constantly turning off and on off and on all day and all night right same thing with the parathyroid or the calcium in the blood okay so it just maintains a very tight control because we need calcium for the main for a lot of things one is the main communication between nerves you need calcium okay so now when this hormone increases it increases calcium in the blood all right so it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s raising calcium your blood now where does it get it from if it gets it from the bone so it&amp;rsquo;ll literally rob the bone of calcium to keep normal levels of calcium in the blood now it also the parathyroid hormone also activates vitamin D in other words vitamin D in your body is usually inactive and it has to be converted to the active form of vitamin D the parathyroid hormone activates the enzyme to do that why because it&amp;rsquo;s another control of calcium so it will actually increase the conversion based on what&amp;rsquo;s happening to the calcium levels and then it will increase it by increasing more vitamin D because vitamin D actually helps you or calcium by 20 times in the intestines raising the calcium in the blood now what is the problem of too much calcium in the blood is the big problem so sometimes these little glands can enlarge and turn into tumors okay if that happens this hormone starts increasing more and more and more and that means you&amp;rsquo;re going to be robbing more calcium from the bone and that&amp;rsquo;s one of the causes of osteopenia that&amp;rsquo;s a lower thinning of the bones it&amp;rsquo;s a mild version of osteoporosis and then you get osteoporosis which is a major demineralization of the bone and then you can get fractures bone pain and another condition called hypercalcemia which basically means too much calcium in the blood okay the problem with too much calcium in the blood is that you can get high blood pressure you ever heard of a calcium channel blocker that&amp;rsquo;s the medication that blocks calcium well why do you think they use that for blood pressure right atrial fib palpitations kidney stones you get kidney stones for having a tumor on your parathyroid so if they keep coming back tiredness why because the calcium is not working within the brain and the nervous system and everything starts slowing down that&amp;rsquo;s why you have memory loss concentration problems and you can even have GERD that&amp;rsquo;s a digestive issue that means the valve on the top of stomach is not closing correctly so the parathyroid is very important in controlling calcium okay you can also have hypo calcium iya or you can have low amounts of the hormones and there&amp;rsquo;s a whole series of other symptoms that you can get but if you look this up the the tumor on the parathyroid gland they say well we don&amp;rsquo;t know what causes that okay so we just remove it okay so it&amp;rsquo;s but it&amp;rsquo;s still the success rate is pretty high even if you remove it because you have four of them and sometimes they you can go tumors on multiple glands but what I did is I got out my trusty toxicology book right this is an amazing book that you can get a lot of information from and I turn to the chapter on the parathyroid okay I wanted to see if there&amp;rsquo;s any problem we research being done in that area and has tumors of the parathyroid one is aluminum one is a chemical I can&amp;rsquo;t even pronounce ozone and the influence of xenobiotic chemicals what&amp;rsquo;s a xenobiotic chemical those are foreign chemicals pesticides herbicides fungicides"><link rel="shortcut

Berg here in this video we&rsquo;re going 
to talk about the parathyroid gland now what are  </p><p>the parathyroid glands okay there&rsquo;s four of them 
now if we take a look at the Adam&rsquo;s apple which  </p><p>is right up here on the top of the trachea right 
below it is the thyroid so the thyroid is located  </p><p>about two-and-a-half inches at the bottom of 
your neck okay the parent thyroid are behind  </p><p>the thyroid gland okay they&rsquo;re in the back part 
and they control calcium in fact the name of the  </p><p>hormone that controls calcium is the parathyroid 
hormone okay pretty simple right so what does it  </p><p>do if this is such a tight control for calcium 
in the blood like it always wants to maintain  </p><p>a constant stable calcium it will do anything 
to keep that level there so it&rsquo;ll increase in  </p><p>decrease based on the level of calcium in 
the blood it&rsquo;s like a thermostat if you set  </p><p>it at 72 your your thermostat is constantly 
turning off and on off and on all day and all  </p><p>night right same thing with the parathyroid 
or the calcium in the blood okay so it just  </p><p>maintains a very tight control because we need 
calcium for the main for a lot of things one is  </p><p>the main communication between nerves you need 
calcium okay so now when this hormone increases  </p><p>it increases calcium in the blood all right so 
it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s raising calcium your blood now where  </p><p>does it get it from if it gets it from the bone 
so it&rsquo;ll literally rob the bone of calcium to  </p><p>keep normal levels of calcium in the blood now 
it also the parathyroid hormone also activates </p><p>vitamin D in other words vitamin D in your body is 
usually inactive and it has to be converted to the  </p><p>active form of vitamin D the parathyroid hormone 
activates the enzyme to do that why because it&rsquo;s  </p><p>another control of calcium so it will actually 
increase the conversion based on what&rsquo;s happening  </p><p>to the calcium levels and then it will increase 
it by increasing more vitamin D because vitamin  </p><p>D actually helps you or calcium by 20 times in 
the intestines raising the calcium in the blood  </p><p>now what is the problem of too much calcium in the 
blood is the big problem so sometimes these little  </p><p>glands can enlarge and turn into tumors okay if 
that happens this hormone starts increasing more  </p><p>and more and more and that means you&rsquo;re going 
to be robbing more calcium from the bone and  </p><p>that&rsquo;s one of the causes of osteopenia that&rsquo;s a 
lower thinning of the bones it&rsquo;s a mild version  </p><p>of osteoporosis and then you get osteoporosis 
which is a major demineralization of the bone  </p><p>and then you can get fractures bone pain and 
another condition called hypercalcemia which  </p><p>basically means too much calcium in the blood 
okay the problem with too much calcium in the  </p><p>blood is that you can get high blood pressure you 
ever heard of a calcium channel blocker that&rsquo;s the  </p><p>medication that blocks calcium well why do 
you think they use that for blood pressure  </p><p>right atrial fib palpitations kidney stones you 
get kidney stones for having a tumor on your  </p><p>parathyroid so if they keep coming back tiredness 
why because the calcium is not working within the  </p><p>brain and the nervous system and everything 
starts slowing down that&rsquo;s why you have memory  </p><p>loss concentration problems and you can even 
have GERD that&rsquo;s a digestive issue that means  </p><p>the valve on the top of stomach is not closing 
correctly so the parathyroid is very important  </p><p>in controlling calcium okay you can also have 
hypo calcium iya or you can have low amounts of  </p><p>the hormones and there&rsquo;s a whole series of other 
symptoms that you can get but if you look this up  </p><p>the the tumor on the parathyroid gland they say 
well we don&rsquo;t know what causes that okay so we  </p><p>just remove it okay so it&rsquo;s but it&rsquo;s still the 
success rate is pretty high even if you remove  </p><p>it because you have four of them and sometimes 
they you can go tumors on multiple glands but  </p><p>what I did is I got out my trusty toxicology 
book right this is an amazing book that you can  </p><p>get a lot of information from and I turn to the 
chapter on the parathyroid okay I wanted to see  </p><p>if there&rsquo;s any problem we research being done 
in that area and has tumors of the parathyroid  </p><p>one is aluminum one is a chemical I can&rsquo;t even 
pronounce ozone and the influence of xenobiotic  </p><p>chemicals what&rsquo;s a xenobiotic chemical those are 
foreign chemicals pesticides herbicides fungicides</p><p>so that&rsquo;s really what causes tumors the same 
tumors that are in other parts of the body are  </p><p>which are triggered by chemicals also affect 
this as well so I don&rsquo;t know why they don&rsquo;t  </p><p>make the connection with these chemicals so 
this is just another reason why you need to  </p><p>continue to consume cruciferous and other 
vegetables simply because thank goodness  </p><p>Nature has left a remedy for all the chemicals 
that we are exposed to you see so many people  </p><p>just ending up with these weird diseases and 
dreamers on the parathyroid for no reason well  </p><p>that&rsquo;s the reason because we&rsquo;re constantly 
exposed to that so anyway I wanted to just  </p><p>kind of give you the basics on the parathyroid 
and put your comments below thanks for watching</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
