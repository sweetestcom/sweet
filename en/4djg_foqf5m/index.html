start over here at the bad fats soy corn canola cotton seed all gmo okay the processing of these oils they use a solvent called hexane sometimes which is kind of toxic not to mention there could be traces of glyphosate which is an herbicide but these are severely heated and they&amp;rsquo;re in a lot of foods that we eat they&amp;rsquo;re definitely in some common foods like mayonnaise okay so if you just go to the grocery store and you start reading labels you&amp;rsquo;re going to see this one number one or this one right here mayonnaise salad dressing is another big one right here and even hummus right they don&amp;rsquo;t even make it with olive oil anymore they have to put these other oils in there so you just need to start reading labels so these are inflammatory stay away from them of course margarine that&amp;rsquo;s a given has trans fats crisco for example was on the market for 97 years it might still be on the mark but as far as trans fats go several years ago i think it was in 2015 the fda finally put a ban on it but then they gave these companies three years to phase out of these trans fats and so at this point i don&amp;rsquo;t even know who complied who didn&amp;rsquo;t comply but the fact that trans fats the most deadly fats in our food supply has been on the market for 97 years is just insane i mean before the trans fats we had things like tallow and lard lard is pig fat and tallow is beef fat or lamb fat and of course ingrained into our mine you know these are poison and this is the health food remember the commercial they talked about it&amp;rsquo;s not nice to fool mother nature i don&amp;rsquo;t even understand what that means because they are fooling mother nature with margarine the other place that so many people are getting these oils into their body which by the way are loaded with omega-6 fatty acids and it&amp;rsquo;s just it&amp;rsquo;s just way way out of proportion because we want to balance the six with the omega-3 fatty acid is in fast food restaurants as well as other restaurants that are not fast food they put it in there in sauces they definitely use it to deep fry things and that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re getting you&amp;rsquo;re getting a lot of these oils let&amp;rsquo;s just shift over to these oils right here safflower oil sunflower oil flax oil sesame seed oil which then turns into this tahini butter and then certain nut oils like peanut oil macadamia nut oil these are okay for certain people in smaller amounts as long as they&amp;rsquo;re cold pressed organic would be preferable but if you have too much even safflower oil or sunflower oil it can be way too too much in omega-6 so i actually don&amp;rsquo;t even recommend it but in small amounts here and there it&amp;rsquo;s going to be okay flax soil is very estrogenic the only time i would recommend that is for females that are lacking estrogen and maybe they need a little boost over a short period of time but definitely not ferment and then we have sesame seed oil or tahini butter again small amounts make sure it&amp;rsquo;s cold pressed and you can get raw tahini butter which is actually better than them overly processed and then of course the nut oils again they&amp;rsquo;re omega-6 so small amounts here and there preferably organic so this is a no this is occasionally for certain people but let&amp;rsquo;s get to the good fats cod liver oil is one of the best oils to give you omega-3 fatty acids both dha which your brain needs and epa which your brain and nervous system need as well as your immune system not to mention vitamin d and vitamin a and then we have avocado oil that&amp;rsquo;s really good to put on your salad or you can even cook with it it does have vitamin e if you cook with it the heat is going to kill off vitamin e okay then we have lard which is considered something that&amp;rsquo;s going to clog your arteries of course certain cultures certain religions do not consume lard or anything connected with a pig other people when they think about pig or pig fat they&amp;rsquo;re thinking about processed pork uh factory farming i&amp;rsquo;m not talking about that i&amp;rsquo;m talking about getting something like wild boar fat which are pigs which are which are bores that have lived in the open forest in texas and you can get the fat from that it&amp;rsquo;s high in vitamin d3 so ideally you&amp;rsquo;d want organic pastured lard if you&amp;rsquo;re going to actually get that to cook with or use in certain recipes but if we were to compare this with this this is like synthetic plastic and this has been used for a very long time and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t create the oxidation that these type of fats do it&amp;rsquo;s very stable it&amp;rsquo;s good to cook with then you have kala which is beef fat i would recommend grass-fed you can get either bison beef or lamb it&amp;rsquo;s great to cook with there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of vitamins there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of nutrition and it won&amp;rsquo;t irritate your gut problems so either one of these is good for someone with an autoimmune disease that has a lot of inflammation in the gut camel fat okay which is some people never heard of that but yes camel camels have fat and you can actually buy that fat and you can cook with it and you can put it in various recipes it&amp;rsquo;s loaded with b12 it&amp;rsquo;s loaded with the active form of vitamin a it has good amounts of omega-3 fatty acid it has good amounts of cla which is a healthy type of fat that actually can stimulate your metabolism then we have butter okay grass-fed i would always recommend if you could find organic raw that would be the ideal situation but butter has vitamin k2 omega-3 fatty acids and cla organic ghee from grass-fed cows is also really good to cook with as well it&amp;rsquo;s clarified which means they get rid of all the solids so you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be exposing your body to any type of protein particles that you can have an allergy to or the lactose which is the milk sugar but for the most part you&amp;rsquo;re not going to see much of that in butter but for some people that are really sensitive they should do ghee and then of course we have olive oil one of my favorites always get the extra virgin and get it from a real quality source i order this from this version right here i love this version it&amp;rsquo;s from italy and it&amp;rsquo;s high quality the farm where they grow this takes great pride in making high quality olive oil and it&amp;rsquo;s just very very fresh it&amp;rsquo;s like way different than stuff you would get it you know in america at costco which i don&amp;rsquo;t even know if it&amp;rsquo;s legitimate but this is a seriously high quality product i&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down below if you want more information about it i don&amp;rsquo;t get any kickbacks but i like to recommend products that are high quality and then we have palm oil which is very controversial so the type of palm oil that i would recommend is the eco-friendly environmentally friendly palm oil that uses certain pharma that doesn&amp;rsquo;t destroy our planet the red palm has some pretty pretty high level of antioxidants as well as beta carotene and then we have coconut oil okay high in lauric acid it turns into ketones it&amp;rsquo;ll help ketosis and it&amp;rsquo;s really good to cook with and of course you&amp;rsquo;d want to get the coconut oil that&amp;rsquo;s also eco-friendly all right so there you go there&amp;rsquo;s a quick summary of the good and bad oils and these right here that kind of fit right in between hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today'>

<p>﻿all right let&rsquo;s talk about good fats and bad 
fats let&rsquo;s start over here at the bad fats soy  </p>
<p>corn canola cotton seed all gmo okay the 
processing of these oils they use a solvent  </p>
<p>called hexane sometimes which is kind of toxic 
not to mention there could be traces of glyphosate  </p>
<p>which is an herbicide but these are severely 
heated and they&rsquo;re in a lot of foods that we  </p>
<p>eat they&rsquo;re definitely in some common foods like 
mayonnaise okay so if you just go to the grocery  </p>
<p>store and you start reading labels you&rsquo;re going 
to see this one number one or this one right here  </p>
<p>mayonnaise salad dressing is another big one 
right here and even hummus right they don&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>even make it with olive oil anymore they 
have to put these other oils in there so  </p>
<p>you just need to start reading labels so these 
are inflammatory stay away from them of course  </p>
<p>margarine that&rsquo;s a given has trans fats 
crisco for example was on the market for  </p>
<p>97 years it might still be on the mark but as far 
as trans fats go several years ago i think it was  </p>
<p>in 2015 the fda finally put a ban on it but then 
they gave these companies three years to phase out  </p>
<p>of these trans fats and so at this point i don&rsquo;t 
even know who complied who didn&rsquo;t comply but the  </p>
<p>fact that trans fats the most deadly fats in our 
food supply has been on the market for 97 years  </p>
<p>is just insane i mean before the trans fats 
we had things like tallow and lard lard is  </p>
<p>pig fat and tallow is beef fat or lamb fat and of 
course ingrained into our mine you know these are  </p>
<p>poison and this is the health food remember the 
commercial they talked about it&rsquo;s not nice to fool  </p>
<p>mother nature i don&rsquo;t even understand what that 
means because they are fooling mother nature with  </p>
<p>margarine the other place that so many people are 
getting these oils into their body which by the  </p>
<p>way are loaded with omega-6 fatty acids and it&rsquo;s 
just it&rsquo;s just way way out of proportion because  </p>
<p>we want to balance the six with the omega-3 fatty 
acid is in fast food restaurants as well as other  </p>
<p>restaurants that are not fast food they put it 
in there in sauces they definitely use it to  </p>
<p>deep fry things and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re getting 
you&rsquo;re getting a lot of these oils let&rsquo;s just  </p>
<p>shift over to these oils right here safflower 
oil sunflower oil flax oil sesame seed oil which  </p>
<p>then turns into this tahini butter and then 
certain nut oils like peanut oil macadamia nut oil  </p>
<p>these are okay for certain people in smaller 
amounts as long as they&rsquo;re cold pressed  </p>
<p>organic would be preferable 
but if you have too much  </p>
<p>even safflower oil or sunflower oil it 
can be way too too much in omega-6 so  </p>
<p>i actually don&rsquo;t even recommend it but in small 
amounts here and there it&rsquo;s going to be okay  </p>
<p>flax soil is very estrogenic the only time i would 
recommend that is for females that are lacking  </p>
<p>estrogen and maybe they need a little boost over 
a short period of time but definitely not ferment  </p>
<p>and then we have sesame seed oil or tahini 
butter again small amounts make sure it&rsquo;s cold  </p>
<p>pressed and you can get raw tahini butter which 
is actually better than them overly processed and  </p>
<p>then of course the nut oils again they&rsquo;re omega-6 
so small amounts here and there preferably organic  </p>
<p>so this is a no this is occasionally for 
certain people but let&rsquo;s get to the good fats  </p>
<p>cod liver oil is one of the best oils to give 
you omega-3 fatty acids both dha which your brain  </p>
<p>needs and epa which your brain and nervous system 
need as well as your immune system not to mention  </p>
<p>vitamin d and vitamin a and then we have avocado 
oil that&rsquo;s really good to put on your salad or  </p>
<p>you can even cook with it it does have vitamin e 
if you cook with it the heat is going to kill off  </p>
<p>vitamin e okay then we have lard which 
is considered something that&rsquo;s going  </p>
<p>to clog your arteries of course certain 
cultures certain religions do not consume  </p>
<p>lard or anything connected with a pig other 
people when they think about pig or pig fat  </p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thinking about processed pork uh factory 
farming i&rsquo;m not talking about that i&rsquo;m talking  </p>
<p>about getting something like wild boar fat which 
are pigs which are which are bores that have  </p>
<p>lived in the open forest in texas and you can 
get the fat from that it&rsquo;s high in vitamin d3  </p>
<p>so ideally you&rsquo;d want organic pastured lard if 
you&rsquo;re going to actually get that to cook with or  </p>
<p>use in certain recipes but if we were to compare 
this with this this is like synthetic plastic  </p>
<p>and this has been used for a very long time and 
it doesn&rsquo;t create the oxidation that these type  </p>
<p>of fats do it&rsquo;s very stable it&rsquo;s good to cook 
with then you have kala which is beef fat i would  </p>
<p>recommend grass-fed you can get either bison beef 
or lamb it&rsquo;s great to cook with there&rsquo;s a lot of  </p>
<p>vitamins there&rsquo;s a lot of nutrition and it won&rsquo;t 
irritate your gut problems so either one of these  </p>
<p>is good for someone with an autoimmune disease 
that has a lot of inflammation in the gut camel  </p>
<p>fat okay which is some people never heard of that 
but yes camel camels have fat and you can actually  </p>
<p>buy that fat and you can cook with it and you can 
put it in various recipes it&rsquo;s loaded with b12  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s loaded with the active form of vitamin 
a it has good amounts of omega-3 fatty acid  </p>
<p>it has good amounts of cla which is a healthy 
type of fat that actually can stimulate your  </p>
<p>metabolism then we have butter okay grass-fed 
i would always recommend if you could find  </p>
<p>organic raw that would be the ideal situation 
but butter has vitamin k2 omega-3 fatty acids and  </p>
<p>cla organic ghee from grass-fed cows is 
also really good to cook with as well  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clarified which means they get rid of all 
the solids so you&rsquo;re not going to be exposing  </p>
<p>your body to any type of protein particles that 
you can have an allergy to or the lactose which  </p>
<p>is the milk sugar but for the most part you&rsquo;re 
not going to see much of that in butter but for  </p>
<p>some people that are really sensitive they 
should do ghee and then of course we have  </p>
<p>olive oil one of my favorites always get the 
extra virgin and get it from a real quality source  </p>
<p>i order this from this version right here i love 
this version it&rsquo;s from italy and it&rsquo;s high quality  </p>
<p>the farm where they grow this takes great 
pride in making high quality olive oil and  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just very very fresh it&rsquo;s like way different 
than stuff you would get it you know in america at  </p>
<p>costco which i don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s legitimate 
but this is a seriously high quality product i&rsquo;ll  </p>
<p>put a link down below if you want more information 
about it i don&rsquo;t get any kickbacks but i like to  </p>
<p>recommend products that are high quality and then 
we have palm oil which is very controversial so  </p>
<p>the type of palm oil that i would recommend is 
the eco-friendly environmentally friendly palm oil  </p>
<p>that uses certain pharma that doesn&rsquo;t destroy our 
planet the red palm has some pretty pretty high  </p>
<p>level of antioxidants as well as beta carotene and 
then we have coconut oil okay high in lauric acid  </p>
<p>it turns into ketones it&rsquo;ll help ketosis 
and it&rsquo;s really good to cook with and  </p>
<p>of course you&rsquo;d want to get the coconut oil 
that&rsquo;s also eco-friendly all right so there  </p>
<p>you go there&rsquo;s a quick summary of the good and 
bad oils and these right here that kind of fit  </p>
