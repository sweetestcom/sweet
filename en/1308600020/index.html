    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring you zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>This episode marks the beginning of a new topic</p>
<p>for the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>As many of you already know,</p>
<p>we go deep into a particular topic over four,</p>
<p>sometimes even five episodes.</p>
<p>We just closed out the episodes on hormones.</p>
<p>Now we are going to talk about</p>
<p>how to optimize physical performance and skill learning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to look deep at the science behind this,</p>
<p>as well as specific practices.</p>
<p>In fact, today, you&rsquo;re going to hear about specific tools</p>
<p>that you can use to improve endurance and strength</p>
<p>by up to, I&rsquo;m not making this up,</p>
<p>three or four times your current capacity.</p>
<p>This is based on studies that were done at Stanford</p>
<p>and are currently in use</p>
<p>by collegiate and professional teams.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not a professional athlete or a serious athlete,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>The topics this month</p>
<p>and all the information we are going to cover</p>
<p>are going to make you a better recreational exerciser</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not an exerciser</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking about getting into that,</p>
<p>or if you live in the Northern Hemisphere</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just thinking about the beach this summer,</p>
<p>fat loss, muscle building, that sort of thing,</p>
<p>this month, we&rsquo;re going to cover all of that as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much confusion out there</p>
<p>about how to optimize fat loss, muscle building,</p>
<p>improvements in flexibility, for instance,</p>
<p>or skill learning.</p>
<p>I know many of you aren&rsquo;t so focused</p>
<p>on the cosmetic aspects of physical exercise,</p>
<p>but are interested in actual skill learning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about that too.</p>
<p>I want to just take a moment</p>
<p>to reflect on something that came up last episode.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t see that episode, that&rsquo;s quite all right.</p>
<p>But last episode,</p>
<p>we were talking about the hormones adrenaline and cortisol</p>
<p>and how to leverage those towards attention and learning.</p>
<p>And there was a little bit of confusion</p>
<p>that I want to clarify.</p>
<p>I mentioned an optimal protocol for learning</p>
<p>that involved leveraging adrenaline,</p>
<p>also called epinephrine, and it involved four steps.</p>
<p>The four steps that I spelled out</p>
<p>were to be calm and focused</p>
<p>while one is trying to acquire or learn the new skill,</p>
<p>cognitive skill or motor skill,</p>
<p>then to have a spike in adrenaline.</p>
<p>I mentioned ways to do that,</p>
<p>using cold or breathing or other tools.</p>
<p>Immediately after the learning episode,</p>
<p>then to incorporate what I call non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>a 20 minute episode of a shallow nap</p>
<p>or some other protocol like NSDR,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest protocol,</p>
<p>of which we always provide links in the captions.</p>
<p>And then to try and optimize sleep later that night</p>
<p>and the subsequent night.</p>
<p>Some of you heard this and it sunk in right away</p>
<p>and it was straightforward.</p>
<p>Others said, wait,</p>
<p>I thought from a previous episode, even before that,</p>
<p>you said you&rsquo;re supposed to do non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>immediately after learning.</p>
<p>No, we added another step.</p>
<p>The logic still follows</p>
<p>that you want to be calm and focused during learning.</p>
<p>Then you want to spike adrenaline at the end.</p>
<p>Most people get that backward.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re drinking too much coffee</p>
<p>or even taking nootropics and things,</p>
<p>trying to be really focused while learning.</p>
<p>Some people are taking Adderall recreationally,</p>
<p>something I don&rsquo;t recommend.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually getting the whole process backwards</p>
<p>if you look at the data and the physiology.</p>
<p>You want to spike adrenaline at the end</p>
<p>or immediately after a learning episode</p>
<p>and then non-sleep deep rest and then sleep itself.</p>
<p>Okay, four steps.</p>
<p>Hope that clarifies things for you.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions,</p>
<p>please put them in the comment section below.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about physical performance.</p>
<p>There are so many variables to physical performance</p>
<p>and we can manage physical performance and skill learning</p>
<p>from a variety of contexts.</p>
<p>I made just a short list of some of the things</p>
<p>that come to mind that can powerfully impact</p>
<p>physical performance and skill learning.</p>
<p>Some of them are what I would consider foundational.</p>
<p>They allow you to show up with your current ability.</p>
<p>And if you were to disrupt those,</p>
<p>you would perform less well.</p>
<p>So things like getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>things like being properly hydrated,</p>
<p>things like being well-nourished,</p>
<p>whatever that means to you.</p>
<p>I know some of you like to exercise fasted.</p>
<p>Some of you prefer to have food in your stomach</p>
<p>or have eaten a couple hours before.</p>
<p>There are supplements, there are drugs,</p>
<p>there are different ways to breathe.</p>
<p>There are so many tools related to mindset,</p>
<p>visualization, there are machines and devices.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a vast space, but it&rsquo;s not infinite.</p>
<p>And there are a few things in the list of things</p>
<p>that can impact and even optimize physical performance</p>
<p>and skill learning that have an outsized effect</p>
<p>that any of you can use.</p>
<p>Many of them, most of them are low to zero cost.</p>
<p>So today we are going to focus on what I believe</p>
<p>to be one of the most powerful tools</p>
<p>to improve physical performance and skill learning</p>
<p>and recovery.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about why that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s temperature.</p>
<p>Many of you might think, oh, well, that&rsquo;s kind of boring.</p>
<p>I want to know about the magic pill that I can take</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to allow me a dunk of basketball</p>
<p>if I currently can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>or I want to know about the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to let me run further and faster</p>
<p>is going to shed fat.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, temperature is the most powerful variable</p>
<p>for improving physical performance and for recovery.</p>
<p>I would argue it&rsquo;s even more important than sleep</p>
<p>because temperature itself is going to dictate how well</p>
<p>and when you sleep and the depth of your total recovery.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to temperature, of course.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s heat and there&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>We are mainly going to focus on cold</p>
<p>as a way to buffer heat.</p>
<p>In a previous podcast episode,</p>
<p>I talked all about growth hormone.</p>
<p>You can find that episode about thyroid and growth hormone</p>
<p>and how heat can be a powerful stimulus</p>
<p>for increasing growth hormone,</p>
<p>which is involved in tissue repair and et cetera,</p>
<p>can burn fat and improve metabolism in various ways.</p>
<p>However, cold, I would argue,</p>
<p>is even more powerful than heat as a tool.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not just talking about putting ice packs</p>
<p>on sore muscles or slightly sprained limbs and ankles</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about cold</p>
<p>from the standpoint of thermal physiology.</p>
<p>This is a literature that&rsquo;s rich in scientific information</p>
<p>that goes back very deep into the last century</p>
<p>where physiologists and neuroscientists figured out</p>
<p>that there are different compartments in your body</p>
<p>that heat and cool you differently</p>
<p>and that you can leverage those</p>
<p>in order to double, and as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>even triple or quadruple your work output,</p>
<p>both strength, repetitions, and endurance.</p>
<p>So this is not weak sauce, as they say.</p>
<p>This is the stuff that can really shift the needle</p>
<p>quite a bit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just about performing well once,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about being able to perform well</p>
<p>and recover from that performance</p>
<p>so that you do even better</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not incorporating these tools.</p>
<p>On days where, for instance, you can&rsquo;t access cold</p>
<p>or an ice pack or an ice bath or things of that sort.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re going to cover cold.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk a little bit about</p>
<p>the physiology of cold and heat and how they work</p>
<p>because, as you&rsquo;ve probably heard me say before,</p>
<p>if you can understand some mechanism,</p>
<p>if you can just push yourself</p>
<p>through a little bit of new knowledge</p>
<p>into understanding a little bit of mechanism</p>
<p>about how you work,</p>
<p>you will be in a far better position</p>
<p>to implement the tools in the best</p>
<p>and most flexible ways for your needs.</p>
<p>This is why at the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>I never ever do a just list of the things</p>
<p>that you should do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in the just tell me what to do.</p>
<p>First, I tell you why you should do something.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the logical framework that it&rsquo;s grounded in?</p>
<p>And then we distill that down to specific protocols.</p>
<p>For those of you that are too impatient for that,</p>
<p>there are millions, if not billions,</p>
<p>of other resources out there</p>
<p>that will take you into the cul-de-sac</p>
<p>of one protocol that will work and then stop working</p>
<p>or might work for you indefinitely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how we work here.</p>
<p>This is about really understanding the mechanism</p>
<p>so that you can tweak things and modify things,</p>
<p>adjust the timing and the dosage of things,</p>
<p>and really get the most out of these tools and protocols.</p>
<p>Everything I&rsquo;m going to talk about</p>
<p>pertains to both endurance exercise</p>
<p>and strength and speed type exercise.</p>
<p>So sprints, weightlifting, endurance work,</p>
<p>and to some extent flexibility,</p>
<p>but we are going to cover flexibility in depth,</p>
<p>as well as another feature that&rsquo;s not often talked about,</p>
<p>which is suppleness or smoothness of movement</p>
<p>over different ranges of movement in a subsequent episode.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by talking about temperature.</p>
<p>What is temperature?</p>
<p>How does temperature impact the body</p>
<p>and its ability to perform, including learn new skills?</p>
<p>So everyone probably remembers,</p>
<p>or has at least heard of the word homeostasis, right?</p>
<p>That the body wants to remain</p>
<p>in a particular range of temperatures,</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t like to be too hot or too cold.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize from the outset</p>
<p>that there are many mechanisms that are installed into us</p>
<p>by way of our evolutionary design and our genome,</p>
<p>meaning we were just born with this stuff ready</p>
<p>to keep our body temperature in a particular narrow range.</p>
<p>Heating up too much is just plain bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just bad for physical performance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bad for all tissue health.</p>
<p>If your brain heats up too much, neurons start dying,</p>
<p>and those neurons don&rsquo;t come back, okay?</p>
<p>You may have heard about neurogenesis,</p>
<p>the ability for the brain to regenerate itself</p>
<p>or generate new neurons in adulthood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little neurogenesis, excuse me, in adulthood,</p>
<p>even anytime after puberty, really.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want to lose neurons</p>
<p>in the central nervous system.</p>
<p>If you get too hot, that&rsquo;ll happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called hyperthermia.</p>
<p>You want to avoid hyperthermia.</p>
<p>And you have many mechanisms that are built into you</p>
<p>to avoid becoming hyperthermic.</p>
<p>The other thing that happens when we get too warm</p>
<p>is that we have in all of our cells what are called enzymes.</p>
<p>You generally know if something&rsquo;s an enzyme</p>
<p>because it ends in the letters A-S-E, right?</p>
<p>So lipase is an enzyme that exists to digest fats.</p>
<p>You have proteases that are there to digest proteins, right?</p>
<p>So anytime you see A-S-E, chances are it&rsquo;s an enzyme.</p>
<p>Enzymes are proteins,</p>
<p>and they have a particular structure,</p>
<p>and their structure becomes modified when heat increases,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>You want their structure to be of a particular type.</p>
<p>Imagine a car with four wheels.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say the car is the enzyme.</p>
<p>If it gets too hot, it&rsquo;s like two of the wheels fall off,</p>
<p>and that thing can&rsquo;t function.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons why the body and nature</p>
<p>goes through so much effort to build in mechanisms</p>
<p>to make sure that we don&rsquo;t become too warm</p>
<p>is because when we get too warm,</p>
<p>these enzymes don&rsquo;t function.</p>
<p>Cells stop functioning.</p>
<p>They stop being able to generate energy.</p>
<p>They stop being able to digest things.</p>
<p>You stop being able to think,</p>
<p>and eventually those cells start dying off entirely.</p>
<p>So keeping temperature in a particular range is really good.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to get too hot.</p>
<p>We have much more flexibility in terms of getting cold.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t want to become hypothermic either.</p>
<p>You can die from hypothermia</p>
<p>just like you can die from hyperthermia.</p>
<p>However, that you have a lot more range to be cold</p>
<p>than you do to be too warm, okay?</p>
<p>And in general, the idea is to keep the body</p>
<p>and brain in a particular range,</p>
<p>but anytime we do anything,</p>
<p>our body temperature can shift.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you were to stand next to a campfire</p>
<p>or you were outside on a hot day,</p>
<p>various things would happen to dump heat from your body.</p>
<p>If you were outside on a cold day</p>
<p>or you were to get into a cold shower or a cold lake,</p>
<p>various things would happen</p>
<p>to insulate heat within your body.</p>
<p>This is all pretty straightforward and obvious, I realize.</p>
<p>Now, what are those things?</p>
<p>Well, there are a huge category of them.</p>
<p>When you get into cold water, you secrete adrenaline.</p>
<p>On a hot day, if it&rsquo;s really hot or in a very hot sauna</p>
<p>or in the hot desert,</p>
<p>you will generate what are called heat shock proteins,</p>
<p>which will set off other sets of cascades,</p>
<p>metabolic cascades, biological cascades.</p>
<p>But the simplest way to think about this process</p>
<p>is that when we get cold, we tend to vasoconstrict.</p>
<p>Our blood vessels tend to constrict</p>
<p>and we tend to push energy toward the core of our body</p>
<p>to preserve our core organs, okay?</p>
<p>So our periphery, our hands and our feet and our toes</p>
<p>and our legs become colder</p>
<p>and our core therefore can maintain blood to that area</p>
<p>and we are insulating our core.</p>
<p>Conversely, when we heat up, our blood vessels vasodilate.</p>
<p>They expand a bit and more blood flows to our periphery</p>
<p>and more blood can move throughout the body generally</p>
<p>and we will perspire, we will sweat.</p>
<p>Water will actually get pulled out of the blood</p>
<p>to some extent, moved up through sweat glands</p>
<p>and will be brought to the skin surface</p>
<p>so that it can be dumped.</p>
<p>We are dumping heat.</p>
<p>Animals, as you know, vary in their capacity to sweat.</p>
<p>Some animals like camels won&rsquo;t start sweating at first</p>
<p>if they heat up.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;ll do is they&rsquo;ll spit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll dump heat by spitting, okay?</p>
<p>Dogs pant.</p>
<p>Costello&rsquo;s off to my left here.</p>
<p>He pants when he gets too warm.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t sweat or dogs can maybe sweat a little bit</p>
<p>but we can sweat and you&rsquo;ve probably noticed</p>
<p>that on a humid hot day, you&rsquo;ll feel much warmer</p>
<p>just walking or running than you would</p>
<p>with the equivalent exercise or movement</p>
<p>that you would on a cold day</p>
<p>and some of you probably know this but if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the reason is you sweat on a cold day</p>
<p>but because the air is dry typically,</p>
<p>you will bring that sweat to the surface</p>
<p>and provided you&rsquo;re wearing clothes</p>
<p>that allow some air to get out away from the body</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not wearing really tight spandex type clothing</p>
<p>or something like that</p>
<p>or seal type, saran wrap type clothing,</p>
<p>that sweat will evaporate off into the dry atmosphere</p>
<p>whereas on a humid day,</p>
<p>the reason you see people in New York and Florida</p>
<p>on a humid summer day</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like moving their shirts off themselves</p>
<p>and you see people with big sweat stains</p>
<p>and back sweat stains and all this kind of stuff</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re sweating as they normally would</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s humid and so the humidity of the air</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t allow transfer of that sweat</p>
<p>into the atmosphere as readily and so you&rsquo;re hot, okay?</p>
<p>So without the evaporation, you&rsquo;re going to be warmer.</p>
<p>So we evaporate off sweat, we sweat</p>
<p>and we vasodilate when we want to dump heat.</p>
<p>When we want to maintain heat, we vasoconstrict</p>
<p>and we tend to not sweat.</p>
<p>The other thing that happens is you&rsquo;ll get goose bumps,</p>
<p>so-called goose pimples they&rsquo;re sometimes called.</p>
<p>Those are a throwback to the time where we had fur</p>
<p>over most not all of our body.</p>
<p>All mammals in the cold have a process</p>
<p>whereby adrenaline is released at low levels</p>
<p>typically into the body.</p>
<p>That adrenaline activates what are called</p>
<p>sympathetic fibers, they have nothing to do with sympathy.</p>
<p>Those little fibers which are neurons,</p>
<p>those fibers that what I&rsquo;m saying are fibers are neurons</p>
<p>not clothing fibers, reach up into the skin</p>
<p>so your whole body is covered with these little tiny neurons</p>
<p>that reach up into the skin and when we are cold,</p>
<p>they actually mechanically take the hair follicle</p>
<p>and bend it up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a process called piloerection, P-I-L-O erection, okay?</p>
<p>So on a hot day, you want to dump heat, okay?</p>
<p>So on a hot day, what would happen is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d actually not see those goose pimples</p>
<p>because you want the hairs lying down</p>
<p>which actually you would think that might insulate you more</p>
<p>but would actually let more heat dissipate</p>
<p>out through the skin.</p>
<p>On a cold day, you get these goose pimples or goose bumps</p>
<p>which are really just an ancient carryover</p>
<p>from the body&rsquo;s attempt to make hair stand up on end</p>
<p>and when hair stand up on end</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very close together,</p>
<p>that traps air in between them</p>
<p>and actually creates a sort of insulated blanket of warm air.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever seen an animal like a malamute or a husky,</p>
<p>you might think, oh, that poor thing on a hot day,</p>
<p>what does it do with all that hair?</p>
<p>Well, it can be warm so the animal will typically pant</p>
<p>and its hair will lay down</p>
<p>which you might think would act as more of a blanket</p>
<p>but on a cold day, what&rsquo;ll happen is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll become very puffy,</p>
<p>their hair will stand up on end</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually trapping heat between the hairs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually quite well insulated.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important that if you want to understand</p>
<p>how you can leverage temperature for physical performance,</p>
<p>you have to understand that you have vasoconstriction</p>
<p>to conserve heat, vasodilation to dump heat,</p>
<p>that you have sweating to dump heat</p>
<p>and you have conservation of fluids</p>
<p>in order to preserve heat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most important thing</p>
<p>in terms of understanding the mechanisms</p>
<p>of maintaining and dumping heat.</p>
<p>And now the most important thing to understand</p>
<p>is that if you get too hot,</p>
<p>not only do those enzymes stop working</p>
<p>but your ability to contract your muscles stops, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to repeat this because it&rsquo;s vitally important.</p>
<p>ATP is involved in the process</p>
<p>of generating muscle contractions,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re running a marathon,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re doing a yoga class,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re going for a 700 pound squat.</p>
<p>The range of temperatures within which ATP can function</p>
<p>and muscles can contract is very narrow.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 39 or 40 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>it drops off and you will not be able</p>
<p>to generate more contractions.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s pretty hot,</p>
<p>but that temperature can be generated locally really fast.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re too cold, it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to generate muscle contractions.</p>
<p>I got into doing some cold water swimming a little while ago</p>
<p>and we would joke that, you know, you come out of the water,</p>
<p>we do no wetsuits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending people do this necessarily</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re certainly with somebody else</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s skilled at doing it, which I was.</p>
<p>And you come out and you feel like you have claws for hands.</p>
<p>You can, you know, you could never text on a phone</p>
<p>for the first few minutes.</p>
<p>I mean, the water was very, very cold</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t even move your face.</p>
<p>And so muscles will become rigid,</p>
<p>but heating up muscles causes them to fail</p>
<p>to be able to generate more contractions.</p>
<p>Put simply, if you get too hot, you stop exercising.</p>
<p>You may not even realize it,</p>
<p>but your will to exercise further,</p>
<p>your ability to push harder is entirely dependent</p>
<p>on the heat of the muscle, both locally</p>
<p>and your whole system.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about your whole system</p>
<p>because I just described heat dumping and heat maintaining.</p>
<p>I told you that increasing heat makes it hard</p>
<p>for muscles to contract.</p>
<p>It will stop you from being able to run further and faster.</p>
<p>It will stop you from being able to lift more weights,</p>
<p>more sets, more repetitions.</p>
<p>If you can keep temperature in range, however,</p>
<p>in a proper range, you will be able to do more work.</p>
<p>You will be able to create greater output.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to lift more weight, more sets, more reps,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be able to run further.</p>
<p>Now, there are data that I&rsquo;m going to talk about</p>
<p>in a little bit that are absolutely striking</p>
<p>that underscore that statement.</p>
<p>There are data from my colleague, Craig Heller&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>in the Department of Biology at Stanford.</p>
<p>And there are data that are now being implemented.</p>
<p>They were first implemented in a grant funded by DARPA,</p>
<p>but now in professional sports teams.</p>
<p>Many, if not all the NFL teams are now using this technology</p>
<p>as well as military uses it.</p>
<p>And not just for sports performance,</p>
<p>but also firefighters, construction workers,</p>
<p>other professions where elevated heat</p>
<p>becomes a barrier to performance.</p>
<p>And you can leverage this to really improve your workouts.</p>
<p>And when I say really improve, it is striking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give away a little hint of this now,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m going to tell you a little bit more</p>
<p>of the data later after I tell you the protocols.</p>
<p>Proper cooling of the body,</p>
<p>which has to be done in a very specific way,</p>
<p>has allowed recreational athletes or college students</p>
<p>and typical adults, as well as professional athletes</p>
<p>to go from doing their usual output,</p>
<p>in this case, that what comes to mind best</p>
<p>would be a particular professional athlete</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a member of the 49ers at the time,</p>
<p>was able to do 40 dips on his first set, 30, 20, 20,</p>
<p>basically did 10 sets of dips unassisted with anything else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an impressive, impressive,</p>
<p>especially since he&rsquo;s a really large guy.</p>
<p>40 dips is a respectable.</p>
<p>These are strict full range dips.</p>
<p>And then by the 10th set, there&rsquo;s a steep drop-off.</p>
<p>Using proper cooling of particular body compartments,</p>
<p>he was able to triple that within less than a week</p>
<p>and maintain that performance</p>
<p>even without the cooling approach.</p>
<p>So it was actually a conditioning effect, all right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get back to this in a little bit,</p>
<p>but there are other fantastic leaps of effort</p>
<p>and leaps of performance that were demonstrated,</p>
<p>including endurance running.</p>
<p>Before I continue any further,</p>
<p>I just want to underscore again</p>
<p>that overheating is terrible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous example of this.</p>
<p>This was about 10, 15 years ago</p>
<p>when a number of dietary supplements</p>
<p>that included things like epinephrine,</p>
<p>which is a stimulant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beta adrenergic stimulant.</p>
<p>Drugs like clenbuterol,</p>
<p>which were then banned from the Olympics,</p>
<p>which are still out there a bit in recreational use,</p>
<p>which were beta adrenergic agonists.</p>
<p>So these are drugs that sort of mimic</p>
<p>epinephrine adrenaline to some extent.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m oversimplifying this here.</p>
<p>They improve fat loss because of the effects on metabolism,</p>
<p>but they heat up the body.</p>
<p>And what happened was, this hit the press very widely,</p>
<p>is high school football players</p>
<p>and various professional athletes were dropping dead</p>
<p>because they were overheating</p>
<p>during practice or in competition.</p>
<p>So much so that clenbuterol was banned,</p>
<p>although every once in a while</p>
<p>somebody gets in trouble for using this.</p>
<p>There was an instance of this recently</p>
<p>in professional boxing,</p>
<p>which was attributed to a bad meat</p>
<p>that contained the clenbuterol.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the source was.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any commentary about that,</p>
<p>but it still is in use,</p>
<p>but these drugs increase body temperature,</p>
<p>increase fat loss, but carry a severe danger.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the danger of hyperthermia.</p>
<p>In fact, I would argue,</p>
<p>and I think in talking to some folks</p>
<p>at various professional fighting organizations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear that a lot of the deaths</p>
<p>that one sees in professional combat sports</p>
<p>may have to do as much with dehydration and overheating</p>
<p>as it does with getting hit in the head,</p>
<p>which is also bad, but that things can compound,</p>
<p>they can have a synergistic effect.</p>
<p>And just a note about that and hyperthermia</p>
<p>and its dangers as well.</p>
<p>My first project ever in science</p>
<p>was to evaluate the thermogenic effects of MDMA, of ecstasy.</p>
<p>That was my senior thesis in college actually.</p>
<p>And so what we found was that indeed drugs</p>
<p>that remove your understanding of how warm you are</p>
<p>cause you to not take on the appropriate behaviors</p>
<p>to cool yourself, right?</p>
<p>So your vasoconstriction and your sweating,</p>
<p>those are autonomic.</p>
<p>Those are going to happen no matter what,</p>
<p>unless you happen to take something</p>
<p>that blocks that effect.</p>
<p>However, there are a lot of things that we as humans do</p>
<p>to prevent ourselves from overheating.</p>
<p>And the main one is stop.</p>
<p>When we are running in the desert</p>
<p>or when we&rsquo;re running very hard and suddenly we stop,</p>
<p>oftentimes that&rsquo;s because the muscles are overheating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a subconscious thing.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t often think, oh, I&rsquo;m really much too warm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we stop</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a self-preservation mechanism.</p>
<p>Sometimes it kicks in too early.</p>
<p>Sometimes it kicks in too late.</p>
<p>Kicks in too late, you can die.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an instance in the 1984 Olympics</p>
<p>where that was the first year I believe</p>
<p>that there was a women&rsquo;s marathon.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>And one of the front runners or top picks for winning</p>
<p>was heading into the stadium.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden it seemed as if she was lost.</p>
<p>She was kind of wandering around</p>
<p>not knowing where she should go.</p>
<p>And in fact, she was in a position to win</p>
<p>or at least take second place, at least take silver,</p>
<p>got totally disoriented and did miserably in the race.</p>
<p>And she was hyperthermic.</p>
<p>She was running against that reflex to stop.</p>
<p>So dumping heat is key.</p>
<p>So how do you dump heat</p>
<p>in order to perform longer safely?</p>
<p>Well, in order to understand that,</p>
<p>you have to understand that the body</p>
<p>has three main compartments for regulating temperature.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just have a center and a periphery.</p>
<p>We have three main compartments.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one compartment in particular</p>
<p>that all of you or most all of you, I have to assume have.</p>
<p>And if you can understand how that works,</p>
<p>you can do tremendous things for your performance</p>
<p>and for your recovery.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m about to tell you will allow you</p>
<p>to perform better in all forms of exercise.</p>
<p>And it is not commonly known, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to try and change that.</p>
<p>You have three compartments</p>
<p>for increasing or dumping heat in your body.</p>
<p>One is your core.</p>
<p>We already talked about that.</p>
<p>Your core organs, your heart, your lungs,</p>
<p>your pancreas, your liver, the core of your body.</p>
<p>The other is your periphery,</p>
<p>which are obviously your arms and your legs</p>
<p>and your feet and your hands.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s a third component,</p>
<p>which is there are three locations on your body</p>
<p>that are far better at passing heat out of the body</p>
<p>and bringing cool into the body,</p>
<p>such that you can heat up</p>
<p>or cool your body everywhere very quickly.</p>
<p>Those three areas are your face,</p>
<p>the palms of your hands, and the bottoms of your feet.</p>
<p>Now, the skin on your hands</p>
<p>and on the bottoms of your feet,</p>
<p>and to some extent on your face,</p>
<p>are called glabrous skin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s G-L-A-B-O-R-O-U-S, glabrous skin.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s special about those areas of your body</p>
<p>and the glabrous skin</p>
<p>is that the arrangement of vasculature,</p>
<p>of blood vessels, capillaries,</p>
<p>and arteries that serve those regions,</p>
<p>is very different than it is elsewhere in your body.</p>
<p>Now, this has ancient roots.</p>
<p>Typically, if you were another mammal,</p>
<p>like a bear or some sort of ape,</p>
<p>you would have hair all over your body.</p>
<p>Now, we all know some pretty hairy people,</p>
<p>or presumably you&rsquo;ve heard that there are these hairy people.</p>
<p>I know a few excessively hairy people,</p>
<p>and Costello is excessively hairy,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not a person, obviously.</p>
<p>But all mammals have hair on their bodies.</p>
<p>Just some people have very light hair or very fine hair.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have hair on these glabrous skin regions.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you can have beard or facial hair growth,</p>
<p>but there are still regions like the cheeks</p>
<p>and other areas that maintain this special vasculature, okay?</p>
<p>So technically, the hands and feet are real glabrous skin,</p>
<p>and the face is not always quite classified as glabrous,</p>
<p>but these three locations,</p>
<p>face, palms of hands, not tops, and bottoms of feet,</p>
<p>are very good at dumping heat and bringing in cool.</p>
<p>And the reason is there&rsquo;s a rule in vascular biology</p>
<p>that blood moves from arteries to capillaries</p>
<p>and then to veins and then back to the heart, okay?</p>
<p>So arteries, which are the big ones, obviously,</p>
<p>capillaries, which are the little fine ones</p>
<p>where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged,</p>
<p>and veins, which then bring blood back to the heart</p>
<p>and other tissues, of course.</p>
<p>In these three regions of your hands, your face,</p>
<p>and the bottoms of your feet,</p>
<p>we have what are called AVAs.</p>
<p>AVAs are a very special pattern of vasculature.</p>
<p>AVAs are described in the medical textbooks.</p>
<p>You can find them in Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy,</p>
<p>not the television show,</p>
<p>but the actual Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy textbook,</p>
<p>which is a real thing that exists,</p>
<p>and in all medical textbooks, okay?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about AVAs and what they are</p>
<p>and why they allow these three regions of the body</p>
<p>to heat or cool ourselves more readily.</p>
<p>So what are AVAs?</p>
<p>AVAs are arteriovenous asthmoses.</p>
<p>So if you want to look that up,</p>
<p>you can just look up AVAs, veins,</p>
<p>capillaries, arteries, if you like,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll spell it for you.</p>
<p>A-R-T-E-R-I-O, arteriovenous, V-E-N-O-U-S,</p>
<p>arteriovenous anastomosis, A-N-A-S-T-O-M-O-S-E-S.</p>
<p>Arteriovenous asthmoses, okay?</p>
<p>You want to know about arteriovenous asthmoses, trust me.</p>
<p>And you want to remember that they are in your hands,</p>
<p>the bottoms of your feet, and on your face,</p>
<p>and in particular, on the palms of your hands,</p>
<p>not the tops of your hands.</p>
<p>Now, before I said blood flows typically</p>
<p>from arteries to capillaries to veins,</p>
<p>and then back to the heart,</p>
<p>but AVAs are direct connections</p>
<p>between the small arteries and the small veins.</p>
<p>They bypass the capillaries to some extent.</p>
<p>They are little short vessel segments.</p>
<p>They have a big, large inner diameter,</p>
<p>and they have this very thick muscular wall,</p>
<p>and they get input from what are called adrenergic neurons.</p>
<p>They get input from neurons</p>
<p>that release norepinephrine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>which allows them to contract or dilate.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s some rules of physics</p>
<p>that talk about how the radius of a pipe</p>
<p>and small changes in the radius of a pipe</p>
<p>leads to massive increases in the rate</p>
<p>and amount of stuff that can flow through that pipe, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a rule of physics that says essentially</p>
<p>that the radius is proportional</p>
<p>to the amount of stuff that can flow</p>
<p>through something to the fourth power.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to make this a physics class,</p>
<p>but if you want to look that up, you can.</p>
<p>You can just look up how does the radius of a tube or pipe</p>
<p>relate to how quickly or how much stuff can flow through it.</p>
<p>What you need to know,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t want to know any of the underlying physics,</p>
<p>is that these AVAs allow more heat</p>
<p>to leave the body more quickly</p>
<p>and more cool to enter the body more quickly</p>
<p>than other venous arterial capillary beds</p>
<p>throughout the body.</p>
<p>In other words, you can heat up best at the face,</p>
<p>the palms, and the bottoms of the feet,</p>
<p>and you can cool down best at the face,</p>
<p>the palms, and the bottoms of the feet</p>
<p>than you can anywhere else on your body.</p>
<p>And when I say heat up or cool down,</p>
<p>I mean actually heat or cool the core and your brain, okay?</p>
<p>So this is vitally important.</p>
<p>I realize we&rsquo;re getting down</p>
<p>into the mechanistic weeds here,</p>
<p>but you need to know that these three compartments</p>
<p>of your body, palms, bottoms of feet, and face</p>
<p>are your best leverage points for manipulating temperature</p>
<p>to vastly improve physical performance, okay?</p>
<p>I also want to point out</p>
<p>that the work that I&rsquo;m going to tell you about</p>
<p>is not work from my laboratory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the work of, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>my colleague Craig Heller&rsquo;s laboratory at Stanford.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to have Craig on as a guest</p>
<p>to talk more about these discoveries.</p>
<p>They are his and his colleagues&rsquo; discoveries</p>
<p>and how you can leverage them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re building out some amazing technology.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with Craig yesterday</p>
<p>as a prelude to this episode</p>
<p>and to the future conversation with him.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re getting the very latest on this topic.</p>
<p>So what Craig and his colleagues did</p>
<p>really illustrates perfectly</p>
<p>what these body surfaces can do and why.</p>
<p>They were studying overheating in athletes</p>
<p>and in military and in construction workers</p>
<p>and trying to prevent it.</p>
<p>And they did a bunch of experiments.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into all of them now,</p>
<p>but what they essentially found</p>
<p>was that cooling the palms, Palmer cooling,</p>
<p>allowed people, athletes, and recreational athletes</p>
<p>to run much further, to lift more weight,</p>
<p>and to do more sets and reps</p>
<p>to a absolutely staggering degree.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk for a second a bit more about why we stop,</p>
<p>why we shut off effort when we get too hot.</p>
<p>Because in doing so, you&rsquo;ll really understand</p>
<p>how and why the best protocols exist</p>
<p>for being able to do more work,</p>
<p>to be able to exercise longer</p>
<p>and actually to feel good doing it.</p>
<p>You actually can make a doubling of your dips</p>
<p>or believe it or not, a tripling or quadrupling</p>
<p>or more of your pull-ups fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>I mentioned before that when muscle heats up,</p>
<p>enzymes start getting disrupted</p>
<p>and ATP and muscles can&rsquo;t work so well</p>
<p>and those muscles can&rsquo;t contract.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get a little more specific about that.</p>
<p>The enzyme that&rsquo;s involved here</p>
<p>is something called pyruvate kinase.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know about pyruvate kinase,</p>
<p>but what you do need to know is that it ends A-S-E,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s an enzyme.</p>
<p>And pyruvate kinase is essentially a rate-limiting step.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a critical step that you can&rsquo;t bypass</p>
<p>if you want muscles to contract</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very temperature sensitive.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you can keep temperature lower,</p>
<p>you can do more work per unit time.</p>
<p>You can do more pull-ups.</p>
<p>And that actually was done by Craig and his colleagues.</p>
<p>The pull-ups weren&rsquo;t actually done by Craig.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many pull-ups Craig can do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask him next time, both cooled and uncooled,</p>
<p>how many pull-ups he can do.</p>
<p>But what they essentially did</p>
<p>is they brought someone into their laboratory</p>
<p>who could do 10 pull-ups on the first set</p>
<p>and they were able to get 10, rest two or three minutes,</p>
<p>get another 10, rest two or three minutes.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever tried this,</p>
<p>what you find is that you start dropping</p>
<p>to eight, seven, six, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, the person might not necessarily feel</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re overheating,</p>
<p>but the muscle is heating up.</p>
<p>Then with their knowledge that these AVAs,</p>
<p>that these portals in the palms are a great way</p>
<p>to both heat the body,</p>
<p>but also to dump heat from the body,</p>
<p>they used a device.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll talk about what you can do at home,</p>
<p>but a device where they had people hold on</p>
<p>to what was essentially a cold tube.</p>
<p>Now, this is crucial.</p>
<p>The tube can&rsquo;t be so cold</p>
<p>that it causes vasoconstriction</p>
<p>because then the cold won&rsquo;t pass from the tube</p>
<p>to the hand and to the core.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s the right temperature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s neither too hot nor too cold,</p>
<p>that cool from the cold tube passes into the hand,</p>
<p>these so-called palmar regions,</p>
<p>and then cools the core.</p>
<p>And in theory, by lowering body temperature</p>
<p>would allow the person or the athlete to do more work.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s what they saw.</p>
<p>The actual data, the specific data showed</p>
<p>that subjects could do,</p>
<p>at least the subjects they worked with,</p>
<p>on their first day with no cooling,</p>
<p>about a hundred pull-ups</p>
<p>across the timeframe that they had, okay?</p>
<p>So it might&rsquo;ve taken anywhere from 10 to 15</p>
<p>or maybe more sets,</p>
<p>depending on how skilled that person was,</p>
<p>but in a fixed amount of time.</p>
<p>Then they came back and did the cooling.</p>
<p>They did it the very next day,</p>
<p>which if you&rsquo;ve ever trained a muscle the very next day,</p>
<p>typically you wouldn&rsquo;t do as well in its training</p>
<p>if it took any damage from the previous session,</p>
<p>or you at least do as well,</p>
<p>but you probably wouldn&rsquo;t do what they then observed,</p>
<p>which was they started cooling after every other set.</p>
<p>The person would just hold the cold tube,</p>
<p>cool down the body after every other set rest,</p>
<p>everything else was kept the same.</p>
<p>And they found that they went to 180 pull-ups,</p>
<p>which is incredible, it&rsquo;s a near doubling.</p>
<p>And by doing this repeatedly over several sessions,</p>
<p>over several weeks,</p>
<p>they quickly went in the cooling group</p>
<p>from a maximum of somewhere between 180 and 200,</p>
<p>as I recall, I&rsquo;m sort of estimating now,</p>
<p>to 600 pull-ups in the equivalent amount of time,</p>
<p>which is absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>They then repeated this in a study on the bench press.</p>
<p>And actually the bench press study was pretty interesting</p>
<p>because they actually had a control group</p>
<p>that was admittedly taking specific amounts</p>
<p>of anabolic steroids,</p>
<p>the anabolic steroid was testosterone cypionate,</p>
<p>which is essentially testosterone.</p>
<p>And indeed the testosterone cypionate,</p>
<p>the steroid group improved at a rate of about 1% per week.</p>
<p>In other words, there were differences.</p>
<p>And the cooling group basically left all other groups</p>
<p>in the dust, it was just remarkable.</p>
<p>So cooling the core,</p>
<p>I want to be very clear that it&rsquo;s not cooling the muscle,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t about cooling the chest alone</p>
<p>or just cooling the palms.</p>
<p>It was about allowing cold to pass through the palms</p>
<p>because of the unique vasculature that&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>these AVAs, allowed the subjects</p>
<p>to do far more work per unit time.</p>
<p>And the important thing is that if they were to come back</p>
<p>after doing 600 pull-ups or 500 pull-ups,</p>
<p>you might say, well, wow,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to create a situation</p>
<p>where recovery is going to be absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>They could come back, not use the cooling,</p>
<p>and they still saw a highly significant increase</p>
<p>in the amount or the number of pull-ups or dips</p>
<p>or bench press weight that they could do, okay?</p>
<p>So what that meant is that it was both</p>
<p>an excellent performance</p>
<p>and an excellent training stimulus</p>
<p>that they were able to recover from, okay?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if all of you are following this,</p>
<p>but these are the sorts of increases in exercise output</p>
<p>that are absolutely staggering.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why professional teams and the military</p>
<p>and others capitalized on them very quickly</p>
<p>and use these, okay?</p>
<p>Now, you may be asking, what about endurance, right?</p>
<p>Not everyone wants to be able to bench press a lot</p>
<p>for multiple reps and sets.</p>
<p>And I should just mention for the bench pressing,</p>
<p>it was, I believe they found people</p>
<p>that could bench press 225,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s two 45-pound plates</p>
<p>on the 45-pound standard Olympic bar</p>
<p>for repetitions of anywhere from six to 10.</p>
<p>And then they had them do the same thing.</p>
<p>They did a set, they&rsquo;d rest two or three minutes,</p>
<p>sometimes up to four minutes,</p>
<p>then do another set, repeat, repeat, repeat.</p>
<p>And with cooling, they were able to increase</p>
<p>the amount of work, the number of reps with the same weight.</p>
<p>Sometimes they did have to increase sets</p>
<p>to approximately double, so it was pretty fantastic.</p>
<p>So with endurance, similar increases have been shown.</p>
<p>And the way that they would do those tests</p>
<p>are a little bit different.</p>
<p>And they also point to a really important mechanism</p>
<p>of why we stop doing work at all</p>
<p>when we perceive that we are putting in too much effort.</p>
<p>And so it gets right to the heart</p>
<p>of the relationship between temperature and muscle</p>
<p>and your willpower.</p>
<p>Those are directly related.</p>
<p>Your body heat and your willpower</p>
<p>are linked in a physiological way.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not talking about the kind of stuff</p>
<p>that you see as kind of like clickbait on the internet</p>
<p>or like increase willpower now or become resilient now</p>
<p>or never do this again if you want to be mentally strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about a physiological mechanism</p>
<p>that exists in the body and brain</p>
<p>that causes you to stop or that will allow you</p>
<p>to continue to go harder and further</p>
<p>than you normally would.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about willpower and heat</p>
<p>and how heat shuts you down.</p>
<p>In other words, if you are cool,</p>
<p>if your body temperature is in a particular range,</p>
<p>not only can you go further,</p>
<p>but you will go further if you want to.</p>
<p>Said differently, if you heat up too much,</p>
<p>you will stop or you will die.</p>
<p>Typically people stop.</p>
<p>There are individuals who will push to the point</p>
<p>where they black out and die in the same way that,</p>
<p>and please don&rsquo;t do this experiment.</p>
<p>There are people who can sit down face-to-face</p>
<p>and say, let&rsquo;s hold our breath</p>
<p>and whoever breathes first loses.</p>
<p>Some people will just go until it&rsquo;s painful</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll gasp and take a big breath.</p>
<p>There are always those individuals</p>
<p>who can override that reflex</p>
<p>and they will go until they pass out, okay?</p>
<p>And if you do that in water, you can very easily die.</p>
<p>So please don&rsquo;t do that experiment.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a reflex that relates the body to the brain</p>
<p>and the brain to the body</p>
<p>that shuts off our effort when we get too hot.</p>
<p>So what Craig and his colleagues and now others have done</p>
<p>is to do a test in the laboratory</p>
<p>where rather than ask people to run outside</p>
<p>until they absolutely don&rsquo;t want to run anymore,</p>
<p>you put them on a treadmill and you set the speed, okay?</p>
<p>So they have to keep up with the treadmill</p>
<p>and at some point they quit.</p>
<p>And you take groups and you do those</p>
<p>in different temperature environments.</p>
<p>So some people are running in a nice chilly laboratory,</p>
<p>they get their heart rate up.</p>
<p>So maybe their heart rate goes from, you know,</p>
<p>40 or 50 baseline heart rate,</p>
<p>maybe it gets up to 80 or 100.</p>
<p>And then they keep the rate of the treadmill going the same</p>
<p>and they will just plateau.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re getting to a steady state cadence or rhythm</p>
<p>and their heart is beating at more or less a steady state.</p>
<p>Eventually they&rsquo;ll probably stop</p>
<p>because they have something else to do,</p>
<p>but people will continue at that temperature</p>
<p>and at that heart rate,</p>
<p>unless you start turning up the temperature in the room.</p>
<p>And at some point they will stop</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll stop much earlier when it gets hot</p>
<p>because of something called cardiac drift, okay?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m running</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m running at a steady cadence on this treadmill</p>
<p>and my heart rate is 85 beats per minute</p>
<p>or 100 beats per minute, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say 100, just for sake of example.</p>
<p>Well, just making the room hotter</p>
<p>is going to increase my heart rate further,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m at the same output.</p>
<p>And the brain does a computation.</p>
<p>It somehow figures out that there&rsquo;s a heat component</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s increasing heart rate.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an effort component from running</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s driving heart rate.</p>
<p>And if the heat component</p>
<p>and the heart rate output from the effort</p>
<p>get to hit a certain threshold, I stop, okay?</p>
<p>And some of you may think,</p>
<p>well, there are people who just run and run and run</p>
<p>and never stop.</p>
<p>Eventually everyone stops.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because the race ended.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because everyone else quit.</p>
<p>I actually saw some stuff online.</p>
<p>There are these races where people</p>
<p>just will continuously do the same loop</p>
<p>until everyone else drops out.</p>
<p>And then one guy or gal keeps going past everybody.</p>
<p>But typically it stops because the race is over</p>
<p>or because people quit.</p>
<p>Increasing temperature increases the rate of quitting</p>
<p>in part, not entirely, but in part</p>
<p>because of this thing called cardiac drift,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;ve probably experienced</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been out on a hot day and you&rsquo;re walking uphill,</p>
<p>you might stop to take a breath.</p>
<p>If you sit in a sauna, your heart rate will increase.</p>
<p>Heat increases heart rate.</p>
<p>Effort increases heart rate.</p>
<p>At a steady effort, you&rsquo;ll have a steady heart rate.</p>
<p>If you increase the heat in the environment</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re engaging in that steady heart rate,</p>
<p>your heart rate will now go up due to cardiac drift</p>
<p>and you will quit, okay?</p>
<p>So Heller and colleagues have done experiments</p>
<p>where they do Palmer cooling under these environments.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s wonderful because not only does it enable people</p>
<p>to go further and faster for much longer,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been shown statistically significant every time,</p>
<p>but it also protects the brain and body</p>
<p>against hyperthermia, overheating, coma, nerve injury,</p>
<p>nerve death, and actual death, okay?</p>
<p>So you can see why this is such a valuable tool.</p>
<p>So what are they doing?</p>
<p>Well, in this case too,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re having them cool their hands</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re cooling the palms.</p>
<p>Cooling the palms of the feet is a little trickier,</p>
<p>but cooling the face could actually work as well.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about cooling the face</p>
<p>and how to incorporate this.</p>
<p>So at this point,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just really wanted to impress upon you,</p>
<p>not impress you, but impress upon you,</p>
<p>the fact that you have these three surfaces of your body</p>
<p>that are very good at passing cold into the body</p>
<p>such that it cools the core body temperature.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good thing for health and safety.</p>
<p>And in order to maintain work output</p>
<p>over longer periods of time,</p>
<p>or actually just do more work.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, the result is just so staggering</p>
<p>is the 100 to 180 pull-ups in the controls</p>
<p>and then 600 pull-ups in the cooled individuals, right?</p>
<p>They actually also feel mentally</p>
<p>as if they can do more work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that they can,</p>
<p>their willpower is adjusted somehow</p>
<p>by these shifts in temperature.</p>
<p>Now, before we continue and get to the exact ways</p>
<p>that any number of us can start to use this information,</p>
<p>I want to talk about the opposite thing, which is heating.</p>
<p>And you have to remember that these surfaces,</p>
<p>the palms and the bottoms of the feet and the face,</p>
<p>were not just arranged with these AVAs,</p>
<p>these special ways to pass blood from arteries to veins</p>
<p>in order to cool us for better athletic performance</p>
<p>or to heat us on cold days, but for both of those things.</p>
<p>Now, Heller and colleagues and others have also explored</p>
<p>how these can be used to heat up the core.</p>
<p>There are times when we want to heat up our core.</p>
<p>Typically, we hear that most of the heat escapes</p>
<p>through our head, so we&rsquo;ll put on a hat when we go outside.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not true.</p>
<p>Most of your heat escapes through your face,</p>
<p>the palms of your hands, and the bottoms of your feet.</p>
<p>Now you should know why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>What this means is that for post-surgery patients</p>
<p>or for people that are hypothermic,</p>
<p>indeed, you want to heat the core, right?</p>
<p>But actually, I was on a swim recently</p>
<p>where a friend became hypothermic.</p>
<p>He was kind of slurring his words</p>
<p>and kind of staggering around</p>
<p>when we got him back on the beach.</p>
<p>We brought him over to the lifeguard station.</p>
<p>He turned out to be fine.</p>
<p>Again, this is why cold water swims</p>
<p>are something that you really need to do in groups,</p>
<p>not alone, and you really have to know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>There were reasons for why this happened that day.</p>
<p>But we were, basically, people thought</p>
<p>we were a little strange</p>
<p>until they realized what was happening.</p>
<p>We were walking down the beach,</p>
<p>basically sandwiching him at our chest</p>
<p>because we were still warmer than the ambient environment,</p>
<p>the environment around us,</p>
<p>and we were pushing our chest against him</p>
<p>to try and warm him up, to warm up his core.</p>
<p>In retrospect, that was the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>In talking with Craig and talking to other colleagues</p>
<p>that work on thermogenesis,</p>
<p>what we should have done was warm the palms of his hands,</p>
<p>the bottoms of his feet, and his face</p>
<p>because that would insulate the heat loss.</p>
<p>Now, he was very cold,</p>
<p>so presumably there was vasoconstriction of the veins</p>
<p>at these locations,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s not clear</p>
<p>that that would have been the only strategy to use.</p>
<p>But they have explored how to heat up post-surgery patients,</p>
<p>and one of the best ways to do that</p>
<p>is to get warm socks on the bottoms of the feet,</p>
<p>get gloves on the hands,</p>
<p>and if it can be done safely, to warm the face.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you don&rsquo;t want to obstruct respiration</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But again, the ability to pass heat into the body</p>
<p>or to remove heat to the body</p>
<p>is best done through these three surfaces.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize that enough.</p>
<p>So I mentioned before that you want to cool the palms</p>
<p>or the bottoms of the feet,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s a little harder to do, or the face,</p>
<p>but not so much that the blood vessels constrict</p>
<p>because then you won&rsquo;t be able to pass cool into the body</p>
<p>because those pipes got smaller,</p>
<p>and therefore you can&rsquo;t pass cool into the body.</p>
<p>So how can you start to incorporate this?</p>
<p>Well, Craig and colleagues have a company</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve spun out through Stanford.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that when we sit down with Craig,</p>
<p>that has made engineered devices that are optimal for this,</p>
<p>that are going to keep those passages open,</p>
<p>keep the size of those veins correct</p>
<p>to pass cool into the body quickly</p>
<p>for sake of elite sports performance</p>
<p>and even recreational sports performance.</p>
<p>But you can actually start to incorporate this.</p>
<p>First of all, I always get asked,</p>
<p>how cold should the water be?</p>
<p>Should it be ice water?</p>
<p>Should it be very cold water?</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>If you want to experience some of this effect</p>
<p>without a device, one thing you could do</p>
<p>would be for instance, to do, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use the gym or the treadmill as an example.</p>
<p>You could do your maximum number of pull-ups, stop,</p>
<p>and then you could actually put your hands into</p>
<p>or on the surface of a sink that is presumably stopped up</p>
<p>with cool water.</p>
<p>So not ice water, not freezing cold, but cool water.</p>
<p>Slightly cooler than body temperature</p>
<p>before you started training would be a good place to start.</p>
<p>You do that for 10 to 30 seconds,</p>
<p>then you could go back and do your next set.</p>
<p>You would repeat the cooling.</p>
<p>You would want to extend the amount of cooling somewhat.</p>
<p>So you might want to do that for 30 seconds to a minute.</p>
<p>This is not going to be perfect.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to play with how cold to make it</p>
<p>in order to get the optimal effect.</p>
<p>But you ought to see an effect nonetheless.</p>
<p>The same is true if you&rsquo;re running and you&rsquo;re fatiguing,</p>
<p>obviously you don&rsquo;t want to become hyperthermic,</p>
<p>cooling the hands or the bottoms of your feet or the face</p>
<p>would be the ideal way to dump heat</p>
<p>in order to be able to generate more output.</p>
<p>Now, the face is something</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t talked a lot about.</p>
<p>Everything I&rsquo;ve told you up until now also says</p>
<p>that if you are somebody who tends to get cold</p>
<p>when you are outside, say in the winter or even in the fall,</p>
<p>you tend to run cold,</p>
<p>warming your face is going to be the most important thing</p>
<p>that you can do.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to do that without looking strange,</p>
<p>like wearing a ski mask or something like that,</p>
<p>but that is going to be more effective</p>
<p>than covering and warming any other part of your body.</p>
<p>Although it would be quite strange</p>
<p>if you only had a ski mask on</p>
<p>and you weren&rsquo;t wearing clothes anywhere else on your body.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend doing that outside.</p>
<p>That will get you into all sorts of other kinds of trouble.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be good for anybody.</p>
<p>But now you understand the principle and the locations</p>
<p>at which to deliver heat and cold.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that you are out for a run</p>
<p>and you want to incorporate this cooling mechanism.</p>
<p>I talked to Craig about this.</p>
<p>I said, what would be the kind of poor person&rsquo;s approach</p>
<p>to this before this device is commercially available?</p>
<p>And he said, well, you could take a frozen juice can,</p>
<p>if you have one of those, or a very cold can of soda,</p>
<p>and you would want to pass it back and forth</p>
<p>between your two hands.</p>
<p>The reason the passing back and forth is really important</p>
<p>is because, again, you don&rsquo;t want to be so cold</p>
<p>that you constrict those venous portals</p>
<p>that will allow cold to go into the body.</p>
<p>Now, there are certainly people</p>
<p>that are working on bike handles</p>
<p>and that can actually cool the hands.</p>
<p>You can expect with the Olympics coming up,</p>
<p>people are aware of these data</p>
<p>and are starting to incorporate it into a number of things.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>And there are sports teams</p>
<p>that I won&rsquo;t mention by name or brand</p>
<p>that have made this mistake and it costs them dearly.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to cool the core</p>
<p>if you want to cool the body, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a very hot day and you&rsquo;re going to train,</p>
<p>getting into an ice bath first,</p>
<p>sure, it will cool you down,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not going to be as effective</p>
<p>as cooling the palms, the bottoms of the feet, and the face.</p>
<p>I have a friend who does some important work in this space</p>
<p>with people in various, let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>cultures where heat is generated quite a lot</p>
<p>and they need to dump heat.</p>
<p>Ice packs delivered to the face</p>
<p>are something that they actually use</p>
<p>in order to dump heat quickly.</p>
<p>Now, again, you don&rsquo;t want to keep the ice pack</p>
<p>on your face.</p>
<p>These are people that are very high work output, right?</p>
<p>Firefighters and similar, at very high work output.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll put this,</p>
<p>essentially it&rsquo;s like a cool face mask on their face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll allow their core body temperature to come down</p>
<p>and then they remove it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not keeping it on there so long</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re getting the vasoconstriction.</p>
<p>Okay, so there are a number of ways that you could do this.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not giving specific temperatures</p>
<p>because it depends on how hot that day</p>
<p>and how hot your body temperature is.</p>
<p>So you can see why there&rsquo;s a need</p>
<p>to create more devices for this,</p>
<p>but you can see a considerable improvement</p>
<p>in endurance, in strength, and in all kinds of explosive</p>
<p>and sort of explosive power type output in athletics</p>
<p>by using these surfaces of the hands</p>
<p>and bottoms of the feet and face.</p>
<p>The one that I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>because in anticipation of this episode</p>
<p>was the dips where then I would cool my hands.</p>
<p>I actually decided to cool the bottoms of my feet as well</p>
<p>because it just feels good</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s particularly hot out lately.</p>
<p>So no shoes or socks on, put my feet into,</p>
<p>the bottoms of my feet just kind of hovering</p>
<p>about a centimeter or two below the surface</p>
<p>of a bucket of water that was just slightly,</p>
<p>it felt cool, slightly cooler than body temperature or so.</p>
<p>It just basically what came out of the spigot</p>
<p>after I let it run for a little bit.</p>
<p>And indeed I saw a 60% increase in the number of dips</p>
<p>that I can do in a single session.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually a quite significant effect</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to be perfectly precise</p>
<p>in order to do it.</p>
<p>And of course, if you want to heat up for whatever reason,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re camping or you&rsquo;re lost in the environment,</p>
<p>remember these three surfaces are going to be the best way</p>
<p>to heat your core as well.</p>
<p>So up until now, we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>how to use cold during a workout</p>
<p>in order to improve performance.</p>
<p>And indeed cold applied to the appropriate parts</p>
<p>of the body, the appropriate times,</p>
<p>can vastly improve our performance</p>
<p>in endurance and strength.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about the use of temperature,</p>
<p>in particular cold, to improve the speed</p>
<p>and the depth of recovery.</p>
<p>Recovery is obviously vital, right?</p>
<p>During a weight training session</p>
<p>or during an endurance session,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the stimulus for getting better the next time.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t recover,</p>
<p>you not only won&rsquo;t get better, but you&rsquo;ll get worse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interest in the use of cold</p>
<p>in order to improve recovery in the short term.</p>
<p>We see this and probably the best example of this</p>
<p>would be fighters in combat sports between rounds</p>
<p>or athletes in between quarters or halftime.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one form of recovery.</p>
<p>The ability to go back into the sport very soon</p>
<p>on an order of minutes, anywhere from like one minute</p>
<p>in between rounds in typical combat sports</p>
<p>or several minutes at a halftime, et cetera.</p>
<p>Typically what we see is people cooling their core,</p>
<p>cooling the back of their neck,</p>
<p>cooling the top of their head.</p>
<p>So it might be a sponge with cold water</p>
<p>over the top of the head</p>
<p>or an ice pack on the back of the neck,</p>
<p>or in some cases even wearing cold ice vests.</p>
<p>This has actually been done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be a very inefficient way</p>
<p>to improve recovery of that kind.</p>
<p>Far better would be to cool the face,</p>
<p>the palms of the hands or the bottoms of the feet</p>
<p>for the reasons that I described up until now.</p>
<p>Submerging the body in an ice bath or taking a cold shower,</p>
<p>say up to the neck or up to the chest</p>
<p>or getting under cold water or jumping in a cold lake</p>
<p>or something of that sort,</p>
<p>or in the locker room getting under the cold shower</p>
<p>also would be a terrible way to cool off the body quickly</p>
<p>compared to the ways that I described</p>
<p>through the palms of the hands,</p>
<p>the bottoms of the feet or the face</p>
<p>for the following reason.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s not optimizing those portals</p>
<p>of the face, palms, the hands and the feet.</p>
<p>And in addition, if it&rsquo;s very cold and you submerge</p>
<p>or you cover a lot of the body with that cold,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to cause constriction</p>
<p>of the very vessels and pathways</p>
<p>that allow the body to efficiently dump heat.</p>
<p>So again, the key thing is to cool these one or two</p>
<p>or three of these surfaces,</p>
<p>but not so cold that you cause the vasoconstriction.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you?</p>
<p>It means that getting in an ice bath or a cold shower</p>
<p>or putting an ice pack on the back of your neck</p>
<p>in most cases is not going to be as good</p>
<p>as splashing cold water on your face</p>
<p>or even just holding your face with a damp, cool cloth</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>It seems kind of counterintuitive.</p>
<p>You would think, oh, if I just jump into an ice bath,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to cool down much faster</p>
<p>than if I just cooled these one or two or three</p>
<p>of these select regions of the body,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually not the case.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&rsquo;s recovery that occurs</p>
<p>from session to session.</p>
<p>So outside of the game or the match</p>
<p>or the exercise session.</p>
<p>And many people are now relying on things like cryotherapy,</p>
<p>which requires a lot of expensive equipment,</p>
<p>big liquid nitrogen driven machine.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t so common for most people</p>
<p>or accessible for most people.</p>
<p>But a lot of people are using cold baths</p>
<p>or ice baths or cold showers.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s not going to optimize recovery.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s going to have an additional effect</p>
<p>that is going to potentially block the training stimulus.</p>
<p>When you get into an ice bath,</p>
<p>indeed there are, provided it&rsquo;s not very, very cold.</p>
<p>If you get into a cold shower,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not very, very cold,</p>
<p>you are indeed blocking some of the inflammation</p>
<p>that occurs because of the training session.</p>
<p>But in doing so, you also are blocking pathways</p>
<p>such as mTOR, mammalian targeted rapamycin,</p>
<p>which are involved in the adaptation</p>
<p>for a muscle to become stronger or bigger.</p>
<p>Put simply, covering the body in cold</p>
<p>or immersing the body in cold after training</p>
<p>can short circuit or prevent the hypertrophy</p>
<p>or muscle growth response.</p>
<p>It has other effects that can be positive, right?</p>
<p>It can induce thermogenesis, et cetera.</p>
<p>It can reduce inflammation,</p>
<p>but it can prevent some of the positive effects of exercise.</p>
<p>Now, it hasn&rsquo;t been examined so much for endurance work,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you come back from a round of endurance work,</p>
<p>a run or a bike or a swim,</p>
<p>getting into a cool bath or cooling the palms,</p>
<p>the bottoms of the feet or the face,</p>
<p>in my opinion, based on the science,</p>
<p>would be better than completely immersing the body</p>
<p>in the ice bath or the cold shower.</p>
<p>There is a time and a place for the use of the ice bath</p>
<p>or the cold shower or the cold plunge.</p>
<p>Those tend to be when you want to deliberately increase</p>
<p>brown fat thermogenesis,</p>
<p>or when you want to deliberately work on mental resilience.</p>
<p>And in a subsequent episode on fat loss,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about how to optimize the use of cold</p>
<p>specifically for increasing metabolism and fat loss.</p>
<p>But for now, since we&rsquo;re talking about the use of cold</p>
<p>for improving performance and recovery,</p>
<p>the suggestion that I&rsquo;m going to provide</p>
<p>is based on the work of Craig Heller and colleagues</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been talking about, as well as a excellent book.</p>
<p>I mainly rely on textbooks and special volume books,</p>
<p>which are collections of papers from experts</p>
<p>in a particular area that go beyond</p>
<p>standard kind of college level textbooks.</p>
<p>The one that I&rsquo;ve been relying on</p>
<p>is called Thermal Regulation in Human Performance,</p>
<p>Physiological and Biological Aspects by F.E. Marino.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the publisher.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the author.</p>
<p>I do recognize some of the names</p>
<p>of the particular papers there,</p>
<p>but I just want to be clear,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no sort of business relationship or deal with them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an excellent text.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Thermal Regulation in Human Performance.</p>
<p>You can find it online</p>
<p>if you want to go really deep into this.</p>
<p>But basically what they show is that</p>
<p>if you can cool the body back to its resting temperature,</p>
<p>by resting temperature, I mean,</p>
<p>within the range that you would see</p>
<p>at any time of waking day, but not in exercise.</p>
<p>So just bringing the body temperature down to baseline.</p>
<p>If you can do that,</p>
<p>the sooner you can do that after a workout,</p>
<p>the sooner that the muscle will recover,</p>
<p>that the tendons will recover,</p>
<p>and that the person, you,</p>
<p>can get back into more endurance training,</p>
<p>more weight training, et cetera.</p>
<p>So cold actually can be a very powerful tool for recovery,</p>
<p>but to maximize return to baseline levels of temperature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my belief based on the studies</p>
<p>that are published in this book,</p>
<p>as well as my discussions with my colleague, Craig Heller,</p>
<p>and in reviewing the literature overall,</p>
<p>that just simply cooling the entire body</p>
<p>by jumping into an ice bath or a cold shower</p>
<p>is not the best way to go.</p>
<p>You really want to rely</p>
<p>on one of these three glabrous skin portals</p>
<p>of the palms, the bottoms of the feet, or the face.</p>
<p>So now you probably know more than you ever wanted to know</p>
<p>about how we regulate body temperature</p>
<p>and how it can be applied to exercise,</p>
<p>both during the exercise session</p>
<p>and afterward to optimize recovery.</p>
<p>Many of us, all of us presumably,</p>
<p>are also eating and drinking things</p>
<p>and taking things at various times</p>
<p>that can impact this process.</p>
<p>And so because of that,</p>
<p>we should ask whether or not those things</p>
<p>are impacting body temperature.</p>
<p>And when we do that,</p>
<p>we find that there are certain things</p>
<p>that many of us are doing</p>
<p>that are actually impairing our performance.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you are taking a pre-workout drink</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re ingesting a lot of caffeine or other substance</p>
<p>to bring your body temperature up before exercise,</p>
<p>you are limiting the amount of exercise that you can do.</p>
<p>I can recall a time in college</p>
<p>when I would drink a lot of espresso.</p>
<p>Back then, ephedrine was sold over the counter.</p>
<p>I remember taking it.</p>
<p>It will really energize you for workouts.</p>
<p>You can generate a lot of energy</p>
<p>and get extremely focused taking those things.</p>
<p>They do increase heart rate.</p>
<p>They can be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend people take them.</p>
<p>In fact, I think ephedrine is now off the shelves</p>
<p>as a non-prescription compound</p>
<p>because various people died from taking it</p>
<p>who were sensitive to it or exercised in heat.</p>
<p>But looking back at that,</p>
<p>I realized it was a foolish approach.</p>
<p>It was increasing core thermogenesis.</p>
<p>Sure, I might&rsquo;ve burned a few more calories,</p>
<p>but actually when I look at the data</p>
<p>that are coming from specific cooling</p>
<p>and how that can so increase in performance</p>
<p>if done properly,</p>
<p>and then I compare that to the effects</p>
<p>of taking some sort of thermogenic compound,</p>
<p>whatever it is, some pre-workout or some pill</p>
<p>or high levels of caffeine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear that increasing body temperature</p>
<p>prior to working out is the exact wrong thing</p>
<p>that one would want to do.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to stay so cold</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t generate good muscle contractions.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be like I am coming out of the cold ocean</p>
<p>with claws for hands,</p>
<p>but one wants to have your body temperature</p>
<p>in a range that still allows you to work hard</p>
<p>and perform well.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of recovery,</p>
<p>things like alcohol, we know are vasodilators.</p>
<p>So those are going to cause people</p>
<p>to drop body temperature.</p>
<p>So you might think, oh, well,</p>
<p>that sounds great for recovery.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think people should be drinking</p>
<p>who have problems with alcohol intake,</p>
<p>alcoholics or they&rsquo;re not of drinking age, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a drinker,</p>
<p>but I do have a good friend</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a quite accomplished athlete</p>
<p>who basically drinks a beer or two after his long runs</p>
<p>or cycling and his argument is,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m dumping body heat and I like a beer.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s probably right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a really good tool</p>
<p>provided you don&rsquo;t have issues with alcohol</p>
<p>that would preclude that as a tool</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not of drinking age.</p>
<p>But anything that you ingest after exercise</p>
<p>that would increase body temperature</p>
<p>is going to impede recovery.</p>
<p>Anything that you do that lowers body temperature</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s in safe ranges</p>
<p>is going to accelerate recovery.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the whole host of compounds</p>
<p>that people take that can increase body temperature.</p>
<p>And many people are taking these things</p>
<p>in order to increase fat burning and increase metabolism.</p>
<p>But in my opinion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impeding their ability to perform well.</p>
<p>And especially if the performance</p>
<p>is something that you&rsquo;re focused on</p>
<p>aside from body recomposition, losing fat, building muscle.</p>
<p>But even if you&rsquo;re focused on losing fat, building muscle,</p>
<p>you have to ask yourself,</p>
<p>is the body temperature increase</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m getting from these compounds really worth it</p>
<p>given that it can block or prevent my performance</p>
<p>from being as good as it could?</p>
<p>In other words, is it worth taking something</p>
<p>that makes you feel very energized to go work out,</p>
<p>but then you now know that you are stopping earlier</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re performing less well,</p>
<p>fewer reps, fewer steps overall.</p>
<p>Is it worth it?</p>
<p>If you had not taken that thing,</p>
<p>then you could perform much longer</p>
<p>and at much higher capacity.</p>
<p>Some of you are probably saying, well, that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>because when I drink a quadruple espresso</p>
<p>and I pop a whatever pre-workout or drink a pre-workout,</p>
<p>then I know I can go much further.</p>
<p>Ah, that might be true,</p>
<p>but the increase in temperature</p>
<p>is also costing you on the recovery side.</p>
<p>And unless you&rsquo;re doing other things</p>
<p>to improve your recovery,</p>
<p>and I know many people that are, I don&rsquo;t judge,</p>
<p>but many people who are doing those things</p>
<p>are also augmenting their recovery</p>
<p>through hormone augmentation</p>
<p>and other performance enhancing tools.</p>
<p>Then for the typical person who&rsquo;s not doing that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably shooting yourself in the foot.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at what some of those compounds are</p>
<p>and what they do, and just briefly review</p>
<p>whether or not they would be a good or a bad idea</p>
<p>to include if your main goals are performance</p>
<p>or your main goals are body recomposition or both.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just briefly discuss stimulants.</p>
<p>This could be caffeine,</p>
<p>this could be any other kind of stimulant</p>
<p>that are typically in a pre-workout drink</p>
<p>or anything that might get you revved up before exercising.</p>
<p>This could even be very strong tea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned I&rsquo;m a big consumer of mate.</p>
<p>I like yerba mate, I love that stuff.</p>
<p>And I also drink caffeine.</p>
<p>I love coffee of various kinds, mushroom coffee,</p>
<p>black coffee, espresso, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a chronic caffeine user.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m an addict,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a chronic caffeine user,</p>
<p>meaning when I drink caffeine,</p>
<p>my heart rate doesn&rsquo;t increase so much</p>
<p>that it feels like a shock to my system.</p>
<p>Some people are not caffeine adapted</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re very caffeine sensitive.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the straightforward rule.</p>
<p>Caffeine for somebody who doesn&rsquo;t drink caffeine very much</p>
<p>will constrict the blood vessels</p>
<p>and will increase retention of body heat</p>
<p>and is probably a bad idea before exercise.</p>
<p>For somebody who&rsquo;s caffeine adapted</p>
<p>and is used to drinking caffeine,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t have that vasoconstriction effect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the data point to because I&rsquo;m adapted to it,</p>
<p>but it will cause vasodilation</p>
<p>and will allow me to dump body heat.</p>
<p>So for me, I use it before I train</p>
<p>or do any kind of exercise</p>
<p>because I tend to do that early in the day.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t prevent me from sleeping</p>
<p>and it causes vasodilation.</p>
<p>And then afterwards, I&rsquo;m aware that it causes</p>
<p>vasoconstriction after the caffeine wears off.</p>
<p>So for somebody who drinks two or three or more</p>
<p>cups of coffee a day or mate a day,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re talking intake of anywhere from 100</p>
<p>to 400 milligrams of caffeine,</p>
<p>what you want to do is you want to make sure</p>
<p>that you would do that before exercise</p>
<p>and probably not after exercise.</p>
<p>That just makes logical sense</p>
<p>given what we know about thermal regulation.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody who doesn&rsquo;t drink caffeine,</p>
<p>drinking caffeine before a workout</p>
<p>is going to be about the worst thing</p>
<p>that you could possibly do</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to increase core body temperature</p>
<p>through its thermogenic effects</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to constrict your blood vessels</p>
<p>and make it even harder to dump heat.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t suggest that people drink caffeine or not.</p>
<p>I just suggest that you think about</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re caffeine adapted or not</p>
<p>and decide whether or not you want to drink caffeine.</p>
<p>In general, you&rsquo;re going to be better</p>
<p>not drinking any caffeine than you are drinking caffeine</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re a heavy caffeine user or abuser,</p>
<p>in which case not drinking caffeine</p>
<p>is going to give you vicious headaches</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to make it very hard to get motivated</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just not used to it.</p>
<p>It takes about three weeks to get used to no caffeine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brutal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done caffeine fast.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I ever want to do it again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how painful it was.</p>
<p>But you get headaches</p>
<p>because of the effects on vasodilation and constriction.</p>
<p>If you like caffeine, use in moderate amounts</p>
<p>and use it before your workouts, not after.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like caffeine or you don&rsquo;t use it very often,</p>
<p>stay away from it anywhere close to exercise</p>
<p>before or after for that matter.</p>
<p>One of the more commonly used compounds</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sold over the counter</p>
<p>are non-steroid anti-inflammatories.</p>
<p>So things like Tylenol and Advil and other trade names</p>
<p>and naproxen sodium, things of that sort.</p>
<p>Almost all of those drop body temperature to some extent.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s often recommended</p>
<p>that people take them when they have a fever.</p>
<p>Although the whole business</p>
<p>of dropping body temperature artificially</p>
<p>when you have a fever is itself an interesting discussion,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s the most adaptive</p>
<p>or best thing to do.</p>
<p>Certainly you don&rsquo;t want fever to go too high.</p>
<p>It can be very dangerous, can kill you.</p>
<p>But artificially dropping body temperature</p>
<p>with these compounds can be tricky.</p>
<p>Now, a number of athletes, especially endurance athletes,</p>
<p>will rely on these non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>specifically to keep body temperature lower</p>
<p>during long bouts of exertion.</p>
<p>This is a little bit of a pharmacologic version</p>
<p>of dumping heat instead of using Palmer cooling</p>
<p>or face ice pack cooling.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re relying on pharmacology</p>
<p>to drop their core body temperature.</p>
<p>That has certain obvious advantages.</p>
<p>Those advantages should be obvious</p>
<p>and the reasons for them should be obvious</p>
<p>based on everything we&rsquo;ve talked about up until now.</p>
<p>Lower temperature allows you to go further harder</p>
<p>with more intensity.</p>
<p>However, they do have effects on the liver</p>
<p>and they can also have effects on the kidneys.</p>
<p>And during long bouts of exercise</p>
<p>or even short bouts of exercise,</p>
<p>water balance and salt balance are also going to be vital</p>
<p>to maintain in order to perform well,</p>
<p>generate the best muscle contraction,</p>
<p>stay mentally alert, and also to stay alive.</p>
<p>We will do an episode on salt electrolytes</p>
<p>and water and water balance,</p>
<p>but you probably want to think carefully</p>
<p>about whether or not you want to use</p>
<p>non-steroid anti-inflammatories before any training session</p>
<p>just for the performance augmentation effect,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re working carefully with a coach,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;ve done that in practices.</p>
<p>And of course, whether or not you are in a situation</p>
<p>where monitoring your body temperature carefully</p>
<p>is going to be important.</p>
<p>You might ask, well, when would that be?</p>
<p>Well, desert races, summer training and races, winter rides.</p>
<p>You certainly don&rsquo;t want to get too cool either.</p>
<p>So alcohol, caffeine,</p>
<p>and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,</p>
<p>because of their effects on temperature,</p>
<p>will impact performance and recovery,</p>
<p>but you want to be cautious about how you approach them.</p>
<p>I personally am more a fan of using caffeine</p>
<p>in moderate doses for the reasons I described before,</p>
<p>as well to use the cooling of the palms,</p>
<p>cooling of the bottoms of my feet, right,</p>
<p>by placing them into a bucket</p>
<p>or into a cool bath after training,</p>
<p>or cooling the face after training,</p>
<p>or sometimes even during training.</p>
<p>It just seems like there&rsquo;s more of a margin</p>
<p>to play with the variables,</p>
<p>to heat up the water, cool it down a little bit,</p>
<p>to include one palm or the other palm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just all sorts of good parameter space,</p>
<p>as we call it in science,</p>
<p>that you can play with and work with</p>
<p>to find what works for you.</p>
<p>Whereas when you pop a pill,</p>
<p>sure, you can adjust the dose</p>
<p>and you can adjust it next time,</p>
<p>but once it&rsquo;s in you, it&rsquo;s in you,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s going to be some period of time</p>
<p>before you can modulate it.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve offered today are ways</p>
<p>in which you can use temperature</p>
<p>to powerfully improve performance.</p>
<p>And if you think about it,</p>
<p>you can vary that from set to set.</p>
<p>You could do your pull-ups or your sprints</p>
<p>and then cool your palms,</p>
<p>and then try and go with colder water the next round,</p>
<p>or warmer water the next round,</p>
<p>or do both feet and palms and face.</p>
<p>I mean, you can do all sorts of things moment to moment</p>
<p>and see what works for you.</p>
<p>Again, essentially zero cost or no cost.</p>
<p>Whereas when you pop something,</p>
<p>you take a pill,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically in that regimen</p>
<p>for the next hour or two or more.</p>
<p>You can always take more,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t really take less.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really extract it from your body in real time.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t give you a lot of opportunity</p>
<p>to play scientist,</p>
<p>which is what I like to do,</p>
<p>because what I&rsquo;m always trying to do</p>
<p>is trying to dial in the best protocols possible</p>
<p>based on the mechanisms and data.</p>
<p>And if you can do that moment to moment,</p>
<p>that places you in a position of power.</p>
<p>Once again, we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of material.</p>
<p>By now, after seeing this episode</p>
<p>or listening to this episode,</p>
<p>you should understand a lot</p>
<p>about how your body heats and cools itself</p>
<p>and the value of that for physical performance.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll also appreciate</p>
<p>that you have tools at your disposal</p>
<p>to vastly improve your physical performance.</p>
<p>And should you try those,</p>
<p>please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>If you decide to do Palmer cooling during your runs</p>
<p>or after your runs,</p>
<p>during your weight workouts,</p>
<p>during your yoga sessions,</p>
<p>whatever it is, let us know.</p>
<p>Please place that in the comments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given you specific protocols and some direction,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve also left it slightly vague</p>
<p>because as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know all the environmental conditions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how hot your yoga studio is</p>
<p>or how cool your gym happens to be</p>
<p>or your body temperature or time of day.</p>
<p>Remember, your temperature will vary</p>
<p>according to the time of day.</p>
<p>We did a whole episode about that related to sleep.</p>
<p>Typically, your body temperature is rising early in the day</p>
<p>and is coming down as you approach the late evening</p>
<p>and late night hours for sleep.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night,</p>
<p>your temperature is very low,</p>
<p>at its absolute lowest,</p>
<p>something we call the temperature minimum.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know exactly where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>You need to take the information that you received today</p>
<p>and should you try and incorporate it,</p>
<p>try and do it intelligently.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t cool yourself off so much</p>
<p>that you become cryogenic</p>
<p>and please don&rsquo;t warm yourself up.</p>
<p>In fact, we didn&rsquo;t talk at all about warming yourself up</p>
<p>because warming yourself up too much</p>
<p>can be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>You never, ever, ever want to be hypothermic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what your body and your brain are trying to avoid.</p>
<p>We talked a little bit about supplements,</p>
<p>but not the standard sorts of supplements</p>
<p>I usually list off on these episodes.</p>
<p>Rather, we talked about caffeine,</p>
<p>non-steroid anti-inflammatories</p>
<p>and how those can impact temperature,</p>
<p>how alcohol can impact temperature.</p>
<p>And I should just mention in closing</p>
<p>that every time we eat, we also increase temperature.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a eating-induced thermogenic effect,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a minor one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a small one.</p>
<p>So you wouldn&rsquo;t worry about eating before training</p>
<p>because of its effects on temperature</p>
<p>because it tends to be really minor.</p>
<p>Going forward, we&rsquo;re going to talk more about temperature</p>
<p>and other ways to improve physical performance</p>
<p>and skill learning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about specific ways</p>
<p>to accelerate fat loss, to improve muscle growth,</p>
<p>to improve suppleness and flexibility.</p>
<p>These approaches and mechanisms are anchored deeply</p>
<p>in neuroscience and physiology</p>
<p>and the relationship between our peripheral organs,</p>
<p>which include our skin and our brain</p>
<p>and all the organs in between.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really a pleasure for me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m able to look to the textbook literature</p>
<p>that exists and really came out</p>
<p>over the last 50 to 100 years.</p>
<p>And unlike a lot of areas of neuroscience,</p>
<p>which are still sort of mystical,</p>
<p>like consciousness and dreaming,</p>
<p>of which we understand a little bit about,</p>
<p>these core mechanisms of temperature and physiology,</p>
<p>which are so powerful, involve very concrete studies</p>
<p>that, as you learned today, are very actionable.</p>
