bile salts because of the great importance of that organ which is typically considered an extra organ that you don&amp;rsquo;t need but the gallbladder is very very important it helps you store and concentrate bile salts now your liver makes bile and so do your friendly bacteria now about 95 to 97 of all the bile that you your body makes is recycled so bile is very very important and when you take bile salts as a supplement normally people take that with a meal they might take it just after they eat and it will usually help with bloating belching burping and nausea now the primary function of bile salts that most people know is the extraction of the fat soluble vitamins from the fat in your diet but there are many other benefits of using purified bowel salts and taking them on an empty stomach now i&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much purchased every single medical textbook on both the gall bladder and bile salt so it&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating topic i want to share with you the nine benefits of taking purified bile salts and for these benefits i&amp;rsquo;m going to discuss i would recommend taking purify bath salts on an empty stomach i would take one in the morning and one in the afternoon all right number one taking purified bile salts can help you reduce the risk of getting gallstones why because a gallstone is a super concentrated gallbladder crystal compound and bile salts help you prevent the formation of cholesterol crystals okay that&amp;rsquo;s number one number two it helps you extract the fat soluble vitamins vitamin a e d vitamin k and the omega-3 fatty acids and what it does to fat is it emulsifies the fat it breaks down the fat into these small particles which increase the surface area so the pancreas can release its enzyme called lipase which then does the rest of the dissolving of that fat particle so you can fully extract those nutrients from that food and so you need both bile and the enzyme from the pancreas to make this successful all right number three it can help you with constipation bile is kind of a lubricant it helps to lubricate the colon and so when you&amp;rsquo;re deficient in bile you can become constipated now if you have too much bile you can get diarrhea because it actually releases a lot of water in through the intestines specifically the large intestine so that&amp;rsquo;s why you need just the right amount number four bile helps you convert thyroid hormones t4 is the inactive version of the thyroid hormone and t3 is the active form you need bile to make this transition from t4 to t3 and this is why sometimes when people have their gallbladder removed and they become gallbladder deficient they may end up with a thyroid problem the simple solution is just to start taking purified bowel salts because that will help the thyroid greatly and one contraindication of taking purify bile salts is if you have too many thyroid hormones so if you have a hyperthyroid condition you never want to take bile salts because that&amp;rsquo;s going to increase more conversion and make things worse but for a hypo thyroid condition purified bile salts can help you greatly now number five is very interesting bile salts can act as a vdr agonist now what the heck does that mean vitamin d receptor agonist bile helps you trigger the receptor for vitamin d now this is very important in autoimmune diseases because the problem with autoimmune conditions is that you have this massive inflammation and vitamin d is the most important vitamin in dropping inflammation and if you have an autoimmune condition and you don&amp;rsquo;t have any inflammation you really don&amp;rsquo;t have hardly any symptoms from that condition and so bile can help you indirectly reduce inflammation in the body especially the liver all right number six bile salts can help you decrease pain in your body specifically in the right shoulder simply because if you have a congested gallbladder or there&amp;rsquo;s congestion between the liver and the ducts going to the gall bladder or the small intestine a lot of times this bile will form sludge because you&amp;rsquo;re missing bile and that congestion will back up the pipes and put pressure into the liver and cause pain in the right shoulder as well as trigger a nerve that goes from your diaphragm up to your neck called the phrenic nerve and cause right shoulder pain right trap pain up through here pain in the rhomboid muscle in the back part here it can also cause pain on the right side causing a headache on the right side of your head it can also cause pain and tightness underneath the right rib cage or in the stomach area or underneath the left ribcage and even pancreatitis because what can happen is this bile sludge can back up and now you have your bile salts which are detergents that are not moving properly and they&amp;rsquo;re stuck in the bile ducts in the liver and even in the pancreatic ducts and if it&amp;rsquo;s stagnant or doesn&amp;rsquo;t move that can create inflammation and so by taking purified bile salts that thins the sludge and allows things to drain through and the pain goes away and so a lot of the pain problems are coming from a deficiency of bile and as a side note let me just mention the reasons why you might be deficient in bile number one you have the gallbladder removed number two you&amp;rsquo;re on a low fat diet number three you&amp;rsquo;re taking too many omega-6 fatty acids as in soy oil canola cottonseed oil corn oil all these cooking vegetable oils that we consume are very very damaging to the liver and they can create a big problem if you&amp;rsquo;re consuming too much sugar refined grains or you have a spike in insulin that can decrease your bile if you&amp;rsquo;re estrogen dominant or you&amp;rsquo;re taking birth control pills and the estrogen spikes that can create a deficiency in bile if your liver is fatty or you have hepatitis or you have cirrhosis and there&amp;rsquo;s liver damage that can decrease the production of bile right there if you have high levels of cortisol or you&amp;rsquo;re taking prednisone which is a type of cortisol that can create a deficiency of bile soy protein isolates can greatly aggravate the gallbladder and the liver and cause a deficiency of bile having too many exotoxins let&amp;rsquo;s say for example you did a detox and you&amp;rsquo;re breaking up bacteria or virus particles and that&amp;rsquo;s releasing these endotoxins which by the way create the detox reactions that occur when you do a detox what happens to a lot of people is they get this stuck flow in the liver and the bile is not going to drain properly and so one of the things that i always recommend when you do a detox especially a liver detox is to first take purified bile salts get the drainage occurring first so you don&amp;rsquo;t get this backup of toxins in the liver which is very very uncomfortable another cause is malabsorption if you have gut damage you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be able to recycle bile since 95 97 of all the bile in your body is recycled if the end part of your small intestine is damaged or you have inflammation and you can&amp;rsquo;t recycle that you&amp;rsquo;re going to be deficient in bile and the last reason why you might be deficient in bile is you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough good bacteria all right let&amp;rsquo;s get back to the benefits number seven purify bio salts help reduce the risk of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth sibo why because bile is toxic to bacteria and one of the things that bile does as it&amp;rsquo;s released into the small intestine is it kills off all the bacteria in your small intestine and that way you prevent bacteria from growing in the wrong place and so bile travels all the way down through the small intestine kills off the bacteria make sure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t grow and then right at the last part it gets reabsorbed so most of the bile is reabsorbed into the liver and so very little bile enters the small intestine and this way we keep the bacteria in the right place the large intestine and if there&amp;rsquo;s a problem with this and some of that bile gets into the large intestine that&amp;rsquo;s when you have diarrhea all right number eight and i already mentioned this but bile greatly helps reduce inflammation in your liver it&amp;rsquo;s a paddle protective it protects the liver all right last one is this purified bile salts reduce the toxic load so the toxins that are filtered out to the liver need bile salts to help push them out through the small intestine and out through the large intestine and they also help regulate excessive amounts of cholesterol all right there you have it the nine benefits of taking purified bowel salts before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&amp;rsquo;s call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help'>

<p>﻿now as you may know i&rsquo;ve done a lot of videos 
on the gallbladder and bile salts because of the  </p>
<p>great importance of that organ which is typically 
considered an extra organ that you don&rsquo;t need but  </p>
<p>the gallbladder is very very important it 
helps you store and concentrate bile salts  </p>
<p>now your liver makes bile and so do your friendly 
bacteria now about 95 to 97 of all the bile that  </p>
<p>you your body makes is recycled so bile is very 
very important and when you take bile salts as a  </p>
<p>supplement normally people take that with a 
meal they might take it just after they eat  </p>
<p>and it will usually help with bloating belching 
burping and nausea now the primary function of  </p>
<p>bile salts that most people know is the 
extraction of the fat soluble vitamins  </p>
<p>from the fat in your diet but there are many 
other benefits of using purified bowel salts  </p>
<p>and taking them on an empty stomach now i&rsquo;ve 
pretty much purchased every single medical  </p>
<p>textbook on both the gall bladder and bile salt 
so it&rsquo;s a fascinating topic i want to share with  </p>
<p>you the nine benefits of taking purified bile 
salts and for these benefits i&rsquo;m going to discuss  </p>
<p>i would recommend taking purify bath salts on an 
empty stomach i would take one in the morning and  </p>
<p>one in the afternoon all right number one taking 
purified bile salts can help you reduce the risk  </p>
<p>of getting gallstones why because a gallstone is 
a super concentrated gallbladder crystal compound  </p>
<p>and bile salts help you prevent the formation 
of cholesterol crystals okay that&rsquo;s number one  </p>
<p>number two it helps you extract the fat soluble 
vitamins vitamin a e d vitamin k and the omega-3  </p>
<p>fatty acids and what it does to fat is it 
emulsifies the fat it breaks down the fat  </p>
<p>into these small particles which increase the 
surface area so the pancreas can release its  </p>
<p>enzyme called lipase which then does the rest 
of the dissolving of that fat particle so you  </p>
<p>can fully extract those nutrients from that food 
and so you need both bile and the enzyme from  </p>
<p>the pancreas to make this successful all right 
number three it can help you with constipation  </p>
<p>bile is kind of a lubricant it helps to lubricate 
the colon and so when you&rsquo;re deficient in bile you  </p>
<p>can become constipated now if you have too 
much bile you can get diarrhea because it  </p>
<p>actually releases a lot of water in through the 
intestines specifically the large intestine so  </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you need just the right amount number 
four bile helps you convert thyroid hormones t4  </p>
<p>is the inactive version of the thyroid hormone and 
t3 is the active form you need bile to make this  </p>
<p>transition from t4 to t3 and this is why sometimes 
when people have their gallbladder removed  </p>
<p>and they become gallbladder deficient they may 
end up with a thyroid problem the simple solution  </p>
<p>is just to start taking purified bowel salts 
because that will help the thyroid greatly and  </p>
<p>one contraindication of taking purify bile salts 
is if you have too many thyroid hormones so if you  </p>
<p>have a hyperthyroid condition you never want to 
take bile salts because that&rsquo;s going to increase  </p>
<p>more conversion and make things worse but 
for a hypo thyroid condition purified bile  </p>
<p>salts can help you greatly now number five is 
very interesting bile salts can act as a vdr  </p>
<p>agonist now what the heck does that mean 
vitamin d receptor agonist bile helps you  </p>
<p>trigger the receptor for vitamin d now this is 
very important in autoimmune diseases because  </p>
<p>the problem with autoimmune conditions is that 
you have this massive inflammation and vitamin  </p>
<p>d is the most important vitamin in dropping 
inflammation and if you have an autoimmune  </p>
<p>condition and you don&rsquo;t have any inflammation you 
really don&rsquo;t have hardly any symptoms from that  </p>
<p>condition and so bile can help you indirectly 
reduce inflammation in the body especially the  </p>
<p>liver all right number six bile salts can help 
you decrease pain in your body specifically in  </p>
<p>the right shoulder simply because if you have 
a congested gallbladder or there&rsquo;s congestion  </p>
<p>between the liver and the ducts going to the gall 
bladder or the small intestine a lot of times  </p>
<p>this bile will form sludge because you&rsquo;re missing 
bile and that congestion will back up the pipes  </p>
<p>and put pressure into the liver and cause pain in 
the right shoulder as well as trigger a nerve that  </p>
<p>goes from your diaphragm up to your neck called 
the phrenic nerve and cause right shoulder pain  </p>
<p>right trap pain up through here pain in the 
rhomboid muscle in the back part here it can also  </p>
<p>cause pain on the right side causing a headache on 
the right side of your head it can also cause pain  </p>
<p>and tightness underneath the right rib cage or in 
the stomach area or underneath the left ribcage  </p>
<p>and even pancreatitis because what can happen 
is this bile sludge can back up and now you have  </p>
<p>your bile salts which are detergents that 
are not moving properly and they&rsquo;re stuck  </p>
<p>in the bile ducts in the liver and even in the 
pancreatic ducts and if it&rsquo;s stagnant or doesn&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>move that can create inflammation and so by 
taking purified bile salts that thins the sludge  </p>
<p>and allows things to drain through and the 
pain goes away and so a lot of the pain  </p>
<p>problems are coming from a deficiency of bile and 
as a side note let me just mention the reasons  </p>
<p>why you might be deficient in bile number one you 
have the gallbladder removed number two you&rsquo;re on  </p>
<p>a low fat diet number three you&rsquo;re taking too 
many omega-6 fatty acids as in soy oil canola  </p>
<p>cottonseed oil corn oil all these cooking 
vegetable oils that we consume are very very  </p>
<p>damaging to the liver and they can create a big 
problem if you&rsquo;re consuming too much sugar refined  </p>
<p>grains or you have a spike in insulin that can 
decrease your bile if you&rsquo;re estrogen dominant  </p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re taking birth control pills and the 
estrogen spikes that can create a deficiency in  </p>
<p>bile if your liver is fatty or you have hepatitis 
or you have cirrhosis and there&rsquo;s liver damage  </p>
<p>that can decrease the production of bile right 
there if you have high levels of cortisol or  </p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking prednisone which is a type of 
cortisol that can create a deficiency of bile  </p>
<p>soy protein isolates can greatly aggravate the 
gallbladder and the liver and cause a deficiency  </p>
<p>of bile having too many exotoxins let&rsquo;s say for 
example you did a detox and you&rsquo;re breaking up  </p>
<p>bacteria or virus particles and that&rsquo;s releasing 
these endotoxins which by the way create the detox  </p>
<p>reactions that occur when you do a detox what 
happens to a lot of people is they get this stuck  </p>
<p>flow in the liver and the bile is not going to 
drain properly and so one of the things that i  </p>
<p>always recommend when you do a detox especially a 
liver detox is to first take purified bile salts  </p>
<p>get the drainage occurring first so you don&rsquo;t 
get this backup of toxins in the liver which  </p>
<p>is very very uncomfortable another cause 
is malabsorption if you have gut damage  </p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to recycle bile since 
95 97 of all the bile in your body is recycled  </p>
<p>if the end part of your small intestine is damaged 
or you have inflammation and you can&rsquo;t recycle  </p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to be deficient in bile and the 
last reason why you might be deficient in bile  </p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t have enough good bacteria all right 
let&rsquo;s get back to the benefits number seven purify  </p>
<p>bio salts help reduce the risk of small intestinal 
bacterial overgrowth sibo why because bile is  </p>
<p>toxic to bacteria and one of the things that bile 
does as it&rsquo;s released into the small intestine  </p>
<p>is it kills off all the bacteria in your small 
intestine and that way you prevent bacteria from  </p>
<p>growing in the wrong place and so bile travels 
all the way down through the small intestine  </p>
<p>kills off the bacteria make sure it doesn&rsquo;t grow 
and then right at the last part it gets reabsorbed  </p>
<p>so most of the bile is reabsorbed into the liver 
and so very little bile enters the small intestine  </p>
<p>and this way we keep the bacteria in the right 
place the large intestine and if there&rsquo;s a problem  </p>
<p>with this and some of that bile gets into the 
large intestine that&rsquo;s when you have diarrhea  </p>
<p>all right number eight and i already mentioned 
this but bile greatly helps reduce inflammation  </p>
<p>in your liver it&rsquo;s a paddle protective it 
protects the liver all right last one is this  </p>
<p>purified bile salts reduce the toxic load so 
the toxins that are filtered out to the liver  </p>
<p>need bile salts to help push them out through 
the small intestine and out through the large  </p>
<p>intestine and they also help regulate excessive 
amounts of cholesterol all right there you have  </p>
<p>it the nine benefits of taking purified bowel 
salts before you go if you have a question about  </p>
<p>a product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want to 
know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and you  </p>
<p>need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth i 
have a keto consultant standing by to help you  </p>
<p>this is just for the people in the US hopefully in 
the future we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p>
<p>but i put the number down below 
so you can call and get some help</p>
