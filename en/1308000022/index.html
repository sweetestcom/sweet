    <p>We&rsquo;re dropping what up?</p>
<p>The track I mean,</p>
<p>I am recording testing and testing my recording and here me</p>
<p>bet you know, but here we go in three two</p>
<p>your winners bride</p>
<p>raing man v insects</p>
<p>And it said we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you insects.</p>
<p>Queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the all in podcast.</p>
<p>Wet your beak.</p>
<p>Young Spielberg coming at you on a Friday morning afternoon.</p>
<p>Draft time.</p>
<p>The number 11 podcast in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the all in podcast with the queen of quinoa, David Friedberg.</p>
<p>Rain man himself with his hot new track from young Spielberg.</p>
<p>I am the rain man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>And of course, wetting his beak.</p>
<p>The.</p>
<p>Absolute dictator.</p>
<p>Wetting his beak with his merch.</p>
<p>Merch game is strong.</p>
<p>Chamath, Polly, Hoppa, Tia.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s everybody doing on the backs of us becoming the number 11 podcast in the world?</p>
<p>Really good.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Look at that enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Really great.</p>
<p>No, I think we had an intermittent.</p>
<p>Saksipu is not apparently, you know, with with all these with all his week beak wedding,</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t had time to pay the Internet bill.</p>
<p>You can go ahead and upgrade your DSL from from 56 kilobits.</p>
<p>I think you can afford it.</p>
<p>OK, he&rsquo;s hit his bandwidth limit because he was watching himself on Tucker over and over</p>
<p>again this morning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I do need to say this, that yesterday we do have firsthand evidence that David Sachs,</p>
<p>after appearing on Tucker Carlson, then spent the next hour watching himself appear on Tucker</p>
<p>Carlson.</p>
<p>Literally got up from the poker table.</p>
<p>My gosh.</p>
<p>Refused to play poker with his besties because he had to watch himself on less than six times</p>
<p>on Tucker.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>No, it must have been 20, 30 times.</p>
<p>No, no headphones.</p>
<p>Just listening to the iPhone, looking at it.</p>
<p>Holding it up to his ear just so he doesn&rsquo;t miss a word, optimizing his performance.</p>
<p>What was it like to go on Fox News?</p>
<p>Was this a dream for you, Sachs?</p>
<p>Is this a, is this a bucket list?</p>
<p>See, Jason, this is why you&rsquo;re such a scumbag.</p>
<p>Because I, I asked you guys, I said, hey, like Tucker shows invited me on.</p>
<p>Should I go?</p>
<p>You know, and, and you guys are like, yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;ll be great for ratings for the pod.</p>
<p>You should definitely do it.</p>
<p>And then after I do it, the first thing you guys say when I walk in the room is, oh my</p>
<p>God, you went on Tucker.</p>
<p>How right wing are you?</p>
<p>Do you realize that all your deal flow just got canceled?</p>
<p>Yum, yum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get all your deals now.</p>
<p>By the way, that was the funniest part.</p>
<p>Jason had premeditated basically getting you to appear on Tucker so as to impugn you and</p>
<p>destroy you.</p>
<p>Jake goes, oh, I&rsquo;m going to get all your deals now.</p>
<p>Yum, yum.</p>
<p>All is fair when it comes to early stage deal flow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then he starts tweeting, you know, he&rsquo;s like the first one to show a photo of me split</p>
<p>screen with Tucker.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I was waiting.</p>
<p>I was, I was literally watching it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for the great takedown.</p>
<p>Actually you did, in all seriousness, you did great.</p>
<p>Um, I think it was worth doing and he framed it as, I don&rsquo;t know if people saw it.</p>
<p>You can look up Tucker Carlson, Bestie, David Sachs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll come up number one.</p>
<p>And, um, he said you were, um, essentially taking a very liberal, classic liberal point</p>
<p>of view.</p>
<p>So he basically set the stage for you to not be a far right wing nut case.</p>
<p>You were actually defending liberal principles of people should have the ability to have</p>
<p>freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you talk about what it was like?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, so, so you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, he made the connection and the comparison to net, uh, Hentoff, who was like the famous</p>
<p>ACLU free speech lawyer.</p>
<p>And, uh, and I really appreciated that because I do very much see myself in that mold of,</p>
<p>uh, of somebody like Hentoff.</p>
<p>Um, he wrote a book called, uh, free speech for me, but not for the, um, sort of a famous</p>
<p>line, uh, because everybody wants free speech for themselves and their allies, but they</p>
<p>want to deny it to people they disagree with.</p>
<p>And, you know, they never seem to realize that censorship is a problem until it gets</p>
<p>turned against them.</p>
<p>And so, you know, the point I made about the, these Reddit kids who are censored is that</p>
<p>look, this, this was not what they, there was some raunchy speech in their message board.</p>
<p>Uh, we all know that, but it was no different than any trading floor trading pit or boiler</p>
<p>room on wall street.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same kind of language yet they were taken down and censored by discord for, for</p>
<p>hate speech.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they became very threatening to, you know, powerful insiders.</p>
<p>And, um, you know, but how many of those, those Reddit kids, uh, saw it as a problem</p>
<p>when, you know, Trump or his supporters got or parlor got de-platformed a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>they could never have imagined that that same censorship principle could ever get turned</p>
<p>against them.</p>
<p>And, um, and so we all have a blind spot towards censorship when we like the results.</p>
<p>And, you know, Hentoff&rsquo;s point is always, look, it&rsquo;s not about the results.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about who are you giving the power to, to, to censor to.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you have to be really careful of.</p>
<p>In relation to that, how delightful has it been to not have Trump on Twitter, putting</p>
<p>aside, you know, censorship, even for you as a Republican, a conservative, but liberal</p>
<p>socially, I will note, uh, you&rsquo;re very liberal socially.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re live and let live, uh, pro LBGTQ, of course.</p>
<p>Uh, and, but to not have Trump on Twitter has been all that cognitive space has come</p>
<p>back.</p>
<p>We get it all back.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Silence is, is, is bliss.</p>
<p>What did you guys think?</p>
<p>What did you guys think about, um, what is your name?</p>
<p>Marjorie blah, blah, blah, green, who just got completely censored.</p>
<p>What, what exactly happened?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Sax is that censorship.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a crazy loon who believes that was a false flag.</p>
<p>What do we do there?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not censorship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, she got censored, I guess.</p>
<p>Um, because her colleagues thought she was out of line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I mean, if her colleagues want to vote for that, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>So she can still say crazy stuff.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t do it and have this certain job.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look, let, let&rsquo;s face it when, when politicians say crazy stuff and it helps the</p>
<p>other side.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, Marjorie green or whatever, her censorship, who does that help?</p>
<p>It helps the Democrats.</p>
<p>Um, you know, quite frankly, uh, does Trump being off Twitter, uh, does that really help</p>
<p>Democrats?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I mean, um, you know, you could argue that, that Biden or, or that Trump is the one unifying</p>
<p>opposition to Trump is the one unifying force in the democratic coalition.</p>
<p>So the, the, the more Trump is out there, the, the more it bonds the democratic coalition</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>Um, so yeah, I mean, censorship has this way of like backfiring and, uh, you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>look at it in terms of narrow, short-term political results.</p>
<p>Speaking of censorship, I want to get your take on something else.</p>
<p>I think these last two weeks have been a complete sea change in venture capital.</p>
<p>And let me give you the setup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of a sudden seemed like, um, there has been a decision that&rsquo;s been made where</p>
<p>the ecosystem of companies will basically use their own platforms and their own mediums</p>
<p>to completely control the narrative and the dissemination of information about them.</p>
<p>That the media in the effort of company building, um, may have taken a big step back.</p>
<p>Um, you know, I think, uh, the whole sort of like thing on clubhouse was really interesting.</p>
<p>I think, uh, this guy who just joined Andreessen Horowitz, um, who actually hosts a show on</p>
<p>clubhouse is really interesting.</p>
<p>Um, I think there&rsquo;s some like really interesting emerging managers who just have these incredibly</p>
<p>different ways of showing around his name.</p>
<p>Um, he&rsquo;s been hosting good times at 11, 10 or 11 PM every night on clubhouse.</p>
<p>Mark Andreessen comes to it every night.</p>
<p>And of course, Elon came interviewed Vlad.</p>
<p>And then last night Zuckerberg showed up, uh, in order to get the blueprints for clubhouse</p>
<p>to then put it into Instagram and Facebook.</p>
<p>But what do you guys, what do you guys think of sort of like this entire sector of the</p>
<p>economy basically trying to, I guess, organize an end around traditional media?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s just venture, right?</p>
<p>I mean, look at, look at Trump.</p>
<p>You know, he avoided having the traditional press conference as the, the, the channel</p>
<p>for dissemination of his point of view and communication of his, uh, objectives.</p>
<p>And he went on Twitter every day and he just tweeted.</p>
<p>Um, and I think, you know, anyone who&rsquo;s been part of a business or an operation that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>had to deal with, you know, media gathering facts that, uh, that you don&rsquo;t consider to</p>
<p>be true and you can&rsquo;t really counter their point and then they publish and it&rsquo;s static</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>Um, you are frustrated and in the, in the world that we have today, which has many alternatives</p>
<p>for going direct to our customer and going direct to our audience through social media</p>
<p>and having control over that message.</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s appealing to make the switch away from traditional PR and going to social.</p>
<p>I mean, Chamath, you don&rsquo;t put out press releases.</p>
<p>You go on Twitter and you make a statement about what your intentions are and you publish</p>
<p>your one pagers.</p>
<p>And I feel like everyone&rsquo;s trying to do this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all this like trend at big companies now too, which is how do you develop a quote</p>
<p>unquote social media presence?</p>
<p>You can speak directly to your audience and your customers without having to go through</p>
<p>the press.</p>
<p>I find it very hard, um, to get the point across, um, by going through traditional media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that, it&rsquo;s not that it can&rsquo;t be done, but I find it harder and harder.</p>
<p>And the reason is because they&rsquo;re in such a ferocious competition with social media.</p>
<p>And so they have to be just as click oriented and newsworthy, um, as the next best tweet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s trending at that time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s an almost impossible task.</p>
<p>Well, Naval, Naval had a great line about this, which I think he tweeted a long time</p>
<p>ago, which is that the internet commoditized the reporting of facts.</p>
<p>And so at that point, the, the traditional media went wholesale into opinions, into opinions.</p>
<p>And so now they all have an agenda of some kind.</p>
<p>And especially the tech press, their agenda basically is hatred of tech.</p>
<p>I mean, they hate the people they&rsquo;re reporting on.</p>
<p>I mean, Jake, how you know this, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, having been a journalist in this, I, it&rsquo;s really interesting to hear your opinions.</p>
<p>And if you look at trust among, uh, Republicans, all time low, uh, in the press and then just</p>
<p>all Americans don&rsquo;t trust the press right now, they think there&rsquo;s hidden agendas and</p>
<p>it really is a confluence of events.</p>
<p>What happened was the internet caused, um, the revenue streams of the press to get just</p>
<p>violently compressed or eliminated.</p>
<p>So, you know, you had Craigslist take the classified business, Google and Facebook took</p>
<p>the ad business and subscriptions, Netflix, Spotify, et cetera.</p>
<p>So you have all that revenue is gone.</p>
<p>And what that meant was they, uh, didn&rsquo;t have the resources to do fact checking.</p>
<p>And then the publishing schedule because of blogging, which I was involved in required</p>
<p>that people file two, three, four times a day just to keep up.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re filing even just twice a day, there is no time to get quotes from</p>
<p>the subjects.</p>
<p>So we have all, as people who are subjects had quotes, uh, attributed to us that were</p>
<p>like, where did you pull that quote from?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Oh, three years ago you said this or whatever.</p>
<p>And then you don&rsquo;t even know you&rsquo;re going to be in the story.</p>
<p>Like the hit piece they did on you, Chamath, some sports writer and SF gate did some hit</p>
<p>piece on Chamath.</p>
<p>Did they ever call you?</p>
<p>Did they ever say, would you like to respond to this?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it used to work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you, that&rsquo;s what you learn when you get a degree in journalism, right?</p>
<p>You call the subject you interview.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And it used to be you filed once every two weeks, or maybe if you were in a weekly news,</p>
<p>a news, like a news week or a business week, you filed once a week.</p>
<p>Magazines you filed once or twice per episode per issue, or maybe once every other issue</p>
<p>or feature writer.</p>
<p>Now they have to, they have to publish so much.</p>
<p>By the way, Jason, you said something.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do any fact checking.</p>
<p>You said something really, really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the craziest thing where these guys will not even call you and say, here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re running, or here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to say.</p>
<p>Do you want to work through this with us?</p>
<p>Do you want to tell us, are there any inaccuracies?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really seeking the truth.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s really seeking the truth.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re seeking clicks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The, your salary is now determined by your number of followers on Twitter, as is your</p>
<p>book deal.</p>
<p>And your substack then becomes your negotiating position versus your existing publication.</p>
<p>So someone like Kara Swishers, who is not full-time at the New York Times, probably</p>
<p>makes a half million or a million dollars a year doing her podcast with them in the</p>
<p>editorial page.</p>
<p>I would say somewhere between 500K and a million.</p>
<p>All the other writers there are looking at other people who&rsquo;ve gotten significant followings</p>
<p>and saying, I have to get a big following.</p>
<p>How do you get a big following?</p>
<p>Well, Sax figured that out.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t, didn&rsquo;t have a huge following on Twitter in the last couple of months, but</p>
<p>since we did the podcast, Sax started having an opinion and picking a side and really owning</p>
<p>his opinion.</p>
<p>And what happened?</p>
<p>Massive engagement.</p>
<p>But in fairness, and also being super, and super intelligent and thoughtful about it.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>But anybody picking a side gets rewarded.</p>
<p>And if you go down the middle, you don&rsquo;t get rewarded.</p>
<p>Because people go, that makes sense.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not outraged.</p>
<p>But then I think that people, then people should just be using facts as a jumping off</p>
<p>point, as opposed to like weaving it into the narrative so that other folks get confused.</p>
<p>Meaning, you know, it used to be the case that a newspaper has an opinion page.</p>
<p>Well, no, now the whole newspaper is opinions.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Because the facts you can just get from the AP, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no point calling the New York Times to figure out what the hell is going</p>
<p>on in the world.</p>
<p>Really what they should be doing is deep analysis.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like that New York Times article that you brought up a couple of weeks ago, Chamath,</p>
<p>that we talked about on the pod was about the trust fund kids who are giving away all</p>
<p>their money.</p>
<p>You know, it wasn&rsquo;t an analysis of how many people with this amount of wealth are giving</p>
<p>away their money.</p>
<p>It was anecdotes to make the case that this is the storyline that they kind of wanted</p>
<p>to progress.</p>
<p>And, you know, that is, I think, where you&rsquo;re able to kind of stay within the bounds of</p>
<p>traditional journalism, but still, you know, get a narrative across that is a bit sensational</p>
<p>and it is a bit kind of, you know, inspiring.</p>
<p>And Friedberg, all you need to do, having been on the inside of these discussions is</p>
<p>when you have one person, it&rsquo;s a profile, as an example.</p>
<p>When you have two, it&rsquo;s still a kind of a profile with an example.</p>
<p>But once you get to three, you got a trend piece.</p>
<p>And so what your editors say to you is, if you can get me a third person who&rsquo;s a trust</p>
<p>fund kid, now we got a trend piece and we&rsquo;re in the clear.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do that and do the anecdotes instead of actual research, which then takes time</p>
<p>and resources.</p>
<p>And if you look what Andreessen Horowitz has specifically done with Clubhouse is, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really freaked out some New York Times reporters, I won&rsquo;t say which ones, because every time</p>
<p>I mentioned this one reporter, she pulls the female reporter card and she pulled it last</p>
<p>night where she said, I&rsquo;m a female reporter, I can block Mark Andreessen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say who it is because she gets really upset.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Taylor Lawrence.</p>
<p>But she, I mean, she, yeah, she tweeted it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s hiding from it.</p>
<p>She does it to me.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t want to bring up her name.</p>
<p>She put it in the public.</p>
<p>Because now bringing up her name, she will, I guarantee you, tweet, I am being harassed</p>
<p>by Jason Calacanis because I&rsquo;m a woman.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s saying that Mark Andreessen and Andreessen Horowitz blocked her from their Clubhouse</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re blocked from a Clubhouse room, you don&rsquo;t get access.</p>
<p>So she said, I&rsquo;m going to make my own shadow account.</p>
<p>She did make a puppet account.</p>
<p>Now she&rsquo;s listening in.</p>
<p>And she got upset at me because I told people in a room, hey, there&rsquo;s a New York Times</p>
<p>reporter in the room.</p>
<p>Just be careful because this could wind up in print.</p>
<p>She called that harassment and gender-based harassment.</p>
<p>And the thing they&rsquo;re complaining about now is that all of us are trying to go around</p>
<p>them and just tell our stories directly.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re all enraged.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying, how dare Mark Andreessen or A16Z not talk to us?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, why should they?</p>
<p>I mean, my experience with the press has been that about 75% of the time when they ask me</p>
<p>for comment on something, it ends up being a hit piece.</p>
<p>Maybe not on me, but on something I care about.</p>
<p>And they twist what you say or take one little quote out of context to support the article.</p>
<p>And you end up giving credence to an article that you completely disagree with.</p>
<p>And so all of us have to stop taking those calls.</p>
<p>I mean, we just know.</p>
<p>We just know there&rsquo;s such an agenda behind most of these calls that we just don&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>them anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going direct.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say one thing about Taylor Lawrence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot because I feel like being 44, I&rsquo;m kind of out of the know.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve learned a lot because she has her finger on the pulse.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s been really fun reading her stuff.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;ll say is on the Andreessen thing, I think what they have finally stumbled</p>
<p>into, I remember when Andreessen started about a year before I started Social Capital.</p>
<p>And I remember the whole push was multi-services, right?</p>
<p>And they were going to be recruiting and sales and this and that.</p>
<p>I suspect that all of that was kind of like pretty meager ROI and not that it just burned</p>
<p>a ton of fees.</p>
<p>But I think this thing that they&rsquo;re doing is really smart because if they effectively</p>
<p>build their own distribution arm through newsletters, substack, podcasts, clubhouse shows, whatever,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a force to be reckoned with because then if you&rsquo;re a venture investor, you either</p>
<p>have to be like them with their own version, in which case the brand of Andreessen really</p>
<p>matters, or you&rsquo;re on this path of where the trend of venture is already going, which is</p>
<p>solo GPs and individual people are the brands.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to be very little space in the middle.</p>
<p>So, for example, I do think that the All In podcast helps, for example, David in Craft</p>
<p>or Jason Yu in Launch.</p>
<p>Oh, the syndicate is going crazy.</p>
<p>And you guys also stand alone as individuals.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re a traditional firm, pick your organization, which neither has brands nor</p>
<p>has distribution.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re probably forced to just pay the highest price.</p>
<p>And so those returns for those folks in the middle get really bad, I think, over time.</p>
<p>And you at some point have to decide, are you an individual person?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like some amazing up and coming GPs.</p>
<p>We know them, Lockheed Groom, folks like that.</p>
<p>Or are you Andreessen Horowitz with this massive distribution?</p>
<p>I mean, and now we have to just, I think, face the reality that we are in competition.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what is making the press even more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes the situation more complicated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying the press is targeting people they consider competitive, but the press is</p>
<p>not getting Vlad, Elon or Zuck for interviews.</p>
<p>But because Marc Andreessen has, you know, Clubhouse now, they put themselves on the</p>
<p>suggested follower list, just like Twitter put Om, Kara Swisher and some other journalists</p>
<p>on the suggested follower list for Twitter.</p>
<p>What that was, was it was payment, basically, like a million followers.</p>
<p>Now Andreessen has a million followers, Balaji, all these folks from Andreessen, I believe,</p>
<p>have like a million followers.</p>
<p>So the press is complaining about that as well, because they can then dominate them</p>
<p>in terms of getting subjects.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve lost the subjects.</p>
<p>None of us get on the phone with the press, with very few exceptions.</p>
<p>And where is Sway or Vox or Ezra Klein when compared to our podcast?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re right up there with them, if not ahead of them.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re the number one tech podcast.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty crazy when you think about how much their world has changed.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re directly in competition with Andreessen Horowitz, all in podcast, you know,</p>
<p>pick the firm doing a venture thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to make this even more contentious, I predict.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I totally agree with that.</p>
<p>But I also, I do think fundamentally that all of us wouldn&rsquo;t have felt the same need</p>
<p>to go around them if we didn&rsquo;t feel that there was such a strong agenda.</p>
<p>Just to bring what, have you guys heard of gel man amnesia effect?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Michael Crichton, you know, who wrote Dress Park and like a true polymath and genius,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Airframe, very good, by the way.</p>
<p>I mean, so many brilliant things.</p>
<p>He was even a Hollywood director, true multi-talented guy.</p>
<p>Anyway, he described the gel man amnesia effect as follows.</p>
<p>He says, you open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well.</p>
<p>So in this case, it was a physics paper on gel man.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, I do know this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He says, you read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding</p>
<p>of either the facts or the issues.</p>
<p>The error in the article is so wrong.</p>
<p>It actually presents the story backwards, reversing cause and effect.</p>
<p>I call these the wet streets cause rain stories.</p>
<p>The paper is full of them.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story,</p>
<p>but then you turn the page to some other section, to national international affairs, and you</p>
<p>read the rest of the paper as if it was somehow more accurate.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>You turn the page and forget what you know, which is that the journalist gets so much</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, and all of us kind of suffer from gel man amnesia sometimes because</p>
<p>we still, I think, take, when we read something in the paper, we take it at face value.</p>
<p>And I think, but we all know that when it comes to tech reporting or whatever, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much misinformation that gets put out by these official channels.</p>
<p>And I think at the end of the day, what&rsquo;s happening now with these and run around the</p>
<p>traditional media, it&rsquo;s all a response to gel man amnesia.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a problem of complexity.</p>
<p>You know, I, I remember years ago I would, when I was younger, I would read the paper</p>
<p>or read magazines about science and engineering.</p>
<p>And I was, you know, really interested in these topics.</p>
<p>And it was only years later when I actually realized how wrong so many of those articles</p>
<p>were as I started to read the original scientific research papers.</p>
<p>But it takes a skillset and it takes a significant amount more time to really go into depth into</p>
<p>those papers and to actually read them.</p>
<p>The same is true, as you point out with like, you know, geopolitical issues, like the complexity</p>
<p>of what goes on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I learned when I was a journalist, we would have about 10 to 20% of the information</p>
<p>about what occurred when we&rsquo;ve published our first story.</p>
<p>And then maybe every subsequent follow up, we get another 10%, which means if we were</p>
<p>really hooked into a story, and we did five versions of that story, we might get to 40%,</p>
<p>50% understanding.</p>
<p>Whereas when the four of us are doing a deal, and then you see this impact, you know, the</p>
<p>press is getting it completely wrong.</p>
<p>And that was fine.</p>
<p>If you felt the press was fair, right.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening is now there, there&rsquo;s a distinct feeling with subjects that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being treated unfairly.</p>
<p>And when I do, when somebody connects to me, and they say, Hey, can you comment on Robin</p>
<p>or whatever?</p>
<p>I said, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I do have a great story for you about a world positive startup.</p>
<p>And I kept doing this with Teddy, who kept asking me to give information on friends of</p>
<p>mine, you know, the guy from Rico to whatever, who covers like philanthropy.</p>
<p>And every time they contact me, I say, Yeah, you know, I can&rsquo;t comment on that.</p>
<p>But you can talk to the founder.</p>
<p>But I have three world positive stories.</p>
<p>Are you interested in any of them?</p>
<p>And I just do that kind of to troll them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve never in five years taken me up on profiling a world positive.</p>
<p>So if the press wants to turn this around, a very simple solution is one for you, one</p>
<p>of your hate stories.</p>
<p>So if you for every time you want to take down a company, maybe write about one company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing something good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some company doing something in carbon sequestering right now, that is super valid</p>
<p>and world positive, write about it.</p>
<p>And the only time they write about Tesla is when Elon trips or, you know, something, somebody</p>
<p>dies in a car, or they write about Uber, because of some tragedy.</p>
<p>Sorry, I just want to say, like, Jason, like, just going back a second, like, your point</p>
<p>is one about bias, which is, you know, creating sensationalism, sell stories, it&rsquo;s what consumers</p>
<p>want to consume, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certainly, you know, a market driven model there.</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make earlier, there&rsquo;s also a separate problem around complexity,</p>
<p>which is complex issues take time and take depth to truly understand.</p>
<p>And so to really understand what&rsquo;s going on in the Middle East, or what&rsquo;s going on inside</p>
<p>of a company like Facebook requires more than a five paragraph journal article, it</p>
<p>requires some hours of conversation and dialogue.</p>
<p>And I think, by the way, the craving for that depth, which delivers truth and understanding</p>
<p>is what, you know, podcasts can provide and Clubhouse is providing long form content that</p>
<p>allows you to go into the nuance and into the texture and into the depth of what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on in the world, as opposed to having the five paragraph littered with ads, BuzzFeed</p>
<p>article that says something sensational, but it simplifies something to the point that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often wrong, or completely misses the real depth of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s like, and I think that I think they&rsquo;re both they&rsquo;re both they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>both kind of playing into each other.</p>
<p>And then I want to give a prediction.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both what you&rsquo;re describing are both issues.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re related in the following sense that if you were to go to like any of</p>
<p>these reporters, like the people that J. Cal mentioned a couple of names, okay, if you</p>
<p>were to filter their bylines, and see all of their not not one story, but look at like,</p>
<p>all of the headlines for all their stories over, say, the past year, you will definitely</p>
<p>see a trend, they will, they will all have, you know, like negative.</p>
<p>For certain reporters, it&rsquo;ll be 100% negative about tech 0%.</p>
<p>I mean, Aaron Griffin, I think is the reporter who&rsquo;s one of the top tech reporters at the</p>
<p>New York Times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, Coinbase, Coinbase away.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So when&rsquo;s the last time they wrote a positive story.</p>
<p>So there is this huge agenda there.</p>
<p>And, and I think it prevents people from getting into the complexity, because it&rsquo;s a lot easier</p>
<p>to write, you know, that</p>
<p>prediction, and I&rsquo;m gonna make a bold prediction here, the media companies are gonna, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re obviously picking a side, they obviously went subscription, now they&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>Substack, Clubhouse, podcasts, all chipping away.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s going to happen is, you&rsquo;re going to see media brands built around certain</p>
<p>podcasts, and they&rsquo;re going to work subject first.</p>
<p>In other words, the subject of the story are going to create media property.</p>
<p>So if you look at what we&rsquo;ve done with all in, and obviously, I have this week in startups,</p>
<p>if we did the Friedberg on science podcast, and it was just Friedberg explaining a science</p>
<p>topic.</p>
<p>And then we did Chamath on public markets.</p>
<p>And then we did Sachs on, you know, alt-right conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>And we just had five pods.</p>
<p>Or it could be something else.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, guns.</p>
<p>You know, whatever, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Pro-life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what Sachs is into, but you know.</p>
<p>But no, Sachs could do something on SAS.</p>
<p>So Sachs on SAS, Friedberg on science, Chamath on thirst traps.</p>
<p>Then we have all in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s five, five full pods of an hour and a half each.</p>
<p>If each of you did your own pod, and I have my pod, and we made the all in network, the</p>
<p>all in news network, I guarantee you we would be within five years, you know, right up there</p>
<p>with CNN and MSNBC.</p>
<p>Well, one thing that Jason and I have been toying with now is I really do want to start</p>
<p>a Twitch channel.</p>
<p>And I think part of why is I&rsquo;d like to really actually have more conversations about, you</p>
<p>know, companies and stocks and.</p>
<p>With youth.</p>
<p>With the youth.</p>
<p>Yeah, with the youth and like, you know, really get into the details.</p>
<p>And like also when we, you know, partner with a company, bring them on the show so that</p>
<p>we can spend an hour or two and talk about things in detail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally lost.</p>
<p>And the crazy thing that I realized for me is near to your point, Jason, like, you know,</p>
<p>we have enough distribution now where millions of people can see it.</p>
<p>And if that has real impact, because, you know, you can allow people to judge.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not necessarily saying we&rsquo;re better or worse than anybody else.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re not using it for the express purpose of selling ads necessarily and getting</p>
<p>paid, I do think there&rsquo;s a better likelihood that it&rsquo;s that the outcome is better.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, a big part of the success of this has been the banning of guests and the</p>
<p>banning of banning of ads and banning of ads.</p>
<p>People really have responded to that.</p>
<p>And I think if we put the Twitch channel up and we just throw in all and throw in this</p>
<p>week in startups, and then, you know, a sacks, you know, point counterpoint show, and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>being sincere, Friedberg, just Friedberg on science.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s five shows.</p>
<p>And we just say every Friday, there&rsquo;s going to be five shows like this is your weekend</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to loop it and there&rsquo;ll be a Q&amp;A, I guarantee you, we could get five</p>
<p>other besties to do shows, you know, and we would</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you guys originally like, so for the audience that doesn&rsquo;t know this, originally</p>
<p>the all in podcast was Chamath and Jason, they were talking about doing a show together.</p>
<p>And then COVID hit.</p>
<p>And they, I think you guys asked me on the pod zero to talk about COVID stuff.</p>
<p>But what was the original goal you guys had, you know, Chamath, isn&rsquo;t that what you wanted</p>
<p>to do originally was to have kind of a direct audience and a direct conversation about,</p>
<p>you know, whatever it is you wanted to talk about, where you could have this kind of long</p>
<p>form dialogue.</p>
<p>You know, what did you guys, why did you guys want to do it in the first place?</p>
<p>I mean, wasn&rsquo;t that kind of the idea?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what, what sort of like my general viewpoint is, which is that, like, we are</p>
<p>atomizing our affinity.</p>
<p>So I think that like, we&rsquo;ve gone from believing in institutions.</p>
<p>And now I think we fundamentally mistrust institutions.</p>
<p>Then we spent 30 or 40 years believing in companies.</p>
<p>And now I think we basically don&rsquo;t believe in companies anymore.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re sort of at the at the at the bleeding edge of what where belief and trust</p>
<p>exists, which is at an individual person level, ownership, ownership.</p>
<p>So so like, you know, I and I think that when an individual has the potential to not just</p>
<p>be about something for themselves, but also for themes that other people care about, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you get real heat.</p>
<p>And obviously, the most impressive example of that is Elon, because, you know, he represents</p>
<p>exploration, engineering, science, climate change, you know, memes, all of this stuff.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>I think the other things are really what matters.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And so and so what it shows people is like, I just want to find affinity around a few</p>
<p>key people.</p>
<p>And what he is, is not the end state.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the beginning of the beginning.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going to happen is all of us will say, I don&rsquo;t trust institutions.</p>
<p>So whatever they put out is just going to be corpo.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust companies, what they say is going to be corpo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take my best shot at finding folks that I think are real.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just going to get that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I wanted to do this with Jason.</p>
<p>And then with the four of us, I think what happened almost accidentally is, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a real plurality of views.</p>
<p>And, and you don&rsquo;t have to agree with all of us.</p>
<p>And frankly, no, nobody does.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t generally agree 100%.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re another much smaller than Elon, but another example of, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to want to find your own truth tellers, folks that you will get behind.</p>
<p>And I think that business people, that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re going to emerge.</p>
<p>Because if you look at that first generation of star, Kim Kardashian, the Kanye West of</p>
<p>the world, that&rsquo;s arcing.</p>
<p>Then people went to like the Mr. Beasts and that&rsquo;s still building.</p>
<p>So you have the business celebrity building, you have sort of next generation celebrity</p>
<p>building.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>Let me just ask you guys one question, because I think the intention with journalists was</p>
<p>kind of to be arbiters of the truth or discover as a fact and to deliver that fact to their</p>
<p>audience.</p>
<p>And when you have this direct relationship between the source and the audience, as you</p>
<p>do through social media and Twitter and whatnot, there isn&rsquo;t an arbiter, there isn&rsquo;t a third</p>
<p>party.</p>
<p>And everything that then is said by the source is taken at face value.</p>
<p>How does that play out in a world where, you know, Trump may say things like, hey, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>election fraud when the facts don&rsquo;t line up.</p>
<p>And now you have this ability to not have an arbiter.</p>
<p>And these people, anyone that now has a direct relationship with a large audience can say</p>
<p>anything they want and kind of drive large change without those things necessarily being</p>
<p>rooted in some, you know, relative kind of objective sense.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a marketplace of ideas and everybody&rsquo;s competing.</p>
<p>And the answer to bad speech or bad ideas is more speech and better ideas.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s the reality is it is very frustrating to see, you know, people propagating</p>
<p>things that aren&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>However, none of us has a monopoly on the truth.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t say for sure what it is.</p>
<p>And so, we arrive at the truth through sort of a free marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>There is no better solution than that.</p>
<p>You know, there is no magical way to entrust a small elite of people with, you know, the</p>
<p>right to censor and tell us what the truth is without essentially, you know, creating</p>
<p>a worse situation.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s the fundamental problem.</p>
<p>So, yeah, look, we&rsquo;re going to we&rsquo;re going to this era in which there is no, you know,</p>
<p>if you go back like 50 years ago, you had Walter Cronkite saying and that&rsquo;s the way</p>
<p>it is.</p>
<p>Everyone believed him.</p>
<p>And then the New York Times was the paper of record.</p>
<p>And people believe that.</p>
<p>All the news that&rsquo;s fit to print.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>And so, but that&rsquo;s been steadily eroding for decades.</p>
<p>And now the internet is the final erosion of that.</p>
<p>And look, I think it&rsquo;s not a bad thing because in order for journalism to work, you need</p>
<p>all the journalists to buy into a certain code of journalistic behavior and ethics,</p>
<p>which is all about objectivity.</p>
<p>And the press doesn&rsquo;t buy into that anymore.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t believe in objectivity anymore.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And especially I&rsquo;ll tell you something, Sachs, young writers, I found when we were trying</p>
<p>to hire young writers for Inside, as an example, they all wanted to write anti-Trump, you know,</p>
<p>pro-woke, whatever.</p>
<p>They had some ax to grind.</p>
<p>And I said, you know, you should really write for an opinion page, but you haven&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>any journalism yet.</p>
<p>So you should probably do journalism for 10 years.</p>
<p>And then the second decade, you earn the right to be on the opinion page.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put in some reps.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do 10 years of this.</p>
<p>And, you know, it just never actually happened.</p>
<p>Wait, do you guys hear something?</p>
<p>Have you guys seen that movie from Duff Till Dawn?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that moment where the movie just suddenly the scene changes and everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Is somebody at the&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bestie line.</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s calling the bestie phone.</p>
<p>Did you give the bestie phone number to somebody, Chamath?</p>
<p>Oh my God, is somebody&hellip;</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>You up?</p>
<p>You up?</p>
<p>You up?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Is anybody there?</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Draymond Green in the house.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up, bestie guestie?</p>
<p>Bestie guestie.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on, besties?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up, bestie?</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>Are you in a coronavirus, COVID, quarantine, somewhere in an NBA bubble?</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in Dallas stuck in a hotel with bad water pressure.</p>
<p>Oh, the worst.</p>
<p>That is the thing.</p>
<p>If you had to give me the most luxurious hotel in the world, but with a faucet for water</p>
<p>pressure, no thanks.</p>
<p>I would rather sleep in a box with a great shower.</p>
<p>The water pressure is everything.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, obviously drafted by the Golden State Warriors in the second round, 35th overall</p>
<p>in the 2020 NBA draft, three-time NBA champion, 2016-17 Defensive Player of the Year, two-time</p>
<p>NBA All-Star, five-time All-Defense, and drafted behind Michael Kidd, Gilchrist, Deion Waters,</p>
<p>Harrison Barnes, Tyler Zeller, Miles Plumby, and I don&rsquo;t know how many people got drafted</p>
<p>ahead of you, Draymond, but I know that you can repeat them in order.</p>
<p>Is there anybody who&rsquo;s drafted ahead of you who has achieved even a fraction of what you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>achieved in the NBA, Draymond?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 34 guys drafted ahead of me, and I definitely can still name all of them.</p>
<p>And saying that, I think there are a few.</p>
<p>Anthony Davis.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done okay.</p>
<p>He got one ring.</p>
<p>Damian Lillard.</p>
<p>No rings.</p>
<p>But a stud, though.</p>
<p>A stud.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very good player, but no rings, I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>And Bradley Beal.</p>
<p>Bradley Beal.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Also no rings.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, I got all the guys in the rings category, but then I don&rsquo;t have Patrick McCall in the</p>
<p>rings category.</p>
<p>Patrick McCall has the same amount of rings as me, so.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Respect to those guys I named, although they don&rsquo;t have the rings, I got major respect</p>
<p>for those guys.</p>
<p>We were thinking about what to talk to you about coming on the pod, and we have a series</p>
<p>of questions just about being an NBA player, and what you&rsquo;ve learned, and how good you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>become.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start it off with one question, which is, it seems like every year you get a little</p>
<p>better at something.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>Do you say, over the summer, I&rsquo;m just going to be better at my screens, I&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>better at X, Y, or Z?</p>
<p>Or do you just try to get incrementally better all year long?</p>
<p>I mean, you always want to try to get better all year long, but the reality is, with this</p>
<p>season, with the way, not just this season in particular, in the NBA season in general,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have much time to get better.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of just getting better on the fly.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re in your workouts during the season, you&rsquo;re just trying to maintain because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s such little prep time.</p>
<p>But during the offseason, you really lock in on a couple of things and try to get better</p>
<p>at those things.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think I&rsquo;ve become a much better ball handler.</p>
<p>I think I see the floor much better.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve gotten better overall as a player.</p>
<p>And one area that I&rsquo;ve wanted to see more growth in is my shooting.</p>
<p>And you know, when I&rsquo;m shooting the basketball on my own, I know for sure I&rsquo;ve gotten better</p>
<p>at shooting.</p>
<p>Like, you know, you come in the gym with me, I shoot the lights out every time.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s about getting over that mental block in the game.</p>
<p>You know, I think that&rsquo;s the thing people don&rsquo;t realize is, you know, I shot the lights</p>
<p>out for years in a row.</p>
<p>And I had a year where I think I shot 39% from three.</p>
<p>But then you go through the struggle, and once you lose it mentally, it&rsquo;s hard to get</p>
<p>it back.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m fighting that challenge now, although I know I can make the shot, it&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>get in the game mentally, got to get over that hurdle.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>You do like meditation?</p>
<p>Or do you have like a coach who does like positive visualizations or something like</p>
<p>that?</p>
<p>Or is it just reps and working through a shooting slump?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve definitely incorporated some meditation on the Calm app.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Did you give him options?</p>
<p>You moron.</p>
<p>You have to disclose that shit.</p>
<p>On the All In podcast, you have to disclose if you have options.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m shipping the shares right now.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have any knowledge yet.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>No shares yet.</p>
<p>Hey, Draymond, are other players in the NBA struggling right now?</p>
<p>I mean, with like COVID over the last year and the shutdown and the fits and starts and</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>I mean, is it kind of tough to get in the game mentally for folks?</p>
<p>And is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brutal.</p>
<p>Yeah, brutal.</p>
<p>You know, you talk to guys who are like, you know, I don&rsquo;t want to be in the NBA.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be in the NBA.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be in the NBA.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be in the NBA.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m talking about one superstar in particular who I&rsquo;ve never seen him out of shape.</p>
<p>I think right now everybody&rsquo;s talking about Luke.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s so out of shape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not Luke or James Hart.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve never seen this guy to shape.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s out of shape right now.</p>
<p>And I asked him, we explained that he&rsquo;s like, man, the bubble, like, oh, it&rsquo;s just been</p>
<p>hard.</p>
<p>And I completely understand that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s brutal.</p>
<p>And this season currently, I don&rsquo;t want to sound like just this overprivileged guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>complaining about being able to make a living because there&rsquo;s so many people who&rsquo;s lost</p>
<p>their jobs.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t take being able to go to work for granted at all.</p>
<p>But this season has been extremely tough, you know, whereas an NBA day normally is like</p>
<p>maybe four to six hours, like every day right now, it&rsquo;s like 10 to 12 hours.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s COVID testing you for 11 a.m. practice.</p>
<p>We have to be at the facility at 845 a.m.</p>
<p>And then you have to be back at this facility to test no later than five in between four</p>
<p>and five.</p>
<p>And so you kind of have these long, drawn out days and about maybe two hours of that</p>
<p>is actual work time, you know, and then you&rsquo;re just trying to do some recovery things to</p>
<p>kill time.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t leave the hotel, you know, for myself.</p>
<p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve always found in the NBA season is it&rsquo;s a ton of pressure, obviously.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very, very demanding, like you can&rsquo;t really do much else.</p>
<p>As you guys know, I&rsquo;m always trying to coordinate with y&rsquo;all about playing poker around the</p>
<p>schedule.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really do anything else.</p>
<p>But one place that I found is normally I&rsquo;ll take like a day trip to Aspen, you know, or</p>
<p>do different things like that, a day trip to L.A. to kind of clear your mind and get</p>
<p>a release.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have those releases now, you can&rsquo;t take a day trip, you can&rsquo;t get away.</p>
<p>Even on off days, you have to go to the facility and test.</p>
<p>And so even just seeing that facility that day, although you may not even go in to work</p>
<p>out, but you drive into that facility every day, mentally, it&rsquo;s exhausting.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been a very tough season, to say the least.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of guys are struggling with it and saying that, you know, we all</p>
<p>want to continue to earn our living, so you just have to do what you have to do.</p>
<p>It must be better to be playing versus being stuck at home with the league shut down, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s got to be better.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s better for all of us, obviously.</p>
<p>You know, from an economical standpoint, we all want to continue to make money, you know,</p>
<p>and provide for our families.</p>
<p>We all want to continue to take this league to new heights.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always better for us to be on the court than off.</p>
<p>But that comes with certain challenges, and you just got to deal with those challenges</p>
<p>and try to continue to press forward.</p>
<p>Day Day, before you came on, we were talking about the media.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about how all these industries used to rely on the media to tell their story.</p>
<p>And now all these industries are finding ways to go around them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s even happening in venture capital, right?</p>
<p>In the business of sports, I found this thing that I thought was really interesting.</p>
<p>Ronaldo signed a $1 billion lifetime contract, right?</p>
<p>I think this is like two, three years insane.</p>
<p>But then it turned out that in one year, he generated $474 million of value for Nike just</p>
<p>through social media, because of the number of followers he had, which I think is just</p>
<p>absolutely nuts.</p>
<p>What do you think about the media?</p>
<p>What do you think about your ability to tell your version of the facts through the media?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve definitely grown in that area, as you said, in all businesses, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basketball, whether it&rsquo;s venture, just all over the board.</p>
<p>Everyone has grown in that area and kind of start taking the bull by the horns and try</p>
<p>to tell their own narrative.</p>
<p>If you want me to be quite frank with you, I hate the media.</p>
<p>So does Sachs.</p>
<p>In saying that, I could possibly be a part of that group one day, but I hate the media.</p>
<p>And the reason I hate the media is I don&rsquo;t hate particular people.</p>
<p>I have relationships with a ton of people in media, great people.</p>
<p>I hate what media entails in today&rsquo;s day and age.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about who can stir up the most commotion.</p>
<p>What happened with this guy?</p>
<p>What happened with that guy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less about, man, this guy is struggling on the floor and more about James Harden was</p>
<p>in the club.</p>
<p>You know, so how much controversy can we stir up about James Harden being in the club, as</p>
<p>opposed to if we really wanted to talk bad about James Harden when he was on Houston</p>
<p>Rockets, he was bumming it.</p>
<p>Now, we all know James Harden isn&rsquo;t a bum player, but he was completely dogging it with</p>
<p>the Houston Rockets.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s completely turned it up and turned back into James Harden as he&rsquo;s gotten to the Knicks.</p>
<p>But you can easily, if you want to nitpick at James Harden, talk about James Harden not</p>
<p>playing well.</p>
<p>But in turn, we&rsquo;re going to talk about James Harden being in the club that night and he</p>
<p>was at Lil Baby&rsquo;s birthday party.</p>
<p>And although, you know, I disagree with some of the things he was doing, why is that all</p>
<p>that matters?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about clicks and selling ad dollars against that.</p>
<p>We were just talking about that before you got on.</p>
<p>Look at what happened to Kyrie.</p>
<p>In the span of literally a week, Kyrie had both sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>One was he violates the shelter in place or whatever, and was like at a birthday party</p>
<p>with his family, and then he gets suspended.</p>
<p>And on the other side, Kyrie had bought a house for George Floyd&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, both are true, but you have to go through these two news cycles where</p>
<p>first he&rsquo;s just a piece of shit, and then he&rsquo;s this amazing philanthropist.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get the point.</p>
<p>And like Freeberg just said, it&rsquo;s all about clicks.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s short lived, you know, at some point everyone&rsquo;s going to get tired</p>
<p>of your clickbait.</p>
<p>And so, yes, it may drive you revenue right now.</p>
<p>It may, you know, bring more subscribers right now.</p>
<p>But in the long term, people are going to get sick of that.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, authenticity always wins out.</p>
<p>When you create great products, when you give everything great to whatever business that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving, that&rsquo;s always going to outlive the bullshit.</p>
<p>And so you got, and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re starting to see so much turnover with media people</p>
<p>and leaving this job and going to this place and leaving another place, because people</p>
<p>get sick of that shit.</p>
<p>And so I feel like all of these guys are driving themselves out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re constantly, you&rsquo;re killing your relationships with players.</p>
<p>And when I say players, I&rsquo;m not just talking about NBA players.</p>
<p>You guys are the players in the venture space.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the players in the basketball space.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re killing your relationships with the players.</p>
<p>So eventually you&rsquo;re just going to be stuck there tweeting out bullshit, making bullshit</p>
<p>articles that no one will co-sign to, and then no one wants to fucking hear you anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Oh boy, looks like we got our bestie in rotation now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to get clipped.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little rant, a little Draymond rant.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Your first bestie rant, Draymond.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all had our moments.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all had our rants.</p>
<p>Draymond, have you watched or listened to any of this podcast before?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I have a question actually.</p>
<p>So yeah, and I&rsquo;m not sure if the viewers know, because from Jason&rsquo;s introduction,</p>
<p>that we actually play poker with you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I got to know you.</p>
<p>And obviously, it&rsquo;s been a real thrill, because you&rsquo;re a great guy, and it&rsquo;s also really</p>
<p>interesting to get a window into your world.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m curious, what do you get out of hanging out with us, these losers and pariahs?</p>
<p>And then maybe use that as a segue to also talk about what you&rsquo;re doing in business these</p>
<p>days, because I think that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>What I get from hanging out with you guys is, number one, incredible friends.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been the most important thing for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just building friendships that will go far beyond any of you guys doing any deals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll go far beyond me doing any deals or me playing basketball.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing that I cherish the most.</p>
<p>Obviously, it started with Best DC bringing me into the poker game and introducing me</p>
<p>to everyone.</p>
<p>And then all of you guys welcoming me with open arms.</p>
<p>And I always say in our group chats, anytime that there&rsquo;s a debate going on, I make sure</p>
<p>to throw my disclaimer out there.</p>
<p>Hey, I can&rsquo;t talk anything with you guys.</p>
<p>I know everyone can talk circles around me.</p>
<p>But this is how I feel on said topic.</p>
<p>Tell us about the temperature in America.</p>
<p>The temperature in America is fucked up.</p>
<p>And I think where we are today as a country, it&rsquo;s no different than where we were 30 years</p>
<p>ago, 40 years ago.</p>
<p>We just live in a day and age of social media where we can see everything.</p>
<p>And so the same battle cry that Dr. King was crying 50 years ago, it&rsquo;s still currently</p>
<p>going on today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same exact thing, or 60 years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same exact things that&rsquo;s taking place today.</p>
<p>And our country is in one of the most fucked up spaces it&rsquo;s ever been in.</p>
<p>And in saying that, it&rsquo;s in just about the same place that it&rsquo;s always been in.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve super coded shit for so long that it seems now like, oh, police killings</p>
<p>are at an all time high of shooting unarmed people.</p>
<p>Racism is at an all time high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an all time high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same that it&rsquo;s been.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just being pushed to the forefront now, as opposed to it being on the back burner</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just kind of where we are as a country.</p>
<p>You think sentiment&rsquo;s going to shift, Draymond?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the protests that happened in this country over the last year obviously</p>
<p>happened during COVID, and I think it magnified them a lot more than similar protests that</p>
<p>have taken place historically.</p>
<p>But are we seeing sentiment shift in the United States in terms of policy and people&rsquo;s behaviors</p>
<p>and attitudes right now?</p>
<p>I think some people&rsquo;s behavior, but I don&rsquo;t think anything is going to shift.</p>
<p>And partly because we live in a fake ass world where no one can say anything.</p>
<p>You say anything, you get castrated for it.</p>
<p>I think in telling your truth, which in order to create the change that we need in America,</p>
<p>people have to be able to speak the truth.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t speak the truth without getting fucking destroyed and a part of the bullshit</p>
<p>cancel culture that we all have to deal with, then how can you ever create change through a lie?</p>
<p>Lies is what we&rsquo;ve been facing for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>But yet, when you get in front of a microphone, you have to be very conscious of what you say,</p>
<p>because it may piss this group of people off, or it may piss that group of people off.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re never allowed to tell the fucking truth.</p>
<p>So how will we ever move forward as a country if no one can tell the truth and you only get</p>
<p>canceled?</p>
<p>So you cancel who tells the truth, and we fucking push forward all the lies,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll never move anywhere as a country.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going anywhere.</p>
<p>Seems like in the NBA, we went from the player saying,</p>
<p>listen, I don&rsquo;t want to touch that.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan was very clear in the last dance, like, I&rsquo;m an athlete.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to talk about politics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to lose half the audience.</p>
<p>And then you had Mellow and LeBron and a bunch of folks.</p>
<p>Chris Paul, I guess, was in that group too.</p>
<p>Dwayne Wade, when they came out and said, hey, listen, we got to talk about this.</p>
<p>And we got to talk about race in America.</p>
<p>And then that culminated with the Black Lives Matter branding of everything in the bubble</p>
<p>and that kind of historic moment.</p>
<p>What was the vibe inside of the NBA when the player said, listen, this is important to us.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re going to get back on the court, we need to make this front and center.</p>
<p>This is our priority.</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s face it.</p>
<p>You got a lot of owners in the league, maybe who are old white guys.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t want to bring this kind of heat.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want this kind of debate.</p>
<p>They want to just play ball, shut up and dribble, all this nonsense.</p>
<p>What was that moment like when you guys said, no,</p>
<p>this is what we have to do if we&rsquo;re going to get back on the court?</p>
<p>I think guys have just had enough.</p>
<p>And most importantly, I think now more than ever,</p>
<p>guys truly understand the power of the athlete.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Closing the loop on what we just said.</p>
<p>We control the narrative.</p>
<p>You control the narrative.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re just kind of in a space where we understand this ship don&rsquo;t sail without us.</p>
<p>And the things that matter to us has to matter to the league now.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And saying that, I think we have a commissioner that supports everything we stand for.</p>
<p>And when you have a commissioner like Adam Silver,</p>
<p>who is in full support of everything that the players stand for,</p>
<p>is never trying to fight us, is never trying to put a muzzle on us</p>
<p>and tell us not to stand up for what we believe in, that&rsquo;s a very powerful thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the NBA is the most powerful sports league in the world,</p>
<p>because we have a commissioner who&rsquo;s on board and who not only supports</p>
<p>what the players think and what we believe in, but he takes it even a step further.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>You see the NFL tell guys you have to stay or stay in the locker room.</p>
<p>Adam Silver don&rsquo;t do that to us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s always friction between their commissioner and their players.</p>
<p>David, what did you think about the storm the Capitol when you were watching that?</p>
<p>What was going through your mind?</p>
<p>We see the two different sides of America.</p>
<p>The first thing that went through my mind was,</p>
<p>I wonder if that was a Black Lives Matter protest</p>
<p>or Black Lives Matter protests or stormed in the Capitol,</p>
<p>how much of a bloodbath it would have been.</p>
<p>It would have been one of the biggest bloodbaths in American history.</p>
<p>And so immediately when I saw it, the first thing I thought of was like,</p>
<p>wow, how is this even happening?</p>
<p>And let alone it not happening, no one.</p>
<p>And by the way, I don&rsquo;t wish death on anyone.</p>
<p>But I know that if those were melanated people</p>
<p>storming into the Capitol building, it would have been bloodshed everywhere.</p>
<p>They would have unloaded facts.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And so it just kind of really, once again, just revealed how there&rsquo;s two sides of America.</p>
<p>And as I said before, until we tell the truth about it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll still we&rsquo;ll continue to live in a day and age where there&rsquo;ll be two sides of America.</p>
<p>Draymond, when COVID first started and we went into lockdown and we were all texting</p>
<p>with each other talking about how crazy the world had become, one of the things that stuck</p>
<p>with me and still sticks with me is the comments you made over our text chain about how it feels</p>
<p>like you felt growing up.</p>
<p>Can you just explain what you meant by that and just share that with our audience that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>listening?</p>
<p>Because it was such a striking comment.</p>
<p>We were all like, oh my gosh, I can&rsquo;t go outside.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t go to the store.</p>
<p>This world is crazy.</p>
<p>And you were like, this is what it was like.</p>
<p>And it was just such a striking, maybe you can just share a little bit about what you</p>
<p>meant by that.</p>
<p>Because I think it paints a little bit of a picture, you know, for folks to understand</p>
<p>a little bit about, you know, kind of, you know, what America can be like and what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like growing up in parts of the US.</p>
<p>Well, number one, I want to point out that I told all of y&rsquo;all the first day we went</p>
<p>into lockdown, we all should go to Cabo and no one listened to me.</p>
<p>It was a good call.</p>
<p>It was a good call.</p>
<p>You were right.</p>
<p>We should all go to Cabo.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, but when I said that in the group chat, what I said, what I said in the group chat</p>
<p>was, honestly, I was in my condo in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I live in a high rise, great view of the Bay Bridge, great view of the water.</p>
<p>You see all of San Francisco, South San Francisco, everywhere.</p>
<p>And I said to the group chat after a few weeks of lockdown, I said this, you know, guys,</p>
<p>I have to be quite frank with you.</p>
<p>This feels no different than me growing up in Saginaw, Michigan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that, I said, this feels no different than me growing up in Saginaw,</p>
<p>Michigan.</p>
<p>The only difference is I know where my I know where my next meal is coming from, you know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m in a much better place living space than I was.</p>
<p>But this was no different.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re unlocked in.</p>
<p>I can go anywhere.</p>
<p>That was me growing up in Saginaw, Michigan, locked in, couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere, didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that there was a world that existed outside of Saginaw, Michigan, and basketball was able</p>
<p>to take me different places.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t know anything existed and nothing seemed accessible to a young black kid growing</p>
<p>up in Saginaw, Michigan.</p>
<p>So once I was once I was then locked in the house along with everyone else in the world,</p>
<p>it just took me back to a space of, wow, nothing else is accessible to me.</p>
<p>This was exactly what it was when I was growing up as a 10 year old.</p>
<p>Like, nothing was accessible to us.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have anything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how and so when we went into lockdown, like, I felt right at home.</p>
<p>I felt like the kid growing up in Saginaw again.</p>
<p>Nothing was accessible to me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s such a poignant point, Draymond, because so many people don&rsquo;t, you know, people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that experience.</p>
<p>But hearing you say that it provides perspective that there are people living that today.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just about a COVID lockdown, but it&rsquo;s about a different world that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get to see.</p>
<p>So I really appreciated you sharing that.</p>
<p>It honestly was very poignant and kind of struck a nerve with me when you said it.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think, you know, one thing, another thing I said in the chat, and I am included, we</p>
<p>all got a chance to see what it felt like to be those people.</p>
<p>Obviously, I lived that life growing up.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;re removed from it, you&rsquo;re removed from it, right?</p>
<p>Like, I, you know, you try not to never forget.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s be frank, you know, Chamath, you grew up with nothing coming from India</p>
<p>and Sri Lanka and going to Canada.</p>
<p>You had nothing.</p>
<p>You understand.</p>
<p>And, you know, we all understand from a different perspective, but there are still people currently</p>
<p>that live that live that life today.</p>
<p>Can I tell you all of us a glimpse of what those people go through on a daily basis?</p>
<p>The one the one thing about this pandemic is that I&rsquo;ve had these moments day where like</p>
<p>I actually now am a little bit more connected to my past.</p>
<p>I did this.</p>
<p>I did this podcast with this guy, Patrick O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, and he ends every podcast and</p>
<p>he says, you know, what is the kindest thing that somebody somebody has done to you and</p>
<p>I had pushed this memory down into the fucking recesses of my mind, except in this last year,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve remembered all these kindnesses because I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve now I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve these are the moments</p>
<p>where I felt the most insecure and I and I told the story about this kid who, you know,</p>
<p>when I was like 11 or 12, he was eight.</p>
<p>So he was in my sister&rsquo;s class and their family gave us a mattress, two mattresses and some</p>
<p>clothes, you know, some plates and like a frying pan and a pot literally when we got</p>
<p>refugee status.</p>
<p>And when I said it on the thing, I started bawling and then I kind of collected myself</p>
<p>and then getting a little verklempt even hearing you talk about it, man.</p>
<p>Well, and the next the next morning, Nat said, how did it go?</p>
<p>And I told her and I exploded and I was crying and crying and crying and crying.</p>
<p>And to your point, like it is so easy to forget where you come from, but it&rsquo;s also easy to</p>
<p>forget that there&rsquo;s a simple fucking externality.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a virus you can&rsquo;t see that gets trans and it makes us all the</p>
<p>same in one fell swoop in one nanosecond.</p>
<p>And if that doesn&rsquo;t make you sort of like empathetic to everybody, not nothing will.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s one silver lining in this whole fucking debacle is it&rsquo;s an opportunity for</p>
<p>for a lot of folks to reconnect with their own self, you know, and be a better person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something you paused on, Draymond, during the pandemic when you weren&rsquo;t playing</p>
<p>and you guys obviously with the injuries and everything, you weren&rsquo;t in the bubble.</p>
<p>So you had a lot of time to be with yourself.</p>
<p>Did you have any like during this great pause, you know, I don&rsquo;t know, revelations about</p>
<p>yourself, your career and what you want to do in the second half of your career?</p>
<p>Because let&rsquo;s be honest, I mean, the run the Warriors has had has been transcendent.</p>
<p>I mean, you guys have checked off every box.</p>
<p>You personally have checked off every box, especially for a guy who was drafted in the</p>
<p>second round to be a champion.</p>
<p>And like the way you&rsquo;ve developed and the leadership.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody in the league knows when you&rsquo;re on the court, that&rsquo;s the team.</p>
<p>And you have that leadership, the ability to see the floor and direct the offense, direct</p>
<p>the defense.</p>
<p>Did you come up with anything where you said this is what I want out of the future of my</p>
<p>life?</p>
<p>Because we saw you dabble with, you know, TNT and the desk and you killed it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen you mic&rsquo;d up.</p>
<p>We see you coaching now.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a 2.0 drama on like, maybe a little evolution here of you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about maybe the third act and the second half of your NBA career on the court.</p>
<p>You know, I had a lot of time to really sit and reflect.</p>
<p>You know, I grew a lot in my personal relationships, which I think was important.</p>
<p>You know, and I think I also grew up grew a lot as as a business professional as well.</p>
<p>And speaking of, you know, the TNT stuff, that was, I think, you know, we&rsquo;ve kind of</p>
<p>always or I&rsquo;ve kind of always heard, like, man, when you when you finish playing, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have a great career in TV.</p>
<p>But the reality is, you know, we&rsquo;ve seen some players, you know, that were really good players</p>
<p>get up there and not be very, you know, be very good sitting at the desk or, you know,</p>
<p>color commentating the game.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not as easy as most people think it is.</p>
<p>People think just because you play basketball, A, that, you know, basketball, and then B,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to help, you&rsquo;re going to be able to translate or help give everyone</p>
<p>else an understanding of what exactly it is that you see.</p>
<p>And so getting up there and actually being able to do it.</p>
<p>And then the reception that I got, which was people, you know, in my mind, I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>said, I want to be Tony Romo of the NBA.</p>
<p>Tony Romo is one of my favorite people to watch do color commentary because he makes</p>
<p>it very simple for you to understand.</p>
<p>He tell you, Tony Romo sit there and call the plays out that a team is about to run</p>
<p>just by seeing the formation.</p>
<p>And they do exactly what he said they&rsquo;re about to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most incredible thing.</p>
<p>And in speaking of which we were talking about earlier, which was the media.</p>
<p>One of the things that pissed me off most about the game of basketball today is I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>turn on a sports talk show and actually learn about basketball.</p>
<p>And that fucking pisses me off.</p>
<p>All I can turn on a talk show about is they&rsquo;re about bullshit.</p>
<p>But the reality is we have so many people talking and speaking about the game of basketball</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t know shit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t turn on the TV and learn.</p>
<p>And so the one thing I&rsquo;ll say I want to bring to that world is I want to be able to teach</p>
<p>the game of basketball.</p>
<p>And then for people to then contact me once I was sitting up there at the desk and inside</p>
<p>on inside the NBA and doing all of these different things to contact me and say, the way you</p>
<p>break the game down makes it so easy to understand.</p>
<p>That was a huge win for me.</p>
<p>And it gave me a lot of hope to want to succeed more in that area.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll say something different, which is what I see is just an incredibly beautiful</p>
<p>human being, because you&rsquo;re able to humanize that, but then you can go and speak on these</p>
<p>other things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what we need more of, because all of a sudden now it&rsquo;s very hard to put</p>
<p>people in a box.</p>
<p>And it shows that we are all multifaceted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that sometimes we don&rsquo;t get the exposure.</p>
<p>Meaning, like, I would say I have different facets of my personality, because we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>friends for so long.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a gift you gave to me.</p>
<p>You just said being in that group chat with us, which can be a cacophonous fucking mess</p>
<p>sometimes that group chat can never, never, never to be published.</p>
<p>But the point is, like, and this is goes back to this first thing, like we can now really</p>
<p>like be authentic and show all these different facets of ourself.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, to me, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>Because then people see that there is more than, you know, like the most, the best rebuttal</p>
<p>to like that whole shut up and dribble, which was so fucking offensive, is literally for</p>
<p>you to be great at basketball, great at broadcasting, great as a, you know, social, you know, person</p>
<p>who can comment on the social times of our moment, great businessman.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m just going to put one thing out there right now.</p>
<p>Eventually, great fucking politician, because this is like now you want to talk about somebody</p>
<p>know, but you want to talk about somebody who can galvanize interest and there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>open governor.</p>
<p>Someone on our podcast no longer running.</p>
<p>Apparently, guys, guys, I&rsquo;m going to make a prediction that our bestie will be the governor</p>
<p>of Michigan or the governor of California.</p>
<p>Love it for before the time he&rsquo;s 50.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Maybe I mean, you know, I love the state of Michigan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you know.</p>
<p>But I think California will be home for me for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>So possibly California.</p>
<p>Hey, Draymond, let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on Twitter.</p>
<p>I understand you have a Twitter handle.</p>
<p>Sometimes you check it out.</p>
<p>Did you see Chamath&rsquo;s shirtless picture with the shirt off?</p>
<p>And did you see the thirst trap?</p>
<p>Did you see it?</p>
<p>And tell the truth.</p>
<p>I mean, he looked away.</p>
<p>If we all know Chamath, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Probably sent it to the fucking group chat.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s stepping out.</p>
<p>I definitely saw the picture.</p>
<p>Actually, I I&rsquo;m the one who posted it to the to the group chat.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s posted it.</p>
<p>And I my comment, my comment.</p>
<p>My comment was Chamath Kardashian.</p>
<p>Question mark.</p>
<p>Because you put you put the camera in front of your face.</p>
<p>You were like you it looked like this.</p>
<p>It was like this thing like that.</p>
<p>Dada taught me how to do this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>OK, guys, listen, we are we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re nearing the end of our podcast.</p>
<p>Jason, do you want to tell Dada what we&rsquo;re going to do?</p>
<p>OK, so some people have given some reviews or just feedback</p>
<p>on the pod, on the besties, maybe even you, Draymond.</p>
<p>And so we thought it would be incredibly uncomfortable</p>
<p>and funny for us to read some of these.</p>
<p>So, Sax, why don&rsquo;t you kick us off with one?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a really good pie chart here, which Nick Nick and</p>
<p>show, which shows all in pod talk time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically mostly Chamath and then Jason</p>
<p>with both Davids filling like a tiny little piece.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s one third.</p>
<p>The majority of it is Chamath and Jason talking over each other.</p>
<p>Board Elon Musk posted that, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, here&rsquo;s one from Brooklyn Gal 212 on Saks.</p>
<p>One star review.</p>
<p>Sax, go ahead and read this one star review from Brooklyn Gal 212.</p>
<p>Yeah, she says that David Saks ruins every conversation on this pod.</p>
<p>You forgot the period.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one about Chamath.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Chamath.</p>
<p>This is Chamath.</p>
<p>Yeah, Chamath, read this one.</p>
<p>OK, it&rsquo;s from Howard Axel Roark.</p>
<p>With a pill.</p>
<p>OK, with a pill.</p>
<p>It says, every time Chamath does something to make me like him,</p>
<p>he does two things to make me hate his guts.</p>
<p>I mean, go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>I think we can all relate to that one.</p>
<p>It sounds like me and my playing career.</p>
<p>Everyone fucking hates me, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Draymond, I will tell you, when I first when I first thought about putting a tweet out</p>
<p>for like the first time, you were the one who said, man, everyone&rsquo;s going to talk shit,</p>
<p>but forget the haters.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s just the way it goes when you start.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Fuck them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Fuck the haters.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one for this is a super fan.</p>
<p>Aaron sent this one into the email.</p>
<p>Jason, at this point, I fully believe you have bought, laminated and framed Kathy Griffin,</p>
<p>severed Trump in that picture.</p>
<p>How many gallons of semen spilled onto it when Biden was inaugurated?</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord.</p>
<p>Oh, too much.</p>
<p>Twitter offered two blue chuck marks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have three.</p>
<p>Your zealotry has made even Bill Maher blush and the other besties cringe when you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take even a slight ribbing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so bad now.</p>
<p>The besties have started their own side chat without you at your funeral.</p>
<p>The besties will show up not out of respect for you, but for your family.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord.</p>
<p>Signed, Jacqueline Sacks.</p>
<p>No comment here, Andy.</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord.</p>
<p>OK, David, here&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p>Yours is up, David.</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>I need to do this hot take.</p>
<p>Hot take.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>The hot take.</p>
<p>Hot takes.</p>
<p>Not deeply researched.</p>
<p>Three stars.</p>
<p>Jason and Chamath make good points, but the other two are such whiny nerds.</p>
<p>One of whom is clearly right wing.</p>
<p>Wannabe vanilla Isis.</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord.</p>
<p>So brittle.</p>
<p>Did he just call you a terrorist, Sacks?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s referring to Freeberg.</p>
<p>Which David?</p>
<p>Definitely not me.</p>
<p>Definitely not me.</p>
<p>They all have the same form where I just want to be clear.</p>
<p>Jason, you want to read the next one?</p>
<p>This is incredible.</p>
<p>Evil Jason.</p>
<p>Evil Jason.</p>
<p>OK, here we go.</p>
<p>This is from Adam Keem.</p>
<p>He posted this on January 30th, so not long ago.</p>
<p>He gives me a full one star, which I think one star is like number one, right?</p>
<p>Five stars is fifth place.</p>
<p>First star is one place.</p>
<p>Jason Calacanis is a monster.</p>
<p>Monster.</p>
<p>Not monster.</p>
<p>Monster, monster.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>After listening to Jason on the latest podcast, I am floored.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>His personal attacks and his complete support of the manipulators in our market should tell</p>
<p>you something.</p>
<p>This guy is evil.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>Thanks, mom.</p>
<p>David is trash.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p>Which David?</p>
<p>Freeberg.</p>
<p>Always Freeberg.</p>
<p>Always Freeberg.</p>
<p>Oh, no, here&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ll read.</p>
<p>If Metro Mile and or becoming new head of USA vaccination doesn&rsquo;t work out for David</p>
<p>Freeberg, he could still have an amazing career as a Kermit the Frog voice actor.</p>
<p>Fucker.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Marcus Aurelius A13367156 saying to me,</p>
<p>Stop sniffing your own farts.</p>
<p>What the fuck does that mean?</p>
<p>It means that you are so enamored with yourself, Jamal, that you think your farts are fragrant.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>OK, I&rsquo;m going to read.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to read a Draymond Green mean tweet.</p>
<p>Oh, there you go.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Draymond Green shoot like he&rsquo;s sitting down in a chair.</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Read the next one.</p>
<p>Read the next one.</p>
<p>Talk about rebounds or screens.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This is from Sugar Lump Lump Sugar Lump Lump Sugar Lump Lump.</p>
<p>Draymond Green is so attractive to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, because he&rsquo;s legally ugly.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>Did she nag you?</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s trying to slide into the DMs and nagging you at the same time.</p>
<p>You know, the brutal, by the way, the brutal thing about that, the way the brutal thing</p>
<p>about that, the brutal thing about that is is not not one sent to me.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, man, Draymond Green is really attractive.</p>
<p>I said, what the fuck are you talking about?</p>
<p>I said, I am so much better looking than Draymond Green.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never get over that, Draymond.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll talk about that for you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll never get over that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still tilted.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get crazy, OK?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re solid sevens on a podcast full of fives.</p>
<p>Take it easy.</p>
<p>Did they read Goldbluth&rsquo;s guts?</p>
<p>Goldbluth&rsquo;s guts.</p>
<p>Draymond Green still shoots like he got the door and he swore a black triangle off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so brutal.</p>
<p>We invite Draymond, we invite Draymond on this nice podcast.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even tell him.</p>
<p>Have him roast himself.</p>
<p>This is, he&rsquo;s never coming back.</p>
<p>Goldbluth&rsquo;s guts, those shots are not going in, buddy.</p>
<p>Not going in, buddy.</p>

<p>All right.</p>
<p>I love you all.</p>
<p>We appreciate you, Draymond.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Love you, Besties.</p>
<p>I love you, Besties.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this, like, sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the B.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the B.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are back.</p>
