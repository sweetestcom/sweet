    <p>The following is a conversation with David Kipping,</p>
<p>an astronomer and astrophysicist at Columbia University,</p>
<p>director of the Cool Worlds Lab,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s an amazing educator</p>
<p>about the most fascinating scientific phenomena</p>
<p>in our universe.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you check out his videos</p>
<p>on the Cool Worlds YouTube channel.</p>
<p>David quickly became one of my favorite human beings.</p>
<p>I hope to talk to him many more times in the future.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got SimpliSafe for home security,</p>
<p>Shopify for e-commerce,</p>
<p>and ExpressVPN for privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I find those annoying.</p>
<p>So I try my best to make sure we don&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>But if you skip these,</p>
<p>please still check out the sponsors.</p>
<p>I mean, without them, this podcast would not be possible.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a huge, huge thank you to them</p>
<p>for believing this podcast, for supporting it,</p>
<p>and they make good stuff,</p>
<p>which is the reason why they&rsquo;re a sponsor.</p>
<p>So maybe you might consider checking out their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe it will make you feel good as well.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by SimpliSafe,</p>
<p>a home security company designed to be simple and effective.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember at this point</p>
<p>how long it took me to set it up,</p>
<p>but it must&rsquo;ve been certainly less than an hour.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably like 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Everything just works.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s connected.</p>
<p>All the sensors are amazing.</p>
<p>Just super easy to use.</p>
<p>And I think that first layer of security,</p>
<p>of physical security is essential.</p>
<p>I take my security extremely seriously.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many, many layers</p>
<p>of both physical and digital security.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s just taking security seriously</p>
<p>allows you to kind of take control of your life</p>
<p>and take responsibility for being in this world,</p>
<p>a world that&rsquo;s sort of full of dangers and risks</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just really empowering,</p>
<p>just like discipline is freedom.</p>
<p>I think in that same way,</p>
<p>taking your security seriously is a kind of freedom</p>
<p>because it gives you freedom to take on the day.</p>
<p>Anyway, go to simplisafe.com</p>
<p>to get a free indoor security camera,</p>
<p>plus 20% off your order with interactive monitoring.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Shopify,</p>
<p>a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere</p>
<p>with a great looking online store</p>
<p>that brings your ideas to life</p>
<p>and tools to manage day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>I really, really should put out merch.</p>
<p>I know as a fan of podcasts, shows, bands, everything,</p>
<p>I love wearing the thing on my shirt</p>
<p>just to make myself feel good.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a nice way to connect with others</p>
<p>or start a conversation.</p>
<p>Like Metallica, I just wore a Metallica shirt to the gym.</p>
<p>One guy said, yeah, Metallica.</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>And together through that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know his life story.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know my life story.</p>
<p>And I think there was a joint celebration of two lives</p>
<p>that at least for time have enjoyed</p>
<p>the hell out of some Metallica.</p>
<p>So what can I say?</p>

<p>a company that for many, many years</p>
<p>brought happiness to my life</p>
<p>with a big sexy button that I press</p>
<p>and it takes care of everything.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really, really important that you have a VPN</p>
<p>and ExpressVPN has been my favorite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I really recommend.</p>
<p>The thing I love most about it is it does the thing</p>
<p>it does extremely well without extra features</p>
<p>that nobody needs.</p>
<p>And it does it in every single operating system or device,</p>
<p>Android, Mac OS, Linux, whatever.</p>
<p>I love software that is designed simply</p>
<p>or rather the final thing is simple</p>
<p>but the underlying design, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is.</p>
<p>They deliver a simple feeling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Olympic gymnast or Olympic athletes.</p>
<p>A gold medal is an effortless performance.</p>
<p>Perfection seems effortless</p>
<p>but the path, the journey to perfection</p>
<p>is one heck of a difficult journey.</p>
<p>And so whatever the journey ExpressVPN took,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad they did</p>
<p>because they created an amazing piece of software.</p>

<p>And now dear friends, here&rsquo;s David Kipping.</p>
<p>Your research at Columbia is in part focused</p>
<p>on what you call cool worlds</p>
<p>or worlds outside our solar system</p>
<p>where temperature is sufficiently cool</p>
<p>to allow for moons, rings, and life to form</p>
<p>and for us humans to observe it.</p>
<p>So can you tell me more about this idea,</p>
<p>this place of cool worlds?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think the cool world</p>
<p>is a place where we&rsquo;re constantly</p>
<p>in contact with the universe.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re constantly in contact with the universe.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re constantly in contact with the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, the history of discovering planets</p>
<p>outside our solar system was really dominated</p>
<p>by these hot planets.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just because of the fact</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re easier to find.</p>
<p>When the very first methods came online,</p>
<p>these were primarily the Doppler spectroscopy method,</p>
<p>looking for wobbling stars,</p>
<p>and also the transit method.</p>
<p>And these two both have a really strong bias</p>
<p>towards finding these hot planets.</p>
<p>Now, hot planets are interesting.</p>
<p>The chemistry in their atmosphere is fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very alien.</p>
<p>An example of one that&rsquo;s particularly close to my heart</p>
<p>is TrES-2b, whose atmosphere is so dark,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less reflective than coal.</p>
<p>And so they have really bizarre photometric properties,</p>
<p>yet at the same time,</p>
<p>they resemble nothing like our own home.</p>
<p>And so I said there&rsquo;s two types of astrophysicists.</p>
<p>The astrophysicists who care about how the universe works.</p>
<p>They wanna understand the mechanics</p>
<p>of the machinery of this universe.</p>
<p>Why did the Big Bang happen?</p>
<p>Why is the universe expanding?</p>
<p>How are galaxies formed?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another type of astrophysicist,</p>
<p>which perhaps speaks to me a little bit more.</p>
<p>It whispers into your ear.</p>
<p>And that is, why are we here?</p>
<p>Are we alone?</p>
<p>Are there others out there?</p>
<p>And ultimately, along this journey,</p>
<p>the hot planets aren&rsquo;t gonna get us there.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re looking for life in the universe,</p>
<p>seems to make perfect sense</p>
<p>that there should be planets like our own out there.</p>
<p>Maybe even moons like our own planet</p>
<p>around gas giants that could be habitable.</p>
<p>And so my research has been driven</p>
<p>by trying to find these more traqueous globes</p>
<p>that might resemble our own planet.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re the ones that lurk more in the shadows</p>
<p>in terms of how difficult it is to detect.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much harder.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re harder for several reasons.</p>
<p>The method we primarily use is the transit method.</p>
<p>So this is really eclipses.</p>
<p>As the planet passes in front of the star,</p>
<p>it blocks out some starlight.</p>
<p>The problem with that is that not all planets</p>
<p>pass in front of their star.</p>
<p>They have to be aligned correctly from your line of sight.</p>
<p>And so the further away the planet is from the star,</p>
<p>the cooler it is, the less likely it is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna get that geometric alignment.</p>
<p>So whereas a hot Jupiter, about 1% of hot Jupiters</p>
<p>will transit in front of their star,</p>
<p>only about 0.5%, maybe even a quarter of a percent</p>
<p>of Earth-like planets will have</p>
<p>the right geometry to transit.</p>
<p>And so that makes it much, much harder for us.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the connection between temperature of the planet</p>
<p>and geometric alignment,</p>
<p>probability of geometric alignment?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a direct connection,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re connected via an intermediate parameter,</p>
<p>which is their separation from the star.</p>
<p>So the planet will be cooler</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s further away from the star,</p>
<p>which in turn means that the probability</p>
<p>of getting that alignment correct is going to be less.</p>
<p>On top of that,</p>
<p>they also transit their star less frequently.</p>
<p>So if you go to the telescope</p>
<p>and you want to discover a hot Jupiter,</p>
<p>you could probably do it in a week or so</p>
<p>because the orbital period is of order of one, two, three days</p>
<p>so you can actually get the full orbit</p>
<p>two or three times over.</p>
<p>Whereas if you want to detect an Earth-like planet,</p>
<p>you have to observe that star for three, four years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually one of the problems with Kepler.</p>
<p>Kepler was this very successful mission</p>
<p>that NASA launched over a decade ago now, I think.</p>
<p>And it discovered thousands of planets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still the dominant source of exoplanets</p>
<p>that we know about,</p>
<p>but unfortunately it didn&rsquo;t last as long</p>
<p>as we would have liked it to.</p>
<p>It died after about 4.35 years, I think it was.</p>
<p>And so for an Earth-like planet,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just enough to catch four transits.</p>
<p>Four transits was kind of seen as the minimum.</p>
<p>But of course, the more transits you see,</p>
<p>the easier it is to detect it</p>
<p>because you build up signal to noise.</p>
<p>If you see the same thing, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,</p>
<p>the more ticks you get, the easier it is to find it.</p>
<p>And so it was really a shame</p>
<p>that Kepler was just at the limit</p>
<p>of where we were expecting it</p>
<p>to start to see Earth-like planets.</p>
<p>And in fact, it really found zero.</p>
<p>Zero planets that are around stars like the Sun,</p>
<p>that orbit similar to the Earth around the Sun,</p>
<p>and could potentially be similar to our own planet</p>
<p>in terms of its composition.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a great shame,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why it gives astronomers</p>
<p>more to do in the future.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, the transit method</p>
<p>is our primary way of detecting these things.</p>
<p>And what it is, is when the object passes,</p>
<p>occludes the source of light just a tiny bit, a few pixels.</p>
<p>And from that, we can infer something</p>
<p>about its mass, and size, and distance,</p>
<p>and geometry, and all of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like trying to tell, what?</p>
<p>At a party, you can&rsquo;t see anything about a person,</p>
<p>but you can just see by the way they occlude others.</p>
<p>So this is the method.</p>
<p>But is this a super far away?</p>
<p>How many pixels of information do we have, basically?</p>
<p>How high resolution is the signal</p>
<p>that we can get about these occlusions?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right in your description.</p>
<p>I think just to build upon that a little bit more,</p>
<p>it might be almost like your vision is completely blurry.</p>
<p>Like you have an extreme eye prescription,</p>
<p>and so you can&rsquo;t resolve anything.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s just blurs.</p>
<p>But you can tell that something was there</p>
<p>because it just got fainter for a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Someone passed in front of a light.</p>
<p>And so that light in your eyes</p>
<p>would just dim for a short moment.</p>
<p>Now, the reason we have that problem</p>
<p>with blurriness or resolution</p>
<p>is just because the stars are so far away.</p>
<p>The closest stars are four light years away,</p>
<p>but most of the stars Kepler looked at</p>
<p>were thousands of light years away.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s absolutely no chance</p>
<p>that the telescope can physically resolve the star,</p>
<p>or even the separation between the planet and the star</p>
<p>is too small, especially for a telescope like Kepler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a meter across.</p>
<p>In principle, you can make those detections,</p>
<p>but you need a different kind of telescope.</p>
<p>We call that direct imaging.</p>
<p>And direct imaging is a very exciting,</p>
<p>distinct way of detecting planets.</p>
<p>But it, as you can imagine,</p>
<p>is going to be far easier to detect planets</p>
<p>which are really far away from their star to do that,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s gonna make that separation really big.</p>
<p>And then you also want the star to be really close to us,</p>
<p>so the nearest stars.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you would prefer that planet</p>
<p>to be really hot,</p>
<p>because the hotter it is, the brighter it is.</p>
<p>And so that tends to bias direct imaging</p>
<p>towards planets which are in the process of forming.</p>
<p>So things which have just formed,</p>
<p>the planet&rsquo;s still got all of its primordial heat</p>
<p>embedded within it, and it&rsquo;s glowing.</p>
<p>We can see those quite easily.</p>
<p>But for the planets more like the Earth,</p>
<p>of course, they&rsquo;ve cooled down,</p>
<p>and so we can&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>The light is pitiful compared to a newly formed planet.</p>
<p>We would like to get there with direct imaging.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dream, is to have the pale blue dot,</p>
<p>an actual photograph of it,</p>
<p>maybe even just a one-pixel photograph of it.</p>
<p>But for now, the entire solar system is one pixel,</p>
<p>certainly with the transit method</p>
<p>and most other telescopes.</p>
<p>And so all you can do is see where that one pixel,</p>
<p>which contains potentially dozens of planets,</p>
<p>and the star, maybe even multiple stars,</p>
<p>dims for a short amount of time.</p>
<p>It dims just a little bit,</p>
<p>and from that, you can infer something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s like being a detective in the scene,</p>
<p>right, it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s indirect clues</p>
<p>of the existence of the planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that humans can do that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just looking out in these immense distances,</p>
<p>and looking, you know,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s alien civilizations out there,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say one exactly like our own,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like, would we even be able to see an Earth</p>
<p>that passes in the way of its sun and slightly dims?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only sign we have</p>
<p>of that alien human-like civilization out there,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s just a little bit of a dimming.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it depends on the type of star we&rsquo;re talking.</p>
<p>If it is a star truly like the sun,</p>
<p>the dip that causes is 84 parts per million.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s like the same as a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a firefly flying in front</p>
<p>of like a giant floodlight at a stadium or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of the brightness contrast</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to compare to.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s extremely difficult detection.</p>
<p>And in the very, very best cases, we can get down to that.</p>
<p>But as I said, we don&rsquo;t really have any true Earth analogs</p>
<p>that have been in the exoplanet candidate yet.</p>
<p>Unless you relax that definition, you say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just, doesn&rsquo;t have to be a star just like the sun.</p>
<p>It could be a star that&rsquo;s smaller than the sun.</p>
<p>It could be these orange dwarfs,</p>
<p>or even the red dwarf stars.</p>
<p>And the fact those stars are smaller means that</p>
<p>for the same size planet passing in front of it,</p>
<p>more light is blocked out.</p>
<p>And so a very exciting system, for example, is TRAPPIST-1,</p>
<p>which has seven planets, which are smaller than the Earth.</p>
<p>And those are quite easily detectable,</p>
<p>not with a space-based telescope,</p>
<p>but even from the ground.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just because the star is so much smaller</p>
<p>that the relative increase in or decrease in brightness</p>
<p>is enhanced significantly because that smaller size.</p>
<p>So TRAPPIST-1e, it&rsquo;s a planet</p>
<p>which is in the right distance for liquid water.</p>
<p>It has a slightly smaller size than the Earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 90% the size of the Earth, about 80% the mass.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the top targets right now</p>
<p>for potentially having life.</p>
<p>And yet it raises many questions about</p>
<p>what would that environment be like?</p>
<p>This is a star which is one eighth the mass of the sun.</p>
<p>Stars like that take a long time</p>
<p>to come off their adolescence.</p>
<p>When stars first form, like the sun,</p>
<p>it takes them maybe 10, 100 million years</p>
<p>to sort of settle into that main sequence lifetime.</p>
<p>But for stars like these late M dwarfs, as we call them,</p>
<p>they can take up to a billion years or more to calm down.</p>
<p>And during that period,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re producing huge amounts of X-rays,</p>
<p>ultraviolet radiation,</p>
<p>that could potentially rip off the entire atmosphere.</p>
<p>It may desiccate the planets in the system.</p>
<p>And so even if water arrived by comets or something,</p>
<p>it may have lost all that water</p>
<p>due to this prolonged period of high activity.</p>
<p>So we have lots of open-ended questions</p>
<p>about these M dwarf planets,</p>
<p>but they are the most accessible.</p>
<p>And so in the near term,</p>
<p>if we detect anything in terms of biosignatures,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be for one of these red dwarf stars,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be a true Earth twin,</p>
<p>as we would recognize it as having a yellow star.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a million ways to ask this question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll ask it about habitable worlds.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just go to our own solar system.</p>
<p>What can we learn about the planets and moons</p>
<p>in our solar system that might contain life?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s Mars or some of the moons of Jupiter</p>
<p>and Saturn, what kind of characteristics,</p>
<p>because you said it might not need to be Earth-like,</p>
<p>what kind of characteristics might we be looking for?</p>
<p>When we look for life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to define even what life is,</p>
<p>but we can maybe do a better job</p>
<p>in defining the sorts of things that life does.</p>
<p>And that provides some aspects to,</p>
<p>some avenue for looking for them.</p>
<p>In the, classically, conventionally,</p>
<p>I think we thought the way to look for life</p>
<p>was to look for oxygen.</p>
<p>Oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis on this planet.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t always have it.</p>
<p>Certainly if you go back to the Archean period,</p>
<p>there was, you have this period</p>
<p>called the Great Oxidation Event,</p>
<p>where the Earth floats with oxygen for the first time</p>
<p>and starts to saturate the oceans and then the atmosphere.</p>
<p>And so that oxygen, if we detect it on another planet,</p>
<p>whether it be Mars, Venus, or an exoplanet, whatever it is,</p>
<p>that was long thought to be evidence</p>
<p>for something doing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Because if you took away all the plant life on the Earth,</p>
<p>the oxygen wouldn&rsquo;t just hang around here</p>
<p>as a highly reactive molecule.</p>
<p>It would oxidize things.</p>
<p>And so within about a million years,</p>
<p>you would probably lose all the oxygen on planet Earth.</p>
<p>So that was conventionally</p>
<p>how we thought we could look for life.</p>
<p>And then we started to realize that it&rsquo;s not so simple</p>
<p>because A, there might be other things that life does</p>
<p>apart from photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Certainly the vast majority of the Earth&rsquo;s history</p>
<p>had no oxygen, and yet there was living things on it.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t seem like a complete test.</p>
<p>And secondly, could there be other things</p>
<p>that produce oxygen besides from life?</p>
<p>A growing concern has been these false positives</p>
<p>in biosignature work.</p>
<p>And so one example of that would be photolysis</p>
<p>that happens in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>When ultraviolet light hits the upper atmosphere,</p>
<p>it can break up water vapor.</p>
<p>The hydrogen splits off to the oxygen.</p>
<p>The hydrogen is a much lighter atomic species,</p>
<p>and so it can actually escape,</p>
<p>certainly planets like the Earth&rsquo;s gravity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t have any hydrogen or very little helium.</p>
<p>And so that leaves you with the oxygen,</p>
<p>which then oxidizes the surface.</p>
<p>And so there could be a residual oxygen signature</p>
<p>just due to this photolysis process.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been trying to generalize.</p>
<p>And certainly in recent years,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been other suggestions,</p>
<p>things we could look for in the solar system beyond.</p>
<p>Nitrous oxide, basically laughing gas,</p>
<p>is a product of microbes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;re starting</p>
<p>to get more interest in looking for.</p>
<p>Methane gas in combination with other gases</p>
<p>can be an important biosignature.</p>
<p>Phosphine as well, and phosphine&rsquo;s particularly relevant</p>
<p>to the solar system because there was a lot of interest</p>
<p>for Venus recently.</p>
<p>You may have heard that there was a claim</p>
<p>of a biosignature in Venus&rsquo;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>I think it was like two years ago now.</p>
<p>And the judge and jury are still out on that.</p>
<p>There was a very provocative claim and signature</p>
<p>of a phosphine-like spectral absorption.</p>
<p>But it could have also have been some other molecule</p>
<p>in particular, sulfur dioxide, which is not a biosignature.</p>
<p>So this is a detection of a gas in the atmosphere, Venus.</p>
<p>And it might be controversial in several dimensions.</p>
<p>So one, how to interpret that.</p>
<p>Two, is this the right gas?</p>
<p>And three, is this even the right detection?</p>
<p>Is there an error in the detection?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, how much do we believe</p>
<p>the detection in the first place?</p>
<p>If you do believe it, does that necessarily mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s life there?</p>
<p>And what gives?</p>
<p>How can you have life in Venus&rsquo;s atmosphere</p>
<p>in the first place?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been seen as like a hellhole place</p>
<p>for imagining life.</p>
<p>But I guess the counter to that has been that,</p>
<p>okay, yes, the surface is a horrendous place</p>
<p>to imagine life thriving.</p>
<p>But as you go up in altitude,</p>
<p>the very dense atmosphere means that there is a cloud layer</p>
<p>where the temperature and the pressure</p>
<p>become actually fairly similar to the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>And so maybe there are microbes stirring around</p>
<p>in the clouds, which are producing phosphine.</p>
<p>At the moment, this is fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a lot of us reinvigorated about the prospects</p>
<p>of going back to Venus and doing another mission there.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s now two NASA missions,</p>
<p>Veritas and Da Vinci, which are gonna be going back</p>
<p>and before 2030, the 2030s.</p>
<p>And then we have a European mission,</p>
<p>I think, that&rsquo;s slated now,</p>
<p>and even a Chinese mission</p>
<p>might be coming along the way as well.</p>
<p>So we might have multiple missions going to Venus,</p>
<p>which has long been overlooked.</p>
<p>I mean, apart from the Soviets,</p>
<p>there really has been very little</p>
<p>in the way of exploration of Venus,</p>
<p>certainly as compared to Mars.</p>
<p>Mars has enjoyed most of the activity</p>
<p>from NASA&rsquo;s rovers and surveys.</p>
<p>And Mars is certainly fascinating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this signature of methane</p>
<p>that has been seen there before.</p>
<p>Again, there, the discussion is whether that methane</p>
<p>is a product of biology, which is possible,</p>
<p>something that happens on the Earth,</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s some geological process</p>
<p>that we are yet to fully understand.</p>
<p>It could be, for example, a reservoir of methane</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trapped under the surface</p>
<p>and is leaking out seasonally.</p>
<p>So the nice thing about Venus is</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a giant living civilization there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be airborne, so you can just fly through</p>
<p>and collect samples.</p>
<p>With Mars and moons of Saturn and Jupiter,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to dig under to find the civilizations,</p>
<p>dead or living.</p>
<p>Right, and so, yeah, maybe it&rsquo;s easier then for Venus</p>
<p>because certainly you can imagine just a balloon</p>
<p>floating through the atmosphere,</p>
<p>or a drone or something that would have the capability</p>
<p>of just scooping up and sampling.</p>
<p>To dig under the surface of Mars is maybe feasible-ish,</p>
<p>especially with something like Starship</p>
<p>that could launch a huge digger, basically, to the surface</p>
<p>and you could just excavate away at the surface.</p>
<p>But for something like Europa,</p>
<p>we really are still unclear about how thick the ice layer is,</p>
<p>how you would melt through that huge thick layer</p>
<p>to get to the ocean,</p>
<p>and then potentially also discussions about contamination.</p>
<p>The problem with looking for life in the solar system,</p>
<p>which is different from looking for life with exoplanets,</p>
<p>is that you always run the risk of,</p>
<p>especially if you visit there,</p>
<p>of introducing the life yourself.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s very difficult to completely exterminate</p>
<p>every single microbe and spore on the surface of your rover</p>
<p>or the surface of your lander,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s always a risk of introducing something.</p>
<p>I mean, to some extent, there is continuous exchange</p>
<p>of material between these planets,</p>
<p>naturally, on top of that as well,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re sort of accelerating that process</p>
<p>to some degree.</p>
<p>And so if you dig into Europa&rsquo;s surface,</p>
<p>which probably is completely pristine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very unlikely there has been much exchange</p>
<p>with the outside world for its subsurface ocean,</p>
<p>you are, for the first time,</p>
<p>potentially introducing bacterial spores</p>
<p>into that environment that may compete</p>
<p>or may introduce spurious signatures</p>
<p>for the life you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s almost an ethical question</p>
<p>as to how to proceed with looking for life</p>
<p>on those subsurface oceans,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think we really have a good resolution</p>
<p>for it at this point.</p>
<p>So you mean ethical in terms of concern</p>
<p>for preserving life elsewhere,</p>
<p>not to murder it, as opposed to a scientific one?</p>
<p>I mean, we always worry about a space virus</p>
<p>coming here or some kind of external source,</p>
<p>and we would be the source of that potential contamination.</p>
<p>Or the other direction.</p>
<p>I mean, whatever survives in such harsh conditions</p>
<p>might be pretty good at surviving in all conditions.</p>
<p>It might be a little bit more resilient and robust,</p>
<p>so it might actually take a ride on us back home.</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure that some people</p>
<p>would be concerned about that.</p>
<p>I think we would hopefully have some containment procedures</p>
<p>as if we did sample return,</p>
<p>or I mean, you don&rsquo;t even really need a sample return.</p>
<p>These days, you can pretty much send</p>
<p>like a little micro laboratory to the planet</p>
<p>to do all the experiments in situ,</p>
<p>and then just send them back to your planet, the data.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think this is necessary,</p>
<p>especially for a case like that,</p>
<p>where you might have contamination concerns</p>
<p>that you have to bring samples back.</p>
<p>Although, probably if you brought back European sushi,</p>
<p>it would probably sell for quite a bit</p>
<p>with the billionaires in New York City.</p>
<p>Sushi, yeah.</p>
<p>I would love from an engineering perspective</p>
<p>just to see all the different candidates</p>
<p>and designs for like the scooper,</p>
<p>for Venus and the scooper for Europa and Mars.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really looked deeply into how they actually,</p>
<p>like the actual engineering of collecting the samples,</p>
<p>because the engineering of that is probably essential</p>
<p>for not either destroying life</p>
<p>or polluting it with our own microbes and so on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like an interesting engineering challenge.</p>
<p>I usually, for rovers and stuff,</p>
<p>focus on the sort of the mobility aspect of it,</p>
<p>on the robotics, the perception,</p>
<p>and the movement and the planning and the control.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s probably the scooper</p>
<p>is probably where the action is.</p>
<p>The microscopic sample collection.</p>
<p>So basically you have to first clean your vehicle,</p>
<p>make sure it doesn&rsquo;t have any earth-like things on it.</p>
<p>And then you have to put it into some kind of thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s perfectly sealed from the environment.</p>
<p>So if we bring it back or we analyze it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to bring anything else externally.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That would be an interesting engineering design there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Curiosity has been leaving</p>
<p>these little pods on the surface quite recently.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some neat photos that you can find online.</p>
<p>And they kind of look like lightsaber hilts,</p>
<p>which is so, yeah, to me,</p>
<p>I think I tweeted something like,</p>
<p>this weapon is your life.</p>
<p>Like, don&rsquo;t lose it, Curiosity,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just dumping these little vials everywhere.</p>
<p>And yeah, it is scooping up these things.</p>
<p>And the intention is that in the future</p>
<p>there will be a sample return mission</p>
<p>that will come and pick these up.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>the engineering behind those things is so impressive.</p>
<p>The thing that blows me away the most has been the landings,</p>
<p>especially I&rsquo;m trained to be a pilot at the moment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the sort of,</p>
<p>watching landings has become like my pet hobby</p>
<p>on YouTube at the moment,</p>
<p>and how not to do it,</p>
<p>how to do it with different levels of conditions and things.</p>
<p>But when you think about landing on Mars,</p>
<p>just the light travel time effect</p>
<p>means that there&rsquo;s no possibility</p>
<p>of a human controlling that descent.</p>
<p>And so you have to put all of your faith</p>
<p>and your trust in the computer code</p>
<p>or the AI or whatever it is that you&rsquo;ve put on board that thing</p>
<p>to make the correct descent.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this famous period called seven minutes of hell</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re basically waiting for that light travel time</p>
<p>to come back to know whether your vehicle successfully</p>
<p>landed on the surface or not.</p>
<p>And during that period,</p>
<p>you know in your mind simultaneously</p>
<p>that it is doing these multi-stages</p>
<p>of deploying its parachute, deploying the crane,</p>
<p>activating its jets to come down</p>
<p>and controlling its descent to the surface.</p>
<p>And then the crane has to fly away</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t accidentally hit the rover.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a series of multi-stage points</p>
<p>where any of them go wrong,</p>
<p>the whole mission could go awry.</p>
<p>And so the fact that we are fairly consistently able</p>
<p>to build these machines that can do this autonomously</p>
<p>is to me one of the most impressive acts of engineering</p>
<p>that NASA have achieved.</p>
<p>Yes, the unfortunate fact about physics</p>
<p>is the takeoff is easier than the landing.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And you mentioned Starship,</p>
<p>one of the incredible engineering feats</p>
<p>that you get to see is the reusable rockets</p>
<p>that take off but they land.</p>
<p>And they land using control and they do so perfectly.</p>
<p>And sometimes when it&rsquo;s synchronous,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s beautiful to see.</p>
<p>And then with Starship,</p>
<p>you see the chopsticks that catch the ship.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just so much incredible engineering.</p>
<p>But you mentioned Starship is somehow helpful here.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your hope with Starship?</p>
<p>What kind of science might it enable possibly?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two things.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the launch cost itself,</p>
<p>which is hopefully gonna mean per kilogram,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna dramatically reduce the cost of it.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s a factor of 10 higher</p>
<p>than what Elon originally promised,</p>
<p>this is gonna be a revolution for the cost to launch.</p>
<p>That means you could do all sorts of things.</p>
<p>You could launch large telescopes,</p>
<p>which could be basically like JWST,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t even have to fold them up.</p>
<p>JWST had this whole issue with its design</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s six and a half meters across.</p>
<p>And so you have to, there&rsquo;s no fuselage,</p>
<p>which is that large at the time.</p>
<p>The Ares IV wasn&rsquo;t large enough for that.</p>
<p>And so they had to fold it up</p>
<p>in this kind of complicated origami.</p>
<p>And so a large part of the cost</p>
<p>was figuring out how to fold it up,</p>
<p>testing that it unfolded correctly,</p>
<p>repeated testing.</p>
<p>And there was something like 130 fail points</p>
<p>or something during this unfolding mechanism.</p>
<p>And so all of us were holding our breath</p>
<p>during that process.</p>
<p>But if you have the ability to just launch</p>
<p>arbitrarily large masses,</p>
<p>at least comparatively compared to JWST,</p>
<p>and very large mirrors into space,</p>
<p>you can more or less repurpose ground-based mirrors.</p>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope mirror and the JWST mirrors</p>
<p>are designed to be extremely lightweight,</p>
<p>and that increased their cost significantly.</p>
<p>They have this kind of honeycomb design on the back</p>
<p>to try and minimize the weight.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t really care about weight,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so cheap,</p>
<p>then you could just literally grab</p>
<p>many of the existing ground-based mirrors</p>
<p>across telescopes across the world,</p>
<p>four-meter, five-meter mirrors,</p>
<p>and just pretty much attach them to a chassis</p>
<p>and have your own space-based telescope.</p>
<p>I think the Breakthrough Foundation, for instance,</p>
<p>is an entity that has been interested</p>
<p>in doing this sort of thing.</p>
<p>And so that raises the prospects</p>
<p>of having not just one JWST,</p>
<p>that just, you know,</p>
<p>JWST is a fantastic resource,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s split between all of us.</p>
<p>Cosmologists, star formation astronomers,</p>
<p>those of us studying exoplanets,</p>
<p>those of us wanting to study the ultra-deep fields</p>
<p>and the origin of the first galaxies,</p>
<p>the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>Everyone has to share this resource,</p>
<p>but we could potentially each have one JWST each</p>
<p>that is maybe just studying a handful</p>
<p>of the brightest exoplanet stars</p>
<p>and measuring their atmospheres.</p>
<p>This is important because if you,</p>
<p>and we talked about this planet Trappist-1e earlier,</p>
<p>that planet, if JWST stared at it</p>
<p>and tried to look for biosignatures,</p>
<p>by which I mean oxygen, nitrous oxide, methane,</p>
<p>it would take it of order of 200 transits</p>
<p>to get even a very marginal,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;d call two and a half sigma detection of those,</p>
<p>which basically nobody would believe with that.</p>
<p>100 transits, this thing transits once every six days,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re talking about four years</p>
<p>of staring at the same star with one telescope.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be some breaks,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;d be hard to schedule much else</p>
<p>because you have to continuously catch</p>
<p>each one of these transits</p>
<p>to build up your signal-to-noise.</p>
<p>And so JWST&rsquo;s never gonna do that.</p>
<p>In principle, technically, JWST could technically</p>
<p>have the capability of just about detecting a biosignature</p>
<p>on an Earth-like planet around a non-Sun-like star,</p>
<p>but still, impressively,</p>
<p>we have basically the technology to do that,</p>
<p>but we simply cannot dedicate all of its time practically</p>
<p>to that one resource.</p>
<p>And so Starship opens up opportunities like that</p>
<p>of mass-producing these kinds of telescopes,</p>
<p>which will allow us to survey for life in the universe,</p>
<p>which, of course, is one of the grand goals of astronomy.</p>
<p>I wonder if you can speak to the bureaucracy,</p>
<p>the political battles, the scientific battles</p>
<p>for time on the James Webb Telescope.</p>
<p>There must be a fascinating process of scheduling that.</p>
<p>All scientists, they&rsquo;re trying to collaborate,</p>
<p>figure out what the most important problems are,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an interesting network</p>
<p>of interfering scientific experiments, probably,</p>
<p>they have to somehow optimize over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really difficult process.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t envy the tech</p>
<p>that are gonna have to make this decision.</p>
<p>We call it the tech, the time allocation committee</p>
<p>that make this decision.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve served on these before, and it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>Typically for Hubble, we were seeing at least 10,</p>
<p>sometimes 20 times the number of proposals</p>
<p>for telescope time versus available telescope time.</p>
<p>For GDST, there has been one call already</p>
<p>that has gone out, we call it cycle one,</p>
<p>and that was oversubscribed by,</p>
<p>I think something like six to one, seven to one.</p>
<p>And the cycle two, which has just been announced</p>
<p>fairly recently, and the deadline</p>
<p>is actually the end of this month,</p>
<p>so my team are totally laser-focused</p>
<p>on running our proposals right now.</p>
<p>That is expected to be much more competitive,</p>
<p>probably more comparable to what Hubble saw.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>More competitive than the cycle one, you said, already?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s already super competitive.</p>
<p>More competitive than the first cycle.</p>
<p>So I said the first cycle of James Webb</p>
<p>was about six to one, and this will probably be more like</p>
<p>20 to one, I would expect.</p>
<p>So these are all proposals by scientists and so on,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not like you can schedule at any time,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re looking for transit times.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have a time-critical element.</p>
<p>Yes, time-critical element.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re conflicting in non-obvious ways,</p>
<p>because the frequency is different,</p>
<p>the duration is different,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably computational needs that are different,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the type of sensors, the direction pointing,</p>
<p>all that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s hard, and there are certain programs</p>
<p>like doing a deep field study,</p>
<p>where you just more or less point the telescope,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s pretty open.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re just accumulating photons.</p>
<p>You can just point at that patch of the sky,</p>
<p>whenever the telescope&rsquo;s not doing anything else,</p>
<p>and just get to your month,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a month of integration time is your goal</p>
<p>over the lifetime of JWST.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s maybe a little bit easier to schedule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder, especially for us looking at cool worlds,</p>
<p>because as I said earlier,</p>
<p>these planets transit very infrequently.</p>
<p>So we have to wait.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at the Earth transiting the Sun,</p>
<p>an alien watching us,</p>
<p>they would only get one opportunity per year</p>
<p>to do that observation.</p>
<p>The transit lasts for about 12 hours.</p>
<p>And so if they don&rsquo;t get that time, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>If it conflicted with another proposal</p>
<p>that wants to use another time-critical element.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier for planets like these hot planets</p>
<p>or these close-in planets,</p>
<p>because they transit so frequently,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s maybe 100 opportunities.</p>
<p>And so then the TAT can say, okay, they want 10 transits.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 100 opportunities here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier for us to give them time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost in the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re proposing to look for exoplanets</p>
<p>around two cool planets.</p>
<p>And so we really only have one bite of the cherry</p>
<p>for each one.</p>
<p>And so our sales pitch has been</p>
<p>that these are extremely precious events.</p>
<p>And more importantly, JWST is the only telescope,</p>
<p>the only machine humanity has ever constructed,</p>
<p>which is capable of finding moons</p>
<p>akin to the moons in our solar system.</p>
<p>Kepler can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Even Hubble can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>JWST is the first one.</p>
<p>And so there is a new window to the universe,</p>
<p>because we know these moons exist.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all over the place in the solar system.</p>
<p>You have the Moon, you have Io, Callisto,</p>
<p>Europa, Ganymede, Titan.</p>
<p>Lots of moons of fairly similar size,</p>
<p>sort of 30% the size of the Earth.</p>
<p>And this telescope is the first one that can find them.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re very excited about the profound implications</p>
<p>of ultimately solving this journey we&rsquo;re on in astronomy,</p>
<p>which is to understand our uniqueness.</p>
<p>We want to understand how common is the solar system,</p>
<p>are we the architecture that frequently emerges naturally,</p>
<p>or is there something special about what happened here?</p>
<p>I think this is not the worst case, it&rsquo;s the best case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious, it&rsquo;s super rare.</p>
<p>I love scheduling from a computer science perspective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my background.</p>
<p>So algorithmically, to solve a schedule problem,</p>
<p>I will schedule the rarest things first.</p>
<p>And obviously, JWST is the first thing</p>
<p>that can actually detect a cool world.</p>
<p>So this is a big new thing.</p>
<p>You can show off that new thing.</p>
<p>Happens rarely, schedule it first, it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>You should be in the TAC, this is perfect.</p>
<p>I will, I&rsquo;ll file my application</p>
<p>after we&rsquo;re done with this.</p>
<p>This part of me is the OCD,</p>
<p>part of me is the computational aspect.</p>
<p>I love scheduling.</p>
<p>Computing device, because you have that kind of scheduling</p>
<p>on supercomputers, that scheduling problem&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>How do you prioritize computation?</p>
<p>How do you prioritize science?</p>
<p>Data collection, sample collection,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually kind of fascinating,</p>
<p>because data, in ways you expect and don&rsquo;t expect,</p>
<p>will unlock a lot of solutions</p>
<p>to some fascinating mysteries.</p>
<p>And so collecting the data and doing so</p>
<p>in a way that maximizes the possibility of discovery</p>
<p>is really interesting, from a computational perspective.</p>
<p>I agree, there&rsquo;s a real satisfaction</p>
<p>extracting the maximum science per unit time</p>
<p>out of your telescope.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the TAC&rsquo;s job.</p>
<p>But the TAC are not machines,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not a piece of computer code.</p>
<p>They will make their selections based off human judgment.</p>
<p>And a lot of the telescope,</p>
<p>certainly within the field of exoplanets,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s different fields of astronomy,</p>
<p>but within the field of exoplanets,</p>
<p>I think a good expectation is that most of the telescope time</p>
<p>that JWC have will go towards atmospheric retrieval,</p>
<p>which is sort of alluded to earlier,</p>
<p>like detecting molecules in the atmospheres,</p>
<p>not biosignatures, because as I said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really not designed to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pushing JWST probably too far to expect it to do that.</p>
<p>But it could detect, for example,</p>
<p>a carbon dioxide rich atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1e.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a biosignature,</p>
<p>but you could prove it&rsquo;s like a Venus in that case,</p>
<p>or maybe like a Mars in that case,</p>
<p>like both those have carbon dioxide rich atmospheres.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t prove or disprove the existence of life either way,</p>
<p>but it is our first characterization</p>
<p>of the nature of those atmospheres.</p>
<p>Maybe we can even tell the pressure level</p>
<p>and the temperature of those atmospheres.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very exciting.</p>
<p>But we are competing with that.</p>
<p>And I think that science</p>
<p>is completely mind-blowing and fantastic.</p>
<p>We have a completely different objective,</p>
<p>which is in our case to try and look for the first evidence</p>
<p>of these small moons around these planets,</p>
<p>potentially even moons which could be habitable, of course.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a very exciting goal,</p>
<p>but ATT&amp;CK has to make a human judgment</p>
<p>essentially about which science are they most excited by,</p>
<p>which one has the highest promise of return,</p>
<p>the most highest chance of return.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>because if you look at a planetary atmosphere,</p>
<p>well, you know most of the time</p>
<p>the planet has an atmosphere already.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s almost a guaranteed success</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna learn something about the atmosphere</p>
<p>by pointing judiciously at it.</p>
<p>Whereas in our case, there&rsquo;s a harder sell.</p>
<p>We are looking for something</p>
<p>that we do not know for sure exists yet or not.</p>
<p>And so we are pushing the telescope to do something</p>
<p>which is inherently more risky.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the existence, if shown,</p>
<p>already gives a deep lesson</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s out there in the universe.</p>
<p>That means that other stars have similar types of variety</p>
<p>as we have in our solar system.</p>
<p>They have an Io, they have a Europa and so on,</p>
<p>which means there&rsquo;s a lot of possibility</p>
<p>for icy planets, for water,</p>
<p>for planets that enable planets and moons.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s super exciting,</p>
<p>because that means everywhere through our galaxy and beyond</p>
<p>that there is just innumerable possibility</p>
<p>for weird creatures.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to convince me.</p>
<p>I mean, NASA has been on this quest for a long time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sometimes called Eater Earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the frequency of Earth-like,</p>
<p>usually they say planets, in the universe.</p>
<p>How common are planets similar to our Earth?</p>
<p>In terms of, ultimately,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like to know everything about these planets</p>
<p>in terms of the amount of water they have,</p>
<p>how much atmosphere they have.</p>
<p>But for now, it&rsquo;s kind of focused just on the size</p>
<p>and the distance from the star, essentially.</p>
<p>How often do you get similar conditions to that?</p>
<p>That was Kepler&rsquo;s primary mission</p>
<p>and it really just kind of flirted with the answer.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t quite get to a definitive answer.</p>
<p>But I always say, look, if that&rsquo;s our primary goal,</p>
<p>to look for Earth-like, I would say, worlds,</p>
<p>then moons has to be a part of that.</p>
<p>Because we know that Earth-like,</p>
<p>from the Kepler data, the preliminary result</p>
<p>is that Earth-like planets around sun-like stars</p>
<p>is not an inevitable outcome.</p>
<p>It seems to be something like a one to 10% outcome.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not particularly inevitable that that happens.</p>
<p>But we do often see about half of all sun-like stars</p>
<p>have either a mini-Neptune, a Neptune, or a Jupiter</p>
<p>in the habitable zone of their stars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very, very common occurrence that we see.</p>
<p>Yet we have no idea how often they have moons around them,</p>
<p>which could also be habitable.</p>
<p>And so there may very well be,</p>
<p>if even one in five of them has an Earth-like moon</p>
<p>or even a Mars-like moon around them,</p>
<p>then there would be more habitable real estate</p>
<p>in terms of exomoons than exoplanets in the universe.</p>
<p>Essentially, 2x, 3x, 5x, maybe 10x,</p>
<p>the number of habitable worlds out there in the universe.</p>
<p>Our current estimate, like the Drake equation.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>So this is one way to increase the confidence</p>
<p>and increase the value of that parameter.</p>
<p>And just know where to look.</p>
<p>I mean, we would like to know</p>
<p>where should we listen for technosignatures?</p>
<p>Where should we be looking for biosignatures?</p>
<p>And not only that, but what role does the moon have</p>
<p>in terms of its influence on the planet?</p>
<p>We talked about these directly imaged telescopes earlier,</p>
<p>these missions that want to take a photo</p>
<p>to quote Carl Sagan, the pale blue dot of our planet,</p>
<p>but the pale blue dot of an exoplanet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the dream, to one day capture that.</p>
<p>But as impressive as the resolution is</p>
<p>that we are planning and conspiring to design</p>
<p>for the future generation telescopes to achieve that,</p>
<p>even those telescopes will not have the capability</p>
<p>of resolving the Earth and the moon within that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a pale blue dot pixel,</p>
<p>but the moon&rsquo;s grayness will be intermixed with that pixel.</p>
<p>And so this is a big problem,</p>
<p>because one of the ways that we are claiming</p>
<p>to look for life in the universe</p>
<p>is a chemical disequilibrium.</p>
<p>So you see two molecules that just shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>They normally react with each other.</p>
<p>Or even one molecule that&rsquo;s just too reactive</p>
<p>to be hanging around the atmosphere by itself.</p>
<p>So if you had oxygen and methane hanging out together,</p>
<p>those would normally react fairly easily.</p>
<p>And so if you detected those two molecules</p>
<p>in your pale blue dot spectra,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like, okay, we have evidence for life.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s metabolizing on this planet.</p>
<p>However, the challenge here is what if that moon was Titan?</p>
<p>Titan has a methane-rich atmosphere.</p>
<p>And what if the pale blue dot</p>
<p>was in fact a planet devoid of life,</p>
<p>but it had oxygen because of water</p>
<p>undergoing this photolysis reaction,</p>
<p>splitting into oxygen and hydrogen separately?</p>
<p>So then you have all of the hallmarks</p>
<p>of what we would claim to be life.</p>
<p>But all along you were tricked.</p>
<p>It was just a moon that was deceiving you.</p>
<p>And so we are never going to,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re never going to, I would claim,</p>
<p>really understand or complete this quest</p>
<p>of looking for life by signatures in the universe</p>
<p>unless we have a deep knowledge of the prevalence</p>
<p>and role that moons have.</p>
<p>They may even affect the habitability</p>
<p>of the planets themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, our own moon is freakishly large.</p>
<p>By mass ratio, it&rsquo;s the largest moon in the solar system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 1% mass moon.</p>
<p>If you look at Jupiter&rsquo;s moons,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like 10 to the power minus four, much smaller.</p>
<p>And so our own moon seems to stabilize</p>
<p>the obliquity of our planet.</p>
<p>It gives rise to tides,</p>
<p>especially early on when the moon was closer,</p>
<p>those tides would have covered entire continents.</p>
<p>And those rock pools that would have been scattered</p>
<p>across the entire plateau</p>
<p>may have been the origin of life on our planet.</p>
<p>The moon forming impact may have stripped</p>
<p>a significant fraction of lithosphere off the Earth,</p>
<p>which without it, plate tectonics may not have been possible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d have had a stagnant lid</p>
<p>because there was just too much lithosphere</p>
<p>stuck on the top of the planet.</p>
<p>And so there are speculative reasons,</p>
<p>but intriguing reasons as to why a large moon</p>
<p>may be not just important,</p>
<p>but central to the question</p>
<p>of having the conditions necessary for life.</p>
<p>So moons can be habitable in their own right,</p>
<p>but they can also play a significant influence</p>
<p>on the habitability of the planets they orbit.</p>
<p>And further, they will surely interfere</p>
<p>with our attempts to detect life remotely from afar.</p>
<p>So taking a tangent upon a tangent,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written about binary planets.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, and that they&rsquo;re surprisingly common,</p>
<p>or they might be surprisingly common.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between a large moon</p>
<p>and binary planets?</p>
<p>What are binary planets?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting to say here</p>
<p>about giant rocks flying through space</p>
<p>and orbiting each other?</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s interesting about binary objects</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re very common in the universe.</p>
<p>Binary stars are everywhere.</p>
<p>In fact, the majority of stars</p>
<p>seem to live in binary systems.</p>
<p>When we look at the outer edges of the solar system,</p>
<p>we see binary Kuiper Belt objects all the time.</p>
<p>Asteroids basically bound to one another.</p>
<p>Pluto-Charon is kind of an example of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 10% mass ratio system.</p>
<p>It almost is, by many definitions, a binary planet,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s a dwarf planet.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;d call that now.</p>
<p>But we know that the universe likes to make things in pairs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying our sun is an incel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s looking, so most things are dating,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in relationships, and ours is alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a complete freak of the universe to be alone,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more common for sun-like stars.</p>
<p>If you count up all the sun-like stars in the universe,</p>
<p>about half of the sun-like star systems</p>
<p>are in binary or trinary systems,</p>
<p>and the other half are single.</p>
<p>But because those binaries are two or three stars,</p>
<p>then cumulatively, maybe a third of all sun-like stars</p>
<p>are single.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying hard to not anthropomorphize</p>
<p>the relationship the stars have with each other.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>The triplets.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve met those folks also.</p>
<p>So is there something interesting to learn</p>
<p>about the habitability, how that affects the probability</p>
<p>of habitable worlds when they kind of couple up like that</p>
<p>in those different ways?</p>
<p>It depends which way the stars of the planet.</p>
<p>Certainly, if stars couple up,</p>
<p>that has a big influence on the habitability.</p>
<p>Of course, this is very famous from Star Wars.</p>
<p>Tatooine in Star Wars is a binary star system,</p>
<p>and you have Luke Skywalker looking at the sunset</p>
<p>and seeing two stars come down.</p>
<p>And for years, we thought that was purely a product</p>
<p>of George Lucas&rsquo;s incredibly creative mind,</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t think that planets would exist</p>
<p>around binary star systems.</p>
<p>It seems like too tumultuous an environment</p>
<p>for a quiescent planetary disc,</p>
<p>circumstellar disc to form planets from.</p>
<p>And yet, one of the astounding discoveries from Kepler</p>
<p>was that these appear to be quite common.</p>
<p>In fact, as far as we can tell,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just as common around binary stars as single stars.</p>
<p>The only caveat to that is that you don&rsquo;t get planets</p>
<p>close into binary stars.</p>
<p>They have like a clearance region on the inside</p>
<p>where planets, maybe they form there, but they don&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>They are dynamically unstable in that zone.</p>
<p>But once you get out to about the distance</p>
<p>that the Earth orbits the Sun,</p>
<p>or even a little bit closer in,</p>
<p>you start to find planets emerging.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s the right distance for liquid water,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the right distance for potentially life</p>
<p>on those planets.</p>
<p>And so, there may very well be plenty of habitable planets</p>
<p>around the binary stars.</p>
<p>Binary planets is a little bit different.</p>
<p>Binary planets, I don&rsquo;t think we have any serious connection</p>
<p>of planet banality to habitability.</p>
<p>Certainly when we investigated it, that wasn&rsquo;t our drive,</p>
<p>that this is somehow the solution</p>
<p>to life in the universe or anything.</p>
<p>It was really just a, like all good science questions,</p>
<p>a curiosity-driven question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the dynamic?</p>
<p>Are they legit orbiting each other</p>
<p>as they orbit the star?</p>
<p>So, the formation mechanism proposed here,</p>
<p>because it is very difficult to form two proto-planets</p>
<p>close to each other like this.</p>
<p>They would generally merge within the disk,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s why you normally get single planets.</p>
<p>But you could have something like Jupiter and Saturn</p>
<p>form at separate distances.</p>
<p>They could dynamically be scattered in towards one another</p>
<p>and basically not quite collide,</p>
<p>but have a very close-on encounter.</p>
<p>Now, because tidal forces increase dramatically</p>
<p>as the distance decreases between two objects,</p>
<p>the tides can actually dissipate the kinetic energy</p>
<p>and bring them bound into one another.</p>
<p>So, that seems, when you first hear that,</p>
<p>you think, well, that seems fairly contrived</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d have the conditions just right</p>
<p>to get these tides to cause a capture.</p>
<p>But numerical simulations have shown that about 10%</p>
<p>of planet-planet encounters are shown to produce</p>
<p>something like binary planets,</p>
<p>which is a startling prediction.</p>
<p>And so, that seems at odds with, naively,</p>
<p>the exoplanet catalogue, for which we know of,</p>
<p>so far, no binary planets.</p>
<p>And we propose one of the resolutions to this</p>
<p>might be that the binary planets</p>
<p>are just incredibly difficult to detect,</p>
<p>which is also counterintuitive,</p>
<p>because, remember how they form</p>
<p>is through this tidal mechanism,</p>
<p>and so they form extremely close to each other.</p>
<p>So, the distance that Io is away from Jupiter,</p>
<p>just a few planetary radii,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re almost touching one another,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just tidally locked,</p>
<p>facing each other for eternity.</p>
<p>And so, in that configuration,</p>
<p>as it transits across the star,</p>
<p>it kind of looks like you can&rsquo;t really resolve</p>
<p>those two planets.</p>
<p>It just looks like one planet to you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going across the star.</p>
<p>The temporal resolution of the data</p>
<p>is rarely good enough to distinguish that.</p>
<p>And so, you&rsquo;d see one transit,</p>
<p>but in fact, it&rsquo;s two planets very close together,</p>
<p>which are transiting at once.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, we wrote a paper just recently</p>
<p>where we developed some techniques</p>
<p>to try and get around this problem,</p>
<p>and hopefully provide a tool</p>
<p>where we could finally look for these planets.</p>
<p>The problem of detection of these planets</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re so close together.</p>
<p>That was our focus, was how do you get around</p>
<p>this merging problem?</p>
<p>So, whether they&rsquo;re out there or not,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re planning to do a search for them,</p>
<p>but it remains an open question.</p>
<p>And I think just one of those fun</p>
<p>astrophysics curiosities questions,</p>
<p>whether binary planets exist in the universe.</p>
<p>Because then you have binary Earths,</p>
<p>you could have binary Neptune,</p>
<p>all sorts of wild stuff that would</p>
<p>float the sci-fi imagination.</p>
<p>I wonder what the physics on a binary planet feels like.</p>
<p>It might be trivial.</p>
<p>I have to think about that.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s some interesting dynamics.</p>
<p>Like, if you have multiple,</p>
<p>or would gravity feel different</p>
<p>at different parts of the surface of the sphere</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s another large sphere that&rsquo;s interesting?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would think that the force</p>
<p>would be fairly similar,</p>
<p>because the shape of the object</p>
<p>would deform to a flat geopotential,</p>
<p>essentially, a uniform geopotential.</p>
<p>But it would lead to a distorted shape</p>
<p>for the two objects.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;d become ellipsoids facing one another.</p>
<p>So, it would be pretty wild when you,</p>
<p>people like flat Earth or spherical Earth,</p>
<p>you fly from space and you see a football-shaped Earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your own planet.</p>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s proof.</p>
<p>And I wonder how difficult it would be</p>
<p>to travel from one to the other,</p>
<p>because you have to overcome the one.</p>
<p>No, it might be kind of easy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, they&rsquo;re so close to each other, that helps.</p>
<p>And I think the most critical factor</p>
<p>would be how massive is the planet?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always, I mean,</p>
<p>one of the challenges with escaping planets,</p>
<p>there was a fun paper one of my colleagues wrote</p>
<p>that suggested that super-Earth planets may be inescapable.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a civilization that were born on a super-Earth,</p>
<p>the surface gravity is so high</p>
<p>that the chemical potential energy of hydrogen</p>
<p>or methane, whatever fuel you&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>simply is at odds with the gravity of the planet itself.</p>
<p>And so you would, you know,</p>
<p>our current rockets, I&rsquo;m not sure of the fraction,</p>
<p>but maybe like 90% of the rocket is fuel or something</p>
<p>by mass.</p>
<p>These things would have to be,</p>
<p>like the size of the Giza pyramids of fuel</p>
<p>with just a tiny tip on the top</p>
<p>in order just to escape that planetary atmosphere.</p>
<p>And so it has been argued that if you live on a super-Earth,</p>
<p>you may be forced to live there forever.</p>
<p>There may be no escape</p>
<p>unless you invent a space elevator or something,</p>
<p>but then how do you even build the infrastructure in space</p>
<p>to do something like that</p>
<p>in the absence of a successful rocket program?</p>
<p>And so the more and more we look at our Earth</p>
<p>and think about the sorts of problems we&rsquo;re facing,</p>
<p>the more you see things about the Earth</p>
<p>which make it ideally suited in so many regards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost spooky, right,</p>
<p>that we not only live on a planet</p>
<p>which has the right conditions for life,</p>
<p>for intelligent life,</p>
<p>for sustained fossil fuel industry</p>
<p>just happens to be in the ground.</p>
<p>We have plenty of fossil fuels</p>
<p>to get our industrial revolution going,</p>
<p>but also the chemical energy contained</p>
<p>within those fossil fuels and hydrogen and other fuels</p>
<p>is sufficient that we have the ability</p>
<p>to escape our planetary atmosphere and planetary gravity</p>
<p>to have a space program.</p>
<p>And we also happen to have a celestial body</p>
<p>which is just within reach, the Moon,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t also necessarily have to be true.</p>
<p>Were the Moon not there,</p>
<p>what effect would that have had</p>
<p>on our aspirations of a space program in the 1960s?</p>
<p>Would there have ever been a space race to Mars or to Venus?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a much harder, certainly for a human program,</p>
<p>that seems almost impossible with 1960s technology</p>
<p>to ever come to fruition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if somebody constructed</p>
<p>a set of challenging obstacles before us,</p>
<p>challenging problems to solve.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re challenging, but they&rsquo;re doable.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sequence to them.</p>
<p>Gravity is very difficult to overcome,</p>
<p>but we have, given the size of Earth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not so bad that we can still actually</p>
<p>construct propulsion systems that can escape it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the same with climate change, perhaps.</p>
<p>I mean, climate change is the next major problem</p>
<p>facing our civilization,</p>
<p>but we know it is technically surmountable.</p>
<p>You know, it does seem sometimes</p>
<p>like there has been a series of challenges laid out</p>
<p>to progress us towards a mature civilization</p>
<p>that can one day perhaps expand to the stars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little more concerned about nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>AI, and natural or artificial pandemics,</p>
<p>but yes, climate change.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, there you go.</p>
<p>I mean, plenty of milestones that we need to cross.</p>
<p>And we can argue about the severity of each of them,</p>
<p>but there is no doubt that we live in a world</p>
<p>that has serious challenges</p>
<p>that are pushing our intellects and our will</p>
<p>to the limit of whether we&rsquo;re really ready</p>
<p>to progress to the next stage of our development.</p>
<p>So thank you for taking the tangent,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be a million more,</p>
<p>but can we step back to Kepler-1625b?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve talked about this kind of journey,</p>
<p>this effort to discover exomoons,</p>
<p>so moons out there, or small, cool objects out there.</p>
<p>Where does that effort stand,</p>
<p>and what is Kepler-1625b?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;ve been searching for exomoons</p>
<p>for most of my professional career,</p>
<p>and I think a lot of my colleagues think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of crazy to still be doing it.</p>
<p>You know, after five years of not finding anything,</p>
<p>I think most people would probably</p>
<p>try doing something else.</p>
<p>I even had people say that to me.</p>
<p>They said, you know, professors,</p>
<p>and I remember at a cocktail party,</p>
<p>took me to the side, an MIT professor,</p>
<p>and he said, you know,</p>
<p>you should just look for hot Jupiters.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, you can write papers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so easy to find.</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah, but hot Jupiters just,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not interesting to me.</p>
<p>I wanna do something that I feel</p>
<p>intellectually pushes me to the edge,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s maybe a contribution</p>
<p>that not no one else could do,</p>
<p>but maybe is not certainly the thing</p>
<p>that anybody could do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna just be the first to something</p>
<p>for the sake of being first.</p>
<p>I wanna do something that feels like</p>
<p>a meaningful intellectual contribution to our society.</p>
<p>And so, you know, this exomoon problem</p>
<p>has been haunting me for years to try and solve this.</p>
<p>Now, as I said, we looked for years and years using Kepler,</p>
<p>and the closest we ever got was just a hint</p>
<p>for this one star, Kepler-1625,</p>
<p>has a Jupiter-like planet in orbit of it,</p>
<p>and that Jupiter-like planet is on a 287-day period,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s almost the same distance</p>
<p>as the Earth around the Sun, but for a Jupiter.</p>
<p>So that was already unusual.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people realize that Jupiter-like planets</p>
<p>are quite rare in the universe.</p>
<p>Certainly mini-Neptunes and Neptunes are extremely common,</p>
<p>but Jupiters, only about 10% of Sun-like stars</p>
<p>have Jupiters around them, as far as we can tell.</p>
<p>When you say Jupiter, which aspect of Jupiter?</p>
<p>In terms of its mass and its semi-major axis.</p>
<p>So anything beyond about half an AU,</p>
<p>so half the distance of the Earth and the Sun,</p>
<p>and something of order of a tenth of a Jupiter mass,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the mass of Saturn, up to, say, 10 Jupiter masses,</p>
<p>which is basically where you start to get to brown dwarfs,</p>
<p>those types of objects appear to be somewhat unusual.</p>
<p>Most solar systems do not have Jupiters,</p>
<p>which is really interesting, because Jupiter, again,</p>
<p>like the Moon, seems to have been a pivotal character</p>
<p>in the story of the development of our solar system,</p>
<p>perhaps especially having a large influence</p>
<p>on the development of the late heavy bombardment</p>
<p>and the rate of asteroid impacts</p>
<p>that we receive and things like this.</p>
<p>Anyway, to come back to 1625,</p>
<p>this Jupiter-like planet had a hint</p>
<p>of something in the data.</p>
<p>But what I mean by that is when we looked at the transit,</p>
<p>we got the familiar decrease in light</p>
<p>that we always see when a planet tries to confront the star,</p>
<p>but we saw something extra, just on the edges,</p>
<p>we saw some extra dips around the outside.</p>
<p>It was right at the hairy edge of detectability.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t believe it, because I think one of the challenges</p>
<p>of looking for something for 10 years</p>
<p>is that you become your own greatest skeptic.</p>
<p>And no matter what you&rsquo;re shown,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always thinking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been falling in love so many times,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not working out.</p>
<p>You convince yourself it&rsquo;s never gonna happen.</p>
<p>Not for me, this just isn&rsquo;t gonna happen.</p>
<p>And so I saw that, and I didn&rsquo;t really believe it,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t dare let myself believe it.</p>
<p>But being a good scientist,</p>
<p>we knew we had an obligation to publish it,</p>
<p>to talk about the result, and to follow it up,</p>
<p>and to try and resolve what was going on.</p>
<p>So we asked for Hubble Space Telescope time,</p>
<p>which was awarded in that case.</p>
<p>So we were one of those lucky 20 that got telescope time.</p>
<p>And we studied it for about 40 hours continuously.</p>
<p>And to provide some context,</p>
<p>the dip that we saw in the Kepa data</p>
<p>corresponded to a Neptune-sized moon</p>
<p>around a Jupiter-sized planet,</p>
<p>which was another reason why I was skeptical.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that in the solar system.</p>
<p>That seems so strange.</p>
<p>And then when we got the Hubble data,</p>
<p>it seemed to confirm exactly that.</p>
<p>There was two really striking pieces of evidence</p>
<p>in the data that suggested this moon was there.</p>
<p>Another was a fairly clear second dip in light,</p>
<p>pretty clearly resolved by Hubble.</p>
<p>It was about a five-sigma detection.</p>
<p>And on top of that,</p>
<p>we could see the planet didn&rsquo;t transit</p>
<p>when it should have done.</p>
<p>It actually transited earlier than we expected it to,</p>
<p>by about 20 minutes or so.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a hallmark of a gravitation interaction</p>
<p>between the planet and the moon.</p>
<p>We actually expected that.</p>
<p>You can also expect that if the moon transits</p>
<p>after the planet,</p>
<p>then the planet should come in earlier than expected,</p>
<p>because the barycenter, the center of mass,</p>
<p>lives between the two of them,</p>
<p>kind of like on a balancing arm between them.</p>
<p>And so we saw that as well.</p>
<p>So the phase signature matched up.</p>
<p>The mass of the moon was measured to be Neptune mass,</p>
<p>and the size of the moon was measured to be Neptune radius.</p>
<p>And so everything just really lined up.</p>
<p>And we spent months and months trying to kill it.</p>
<p>This is my strategy for anything interesting.</p>
<p>We just try to throw the kitchen sink at it and say,</p>
<p>we must be tricked by something.</p>
<p>And so we tried looking at the centroid motion</p>
<p>of the telescope,</p>
<p>but the different wavelength channels have been observed,</p>
<p>the pixel level information.</p>
<p>And no matter what we did, we just couldn&rsquo;t get rid of it.</p>
<p>And so we submitted it to Science.</p>
<p>And I think at the time,</p>
<p>Science, which is one of the top journals, said to us,</p>
<p>would you mind calling your paper discovery of an exomoon?</p>
<p>And I had to push back.</p>
<p>And we said, no, we&rsquo;re not calling it that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, even despite everything we&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not calling it a discovery.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re calling it evidence for an exomoon.</p>
<p>Because for me, I&rsquo;d wanna see this repeat</p>
<p>two times, three times, four times</p>
<p>before I really would bet my house</p>
<p>that this is the real deal.</p>
<p>And I do worry, as I said,</p>
<p>that perhaps that&rsquo;s my own self-skepticism going too far.</p>
<p>But I think it was the right decision.</p>
<p>And since that paper came out,</p>
<p>there has been continuous interest in the subject.</p>
<p>Another team independently analyzed that star</p>
<p>and recovered actually pretty much exactly</p>
<p>the same results as us, the same dip,</p>
<p>the same wobble of the planet.</p>
<p>And a third team looked at it</p>
<p>and actually got something different.</p>
<p>They saw the dip was diminished compared to what we saw.</p>
<p>They saw a little hint of a dip,</p>
<p>but not as pronounced as what we saw.</p>
<p>And they saw the wobble as well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been a little bit of tension</p>
<p>about analyzing the reduction of the Hubble data.</p>
<p>And so the only way in my mind to resolve this</p>
<p>is just to look again.</p>
<p>We actually did propose to Hubble straight after that.</p>
<p>And we said, look, if our model is right,</p>
<p>if the moon is there, it came in late last time.</p>
<p>It transited after the planet.</p>
<p>Because of the orbit,</p>
<p>we can calculate that it should transit</p>
<p>before the planet next time.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not there, if it doesn&rsquo;t transit before,</p>
<p>and even if we see a dip afterwards,</p>
<p>we know that&rsquo;s not our moon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously some instrumental effect with the data.</p>
<p>We had a causal prediction as to where the moon should be.</p>
<p>And so I was really excited about that,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t get the telescope time.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, if you go further into the future,</p>
<p>we no longer have the predictive capability</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like predicting the weather.</p>
<p>You might be able to predict the weather next week</p>
<p>to some level of accuracy,</p>
<p>but predicting the weather next year becomes incredibly hard.</p>
<p>The uncertainties just grow and compound</p>
<p>as you go forward into the future more and more.</p>
<p>How were you able to know</p>
<p>where the moon would be positioned?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re able to tell the orbiting geometry and frequency?</p>
<p>Yeah, so basically from the wobbles of the planet itself,</p>
<p>that tells us the orbital motion of the moon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reflex motion of the moon on the planet.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it just an estimate to where,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m concerned about you making a strong prediction here</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t get the moon</p>
<p>where the moon leads on the next time around,</p>
<p>if you did get Hubble time,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t that mean something else if you didn&rsquo;t see that?</p>
<p>Because you said it would be an instrumental.</p>
<p>I feel the strong urge to disprove your own,</p>
<p>which is a really good imperative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good way to do science,</p>
<p>but like this is such a noisy signal, right?</p>
<p>Or blurry signal, maybe.</p>
<p>Low resolution signal, maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a five sigma signal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at the slightly uncomfortable edge.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s often said that for any detection</p>
<p>of a first new phenomena,</p>
<p>you really want like a 20, 25 sigma detection.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s just no doubt that what you&rsquo;re seeing is real.</p>
<p>This was at that edge.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s comparable to the Higgs boson,</p>
<p>but the Higgs boson was slightly different</p>
<p>because there was so much theoretical impetus</p>
<p>as to expect a signal at that precise location.</p>
<p>A Neptune-sized moon was not predicted by anyone.</p>
<p>No one, there was no papers you can find</p>
<p>that expect Neptune-sized moons around Jupiter-sized planets.</p>
<p>So I think we were inherently skeptical</p>
<p>about its reality for that reason.</p>
<p>But this is science in action.</p>
<p>When we fit the wobbles, we fit the dips,</p>
<p>and we have this 3G geometric model</p>
<p>for the motion of the orbit,</p>
<p>and projecting that forward,</p>
<p>we found that about 80% of our projections</p>
<p>led to the moon to be before.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not 100%.</p>
<p>There was maybe 20% of the cases it was over here.</p>
<p>But to me, that was a hard enough projection</p>
<p>that we felt confident that we could refute the,</p>
<p>which was what I really wanted.</p>
<p>I wanted a refutable,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the basis of science,</p>
<p>a falsifiable hypothesis.</p>
<p>How can you make progress in science</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have a falsifiable testable hypothesis?</p>
<p>And so that was the beauty of this particular case.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a numerical simulation with a moon</p>
<p>that fits the data that we observed,</p>
<p>and then you can now make predictions</p>
<p>based on that simulation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>These are like little solar systems</p>
<p>that we can simulate on the computer</p>
<p>and imagine their motions.</p>
<p>But we are pushing things</p>
<p>to the very limits of what&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s double-edged sword.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both incredibly exciting intellectually,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re always risking, to some degree,</p>
<p>the pushing too far.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to ask you about the recent paper</p>
<p>you coauthored,</p>
<p>an exomoon survey of 70 cool giant exoplanets</p>
<p>and the new candidate Kepler 1708 Bi.</p>
<p>I would say there&rsquo;s like three or four candidates</p>
<p>at this point,</p>
<p>of which we have published two of them.</p>
<p>And to me, two are quite compelling</p>
<p>and deserve follow-up observations.</p>
<p>And so to get a confirmed detection,</p>
<p>at least in our case,</p>
<p>we would need to see it repeat, for sure.</p>
<p>One of the problems with some of the other methods</p>
<p>that have been proposed</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t get that repeatability.</p>
<p>So for instance, an example of a technique</p>
<p>that would lack that</p>
<p>would be gravitational microlensing.</p>
<p>So it is possible with a new telescope</p>
<p>coming up in the future</p>
<p>called the Roman Space Telescope,</p>
<p>which is basically a repurpose by satellite</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the size of the Hubble mirror</p>
<p>going up into space.</p>
<p>It will stare at millions of stars simultaneously</p>
<p>and it will look to see,</p>
<p>instead of whether any of those stars</p>
<p>get dimmer for a short amount of time,</p>
<p>which would be a transit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll look for the opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll look to see if anything can get brighter.</p>
<p>And that brightness increase</p>
<p>is caused by another planetary system passing in front</p>
<p>and then gravitationally lensing light around it</p>
<p>to cause a brightening.</p>
<p>This is a method of discovering an entire solar system,</p>
<p>but only for a glimpse.</p>
<p>You just get a short glimpse of it</p>
<p>passing like a ship sailing through the night,</p>
<p>just that one photo of it.</p>
<p>Now the problem with that is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>The physics of gravitational lensing</p>
<p>are not surprisingly quite complicated.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s many, many possible solutions.</p>
<p>So you might have a solution</p>
<p>which is this could be a red dwarf star</p>
<p>with a Jupiter-like planet around it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one solution.</p>
<p>But another solution is that it&rsquo;s a free-floating planet,</p>
<p>a rogue planet like Jupiter</p>
<p>with an Earth-like moon around it.</p>
<p>And those two solutions are almost indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Now, ideally, we would be able to repeat the observation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be able to go back and see,</p>
<p>well, if the moon really is there,</p>
<p>then we could predict its mass,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s predicted its motion</p>
<p>and expect it to be maybe over here next time or something.</p>
<p>With microlensing, it&rsquo;s a one snapshot event.</p>
<p>And so, for me, it&rsquo;s intriguing</p>
<p>as a way of revealing something</p>
<p>about the exomoon population.</p>
<p>But I always come back to transits</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the only method we really have</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely repeatable,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll be able to come back and prove everyone,</p>
<p>prove to everyone that, look,</p>
<p>on the 17th of October, the moon will be over here</p>
<p>and the moon will look like this</p>
<p>and we can actually capture that image.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we see with, of course, many exoplanets.</p>
<p>So we wanna get to that same point of full confidence,</p>
<p>full confirmation, the slam-dunk detection</p>
<p>of these exomoons.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s been a hell of a journey</p>
<p>to try and push the field into that direction.</p>
<p>Is there some resistance to the transit method?</p>
<p>Not to the transit method, I just say to exomoons.</p>
<p>So the transit method is by far the most popular method</p>
<p>for looking for exoplanets.</p>
<p>But yeah, as I&rsquo;ve alluded to,</p>
<p>exomoons is kind of a niche topic</p>
<p>within the discipline of exoplanets.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s largely because there are people,</p>
<p>I think, are waiting for those slam-dunks.</p>
<p>And it was like the,</p>
<p>if you go back to the first exoplanet discovery</p>
<p>that was made in 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s true at the time</p>
<p>that they were seen as mavericks,</p>
<p>that the idea of looking for planets around stars</p>
<p>was considered fringe science.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure many colleagues told them,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you do something more safe,</p>
<p>like study eclipsing stars?</p>
<p>There are two binary star systems, we know those exist.</p>
<p>So why are you wasting your time looking for planets?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get this alien moniker or something,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be seen as a fringe maverick scientist.</p>
<p>And so I think it was quite difficult</p>
<p>for those early planet hunters to get legitimacy</p>
<p>and be taken seriously.</p>
<p>And so very few people risked their careers to do it,</p>
<p>except for those that were either emboldened to try</p>
<p>or had maybe the career, maybe like tenure or something,</p>
<p>so they didn&rsquo;t have to necessarily worry</p>
<p>about the implications of failure.</p>
<p>And so once that happened,</p>
<p>once they made the first discoveries,</p>
<p>overnight, everyone and their dog</p>
<p>was getting into exoplanets,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden the whole astronomy community shifted</p>
<p>and huge numbers of people</p>
<p>that were once upon a time studying eclipsing binaries</p>
<p>changed to becoming exoplanet scientists.</p>
<p>And so that was the first wave of exoplanet scientists.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now in a kind of a second wave,</p>
<p>or maybe a third wave,</p>
<p>where people like me to some degree</p>
<p>grew up with the idea of exoplanets as being normal.</p>
<p>I was 11 years old, I guess,</p>
<p>when the first exoplanet was discovered.</p>
<p>And so to me, it was a fairly normal idea to grow up with.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve been trained in exoplanets</p>
<p>from the very beginning.</p>
<p>And so that brings a different perspective</p>
<p>to those who have maybe transitioned</p>
<p>from a different career path.</p>
<p>And so I suspect with exomoons</p>
<p>and probably technosignatures, astrobiology,</p>
<p>many of the topics which are seen</p>
<p>at the fringes of what&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>they will all open up into becoming mainstream one day.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of people who are just waiting,</p>
<p>waiting for that assuredness</p>
<p>that there is a secure career net ahead of them</p>
<p>before they commit.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does seem to me that exomoons open wider</p>
<p>or open for the first time the door to aliens.</p>
<p>So more seriously, academically studying,</p>
<p>all right, let&rsquo;s look at alien worlds.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s still pretty fringe</p>
<p>to talk about alien life,</p>
<p>even on Mars and the moons and so on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of like, it would be nice,</p>
<p>but imagine the first time you discover a living organism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna change.</p>
<p>Then everybody will look like an idiot</p>
<p>for not focusing everything on this.</p>
<p>Because the possibility of the things will,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible it might be super boring.</p>
<p>It might be very boring bacteria.</p>
<p>But even the existence of life elsewhere,</p>
<p>I mean, that changes everything.</p>
<p>That means life is everywhere.</p>
<p>If you knew now that in five years, 10 years,</p>
<p>the first life would be discovered elsewhere,</p>
<p>you knew that in advance,</p>
<p>it would surely affect the way</p>
<p>you approach your entire career.</p>
<p>Especially someone junior in astronomy,</p>
<p>you would surely be like,</p>
<p>well, this is clearly gonna be the direction</p>
<p>I have to dedicate my classes and my training</p>
<p>and my education towards that direction.</p>
<p>All the new textbooks, all the-</p>
<p>You have to be written.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of value to hedging,</p>
<p>like allocating some of the time to that possibility.</p>
<p>Because the kind of discoveries we might get</p>
<p>in the next few decades,</p>
<p>it feels like we&rsquo;re on the verge of a lot of,</p>
<p>getting a lot of really good data</p>
<p>and having better and better tools</p>
<p>that can process that data.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just going to be a continuous increase</p>
<p>of the kind of discoveries that will open.</p>
<p>But a slam dunk, that&rsquo;s hard to come by.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think a lot of us are anticipating,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re already seeing it to some degree</p>
<p>with Venus and the phosphine incident.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve seen it before with Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the White House lawn announcing life from Mars.</p>
<p>And there are inevitably gonna be spurious claims,</p>
<p>or at least claims which are ambiguous to some degree.</p>
<p>There will be, for sure, a high profile journal,</p>
<p>like Nature or Science, that will one day publish a paper</p>
<p>saying, by a signature discovered or something like that</p>
<p>on Trappist-1 or some other planet.</p>
<p>And then there will be years of back and forth</p>
<p>in the literature.</p>
<p>And that might seem frustrating,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s how science works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the mechanism of science at play,</p>
<p>of people scrutinizing the results</p>
<p>to intense skepticism.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a crucible.</p>
<p>You burn away all irrelevances</p>
<p>until whatever is left is the truth.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re left with this product,</p>
<p>which is that, okay, we either believe or don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that bite signatures are there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s inevitably gonna be a lot of controversy</p>
<p>and debate and argument about it.</p>
<p>We just have to anticipate that.</p>
<p>And so I think you have to basically have a thick skin,</p>
<p>to some degree, academically, to dive into that world.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re seeing that with phosphine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been uncomfortable to watch from the outside</p>
<p>the kind of dialogue that some of the scientists</p>
<p>have been having with each other about that, because-</p>
<p>They get a little aggressive.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you can understand why, because-</p>
<p>Jealousy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s me saying, not you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s me talking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some envy and jealousy involved</p>
<p>on the behalf of those who are not part</p>
<p>of the original discovery.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also, in any case,</p>
<p>just leave the particular people involved in Venus alone,</p>
<p>in any case of making a claim of that magnitude,</p>
<p>especially life, because life is pretty much</p>
<p>one of the biggest discoveries of all time,</p>
<p>you can imagine, scientifically, you can see,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so conscious of this in myself,</p>
<p>when I get close to, as I said,</p>
<p>even the much smaller goal of setting an exomoon,</p>
<p>the ego creep in.</p>
<p>And so, as a scientist, we have to be so guarded</p>
<p>against our own egos.</p>
<p>You see the lights in your eyes of a Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>or the fame and fortune and being remembered</p>
<p>in the history books, and we all grew up in our training,</p>
<p>learning about Newton and Einstein,</p>
<p>these giants of the field, Feynman, Maxwell,</p>
<p>and you get the idea of these individual contributions</p>
<p>which get immortalized for all time, and that&rsquo;s seductive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why many of us with the skillset</p>
<p>to go into maybe banking instead decided,</p>
<p>actually, there&rsquo;s something about the idea</p>
<p>of being immortalized and contributing towards society</p>
<p>in a permanent way that is more attractive</p>
<p>than the financial reward of applying my skills elsewhere.</p>
<p>So, to some degree, that ego can be a benefit,</p>
<p>because it brings in skillful people into our field</p>
<p>who might otherwise be tempted by money elsewhere.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, the closer you get</p>
<p>towards when you start flirting</p>
<p>with that Nobel Prize in your eyes,</p>
<p>or you think you&rsquo;re on the verge of seeing something,</p>
<p>you can lose objectivity.</p>
<p>A very famous example of this is Barnard&rsquo;s Star.</p>
<p>There was a planet claimed there by Peter van de Kamp,</p>
<p>I think it was in 1968, 69, and at the time,</p>
<p>it would have been the first ever exoplanet ever claimed.</p>
<p>And he felt assured that this planet was there.</p>
<p>He was actually using the wobbling star method,</p>
<p>but using the positions of the stars</p>
<p>to see them to claim this exoplanet.</p>
<p>It turned out that this planet was not there.</p>
<p>Subsequent analyses by both dynamicists and theorists</p>
<p>and those looking at the instrumental data</p>
<p>established fairly unanimously</p>
<p>that there was no way this planet was really there.</p>
<p>But Peter van de Kamp insisted it was there,</p>
<p>despite overwhelming evidence</p>
<p>that was accruing against him.</p>
<p>And even to the day he died,</p>
<p>which was I think in the early 90s,</p>
<p>he was still insisting this planet was there,</p>
<p>even when we were starting to make</p>
<p>the first genuine exoplanet discoveries.</p>
<p>And even at that point, I think Hubble</p>
<p>had even looked at that star</p>
<p>and had totally ruled out any possibility</p>
<p>of what he was talking about.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>How do you get to a point as a scientist</p>
<p>where you just can&rsquo;t accept</p>
<p>anything that comes otherwise?</p>
<p>Because it starts out with the dream of fame,</p>
<p>and then it ends in a stubborn refusal to ever back down.</p>
<p>Of course, the flip side of that</p>
<p>is sometimes you need that to have the strength</p>
<p>to carry a belief against the entire scientific community</p>
<p>that resists your beliefs.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>That can happen, but I guess the distinction here</p>
<p>is evidence.</p>
<p>So in this case, the evidence was so overwhelming,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t really a matter of interpretation.</p>
<p>It was, you had to collect,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d observe this star with the same star,</p>
<p>but with maybe 10, even 100 times greater precision</p>
<p>for prolonged, much longer periods of time.</p>
<p>And there was just no doubt at this point</p>
<p>this planet was a mirage.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you have to be very careful.</p>
<p>I always say, don&rsquo;t ever name my wife and my daughter,</p>
<p>name this planet after me that you discover.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I can&rsquo;t ever name a planet after you</p>
<p>because I won&rsquo;t be objective anymore.</p>
<p>How could I ever turn around to you</p>
<p>and say that planet wasn&rsquo;t real that I named after you?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re somebody that talks about,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clear in your eyes and in your way of being,</p>
<p>that you love the process of discovery,</p>
<p>that joy, the magic of just, you know,</p>
<p>seeing something, a new observation, a new idea, right?</p>
<p>But I guess the point is, when you have that great feeling,</p>
<p>is to then switch on the skepticism,</p>
<p>like to start testing, what does this actually mean?</p>
<p>Is this real?</p>
<p>What are the possible different interpretations</p>
<p>that could make this a lot less grand</p>
<p>than I first imagined?</p>
<p>So both have the wonder and the skepticism all in one brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think generally the more I want something to be true,</p>
<p>the more I inherently doubt it.</p>
<p>I grew up with a religious family</p>
<p>and was just sort of indoctrinated to some degree,</p>
<p>like many children are, that, okay, this is normal,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a God and this is the way the world is.</p>
<p>God created the Earth.</p>
<p>And then as I became more well-read and illiterate</p>
<p>of what was happening in the world scientifically,</p>
<p>I started to doubt.</p>
<p>And it really just struck me</p>
<p>that the hardest thing to let go of</p>
<p>when you do decide not to be religious anymore,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not really like a light bulb moment,</p>
<p>but it just kind of happens over sort of 11 to 13,</p>
<p>I think for me it was happening.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s that sadness of letting go of this beautiful dream,</p>
<p>which you had in your mind of eternal life,</p>
<p>for behaving yourself on Earth,</p>
<p>you would have this beautiful heaven</p>
<p>that you could go to and live forever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very attractive.</p>
<p>And for me personally,</p>
<p>that was one of the things that pulled me against it,</p>
<p>was this, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s too good to be true.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very convenient that this could be so.</p>
<p>And I have no evidence directly</p>
<p>in terms of a scientific sense to support this hypothesis.</p>
<p>And it just became really difficult</p>
<p>to reconcile my growth as a scientist.</p>
<p>And I know some people find that reconciliation.</p>
<p>I have not.</p>
<p>Maybe I will one day.</p>
<p>But as a general guiding principle,</p>
<p>which I think I obtained from that experience,</p>
<p>was that I have to be extremely guarded</p>
<p>about what I want to be true,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to sway me to say things</p>
<p>which are not true if I&rsquo;m not careful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re trying to do as scientists.</p>
<p>So you felt from a religious perspective</p>
<p>that there was a little bit of a gravitational field</p>
<p>in terms of your opinions,</p>
<p>like it was affecting how you could be as a scientist.</p>
<p>Like as a scientific thinker, obviously, you were young.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>that whenever there&rsquo;s something you want to be true,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the ultimate seduction intellectually.</p>
<p>And I worry about this a lot with UFOs and with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true already with things like Venus,</p>
<p>phosphine and searching for astrobiological signals.</p>
<p>We have to guard against this all the way through</p>
<p>from however we&rsquo;re looking for life,</p>
<p>however we&rsquo;re looking for whatever this big question is.</p>
<p>There is a part of us,</p>
<p>I think I would love there to be life in the universe.</p>
<p>I hope there is life in the universe,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m somewhat been on record several times</p>
<p>as being fairly firm about trying to remain consciously</p>
<p>agnostic about that question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make up my mind about what the answer is</p>
<p>before I&rsquo;ve collected evidence to inform that decision.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how science should work.</p>
<p>If I already know what the answer is,</p>
<p>then what am I doing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a scientific experiment anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already decided, so what are you trying to learn?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of doing the experiment</p>
<p>if you already know what the answer is?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so complicated because,</p>
<p>so if I&rsquo;m being honest with myself,</p>
<p>when I imagine the universe,</p>
<p>so first thing I imagine about our world</p>
<p>is that we humans and me certainly</p>
<p>as one particular human know very,</p>
<p>my first assumption is I know almost nothing</p>
<p>about how anything works.</p>
<p>So first of all, that actually applies</p>
<p>for things that humans do know,</p>
<p>like quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>all the things that there&rsquo;s different expertises</p>
<p>that I just have not dedicated to.</p>
<p>So even that&rsquo;s starting point.</p>
<p>But if we take all of knowledge as human civilization,</p>
<p>we know almost nothing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of an assumption I have</p>
<p>because it seems like we keep discovering mysteries</p>
<p>and it seems like history,</p>
<p>human history is defined by moments when we said,</p>
<p>okay, we pretty much figured it all out</p>
<p>and then you realize a century later,</p>
<p>when you said that, you didn&rsquo;t figure out anything.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s like a starting point.</p>
<p>The second thing I have is I feel like</p>
<p>the entirety of the universe is just filled</p>
<p>with alien civilizations.</p>
<p>Statistically, there&rsquo;s the important thing</p>
<p>that enables that belief for me</p>
<p>is that they don&rsquo;t have to be human-like.</p>
<p>They can be anything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the fact that life exists</p>
<p>and just seeing the way life is on Earth,</p>
<p>that it just finds a way.</p>
<p>It finds a way in so many different complicated environments.</p>
<p>It finds a way.</p>
<p>Whatever that force is,</p>
<p>that same force has to find a way elsewhere also.</p>
<p>But then if I&rsquo;m also being honest,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many hours in a day I spend</p>
<p>seriously considering the possibility that we&rsquo;re alone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when my heart is in mind</p>
<p>or filled with wonder,</p>
<p>I think about all the different life that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>But to really imagine that we&rsquo;re alone,</p>
<p>really imagine all the vastness that&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re alone, not even bacteria.</p>
<p>I would say you don&rsquo;t have to believe that we are alone,</p>
<p>but you have to admit it&rsquo;s a possibility</p>
<p>of our ignorance of the universe so far.</p>
<p>You can have a belief about something</p>
<p>in the absence of evidence.</p>
<p>And Carl Sagan famously described that</p>
<p>as the definition of faith.</p>
<p>If you believe something when there&rsquo;s no evidence,</p>
<p>you have faith that there&rsquo;s life in the universe.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t demonstrate,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t prove it mathematically,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t show me evidence of that.</p>
<p>Is there some, so mathematically, math is a funny thing,</p>
<p>is there, I mean, the way physicists think, like intuition,</p>
<p>so basic reasoning, is there some value to that?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re always,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certainly, you can certainly make</p>
<p>a very good argument,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve kind of already made one,</p>
<p>just the vastness of the universe</p>
<p>is the default argument people often turn to,</p>
<p>that surely there should be others out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine.</p>
<p>There are of order of 10 to the 22 stars</p>
<p>in our observable universe.</p>
<p>And so, really the question comes down to</p>
<p>what is the probability of one of those</p>
<p>10 to the 22 planets, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>Earth-like planets, if they all have Earth-like planets,</p>
<p>going on to form life, spontaneously?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the process of abiogenesis,</p>
<p>the spontaneous emergence of life.</p>
<p>Also, the word spontaneous is a funny one.</p>
<p>Well, okay, maybe we won&rsquo;t use spontaneous,</p>
<p>but not being, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>seeded by, say, some other civilization</p>
<p>or something like that, it naturally emerges.</p>
<p>Because even the word spontaneous</p>
<p>makes it seem less likely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s just this chemistry</p>
<p>and an extremely random process.</p>
<p>Right, it could be a very gradual process</p>
<p>over millions of years of growing complexity</p>
<p>in chemical networks.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a force in the universe</p>
<p>that pushes it towards interesting complexity,</p>
<p>pockets of complexity,</p>
<p>that ultimately creates something like life</p>
<p>which we can&rsquo;t possibly define yet.</p>
<p>And sometimes it manifests itself</p>
<p>into something that looks like humans.</p>
<p>But it could be a totally different</p>
<p>kind of computational information processing system</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re too dumb to even visualize.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, certainly,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of weird</p>
<p>that complexity develops at all, right?</p>
<p>Because it seems like the opposite</p>
<p>to our physical intuition,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re training in physics,</p>
<p>of entropy, that things should,</p>
<p>complexity&rsquo;s hard to spontaneously,</p>
<p>or I shouldn&rsquo;t say spontaneously,</p>
<p>but hard to emerge in general.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an interesting problem.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>certainly from an evolutionary perspective,</p>
<p>you do see growing complexity.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a nice argument,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s by Gould,</p>
<p>who shows that if you have</p>
<p>a certain amount of complexity,</p>
<p>it can either become less complex</p>
<p>or more complex through random mutation.</p>
<p>And the less complex things</p>
<p>are stripping away something,</p>
<p>something that was necessary,</p>
<p>potentially, to their survival.</p>
<p>And so in general,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be not particularly useful</p>
<p>in its survival.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s gonna be detrimental</p>
<p>to strip away a significant amount</p>
<p>of its useful traits.</p>
<p>Whereas if you add something,</p>
<p>the most typical thing that you add</p>
<p>is probably not useful at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably just,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really affect its survival negatively,</p>
<p>but neither does it provide any significant benefit.</p>
<p>But sometimes, on rare occasions, of course,</p>
<p>it will be of benefit.</p>
<p>And so if you have a certain level of complexity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to go back in complexity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fairly easy to go forward</p>
<p>with enough bites at the cherry.</p>
<p>You will eventually build up in complexity.</p>
<p>And that tends to be why we see complexity</p>
<p>grow in, certainly in an evolutionary sense,</p>
<p>but also perhaps it&rsquo;s operating</p>
<p>in chemical networks</p>
<p>that led to the emergence of life.</p>
<p>I guess the real problem I have</p>
<p>with the numbers game,</p>
<p>just to come back to that,</p>
<p>is that we are talking about</p>
<p>a certain probability of that occurring.</p>
<p>It may be to go from the primordial soup,</p>
<p>however you want to call it,</p>
<p>the ingredients that the earth started with,</p>
<p>the organic molecules,</p>
<p>the probability of going from that initial condition</p>
<p>to something that was capable</p>
<p>of Darwinian natural selection</p>
<p>that maybe we could define as life,</p>
<p>the probability of that is maybe 1%,</p>
<p>1% of the time that happens,</p>
<p>in which case you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The universe will be absolutely teeming with life,</p>
<p>but it could also be 10 to the power of minus 10,</p>
<p>in which case it&rsquo;s one per galaxy,</p>
<p>or 10 to the power of minus 100,</p>
<p>in which case the vast majority of universes even</p>
<p>do not have life within it.</p>
<p>Or 90%.</p>
<p>Or 90%.</p>
<p>You said 1%,</p>
<p>but it could be 90% if the conditions,</p>
<p>the chemical conditions of a planet are correct</p>
<p>or a moon are correct.</p>
<p>I admit that.</p>
<p>It could be any of those numbers.</p>
<p>And the challenge is we just have no rigorous reason</p>
<p>to expect why 90% is any,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about a probability for probability.</p>
<p>Is 90% more a priori likely</p>
<p>than 10 to the power of minus 20?</p>
<p>Well, the thing is,</p>
<p>we do have an observation, N of one, of Earth.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s difficult to know what to do with that,</p>
<p>what kind of intuition you build on top of that,</p>
<p>because on Earth, it seems like life finds a way</p>
<p>in all kinds of conditions,</p>
<p>in all kinds of crazy conditions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s able to build up from the basic chemistry.</p>
<p>You could say, okay, maybe it takes a little bit of time</p>
<p>to develop some complicated technology,</p>
<p>like mitochondria, I don&rsquo;t know, like photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Fine, but it seems to figure it out</p>
<p>and do it extremely well.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I would say you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>a different process.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe I&rsquo;m at fault</p>
<p>for separating these two processes,</p>
<p>but to me, you&rsquo;re describing basically natural selection</p>
<p>evolution at that point.</p>
<p>Whereas I&rsquo;m really describing abiogenesis,</p>
<p>which is, to me, a separate distinct process.</p>
<p>To you, limited to human scientists, yes,</p>
<p>but why would it be a separate process?</p>
<p>Why is the birth of life a separate process</p>
<p>from the process of life?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re uncomfortable with the Big Bang.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re uncomfortable with the first thing, I think.</p>
<p>Like, where does this come from?</p>
<p>Right, so I think I would say,</p>
<p>I just twist that question around and say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying, why is it a different process?</p>
<p>And I would say, why shouldn&rsquo;t it be a different process?</p>
<p>Which isn&rsquo;t really a good defense,</p>
<p>except to say that we have knowledge</p>
<p>of how natural selection evolution works.</p>
<p>We think we understand that process.</p>
<p>We have almost no information about the earlier stages</p>
<p>of how life emerged on our planet.</p>
<p>It may be that you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>and it is a part of a continuum.</p>
<p>It may be that it is also a distinct,</p>
<p>improbable set of circumstances</p>
<p>that led to the emergence of life.</p>
<p>As a scientist, I&rsquo;m just trying to be open-minded</p>
<p>to both possibilities.</p>
<p>If I assert that life must be everywhere,</p>
<p>to me, you run the risk of experimenter&rsquo;s bias.</p>
<p>If you think you know what the answer is,</p>
<p>if you look at an Earth-like planet,</p>
<p>and you are preconditioned to think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a 90% chance of life on this planet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to, at some level,</p>
<p>affect your interpretation of that data.</p>
<p>Whereas if I, however critical you might be</p>
<p>of the agnosticism that I impose upon myself,</p>
<p>remain open to both possibilities,</p>
<p>then I trust in myself to make a fair assessment</p>
<p>as to the reality of that evidence for life.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I wonder, sort of scientifically,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really beautiful to hear,</p>
<p>and inspiring to hear.</p>
<p>I wonder scientifically how many firsts we truly know of,</p>
<p>and then we don&rsquo;t eventually explain</p>
<p>as actually a step number one million in a long process.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a really interesting thing</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s truly firsts in this universe.</p>
<p>For us, whatever happened at the Big Bang</p>
<p>is a kind of first, the origin of stuff.</p>
<p>Again, it seems like history shows</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll figure out</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s actually a continuation of something.</p>
<p>But then physicists say that time is emergent,</p>
<p>and that our causality in time</p>
<p>is a very human kind of construct,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very possible that all of this,</p>
<p>so there could be really firsts</p>
<p>of a thing to which we attach a name.</p>
<p>So whatever we call life, maybe there is an origin of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I would also say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to the idea of it being part of a continuation,</p>
<p>but the continuation maybe is more broader,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a continuation of chemical systems</p>
<p>and chemical networks.</p>
<p>And what we call this one particular type of chemistry</p>
<p>in this behavior of chemistry life,</p>
<p>but it is just one manifestation</p>
<p>of all the trillions of possible permutations</p>
<p>in which chemical reactions can occur.</p>
<p>And we assert specialness to it,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what we are.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s also true of intelligence.</p>
<p>You could extend the same thing</p>
<p>and say we&rsquo;re looking for intelligent life in the universe,</p>
<p>and then you sort of, where do you define intelligence?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s that continuum of something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really like us, are we alone?</p>
<p>There may be a continuum of chemical systems,</p>
<p>a continuum of intelligences out there,</p>
<p>and we have to be careful of our own arrogance</p>
<p>of assuming specialness about what we are,</p>
<p>that we are some distinct category of phenomena,</p>
<p>whereas the universe doesn&rsquo;t really care</p>
<p>about what category we are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just doing what it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>and doing everything in infinite diversity</p>
<p>and infinite combinations is essentially what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>And so we are taking this one slice and saying,</p>
<p>no, this has to be treated separately.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m open to the idea</p>
<p>that it could be a truly separate phenomenon,</p>
<p>but it may just be like a snowflake.</p>
<p>Every snowflake&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>It may just be that this one particular,</p>
<p>iteration is another variant of the vast continuum.</p>
<p>And maybe the algorithm of natural selection itself</p>
<p>is an invention of earth.</p>
<p>I kind of also tend to suspect that this,</p>
<p>whatever the algorithm is,</p>
<p>it kind of operates at all levels throughout the universe.</p>
<p>But maybe this is a very kind of peculiar thing</p>
<p>that where there&rsquo;s a bunch of chemical systems</p>
<p>that compete against each other,</p>
<p>somehow for survival under limited resources.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very earth-like thing.</p>
<p>We have a nice balance of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a large number of resources,</p>
<p>enough to have a bunch of different kinds</p>
<p>of systems competing,</p>
<p>but not so many that they get lazy.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s why bacteria</p>
<p>were very lazy for a long time.</p>
<p>Maybe they didn&rsquo;t have much competition.</p>
<p>Quite possibly.</p>
<p>I mean, I tried to,</p>
<p>as fun as it is to get into the speculation</p>
<p>about the definitions of life</p>
<p>and what life does</p>
<p>and this gross network of possibilities.</p>
<p>Honestly, for me,</p>
<p>the strongest argument for remaining agnostic</p>
<p>is to avoid that bias in assessing data.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>I mean, Percival Lowell,</p>
<p>I talked about on my channel maybe last year</p>
<p>or two years ago,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a very famous astronomer who in the 19th century</p>
<p>was claiming the evidence of canals on Mars.</p>
<p>And from him, from his perspective,</p>
<p>and even at the time, culturally,</p>
<p>it was widely accepted that Mars would,</p>
<p>of course, have life.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it seems silly to us,</p>
<p>but it was kind of similar arguments</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;re using now about exoplanets,</p>
<p>that, well, of course there must be life in the universe.</p>
<p>How could it just be here?</p>
<p>And so it seemed obvious to people</p>
<p>that when you looked at Mars with its polar caps,</p>
<p>even its atmosphere, had seasons,</p>
<p>it seemed obvious to them</p>
<p>that that too would be a place</p>
<p>where life not only was present,</p>
<p>but had emerged to a civilization,</p>
<p>which actually was fairly comparable</p>
<p>in technology to our own,</p>
<p>because it was building canal systems.</p>
<p>Of course, a canal system</p>
<p>seems a bizarre technosignature to us,</p>
<p>but it was a product of their time.</p>
<p>To them, that was the cutting edge in technology.</p>
<p>It should be a warning shot, actually,</p>
<p>a little bit for us,</p>
<p>that if we think solar panels or building star links</p>
<p>or whatever, space mining</p>
<p>is like an inevitable technosignature,</p>
<p>that may be laughably antiquated</p>
<p>compared to what other civilizations</p>
<p>far more advanced than us may be doing.</p>
<p>And so anyway, Percival Lowell,</p>
<p>he, I think, was a product of his time</p>
<p>that he thought life was there.</p>
<p>Inevitably, he even wrote about it extensively.</p>
<p>And so when he saw these lines,</p>
<p>these lineae on the surface of Mars,</p>
<p>to him, it was just obvious they were canals.</p>
<p>And that was experimenters&rsquo; bias playing out.</p>
<p>He was told, for one,</p>
<p>that he had basically the greatest eyesight</p>
<p>out of any of his peers.</p>
<p>An ophthalmologist had told him that in Boston,</p>
<p>that his eyesight was absolutely spectacular.</p>
<p>So he just was convinced everything he saw was real.</p>
<p>And secondly, he was convinced there was life there.</p>
<p>And so to him, it just added up.</p>
<p>And then that kind of wasted decades of research,</p>
<p>of treating the idea of Mars being inhabited</p>
<p>by this canal civilization.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it&rsquo;s maybe not a waste</p>
<p>because it is a lesson in history</p>
<p>of how we should be always on guard</p>
<p>against our own preconceptions and biases</p>
<p>about whether life is out there.</p>
<p>And furthermore, what types of things life might do</p>
<p>if it is there.</p>
<p>If I were running this simulation,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll also talk about</p>
<p>because you make the case against it,</p>
<p>but if I were running a simulation,</p>
<p>I would definitely put you in a room with an alien</p>
<p>and just to see you mentally freak out for hours at a time.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>You for sure would have thought</p>
<p>you will be convinced that you&rsquo;ve lost your mind.</p>
<p>I mean, no, not that.</p>
<p>But I mean, if we discover life,</p>
<p>we discover interesting new physical phenomena,</p>
<p>I think the right approach is definitely</p>
<p>to be extremely skeptical and be very, very careful</p>
<p>about things you want to be true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really admirable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not some extreme denialist of evidence.</p>
<p>If there was compelling evidence</p>
<p>for life on another planet,</p>
<p>I would be the first one to be celebrating that</p>
<p>and be shaking hands with the alien</p>
<p>on the White House lawn or whatever.</p>
<p>I grew up with Star Trek and that was my fantasy</p>
<p>was to be Captain Kirk</p>
<p>and fly across the stars meeting other civilizations.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing more I&rsquo;d want to be true as I&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>but we just have to guard against it</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re assessing data.</p>
<p>But I have to say I&rsquo;m very skeptical</p>
<p>that we will ever have that Star Trek moment.</p>
<p>Even if there are other civilizations out there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re never gonna be at a point</p>
<p>which is in technological lockstep with us,</p>
<p>similar level of development,</p>
<p>even intellectually the idea</p>
<p>that they could have a conversation with us</p>
<p>even through a translator.</p>
<p>I mean, we can&rsquo;t communicate with humpback whales.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t communicate with dolphins in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>We can sort of bark orders at them,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t have abstract conversations</p>
<p>with them about things.</p>
<p>And so the idea that we will ever have</p>
<p>that fulfilling conversation, I&rsquo;m deeply skeptical of.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of us are drawn to that.</p>
<p>I think it is maybe a replacement for God to some degree,</p>
<p>that Father figure civilization that might step in,</p>
<p>teach us the air of our ways</p>
<p>and bestow wisdom upon our civilization.</p>
<p>But they could equally be a giant fungus</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t even understand the idea of socialization</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the only entity on its planet.</p>
<p>It just swells over the entire surface.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s incredibly intelligent</p>
<p>because maybe each node communicates with each other</p>
<p>to create essentially a giant neural net.</p>
<p>But it has no sense of what communication even is.</p>
<p>And so alien life is out there,</p>
<p>surely can be extremely diverse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty skeptical that we&rsquo;ll ever get</p>
<p>that fantasy moment I always had as a kid</p>
<p>of having a dialogue within the civilization.</p>
<p>So dialogue, yes.</p>
<p>What about noticing them?</p>
<p>What about noticing signals?</p>
<p>Do you hope&hellip;</p>
<p>So one thing we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>is getting signatures, biosignatures,</p>
<p>technosignatures about other planets.</p>
<p>Maybe if we&rsquo;re extremely lucky in our lifetime</p>
<p>to be able to meet life forms,</p>
<p>get evidence of living or dead life forms on Mars</p>
<p>or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
<p>What about getting signals from outer space,</p>
<p>interstellar signals?</p>
<p>What would those signals potentially look like?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard question to answer</p>
<p>because we are essentially engaging in xenopsychology</p>
<p>to some degree.</p>
<p>What are the activities of another civilization?</p>
<p>A lot of that is inevitable.</p>
<p>What does the word xenopsychology,</p>
<p>I apologize to interrupt, mean?</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just fabricating that word, really,</p>
<p>but trying to guess at the machinations</p>
<p>and motivations of another intelligent being</p>
<p>that was completely evolutionary divorced from us.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like you said, exo-moons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exopsychology, extrasolar psychology.</p>
<p>Yeah, alien psychology is another way</p>
<p>of maybe making it more grounded.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t really guess at their motivations too well,</p>
<p>but we can look at the sorts of behaviors we engage in</p>
<p>and at least look for them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always guilty that when we look for biosignatures,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really looking for,</p>
<p>and even when we look for planets,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking for templates of Earth.</p>
<p>When we look for biosignatures,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking for templates of Earth-based life.</p>
<p>When we look for tetanus signatures,</p>
<p>we tend to be looking for templates of our own behaviors</p>
<p>or extrapolations of our behaviors.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a very long list of tetanus signatures</p>
<p>that people have suggested we could look for.</p>
<p>The earliest ones were, of course, radio beacons.</p>
<p>That was sort of Project Osma</p>
<p>that Frank Drake was involved in,</p>
<p>trying to look for radio signatures,</p>
<p>which could either be just like blurting out</p>
<p>high-power radio signals saying, hey, we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>or could even have encoded within them</p>
<p>galactic encyclopedias for us to unlock,</p>
<p>which has always been the allure of the radio technique.</p>
<p>But there could also be unintentional signatures.</p>
<p>For example, you could have something</p>
<p>like the satellite system that we&rsquo;ve produced</p>
<p>around the Earth, the artificial satellite system,</p>
<p>Starlink-type systems we mentioned.</p>
<p>You could detect the glint of light across those satellites</p>
<p>as they orbit around the planet.</p>
<p>You could detect a geostationary satellite belt,</p>
<p>which would block out some light</p>
<p>as the planet transited across the star.</p>
<p>You could detect solar panels,</p>
<p>potentially spectrally, on the surface of the planet.</p>
<p>Heat island effects.</p>
<p>New York is hotter than New York State</p>
<p>by a couple of degrees</p>
<p>because of the heat island effect of the city.</p>
<p>And so you could thermally map different planets</p>
<p>and detect these.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a large array of things that we do</p>
<p>that we can go out and hypothesize we could look for.</p>
<p>And then on the furthest end of the scale,</p>
<p>you have things which go far beyond our capabilities,</p>
<p>such as warp drive signatures, which have been proposed.</p>
<p>You get these bright flashes of light</p>
<p>or even gravitational wave detections</p>
<p>from LIGO could be detected.</p>
<p>You could have Dyson spheres.</p>
<p>The idea of covering, basically,</p>
<p>a star&rsquo;s completely covered by some kind of structure</p>
<p>which collects all the light from the star</p>
<p>to power the civilization.</p>
<p>And that would be pretty easily detectable to some degree</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re transferring all of the visible light.</p>
<p>Thermodynamically, it has to be re-emitted</p>
<p>so it would come out as infrared light.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have an incredibly bright infrared star,</p>
<p>yet one that was visibly not present at all.</p>
<p>And so that would be a pretty intriguing</p>
<p>signature to look for.</p>
<p>Well, is there efforts to look for something like that</p>
<p>for Dyson spheres out there</p>
<p>for the strong infrared signal?</p>
<p>There has been.</p>
<p>Yeah, there has been.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been, I think in the literature,</p>
<p>there was one with the IRAS satellite,</p>
<p>which is an infrared satellite.</p>
<p>They targeted, I think, of order of 100,000 stars,</p>
<p>nearby stars,</p>
<p>and found no convincing examples</p>
<p>of what looked like a Dyson sphere star.</p>
<p>And then Jason Wright and his team extended this,</p>
<p>I think, using WISE,</p>
<p>which is another infrared satellite,</p>
<p>to look around galaxies.</p>
<p>So could an entire galaxy have been converted</p>
<p>into Dyson spheres,</p>
<p>or a significant fraction of the galaxy?</p>
<p>Which is basically the Kardashev Type III, right?</p>
<p>This is when you&rsquo;ve basically mastered</p>
<p>the entire galactic pool of resources.</p>
<p>And again, out of 100,000 nearby galaxies,</p>
<p>there appears to be no compelling examples</p>
<p>of what looks like a Dyson galaxy,</p>
<p>if you want to call it that.</p>
<p>So that by no means proves that they don&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>but it seems like it&rsquo;s an unusual behavior</p>
<p>for a civilization to get to that stage of development</p>
<p>and start harvesting the entire stellar output.</p>
<p>Unusually, yes.</p>
<p>And I mean, LIGO is super interesting</p>
<p>with gravitational waves.</p>
<p>If that kind of experiment could start seeing some weirdness,</p>
<p>some weird signals that compare</p>
<p>to the power of cosmic phenomena.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a whole new window to the universe,</p>
<p>not just in terms of astrophysics,</p>
<p>but potentially for technosignatures as well.</p>
<p>I have to say, with the warp drives,</p>
<p>I am skeptical that warp drives are possible</p>
<p>because you have kind of a fundamental problem in relativity.</p>
<p>You can either really have relativity,</p>
<p>faster than light travel, or causality.</p>
<p>You can only choose two of those three things.</p>
<p>You really can&rsquo;t have all three in a coherent universe.</p>
<p>If you have all three,</p>
<p>you basically end up with the possibility</p>
<p>of these kind of temporal paradoxes</p>
<p>and time loops and grandfather paradoxes.</p>
<p>Well, can&rsquo;t there be pockets of causality?</p>
<p>Something like that?</p>
<p>Like where there&rsquo;s like pockets of consistent causality.</p>
<p>You could design it in that way.</p>
<p>You could be, you know,</p>
<p>if you had a warp drive or a time machine,</p>
<p>essentially you could be, you know,</p>
<p>you could be very conscious</p>
<p>and careful of the way you use it</p>
<p>so as to not to cause paradoxes</p>
<p>or just do it in a local area or something.</p>
<p>But the real fundamental problem is</p>
<p>you always have the ability to do it.</p>
<p>And so in a vast cosmic universe,</p>
<p>if time machines were all over the place,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much risk of someone doing it, right?</p>
<p>Of somebody having the option</p>
<p>of essentially breaking the universe with this.</p>
<p>So this is a fundamental problem.</p>
<p>Hawking has this chronology protection conjecture</p>
<p>where he said that essentially this just can&rsquo;t be allowed</p>
<p>because it breaks all our laws of physics</p>
<p>if time travel is possible.</p>
<p>Current laws of physics, yes.</p>
<p>Correct, yeah.</p>
<p>And so we need to rip up relativity.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the point is the current laws of physics.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have to rip up our current law of relativity</p>
<p>to make sense of how FTL could live in that universe</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t have relativity, FTL and causality</p>
<p>sit nicely and play nicely together.</p>
<p>But we currently don&rsquo;t have quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and relativity playing nice together anyway.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like everything is all a nice little fabric.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not the full picture.</p>
<p>There must be more to go.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s already ripped up,</p>
<p>so might as well rip it up a little more.</p>
<p>And in the process, actually try to connect the two things.</p>
<p>Because maybe in the unification of the standard model</p>
<p>and general relativity, maybe there lies</p>
<p>some kind of new wisdom about warp drives.</p>
<p>So by the way, warp drives is somehow messing</p>
<p>with the fabric of the universe</p>
<p>to be able to travel faster than the speed of light?</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re basically bending space-time.</p>
<p>You could also do it with a wormhole or a tachy.</p>
<p>Some of the hypothetical FTLs,</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t have to necessarily be the Alcubierre drive,</p>
<p>the warp drive.</p>
<p>It could be any faster than light system.</p>
<p>As long as it travels superluminally,</p>
<p>it will violate causality.</p>
<p>And presumably that will be observable with LIGO.</p>
<p>Potentially, yeah, potentially.</p>
<p>Depends on, I think, the properties</p>
<p>of whatever the spacecraft is.</p>
<p>I mean, one problem with warp drives is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of problems with warp drives.</p>
<p>But when it-</p>
<p>Like the start of that sentence,</p>
<p>one problem, the warp drive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just this one minor problem</p>
<p>that we have to get around.</p>
<p>But when it arrives at its destination,</p>
<p>it basically collects this vast,</p>
<p>basically has like an event horizon</p>
<p>almost at the front of it.</p>
<p>And so it collects all this radiation</p>
<p>at the front as it goes.</p>
<p>And when it arrives,</p>
<p>all that radiation gets dumped on its destination,</p>
<p>would basically completely exterminate</p>
<p>the planet it arrives at.</p>
<p>That radiation is also incident within the shell itself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Hawking radiation occurring within the shell,</p>
<p>which is pretty dangerous.</p>
<p>And then it also has,</p>
<p>it raises all sorts of exacerbations</p>
<p>of the Fermi paradox, of course, as well.</p>
<p>So you might be able to explain</p>
<p>why we don&rsquo;t see a galactic empire.</p>
<p>I mean, even here it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>You might be able to explain</p>
<p>why we don&rsquo;t see a galactic empire</p>
<p>if everybody&rsquo;s limited to Voyager 2 rocket speeds</p>
<p>of like 20 kilometers per second or something.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a lot harder to explain</p>
<p>why we don&rsquo;t see the stars populated by galactic empires</p>
<p>when warp drive is eminently possible</p>
<p>because it makes expansion so much more trivial</p>
<p>that it makes our life harder.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some wonderful simulation work</p>
<p>being done out of Rochester</p>
<p>where they actually simulate all the stars in the galaxy</p>
<p>or a fraction of them.</p>
<p>And they spawn a civilization in one of them</p>
<p>and they let it spread out at sub-light speeds.</p>
<p>And actually the very mixing of the stars themselves,</p>
<p>because the stars are not static,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in orbit of the galactic center</p>
<p>and they have crossing paths with each other.</p>
<p>If you just have a range of even like five light years</p>
<p>and your speed is of order of a few percent,</p>
<p>the speed of light is the maximum you can muster,</p>
<p>you can populate the entire galaxy</p>
<p>within something like 100,000,</p>
<p>about a million years or so.</p>
<p>So a fraction of the lifetime of the galaxy itself.</p>
<p>And so this raises some fairly serious problems</p>
<p>because if any civilization in the entire history</p>
<p>of the galaxy decided to do that,</p>
<p>then either we shouldn&rsquo;t be here</p>
<p>or we happen to live in this kind of rare pocket</p>
<p>where they chose not to populate to.</p>
<p>And so this is sometimes called fact A, Hart&rsquo;s fact A.</p>
<p>As the fact A is that a civilization is not here now,</p>
<p>an alien civilization is not in present occupation</p>
<p>of the Earth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s difficult to resolve with the apparent ease</p>
<p>at which even a small extrapolation of our own technology</p>
<p>could potentially populate a galaxy</p>
<p>in far faster than galactic history.</p>
<p>So to me, by the way,</p>
<p>the Fermi paradox is truly a paradox for me.</p>
<p>But I suspect that if aliens visit Earth,</p>
<p>I suspect if they are everywhere,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re already here and we&rsquo;re too dumb to see it.</p>
<p>But leaving that aside,</p>
<p>I think we should be able to, in that case,</p>
<p>have very strong, obvious signals</p>
<p>when we look up at the stars,</p>
<p>at the emanation of energy required.</p>
<p>We would see some weirdness</p>
<p>that like where these are these kinds of stars</p>
<p>and these are these kinds of stars</p>
<p>that are being messed with,</p>
<p>like leveraging the nuclear fusion of stars</p>
<p>to do something useful.</p>
<p>The fact that we don&rsquo;t really see that,</p>
<p>like maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t we be able to,</p>
<p>if there is like alien civilizations running galaxies,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t we see weirdnesses from an astronomy perspective</p>
<p>with the way the stars are behaving?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it depends exactly what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But I mean, the Dyson Sphere example is one</p>
<p>that we already discussed</p>
<p>where a survey of 100,000 nearby galaxies</p>
<p>find that they have all been transformed</p>
<p>into Dyson Sphere collectors.</p>
<p>You could also imagine them doing things like,</p>
<p>we wrote a paper about this recently, of star lifting,</p>
<p>where you can extend the life of your star</p>
<p>by scooping mass off the star.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d be doing stellar engineering, essentially.</p>
<p>Space, if you&rsquo;re doing a huge amount of asteroid mining,</p>
<p>you would have a spectral signature</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re basically filling the solar system with dust</p>
<p>by doing that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be debris from that activity.</p>
<p>And so there are some limits on this.</p>
<p>Certainly we don&rsquo;t see bright flashes,</p>
<p>which would be,</p>
<p>one of these consequences of warp drives, as I said,</p>
<p>is as they decelerate,</p>
<p>they produce these bright flashes of light.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t seem to see evidence of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see anything obvious around the nearby stars</p>
<p>or the stars that we&rsquo;ve surveyed in detail beyond that</p>
<p>that indicate any kind of artificial civilization.</p>
<p>The closest maybe we had was Boyajian star</p>
<p>that there was a lot of interest in.</p>
<p>There was a star that was just very peculiarly</p>
<p>dipping in and out its brightness.</p>
<p>And it was hypothesized for a time</p>
<p>that that may indeed be some kind of Dyson-like structure.</p>
<p>So maybe a Dyson sphere that&rsquo;s half built.</p>
<p>And so as it comes in and out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s blocking out huge swaths of the star.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to explain it</p>
<p>really with any kind of planet model at the time.</p>
<p>But an easier hypothesis that was proposed</p>
<p>was it could just be a large number of comets</p>
<p>or dust or something,</p>
<p>or maybe a planet that had broken apart.</p>
<p>And as its fragments orbit around,</p>
<p>it blocks out starlight.</p>
<p>And it turned out with subsequent observations of that star,</p>
<p>which especially the amateur astronomy community</p>
<p>made a big contribution to as well,</p>
<p>that the dips were chromatic,</p>
<p>which was a real important clue</p>
<p>that that probably wasn&rsquo;t a solid structure then</p>
<p>that was going around it.</p>
<p>It was more likely to be dust.</p>
<p>Dust is chromatic.</p>
<p>By chromatic, I mean it looks different in different colors.</p>
<p>So it blocks out more red light than blue light.</p>
<p>If it was a solid structure, it shouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It should be opaque, right?</p>
<p>A solid metal structure or something.</p>
<p>So that was one of the clear indications.</p>
<p>And the behavior of, and the way the light changed</p>
<p>or the dips changed across wavelength</p>
<p>was fully consistent with the expectations</p>
<p>of what small particulates would do.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>I mean, the real problem with alien hunting,</p>
<p>the real problem-</p>
<p>The technical term.</p>
<p>This is the real-</p>
<p>The one problem.</p>
<p>The one problem with the warp drive</p>
<p>and the one problem with the alien hunting, yes.</p>
<p>But well, actually I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s three big problems for me</p>
<p>with any search for life,</p>
<p>which includes UFOs or the way to fossils on Mars,</p>
<p>is that aliens have three unique properties as a hypothesis.</p>
<p>One is they have essentially</p>
<p>unbounded explanatory capability.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s almost no phenomena I can show you</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t explain with aliens to some degree.</p>
<p>You could say, well, the aliens just have</p>
<p>some super high-tech way of creating that illusion.</p>
<p>The second one would be unbounded avoidance capacity.</p>
<p>So I might see a UFO tomorrow,</p>
<p>and then the next day, and then the next day,</p>
<p>and then predict I should see it on Thursday</p>
<p>at the end of the week, but then I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>But I could always get out of that and say,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s just because they chose not to come here.</p>
<p>You know, they have this-</p>
<p>They can always avoid future observations fairly easily.</p>
<p>If you survey an exoplanet for biosignatures</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t see oxygen, you don&rsquo;t see methane,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no one living there.</p>
<p>They could always be either tricking their atmosphere,</p>
<p>engineering it, we actually wrote a paper about that,</p>
<p>how you can use lasers to hide your biosignatures</p>
<p>as advanced civilization.</p>
<p>Or you could just be living underground</p>
<p>or underwater or something where there&rsquo;s no biosignatures.</p>
<p>So you can never really disprove there&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>on another planet or on another star.</p>
<p>It has infinite avoidance.</p>
<p>And then finally, the third one is that we have</p>
<p>incomplete physical understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>So if I see a new phenomena,</p>
<p>which Boyajian&rsquo;s star was a good example of that,</p>
<p>we saw this new phenomena of these strange dips</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d never seen before.</p>
<p>It was hypothesized immediately this could be aliens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a god of the gaps,</p>
<p>but it turned out to be incomplete physical understanding.</p>
<p>And so that happens all the time.</p>
<p>In the first pulsar that was discovered, same story.</p>
<p>Jocelyn Bell kind of somewhat tongue-in-cheek</p>
<p>called it Little Green Man 1</p>
<p>because it looked a lot like the radio signature</p>
<p>that was expected from an alien civilization.</p>
<p>But of course, it turned out to be</p>
<p>a completely new type of star that we had never seen before,</p>
<p>which was a neutron star with these two jets</p>
<p>coming out the top of it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>
<p>Those three things are really, really difficult</p>
<p>in terms of experimental design</p>
<p>for a scientist to work around.</p>
<p>Something that can explain anything, can avoid anything,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s almost unfalsifiable,</p>
<p>and could always just be, to some degree, as you said,</p>
<p>we have this very limited knowledge</p>
<p>of the infinite possibilities of physical law,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re probably only scratching the surface.</p>
<p>Each time, and we&rsquo;ve seen it so often in history,</p>
<p>we may just be detecting some new phenomena.</p>
<p>Well, that last one, I think I&rsquo;m a little more okay</p>
<p>with making mistakes on.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s exciting still.</p>
<p>Because no matter, so you might exaggerate</p>
<p>the importance of the discovery,</p>
<p>but the whole point is to try to find stuff</p>
<p>in this world that&rsquo;s weird,</p>
<p>and try to characterize that weirdness.</p>
<p>Sure, you can throw a little green man as a label on it,</p>
<p>but eventually, it&rsquo;s as mysterious and as beautiful,</p>
<p>as interesting as a little green man.</p>
<p>Like, we tend to think that there&rsquo;s some kind of threshold,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s all kinds of weird organisms on this Earth</p>
<p>that operate very differently than humans</p>
<p>that are super interesting.</p>
<p>The human mind is super interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, weirdness and complexity is as interesting</p>
<p>in any of its forms as what we might think from Hollywood</p>
<p>what aliens are.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Looking for weirdnesses on Mars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the best sales pitches</p>
<p>to do technosignature work,</p>
<p>is that we always have that as our fallback,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna look for alien signatures.</p>
<p>If we fail, we&rsquo;re gonna discover</p>
<p>some awesome new physics along the way.</p>
<p>And so, any kind of signature that we detect</p>
<p>is always going to be interesting.</p>
<p>And so, that compels us to have not only the question</p>
<p>of looking for life in the universe,</p>
<p>but it gives us a strong scientific grounding</p>
<p>as to why this sort of research should be funded</p>
<p>and should be executed,</p>
<p>because it always pushes the frontiers of knowledge.</p>
<p>I wonder if we&rsquo;ll be able to discover</p>
<p>and be open enough to a broad definition of aliens,</p>
<p>where we see some kind of technosignature,</p>
<p>basically like a Turing test,</p>
<p>like this thing is intelligent.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s processing information in a very interesting way.</p>
<p>But you could say that about chemistry.</p>
<p>You could say that about physics.</p>
<p>Maybe not physics, chemistry.</p>
<p>Like interesting, complex chemistry,</p>
<p>you could say that this is processing.</p>
<p>This is storing information.</p>
<p>This is propagating information over time.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it&rsquo;s a gray area</p>
<p>between a living organism that we would call an alien,</p>
<p>and a thing that&rsquo;s super interesting</p>
<p>and is able to carry some kind of intelligence.</p>
<p>Yeah, information is a really useful way</p>
<p>to frame what we&rsquo;re looking for, though,</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re divorced from making assumptions</p>
<p>about even a civilization, necessarily,</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>So, any kind of information-rich signature,</p>
<p>indeed, you can take things like the light curve</p>
<p>from Boyajian&rsquo;s star and ask,</p>
<p>what is the minimum number of free parameters</p>
<p>the minimum information content</p>
<p>that must be encoded within this light curve?</p>
<p>And the hope is that maybe from,</p>
<p>a good example would be from a radio signature.</p>
<p>You detect something that has 1,000 megabytes</p>
<p>of parameters, essentially, contained within it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty clearly, at that point,</p>
<p>not the product of a natural process,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s any natural process that we could possibly imagine</p>
<p>with our current understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>And so, thinking that even if we can&rsquo;t decode,</p>
<p>which, actually, I&rsquo;m skeptical we&rsquo;d be able</p>
<p>to ever decode it in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>It would probably take decades to fully ever figure out</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re trying to tell us.</p>
<p>But if there was a message there,</p>
<p>we could at least know</p>
<p>that there is high information content,</p>
<p>and there is complexity,</p>
<p>and that this is a attempt at communication</p>
<p>and information transfer,</p>
<p>and leave it to our subsequent generations</p>
<p>to figure out what exactly it is they&rsquo;re trying to say.</p>
<p>What, again, a wild question,</p>
<p>and thank you for&hellip;</p>
<p>Entertaining them.</p>
<p>Entertaining them.</p>
<p>I really, really appreciate that.</p>
<p>But what kind of signal in our lifetime,</p>
<p>what kind of thing do you think might happen,</p>
<p>could possibly happen,</p>
<p>where the scientific community would be convinced</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s alien civilizations out there?</p>
<p>Like what, so you already said,</p>
<p>maybe a strong infrared signature</p>
<p>for something like a Dyson sphere.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s also to some degree a little bit ambiguous,</p>
<p>because-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the challenge, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>is where your brain would be,</p>
<p>like you as a scientist,</p>
<p>would be like, I know it&rsquo;s ambiguous,</p>
<p>but this is really weird.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think if you had some,</p>
<p>I can imagine something like a prime number sequence,</p>
<p>or a mathematical sequence,</p>
<p>like the Fibonacci series,</p>
<p>something being broadcasted.</p>
<p>Mathematically provable that this is not</p>
<p>a physical phenomenon.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, yeah,</p>
<p>prime numbers is a pretty good case,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no natural phenomena</p>
<p>that produces prime number sequences.</p>
<p>It seems to be a purely an abstract mathematical concept,</p>
<p>as far as I&rsquo;m aware.</p>
<p>And so if we detected a series of radio blips</p>
<p>that were following that sequence,</p>
<p>it would be pretty clear to me,</p>
<p>or it could even be Carl Sagan suggested</p>
<p>that pi could be encoded in that,</p>
<p>or you might use the hydrogen line,</p>
<p>but multiply it by pi,</p>
<p>like some very specific frequency of the universe,</p>
<p>like a hydrogen line,</p>
<p>but multiply it by a abstract mathematical constant</p>
<p>that would imply strongly</p>
<p>that there was someone behind the scenes operating that.</p>
<p>Sorry, stored in which phenomena, though?</p>
<p>In that case, I think of a radio wave.</p>
<p>But the information, I mean,</p>
<p>we kind of toyed with this idea</p>
<p>in a video I did about hypothetical civilization</p>
<p>on my channel.</p>
<p>But one kind of fun way,</p>
<p>I do want to bring this conversation</p>
<p>towards time a little bit,</p>
<p>and thinking about not just looking</p>
<p>for life and intelligence around us right now,</p>
<p>but looking into the past and even into the future</p>
<p>to some degree, or communicating with the future.</p>
<p>And so we had this fun experiment</p>
<p>of imagining a civilization that was born</p>
<p>at the beginning of the history of the galaxy</p>
<p>and being the first and what it would be like for them.</p>
<p>And they were desperately searching for evidence of life,</p>
<p>but couldn&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<p>And so they decided to try and leave something behind</p>
<p>for future civilizations to discover,</p>
<p>to tell them about themselves.</p>
<p>But of course, a radio scene&rsquo;s just not gonna work there</p>
<p>because it has to have a power source,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a piece of machinery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna eventually break down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be hard to maintain that</p>
<p>for billions of years timescale.</p>
<p>And so you wanted something that was kind of passive,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require an energy source,</p>
<p>but can somehow transmit information,</p>
<p>which is hard to think about something</p>
<p>that satisfies those criteria.</p>
<p>But there was a proposal</p>
<p>by one of my colleagues, Luke Arnold,</p>
<p>which inspired a lot of us in Technosignatures.</p>
<p>And he suggested that you could build artificial transitors.</p>
<p>So you could build sheets of material</p>
<p>that transit in front of the star.</p>
<p>Maybe one thin sheet passes across first,</p>
<p>then two, then three, then five, then seven,</p>
<p>so you could follow the prime number sequence of these.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;d be a clear indication</p>
<p>that someone had manufactured those,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t require any energy source</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re just sheets of material in orbit of the star.</p>
<p>They would eventually degrade from micrometeorites,</p>
<p>and maybe they always would become destabilized,</p>
<p>but they should have lifetimes far exceeding</p>
<p>the lifetime of any battery or mechanical electronic system</p>
<p>that we could, at least with our technology,</p>
<p>conceive of building.</p>
<p>And so you could imagine then extending that,</p>
<p>and how could you encode not just a prime number sequence,</p>
<p>but maybe in the spatial pattern</p>
<p>of this very complex light curve we see,</p>
<p>you could encode more and more information</p>
<p>through 2D shapes and the way those occultations happen.</p>
<p>And maybe you could even encode messages</p>
<p>and in-depth information from that.</p>
<p>You could even imagine it being</p>
<p>like a lower layer of information,</p>
<p>which is just the prime number sequence,</p>
<p>but then you look closely and you see</p>
<p>the smaller divots embedded within those</p>
<p>that have a deeper layer of information to extract.</p>
<p>And so to me, something like that</p>
<p>would be pretty compelling,</p>
<p>that there was somebody who had,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s just a very impressive hoax,</p>
<p>that would be a pretty compelling evidence</p>
<p>for this civilization.</p>
<p>And actually, the methods of astronomy right now</p>
<p>are kind of marching towards being able</p>
<p>to better and better detect a signal like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, to some degree,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just building bigger aperture in space.</p>
<p>The bigger the telescope,</p>
<p>the finer ability to detect those minute signals.</p>
<p>Do you think the current sort of the scientific community,</p>
<p>another weird question,</p>
<p>but just the observations that are happening now,</p>
<p>do you think they&rsquo;re ready for a prime number sequence?</p>
<p>In the sort of, if we&rsquo;re using the current method,</p>
<p>the transit timing variation method,</p>
<p>like do you think you&rsquo;re ready?</p>
<p>Do you have the tools to detect the prime number sequence?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s 200,000 stars that Kepler monitored</p>
<p>and it monitored them all the time.</p>
<p>It took a photo of each one of them every 30 minutes,</p>
<p>measured their brightness,</p>
<p>and it did that for four and a half years.</p>
<p>And so you have already,</p>
<p>and Tess is doing it right now, another mission.</p>
<p>And so you have already an existing catalog</p>
<p>and people are genuinely scouring</p>
<p>through each of those light curves</p>
<p>with automated machine learning techniques.</p>
<p>We even developed some in our own team</p>
<p>that can look for weird behavior.</p>
<p>We wrote a code called the weird detector, for instance.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>You know, it was just the most generic thing possible.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t assume anything about the signal shape.</p>
<p>Just look for anything that repeats.</p>
<p>The signal shape can be anything</p>
<p>and we kind of learn the template of the signal</p>
<p>from the data itself.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like a template matching filter</p>
<p>to see if that repeats many, many times in the data.</p>
<p>And so we actually applied that</p>
<p>and found a bunch of interesting stuff,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t see anything</p>
<p>that was the prime number sequence,</p>
<p>at least on the Kepler data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 200,000 stars, which sounds like a lot,</p>
<p>but compared to 200 billion stars in the Milky Way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really just scratching the surface.</p>
<p>So one, because there could be something</p>
<p>much more generalizable than the prime number sequence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ultimately the question of a signal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very difficult to compress</p>
<p>in the general sense of what compress means.</p>
<p>So maybe as we get better and better</p>
<p>in machine learning methods</p>
<p>that automatically figure out, analyze the data</p>
<p>to understand how to compress it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to discover data</p>
<p>that for some reason is not compressible.</p>
<p>But then, you know, compression really is a bottomless pit</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really what intelligence is,</p>
<p>is being able to compress information.</p>
<p>Yeah, and to some degree, the more you,</p>
<p>I would imagine, I don&rsquo;t work in compression algorithms,</p>
<p>but I would imagine the more you compress your signal,</p>
<p>the more assumptions that kind of go</p>
<p>on behalf of the decoder,</p>
<p>the more skilled they really have to be.</p>
<p>You know, a prime number sequence</p>
<p>is completely unencoded information, essentially.</p>
<p>But if you look at the Arecibo message,</p>
<p>they were fairly careful with their pixelation</p>
<p>of this simple image they sent</p>
<p>to try and make it as interpretable as possible</p>
<p>to be that even a dumb alien would be able to figure out</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re trying to show them here</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s all sorts of conventions</p>
<p>and rules that are built in</p>
<p>that we tend to presume when we design our messages.</p>
<p>And so if your message is assuming</p>
<p>they know how to do an MP3 decoder,</p>
<p>a particular compression algorithm,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they could eventually reverse engineer it</p>
<p>and figure it out,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re making it harder for them to get to that point.</p>
<p>So maybe, I always think, you know,</p>
<p>you probably would have a two-tier system, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably have some lower-tier key system,</p>
<p>and then maybe beneath that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have a deeper compressed layer</p>
<p>of more in-depth information.</p>
<p>What about maybe observing actual physical objects?</p>
<p>So first, let me go to your tweet</p>
<p>as a source of inspiration.</p>
<p>You tweeted that it&rsquo;s interesting to ponder</p>
<p>that if Oort clouds are ever mined</p>
<p>by the systems of alien civilizations,</p>
<p>mining equipment from billions of years ago</p>
<p>could be in our Oort cloud</p>
<p>since the Oort clouds extend really, really, really,</p>
<p>really far outside the actual star.</p>
<p>So, you know, mining equipment,</p>
<p>just basic, boring mining equipment out there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s something interesting to say</p>
<p>about Oort clouds themselves that are interesting to you</p>
<p>and about possible non-shiny light-emitting mining equipment</p>
<p>from alien civilizations.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of the beauty</p>
<p>of the field of technosignatures and looking for life</p>
<p>is you can find inspiration and intellectual joy</p>
<p>in just the smallest little thing</p>
<p>that starts a whole thread of building upon it</p>
<p>and wondering about the implications.</p>
<p>And so in this case, I was just really struck by,</p>
<p>we kind of mentioned this a little bit earlier,</p>
<p>the idea that stars are not static.</p>
<p>We tend to think of the galaxy as having stars</p>
<p>in a certain location from the center of the galaxy</p>
<p>and they kind of live there.</p>
<p>But in truth, the stars are not only orbiting</p>
<p>around the center of the galaxy,</p>
<p>but those orbits are themselves changing</p>
<p>over time, they&rsquo;re processing.</p>
<p>And so in fact, the orbits look more like a spirograph</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever done those as a kid,</p>
<p>they kind of whirl around and trace out</p>
<p>all sorts of strange patterns.</p>
<p>And so the stars intersect with one another.</p>
<p>And so the current closest star to us is Proxima Centauri,</p>
<p>which is about 4.2 light years away.</p>
<p>But it will not always be the closest star</p>
<p>and over millions of years,</p>
<p>it will be supplanted by other stars.</p>
<p>In fact, stars that will come even closer than Proxima</p>
<p>within just a couple of light years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been happening, not just we can project</p>
<p>that will happen over the next few million years,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s been happening presumably</p>
<p>throughout the entire history of the galaxy</p>
<p>for billions of years.</p>
<p>And so if you went back in time,</p>
<p>there would have been all sorts of different nearest stars</p>
<p>at different stages of the Earth&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>And those stars are so close that their Oort clouds</p>
<p>do intermix with one another.</p>
<p>So the Oort cloud can extend out to even a light year</p>
<p>or two around the Earth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some debate about exactly where it ends.</p>
<p>It probably doesn&rsquo;t really have a definitive end,</p>
<p>but kind of more just kind of peters out</p>
<p>more and more and more as you go further away.</p>
<p>By the way, for people who don&rsquo;t know an Oort cloud,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the technical definition is,</p>
<p>but a bunch of rocks that kind of, no,</p>
<p>objects that orbit the star.</p>
<p>And they can extend really, really, really far</p>
<p>because of gravity.</p>
<p>These are objects that probably are mostly icy rich.</p>
<p>They were probably formed fairly similar distances</p>
<p>to Jupiter and Saturn, but were scattered out</p>
<p>through the interactions of those giant planets.</p>
<p>We see a circular disk of objects around us,</p>
<p>which kind of looks like the asteroid belt,</p>
<p>but just further away called the Kuiper belt.</p>
<p>And then further beyond that,</p>
<p>you get the Oort cloud.</p>
<p>And the Oort cloud is not on a disk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a sphere.</p>
<p>It kind of surrounds us in all directions.</p>
<p>So these are objects that were scattered out</p>
<p>through three-dimensionally in all different directions.</p>
<p>And so those objects are potentially resources for us,</p>
<p>especially if you were planning</p>
<p>to do an interstellar mission one day,</p>
<p>you might want to mine the water</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s embedded within those and use that</p>
<p>as either oxygen or fuel for your rocket.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s quite possible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also some rare earth metals</p>
<p>and things like that as well,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s quite possible that a civilization</p>
<p>might use Oort cloud objects as a jumping off point.</p>
<p>Or in the Kuiper belt,</p>
<p>you have things like planet nine even.</p>
<p>There might even be objects beyond in the Oort cloud,</p>
<p>which are actually planet-like that we just cannot detect.</p>
<p>These objects are very, very faint.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so hard to see.</p>
<p>I mean, even planet nine, it&rsquo;s hypothesized to exist,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve not been able to confirm its existence</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s at something like a thousand AU away from us,</p>
<p>a thousand times the distance of the earth from the sun.</p>
<p>And so even though it&rsquo;s probably larger than the earth,</p>
<p>the amount of light it reflects from the sun,</p>
<p>the sun just looks like a star at that point,</p>
<p>so far away from it that it barely reflects anything back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely difficult to detect.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all sorts of wonders</p>
<p>that may be lurking out in the outer solar system.</p>
<p>And so this leads you to wonder,</p>
<p>you know, in the Oort cloud,</p>
<p>that Oort cloud must have intermixed</p>
<p>with other Oort clouds in the past.</p>
<p>And so what fraction of the Oort cloud truly belongs to us,</p>
<p>belongs to what was scattered from Jupiter and Saturn,</p>
<p>what fraction of it could in fact be interstellar visitors?</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;ve got excited about this recently</p>
<p>because of Oumuamua, this interstellar asteroid,</p>
<p>which seemed to be at the time</p>
<p>the first evidence of an interstellar object.</p>
<p>But when you think about the Oort cloud intermixing,</p>
<p>it may be that a large fraction of comets,</p>
<p>comets are seeded from the Oort cloud</p>
<p>that eventually come in.</p>
<p>Some of those comets may indeed</p>
<p>have been interstellar in the first place</p>
<p>that we just didn&rsquo;t know about through this process.</p>
<p>There even is an example, I can&rsquo;t remember the name,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an example of a comet</p>
<p>that has a very peculiar spectral signature</p>
<p>that has been hypothesized</p>
<p>to have actually been an interstellar visitor,</p>
<p>but one that was essentially sourced</p>
<p>through this Oort cloud mixing.</p>
<p>And so this is kind of intriguing.</p>
<p>And also, the outer solar system is just such a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>We know so little about what&rsquo;s on the bottom</p>
<p>of our own planet&rsquo;s ocean,</p>
<p>and we know next to nothing</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s on the outskirts of our own solar system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all darkness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like, that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>is to understand the phenomenon, we need light.</p>
<p>And we need to see how light interacts with it</p>
<p>or what light emanates from it.</p>
<p>But most of our universe is darkness.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, there could be a lot of interesting stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, this is where your interest is</p>
<p>with the cool worlds and the interesting stuff</p>
<p>lurks in the darkness, right?</p>
<p>Basically all of us, you know, 400 years of astronomy,</p>
<p>our only window into the universe has been light.</p>
<p>And that has only changed quite recently</p>
<p>with the discovery of gravitational waves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s now a new window.</p>
<p>And hopefully, well, to some degree, I guess,</p>
<p>solar neutrinos we&rsquo;ve been detecting for a while,</p>
<p>but they come from the sun, not interstellar space.</p>
<p>But we may be able to soon detect neutrino messages</p>
<p>has even been hypothesized as a way of communicating</p>
<p>between civilizations as well,</p>
<p>or just do neutrino telescopes to study the universe.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a growing interest</p>
<p>in what we&rsquo;d call multi-messenger astronomy now.</p>
<p>So not just messages from light,</p>
<p>but messages from these other physical packets</p>
<p>of information that are coming our way.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the outer solar system,</p>
<p>light really is our only window.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two ways of doing that.</p>
<p>One is you detect the light from the Oort cloud object</p>
<p>itself, which as I just said, is very, very difficult.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another trick,</p>
<p>which we do in the Kuiper belt especially,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called an occultation.</p>
<p>And so sometimes those objects will just pass in front</p>
<p>of a distant star, just coincidentally.</p>
<p>These are very, very brief moments.</p>
<p>They last for less than a second.</p>
<p>And so you have to have a very fast camera to detect them,</p>
<p>which conventionally astronomers</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t usually build fast cameras.</p>
<p>Most of the phenomena we observe occurs on hours,</p>
<p>minutes, days even.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;re developing cameras which can take,</p>
<p>you know, thousands of images per second,</p>
<p>and yet do it at the kind of astronomical fidelity</p>
<p>that we need for this kind of precise measurement.</p>
<p>And so you can see these very fast dips.</p>
<p>You even get these kind of diffraction patterns</p>
<p>that come around, which are really cool to look at.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I kind of love it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s almost like passive radar.</p>
<p>You have these pinpricks of light.</p>
<p>Imagine that you live in a giant black sphere,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s these little pinholes that have been poked.</p>
<p>And through those pinholes,</p>
<p>almost laser light is shining through.</p>
<p>And inside this black sphere,</p>
<p>there are unknown things wandering around,</p>
<p>drifting around that we are trying to discover.</p>
<p>And sometimes they will pass in front of those</p>
<p>little pencil-thin laser beams, block something out.</p>
<p>And so we can tell that it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not an active radar</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t actually beam anything out</p>
<p>and get a reflection off,</p>
<p>which is what the sun does.</p>
<p>The sun&rsquo;s light comes off and it comes back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more like an active radar system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more like a passive radar system</p>
<p>where we are just listening very intently.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m kind of so fascinated by that,</p>
<p>the idea that we could map out the rich architecture</p>
<p>of the outer solar system just by doing something</p>
<p>that we could have done potentially for a long time ago,</p>
<p>which is just listening in the right way,</p>
<p>just tuning our instrumentation</p>
<p>to the correct way of not listening,</p>
<p>but viewing the universe to catch those objects.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>It seems almost obvious that your efforts,</p>
<p>when projected out in over like 100, 200 years,</p>
<p>will have a really good map,</p>
<p>through even methods like basically transit timing,</p>
<p>high-resolution transit timing,</p>
<p>but basically the planetary</p>
<p>and the planet satellite movements</p>
<p>of all the different star systems out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it could revolutionize</p>
<p>the way we think about the solar system.</p>
<p>I mean, that revolution has happened several times</p>
<p>in the past when we discovered Vesta in the 19th century.</p>
<p>That was, I think, the seventh planet for a while</p>
<p>or the eighth planet when it was first discovered.</p>
<p>And then we discovered Ceres</p>
<p>and there was a bunch of asteroid objects, Janus.</p>
<p>And so for a while, the textbooks had,</p>
<p>there was something like 13 planets in the solar system.</p>
<p>And then that was just a new capability</p>
<p>that was emerging to detect those small objects.</p>
<p>And then we ripped that up and said,</p>
<p>no, no, we&rsquo;re gonna change the definition of a planet.</p>
<p>And then the same thing happened</p>
<p>when we started looking at the outer skirts</p>
<p>of the solar system.</p>
<p>Again, we found Eris, we found Sedna,</p>
<p>these objects which resembled Pluto.</p>
<p>And the more and more of them we found, make, make.</p>
<p>And eventually we, again, had to rethink</p>
<p>the way we even contextualize what a planet is</p>
<p>and what the nature of the outer solar system is.</p>
<p>So regardless as to what you think about the debate</p>
<p>about whether Pluto should be devoted or not,</p>
<p>which I know often evokes a lot of strong feelings,</p>
<p>it is an incredible achievement</p>
<p>that we were able to transform our view</p>
<p>of the solar system in a matter of years</p>
<p>just by basically charge-coupled devices,</p>
<p>the things that&rsquo;s in cameras.</p>
<p>Though the invention of that device</p>
<p>allowed us to detect objects</p>
<p>which were much further away, much fainter,</p>
<p>and revealed all of this stuff that was there all along.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the beauty of astronomy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so much to discover,</p>
<p>and even in our own backyard.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about this?</p>
<p>Do you imagine what are the things</p>
<p>that will completely change astronomy</p>
<p>over the next 100 years?</p>
<p>Like if you transport yourself forward 100 years,</p>
<p>what are the things that will blow your mind</p>
<p>when you look at, wait, what?</p>
<p>Would it be just a very high-resolution mapping of things?</p>
<p>Like, holy crap.</p>
<p>Like one surprising thing might be,</p>
<p>holy crap, there&rsquo;s like Earth-like moons everywhere.</p>
<p>And another one could be</p>
<p>just totally different devices for sensing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think usually astronomy moves forward dramatically,</p>
<p>and science in general,</p>
<p>when you have a new technological capability</p>
<p>come online for the first time.</p>
<p>And we kind of just gave examples of that there</p>
<p>with the solar system.</p>
<p>So what kind of new capabilities</p>
<p>might emerge in the next 100 years?</p>
<p>The capability I would love to see is not just,</p>
<p>I mean, in the next 10, 20 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re hoping to take these pale blue dot images</p>
<p>we spoke about.</p>
<p>So that requires building something like JWST,</p>
<p>but on an even larger scale,</p>
<p>and optimize for direct imaging.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to have either coronagraph</p>
<p>or a starshade or something to block out the starlight</p>
<p>and reveal those pale blue dots.</p>
<p>So in the next sort of decades,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the achievement</p>
<p>that we can look forward to in our lifetimes</p>
<p>is to see photos of other Earths</p>
<p>going beyond that, maybe in our lifetimes,</p>
<p>towards the end of our lifetimes, perhaps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love it if we,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s technically possible</p>
<p>as Breakthrough Starshot</p>
<p>are giving us a lot of encouragement with,</p>
<p>to maybe send a small probe to the nearest stars</p>
<p>and start actually taking high resolution images</p>
<p>of these objects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only so much you can do from far away</p>
<p>if you want to have,</p>
<p>and we can see it in the solar system.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s only so much you can learn about Europa</p>
<p>by pointing Hubble Space Telescope at it.</p>
<p>But if you really want to understand that moon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to send something to orbit it</p>
<p>to hopefully land on it and drill down to the surface.</p>
<p>And so the idea of even taking a flyby</p>
<p>and doing a snapshot photo that gets beamed back</p>
<p>that could be,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even have to be more than 100 pixels by 100 pixels.</p>
<p>Even that would be a completely game-changing capability</p>
<p>to be able to truly image these objects.</p>
<p>And maybe at home in our own solar system,</p>
<p>we can certainly get to a point</p>
<p>where we produce crude maps of exoplanets.</p>
<p>One of the, kind of the ultimate limit</p>
<p>of what a telescope could do is governed by its size.</p>
<p>And so the largest telescope you could probably ever build</p>
<p>would be one that was the size of the sun.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a clever trick for doing this</p>
<p>without physically building a telescope</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the size of the sun,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s to use the sun as a gravitational lens.</p>
<p>This was proposed, I think, by Von Eschlemann in like 1979,</p>
<p>but it builds upon Einstein&rsquo;s theory of general relativity,</p>
<p>of course, that there is a warping of light,</p>
<p>a bending of light from the sun&rsquo;s gravitational field.</p>
<p>And so a distant starlight, it&rsquo;s like a magnifying glass.</p>
<p>Anything that bends light is basically,</p>
<p>can be used as a telescope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna bend light to a point.</p>
<p>Now it turns out the sun&rsquo;s gravity is not strong enough</p>
<p>to create a particularly great telescope here</p>
<p>because the focus point is really out in the Kuiper belt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at 550 astronomical units away from the earth.</p>
<p>So 550 times further away from the sun than we are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s beyond any of our spacecraft have ever gone.</p>
<p>So you have to send a spacecraft to that distance,</p>
<p>which would take 30, 40 years,</p>
<p>even optimistically improving</p>
<p>our chemical propulsion system significantly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to bound it into that orbit,</p>
<p>but then you could use the entire sun as your telescope.</p>
<p>And with that kind of capability,</p>
<p>you could image planets to kilometer scale</p>
<p>or resolution from afar.</p>
<p>And that really makes you wonder.</p>
<p>I mean, if we can conceive, maybe we can&rsquo;t engineer it,</p>
<p>but if we can conceive of such a device,</p>
<p>what might other civilizations be currently observing</p>
<p>about our own planet?</p>
<p>And perhaps that is why nobody is visiting us,</p>
<p>because there is so much you can do from afar</p>
<p>that to them, that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>Maybe they can get to the point</p>
<p>where they can detect our radio leakage,</p>
<p>they can direct our terrestrial television signals,</p>
<p>they can map out our surfaces,</p>
<p>they can tell we have cities,</p>
<p>they can even do infrared mapping of the heat island effects</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>They can tell the chemical composition of our planet.</p>
<p>And so that might be enough.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t need to come down to the surface</p>
<p>and study, do anthropology</p>
<p>and see what our civilization is like.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s certainly a huge amount you can do,</p>
<p>which is significantly cheaper to some degree</p>
<p>than flying there,</p>
<p>just by exploiting cleverly</p>
<p>the physics of the universe itself.</p>
<p>So your intuition is, and this very well might be true,</p>
<p>that observation might be way easier than travel.</p>
<p>From our perspective, from an alien perspective,</p>
<p>like we could get very high resolution imaging</p>
<p>before we could ever get there.</p>
<p>It depends on what information you want.</p>
<p>If you want to know the chemical composition</p>
<p>and you want to know kilometer scale maps of the planet,</p>
<p>then you could do that from afar</p>
<p>with some version of these kind of gravitational lenses.</p>
<p>If you want to do better than that,</p>
<p>if you want to image a newspaper</p>
<p>sat on the porch of somebody&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to fly there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way, unless you had a telescope</p>
<p>the size of such a star or something,</p>
<p>you just simply cannot collect enough light</p>
<p>to do that from many light years away.</p>
<p>So there is certainly reasons</p>
<p>why visiting will always have its place,</p>
<p>depending on what kind of information you want.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve proposed in my team, actually,</p>
<p>that the sun is the ultimate pinnacle of telescope design,</p>
<p>but flying to 1,000 AU is a real pain in the butt</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just going to take so long.</p>
<p>And so a more practical way of achieving this</p>
<p>might be to use the Earth.</p>
<p>Now, the Earth doesn&rsquo;t have anywhere near enough gravity</p>
<p>to create a substantial gravitational lens,</p>
<p>but it has an atmosphere,</p>
<p>and that atmosphere refracts light, it bends light.</p>
<p>So whenever you see a sunset,</p>
<p>just as the sun&rsquo;s setting below the horizon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually already beneath the horizon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the light is bending through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually already about half a degree down beneath,</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re seeing is that curvature of the light path.</p>
<p>And your brain interprets it, of course,</p>
<p>to be following a straight line</p>
<p>because your brain always thinks that.</p>
<p>And so you can use that bending.</p>
<p>Whenever you have bending, you have a telescope.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve proposed to my team</p>
<p>that you could use this refraction</p>
<p>to similarly create an Earth-sized telescope.</p>
<p>Called the Terrascope.</p>
<p>The Terrascope, yeah.</p>
<p>We have a great video on this.</p>
<p>And this-</p>
<p>Do you have a paper on the Terrascope?</p>
<p>I do, yeah.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get confused with this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve heard of an Earth-sized telescope</p>
<p>because of the,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ve heard of the Event Horizon Telescope,</p>
<p>which took an image of,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s taking an image right now</p>
<p>of the center of our black hole.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very impressive,</p>
<p>and it previously did Messier 87,</p>
<p>a nearby supermassive black hole.</p>
<p>And so those images were interferometric.</p>
<p>So they were small telescopes scattered across the Earth,</p>
<p>and they combined the light paths together,</p>
<p>interferometrically,</p>
<p>to create effectively an Earth-sized angular resolution.</p>
<p>Telescopes always have two properties.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the angular resolution,</p>
<p>which is how small of a thing you can see on the surface,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the magnification,</p>
<p>how much brighter does that object get</p>
<p>versus just your eye or some small object.</p>
<p>Now, what the Event Horizon Telescope did,</p>
<p>it traded off amplification or magnification</p>
<p>for the angular resolution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it wanted.</p>
<p>It wanted that high angular resolution,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t really have much photon-collecting power</p>
<p>because each telescope individually is very small.</p>
<p>The Telescope is different</p>
<p>because it is literally collecting light</p>
<p>with a light bucket,</p>
<p>which is essentially the size of the Earth.</p>
<p>And so that gives you both benefits, potentially,</p>
<p>not only the high angular resolution</p>
<p>that a large aperture promises you,</p>
<p>but also actually physically collects all those photons.</p>
<p>So you can detect light from very, very far away,</p>
<p>the very outer edges of the universe.</p>
<p>And so we propose this as a possible future</p>
<p>technological way of achieving these extreme goals,</p>
<p>ambitious goals we have in astronomy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very difficult system to test</p>
<p>because you essentially have to fly out</p>
<p>to these focus points,</p>
<p>and these focus points lie beyond the moon.</p>
<p>So you have to have someone who is willing</p>
<p>to fly beyond the moon</p>
<p>and hitchhike an experimental telescope onto it</p>
<p>and do that cheaply.</p>
<p>If it was something doing low Earth orbit, it&rsquo;d be easy.</p>
<p>You could just attach a CubeSat</p>
<p>to the next Falcon 9 rocket or something and test it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d probably only cost you a few tens of thousands of</p>
<p>dollars, maybe a hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s basically no one who flies out that far</p>
<p>except for bespoke missions,</p>
<p>such as like a mission that&rsquo;s going to Mars or something</p>
<p>that would pass through that kind of space.</p>
<p>And they typically don&rsquo;t have a lot of leeway</p>
<p>and excess payload that they&rsquo;re willing to strap on</p>
<p>for radical experiments.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been the problem with it.</p>
<p>In theory, it should work beautifully,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very difficult idea to experimentally test.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate why the focal point is that far away?</p>
<p>So you get about half a degree bend</p>
<p>from the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking at the sun at the horizon</p>
<p>and you get that two times over</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re outside of the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere</p>
<p>because it comes, you know,</p>
<p>the star is half a bend to you still on the horizon</p>
<p>and half a degree back out either way.</p>
<p>So you get about a one degree bend.</p>
<p>You take the radius of the Earth,</p>
<p>which is about 7,000 kilometers</p>
<p>and do your arctan function,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll end up with a distance that&rsquo;s about two,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually the inner focal point is about two thirds</p>
<p>of the distance of the Earth-moon system.</p>
<p>The problem with that inner focal point is not useful</p>
<p>because that light ray path</p>
<p>had to basically scrape the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>So it passes through the clouds,</p>
<p>it passes through all the thick atmosphere,</p>
<p>it gets a lot of extinction along the way.</p>
<p>If you go higher up in altitude, you get less extinction.</p>
<p>In fact, you can even go above the clouds</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s even better</p>
<p>because the clouds obviously are gonna be a pain in the neck</p>
<p>for doing anything optical.</p>
<p>But the problem with that is that the atmosphere,</p>
<p>because it gets thinner at higher altitude,</p>
<p>it bends light less.</p>
<p>And so that pushes the focal point out.</p>
<p>So the most useful focal point</p>
<p>is actually about three or four times the distance</p>
<p>of the Earth-moon separation.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what we call one of the Lagrange points,</p>
<p>essentially, out there.</p>
<p>And so there is a stable orbit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of the outermost stable orbit</p>
<p>you could have around the Earth.</p>
<p>So the atmosphere does bad things to the signal.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s absorbing light.</p>
<p>Is it possible to reconstruct, to remove the noise,</p>
<p>whatever, so it&rsquo;s just strength, it&rsquo;s nothing else?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to reconstruct.</p>
<p>I mean, to some degree we do this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a technology called adaptive optics</p>
<p>that can correct for what&rsquo;s called wavefront errors</p>
<p>that happen through the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere is turbulent,</p>
<p>it is not a single plane of air of the same density,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kind of wiggles and currents in the air.</p>
<p>And so that each little layer is bending light</p>
<p>in slightly different ways.</p>
<p>And so the light actually kind of follows a wiggly path</p>
<p>on its way down.</p>
<p>What that means is that two light rays,</p>
<p>which are traveling at slightly different</p>
<p>spatial separations from each other,</p>
<p>will arrive at the detector at different times,</p>
<p>because one maybe goes on more or less a straight path</p>
<p>and the one wiggles down a bit more before it arrives.</p>
<p>And so you have an incoherent light source.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re trying to do imagery construction,</p>
<p>you always want a coherent light source.</p>
<p>So the way they correct for this is that this,</p>
<p>if this path had to travel a little bit faster,</p>
<p>the straight one goes faster</p>
<p>and the wiggly one takes longer,</p>
<p>the mirror is deformable.</p>
<p>And so you actually bend the mirror on this,</p>
<p>on the straight one down a little bit</p>
<p>to make it an equivalent light path distance.</p>
<p>So the mirror itself has all these little actuators,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually made up of like thousands of little elements,</p>
<p>almost looks like a liquid mirror,</p>
<p>because they can manipulate it in kind of real time.</p>
<p>And so they scan the atmosphere with a laser beam</p>
<p>to tell what the deformations are in the atmosphere</p>
<p>and then make the corrections to the mirror</p>
<p>to account for it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So you could, you could do something like this</p>
<p>for the terrascope, but it would be-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cheaper and easier to go above the atmosphere</p>
<p>and just fly out.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>It would be very, it&rsquo;s a very,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very challenging thing to do.</p>
<p>And normally when you do adaptive optics, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking straight up.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, or very close to straight up.</p>
<p>If you look at the horizon,</p>
<p>we basically never do astronomical observations</p>
<p>on the horizon,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re looking through more atmosphere.</p>
<p>If you go straight up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at the thinnest portion of atmosphere</p>
<p>possible.</p>
<p>But as you go closer and closer towards the horizon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re increasing what we call the air mass,</p>
<p>the amount of air you have to travel through.</p>
<p>So here it&rsquo;s kind of the worst case</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going through the entire atmosphere</p>
<p>in and out again with a terrascope.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d need a very impressive adaptive optics system</p>
<p>to correct for that.</p>
<p>So yeah, I would say it&rsquo;s probably simpler,</p>
<p>at least for proof of principle,</p>
<p>just to test it with having some satellite</p>
<p>that was at a much wider orbit.</p>
<p>Now, speaking of traveling out into deep space,</p>
<p>you already mentioned this a little bit.</p>
<p>You made a beautiful video</p>
<p>called The Journey to the End of the Universe.</p>
<p>And sort of at the start of that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about Alpha Centauri.</p>
<p>So what would it take for humans</p>
<p>or for human-like creatures to travel out to Alpha Centauri?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few different ways of doing it, I suppose.</p>
<p>One is, it depends on how fast your ship is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always gonna be the determining factor.</p>
<p>If we devised some interstellar propulsion system</p>
<p>that could travel a fraction of the speed of light,</p>
<p>then we could do it in our lifetimes,</p>
<p>which is, I think, what people normally dream of</p>
<p>when they think about interstellar propulsion and travel,</p>
<p>that you could literally step onto the spacecraft.</p>
<p>Maybe a few years later,</p>
<p>you step off an Alpha Centauri B,</p>
<p>you walk around the surface</p>
<p>and come back and visit your family.</p>
<p>There would be, of course,</p>
<p>a lot of relativistic time dilation</p>
<p>as a result of that trip.</p>
<p>You would have aged a lot less than people back on Earth</p>
<p>by traveling close to the speed of light</p>
<p>for some fraction of time.</p>
<p>The challenge of this, of course,</p>
<p>is that we have no such propulsion system</p>
<p>that can achieve this.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>But do you think it&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>Like, so you have a paper called The Halo Drive,</p>
<p>fuel-free relativistic propulsion of large masses</p>
<p>via recycled boomerang photons.</p>
<p>So do you think, first of all, what is that?</p>
<p>And second of all,</p>
<p>how difficult are alternate propulsion systems?</p>
<p>Yeah, so before I took on The Halo Drive,</p>
<p>there was an idea,</p>
<p>because I think The Halo Drive</p>
<p>is not gonna solve this problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about The Halo Drive in a moment,</p>
<p>but The Halo Drive is useful for a civilization</p>
<p>which is a bit more advanced than us,</p>
<p>that has spread across the stars,</p>
<p>and is looking for a cheap highway system</p>
<p>to get across the galaxy.</p>
<p>For that first step,</p>
<p>because just to context that,</p>
<p>The Halo Drive requires a black hole.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to do this</p>
<p>on the Earth right now.</p>
<p>But there are lots of black holes in the Milky Way,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the good news.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll come to that in a moment.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re trying to travel to Alpha Centauri</p>
<p>without a black hole,</p>
<p>then there are some ideas out there.</p>
<p>There was a Project Daedalus and Project Icarus</p>
<p>that were two projects</p>
<p>that the British Interplanetary Society conjured up</p>
<p>on sort of a 20, 30 year timescale.</p>
<p>And they asked themselves,</p>
<p>if we took existing and speculatively,</p>
<p>but realistic attempts at future technology</p>
<p>that are emerging over the next few decades,</p>
<p>how far could we push into that travel system?</p>
<p>And they settled on fusion drives in that.</p>
<p>So if we had the ability to essentially either detonate,</p>
<p>you can always imagine that kind of nuclear fission</p>
<p>or nuclear fusion bombs going off behind the spacecraft</p>
<p>and propelling it that way,</p>
<p>or having some kind of successful nuclear fusion reaction,</p>
<p>which obviously we haven&rsquo;t really demonstrated yet</p>
<p>as a propulsion system,</p>
<p>then you could achieve something like 10%</p>
<p>the speed of light in those systems.</p>
<p>But these are huge spacecrafts.</p>
<p>And I think you need a huge spacecraft</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna take people along.</p>
<p>The conversation recently has actually switched</p>
<p>and that idea is kind of seems a little bit antiquated now.</p>
<p>And most of us have kind of given up on the idea</p>
<p>of people physically, biologically</p>
<p>stepping on board the spacecraft.</p>
<p>And maybe we&rsquo;ll be sending something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more like a microprobe</p>
<p>that maybe just weighs a gram or two.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s much easier to accelerate.</p>
<p>You could push that with a laser system to very high speed,</p>
<p>get it to maybe 20% the speed of light.</p>
<p>It has to survive the journey.</p>
<p>Probably a large fraction of them won&rsquo;t survive the journey,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re cheap enough</p>
<p>that you could maybe manufacture millions of them.</p>
<p>And some of them do arrive and able to send back an image</p>
<p>or maybe even if you wanted to have a person there,</p>
<p>we might have some way of doing like a telepresence</p>
<p>or some kind of delayed telepresence</p>
<p>or some kind of reconstruction of the planet</p>
<p>which is sent back</p>
<p>so you can digitally interact with that environment</p>
<p>in a way which is not real time,</p>
<p>but representative of what that planet</p>
<p>would be like to be on the surface.</p>
<p>So we might be more like digital visitors to these planets,</p>
<p>certainly far easier practically to do that</p>
<p>than physically forcing this wet chunk of meat</p>
<p>to fly across space to do that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s maybe something</p>
<p>we can imagine down the road.</p>
<p>The Halo Drive, as I said, is thinking even further ahead.</p>
<p>And if you did want to launch large masses,</p>
<p>large masses could even be planet-sized things</p>
<p>in the case of the Halo Drive,</p>
<p>you can use black holes.</p>
<p>So this is kind of a trick of physics.</p>
<p>You know, I often think of the universe</p>
<p>as like a big computer game</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to find cheat codes, hacks,</p>
<p>exploits that the universe didn&rsquo;t intend for you to use.</p>
<p>But once you find them,</p>
<p>you can address all sorts of interesting capabilities</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t previously have.</p>
<p>And the Halo Drive does that with black holes.</p>
<p>So if you have two black holes,</p>
<p>which is a very common situation,</p>
<p>a binary black hole,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in spiraling towards each other,</p>
<p>LIGO has detected, I think, dozens of these things,</p>
<p>maybe even over a hundred at this point.</p>
<p>And these things, as they merge together,</p>
<p>the pre-merger phase,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re orbiting each other very, very fast,</p>
<p>even close to the speed of light.</p>
<p>And so Freeman Dyson, before he passed away,</p>
<p>I think in the 70s,</p>
<p>he had this provocative paper called Gravitational Machines,</p>
<p>and he suggested that you could use neutron stars</p>
<p>as a interstellar propulsion system.</p>
<p>And neutron stars are sort of the lower mass version</p>
<p>of a binary black hole system, essentially.</p>
<p>In this case,</p>
<p>he suggested just doing gravitational slingshot,</p>
<p>just fly your spacecraft into this very compact</p>
<p>and relativistic binary system.</p>
<p>And you do need neutron stars</p>
<p>because if there were two stars,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be physically touching each other.</p>
<p>So the neutron stars are so small,</p>
<p>like 10 kilometers across,</p>
<p>they can get really close to each other</p>
<p>and have these very, very fast orbits</p>
<p>with respect to each other.</p>
<p>You shoot your spacecraft through,</p>
<p>right through the middle,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s flying through the eye of a needle,</p>
<p>and you do a slingshot around one of them,</p>
<p>and you do it around the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming sort of towards you.</p>
<p>So one will be coming away,</p>
<p>one will be coming towards you at any one point.</p>
<p>And then you could basically steal</p>
<p>some of the kinetic energy in the slingshot.</p>
<p>In principle, you can set up to twice the speed.</p>
<p>You can take your speed,</p>
<p>and it becomes your speed</p>
<p>plus twice the speed of the neutron star in this case.</p>
<p>And that would be your new speed after the slingshot.</p>
<p>This seems great because it&rsquo;s just free energy, basically.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not doing any,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not generating to have a nuclear power reactor</p>
<p>or anything to generate this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just stealing it.</p>
<p>And indeed, you can get to relativistic speeds this way.</p>
<p>So I loved that paper,</p>
<p>but I had a criticism.</p>
<p>And the criticism was that this is like</p>
<p>trying to fly your ship into a blender, right?</p>
<p>This is two neutron stars,</p>
<p>which have huge tidal forces.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re whipping around each other</p>
<p>once every second or even less than a second.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to fly your spaceship</p>
<p>and do this maneuver that is pretty precarious.</p>
<p>And so it just didn&rsquo;t seem practical to me</p>
<p>to have to do this, but I loved it.</p>
<p>And so I took that idea,</p>
<p>and this is how science is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s iterative.</p>
<p>You take a previous great man&rsquo;s idea</p>
<p>and you just sort of maybe slightly tweak it and improve it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I see the Hiller drive.</p>
<p>And I just suggested,</p>
<p>why not replace those out for black holes?</p>
<p>Which is certainly very common.</p>
<p>And rather than flying your ship</p>
<p>into that hell hole of a blender system,</p>
<p>you just stand back and you fire a laser beam.</p>
<p>Now, because black holes</p>
<p>have such intense gravitational fields,</p>
<p>they can bend light into complete 180s.</p>
<p>They can actually become mirrors.</p>
<p>So the sun bends light by maybe a fraction of a degree</p>
<p>through gravitational lensing,</p>
<p>but a compact object like a black hole can do a full 180.</p>
<p>In fact, obviously, if you went too close,</p>
<p>if you put the laser beam too close,</p>
<p>the black hole would just fall into it</p>
<p>and never come back out.</p>
<p>So you just kind of push it out, push it out, push it out</p>
<p>until you get to a point</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just skirting the event horizon.</p>
<p>And then that laser beam skirts around and it comes back.</p>
<p>Now, the laser beam wants to do a,</p>
<p>I mean, it is doing a gravitational slingshot,</p>
<p>but laser, I mean, light photons can&rsquo;t speed up</p>
<p>unlike the spaceship case.</p>
<p>So instead of speeding up,</p>
<p>the way they steal energy is they increase their frequency.</p>
<p>So they become higher energy photon packets, essentially.</p>
<p>They get blue shifted so that you send</p>
<p>maybe a red laser beam that comes back blue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got more energy in it.</p>
<p>And because photons carry momentum,</p>
<p>which is somewhat unintuitive in everyday experience,</p>
<p>but they do, that&rsquo;s how solar sails work.</p>
<p>They carry momentum, they push things.</p>
<p>You can even use them as laser tweezers</p>
<p>and things to pick things up.</p>
<p>Because they push,</p>
<p>it comes back with more momentum than it left.</p>
<p>So you get an acceleration force from this.</p>
<p>And again, you&rsquo;re just seeing energy</p>
<p>from the black hole to do that.</p>
<p>So you can get up to the same speed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically the same idea as Freeman Dyson,</p>
<p>but doing it from a safer distance.</p>
<p>And there should be of order of a million or so</p>
<p>or 10 million black holes in the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
<p>Some of them would be even as close</p>
<p>as sort of 10 to 20 light years</p>
<p>when you do the occurrence rate statistics</p>
<p>of how close you might expect, feasibly want to be.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re of course difficult to detect because they&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re inherently hard to see.</p>
<p>But statistically, there should be plenty out there</p>
<p>in the Milky Way.</p>
<p>And so these objects would be natural waypoint stations.</p>
<p>You could use them to both accelerate away</p>
<p>and to break and slow down.</p>
<p>And on top of all this,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ve been talking about astronomy and cosmology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of exciting breakthroughs</p>
<p>in detection and exploration of black holes.</p>
<p>So the boomerang photons that you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of work on photon rings</p>
<p>and just all the fun stuff going on outside the black holes.</p>
<p>So all the garbage outside is actually might be the thing</p>
<p>that holds a key to understanding what&rsquo;s going on inside.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the Hawking radiation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of fascinating stuff like,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s trippy stuff about black holes</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t even, well, most people don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I mean, the holographic principle with the plate</p>
<p>and the information being stored potentially outside</p>
<p>of the black hole.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even, I can&rsquo;t even comprehend</p>
<p>how you can project a three-dimensional object</p>
<p>onto a 2D and somehow store information</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t destroy it.</p>
<p>And if it does destroy it, challenging all the physics.</p>
<p>All of this is very interesting,</p>
<p>especially for kind of more practical applications</p>
<p>of how the black hole can be used for propulsion.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it may be that black holes are used</p>
<p>in all sorts of ways by advanced civilizations.</p>
<p>I think, again, it&rsquo;s been a popular idea</p>
<p>in science fiction or science fiction trope</p>
<p>that Sagittarius A star, the supermassive black hole</p>
<p>in a centrified galaxy could be the best place</p>
<p>to look for intelligent life in the universe</p>
<p>because it is a giant engine in a way.</p>
<p>You know, a unique capability of a black hole</p>
<p>is you can basically throw matter into it</p>
<p>and you can get these jets that come out,</p>
<p>the accretion disks and the jets that fly out.</p>
<p>And so you can more or less use them to convert matter</p>
<p>into energy V equals MC squared.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s pretty much nothing else</p>
<p>except for annihilation with its own antiparticle</p>
<p>as a way of doing that.</p>
<p>So they have some unique properties.</p>
<p>You could perhaps power a civilization</p>
<p>by just throwing garbage into a black hole, right?</p>
<p>Just throwing asteroids in and power your civilization</p>
<p>with as much energy as you really would ever plausibly need.</p>
<p>And you could also use them to accelerate</p>
<p>away across the universe.</p>
<p>And you can even imagine using small artificial black holes</p>
<p>as thermal generators, right?</p>
<p>So the Hawking radiation from them</p>
<p>kind of exponentially increases</p>
<p>as they get smaller and smaller in size.</p>
<p>And so a very small black hole,</p>
<p>one that you can almost imagine like holding in your hand</p>
<p>would be a fairly significant heat source.</p>
<p>And so that raises all sorts of prospects</p>
<p>about how you might use that in an engineering context</p>
<p>to power your civilization as well.</p>
<p>Oh, you have a video</p>
<p>on becoming a Kardashev Type I civilization.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s our hope for doing that?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a few orders of magnitude away from that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is surprising.</p>
<p>I think people tend to think</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re close to this scale.</p>
<p>The Kardashev Type I is defined as a civilization</p>
<p>which is using as much energy</p>
<p>as is essentially incident upon the planet from the star.</p>
<p>So as of order, I think for the Earth</p>
<p>of something like 10 to the five terawatts</p>
<p>or 10 to the seven terawatts</p>
<p>is a gigantic amount of energy.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re using a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction</p>
<p>of that right now.</p>
<p>So if you became a Kardashev Type I civilization,</p>
<p>which is seen not necessarily as a goal into itself,</p>
<p>I think people think, well, why are we aspiring</p>
<p>to become this energy hungry civilization?</p>
<p>Surely our energy needs might improve our efficiency</p>
<p>or something as time goes on.</p>
<p>But ultimately the more energy you have access to,</p>
<p>the greater your capabilities will be.</p>
<p>I mean, if you wanna lift Mount Everest into space,</p>
<p>there is just a calculable amount of potential energy change</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s going to take in order to accomplish that.</p>
<p>And the more energy you have access to as a civilization,</p>
<p>then clearly the easier that energy achievement</p>
<p>is going to be.</p>
<p>So it depends on what your aspirations are</p>
<p>as a civilization.</p>
<p>It might not be something you wanna ever do, but.</p>
<p>Well, but we should make clear</p>
<p>that lifting heavy things isn&rsquo;t the only thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just doing work.</p>
<p>So it could be computation.</p>
<p>It could be more and more and more and more sophisticated</p>
<p>and larger and larger and larger computation,</p>
<p>which is, it does seem where we&rsquo;re headed</p>
<p>with the very fast increase in the scale</p>
<p>and the quality of our computation</p>
<p>outside the human brain, artificial computation.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, computation is a great example of,</p>
<p>I mean, already I think something like 10%</p>
<p>of US power electricity use</p>
<p>is going towards the supercomputing centers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a vast amount of current energy needs</p>
<p>which are already going towards computing</p>
<p>and will surely only increase over time.</p>
<p>If we start ever doing anything like mind uploading</p>
<p>or creating simulated realities,</p>
<p>that cost will surely become almost a dominant source</p>
<p>of our energy requirements at that point</p>
<p>if civilization completely moves over</p>
<p>to this kind of post-humanism stage.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not unreasonable that our energy needs</p>
<p>would continue to grow.</p>
<p>Certainly historically, they always have</p>
<p>at about 2% per year.</p>
<p>And so if that continues,</p>
<p>there is gonna be a certain point</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re running up against the amount of energy</p>
<p>which you can harvest</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>even if you cover the entire planet in solar panels,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no more energy to be had.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a few ways of achieving this.</p>
<p>I sort of talked about in the video</p>
<p>how there were several renewable energy sources</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re excited about,</p>
<p>like geothermal, wind power, waves,</p>
<p>but pretty much all of those</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really scratch the surface</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t really scratch the itch</p>
<p>of getting to a Kardashev type one civilization.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re meaningful now.</p>
<p>I would never tell anybody don&rsquo;t do wind power now</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s clearly useful</p>
<p>at our current stage of civilization,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna be a pretty negligible fraction</p>
<p>of our energy requirements</p>
<p>if we got to that stage of development.</p>
<p>And so there has to be a breakthrough</p>
<p>in either our ability to harvest solar energy,</p>
<p>which would require maybe something like a space array</p>
<p>of solar panels of beaming the energy back down,</p>
<p>or some developments and innovations in nuclear fusion</p>
<p>that would allow us to essentially</p>
<p>reproduce the same process</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s producing the solar photons, but here on Earth.</p>
<p>But even that comes with some consequences.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re generating the energy here on Earth</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing work on it on Earth,</p>
<p>then that work is gonna produce waste heat,</p>
<p>and that waste heat is gonna increase</p>
<p>the ambient temperature of the planet.</p>
<p>And so even if this isn&rsquo;t really a greenhouse effect</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re increasing the temperature of the planet,</p>
<p>this is just the amount of computers that are churning.</p>
<p>You put your hand to a computer,</p>
<p>you can feel the warmth coming off them.</p>
<p>If you do that much work of literally</p>
<p>the entire instant energy of the planet is doing that work,</p>
<p>the planet&rsquo;s gonna warm up significantly</p>
<p>as a result of that.</p>
<p>And so that clearly indicates</p>
<p>that this is not a sustainable path,</p>
<p>that civilizations, as they approach Kailashev Type I,</p>
<p>are gonna have to leave planet Earth,</p>
<p>which is really the point of that video,</p>
<p>to show that it&rsquo;s, a Kailashev Type I civilization,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s defined as instant energy upon a planet,</p>
<p>that is not a species that is gonna still be living</p>
<p>on their planet, at least in isolation.</p>
<p>They will have to be harvesting energy from afar,</p>
<p>they will have to be doing work on that energy</p>
<p>outside of their planet,</p>
<p>because otherwise you&rsquo;re gonna dramatically change</p>
<p>the environment in which you live.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, so the more energy you create,</p>
<p>the more energy you use,</p>
<p>the more, the higher the imperative</p>
<p>to expand out into the universe,</p>
<p>but also not just the imperative, but the capabilities.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve kind of, as a side on your lab page,</p>
<p>mentioned that you&rsquo;re sometimes interested</p>
<p>in astroengineering, so what kind of space architectures</p>
<p>do you think we can build to house humans</p>
<p>that are interesting things outside of Earth?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of fun ideas here.</p>
<p>One of the classic ideas is an O&rsquo;Neill cylinder,</p>
<p>or a Stanford torus.</p>
<p>These are like two rotating structures</p>
<p>that were devised in space.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically using the centrifugal force</p>
<p>as artificial gravity, and so these are structures</p>
<p>which tend to be many kilometers across</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re building in space,</p>
<p>but could potentially habitat millions of people</p>
<p>in orbit of the Earth.</p>
<p>Of course, you could imagine putting them,</p>
<p>if the expanse does a pretty good job, I think,</p>
<p>of exploring the idea of human exploration</p>
<p>of the solar system and having many objects,</p>
<p>many of the small near-Earth objects and asteroids</p>
<p>inhabited by mining colonies.</p>
<p>One of the ideas we&rsquo;ve played around with our group</p>
<p>is this technology called a quasite.</p>
<p>A quasite is an extension, again,</p>
<p>we always tend to extend previous ideas.</p>
<p>Ideas build upon ideas.</p>
<p>An extension idea called a statite.</p>
<p>A statite was an idea proposed, I think,</p>
<p>by Ron Forwood in the 1970s.</p>
<p>1970s seemed to have all sorts of wacky ideas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what was going on then.</p>
<p>I think the Stanford torus, the O&rsquo;Neill cylinder, statites,</p>
<p>the gravitational lens, people were really having fun</p>
<p>with dreaming about space in the 70s.</p>
<p>The statite is basically a solar sail,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s such an efficient solar sail</p>
<p>that the outward force of radiation pressure</p>
<p>equals the inward force of gravity from the sun.</p>
<p>And so it doesn&rsquo;t need to orbit.</p>
<p>Normally you avoid, the sun is pulling on us right now</p>
<p>through force of gravity, but we are not getting closer</p>
<p>towards the sun, even though we are falling towards the sun</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re in orbit, which means our translational speed</p>
<p>is just enough to keep us at the same altitude,</p>
<p>essentially, from the sun.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re in orbit,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how you maintain distance.</p>
<p>A statite doesn&rsquo;t need to do that.</p>
<p>It could be basically completely static in inertial space,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just balancing the two forces</p>
<p>of radiation pressure and inward gravitational pressure.</p>
<p>A quasite is the in-between of those two states.</p>
<p>So it has some significant outward pressure,</p>
<p>but not enough to resist fully falling into the star.</p>
<p>And so it compensates for that</p>
<p>by having some translational motion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in between an orbit and a statite.</p>
<p>And so what that allows you to do</p>
<p>is maintain artificial orbits.</p>
<p>So normally, if you want to calculate your orbital speed</p>
<p>of something at, say, half an AU,</p>
<p>you would use Kepler&rsquo;s third law and go through that,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d say, okay, if it&rsquo;s at half an AU,</p>
<p>I can calculate the period by p squared</p>
<p>as proportional to a cubed and go through that.</p>
<p>But for a quasite, you can basically have any speed you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of how much of the gravitational force</p>
<p>are you balancing out.</p>
<p>You effectively enter an orbit</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re making the mass of the star</p>
<p>be less massive than it really is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s as if you were orbiting a 0.1 solar mass star</p>
<p>or a 0.2 solar mass star, whatever you want.</p>
<p>And so that means that Mercury orbits</p>
<p>with a pretty fast orbital speed around the sun</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s closer to the sun than we are.</p>
<p>But we could put something in Mercury&rsquo;s orbit</p>
<p>that would have a slower speed,</p>
<p>and so it would co-track with the Earth.</p>
<p>And so we would always be aligned with them at all times.</p>
<p>And so this could be useful</p>
<p>if you wanted to have either a chain of colonies</p>
<p>or something that were able to easily communicate</p>
<p>and move between one another, between these different bases.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably use something like this</p>
<p>to maintain that easy transferability.</p>
<p>Or you could even use it</p>
<p>as a space weather monitoring system,</p>
<p>which was actually proposed in the paper.</p>
<p>We know that major events like the Carrington event</p>
<p>that happened, it can knock out</p>
<p>all of our electromagnetic systems quite easily.</p>
<p>A major solar flare could do that, a geomagnetic storm.</p>
<p>But if we had the ability to detect</p>
<p>those higher elevated activity cycles in advance,</p>
<p>the problem is they travel, obviously, pretty fast,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s hard to get ahead of them.</p>
<p>But you could have a station</p>
<p>which is basically sampling solar flares</p>
<p>very close to the surface of the Earth,</p>
<p>and as soon as it detects anything suspicious magnetically,</p>
<p>it could then send that information</p>
<p>straight back at the speed of light to your Earth</p>
<p>and give you maybe a half an hour warning or something,</p>
<p>that something bad was coming,</p>
<p>and you should shut off all your systems</p>
<p>or get in your Faraday cage now and protect yourself.</p>
<p>And so these quasites are kind of a cool trick</p>
<p>of, again, kind of hacking the laws of physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like another one of these exploits</p>
<p>that the universe seems to allow us to do</p>
<p>to potentially manifest these artificial systems</p>
<p>that would otherwise be difficult to produce.</p>
<p>So leveraging natural phenomena.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the key, is to work,</p>
<p>in my mind, is to work with nature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I see astroengineering, rather than against it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not trying to force it to do something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I always think solar energy is so powerful,</p>
<p>because in the battle against nuclear fusion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really fighting a battle</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to confine plasma</p>
<p>into this extremely tight space.</p>
<p>The sun does this for free.</p>
<p>It has gravitation.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, in essence, what a solar panel does.</p>
<p>It is a nuclear fusion reactor-fueled energy system,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just using gravitation for the confinement</p>
<p>and having a huge standoff distance</p>
<p>for its energy collection.</p>
<p>And so there are tricks like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very naive, simple trick in that case,</p>
<p>where we can, rather than having to reinvent the wheel,</p>
<p>we can use the space infrastructure, if you like,</p>
<p>the astrophysical infrastructure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already there to our benefit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think in the long arc of human history,</p>
<p>probably natural phenomena is the right solution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the simple, that&rsquo;s the elegant solution,</p>
<p>because all the power&rsquo;s already there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why a Dyson sphere in the long, sort of,</p>
<p>well, you don&rsquo;t know what a Dyson sphere would look like,</p>
<p>but some kind of thing that leverages the power,</p>
<p>the energy that&rsquo;s already in the sun,</p>
<p>is better than creating artificial nuclear fusion reaction.</p>
<p>But then again, that brings us to the topic of AI.</p>
<p>How much of this, if we&rsquo;re traveling out there,</p>
<p>interstellar travel, or doing some of the interesting things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>how much of those ships would be occupied</p>
<p>by AI systems, do you think?</p>
<p>What would the,</p>
<p>what would be the living organisms occupying those ships?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s depressing to think about AI</p>
<p>in the search for life, because it has,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot</p>
<p>over the last few weeks with playing around</p>
<p>with Chat GPT-3, like many of us,</p>
<p>and being astonished with its capabilities.</p>
<p>And you see that our society is undergoing a change</p>
<p>that seems significant in terms of the development</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been promised this revolution,</p>
<p>this singularity for a long time,</p>
<p>but it really seems to be stepping up</p>
<p>its pace of development at this point.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s interesting, because as someone</p>
<p>who looks for alien life out there in the universe,</p>
<p>it sort of implies that our current stage of development</p>
<p>is highly transitional, and that, you know,</p>
<p>you go back for the last four and a half billion years,</p>
<p>the planet was dumb, essentially.</p>
<p>If you go back the last few thousand years,</p>
<p>there was a civilization,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t really producing any technosignatures.</p>
<p>And then over the last maybe hundred years,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been something that might be detectable from afar.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re potentially approaching this cusp</p>
<p>where we might imagine it, I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re thinking of like maybe years and decades</p>
<p>with AI development, typically when we talk about this,</p>
<p>but as an astronomer, I have to think about</p>
<p>much longer timescales of centuries,</p>
<p>millennia, millions of years.</p>
<p>And so if this wave continues over that timescale,</p>
<p>which is still the blink of an eye on a cosmic timescale,</p>
<p>that implies that everything will be AI,</p>
<p>essentially, out there,</p>
<p>if this is a common behavior.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s intriguing,</p>
<p>because it sort of implies that we are special</p>
<p>in terms of our moment in time as a civilization,</p>
<p>which normally is something</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re averse to as astronomers.</p>
<p>We normally like this mediocrity principle,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not special, we&rsquo;re a typical part of the universe,</p>
<p>similar to the cosmological principle.</p>
<p>But in a temporal sense, we may be in a unique location.</p>
<p>And perhaps that is part of the solution</p>
<p>to the Fermi paradox, in fact,</p>
<p>that if it is true that planets tend to go through</p>
<p>basically three phases,</p>
<p>dumb life for the vast majority,</p>
<p>a brief period of biological intelligence,</p>
<p>and then an extended period of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>that they transition to,</p>
<p>then we would be at a unique and special moment</p>
<p>in galactic history that would be of particular interest</p>
<p>for any anthropologists out there in the galaxy, right?</p>
<p>This would be the time</p>
<p>that you would want to study a civilization very carefully.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want to interfere with it,</p>
<p>you would just want to see how it plays out.</p>
<p>Kind of similar to the ancestor simulations,</p>
<p>though sometimes talked over the simulation argument,</p>
<p>that you are able to observe perhaps your own origins</p>
<p>and study how the transformation happens.</p>
<p>And so yeah, that has for me recently been throwing</p>
<p>the Fermi paradox a bit on its head.</p>
<p>And this idea of the zoo hypothesis that we may be monitored</p>
<p>which has for a long time been sort of seen as a fringe idea</p>
<p>even amongst the SETI community.</p>
<p>But if we live in this truly transitional period,</p>
<p>it adds a lot of impetus to that idea, I think.</p>
<p>Well, even AI itself would,</p>
<p>by its very nature, would be observing us.</p>
<p>By, you know, it&rsquo;s like a human,</p>
<p>there used to be this concept of human computation,</p>
<p>which is actually exactly what&rsquo;s feeding</p>
<p>the current language models,</p>
<p>which is leveraging all the busy stuff we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>to do the hard work of learning.</p>
<p>So like the language models are trained</p>
<p>on human interaction and human language on the internet.</p>
<p>And so AI feeds on the output of brain power from humans.</p>
<p>And so like it would be observing and observing</p>
<p>and it gets stronger as it observes.</p>
<p>So it actually gets extremely good at observing humans.</p>
<p>And one of the interesting philosophical questions</p>
<p>that starts percolating is what makes us,</p>
<p>what is the interesting thing that makes us human?</p>
<p>We tend to think of it,</p>
<p>and you said like there&rsquo;s three phases.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s hard to come by in phase three?</p>
<p>Is it something like scarcity, which is limited resources?</p>
<p>Is it something like consciousness?</p>
<p>Is that the thing that&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>that emerged the evolutionary process in biological systems</p>
<p>that are operating under constrained resources?</p>
<p>This thing that feels,</p>
<p>that it feels like something to experience the world,</p>
<p>which we think of as consciousness,</p>
<p>is that really difficult to replicate in artificial systems?</p>
<p>Is that the thing that makes us fundamentally human?</p>
<p>Or is it just a side effect</p>
<p>that we attribute way too much importance to?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense,</p>
<p>if we look out into the future and AI systems</p>
<p>are the ones that are traveling out there</p>
<p>to Alpha Centauri and beyond,</p>
<p>do you think they have to carry</p>
<p>the flame of consciousness with them?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily.</p>
<p>They may do, but they may,</p>
<p>it may not be unnecessarily,</p>
<p>I mean, I guess we&rsquo;re talking about the difference here</p>
<p>between sort of an AGI, artificial general intelligence,</p>
<p>or consciousness, which are distinct ideas,</p>
<p>and you can certainly have one without the other.</p>
<p>So I could imagine.</p>
<p>I would disagree with this certainly in that statement.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>in order to have intelligence,</p>
<p>you have to have consciousness.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I mean, to a certain degree,</p>
<p>GPT-3 has a level of intelligence already.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a general intelligence,</p>
<p>but it displays properties of intelligence</p>
<p>with no consciousness, so.</p>
<p>Again, I would disagree.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Because you said, it&rsquo;s very nice that you said</p>
<p>it displays properties of intelligence</p>
<p>in the same way it displays properties of intelligence,</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s starting to display</p>
<p>properties of consciousness.</p>
<p>It certainly could fool you that it&rsquo;s conscious.</p>
<p>Correct, yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, I guess, like a Turing test problem.</p>
<p>Like, if it&rsquo;s displaying all those properties,</p>
<p>if it quacks like a parrot, looks like a parrot,</p>
<p>or quacks like a duck,</p>
<p>things like, isn&rsquo;t it basically a duck at that point?</p>
<p>So yeah, I can see that argument.</p>
<p>It probably, I mean, certainly as an,</p>
<p>I tried to think about it</p>
<p>from the observer&rsquo;s point of view as an astronomer.</p>
<p>What am I looking for?</p>
<p>Whether that intelligence is conscious or not</p>
<p>has little bearing, I think,</p>
<p>as to what I should be looking for</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m trying to detect evidence of them.</p>
<p>It would maybe affect their behavior</p>
<p>in ways that I can&rsquo;t predict.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, again, getting into the game</p>
<p>of what I would call xenopsychology,</p>
<p>of trying to make projections</p>
<p>about the motivations of an alien species</p>
<p>is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>And similarly, for any kind of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unfathomable what its intentions may be.</p>
<p>I mean, I would sort of question</p>
<p>whether it would even be interested</p>
<p>in traveling between the stars at all.</p>
<p>If its primary goal is computation,</p>
<p>computation for the sake of computation,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s probably gonna have a different way of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be engineering its solar system</p>
<p>and the nearby material around it for a different goal</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s just simply trying to increase</p>
<p>computer substrate across the universe.</p>
<p>And that, of course, if that is its principal intention</p>
<p>to just essentially convert dumb matter</p>
<p>into smart matter as it goes,</p>
<p>then I think that would come into conflict</p>
<p>with our observations of the universe, right?</p>
<p>Because the Earth shouldn&rsquo;t be here if that were true.</p>
<p>The Earth should have been transformed</p>
<p>into computer substrate by this point.</p>
<p>There has been plenty of time</p>
<p>in the history of the galaxy for that to have happened.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m skeptical that we can,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical in the part that that&rsquo;s a behavior</p>
<p>that AI or any civilization really engages in,</p>
<p>but I also find it difficult to find a way out of it,</p>
<p>to explain why that would never happen</p>
<p>in the entire history of the galaxy</p>
<p>amongst potentially, if life is common,</p>
<p>millions, maybe even billions of instant instantiations</p>
<p>of AI could have occurred across the galaxy.</p>
<p>And so that seems to be a knock against the idea</p>
<p>that there is life else, or intelligent life else</p>
<p>around in the galaxy.</p>
<p>The fact that that hasn&rsquo;t occurred in our history</p>
<p>is maybe the only solid data point we really have</p>
<p>about the activities of other civilizations.</p>
<p>Of course, the scary one could be that</p>
<p>we just at this stage,</p>
<p>intelligent alien civilizations</p>
<p>just started destroying themselves.</p>
<p>It becomes too powerful.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s just too many weapons,</p>
<p>too many nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>too many nuclear weapon style systems</p>
<p>that just from mistake to aggression,</p>
<p>like the probability of self-destruction is too high</p>
<p>relative to the challenge of avoiding,</p>
<p>the technological challenges of avoiding self-destruction.</p>
<p>Do you mean that the AI destroys itself,</p>
<p>or we destroy ourselves prior to the advent of AI?</p>
<p>As we get smarter and smarter,</p>
<p>AI, either AI destroys us or other,</p>
<p>there could be just a million,</p>
<p>like AI is correlated,</p>
<p>the development of AI is correlated</p>
<p>with all this other technological innovation.</p>
<p>Genetic engineering,</p>
<p>all kinds of engineering at the nanoscale,</p>
<p>mass manufacture of things that could destroy us,</p>
<p>cracking physics enough to have very powerful weapons,</p>
<p>nuclear weapons, all of it, just too much.</p>
<p>Physics enables way too many things that can destroy us</p>
<p>before it enables the propulsion systems</p>
<p>that allow us to fly far enough away</p>
<p>before we destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s what happens</p>
<p>to the other alien civilizations.</p>
<p>Is that your resolution?</p>
<p>Because I mean, I think us in the technosignature community</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t thinking about this problem seriously enough,</p>
<p>in my opinion.</p>
<p>We should be thinking about what AI is doing to our society</p>
<p>and the implications, what we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>And so the only, I think part of this thinking</p>
<p>has to involve people like yourself</p>
<p>who are more intimate with the machine learning</p>
<p>and artificial intelligence world.</p>
<p>How do you reconcile in your mind,</p>
<p>you said earlier that you think</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t imagine a galaxy where life and intelligence</p>
<p>is not all over the place.</p>
<p>And if artificial intelligence is a natural progression</p>
<p>for civilizations, how do you reconcile that</p>
<p>with the absence of any information around us?</p>
<p>So any clues or hints of artificial behavior,</p>
<p>artificially engineered stars or colonization,</p>
<p>computer substrate, transform planets, anything like that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely difficult for me.</p>
<p>The Fermi paradox broadly defined</p>
<p>is extremely difficult for me.</p>
<p>And the terrifying thing is one thing I suspect</p>
<p>is that we keep destroying ourselves.</p>
<p>The probability of self-destruction</p>
<p>with advanced technology is just extremely high.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re not seeing it.</p>
<p>But then again, my intuition about why we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>blown ourselves up with nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very surprising to me from a scientific perspective.</p>
<p>Given all the cruelty I&rsquo;ve seen in the world,</p>
<p>given the power that nuclear weapons place in the hands</p>
<p>of a very small number of individuals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very surprising to me that we destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>And it seems to be a very low probability situation</p>
<p>we have happening here.</p>
<p>But, and then the other explanation is the zoo,</p>
<p>is the observation that we&rsquo;re just being observed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only other thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s so difficult for me.</p>
<p>Of course, all of science, everything is very humbling.</p>
<p>It would be very humbling for me to learn</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re alone in the universe.</p>
<p>It would change, you know what?</p>
<p>Maybe I do want that to be true</p>
<p>because you want us to be special.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m resisting that thought maybe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way we&rsquo;re that special.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way we&rsquo;re that special.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where my resistance comes from.</p>
<p>I would just say, you know, the specialness is something,</p>
<p>we, implicitly in that statement,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of an assumption</p>
<p>that we are something positive.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re a gift to this planet or something</p>
<p>and that makes us special.</p>
<p>But it may be that intelligence is more of an,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re like rats or cockroaches.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re an infestation of this planet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not some benevolent property</p>
<p>that a planet would ideally like to have,</p>
<p>if you can even say such a thing.</p>
<p>We may be not only generally a negative force</p>
<p>for a planet&rsquo;s biosphere and its own survivability,</p>
<p>which I think you can make a strong argument about,</p>
<p>but we may also be a very persistent infestation</p>
<p>that may, even in, you know, interesting thoughts,</p>
<p>in the wake of a nuclear war,</p>
<p>would that be an absolute eradication of every human being,</p>
<p>which would be a fairly extreme event?</p>
<p>Or would the candela consciousness,</p>
<p>as you might call it, the flame of consciousness,</p>
<p>continue with some small pockets</p>
<p>that would maybe in 10,000 years, 100,000 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d see civilization reemerge</p>
<p>and play out the same thing over again?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s certainly,</p>
<p>but nuclear weapons aren&rsquo;t powerful enough yet.</p>
<p>But yes, but to sort of push back on the infestation,</p>
<p>sure, but the word special doesn&rsquo;t have to be positive.</p>
<p>I just mean-</p>
<p>I think it tends to imply, but I take your point, yeah.</p>
<p>But maybe, just maybe extremely rare might be.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that, to me, it&rsquo;s very strange</p>
<p>for me to be cosmically unique.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just very strange.</p>
<p>I mean, that we&rsquo;re the only thing</p>
<p>of this level of complexity in the galaxy</p>
<p>just seems very strange to me.</p>
<p>I would just, yeah, I do think it depends</p>
<p>on this classification.</p>
<p>I think there is sort of, again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of buried within there as a subtext,</p>
<p>but there is a classification that we&rsquo;re doing here</p>
<p>that what we are is a distinct category of life,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, in this case, when we&rsquo;re talking about intelligence</p>
<p>we are something that can be separated.</p>
<p>But of course, we see intelligence across the animal kingdom</p>
<p>in dolphins, humpback whales, octopuses,</p>
<p>crows, ravens, and so it&rsquo;s quite possible</p>
<p>that these are all manifestations of the same thing.</p>
<p>And we are not a particularly distinct class,</p>
<p>except for the fact we make technology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the only difference to our intelligence.</p>
<p>And we classify that separately,</p>
<p>but from a biological perspective, to some degree,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really just all part of a continuum.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why, when we talk about unique,</p>
<p>you are putting yourself in a box which is distinct</p>
<p>and saying this is the only example of things</p>
<p>that fall into this box.</p>
<p>But the walls of that box may themselves be a construct</p>
<p>of our own arrogance that we are something distinct.</p>
<p>But I was also speaking broadly for us,</p>
<p>meaning all life on earth,</p>
<p>but then it&rsquo;s possible that there&rsquo;s all kinds</p>
<p>of living ecosystems on other planets and other moons</p>
<p>that just don&rsquo;t have interest in technological development.</p>
<p>Maybe technological development is the parasitic thing</p>
<p>that destroys the organism broadly.</p>
<p>And then maybe that&rsquo;s actually one</p>
<p>of the fundamental realities.</p>
<p>Whatever broad way to categorize technological development,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the parasitic thing that just destroys itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cancer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re floating around, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re floating around this idea of the great filter</p>
<p>a little bit here.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re asking, where is this?</p>
<p>Does it lie ahead of us?</p>
<p>Nuclear war may be imminent.</p>
<p>That would be a filter that&rsquo;s ahead of us.</p>
<p>Or could it be behind us?</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s the advent of technology</p>
<p>that is genuinely a rare occurrence in the universe.</p>
<p>And that explains the Fermi paradox.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s something that obviously people have debated</p>
<p>and argued about in SETI for decades and decades.</p>
<p>But it remains a persistent,</p>
<p>people argue whether it should be really called</p>
<p>a paradox or not.</p>
<p>But it remains a consistent apparent contradiction</p>
<p>that you can make a very cogent argument</p>
<p>as to why you expect life and intelligence</p>
<p>to be common in the universe.</p>
<p>And yet everything, everything we know about the universe</p>
<p>is fully compatible with just us being here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a haunting thought.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not, I have no preference or desire</p>
<p>for that to be true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to impose that view on anyone.</p>
<p>But I do ask that we remain open-minded</p>
<p>until evidence has been collected either way.</p>
<p>The thing is, it&rsquo;s one of, if not the,</p>
<p>probably I would argue it&rsquo;s the most important question</p>
<p>facing human civilization, or the most interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think scientifically speaking,</p>
<p>what question is more important than,</p>
<p>somehow, there could be other ways to sneak up to it,</p>
<p>but it gets to the essence of what we are,</p>
<p>what these living organisms are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow seeing another kind helps us understand.</p>
<p>It speaks to the human condition,</p>
<p>helps us understand what it is to be human to some degree.</p>
<p>Um, I think, you know, I have tried to remain very agnostic</p>
<p>about the idea of life and intelligence.</p>
<p>One thing I try to be more optimistic about,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot with our searches</p>
<p>for life in the universe, is life in the past.</p>
<p>You can, I think it&rsquo;s actually not that hard</p>
<p>to imagine we are the only civilization</p>
<p>in the galaxy right now living.</p>
<p>Yeah, to this current extent.</p>
<p>But there may be very many extinct civilizations.</p>
<p>If each civilization has a typical lifetime</p>
<p>comparable to, let&rsquo;s say, AI is the demise of our own,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only a few hundred years of technological development,</p>
<p>or maybe 10,000 years if you go back</p>
<p>to the Neolithic Revolution, the dawn of agriculture.</p>
<p>You know, hardly anything in cosmic time span.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nothing, that&rsquo;s the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not surprising at all</p>
<p>that we would happen not to coexist with anyone else.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean nobody else was ever here.</p>
<p>And if other civilizations come to that same conclusion</p>
<p>and realization, maybe they scour the galaxy around them,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t find any evidence for intelligence,</p>
<p>then they have two options.</p>
<p>They can either give up on communication</p>
<p>and just say, well, it&rsquo;s never gonna happen.</p>
<p>We just may as well just, you know,</p>
<p>worry about what&rsquo;s happening here on our own planet.</p>
<p>Or they could attempt communication,</p>
<p>but communication through time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s almost the most selfless act of communication,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no hope of getting anything back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a philanthropic gift, almost,</p>
<p>to that other civilization that you can,</p>
<p>maybe it might just be nothing more than a monument,</p>
<p>which the pyramids essentially are,</p>
<p>a monument of their existence,</p>
<p>that these are the things they achieved,</p>
<p>this was their, you know, the things they believed in,</p>
<p>their language, their culture.</p>
<p>Or it could be maybe something more than that.</p>
<p>It could be sort of lessons from what they learned</p>
<p>in their own history.</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot recently about</p>
<p>how would we send a message</p>
<p>to other civilizations in the future?</p>
<p>Because that act of thinking seriously</p>
<p>about the engineering of how we would design it</p>
<p>would inform us about what we should be looking for,</p>
<p>and also perhaps be our best chance, quite frankly,</p>
<p>of ever making contact.</p>
<p>It might not be the contact we dream of,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still contact.</p>
<p>There would still be a record of our existence,</p>
<p>as pitiful as it might be</p>
<p>compared to a two-way communication.</p>
<p>And I love the humility behind that project,</p>
<p>that universal project.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of, it&rsquo;s humble.</p>
<p>It humbles you to the vast</p>
<p>temporal landscape of the universe,</p>
<p>just realizing our day-to-day lives,</p>
<p>all of us will be forgotten</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s nice to think about something</p>
<p>that sends a signal out to other, yeah.</p>
<p>Other life forms.</p>
<p>It was almost like a humility of acceptance as well,</p>
<p>of knowing that you have a terminal disease,</p>
<p>but your impact on the Earth</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to end with your death,</p>
<p>that it could go on beyond with what you leave behind</p>
<p>for others to discover with maybe the books you write</p>
<p>or what you leave in the literature.</p>
<p>Do you think launching the Roadster vehicle</p>
<p>out in space would have done better?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, the Roadster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what someone would make of that,</p>
<p>if they found it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, there have been quasi attempts at it</p>
<p>beyond the Roadster.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like plaques on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the Pioneer plaques,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the Voyager 2 Golden Record.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty unlikely anybody&rsquo;s gonna discover those</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re just adrift in space</p>
<p>and they will eventually mechanically die</p>
<p>and not produce any signal for anyone to spot.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have to be extremely lucky to come across them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often said to my colleagues</p>
<p>that I think the best place is the moon.</p>
<p>The moon, unlike the Earth, has no significant weathering.</p>
<p>How long will the Apollo descent stages,</p>
<p>which are still sun on the lunar surface, last for?</p>
<p>The only real effect is micrometeorites,</p>
<p>which are slowly like dust</p>
<p>smashing against them pretty much.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s gonna take millions,</p>
<p>potentially billions of years to erode that down.</p>
<p>And so we have an opportunity, and that&rsquo;s on the surface.</p>
<p>If you put something just a few meters beneath the surface,</p>
<p>it would have even greater protection.</p>
<p>And so it raises the prospect of that</p>
<p>if we wanted to send something,</p>
<p>a significant amount of information,</p>
<p>to a future galactic-spanning civilization</p>
<p>that maybe cracks the interstellar propulsion problem,</p>
<p>the moon&rsquo;s gonna be there for five billion years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long time for somebody to come by</p>
<p>and detect maybe a strange pattern</p>
<p>that we draw on the sand,</p>
<p>for them to, you know, big arrow, big cross,</p>
<p>like, look under here,</p>
<p>and we could have a tomb of knowledge</p>
<p>of some record of our civilization.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>when you think like that, what that implies to us,</p>
<p>well, okay, the galaxy&rsquo;s 13 billion years old,</p>
<p>the moon is already four billion years old.</p>
<p>There may be places familiar to us, nearby to us,</p>
<p>that we should be seriously considering</p>
<p>as places we should look for life,</p>
<p>and intelligent life, or evidence of relics</p>
<p>that they might leave behind for us.</p>
<p>So that thinking like that will help us find such relics,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a beneficial cycle that happens.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That enables the science of society better,</p>
<p>like of searching for bios and tech signatures and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s inspiring.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s also inspiring in that we wanna leave</p>
<p>a legacy behind as an entire civilization,</p>
<p>not just in the symbols, but broadly speaking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the last thing somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;m part of a team</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to repeat the Golden Record experiment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to create like an open source version</p>
<p>of the Golden Record that future spacecraft</p>
<p>are able to download,</p>
<p>and basically put in a little hard drive</p>
<p>that they can carry around with them,</p>
<p>and, you know, get these distributed,</p>
<p>hopefully across the solar system eventually.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be called</p>
<p>the Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good name for it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been toying a little bit with the name,</p>
<p>but I think probably it would just be Golden Record</p>
<p>at this point, or Golden Record version two or something.</p>
<p>But I think another benefit that I see of this activity</p>
<p>is that it forces us as a species to ask those questions</p>
<p>about what it is that we want another civilization</p>
<p>to know about us.</p>
<p>The Golden Record was kind of funny</p>
<p>because it had photos on it,</p>
<p>and it had photos of people eating, for instance,</p>
<p>but it had no photos of people defecating.</p>
<p>And so I always thought that was kind of funny</p>
<p>because if I was an alien, or if I was studying an alien,</p>
<p>if I saw images of an alien,</p>
<p>I would, I&rsquo;m not trying to be like a perv or anything,</p>
<p>but I would want to see the full,</p>
<p>I want to understand the biology of that alien.</p>
<p>And so we always censor what we show,</p>
<p>and we should show the whole actual natural process,</p>
<p>and then also say, we humans tend to censor these things.</p>
<p>We tend to not like to walk around naked,</p>
<p>we tend to not to talk about</p>
<p>some of the natural biological phenomena</p>
<p>and talk a lot about others,</p>
<p>and actually just be very,</p>
<p>like the way you would be to a therapist or something,</p>
<p>very transparent about the way we actually operate.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, and Sagan had that with the Golden Record.</p>
<p>I think he originally,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a male and a female figure</p>
<p>to pitch on the Golden Record.</p>
<p>And the woman had a genitalia originally drawn,</p>
<p>and there was a lot of pushback</p>
<p>from I think a lot of Christian groups</p>
<p>who were not happy about the idea of throwing this into space</p>
<p>and so eventually they had to remove that.</p>
<p>And so it would be confusing biologically</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to study xenobiology of this alien</p>
<p>that apparently has no genitalia,</p>
<p>or the man does, but for some reason the woman doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s our own societal and cultural imprint</p>
<p>happening into that information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, to be fair,</p>
<p>just even having two sexes and predators and prey,</p>
<p>just the whole,</p>
<p>that could be just a very unique Earth-like thing.</p>
<p>So they might be confused about</p>
<p>why there&rsquo;s like pairs of things.</p>
<p>Like, why are you,</p>
<p>why is there a man and a woman in general?</p>
<p>Like, they could be, I mean,</p>
<p>they could be confused about a lot of things in general.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know which way to hold the picture.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s the picture.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, they might not need,</p>
<p>they might have very different sensory devices</p>
<p>to even interpret this.</p>
<p>Correct, yeah.</p>
<p>If they only have sound</p>
<p>as their only way of navigating the world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of lost to send any kind of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of conversation about sending video</p>
<p>and audio and video and pictures.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the things I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>a little bit resistant about in the team</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been thinking,</p>
<p>well, they might not have eyes.</p>
<p>And so if you lived in,</p>
<p>under Europa&rsquo;s surface,</p>
<p>having eyes wouldn&rsquo;t be very useful.</p>
<p>If you lived in a,</p>
<p>on a very dark planet,</p>
<p>on the tidally locked night side of an exoplanet,</p>
<p>having eyes wouldn&rsquo;t be particularly useful.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a presumption of us</p>
<p>to think that video is a useful form of communication.</p>
<p>Do you hope we become a multi-planetary species?</p>
<p>So we,</p>
<p>almost sneaking up to that,</p>
<p>but you know,</p>
<p>the efforts of SpaceX, of Elon,</p>
<p>maybe in general,</p>
<p>what your thoughts are about those efforts?</p>
<p>So you already mentioned Starship</p>
<p>will be very interesting for astronomy,</p>
<p>for science in general,</p>
<p>just getting stuff out into space.</p>
<p>But what about the longer term goal</p>
<p>of actually colonizing,</p>
<p>of building civilizations on other surfaces,</p>
<p>on moons, on planets?</p>
<p>It seems like a fairly obvious thing</p>
<p>to do for our survival, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a high risk.</p>
<p>If we are committed to trying to keep</p>
<p>this human experiment going,</p>
<p>putting all of our eggs in one basket</p>
<p>is always gonna be a risky strategy to pursue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice basket though, but yeah.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful basket.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna,</p>
<p>I personally have no interest in living on Mars</p>
<p>or the moon.</p>
<p>I would like to visit,</p>
<p>but I would definitely not wanna spend</p>
<p>the rest of my life and die on Mars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a hell hole.</p>
<p>Mars is a very, very different,</p>
<p>I think the idea that this is gonna happen</p>
<p>in the next 10, 20 years</p>
<p>seems to me very optimistic.</p>
<p>Not that it&rsquo;s insurmountable,</p>
<p>but the challenges are extreme</p>
<p>to survive on a planet like Mars,</p>
<p>which is like a dry, frozen desert</p>
<p>with a high radiation environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a challenge of a type we&rsquo;ve never faced before.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m sure human ingenuity</p>
<p>can tackle it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m skeptical that we&rsquo;ll have thousands of people</p>
<p>living on Mars in my lifetime.</p>
<p>But I would relish that opportunity</p>
<p>to maybe one day visit such a settlement</p>
<p>and do scientific experiments on Mars</p>
<p>or experience Mars,</p>
<p>do astronomy from Mars,</p>
<p>all sorts of cool stuff you could do.</p>
<p>Sometimes you see these dreams</p>
<p>of outer solar system exploration</p>
<p>and you can fly through the clouds of Venus</p>
<p>or you could just do these enormous jumps</p>
<p>on like these small moons</p>
<p>where you can essentially jump as high as a skyscraper</p>
<p>and traverse the moon.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all sorts of wonderful ice skating on Europa,</p>
<p>might be fun.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t get me wrong,</p>
<p>I love the idea of us becoming interplanetary.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just a question of time.</p>
<p>Our own destructive tendencies,</p>
<p>as you said earlier,</p>
<p>are at odds with our emerging capability</p>
<p>to become interplanetary.</p>
<p>And the question is,</p>
<p>will we get out of the nest before we burn it down?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>obviously I hope that we do,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have any special insight that,</p>
<p>there is a problem,</p>
<p>there is somewhat of a</p>
<p>annoying intellectual itch I have</p>
<p>with the so-called doomsday argument,</p>
<p>which I try not to treat too seriously,</p>
<p>but there is some element of it that bothers me.</p>
<p>The doomsday argument basically suggests</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re typically,</p>
<p>the mediocrity principle,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not special,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re probably gonna be born</p>
<p>somewhere in the middle of all human beings</p>
<p>who will ever be born.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re unlikely to be one of the first 1% of human beings</p>
<p>that ever lived</p>
<p>and similarly the last 1% of human beings</p>
<p>that will ever live,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d be very unique and special if that were true.</p>
<p>And so by this logic,</p>
<p>you can sort of calculate</p>
<p>how many generations of humans you might expect.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 100 billion human beings</p>
<p>that have ever lived on this planet,</p>
<p>then you could say to 95% confidence,</p>
<p>so you divide by 5%,</p>
<p>so 100 billion divided by 0.05</p>
<p>would give you 2 trillion human beings</p>
<p>that would ever live,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d expect by this argument.</p>
<p>And so if each,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say each planet,</p>
<p>in general the planet has a 10 billion population,</p>
<p>so that would be 200 generations of humans</p>
<p>we would expect ahead of us.</p>
<p>And if each one has an average lifetime,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 100 years,</p>
<p>then that would be about 20,000 years.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s 20,000 years left in the clock.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a typical doomsday argument type,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they typically lay it out.</p>
<p>Now you can,</p>
<p>a lot of the criticisms of the doomsday argument</p>
<p>come down to what are you really counting?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re counting humans there,</p>
<p>but maybe you should be counting years</p>
<p>or maybe you should be counting human hours</p>
<p>because what you count makes a big difference</p>
<p>to what you get out on the other end.</p>
<p>So this is called the reference class.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one of the big criticisms</p>
<p>of the doomsday argument.</p>
<p>But I do think it has a compelling point</p>
<p>that it would be surprising</p>
<p>if our future is to one day blossom</p>
<p>and become a galactic spanning empire,</p>
<p>trillions upon trillions upon trillions of human beings</p>
<p>will one day live across the stars</p>
<p>for essentially as long as the galaxy exists</p>
<p>and the stars burn.</p>
<p>We would live at an incredibly special point in that story.</p>
<p>We would be right at the very, very, very beginning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not impossible,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just somewhat improbable.</p>
<p>And so part of that sort of irks against me,</p>
<p>but it also almost feels like a philosophical argument</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re sort of talking about</p>
<p>souls being drawn from this cosmic pool.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an argument that I lose sleep about</p>
<p>for our fate of the doomsday,</p>
<p>but it is somewhat intellectually annoying</p>
<p>that there is a slight contradiction</p>
<p>now it feels like with the idea</p>
<p>of a galactic spanning empire.</p>
<p>Yeah, but of course there&rsquo;s so many unknowns.</p>
<p>I for one would love to visit even space,</p>
<p>but Mars, just imagine standing on Mars</p>
<p>and looking back at Earth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>The incredible sight.</p>
<p>It would give you such a fresh perspective</p>
<p>as to your entire existence and what it meant to be human.</p>
<p>And then come back to Earth,</p>
<p>it would give you a heck of a perspective.</p>
<p>Plus the sunset on Mars is supposed to be nice.</p>
<p>I loved what William Shatner said after his flight.</p>
<p>His words really moved me when he came down.</p>
<p>And I think it really captured the idea</p>
<p>that we shouldn&rsquo;t really be sending engineers</p>
<p>or scientists into space.</p>
<p>We should be sending our poets</p>
<p>because those are the people when they come down</p>
<p>who can truly make a difference</p>
<p>when they describe their experiences in space.</p>
<p>And I found it very moving reading what he said.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you talk to astronauts,</p>
<p>when they describe what they see, it&rsquo;s like this,</p>
<p>like they discovered a whole new thing</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t possibly convert back into words.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful to see.</p>
<p>Just as a quick, before I forget, I have to ask you,</p>
<p>can you summarize your argument against the hypothesis</p>
<p>that we live in a simulation?</p>
<p>Is it similar to our discussion about the Doomsday Clock?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s actually pretty more similar</p>
<p>to my agnosticism about life in the universe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just sort of remaining agnostic</p>
<p>about all possibilities.</p>
<p>The simulation argument,</p>
<p>sometimes it gets mixed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of two distinct things that we need to consider.</p>
<p>One is the probability that we live in so-called base reality</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not living in a simulated reality itself.</p>
<p>And another probability we need to consider</p>
<p>is the probability that that technology is viable,</p>
<p>possible, and something we will ultimately choose</p>
<p>to one day do.</p>
<p>And those are two distinct things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably quite similar numbers to each other,</p>
<p>but they are distinct probabilities.</p>
<p>So in my paper I wrote about this,</p>
<p>I just tried to work through the problem.</p>
<p>I teach astrostatistics,</p>
<p>I was actually teaching it this morning.</p>
<p>And so it just seemed like a fun case study</p>
<p>of working through a Bayesian calculation for it.</p>
<p>Bayesian calculations work on conditionals.</p>
<p>And so when you hear,</p>
<p>what kind of inspired this project</p>
<p>was when I heard Musk said was like a billion to one chance</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t live in a simulation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right if you add the Bayesian conditional,</p>
<p>and the Bayesian conditional is conditioned upon the fact</p>
<p>that we eventually develop that technology</p>
<p>and choose to use it,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s chosen to be used by such species,</p>
<p>by such civilizations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the conditional.</p>
<p>And you have to add that in</p>
<p>because that conditional isn&rsquo;t guaranteed.</p>
<p>And so in a Bayesian framework,</p>
<p>you can kind of make that explicit.</p>
<p>You see mathematically explicitly</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a conditional in your equation.</p>
<p>And the opposite side of the coin is basically</p>
<p>in the trilemma that Bostrom originally put forward</p>
<p>is options one and two.</p>
<p>So option one is that you basically never develop</p>
<p>the ability to do that.</p>
<p>Option two is you never choose to execute that.</p>
<p>So we kind of group those together</p>
<p>as sort of the non-simulation scenario, let&rsquo;s call it.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve got non-simulation scenario</p>
<p>and simulation scenario.</p>
<p>And agnostically, we really have to give the,</p>
<p>how do you assess the model,</p>
<p>the a priori model probability of those two scenarios?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult and we can,</p>
<p>I think people would probably argue</p>
<p>about how you assign those priors.</p>
<p>In the paper, we just assigned 50-50.</p>
<p>We just said, this hasn&rsquo;t been demonstrated yet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence that this</p>
<p>is actually technically possible,</p>
<p>but nor is it that it&rsquo;s not technically possible.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just gonna assign 50-50 probability</p>
<p>to these two hypotheses.</p>
<p>And then in the hypothesis</p>
<p>where you have a simulated reality,</p>
<p>you have a base reality set at the top.</p>
<p>So there is, even in the simulated hypothesis,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a probability you still live in base reality.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a whole myriad of universes beneath that,</p>
<p>which are all simulated.</p>
<p>And so you have a very slim probability</p>
<p>of being in base reality if this is true.</p>
<p>And you have a 100% probability of living in base reality,</p>
<p>on the other hand, if it&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>and we never develop that ability</p>
<p>or choose never to use it.</p>
<p>And so then you apply this technique</p>
<p>called Bayesian model averaging,</p>
<p>which is where you propagate the uncertainty</p>
<p>of your two models to get a final estimate.</p>
<p>And because of that one base reality</p>
<p>that lives in the simulated scenario,</p>
<p>you end up counting this up</p>
<p>and getting that it always has to be less than 50%.</p>
<p>So the probability you live in a simulated reality</p>
<p>versus base reality has to be slightly less than 50%.</p>
<p>Now that really comes down to that statement</p>
<p>of giving it 50-50 odds to begin with.</p>
<p>And on the one hand, you might say,</p>
<p>look, David, I work in artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very confident that this is gonna happen,</p>
<p>just of extrapolating of current trends.</p>
<p>Or on the other hand, a statistician would say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving way too much weight</p>
<p>to the simulation hypothesis</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an intrinsically highly complicated model.</p>
<p>You have a whole hierarchy of realities</p>
<p>within realities within realities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Inception-style thing, right?</p>
<p>And so this requires hundreds, thousands,</p>
<p>millions of parameterizations to describe.</p>
<p>And by Occam&rsquo;s razor, we would always normally penalize</p>
<p>inherently complicated models as being disfavored.</p>
<p>So I think you could argue I&rsquo;m being too generous</p>
<p>or too kind with that.</p>
<p>But I sort of want to develop</p>
<p>the rigorous mathematical tools to explore it.</p>
<p>And ultimately, it&rsquo;s up to you to decide</p>
<p>what you think that 50-50 odds should be.</p>
<p>But you can use my formula to plug in whatever you want</p>
<p>and get the answer, and I use 50-50.</p>
<p>So, and, but in that first pile,</p>
<p>with the first two parts that the bossman talks about,</p>
<p>it seems like connected to that</p>
<p>is the question we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>which is the number of times at bat you get,</p>
<p>which is the number of intelligent civilizations</p>
<p>that are out there that can build such simulations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it seems like very closely connected</p>
<p>because if we&rsquo;re the only ones that are here</p>
<p>and can build such things, that changes things.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, the simulation hypothesis</p>
<p>has all sorts of implications like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved, as Sean Carroll points out,</p>
<p>a really interesting contradiction, apparently,</p>
<p>with the simulation hypothesis</p>
<p>that I speak about a little bit in the paper.</p>
<p>But he showed that, or pointed out,</p>
<p>that in this hierarchy of realities,</p>
<p>which then develop their own AIs within the realities,</p>
<p>and then they, or really ancestor simulations,</p>
<p>I should say, rather than AI,</p>
<p>they develop their own capability to simulate realities.</p>
<p>You get this hierarchy,</p>
<p>and so eventually there&rsquo;ll be a bottom layer,</p>
<p>which I often call the sewer of reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the worst layer where it&rsquo;s the most pixelated</p>
<p>it could possibly be, right?</p>
<p>Because each layer is necessarily</p>
<p>going to have less computational power</p>
<p>than the layer above it.</p>
<p>Because not only are you simulating that entire planet,</p>
<p>but also some of that&rsquo;s being used</p>
<p>for the computers themselves that those are simulated.</p>
<p>And so that base reality, or sorry,</p>
<p>the sewer of reality is a reality</p>
<p>where they are simply unable</p>
<p>to produce ancestor simulations</p>
<p>because the fidelity of the simulation is not sufficient.</p>
<p>And so from their point of view,</p>
<p>it might not be obvious that the universe is pixelated,</p>
<p>but they would just never be able</p>
<p>to manifest that capability.</p>
<p>What if they&rsquo;re constantly simulating,</p>
<p>because in order to appreciate the limits of the fidelity,</p>
<p>you have to have an observer.</p>
<p>What if they&rsquo;re always simulating</p>
<p>a dumber and dumber observer?</p>
<p>What if the sewer has very dumb observers that can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>like scientists that are the dumbest possible scientists.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very pixelated, but the scientists are too dumb</p>
<p>to even see the pixelations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like built into the universe</p>
<p>always has to be a limitation on the cognitive capabilities</p>
<p>of the complex systems that are within it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that sewer of reality,</p>
<p>they would still presumably be able</p>
<p>to have a very impressive computational capabilities.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d probably be able to simulate galactic formation</p>
<p>or this kind of impressive stuff,</p>
<p>but they would be just short of the ability</p>
<p>to however you define it,</p>
<p>create a truly sentient conscious experience in a computer.</p>
<p>That would just be just beyond their capabilities.</p>
<p>And so Carol pointed out that if you add up all the,</p>
<p>you count up how many realities there should be,</p>
<p>probabilistically, if this is true,</p>
<p>over here, the simulation hypothesis or scenario,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re most likely to find yourself in the sewer</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just far more of them</p>
<p>than there are of any of the higher levels.</p>
<p>And so that sort of sets up a contradiction</p>
<p>because then you live in a reality</p>
<p>which is inherently incapable</p>
<p>of ever producing ancestor simulations.</p>
<p>But the premise of the entire argument</p>
<p>is that ancestor simulations are possible.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a contradiction that&rsquo;s been introduced.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that old quote, we&rsquo;re all living in the sewer,</p>
<p>but some of us are looking up at the stars.</p>
<p>This is maybe more true than we think.</p>
<p>To me, so there&rsquo;s of course physics</p>
<p>and computational fascinating questions here,</p>
<p>but to me, there&rsquo;s a practical psychological question</p>
<p>which is how do you create a virtual reality world</p>
<p>that is as compelling,</p>
<p>and not necessarily even as realistic,</p>
<p>but almost as realistic,</p>
<p>but as compelling or more compelling than physical reality?</p>
<p>Because something tells me it&rsquo;s not very difficult.</p>
<p>In the full history of human civilization,</p>
<p>that is an interesting kind of simulation to me</p>
<p>because that feels like it&rsquo;s doable</p>
<p>in the next hundred years,</p>
<p>creating a world where we all prefer</p>
<p>to live in the digital world.</p>
<p>And not like a visit,</p>
<p>but like it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re seen as insane.</p>
<p>No, like you&rsquo;re required.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unsafe to live outside of the virtual world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting to me from an engineering perspective</p>
<p>how to build that,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m somebody that sort of loves video games</p>
<p>and it seems like you can create incredible worlds there</p>
<p>and stay there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a different question</p>
<p>than creating a ultra high resolution,</p>
<p>high fidelity simulation of physics.</p>
<p>But if that world inside a video game</p>
<p>is as consistent as the physics of our reality,</p>
<p>then you can have your own scientists in that world</p>
<p>that trying to understand that physics world.</p>
<p>It might look different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m presuming that eventually forget,</p>
<p>give it long enough,</p>
<p>they might forget about their origins</p>
<p>of being once biological</p>
<p>and assume this is their only reality.</p>
<p>Especially if you&rsquo;re now born,</p>
<p>well, certainly if you&rsquo;re born,</p>
<p>but even if you were eight years old or something</p>
<p>when you first started wearing the headset.</p>
<p>Yeah, or you have a memory wipe when you go in.</p>
<p>I mean, it also kind of maybe speaks to this issue</p>
<p>of like Neuralink and how do we keep up with AI in our world?</p>
<p>If you want to augment your intelligence,</p>
<p>perhaps one way of competing</p>
<p>and one of your impetuses for going into this digital reality</p>
<p>would be to be competitive intellectually</p>
<p>with artificial intelligences</p>
<p>that you could trivially augment your reality</p>
<p>if your brain was itself artificial.</p>
<p>But I mean, one skepticism I&rsquo;ve always had about that</p>
<p>is whether it&rsquo;s more of a philosophical question,</p>
<p>but how much is that really you if you do a mind upload?</p>
<p>Is this just a duplicate of your memories</p>
<p>that thinks it&rsquo;s you versus truly a transference</p>
<p>of your conscious stream into that reality?</p>
<p>And I think when you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like the teleportation device in Star Trek,</p>
<p>but with teleportation, quantum teleportation,</p>
<p>you can kind of rigorously show that,</p>
<p>as long as all of the quantum numbers</p>
<p>are exactly duplicated as you transfer over,</p>
<p>it truly is from the universe&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>in every way indistinguishable from what was there before.</p>
<p>It really is, in principle, you</p>
<p>and all the sense of being you</p>
<p>versus creating a duplicate clone</p>
<p>and uploading memories to that human body or a computer</p>
<p>that would surely be a discontinuation</p>
<p>of that conscious experience</p>
<p>by virtue of the fact you&rsquo;ve multiplied it.</p>
<p>And so I would be hesitant about uploading for that reason.</p>
<p>I would see it mostly as my own killing myself</p>
<p>and having some AI duplicate of me</p>
<p>that persists in this world,</p>
<p>but is not truly my experience.</p>
<p>Typical 20th century human</p>
<p>with an attachment to this particular</p>
<p>singular instantiation of brain and body.</p>
<p>How silly humans used to be.</p>
<p>Used to have rotary phones and other silly things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible human being.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an educator, you&rsquo;re a researcher.</p>
<p>You have an amazing YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Looking to young people, if you were to give them advice,</p>
<p>how can they have a career that maybe is inspired by yours,</p>
<p>inspired by wandering curiosity,</p>
<p>a career they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>What advice would you give?</p>
<p>I certainly think in terms of a career in science,</p>
<p>one thing that I maybe discovered late,</p>
<p>but has been incredibly influential on me</p>
<p>in terms of my own happiness and my own productivity</p>
<p>has been this synergy of doing two passions at once,</p>
<p>one passion in science communication</p>
<p>and another passion research</p>
<p>and not surrendering either one.</p>
<p>And I think that tends to be seen as something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an either or.</p>
<p>You have to completely dedicate yourself to one thing</p>
<p>to gain mastery in it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a conventional way of thinking about both science</p>
<p>and other disciplines.</p>
<p>And I have found that both have been elevated</p>
<p>by practicing in each.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s true in all assets of life.</p>
<p>I mean, if you want to become the best researcher</p>
<p>you possibly can, you&rsquo;re pushing your intellect</p>
<p>and in a sense your body to a high level.</p>
<p>And so to me, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to couple that</p>
<p>with training of my body, training of my mind</p>
<p>and other ways besides from just what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m in the lecture room or when I&rsquo;m in my office,</p>
<p>you know, calculating something.</p>
<p>Focusing on your own development</p>
<p>through whatever it is, meditation,</p>
<p>for me it&rsquo;s often running, working out</p>
<p>and pursuing multiple passions</p>
<p>provides this almost synergistic bliss</p>
<p>of all of them together.</p>
<p>So often I&rsquo;ve had some of the best research ideas</p>
<p>from making a YouTube video and trying to communicate an idea</p>
<p>or interacting with my audience</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve had a question that sparked a whole trail of thought</p>
<p>that led down this wonderful intellectual rabbit hole</p>
<p>or maybe to a new intellectual discovery</p>
<p>can go either way sometimes with those things.</p>
<p>And so thinking broadly, diversely</p>
<p>and always looking after yourself</p>
<p>in this highly competitive</p>
<p>and often extremely stressful world that we live in</p>
<p>is the best advice I can offer anybody</p>
<p>and just try, if you can, it&rsquo;s very cheesy</p>
<p>but if you can follow your passions, you&rsquo;ll always be happy.</p>
<p>Trying to sell out for the quick cash out,</p>
<p>for the quick book out can be tempting in the short term.</p>
<p>Looking for exomoons was never easy</p>
<p>but I made a career not out of discovering exomoons</p>
<p>but out of learning how to communicate</p>
<p>the difficult problem</p>
<p>and discovering all sorts of things along the way.</p>
<p>We shot for the sky</p>
<p>and we discovered all this stuff along the way.</p>
<p>We discovered dozens of new planets</p>
<p>using all sorts of new techniques.</p>
<p>We pushed this instrumentation to new places</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve had an extremely productive research career</p>
<p>in this world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had all sorts of ideas working on techno signatures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, thinking innovatively pushes you</p>
<p>into all sorts of exciting directions.</p>
<p>So just try to, yeah, it&rsquo;s hard to find that passion</p>
<p>but you can sometimes remember it when you were a kid,</p>
<p>what your passions were</p>
<p>and what fascinated you as a child.</p>
<p>For me, as soon as I picked up a space book</p>
<p>when I was five years old, that was it.</p>
<p>I was hooked on space</p>
<p>and I almost betrayed my passion at college.</p>
<p>I studied physics,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by physics as well.</p>
<p>But I came back to astronomy because it was my first love</p>
<p>and I was much happier doing research in astronomy</p>
<p>than I was in physics</p>
<p>because it spoke to that wonder I had as a child</p>
<p>that first was the spark of curiosity for me in science.</p>
<p>So society will try to get you to look at hot Jupiters</p>
<p>and the advice is to look for the cool worlds instead.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>Have you ever asked yourself why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a ride.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I think it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a ride, we&rsquo;re on a roller coaster</p>
<p>and we have no purpose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an accident in my perspective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no meaning to my life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no objective deity</p>
<p>who is overwatching what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>and I have some fate or destiny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all just riding on a roller coaster</p>
<p>and trying to have a good time</p>
<p>and contribute to other people&rsquo;s enjoyment of the ride.</p>
<p>Yeah, try to make it a happy accident.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I see no fundamental providence in my life</p>
<p>or in the nature of the universe.</p>
<p>And you just see this universe</p>
<p>as this beautiful cosmic accident</p>
<p>of galaxies smashing together,</p>
<p>stars forging here and there</p>
<p>and planets occasionally spawning maybe life</p>
<p>across the universe.</p>
<p>And we are just one of those instantiations</p>
<p>and we should just enjoy this very brief episode</p>
<p>that we have.</p>
<p>And I think trying to look at it much deeper than that</p>
<p>is to me, it&rsquo;s not very soul satisfying.</p>
<p>I just think enjoy what you&rsquo;ve got and appreciate it.</p>
<p>It does seem noticing that beauty</p>
<p>helps make the ride pretty fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>David, you&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t covered most of the things</p>
<p>I wanted to talk to you about.</p>
<p>This was an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you exist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re doing everything you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>This was amazing.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Lex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real honor, thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with David Kipping.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.</p>
<p>Perhaps the aliens are here,</p>
<p>but are hiding because of some Lex Galactica,</p>
<p>some ethic of non-interference with emerging civilizations.</p>
<p>We can imagine them, curious and dispassionate,</p>
<p>observing us as we would watch a bacterial culture</p>
<p>in a dish to determine whether this year,</p>
<p>again, we managed to avoid self-destruction.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
