    <p>The following is a conversation with Paola Arlotta.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a professor of stem cell and regenerative biology</p>
<p>at Harvard University and is interested in understanding</p>
<p>the molecular laws that govern the birth, differentiation,</p>
<p>and assembly of the human brain&rsquo;s cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>She explores the complexity of the brain</p>
<p>by studying and engineering elements</p>
<p>of how the brain develops.</p>
<p>This was a fascinating conversation to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the Artificial Intelligence podcast.</p>

<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to give a special thank you to Amy Jeffress</p>
<p>for her support of the podcast on Patreon.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an artist and you should definitely check out</p>
<p>her Instagram at lovetruthgood, three beautiful words.</p>
<p>Your support means a lot and inspires me</p>
<p>to keep the series going.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Paola Arlotta.</p>
<p>You studied the development of the human brain</p>
<p>for many years.</p>
<p>So let me ask you an out of the box question first.</p>
<p>How likely is it that there&rsquo;s intelligent life out there</p>
<p>in the universe outside of earth</p>
<p>with something like the human brain?</p>
<p>So I can put it another way.</p>
<p>How unlikely is the human brain?</p>
<p>How difficult is it to build a thing</p>
<p>through the evolutionary process?</p>
<p>Well, it has happened here, right?</p>
<p>On this planet.</p>
<p>Once, yes.</p>
<p>Once.</p>
<p>So that simply tells you that it could, of course,</p>
<p>happen again other places.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of probability.</p>
<p>What the probability that you would get a brain</p>
<p>like the ones that we have, like the human brain.</p>
<p>So how difficult is it to make the human brain?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty difficult, but most importantly,</p>
<p>I guess we know very little</p>
<p>about how this process really happens.</p>
<p>And there is a reason for that,</p>
<p>actually multiple reasons for that.</p>
<p>Most of what we know about how the mammalian brain,</p>
<p>so the brain of mammals develop comes from studying</p>
<p>in labs other brains, not our own brain,</p>
<p>the brain of mice, for example.</p>
<p>But if I showed you a picture of a mouse brain,</p>
<p>and then you put it next to a picture of a human brain,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t look at all like each other.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very different.</p>
<p>And therefore there is a limit to what you can learn</p>
<p>about how the human brain is made</p>
<p>by studying the mouse brain.</p>
<p>There is a huge value in studying the mouse brain.</p>
<p>There are many things that we have learned,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the same thing.</p>
<p>So in having studied the human brain,</p>
<p>or through the mouse and through other methodologies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about, do you have a sense?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re one of the experts in the world.</p>
<p>How much do you feel you know about the brain</p>
<p>and how often do you find yourself</p>
<p>in awe of this mysterious thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, you pretty much find yourself in awe all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a process by which,</p>
<p>by means that we don&rsquo;t fully understand,</p>
<p>at the very beginning of embryogenesis,</p>
<p>the structure called the neural tube,</p>
<p>literally self assembles.</p>
<p>And it happens in an embryo</p>
<p>and it can happen also from stem cells in a dish.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then from there,</p>
<p>these stem cells that are present within the neural tube</p>
<p>give rise to all of the thousands and thousands</p>
<p>of different cell types that are present in the brain</p>
<p>through time, right?</p>
<p>With the interesting, very intriguing, interesting</p>
<p>observation is that the time that it takes</p>
<p>for the human brain to be made, it&rsquo;s human time.</p>
<p>Meaning that for me and you,</p>
<p>it took almost nine months of gestation to build the brain</p>
<p>and then another 20 years of learning postnatally</p>
<p>to get the brain that we have today</p>
<p>that allows us to this conversation.</p>
<p>A mouse takes 20 days or so for an embryo to be born.</p>
<p>And so the brain is built in a much shorter period of time.</p>
<p>And the beauty of it is that if you take mouse stem cells</p>
<p>and you put them in a culture dish,</p>
<p>the brain organoid that you get from a mouse</p>
<p>is formed faster than if you took human stem cells</p>
<p>and put them in the dish</p>
<p>and let them make a human brain organoid.</p>
<p>So the very developmental process is&hellip;</p>
<p>Controlled by the speed of the species.</p>
<p>Which means it&rsquo;s on purpose, it&rsquo;s not accidental</p>
<p>or there is something in that temporal&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, exactly, that is very important</p>
<p>for us to get the brain we have.</p>
<p>And we can speculate for why that is.</p>
<p>You know, it takes us a long time as human beings</p>
<p>after we&rsquo;re born to learn all the things</p>
<p>that we have to learn to have the adult brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually 20 years, think about it.</p>
<p>From when a baby is born to when a teenager</p>
<p>goes through puberty to adults, it&rsquo;s a long time.</p>
<p>Do you think you can maybe talk through</p>
<p>the first few months and then on to the first 20 years</p>
<p>and then for the rest of their lives?</p>
<p>What is the development of the human brain look like?</p>
<p>What are the different stages?</p>
<p>Yeah, at the beginning, you have to build a brain, right?</p>
<p>And the brain is made of cells.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the very beginning?</p>
<p>Which beginning are we talking about?</p>
<p>In the embryo, as the embryo is developing in the womb,</p>
<p>in addition to making all of the other tissues</p>
<p>of the embryo, the muscle, the heart, the blood,</p>
<p>the embryo is also building the brain.</p>
<p>And it builds from a very simple structure</p>
<p>called the neural tube, which is basically nothing</p>
<p>but a tube of cells that spans sort of the length</p>
<p>of the embryo from the head all the way to the tail,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, of the embryo.</p>
<p>And then over in human beings, over many months of gestation</p>
<p>from that neural tube, which contains stem cell</p>
<p>like cells of the brain, you will make many, many</p>
<p>other building blocks of the brain.</p>
<p>So all of the other cell types, because there are many,</p>
<p>many different types of cells in the brain</p>
<p>that will form specific structures of the brain.</p>
<p>So you can think about embryonic development of the brain</p>
<p>as just the time in which you are making</p>
<p>the building blocks, the cells.</p>
<p>Are the stem cells relatively homogeneous, like uniform,</p>
<p>or are they all different types?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly how it works.</p>
<p>You start with a more homogeneous,</p>
<p>perhaps more multipotent type of stem cell.</p>
<p>With multipotent.</p>
<p>With multipotent it means that it has the potential</p>
<p>to make many, many different types of other cells.</p>
<p>And then with time, these progenitors become</p>
<p>more heterogeneous, which means more diverse.</p>
<p>There are gonna be many different types of the stem cells.</p>
<p>And also they will give rise to progeny to other cells</p>
<p>that are not stem cells, that are specific cells</p>
<p>of the brain that are very different</p>
<p>from the mother stem cell.</p>
<p>And now you think about this process of making cells</p>
<p>from the stem cells over many, many months</p>
<p>of development for humans.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;re building the cells</p>
<p>that physically make the brain,</p>
<p>and then you arrange them in specific structures</p>
<p>that are present in the final brain.</p>
<p>So you can think about the embryonic development</p>
<p>of the brain as the time where you&rsquo;re building the bricks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting the bricks together to form buildings,</p>
<p>structures, regions of the brain.</p>
<p>And where you make the connections</p>
<p>between these many different type of cells,</p>
<p>especially nerve cells, neurons, right?</p>
<p>That transmit action potentials and electricity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard you also say somewhere, I think,</p>
<p>correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>that the order of the way this builds matters.</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>If you are an engineer and you think about development,</p>
<p>you can think of it as, well, I could also take all the cells</p>
<p>and bring them all together into a brain in the end.</p>
<p>But development is much more than that.</p>
<p>So the cells are made in a very specific order</p>
<p>that subserve the final product that you need to get.</p>
<p>And so, for example, all of the nerve cells,</p>
<p>the neurons are made first,</p>
<p>and all of the supportive cells of the neurons,</p>
<p>like the glia, is made later.</p>
<p>And there is a reason for that</p>
<p>because they have to assemble together in specific ways.</p>
<p>But you also may say, well,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we just put them all together in the end?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because as they develop next to each other,</p>
<p>they influence their own development.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a different thing for a glia</p>
<p>to be made alone in a dish,</p>
<p>than a glia cell be made in a developing embryo</p>
<p>with all these other cells around it</p>
<p>that produce all these other signals.</p>
<p>First of all, that&rsquo;s mind blowing,</p>
<p>this development process.</p>
<p>From my perspective in artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>you often think of how incredible the final product is,</p>
<p>the final product, the brain.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re making me realize that the final product</p>
<p>is just, the beautiful thing</p>
<p>is the actual development process.</p>
<p>Do we know the code that drives that development?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do we have any sense?</p>
<p>First of all, thank you for saying</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really the formation of the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really its development.</p>
<p>It is this incredibly choreographed dance</p>
<p>that happens the same way every time</p>
<p>each one of us builds the brain, right?</p>
<p>And that builds an organ that allows us</p>
<p>to do what we&rsquo;re doing today, right?</p>
<p>That is mind blowing.</p>
<p>And this is why developmental neurobiologists</p>
<p>never get tired of studying that.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re asking about the code.</p>
<p>What drives this?</p>
<p>How is this done?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s millions of years of evolution</p>
<p>of really fine tuning gene expression programs</p>
<p>that allow certain cells to be made at a certain time</p>
<p>and to become a certain cell type,</p>
<p>but also mechanical forces of pressure bending.</p>
<p>This embryo is not just, it will not stay a tube,</p>
<p>this brain for very long.</p>
<p>At some point, this tube in the front of the embryo</p>
<p>will expand to make the primordium of the brain, right?</p>
<p>Now the forces that control that the cells feel,</p>
<p>and this is another beautiful thing,</p>
<p>the very force that they feel,</p>
<p>which is different from a week before, a week ago,</p>
<p>will tell the cell, oh, you&rsquo;re being squished</p>
<p>in a certain way, begin to produce these new genes</p>
<p>because now you are at the corner</p>
<p>or you are in a stretch of cells</p>
<p>or whatever it is, and that,</p>
<p>so that mechanical physical force</p>
<p>shapes the fate of the cell as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not only chemical, it&rsquo;s also mechanical.</p>
<p>So from my perspective,</p>
<p>biology is this incredibly complex mess, gooey mess.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying mechanical forces.</p>
<p>How different is like a computer</p>
<p>or any kind of mechanical machine that we humans build</p>
<p>and the biological systems?</p>
<p>Have you been,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve worked a lot with biological systems.</p>
<p>Are they as much of a mess as it seems</p>
<p>from a perspective of an engineer, a mechanical engineer?</p>
<p>Yeah, they are much more prone</p>
<p>to taking alternative routes, right?</p>
<p>So if you, we go back to printing a brain</p>
<p>versus developing a brain,</p>
<p>of course, if you print a brain,</p>
<p>given that you start with the same building blocks,</p>
<p>the same cells,</p>
<p>you could potentially print it the same way every time,</p>
<p>but that final brain may not work the same way</p>
<p>as a brain built during development does</p>
<p>because the very same building blocks that you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>developed in a completely different environment, right?</p>
<p>It was not the environment of the brain.</p>
<p>Therefore, they&rsquo;re gonna be different just by definition.</p>
<p>So if you instead use development to build,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a brain organoid,</p>
<p>which maybe we will be talking about in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Those things are fascinating.</p>
<p>Yes, so if you use processes of development,</p>
<p>then when you watch it,</p>
<p>you can see that sometimes things can go wrong</p>
<p>in some organoids and by wrong,</p>
<p>I mean different one organoid from the next.</p>
<p>While if you think about that embryo, it always goes right.</p>
<p>So this development, it&rsquo;s for as complex as it is.</p>
<p>Every time a baby is born has, with very few exceptions,</p>
<p>so the brain is like the next baby,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the same if you develop it in a dish.</p>
<p>And first of all, we don&rsquo;t even develop a brain,</p>
<p>you develop something much simpler in the dish,</p>
<p>but there are more options for building things differently,</p>
<p>which really tells you that evolution</p>
<p>has played a really tight game here</p>
<p>for how in the end the brain is built in vivo.</p>
<p>So just a quick, maybe dumb question,</p>
<p>but it seems like this is not,</p>
<p>the building process is not a dictatorship.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s not a centralized,</p>
<p>like high level mechanism that says,</p>
<p>okay, this cell built itself the wrong way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna kill it.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a really strong distributed mechanism.</p>
<p>Is that in your sense for what you mean?</p>
<p>There are a lot of possibilities, right?</p>
<p>And if you think about, for example,</p>
<p>different species building their brain,</p>
<p>each brain is a little bit different.</p>
<p>So the brain of a lizard is very different</p>
<p>from that of a chicken, from that of one of us</p>
<p>and so on and so forth and still is a brain,</p>
<p>but it was built differently starting from stem cells</p>
<p>that pretty much had the same potential,</p>
<p>but in the end, evolution builds different brains</p>
<p>in different species because that serves in a way</p>
<p>the purpose of that species</p>
<p>and the wellbeing of that organism.</p>
<p>And so there are many possibilities,</p>
<p>but then there is a way and you were talking about a code.</p>
<p>Nobody knows what the entire code of development is.</p>
<p>Of course we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We know bits and pieces of very specific aspects</p>
<p>of development of the brain,</p>
<p>what genes are involved to make a certain cell types,</p>
<p>how those two cells interact to make the next level structure</p>
<p>that we might know, but the entirety of it,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s so well controlled, it&rsquo;s really mind blowing.</p>
<p>So in the first two months in the embryo or whatever,</p>
<p>the first few weeks, months,</p>
<p>so yeah, the building blocks are constructed.</p>
<p>The actual, the different regions of the brain,</p>
<p>I guess in the nervous system.</p>
<p>Well, this continues way longer</p>
<p>than just the first few months.</p>
<p>So over the very first few months,</p>
<p>you build a lot of the cells,</p>
<p>but then there is continuous building of new cell types</p>
<p>all the way through birth.</p>
<p>And then even postnatally,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever heard of myelin.</p>
<p>Myelin is this sort of insulation</p>
<p>that is built around the cables of the neurons</p>
<p>so that the electricity can go really fast from.</p>
<p>The axons, I guess they&rsquo;re called.</p>
<p>The axons, they&rsquo;re called axons, exactly.</p>
<p>And so as human beings,</p>
<p>we myelinate our cells postnatally.</p>
<p>A kid, a six year old kid has barely started</p>
<p>the process of making the mature oligodendrocytes,</p>
<p>which are the cells that then eventually</p>
<p>will wrap the axons into myelin.</p>
<p>And this will continue, believe it or not,</p>
<p>until we are about 25, 30 years old.</p>
<p>So there is a continuous process of maturation</p>
<p>and tweaking and additions,</p>
<p>and also in response to what we do.</p>
<p>I remember taking AP Biology in high school,</p>
<p>and in the textbook, it said that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going by memory here,</p>
<p>that scientists disagree on the purpose</p>
<p>of myelin in the brain.</p>
<p>Is that totally wrong?</p>
<p>So like, I guess it speeds up the,</p>
<p>okay, I might be wrong here,</p>
<p>but I guess it speeds up the electricity</p>
<p>traveling down the axon or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s the most sort of canonical,</p>
<p>and definitely that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>So you have to imagine an axon,</p>
<p>and you can think about it as a cable of some type</p>
<p>with electricity going through.</p>
<p>And what myelin does, by insulating the outside,</p>
<p>I should say there are tracts of myelin</p>
<p>and pieces of axons that are naked without myelin.</p>
<p>And so by having the insulation,</p>
<p>the electricity, instead of going straight</p>
<p>through the cable, it will jump</p>
<p>over a piece of myelin, right,</p>
<p>to the next naked little piece and jump again.</p>
<p>And therefore, that&rsquo;s the idea that you go faster.</p>
<p>And it was always thought that in order to build</p>
<p>a big brain, a big nervous system,</p>
<p>in order to have a nervous system</p>
<p>that can do very complex type of things,</p>
<p>then you need a lot of myelin</p>
<p>because you wanna go fast with this information</p>
<p>from point A to point B.</p>
<p>Well, a few years ago, maybe five years ago or so,</p>
<p>we discovered that some of the most evolved,</p>
<p>which means the newest type of neurons that we have</p>
<p>as nonhuman primates, as human beings</p>
<p>in the top of our cerebral cortex,</p>
<p>which should be the neurons that do some</p>
<p>of the most complex things that we do,</p>
<p>well, those have axons that have very little myelin.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And they have very interesting ways</p>
<p>in which they put this myelin on their axons.</p>
<p>You know, a little piece here,</p>
<p>then a long track with no myelin, another chunk there.</p>
<p>And some don&rsquo;t have myelin at all.</p>
<p>So now, you have to explain</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re going with evolution.</p>
<p>And if you think about it,</p>
<p>perhaps as an electrical engineer,</p>
<p>when I looked at it, I initially thought,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a developmental neurobiologist,</p>
<p>I thought maybe this is what we see now,</p>
<p>but if we give evolution another few million years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see a lot of myelin on these neurons too.</p>
<p>But I actually think now that that&rsquo;s instead the future</p>
<p>of the brain.</p>
<p>Less myelin.</p>
<p>Less myelin might allow for more flexibility</p>
<p>on what you do with your axons,</p>
<p>and therefore more complicated</p>
<p>and unpredictable type of functions,</p>
<p>which is also a bit mind blowing.</p>
<p>So it seems like it&rsquo;s controlling the timing of the signal.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re in the timing, you can encode a lot of information.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so the brain.</p>
<p>The timing, the chemistry of that little piece of axon,</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s a dynamic process where the myelin can move.</p>
<p>Now you see how many layers of variability you can add,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually really good</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to come up with a new function</p>
<p>or a new capability or something unpredictable in a way.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna jump around a little bit,</p>
<p>but the old question of how much is nature</p>
<p>and how much is nurture?</p>
<p>In terms of this incredible thing</p>
<p>after the development is over,</p>
<p>we seem to be kind of somewhat smart, intelligent,</p>
<p>cognition, consciousness,</p>
<p>all of these things are just incredible,</p>
<p>ability to reason and so on emerge.</p>
<p>In your sense, how much is in the hardware,</p>
<p>in the nature and how much is in the nurture</p>
<p>is learned through with our parents</p>
<p>through interacting with the environment and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really both, right?</p>
<p>If you think about it.</p>
<p>So we are born with a brain as babies</p>
<p>that has most of its cells and most of its structures.</p>
<p>And that will take a few years to grow,</p>
<p>to add more, to be better.</p>
<p>But really then we have this 20 years</p>
<p>of interacting with the environment around us.</p>
<p>And so what that brain that was so perfectly built</p>
<p>or imperfectly built due to our genetic cues</p>
<p>will then be used to incorporate the environment</p>
<p>in its further maturation and development.</p>
<p>And so your experiences do shape your brain.</p>
<p>I mean, we know that like if you and I</p>
<p>may have had a different childhood or a different,</p>
<p>we have been going to different schools,</p>
<p>we have been learning different things</p>
<p>and our brain is a little bit different because of that.</p>
<p>We behave differently because of that.</p>
<p>And so especially postnatally</p>
<p>experience is extremely important.</p>
<p>We are born with a plastic brain.</p>
<p>What that means is a brain that is able to change</p>
<p>in response to stimuli that can be sensory.</p>
<p>So perhaps some of the most illuminating studies</p>
<p>that were done were studies in which</p>
<p>the sensory organs were not working, right?</p>
<p>Like if you are born with eyes that don&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>then your very brain, that piece of the brain</p>
<p>that normally would process vision, the visual cortex,</p>
<p>develops postnatally differently</p>
<p>and it might be used to do something different, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the most extreme.</p>
<p>The plasticity of the brain, I guess,</p>
<p>is the magic hardware that it,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s flexibility in all forms</p>
<p>is what enables the learning postnatally.</p>
<p>Can you talk about organoids?</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>And how can you use them to help us understand the brain</p>
<p>and the development of the brain?</p>
<p>This is very, very important.</p>
<p>So the first thing I&rsquo;d like to say,</p>
<p>please skip this in the video.</p>
<p>The first thing I&rsquo;d like to say is that an organoid,</p>
<p>a brain organoid is not the same as a brain.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fundamental distinction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a system, a cellular system</p>
<p>that one can develop in the culture dish,</p>
<p>starting from stem cells that will mimic some aspects</p>
<p>of the development of the brain, but not all of it.</p>
<p>They are very small, maximum,</p>
<p>they become about four to five millimeters in diameters.</p>
<p>They are much simpler than our brain, of course,</p>
<p>but yet they are the only system</p>
<p>where we can literally watch a process</p>
<p>of human brain development unfold.</p>
<p>And by watch, I mean, study it.</p>
<p>Remember when I told you that we can&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>everything about development in our own brain</p>
<p>by studying a mouse?</p>
<p>Well, we can&rsquo;t study the actual process</p>
<p>of development of the human brain</p>
<p>because it all happens in utero.</p>
<p>So we will never have access to that process ever.</p>
<p>And therefore, this is our next best thing.</p>
<p>Like a bunch of stem cells that can be coaxed</p>
<p>into starting a process of neural tube formation.</p>
<p>Remember that tube that is made by the embryo early on.</p>
<p>And from there, a lot of the cell types</p>
<p>that are present within the brain,</p>
<p>and you can simply watch it and study,</p>
<p>but you can also think about diseases</p>
<p>where development of the brain</p>
<p>does not proceed normally, right, properly.</p>
<p>Think about neurodevelopmental diseases.</p>
<p>There are many, many different types.</p>
<p>Think about autism spectrum disorders.</p>
<p>There are also many different types of autism.</p>
<p>So there you could take a stem cell,</p>
<p>which really means either a sample of blood</p>
<p>or a sample of skin from the patient,</p>
<p>make a stem cell, and then with that stem cell,</p>
<p>watch a process of formation of a brain organ</p>
<p>or a brain organoid of that person with that genetics,</p>
<p>with that genetic code in it.</p>
<p>And you can ask, what is this genetic code doing</p>
<p>to some aspects of development of the brain?</p>
<p>And for the first time, you may come to solutions</p>
<p>like what cells are involved in autism, right?</p>
<p>So many questions around this.</p>
<p>So if you take this human stem cell</p>
<p>for that particular person with that genetic code,</p>
<p>how, and you try to build an organoid,</p>
<p>how often will it look similar?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, yeah, so.</p>
<p>The reproducibility?</p>
<p>Yes, or how much variability is the flip side of that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there is much more variability</p>
<p>in building organoids than there is in building brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really true that the majority of us,</p>
<p>when we are born as babies,</p>
<p>our brains look a lot like each other.</p>
<p>This is the magic that the embryo does,</p>
<p>where it builds a brain in the context of a body</p>
<p>and there is very little variability there.</p>
<p>There is disease, of course,</p>
<p>but in general, a little variability.</p>
<p>When you build an organoid,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the full code for how this is done.</p>
<p>And so in part, the organoid somewhat builds itself</p>
<p>because there are some structures of the brain</p>
<p>that the cells know how to make.</p>
<p>And another part comes from the investigator,</p>
<p>the scientist adding to the media factors</p>
<p>that we know in the mouse, for example,</p>
<p>would foster a certain step of development,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very limited.</p>
<p>And so as a result,</p>
<p>the kind of product you get in the end</p>
<p>is much more reductionist,</p>
<p>is much more simple than what you get in vivo.</p>
<p>It mimics early events of development as of today,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t build very complex type of anatomy</p>
<p>and structure does not as of today,</p>
<p>which happens instead in vivo.</p>
<p>And also the variability that you see,</p>
<p>one organ to the next tends to be higher</p>
<p>than when you compare an embryo to the next.</p>
<p>So, okay, then the next question is,</p>
<p>how hard and maybe another flip side of that expensive</p>
<p>is it to go from one stem cell to an organoid?</p>
<p>How many can you build in like,</p>
<p>because it sounds very complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s work definitely, and it&rsquo;s money definitely,</p>
<p>but you can really grow a very high number</p>
<p>of these organoids, can go perhaps,</p>
<p>I told you the maximum,</p>
<p>they become about five millimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>So this is about the size of a tiny, tiny raisin,</p>
<p>or perhaps the seed of an apple.</p>
<p>And so you can grow 50 to 100 of those</p>
<p>inside one big bioreactors, which are these flasks</p>
<p>where the media provides nutrients for the organoids.</p>
<p>So the problem is not to grow more or less of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really to figure out how to grow them in a way</p>
<p>that they are more and more reproducible,</p>
<p>for example, organoid to organoid,</p>
<p>so they can be used to study a biological process.</p>
<p>Because if you have too much variability,</p>
<p>then you never know if what you see</p>
<p>is just an exception or really the rule.</p>
<p>So what does an organoid look like?</p>
<p>Are there different neurons already emerging?</p>
<p>Is there, well, first, can you tell me</p>
<p>what kind of neurons are there?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are they sort of all the same?</p>
<p>Are they not all the same?</p>
<p>How much do we understand?</p>
<p>And how much of that variance, if any,</p>
<p>can exist in organoids?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you could grow,</p>
<p>I told you that the brain has different parts.</p>
<p>So the cerebral cortex is on the top part of the brain,</p>
<p>but there is another region called the striatum</p>
<p>that is below the cortex and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>All of these regions have different types of cells</p>
<p>in the actual brain, okay?</p>
<p>And so scientists have been able to grow organoids</p>
<p>that may mimic some aspects of development</p>
<p>of these different regions of the brain.</p>
<p>And so we are very interested in the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the coolest part, right?</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t be here talking</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t have a cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, I like to think, the part of the brain</p>
<p>that really truly makes us human,</p>
<p>the most evolved in recent evolution.</p>
<p>And so in the attempt to make the cerebral cortex</p>
<p>and by figuring out a way to have these organoids</p>
<p>continue to grow and develop for extended periods of times,</p>
<p>much like it happens in the real embryo,</p>
<p>months and months in culture,</p>
<p>then you can see that many different types of neurons</p>
<p>of the cortex appear.</p>
<p>And at some point, also the astrocytes,</p>
<p>so the glia cells of the cerebral cortex also appear.</p>
<p>What are these astrocytes?</p>
<p>The astrocytes are not neurons, so they&rsquo;re not nerve cells,</p>
<p>but they play very important roles.</p>
<p>One important role is to support the neuron.</p>
<p>But of course, they have much more active type of roles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very important, for example, to make the synapses,</p>
<p>which are the point of contact and communication</p>
<p>between two neurons.</p>
<p>So all that chemistry fun happens in the synapses,</p>
<p>happens because of these cells?</p>
<p>Are they the medium in which?</p>
<p>It happens because of the interactions,</p>
<p>happens because you are making the cells</p>
<p>and they have certain properties,</p>
<p>including the ability to make neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>which are the chemicals that are secreted to the synapses,</p>
<p>including the ability of making these axons grow</p>
<p>with their growth cones and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And then you have other cells around it</p>
<p>that release chemicals or touch the neurons</p>
<p>or interact with them in different ways</p>
<p>to really foster this perfect process,</p>
<p>in this case of synaptogenesis.</p>
<p>And this does happen within organoids.</p>
<p>So the mechanical and the chemical stuff happens.</p>
<p>The connectivity between neurons,</p>
<p>this in a way is not surprising</p>
<p>because scientists have been culturing neurons forever.</p>
<p>And when you take a neuron, even a very young one,</p>
<p>and you culture it, eventually finds another cell</p>
<p>or another neuron to talk to, it will form a synapse.</p>
<p>Are we talking about mice neurons?</p>
<p>Are we talking about human neurons?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, both.</p>
<p>So you can culture a neuron, like a single neuron</p>
<p>and give it a little friend and it starts interacting?</p>
<p>Yes, so neurons are able to, it sounds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more simple than what it may sound to you.</p>
<p>Neurons have molecular properties and structural properties</p>
<p>that allow them to really communicate with other cells.</p>
<p>And so if you put not one neuron,</p>
<p>but if you put several neurons together,</p>
<p>chances are that they will form synapses with each other.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So an organoid is not a brain.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some, it&rsquo;s able to,</p>
<p>especially what you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>mimics some properties of the cerebral cortex, for example.</p>
<p>So what can you understand about the brain</p>
<p>by studying an organoid of a cerebral cortex?</p>
<p>I can literally study all this incredible diversity</p>
<p>of cell type, all these many, many different classes</p>
<p>of cells, how are they made?</p>
<p>How do they look like?</p>
<p>What do they need to be made properly?</p>
<p>And what goes wrong if now the genetics of that stem cell</p>
<p>that I used to make the organoid came from a patient</p>
<p>with a neurodevelopmental disease?</p>
<p>Can I actually watch for the very first time</p>
<p>what may have gone wrong years before in this kid</p>
<p>when its own brain was being made?</p>
<p>Think about that loop.</p>
<p>In a way, it&rsquo;s a little tiny rudimentary window</p>
<p>into the past, into the time when that brain</p>
<p>in a kid that had this neurodevelopmental disease</p>
<p>was being made.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s unbelievably powerful</p>
<p>because today we have no idea of what cell types,</p>
<p>we barely know what brain regions</p>
<p>are affected in these diseases.</p>
<p>Now we have an experimental system</p>
<p>that we can study in the lab.</p>
<p>And we can ask, what are the cells affected?</p>
<p>When during development things went wrong?</p>
<p>What are the molecules among the many, many</p>
<p>different molecules that control brain development?</p>
<p>Which ones are the ones that really messed up here</p>
<p>and we want perhaps to fix?</p>
<p>And what is really the final product?</p>
<p>Is it a less strong kind of circuit and brain?</p>
<p>Is it a brain that lacks a cell type?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Because then we can think about treatment</p>
<p>and care for these patients that is informed</p>
<p>rather than just based on current diagnostics.</p>
<p>So how hard is it to detect</p>
<p>through the developmental process?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a super exciting tool</p>
<p>to see how different conditions develop.</p>
<p>How hard is it to detect that, wait a minute,</p>
<p>this is abnormal development.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How much signal is there?</p>
<p>How much of it is it a mess?</p>
<p>Because things can go wrong at multiple levels, right?</p>
<p>You could have a cell that is born and built</p>
<p>but then doesn&rsquo;t work properly</p>
<p>or a cell that is not even born</p>
<p>or a cell that doesn&rsquo;t interact with other cells differently</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So today we have technology</p>
<p>that we did not have even five years ago</p>
<p>that allows us to look for example</p>
<p>at the molecular picture of a cell,</p>
<p>of a single cell in a sea of cells with high precision.</p>
<p>And so that molecular information</p>
<p>where you compare many, many single cells</p>
<p>for the genes that they produce</p>
<p>between a control individual</p>
<p>and an individual with a neurodevelopmental disease,</p>
<p>that may tell you what is different molecularly.</p>
<p>Or you could see that some cells are not even made,</p>
<p>for example, or that the process of maturation</p>
<p>of the cells may be wrong.</p>
<p>There are many different levels here</p>
<p>and we can study the cells at the molecular level</p>
<p>but also we can use the organoids to ask questions</p>
<p>about the properties of the neurons,</p>
<p>the functional properties,</p>
<p>how they communicate with each other,</p>
<p>how they respond to a stimulus and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And we may get an abnormalities there, right?</p>
<p>Detect those.</p>
<p>So how early is this work in the,</p>
<p>maybe in the history of science?</p>
<p>So, I mean like, so if you were to,</p>
<p>if you and I time travel a thousand years into the future,</p>
<p>organoids seem to be, maybe I&rsquo;m romanticizing the notion</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re building not a brain</p>
<p>but something that has properties of a brain.</p>
<p>So it feels like you might be getting close to,</p>
<p>in the building process, to build this to understand.</p>
<p>So how far are we in this understanding</p>
<p>process of development?</p>
<p>A thousand years from now, it&rsquo;s a long time from now.</p>
<p>So if this planet is still gonna be here</p>
<p>a thousand years from now.</p>
<p>So, I mean, if, you know, like they write a book,</p>
<p>obviously there&rsquo;ll be a chapter about you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that science fiction book, today.</p>
<p>Yeah, today, about, I mean, I guess where</p>
<p>we really understood very little about the brain</p>
<p>a century ago, I was a big fan in high school</p>
<p>of reading Freud and so on, still am of psychiatry.</p>
<p>I would say we still understand very little</p>
<p>about the functional aspect of just,</p>
<p>but how in the history of understanding</p>
<p>the biology of the brain, the development,</p>
<p>how far are we along?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>And so this is just, of course, my opinion.</p>
<p>I think that we did not have technology</p>
<p>even 10 years ago or certainly not 20 years ago</p>
<p>to even think about experimentally investigating</p>
<p>the development of the human brain.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done a lot of work in science</p>
<p>to study the brain or many other organisms.</p>
<p>Now we have some technologies which I&rsquo;ll spell out</p>
<p>that allow us to actually look at the real thing</p>
<p>and look at the brain, at the human brain.</p>
<p>So what are these technologies?</p>
<p>There has been huge progress in stem cell biology.</p>
<p>The moment someone figured out how to turn a skin cell</p>
<p>into an embryonic stem cell, basically,</p>
<p>and that how that embryonic stem cell</p>
<p>could begin a process of development again</p>
<p>to, for example, make a brain,</p>
<p>there was a huge advance,</p>
<p>and in fact, there was a Nobel Prize for that.</p>
<p>That started the field, really,</p>
<p>of using stem cells to build organs.</p>
<p>Now we can build on all the knowledge of development</p>
<p>that we build over the many, many, many years</p>
<p>to say, how do we make the stem cells</p>
<p>now make more and more complex aspects</p>
<p>of development of the human brain?</p>
<p>So this field is young, the field of brain organoids,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s moving faster.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s moving fast in a very serious way</p>
<p>that is rooted in labs with the right ethical framework</p>
<p>and really building on solid science</p>
<p>for what reality is and what is not.</p>
<p>But it will go faster and it will be more and more powerful.</p>
<p>We also have technology that allows us</p>
<p>to basically study the properties of single cells</p>
<p>across many, many millions of single cells,</p>
<p>which we didn&rsquo;t have perhaps five years ago.</p>
<p>So now with that, even an organoid</p>
<p>that has millions of cells can be profiled in a way,</p>
<p>looked at with very, very high resolution,</p>
<p>the single cell level to really understand</p>
<p>what is going on.</p>
<p>And you could do it in multiple stages of development</p>
<p>and you can build your hypothesis and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not gonna be a thousand years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a shorter amount of time.</p>
<p>And I see this as sort of an exponential growth</p>
<p>of this field enabled by these technologies</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re gonna see something transformative</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t see at all in the prior thousand years.</p>
<p>So I apologize for the crazy sci fi questions,</p>
<p>but the developmental process is fascinating</p>
<p>to watch and study, but how far are we away from</p>
<p>and maybe how difficult is it to build</p>
<p>not just an organoid, but a human brain from a stem cell?</p>
<p>Yeah, first of all, that&rsquo;s not the goal</p>
<p>for the majority of the serious scientists</p>
<p>that work on this because you don&rsquo;t have to build</p>
<p>the whole human brain to make this model useful</p>
<p>for understanding how the brain develops</p>
<p>or understanding disease.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to build the whole thing.</p>
<p>So let me just comment on this, fascinating.</p>
<p>It shows to me the difference between you and I</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re actually trying to understand</p>
<p>the beauty of the human brain and to use it</p>
<p>to really help thousands or millions of people</p>
<p>with disease and so on, right?</p>
<p>From an artificial intelligence perspective,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to build systems that we can put in robots</p>
<p>and try to create systems that have echoes</p>
<p>of the intelligence about reasoning about the world,</p>
<p>navigating the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different objectives, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s very much science fiction.</p>
<p>Science fiction, but we operate in science fiction a little bit.</p>
<p>So on that point of building a brain,</p>
<p>even though that is not the focus or interest, perhaps,</p>
<p>of the community, how difficult is it?</p>
<p>Is it truly science fiction at this point?</p>
<p>I think the field will progress, like I said,</p>
<p>and that the system will be more and more complex</p>
<p>in a way, right?</p>
<p>But there are properties that emerge from the human brain</p>
<p>that have to do with the mind,</p>
<p>that may have to do with consciousness,</p>
<p>that may have to do with intelligence or whatever</p>
<p>that we really don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>even how they can emerge from an actual, real brain.</p>
<p>And therefore, we can now measure or study in an organoid.</p>
<p>So I think that this field, many, many years from now,</p>
<p>may lead to the building of better neural circuits</p>
<p>that really are built out of understanding</p>
<p>of how this process really works.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to predict how complex this really will be.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re so far from,</p>
<p>it makes me laugh, really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that far from building the human brain.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re gonna be building something</p>
<p>that is always a bad version of it,</p>
<p>but that may have really powerful properties</p>
<p>and might be able to respond to stimuli</p>
<p>or be used in certain context.</p>
<p>And this is why I really think</p>
<p>that there is no other way to do this science,</p>
<p>but within the right ethical framework,</p>
<p>because where you&rsquo;re going with this is also,</p>
<p>we can talk about science fiction and write that book,</p>
<p>and we could today,</p>
<p>but this work happens in a specific ethical framework</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t decide just as scientists,</p>
<p>but also as a society.</p>
<p>So the ethical framework here is a fascinating one,</p>
<p>is a complicated one.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense, a grasp</p>
<p>of how we think about ethically of building organoids</p>
<p>from human stem cells to understand the brain?</p>
<p>It seems like a tool</p>
<p>for helping potentially millions of people cure diseases</p>
<p>or at least start the cure by understanding it.</p>
<p>But is there more, is there gray areas</p>
<p>that we have to think about ethically?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We must think about that.</p>
<p>Every discussion about the ethics of this</p>
<p>needs to be based on actual data</p>
<p>from the models that we have today</p>
<p>and from the ones that we will have tomorrow.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a continuous conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that you decide now.</p>
<p>Today, there is no issue really.</p>
<p>Very simple models that clearly can help you in many ways</p>
<p>without much think about,</p>
<p>but tomorrow we need to have another conversation</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And so the way we do this</p>
<p>is to actually really bring together constantly</p>
<p>a group of people that are not only scientists,</p>
<p>but also bioethicists, the lawyers, philosophers,</p>
<p>psychiatrists and so on,</p>
<p>psychologists and so on and so forth</p>
<p>to decide as a society really what we should</p>
<p>and what we should not do.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way to think about the ethics.</p>
<p>Now, I also think though, that as a scientist,</p>
<p>I have a moral responsibility.</p>
<p>So if you think about how transformative it could be</p>
<p>for understanding and curing a neuropsychiatric disease,</p>
<p>to be able to actually watch and study</p>
<p>and treat with drugs the very brain</p>
<p>of the patient that you are trying to study.</p>
<p>How transformative at this moment in time this could be.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t do it five years ago,</p>
<p>we could do it now, right?</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Taking a stem cell of a particular patient.</p>
<p>Patient and make an organoid for a simple</p>
<p>and different from the human brain,</p>
<p>it still is his process of brain development</p>
<p>with his or her genetics.</p>
<p>And we could understand perhaps what is going wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could use as a platform,</p>
<p>as a cellular platform to screen for drugs,</p>
<p>to fix a process and so on and so forth, right?</p>
<p>So we could do it now, we couldn&rsquo;t do it five years ago.</p>
<p>Should we not do it?</p>
<p>What is the downside of doing it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a downside at this very moment.</p>
<p>If we invited a lot of people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there would be somebody who would argue against it.</p>
<p>What would be the devil&rsquo;s advocate argument?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s exactly perhaps what you alluded at</p>
<p>with your question,</p>
<p>that you are enabling some process of formation of the brain</p>
<p>that could be misused at some point,</p>
<p>or that could be showing properties</p>
<p>that ethically we don&rsquo;t wanna see in a tissue.</p>
<p>So today, I repeat, today, this is not an issue.</p>
<p>And so you just gain dramatically from the science without,</p>
<p>because the system is so simple and so different</p>
<p>in a way from the actual brain.</p>
<p>But because it is the brain,</p>
<p>we have an obligation to really consider all of this, right?</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s a balanced conversation</p>
<p>where we should put disease and betterment of humanity</p>
<p>also on that plate.</p>
<p>What do you think, at least historically,</p>
<p>there was some politicization,</p>
<p>politicization of embryonic stem cells,</p>
<p>a stem cell research.</p>
<p>Do you still see that out there?</p>
<p>Is that still a force that we have to think about,</p>
<p>especially in this larger discourse</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re having about the role of science</p>
<p>in at least American society?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a very good question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very important.</p>
<p>I see a very central role for scientists</p>
<p>to inform decisions about what we should</p>
<p>or should not do in society.</p>
<p>And this is because the scientists</p>
<p>have the firsthand look and understanding</p>
<p>of really the work that they are doing.</p>
<p>And again, this varies depending on</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re talking about here.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re talking about brain organoids.</p>
<p>I think that the scientists need to be part</p>
<p>of that conversation about what is,</p>
<p>will be allowed in the future</p>
<p>or not allowed in the future to do with the system.</p>
<p>And I think that is very, very important</p>
<p>because they bring the reality of data to the conversation.</p>
<p>And so they should have a voice.</p>
<p>So data should have a voice.</p>
<p>Data needs to have a voice.</p>
<p>Because in not only data,</p>
<p>we should also be good at communicating</p>
<p>with non scientists, the data.</p>
<p>So there has been often time,</p>
<p>there is a lot of discussion and, you know,</p>
<p>excitement and fights about certain topics</p>
<p>just because of the way they are described.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>If I called the same cellular system</p>
<p>we just talked about a brain organoid,</p>
<p>or if I called it a human mini brain,</p>
<p>your reaction is gonna be very different to this.</p>
<p>And so the way the systems are described,</p>
<p>I mean, we and journalists alike need to be a bit careful</p>
<p>that this debate is a real debate and informed by real data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>And yeah, the language matters here.</p>
<p>So I work on autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>and there the use of language</p>
<p>could drastically change the interpretation</p>
<p>and the way people feel about</p>
<p>what is the right way to proceed forward.</p>
<p>You are, as I&rsquo;ve seen from a presentation, you&rsquo;re a parent.</p>
<p>I saw you show a couple of pictures of your son.</p>
<p>Is it just the one?</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>Son and a daughter.</p>
<p>So what have you learned from the human brain</p>
<p>by raising two of them?</p>
<p>More than I could ever learn in the lab.</p>
<p>What have I learned?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that children really have</p>
<p>these amazing plastic minds, right?</p>
<p>That we have a responsibility to, you know,</p>
<p>foster their growth in good, healthy ways.</p>
<p>That keep them curious, that keeps them adventurous,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t raise them in fear of things.</p>
<p>But also respecting who they are,</p>
<p>which is in part, you know,</p>
<p>coming from the genetics we talked about.</p>
<p>My children are very different from each other</p>
<p>despite the fact that they&rsquo;re the product of</p>
<p>the same two parents.</p>
<p>I also learned that what you do for them comes back to you.</p>
<p>Like, you know, if you&rsquo;re a good parent,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna, most of the time,</p>
<p>have, you know, perhaps a decent kids at the end.</p>
<p>So what do you think, just a quick comment,</p>
<p>what do you think is the source of that difference?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s often the surprising thing for parents.</p>
<p>Is that they can&rsquo;t believe that our kids,</p>
<p>oh, they&rsquo;re so different,</p>
<p>yet they came from the same parents.</p>
<p>Well, they are genetically different.</p>
<p>Even they came from the same two parents</p>
<p>because the mixing of gametes,</p>
<p>you know, we know this genetics,</p>
<p>creates every time a genetically different individual,</p>
<p>which will have a specific mix of genes</p>
<p>that is a different mix every time from the two parents.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re not twins.</p>
<p>They are genetically different.</p>
<p>Even just that little bit of variation,</p>
<p>because you said really from a biological perspective,</p>
<p>the brains look pretty similar.</p>
<p>Well, so let me clarify that.</p>
<p>So the genetics you have, the genes that you have,</p>
<p>that play that beautiful orchestrated symphony</p>
<p>of development, different genes</p>
<p>will play it slightly differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like playing the same piece of music,</p>
<p>but with a different orchestra and a different director.</p>
<p>The music will not come out.</p>
<p>It will be still a piece by the same author,</p>
<p>but it will come out differently</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s played by the high school orchestra</p>
<p>instead of the Scala in Milan.</p>
<p>And so you are born superficially with the same brain.</p>
<p>It has the same cell types,</p>
<p>similar patterns of connectivity,</p>
<p>but the properties of the cells</p>
<p>and how the cells will then react to the environment</p>
<p>as you experience your world will be also shaped</p>
<p>by who genetically you are.</p>
<p>Speaking just as a parent,</p>
<p>this is not something that comes from my work.</p>
<p>I think you can tell at birth that these kids are different,</p>
<p>that they have a different personality in a way, right?</p>
<p>So both is needed, the genetics,</p>
<p>as well as the nurturing afterwards.</p>
<p>So you are one human with a brain,</p>
<p>sort of living through the whole mess of it,</p>
<p>the human condition, full of love, maybe fear,</p>
<p>ultimately mortal.</p>
<p>How has studying the brain changed the way you see yourself?</p>
<p>When you look in the mirror, when you think about your life,</p>
<p>the fears, the love, when you see your own life,</p>
<p>your own mortality.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible to dissociate some time for me.</p>
<p>Some of the things we do or some of the things</p>
<p>that other people do from,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s because that part of the brain</p>
<p>is working in a certain way.</p>
<p>Or thinking about a teenager,</p>
<p>going through teenage years and being at time funny</p>
<p>in the way they think.</p>
<p>And impossible for me not to think it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going through this period of time</p>
<p>called critical periods of plasticity</p>
<p>where their synapses are being eliminated here and there,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just confused.</p>
<p>And so from that comes perhaps a different take</p>
<p>on that behavior, or maybe I can justify it scientifically</p>
<p>in some sort of way.</p>
<p>I also look at humanity in general,</p>
<p>and I am amazed by what we can do</p>
<p>and the kind of ideas that we can come up with.</p>
<p>And I cannot stop thinking about how the brain</p>
<p>is continuing to evolve.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you do this,</p>
<p>but I think about the next brain sometimes.</p>
<p>Where are we going with this?</p>
<p>Like, what are the features of this brain</p>
<p>that evolution is really playing with</p>
<p>to get us in the future, the new brain?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not over, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a work in progress.</p>
<p>So let me just a quick comment on that.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a lot of fascination</p>
<p>and hope for artificial intelligence</p>
<p>of creating artificial brains?</p>
<p>You said the next brain.</p>
<p>When you imagine over a period of a thousand years,</p>
<p>the evolution of the human brain,</p>
<p>do you sometimes envisioning that future</p>
<p>see an artificial one, artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>as it is hoped by many, not hoped,</p>
<p>thought by many people would be actually</p>
<p>the next evolutionary step in the development of humans?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think in a way that will happen, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a part of the way we evolve.</p>
<p>We evolve in the world that we created,</p>
<p>that we interact with, that shape us as we grow up</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Sometime I think about something that may sound silly,</p>
<p>but think about the use of cell phones.</p>
<p>Part of me thinks that somehow in their brain,</p>
<p>there will be a region of the cortex</p>
<p>that is attuned to that tool.</p>
<p>And this comes from a lot of studies</p>
<p>in modern organisms where really the cortex,</p>
<p>especially adapts to the kind of things you have to do.</p>
<p>So if we need to move our fingers in a very specific way,</p>
<p>we have a part of our cortex that allows us</p>
<p>to do this kind of very precise movement.</p>
<p>An owl that has to see very, very far away</p>
<p>with big eyes, the visual cortex, very big.</p>
<p>The brain attunes to your environment.</p>
<p>So the brain will attune to the technologies</p>
<p>that we will have and will be shaped by it.</p>
<p>So the cortex very well may be.</p>
<p>Will be shaped by it.</p>
<p>In artificial intelligence, it may merge with it,</p>
<p>it may get, envelop it and adjust.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s not a merge of the kind of,</p>
<p>oh, let&rsquo;s have a synthetic element together</p>
<p>with a biological one.</p>
<p>The very space around us, the fact, for example,</p>
<p>think about we put on some goggles of virtual reality</p>
<p>and we physically are surfing the ocean, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>And you have all these emotions that come to you.</p>
<p>Your brain placed you in that reality.</p>
<p>And it was able to do it like that</p>
<p>just by putting the goggles on.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take thousands of years of adapting to this.</p>
<p>The brain is plastic.</p>
<p>So adapts to new technology.</p>
<p>So you could do it from the outside</p>
<p>by simply hijacking some sensory capacities that we have.</p>
<p>So clearly over recent evolution,</p>
<p>the cerebral cortex has been a part of the brain</p>
<p>that has known the most evolution.</p>
<p>So we have put a lot of chips</p>
<p>on evolving this specific part of the brain.</p>
<p>And the evolution of cortex is plasticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this ability to change in response to things.</p>
<p>So yes, they will integrate.</p>
<p>That we want it or not.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no better way to end it, Paola.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very welcome.</p>
<p>This is very exciting.</p>
