    <p>The following is a conversation with Kyle Vogt.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the president and the CTO of Cruise Automation,</p>
<p>leading an effort to solve one of the biggest robotics challenges of our time,</p>
<p>vehicle automation. He&rsquo;s a cofounder of two successful companies, Twitch</p>
<p>and Cruise, that have each sold for a billion dollars.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a great example of the innovative spirit that flourishes</p>
<p>in Silicon Valley, and now is facing an interesting and exciting challenge of</p>
<p>matching that spirit with the mass production and the safety centric</p>
<p>culture of a major automaker like General Motors. This conversation is</p>
<p>part of the MIT Artificial General Intelligence series</p>
<p>and the Artificial Intelligence podcast. If you enjoy it,</p>
<p>please subscribe on YouTube, iTunes, or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D. And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Kyle Vogt.</p>
<p>You grew up in Kansas, right? Yeah, and I just saw that picture you had hidden</p>
<p>over there, so I&rsquo;m a little bit a little bit worried about that now.</p>
<p>Yeah, so in high school in Kansas City, you joined Shawnee Mission</p>
<p>North high school robotics team. Yeah. Now that wasn&rsquo;t your high school.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that was that was the only high school in the area that had a</p>
<p>like a teacher who was willing to sponsor our first robotics team.</p>
<p>I was gonna troll you a little bit. Jog your memory a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was trying to look super cool and intense, because you know this</p>
<p>was BattleBots. This is serious business. So we&rsquo;re standing there with a welded</p>
<p>steel frame and looking tough. So go back there. What is that drew you</p>
<p>to robotics? Well, I think I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure</p>
<p>this out for a while, but I&rsquo;ve always liked building things with Legos. And</p>
<p>when I was really, really young, I wanted the Legos that had motors and</p>
<p>other things. And then, you know, Lego Mindstorms came out, and for the</p>
<p>first time you could program Lego contraptions. And I think things</p>
<p>just sort of snowballed from that. But I remember</p>
<p>seeing, you know, the BattleBots TV show on Comedy Central and thinking that is</p>
<p>the coolest thing in the world. I want to be a part of that.</p>
<p>And not knowing a whole lot about how to build these</p>
<p>200 pound fighting robots. So I sort of obsessively poured over</p>
<p>the internet forums where all the creators for BattleBots would sort of</p>
<p>hang out and talk about, you know, document their build progress and</p>
<p>everything. And I think I read, I must have read like,</p>
<p>you know, tens of thousands of forum posts from basically</p>
<p>everything that was out there on what these people were doing. And eventually</p>
<p>like sort of triangulated how to put some of these things together.</p>
<p>And I ended up doing BattleBots, which was, you know, I was like 13 or 14, which</p>
<p>was pretty awesome. I&rsquo;m not sure if the show is still</p>
<p>running, but so BattleBots is, there&rsquo;s not an artificial</p>
<p>intelligence component. It&rsquo;s remotely controlled. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost like a mechanical engineering challenge of building things</p>
<p>that can be broken. They&rsquo;re radio controlled. So,</p>
<p>and I think that they allowed some limited form of autonomy.</p>
<p>But, you know, in a two minute match, you&rsquo;re, in the way these things ran,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really doing yourself a disservice by trying to automate it</p>
<p>versus just, you know, do the practical thing, which is drive it yourself.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an entertainment aspect, just going on YouTube, there&rsquo;s like an,</p>
<p>some of them wield an axe, some of them, I mean, there&rsquo;s that fun.</p>
<p>So what drew you to that aspect? Was it the mechanical engineering?</p>
<p>Was it the dream to create like Frankenstein and</p>
<p>sentient being? Or was it just like the Lego,</p>
<p>you like tinkering with stuff? I mean, that was just building something.</p>
<p>I think the idea of, you know, this radio controlled machine that</p>
<p>can do various things, if it has like a weapon or something was pretty</p>
<p>interesting. I agree it doesn&rsquo;t have the same</p>
<p>appeal as, you know, autonomous robots, which I,</p>
<p>which I, you know, sort of gravitated towards later on. But it was definitely</p>
<p>an engineering challenge because everything you did in that</p>
<p>competition was pushing components to their limits. So we would</p>
<p>buy like these $40 DC motors that came out of a</p>
<p>winch, like on the front of a pickup truck or something, and we&rsquo;d</p>
<p>power the car with those and we&rsquo;d run them at like double or triple their</p>
<p>rated voltage. So they immediately start overheating,</p>
<p>but for that two minute match you can get,</p>
<p>you know, a significant increase in the power output of those motors</p>
<p>before they burn out. And so you&rsquo;re doing the same thing for your battery packs,</p>
<p>all the materials in the system. And I think there&rsquo;s something, something</p>
<p>intrinsically interesting about just seeing like where things break.</p>
<p>And did you offline see where they break? Did you</p>
<p>take it to the testing point? Like how did you know two minutes? Or was there a</p>
<p>reckless let&rsquo;s just go with it and see? We weren&rsquo;t very good at</p>
<p>BattleBots. We lost all of our matches the first round.</p>
<p>The one I built first, both of them were these wedge shaped robots because</p>
<p>wedge, even though it&rsquo;s sort of boring to look</p>
<p>at, is extremely effective. You drive towards another robot and</p>
<p>the front edge of it gets under them and then they sort of flip over,</p>
<p>kind of like a door stopper. And the first one had a</p>
<p>pneumatic polished stainless steel spike on the front that would shoot out about</p>
<p>eight inches. The purpose of which is what? Pretty,</p>
<p>pretty ineffective actually, but it looks cool.</p>
<p>And was it to help with the lift? No, it was, it was just to try to poke holes</p>
<p>in the other robot. And then the second time I did it, which is the following,</p>
<p>I think maybe 18 months later, we had a, well a titanium axe with a, with a</p>
<p>hardened steel tip on it that was powered by a hydraulic</p>
<p>cylinder which we were activating with liquid CO2, which was,</p>
<p>had its own set of problems. So great, so that&rsquo;s kind of on the hardware side.</p>
<p>I mean at a certain point there must have been born a fascination</p>
<p>on the software side. So what was the first piece of code you&rsquo;ve written?</p>
<p>Go back there, see what language was it?</p>
<p>What, what was that? Was it Emacs? Vim? Was it a more</p>
<p>respectable modern IDE? Do you, do you remember any of this?</p>
<p>Yeah, well I remember, I think maybe when I was in</p>
<p>third or fourth grade, the school I was at, elementary school, had a bunch of</p>
<p>Apple II computers and we&rsquo;d play games on those. And I</p>
<p>remember every once in a while something would,</p>
<p>would, would crash or wouldn&rsquo;t start up correctly and it would dump you out to</p>
<p>what I later learned was like sort of a command prompt.</p>
<p>And my teacher would come over and type, I actually remember this to this day for</p>
<p>some reason, like PR number six or PR pound six, which is</p>
<p>peripheral six, which is the disk drive, which would fire up the disk and load the</p>
<p>program. And I just remember thinking wow, she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a hacker, like teach me these, these codes, these error codes, that is what</p>
<p>I called them at the time. But she had no interest in that, so it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t until I think about fifth grade that I had a school where you could</p>
<p>actually go on these Apple IIs and learn to program. And so it was all in basic,</p>
<p>you know, where every line, you know, the line numbers are all number, that every</p>
<p>line is numbered and you have to like leave enough space</p>
<p>between the numbers so that if you want to tweak your code you go back and</p>
<p>the first line was 10 and the second line is 20. Now you have to go back and</p>
<p>insert 15 and if you need to add code in front of</p>
<p>that, you know, 11 or 12 and you hope you don&rsquo;t run out of line numbers and have</p>
<p>to redo the whole thing. And there&rsquo;s go to statements? Yeah, go to</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very basic, maybe hence the name, but a lot of fun.</p>
<p>And that was like, that was, you know, that&rsquo;s when, you know,</p>
<p>when you first program you see the magic of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it just, just like this world opens up with, you know, endless</p>
<p>possibilities for the things you could build or</p>
<p>or accomplish with that computer. So you got the bug then, so</p>
<p>even starting with basic and then what C++ throughout,</p>
<p>what did you, was there computer programming, computer science classes in</p>
<p>high school? Not, not where I went, so it was self</p>
<p>taught, but I did a lot of programming. The thing that, you know, sort of</p>
<p>pushed me in the path of eventually working on self driving cars is actually</p>
<p>one of these really long trips driving from my</p>
<p>house in Kansas to, to I think Las Vegas where we did the BattleBots competition</p>
<p>and I had just gotten my, I think my learner&rsquo;s permit or</p>
<p>early driver&rsquo;s permit and so I was driving this,</p>
<p>you know, 10 hour stretch across western Kansas where it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going straight on a highway and it is mind numbingly boring. And I</p>
<p>remember thinking even then with my sort of mediocre programming</p>
<p>background that this is something that a computer can do, right? Let&rsquo;s take a</p>
<p>picture of the road, let&rsquo;s find the yellow lane markers and,</p>
<p>you know, steer the wheel. And, you know, later I&rsquo;d come to realize this had been</p>
<p>done, you know, since, since the 80s or the 70s or even</p>
<p>earlier, but I still wanted to do it and sort of</p>
<p>immediately after that trip switched from sort of BattleBots, which is more</p>
<p>radio controlled machines, to thinking about building,</p>
<p>you know, autonomous vehicles of some scale. Start off with really small</p>
<p>electric ones and then, you know, progress to what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing now. So what was your view of artificial intelligence at that point?</p>
<p>What did you think? So this is before, there&rsquo;s been waves in artificial</p>
<p>intelligence, right? The current wave with deep learning</p>
<p>makes people believe that you can solve in a really rich deep way the computer</p>
<p>vision perception problem, but like in</p>
<p>before the deep learning craze, you know, how do you think about,</p>
<p>how would you even go about building a thing that perceives itself in the</p>
<p>world, localizes itself in the world, moves around the world?</p>
<p>Like when you were younger, I mean, what was your thinking about it? Well,</p>
<p>prior to deep neural networks or convolutional neural</p>
<p>analysis, these modern techniques we have, or at least</p>
<p>ones that are in use today, it was all a heuristic space and so like old school</p>
<p>image processing and I think extracting, you know, yellow lane markers out of an</p>
<p>image of a road is one of the problems that lends itself</p>
<p>reasonably well to those heuristic based methods, you know, like</p>
<p>just do a threshold on the color yellow and then try to</p>
<p>fit some lines to that using a Huff transform or something and then</p>
<p>go from there. Traffic light detection and stop sign detection, red, yellow, green.</p>
<p>And I think you could, I mean, if you wanted to do a full,</p>
<p>I was just trying to make something that would stay in between the lanes on a</p>
<p>highway, but if you wanted to do the full,</p>
<p>the full, you know, set of capabilities needed for a driverless car,</p>
<p>I think you could, and we&rsquo;d done this at cruise, you know, in the very first days,</p>
<p>you can start off with a really simple, you know, human written heuristic just to</p>
<p>get the scaffolding in place for your system. Traffic light detection,</p>
<p>probably a really simple, you know, color thresholding on day one just to</p>
<p>get the system up and running before you migrate to, you know, a deep</p>
<p>learning based technique or something else.</p>
<p>And, you know, back in when I was doing this, my first one, it was on a Pentium</p>
<p>203, 233 megahertz computer in it and I think I wrote the first version in</p>
<p>basic, which is like an interpreted language. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extremely slow because that&rsquo;s the thing I knew at the time.</p>
<p>And so there was no, no chance at all of using,</p>
<p>there was no, no computational power to do any sort of reasonable</p>
<p>deep nets like you have today. So I don&rsquo;t know what kids these days are doing. Are</p>
<p>kids these days, you know, at age 13 using neural networks in</p>
<p>their garage? I mean, that would be awesome.</p>
<p>I get emails all the time from, you know, like 11, 12 year olds</p>
<p>saying I&rsquo;m having, you know, I&rsquo;m trying to follow this TensorFlow tutorial</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m having this problem. And the general approach</p>
<p>in the deep learning community is of extreme optimism of, as opposed to,</p>
<p>you mentioned like heuristics, you can, you can, you can</p>
<p>separate the autonomous driving problem into modules and try to solve it sort of</p>
<p>rigorously, or you can just do it end to end.</p>
<p>And most people just kind of love the idea that, you know, us humans do it end</p>
<p>to end. We just perceive and act. We should be able to use that, do the</p>
<p>same kind of thing when you&rsquo;re on nets. And that,</p>
<p>that kind of thinking, you don&rsquo;t want to criticize that kind of thinking because</p>
<p>eventually they will be right. Yeah. And so it&rsquo;s exciting and especially</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re younger to explore that as a really exciting approach. But yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s changed the, the language,</p>
<p>the kind of stuff you&rsquo;re tinkering with. It&rsquo;s kind of exciting to see when these</p>
<p>teenagers grow up. Yeah. I can only imagine if you,</p>
<p>if your starting point is, you know, Python and TensorFlow at age 13</p>
<p>where you end up, you know, after 10 or 15 years of that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s pretty cool. Because of GitHub, because the state tools for</p>
<p>solving most of the major problems in artificial intelligence</p>
<p>are within a few lines of code for most kids.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s incredible to think about also on the entrepreneurial side.</p>
<p>And, and on that point, was there any thought about entrepreneurship before</p>
<p>you came to college? Is sort of doing, you&rsquo;re building this</p>
<p>into a thing that impacts the world on a large scale? Yeah. I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>wanted to start a company. I think that&rsquo;s, you know, just a cool concept of</p>
<p>creating something and exchanging it for value or creating value, I guess.</p>
<p>So in high school, I was, I was trying to build like, you know, servo motor</p>
<p>drivers, little circuit boards and sell them online</p>
<p>or other, other things like that. And certainly knew at some point I wanted to</p>
<p>do a startup, but it wasn&rsquo;t really, I&rsquo;d say until college, until I felt</p>
<p>like I had the,</p>
<p>I guess the right combination of the environment, the smart people around you</p>
<p>and some free time and a lot of free time at MIT.</p>
<p>So you came to MIT as an undergrad 2004. That&rsquo;s right. And that&rsquo;s when the first</p>
<p>DARPA Grand Challenge was happening. Yeah. The, the timing of that is</p>
<p>beautifully poetic. So how did you get yourself involved in that one?</p>
<p>Originally there wasn&rsquo;t a official entry. Yeah, faculty sponsored thing. And so a</p>
<p>bunch of undergrads, myself included, started meeting and got together and</p>
<p>tried to haggle together some sponsorships. We got a vehicle donated,</p>
<p>a bunch of sensors and tried to put something together. And so we had,</p>
<p>our team was probably mostly freshmen and sophomores, you know, which, which was</p>
<p>not really a fair, fair fight against maybe the,</p>
<p>you know, postdoc and faculty led teams from other schools. But</p>
<p>we, we got something up and running. We had our vehicle drive by wire and</p>
<p>you know, very, very basic control and things. But</p>
<p>on the day of the qualifying, sort of pre qualifying round, the one and</p>
<p>only steering motor that we had purchased,</p>
<p>the thing that we had retrofitted to turn the steering wheel on the truck</p>
<p>died. And so our vehicle was just dead in the water, couldn&rsquo;t steer.</p>
<p>So we didn&rsquo;t make it very far. On the hardware side. So was there a software</p>
<p>component? Was there, like, how did your view of autonomous</p>
<p>vehicles in terms of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>evolve in this moment? I mean, you know, like you said from the 80s has been</p>
<p>autonomous vehicles, but really that was the birth of the modern wave.</p>
<p>The, the thing that captivated everyone&rsquo;s imagination that we can actually do this.</p>
<p>So what, how were you captivated in that way?</p>
<p>So how did your view of autonomous vehicles change at that point?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say at that point in time it was, it was a</p>
<p>curiosity as in, like, is this really possible?</p>
<p>And I think that was generally the spirit and</p>
<p>the purpose of that original DARPA Grand Challenge, which was to just get</p>
<p>a whole bunch of really brilliant people exploring the space and pushing the</p>
<p>limits. And I think, like, to this day that</p>
<p>DARPA Challenge with its, you know, million dollar prize pool</p>
<p>was probably one of the most effective, you know, uses of taxpayer</p>
<p>money dollar for dollar that I&rsquo;ve seen, you know, because that,</p>
<p>that small sort of initiative that DARPA put,</p>
<p>put out sort of, in my view, was the catalyst or the tipping point</p>
<p>for this, this whole next wave of autonomous vehicle development. So that</p>
<p>was pretty cool. So let me jump around a little bit on that point.</p>
<p>They also did the Urban Challenge where it was in the city, but it was very</p>
<p>artificial and there&rsquo;s no pedestrians and there&rsquo;s very little human</p>
<p>involvement except a few professional drivers. Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s room, and then there was the Robotics Challenge with</p>
<p>humanoid robots. Right. So in your now role is looking at this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to solve one of the, you know, autonomous driving, one of the</p>
<p>harder, more difficult places in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Is there a role for DARPA to step in to also kind of help out,</p>
<p>like, challenge with new ideas, specifically pedestrians and so on, all</p>
<p>these kinds of interesting things? Well, I haven&rsquo;t, I haven&rsquo;t thought about it</p>
<p>from that perspective. Is there anything DARPA could do today to further</p>
<p>accelerate things? And I would say, my instinct is that that&rsquo;s maybe not the</p>
<p>highest and best use of their resources and time,</p>
<p>because, like, kick starting and spinning up the flywheel is, I think, what</p>
<p>what they did in this case for very, very little money. But today this has become,</p>
<p>this has become, like, commercially interesting to very large companies and</p>
<p>the amount of money going into it and the amount of</p>
<p>people, like, going through your class and learning about these things and</p>
<p>developing these skills is just, you know, orders of magnitude</p>
<p>more than it was back then. And so there&rsquo;s enough momentum and inertia</p>
<p>and energy and investment dollars into this space right now that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, I think they&rsquo;re, I think they&rsquo;re, they can just say mission</p>
<p>accomplished and move on to the next area of technology that needs help.</p>
<p>So then stepping back to MIT, you left MIT during your junior year.</p>
<p>What was that decision like? As I said, I always wanted to do</p>
<p>a company in, or start a company, and this opportunity landed in my lap, which</p>
<p>was a couple guys from Yale were starting a</p>
<p>new company, and I googled them and found that they had</p>
<p>started a company previously and sold it actually on eBay for</p>
<p>about a quarter million bucks, which was a pretty interesting story, but</p>
<p>so I thought to myself, these guys are, you know, rock star entrepreneurs, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done this before, they must be driving around in Ferraris</p>
<p>because they sold their company, and, you know, I thought I could learn</p>
<p>a lot from them, so I teamed up with those guys and,</p>
<p>you know, went out during, went out to California during IAP, which is MIT&rsquo;s</p>
<p>month off, on a one way ticket and basically never went back.</p>
<p>We were having so much fun, we felt like we were building something and creating</p>
<p>something, and it was going to be interesting</p>
<p>that, you know, I was just all in and got completely hooked, and that</p>
<p>that business was Justin TV, which is originally a reality show about a guy</p>
<p>named Justin, which morphed into a live video</p>
<p>streaming platform, which then morphed into what is Twitch</p>
<p>today, so that was, that was quite an unexpected journey.</p>
<p>So no regrets? No. Looking back, it was just an obvious, I mean,</p>
<p>one way ticket. I mean, if we just pause on that for a second,</p>
<p>there was no, how did you know these are the right guys, this is the</p>
<p>right decision, you didn&rsquo;t think it was just follow the</p>
<p>heart kind of thing? Well, I didn&rsquo;t know, but, you know, just trying something for a</p>
<p>month during IAP seems pretty low risk, right?</p>
<p>And then, you know, well, maybe I&rsquo;ll take a semester off, MIT&rsquo;s pretty flexible</p>
<p>about that, you can always go back, right? And then after two or three cycles of</p>
<p>that, I eventually threw in the towel, but, you know, I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I guess in that case I felt like I could always hit the undo button if I had to.</p>
<p>Right. But nevertheless, from when you look</p>
<p>in retrospect, I mean, it seems like a brave decision,</p>
<p>you know, it would be difficult for a lot of people to make. It wasn&rsquo;t as</p>
<p>popular, I&rsquo;d say that the general, you know, flux of people</p>
<p>out of MIT at the time was mostly into, you know, finance or consulting jobs in</p>
<p>Boston or New York, and very few people were going to</p>
<p>California to start companies, but today I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably inverted, which is just a sign of,</p>
<p>a sign of the times, I guess. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s a story about</p>
<p>midnight of March 18, 2007, where TechCrunch, I guess, announced</p>
<p>Justin.TV earlier than it was supposed to, a few hours.</p>
<p>The site didn&rsquo;t work. I don&rsquo;t know if any of this is true, you can tell me.</p>
<p>And you and one of the folks at Justin.TV,</p>
<p>Emmett Shearer, coded through the night. Can you take me through that experience?</p>
<p>So let me, let me say a few nice things that,</p>
<p>the article I read quoted Justin Kahn said that you were known for bureau</p>
<p>coding through problems and being a creative, quote, creative</p>
<p>genius. So on that night,</p>
<p>what, what was going through your head, or maybe I&rsquo;d put another way,</p>
<p>how do you solve these problems? What&rsquo;s your approach to solving these kinds of</p>
<p>problems where the line between success and failure seems to be pretty</p>
<p>thin? That&rsquo;s a good question. Well, first of all, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>nice of Justin to say that. I think, you know, I would have been</p>
<p>maybe 21 years old then and not very experienced at programming,</p>
<p>but as with, with everything in a startup, you&rsquo;re sort of racing against</p>
<p>the clock. And so our plan was the second we had</p>
<p>this live streaming camera backpack up and running, where Justin could wear it</p>
<p>and no matter where he went in a city, it</p>
<p>would be streaming live video. And this is</p>
<p>even before the iPhones. This is like hard to do back then.</p>
<p>We would launch. And so we thought we were there and the backpack was working</p>
<p>and then we sent out all the emails to launch the,</p>
<p>launch the company and do the press thing. And then, you know,</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t quite actually there. And then</p>
<p>we thought, oh, well, you know, they&rsquo;re not going to announce it until</p>
<p>maybe 10 a.m. the next morning. And it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s 5 p.m. now. So</p>
<p>how many hours do we have left? What is that? Like, you know, 17 hours to go.</p>
<p>And, and that was, that was going to be fine.</p>
<p>Was the problem obvious? Did you understand</p>
<p>what could possibly, like, how complicated was the system at that point?</p>
<p>It was, it was pretty messy. So to get a live video feed that looked decent</p>
<p>working from anywhere in San Francisco, I put together this system where we had</p>
<p>like three or four cell phone data modems and</p>
<p>they were, like, we take the video stream and,</p>
<p>you know, sort of spray it across these three or four modems and then try to</p>
<p>catch all the packets on the other side, you know, with unreliable cell phone</p>
<p>networks. It&rsquo;s pretty low level networking.</p>
<p>Yeah, and putting these, like, you know, sort of</p>
<p>protocols on top of all that to, to reassemble and reorder the packets and</p>
<p>have time buffers and error correction and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And the night before it was just staticky. Every once in a while the image</p>
<p>would, would go to staticky and there would be this horrible,</p>
<p>like, screeching audio noise because the audio was also corrupted.</p>
<p>And this would happen, like, every five to ten minutes or so and it was</p>
<p>a really, you know, off putting to the viewers.</p>
<p>How do you tackle that problem? What was the, uh, you&rsquo;re just freaking out behind a</p>
<p>computer. There&rsquo;s, are there other, other folks working</p>
<p>on this problem? Like, were you behind a whiteboard? Were you doing, uh,</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a little, it was a little, yeah, it&rsquo;s a little lonely because there&rsquo;s four of us</p>
<p>working on the company and only two people really wrote code.</p>
<p>And Emmett wrote the website and the chat system and I wrote the</p>
<p>software for this video streaming device and video server.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it&rsquo;s my sole responsibility to figure that out.</p>
<p>And I think, I think it&rsquo;s those, you know, setting,</p>
<p>setting deadlines, trying to move quickly and everything where you&rsquo;re in that</p>
<p>moment of intense pressure that sometimes people do their</p>
<p>best and most interesting work. And so even though that was a terrible moment,</p>
<p>I look back on it fondly because that&rsquo;s like, you know, that&rsquo;s one of those</p>
<p>character defining moments, I think. So in 2013, October, you founded</p>
<p>Cruise Automation. Yeah. So progressing forward, another</p>
<p>exceptionally successful company was acquired by GM in 16</p>
<p>for $1 billion. But in October 2013, what was on your mind?</p>
<p>What was the plan? How does one seriously start to tackle</p>
<p>one of the hardest robotics, most important impact for robotics</p>
<p>problems of our age? After going through Twitch, Twitch was,</p>
<p>was, and is today, pretty successful. But the, the work was,</p>
<p>the result was entertainment, mostly. Like, the better the product was,</p>
<p>the more we would entertain people and then, you know, make money on the ad</p>
<p>revenues and other things. And that was, that was a good thing. It</p>
<p>felt, felt good to entertain people. But I figured like, you know, what is really</p>
<p>the point of becoming a really good engineer and</p>
<p>developing these skills other than, you know, my own enjoyment? And I</p>
<p>realized I wanted something that scratched more of an existential</p>
<p>itch, like something that, that truly matters. And so I</p>
<p>basically made this list of requirements for a new, if I was going to</p>
<p>do another company, and the one thing I knew in the back of</p>
<p>my head that Twitch took like eight years to become successful.</p>
<p>And so whatever I do, I better be willing to commit, you know, at least 10 years</p>
<p>to something. And when you think about things from that perspective,</p>
<p>you certainly, I think, raise the bar on what you choose to work on. So for me,</p>
<p>the three things were it had to be something where the technology</p>
<p>itself determines the success of the product,</p>
<p>like hard, really juicy technology problems, because that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>motivates me. And then it had to have a direct and positive impact on society in</p>
<p>some way. So an example would be like, you know,</p>
<p>health care, self driving cars, because they save lives, other things where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a clear connection to somehow improving other people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>And the last one is it had to be a big business, because</p>
<p>for the positive impact to matter, it&rsquo;s got to be a large scale.</p>
<p>And I was thinking about that for a while, and I made like, I tried</p>
<p>writing a Gmail clone and looked at some other ideas.</p>
<p>And then it just sort of light bulb went off, like self driving cars, like that</p>
<p>was the most fun I had ever had in college working on that.</p>
<p>And like, well, what&rsquo;s the state of the technology? It&rsquo;s been 10 years.</p>
<p>Maybe times have changed, and maybe now is the time to make this work.</p>
<p>And I poked around and looked at, the only other thing out there really at the</p>
<p>time was the Google self driving car project.</p>
<p>And I thought, surely there&rsquo;s a way to, you know, have an entrepreneur mindset</p>
<p>and sort of solve the minimum viable product here.</p>
<p>And so I just took the plunge right then and there and said, this is something I</p>
<p>know I can commit 10 years to. It&rsquo;s the probably the greatest</p>
<p>applied AI problem of our generation. And if it works, it&rsquo;s going to be both a</p>
<p>huge business and therefore like, probably the most positive impact I can</p>
<p>possibly have on the world. So after that light bulb went off, I went</p>
<p>all in on cruise immediately and got to work.</p>
<p>Did you have an idea how to solve this problem? Which aspect of the problem to</p>
<p>solve? You know, slow, like we just had Oliver</p>
<p>from Voyage here, slow moving retirement communities,</p>
<p>urban driving, highway driving. Did you have, like, did you have a vision of the</p>
<p>city of the future where, you know, the transportation is</p>
<p>largely automated, that kind of thing? Or was it sort of</p>
<p>more fuzzy and gray area than that? My analysis of the situation is that</p>
<p>Google is putting a lot, had been putting a lot of money into that project. They</p>
<p>had a lot more resources. And so, and they still hadn&rsquo;t cracked</p>
<p>the fully driverless car. You know, this is 2013, I guess.</p>
<p>So I thought, what can I do to sort of go from zero to,</p>
<p>you know, significant scale so I can actually solve the real problem, which is</p>
<p>the driverless cars. And I thought, here&rsquo;s the strategy. We&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start by doing a really simple problem or solving a</p>
<p>really simple problem that creates value for people. So,</p>
<p>eventually ended up deciding on automating highway driving,</p>
<p>which is relatively more straightforward as long as there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>backup driver there. And, you know, the go to market will be able to retrofit</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s cars and just sell these products directly. And</p>
<p>the idea was, we&rsquo;ll take all the revenue and profits from that and use it</p>
<p>to do the, so sort of reinvest that in research for</p>
<p>doing fully driverless cars. And that was the plan.</p>
<p>The only thing that really changed along the way between then and now is</p>
<p>we never really launched the first product. We had enough interest from</p>
<p>investors and enough of a signal that this was</p>
<p>something that we should be working on, that after about a year of working on</p>
<p>the highway autopilot, we had it working, you know, on a</p>
<p>prototype stage. But we just completely abandoned that</p>
<p>and said, we&rsquo;re going to go all in on driverless cars now is the time.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t think of anything that&rsquo;s more exciting and if it works more impactful,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re just going to go for it. The idea of retrofit is kind of</p>
<p>interesting. Yeah. Being able to, it&rsquo;s how you achieve scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting idea. Is it something that&rsquo;s still in the</p>
<p>in the back of your mind as a possibility?</p>
<p>Not at all. I&rsquo;ve come full circle on that one. After</p>
<p>trying to build a retrofit product, and I&rsquo;ll touch on some of the complexities</p>
<p>of that, and then also having been inside an OEM</p>
<p>and seeing how things work and how a vehicle is developed and</p>
<p>validated. When it comes to something that has</p>
<p>safety critical implications like controlling the steering and</p>
<p>other control inputs on your car, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to get there</p>
<p>with a retrofit. Or if you did, even if you did, it creates a whole bunch</p>
<p>of new complications around liability or how did you truly validate</p>
<p>that. Or you know, something in the base vehicle fails and causes your system to</p>
<p>fail, whose fault is it?</p>
<p>Or if the car&rsquo;s anti lock brake systems or other things kick in</p>
<p>or the software has been, it&rsquo;s different in one version of the car you retrofit</p>
<p>versus another and you don&rsquo;t know because</p>
<p>the manufacturer has updated it behind the scenes. There&rsquo;s basically an</p>
<p>infinite list of long tail issues that can get you.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re dealing with a safety critical product, that&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>acceptable. That&rsquo;s a really convincing summary of why</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really challenging. But I didn&rsquo;t know all that at the time, so we tried it</p>
<p>anyway. But as a pitch also at the time, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really strong one. Because that&rsquo;s how you achieve scale and that&rsquo;s how you beat</p>
<p>the current, the leader at the time of Google or the only one in the market.</p>
<p>The other big problem we ran into, which is perhaps the biggest problem from a</p>
<p>business model perspective, is we had kind of assumed that we</p>
<p>started with an Audi S4 as the vehicle we</p>
<p>retrofitted with this highway driving capability.</p>
<p>And we had kind of assumed that if we just knock out like three</p>
<p>make and models of vehicles, that&rsquo;ll cover like 80% of the San Francisco</p>
<p>market. Doesn&rsquo;t everyone there drive, I don&rsquo;t know, a BMW or a Honda Civic or</p>
<p>one of these three cars? And then we surveyed our users and we found out that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all over the place. We would, to get even a decent number of</p>
<p>units sold, we&rsquo;d have to support like, you know, 20 or 50 different models.</p>
<p>And each one is a little butterfly that takes time and effort to maintain,</p>
<p>you know, that retrofit integration and custom hardware and all this.</p>
<p>So it was a tough business. So GM manufactures and sells over 9 million</p>
<p>cars a year. And what you with Cruise are trying to do</p>
<p>some of the most cutting edge innovation in terms of applying AI.</p>
<p>And so how do those, you&rsquo;ve talked about a little bit before, but it&rsquo;s also just</p>
<p>fascinating to me. We work a lot of automakers,</p>
<p>you know, the difference between the gap between Detroit</p>
<p>and Silicon Valley, let&rsquo;s say, just to be sort of poetic about it, I guess.</p>
<p>How do you close that gap? How do you take GM into the future</p>
<p>where a large part of the fleet will be autonomous, perhaps?</p>
<p>I want to start by acknowledging that GM is made up of,</p>
<p>you know, tens of thousands of really brilliant, motivated people who want to</p>
<p>be a part of the future. And so it&rsquo;s pretty fun to work</p>
<p>within the attitude inside a car company like that is, you</p>
<p>know, embracing this transformation and change</p>
<p>rather than fearing it. And I think that&rsquo;s a testament to</p>
<p>the leadership at GM and that&rsquo;s flown all the way through to everyone you</p>
<p>talk to, even the people in the assembly plants working on these cars.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really great. So starting from that position makes it a lot easier</p>
<p>so then when the people in San Francisco at Cruise</p>
<p>interact with the people at GM, at least we have this common set of values, which</p>
<p>is that we really want this stuff to work</p>
<p>because we think it&rsquo;s important and we think it&rsquo;s the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say, you know, those two cultures don&rsquo;t clash. They absolutely do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different sort of value systems. Like in a</p>
<p>car company, the thing that gets you promoted and sort of the reward</p>
<p>system is following the processes, delivering</p>
<p>the program on time and on budget. So any sort of risk taking</p>
<p>is discouraged in many ways because if a program is late or if you shut down</p>
<p>the plant for a day, it&rsquo;s, you know, you can count the millions of dollars that</p>
<p>burn by pretty quickly. Whereas I think, you know, most Silicon</p>
<p>Valley companies and in Cruise and the methodology</p>
<p>we were employing, especially around the time of the acquisition,</p>
<p>the reward structure is about trying to solve</p>
<p>these complex problems in any way shape or form or coming up with crazy ideas</p>
<p>that, you know, 90% of them won&rsquo;t work. And so meshing that culture</p>
<p>of sort of continuous improvement and experimentation</p>
<p>with one where everything needs to be rigorously defined up front so that</p>
<p>you never slip a deadline or miss a budget</p>
<p>was a pretty big challenge. And that we&rsquo;re over three years in now</p>
<p>after the acquisition and I&rsquo;d say like, you know, the investment we made in</p>
<p>figuring out how to work together successfully and</p>
<p>who should do what and how we bridge the gaps between these</p>
<p>very different systems and way of doing engineering work</p>
<p>is now one of our greatest assets because I think we have this really</p>
<p>powerful thing. But for a while it was both GM and Cruise were very</p>
<p>steep on the learning curve. Yeah, so I&rsquo;m sure it was very stressful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important work because that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>to revolutionize the transportation, really to revolutionize</p>
<p>any system. You know, you look at the health care system or you look at the</p>
<p>legal system. I have people like Loris come up to me all the time like</p>
<p>everything they&rsquo;re working on can easily be automated.</p>
<p>But then that&rsquo;s not a good feeling. Yeah, well it&rsquo;s not a good feeling but also</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way to automate because the entire infrastructure is really,</p>
<p>you know, based is older and it moves very slowly. And so</p>
<p>how do you close the gap between I have an</p>
<p>how can I replace, of course, Loris don&rsquo;t want to be replaced with an app, but you</p>
<p>could replace a lot of aspect when most of the data is still on paper.</p>
<p>And so the same thing was with automotive.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s fundamentally software. It&rsquo;s basically hiring software</p>
<p>engineers. It&rsquo;s thinking in a software world.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m pretty sure nobody in Silicon Valley has ever hit a deadline.</p>
<p>So and then on GM. That&rsquo;s probably true, yeah. And GM side is probably the</p>
<p>opposite. Yeah. So that&rsquo;s that culture gap is really fascinating.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re optimistic about the future of that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, from what I&rsquo;ve seen, it&rsquo;s impressive. And I think like</p>
<p>especially in Silicon Valley, it&rsquo;s easy to write off building cars because,</p>
<p>you know, people have been doing that for over 100 years now in this country. And</p>
<p>so it seems like that&rsquo;s a solved problem, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s an easy</p>
<p>problem. And I think it would be easy to sort of</p>
<p>overlook that and think that, you know, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Silicon Valley engineers. We can solve any problem, you know, building a car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been done. Therefore, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s not a real</p>
<p>engineering challenge. But after having seen just the sheer</p>
<p>scale and magnitude and industrialization</p>
<p>that occurs inside of an automotive assembly plant, that is a lot of work</p>
<p>that I am very glad that we don&rsquo;t have to reinvent</p>
<p>to make self driving cars work. And so to have, you know, partners who have done</p>
<p>that for 100 years now, these great processes and this huge infrastructure</p>
<p>and supply base that we can tap into is just remarkable</p>
<p>because the scope and surface area of</p>
<p>the problem of deploying fleets of self driving cars is so large</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re constantly looking for ways to do less</p>
<p>so we can focus on the things that really matter more. And if we had to</p>
<p>figure out how to build and assemble and</p>
<p>you know, build the cars themselves. I mean, we work closely with GM on</p>
<p>that. But if we had to develop all that capability in house as well,</p>
<p>you know, that would just make the problem really intractable, I think.</p>
<p>So yeah, just like your first entry at the MIT DARPA challenge when</p>
<p>there was what the motor that failed, somebody that knows what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing with the motor did it. That would have been nice if we could</p>
<p>focus on the software, not the hardware platform.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right. So from your perspective now,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s so many ways that autonomous vehicles can impact</p>
<p>society in the next year, five years, ten years.</p>
<p>What do you think is the biggest opportunity to make</p>
<p>money in autonomous driving, sort of make it a</p>
<p>financially viable thing in the near term?</p>
<p>What do you think will be the biggest impact there?</p>
<p>Well, the things that drive the economics for fleets of self driving</p>
<p>cars are, there&rsquo;s sort of a handful of variables. One is,</p>
<p>you know, the cost to build the vehicle itself. So the material cost, how many,</p>
<p>you know, what&rsquo;s the cost of all your sensors plus the cost of the vehicle and</p>
<p>every all the other components on it. Another one is the lifetime of the</p>
<p>vehicle. It&rsquo;s very different if your vehicle</p>
<p>drives 100,000 miles and then it falls apart versus,</p>
<p>you know, two million. And then, you know, if you have a fleet, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like an airplane or an airline where</p>
<p>once you produce the vehicle, you want it to be in</p>
<p>operation as many hours a day as possible producing revenue.</p>
<p>And then, you know, the other piece of that is</p>
<p>how are you generating revenue? I think that&rsquo;s kind of what you&rsquo;re asking. And I</p>
<p>think the obvious things today are, you know, the ride sharing business</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s pretty clear that there&rsquo;s demand for that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s existing markets you can tap into and</p>
<p>large urban areas, that kind of thing. Yeah, yeah. And I think that there are</p>
<p>some real benefits to having cars without</p>
<p>drivers compared to sort of the status quo for</p>
<p>people who use ride share services today.</p>
<p>You know, you get privacy, consistency, hopefully significantly improve safety,</p>
<p>all these benefits versus the current product.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a crowded market. And then other opportunities, which you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen a lot of activity in the last, really in the last six or twelve months,</p>
<p>is, you know, delivery, whether that&rsquo;s parcels and packages,</p>
<p>food or groceries. Those are all sort of, I think, opportunities that are</p>
<p>pretty ripe for these, you know, once you have this</p>
<p>core technology, which is the fleet of autonomous vehicles, there&rsquo;s all sorts of</p>
<p>different business opportunities you can build on</p>
<p>top of that. But I think the important thing, of course, is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s zero monetization opportunity until you actually have that fleet of</p>
<p>very capable driverless cars that are that are as good or better than humans.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of where the entire industry is</p>
<p>sort of in this holding pattern right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re trying to achieve that baseline. So, but you said sort of</p>
<p>not reliability, consistency. It&rsquo;s kind of interesting, I think I heard you say</p>
<p>somewhere, I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s what you meant, but</p>
<p>you know, I can imagine a situation where you would get an autonomous vehicle</p>
<p>and, you know, when you get into an Uber or Lyft,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get to choose the driver in a sense that you don&rsquo;t get to choose the</p>
<p>personality of the driving. Do you think there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s room</p>
<p>to define the personality of the car the way it drives you in terms of</p>
<p>aggressiveness, for example, in terms of sort of pushing the</p>
<p>bound? One of the biggest challenges of autonomous driving is the</p>
<p>is the trade off between sort of safety and</p>
<p>assertiveness. And do you think there&rsquo;s any room</p>
<p>for the human to take a role in that decision? Sort of accept some of the</p>
<p>liability, I guess. I wouldn&rsquo;t, no, I&rsquo;d say within</p>
<p>reasonable bounds, as in we&rsquo;re not gonna, I think it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>highly unlikely we&rsquo;d expose any knob that would let you, you know, significantly</p>
<p>increase safety risk. I think that&rsquo;s just not</p>
<p>something we&rsquo;d be willing to do. But I think driving style or like, you</p>
<p>know, are you going to relax the comfort constraints slightly or things like that,</p>
<p>all of those things make sense and are plausible. I see all those as, you know,</p>
<p>nice optimizations. Once again, we get the core problem solved in these fleets</p>
<p>out there. But the other thing we&rsquo;ve sort of</p>
<p>observed is that you have this intuition that if you</p>
<p>sort of slam your foot on the gas right after the light turns green and</p>
<p>aggressively accelerate, you&rsquo;re going to get there faster. But the</p>
<p>actual impact of doing that is pretty small.</p>
<p>You feel like you&rsquo;re getting there faster, but so the same would be</p>
<p>true for AVs. Even if they don&rsquo;t slam their, you know, the pedal to the floor</p>
<p>when the light turns green, they&rsquo;re going to get you there within, you</p>
<p>know, if it&rsquo;s a 15 minute trip, within 30 seconds of what you would have done</p>
<p>otherwise if you were going really aggressively.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s this sort of self deception that my aggressive</p>
<p>driving style is getting me there faster.</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s, you know, some of the things I&rsquo;ve studied, some of the things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the psychology of that. I don&rsquo;t think it matters</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t get you there faster. It&rsquo;s the emotional release.</p>
<p>Driving is a place, being inside of a car,</p>
<p>somebody said it&rsquo;s like the real world version of being a troll.</p>
<p>So you have this protection, this mental protection, you&rsquo;re able to sort of yell</p>
<p>at the world, like release your anger, whatever.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an element of that that I think autonomous vehicles would also</p>
<p>have to, you know, giving an outlet to people, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>through, through, through driving or honking or so on.</p>
<p>There might be other outlets, but I think to just sort of even just put that aside,</p>
<p>the baseline is really, you know, that&rsquo;s the focus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing you need to solve.</p>
<p>And then the fun human things can be solved after.</p>
<p>But so from the baseline of just solving autonomous driving, you&rsquo;re working in</p>
<p>San Francisco, one of the more difficult cities to operate in.</p>
<p>What is, what is the, in your view, currently the hardest</p>
<p>aspect of autonomous driving?</p>
<p>Is it negotiating with pedestrians?</p>
<p>Is it edge cases of perception?</p>
<p>Is it planning?</p>
<p>Is there a mechanical engineering?</p>
<p>Is it data, fleet stuff?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the challenge, the more challenging aspects there?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I think before, before we go to that, though, I just want to, I like what you</p>
<p>said about the psychology aspect of this,</p>
<p>because I think one observation I&rsquo;ve made is I think I read somewhere that I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s maybe Americans on average spend, you know, over an hour a day on</p>
<p>social media, like staring at Facebook.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just, you know, 60 minutes of your life, you&rsquo;re not getting back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not super productive.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s 3,600 seconds, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s time, you know, it&rsquo;s a lot of time you&rsquo;re giving up.</p>
<p>And if you compare that to people being on the road, if another vehicle, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a human driver or autonomous vehicle, delays them by even three</p>
<p>seconds, they&rsquo;re laying in on the horn, you know, even though that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, one, one thousandth of the time they waste looking at Facebook every day.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s definitely some.</p>
<p>You know, psychology aspects of this, I think that are pretty interesting road</p>
<p>rage in general.</p>
<p>And then the question of course is if everyone is in self driving cars,</p>
<p>do they even notice these three second delays anymore?</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re doing other things or reading or working or just talking to</p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see where that goes.</p>
<p>In a certain aspect, people, people need to be distracted by something</p>
<p>entertaining, something useful inside the car.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t pay attention to the external world.</p>
<p>And then, and then they can take whatever psychology and bring it back to</p>
<p>Twitter and then focus on that as opposed to sort of interacting, sort of putting</p>
<p>the emotion out there into the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s an interesting problem, but baseline autonomy.</p>
<p>I guess you could say self driving cars, you know, at scale will lower the</p>
<p>collective blood pressure of society probably by a couple of points without</p>
<p>all that road rage and stress.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good, good external.</p>
<p>So back to your question about the technology and the, I guess the biggest</p>
<p>problems.</p>
<p>And I have a hard time answering that question because, you know, we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>at this like specifically focusing on driverless cars and all the technology</p>
<p>needed to enable that for a little over four and a half years now.</p>
<p>And even a year or two in, I felt like we had completed the functionality needed</p>
<p>to get someone from point A to point B.</p>
<p>As in, if we need to do a left turn maneuver, or if we need to drive around</p>
<p>at, you know, a double parked vehicle into oncoming traffic or navigate</p>
<p>through construction zones, the scaffolding and the building blocks was</p>
<p>there pretty early on.</p>
<p>And so the challenge is not any one scenario or situation for which, you</p>
<p>know, we fail at 100% of those.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more, you know, we&rsquo;re benchmarking against a pretty good or pretty high</p>
<p>standard, which is human driving.</p>
<p>All things considered, humans are excellent at handling edge cases and</p>
<p>unexpected scenarios where computers are the opposite.</p>
<p>And so beating that baseline set by humans is the challenge.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;ve been doing for quite some time now is basically, it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>continuous improvement process where we find sort of the most, you know,</p>
<p>uncomfortable or the things that could lead to a safety issue or other</p>
<p>things, all these events.</p>
<p>And then we sort of categorize them and rework parts of our system to make</p>
<p>incremental improvements and do that over and over and over again.</p>
<p>And we just see sort of the overall performance of the system, you know,</p>
<p>actually increasing in a pretty steady clip.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no one thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually like thousands of little things and just like polishing functionality</p>
<p>and making sure that it handles, you know, every version and possible</p>
<p>permutation of a situation by either applying more deep learning systems or</p>
<p>just by, you know, adding more test coverage or new scenarios that we</p>
<p>develop against and just grinding on that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sort of in the unsexy phase of development right now, which is doing</p>
<p>the real engineering work that it takes to go from prototype to production.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically scaling the grinding, sort of taking seriously that the</p>
<p>process of all those edge cases, both with human experts and machine</p>
<p>learning methods to cover all those situations.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the exciting thing for me is I don&rsquo;t think that grinding ever stops because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a moment in time where you&rsquo;ve crossed that threshold of human</p>
<p>performance and become superhuman.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no reason, there&rsquo;s no first principles reason that AV capability</p>
<p>will tap out anywhere near humans.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no reason it couldn&rsquo;t be 20 times better, whether that&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, just better driving or safer driving or more comfortable driving or</p>
<p>even a thousand times better given enough time.</p>
<p>And we intend to basically chase that, you know, forever to build the best</p>
<p>possible product.</p>
<p>Better and better and better.</p>
<p>And always new edge cases come up and new experiences.</p>
<p>So, and you want to automate that process as much as possible.</p>
<p>So what do you think in general in society?</p>
<p>When do you think we may have hundreds of thousands of fully autonomous</p>
<p>vehicles driving around?</p>
<p>So first of all, predictions, nobody knows the future.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a part of the leading people trying to define that future, but even</p>
<p>then you still don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But if you think about hundreds of thousands of vehicles, so a significant</p>
<p>fraction of vehicles in major cities are autonomous.</p>
<p>Do you think, are you with Rodney Brooks, who is 2050 and beyond, or are you</p>
<p>more with Elon Musk, who is, we should have had that two years ago?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;d love to have it two years ago, but we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>So I guess the way I would think about that is let&rsquo;s flip that question</p>
<p>around.</p>
<p>So what would prevent you to reach hundreds of thousands of vehicles?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good, that&rsquo;s a good rephrasing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the, I&rsquo;d say the, it seems the consensus among the people developing</p>
<p>self driving cars today is to sort of start with some form of an easier</p>
<p>environment, whether it means, you know, lacking inclement weather or, you</p>
<p>know, mostly sunny or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And then add, add capability for more complex situations over time.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re only able to deploy in areas that meet sort of your</p>
<p>criteria or the current domain, you know, operating domain of the</p>
<p>software you developed, that may put a cap on how many cities you could</p>
<p>deploy in.</p>
<p>But then as those restrictions start to fall away, like maybe you add</p>
<p>capability to drive really well and safely in heavy rain or snow, you</p>
<p>know, that, that probably opens up the market by two, two or three fold</p>
<p>in terms of the cities you can expand into and so on.</p>
<p>And so the real question is, you know, I know today if we wanted to, we</p>
<p>could produce that, that many autonomous vehicles, but we wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>able to make use of all of them yet.</p>
<p>Cause we would sort of saturate the demand in the cities in which we</p>
<p>would want to operate initially.</p>
<p>So if I were to guess like what the timeline is for those things falling</p>
<p>away and reaching hundreds of thousands of vehicles, I would say that</p>
<p>thousands of vehicles, maybe a range is better, I would say less than</p>
<p>five years, less than five years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And of course you&rsquo;re working hard to make that happen.</p>
<p>So you started two companies that were eventually acquired for each</p>
<p>four billion dollars.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a pretty good person to ask, what does it take to build a</p>
<p>successful startup?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s sort of survivor bias here a little bit, but</p>
<p>I can try to find some common threads for the things that worked for</p>
<p>me, which is, you know, in, in both of these companies, I was really</p>
<p>passionate about the core technology.</p>
<p>I actually like, you know, lay awake at night thinking about these</p>
<p>problems and how to solve them.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s helpful because when you start a business, there</p>
<p>are like to this day, there are these crazy ups and downs.</p>
<p>Like one day you think the business is just on, you&rsquo;re just on top of</p>
<p>the world and unstoppable.</p>
<p>And the next day you think, okay, this is all going to end, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just going south and it&rsquo;s going to be over tomorrow.</p>
<p>And and so I think like having a true passion that you can fall back</p>
<p>on and knowing that you would be doing it, even if you weren&rsquo;t getting</p>
<p>paid for it, helps you weather those, those tough times.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>I think the other one is really good people.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always been surrounded by really good cofounders that are</p>
<p>logical thinkers are always pushing their limits and have very high</p>
<p>levels of integrity.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Dan Kahn and my current company and actually his brother and</p>
<p>a couple other guys for Justin TV and Twitch.</p>
<p>And then I think the last thing is just I guess persistence or</p>
<p>perseverance, like, and, and that, that can apply to sticking to sort</p>
<p>of, or having conviction around the original premise of your idea and</p>
<p>sticking around to do all the, you know, the unsexy work to actually</p>
<p>make it come to fruition, including dealing with, you know, whatever</p>
<p>it is that you, that you&rsquo;re not passionate about, whether that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>finance or, or HR or, or operations or those things, as long as you</p>
<p>are grinding away and working towards, you know, that North star</p>
<p>for your business, whatever it is, and you don&rsquo;t give up and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making progress every day, it seems like eventually you&rsquo;ll end up in a</p>
<p>good place.</p>
<p>And the only things that can slow you down are, you know, running out</p>
<p>of money or I suppose your competitors destroying you.</p>
<p>But I think most of the time it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s people giving up or, or somehow</p>
<p>destroying things themselves rather than being beaten by their competition</p>
<p>or running out of money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you never quit, eventually you&rsquo;ll arrive.</p>
<p>So, uh, it&rsquo;s a much more concise version of what I was trying to say.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was good.</p>
<p>So you went the Y Combinator route twice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think in a quick question, do you think is the best way to</p>
<p>raise funds in the early days or not just funds, but just community</p>
<p>develop your idea and so on.</p>
<p>Can you do it solo or maybe with a co founder with like self funded?</p>
<p>Do you think Y Combinator is good?</p>
<p>Is it good to do VC route?</p>
<p>Is there no right answer or is there from the Y Combinator experience</p>
<p>something that you could take away that that was the right path to take?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one size fits all answer, but if your ambition I think is to, you</p>
<p>know, see how big you can make something or, or, or rapidly expand and capture</p>
<p>a market or solve a problem or whatever it is, then, then, you know, going to</p>
<p>venture back route is probably a good approach so that, so that capital doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>become your primary constraint.</p>
<p>Y Combinator I love because it puts you in this, uh, sort of competitive</p>
<p>environment where you&rsquo;re, where you&rsquo;re surrounded by, you know, the top, maybe</p>
<p>1% of other really highly motivated, you know, peers who are in the same, same</p>
<p>place and that, uh, that environment I think just breeds breed success, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re surrounded by really brilliant, hardworking people, you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>feel, you know, sort of compelled or inspired to, to try to emulate them and</p>
<p>or beat them.</p>
<p>And, uh, so even though I had done it once before and I felt like, yeah, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty self motivated.</p>
<p>I thought like, look, this is going to be a hard problem.</p>
<p>I can use all the help I can get.</p>
<p>So surrounding myself with other entrepreneurs is going to make me work a</p>
<p>little bit harder or push a little harder than it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I, why I did it, you know, for example, the second time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, uh, let&rsquo;s go philosophical existential.</p>
<p>If you go back and do something differently in your life, starting in the</p>
<p>high school and MIT leaving MIT, you could have gone the PhD route doing the</p>
<p>startup, going to see about a startup in California and you, or maybe some</p>
<p>aspects of fundraising.</p>
<p>Is there something you regret, something you not necessarily regret, but if</p>
<p>you go back, you could do differently.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes, like, you know, pretty much everything</p>
<p>you can screw up.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve screwed up at least once, but I, you know, I don&rsquo;t regret those</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s hard to, it&rsquo;s hard to look back on things, even if it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go well and call it a regret, because hopefully it took away some new knowledge</p>
<p>or learning from that.</p>
<p>So I would say there was a period.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The closest I can, I can come to is there&rsquo;s a period, um, in, in Justin</p>
<p>TV, I think after seven years where, you know, the company was going one</p>
<p>direction, which is towards Twitch, uh, in video gaming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a video gamer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really even use Twitch at all.</p>
<p>And I was still, uh, working on the core technology there, but my, my heart</p>
<p>was no longer in it because the business that we were creating was not something</p>
<p>that I was personally passionate about.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t meet your bar of existential impact.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say I probably spent an extra year or two working on that.</p>
<p>And, uh, and I&rsquo;d say like, I would have just tried to do something different</p>
<p>sooner because those, those were two years where I felt like, um, you know,</p>
<p>from this philosophical or existential thing, I just, I just felt that</p>
<p>something was missing.</p>
<p>And so I would have, I would have, if I could look back now and tell myself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I would have said exactly that.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re not getting any meaning out of your work personally right now.</p>
<p>You should, you should find a way to change that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s part of the pitch I use to basically everyone who joins</p>
<p>Cruise today, it&rsquo;s like, Hey, you&rsquo;ve got that now by coming here.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you needed the two years of that existential dread to develop</p>
<p>the feeling that ultimately it was the fire that created Cruise.</p>
<p>So, you never know.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, good theory.</p>
<p>So last question, what does 2019 hold for Cruise?</p>
<p>After this, I guess we&rsquo;re going to go and I&rsquo;ll talk to your class.</p>
<p>But one of the big things is going from prototype to production, uh, for</p>
<p>autonomous cars and what does that mean?</p>
<p>What does that look like?</p>
<p>And 2019 for us is the year that we try to cross over that threshold and reach,</p>
<p>you know, superhuman level of performance to some degree with the software and,</p>
<p>uh, have all the other of the thousands of little building blocks in place to,</p>
<p>to launch, um, you know, our, our first, uh, commercial product.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s in store for us or in store for us.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a lot of brilliant people working on it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s all up to us now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>From Charlie Miller and Chris Vells, like the people I&rsquo;ve crossed paths with.</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>If you, it sounds like you have an amazing team.</p>
<p>So, um, like I said, it&rsquo;s one of the most, I think one of the most important</p>
<p>problems in artificial intelligence of the century.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be one of the most defining, the super exciting that you work on it.</p>
<p>And, uh, the best of luck in 2018, I&rsquo;m really excited to see what</p>
<p>Cruz comes up with.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me today.</p>
<p>Thanks, Carl.</p>
