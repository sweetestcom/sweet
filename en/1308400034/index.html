    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Hi friends, so this week we&rsquo;re talking discipline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you everything I know about it, how I&rsquo;ve built it, how I&rsquo;ve been so strong</p>
<p>and pushed myself to do this shit that I don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you all my tricks, okay?</p>
<p>But I am going to have to get up under your ass a little bit and push you.</p>
<p>In this episode, bitch, get ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to reframe this shit for you mentally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you a new mindset and then set you free with it.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;m also going to talk about those times where you have stuff that you need to</p>
<p>do and you know those times when you all of a sudden get this urge of like, fuck it.</p>
<p>Fuck it all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care no more.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like you cross your arms.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>Like I deal with that shit a lot, but I&rsquo;m going to tell you how to get through that</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to unpack it and I&rsquo;m going to give you a little solution.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s kick this shit off with my first tip is you don&rsquo;t have to feel like it</p>
<p>in order to do something.</p>
<p>And I know I&rsquo;ve talked about that before, but I have a little analogy that my friend</p>
<p>told me that&rsquo;s going to kind of wrap this up for you.</p>
<p>But the main thing, bitch, you ain&rsquo;t got to feel like it to do it.</p>
<p>You ain&rsquo;t got to feel like it to get it done.</p>
<p>You think I feel like going to the gym?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You think I feel like recording this goddamn podcast right now?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking midnight.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;ll be having fun when I record these.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolute drag to get myself to film an episode sometimes, but it&rsquo;s like as soon</p>
<p>as I sit down and start rambling, it gets easier.</p>
<p>But the whole like getting there, bitch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m sitting there on my ass watching TikTok, enjoying myself laying in my bed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I have to get up and go film this episode.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t want to, you know, but I constantly have to remind myself like, yo, you got a</p>
<p>deadline one, but two, you don&rsquo;t have to feel like getting up to get the fuck up and go</p>
<p>sit down and record the episode.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t have to feel like it to do it.</p>
<p>You can still do it.</p>
<p>You can still function while not feeling like it, while not feeling motivated, while not</p>
<p>feeling inspired, you can still function if you&rsquo;re tired.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my first tip.</p>
<p>And the analogy that my friend Carrie gave me, it&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re on a boat, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking out into the water, and there&rsquo;s something that you want in the water, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in your best interest or one of your goals or something that you want to achieve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s in the water, you can jump in and go get it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you, the water is fucking cold, like that water is cold as shit.</p>
<p>But what you want is right there in it.</p>
<p>Like you just have to jump in, swim and go get it.</p>
<p>What you want is right there.</p>
<p>Are you still gonna jump?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m telling you, it&rsquo;s cold, bitch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, it&rsquo;s gonna suck to work toward what you want to work toward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, it&rsquo;s gonna be ass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be cold.</p>
<p>The water&rsquo;s gonna be fucking cold.</p>
<p>Are you still gonna jump?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a matter of like, is it gonna be hard?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you right now, it&rsquo;s gonna be hard.</p>
<p>The water&rsquo;s gonna be cold.</p>
<p>Are you gonna jump, puto?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that helps me a lot.</p>
<p>I have to remind myself of that all the time.</p>
<p>I constantly just ask myself in my head, okay, but are you still gonna jump with anything?</p>
<p>Like anything I&rsquo;m working on, and I&rsquo;m like, this sucks, like, okay, bitch, yeah, it sucks.</p>
<p>So my next tip is get very, very clear on what it is you want, and then what you need</p>
<p>to do to get there.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to think of the perfect fucking route to get somewhere.</p>
<p>I can do a full podcast episode about finding the right path to take, okay?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s its own fucking thing.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stress about trying to find the right path.</p>
<p>Just get clear on what it is you want, and then make an action plan of how you can get</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>So an example from my personal life is there&rsquo;s a certain certification I&rsquo;m trying to get</p>
<p>for a whole unrelated thing in my life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna talk about it, okay?</p>
<p>Leave me alone.</p>
<p>Leave me to my own little devices and what I&rsquo;m gonna fucking do.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s this certification and this thing and this venture I&rsquo;m about to take on, and</p>
<p>I need to do certain things, learn certain processes in order to take an exam, to pass</p>
<p>a certain test to get a certification that I&rsquo;m wanting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know a fuck thing about what I&rsquo;m about to be tested on.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s literally, I know nothing about it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sitting here right now knowing nothing, and I know where I want to go is knowledgeable</p>
<p>enough to take this exam and pass it, okay?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a big gap there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fat ass gap between me right now and the me that can pass the test.</p>
<p>I need to turn myself into the version of me that can pass that test.</p>
<p>So what can I do?</p>
<p>I bought a certain textbook.</p>
<p>I can read that.</p>
<p>I can watch YouTube videos.</p>
<p>I can call certain people that are in the field.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at getting into and talk to them.</p>
<p>I can ask them questions.</p>
<p>I can get an exam prep book.</p>
<p>I can take practice exams.</p>
<p>I can take practice tests.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a list of all this shit that I can do.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like cutesy.</p>
<p>You have all the things that you&rsquo;ve thought of you can do.</p>
<p>So I have all that.</p>
<p>Now, your next step is break that shit down into daily tasks and things you can do every</p>
<p>single day that are gonna guaranteed get you where you want to be.</p>
<p>So for me, I&rsquo;m like, okay, I&rsquo;ll read this number of pages in my textbook.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll watch two to three YouTube videos a day, minimum two.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make notes of anything I&rsquo;m confused on.</p>
<p>Because once a week, I&rsquo;m going to make myself have a call with someone in the field I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>looking to get into and talk to them and have them answer my questions.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m going to take a practice exam each week, whether I&rsquo;m prepared or fucking not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna take a practice test, breaking it down into daily actions you can take.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mindfuck.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s a trick that I use to make the consequences instant for not doing something.</p>
<p>So human beings will push shit off if the consequences are like out in the future.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, okay, that&rsquo;s how we all are.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s easy to push shit off.</p>
<p>If you know the consequences tomorrow, or the consequences in a week from now.</p>
<p>Every day, if you know what you need to do every single day to get to where you want</p>
<p>to go, at the end of the day, if you can&rsquo;t check off that you&rsquo;ve done what you know you</p>
<p>need to do, your consequences experienced right then and there at the end of the day,</p>
<p>that you have not moved forward, that you have not made progress towards your goal.</p>
<p>It becomes a daily consequence and a negative feeling every day that you don&rsquo;t take the</p>
<p>actions you know you need to take.</p>
<p>Because when it&rsquo;s a week away, it&rsquo;s not a big fucking deal.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ll do it tomorrow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do double tomorrow to make up for what I didn&rsquo;t do today.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s none of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s daily, I fucked up, you know, and it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s uncomfortable to experience consequences</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to keep you accountable and keep you moving.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my biggest fucking thing that&rsquo;s helped me is getting very clear on the daily</p>
<p>actions I can take to get me where I need to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, by the end of this two months, I&rsquo;ll have read this full textbook, I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>watched all these YouTube videos, I&rsquo;ve taken all these practice exams, and I&rsquo;ll be ready</p>
<p>for this motherfucking test.</p>
<p>Like I can clearly see how I&rsquo;m going to get to where I want to get to.</p>
<p>But breaking that shit down daily, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s unavoidable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a matter of isn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s planned to happen.</p>
<p>Now I just need to do what I need to do.</p>
<p>Once you put it in daily tasks, it becomes very much part of your control, you feel like</p>
<p>you have control over it.</p>
<p>And also, like I said, it makes you experience the consequences every day of not doing what</p>
<p>you said you&rsquo;re going to do, which will piss you off and hurt your feelings and make you</p>
<p>be like, fuck, I have no one to blame but myself.</p>
<p>But something else with this is it will instantly build your self esteem, because you will be</p>
<p>able to see the positive impact of the actions you&rsquo;re taking.</p>
<p>When you feel like what you&rsquo;re doing is for something, you&rsquo;ll feel a lot better about</p>
<p>doing it, you&rsquo;ll want to do it.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re very clear on the impact your actions will have, bitch, you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>want to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to be a nice little fire under your ass that keeps you moving.</p>
<p>And the self esteem comes in because you&rsquo;re going to be doing what you say you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to be seeing the impact that your actions are having, and you can&rsquo;t not</p>
<p>feel good about yourself when you&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>But my next point that kind of piggybacks off of that one, with knowing what you need</p>
<p>to do daily, bitch, I&rsquo;m telling you, make a fucking worksheet.</p>
<p>I am like a toddler mentally.</p>
<p>I be knowing a lot of things, but I still function like a fucking toddler.</p>
<p>I love a little arts and craft.</p>
<p>I love a make it fun.</p>
<p>I love flipping a situation and making it a good time.</p>
<p>I like making things an activity.</p>
<p>If you follow me on Instagram, you know that I put my vitamins in a cute little shot glass</p>
<p>every morning, it&rsquo;s like a little stem on it, it&rsquo;s real cutesy.</p>
<p>I like to make shit look pretty, I like to make shit look cute, I like to make it fun.</p>
<p>Make what you need to do every day a fucking worksheet.</p>
<p>I used to put it in my phone, in my notes app, and I would just check it off.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>As soon as I started literally typing up a word document for my week of everything I</p>
<p>need to do every day of the week, I bought a fucking printer so that I could physically</p>
<p>have a printed out piece of paper that outlined everything I needed to do, and I got to check</p>
<p>it off.</p>
<p>So I have one for my diet, I have one for exercise, and I have one for the goals I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working on for my social media, how much I need to post, what I need to post, when I</p>
<p>need to record it.</p>
<p>I also have another worksheet for my goals, for the certification that I want to get.</p>
<p>My life is worksheets right now, and it&rsquo;s so fucking cute, because I have them all sitting</p>
<p>on my bar, spaced out, so every day I look at them, and I have a highlighter, and every</p>
<p>day I complete one of the things that I&rsquo;m doing, I check it off, and it&rsquo;s like the satisfaction</p>
<p>of physically getting to color on the fucking page with a highlighter, oh my god, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking explain it, but it just does something to you.</p>
<p>And when you can see your full week laid out, you can see the days that you fucked</p>
<p>up, you can see the days that you did perfect, and if you want to fill up the whole sheet</p>
<p>and block it all out, you can&rsquo;t fuck up.</p>
<p>You have to stay consistent, and if you want to color out that whole sheet, it&rsquo;s like bitch,</p>
<p>you gotta be on top of your shit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a trick that I&rsquo;ve noticed that has helped me so much.</p>
<p>I know it sounds so fucking stupid, I don&rsquo;t have a planner, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about</p>
<p>a planner, but I do be having worksheets, okay?</p>
<p>But a big thing about the worksheet, don&rsquo;t do it too grand scale, like a week.</p>
<p>I do weekly worksheets, like so it&rsquo;s a week on one page.</p>
<p>Set your worksheets with an end date, because when you&rsquo;re doing something that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really enjoy, it&rsquo;s like, you can suffer longer when you know it ends, like, if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>guaranteed end date for when the suffering stops, or doing the uncomfortable activity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to do it easier than if there was no end date, okay?</p>
<p>So giving yourself an end date to, this is my next week of goals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, I just have to grind it out for this one week, and then I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s a month, like if you actually are gonna do this for a full month, just tell</p>
<p>yourself it&rsquo;s for a week.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re focused on the worksheet at hand, which says one fucking week.</p>
<p>So do it for the week, and then at the end of the week, print out a new one.</p>
<p>See if you need to change anything.</p>
<p>See if you can do more than you actually put down, and change it.</p>
<p>But the whole thing is setting an end date to your suffering, because it will make things</p>
<p>feel easier, and you will feel like you&rsquo;re suffering less.</p>
<p>I promise, it&rsquo;s just a little fucking human psychology thing that I&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s psychology or not, but I fucking think it works.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing what my worksheets look like, and you want to see how I space</p>
<p>everything out and lay everything out to be the most efficient, I will put a link in the</p>
<p>description of this podcast, where you can go download a copy.</p>
<p>So there will be a copy of my specific worksheets, and an example of how I use them, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also going to be a blank template.</p>
<p>So the exact worksheets that I use, I&rsquo;ll show you how I use it, and then there will be a</p>
<p>blank template for where you can put your goals into it, and break your shit down, so</p>
<p>you can stay consistent.</p>
<p>So like I said, the link will be in the description of this podcast, if you want to check those</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>Okay, my next one is forgetting you to do the shit that you don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>So think of someone that you respect a lot.</p>
<p>Who is someone that you respect, and they&rsquo;re hardworking, and you&rsquo;re kind of intimidated</p>
<p>by them?</p>
<p>Like maybe they&rsquo;re 25 steps ahead of you, or they are where you want to be.</p>
<p>So for me, that person is Laila Hormozy.</p>
<p>I like Alex too, her husband, like they&rsquo;re entrepreneurs, they be making like 100 million</p>
<p>dollars a year, like they&rsquo;re with the shits, they be making the monies, okay?</p>
<p>But like, Laila&rsquo;s a tough ass bitch.</p>
<p>And I like Alex too, but I just connect more with girls, like the girls and the gays just</p>
<p>fucking connect, I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>But that is just a tough ass woman, and I look up to her so much, and all the advice</p>
<p>she has, and all the shit that she says and shares, like, it&rsquo;s so insane to me.</p>
<p>But I respect her so much.</p>
<p>So when I don&rsquo;t want to do something, or if something happens that holds me back, or I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>tired, or I&rsquo;m upset, or like whatever the fuck happens, it&rsquo;s like, I just imagine going</p>
<p>to Laila with my excuse for why I didn&rsquo;t do what I needed to do.</p>
<p>And then I imagine her, like how she would respond to me.</p>
<p>And that bitch, like, oh my god, I know she would laugh at me.</p>
<p>I know she would be like, come on, like, get real.</p>
<p>Like it just puts things into perspective when you take what is fucking with you right</p>
<p>now, and you&rsquo;re like, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna allow this to be why I don&rsquo;t accomplish what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>set out to accomplish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it just puts it into perspective of like, get your fucking ass up and move,</p>
<p>bitch.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get through it, you&rsquo;ll get over it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when I was moving into my apartment and everything was going wrong, I was like,</p>
<p>oh my god, all this shit could stop me from working on what I wanted to work on.</p>
<p>But I just imagine telling Laila, yeah, having all these things go wrong is why I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>continue working.</p>
<p>Like, she would look at me and be like, and?</p>
<p>Like all that shit&rsquo;s going wrong and what?</p>
<p>And what about it?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to stop.</p>
<p>It might be a little bit more difficult, but get your fucking ass moving, you know?</p>
<p>So just imagine telling someone that you respect your excuse for why you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>something because I was tired.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel motivated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna fucking fly and like, it&rsquo;s gonna, you&rsquo;re gonna feel a sense of embarrassment</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;ll get you off your fucking ass.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really, really big tip I have to give yourself an extra little kick in the</p>
<p>ass, but it&rsquo;s a way to put things in perspective.</p>
<p>Like that will snap you out of whatever you&rsquo;re thinking that is like encouraging you against</p>
<p>taking action.</p>
<p>That shit will just get you right.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>Okay, so next thing we&rsquo;re talking about is be efficient, bitch.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re going to do something that you don&rsquo;t want to do, stack as much shit on</p>
<p>top of it that you can just get it over with.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t prolong the suffering.</p>
<p>Be efficient.</p>
<p>Make it quick.</p>
<p>Get it done.</p>
<p>Get it over with.</p>
<p>So something that I do is I listen to audio books on the way to the gym or I&rsquo;ll listen</p>
<p>to like a YouTube video while I&rsquo;m cooking or like prepping my meal.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to fucking be prepping my fucking meal right now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be driving to the fucking gym right now.</p>
<p>So some days I have to put on music to like actually pump myself up to go, but other days</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m just like, whatever, I&rsquo;ll just put on the fucking little audio book, like I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>put it on and I&rsquo;ll just knock two birds out with one stone and I&rsquo;ll just be efficient</p>
<p>and get the shit done.</p>
<p>But especially when I&rsquo;m cooking, like I&rsquo;ll just put on the course, I&rsquo;m like, okay, as</p>
<p>soon as I get done cooking, when I sit down to eat, I&rsquo;m free to watch whatever I want.</p>
<p>So I love to watch a YouTube.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll like let myself watch whatever I want on YouTube.</p>
<p>But while I&rsquo;m cooking, I listened to the informational shit that I need to know for my certification</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m trying to get, or I&rsquo;ll just watch some shit that I&rsquo;m trying to learn about business</p>
<p>while I cook and then I enjoy myself while I eat.</p>
<p>Like just stack shit on whatever you can and be efficient.</p>
<p>So I know I talk about audio books and all, but like I&rsquo;ve noticed audio books are slowing</p>
<p>me the fuck down.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ve really been pissing me off because it&rsquo;s like everybody&rsquo;s book nowadays.</p>
<p>The first fucking like the introduction part, the first like 20 minutes is them talking</p>
<p>about some stupid ass, irrelevant ass shit.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re thanking people that are not fucking relevant to anything going on.</p>
<p>And then the first two chapters of the book is them telling you how they&rsquo;re about to change</p>
<p>your life and how, what they&rsquo;re about to tell you is going to improve everything.</p>
<p>Motherfucker just tell it to me, cut those fucking three chapters out of your book where</p>
<p>you tell me how my life&rsquo;s going to change and just fucking give me what I need to make</p>
<p>it change.</p>
<p>You know, like just fucking hit me with the value, give me what I need to know.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve noticed since I&rsquo;ve read so many fucking books, it gets repetitive.</p>
<p>It gets the same shit looking at the table of contents and being able to skim through</p>
<p>a physical book really quick is a lot more efficient for me than listening to a full</p>
<p>audio book because motherfuckers just fill up with words.</p>
<p>Like they just be using so much filler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Like it makes me actually angry.</p>
<p>Like I get pissed off listening to audio books.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, shut your goddamn mouth.</p>
<p>Tell me something important or shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my little tip on that with being efficient with reading is like skim a table</p>
<p>of contents, see what you need to know and then go read about it.</p>
<p>Like read what you want and then skim it.</p>
<p>Like fuck listening to a whole book at this point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got so much knowledge that I&rsquo;m not in the building phase anymore of like building</p>
<p>the foundation of like what I need to know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like now I just need to fill in the gaps and like perfect the things that I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>much about.</p>
<p>But also with being efficient is look at your list of all the shit that you need to do and</p>
<p>look at what is the first one or the first few that are going to have the biggest impact.</p>
<p>What is the shit that I need to do first?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s directly going to get me to where I need to go?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get off track with the other shit that you need to do.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s going to be a bunch that you need to do, but pick the ones that are like</p>
<p>priority and the ones that will make the most impact immediately and then do those.</p>
<p>Because I have spent my fair share of time doing shit that&rsquo;s not fucking relevant.</p>
<p>Like I have this giant list of things to do and I just pick one and start.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Pick the ones that are going to be the most impactful and it&rsquo;s going to allow you to be</p>
<p>the most efficient.</p>
<p>Let me just save you from that fucking headache because there&rsquo;s nothing worse than like checking</p>
<p>off a bunch of shit on your to do list and nothing was actually like important.</p>
<p>Like it was like cute things to get done, but there&rsquo;s other things that needed to be</p>
<p>done first or like other things that were time sensitive.</p>
<p>Okay, so my next tip is make the shit fun.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s so stupid and everybody says that dumb ass shit, but it&rsquo;s really so true.</p>
<p>Put on some fucking music, have a blast, like make it fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to suck.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like I said, water&rsquo;s going to be cold, but you can put on a good ass song while you jump</p>
<p>in the water.</p>
<p>You can fucking make sure you look cute.</p>
<p>You can like get a cute life jacket.</p>
<p>Like bitch, there&rsquo;s a way to make it better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a way to make your suffering better.</p>
<p>So do it.</p>
<p>I use the word suffering just to be dramatic, but if there&rsquo;s a way to make your struggle</p>
<p>and your suffering easier or better or not seem as bad, fucking do it.</p>
<p>Like just do what you can to make it a little more enjoyable, even if it&rsquo;s just as small</p>
<p>as putting on a song.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like in the morning, if you&rsquo;re like, I want to start waking up at a certain time, wake</p>
<p>up and then put on a fucking song and dance your little ass off.</p>
<p>You ain&rsquo;t even got to dance.</p>
<p>You can literally, you have no idea how many days I&rsquo;m standing there in my bathroom mirror,</p>
<p>brushing my teeth, eyes closed, can&rsquo;t even fucking open them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so goddamn tired.</p>
<p>But I got on like ducky ducky in the background.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like trying to make myself want to shake my ass, but like you just got to put shit</p>
<p>on to like get you going and eventually it&rsquo;ll start making you want to like get moving.</p>
<p>But just try and make it fun the best you can make things an activity, make them fun.</p>
<p>Because my friend Carrie also told me the way that you practice feeling is the way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to feel when you get to what you want.</p>
<p>So if your whole process getting to where you want to go is fucking shit and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to make it fun, you don&rsquo;t know how to be optimistic, you don&rsquo;t know how to make</p>
<p>it better for yourself and seem less bad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly how it&rsquo;s going to feel once you get to where you want.</p>
<p>And trust me, I can vouch for that.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve started achieving some things and I&rsquo;m getting some success, I&rsquo;m like, hell</p>
<p>yeah.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the truest shit because how I&rsquo;ve practiced feeling is how I feel now.</p>
<p>I just have what I wanted.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m still the same level of like, stressed out, but like I&rsquo;m sharing the</p>
<p>things I learned as I learned them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the main one.</p>
<p>So do your best to make it a fun process for yourself so that it&rsquo;s a fun destination.</p>
<p>Okay, so now let&rsquo;s talk about the sudden sense of fuck it all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do it no more.</p>
<p>I have that at least once to twice a week.</p>
<p>And the first thing I always ask myself, remember when I said kind of like a toddler?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d be behaving like I like a worksheet.</p>
<p>And when I get tired or hungry, I get fussy and I&rsquo;m like, fuck all this shit.</p>
<p>So whenever I have the sudden sense of like, fuck it all, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just act on that.</p>
<p>Like, okay, I check in with myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, all right, are you tired?</p>
<p>Do you need a nap?</p>
<p>Are you hungry?</p>
<p>Do you need a snack?</p>
<p>Are you?</p>
<p>Why do I fucking sound like cat in the hat?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>But seriously, check in with yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, okay, am I looking at all of this right now?</p>
<p>Like fuck this shit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it anymore because I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>Or is it because I&rsquo;m hungry?</p>
<p>Like, do I need to take a minute?</p>
<p>Do I need to take a little break?</p>
<p>Do I need to take a little nap?</p>
<p>Do I need to take a little breather?</p>
<p>Like check in first.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about the moments where you&rsquo;re just like, oh, this sucks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the moments where you&rsquo;re literally like, fuck this shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like mad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m not doing this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m over.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care anymore.</p>
<p>If you hit that wall, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m saying, check in with yourself.</p>
<p>See what could be contributing to that.</p>
<p>And for me, when I&rsquo;m fucking tired, bitch, that&rsquo;s how I behave.</p>
<p>I get fussy.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t want to fucking do nothing anymore.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m over it.</p>
<p>Fuck you.</p>
<p>I literally just want to throw my hands up, but I&rsquo;ll take a little nap.</p>
<p>And then I wake up and I&rsquo;m like, all right, let&rsquo;s do this shit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s rock this bitch.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll keep going forward.</p>
<p>But my biggest tip for this, definitely check if you&rsquo;re tired or hungry.</p>
<p>A lot of the times when I want to just say, fuck it, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m overwhelmed and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t know the next steps to take or I&rsquo;ll get overwhelmed or I&rsquo;ll feel</p>
<p>just like, Oh, like, fuck it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m over it.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t even fucking want it anymore.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So in those moments, get very clear on what you need to do next, how your actions are</p>
<p>actually getting you where you want to go or getting you closer to it.</p>
<p>You need to be very objective and matter of fact, if like this is getting me here, you</p>
<p>need reassurance.</p>
<p>You need comfort.</p>
<p>You need all these things for yourself.</p>
<p>You might need a little redirection.</p>
<p>You might need to change what you&rsquo;ve been doing a little bit, like tweak it.</p>
<p>Like if you find the new and more efficient way of getting to where you want to go, hop</p>
<p>to it and then start being more efficient and get your fucking shit done.</p>
<p>But just because you have this sudden sense of fuck it all, I&rsquo;m over it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t play into it.</p>
<p>Observe your feeling very much.</p>
<p>Fuck it.</p>
<p>And then get logical about the situation.</p>
<p>Like right now you&rsquo;re feeling like fuck it, but yesterday you were feeling like, fuck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>So just be logical and hear me telling you this anytime you&rsquo;re thinking about giving</p>
<p>up or throwing them a towel or before you say, I don&rsquo;t care anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>Be logical.</p>
<p>First, you might be onto it.</p>
<p>Like you might actually not want it anymore because you&rsquo;ve experienced some part of it</p>
<p>or whatever it is.</p>
<p>You might just realize you don&rsquo;t actually want it, but do not act off the first time</p>
<p>you feel that you give it three days.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>
<p>Keep consistent with what you said you were going to do for three days.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re still just like overwhelmingly like fuck it, hopeless, tired, exhausted,</p>
<p>like have no energy, have no intrinsic motivation, just literally feel like you&rsquo;d rather fucking</p>
<p>slit your wrists in the bathtub than move forward.</p>
<p>But like for real, not like how I just be dramatic and be saying that, like if you actually</p>
<p>are feeling like that, then go into it.</p>
<p>Maybe take a minute, take a break from what you&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>See what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Check in with yourself.</p>
<p>Get very clear of like, do I actually not want this anymore?</p>
<p>And a good way to find out if that&rsquo;s the truth, like, okay, what has this made me realize</p>
<p>I want instead?</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s a new thing, then go for that.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t hop too quick.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t change course too fucking fast.</p>
<p>Give it a couple days.</p>
<p>Keep consistent with what you said.</p>
<p>And then like I said, check in with yourself and redirect if you need to.</p>
<p>But most of the times you&rsquo;re probably just like me and you&rsquo;re fussy because you&rsquo;re hungry</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re tired.</p>
<p>So fucking cool it.</p>
<p>Check yourself and give it a couple days.</p>
<p>Okay, so my last tip is you just got to toughen the fuck up, babe.</p>
<p>Like you just got to get your shit together and you got to do the shit you know you need</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>Like I said, the water&rsquo;s going to be cold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to suck, but fucking grab your nipples and jump in.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s going to be fucking cold, bitch.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s going to suck, but just jump.</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>
<p>Do what you need to do.</p>
<p>What you want is right there in front of you in the water.</p>
<p>You just got to get into the cold ass water.</p>
<p>You just have to do the shit that you might not want to do right now, but it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>get you where you want to go.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I learned very early on, I think I was like 14.</p>
<p>It was when I started my whole fitness journey kind of was I was 14 and I was wanting to</p>
<p>lose weight and I was like, okay, well, time is going to go by anyways.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m going to be 15 so I could be 15 and be in better shape.</p>
<p>But like being 15 is going to come regardless.</p>
<p>So yeah, it sucks that I have to fucking eat a certain way and I can&rsquo;t be doing what everybody</p>
<p>else is doing and I have to go work out.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t have a fast metabolism.</p>
<p>Like always other lucky little motherfuckers.</p>
<p>Like I actually have to train and like eat clean.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, time is going to go on regardless.</p>
<p>So I was just like, fuck it.</p>
<p>Like do it now so that when you are 15 you look better and your goal is never going to</p>
<p>go away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of how far you&rsquo;re going to push it off.</p>
<p>So just fucking do it because you in a month from now will look back and be like, oh, thank</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>I thank God I did that shit.</p>
<p>But if a month goes by after you hear this right now and you still didn&rsquo;t make the changes</p>
<p>you know you need to make, you&rsquo;re going to be like, fuck, you&rsquo;re going to wish you just</p>
<p>did because you&rsquo;d be a month ahead of where you are if you didn&rsquo;t start.</p>
<p>But my other part where I need to like get under your ass is it&rsquo;s not respectable to</p>
<p>not do what you know you need to do.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not cute to not have self-control.</p>
<p>Like you have to learn how to get yourself to fuck up.</p>
<p>Like you have to be respectable.</p>
<p>Like seriously, it&rsquo;s not cute to go back on what you said you were going to do.</p>
<p>Like when you make a promise to yourself, fucking keep it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t betray yourself like everybody else has betrayed you.</p>
<p>You fucking have your own back.</p>
<p>When you tell yourself you&rsquo;re going to do something, you be there for yourself.</p>
<p>The part of you that wants what you&rsquo;re trying to work toward, don&rsquo;t fucking abandon them.</p>
<p>Show them that you&rsquo;re going to take them into consideration and do what it is that they</p>
<p>want you to do.</p>
<p>Do what they need you to do.</p>
<p>Get the fuck up and get your shit done.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fucking hot when someone is self-controlled, self-disciplined, and they will do what they</p>
<p>need to do.</p>
<p>Like when someone is respectable, oh my God.</p>
<p>Like respect is more important than anything.</p>
<p>You could be ugly, but if I respect you, I want to fuck you.</p>
<p>And you can also be hot, but if you&rsquo;re not respectable, I don&rsquo;t want to fuck you.</p>
<p>My dick is not impressed.</p>
<p>But the last little thing I want to make you aware of is you will never achieve anything</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t find a way to at least be consistent.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re dooming yourself to never actually getting what you want.</p>
<p>And a big thing about creating the life that you want and manifesting things.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to do a whole episode on manifestation because oh my God, we got some</p>
<p>things to clear up with that.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t put things in the hands of some higher fucking power.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>I know everybody teaches you the opposite of that.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m going to say is if you want something, make a plan for how you can do it.</p>
<p>Look at your actions that you can choose to take every single day and create a plan off</p>
<p>of that.</p>
<p>Because if you do not base what you&rsquo;re trying to do off of your actions and what you can</p>
<p>do, you&rsquo;re dooming yourself to a life of powerlessness.</p>
<p>If you never see how you can create something that you want, you&rsquo;re going to live your whole</p>
<p>life thinking you just have to ask for things and you&rsquo;re at the mercy of something to give</p>
<p>it to you or at the mercy of things just lining up for you or not lining up.</p>
<p>You have to line them up, babe.</p>
<p>And I want to give you the reassurance that you absolutely can.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got what it fucking takes.</p>
<p>And you found this podcast for a reason.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ve yelled at you enough.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all with love.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m just trying to look out for you guys and share what I&rsquo;ve learned along this</p>
<p>journey because it&rsquo;s been hell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally been fucking hell.</p>
<p>Like this has sucked.</p>
<p>But I do have some tricks up my sleeve now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting here shirtless, but I do have tricks up my sleeve and I just shared them</p>
<p>all.</p>
<p>I hope you take something away from this episode.</p>
