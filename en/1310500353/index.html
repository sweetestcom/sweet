    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Bhaskar Sankara.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a democratic socialist, a political writer,</p>
<p>founding editor of Jacobin, president of The Nation,</p>
<p>former vice chair of the Democratic Socialists of America,</p>
<p>and the author of The Socialist Manifesto,</p>
<p>The Case for Radical Politics</p>
<p>in an Era of Extreme Inequality.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that this conversation</p>
<p>with Bhaskar Sankara,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a brilliant socialist writer and philosopher,</p>
<p>represents what I hope to do with this podcast.</p>
<p>I hope to talk to the left and the right,</p>
<p>to the far left and the far right,</p>
<p>always with the goal of presenting and understanding</p>
<p>both the strongest interpretation of their ideas</p>
<p>and valuable thought-provoking arguments</p>
<p>against those ideas.</p>
<p>Also, I hope to understand the human being</p>
<p>behind the ideas.</p>
<p>I trust in your intelligence as the listener</p>
<p>to use the ideas you hear to help you learn,</p>
<p>to think, to empathize, and to make up your own mind.</p>
<p>I will often fall short in pushing back too hard</p>
<p>or not pushing back enough,</p>
<p>of not bringing up topics I should have,</p>
<p>of talking too much, of interrupting too much,</p>
<p>or maybe sometimes, in the rare cases, not enough,</p>
<p>of being too silly on a serious topic</p>
<p>or being too serious on a silly topic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to do my best,</p>
<p>and I will keep working my ass off to improve.</p>
<p>In this way, I hope to talk to prominent figures</p>
<p>in the political space, even controversial ones,</p>
<p>on both the left and the right.</p>
<p>For example, I hope to talk to Donald Trump</p>
<p>and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,</p>
<p>to Ron DeSantis and Barack Obama,</p>
<p>and of course, many others across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>I sometimes hear accusations about me being controlled</p>
<p>in some way by a government or an intelligence agency</p>
<p>like CIA, FSB, Mossad,</p>
<p>or perhaps that I&rsquo;m controlled in some way</p>
<p>by the very human desire for money, fame, power, access.</p>
<p>All I have is my silly little words,</p>
<p>but let me give them to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not and will never be controlled by anyone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in this world that can break me</p>
<p>and force me to sacrifice my integrity.</p>
<p>People call me naive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not naive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic.</p>
<p>And optimism isn&rsquo;t a passive state of being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a constant battle against the world</p>
<p>that wants to pull you into a downward spiral of cynicism.</p>
<p>To me, optimism is freedom,</p>
<p>freedom to think, to act, to build, to help,</p>
<p>at times in the face of impossible odds.</p>
<p>As I often do, please allow me to read a few lines</p>
<p>from the poem, If, by Roger Kipling.</p>
<p>If you can keep your head when all about you</p>
<p>are losing theirs and blaming it on you.</p>
<p>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</p>
<p>but make allowance for their doubting too.</p>
<p>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting</p>
<p>or being lied about, don&rsquo;t deal in lies</p>
<p>or being hated, don&rsquo;t give way to hating.</p>
<p>And yet don&rsquo;t look too good or talk too wise.</p>
<p>Even this very poem is mocking</p>
<p>my over romantic ridiculousness as I read it.</p>
<p>The meta irony is not lost on me, my friends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a silly little kid,</p>
<p>trying to do a bit of good in this world.</p>
<p>Thank you for having my back through all of it,</p>
<p>all of my mistakes.</p>
<p>Thank you for the love.</p>
<p>And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got House of Macadamias for snacks,</p>
<p>Linode for Linux systems,</p>
<p>Onnit for supplements,</p>
<p>Insight Tracker for biomonitoring</p>
<p>and ExpressVPN for security and privacy.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now onto the full ad reads,</p>
<p>never any ads in the middle, I hate those.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them, please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by a relatively new</p>
<p>and a absolutely, it&rsquo;s not even relative,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolutely objectively delicious sponsor,</p>
<p>House of Macadamias.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a company that ships delicious,</p>
<p>high quality and healthy macadamia nuts</p>
<p>directly to your door</p>
<p>and all kinds of snacks based on macadamia nuts.</p>
<p>The first shipment they sent me</p>
<p>was just the source of a lot of happiness for me.</p>
<p>I was going through some tough times in my life.</p>
<p>Recently, there&rsquo;s been a lot of ups and downs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a wild ride, it&rsquo;s been a wild ride.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about sitting in that couch I have,</p>
<p>which I got so I can feel like an adult</p>
<p>and contemplating the ups and downs of life</p>
<p>and just letting my mind become still,</p>
<p>emptied of thought,</p>
<p>and then just slowly with a stupid smile on my face,</p>
<p>consume macadamia snacks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of sexual innuendos I can do here, by the way.</p>
<p>If you doubt my ability to do sexual innuendos,</p>
<p>how dare you?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna keep it respectful</p>
<p>and say that it&rsquo;s 30% less carbs than almonds.</p>
<p>Oh, man, I don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve been always criticized in my life.</p>
<p>One of the harshest criticisms throughout my life</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t know how to pronounce almonds.</p>
<p>Is it almonds, almonds, almonds, almonds?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almonds, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s almonds.</p>
<p>Anyway, what matters is the snacks are delicious.</p>
<p>And actually, as a sponsor, they&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re with us for the long haul,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just been so kind and respectful,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just a big fan of theirs.</p>
<p>So anything you could do to support them, I would love it.</p>
<p>It just means a lot to me when there&rsquo;s great companies</p>
<p>doing great stuff and just being great people.</p>
<p>I mean, forget all the products and all of that.</p>
<p>Just, I love it.</p>
<p>So support them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really good people.</p>
<p>Anyway, speaking of really good people</p>
<p>and a really good company</p>
<p>that you should definitely support is Linode.</p>
<p>And this episode is brought to you by it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Linux Virtual Machines.</p>
<p>I use it a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an awesome computer infrastructure</p>
<p>that lets you develop, deploy, and scale</p>
<p>what applications you build faster and easier.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing better than Linux.</p>
<p>And here, you don&rsquo;t have to have Linux in your machine.</p>
<p>You can have it in the cloud,</p>
<p>and you can have it not just a little baby machine.</p>
<p>You can scale.</p>
<p>You can launch a giant machine.</p>
<p>You can launch many machines.</p>
<p>By the way, they do have really good customer service,</p>
<p>24-7, 365, but that&rsquo;s not what matters.</p>
<p>What matters is Linux is awesome.</p>
<p>Did I say that?</p>
<p>Linus Torvald is definitely somebody you need to talk to.</p>
<p>Somebody posted on Reddit,</p>
<p>why have you not talked to Linus Torvald yet?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I know exactly how to reach him,</p>
<p>which sounds kind of funny.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a difficult person to get to</p>
<p>to do a long-form interview.</p>
<p>I think his source of happiness is in doing the work,</p>
<p>in serving the Linux community,</p>
<p>just doing the low-level kernel development</p>
<p>and managing the community and all that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much he enjoys conversation</p>
<p>or educating or inspiring others</p>
<p>about the work going on in Linux.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>because I think the world,</p>
<p>I mean, so many important things in the world run on Linux,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know why we don&rsquo;t always celebrate that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s one of the things I really love doing</p>
<p>with this podcast is just celebrating amazing people,</p>
<p>using technology or using whatever skill they have</p>
<p>to try to build a better world.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what Linus is doing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what people working on Linux,</p>
<p>all through the stacks,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the different distributions,</p>
<p>the different packages and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the open-source movement in general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just beautiful to see.</p>
<p>All the stuff you see on GitHub.</p>
<p>It warms my heart to see all these brilliant engineers</p>
<p>just building stuff, small stuff and big stuff.</p>
<p>And many of it helps make the world a better place.</p>
<p>It really, I believe, and honestly does.</p>

<p>This episode is brought to you by Onnit,</p>
<p>a nutrition supplement and fitness company.</p>
<p>They make AlphaBrain, a nootropic</p>
<p>that helps support memory, mental speed, and focus.</p>
<p>I sometimes take AlphaBrain</p>
<p>if I know I have a very difficult design or programming task</p>
<p>at hand, it&rsquo;s gonna take several hours of just focused work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not quite feeling it.</p>
<p>So if I know there&rsquo;s a deep work session</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna involve some mental blocks,</p>
<p>mental struggle, where it&rsquo;s gonna be dead ends and so on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take an AlphaBrain to help me out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been trying to adjust ways</p>
<p>in which I slice my day.</p>
<p>I really do find that I&rsquo;m exceptionally productive</p>
<p>and mentally sharp and focused in the morning</p>
<p>for several hours.</p>
<p>So two, three, four, five, six, seven hours in the morning.</p>
<p>As long as it&rsquo;s uninterrupted,</p>
<p>as long as I don&rsquo;t talk or see other human beings,</p>
<p>or see is okay, see and smile,</p>
<p>like the warmth of humanity is great.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about talking that really drains me,</p>
<p>especially in the morning.</p>
<p>And then in the evening, the same.</p>
<p>I just am exceptionally productive</p>
<p>and can really focus for long periods of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that afternoon time that I think is best</p>
<p>for more like exercise and naps and more relaxing</p>
<p>or like tasks that don&rsquo;t require much brain power.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s kind of funny how each of us</p>
<p>probably have our own little optimization problem</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to solve about what makes us feel good,</p>
<p>what enables us to interact with other human beings</p>
<p>in our lives that we love and make them feel good</p>
<p>and just be a productive member of society,</p>
<p>reach for the stars, be the best version of yourself,</p>
<p>but also just enjoy it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a weird optimization problem</p>
<p>that involves nutrition, that involves exercise.</p>
<p>And I think in part, at least at some point in your life,</p>
<p>it involves a kind of strict analysis of your schedule,</p>
<p>of how you spend the minutes in your day.</p>
<p>And I think part of that process is to then let it go.</p>
<p>Similar with diet, you can have a strict diet</p>
<p>once you understand the nature of calories</p>
<p>and nutrition and vitamins and so on,</p>
<p>that you can let go of that</p>
<p>and have an instinctual understanding of food</p>
<p>and then you can start to really enjoy food.</p>

<p>a service I use to track biological data</p>
<p>that comes from my body and gives me suggestions</p>
<p>about what I should do in my life.</p>
<p>Now, those suggestions are basic lifestyle decisions</p>
<p>and diet decisions, but I can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>until we have something like Brain-Computer Interface</p>
<p>that enables you to make career decisions,</p>
<p>dating decisions, all kinds of decisions.</p>
<p>Of course, not forced, I&rsquo;m just giving you</p>
<p>like a clippy that pops up and says,</p>
<p>have you considered these red flags</p>
<p>about this person that you&rsquo;re talking to?</p>
<p>Or, hey, that interesting person deserves another look.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m joking, of course,</p>
<p>because I think that level of recommendation</p>
<p>is difficult to achieve, but the point is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much data coming from your human body</p>
<p>that I think medicine and just, in general,</p>
<p>recommendation should be based, at least in part,</p>
<p>on that data versus looking at generic population data</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s good for you in terms of diet</p>
<p>and exercise and sleep and all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>a good VPN should be your first layer of protection.</p>

<p>Android is very intuitive to use.</p>
<p>It does one thing and it does it extremely well,</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Bhaskar Sankara.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a big, broad question.</p>
<p>What is socialism?</p>
<p>How do you like to define it?</p>
<p>How do you like to think about it?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s so many socialists out there,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t seem to agree about anything.</p>
<p>So my definition, I&rsquo;m sure, is really just my definition,</p>
<p>but I think at the minimum,</p>
<p>socialism is about making sure</p>
<p>that the core necessities of life,</p>
<p>food, housing, education, and so on,</p>
<p>are guaranteed to everyone just by virtue of being born</p>
<p>so that those people can reach their potential.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a minimum requirement of socialism.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I think socialism,</p>
<p>especially democratic socialism,</p>
<p>the type of socialism that I believe in,</p>
<p>is about taking democracy</p>
<p>from just the political democratic realm</p>
<p>and extending it into economic and social spheres as well.</p>
<p>So if we think that democracy is a good thing,</p>
<p>why do we allow our workplaces</p>
<p>to be run in autocratic ways?</p>
<p>So economic, political, social,</p>
<p>in all those realms, the ideas,</p>
<p>the philosophical ideas apply.</p>
<p>Like what are, if you can put words to it,</p>
<p>what are some philosophical ideas about human beings</p>
<p>that are at the core of this?</p>
<p>I think at the core,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the idea that we have intrinsic value.</p>
<p>We are individuals that have unequal talents, of course.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re individuals that want different things.</p>
<p>But this unique individualness</p>
<p>can only truly come to light in a society</p>
<p>in which there are certain collective or social guarantees.</p>
<p>So we could think, just like Stephen Jay Gould,</p>
<p>the scientist and socialist used to say,</p>
<p>about how many thousands of potential Einsteins</p>
<p>or Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s that died in sweatshops</p>
<p>and on plantations and never got the chance</p>
<p>to cultivate what was unique and human about themselves</p>
<p>and also never got a chance to have families</p>
<p>and impart what was special and important to them</p>
<p>to future generations and to posterity.</p>
<p>My own grandmother was born in Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
<p>She was illiterate till her dying days.</p>
<p>She, in East Orange, New Jersey,</p>
<p>she never had the chance to write down</p>
<p>her memories of her life in Trinidad as a young woman</p>
<p>and what it meant.</p>
<p>She, of course, had lots of children.</p>
<p>She was able to impart some stories</p>
<p>to her children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>But I often think about what someone</p>
<p>with her wit and intelligence could have done</p>
<p>with a little bit more support.</p>
<p>But if all human beings have intrinsic value,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to be an Einstein</p>
<p>for the application of some of the ideas</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Is there a tension or a trade-off</p>
<p>between our human civilization, our society,</p>
<p>helping the unlucky versus rewarding</p>
<p>the skillful and the hardworking?</p>
<p>I think you could do both.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a balance between the two.</p>
<p>I think you could reward people who make innovations</p>
<p>and who improve lives for everyone</p>
<p>through their innovations by giving them,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, even more consumption,</p>
<p>even that level of inequality while still making sure</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s not people in poverty and suffering</p>
<p>and while making sure that, hey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna give these people who want to work</p>
<p>that extra 10 hours or 20 hours</p>
<p>or want to apply their hard work some extra benefits,</p>
<p>but that these benefits would be not the extreme disparities</p>
<p>that you have today.</p>
<p>So at the core of socialism and maybe democratic socialism</p>
<p>is maybe a reallocation of wealth, reallocation of resources?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s wealth and resources, yes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also power.</p>
<p>And I guess one way to think about this is</p>
<p>some thinkers on the right, like Hayek,</p>
<p>they would say in their most generous moments</p>
<p>talking about socialists and socialism,</p>
<p>they would say socialists want to trade</p>
<p>some of your freedom for equality.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s them trying to just accurately describe</p>
<p>what socialism is trying to do.</p>
<p>The way that I would put it, it&rsquo;s a little bit different.</p>
<p>Socialists are proposing a trade-off,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really a trade-off between freedom and freedom.</p>
<p>And by that, I mean,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you set up a successful business</p>
<p>and you set up a business right here in Austin, Texas,</p>
<p>some sort of firm, it&rsquo;s producing some widget or whatever,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s producing a good that people really want and demand</p>
<p>but you have some competition.</p>
<p>You decide to hire 20, 30 people to help you.</p>
<p>You entered into a free contract with these people</p>
<p>who under capitalism, of course,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not living in feudalism,</p>
<p>have the option to join any other firm,</p>
<p>but they like you and they like this firm</p>
<p>and they like your offer and you&rsquo;re paying them,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say $20 an hour for 40 hours of work per week.</p>
<p>Now, if the government comes along and says,</p>
<p>okay, there&rsquo;s now a new minimum wage,</p>
<p>the minimum wage is $22 an hour.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s a maximum work week, 35 hour work week.</p>
<p>And if you work someone over 35 hours, even if they agree,</p>
<p>you have to pay them time and a half.</p>
<p>Now, that of course is now an abridgment</p>
<p>of your freedom as an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>your freedom to set certain terms of employment</p>
<p>and to engage in a contract with free people.</p>
<p>But now your workers and other workers in the sector,</p>
<p>because if you did it unilaterally,</p>
<p>you just get undercut by your competition.</p>
<p>Now, these people now have a few extra hours a week,</p>
<p>they can do whatever they want with.</p>
<p>They could watch more NFL with it.</p>
<p>They could spend more time with their friends or family</p>
<p>or whatever else.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re still getting paid the same, if not better,</p>
<p>because the wages also went up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really a question often of trade-offs</p>
<p>between whose freedom and autonomy</p>
<p>are you going to prioritize?</p>
<p>The freedom and autonomy of the entrepreneur</p>
<p>or the capitalist in this case,</p>
<p>or the freedom and autonomy of ordinary workers.</p>
<p>Now, you could create a society</p>
<p>that swings so far in the direction</p>
<p>of prioritizing the freedom of one group or one class</p>
<p>or whatever else compared to another</p>
<p>that you end up in some sort of tyranny.</p>
<p>Now, if the state said,</p>
<p>you know, you Lex, you&rsquo;re a capitalist,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t get the right to vote,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re gonna take away your private home</p>
<p>or your ability to do things</p>
<p>that we think are intrinsic human rights.</p>
<p>Now, this would be tyranny.</p>
<p>This would be an abridgment of your rights,</p>
<p>but shaping your ability in the economic sphere</p>
<p>to be an economic actor is, I think,</p>
<p>within the realm and scope of democratic politics.</p>
<p>Yeah, so those are the extremes you&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>And one perspective I would like to take</p>
<p>on socialism versus capitalism is under each system,</p>
<p>the extremes of each systems</p>
<p>and the moderate versions of each system,</p>
<p>how can people take advantage of it?</p>
<p>So it seems like no matter what part of human nature is,</p>
<p>whatever the rules, whatever the framework,</p>
<p>whatever the system,</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s gonna take advantage of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of pragmatic look at it.</p>
<p>In practice, what actually happens?</p>
<p>Also, the incentives and the human behavior,</p>
<p>what actually happens in practice under these systems?</p>
<p>So if you have a higher and higher minimum wage</p>
<p>and people watch more and more NFL,</p>
<p>how does that change their actual behavior</p>
<p>as a productive member of society?</p>
<p>And actually at the individual level,</p>
<p>as somebody who could be an Einstein</p>
<p>and chooses not to because NFL is so awesome to watch.</p>
<p>So is both how do people,</p>
<p>malicious people that wanna take advantage,</p>
<p>maybe not malicious,</p>
<p>but people that like me are lazy and wanna take advantage</p>
<p>and people that also I think like me,</p>
<p>like I tend to believe about myself that I have potential</p>
<p>and if I let my laziness naturally take over,</p>
<p>which it often does, I won&rsquo;t materialize the potential.</p>
<p>So if you make life too easy for me,</p>
<p>I feel like I will never get anything done.</p>
<p>Me personally, of course,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a giant set of circumstances</p>
<p>of the unlucky and the overburden and so on.</p>
<p>Okay, so how can people take advantage of each system,</p>
<p>socialism, capitalism?</p>
<p>So for one thing,</p>
<p>people are going to take advantage of systems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna find loopholes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna find ways around,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna find ways to at times dominate</p>
<p>and coerce others even in systems meant</p>
<p>to get rid of domination and coercion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we need to design our systems</p>
<p>in such a way that it eliminates</p>
<p>as many of these things as possible.</p>
<p>And also that&rsquo;s why we need democracy, we need freedom.</p>
<p>So in a Soviet system, for instance,</p>
<p>you had the rise of this authoritarian bureaucracy</p>
<p>that dominated and coerced others in the name of socialism.</p>
<p>Now that system desperately could have used</p>
<p>some political democracy and some checks</p>
<p>on what people were doing</p>
<p>and some ability to reverse their power, right?</p>
<p>And as soon as, of course,</p>
<p>little elements of democracy was brought to that system,</p>
<p>the system collapsed because there started to be outlets</p>
<p>for dissent and for dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>So I think we can&rsquo;t design a priori a perfect system.</p>
<p>We need to be committed to certain principles</p>
<p>that allow systems to be perfected.</p>
<p>And for me, that&rsquo;s the importance of democracy.</p>
<p>So even a few years ago, not to go on a tangent,</p>
<p>but people were alluding Chinese authoritarianism</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re saying China&rsquo;s building this efficient system,</p>
<p>the state runs so well, there&rsquo;s technocratic excellence,</p>
<p>plus there&rsquo;s just productivity</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just working harder than Americans</p>
<p>and whatever else.</p>
<p>But look at in practice what really happened with COVID,</p>
<p>both the initial suppressing of information</p>
<p>about what was happening in Wuhan and the outbreak</p>
<p>where many ordinary Chinese workers</p>
<p>and doctors and others were trying to get the word out</p>
<p>and they were suppressed by communist party officials</p>
<p>locally in Wuhan, probably with the collusion nationally.</p>
<p>And now with zero COVID policies and whatever else.</p>
<p>So I think that often we find that even though it seems</p>
<p>like these are weak systems</p>
<p>and then democracy makes us less competent technocratically</p>
<p>and otherwise, I think it&rsquo;s kind of a necessity</p>
<p>for systems to grow and evolve,</p>
<p>to have that freedom in civil society.</p>
<p>But as for individuals, now the first part of it is,</p>
<p>yeah, I think people should be free</p>
<p>to make their own choices.</p>
<p>You might have tremendous potential,</p>
<p>but you might choose to spend it in leisure.</p>
<p>And leisure doesn&rsquo;t only mean doing,</p>
<p>sitting around at home, drinking a bunch of beers,</p>
<p>kind of wasting your life away that way.</p>
<p>Leisure might mean spending more time</p>
<p>with your friends and family,</p>
<p>building these sort of relationships</p>
<p>that are gonna maybe not change the world</p>
<p>in some meta sense,</p>
<p>but will change the lives of the people around you</p>
<p>and will change your community for the better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking notes here because for me,</p>
<p>leisure just meant playing a lot of Skyrim.</p>
<p>This whole family relationship thing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to work on that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that&rsquo;s also including leisure.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna have to reconsider my whole life here.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>No, leisure should mean civic activity too, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s that famous book,</p>
<p>the Robert Putnam one, Bowling Alone or whatever,</p>
<p>which described that for now.</p>
<p>I mean, it was born in 1989.</p>
<p>I like video and computer games,</p>
<p>so I definitely do that type of leisure too,</p>
<p>but I found a lot more richness in my life</p>
<p>when in the last decade,</p>
<p>a lot of my leisure has returned</p>
<p>to going to the local bar</p>
<p>for the couple of drinks I have a week</p>
<p>instead of doing it at home alone,</p>
<p>watching TV or something,</p>
<p>because you get that random conversation,</p>
<p>that sense of a place and belonging.</p>
<p>But I guess what&rsquo;s the undercurrent maybe</p>
<p>of your question was,</p>
<p>now, if you have a system with lots of carrots,</p>
<p>but not the whip of,</p>
<p>hey, you might be destitute,</p>
<p>you might be unemployed,</p>
<p>you might not be able to support yourself</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re working a certain amount,</p>
<p>would we still be as productive?</p>
<p>Would we still be able to generate enough value for society?</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>that is quite interesting.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;re living in a society now</p>
<p>with enough abundance</p>
<p>that we could afford more people</p>
<p>deciding to opt out of the system,</p>
<p>out of production,</p>
<p>and that the carrots of staying in,</p>
<p>more money for consumption,</p>
<p>more ability to do cool things,</p>
<p>more just social rewards</p>
<p>that comes from being successful</p>
<p>or from providing would be enough.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s another thing</p>
<p>that would have to be balanced in a system.</p>
<p>So if we were seeing mass unemployment by choice</p>
<p>in a democratic socialist system,</p>
<p>then you might need to reconfigure the incentives.</p>
<p>You might need to encourage people</p>
<p>to go back into production.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s something that, again,</p>
<p>you could do through democracy</p>
<p>and through good governance.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to set the perfect blueprint in motion,</p>
<p>write up a treatise now,</p>
<p>and 50 years from now,</p>
<p>try to follow it like it&rsquo;s scripture.</p>
<p>So by the way,</p>
<p>I do like how you said whip instead of stick</p>
<p>in carrot and stick.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s putting a weight on the scale of which is better.</p>
<p>But yes.</p>
<p>But I would actually argue to push back</p>
<p>that the wealthier we get as a society, as a world,</p>
<p>that the more comfortable the social nets become.</p>
<p>So the less of a whip or a stick they become.</p>
<p>Because one of the negative consequences,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re on welfare, is like,</p>
<p>well, life is not gonna be that great.</p>
<p>But the wealthier we become,</p>
<p>the better the social programs become,</p>
<p>the easier life becomes at the bottom.</p>
<p>And so you might not have this motivation financially</p>
<p>to get out from the bottom.</p>
<p>That said, the pushback on the pushback</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s something about human nature in general,</p>
<p>money aside, that strives for greatness,</p>
<p>that strives to provide a great life,</p>
<p>a great middle-class life for your family.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the motivator to get off from the bottom.</p>
<p>Well, I think a lot of people who are stuck</p>
<p>at the bottom of the labor market today,</p>
<p>one, these are people who are kind of our true philanthropists</p>
<p>because a lot of them are the ones who are working two jobs</p>
<p>and are working 60 plus hours</p>
<p>and are providing in this country,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a bargain for their labor</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so underpaid.</p>
<p>So many of the things that the rest of us use</p>
<p>to enjoy life and consumption or whatever else.</p>
<p>Like I got here from downtown Austin</p>
<p>and I think my Lyft, I did tip,</p>
<p>but I think my Lyft was like eight bucks base</p>
<p>or whatever else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, I think that we are all indebted</p>
<p>to people who are working</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t see it at various stages</p>
<p>of the production process from the workers in China</p>
<p>and Taiwan producing technological things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re recording this on to growers</p>
<p>and workers in agriculture in the U.S.</p>
<p>So I think that one,</p>
<p>working class people are already working,</p>
<p>but as far as getting out from under poverty and desperation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a society that doesn&rsquo;t give people a lot of tools.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t have access to good public schools</p>
<p>from age five until 12, 13,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be really hard to move from generations</p>
<p>of your family being involved in manual labor</p>
<p>to doing other forms of labor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be stuck at a certain part</p>
<p>of our labor market as a result.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have access to decent healthcare</p>
<p>throughout your life,</p>
<p>you might be already preordained to an early grave</p>
<p>by the time that something kicks in,</p>
<p>you really want to change something in your life</p>
<p>in your mid twenties.</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s a combination of agency</p>
<p>and all these other factors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still something,</p>
<p>I think innately human, innately striving</p>
<p>that a lot of people have,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t really give people in our current society</p>
<p>the tools to really be full participants in our society.</p>
<p>We just take for granted, for example,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m from the Northeast,</p>
<p>so I give like excessively Northeast example.</p>
<p>We take for granted that someone from Hartford, Connecticut</p>
<p>is gonna have, your average working class person in Hartford</p>
<p>is gonna have a very different life outcome</p>
<p>than someone born on the same day, the same hour,</p>
<p>in Greenwich, Connecticut.</p>
<p>We take for granted that accidents of birth</p>
<p>are gonna dictate outcomes.</p>
<p>So you mean like, depending on the conditions</p>
<p>of where you grew up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be fundamentally different experience</p>
<p>in terms of education,</p>
<p>in terms of the resources available to you</p>
<p>to allow yourself to flourish.</p>
<p>Yes, a poor city and a rich city,</p>
<p>and Connecticut is great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly, highly underrated.</p>
<p>Both New Yorkers and people from Boston</p>
<p>have a colonial feeling about Connecticut</p>
<p>where we make fun of it and we try to carve it up.</p>
<p>The West belongs to New York, the East to Boston,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m here for Connecticut nationalism.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great place.</p>
<p>Okay, can we actually step back a little bit on definitions?</p>
<p>Because you said that some of the ideas practically</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re playing with is democratic socialism.</p>
<p>We talked about the higher level,</p>
<p>the higher kind of vision of socialism,</p>
<p>the ideals, the philosophical ideas,</p>
<p>but how does it all fit into the big picture historically</p>
<p>of ideas of Marxism, communism, and socialism</p>
<p>as it was defined and experienced</p>
<p>and implemented in the 20th century?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your key differences?</p>
<p>Maybe even just like socialism, communism.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I hate the no true Scotsman</p>
<p>sort of response to this, which is,</p>
<p>oh, that socialism is bad.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t really socialism.</p>
<p>And my socialism is good, so it is socialism.</p>
<p>But I think that socialism and communism</p>
<p>share a common ancestor, which is they both emerged</p>
<p>out of the turmoil and development</p>
<p>of late 19th century capitalism.</p>
<p>And the fact that there was all these workers&rsquo; parties</p>
<p>that were organizing across the capitalist world.</p>
<p>So in Europe, for instance,</p>
<p>you had this mass party called</p>
<p>the German Social Democratic Party,</p>
<p>that became probably the most important,</p>
<p>the most vibrant party in Germany in the 1880s and 1890s,</p>
<p>but they were locked out of power</p>
<p>because Germany at the time was still mostly a Tarkic.</p>
<p>It had a parliamentary democracy,</p>
<p>but it was a very undemocratic democracy.</p>
<p>The Kaiser still ruled.</p>
<p>These movements took root across the capitalist world,</p>
<p>including in Russia and in conditions of illegality.</p>
<p>So it was assumed for many, many years</p>
<p>in the workers&rsquo; movement across Europe</p>
<p>and among socialists of Europe,</p>
<p>they called themselves social Democrats then,</p>
<p>that the revolution would first probably happen in Germany</p>
<p>in this developed, growing hub of industrial capitalism</p>
<p>and not in semi-feudal Russia.</p>
<p>But then World War I came,</p>
<p>the workers&rsquo; movement was split between parties</p>
<p>that decided to either keep their head down</p>
<p>or to implicitly support the war.</p>
<p>And then, you know, support the war for an hour,</p>
<p>keep your heads down, don&rsquo;t get banned, don&rsquo;t get arrested,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll just take power after the war is over.</p>
<p>And those like Russia,</p>
<p>and also in the United States for that matter,</p>
<p>that chose the path of resistance to the war.</p>
<p>And it was the Bolshevik faction of the Russian movement</p>
<p>but Lenin&rsquo;s Bolshevik party that took power in Russia</p>
<p>after a period of turmoil where it didn&rsquo;t seem,</p>
<p>well, was it going to go to the fascist right</p>
<p>or was it going to go to the far left?</p>
<p>There was a period of flux and turmoil in Russia,</p>
<p>but definitely the old regime was not able to stand.</p>
<p>And these Russian social Democrats, these Bolsheviks said,</p>
<p>social democracy has so betrayed the idea of internationalism</p>
<p>and brotherhood and progress it was supposed to stand for</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t call ourselves social Democrats anymore.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go back to this old term that Marx used,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to call ourselves communists.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where official kind of communism</p>
<p>out of Russia emerged.</p>
<p>In other parts of Europe,</p>
<p>parties were actually able to take power,</p>
<p>some in the interwar period,</p>
<p>but most in the post-war period.</p>
<p>And they also came out of this</p>
<p>old social democratic movement.</p>
<p>And these parties mostly just call themselves socialists.</p>
<p>And a lot of them still on paper</p>
<p>wanted to go beyond capitalism,</p>
<p>but in practice, they just managed capitalism better</p>
<p>in the interest of workers.</p>
<p>But they all had the same common ancestor.</p>
<p>And in practice, to me, social democracy</p>
<p>means trying to insert doses of socialism within capitalism,</p>
<p>but maintaining capitalism.</p>
<p>Communism met this attempt to build a socialism</p>
<p>outside of capitalism and often authoritarian ways</p>
<p>in part because of the ideology of these communists,</p>
<p>but in part because of the conditions</p>
<p>in which they inherited.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t inheriting a democracy,</p>
<p>they were inheriting a country that had been ruled</p>
<p>by the czars for centuries.</p>
<p>And with very little condition,</p>
<p>like a very weak working class,</p>
<p>very poor and devastated by war and so on</p>
<p>where authoritarianism kind of lended itself</p>
<p>to those conditions.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s me, then there&rsquo;s democratic socialists.</p>
<p>And the way I would define it is,</p>
<p>we like a lot of what the social democrats accomplished,</p>
<p>but we still believe in going beyond capitalism</p>
<p>and not just building socialism within capitalism,</p>
<p>but we believe in this ultimate vision</p>
<p>of a world after capitalism.</p>
<p>What does that world look like</p>
<p>and how is it different from communism?</p>
<p>Actually, maybe we can linger before we talk about</p>
<p>your vision of democratic socialism.</p>
<p>What was wrong with communism, Stalinism,</p>
<p>implementation of communism in the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>Why did it go wrong?</p>
<p>And in what ways did it not go wrong?</p>
<p>In what ways did it succeed?</p>
<p>Let me start with the second part of that question.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very difficult one to answer</p>
<p>in part because I morally and ethically</p>
<p>am opposed to any form of authoritarianism or dictatorship.</p>
<p>And often when you talk about the successes</p>
<p>of a government or what it did developmentally</p>
<p>that might&rsquo;ve been positive,</p>
<p>we have to abstract ourselves from what we morally believe</p>
<p>and just kind of look at the record, right?</p>
<p>I would say that the Soviet experiment started off</p>
<p>by in Lenin&rsquo;s time as the attempt</p>
<p>to kind of just a holding action.</p>
<p>Hey, we don&rsquo;t really have the conditions</p>
<p>to rule this country.</p>
<p>We have the support of the working class</p>
<p>or most of it.</p>
<p>But the working class is only 3% of the population.</p>
<p>The peasantry is really against us.</p>
<p>A lot of this 3% of the population has died in war</p>
<p>and half of them supported the Mensheviks</p>
<p>and the more moderate socialists anyway.</p>
<p>But the alternative in their minds</p>
<p>was going to be a far right reaction,</p>
<p>some sort of general taking power in a coup</p>
<p>or whatever else, or just them ending up back in prison</p>
<p>because a lot of them were in prison under the czar</p>
<p>or just killed.</p>
<p>So they figured, all right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have a holding action</p>
<p>where we maintain as much of this territory</p>
<p>of the old Russian empire as possible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try to slowly implement changes,</p>
<p>restabilize the economy</p>
<p>through something called a new economic program,</p>
<p>which was kind of a form of social democracy, if you will,</p>
<p>because it allowed market exchange for the peasants</p>
<p>combined with state ownership of industries in the cities.</p>
<p>And for a while, it seemed to be working.</p>
<p>The revolution never came</p>
<p>that they were expecting in Western Europe,</p>
<p>but in Russia itself,</p>
<p>they were able to restabilize things</p>
<p>by the middle or end of the 1920s.</p>
<p>And they were able to build more of a popular base</p>
<p>for some of their policies</p>
<p>because people who had seen the chaos of World War I</p>
<p>and revolution and then civil war</p>
<p>kind of just wanted stability.</p>
<p>And after a decade plus of war,</p>
<p>if you had a government</p>
<p>that was able to give you enough to eat and a job,</p>
<p>that was good enough for them.</p>
<p>Then Stalin came into power</p>
<p>and he wanted to rapidly industrialize.</p>
<p>And his logic was,</p>
<p>the revolution is not gonna come in the West.</p>
<p>We need to build socialism in one country</p>
<p>and we need to catch up with the West.</p>
<p>We need to turn ourselves into industrial powerhouse</p>
<p>as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you got forced collectivization</p>
<p>to try to increase the productivity of Russian agriculture</p>
<p>through state ownership</p>
<p>of previously fragmented agricultural holdings</p>
<p>and through the implementation of mechanization.</p>
<p>So bringing in more machines</p>
<p>to make agriculture more productive,</p>
<p>all under state ownership,</p>
<p>plus more ambitious attempts to build heavy industry</p>
<p>through five-year plans.</p>
<p>Now, I say this kind of coolly,</p>
<p>but we know in practice what that meant.</p>
<p>Forced collectivization was a disaster.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>I think it was built on the faulty premise</p>
<p>that scale always equals more productivity</p>
<p>when in fact, especially in agriculture,</p>
<p>but in any field,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated than that.</p>
<p>And it led to millions of deaths,</p>
<p>it led to a famine,</p>
<p>it led to a host of other problems.</p>
<p>Industrialization in the way that it happened under Stalin</p>
<p>also kind of unbalanced the Soviet economy</p>
<p>to lean too heavy towards heavy industry,</p>
<p>not enough for medium or light industry.</p>
<p>But this did mean,</p>
<p>especially the five-year plan and industrialization,</p>
<p>did manage to put Russia</p>
<p>on a different developmental trajectory.</p>
<p>So by the time the post-war period came,</p>
<p>one, it might&rsquo;ve gave them the ability to survive</p>
<p>the Nazi invasion to begin with,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a complicated question.</p>
<p>And then by the time the post-war period came,</p>
<p>Russia had kind of jumped ahead</p>
<p>of its developmental trajectory</p>
<p>in a way that a lot of other countries didn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>There are a few examples,</p>
<p>like Japan is one that managed to.</p>
<p>If you kind of ran a scenario</p>
<p>where Japan would be in the 1870s, 1880s,</p>
<p>and ran it a hundred times,</p>
<p>the Japan of the post-war period</p>
<p>is kind of one of the best outcomes, right?</p>
<p>And I think that you could say that</p>
<p>about Russian economic development,</p>
<p>its ability to catch up at a certain level to the West.</p>
<p>And then after that, of course, later on,</p>
<p>as economies got more complex,</p>
<p>as they kind of moved beyond regular heavy industry</p>
<p>and as the main stable of the economy,</p>
<p>the Russian economy and its command system</p>
<p>was unable to adapt and cope</p>
<p>and ended up falling back behind the West again</p>
<p>by the 1970s.</p>
<p>So this is a very long story to say</p>
<p>that a lot went wrong in Russia.</p>
<p>The economic picture</p>
<p>is actually a little bit more complicated.</p>
<p>Politically, I think it&rsquo;s just a small party</p>
<p>without much popular support,</p>
<p>but with real popular support in a couple of cities,</p>
<p>but without a lot of popular support empire-wide,</p>
<p>took power and they felt like they couldn&rsquo;t get back power.</p>
<p>And they kept holding on to power</p>
<p>and eventually among their ranks in these conditions,</p>
<p>one of history&rsquo;s great tyrants took power</p>
<p>and was able to justify what he was doing</p>
<p>in the context of the Russian nation and development,</p>
<p>but also all the threats that came from abroad.</p>
<p>The Civil War wasn&rsquo;t just a Civil War,</p>
<p>it was really an invasion</p>
<p>by many imperial powers all around the world as well.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of it was conditions and circumstance.</p>
<p>And I guess the question really is</p>
<p>to what role ideology played?</p>
<p>Was there something within the socialist tradition</p>
<p>that might&rsquo;ve lended itself to authoritarianism?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something we should talk about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really complicated human question.</p>
<p>It does seem that the rhetoric,</p>
<p>the populism of workers unite,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been fucked over for way too long.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stand together.</p>
<p>Somehow that message allows</p>
<p>flawed or evil people to take power.</p>
<p>It seems like the rhetoric, the idea is so good,</p>
<p>maybe the utopian nature of the idea is so good</p>
<p>that it allows a great speaker to take power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like if the mission,</p>
<p>like come with me friends,</p>
<p>beyond the horizon, a great land is waiting for us.</p>
<p>That encourages sort of, yeah,</p>
<p>dictators, authoritarians to take power.</p>
<p>Is there something within the ideology</p>
<p>that allows for that,</p>
<p>for the sort of, for lying to people, essentially?</p>
<p>Well, I might surprise you with my answer</p>
<p>because I would say yes, maybe.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s not just socialism.</p>
<p>Any sort of ideology</p>
<p>that appeals to the collective</p>
<p>and appeals to our long-term destiny,</p>
<p>either as a species or as a nation</p>
<p>or as a class or whatever else,</p>
<p>can lend itself to authoritarianism.</p>
<p>So you can see this in many of the nationalisms</p>
<p>of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Now, some of these nationalisms</p>
<p>use incredibly lofty collective rhetoric,</p>
<p>like in Sweden, the rhetoric of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to create the people&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to make this a country</p>
<p>with dignity for all Swedes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to make this a country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more developed, more free, and so on.</p>
<p>And they managed to build a pretty excellent society,</p>
<p>in my estimation, from that.</p>
<p>In countries like fascist Germany and Italy,</p>
<p>they managed to do horrendous things in Japan</p>
<p>and horrendous things with that.</p>
<p>In the US, with national popular appeals,</p>
<p>FDR was able to unite a nation</p>
<p>to elevate ordinary working class people</p>
<p>into a position where they felt like</p>
<p>they had a real stake in the country.</p>
<p>And I think did great things with the New Deal.</p>
<p>In Russia, of course, this language was used</p>
<p>to trample upon individual rights</p>
<p>and to justify hardship and abuses</p>
<p>of ordinary individual people</p>
<p>in the name of a collective destiny.</p>
<p>A destiny, of course, that was just decided</p>
<p>by the party in power and during the 30s and 40s</p>
<p>by just Stalin himself, really.</p>
<p>Now, I think that that&rsquo;s really the case</p>
<p>for making sure that we have a bedrock</p>
<p>of civil rights and democracy.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, we can debate.</p>
<p>We can debate different national destinies.</p>
<p>We can debate different appeals,</p>
<p>different visions of the world.</p>
<p>But as long as people have a say</p>
<p>in what sacrifices they&rsquo;re being asked to do,</p>
<p>and as long as those sacrifices don&rsquo;t take away</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s fundamentally ours, which is our life,</p>
<p>which is our basic rights.</p>
<p>And voice, our voice.</p>
<p>So this complicated picture, because help me understand,</p>
<p>you mentioned that social democracy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s trying to have social policies</p>
<p>within a capitalist system, in part.</p>
<p>But your vision, your hope for a social democracy</p>
<p>is one that goes beyond that.</p>
<p>How do you give everybody a voice</p>
<p>while not becoming the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>while not becoming where basically people are silenced</p>
<p>either directly through violence</p>
<p>or through the implied threat of violence</p>
<p>and therefore fear?</p>
<p>So I think you need to limit the scope</p>
<p>of where the state is and what the state can do</p>
<p>and how the state functions, first of all.</p>
<p>Now, for me, social democracy was like the equivalent of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give a football analogy.</p>
<p>It was the equivalent of getting to the red zone</p>
<p>and then kicking a field goal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll take the three points,</p>
<p>but you would have rather got a touchdown.</p>
<p>And for me, socialism would be the touchdown.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a separate, different playing field.</p>
<p>Some people would say socialism would be an interception.</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>No, and they would have the right to, again,</p>
<p>to say that and to say we shouldn&rsquo;t go further.</p>
<p>And most coaches would take the safe route, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going against the decision.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll just take it as a point.</p>
<p>But I understand, I understand.</p>
<p>So for you, the goal is full socialism.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll take the three points.</p>
<p>I just want to march down the field.</p>
<p>I want to get within scoring position.</p>
<p>The reason why we should really move from this analogy,</p>
<p>but the reason why I call myself a socialist</p>
<p>is looking through history</p>
<p>and these examples of social democracy,</p>
<p>you saw that they were able to give working class people</p>
<p>lots of rights and income and power in their society.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>capitalists still had the ultimate power,</p>
<p>which is the ability to withhold investment.</p>
<p>So they could say in the late 1960s and early 70s,</p>
<p>listen, I was fine with this arrangement 10 years ago,</p>
<p>but now I feel like I&rsquo;m going to take my money</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to go move to a different country</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m just going to not invest</p>
<p>because my workers are paid too much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still making money,</p>
<p>but I feel like I could be making more.</p>
<p>I need more of an upper hand, right?</p>
<p>So their economic power is then challenging</p>
<p>the democratic mandate of Swedish workers</p>
<p>that were voting for the Social Democratic Party</p>
<p>and were behind this advance.</p>
<p>So to me, what socialism is in part</p>
<p>is taking the means of production, right?</p>
<p>Where this capitalist power is coming from</p>
<p>and making it socially owned</p>
<p>so that ordinary workers can control their workplaces,</p>
<p>can make investment decisions and so on.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean total state ownership of everything</p>
<p>or a planned economy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that makes any sense.</p>
<p>I think that we should live in a society</p>
<p>in which markets are harnessed and regulated and so on.</p>
<p>My main problem is capitalist ownership</p>
<p>in part on normative grounds,</p>
<p>just because I think that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>that we celebrate democracy and all these other spheres,</p>
<p>but we have workplaces that are just treated like tyrannies.</p>
<p>And in part, because I think that ordinary workers</p>
<p>would much prefer a system in which over time</p>
<p>they accrued shares and ownership</p>
<p>where they got, in addition to a base kind of wage,</p>
<p>they got dividends from their firm being successful</p>
<p>and that they figured out how to&hellip;</p>
<p>Large firms, they&rsquo;re not gonna be making</p>
<p>day-to-day decisions by democratic vote, right?</p>
<p>But maybe you would elect representatives,</p>
<p>elected managements once every year or two,</p>
<p>depending on your operating agreement and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of my vision of a socialist society.</p>
<p>And this sounds, I hope, agree or disagree,</p>
<p>like it would not be a crazy leap into year zero, right?</p>
<p>That this could be maybe a way in which we could take</p>
<p>a lot of what&rsquo;s existing in society,</p>
<p>but then just add this on top.</p>
<p>But what it would mean is a society</p>
<p>without a capitalist class.</p>
<p>This class hasn&rsquo;t been&hellip;</p>
<p>Individually, these people haven&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>taken to re-education camps or whatever else,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just no longer in this position.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re now part of the economy in other ways,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ll probably be the first set</p>
<p>of highly competent technocrats and managers and so on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll probably be very well compensated</p>
<p>for their time and expertise and whatever else.</p>
<p>But to me, both the practical end of things,</p>
<p>like taking away this ability to withhold investment</p>
<p>and increasing our ability to democratically</p>
<p>shape investment priorities,</p>
<p>and to continue down the road of social democracy,</p>
<p>and on normative grounds by kind of egalitarian belief</p>
<p>that ordinary people should have more stake</p>
<p>in their lives in the workplace,</p>
<p>leads me beyond social democracy to socialism.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a tricky thing here.</p>
<p>So in Ukraine especially, but in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the kulaks.</p>
<p>The possible trajectory of fighting</p>
<p>for the beautiful message of respecting workers&rsquo; rights</p>
<p>has this dynamic of making an enemy of the capitalist class,</p>
<p>too easily making an enemy of the capitalist class,</p>
<p>with a central leader, populist leader,</p>
<p>that says the rich and the powerful,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking advantage of you.</p>
<p>We need to remove them.</p>
<p>We need to put them in camps, perhaps.</p>
<p>Not said explicitly, until it happens.</p>
<p>It can happen overnight.</p>
<p>But just putting a giant pressure on that capitalist class,</p>
<p>and again, the Stalin-type figure takes hold.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to understand</p>
<p>how the mechanism can prevent that.</p>
<p>And perhaps I&rsquo;ll sort of reveal my bias here,</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ve been reading,</p>
<p>I was gonna say too much, maybe not enough,</p>
<p>but a lot about books like Stalin&rsquo;s War on Ukraine,</p>
<p>and just I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about the 30s and the 40s,</p>
<p>for personal reasons related to my travels in Ukraine</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So I have a little bit of a focus</p>
<p>on the historical implementations of communism currently,</p>
<p>without kind of an updated view</p>
<p>of all the possible future implementations.</p>
<p>So I just wanna lay that out there.</p>
<p>But I worry about the slippery slope</p>
<p>into the authoritarian figure that takes this sexy message,</p>
<p>destroys everyone who&rsquo;s powerful</p>
<p>in the name of the working class,</p>
<p>and then fucks the working class afterwards.</p>
<p>So first of all, I think it&rsquo;s worth remembering</p>
<p>that the socialist movement had different outcomes</p>
<p>across Western Europe and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>And in some of these countries in Western Europe,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t actually democracy before the workers&rsquo; movement</p>
<p>and before the socialist movement.</p>
<p>So the battle in Sweden, for instance,</p>
<p>was about establishing political democracy,</p>
<p>establishing true representation for workers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the parties became popular.</p>
<p>Same thing in Germany, too.</p>
<p>Then it was the Social Democrats</p>
<p>who were able to build political democracy.</p>
<p>Then on top of that, add layers of economic democracy,</p>
<p>social democracy.</p>
<p>The Swedish Social Democrats ruled basically uninterrupted</p>
<p>from the early 1930s until 1976.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of crazy to think about,</p>
<p>but they were just in government.</p>
<p>They were the leading member of government</p>
<p>and then a few different coalition partners would shift.</p>
<p>Sometimes they were with the agrarians,</p>
<p>sometimes they were with the communists briefly,</p>
<p>but they ruled uninterrupted</p>
<p>and they lost an election in 1976 and they just left power.</p>
<p>Then they got back into power in the 80s.</p>
<p>So in other words, they created a democratic system,</p>
<p>of course, with mass support of working class people.</p>
<p>Then they truly honored the system</p>
<p>because when they lost power, they lost power.</p>
<p>They left power.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of cases like that across Europe</p>
<p>and the world and in other countries like Korea</p>
<p>and elsewhere where the workers&rsquo; movements,</p>
<p>the most militant, the most class-centric workers,</p>
<p>South Africa is the same way, created democratic systems.</p>
<p>Now, Russia, I think a lot of what happened</p>
<p>had to do with the fact</p>
<p>that it was never a democratic country.</p>
<p>It was ruled by a party and the party itself</p>
<p>was very easy to shift from a somewhat democratic party</p>
<p>in Lenin&rsquo;s day to an authoritarian one in Russia.</p>
<p>And there was no distinction then</p>
<p>between the party and the state.</p>
<p>So your authoritarian party</p>
<p>then became authoritarian total control</p>
<p>over the entirety of the state.</p>
<p>Now, the fact that the Soviet system</p>
<p>involved total state ownership of production</p>
<p>meant that the authoritarianism of the party state</p>
<p>could go even deeper into the lives of ordinary people</p>
<p>compared to other horrific dictatorships</p>
<p>like Pinochet&rsquo;s Chile and so on,</p>
<p>when maybe you could find some solace just at home</p>
<p>or whatever else.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have the same sort of totalitarian</p>
<p>control of people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>But I would say that socialism itself</p>
<p>is yield different outcomes.</p>
<p>Now, on the question of polarization,</p>
<p>I guess that implies that this polarization,</p>
<p>this distinction is a distinction</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t real in society</p>
<p>and that is kind of being manufactured or generated.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>You mean the capitalist class and the working class?</p>
<p>Yeah. Just to clarify.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So in certain populist distinctions,</p>
<p>the division is basically arbitrary or made up,</p>
<p>the us versus them polarization,</p>
<p>depending who the us and who the them are.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s truly something that&rsquo;s manufactured.</p>
<p>But capitalism itself as a system,</p>
<p>as a system based on class division,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re support or oppose it,</p>
<p>I think we should acknowledge it&rsquo;s based on class division,</p>
<p>that is the thing creating that polarization.</p>
<p>Now, I think what a lot of what socialists try to do</p>
<p>is we try to take bits of working class opposition</p>
<p>to capitalism, to their lives,</p>
<p>to the way they&rsquo;re treated at work and so on.</p>
<p>And yes, we do try to organize on those bases</p>
<p>to help workers take collective action,</p>
<p>to help them organize in political parties</p>
<p>and so on to represent their interests,</p>
<p>economic and otherwise.</p>
<p>But the contradiction exists to begin with.</p>
<p>And if anything, this system,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m proposing, democratic socialism,</p>
<p>would be kind of a resolution of this conflict,</p>
<p>this dilemma, this thing that has always existed</p>
<p>since Chieftain and follower and so on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had class division since the Neolithic Revolution.</p>
<p>You know, I think this is a democratic road</p>
<p>out of that tension and that division of humanity</p>
<p>into people who own and people have nothing to give</p>
<p>but their ability to work.</p>
<p>So that sort of that idea is grounded</p>
<p>in going all the way back to Marx</p>
<p>that all of human history can be told</p>
<p>through the lens of class struggle.</p>
<p>Is there some sense, can you still man the case</p>
<p>that this class difference is over-exaggerated?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a difference,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the difference of the abuser and the abused.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a difference of people that were successful</p>
<p>and people that were less successful.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll play devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>which is that maybe one could argue</p>
<p>that in its purest, earliest stage,</p>
<p>capitalism was based on a stark difference.</p>
<p>But then since then, two things have happened.</p>
<p>One, a bunch of socialists and workers</p>
<p>have organized to guarantee certain rights</p>
<p>for working class people, certain protections.</p>
<p>So in our system now, there are certain safety nets,</p>
<p>less in the US than in other countries,</p>
<p>but in a lot of countries,</p>
<p>there are pretty extensive safety nets.</p>
<p>Even like 40-hour work week, minimum wage,</p>
<p>safety regulations, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And all those things are, in my mind,</p>
<p>doses of socialism within capitalism.</p>
<p>Because what you&rsquo;re doing is you are taking the autonomy</p>
<p>of capitalists to do whatever they want</p>
<p>with the people contracted to them.</p>
<p>And the only thing stopping them is them</p>
<p>potentially being able to go to another employer.</p>
<p>But even then, it&rsquo;s kind of potentially</p>
<p>a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t get more than $2 an hour</p>
<p>from any employer in your market,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to live with it.</p>
<p>So one factor is we have built in those protections.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve taken enough socialism into capitalism</p>
<p>that you could say that at a certain point,</p>
<p>maybe it makes a qualitative difference</p>
<p>and not just a quantitative difference in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>The other thing is over time, we&rsquo;ve gotten wealthier</p>
<p>and more productive as a society.</p>
<p>So maybe at some point, the quantitative difference</p>
<p>of just more and more wealth</p>
<p>means that even if in the abstract,</p>
<p>the division between a worker and a capitalist is real,</p>
<p>if that worker is earning a quarter million dollars a year</p>
<p>and has a good life and only has to clock in</p>
<p>35 hours a week, 30 hours a week,</p>
<p>and has four weeks of vacation,</p>
<p>then isn&rsquo;t it just an abstract or philosophical difference?</p>
<p>So I think you could level those two arguments.</p>
<p>What I would say is that,</p>
<p>one, a lot of these rights that we have fought for</p>
<p>are constantly being eroded and they&rsquo;re under-attacked</p>
<p>in part because the economic power that capitalists have</p>
<p>bleeds into our political democracy as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s constant lobbying</p>
<p>for all sorts of labor market deregulations and so on.</p>
<p>I fundamentally believe that if tomorrow</p>
<p>all those regulations went away,</p>
<p>capitalists would fight to pay people as little as possible</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d be back in 19th century capitalism.</p>
<p>And not because they&rsquo;re bad people.</p>
<p>Because if I&rsquo;m running a firm</p>
<p>and all of a sudden my competition</p>
<p>is able to find a labor pool</p>
<p>and is paying people less than me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be undercut</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll be able to take some of that extra savings</p>
<p>and invest into new technology or whatever else</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll gobble up my market share before long.</p>
<p>And then also beyond that,</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s a normative question here,</p>
<p>which is, now, do we believe that ordinary people</p>
<p>have a capacity to be able to make certain decisions</p>
<p>about their work?</p>
<p>Do we believe they know more about their work</p>
<p>than their bosses?</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s natural at every level,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s no doubt that in workplaces,</p>
<p>workers know how to productively do their task</p>
<p>in ways that their manager might not know.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve all been in workplaces</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve had managers who kind of don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what you do or whatever else.</p>
<p>And I think that collectively, if incentivized,</p>
<p>we could have them, one, instead of hoarding</p>
<p>or that information,</p>
<p>since they&rsquo;re getting a stake in production and so on,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be able to more freely share it</p>
<p>and be able to reshape how their day-to-day work happens.</p>
<p>And also with elected managers,</p>
<p>you kind of take that up the chain,</p>
<p>I think you would have perfectly efficient</p>
<p>market-based firms that could exist without capitalists.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of things to say,</p>
<p>maybe within just very, very low-level question</p>
<p>of if the workers are running the show,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a brutal truth to the fact</p>
<p>that some people are better,</p>
<p>and the workers know this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Steve Jobs A-players,</p>
<p>you want to have all the A-players in the room</p>
<p>because one B-player can poison the pool</p>
<p>because then everybody gets demotivated by,</p>
<p>by the nature of that lack of excellence and competence.</p>
<p>This is just to take sort of a crude</p>
<p>devil&rsquo;s advocate perspective.</p>
<p>Are the workers going to be able to remove</p>
<p>the incompetent from the pool in the name,</p>
<p>in the goal of, towards the mission</p>
<p>of succeeding as a collective?</p>
<p>So I think that any successful model of socialism</p>
<p>that involves the market, you need two things.</p>
<p>One is at the micro level, you need the ability</p>
<p>to fire people and for them to exit firms,</p>
<p>which might be a slower process in cooperative-based firms</p>
<p>than it is in a capitalist firm without a union,</p>
<p>but it would probably akin to the process</p>
<p>that would happen in a capitalist firm,</p>
<p>of which there are many with unions.</p>
<p>So you need that.</p>
<p>And then at the macro level, you need firm failure.</p>
<p>You need to avoid a dilemma that happened</p>
<p>in Soviet-style economies,</p>
<p>which was soft budget constraints</p>
<p>and firms basically not being allowed to fail</p>
<p>because the government was committed to full employment,</p>
<p>the firms employed people.</p>
<p>So even inefficient firms were at the end of the day,</p>
<p>they knew they were going to be propped up by the government</p>
<p>and they would be given all the resources they would need</p>
<p>no matter how inefficiently they were using those resources</p>
<p>to maintain employment.</p>
<p>So I think you need both.</p>
<p>Do you worry about this idea of firing people?</p>
<p>Man, I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the idea.</p>
<p>I hate it, but I also know it&rsquo;s extremely necessary.</p>
<p>So is there something about a collective,</p>
<p>a socialist system that makes firing,</p>
<p>you said it might be slower,</p>
<p>might it become extremely slow, too much friction?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a tension between respecting the rights</p>
<p>of a human being and saying, like, you need to step up,</p>
<p>maybe sort of deposit the carrot,</p>
<p>like you really, like to really encourage fellow workers,</p>
<p>no, when there&rsquo;s a person that&rsquo;s not pulling their side</p>
<p>of the, doing as great of a job as it could be.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t the person that&rsquo;s not doing a great of a job</p>
<p>going to start to manipulate the system</p>
<p>that slows the firing in their self-interest?</p>
<p>Well, I think there would be certain,</p>
<p>so maybe another way to put it is,</p>
<p>think about like if you&rsquo;re a partner at a law firm, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know how law firms work,</p>
<p>so I probably shouldn&rsquo;t use this analogy,</p>
<p>but correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a partner,</p>
<p>you kind of have equity in your law firm</p>
<p>or something beyond your billable hours.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re going to be fired</p>
<p>from your law firm or they&rsquo;re laying off people</p>
<p>or whatever else, they could just get rid of you,</p>
<p>but they would also have to figure out</p>
<p>how to kind of buy you out too after a certain point.</p>
<p>So I think that like in a cooperative firm,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably have a system where you,</p>
<p>after a certain point of working productively,</p>
<p>you probably have a period</p>
<p>where you can get fired really quickly, no matter what.</p>
<p>But once your job security kicks in,</p>
<p>you would be able to, it would be a process.</p>
<p>It would probably be like a day or two process</p>
<p>to figure it out,</p>
<p>or maybe they would have a progressive discipline process,</p>
<p>which is first you have to get a verbal feedback</p>
<p>and then maybe a written performance review,</p>
<p>then you could be fired.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s how it works in a lot of workplaces</p>
<p>with either unions or with just basic job security.</p>
<p>Most countries, that&rsquo;s how it works</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not at will employment in most countries.</p>
<p>So I think that the real tension is if you fire someone,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re condemning them to destitution,</p>
<p>then morally you&rsquo;d really feel something there,</p>
<p>as you should as a human being concerned about other people.</p>
<p>But in a social system</p>
<p>or even basic social democratic system,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be mechanisms to take care of that person.</p>
<p>So one, if a firm is failing for any reason,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting out-compete or whatever else,</p>
<p>those workers would then lend in the hands</p>
<p>just for a little bit of the state, right?</p>
<p>And there could be active labor market policies</p>
<p>to retrain people to go into expanding sectors</p>
<p>or your sector is now obsolete,</p>
<p>but here you have these skills,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be trained and here&rsquo;s some resources</p>
<p>to kind of help you along your training.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a bunch of firms hiring,</p>
<p>so go on your way.</p>
<p>And then also just with an expanded welfare state,</p>
<p>being destitute in certain countries,</p>
<p>being unemployed in certain countries</p>
<p>is easier than in other countries or situations.</p>
<p>So you still can fall back on that mechanism.</p>
<p>And also my vision of market socialism,</p>
<p>a democratic socialism,</p>
<p>there would be an expanded state sector.</p>
<p>Not anything you can imagine,</p>
<p>but the way in which there&rsquo;s more of a state sector</p>
<p>in countries like Norway or Denmark than there is in the US.</p>
<p>So there would be various forms of state employment</p>
<p>and whatever else.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think that the real question is,</p>
<p>should being bad at your job</p>
<p>or getting fired for any reason or getting laid off,</p>
<p>should that be a cause to have you totally lose your shirt?</p>
<p>Or maybe should you just have to rebound?</p>
<p>Maybe you have less money for consumption or whatever else,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be on your way onto bigger and better things</p>
<p>in a few months.</p>
<p>So a strong social net in many ways</p>
<p>make it more efficient to fire people</p>
<p>who are not good at their job</p>
<p>because then they won&rsquo;t be,</p>
<p>that won&rsquo;t actually significantly damage</p>
<p>their quality of life</p>
<p>and they have a chance to find a job</p>
<p>at which they can flourish.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>To step out into the macro,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tension here as well.</p>
<p>So you said that there&rsquo;s an equality between the classes,</p>
<p>the capitalist class and the working class.</p>
<p>And sort of, there&rsquo;s a lot of ways</p>
<p>you can maybe correct me on the numbers,</p>
<p>but you could say that the top 1% of Americans</p>
<p>have more wealth than the bottom 50%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not talking about perhaps capitalist class</p>
<p>and the working class,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good sort of estimate, right?</p>
<p>The flip side of that,</p>
<p>if you just look at countries</p>
<p>that have more economic freedom</p>
<p>versus less economic freedom,</p>
<p>more capitalism versus less capitalism,</p>
<p>their GDP seems to be significantly higher.</p>
<p>And so at the local level,</p>
<p>you might say that there&rsquo;s an inequality,</p>
<p>but if you look historically over decades,</p>
<p>it seems like the more capitalism there is,</p>
<p>the higher the GDP grows,</p>
<p>and therefore the level of the quality of life</p>
<p>and the basic income, the basic wealth,</p>
<p>the average, even including the working class,</p>
<p>goes up over time.</p>
<p>Can you see both sides of this?</p>
<p>So I could definitely accept some of that premise.</p>
<p>One, within capitalism, right,</p>
<p>you want a bigger pie.</p>
<p>And then if you divide up that pie,</p>
<p>even if the bottom 10% or the working class share,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, is less as a percentage,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still more in raw terms.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s better for everyone.</p>
<p>The part that I would dispute</p>
<p>is more economic freedom versus less economic freedom.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s obviously some countries</p>
<p>in which capitalism doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>and maybe economic freedom plays a role.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re in a country like Egypt or India</p>
<p>with a highly, or previously highly bureaucratic system,</p>
<p>so you need to get licenses to do anything,</p>
<p>and you need to run things for the state,</p>
<p>or you need to bribe someone to get an incorporation done</p>
<p>or whatever else,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in case in which I would accept the premise of,</p>
<p>okay, economic freedom to take entrepreneurial risk</p>
<p>to start something new is limited.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of factors in which it&rsquo;s too difficult</p>
<p>to start a firm, and it benefits no one really,</p>
<p>except for whatever bureaucracy might be,</p>
<p>might be taking their 15% cut.</p>
<p>But in general, I think in advanced economies,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really work that way.</p>
<p>So think about it this way.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, pretend like we&rsquo;re back,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to go to Scandinavia again,</p>
<p>but this is a good example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re back in the 1970s</p>
<p>in Scandinavia or whatever else.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a country with extremely powerful unions.</p>
<p>So the unions have a lot of labor rights,</p>
<p>the state has certain high taxation,</p>
<p>certain guarantees on you too,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re a capitalist there.</p>
<p>Now, what would you do if your capitalist competitors</p>
<p>in the US were able to pay workers $10 an hour</p>
<p>and you have to pay them 20?</p>
<p>You would probably,</p>
<p>and assuming you can&rsquo;t just flee or shut down</p>
<p>or whatever else,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably find ways</p>
<p>to use labor-saving technology, right?</p>
<p>That power of the high wages</p>
<p>might encourage you to invest more in technology</p>
<p>and to utilize people&rsquo;s times better</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re more productive at work,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not just like sitting around or whatever else.</p>
<p>So this really happened in practice</p>
<p>in the Scandinavian countries,</p>
<p>in part because it was combined with a certain type</p>
<p>of pattern wage bargaining.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll explain this really simply,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s pretend that you&rsquo;re in a sector</p>
<p>with three different companies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say an automotive sector,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just say one is GM,</p>
<p>one is Ford, one is Chrysler.</p>
<p>Now, all these workers in your sector are all unionized.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all Swedish UAW,</p>
<p>whatever the equivalent is, members,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all paid the same,</p>
<p>and the union is setting, through bargaining,</p>
<p>the union is setting the wages across the sector.</p>
<p>But the unions, and let&rsquo;s say GM is the most productive</p>
<p>of these companies,</p>
<p>Ford is number two, Chrysler is number three.</p>
<p>The unions would intentionally set the wages,</p>
<p>set their benchmark to Ford in the middle.</p>
<p>So what that would do is say to Ford,</p>
<p>okay, Ford will stay in business</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll be able to meet the wage demands.</p>
<p>Chrysler&rsquo;s probably might go out of business</p>
<p>because they won&rsquo;t be able to meet the demands,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll have to really adapt really quickly,</p>
<p>they might have to lay off people,</p>
<p>they might have to restructure.</p>
<p>So union knows this in advance,</p>
<p>and all the auto workers know this.</p>
<p>But the most efficient manufacturer, GM,</p>
<p>now has excess profits</p>
<p>because if they were negotiating with just the GM workers,</p>
<p>the GM workers might even have been able to demand more,</p>
<p>but instead, these workers are pegging their wage demands</p>
<p>to Ford&rsquo;s level, and GM is, in theory,</p>
<p>able to expand and employ more people</p>
<p>and adopt new production techniques with their surplus.</p>
<p>Then those Chrysler workers would be absorbed by the state</p>
<p>by active labor market policies,</p>
<p>then put back to work for GM</p>
<p>or for these expanding sectors.</p>
<p>So in other words, you&rsquo;re now in a situation</p>
<p>where the state has a pretty big role in your economy,</p>
<p>taking a lot of your money and taxes.</p>
<p>Unions are really shaping your life as a capitalist</p>
<p>far more than would happen</p>
<p>in a country like the United States.</p>
<p>And yet still, despite your more limited economic freedom,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still creating a more productive economy.</p>
<p>So it could work.</p>
<p>The system has to be designed right,</p>
<p>and I think social democracies were designed the right way.</p>
<p>I think any future democratic socialism</p>
<p>after social democracy</p>
<p>would have to be designed the right way.</p>
<p>Could you just linger on that a little more,</p>
<p>the pattern wage bargaining?</p>
<p>So GM is the most efficient,</p>
<p>and Ford is the second most.</p>
<p>Can you explain to me how,</p>
<p>can you explain to me again the wages,</p>
<p>setting the wages to the Ford level,</p>
<p>how that is good for GM?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>How that encourages more GM?</p>
<p>This is just sectoral, or actually in this case,</p>
<p>centralized wage bargaining.</p>
<p>So setting the wages at a level that Ford can afford,</p>
<p>but a level that would probably be too expensive</p>
<p>for Chrysler in the automotive sector,</p>
<p>would benefit GM because they&rsquo;re drawing</p>
<p>what we could call excess profits.</p>
<p>Because GM, if the GM itself could potentially</p>
<p>have to deal with just the enterprise of GM workers,</p>
<p>bargaining for wages,</p>
<p>and if they saw their profitability was high,</p>
<p>they would know their leverage,</p>
<p>and they would say, pay us even more,</p>
<p>or else we&rsquo;re gonna go on strike.</p>
<p>But instead, they&rsquo;re accepting slightly lower wages</p>
<p>than they would have otherwise had,</p>
<p>in return for the company having excess profits,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re, through both the state, their union,</p>
<p>and sometimes there&rsquo;s worker councils or whatever else,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re playing a role in saying,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna make sure this excess profit</p>
<p>is actually invested productively,</p>
<p>in order to expand employment and just output.</p>
<p>Okay, can we talk about unions?</p>
<p>In general then, what are the pros and cons of unions?</p>
<p>So the interest of the union,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>I have a lot to learn both about the economics</p>
<p>and the human experience of a union.</p>
<p>The union&rsquo;s interest is to,</p>
<p>what, to protect worker rights</p>
<p>and to maximize worker happiness,</p>
<p>not the success and the productivity</p>
<p>and the efficiency of a company, right?</p>
<p>No, I would disagree.</p>
<p>So I think a union&rsquo;s interest is in</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s collectively bargaining on behalf of workers,</p>
<p>because in certain cases,</p>
<p>I am right now a manager at The Nation magazine, right?</p>
<p>If I have a problem with my working conditions</p>
<p>or I need a raise or whatever else,</p>
<p>I could, with my skillset, my background,</p>
<p>my role in the company,</p>
<p>I could go to my boss, the owner of The Nation and say,</p>
<p>okay, I need to renegotiate my contract on these terms.</p>
<p>I could bargain, right?</p>
<p>Now, if I was a ordinary worker at like a CVS or something,</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t like my conditions and I went to my boss</p>
<p>and said, hey, I need a $2 raise</p>
<p>and I need to be home by 8.30</p>
<p>because I have obligations at home,</p>
<p>the boss would probably say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, that&rsquo;s not possible, right?</p>
<p>Maybe try the Rite Aid down the street</p>
<p>or the Walgreens down the street or whatever.</p>
<p>Now, if I went to the boss at a place like CVS</p>
<p>or even better, if all the pharmaceutical workers</p>
<p>at Rite Aid, CVS, Walgreens went to our bosses and said,</p>
<p>listen, we collectively need to,</p>
<p>$2 more and better hours, shorter shifts or whatever else,</p>
<p>then they would probably have no choice but to concede.</p>
<p>You have to bargain collectively at any level</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an ordinary worker.</p>
<p>And there are some exceptions,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s for certain highly skilled workers.</p>
<p>But even in those cases, of course, all workers are skilled.</p>
<p>I mean, just the technical definition.</p>
<p>Even in those cases, a lot of those workers</p>
<p>have to bargain collectively as well</p>
<p>in order to get more wealth.</p>
<p>But they cannot make their demands so excessive</p>
<p>that their firm gets out of business.</p>
<p>The workers only are workers</p>
<p>as long as they&rsquo;re gainfully employed.</p>
<p>So often unions will try to select their wage demands</p>
<p>at such a level that it ensures</p>
<p>that their firm will stay in business.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the problem is the way firms go out of business</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t by an explosion,</p>
<p>like the way popcorn starts getting cooked.</p>
<p>At a certain moment, it just is over.</p>
<p>It seems like the union can,</p>
<p>through collective bargaining, keep increasing the wage,</p>
<p>keep increasing the interest of the worker</p>
<p>until it suffocates the company,</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t die immediately,</p>
<p>but it dies in like five years.</p>
<p>So that might still serve the interest of the worker,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t serve the interest of society as a whole</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creating cool stuff and increasing.</p>
<p>So a market that&rsquo;s operating and increasing cool stuff</p>
<p>and constantly innovating and so on</p>
<p>and creating more and more cool stuff</p>
<p>and increasing the quality of life in general.</p>
<p>I disagree with the premise</p>
<p>because I think even taking your example,</p>
<p>that would be better for society.</p>
<p>If a firm cannot pay its workers a living wage</p>
<p>but its competitors can,</p>
<p>then that firm will either figure out a way to innovate,</p>
<p>develop new techniques, new markets,</p>
<p>new ways to be productive,</p>
<p>or it should go out of business.</p>
<p>And it would be better for it to go out of business</p>
<p>than to stay in business</p>
<p>or to be artificially kept in business in any sort of way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the Chrysler, my old centralized bargaining.</p>
<p>But then there is, innovation costs money too.</p>
<p>So the flip side of that,</p>
<p>I think to play devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>is that it incentivizes,</p>
<p>automotive industry is probably a good example of that.</p>
<p>It incentivizes cutting costs everywhere</p>
<p>and sort of whatever has been making you money currently,</p>
<p>figuring out how to do that really well</p>
<p>without investing into the long-term future of the company</p>
<p>like all the different ways it can pivot,</p>
<p>all the different interesting things it could do</p>
<p>in terms of investing into R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Whenever there&rsquo;s more and more and more pressure</p>
<p>on paying a living wage for the workers,</p>
<p>it might not, again, it might suffocate and die</p>
<p>over the next five, 10, 20 years,</p>
<p>which might be a good destructive force</p>
<p>from a capitalist perspective,</p>
<p>but it might rob us of the Einstein of a company, right?</p>
<p>Of the flourishing that the company</p>
<p>and the workers within it can do</p>
<p>over a period of five, 10, 20 years.</p>
<p>Well, this is just a problem with a lot of capitalism,</p>
<p>which is about short-termism, right?</p>
<p>Because the same thing could be said</p>
<p>from you&rsquo;re starting a company,</p>
<p>you have a plan for it to make a lot of money,</p>
<p>but your investors want dividends right away.</p>
<p>So you have to take away from your long-term R&amp;D</p>
<p>or other plans and deliver short-term dividends.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s often why a lot of, I think, R&amp;D</p>
<p>is often rooted in state institutions</p>
<p>and research and whatever else is being drawed on.</p>
<p>And also, I think that that&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>the state has some sort of role in fostering firms</p>
<p>in either a, my version of a socialist economy</p>
<p>or a capitalist economy or whatever else</p>
<p>to help with these time horizon problems.</p>
<p>So I won&rsquo;t dispute that workers could play a role</p>
<p>in time horizon problems, but more often than that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming from investors, it&rsquo;s coming from</p>
<p>just a host of other market pressures</p>
<p>that people might have.</p>
<p>And I would say that in the real world,</p>
<p>a lot of investment funds don&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>from just retained earnings.</p>
<p>It comes from a lot of sources.</p>
<p>So I think this is a problem that could be solved</p>
<p>through public policy, but definitely exists today as well.</p>
<p>So you mentioned living wage.</p>
<p>Is there a tension between a living wage,</p>
<p>and maybe you could speak to what a living wage means,</p>
<p>and the workers owning all of the profit of the company?</p>
<p>Sort of this kind of spectrum.</p>
<p>No, I guess the spectrum is from no minimum wage,</p>
<p>the lowest possible thing you could pay to a worker,</p>
<p>then somewhere in that spectrum is a living wage,</p>
<p>and then at the top is all of the profit</p>
<p>from the companies owned by the workers.</p>
<p>So split to the workers.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that any society is going to have</p>
<p>to make distributional choices.</p>
<p>You could imagine a variety of capitalism</p>
<p>in which workers are paid quite little,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s extremely high taxation,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s redistribution after the fact.</p>
<p>You could imagine a system in which</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s less taxation after the fact,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s more guarantees and regulations</p>
<p>on how much people are paid before the fact.</p>
<p>In my vision of a social society,</p>
<p>there would be some other way that unions work,</p>
<p>and in my example, the centralized bargaining unions</p>
<p>would work that bargain at the sectoral level,</p>
<p>and not just at the enterprise level</p>
<p>like our unions do today.</p>
<p>But there could be benchmarks set</p>
<p>for different occupations or wages,</p>
<p>and the reason why you would want a benchmark</p>
<p>at a worker-controlled firm</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t want workers self-exploiting themselves</p>
<p>in order to gobble up market share,</p>
<p>or because you don&rsquo;t want them collectively deciding,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna invest in this longer-term time horizon,</p>
<p>and out-compete other people that way.</p>
<p>So you might say, okay,</p>
<p>if you do this sort of clerical work,</p>
<p>you have to be paid the equivalent of $15 an hour,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a minimum,</p>
<p>but on top of that,</p>
<p>you get dividends from excess profits,</p>
<p>and I think it would also have to be combined</p>
<p>with public financing for expansions and for development,</p>
<p>which could be done in quite a competitive way.</p>
<p>So you could have a variety of banks.</p>
<p>In my vision, state-owned banks,</p>
<p>how would they decide who to invest in</p>
<p>and who to not invest in,</p>
<p>who to give a loan for expansion to and who not to?</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t want it to be like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m gonna invest in my nephew&rsquo;s firm</p>
<p>and not this other firm,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna invest in this guy&rsquo;s firm</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s an Italian,</p>
<p>but not this guy&rsquo;s firm because he&rsquo;s Albanian,</p>
<p>or whatever else.</p>
<p>Just make it rational at the level of their goal</p>
<p>is just like any other investment person at a bank today</p>
<p>to maintain a certain risk profile</p>
<p>and to have an interest yield</p>
<p>and decide to invest on that basis.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s a huge automotive firm</p>
<p>that has been on business for 50 years</p>
<p>that needs a little operating cash,</p>
<p>like, yeah, they could get their $50 million at 3% loan.</p>
<p>If you have some crazy blue sky idea</p>
<p>and you manage to get it to that point,</p>
<p>like maybe you and your friends would get it</p>
<p>at 12% or something close to what a VC would offer today.</p>
<p>So I only kind of go into these details</p>
<p>not because to say that a system doesn&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>in advance, map out all the different possibilities,</p>
<p>but I think it does have to be willing to accept</p>
<p>a lot of things that we know today.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give you a version of socialism</p>
<p>that everything&rsquo;s gonna be fine,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna live harmoniously,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t have these sort of tensions</p>
<p>and you could hunt in the evening</p>
<p>and fish in the afternoon</p>
<p>and write criticism or whatever else.</p>
<p>I do hope that there&rsquo;s horizons beyond this</p>
<p>that we can aspire to.</p>
<p>I do have those visions,</p>
<p>but for now I think our task as socialists</p>
<p>is to imagine five minutes after midnight,</p>
<p>what can we do right away within our lifetime vision?</p>
<p>So that means through some level of central planning,</p>
<p>reallocating resources to the workers.</p>
<p>So I think the primary mechanism</p>
<p>in this private sector under socialism</p>
<p>would be a market mechanism,</p>
<p>firms competing against each other to expand,</p>
<p>connected to a system of public financing.</p>
<p>But even at that level,</p>
<p>the individual bankers and public banks and so on</p>
<p>would be operating based on their own rationality</p>
<p>and the state would certainly shape investment decisions,</p>
<p>but maybe no more than they do</p>
<p>in a lot of capitalist systems.</p>
<p>So the state might already today</p>
<p>in a lot of countries decide,</p>
<p>we wanna invest in green technology,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s gonna be favorable rates for people</p>
<p>or tax credits for people investing in green technology.</p>
<p>So the state already shapes investment.</p>
<p>I think what should be centrally planned,</p>
<p>and this is where I&rsquo;m proud to sound</p>
<p>like an old school socialist,</p>
<p>is things like healthcare, things like transit,</p>
<p>things like our natural monopolies of lots of types,</p>
<p>I think can be done very well through planning</p>
<p>and we already have plenty of examples,</p>
<p>but a lot of this society I think</p>
<p>would be the private sphere</p>
<p>of worker-controlled cooperatives</p>
<p>competing against each other,</p>
<p>weak firms failing, successful firms expanded.</p>
<p>And the banks, you&rsquo;re saying publicly or privately owned?</p>
<p>Publicly owned.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just put it all on the table</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost guaranteed that every system has corruption.</p>
<p>So I guess the bigger question is</p>
<p>which system has more corruption?</p>
<p>This one with central planning</p>
<p>and worker cooperatives versus unfettered capitalism</p>
<p>or any flavor of capitalism.</p>
<p>I think any system has potential for corruption.</p>
<p>I think it depends on how good your civil service is,</p>
<p>how much oversight do you have</p>
<p>to resolve a problem once it arises.</p>
<p>How does corruption happen in a socialist system?</p>
<p>So you have to, again, I apologize,</p>
<p>but the large-scale examples of it,</p>
<p>so we can look at Soviet Union, China, and Sweden.</p>
<p>Fundamentally different nations and histories</p>
<p>and peoples and economic systems and political systems,</p>
<p>but all could be called in part socialist.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a ridiculous almost caricature</p>
<p>of corruption in the Soviet system,</p>
<p>the gigantic bureaucracy that&rsquo;s built,</p>
<p>where somehow corruption seeps in</p>
<p>through kind of dispersion of responsibility,</p>
<p>that nobody&rsquo;s really responsible for the corruption.</p>
<p>I just had a conversation with Ed Calderon</p>
<p>who fought the cartels in Mexico,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a huge amount of corruption in Mexico,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like even seen as corruption.</p>
<p>You understand when a cop pulls you over,</p>
<p>you give this much money and so on.</p>
<p>And so that kind of seems to happen in certain systems,</p>
<p>and it seems to have happened in socialist systems</p>
<p>more than in capitalist systems in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Or maybe I&rsquo;m wrong on that.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think in a lot of countries,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s seen as the cost of doing business, right?</p>
<p>Now, in particular countries built on a system</p>
<p>of central planning or just state allocation of resources</p>
<p>where the state both produces and allocates</p>
<p>and things run through bureaucracies,</p>
<p>then I think you&rsquo;re much more apt to have corruption</p>
<p>than in a system with just a smaller sphere for the state.</p>
<p>So for example, if you&rsquo;re in a hypothetical version</p>
<p>of the US, you might see a lot more corruption</p>
<p>in like the post office,</p>
<p>but you wouldn&rsquo;t have that corruption in your workplace.</p>
<p>So you kind of learn to go around that.</p>
<p>For one thing, even in state sectors, you can have,</p>
<p>and this often is the case in democratic countries,</p>
<p>you have a transparent civil service</p>
<p>where people who are corrupt are prosecuted by judges</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s frowned upon and it just,</p>
<p>over time, it goes away.</p>
<p>So you go from having political machines</p>
<p>that were tied to certain,</p>
<p>had friends in certain police precincts</p>
<p>and whatever else in the US in the 19th century</p>
<p>and early 20th century to now today,</p>
<p>that would be a huge scandal and unheard of, right?</p>
<p>So I think over time, having a independent court system,</p>
<p>having a truly meritocratic civil service</p>
<p>can be implemented anywhere.</p>
<p>I think though, in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>the extra little bit that happened was</p>
<p>you had a bureaucracy that just had so much power</p>
<p>because the bureaucracy was producing</p>
<p>and distributing everything.</p>
<p>And everyone was relying on the bureaucracy with jobs.</p>
<p>The way to social advancement was through the bureaucracies.</p>
<p>So you end up with people like Khrushchev,</p>
<p>people going from peasants to supreme leaders of countries</p>
<p>just through getting hooked up in the bureaucracy</p>
<p>and advancing within it.</p>
<p>And not all of these were bad people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Khrushchev was that bad of a person</p>
<p>or Gorbachev, but this is their mechanism</p>
<p>to advancement in systems like this.</p>
<p>In the vision of democratic socialism that I propose,</p>
<p>the state doesn&rsquo;t have that overriding power to begin with.</p>
<p>But I think in either case,</p>
<p>corruption has arose in many different systems</p>
<p>and has been successfully dealt with.</p>
<p>I think on the developmental trajectory</p>
<p>of even countries today that we think of</p>
<p>as being very corrupt,</p>
<p>corruption will fade away as well.</p>
<p>But you definitely need a system in which individuals act,</p>
<p>individuals are incentivized to act rationally.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a system in which cops who are corrupt</p>
<p>are prosecuted and investigated</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s internal controls, a civilian board review</p>
<p>and kind of an internal investigators</p>
<p>within police departments or whatever else,</p>
<p>there will be less corruption over time</p>
<p>if people are punished.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a system in which you&rsquo;re running a firm</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re the manager of a firm, an elected manager,</p>
<p>and everyone at that firm is trying for more efficiency</p>
<p>and trying for more excess profits</p>
<p>or whatever else at the end of the day,</p>
<p>dividends at the end of the day,</p>
<p>then if you try to hire your nephew</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not good at your job,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna win reelection, right?</p>
<p>So you shouldn&rsquo;t, I think no system should rely on</p>
<p>a change in culture that come naturally</p>
<p>or some sort of individual altruism.</p>
<p>I think the systems have to be constructed</p>
<p>in such a way that it&rsquo;s not rational to behave poorly.</p>
<p>Sort of from a theoretical perspective,</p>
<p>either a socialist or capitalist system</p>
<p>can have either culture.</p>
<p>But it seems like if you prioritize meritocracy,</p>
<p>if the people that are good, whatever the good means,</p>
<p>in terms of integrity, in terms of performance,</p>
<p>in terms of competence,</p>
<p>it seems like that leads to a less corrupt system</p>
<p>and it seems like capitalism,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of flavors of capitalism,</p>
<p>but capitalism, because it does prioritize meritocracy,</p>
<p>more often leads to less corruption.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not a question of political or economic systems,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a question of what kind of stuff do you talk about</p>
<p>that leads to a culture of less corruption?</p>
<p>First of all, I think in theory,</p>
<p>maybe capitalism rewards meritocracy,</p>
<p>but I think in practice,</p>
<p>anyone watching this, or you and me,</p>
<p>would think of some of the people we know</p>
<p>that work the hardest and they&rsquo;re often working class people</p>
<p>working in the food service industry</p>
<p>or whatever else, right?</p>
<p>I think we don&rsquo;t have, in practice,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we actually live in a society</p>
<p>that rewards people for hard work.</p>
<p>I think we reward people for a combination</p>
<p>of accidents of birth plus hard work.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Let me push back because, yes, so I agree with you,</p>
<p>but let me push back on a subtle point</p>
<p>because I like to draw a difference</p>
<p>between hard work and meritocracy</p>
<p>because as a person who works really hard,</p>
<p>like I work crazy hard,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve also worked with a lot of people</p>
<p>that are just much better than me.</p>
<p>So hard work does not equal skill, good, productive.</p>
<p>I just want to kind of draw that distinction,</p>
<p>but I agree with you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think our society rewards directly hard work</p>
<p>or even high skill.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many examples, at least we can see,</p>
<p>that it does not do so.</p>
<p>So we have an unequal distribution of talent, of course.</p>
<p>So if we lived in a society in which</p>
<p>there was some level of acceptable inequality,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a normative kind of the question</p>
<p>of how much we would say is acceptable, right?</p>
<p>And that inequality was based</p>
<p>on this unequal distribution of talent,</p>
<p>then I think that would be fine with me, right?</p>
<p>That would actually be a meritocracy.</p>
<p>What I see in the US is often,</p>
<p>okay, so if you are a upper middle class or rich kid</p>
<p>and you get a good education, K through 12,</p>
<p>out of those people, there will be some</p>
<p>that work extra hard and go on to do incredible things</p>
<p>or are very successful,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be other people that do not, right?</p>
<p>And decide for whatever reason or go down a different path.</p>
<p>And you could say maybe among that group</p>
<p>of the upper middle class, there is a meritocracy, right?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re actually given those opportunities</p>
<p>to make their own decisions and to fail,</p>
<p>whereas many, many other people,</p>
<p>the vast majority of American society, I would say,</p>
<p>60 plus percent don&rsquo;t really get those opportunities</p>
<p>to make those choices to begin with.</p>
<p>And I would aspire to the type of world,</p>
<p>at least as a first step,</p>
<p>in which our only inequalities are based</p>
<p>on our unequal, innate kind of distributions of talent.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess a lot of people worry</p>
<p>that when you have a socialist</p>
<p>in any degree central planning,</p>
<p>or perhaps a collective of workers,</p>
<p>that it won&rsquo;t result in that kind of meritocracy</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that, no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to have that kind of meritocracy.</p>
<p>Think about it this way.</p>
<p>The workers themselves are incentivized</p>
<p>and are shaped by market forces too, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to respond to consumer needs and preferences.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to expand market share.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to make money.</p>
<p>So it requires no kind of leap</p>
<p>into these people are gonna be more altruistic</p>
<p>or whatever else, even on purely bourgeois terms,</p>
<p>the same way you would maybe justify</p>
<p>competitive capitalist firms.</p>
<p>I think you could justify this system</p>
<p>as long as you think that people,</p>
<p>elected management can perform just as well.</p>
<p>I think based on the experiences of cooperatives,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen that they can.</p>
<p>And then at the state level,</p>
<p>state bureaucracies have their own sets of incentives.</p>
<p>But in most systems</p>
<p>that already have extensive state bureaucracies,</p>
<p>these people at high levels are appointed or elected.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re held to certain standards.</p>
<p>At the national level,</p>
<p>a national government wants to maintain</p>
<p>the tax revenue that they need to pay for services.</p>
<p>We already, I think, have incentive structures</p>
<p>that you could say that some people might just,</p>
<p>I think, disagree with the normative thing of like,</p>
<p>why would people have to own their own means of production,</p>
<p>control their workplaces or whatever else?</p>
<p>Why do we need this level of equality?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t we just get by with our existing system,</p>
<p>but just like make things a little bit easier</p>
<p>for capitalists to make money</p>
<p>and then everyone will benefit or whatever else.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a normative question.</p>
<p>In my vision of socialism,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be plenty of multiple parties</p>
<p>with different views and perspectives</p>
<p>trying to either push us deeper</p>
<p>into more radical forms of socialism,</p>
<p>or on the other hand, to kind of roll back</p>
<p>to more capitalist forms of government.</p>
<p>So I think that, again,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t try to make up a perfect system</p>
<p>and try to implement it.</p>
<p>You have to do it as a process democratically and so on.</p>
<p>So just philosophically, in your gut,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more concerned about the innate equal value</p>
<p>of human beings versus the efficiency</p>
<p>of this wonderful mechanism that we call human civilization</p>
<p>at producing cool stuff.</p>
<p>Just like a gut, if we were sitting at a bar,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the gut feeling you come with.</p>
<p>Of course, your mind is open,</p>
<p>but you want to protect the equal value of humans.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to fight the hypothetical.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll say equality.</p>
<p>I am concerned with equality,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think the two are necessarily always in tension.</p>
<p>But also, when you think about all the great things</p>
<p>that human beings have produced,</p>
<p>often I think people today just look at the end outcome.</p>
<p>Like we go to the pyramids and we&rsquo;ll marvel at the pyramids</p>
<p>and the human achievement that it took</p>
<p>to make it happen,</p>
<p>but we won&rsquo;t stop to think about all the suffering</p>
<p>that went into the making of that thing.</p>
<p>So I think we kind of lean in the opposite direction</p>
<p>where we marvel at our achievements,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t often think about the suffering</p>
<p>or exploitation that went into certain human achievements.</p>
<p>I would love a society in which we could marvel at things</p>
<p>and not have to worry about the exploitation</p>
<p>that was involved,</p>
<p>because there was no exploitation or oppression involved.</p>
<p>There was just human ingenuity</p>
<p>and creativity and collaboration.</p>
<p>And to the degree, which you may disagree,</p>
<p>to the degree there&rsquo;s a tension between the two,</p>
<p>at least give equal weight</p>
<p>to the consideration of the suffering,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t just marvel at the beauty of the creations.</p>
<p>To the degree there is a tension between the two.</p>
<p>What Stalin did, actually, too, it&rsquo;s not just capitalists,</p>
<p>but what Stalin did was he sacrificed whole generations</p>
<p>because he thought that he was building something</p>
<p>for the future, for future Russians to enjoy</p>
<p>and for future people of the world to enjoy.</p>
<p>And actually that analogy that I just gave</p>
<p>about the pyramids was written by Karl Kotzke,</p>
<p>the German socialist, anti-Stalinist critic,</p>
<p>when he was complaining about US journalists and others</p>
<p>going to Russia in the 1930s</p>
<p>and marveling at all the new industries.</p>
<p>Are these people blind to the suffering</p>
<p>behind these things they&rsquo;re marveling about?</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I think you mentioned</p>
<p>in the context of social democracy</p>
<p>that freedom of speech and freedom of the press</p>
<p>or basically the freedom of people to have a voice</p>
<p>is an important component,</p>
<p>which I think is something that caught my ear a little bit</p>
<p>because if you think about the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>one of the ways that the authoritarian regime</p>
<p>was able to control,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost part of the central planning</p>
<p>is you have to control the message</p>
<p>and you have to limit the freedom of the press.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of notion,</p>
<p>especially in like ideas or maybe caricatures</p>
<p>of the ideas of cultural Marxism,</p>
<p>sometimes caricatured even further as wokeism,</p>
<p>that you want to be careful with speech.</p>
<p>You want to censor speech because some speech hurts people.</p>
<p>So in some sense, you want to respect the value,</p>
<p>the equality of human beings</p>
<p>by being careful with the words you say.</p>
<p>So is there a tension there for you?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no tension.</p>
<p>And in part, I think that it is very condescending</p>
<p>or patronizing to assume that people can&rsquo;t take debate,</p>
<p>that people can&rsquo;t, either as a society or individuals,</p>
<p>visually be engaged in the exchange of ideas</p>
<p>without, or even very vigorous debate</p>
<p>without being broken by it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically a free speech absolutist.</p>
<p>I would draw the line at obviously</p>
<p>direct incitements of violence</p>
<p>or certain other speech like that, but in general.</p>
<p>You think a lot of people would be surprised to hear that?</p>
<p>No, I mean, not people who know my work.</p>
<p>I mean, more generally,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people on the right,</p>
<p>even in the center, I think might have the idea</p>
<p>that a lot of the far left wants to censor them.</p>
<p>I think some of the center left wants to censor them,</p>
<p>but I think a lot on the far left,</p>
<p>on the Marxist or socialist left,</p>
<p>I think that free speech is more or less the norm.</p>
<p>Yeah, where is the imperative to censor coming from?</p>
<p>Is this just some small subset of the left on Twitter?</p>
<p>Is there some philosophical idea behind certain groups</p>
<p>that like, if we&rsquo;re to steal me on the case</p>
<p>in which group actually has the interest of humanity</p>
<p>in mind in wanting to censor speech?</p>
<p>I think we might need to just take it case by case</p>
<p>for an example by example,</p>
<p>because honestly, I would have to think</p>
<p>about a particular case, but let&rsquo;s just say generally</p>
<p>that a lot of American liberalism rightly sees</p>
<p>the revolution around the civil rights</p>
<p>and later the extension of this rights revolution</p>
<p>for gay rights and so on as being a very positive</p>
<p>achievement of the last half century.</p>
<p>And I completely agree.</p>
<p>Now, for me, now that we&rsquo;ve won those rights,</p>
<p>a lot of our battle for change needs to go</p>
<p>beyond the representational realm</p>
<p>and needs to really reground itself</p>
<p>in the material bread and butter struggles</p>
<p>of ordinary people trying to survive,</p>
<p>the battle for good healthcare for all Americans</p>
<p>and so on, these are my immediate demands.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a segment of American liberalism</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t want to go in that confrontational</p>
<p>economic direction and wants to skirt away</p>
<p>from battles over things like universal healthcare</p>
<p>and so on, and really are just still caught</p>
<p>at this battle over rights and representation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s devolved in such a way that they feel</p>
<p>like they need to make change.</p>
<p>The way they make change is only through interventions</p>
<p>and culture, because they don&rsquo;t really have</p>
<p>the same sense of class and class struggle</p>
<p>that agree or disagree with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very material plane.</p>
<p>So instead, they look at comedians who said</p>
<p>the wrong thing, or they look at all sorts</p>
<p>of other ways to make change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really making a change,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just making them look bad</p>
<p>and making our culture worse.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where a lot of it comes from.</p>
<p>But I think that a lot of the left,</p>
<p>even the left that&rsquo;s much more into battles</p>
<p>over race and lots of other stuff,</p>
<p>like real serious anti-racist on the left,</p>
<p>of course, I&rsquo;m an anti-racist,</p>
<p>but a lot of my work is focused on the primacy of class.</p>
<p>But even these people are very concerned</p>
<p>about material struggles and issues,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really care about these issues</p>
<p>they think are ephemeral kind of issues.</p>
<p>So when you focus exclusively on language,</p>
<p>that somehow leads you astray,</p>
<p>like on being concerned about language</p>
<p>without deeper economic inequalities and so on,</p>
<p>you just become an asshole.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s on Twitter pointing out how racist everyone is.</p>
<p>So the anti-racism becomes a caricature of anti-racism.</p>
<p>Exactly, because anti-racism was really about</p>
<p>the struggle of people for equal rights and voting.</p>
<p>It was about the struggle for people</p>
<p>who were trapped into bad neighborhoods</p>
<p>because they couldn&rsquo;t get decent jobs</p>
<p>and their neighborhoods were redlined or whatever else.</p>
<p>It was really like a struggle for survival.</p>
<p>And what was the main demands, like the language of this?</p>
<p>One, it was the march for jobs and freedom.</p>
<p>It was the slogan, I am a man,</p>
<p>asserting the kind of universal dignity of people.</p>
<p>This is what the civil rights movement was about.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t a surprise,</p>
<p>there was a lot of self-described socialists,</p>
<p>people like Bayard Rustin, A. Philip Randolph,</p>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>I mean, these were people who were Ella Baker.</p>
<p>They were socialists.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of Americans agree with them</p>
<p>with their immediate demands,</p>
<p>even though they weren&rsquo;t themselves socialists,</p>
<p>but it was a very materialistic struggle.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of this has been co-opted</p>
<p>into just some sort of vague</p>
<p>and just disconcerting complaints</p>
<p>about language or culture and so on.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King was a socialist.</p>
<p>To what degree was he a socialist?</p>
<p>I would love to learn about that.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King, I think, broadly called himself</p>
<p>at various points of his life,</p>
<p>a Christian socialist or a democratic socialist,</p>
<p>especially after his speech against the Vietnam War</p>
<p>and the Riverside Church.</p>
<p>I think that was 67.</p>
<p>The last years of his life,</p>
<p>he became much more involved in struggles against the war</p>
<p>and also struggles for workers&rsquo; rights.</p>
<p>He was assassinated when he was at a rally</p>
<p>at workers&rsquo; rights,</p>
<p>where he thought the next battle</p>
<p>was gonna be an economic battle.</p>
<p>He had this famous line where he said,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just want to integrate the lunch counter</p>
<p>if it means that we can&rsquo;t afford to order a burger</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>That was the line along those lines.</p>
<p>And I think that got to his point</p>
<p>where the civil rights struggle was part of a step</p>
<p>of building some sort of wider movement.</p>
<p>So he and these other civil rights leaders</p>
<p>were very much interested in working with organized labor,</p>
<p>with working with the left as it was constructed then,</p>
<p>and building some sort of mass space</p>
<p>for not just rights, but redistribution.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating which figures self-identified</p>
<p>and were in part socialists.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein was one.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein was a socialist.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein wrote an article</p>
<p>for the first issue of this left-wing magazine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually still publishing today</p>
<p>called Monthly Review in, I think, 1949.</p>
<p>And his article is called, Why Socialism?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s paywalled,</p>
<p>so people should check it out.</p>
<p>But yeah, Einstein was one.</p>
<p>Huh, huh.</p>
<p>So probably the central idea is the pacifist,</p>
<p>the anti-war idea for him, or no?</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s been so many years since I read it.</p>
<p>I think it was more about,</p>
<p>I think it was actually more economically focused,</p>
<p>but I would need to go back and read it.</p>
<p>But is war in general a part of the fundamental ideas</p>
<p>that socialists are against,</p>
<p>democratic socialists are against?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the relation between socialism and war?</p>
<p>So I think that traditionally in the socialist movement,</p>
<p>war was associated with capitalist competition</p>
<p>and international competition.</p>
<p>And you can look at World War I as very much a case</p>
<p>where different nations were competing with each other</p>
<p>and developing quite violent rivalries</p>
<p>that was in part based on competition</p>
<p>and the periphery over access to markets</p>
<p>and colonies and whatever else.</p>
<p>So it was very easy to draw a direct correlation.</p>
<p>I am opposed to war.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m opposed to imperialism,</p>
<p>the domination of strong nations,</p>
<p>dominating smaller nations.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself a pacifist.</p>
<p>I think most socialists wouldn&rsquo;t call themselves pacifists</p>
<p>because there are some struggles that are worth fighting for.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s national liberation struggles and so on</p>
<p>where if there&rsquo;s no democratic avenue for change,</p>
<p>positive change has been made</p>
<p>through armed revolts around colonialism and whatnot.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re living in an age where hopefully,</p>
<p>I know neither of us have children,</p>
<p>our children or children&rsquo;s children in the future</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t have to live through war.</p>
<p>And that is one thing that as countries</p>
<p>have gotten more developed, as the world has changed,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve actually seen less and less war.</p>
<p>Like I won&rsquo;t dispute Pinker on this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Obviously, Putin&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine</p>
<p>and the conflict in Ethiopia is like kind of an exception,</p>
<p>but on the whole, I think we&rsquo;re going in that direction.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s always been a major organizing plank</p>
<p>of socialists against war and against just kind of</p>
<p>this sense of right-wing nationalism and national identity</p>
<p>that often leads to war.</p>
<p>And obviously not everyone on the right has embraced that.</p>
<p>A lot of libertarians are consistently anti-war as well,</p>
<p>but I think the right ideologically</p>
<p>has been associated with war,</p>
<p>even if some advocates of capitalism have not been.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the military industrial complex,</p>
<p>which is the financial machine of the whole thing.</p>
<p>I presume, well, since a lot of that is government,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the relation to socialism</p>
<p>and the military industrial complex?</p>
<p>Well, a lot of it&rsquo;s government contracts,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s privately produced, right?</p>
<p>By companies like Lockheed Martin and things like that.</p>
<p>You could draw a very crude materialist connection</p>
<p>between any of these things</p>
<p>and to kind of prove an ideological point,</p>
<p>but we could produce just as many arms</p>
<p>and then just bury them or never fire them off</p>
<p>or whatever else.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are companies that have a vested interest</p>
<p>in heightening up tensions</p>
<p>or saying that we need to buy a new weapon system</p>
<p>to be prepared for a conventional war with China or Russia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I think we all know</p>
<p>that if there&rsquo;s gonna be a conventional war</p>
<p>between these countries,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna lead to something worse.</p>
<p>And no amount of advanced fighter jets</p>
<p>is gonna make a difference.</p>
<p>But I try to avoid cruder, causal connections,</p>
<p>even though there are relationships.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the old slogan,</p>
<p>which was quite an effective slogan in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>At my first anti-war marches when I was a teenager,</p>
<p>I definitely have shouted it,</p>
<p>but kind of no war for oil.</p>
<p>Like both is like correct</p>
<p>in that it gets to what people&rsquo;s senses</p>
<p>of like what&rsquo;s going on and how it&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>but also like analytically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of wanting to explain what really happened</p>
<p>or why we ended up in the Middle East,</p>
<p>which is like a much more complex geopolitical story.</p>
<p>And it is a story of geopolitics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perhaps less a story of capitalism or socialism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a story, yeah, it&rsquo;s a geopolitical story</p>
<p>that I think actually operates outside</p>
<p>of the economic system of individual nations.</p>
<p>It has to do more with, honestly, in part, egos of leaders.</p>
<p>And there is a international battle for resources,</p>
<p>but surely there&rsquo;s alternatives.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>And I think that part of what being a socialist</p>
<p>is about dreaming in the long-term</p>
<p>about a different sort of world without, in my mind,</p>
<p>needless divisions of people into nations</p>
<p>with standing armies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll still have pride about where we&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll still be distinctive cultural features</p>
<p>and so on about where we&rsquo;re from.</p>
<p>We definitely would, at least for the foreseeable future,</p>
<p>be divided into places as administrative units.</p>
<p>But the idea that there should be a Mexican army</p>
<p>and an American army and a Russian army</p>
<p>and a Ukrainian army is just on the face of it,</p>
<p>I think in the long run will be seen as ridiculous.</p>
<p>Just like we see it as ridiculous today,</p>
<p>looking back at the idea that a lord from London</p>
<p>would be engaged in civil strife</p>
<p>with a lord from Liverpool</p>
<p>and a bunch of peasants would die.</p>
<p>Just kind of on the face of it just seems kind of ridiculous</p>
<p>that these different places would have their own banners</p>
<p>and lords and armies.</p>
<p>I think in the long run,</p>
<p>you might have to zoom out a thousand years,</p>
<p>but in the long run, people will say the same</p>
<p>about nation states and standing armies</p>
<p>and battles over specks of dirt</p>
<p>that mean nothing in a cosmic sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, for sure, aliens would laugh at us</p>
<p>or humans that go far beyond Earth</p>
<p>and look at the history, hmm.</p>
<p>Well, most of the history will be forgotten</p>
<p>because if humans successfully expand out into the universe,</p>
<p>just the scale of civilization will grow so fast</p>
<p>that the bickering of the first few thousand years</p>
<p>of human history will seem insignificant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very Marxist idea</p>
<p>that I both appreciate in one way,</p>
<p>but on the other hand, it&rsquo;s kind of scary,</p>
<p>which is that human history is only now beginning</p>
<p>before we&rsquo;re in prehistory,</p>
<p>but in the future, we&rsquo;ll be in kind of real history.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of really important history</p>
<p>has already happened and I think posterity will remember it.</p>
<p>And I think that it will be easier</p>
<p>to assign certain people the role of villains,</p>
<p>the people not to engage in the contentious topic,</p>
<p>off topic of Ukraine or whatever else,</p>
<p>but the idea that one government or man</p>
<p>would launch a war to recover</p>
<p>or to take several hundred square miles of territory</p>
<p>and tens of thousands of people will die,</p>
<p>I think seems absurd to us, many people today, luckily,</p>
<p>but it would not have seemed absurd 50, 60 years ago.</p>
<p>It would have just been a normal thing, right?</p>
<p>These kind of territorial disputes and so on.</p>
<p>Projecting into the future,</p>
<p>I think within our lifetimes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll live to see that kind of conflict be eradicated.</p>
<p>And in part, you could say that, why?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because of popular pressure and organization.</p>
<p>So you could say kind of the pro-worker,</p>
<p>socialist organizing part of it, making it less normal.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a capitalist, you could say,</p>
<p>well, markets are more interlinked,</p>
<p>so war is even more irrational.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have a firm answer, whatever it is.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>You mentioned Marxist view of history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting to just briefly talk about,</p>
<p>what do you think of it?</p>
<p>What do you think of this Marxist view</p>
<p>of how the different systems evolve</p>
<p>from the perspective of class struggle</p>
<p>is what we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Well, I fundamentally, I&rsquo;m a Marxist.</p>
<p>I fundamentally believe in the broad contours</p>
<p>of historical materialism,</p>
<p>but I think we should be clear</p>
<p>what Marxist theory tells us and what it doesn&rsquo;t tell us.</p>
<p>I think Marxist theory tells us pertinent things</p>
<p>about how societies evolve,</p>
<p>about how the distributional resources work</p>
<p>in any given society, who owns, who doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>how the conflict, distributional conflicts, and so on.</p>
<p>I think Marxism can tell us a lot.</p>
<p>How surplus is distributed.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>What it can&rsquo;t tell us is, as a friend put it,</p>
<p>the sex appeal of blue jeans or whatever else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beyond what Marxism is meant to do.</p>
<p>What economic system can tell us</p>
<p>about the sex appeal of blue jeans?</p>
<p>No economic system, but socialism in the Soviet sense,</p>
<p>when it was turned into the Soviet style,</p>
<p>dialectical materialism, was meant to tell us everything</p>
<p>from explain genetics and agriculture</p>
<p>and whatever else in a very disastrous way.</p>
<p>So I definitely don&rsquo;t believe in the application</p>
<p>of these ideas in an extremely wide way.</p>
<p>And also I&rsquo;m a Marxist because it&rsquo;s a framework</p>
<p>that helps me understand pertinent facts about the world.</p>
<p>If at some point I no longer think the framework</p>
<p>is doing that, I will not be a Marxist,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a socialist on normative grounds</p>
<p>because I have certain beliefs about the equality of people</p>
<p>because I believe that we should have a society</p>
<p>with liberty, with equality, with fraternity.</p>
<p>And that I hope I&rsquo;ll always be a socialist</p>
<p>until the day I die, but it&rsquo;s kind of a very unscientific</p>
<p>or unserious thing to say, this is my framework</p>
<p>from beginning to end for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>But from a perspective of history,</p>
<p>you should say that, so Marx says that you go through,</p>
<p>societies go through different stages.</p>
<p>It could be crudely summarized as primitive communism,</p>
<p>imperialism, maybe slave society, feudalism,</p>
<p>defined by marketalism and then capitalism and socialism</p>
<p>and finally stateless communism, communism.</p>
<p>Did I miss something there?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that was close enough.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s definitely true of Marxist theory</p>
<p>that the contradictions of capitalism,</p>
<p>the fact that it has brought together all these workers,</p>
<p>all these materials and whatever else,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s now allowing it to socially create wealth</p>
<p>on a mass scale, but that wealth is that process</p>
<p>is being privately directed.</p>
<p>And also the surplus is being privately kind of appropriated</p>
<p>is a contradiction and that would lead</p>
<p>to some sort of rebellion or revolution or change.</p>
<p>And eventually this contradiction</p>
<p>would be a federal production too.</p>
<p>So we would have to move into a socialist society.</p>
<p>But actually just to backtrack,</p>
<p>so in terms of contradiction,</p>
<p>so it starts when we&rsquo;re in a village, hunter gatherers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you call primitive communism</p>
<p>where everyone&rsquo;s kind of equal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a collective, right?</p>
<p>All right, maybe you could just let me, hold on a second.</p>
<p>And then inequalities form of different flavors.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what imperialism is,</p>
<p>is one dude rises to the top</p>
<p>and has some control of different flavor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what feudalism with,</p>
<p>when you have one dude at the top</p>
<p>and you have merchants doing some trading and so on.</p>
<p>And then that leads to capitalism</p>
<p>when you have private ownership of companies</p>
<p>and they result in some kind of class inequality.</p>
<p>And eventually that results in a revolution</p>
<p>that says, no, this inequality is not okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not natural.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t respect the value of human beings</p>
<p>and therefore it goes to socialism</p>
<p>where there is, under Marx&rsquo;s view,</p>
<p>I guess some role for the state.</p>
<p>State is doing some redistribution</p>
<p>and then the pure communism at the end is when it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a collective where there&rsquo;s no state-centralized power.</p>
<p>What part of that is wrong?</p>
<p>No, I think broadly the Marxist theory of history</p>
<p>is about different types, different modes of production</p>
<p>that exist at various times based on material conditions.</p>
<p>So in the early times in this theory,</p>
<p>there was not much surplus being generated, right?</p>
<p>And there was generally egalitarian societies.</p>
<p>Then as we became agricultural, as society developed,</p>
<p>there was more surplus being produced.</p>
<p>Then there was a group of people</p>
<p>that were ruling classes of their age</p>
<p>that controlled and distributed that,</p>
<p>that controlled that division of labor</p>
<p>and appropriated more of that surplus for themselves.</p>
<p>And they weren&rsquo;t involved in productive labor.</p>
<p>In the early print of a society,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s involved in productive labor.</p>
<p>Later on, you had castes of priests</p>
<p>who did nothing but kind of pray and write</p>
<p>and kind of lecture people all day, right?</p>
<p>And you had kings and rulers and bureaucrats</p>
<p>and traders and so on.</p>
<p>You have a more complex division of labor,</p>
<p>but also more inequity driving out of that.</p>
<p>Capitalism was a revolutionary system</p>
<p>because it took away,</p>
<p>one, it made us tremendously more productive, right?</p>
<p>It expanded production beyond our wildest imaginations,</p>
<p>but it also no longer bound workers</p>
<p>to their lord or manor or whatever else.</p>
<p>They were now free to move,</p>
<p>free to engage in contracts with employers and so on.</p>
<p>But even though workers are now producing</p>
<p>all this tremendous wealth,</p>
<p>and even though productive forces</p>
<p>had been matured in such a way,</p>
<p>they were ultimately taken away</p>
<p>from all the wealth that they were created.</p>
<p>They got some of it back.</p>
<p>They were in wealthy societies,</p>
<p>but they were all there collectively together</p>
<p>producing this wealth.</p>
<p>And that was a potent force.</p>
<p>So Marx theorized that would lead to a revolution</p>
<p>or change in a socialist direction.</p>
<p>I think, in fact, what we saw was that,</p>
<p>yes, workers are dependent on,</p>
<p>capitalists are dependent on workers,</p>
<p>but the dependency is obviously symmetrical</p>
<p>in the sense that workers are also dependent on capitalists.</p>
<p>But in fact, it&rsquo;s an asymmetrical dependency</p>
<p>in that ordinary workers need their jobs</p>
<p>more than capitalists need the contribution</p>
<p>of individual workers.</p>
<p>So it became kind of a collective action problem</p>
<p>where you would need the mass of workers to get together,</p>
<p>decide to change things,</p>
<p>but also people would be afraid</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;d be dependent on their jobs</p>
<p>for their livelihood.</p>
<p>So revolution became a lot harder than people thought,</p>
<p>especially in democratic countries</p>
<p>where workers had certain outlets</p>
<p>and certain powers and rights and responsibility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that</p>
<p>where you did have socialist revolutions,</p>
<p>they were in places like the third world,</p>
<p>post-colonial states trying to merge out of colonialism.</p>
<p>They were in places like China and Russia,</p>
<p>autocratic countries,</p>
<p>and never in a advanced capitalist country.</p>
<p>Now, in Marxist theory of history,</p>
<p>even as interpreted by a lot of smart Marxists</p>
<p>like G.A. Cohen and others,</p>
<p>there is a certain inevitability</p>
<p>to socialism after capitalism.</p>
<p>The way that I would put it myself</p>
<p>is I kind of have a more,</p>
<p>I guess you could say like Kantian view of it.</p>
<p>Like I think socialism is something</p>
<p>that ought to happen,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not something that necessarily will happen.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll need to organize and persuade.</p>
<p>And also potentially, again,</p>
<p>the key part of any social system that&rsquo;s democratic</p>
<p>is you have to allow for the possibility</p>
<p>of a democratic revision to a different sort of system.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d be more than happy in my vision of socialism</p>
<p>for there to be capitalist parties</p>
<p>getting hopefully three, four, or 5% of the vote,</p>
<p>maybe a lot more,</p>
<p>in the same way that in the U.S. or a republic,</p>
<p>we could right now have a monarchist party.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s gonna support a monarchist party</p>
<p>in the U.S. in serious numbers.</p>
<p>Although that&rsquo;s gaining popularity.</p>
<p>In Europe or elsewhere?</p>
<p>No, isn&rsquo;t there, in the anarchist tradition,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t they saying that one of the ways</p>
<p>you could have a leader is in monarchy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re more directly responsible to the citizens.</p>
<p>If you have a leader, it&rsquo;s healthier to have a monarch.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not familiar with this,</p>
<p>but I have heard this stated multiple times.</p>
<p>In the left-wing anarchist traditions,</p>
<p>like anarcho-syndicalism or whatever else,</p>
<p>their slogan is kind of no kings, no gods,</p>
<p>no masters or whatever, no bosses.</p>
<p>So they definitely would not agree with that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not familiar enough.</p>
<p>Anarchism runs a gamut from left to right</p>
<p>in interesting ways, though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to ask about that.</p>
<p>But yeah, okay, so you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t believe Marx&rsquo;s theory of history</p>
<p>in the sense that every stage is a natural consequence</p>
<p>of every other stage.</p>
<p>Of course, he would predict that somebody like you</p>
<p>must exist in order for those stages</p>
<p>to go from one to the next,</p>
<p>because you have to believe ought</p>
<p>in order for action to be taken</p>
<p>to inspire the populace to take action.</p>
<p>So two things.</p>
<p>One is I do broadly believe in Marx&rsquo;s theory of history</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just explaining how productive forces develop</p>
<p>and the relations of production in any given system.</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s a theory of transition</p>
<p>from capitalism to socialism</p>
<p>that Marx didn&rsquo;t really spell out,</p>
<p>but it was kind of implied that it would naturally happen.</p>
<p>And Marx was living in an era of tremendous upheaval.</p>
<p>Marx himself actually saw,</p>
<p>when he was living in London in the 1870s,</p>
<p>the Paris Commune,</p>
<p>when workers took over for just a few months,</p>
<p>but they took over the producers of Paris,</p>
<p>took over the city,</p>
<p>basically created their own government,</p>
<p>their own system, and so on.</p>
<p>So he was living through an era of upheaval.</p>
<p>And Engels, especially, oversaw and was the mentor</p>
<p>to all these rising socialist parties.</p>
<p>So he was very closely collaborating with socialists</p>
<p>in places like Britain and Germany</p>
<p>when they were drafting their first programs</p>
<p>for the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<p>So it felt like this was gonna happen.</p>
<p>It felt like this rise in working class would take power,</p>
<p>but I think the stability of the system was underestimated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see the contradictions in the system,</p>
<p>but can you see its mechanisms of stability?</p>
<p>The way in which mass collective action or revolution</p>
<p>is more the exception or the norm.</p>
<p>Could you have imagined, if you&rsquo;re Marx,</p>
<p>not only how much wealth the system would produce over time,</p>
<p>which I think you could have imagined,</p>
<p>but also developments like the welfare state</p>
<p>and mass democracy and universal suffrage,</p>
<p>which might&rsquo;ve changed how workers relate to the system</p>
<p>or operate within it.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just the transition part</p>
<p>that I think wasn&rsquo;t spelled out properly.</p>
<p>But I think in either case, as socialists,</p>
<p>we can assume that history is working in our favor.</p>
<p>We just need to kind of hold out</p>
<p>and wait for the inevitable revolution.</p>
<p>We have to convince people of both,</p>
<p>one, the struggle for day-to-day reforms</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s important to be politically organized,</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s important to be a member of a union</p>
<p>or to advocate for things like universal health care</p>
<p>or whatever else to try to kind of build the cohesion</p>
<p>and sense of self of the class,</p>
<p>then ultimately, for the desirability,</p>
<p>once we accomplish it, once we build social democracy,</p>
<p>of going beyond social democracy,</p>
<p>which is, of course, the challenge.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t think it requires leadership from the outside.</p>
<p>I think there are plenty of organic leaders</p>
<p>that have emerged from the working class</p>
<p>that have advocated for socialism from the working class.</p>
<p>And if you look at the class composition</p>
<p>during the glory days of the European socialist parties,</p>
<p>I mean, this was very much</p>
<p>a working class parties and organizations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only been the last like 30 years</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s been taken over by professionals</p>
<p>and not coincidentally,</p>
<p>they have accomplished very little in those 30 years.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the practical and the pragmatic.</p>
<p>Can we actually jump to the, at the horizon?</p>
<p>As you mentioned, as a social democrat,</p>
<p>like you focus on the policies of today,</p>
<p>but you also have a vision and dream of a future.</p>
<p>And so Marx did as well.</p>
<p>So the perfect communism at the end.</p>
<p>Can you describe that world?</p>
<p>Also, is there elements to that world</p>
<p>that has elements of anarchism?</p>
<p>So again, like I said, there&rsquo;s Michael Malice next door.</p>
<p>So like anarcho-communism,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if I&rsquo;m using that term correctly,</p>
<p>but basically no central control.</p>
<p>Can you describe what that world looks like?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the traditional socialist vision</p>
<p>of kind of, if you want to call it full communism</p>
<p>would be very similar to the anarchist vision</p>
<p>of a world without coercion, mass abundance, and so on.</p>
<p>I myself don&rsquo;t share that vision.</p>
<p>I believe that we will always need</p>
<p>to have a state in some form</p>
<p>as a way to, one, even just mediate difference.</p>
<p>I think traditionally a lot of Marxists have thought</p>
<p>that after you remove the primary contradiction,</p>
<p>quote unquote, of class,</p>
<p>that the other, all other political questions</p>
<p>would be resolved.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a lot behind a lot of the thinking</p>
<p>of we&rsquo;re gonna have a full communism after politics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there will be an after politics.</p>
<p>I think, for one thing, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you another Northeast example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say me and you are trying to,</p>
<p>with different groups of people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to build a crossing</p>
<p>of the Hudson River.</p>
<p>And for various reasons,</p>
<p>you and the people around you want to build a bridge.</p>
<p>Me and the people around me want to build a tunnel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a question that you will probably need</p>
<p>a mediation for, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need, one, it&rsquo;s a big project,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;ll be a very complex division of labor and so on.</p>
<p>But even beyond that, just politically,</p>
<p>you will need the state to mediate the difference.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to have a vote, have a vote that people trust,</p>
<p>have institutions that people trust,</p>
<p>and so on to make a decision.</p>
<p>Society is never going to go beyond that decision-making.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible outside of the state</p>
<p>to create stable voting mechanisms?</p>
<p>Or is human nature going to always seep into that?</p>
<p>I just wonder why we would have to,</p>
<p>if the state is democratic and responsive,</p>
<p>the state isn&rsquo;t authoritarian.</p>
<p>So it might not be called a state,</p>
<p>but it would function as a state, right?</p>
<p>But why not just call it a state?</p>
<p>But in other words, if you don&rsquo;t have something like that,</p>
<p>then don&rsquo;t you have a greater risk of tyranny</p>
<p>or a tyrant emerging in the vacuum?</p>
<p>So I think people&rsquo;s fear of the state</p>
<p>is what would happen if the state had too much power.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a legitimate fear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have democratic checks on state power</p>
<p>and certain guarantees of freedom and so on.</p>
<p>But yeah, I guess I just wonder,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more afraid of the vacuum</p>
<p>and not having a democratic, responsive state</p>
<p>and what the world would turn into.</p>
<p>And also, I&rsquo;m just not a utopian thinker,</p>
<p>if that makes sense.</p>
<p>I like to think that I&rsquo;m an egalitarian thinker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a socialist, but my mind just goes to,</p>
<p>I can see a vision of the future</p>
<p>that I would like 50, 60 years from now.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s some sort of future of superabundance</p>
<p>and automation, and there&rsquo;s some sort</p>
<p>of techno-utopian future.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want some of those things</p>
<p>that would exist in my five minutes from now</p>
<p>vision of socialism.</p>
<p>But I just don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>And in general, I&rsquo;m wary of visions of change</p>
<p>that seem like they&rsquo;re not built off little pieces</p>
<p>that we have now and not built off history</p>
<p>and experience and whatever else.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a year zero.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even like the term prehistory</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s a lot in history that I want.</p>
<p>I want Shakespeare under socialism.</p>
<p>I want a lot of things that I think</p>
<p>we should be grateful for.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a part of tradition that I think that exists</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hierarchical and exploitative and whatever else,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s another part of tradition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our sense of place and belonging</p>
<p>and our connection with the past</p>
<p>and hopefully the future.</p>
<p>And I want to keep that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re worried about revolution</p>
<p>or otherwise a vacuum being created</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re worried about the things</p>
<p>that might fill that vacuum.</p>
<p>So the anarchists often worry</p>
<p>about the same mechanism of the state</p>
<p>that controls voting or keeps voting robust</p>
<p>and resilient and stable,</p>
<p>the same mechanism also having a monopoly on violence.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the tension.</p>
<p>So they get very nervous about a central place</p>
<p>having a monopoly on violence.</p>
<p>Whereas if there is gonna be a place</p>
<p>within a monopoly on violence,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say temporarily take that for granted,</p>
<p>should it not be a place with a skilled,</p>
<p>elected, accountable, transparent civil service</p>
<p>with a democratic mandate and so on?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, well put.</p>
<p>Speaking of AI, just to go on that tangent,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible to have a future world</p>
<p>at least of 50 years, 50, 100 years</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s an AI sort of central planning?</p>
<p>Sort of we remove some of the human elements</p>
<p>that I think get us into a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Like you can take a perspective on the Soviet Union</p>
<p>that the flaws of the system there</p>
<p>have less to do with the different ideologies</p>
<p>and more to do with the humans and the vacuums</p>
<p>and how humans fill vacuums</p>
<p>and the corrupting nature of power and so on.</p>
<p>If we have AI that&rsquo;s more data-driven</p>
<p>and is not susceptible to the human elements,</p>
<p>is that possible to imagine such a world?</p>
<p>Almost like from a sci-fi perspective.</p>
<p>Maybe in the future you can imagine</p>
<p>certain calculation problems</p>
<p>that arose during central planning</p>
<p>solved through advanced computing.</p>
<p>But I would say that there&rsquo;s another whole set of problems</p>
<p>with the system that were incentive problems</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure how that advanced computing</p>
<p>would solve the incentive problems</p>
<p>of how do you get people to actually produce things</p>
<p>that other people want?</p>
<p>Kind of that informational question</p>
<p>of how do you communicate without endless meetings</p>
<p>or someone reading your brain what you actually want?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that kind of informational question</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s the incentive of how do you get people</p>
<p>to work efficiently at work</p>
<p>and how do you get firms to use their resources</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re getting more efficiently?</p>
<p>And I think solving the calculation problem</p>
<p>solves some of these questions but not all of them.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s kind of a who knows</p>
<p>but if your vision of the future</p>
<p>requires some sort of leap into a technological unknown,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very hard to advocate for today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to consider the possibility of technology</p>
<p>empowering a better reallocation of resources.</p>
<p>If you care about of kind of the innate value</p>
<p>of human beings and think of the mechanism</p>
<p>of reallocation of resources as a good way</p>
<p>to empower that equality,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s nice to remove the human element from that.</p>
<p>Like if you work really hard</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really good at your job,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice to be really data-driven</p>
<p>in allocating more resources to you.</p>
<p>So kind of, like I kind of think that</p>
<p>the agency part requires human beings</p>
<p>and conscious human activity.</p>
<p>So I think if you have a sort of planning system that works</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say the technology is there for it to work,</p>
<p>I would want it to be democratic planning in such a way</p>
<p>that there is a human element,</p>
<p>there is some debate and deliberation in society.</p>
<p>And also even in my vision of socialism</p>
<p>with the state sector and state investments and so on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want there to be more public discussion</p>
<p>and debate about certain things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just left to technocrats</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to live in society</p>
<p>where you just find out the next day</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some massive infrastructure project</p>
<p>that you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to think about</p>
<p>or debate or feel like you&rsquo;re participating in.</p>
<p>And debate is not just facts and logic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why if the whole universe</p>
<p>was about facts and logic,</p>
<p>computers could do a better job of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about humans debating each other</p>
<p>that goes into the difficult gray areas</p>
<p>of what it means to be human</p>
<p>or what it means to have a life that&rsquo;s worth living.</p>
<p>That requires humanity.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also worried about,</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m excited by the possibility</p>
<p>of AI controlling everything, half joking,</p>
<p>but the reason I&rsquo;m really terrified of that</p>
<p>is because usually there&rsquo;s a possibility</p>
<p>of a human taking control of that system.</p>
<p>So you now start to get the same kind of authoritarian thing.</p>
<p>Well, I am a human.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smart enough to be able to control this AI system.</p>
<p>And I will do, based on what this AI system says,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like talking down to people</p>
<p>and then use that AI system</p>
<p>to now have the same kind of thing</p>
<p>as Hall and Moore in 1930s.</p>
<p>And also our preferences might change.</p>
<p>So an AI system might say the goal of humanity</p>
<p>is to just increase infinitely efficiency</p>
<p>or increase output,</p>
<p>whereas we might collectively decide</p>
<p>that we have enough and we want to have a trade-off.</p>
<p>And I think that we need a system</p>
<p>that allows for people to make certain trade-offs.</p>
<p>And have more of this leisure</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been learning about from you.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting concept, leisure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to, how do you spell that?</p>
<p>All right, so if we can step into the practical,</p>
<p>we were talking about historical and philosophical,</p>
<p>into the practical of today.</p>
<p>What are some of the exciting policies</p>
<p>that represent democratic socialism today,</p>
<p>modern socialism?</p>
<p>I think you mentioned some of them.</p>
<p>Medicare for all or universal healthcare.</p>
<p>Something you haven&rsquo;t mentioned is tuition-free college.</p>
<p>Increasing minimum wage,</p>
<p>maybe stronger unions like we talked about.</p>
<p>What are some ideas here?</p>
<p>What are some ideas that are especially policy,</p>
<p>especially exciting to you?</p>
<p>Well, I think that hours reduction</p>
<p>has always been an important demand for socialists.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it&rsquo;s been a reality</p>
<p>in certain countries like France in recent decades.</p>
<p>Where part of the logic is,</p>
<p>if you have a bunch of people</p>
<p>working for 40 plus hours a week,</p>
<p>and you also have some unemployed people</p>
<p>who would like more employment,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s not a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>You could reduce hours to 35 hours</p>
<p>and still maintain the same output</p>
<p>by employing more people</p>
<p>to kind of fill the slack in hours.</p>
<p>So one, I think it&rsquo;s a solidaristic thing</p>
<p>in working-class movements</p>
<p>between unemployed and employed workers.</p>
<p>I also think that, yeah, it gives people more time.</p>
<p>So Marx was a big advocate in his day</p>
<p>of a 10-hour bill in the UK</p>
<p>that would have reduced the hours of working time</p>
<p>and reduced child, or eliminated,</p>
<p>or reduced child labor and other things as well.</p>
<p>And part of it was, this is a radical demand</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s reducing the sphere, as you saw,</p>
<p>of exploitation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s putting limits on how much time</p>
<p>the capitalists can take from ordinary workers</p>
<p>and how much freedom they would have.</p>
<p>With healthcare, one, I just think it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>a government healthcare system.</p>
<p>You could tell me that you don&rsquo;t want it in the US,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t tell me it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve seen it work</p>
<p>in every other major industrial system in different forms.</p>
<p>So what does that usually involve?</p>
<p>What does universal healthcare involve?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different varieties.</p>
<p>In the UK, for instance,</p>
<p>they have a national health service</p>
<p>in which medical personnels and hospitals</p>
<p>are run directly by the state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a mini-Soviet system, to be honest,</p>
<p>but just for healthcare.</p>
<p>And it works pretty well just for healthcare.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s one example of the way</p>
<p>in which you could actually take the market.</p>
<p>So I give you a vision of socialism</p>
<p>that involves a lot of market,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s certain spheres</p>
<p>where you could remove the market from</p>
<p>and still have an efficient system,</p>
<p>in part because this is a area in which we,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t have, obviously for cosmetic procedures,</p>
<p>whatever, they have preferences,</p>
<p>but for most routine things that people do in healthcare,</p>
<p>they just need to see a doctor.</p>
<p>They need to get diagnosed.</p>
<p>Some of these systems have had trouble</p>
<p>with wait lists for specialists or whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more of like an allocation problem of,</p>
<p>if you want more specialists, you pay specialists more.</p>
<p>Like this is just problems that could be solved by,</p>
<p>like through the mechanisms of planning</p>
<p>and government-run healthcare.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the most left-wing that you could get</p>
<p>is the system in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you have a system like Medicare for All,</p>
<p>where you say, all right, most of the doctors,</p>
<p>besides for public hospitals that already exist,</p>
<p>are going to be privately employed by hospitals.</p>
<p>The hospitals are going to be private.</p>
<p>But instead of having all these different insurance carriers,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just going to have one national insurance carrier</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all going to pay into.</p>
<p>That national insurance carrier is going to negotiate</p>
<p>the price of healthcare with doctors,</p>
<p>the price of drugs with the pharmaceutical companies,</p>
<p>and so on, to hopefully reduce prices</p>
<p>and to implement a different little bit of planning</p>
<p>into the system.</p>
<p>Because if there&rsquo;s only one big national insurance company,</p>
<p>that company has a lot of weight and power.</p>
<p>But you could still visit your same doctor</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s still some,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as radical of a shift in that direction.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the dominant demand of Bernie Sanders</p>
<p>and the left right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 30 plus million people in the U.S.</p>
<p>that would be insured that currently aren&rsquo;t insured.</p>
<p>If we move to this system,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of other people that are underinsured</p>
<p>or worried about how to pay co-pays or premiums involved.</p>
<p>I think it would be a net benefit</p>
<p>for the vast majority of the U.S. population,</p>
<p>even if it was offset by certain taxes,</p>
<p>because we spend a lot of money out of pocket</p>
<p>with health insurance.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a demand also that&rsquo;s widely popular.</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s almost like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to build support</p>
<p>for something like socialism,</p>
<p>we were talking this lofty vision of socialism</p>
<p>after capitalism or what worker ownership,</p>
<p>the means of production would look like in practice</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And by the way, you&rsquo;re one of the few interviewers</p>
<p>who ever asked me any of the details.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s good that I had a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of a rough sketch in my head</p>
<p>for the last, you know, whatever, 16 years</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been a socialist.</p>
<p>But we have to start in the here and now.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t convince people</p>
<p>that the state should play a bigger role</p>
<p>in their health insurance,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t convince Americans</p>
<p>and a whole host of other sectors</p>
<p>that they should be living in something closer</p>
<p>to a social democracy,</p>
<p>how are you gonna convince those people</p>
<p>that there should be worker ownership</p>
<p>of the means of production?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a ridiculous like leap</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have the credibility</p>
<p>as the group of people organizing</p>
<p>for universal healthcare,</p>
<p>organizing for a $15 minimum wage</p>
<p>and able to get the goods.</p>
<p>And also in practice, as we fight for these reforms,</p>
<p>ordinary people will have a better sense,</p>
<p>at least my hope is,</p>
<p>of what it means to be involved with politics</p>
<p>and what politics can do for their lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s positive.</p>
<p>Because right now, when we talk about politics,</p>
<p>it often just seems that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>like a very glib cultural conflict</p>
<p>removed from the things that are important in our lives.</p>
<p>Whereas in truth, I think politics can be a tool</p>
<p>for us to make our lives better.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s like deep ideas here</p>
<p>where in some sense, universal healthcare</p>
<p>and worker collectives are not so radically different,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s philosophical ideas to explore and accept.</p>
<p>And also from my perspective, at least,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m wrong on this,</p>
<p>but it seems like with a lot of things</p>
<p>at the core of politics,</p>
<p>the right answer from an alien perspective is not clear.</p>
<p>Like everybody&rsquo;s very certain of what&rsquo;s the right answer.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s certain universal healthcare is terrible,</p>
<p>or in the case of universal healthcare,</p>
<p>majority of people think it&rsquo;s a good idea,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows.</p>
<p>Because I think that depends on cultural history,</p>
<p>on the particular dynamics of a country,</p>
<p>of a political system,</p>
<p>on the dynamics of the economic system in this country,</p>
<p>of the changing world.</p>
<p>The 21st century is different than the 20th century.</p>
<p>Maybe the failures of communism in the 20th century</p>
<p>will not be repeated in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Or the flip side of that,</p>
<p>maybe capitalism will actually truly flourish</p>
<p>with the help of automation in the 21st century.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows.</p>
<p>So people like you are basically arguing for ideas,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have to explore those ideas together.</p>
<p>Um, why do you think if universal healthcare is popular,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we have universal healthcare in the United States?</p>
<p>Well, democracy is a great thing.</p>
<p>Political democracy is wonderful.</p>
<p>It came from the struggles of ordinary people</p>
<p>to expand suffrage and so on.</p>
<p>But the economic sphere,</p>
<p>entrenched power in the economic sphere</p>
<p>bleeds into our political democracy.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people with a vested interest</p>
<p>in not having universal healthcare.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s large industries with a vested interest</p>
<p>in not having universal healthcare.</p>
<p>They pay for ads, pay lobbyists, they influence government,</p>
<p>and they have made it very difficult.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t get universal healthcare done without the bill,</p>
<p>even if you pass something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to make a change.</p>
<p>Like Obamacare was supposed to have a public option.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s been running on a public option</p>
<p>in the Democratic Party for 12, 13 years.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we have a public option?</p>
<p>People know that if people have the choice</p>
<p>of buying into a government plan,</p>
<p>they might just keep,</p>
<p>that might be the slow road</p>
<p>to really having universal healthcare.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of it&rsquo;s opposition.</p>
<p>Do you like that idea, the public option?</p>
<p>Maybe you can, like,</p>
<p>because isn&rsquo;t there complexities,</p>
<p>like preexisting conditions?</p>
<p>So isn&rsquo;t a public option</p>
<p>mean you can not have any insurance</p>
<p>until you get into trouble?</p>
<p>And then you can,</p>
<p>if it covers preexisting conditions,</p>
<p>just start paying for insurance then.</p>
<p>Therefore, young people don&rsquo;t pay for insurance.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it better to go full in?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t support a public option in part</p>
<p>because I think if we allow politicians to just say,</p>
<p>hey, I support a public option,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s just kind of a way to signal your support</p>
<p>for universal healthcare, but give us nothing.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what we saw under,</p>
<p>with Biden and a lot of other politicians</p>
<p>that have supported a public option.</p>
<p>I think in practice,</p>
<p>if a public option is defined in such a way</p>
<p>that it just means you,</p>
<p>by default can just opt in to a public plan.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say, hypothetically,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even have to pay for it.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s just a backdoor</p>
<p>to universal healthcare really quickly.</p>
<p>Because I think the vast majority of people</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t currently covered,</p>
<p>and also a lot of employers, to be honest,</p>
<p>would probably drop their private coverage</p>
<p>if they knew their employees can just get a public option</p>
<p>and maybe would only provide supplemental insurance</p>
<p>or whatever else.</p>
<p>But I think the broad overarching point</p>
<p>of all these demands is to say that socialists need</p>
<p>to be really connected to the day-to-day struggles</p>
<p>of people to just improve their lives.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re feeling like you&rsquo;re paying $400, $500</p>
<p>on the Obamacare market for health insurance,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s hampering your ability</p>
<p>to do what you wanna do in your life,</p>
<p>then maybe you would support a candidate</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s for universal healthcare.</p>
<p>If you feel like you&rsquo;re struggling to find work</p>
<p>that you could afford to pay your rent with</p>
<p>or whatever else,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ll support a candidate committed</p>
<p>to all sorts of mechanisms to reduce housing prices</p>
<p>or increase your power as a tenant and whatever else.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s like these day-to-day concerns need</p>
<p>to be connected to the more abstract</p>
<p>and lofty vision of change.</p>
<p>Otherwise, our politics just becomes</p>
<p>like this fantasy world thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nice ideas to think about or debate,</p>
<p>but really won&rsquo;t make much of a difference</p>
<p>in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>What do you think about free college?</p>
<p>Should college be free?</p>
<p>So I would say free college is not at the top</p>
<p>of my list of priorities,</p>
<p>but it definitely should be free</p>
<p>in my vision of a just society.</p>
<p>What is at the top, just to clarify,</p>
<p>is the universal healthcare up there?</p>
<p>Yeah, universal healthcare is probably far higher</p>
<p>in my priorities than free college.</p>
<p>I think right now, the way our system is built,</p>
<p>when someone goes to college,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re given credentials,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re given a decree they carry with them</p>
<p>for the rest of their life.</p>
<p>It gives them a chance to join kind of a privileged part</p>
<p>of the labor market, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want college-educated people</p>
<p>to think that non-college-educated people</p>
<p>are their enemies and vice versa,</p>
<p>because a lot of them are just ordinary,</p>
<p>working-class people trying to survive,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in different areas,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in different sectors.</p>
<p>Some of them are in nursing sectors</p>
<p>where they need a college degree and so on.</p>
<p>But if you just make college tuition free,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t also make trade skills</p>
<p>and other things free for someone to learn</p>
<p>how to become an electrician or a plumber</p>
<p>or whatever else, then to some degree,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re privileging one sector</p>
<p>of the labor market over another.</p>
<p>So I would advocate just,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna make something like that free,</p>
<p>you just have to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing it in an egalitarian way,</p>
<p>and that one, the options, the routes to college</p>
<p>are more equal.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s more investment in K-12 education</p>
<p>so that more kids in rough neighborhoods</p>
<p>have the chance to go to college,</p>
<p>and for those that choose the trade route</p>
<p>from any part of the country,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re given the skills and resources</p>
<p>for vocational trainings, and those are also free.</p>
<p>And it just feels like, in terms of order of operation,</p>
<p>I would just start with K-12 education,</p>
<p>improving it and whatever else,</p>
<p>then college after, but I&rsquo;m not opposed to it.</p>
<p>So does that, improving K-12 education,</p>
<p>does that mean investing more into it?</p>
<p>Is it as simple as just increasing the amount of money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s invested in public education?</p>
<p>In general, when it comes to the public sector</p>
<p>or any sphere that you&rsquo;re investing in,</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s not just as simple</p>
<p>as throwing money at a problem.</p>
<p>I do think we have a lot of schools that are underfunded,</p>
<p>but we have other schools that are adequately funded,</p>
<p>but the conditions in which those schools are,</p>
<p>like the neighborhoods they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on in society,</p>
<p>the problems are so deep</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s impossible for just education to solve everything.</p>
<p>And I think especially a lot of liberals</p>
<p>think that education should be the panacea.</p>
<p>Invest in education, you&rsquo;ll help people.</p>
<p>If kids are living in poverty,</p>
<p>if they go into school hungry or whatever else,</p>
<p>education&rsquo;s not gonna give them</p>
<p>everything they need to succeed.</p>
<p>So sometimes we, I think,</p>
<p>put too much weight on education.</p>
<p>And of course, you could define education more broadly,</p>
<p>which is like the care of the flourishing of the young mind,</p>
<p>whatever that is, whatever you call it.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of it starts with,</p>
<p>so New York City, at least, we do have universal pre-K.</p>
<p>So from age three onward, you have the option for that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s important for kids&rsquo; socialization.</p>
<p>Their parents are now able to know</p>
<p>that they could go to work or do something else</p>
<p>and have their kids taken care of.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of measures like that</p>
<p>that we could do to equalize things.</p>
<p>And again, for libertarians in the audience,</p>
<p>some of this stuff is scary</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s obviously more state-involved,</p>
<p>state-involved in pre-K,</p>
<p>state is already very involved in K through 12,</p>
<p>more investment into state institutions</p>
<p>like our state universities and in college.</p>
<p>But for me, it&rsquo;s not a question of state versus non-state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question of good outcomes for people.</p>
<p>And it just happens to be that for working-class people,</p>
<p>having the collective power to elect representatives</p>
<p>that will build a broader safety net is in their interest.</p>
<p>For upper-middle-class people, for others,</p>
<p>they could afford to pay for their own provisioning</p>
<p>either directly or through like Obamacare-like schemes</p>
<p>where you just get a subsidy</p>
<p>and you pay the rest yourself and whatever.</p>
<p>This is for really the bottom 40% plus of the population.</p>
<p>They really don&rsquo;t have any options,</p>
<p>so they prioritize other things.</p>
<p>And they end up with some sort of injury</p>
<p>or health problem or whatever else.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s bad for everyone in society,</p>
<p>but especially bad for the people</p>
<p>at the bottom of the labor market.</p>
<p>So I saw various estimates for socialist programs</p>
<p>like social security expansion, free college,</p>
<p>Medicare for all will cost upwards</p>
<p>of $40 trillion over 10 years for zero.</p>
<p>Okay, they could argue with those numbers and so on,</p>
<p>but so there&rsquo;s a cost.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a taxpayer cost.</p>
<p>What are, given the weight of that cost,</p>
<p>can you still make the case with these programs?</p>
<p>And then can you try to make the case against them</p>
<p>that the cost is too high?</p>
<p>So I will not argue with you on the numbers</p>
<p>because you just threw out random numbers.</p>
<p>I do think universal healthcare, if done right,</p>
<p>can be basically cost neutral.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an exception</p>
<p>because we spend a tremendous amount of money</p>
<p>on healthcare, a huge percentage of our GDP.</p>
<p>So I think it could be done</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s close to cost neutral.</p>
<p>So actually, can you argue on the numbers</p>
<p>without arguing on the numbers?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying just your gut says</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>depending on how these programs are done,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of variance in how much it will actually cost.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of bureaucracy and billing right now</p>
<p>in our healthcare sector, for example,</p>
<p>that would be eliminated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of costs that are spiraling upward,</p>
<p>a provider cost from both doctors, hospitals,</p>
<p>but also pharmaceuticals to drug costs</p>
<p>that insurance companies shoulder</p>
<p>because their market share is too fragmented</p>
<p>to really negotiate hard.</p>
<p>Medicare can sometimes negotiate better rates,</p>
<p>but a Medicare for all would negotiate even better rates.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a cost spiral</p>
<p>that we can adjust with more government involvement.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why we spend a bigger share of our GDP</p>
<p>on healthcare than other places.</p>
<p>But let me just accept the broad premise</p>
<p>that social programs cost money.</p>
<p>Now, I think that one, for ordinary people,</p>
<p>most of them, the trade-off of,</p>
<p>even hypothetically, if taxes on lower middle class</p>
<p>and working class people in certain cases go up,</p>
<p>the trade-off would still be in their benefit</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the ones who currently,</p>
<p>who would be consuming more of those goods.</p>
<p>And also our tax system and whatnot is progressive.</p>
<p>So the rich will pay more.</p>
<p>The majority will consume more of them.</p>
<p>Also, I think a lot of these programs</p>
<p>are the bedrock of a healthy society.</p>
<p>So one reason, for example,</p>
<p>we have so much crime and violence in the U.S.,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of cultural and other causes</p>
<p>with our level of gun ownership,</p>
<p>American history, and so on.</p>
<p>But one really important factor</p>
<p>is just the level of poverty and inequality in the U.S.</p>
<p>compared to other countries.</p>
<p>That combined with guns and other factors</p>
<p>means that we live in more violent, unequal societies.</p>
<p>A European would be shocked by the fact that,</p>
<p>in even some of our nicest areas,</p>
<p>and cities and elsewhere,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of rural violence too,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just normal to have gun violence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s normal to have drug-related violence.</p>
<p>We have, what, like 400 or 500 people some years</p>
<p>in Baltimore, a city of under a million getting killed.</p>
<p>These are all recipes for a society in which,</p>
<p>one, the public sphere is drunk like crazy</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not gonna go wander out</p>
<p>for an evening stroll in a park</p>
<p>if you live in a dangerous area or whatever else.</p>
<p>The rot goes very deep,</p>
<p>and a welfare state is one way</p>
<p>to live in a better society for everyone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been plenty of studies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one book called The Spirit Level on inequality</p>
<p>that was quite popular that just notes</p>
<p>that inequality is really terrible</p>
<p>for the psyches of the rich too,</p>
<p>not just for the poor.</p>
<p>So I think spending some more money living</p>
<p>in a more just society is doable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different ways to address certain cost spirals.</p>
<p>One reason why our welfare states</p>
<p>are getting more and more expensive</p>
<p>is in part just because our population is aging.</p>
<p>But many of the same people who say</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t afford more in our welfare states</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re already spending so much on Social Security</p>
<p>and all these other entitlements are the same people.</p>
<p>Also for, one, closing borders so immigrants can&rsquo;t come in</p>
<p>to help build the economy and to fill gaps in the economy,</p>
<p>and also who aren&rsquo;t for things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll make it easier to have kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 33 years old.</p>
<p>I have a lot of friends who have been putting off having kids</p>
<p>until they save up X amount of dollars,</p>
<p>even though they have someone</p>
<p>they could raise children with,</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t afford the cost of childcare.</p>
<p>Their job probably won&rsquo;t give them</p>
<p>more than four or six weeks of family leave or whatever else.</p>
<p>This is not the case in other countries.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s all sorts of benefits</p>
<p>from having a bigger welfare state.</p>
<p>But yes, there are costs</p>
<p>and there are gonna be certain trade-offs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a magical thing where you could just</p>
<p>have everything without trade-offs.</p>
<p>So in a progressive tax system,</p>
<p>is there, to push back on the costs here,</p>
<p>is there a point at which taxing the rich</p>
<p>is counterproductive in the long term?</p>
<p>So in the short term, there might be a net benefit</p>
<p>of increasing taxes because the programs,</p>
<p>the middle class, the lower middle class gets</p>
<p>is more beneficial.</p>
<p>Is there a negative side to taxing the rich?</p>
<p>In theory, yes, of course.</p>
<p>So one would be, if you tax the rich so much,</p>
<p>they change their consumption patterns</p>
<p>and that has negative impacts on the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>You would have to kind of really model it out,</p>
<p>but there would be a certain point</p>
<p>in which the consumption changes</p>
<p>might have net detrimental effects.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s more unlikely.</p>
<p>And the more likely scenario is you tax corporations</p>
<p>and other wealthy people in society</p>
<p>to the point that they have potentially less money</p>
<p>for productive investment,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re in a capitalist society,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re relying on capitalists to invest.</p>
<p>So you kind of don&rsquo;t wanna be in the worst of both worlds,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve gone too far for capitalism,</p>
<p>but not far enough for socialism.</p>
<p>In my vision, of course, of socialism,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one reason why we&rsquo;d have to take</p>
<p>the investment function away from capitalists.</p>
<p>There has to be, if you&rsquo;re gonna make it so hard for them</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t invest, or they can&rsquo;t employ labor</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;re employing now,</p>
<p>you have to create another mechanism</p>
<p>for supply to be created.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, that&rsquo;s a transition point, yeah.</p>
<p>What about longer term, de-incentivizing young people</p>
<p>that are dreaming of becoming entrepreneurs</p>
<p>and realizing that there&rsquo;s this huge tax on being wealthy?</p>
<p>If you take these big risks,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s required to be an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>and you are lucky enough to succeed,</p>
<p>and good enough to succeed,</p>
<p>that the government will take most of your money away?</p>
<p>I think realistically,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a disincentive for most people.</p>
<p>First of all, we already have a progressive taxation system.</p>
<p>The government does take a bunch of the money away,</p>
<p>and people are still striving to become rich.</p>
<p>A lot of what people want when they dream of success</p>
<p>is they want accolades, they want respect,</p>
<p>and of course they want some more wealth.</p>
<p>Wealth they consume luxury goods with, or whatever else.</p>
<p>But at a certain point, it becomes better for the state</p>
<p>to tax and either redistribute directly</p>
<p>or through social programs,</p>
<p>or redirect that money through tax credits</p>
<p>and other ways to shape investment</p>
<p>towards productive investment.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want a society in which a bunch of rich people</p>
<p>fly around in helicopters going from club to club</p>
<p>while the productive economy kind of does nothing.</p>
<p>At that point, I think a lot of ordinary rich people</p>
<p>might prefer the government to come in to tax them</p>
<p>and to try to spur investment in certain productive sectors.</p>
<p>So it really just depends.</p>
<p>But I honestly believe that most people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily wanna be rich</p>
<p>for the sake of being rich.</p>
<p>They wanna be successful,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s many different dynamics to that.</p>
<p>And accolades and social respect</p>
<p>is an important one of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why people who just become filthy rich often,</p>
<p>the first thing they do is start philanthropic trusts</p>
<p>and try to give away their money</p>
<p>because they want the social respect and accolades</p>
<p>and whatever else.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want just their money.</p>
<p>On that topic, sort of a little bit of a tangent,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of folks in the left community,</p>
<p>far left community, socialist community</p>
<p>that I think are at the source of a kind of derision</p>
<p>towards the B word, the billionaires.</p>
<p>Does it bother you, or do you think that&rsquo;s in part justified</p>
<p>a kind of using the word billionaire as a dirty word?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s perfectly justified</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a populist shorthand, right?</p>
<p>So obviously when I talk about inequality,</p>
<p>I often talk about power dynamics</p>
<p>between workers and bosses and so on.</p>
<p>Billionaire is just the 99, 1% version of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a popular shorthand to just explain the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who have accumulated obscene wealth.</p>
<p>These people aren&rsquo;t, in my mind, parasites</p>
<p>in the kind of very, very old school socialist rhetoric</p>
<p>in that, of course, capitalists provide employment,</p>
<p>take entrepreneurial risks,</p>
<p>come up with new ideas, sometimes themselves,</p>
<p>like sometimes directly manage work and whatever else.</p>
<p>But they exert so much power over the lives</p>
<p>of not just their workers, but society as a whole.</p>
<p>Taking away some of their wealth and power</p>
<p>is a way to just empower others.</p>
<p>And again, these things have policy trade-offs.</p>
<p>If you just snap your fingers and say,</p>
<p>Elon Musk, all your wealth is gone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now on food stamps or whatever else</p>
<p>in that kind of arbitrary way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be a totally disincentivized people</p>
<p>from trusting the rules of the game</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;ve been set up in a capitalist society.</p>
<p>And I think that would have negative consequences</p>
<p>for workers.</p>
<p>But saying that, hey, this person has too much power</p>
<p>and too much wealth and has too much ability</p>
<p>to dictate things about the lives of others,</p>
<p>I think is just simply a fact.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s true in the cases of people</p>
<p>who are good people and have risen to this position.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true in the cases of people</p>
<p>who are maybe not so good people</p>
<p>and who have risen to these positions.</p>
<p>So I agree with you in part, but I have to push back here.</p>
<p>So one of the problems I see is using billionaires</p>
<p>as shorthand to talk about power inequality</p>
<p>and wealth inequality often dismisses the fact</p>
<p>that some of these folks are some of the best members</p>
<p>of our society.</p>
<p>So outside of the, however the system</p>
<p>has created inequalities, a young person today</p>
<p>should dream to build cool stuff, not for the wealth,</p>
<p>not for the power, the fame,</p>
<p>but to be part of building cool stuff.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot of examples of billionaires</p>
<p>that have gotten there in shady ways and so on.</p>
<p>And you can point that out,</p>
<p>but in the same way we celebrate great artists</p>
<p>and great athletes and great literary icons</p>
<p>and sort of writers and poets and musicians</p>
<p>and engineers and scientists,</p>
<p>we should sort of separate the human creator</p>
<p>from the wealth that the system has given them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I worry about is like in our system,</p>
<p>some of the greatest humans are the ones</p>
<p>that have become rich.</p>
<p>And so we sometimes mix up the,</p>
<p>if you want to criticize the wealth,</p>
<p>we sometimes criticize the human and the creator</p>
<p>while that should actually be the person we aspire to be.</p>
<p>So, you know, I would agree with that.</p>
<p>LeBron James, if he&rsquo;s not already in his lifetime,</p>
<p>will be a billionaire and he got his money</p>
<p>largely through just being an incredible athlete,</p>
<p>excelling in his field more than anyone,</p>
<p>you know, besides for Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s my number two.</p>
<p>He might be my number one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m willing to keep keeping an open mind</p>
<p>about the LeBron versus Jordan conversation.</p>
<p>But, you know, he got that through his merit</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s been rewarded.</p>
<p>In a part he&rsquo;s getting rewarded</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s created vast amounts of wealth</p>
<p>beyond what he&rsquo;s getting.</p>
<p>This is just his share.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s in a salary cap league.</p>
<p>Whenever he&rsquo;s doing an endorsement,</p>
<p>obviously that company is thinking that he&rsquo;s worth more</p>
<p>than what they&rsquo;re paying him for that endorsement and so on.</p>
<p>And to the extent with Elon Musk,</p>
<p>people see innovation and they see someone</p>
<p>who will put himself out there with sometimes crazy ideas</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s trying to think about the future</p>
<p>and trying to just push things forward</p>
<p>instead of just sitting on whatever money he has now</p>
<p>and just investing it, earning, you know, 6%,</p>
<p>return for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>You know, I think that that&rsquo;s a positive thing.</p>
<p>But I think it doesn&rsquo;t get to the broader policy question.</p>
<p>When people invoke billionaires,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re invoking the specter of inequality and power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not normally the rhetoric that I use</p>
<p>because I propose and I use more traditional</p>
<p>socialist rhetoric and terms,</p>
<p>but I think it gets at something real.</p>
<p>So often with these sorts of shorthands we use in politics,</p>
<p>there are, you know, they&rsquo;re imperfect,</p>
<p>but they speak to a real thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they feed a little bit of fun</p>
<p>that folks like AOC and Elon have with each other, creates.</p>
<p>It feeds, it inspires, it serves as a catalyst</p>
<p>for productive discourse.</p>
<p>Okay, speaking of which,</p>
<p>you said you&rsquo;re a fan of Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>Would you classify yourself as a Bernie bro?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the technical definition of a Bernie bro?</p>
<p>Is that a very, it&rsquo;s a subset?</p>
<p>No, no, no, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a sophisticated philosopher, writer,</p>
<p>economic and political thinker.</p>
<p>Of course you would not call yourself a Bernie bro.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine with calling myself a Bernie bro.</p>
<p>Because it was made up by liberal journalists</p>
<p>to smear Bernie and his supporters</p>
<p>during the 2016 campaign,</p>
<p>even though disproportionately his supporters</p>
<p>were like young women in their 20s, you know.</p>
<p>But whatever, I think I&rsquo;ll ride for Bernie.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s worse things in the world than being called a bro,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>What do you like about Bernie Sanders</p>
<p>and to what degree does he represent ideas of socialism?</p>
<p>To what degree does he represent</p>
<p>the more traditional sort of liberal ideas?</p>
<p>I love Bernie.</p>
<p>Most of all, I like his clarity.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s by far the best communicator we have on the left.</p>
<p>He speaks with a moral force.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s relatable.</p>
<p>And he has taken a lot of socialist rhetoric from academia</p>
<p>and brought it down to its core</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s comprehensible for ordinary people</p>
<p>and speaks to their daily lives.</p>
<p>So when Bernie does a speech,</p>
<p>people can finish his lines</p>
<p>because they know what he&rsquo;s gonna say.</p>
<p>They know what points he&rsquo;s gonna hit.</p>
<p>Because socialism, in my mind,</p>
<p>should not be a complicated thing.</p>
<p>Now, when we get to more abstract discussions</p>
<p>about what a future system would look like,</p>
<p>when we get to the policy trade-offs today,</p>
<p>I think we need to put on a different hat.</p>
<p>We should embrace all sorts of nuance</p>
<p>and contradiction and complication.</p>
<p>When it comes to the core moral and ethical appeal,</p>
<p>I think Bernie grasps that and how to communicate it.</p>
<p>Now, Bernie Sanders was politicized a very long time ago.</p>
<p>I actually once told him, I&rsquo;ve only met him a few times,</p>
<p>but one time I joked that in his book,</p>
<p>he mentioned that one politicizing moment in his life</p>
<p>was when the Brooklyn Dodgers left town</p>
<p>and he was devastated because he was a Dodgers fan</p>
<p>from Brooklyn.</p>
<p>And I said, this is like 2020 campaign.</p>
<p>This may be 2019.</p>
<p>I said, Bernie, you&rsquo;re running for president.</p>
<p>You do not need to keep reminding people of your age.</p>
<p>But he was politicized</p>
<p>through the Young People&rsquo;s Socialist League,</p>
<p>which was an old offshoot</p>
<p>of the Norm Thomas Socialist Party of America.</p>
<p>So very old school socialist tradition.</p>
<p>Then he was engaged in labor struggles in the sixties.</p>
<p>He was engaged in the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>So he came from this old left generation</p>
<p>that I think just had a more plain spoken,</p>
<p>more rooted way of understanding change and socialism.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, in my mind, polluted by academia</p>
<p>and by some of the turn towards issues of culture</p>
<p>and excessive focus on representation or whatever else.</p>
<p>It was really rooted in something economic in a way.</p>
<p>Then obviously he had all his ideas</p>
<p>and he was also a product of the left</p>
<p>in that he went to Vermont.</p>
<p>He kind of did the back to the land thing.</p>
<p>He was basically not quite a hippie and an affect,</p>
<p>but he was out there trying to farm or whatever</p>
<p>in cold as hell, Northern Vermont.</p>
<p>And then he decided to do politics,</p>
<p>do electoral politics.</p>
<p>And he failed for a long time.</p>
<p>He did third party politics.</p>
<p>He kept losing races.</p>
<p>Eventually he became, by savvy and luck</p>
<p>and things he learned, the mayor of Burlington, Vermont.</p>
<p>And he just kept with the same message.</p>
<p>And in my book, I talk about,</p>
<p>I quote, I think a Bernie speech from the 1970s,</p>
<p>one of his early campaigns.</p>
<p>And I compared it to a Bernie speech</p>
<p>during his 2016 campaign.</p>
<p>It was virtually identical.</p>
<p>Millionaires was swapped with millionaires and billionaires,</p>
<p>speaking of billionaires, which is beautiful.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something great</p>
<p>to what he offered American politics.</p>
<p>And also all around the world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a socialist pole in politics,</p>
<p>whether you agree with it or not.</p>
<p>And all these countries in Europe and any rich country,</p>
<p>Japan and so on.</p>
<p>And the US really didn&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>The furthest left you could go was like,</p>
<p>Chris Hayes and MSNBC or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very glad that there&rsquo;s a socialist pole.</p>
<p>And I think we have Bernie to thank for it.</p>
<p>To the extent that a lot of self-described socialists</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think Bernie is a real socialist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in part because he stays grounded</p>
<p>in people&rsquo;s day-to-day lives and struggles.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he thinks often the way that I do</p>
<p>and other people more disconnected</p>
<p>or step or move from day-to-day politics.</p>
<p>Think about the future contours of a socialist society</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>But I think he&rsquo;s morally committed</p>
<p>to a egalitarian different sort of future.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think he, at least I haven&rsquo;t heard him</p>
<p>talk about sort of this big, broad history and future.</p>
<p>So the Marxist ideology and so on.</p>
<p>Not that he&rsquo;s afraid of it or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not how he thinks about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think he&rsquo;s a practical thinker.</p>
<p>And also, yeah, he is running,</p>
<p>even if he should be afraid of it too,</p>
<p>because he is a major politician running for president.</p>
<p>I think what people want is they want,</p>
<p>they want the left wing of the possible.</p>
<p>And I, or at least the segment of the party</p>
<p>that was voting for him,</p>
<p>the Democratic Party is voting for him.</p>
<p>They wanted something that was a step or two removed</p>
<p>from what they had now and was visionary,</p>
<p>but not so far removed that it seemed like a scary leap.</p>
<p>And I think we lost a chance in 2016</p>
<p>to elect someone that I think would have beaten Trump</p>
<p>or at the very least would have been close.</p>
<p>Do you think the Democrats screwed him over?</p>
<p>Yes, not in the way of deliberate or direct vote rigging,</p>
<p>but they put their thumb on the scale for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not even conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this stuff in the debates about Clinton,</p>
<p>Clinton&rsquo;s people being fed questions and whatever else.</p>
<p>And just the tone of the media,</p>
<p>the media was extremely dismissive and hostile to him.</p>
<p>I love that Bernie still does a Fox News town hall</p>
<p>with his, they&rsquo;re just him speaking to the people</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not afraid of going on any sort of outlet</p>
<p>and making his case.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of the liberal media in particular</p>
<p>always had it out for Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>What was the, cause that was really annoying.</p>
<p>That was really annoying how dismissive they were.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that in some other candidates,</p>
<p>like they were dismissive towards Andrew Yang</p>
<p>in that same way.</p>
<p>So forget the ideology.</p>
<p>Why are they so smug sometimes towards certain candidates?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Cause I think that&rsquo;s actually at the core to a degree</p>
<p>if Democrats or any party fails, that it&rsquo;s that smugness.</p>
<p>Cause people see through that.</p>
<p>I think a lot of these people are friends,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t know each other, they&rsquo;re friends</p>
<p>cause they went to the same schools.</p>
<p>They know the same people.</p>
<p>They have the same broad, just ideology and worldview.</p>
<p>So they had a sense of what the democratic party should be</p>
<p>and who should be running and who is going to win.</p>
<p>And also what was serious and unserious.</p>
<p>So Bernie would say some things about the world</p>
<p>that objectively to a lot of people seemed correct</p>
<p>or at least pretty close to correct.</p>
<p>And a journalist would just look at him</p>
<p>like he was from outer space.</p>
<p>To some extent, this also happens to people on the right.</p>
<p>People on the right often say things that I find repulsive</p>
<p>or just wrong, but there&rsquo;s parts of the media</p>
<p>that would describe their certain views as illegitimate</p>
<p>or outside this boundaries of acceptable conversation.</p>
<p>I think there should be a few things outside</p>
<p>the boundary of acceptable conversation,</p>
<p>hate speech and so on.</p>
<p>But like there&rsquo;s this attempt to say</p>
<p>their views are illegitimate</p>
<p>and therefore anyone who votes for them</p>
<p>for any reason is illegitimate too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one reason why I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fueled a lot of resentment</p>
<p>and will ultimately end up fueling</p>
<p>the extremes of American politics</p>
<p>and people feel like they&rsquo;re not being listened to.</p>
<p>And some of it is also style of speaking and personality</p>
<p>where if you&rsquo;re not willing to sort of play</p>
<p>kind of a game of civility or there&rsquo;s like a proper way</p>
<p>of speaking if you&rsquo;re a Democrat,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not doing that kind of proper way of speaking</p>
<p>and people dismiss you.</p>
<p>I think in certain sense, whatever you feel about him,</p>
<p>people dismiss Donald Trump for the same reason,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s the style of speaking,</p>
<p>the personality of the person,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s not playing by the rules of polite society,</p>
<p>of polite politician society and so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really, that troubles me</p>
<p>because it feels like solutions,</p>
<p>the great leaders will not be polite in the way,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to behave</p>
<p>in the way they&rsquo;re supposed to behave.</p>
<p>And I just wish the media was at least open-minded to that,</p>
<p>like, which I guess gives me hope about the new media,</p>
<p>which is like more distributed citizen media, right?</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re more open-minded to the revolutionary,</p>
<p>to the outsiders, right?</p>
<p>I actually first, I really like Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>I first heard him in conversation with Tom Hartman.</p>
<p>He had these like weekly conversations</p>
<p>and just the authenticity from the guy,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know any context,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know, honestly,</p>
<p>he was a democratic socialist or anything.</p>
<p>The authenticity of the human being was really refreshing.</p>
<p>And when he, I guess, decided to run for president,</p>
<p>that was really strange, I was like,</p>
<p>surely this person has no chance.</p>
<p>Just like he seemed too authentic,</p>
<p>he seemed to, like he&rsquo;s not going to be effective</p>
<p>at playing the game of politics.</p>
<p>So it was very inspiring to me to see that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to be good</p>
<p>at playing the game of politics.</p>
<p>You can actually have a chance of winning.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was really inspiring to see.</p>
<p>Um, what about some of the other popular candidates?</p>
<p>What do you think about AOC?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she self-identifies as a socialist or not.</p>
<p>She does self-identify as a democratic socialist.</p>
<p>I think she was a very inspiring figure</p>
<p>for a lot of people.</p>
<p>She was kind of out of this Bernie wave</p>
<p>with the first set of Bernie candidates in 2018</p>
<p>that identified with him</p>
<p>instead of the Democratic Party establishment.</p>
<p>I think that she&rsquo;s still developing as a politician,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very difficult when you&rsquo;re in a deep blue district</p>
<p>and when you don&rsquo;t often have to worry about re-election</p>
<p>or talk to, but modulate your rhetoric</p>
<p>to win over swing voters in your district,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re immediately a national and cultural figure.</p>
<p>So AOC basically goes from her views,</p>
<p>which are compelling in my mind,</p>
<p>a lot of her programmatic views are compelling,</p>
<p>wins her district, and then has her own rhetoric,</p>
<p>which to me, compared to Bernie,</p>
<p>owes itself more to the academic left</p>
<p>and the way that a lot of the left has learned to talk.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean academic in the sense</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s like a Marxist or whatever else,</p>
<p>but academic in the way that she may be using, at times,</p>
<p>like confusing language to convey basic points</p>
<p>when she gets into the language of intersectionality</p>
<p>and whatever else.</p>
<p>Especially in the context of cultural issues and stuff.</p>
<p>Exactly, instead of just the plain spoken Bernie,</p>
<p>like, yeah, discrimination is wrong.</p>
<p>If you ask me about a cultural issue,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come down on the same side as AOC,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, nine times out of 10,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll try to root it into just basic,</p>
<p>like, yeah, treat people with respect,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll treat you with respect,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the way we should govern our civic sphere.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t need to talk about intersectionality</p>
<p>to, I think, get that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that rhetoric.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s not just a regular congressperson</p>
<p>in a deep blue district,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s also a national and international,</p>
<p>cultural and political figure.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s now a spokesperson,</p>
<p>because of largely like a media event</p>
<p>of her surprising, upset election,</p>
<p>and her being young and being really connected</p>
<p>to this post-Bernie moment.</p>
<p>And I think amid these constant,</p>
<p>one, attacks on her from the right,</p>
<p>and also this media attention,</p>
<p>and this notoriety,</p>
<p>she hasn&rsquo;t really modulated or adjusted her audience,</p>
<p>her rhetoric,</p>
<p>and how do you win over someone</p>
<p>who really hates a lot of your ideas,</p>
<p>but might actually believe in some of your policies?</p>
<p>And I think she&rsquo;s been ineffective,</p>
<p>quite frankly,</p>
<p>in the last year making that transition.</p>
<p>Whereas I think other politicians</p>
<p>who are not so far left,</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t identify as socialists,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say a John Fetterman,</p>
<p>has managed to become more effective.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a question of character,</p>
<p>or whatever else.</p>
<p>And I like AOC,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t wanna put it so harshly.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of it has to do</p>
<p>with her being a congressperson</p>
<p>in a deep blue district,</p>
<p>and Fetterman running for statewide office</p>
<p>in a quote-unquote purple state.</p>
<p>But at her best,</p>
<p>at her best, she does it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like glimmers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>what sport are you a biggest fan of?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a sports analogy.</p>
<p>I like the NFL.</p>
<p>I mean, NFL&rsquo;s up there,</p>
<p>soccer&rsquo;s up there,</p>
<p>but probably UFC.</p>
<p>Okay, well,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give you a good analogy for any of those,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a raw prospect.</p>
<p>Someone who shows glimmers of hope,</p>
<p>so they were drafted really high,</p>
<p>and then they bounce from team to team,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m clinging on to my AOC stock,</p>
<p>but I think that she needs to be self-critical enough,</p>
<p>and her team needs to be self-critical enough</p>
<p>to know that the goal is not merely</p>
<p>to be a national cultural figure</p>
<p>and win a re-election in your deep blue district.</p>
<p>The goal has to be to become</p>
<p>truly a national political figure,</p>
<p>which will require changes.</p>
<p>A unifier and inspiring figure</p>
<p>about the ideas that she represents.</p>
<p>Definitely, and she has other things against her.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m obviously class-focused,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no denying, I think,</p>
<p>that some of the hostility to her is sexism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rooted in, I think,</p>
<p>people wanting to see her fail or whatever else,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s only some of it.</p>
<p>I think some of it, otherwise,</p>
<p>is her struggling to relate to people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have a lot of her starting points</p>
<p>as far as moral and ethical beliefs.</p>
<p>Yeah, but she&rsquo;s actually great at flourishing</p>
<p>in all the attacks she&rsquo;s getting.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s doing a good job with that,</p>
<p>and a lot of those attacks would break me,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m being honest.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>The amount of fire she&rsquo;s under.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t want that to become a drug</p>
<p>to where you just get good at being a national figure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s constantly in the fights</p>
<p>and are using that for attention and so on.</p>
<p>You still wanna be the unifier,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a tricky, tricky switch.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a chance there&rsquo;s a world</p>
<p>in which she&rsquo;s able to modulate it enough</p>
<p>to be a unifier and run for president, and win?</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s very far away from being able to do that.</p>
<p>I think that even other politicians</p>
<p>that are also polarizing within the squad</p>
<p>in terms of what they say or their ideas,</p>
<p>whatever else, are very effective communicators,</p>
<p>Ilhan Omar and others.</p>
<p>I think AOC, I mean, that&rsquo;s my hope, right?</p>
<p>My hope is that someone like AOC could.</p>
<p>The last year-plus has not been extremely promising</p>
<p>in my mind, in part because she&rsquo;s become,</p>
<p>or she&rsquo;s continued to position herself</p>
<p>as a lightning rod cultural figure,</p>
<p>whereas I think a national political figure</p>
<p>needs to pick their spots and also pick their moment</p>
<p>for changing their rhetoric and adjusting to their audience.</p>
<p>And I think she does it in certain environments,</p>
<p>but that needs to be your national message</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>You need to be speaking towards the not already converted.</p>
<p>And I think Bernie does that.</p>
<p>Bernie strips his politics down to the basics.</p>
<p>So I agree with you spiritually,</p>
<p>but we also have an example</p>
<p>of Donald Trump winning the presidency.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t some of the game of politics</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s separate from the policy,</p>
<p>being able to engage in rhetoric that leads to outrage</p>
<p>and then walking through that fire with grace?</p>
<p>First of all, I think Trump has kind of a unique personality</p>
<p>in American history.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to compare anyone to Trump.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think AOC is comparable</p>
<p>in terms of the uniqueness</p>
<p>in the political system we&rsquo;re in or no?</p>
<p>I think Trump is much more of a firebrand</p>
<p>anti-establishment force in that,</p>
<p>and I mean this negatively for what it&rsquo;s worth,</p>
<p>because I disagree with Trump,</p>
<p>but he was willing to set fire</p>
<p>to the Republican establishment, right?</p>
<p>He was able to self-fund largely his campaign</p>
<p>and he already was a media figure without them.</p>
<p>AOC has been much more cautious</p>
<p>for the Democratic Party establishment</p>
<p>in part because she&rsquo;s not trying to run</p>
<p>a national political campaign right now for the outside,</p>
<p>like a 5% chance they&rsquo;re gonna be president,</p>
<p>let me set fire to everything.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s trying to help people and help her constituents</p>
<p>through the game of getting committee appointments</p>
<p>and getting wins in the margins.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s understandable for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>But in the process, I think what&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between AOC and a progressive Democrat?</p>
<p>During 2016, it used to be pretty easy to say</p>
<p>the difference between the Berniecrats</p>
<p>and a progressive Democrat, right?</p>
<p>Because we were establishing our own outside third force</p>
<p>in American politics where you could knock on the door</p>
<p>of a lot of people who would end up voting for Trump</p>
<p>and they would say, oh, I have a lot of respect</p>
<p>for Bernie or whatever,</p>
<p>and they were still gonna not vote for him.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t considered part</p>
<p>of the Democratic Party milieu.</p>
<p>I think now with AOC, there&rsquo;s a much closer association</p>
<p>of AOC in our policies with ordinary Democrats</p>
<p>where she needs to draw stronger distinctions.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t need to do it like Trump did</p>
<p>with just, man, I forgot all of them,</p>
<p>though I found some of them amusing in the moment,</p>
<p>like all his nicknames about Lion Ted Cruz</p>
<p>and the rest, you know?</p>
<p>But I do feel like she needs to, yes,</p>
<p>differentiate herself a bit more,</p>
<p>but then also just keep her language simple.</p>
<p>Trump was more complex than Bernie in his literal language,</p>
<p>but he was repetitive and there was kind of a rhythm</p>
<p>and a cadence to Trump&rsquo;s speech.</p>
<p>I think AOC needs to, like Bernie,</p>
<p>reduce her rhetoric down to a couple key lines</p>
<p>and signatures and focus her politics not on 20 issues,</p>
<p>but on three or four most important issues</p>
<p>and have that message discipline.</p>
<p>Bernie will do an interview with you,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll write down, I hope you do interview Bernie,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;ll write down like five things,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, yeah, I&rsquo;m only gonna talk</p>
<p>about these five things.</p>
<p>Ask me about this?</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m talking about these five things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a message discipline</p>
<p>that Bernie has been exemplary on, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s learned, that could be developed.</p>
<p>I think she could develop it.</p>
<p>Listen, I hope, I&rsquo;m answering your question,</p>
<p>I think, not the way I should answer it,</p>
<p>being someone broadcasting to people on the left</p>
<p>and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I hope AOC goes in that direction.</p>
<p>I just think that she has a lot going against her</p>
<p>just because she&rsquo;s already a national figure,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s in a deeper blue district.</p>
<p>But we need to root our politics then</p>
<p>in working class people and a lot of districts</p>
<p>that, I don&rsquo;t know, the type of kitchen table conversations</p>
<p>are, I hate that cliche, but I just used it,</p>
<p>but a lot of these conversations are just different</p>
<p>in their tone and cadence,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just a question of, you know,</p>
<p>Fetterman or Tim Ryan in Ohio</p>
<p>and kind of just white working class voters.</p>
<p>I mean, working class voters of any race.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s their day-to-day needs</p>
<p>and the day-to-day things they wanna talk about</p>
<p>is just at a different plane</p>
<p>than, you know, a Met Gala cultural statement.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s clear that you respect and love her</p>
<p>and would like to see different ways.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s young, so the different trajectories</p>
<p>that she could develop</p>
<p>that would ultimately make her a good candidate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just looking at odds here for,</p>
<p>and I disagree with them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m buying AOC stock here, given these odds.</p>
<p>So in terms of Democratic,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna win the 2024 election?</p>
<p>So that includes running and winning.</p>
<p>On the Democrat side is 18% chance for Biden,</p>
<p>so 7% chance for Kamala Harris,</p>
<p>Gavin Newsom at 6%,</p>
<p>Michelle Obama at 3%,</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton at 2%,</p>
<p>and AOC at 1.5%.</p>
<p>And then Bernie at 1%.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>I would not buy AOC at that mark.</p>
<p>I would buy Biden like crazy, though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a gambling man,</p>
<p>but I would totally toss a G at Biden at that amount.</p>
<p>AOC at 1.5% chance?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t think she runs.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think she runs, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Bernie will primary Biden either.</p>
<p>I mean, if Biden doesn&rsquo;t run,</p>
<p>then obviously it&rsquo;s an open field,</p>
<p>but I just feel like-</p>
<p>Do you think Biden runs?</p>
<p>Yes, I think Biden probably runs.</p>
<p>Oh man, oh boy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incumbent president,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an incumbent president,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s very hard to imagine</p>
<p>another Democrat being able to do better than him.</p>
<p>All right, what about the competition?</p>
<p>I think Donald Trump is the best thing</p>
<p>for the Democrats, period,</p>
<p>just because it would create this turnout mechanism,</p>
<p>this excitement around, we have to stop Donald Trump.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s attacking DeSantis.</p>
<p>I mean, already he&rsquo;s trying the sanctimonious thing,</p>
<p>but yeah, he&rsquo;s, I kind of like, yeah,</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s kind of like the Don King of American politics.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting what kind</p>
<p>of dynamic chaos he&rsquo;s created.</p>
<p>It probably led to more people being interested in politics.</p>
<p>Well, almost guaranteed it led to more people</p>
<p>being interested in politics,</p>
<p>but maybe not in a healthy way.</p>
<p>Maybe it created an unhealthy relationship with politics,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s created more partisanship.</p>
<p>For me, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with partnership.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what kind of partnership.</p>
<p>So I think Trump has cultivated,</p>
<p>like a lot of right populists,</p>
<p>a relationship with his supporters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a leader-follower relationship</p>
<p>in a way that doesn&rsquo;t actually enhance</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s knowledge of politics and the issues,</p>
<p>but actually just leads them to follow the party line.</p>
<p>Ideally, I think socialist politics and politics</p>
<p>on the left should be something different.</p>
<p>Eugene Debs, the great American socialist leader</p>
<p>of the late 19th and early 20th century,</p>
<p>used to say, you know, I&rsquo;m not your Moses.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t promise to lead you to the promised land</p>
<p>because if I can lead you there</p>
<p>and you just follow me there,</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s just gonna lead you straight out</p>
<p>as soon as I&rsquo;m gone.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s something nice</p>
<p>about that kind of anti-blind following,</p>
<p>leader-follower kind of dynamic on the left at its best.</p>
<p>That said, in the way at least the political race</p>
<p>in the United States has turned out,</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s turned into a bit of entertainment.</p>
<p>And there, having personalities and characters</p>
<p>is really important.</p>
<p>So in terms of policy and actual leadership,</p>
<p>yes, maybe having a leader,</p>
<p>like an authoritarian big leader is not good,</p>
<p>but maybe for the race it is, for the drama of it.</p>
<p>You just want to have drama and attention</p>
<p>on people who are actually going to turn out</p>
<p>to be good leaders.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weird balance to strike.</p>
<p>Yeah, earned media is what they always talk about, right?</p>
<p>In political campaigns, like, you know,</p>
<p>the more you can get on TV, the better.</p>
<p>Even like, I really like Vederman.</p>
<p>He just won his campaign.</p>
<p>But a good part of his early campaign,</p>
<p>he had pivoted from talking about issues</p>
<p>to just talking about Dr. Oz living in New Jersey</p>
<p>and kind of having the troll campaign against him,</p>
<p>which I found amusing.</p>
<p>But also, it was effective, obviously, he won.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s a bit depressing</p>
<p>because I would have rather a whole campaign cycle</p>
<p>about healthcare and jobs and other issues.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and the hope is that people just get better</p>
<p>at that kind of social media communication.</p>
<p>So I do actually think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about doing political speeches</p>
<p>that makes you sound less authentic,</p>
<p>because you have to, like, do so many of them.</p>
<p>It must be exhausting to, like,</p>
<p>day after day after day, make the speech.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to start sort of replaying the same stuff</p>
<p>over and over, as opposed to actually thinking</p>
<p>about the words that are coming out of your mouth.</p>
<p>And then the public will know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not really being that authentic.</p>
<p>Even though you believe those things, it&rsquo;s just tough.</p>
<p>I just wish they didn&rsquo;t have to constantly do speeches.</p>
<p>So I think that the fact that Bernie&rsquo;s speeches</p>
<p>very clearly, like, came out of,</p>
<p>if not directly his own pen,</p>
<p>but his own rhetoric over the years,</p>
<p>and he kind of wrote it, seemed authentic.</p>
<p>Even if he was repeating it.</p>
<p>And then Trump, his just wild improvisation,</p>
<p>I think people found real, you know, in a certain way.</p>
<p>And I would love for the left, more generally,</p>
<p>to tap into some of that anti-establishment sentiment,</p>
<p>but obviously do it in a way that&rsquo;s productive,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t blame immigrants</p>
<p>or whatever else for problems,</p>
<p>but, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of built on a different basis.</p>
<p>But people are fed up, for good reason,</p>
<p>with a lot of conventional politics,</p>
<p>and we need to speak to that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;ll only be the right</p>
<p>that is taking advantage of those people&rsquo;s anger.</p>
<p>Well, I almost forgot to ask you about China.</p>
<p>So both historically, we talked about the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>but what lessons do you draw</p>
<p>from the implementation of socialism and communism</p>
<p>in Maoist China and modern China?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the good and the bad?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s very similar to the Soviet case,</p>
<p>in that socialism came to China</p>
<p>through not a base of organized workers</p>
<p>and a capitalist country</p>
<p>at a certain level of development and so on,</p>
<p>but it came through the countryside</p>
<p>and in conditions of civil war,</p>
<p>strife, Japanese invasion, and whatever else.</p>
<p>And Mao built his base in the peasantry,</p>
<p>then came down to the city to govern</p>
<p>and try to build a base and rule over workers.</p>
<p>So it was kind of an inversion of classic socialist theory.</p>
<p>Now, the same thing that I said before about Stalin</p>
<p>and assessing the Soviet Union has to apply here,</p>
<p>because obviously, I oppose authoritarianism</p>
<p>and all sorts of moral condemnations I should do.</p>
<p>But to look at what the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>actually accomplished,</p>
<p>I think we kind of need to take a step backwards</p>
<p>from our moral opposition</p>
<p>to the means in which they accomplished it</p>
<p>and just look at it developmentally.</p>
<p>China benefited greatly</p>
<p>from the Communist Party&rsquo;s implementation</p>
<p>of basic education and healthcare.</p>
<p>So in a lot of China,</p>
<p>you had one of the conditions of women</p>
<p>were absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>There was still foot binding</p>
<p>and all sorts of terrible backward practice.</p>
<p>You had a huge, vast majority of the population</p>
<p>that was illiterate without any access to basic education,</p>
<p>and you had no health access,</p>
<p>especially in the countryside.</p>
<p>So those are the three good things that China did,</p>
<p>improve the status of women,</p>
<p>get everyone into primary education,</p>
<p>and improve the lot of healthcare.</p>
<p>Besides for that,</p>
<p>their agricultural campaign was a failure,</p>
<p>just like Stalin&rsquo;s for many of the same reasons</p>
<p>I mentioned before.</p>
<p>The Great Leap Forward and crash industrialization</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really work either.</p>
<p>In a way, is China better than India or other countries</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t have the basic education</p>
<p>and the strong state authority</p>
<p>and the health improvements and whatever?</p>
<p>I think maybe,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s why we need to sometimes go beyond</p>
<p>just economic measures of success.</p>
<p>Because if you told me tomorrow,</p>
<p>the US will grow at 3% if we maintain democracy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll grow at 8%, 9%, everyone will be wealthier</p>
<p>if we move to some sort of authoritarian government.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re asking the wrong question</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna make your decision based on growth, right?</p>
<p>Because it has to be based on some sort of principle.</p>
<p>But the same dynamic of,</p>
<p>from the beginning of the Chinese Communist Party,</p>
<p>ruling over people,</p>
<p>emerging from the outside through armed conflicts</p>
<p>and ruling over ordinary Chinese people have continued.</p>
<p>Since Deng Xiaoping,</p>
<p>the policies have been better economically.</p>
<p>And often at times, not always,</p>
<p>the technocratic governance has been quite good.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the party</p>
<p>has a democratic mandate</p>
<p>or should have the right to govern as they see fit.</p>
<p>Because clearly, it doesn&rsquo;t have that mandate</p>
<p>in swaths of the country</p>
<p>or in places like Hong Kong or elsewhere.</p>
<p>But to me, nothing the Chinese Communist Party does</p>
<p>has anything to do with socialism.</p>
<p>I think even by their own definition today,</p>
<p>it really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sort of nationalist, authoritarian,</p>
<p>developmental state that has done some good things</p>
<p>to improve the living standards of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Other things that were counterproductive.</p>
<p>And as a democratic socialist,</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t support that state,</p>
<p>but I also hope that the US and Biden</p>
<p>will find a way to avoid intense rivalry</p>
<p>and competition economically,</p>
<p>spilling over into something worse.</p>
<p>From a democratic socialist perspective,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s one policy or one or two ways</p>
<p>if you could fix China?</p>
<p>If you took over China,</p>
<p>what would you like to see change?</p>
<p>Well, the democratic part comes before the socialist part.</p>
<p>So I would say there needs to be</p>
<p>multi-party elections in China</p>
<p>and state censorship and control over the press,</p>
<p>in other words, needs to be done with.</p>
<p>As far as their immediate economic policy,</p>
<p>I think the idea of maintaining strong state control</p>
<p>of certain commanding heights of the economy</p>
<p>while liberalizing other spheres has done quite well</p>
<p>in China&rsquo;s case, lifting people out of poverty.</p>
<p>But again, there&rsquo;s something really lost in society,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s getting wealthier,</p>
<p>if ordinary people don&rsquo;t have the ability</p>
<p>to participate in dissent freely.</p>
<p>And the Chinese authorities have allowed some,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not North Korea,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a totally totalitarian state.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been workplace protests,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been all sorts of local anti-corruption protests</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>but the government decides what&rsquo;s permitted</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s not at what particular moment.</p>
<p>And I think the long run,</p>
<p>even if it can survive,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a better way to do things,</p>
<p>which is just quite simply a democracy.</p>
<p>The thing is though,</p>
<p>the lessons of history that China is looking at,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this dark aspect.</p>
<p>So building on top of the fact</p>
<p>that it seems like under Stalin and under Mao,</p>
<p>under Stalin, the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>and under Mao, China has seen a lot of economic growth.</p>
<p>And then one dark aspect of that,</p>
<p>while under the Great Leap Forward,</p>
<p>you have upwards of 70 million people dead.</p>
<p>Today, I think there&rsquo;s a large number of people</p>
<p>who admire Stalin and admire Mao.</p>
<p>What they admire is the stability and the strong leadership.</p>
<p>So, and there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who miss the Soviet Union, right?</p>
<p>The reason why they miss it</p>
<p>is that it was a system they knew.</p>
<p>It provided the basics of their livelihood.</p>
<p>Then afterwards, like look at Russia in the 90s,</p>
<p>people were in chaos,</p>
<p>and the Communist Party</p>
<p>had a huge amount of support democratically.</p>
<p>Anti-democratic measures had to be taken,</p>
<p>ironically, against the Communist Party</p>
<p>to keep it from regaining more of a foothold in Russia.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t need that trade-off.</p>
<p>We could have a form of,</p>
<p>imagine if Russia went to a system</p>
<p>closer to social democracy</p>
<p>that maintained the stability that people wanted,</p>
<p>the welfare state that people wanted,</p>
<p>but restructured the economy in not a shock way,</p>
<p>but in a way that made sense</p>
<p>and that ordinary people felt ownership of</p>
<p>instead of just oligarchs</p>
<p>who were former Communist Party bureaucracy</p>
<p>just dividing up the country for themselves.</p>
<p>I think the same thing in China.</p>
<p>First of all, certainly from the West,</p>
<p>the U.S. government and people in the U.S.</p>
<p>should have no say over what should happen in China, right?</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party has more authentic authority</p>
<p>than any of us do in the country.</p>
<p>But I think that the fears of stability</p>
<p>that a lot of Chinese people have,</p>
<p>why I would imagine that even in a democratic election,</p>
<p>the Communist Party might have majority support</p>
<p>is because they fear the unknown, they fear collapse.</p>
<p>That was one of the big lessons of the Soviet collapse, right?</p>
<p>Do you want China divided into five, six states?</p>
<p>Do you want economic turmoil?</p>
<p>Do you want mass immediate privatization?</p>
<p>Do you want whatever welfare state</p>
<p>you have destroyed and so on?</p>
<p>I think people are right to have those fears,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a different route towards democratization</p>
<p>that maintains stability, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different routes that you could have democracy.</p>
<p>Not every country had to go down the route of Yugoslavia</p>
<p>and the USSR and so on.</p>
<p>You are the founder of the magazine Jacobin,</p>
<p>of which I am a subscriber.</p>
<p>I recommend everybody subscribe,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re on the left or the right.</p>
<p>The magazine does tend to lean left.</p>
<p>Does it officially say it&rsquo;s socialist?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a socialist publication.</p>
<p>We try to be interesting.</p>
<p>We try to have articles that have debates</p>
<p>and contestation and whatever else,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re definitely, we&rsquo;re all socialists.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a lot of really interesting articles,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;d definitely recommend that people subscribe, support.</p>
<p>The product of the 21st century,</p>
<p>only subscribe to the digital version,</p>
<p>but I guess there&rsquo;s also paper version.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s like 70,000 subscribers in print.</p>
<p>In print? Yeah.</p>
<p>Does it come on a scroll?</p>
<p>Do they even publish paper magazines anymore?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna mail you a bunch of copies.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s perfect bound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s long issues.</p>
<p>Our Jacobin&rsquo;s publisher, Remake Air 4 of us recently</p>
<p>did a redesign of the publication,</p>
<p>so it looks really good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up there in the design award competition range.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great, yeah. Nice, it&rsquo;s sexy.</p>
<p>I can show it off to all my friends, look.</p>
<p>Put it in your coffee table.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to read it.</p>
<p>First, I need to get a coffee table,</p>
<p>but yes, I&rsquo;ll get both.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a respectable adult,</p>
<p>listen, I&rsquo;ve upgraded my life.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a couch, I don&rsquo;t think, ever,</p>
<p>so I got a couch recently,</p>
<p>because somebody told me that serious adults have a couch,</p>
<p>and I also got a TV,</p>
<p>because serious adults have a couch and a TV,</p>
<p>and as you can see, it&rsquo;s been here for many months,</p>
<p>and I still haven&rsquo;t unboxed it,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m trying to learn how to be an adult,</p>
<p>looking up on YouTube how to be an adult,</p>
<p>and learning slowly.</p>
<p>After that, I&rsquo;ll look into this whole leisure thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, what&rsquo;s the origin of Jackman?</p>
<p>What was the idea?</p>
<p>What was the mission, and what&rsquo;s the origin story?</p>
<p>So I started Jackman when I was between my sophomore</p>
<p>and junior year of college.</p>
<p>Basically, I was already a socialist.</p>
<p>I was involved in the Democratic Socialists of America.</p>
<p>I was in the youth section,</p>
<p>the Young Democratic Socialists.</p>
<p>I was editing their kind of youth online magazine</p>
<p>called The Activists back then,</p>
<p>and to be honest, I had my ideology.</p>
<p>I had my views.</p>
<p>I had a group of people around me</p>
<p>that we would debate together and occasionally write</p>
<p>for this other publication, The Activist, and so on,</p>
<p>and yeah, just a product of creative ignorance</p>
<p>in the sense that I knew I had the capacity</p>
<p>to maybe pull off an issue or two.</p>
<p>I just had no idea how long I would keep doing it,</p>
<p>and it just eventually consumed my life slowly but surely.</p>
<p>Like, I had different plans for my future, kind of,</p>
<p>but I ended up just being a magazine publisher.</p>
<p>I literally didn&rsquo;t know what a magazine publisher was,</p>
<p>but it just kind of happened.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hardest part about running a magazine?</p>
<p>Well, the hardest part is obviously the things,</p>
<p>just like any enterprise, right,</p>
<p>the things beyond your control.</p>
<p>You could put out something that you think is great</p>
<p>or interesting, but then you need the feedback</p>
<p>of people actually subscribing to it,</p>
<p>and you occasionally encounter periods</p>
<p>where you feel like you&rsquo;re doing your best work,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not getting the audience response,</p>
<p>and I think you just need the kind of,</p>
<p>the self-confidence to just keep doing it,</p>
<p>and obviously, if you&rsquo;re totally obscure and crazy</p>
<p>and way off the mark,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna build that audience,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of publications have tried to,</p>
<p>same thing, I guess, goes with YouTube shows,</p>
<p>whatever else, they try to adapt</p>
<p>to what everyone else is doing right away</p>
<p>when they don&rsquo;t achieve success,</p>
<p>whereas for me, the early issues of Jackman</p>
<p>got very little resonance,</p>
<p>and it took a while for it to build into something,</p>
<p>but a lot of it was just the confidence</p>
<p>to just keep going and keep publishing</p>
<p>what I would wanna read,</p>
<p>and just hope that I&rsquo;m not so much of a weirdo,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m the only one.</p>
<p>Is there some pressure that you could speak to</p>
<p>of audience capture?</p>
<p>Because it is a socialist publication,</p>
<p>you have a fan base, a readership base.</p>
<p>Is there times you feel pressured</p>
<p>not to say a certain thing, not to call out bullshit?</p>
<p>Not to criticize certain candidates,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Yes, definitely, of course.</p>
<p>I, myself, am looser on the self-censorship</p>
<p>than other people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only because I&rsquo;ve gotten this far</p>
<p>just shooting from the hip or whatever.</p>
<p>And occasionally, you&rsquo;ll come to a rash judgment.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll speak too soon or complain about something too soon,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have to either apologize</p>
<p>or reconsider whatever else.</p>
<p>But on a host of issues,</p>
<p>I have views that maybe not all of the left has,</p>
<p>but I know that the core of my politics</p>
<p>is a politics against oppression,</p>
<p>against exploitation,</p>
<p>against all the things that we talked about.</p>
<p>And if you know that&rsquo;s at the core of your politics,</p>
<p>then you could maybe say,</p>
<p>you know what, I don&rsquo;t think the left</p>
<p>should respond to the real racist</p>
<p>in the still right in the world</p>
<p>by adopting an excessively racialized rhetoric.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>I fundamentally just am a universalist,</p>
<p>and I believe that people,</p>
<p>no matter where their backgrounds are and so on,</p>
<p>kind of want the same things for themselves</p>
<p>and for their families.</p>
<p>And I feel like a lot of the left,</p>
<p>or some of the left, not even the far left,</p>
<p>more like the center left,</p>
<p>has adopted kind of a stance saying,</p>
<p>oh, we need to talk about white privilege</p>
<p>or white Karens or white guys</p>
<p>or old white guys doing this or whatever else.</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s not only wrong in a moral sense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s counterproductive.</p>
<p>Because the last thing I want is a young white teenager</p>
<p>who feels unrepresented politically</p>
<p>and wants to be a part of maybe even the left</p>
<p>to feel like, oh, I should think more about my identity.</p>
<p>No, the whole point of anti-racist politics</p>
<p>is that we want to live in a world</p>
<p>where me and you can go around the corner and get a beer,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not people of two different races getting a beer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just two guys in America getting a beer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to have the type of society</p>
<p>in which there&rsquo;s less of that sort of communal</p>
<p>or racialized identity.</p>
<p>And that was a whole point of a whole generation</p>
<p>of anti-racist struggle.</p>
<p>But now we seem to be kind of reifying it</p>
<p>in the media and in culture and in politics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one issue where I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>kind of banging the drum on this</p>
<p>to the point that it&rsquo;s annoying in certain parts of the left.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s maybe extreme opposition</p>
<p>among socialists, but it&rsquo;s more like,</p>
<p>why do you keep focusing on this?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s focus on our real enemy, the right,</p>
<p>instead of criticizing this part of-</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s really, I&rsquo;m really glad you exist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad you&rsquo;re beating that drum</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>that the left has not had a broader impact</p>
<p>or is not heard by more people that could hear its message</p>
<p>is because the othering, the othering of,</p>
<p>like as if there&rsquo;s two teams, as if it&rsquo;s black and white,</p>
<p>as opposed to having, there&rsquo;s a common humanity</p>
<p>and a common struggle amongst all of us.</p>
<p>You also wrote the book that we mentioned a few times,</p>
<p>The Socialist Manifesto, the case for radical politics</p>
<p>in an era of extreme inequality.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the framework?</p>
<p>What are the key ideas of the book?</p>
<p>So a lot of it&rsquo;s a look at socialism&rsquo;s past,</p>
<p>present and future, basically.</p>
<p>So a lot of it is historical.</p>
<p>The opening chapter uses a pasta sauce factory</p>
<p>as a way to explain certain Marxist concepts,</p>
<p>but also a theory of change,</p>
<p>like how we get from, let&rsquo;s say, pure capitalism</p>
<p>to more regulated, unionized and social democratic systems,</p>
<p>and then beyond social democracy</p>
<p>into my vision of socialism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the first little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a visionary kind of like look</p>
<p>at the future of socialism.</p>
<p>But then I try to explain</p>
<p>why some of the past socialist movements have gone wrong.</p>
<p>Because I think we can&rsquo;t take for granted,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people want to live</p>
<p>in a different or better society,</p>
<p>but they look at past examples and they&rsquo;re skeptical.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s good reason for skepticism.</p>
<p>So I try to explain both the successes of certain systems,</p>
<p>like social democracy,</p>
<p>but also what happened in Russia, China,</p>
<p>and kind of more of a historical overview.</p>
<p>Then the book kind of ends in the present.</p>
<p>It ends with looking at the Bernie Sanders campaign,</p>
<p>why it resonated, looking at some of the problems facing</p>
<p>the US, the UK, other advanced economies,</p>
<p>and why I think the socialist message is still relevant.</p>
<p>Because for the longest time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 33, I became a socialist as a teenager.</p>
<p>And for the longest time,</p>
<p>it seemed like I was just a member of a historical society,</p>
<p>keeping alive an idea</p>
<p>that nobody was interested in anymore.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s heartening to see more young people</p>
<p>interested in the idea,</p>
<p>but we actually need to, I think,</p>
<p>have a clearer sense of what we stand for</p>
<p>and how we make our movement,</p>
<p>like it used to be, more rooted in the working class.</p>
<p>So if anyone rewinds the tape,</p>
<p>they go to when we first started talking</p>
<p>about early socialism,</p>
<p>when I was talking about</p>
<p>the German social democratic workers movement,</p>
<p>or all these different early parties.</p>
<p>I think at various points,</p>
<p>I use the word worker and socialist movement</p>
<p>interchangeably,</p>
<p>because in fact, at the time,</p>
<p>it was pretty interchangeable.</p>
<p>Socialism was the ideology</p>
<p>that had the appeal of the working class movement.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t really separate between the two.</p>
<p>Now, obviously,</p>
<p>socialism&rsquo;s like a fringe ideological concurrent</p>
<p>among a very small minority of the working class,</p>
<p>which is fine,</p>
<p>but we need to get to the point, I think, ideally,</p>
<p>where when people talk about unions</p>
<p>and people protesting and social movements and socialism,</p>
<p>they all kind of are one in the same</p>
<p>as part of the same broad movement.</p>
<p>How did you become a socialist?</p>
<p>What was the personal story</p>
<p>or the idea that took hold in your mind?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m the youngest of five.</p>
<p>I was only one of my family born in the United States.</p>
<p>So it was very obvious to me</p>
<p>that my life outcomes were very different</p>
<p>than life outcomes of my siblings.</p>
<p>So my three older siblings didn&rsquo;t go to college</p>
<p>after high school.</p>
<p>Some of them got their degrees much later on as adults.</p>
<p>But I was from a pretty young age,</p>
<p>had access to a great public school district</p>
<p>and was put on the track that you&rsquo;re gonna go to college.</p>
<p>This is kind of the outcome.</p>
<p>And like I said, even my grandmother was illiterate.</p>
<p>My mom didn&rsquo;t have a lot of educational opportunities</p>
<p>early in her life.</p>
<p>She actually graduated from college the same year I did.</p>
<p>So she later got her kind of degrees and whatever else.</p>
<p>But to me, it was obvious that so much of my life outcomes</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t just a product of hard work or my family&rsquo;s sacrifices</p>
<p>because of course I had the same family as my siblings,</p>
<p>but the product of state institutions helping out,</p>
<p>evening things out.</p>
<p>Public school district, public library,</p>
<p>like all sorts of afterschool programs,</p>
<p>all that was the domain of the state</p>
<p>and I really benefited from it.</p>
<p>So in essence, my core was a social democratic belief.</p>
<p>The state should redistribute a bit,</p>
<p>build public institutions, be an equalizer.</p>
<p>Now how I became a Marxist and a socialist</p>
<p>was much more random.</p>
<p>I was just intellectually interested in it.</p>
<p>And eventually I kind of merged the two together</p>
<p>where I merged together my more pragmatic</p>
<p>and practical interest in day-to-day concerns</p>
<p>and reforms and so on,</p>
<p>with my loftier intellectual interests in Marxism</p>
<p>into the politics I have today,</p>
<p>which I try to kind of balance and do both.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of socialists in the organization</p>
<p>that I joined as a teenager,</p>
<p>the Democratic Socialists of America and elsewhere,</p>
<p>try to do the two,</p>
<p>try to maintain some sort of balance</p>
<p>between here and our vision of the future.</p>
<p>What do you think Marx would say</p>
<p>if he were to read your book,</p>
<p>Socialist Manifesto and do a review?</p>
<p>So I think Marx would say that my vision</p>
<p>of a socialism after capitalism</p>
<p>maintains key elements of what he would,</p>
<p>the commodity form.</p>
<p>So a lot of what Marx was concerned about was</p>
<p>what markets do to human relationships</p>
<p>in a negative sense.</p>
<p>Marx&rsquo;s early writings, especially,</p>
<p>focus a lot on the alienation of labor.</p>
<p>My vision of socialism, at least in the near term,</p>
<p>a lot about it is about decommodifying certain sectors.</p>
<p>So reducing the market in certain sectors</p>
<p>and reducing alienation, but not eliminating it.</p>
<p>It is about eliminating exploitation and oppression.</p>
<p>So knowing Marx and knowing how critical he was</p>
<p>of certain other socialist strands and tendencies,</p>
<p>and he would often write very snarky notes</p>
<p>and letters to people like Engels being like,</p>
<p>this guy, LaSalle, he&rsquo;s a total asshole.</p>
<p>Then he would send a separate note to LaSalle saying,</p>
<p>hey, can I borrow five grand?</p>
<p>This is actually true.</p>
<p>He did the both, I think the same month.</p>
<p>So he would be really good at Twitter is what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Oh, he would be the best at Twitter.</p>
<p>And also he was a journalist before</p>
<p>with his work for the New York Tribune.</p>
<p>He was very clever, very snarky.</p>
<p>He would be awesome at Twitter.</p>
<p>I think him and Elon would have good back and forths,</p>
<p>but I think it would be critical in some parts,</p>
<p>but I think that the strangest part for him</p>
<p>would be reading the historical sections</p>
<p>and seeing the way in which his ideas,</p>
<p>which was fundamentally ideas about human emancipation</p>
<p>were used for evil, for hardship,</p>
<p>in ways that did the opposite of emancipated,</p>
<p>but in some cases, enslaved people.</p>
<p>And I think he would have definitely</p>
<p>not want to be associated with them.</p>
<p>He probably would rather be associated with me than them,</p>
<p>but even then, only begrudgingly.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young folks</p>
<p>in high school, in college,</p>
<p>how to have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or how to change the world?</p>
<p>I think be intellectually curious,</p>
<p>read outside your current beliefs</p>
<p>and understand or read authors on their own terms.</p>
<p>So the worst thing in the world to do is to read anything,</p>
<p>especially work of fiction, but anything,</p>
<p>and try to deduce the author&rsquo;s backgrounds</p>
<p>or politics or whatever else.</p>
<p>Read it on its own terms first,</p>
<p>then you could reread it</p>
<p>and kind of do other examinations or whatever else.</p>
<p>And also read a lot of history.</p>
<p>So I started off reading books like Eric Hoppesbaum&rsquo;s</p>
<p>four books on history going from the 1700s</p>
<p>all the way to 1994.</p>
<p>The last book is Age of Extremes.</p>
<p>But I think understanding history</p>
<p>gives you a bird&rsquo;s eye view of everything,</p>
<p>sociology, economics, everything.</p>
<p>So these big sweeping historical books</p>
<p>are really useful to know.</p>
<p>Like everybody should know basically what year</p>
<p>or at least like what decade,</p>
<p>serfdom was abolished, what decade slavery was abolished,</p>
<p>what century Magna Carta was,</p>
<p>when the Roman Empire fell,</p>
<p>even though that&rsquo;s kind of debated</p>
<p>when the Roman Empire fell.</p>
<p>All these, I think like being a person</p>
<p>with a general knowledge</p>
<p>and general sense of history and whatever else</p>
<p>just makes you more eclectic and interesting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s way better than just like,</p>
<p>especially a lot of my Indian friends,</p>
<p>not just Indians, but the hyper-focus on like,</p>
<p>you got to specialize and you got to like focus on math</p>
<p>or engineering, whatever you want to do.</p>
<p>You just know your field really well, but nothing else.</p>
<p>Like, I think there&rsquo;s something really too,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re getting in school</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re just going to do it by yourself,</p>
<p>giving yourself kind of a liberal arts education.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of power to sort of</p>
<p>having the facts of history in terms of in time,</p>
<p>when stuff happened,</p>
<p>but also really powerful is knowing spatially,</p>
<p>like the geography,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re a point on a map</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s interesting dynamics</p>
<p>that happened throughout history</p>
<p>of all the different nations in Europe,</p>
<p>of all the different military conflicts</p>
<p>and the expansions and the wars</p>
<p>and the empires and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It really puts into context</p>
<p>how human history has led to the place we are today,</p>
<p>because all the different geopolitical conflicts</p>
<p>we have today,</p>
<p>even the politics of the day is grounded in history,</p>
<p>maybe less so for the United States,</p>
<p>because it has a very young history,</p>
<p>but that history, even for the United States,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still there, right?</p>
<p>From the civil war</p>
<p>and understanding that gives you context</p>
<p>to when you tweet random stuff</p>
<p>about this or that person or politician and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, very true.</p>
<p>Very true.</p>
<p>One of the regrets I have currently</p>
<p>is I have perhaps been too focused on the 20th century</p>
<p>in terms of history,</p>
<p>the present and the 20th century.</p>
<p>A lot of people write to me</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of lessons to be learned</p>
<p>in ancient history as well.</p>
<p>So not just even American history,</p>
<p>but just looking farther and farther and farther back.</p>
<p>Yeah, that feels like it&rsquo;s another time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally has no lessons,</p>
<p>but then you remind yourself</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s the same human beings, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and also we&rsquo;re no smarter than them.</p>
<p>We just have more accrued knowledge in part because of them,</p>
<p>but they were just as clever as us.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole experiment</p>
<p>that we have going on on earth?</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s no broad meaning of life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, you know, it was an accident,</p>
<p>but we ourselves need to make our own meeting.</p>
<p>And for me, a lot of it is about posterity,</p>
<p>trying to do something worthwhile while on earth,</p>
<p>but also leaving something behind.</p>
<p>It could just be relationships with friends or family</p>
<p>in the future, maybe having a family</p>
<p>and kind of like leaving behind that sort of legacy,</p>
<p>the little bits of yourself,</p>
<p>but also, you know, them being able to learn</p>
<p>the same way I have little bits of my parents</p>
<p>and my grandparents in me.</p>
<p>And then also I think in a social sense,</p>
<p>zooming out from just the individual and the family,</p>
<p>leaving the world behind a little better, you know,</p>
<p>I would love to be a part of a movement</p>
<p>that created a world with a little bit less suffering,</p>
<p>a little bit less oppression or exploitation</p>
<p>or whatever else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really why I&rsquo;m a socialist.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not about snapping your fingers</p>
<p>and curing the world of everything in one go,</p>
<p>but it is about, I think, putting our lives,</p>
<p>giving our lives some sort of meaning and purpose.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to be a socialist to do that.</p>
<p>You could just do it at the, you know,</p>
<p>at the micro level in your own day-to-day interactions.</p>
<p>But I just feel like life has no good meaning</p>
<p>without thinking of posterity in the future.</p>
<p>And I have to say, thank you for doing so.</p>
<p>Thank you for caring about the struggle</p>
<p>of the people in the world through ideas that are bold</p>
<p>and I think challenging for a lot of people.</p>
<p>In a time when socialism is something</p>
<p>that can be attacked aggressively by large numbers of people,</p>
<p>still persevering and still exploring those ideas</p>
<p>and seeing what of those ideas can make for a better world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful to see.</p>
<p>Bhaskar, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the work you do.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do next.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>And yeah, thanks for keeping an open mind</p>
<p>with these conversations and to your audience too.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s nice to have a space where, you know,</p>
<p>people can debate and think at length</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have to worry about soundbite culture.</p>
<p>Thank you, brother.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Bhaskar Sankara.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.</p>
<p>Democracy is the road to socialism.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
