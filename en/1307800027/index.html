    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 25, Germanic Markings and the Runes.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to continue to look at the early Germanic tribes, but this</p>
<p>time around we&rsquo;re going to focus on events in southern Germania.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to look at the southward migration of Germanic tribes to the Danube region, where</p>
<p>they met the Romans and eventually met the alphabet.</p>
<p>So for the first time, we can begin to examine the language of the early Germans in their</p>
<p>own written words.</p>
<p>But before I begin, let me remind you that the History of the Alphabet series is still</p>
<p>available.</p>
<p>You can get it through iTunes, amazon.com, and the website for the podcast, historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>And also, I wanted to confirm that you can use a credit card to purchase the alphabet</p>
<p>series through the website.</p>
<p>At checkout, there is a checkout with PayPal button, but if you click that, you have the</p>
<p>option of paying with a credit card if you prefer.</p>
<p>And speaking of the alphabet, let&rsquo;s talk about Germanic writing.</p>
<p>Because in this episode, we&rsquo;re going to move the story of the Germanic tribes forward a</p>
<p>century or so, to the time when the early Germanic languages met the alphabet.</p>
<p>But before I jump into this topic, I wanted to mention that I&rsquo;m going to talk about the</p>
<p>Goths in the next episode.</p>
<p>I had planned on discussing them this time, but I&rsquo;m just not going to have time to do</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And the Goths are so important to the overall story of the Germanic tribes that they really</p>
<p>need their own episode anyway.</p>
<p>So next time, we&rsquo;ll talk about the Goths.</p>
<p>But this time, we&rsquo;re going to focus on the Germanic runes, which is the earliest known</p>
<p>type of writing in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>And that means we have detailed written evidence of the Germanic languages, which allows us</p>
<p>to explore how they were using their words.</p>
<p>But in order to understand how writing was adopted by the early Germans, we have to turn</p>
<p>our attention southward, down to the region around the River Danube.</p>
<p>Because it was in this region where the illiterate Germans met the literate Romans and Greeks.</p>
<p>And just as we&rsquo;ve seen before, writing is an acquired skill, and it was almost always</p>
<p>acquired through trade and contact with people who&rsquo;d already mastered it.</p>
<p>And that was what happened here as well.</p>
<p>Now geography is kind of important to this episode.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s helpful to begin by looking at the general location of the Germanic tribes</p>
<p>in the first couple of centuries AD.</p>
<p>Because the movement and migration of these tribes is a big part of this story.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get the lay of the land, and let&rsquo;s begin by looking to the south to the River</p>
<p>Danube.</p>
<p>The Danube originates in the Black Forest region in southern Germany.</p>
<p>And from there it flows north of the Alps in an eastward direction through modern Austria,</p>
<p>Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania and several other countries before it eventually empties</p>
<p>into the Black Sea.</p>
<p>The name Danube actually originated from an Indo-European root word, danu, which probably</p>
<p>meant river in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And of course the river takes us back to the Balkan region near the origin of the original</p>
<p>Indo-European tribes.</p>
<p>The importance of the Danube for our story is that it generally marked the northern border</p>
<p>of the Roman Empire, and it was therefore the northern border of the literate world.</p>
<p>The area north of the Danube was barbarian territory as far as the Romans were concerned.</p>
<p>And we also know that this region north of the Danube was originally occupied by Celtic-speaking</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>In fact, the Celts are the Indo-European speakers who gave us the name Danube.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European word, danu, it passed through the Celtic languages and became</p>
<p>the name of the river.</p>
<p>But now, during the 1st century AD or Common Era, many of these Celtic tribes had been</p>
<p>overtaken or displaced by Germanic tribes moving in from the north.</p>
<p>And the best evidence we have of this comes from our old friend Tacitus.</p>
<p>The last portion of Germania is a general description of the various Germanic tribes,</p>
<p>including the general location of the tribes.</p>
<p>And this description provides a nice snapshot of the tribes at this point late in the 1st</p>
<p>century.</p>
<p>Tacitus begins his description in the west, where he describes the various tribes along</p>
<p>the Rhine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of important to us because that&rsquo;s the area where the later Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>lived.</p>
<p>Specifically, this is the West Germanic region of the Angles, Saxons, Frisians, Franks, and</p>
<p>the Jutes.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really interesting about Tacitus is that he barely mentions those names at</p>
<p>all.</p>
<p>So it appears that during the time of Tacitus, the names of the tribes in this region were</p>
<p>quite different from the names that would emerge just a couple of centuries later.</p>
<p>For example, he doesn&rsquo;t mention the Franks or the Saxons at all.</p>
<p>And those will soon become two of the most important and powerful Germanic tribes in</p>
<p>the north.</p>
<p>So it appears that the smaller tribes described by Tacitus later coalesced into larger tribes,</p>
<p>including the Franks and the Saxons.</p>
<p>Tacitus does make one passing mention of a tribe called the Angli in this region.</p>
<p>And the Angli were probably the ancestors of the later Angles.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s about it as far as the Angli are concerned.</p>
<p>Tacitus also briefly mentions the Frisii, which was the name of the tribe that occupied</p>
<p>the region that came to be known as Frisia along the coast of the modern Netherlands.</p>
<p>And as you may recall, the later Frisians were neighbors of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>And there were probably a significant number of Frisians who joined in the later Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>migrations to Britain.</p>
<p>But at this early date, the tribe known as the Frisii may not have been the same tribe</p>
<p>which would later be called the Frisians.</p>
<p>The early Frisii tribe had come under Roman rule by this point.</p>
<p>And eventually the Romans expelled many of the Frisii from this region.</p>
<p>And later flooding displaced most of the rest.</p>
<p>So this area of Frisia was largely abandoned for a while.</p>
<p>But shortly before the Anglo-Saxon migrations to Britain, this area began to be repopulated.</p>
<p>It was these later inhabitants who became known as the Frisians.</p>
<p>And their name was probably taken from this early Frisii tribe mentioned by Tacitus.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if any of the original Frisii stuck around to become part of the later Frisian tribe.</p>
<p>It actually appears that most of the members of the later Frisian tribe came from neighboring</p>
<p>tribes, especially the Angles and Saxons.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the reason why the language of the Frisians was so closely related to</p>
<p>the language of the early Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also why we still consider the modern Frisian language in the Netherlands to be</p>
<p>the closest thing we have to a sister language of English.</p>
<p>But as far as the original Frisii tribe is concerned, they&rsquo;re probably the source of</p>
<p>the name Frisia.</p>
<p>But beyond that, we really can&rsquo;t say very much about them.</p>
<p>Now after looking at the tribes along the Rhine, Tacitus turns his attention to the</p>
<p>south, to the tribes along the Danube.</p>
<p>And according to Tacitus, there was a mixture of Celtic and Germanic tribes in this region</p>
<p>during the later portion of the first century.</p>
<p>As we know, all of central Europe had once been dominated by Celtic tribes.</p>
<p>But as the Germanic tribes moved southward, they had displaced the Celtic tribes.</p>
<p>And by the time of Tacitus, some of those Germanic tribes had already settled in the</p>
<p>southern portion of Germania along the Danube, and therefore along the border with the Romans.</p>
<p>But Tacitus tells us that there were still Celtic-speaking tribes in the western portion</p>
<p>of the Danube region, in the region which contains the source of the Rhine and the Danube,</p>
<p>so basically southwestern Germany.</p>
<p>And he also mentioned that Celtic-speaking tribes lived further east along the Danube</p>
<p>near the Black Sea, so basically the region of modern-day Hungary and Romania.</p>
<p>So we still have Celtic tribes hanging on in those regions of the Danube.</p>
<p>But in between those tribes, the Germanic tribes had taken over.</p>
<p>Specifically, the two tribes in this region were called the Marcomanni and the Quadi.</p>
<p>In terms of location, this was the region north of the Danube, in the Bavarian region</p>
<p>of southeastern Germany and in the western Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Now these two Germanic tribes, the Marcomanni and the Quadi, were amassing a great deal</p>
<p>of power around the time of Tacitus.</p>
<p>The Marcomanni were the dominant tribe, and the Quadi were a smaller tribe in the same</p>
<p>region.</p>
<p>The name of the Marcomanni was a combination of two early Germanic words.</p>
<p>The word marco meant borderland, and mani meant men, which is actually the same root</p>
<p>as the modern English word men.</p>
<p>So Marcomanni literally meant border men, or people of the borderlands, or frontier.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what they were.</p>
<p>They were living at the edge of the German frontier in the south along the Danube.</p>
<p>Now the Germanic word marco, meaning borderland, can still be found in modern English if we</p>
<p>look for it.</p>
<p>For example, we see it when we refer to the Welsh marshes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the root of the name of the later Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, which</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about when we get to the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the root of the modern English word mark, as in to place a mark on something.</p>
<p>It probably originated in the sense of marking or labeling a boundary between one side and</p>
<p>another side, and it later took on a much more general sense, meaning any kind of impression.</p>
<p>And the noun mark later became a verb, as in to mark something up or down, like a sales</p>
<p>price.</p>
<p>In Middle English, the sense of the word mark shifted again, and it came to mean a target,</p>
<p>as in hit the mark, meaning to hit the target.</p>
<p>And someone who could do that was a marksman.</p>
<p>And if I make a verbal note about something, I make a remark.</p>
<p>Of course, we have earmarks and bookmarks, watermarks, birthmarks, and question marks.</p>
<p>And an object which was set up on the land near the border was called a landmark.</p>
<p>A line which marks a border is sometimes called a line of demarcation from a Spanish borrowing</p>
<p>of the same Germanic word.</p>
<p>And the home of Danish people who lived in the border region of northern Europe came</p>
<p>to be called Denmark, meaning the Danes in the border region.</p>
<p>So all of these words come from that original Germanic word marco, meaning border.</p>
<p>By the way, that Germanic word has Indo-European roots, and the original Indo-European root</p>
<p>word produced a Latin word marca and a later variation margo.</p>
<p>Those Latin words give us English words like margin, again, meaning the border or edge</p>
<p>of something.</p>
<p>And later, French gave titles of nobility to the people who ruled the frontier regions.</p>
<p>This was the title of marquis, which later came to England as marquess.</p>
<p>The French also used that term marquis to describe a linen canopy placed over an officer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tent.</p>
<p>And American English later borrowed the use of that term to refer to a canopy placed over</p>
<p>the entrance to a theater or hotel.</p>
<p>So that Germanic word marco and its Latin cognate marca have given us a lot of words</p>
<p>in modern English.</p>
<p>And it gave us the name of this ancient Germanic tribe, the Marcomanni, which meant frontier</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>And that meant that they were living at the southern edge of the Germanic world, near</p>
<p>the Danube.</p>
<p>Now, at the time of Tacitus, the Marcomanni and the Quadi had only been in this region</p>
<p>of the Danube for a short period of time.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;d actually forced out a native Celtic tribe when they arrived.</p>
<p>The Celtic tribe was called the Boii.</p>
<p>And as these Germanic tribes moved in from the north, they began to call this land the</p>
<p>Boioheim, which meant the home of the Boii.</p>
<p>And the name Boioheim eventually became Bohemia.</p>
<p>And of course, from Bohemia, we get the later term Bohemian.</p>
<p>That term, Bohemian, was actually coined by medieval French, and it was used in reference</p>
<p>to the people who were called gypsies, which is now generally considered a pejorative term.</p>
<p>But the French thought that these people originated in this region known as Bohemia along the</p>
<p>Danube.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the context in which the term Bohemian came to mean someone who is unconventional</p>
<p>or a nonconformist.</p>
<p>So the word Bohemian ultimately comes from the name of this Celtic tribe, the Boii.</p>
<p>And that word reflects a time when the Celtic tribes were still living north of the Danube.</p>
<p>But now, this region of Bohemia was occupied by Germanic tribes, the Marcomanni and the</p>
<p>Quadi.</p>
<p>And the Marcomanni weren&rsquo;t really interested in stopping at the Danube.</p>
<p>They had their sights set on the Roman territory across the river to the south.</p>
<p>And they got their opportunity around the year 166.</p>
<p>In that year, Roman legions were returning from fighting in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>But when they returned, they brought a deadly plague back with them.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t the bubonic plague.</p>
<p>It was an earlier plague of either smallpox or measles.</p>
<p>But it was devastating nevertheless.</p>
<p>At one point, it was killing 2,000 people a day in Rome.</p>
<p>Estimates are that about 5 million people died from this plague over a period of 14</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>The plague didn&rsquo;t discriminate.</p>
<p>It killed Roman soldiers as well as Roman civilians.</p>
<p>And it probably caused the death of the Roman emperor, Lucius Verus.</p>
<p>And one of the consequences of all of this death was a severely weakened Roman army along</p>
<p>the Danube and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And it was at this point that that Germanic tribe on the north side of the Danube, the</p>
<p>Marcomanni, saw their opportunity to take advantage of the situation in Rome.</p>
<p>They formed a very loose alliance, which included that other tribe, the Quadi, as well as some</p>
<p>other Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And at various times over the next several years, those tribes began to cross the Danube</p>
<p>into Roman territory.</p>
<p>From around the year 166 until 180, the Romans fought back under the leadership of Marcus</p>
<p>Aurelius.</p>
<p>Today, these are known as the Marcomanni Wars.</p>
<p>And the Romans were ultimately successful in turning back those Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>Years later, these Germanic tribes migrated out of this region known as Bohemia.</p>
<p>And they traveled westward along the Danube into what is today southeastern Germany.</p>
<p>As these people arrived in the upper Danube region, they were called the Boivaris, which</p>
<p>meant Bohemians or people from the land of the Boii.</p>
<p>The land where the Boivaris settled in southern Germany became known as Boivaria, and eventually</p>
<p>it became known as Bavaria.</p>
<p>So the word Bavarian is actually cognate with the word Bohemian.</p>
<p>Both names come from the name of a Celtic tribe, the Boii.</p>
<p>And so just like the terms Teutonic and Germanic, Bavarian also has its roots in the name of</p>
<p>a Celtic tribe that once lived in the region along the Danube.</p>
<p>Now the events which I just described, the Marcomannic Wars, were extremely important</p>
<p>in the ultimate relationship between the Germans and the Romans.</p>
<p>Ever since their defeat at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest over a century and a half earlier,</p>
<p>the Romans had allowed the Rhine and the Danube to serve as the border between Rome and Germania.</p>
<p>But now, the Germans had shown that those rivers weren&rsquo;t enough to prevent an invasion</p>
<p>into Roman territory.</p>
<p>The Marcomannic Wars exposed a major weakness in Roman defenses.</p>
<p>And afterwards, the Romans stationed half of their legions along the Rhine and the Danube</p>
<p>to try to contain the Germans.</p>
<p>But as we know, this was only the beginning.</p>
<p>The Romans would spend much of the next three centuries trying to repel those invading Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>And in order to do that, the Romans had to withdraw their forces from far-flung places</p>
<p>like Britain.</p>
<p>And of course, that opened the door for the Anglo-Saxons to fill the power vacuum left</p>
<p>by the departing Romans.</p>
<p>So all of these pieces are connected, and they ultimately play a part in the arrival</p>
<p>of Anglo-Saxon dialects in Britain in the 5th century.</p>
<p>So after the Marcomannic Wars, the Romans attempted to shore up their defenses along</p>
<p>the Rhine and the Danube.</p>
<p>And since the Roman army had been severely weakened by disease, they began to rely more</p>
<p>and more upon the services of mercenaries.</p>
<p>And many of those Roman mercenaries were Germans from the other side of the border.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the Romans even allowed Germanic tribes to cross the border and settle in Roman</p>
<p>territory in exchange for their agreement to defend the border against other Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>This was basically the later agreement between the Romans and the Franks in the northern</p>
<p>Rhine region.</p>
<p>So from this point on, the relationship between the Romans and the Germans becomes more complicated,</p>
<p>and it also becomes more intimate.</p>
<p>The Romans weren&rsquo;t just fighting against the Germans.</p>
<p>They were now routinely fighting with them as well.</p>
<p>And of course, they were actively trading with the Germans at the same time.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now seeing more and more contacts between the Romans and the Germans.</p>
<p>And as these contacts increased, we see more and more goods passing back and forth between</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned in earlier episodes, we see words passing between them as well.</p>
<p>But we also start to see certain skills passing back and forth.</p>
<p>And one of those skills was writing.</p>
<p>Just as the Greeks had borrowed the alphabet from the Phoenicians, and then the Etruscans</p>
<p>borrowed it, and then the Romans borrowed it, now it was time for the Germans to borrow</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But this time, it happened in different ways at different times and different places.</p>
<p>No one knows exactly when the alphabet first passed to the Germans, but it probably happened</p>
<p>very early on in the region between the Danube and northern Italy.</p>
<p>A few episodes back, I mentioned a helmet that was discovered in modern-day Slovenia</p>
<p>in an area between northern Italy and the Danube.</p>
<p>It contained the first known Germanic inscription, and it was apparently written in a version</p>
<p>of the later Etruscan alphabet.</p>
<p>A version of that alphabet had begun to spread north into the Alps and the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>And this helmet, which dates to the 2nd century BC, probably represents the earliest contact</p>
<p>between Germanic-speaking peoples and the alphabet.</p>
<p>But the inscription on the helmet is in a later version of the Etruscan alphabet, so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not runes.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that this inscription represents an early version of the runic symbols,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s never been definitively confirmed.</p>
<p>Even if the inscriptions on this particular helmet are not runes, it seems likely that</p>
<p>that northern Etruscan alphabet was gradually being borrowed by Germanic tribes in this</p>
<p>region between northern Italy and the Danube.</p>
<p>That Etruscan alphabet was being used by people in this region, and it appears that the very</p>
<p>early Germans picked up on this script through trade and other contacts around the first</p>
<p>couple of centuries BC.</p>
<p>The letters of this alphabet were already angular, but the Germans made some modifications</p>
<p>to make the script even easier to carve into wood and bone.</p>
<p>Specifically, they straightened the lines to make them easier to carve.</p>
<p>And this was the beginning of the collection of symbols which we know today as the Germanic</p>
<p>runes.</p>
<p>In addition to certain similarities between the Etruscan letters and the Germanic runic</p>
<p>symbols, there&rsquo;s also a similarity in writing style.</p>
<p>Many runic inscriptions used the back-and-forth writing style which was common among the later</p>
<p>Etruscans.</p>
<p>So, for example, some inscriptions go from left to right on one line, and then right</p>
<p>to left on the next, and then back to left to right, and so on.</p>
<p>This style of writing was also used for a period of time by the Greeks and the Romans.</p>
<p>It basically represents a transitional period of writing as these early people were shifting</p>
<p>from the right-to-left style of writing used by the Semitic people to the left-to-right</p>
<p>style which we use in the West today.</p>
<p>So given that these early Germanic runic inscriptions often did the same thing, that suggests that</p>
<p>the symbols were borrowed from one of these alphabetic scripts, with Etruscan being the</p>
<p>most likely source.</p>
<p>I should also note that some historians have noted similarities between the runic symbols</p>
<p>and the early Greek and Roman versions of the alphabet.</p>
<p>So even though the Etruscan alphabet is the most likely source given the geography and</p>
<p>the archaeological evidence, we can&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that the early Greek or</p>
<p>Roman alphabet was either the original source or a contributing source.</p>
<p>Now even though it appears that one or more early Germanic tribes began to borrow the</p>
<p>Etruscan alphabet during the pre-Christian era, we don&rsquo;t actually find evidence of the</p>
<p>actual Germanic runic symbols until the 2nd century AD, a few decades after the time of</p>
<p>Tacitus.</p>
<p>So the fact is that we have this gap of two or three hundred years between the Slovenian</p>
<p>Helmet and the first runic inscriptions in Europe.</p>
<p>The fact that we have this gap means that there&rsquo;s no physical evidence which enables</p>
<p>historians to follow the evolution of the script during this period.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s still some debate as to the ultimate origin of the runes.</p>
<p>But why does this gap exist?</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t archaeologists been able to find the missing link between the Etruscan script</p>
<p>and the runes?</p>
<p>Well the answer probably lies in the material which was used, and also in the fact that</p>
<p>the runic inscriptions were used on a very limited basis.</p>
<p>The early runes were mostly written on wood.</p>
<p>And over time the wood rotted and decayed.</p>
<p>So very few runic inscriptions survived.</p>
<p>And most of the ones that did survive come from a later period when they were engraved</p>
<p>on stone or metal objects.</p>
<p>About 5,000 runic inscriptions survive today, most in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Only about 70 survive from Anglo-Saxon Britain.</p>
<p>But over 95% of all surviving inscriptions date from a period after 550 AD.</p>
<p>Scholars have estimated that there are no more than 125 surviving inscriptions from</p>
<p>before this date.</p>
<p>And most of those only contain one or two words.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the first inscriptions which can be clearly identified as runes appear</p>
<p>in northern Europe, not in the Danube region.</p>
<p>So the thought is that the early runic inscriptions from the Danube region were mostly carved</p>
<p>on wood, and therefore haven&rsquo;t survived the centuries.</p>
<p>Over a period of several centuries the runic writing spread northward, and eventually it</p>
<p>became more common to carve runes into stone and metal.</p>
<p>So these later stone and metal inscriptions in the north survive, but those earlier wooden</p>
<p>carvings in the south are largely gone.</p>
<p>Now, rune is a Germanic word, which meant either secret or scratchings.</p>
<p>And as we know by now, they were originally markings on wood or stone.</p>
<p>And we know where the word mark comes from, thanks to our earlier discussion about the</p>
<p>Marcomanni tribe.</p>
<p>So the runes were markings consisting of specific marks, which were derived from contacts with</p>
<p>literate people on the marshes or margins of the Germanic world.</p>
<p>And this contact may have included Germanic tribes, like the Marcomanni.</p>
<p>And since this was the beginning of Germanic writing, that makes it a landmark event.</p>
<p>All of that thanks to that original Germanic word for borderland or frontier.</p>
<p>Now as I noted, the early runes were used to write inscriptions consisting of only one</p>
<p>or two words.</p>
<p>And scholars have noted that some words occur over and over again.</p>
<p>One of those words is alu.</p>
<p>This word probably derived from an Indo-European root word, al, which meant to grow or nourish.</p>
<p>That Indo-European root word passed into Latin, and you might remember from an earlier episode</p>
<p>that it produced the word aliscera, meaning to grow or nourish in Latin.</p>
<p>Well that word produced later English words like adolescent and adult.</p>
<p>But that same Indo-European root word, al, also passed into the Germanic languages, where</p>
<p>it eventually produced the modern English word old.</p>
<p>So adolescent, adult, and old are all cognate, thanks to that common Indo-European root word.</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s believed that this common runic inscription alu is derived from that same</p>
<p>root word.</p>
<p>And in this context it was probably used to refer to something strong or powerful, like</p>
<p>a fully grown person, as opposed to a child.</p>
<p>So linguists think that this word connotes a sense of security or protection when it</p>
<p>was used in these early inscriptions.</p>
<p>Another common word found in these runic inscriptions is the word lauca.</p>
<p>And this was a word which meant onion or garlic.</p>
<p>And we still have that word in modern English, in the word leek, l-e-e-k.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also part of our modern word garlic.</p>
<p>The gar part meant spear, and it comes from the fact that a garlic clove is pointed like</p>
<p>a spear.</p>
<p>And of course the second part is lick, which comes from that same root word, lauca, which</p>
<p>also gives us the word leek.</p>
<p>So why would the Germanic inscriptions regularly use the word lauca, meaning onion or garlic?</p>
<p>Well apparently the early Germans thought onions and garlic had magical properties.</p>
<p>It could fend off evil spirits.</p>
<p>So they would often wear a clove of garlic around their neck.</p>
<p>But in later times they would simply engrave the word for garlic, lauca, on a piece of</p>
<p>wood or metal or bone.</p>
<p>And they would wear that around their neck instead.</p>
<p>After all, it didn&rsquo;t go bad like an onion or garlic.</p>
<p>But apparently it had the same mystical properties since it was the word for onion or garlic.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of amazing in itself, the fact that a written word for an object had</p>
<p>the same properties as the object itself.</p>
<p>And it shows a very advanced use of the written language by the early Germans.</p>
<p>Of course the idea that garlic fends off evil spirits is passed down to us today thanks</p>
<p>to the stories of vampires like Dracula and more recently Edward Cullen.</p>
<p>And where did Dracula come from?</p>
<p>Transylvania in modern day Romania, just north of the Danube River.</p>
<p>And if I had two hours for this episode I would point out the connections between dark</p>
<p>brooding vampires and the so-called goth look, which takes us back, at least linguistically,</p>
<p>to the goths.</p>
<p>And the goths also controlled this same region of Romania along the Danube.</p>
<p>So there are lots of connections here if we look for them, but we&rsquo;ll have to save the</p>
<p>goths for next time.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s focus on the actual runic symbols.</p>
<p>There were 24 symbols in the early runic alphabet, if we can call it that.</p>
<p>And in fact this collection of symbols is named in the same manner that we name our</p>
<p>alphabet.</p>
<p>The word alphabet is named for the first two letters of the Greek alphabet, alpha and beta.</p>
<p>Sometimes we call it the ABCs, so we use the first few letters for the name of the entire</p>
<p>collection of letters.</p>
<p>And the name of the collection of runic symbols is derived the same way.</p>
<p>The first six symbols represent the F sound, th, the U sound, u, the TH sound, th, the</p>
<p>A sound, a, the R sound, r, and the K sound, k.</p>
<p>And when we put all those together, it produces the word futhark.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the name of the runic alphabet.</p>
<p>By the way, the specific order of the runes is established by later runic poems and runic</p>
<p>lists which have been discovered.</p>
<p>As linguists have analyzed the early runes from that period before 550 AD, they&rsquo;ve concluded</p>
<p>that the runes were very uniform as far as the sounds they represent.</p>
<p>In other words, they don&rsquo;t really observe regional variations.</p>
<p>And that suggests that the languages of the Germanic tribes during this early period were</p>
<p>still very common and uniform.</p>
<p>And though regional dialects were almost certainly starting to emerge during this period, the</p>
<p>runic inscriptions don&rsquo;t pick up on any of those differences.</p>
<p>The one exception to this rule is the Gothic language in the eastern part of Germania.</p>
<p>Now as I noted earlier, I&rsquo;m going to focus on the Goths and their language next time.</p>
<p>But for now, there&rsquo;s one aspect of the Gothic language that I want to look at.</p>
<p>You may recall from the episode on Germanic grammar that the original Germanic language</p>
<p>had a sound that was somewhere between a sibilant S or Z sound and an R sound.</p>
<p>There was an earlier Z sound which eventually shifted to an R sound.</p>
<p>And this sound was right in the middle of that change during the early Germanic period.</p>
<p>And you might remember that we see remnants of that change in English in words like was</p>
<p>and were, and most and more.</p>
<p>Well that sound shift never happened in the Gothic language.</p>
<p>The Goths retained that original Z sound and it never shifted to the R.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the reason why we know the eastern Germanic tribes like the Goths</p>
<p>separated from the western and northern tribes pretty early on.</p>
<p>Their language has some unique characteristics.</p>
<p>When we look at the runic alphabet, we see two runic symbols which represent the R sound.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one symbol for the traditional R sound, and that&rsquo;s the R sound in Futhark,</p>
<p>which is the name of the runic alphabet.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a separate symbol for a sound between the Z and the R sounds, which</p>
<p>is called Algiz.</p>
<p>The second symbol represents that in-between sound that was in transition between the original</p>
<p>Germanic Z sound and the later R sound.</p>
<p>And the fact that this sound has its own runic symbol is important for two reasons.</p>
<p>It tells us that that sound was in transition when the first Germans developed the runes.</p>
<p>But it also tells us that the runes were developed by Germans speaking the western or northern</p>
<p>dialects where this in-between sound existed.</p>
<p>And so we can reasonably conclude that the Gothic dialect had become distinct from the</p>
<p>western and northern dialects by the time runic writing was developed, because the runes</p>
<p>reflect a sound shift that never happened in the east among the Goths.</p>
<p>By the way, there are two different runic symbols for the I sound as well.</p>
<p>And from this, linguists have concluded that the early Germanic language had two separate</p>
<p>I sounds which later merged into a single I sound by the middle of the first century,</p>
<p>so around the time of Tacitus.</p>
<p>And this is another piece of evidence that the first runes must date from this earlier</p>
<p>period when the sounds were still distinct.</p>
<p>So these early runic inscriptions were very limited, consisting of only a word or two.</p>
<p>Now the runes were basically an alphabet, so theoretically they could have been used</p>
<p>to write anything, from complicated legal codes, to religious texts, to detailed histories.</p>
<p>But they were never really used in that way.</p>
<p>They were only used for short markings and inscriptions.</p>
<p>However, they did become more advanced over time.</p>
<p>And by the time we get to the Anglo-Saxons around the 7th or 8th century, we can see</p>
<p>much longer inscriptions.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this is a runic inscription on an Anglo-Saxon cross called</p>
<p>the Ruthwell Cross.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s located in modern-day Scotland, but during the time of the Anglo-Saxons, the region</p>
<p>was part of the Anglican kingdom of Northumbria.</p>
<p>The cross is a large stone cross which dates from the 7th or 8th century, and it contains</p>
<p>inscriptions in both Latin and Germanic runes.</p>
<p>The runic symbols follow along the edges of the vertical base of the cross.</p>
<p>The runic inscription is actually part of an Anglo-Saxon poem called The Dream of the</p>
<p>Rude.</p>
<p>The poem describes the crucifixion of Christ from the perspective of the cross itself.</p>
<p>And to get an idea of how detailed this inscription is, let me read a modern translation of the</p>
<p>inscription.</p>
<p>By the way, this translation comes via the BBC&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>And it reads,</p>
<p>God Almighty stripped himself When he wished to climb the cross</p>
<p>Bold before all men To bow I dared not</p>
<p>But had to stand firm.</p>
<p>I held high the great King Heaven&rsquo;s Lord</p>
<p>I dared not bend Men mocked us both together</p>
<p>I was slick with blood Sprung from the man&rsquo;s side</p>
<p>Christ was on the cross But then quick ones came from afar</p>
<p>Nobles all together I beheld it all</p>
<p>I was hit hard with grief I bowed to the warrior&rsquo;s hands</p>
<p>Wounded with spears They laid him, limb weary</p>
<p>At his body&rsquo;s head they stood There they looked to Heaven&rsquo;s Lord.</p>
<p>So from this inscription you can see what the runes were capable of.</p>
<p>Now modern English is much more wordy than Old English, and by that I mean that modern</p>
<p>English translations often require a lot more words to express the same idea as the</p>
<p>original Old English words.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s partly because English has lost a lot of those inflections which used to do</p>
<p>so much work in Old English.</p>
<p>So the actual inscription on the Ruthwell Cross is not as long as it may seem from the</p>
<p>translation I just read to you.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still quite long nevertheless, and it certainly is much longer than those</p>
<p>original one or two word inscriptions.</p>
<p>Now one last note about the runes before I conclude this episode.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why all of this discussion of runes is so important to English.</p>
<p>After all, we don&rsquo;t write with runes today.</p>
<p>Well the answer lies in the fact that the original English Saxons did use the runes.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the original Old English alphabet mixed in letters derived from runes</p>
<p>with the letters borrowed from the Romans.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another reason why it&rsquo;s so difficult to read Old English text.</p>
<p>They used a lot of letters which we don&rsquo;t use anymore.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t really until the Norman French arrived after 1066 that the runic letters</p>
<p>began to be purged.</p>
<p>The Normans had no use for the Germanic letters, so over a period of several centuries they</p>
<p>got rid of them.</p>
<p>So you can still see some of those runic letters well into the Middle English period.</p>
<p>But those old runic letters do sometimes show up in modern English in funny ways.</p>
<p>For example, the Anglo-Saxons had two separate runic letters for the TH sound.</p>
<p>They recognized certain differences in the TH sound.</p>
<p>For example, the difference between THE and THANK.</p>
<p>The TH sound in THANK is more pronounced and the tongue moves forward between the teeth</p>
<p>to achieve that sound.</p>
<p>Well this resulted in two different Old English letters.</p>
<p>One of those letters was called the THORN.</p>
<p>And it looks sort of like a modern letter P.</p>
<p>Just take the loop at the top of the P and slide it down the stem about half way.</p>
<p>So the Old English version of the word THE, T-H-E, was actually spelled THORN, E.</p>
<p>But after printing was developed in Europe and spread to the British Isles, the medieval</p>
<p>printers didn&rsquo;t have a letter for THORN.</p>
<p>But at this point the shape had evolved a little bit, becoming a little more angular</p>
<p>and curvy.</p>
<p>And the early printers thought it looked a lot like the early letter Y.</p>
<p>So they just used the letter Y for the Old English letter THORN.</p>
<p>And we still see that when we see places named YE OLD SHOP or whatever.</p>
<p>The fact is, English never used the word YE as an article to mean THE.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply a mistake people have made through the years when they see the spelling</p>
<p>YE.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t realize that the Y is supposed to represent the TH sound.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only there because printers didn&rsquo;t have that runic letter THORN.</p>
<p>So with that, I&rsquo;m going to conclude this episode about the Germanic runes.</p>
<p>Next time, I&rsquo;m going to finally focus on the Goths and their language.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to explore the Gothic language by comparing it to Old English.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to have to practice my Old English pronunciations before next time.</p>
<p>So until then, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
