<p>Ôªøso um so you sent me this incredible
email I wanted to just kind of tell me</p>
<p>kind of your your story and a thumbnail
sketch what what happened you&rsquo;ve gone to</p>
<p>these doctors over and over again and
just hasn&rsquo;t really worked and you got</p>
<p>the runaround I just want to hear you
hear your story okay well first of all</p>
<p>diabetes runs in my family the whole
family starting as far back as I know</p>
<p>from my grandparents and so I&rsquo;ve always
been preached to growing up that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a going to happen okay my cousins
and my fault all on my father&rsquo;s side on</p>
<p>the Neilson side all of my cousins and
his brothers and everybody and so when I</p>
<p>see that many people with diabetes I
can&rsquo;t go on the notion that it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>they got fat I can&rsquo;t go I&rsquo;ve heard a lot
of things about this it&rsquo;s that was</p>
<p>something to be on the lookout for and
sure enough I knew I was having problems</p>
<p>back in the 80s and I would talk to my
doctors about it and I knew that if I</p>
<p>had sugar in the morning and coffee I
would be in big trouble by 9:00 o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>right in the middle of a test or
something you know mm-hmm by the time in</p>
<p>the 90s rolled around it was really bad
and I would talk so I learned to avoid</p>
<p>sugar in the morning especially in my
coffee or something and I would talk to</p>
<p>my doctors about this and nobody was
telling me anything they would just say</p>
<p>eat an apple it has pectin it&rsquo;ll help
stabilize your blood or eat protein and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like I don&rsquo;t understand all this but
now I do I understand what was going on</p>
<p>was that I was I was I was becoming a
diabetic a full-blown diabetic and so I</p>
<p>knew how pretty much to come in under
the wire because I would I would fast</p>
<p>before any tests like you&rsquo;re supposed to
so it never was showing up in my urine</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t telling me anything and
and one day I finally said enough is</p>
<p>enough
and I had on hand some raisin bran cereal</p>
<p>which I never really ate but somebody
else that had been visiting wanted it so</p>
<p>I bought it there it was I said I&rsquo;m
going to have two big bowls and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really going to pour the sugar on it
then I&rsquo;m going to go to this doctor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>appointment and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what
happened is I had a gynecology</p>
<p>appointment and they they do your full
thing blood thing everything on the next</p>
<p>thing I know I&rsquo;m being grabbed by the
elbow being escorted across the room I</p>
<p>have a head there was a sugar in my
urine</p>
<p>so they pricked my finger and it came
back 220 I said it&rsquo;s fought full-blown</p>
<p>diabetes great suddenly been how many
years I&rsquo;ve been trying to tell you</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s wrong something&rsquo;s wrong you
have to understand I had very limited</p>
<p>knowledge at the time and this was
probably about four years ago three to</p>
<p>four years ahead be three years ago so
they set me up an appointment with an</p>
<p>endocrinologist and I went and I saw
them and of course having the history I</p>
<p>just I just went out and bought a meter
and he immediately started doing what I</p>
<p>was supposed to do check my blood was it
seven times a day fasting before and</p>
<p>after each meal and and after a while
you pretty much could predict what it</p>
<p>was going to be they put me on metformin
500 milligrams in the morning and</p>
<p>evening and I took it religiously and
then I I was only careful to eat um</p>
<p>approved grains like quinoa or brown
rice um very moderately at the same time</p>
<p>I had an ongoing weight issue okay and
the answer was to lose the weight yeah</p>
<p>yeah that wasn&rsquo;t going to happen I tried
I mean I tried everything and I it got</p>
<p>to a point one time where all I would
eat work was apples apples seemed</p>
<p>satisfying me you know it was good for
my stomach</p>
<p>I could work and eat it um if you got
hungry you could eat one and and that</p>
<p>worked pretty good and I did lose some
weight who knows what kind of</p>
<p>weight that&rsquo;s another thing I know I
didn&rsquo;t like weighing myself because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>smart enough to know that weight is
nothing more than mass times gravity so</p>
<p>which mass am I losing I have a very
active job and I&rsquo;m a very active person</p>
<p>so I need a lot of muscle and when I go
to try to do something and find out that</p>
<p>I no longer have this muscle I know
which mass I just lost mm-hmm well I</p>
<p>gave up on the whole weighing yourself
thing okay and then I took just</p>
<p>metformin I did what I was supposed to
do I&rsquo;m really good at following orders</p>
<p>and then I had this problem I ran out of
it form it so what do you do when you</p>
<p>run out of metformin you call your
doctor you make an appointment do</p>
<p>whatever you got to do when I called the
doctor I got yelled at by the</p>
<p>receptionist and like whoa what&rsquo;s going
on here this was last March I just got</p>
<p>back from Montana you know I ran out of
Metformin that&rsquo;s what you do you call</p>
<p>your your doctor and they said where
have you been I don&rsquo;t get it what do you</p>
<p>mean you haven&rsquo;t been in in three years
well you didn&rsquo;t tell me - I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you wanted to see me I didn&rsquo;t exactly see
you banging my door down to come in and</p>
<p>see what&rsquo;s the problem is not a problem
we&rsquo;ll get it strained out whatever we</p>
<p>got to do is not a problem and so I went
in and saw them I didn&rsquo;t know they were</p>
<p>going to draw blood that day I hadn&rsquo;t
fasted or anything and I truly believe</p>
<p>in fasting before blood tests so they
drew my blood and everything and I</p>
<p>talked to what was the point is that
it&rsquo;s never the doctor I never see that</p>
<p>off I always see a physician&rsquo;s assistant
or something but it&rsquo;s never that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen this doctor and I was telling
her about where I was in life and what I</p>
<p>was doing and how I was eating and I
wanted to concentrate on my adrenal</p>
<p>gland now fifty I was 52 at the time I&rsquo;m
now 53 I&rsquo;m 52 years old um you know I</p>
<p>really want to know what&rsquo;s going on with
my body and I want to I want to</p>
<p>concentrate on my liver and I want to
concentrate on my adrenal gland and I</p>
<p>think if those two things are good
everything else will come together and</p>
<p>she says great let&rsquo;s test these things I
said okay so they</p>
<p>drew some blood and I waited for these
tests to come back and when I called</p>
<p>them up it wasn&rsquo;t good news it wasn&rsquo;t
good news I was wanting to hear that I</p>
<p>could come off the metformin because I
know it&rsquo;s not good for your kidneys okay</p>
<p>my father was on it for like 30 years I
think he just recently passed away he</p>
<p>was 84 when he passed away and and I am
now at the age when he started his</p>
<p>metformin so even though it was okay for
him I didn&rsquo;t want to be on the metformin</p>
<p>mm-hmm so what they did is they put me
on three pills not just one now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three it was the metformin plus
something to protect my kidneys</p>
<p>wonderful and then I think with Palestra
all okay so in all this leading up to</p>
<p>here I had tried going vegan I had tried
everything I knew how to do it was hard</p>
<p>for me to go vegan I failed I failed
because one morning I looked in the</p>
<p>mirror I looked at my hair like what is
wrong with my hair what&rsquo;s going on with</p>
<p>my hair
I felt fine but my hair was showing</p>
<p>something okay sadly I was at it I ate a
lot of fish a lot of brown rice and</p>
<p>stuff and when that doctor&rsquo;s report came
back and they now had me on three pills</p>
<p>I was furious I was upset
and so I said okay I&rsquo;ve got to see this</p>
<p>for myself so I went down I got the hard
copy came back and started looking up</p>
<p>all the numbers and the numbers looked
fine according to Google they looked</p>
<p>fine I didn&rsquo;t see anything wrong with
them and then I was mad because of the</p>
<p>cholesterol test I just I didn&rsquo;t feel
like they were even listening to me</p>
<p>period they did what they wanted to do
they ran whatever tests they wanted to</p>
<p>run this is what the insurance pays for
and that&rsquo;s all there was to it and</p>
<p>prescribe more medication so I called my
insurance company with a bit of a</p>
<p>complaint about this and I told him that
I didn&rsquo;t like the way I was treated and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand these numbers they
look fine so they put me in touch with</p>
<p>their nurse which I was surprised
they had a nurse and I talked to her and</p>
<p>I said I don&rsquo;t get it according to these
numbers of what I&rsquo;m looking at they look</p>
<p>normal
she said that&rsquo;s because you are normal I</p>
<p>said well then why are they doing this
why are they putting me on more pills I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want this and the phone just went
silent and she said frankly you should</p>
<p>be afraid of this other one too okay
the one that that protects your kidneys</p>
<p>has side effects that&rsquo;s wonderful
something about swollen lips not yeah</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m like now I can&rsquo;t deal with this
okay so I said okay all right I have to</p>
<p>I have to do something about this so I
went out I got the prescriptions I put</p>
<p>him in the drawer and I closed the
drawer and I said I&rsquo;m going to give it</p>
<p>six months six months and I started
testing my blood after every single</p>
<p>thing I did everything if I went for a
walk I tested my blood if I drank a</p>
<p>glass of water I tested my blood if I
ate supper before supper during supper</p>
<p>whatever I just kept testing my blood
and I would I had all these mental notes</p>
<p>and then I started taking notes you know
just so I can you know what time of day</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on at this time of the day
you know I had the morning phenomenon</p>
<p>going on you know my a1c came back five
5.1 5.2 yeah I&rsquo;m like this was supposed</p>
<p>to be excellent why am i why am I having
to keep taking this stuff well it turns</p>
<p>out that five the five range may be
excellent but it&rsquo;s not perfect and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>now striving for perfection okay so I so
I kept doing this and then I had this</p>
<p>glass of sugar-free wine punch okay
every now and then I like to have a little sugar</p>
<p>free wine punch and it tastes good
you know um boom the sugar went up to</p>
<p>like 130 I&rsquo;m like what&rsquo;s up with this
Wow okay you can&rsquo;t lie to a diabetic you</p>
<p>might be able to lie on labeling but you
can&rsquo;t lie to a diabetic because if the</p>
<p>proof is in the blood so I started
googling NutraSweet and what&rsquo;s the other</p>
<p>one is it aspartame</p>
<p>sweet and low
oh no not sweet and low</p>
<p>Splenda and NutraSweet and it</p>
<p>come to find out they&rsquo;re 50% sugar I&rsquo;m
like wonderful that&rsquo;s just great</p>
<p>have you ever seen um sugar free cause
when I was going when I was going</p>
<p>through vegan that means to get away
from cream as well right so I would I</p>
<p>said okay well kinda gotta have cream in
my coffee I&rsquo;ll go berserk um that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>one thing I think I have a weakness for
is cream in my coffee and um so I tried</p>
<p>coffee mate sugar free coffee mate and my
friend sends me a text and says what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the first ingredient in coffee mate I&rsquo;m
like I don&rsquo;t know I looked at it you</p>
<p>know what it is you want to know what it
is it&rsquo;s corn syrup in the trash that one</p>
<p>so anyways so yeah I was testing my
blood after everything I did and</p>
<p>anything that would spike the blood went
in the trash and that was it</p>
<p>and what I found out at the same time I
found you I found you I found something</p>
<p>something that you put out had to have
made sense to me because like I said all</p>
<p>of what I had heard in the past wasn&rsquo;t
adding up you can&rsquo;t blame McDonald&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>diabetes my grandpa didn&rsquo;t have McDonald&rsquo;s they weren&rsquo;t fat I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>pictures on them they weren&rsquo;t heavy but
the one thing that struck me and I I</p>
<p>kind of already knew because I have a
good friend that whose wife had cancer</p>
<p>and he was trying to get put weight on
her and I said well that&rsquo;s simple all</p>
<p>you have to do is release insulin right
that much I knew what I didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>was that the one thing that must be
absent to burn fat is insulin so the</p>
<p>question is at what point in my blood um
does insulin release I don&rsquo;t know try to</p>
<p>find that number somewhere so I&rsquo;m
guessing it&rsquo;s somewhere around 99 100</p>
<p>anything over 100 maybe I don&rsquo;t know but
if you stop and think about what I was</p>
<p>eating</p>
<p>and it becomes very clear why I couldn&rsquo;t
lose weight okay so I would get up in</p>
<p>the morning I may or may not eat
breakfast depending um fruit was my</p>
<p>friend strawberries blueberries um
doesn&rsquo;t matter if it has sugar in it it</p>
<p>was your you&rsquo;re going to have insulin in
your system it may not spike it really</p>
<p>bad to a point of like 200 or 220 but
you still have insulin in your system</p>
<p>and then at lunch like last year when I
went skiing everyday for lunch I had</p>
<p>brown rice and rainbow trout for lunch
it&rsquo;s just a little bit just a little</p>
<p>done even a lot just a little bit you
know nobody could figure out why I was</p>
<p>heavy my friend that I&rsquo;m staying with
here now even said they never could</p>
<p>figure out how I could be heavy she said
all she could figure is that maybe when</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t around them I was Challen down
on potato chips or something you know</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like no my family couldn&rsquo;t
figure it out I was always that skinny</p>
<p>kid you know and something it was very
gradual it was very gradual and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what happens when insulin is in your
system you don&rsquo;t go through that natural</p>
<p>process of eating food storing fat
burning fat eating food you know um you</p>
<p>just constantly have this insulin in
your stomach so that just that led me to</p>
<p>look up more stuff and like I said one
thing led to another and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember the exact order that everything
happened but I found out that beta cells</p>
<p>and your pancreas are replicated between
the ages and two and four months okay</p>
<p>and genetically speaking some people
either get them to either get a lot or</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t and it just so happens I
didn&rsquo;t get a lot</p>
<p>yeah the beta cells they sell the papers
that makes insulin so yes yes and so</p>
<p>over time when when those beta cells are
having to continuously pump out insulin</p>
<p>they get damaged okay
so then my next thought was well let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get some more beta cells how hard can
that be</p>
<p>they replicate right no they don&rsquo;t they
don&rsquo;t just replicate and then a lot of</p>
<p>things started to really make sense
and that was the natural process of</p>
<p>things when you&rsquo;re diabetic you&rsquo;ll gain
flaked okay because of the insulin in</p>
<p>your system all the time but eventually
your body is going to say enough is</p>
<p>enough and it&rsquo;s going to start excreting
that sugar and it&rsquo;s also going to be</p>
<p>excreting you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to
take nutrients in real well and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to start dropping weight it&rsquo;s one
of the symptoms of diabetes which I</p>
<p>never experienced I guess it never got
that bad and the thirstiness is because</p>
<p>your excreting that toxin called sugar
you&rsquo;re thirsty and your body&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>flush this out trying to excrete it
through urine and eventually the weight</p>
<p>will drop now I don&rsquo;t know how far that
would go I&rsquo;m glad I never had to find</p>
<p>out but when you&rsquo;re according to the
research that I was reading once once</p>
<p>your percentage body fat gets down into
the single digits guess what happens</p>
<p>beta cells start replicating again so
when I like to get my hard copy from my</p>
<p>doctor&rsquo;s first of all they don&rsquo;t answer
the phone I had to go in I mean the</p>
<p>whole thing was just irritating okay I
went and I got the hard copy I turned</p>
<p>around and I&rsquo;m exiting the office and
what did I see hit me right in the face</p>
<p>so the patients about twelve morbidly
obese patients and I thought to myself</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not helping these people at all
has anybody ever told them that grains</p>
<p>are just simply off-limits to you would
they care I don&rsquo;t know but I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they enjoy being on insulin and forcing
that sugar back into their body which is</p>
<p>causing the problem in the first place
so anyway so I went I did six months and</p>
<p>no grains no grains no sugars no
potatoes I don&rsquo;t care about potatoes</p>
<p>anyway because I never really cared for
any of this stuff didn&rsquo;t bother me the</p>
<p>only reason I eat bread was because it
held the sandwich you know that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>you carry a sandwich and bread right six
months and the next thing I knew when I</p>
<p>was sitting there taking my blood
and over again I started thinking and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like you know I do have some
knowledge of all this from from what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>seeing
I should be in ketosis you know I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel any different
so I so I&rsquo;ll and I&rsquo;ll go get some keto</p>
<p>strips and we&rsquo;ll find out sure enough I
was in ketosis</p>
<p>and then I thought hmm okay so I&rsquo;m
burning fat but what fat so I googled</p>
<p>that you know and he said when I read
this so there&rsquo;s no way to tell except by</p>
<p>weighing yourself am I am i burning the
fat that I eat or am i burning the fat</p>
<p>on my body you have to weigh yourself
I&rsquo;m like dead against a wing I&rsquo;m said</p>
<p>okay all right I&rsquo;ll do it this one time
I&rsquo;ll weigh myself because I knew what I</p>
<p>weighed when I went into the doctor&rsquo;s
office and lo and behold I was down 10</p>
<p>pounds I don&rsquo;t know went up to somebody
and I said do I look like I&rsquo;ve lost 10</p>
<p>pounds and they said well you know 10
pounds is hard to tell you know and I</p>
<p>said okay all right well whatever I&rsquo;m
just gonna keep on the same track</p>
<p>because my my blood shirt was
stabilizing at like 99 I thought that</p>
<p>was great you know 99 am I good 100 down
up down a little bit you know but not</p>
<p>not not 110 or anything like that if I
ever saw something go to 110 I was to</p>
<p>the gym you know and I&rsquo;d burn it off I
had learned about how your muscles and</p>
<p>everything will absorb that glue kichan
you&rsquo;ve got to use it you&rsquo;ve got to use</p>
<p>it up you got burn it up get it out so
that&rsquo;s what I was doing and I did that</p>
<p>religiously for six months and I had
absolutely no problem doing it um I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t miss any of the grains you don&rsquo;t
miss things that make your life</p>
<p>miserable
right so six months rolled around and I</p>
<p>had another blood test taken it was just
prior to going out of town had the blood</p>
<p>drawn then I headed up to Vermont and I
waited a few days till I thought the</p>
<p>test had come back or they called me and
told me that everything looked good but</p>
<p>they wanted me to cut them at 4 min and
a half and I had to lap because I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>cut you can&rsquo;t cut zero in half right I&rsquo;m
like what was that number that they want</p>
<p>me to
this metformin in half they must be</p>
<p>worried that my blood sugar is going to
drop too low yeah</p>
<p>so I called him up trying to get the
numbers out of them was like pulling</p>
<p>teeth my a1c was four point six while
medication none none and all I needed to</p>
<p>be told all that time was to cut out all
grains they&rsquo;re off-limits to me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that simple it really is that easy and
in the meantime I&rsquo;m down about 35 pounds</p>
<p>Wow and I still have the muscle I still
have the muscle I continued to work out</p>
<p>you know and doing with working with my
weights and stuff because I&rsquo;m a skier</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out here in Montana for a couple
months out of the year skiing so I was a</p>
<p>little bit worried um</p>
<p>because in the past when I&rsquo;ve lost
weight it&rsquo;s been a lot of muscle so when</p>
<p>I got out here this week my friend
invited me out to come out early I hit</p>
<p>the mountain hard I hit it for five days
straight six hours a day not a problem</p>
<p>not a problem so there&rsquo;s no there&rsquo;s no
prep and I am not eating any different</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;m having two eggs in
the morning I carry my lunch my salad</p>
<p>with me and I might have like a little
pouch of tuna with it or something like</p>
<p>that but following your advice has got
me where I am and you know I can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>any more thankful than this just being
where I am it&rsquo;s it you know and my</p>
<p>mother is so happy you know because I
put her on that diet she doesn&rsquo;t miss</p>
<p>than diabetes and she&rsquo;d say but I don&rsquo;t
have diabetes I was like yes mom but if</p>
<p>you want to do this any other thing
you&rsquo;ve got it gonna follow this you know</p>
<p>so yeah and you know my father always
struggled with it you know he as long as</p>
<p>he stayed under seven he was okay with
this doctor you know with the poor&rsquo;s ace</p>
<p>a one sing yeah cuz just to tell her
when a one c is that like average blood</p>
<p>sugars between six and three months six
weeks three months and then basically</p>
<p>normal you knows like I think five point
two to five point five or something</p>
<p>anything higher they say it&rsquo;s diabetes
so they&rsquo;re trolden this paper here that</p>
<p>I got from my doctor this is funny
actually because they&rsquo;re telling me that</p>
<p>that my preference range is four point
eight to five point six and I came in at</p>
<p>four point six which is lower than the
reference the reference range they call</p>
<p>it don&rsquo;t can you see it
I hold it up close enough there is it I</p>
<p>think I could see it well done I&rsquo;ll put
it right there at my little finger yeah</p>
<p>I see that that&rsquo;s amazing
yeah that&rsquo;s so did this doctor did all</p>
<p>the numbers but you know so this doctor
say wow your Sugar&rsquo;s down are you going</p>
<p>Wow what are you doing keep doing it get
off the medication Oh talk to them I</p>
<p>just haven&rsquo;t talked to them you know
it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve been really quite busy because</p>
<p>my father passed away this past summer
and so I&rsquo;ve been going from New York</p>
<p>like Syracuse to Florida back and forth
I&rsquo;ve been to New York I think five times</p>
<p>in Florida three times along with
running my own business and having two</p>
<p>litters of puppies you know to talk to
people that weren&rsquo;t helping me just</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t on my list of priorities right
yeah well I have an appointment to go in</p>
<p>there and see them and I thought to
myself what in the world am I seeing</p>
<p>them for because I&rsquo;m gonna throw down
$30 and I&rsquo;m doing all the work all they</p>
<p>did was draw the blood quick feet wet
right right let me get back if they want</p>
<p>to talk to me I&rsquo;ll talk to them but I
don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t see why I should pay $30</p>
<p>to tell them what their job should have
been I mean I mean do I have a point</p>
<p>here yeah you Texas yeah I&rsquo;ve been
seeing them for some quite some time and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that their job is to make
me a returning customer yeah that sound</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a sad to think that we&rsquo;re in but
that&rsquo;s where I met with this yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some unfortunately system
management of Europe so called symptoms</p>
<p>and yeah I uh when I broke my arm my arm
I went to the Orthodox and I&rsquo;m sitting</p>
<p>in the waiting room saying all these
elderly people they just go in there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on
some like this is crazy</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m going on different right I put
my water on the K 2 D 3 D 3 K to</p>
<p>whatever however you want to put it okay
she no longer uses a cane Wow</p>
<p>people tell you that herself I didn&rsquo;t
know she was using a cane she had she</p>
<p>had so much pain just trying to walk
across the room she&rsquo;s like 83 but you</p>
<p>know to see her on skype or something i
Skype with her just about every day huh</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t know that she was in that
kind of trouble that&rsquo;s for that hold</p>
<p>that Torian you know she she wouldn&rsquo;t
use it until all of her other demon gone</p>
<p>you know like mom yeah set it aside you
know you know no no she so she finally</p>
<p>went on it and then she she got back
with me and she&rsquo;s just so happy Wow yeah</p>
<p>it k2 especially as you get older drives
all the calcium others ought to show the</p>
<p>joint out of the arteries so you can
write serious pain out of a joint with</p>
<p>that k2 and the d3 that&rsquo;s awesome oh
that&rsquo;s fantastic I want to just to</p>
<p>mention one thing about you mentioned
about the insulin and kind of the</p>
<p>relationship between blood sugars
basically we have about a gal and a half</p>
<p>of blood in our body and with a gal and
a half of blood we need about one</p>
<p>teaspoon of sugar that&rsquo;s it
anything more is like way too much so</p>
<p>that one teaspoon of sugar and I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m
I&rsquo;m just giving an average like an</p>
<p>average body this is 100 I think it&rsquo;s
milliliters per deciliter whatever</p>
<p>milligrams per deciliter which basically
is 100 so we want it 100 maybe a little</p>
<p>bit lower if your if your diet is really
good because you&rsquo;re adapting to lowered</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not running on sugar anymore
you can run on blood you&rsquo;ll source so um</p>
<p>so what what&rsquo;s happening in the mountain
correction is they&rsquo;re slowly dropping</p>
<p>all these normal values to put everyone
on more medication do with cholesterol</p>
<p>to doing with a1c you&rsquo;re doing with zero
the wouldn&rsquo;t call that body body um</p>
<p>you body mastersonmike index BMI body
head they put all these people on</p>
<p>obesity just basically made obesity into
a disease and now they can treat that so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really I mean to me it&rsquo;s really
obvious some people don&rsquo;t see it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a it&rsquo;s the biggest scam on the
planet it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s terrible I know</p>
<p>that you know one of the my attention I
had read many many years probably about</p>
<p>ten years ago something about the
doctors are going to have to admit that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been wrong about cholesterol
right and that the real problem was</p>
<p>inflammation and that caught my
attention okay and then there was a</p>
<p>couple of things like this that caught
my attention from you and that&rsquo;s why I</p>
<p>started I just started watching every
video that you had you know on but I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t found any Fault in any of them
yet you know I&rsquo;m just you know I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>saying because you know after talking to
so many doctors and so many people so</p>
<p>many people are brainwashed to think
that if you you&rsquo;ve got diabetes because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re heavy
yeah right yeah weight has nothing to do</p>
<p>with it if that were a fact every
backpacker out there would have diabetes</p>
<p>right so what wasn&rsquo;t making any sense I
couldn&rsquo;t buy that either but the whole</p>
<p>thing with did once alone in your blood
just so now when I test my blood it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually coming up about 86 Wow you know
that&rsquo;s Krister day it was 80 and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s something to that I don&rsquo;t
have an answer to but it but it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>and that is I went out to dinner with a
friend and I ordered onion soup I</p>
<p>figured how bad could that be right well
when it came to me this is after my</p>
<p>blood tests of 4.6 okay when it came to
me I realized they they put a piece of</p>
<p>bread in it I&rsquo;m like what the heck who
puts bread in their soup you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like well whatever you know I just I
can&rsquo;t fight this right now I I got more</p>
<p>important things to do so I&rsquo;m like oh so
I ate the bread and then my friend David</p>
<p>is saying you want to have to see how
much I know you know I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>have a sit and then I thought you know
what I think I will I think I will</p>
<p>and it was on we were we were
Applebee&rsquo;s I think and it was on this</p>
<p>some really thick bread like sour cream
bread what do they call it sourdough</p>
<p>bread or something huge like half a loaf
of bread you know as like who who eats</p>
<p>like this right so it was a half a
sandwich so I really I got a full slice</p>
<p>of bread and then I had a full slice of
bread in my suit to yet like okay so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do this just from my own my own
experiment I use my own body as an</p>
<p>experiment so when I got home it was
just like maybe thirty minutes after we</p>
<p>ate or something and I tested my blood
and it was at 99 I&rsquo;m like okay I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>wait two hours and test it again tested
it again</p>
<p>two hours later 86 so something happened
something kicked in God your system is</p>
<p>something my system might be mmm exactly
my system might be healing wouldn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>be something I will never go back to
eating wheat flour again though I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a needful I can&rsquo;t utilize it here
all the time I thought it was me that I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t utilize it wasn&rsquo;t the me it was
it was the flour you know right so now I</p>
<p>use um uh almond flour I&rsquo;ve got it I I
don&rsquo;t travel without my own food I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got a young Yeti cooler I keep it in the
back of the truck and my mother just she</p>
<p>chuckles but she likes she thinks she
thinks this is great you know she&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>happy for me um you know some people are
always gonna be critical of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing you know but I don&rsquo;t care yeah I
was like to ask those guys okay so</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your solution you know I go you
should just keep going to the doctor I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not getting results no no I I have no
prescriptions none zero zip em you need</p>
<p>for a drugstore yeah no cream in it
right I keep thinking to myself eel so</p>
<p>weird I&rsquo;ve been going to the drugstore
every month for how long now you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t have to do this
anymore</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna hate me and I keep
thinking you know dr. Berg you better</p>
<p>watch out they&rsquo;re gonna knock him off
well yeah you know I I never like tack</p>
<p>any individual I&rsquo;m gonna attack the
system</p>
<p>so you know that I got to tell people
the truth I&rsquo;m not trying to I&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>renegade trying to like attack any
individual cuz here&rsquo;s the real problem</p>
<p>you got these medical doctors and this
is a common issue you go there and you</p>
<p>like why can&rsquo;t they see these things why
can&rsquo;t they just figure it out why are</p>
<p>they doing that went to school all this
you know this these years and they</p>
<p>should trigger this out but the whole
the whole system the school and how</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taught you don&rsquo;t have time to
evaluate the data coming in it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>garden hose filled of data that they&rsquo;re
shoving down your throat right all you</p>
<p>have to do is pass the test
memorize pass the test you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>evaluate the day to see if it&rsquo;s true
test it out to see if everything is so</p>
<p>over you know eight years nine years of
doing that you developed tremendous</p>
<p>amounts of false data in your brain and
you can&rsquo;t really you&rsquo;re not very</p>
<p>flexible or open-minded after that
you&rsquo;re very you know closed-minded this</p>
<p>is the way I was taught this is the way
we&rsquo;re going to do it so yeah they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really even understand it so it&rsquo;s just
very cookbook right now this is what we</p>
<p>do we&rsquo;re doing medicine take this so
they really have a hard time looking</p>
<p>outside the box it&rsquo;s to me it&rsquo;s almost a
version of brainwashing again it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so adamant about this
thing like like I&rsquo;ll have people that</p>
<p>will come off medication all the time
and all I&rsquo;m thinking the doctor should</p>
<p>go wow this is amazing let me share this
with my patients not one of them have</p>
<p>ever as ever well a couple had but it&rsquo;s
not very common I had a guy Kitty</p>
<p>Dallas&rsquo;s he duchesses there&rsquo;s no way
you&rsquo;re going to reverse that so we work</p>
<p>with them his port was dry that means he
he didn&rsquo;t need to filter his blood he</p>
<p>got off he didn&rsquo;t need kidney dialysis
anymore and the doctor didn&rsquo;t even want</p>
<p>to see him because it makes them wrong
just like yeah just leave just good at</p>
<p>all so you know it&rsquo;s just I think
they&rsquo;re just caught up in the system the</p>
<p>system is um there&rsquo;s not a lot of
science in it it&rsquo;s the management of</p>
<p>symptoms it&rsquo;s a big business and
unfortunately uh you know they do attack</p>
<p>alternative doctors but yeah just making
sure you don&rsquo;t step on any too</p>
<p>eatos right yeah yeah you know I&rsquo;ve um
you know I try to help people but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not a doctor and they times in or
listened to me but um proof is in the</p>
<p>package yeah yeah
yeah they&rsquo;re getting true I&rsquo;m living</p>
<p>proof and slow yeah and I&rsquo;ll tell you
and another another thing that happened</p>
<p>was my husband is like one of these
people that doesn&rsquo;t wanna listen to</p>
<p>anybody you know he&rsquo;s one of these
people right you know saying and so when</p>
<p>I was testing my blood all the time I
would like to test other people&rsquo;s blood</p>
<p>because I was so fascinated how it
doesn&rsquo;t change I&rsquo;m like that is so that</p>
<p>is so awesome I mean you know people
would purposely eat a doughnut or</p>
<p>something just so that I could test
their blood two hours and see it not</p>
<p>change you know and my husband would
never let me test his blood you know and</p>
<p>finally he decided I guess to jump on
the bandwagon right he had had a steak</p>
<p>he loved these huge steaks huge potatoes
you know for supper and I probably had a</p>
<p>salad or something right
and um and two hours had gone by and I</p>
<p>was testing my blood I would come out
and tell him what my numbers were and</p>
<p>then he goes you can test mine oh I
jumped on that one</p>
<p>you know I saw I buy tested too but he
was eating some watermelon at the time I</p>
<p>tested his blood and I just whoa I
backed up right</p>
<p>was it 272 without he reacted ah yeah he
got up he walked in the kitchen and spit</p>
<p>the watermelon in the sink I said you
really want to see something come back</p>
<p>in two hours and again he could lose his
job over that Wow</p>
<p>yes wake up call yeah because he has a
CDL license he is high voltage and you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be going around with us with
syrupy blood you know so now he thought</p>
<p>that he had had issues with his prostate
or something because he had urinate so</p>
<p>much at night
but now he thinks what it was is the</p>
<p>sugar was too high so anyways I made a
doctor&rsquo;s appointment for him the next</p>
<p>day and for some reason they wanted me
to come in there with him so I went in</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;m not
wanting people that hanging over him and</p>
<p>mother him and stuff like that I figure
he&rsquo;s a grown man he can handle it</p>
<p>wrong wrong right so come to find out he
had had an a1c taken two years ago I</p>
<p>said really because he was telling me he
was his doctor said he was healthy and</p>
<p>everything and I take one look at him
and say I&rsquo;d like to talk to your doctors</p>
<p>you know so the doctor looked it up and
it was seven point eight or something</p>
<p>two years ago and I looked at him and I
said seven point eight you hear me talk</p>
<p>about the numbers all the time at what
point did you think that there was</p>
<p>nothing wrong with this right and then
he got all puffy I&rsquo;d you know like you</p>
<p>know yeah you know okay so they drew
some blood and they did an a1c right</p>
<p>there in the office okay and they come
to find out they had put him on some</p>
<p>pill because he can&rsquo;t take metformin he
only has one kidney so he can&rsquo;t take med</p>
<p>forms they put him on something else
which he decided he didn&rsquo;t need because</p>
<p>it was a hundred bucks a month for this
pill okay</p>
<p>so the doctor left the office and when
she came through she she came flying</p>
<p>through that door slammed that door wide
open BAM</p>
<p>his a1c was eleven point something she
wanted to him you&rsquo;re going on insulin</p>
<p>right now no if ands or buts about it
and he pitched a fit and and I pitched a</p>
<p>fit you know it was like oh good yeah we
were it was on in the doctor&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>right so I&rsquo;m like look they&rsquo;ll just do
it until you bring it down and then we</p>
<p>will manage it okay so he went home with
the insulin and he started to stick it</p>
<p>once a night until he could get it down
to about 140 120 something like that it</p>
<p>was taking along little longer than he
wanted he wanted it down right now you</p>
<p>know
but I told him I said you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to go work out right yeah so yeah so he
did that and he ordered his pills you</p>
<p>know and I said look I tell you what
we&rsquo;ll go to the Noland trail in Newport</p>
<p>News if you&rsquo;ve ever been there it&rsquo;s a
beautiful trail rolls over hills through</p>
<p>the woods and it&rsquo;s five miles long and
then I started thinking we can&rsquo;t run</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know what condition his
heart is in I you know I was really</p>
<p>worried and it&rsquo;s out through the woods
and I&rsquo;m like we&rsquo;ll walk it and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make it last two hours and this will
bring it down 50 points and it brought</p>
<p>it down 50 points and then you know he
kept on he would go for a run you run a</p>
<p>mile just around the block and he got it
down to a bow look it was ranging</p>
<p>between 99 and a hundred and ten or
something like that you know whatever I</p>
<p>said okay now stop everything just
manage it here your diet and exercise</p>
<p>mm-hmm and then he called his doctor
right cuz he had an appointment I think</p>
<p>three weeks later something like that he
went back and saw her and he had been</p>
<p>keeping his records and everything and
she said she&rsquo;s never seen anybody get</p>
<p>that sugar under control so fast in her
life ah he was motivated good coach and</p>
<p>she got this I know you did yeah yeah I
know really was all due to your help</p>
<p>hmm that&rsquo;s so great I really hope now he
follows your advice and he sticks to it</p>
<p>yes thank you so much Elaine for doing
this presentation I wanted to I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>let you go um but I really it was a
wonderful story and I appreciate what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing I&rsquo;m spreading the word and
