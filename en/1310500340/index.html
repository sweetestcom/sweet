    <p>The following is a conversation with Ben Shapiro, a conservative political commentator, host</p>
<p>of The Ben Shapiro Show, co-founder of The Daily Wire, and author of several books, including</p>
<p>The Authoritarian Moment, The Right Side of History, and Facts Don&rsquo;t Care About Your Feelings.</p>
<p>Whatever your political leanings, I humbly ask that you try to put those aside and listen</p>
<p>with an open mind, trying to give the most charitable interpretation of the words we</p>
<p>say.</p>
<p>This is true in general for this podcast, whether the guest is Ben Shapiro or Alexandria</p>
<p>Ocasio-Cortez, Donald Trump or Barack Obama.</p>
<p>I will talk to everyone, from every side, from the far left to the far right, from presidents</p>
<p>to prisoners, from artists to scientists, from the powerful to the powerless, because</p>
<p>we are all human, all capable of good and evil, all with fascinating stories and ideas</p>
<p>to explore.</p>
<p>I seek only to understand, and in so doing, hopefully, add a bit of love to the world.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description, it&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got ExpressVPN for privacy, PolicyGenius for life insurance, BetterHelp for therapy,</p>
<p>and InsightTracker for biological monitoring.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, on to the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle, I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out the sponsors, I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by a long-time, beloved sponsor of mine, ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using them for many, many, many years.</p>
<p>It has brought joy to my heart for many reasons, some of which you can infer, because it has</p>
<p>opened my mind and my spirit to the internet while keeping me protected, which is what</p>
<p>a great VPN does, and that&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve always used, it&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve always recommended.</p>
<p>It always had the big, sexy button that you just press and everything works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super, super easy.</p>
<p>It works really fast, wherever the geographical region you connect to, at least all the places</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried, it&rsquo;s super fast, works on any device, Linux included.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of amazing that I haven&rsquo;t talked to Linus Torvald yet.</p>
<p>Not sure why, exactly.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really tried, and he doesn&rsquo;t actually make himself super easy to reach.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a man who focuses on his work, which of course I deeply respect.</p>
<p>Go to expressvpn.com slash LexPod for an extra three months free.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Policy Genius, which is a marketplace for finding</p>
<p>and buying insurance.</p>
<p>I do wonder, since on this podcast we talk about immortality sometimes, what happens</p>
<p>to life insurance when you&rsquo;re genetically guaranteed to be immortal?</p>
<p>I mean, because there&rsquo;s not gonna be 100% guarantee, obviously.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be ways to destroy the genetic material, where you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to</p>
<p>reprint your body and mind, or at least you won&rsquo;t be able to reprint memories.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll be insurance on your memories, like you&rsquo;re not going to insure the life of</p>
<p>your body and everything within it, but you&rsquo;re going to insure the data, the information</p>
<p>inside your brain.</p>
<p>If it gets corrupted and destroyed, the people you love will get some money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting future idea, but unfortunately or fortunately, depends where</p>
<p>you land on the debate, we live in a time when all of us do face mortality, and it always</p>
<p>comes too soon and unexpected.</p>
<p>So for that, you should have life insurance.</p>
<p>With Policy Genius, you can find life insurance policies that start at just $70 a month for</p>
<p>$500,000 of coverage.</p>
<p>Head to policygenius.com or click the link in the description to get your free life insurance</p>
<p>quotes and see how much you could save.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s policygenius.com.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by BetterHelp, spelled H-E-L-P, HELP, every time I say that</p>
<p>I think about Tom Hanks in the movie Cast Away, which I think is not a critically acclaimed</p>
<p>movie, but I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about a man alone against the elements, faced with a sort of explicit</p>
<p>manifestation of his loneliness.</p>
<p>Most of us walk about our lives with our loneliness on the inside.</p>
<p>Here that loneliness is made explicit, it&rsquo;s real, it&rsquo;s made unavoidable.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t lose ourselves in the daily busyness of life with the people around us.</p>
<p>We have to face that loneliness when you&rsquo;re alone on an island.</p>
<p>And even then, we find camaraderie with a volleyball.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>And write HELP on the sand, hoping somebody will save us.</p>
<p>So here we are, not alone on an island, but nevertheless are deeply lonely, deeply troubled,</p>
<p>and are looking for ways to become better versions of ourselves.</p>
<p>For that, talk therapy is great.</p>
<p>I recommend BetterHelp for that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Check them out at betterhelp.com slash Lex, and save on your first month.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Inside Tracker, a service I use to track biological</p>
<p>data that comes from my body and gives me wisdom about which way I should walk through</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Lifestyle changes, diet recommendations, all to improve my life.</p>
<p>The trajectory of your life should not be defined by a blog post you read somewhere,</p>
<p>an advice column in a magazine with a sexy guy or girl on the cover.</p>
<p>It should come from the data that comes from your own body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the 21st century.</p>
<p>There needs to be machine learning algorithms that integrate as much data as possible that</p>
<p>comes from the body, obviously in a privacy-preserving way, and then give you recommendations based</p>
<p>on that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what works for the population.</p>
<p>What matters is what works for you and you alone.</p>
<p>Individualized, personalized, health, life, everything.</p>
<p>What do I do in this world?</p>
<p>Please tell me.</p>
<p>Please tell me, oh wise oracle.</p>
<p>Of course, the oracle&rsquo;s not going to be able to tell you everything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to figure out some of it on your own, but it&rsquo;s always nice to have</p>
<p>a mentor, somebody to give you words of advice, even if you choose to ignore them.</p>
<p>Anyway, get special savings for a limited time when you go to insidetracker.com slash</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Ben Shapiro.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a difficult topic.</p>
<p>What do you think about the comments made by Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, about</p>
<p>Jewish people?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re awful and anti-Semitic, and they seem to get worse over time.</p>
<p>They started off with the bizarre DEFCON 3 tweet, and then they went into even more</p>
<p>stereotypical garbage about Jews, and Jews being sexual manipulators.</p>
<p>I think that was the Pete Davidson, Kim Kardashian stuff, and then Jews running all of the media,</p>
<p>Jews being in charge of the financial sector, Jewish people.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no, I mean, I called it on my show, there&rsquo;s Sherman Nazism, and it is.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like right from Protocols of the Elders of Zion type stuff.</p>
<p>Do you think those words come from pain?</p>
<p>Where do they come from?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s always hard to try and read somebody&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>What he looks like to me, just having experience in my own family of people who are bipolar,</p>
<p>he seems like a bipolar personality.</p>
<p>He seems like somebody who is in the middle of a manic episode, and when you&rsquo;re manic,</p>
<p>you tend to say a lot of things that you shouldn&rsquo;t say, and you tend to believe that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the most brilliant things ever said.</p>
<p>The Washington Post did an entire piece speculating about how bipolarism played into the kind</p>
<p>of stuff that Ye was saying, and it&rsquo;s hard for me to think that it&rsquo;s not playing into</p>
<p>it, especially because even if he is an anti-Semite, and I have no reason to suspect he&rsquo;s not given</p>
<p>all of his comments, if he had an ounce of common sense, he would stop at a certain point,</p>
<p>and bipolarism tends to drive you well past the point where common sense applies.</p>
<p>So I mean, I would imagine it&rsquo;s coming from that.</p>
<p>I mean, from his comments, I would also imagine that he&rsquo;s doing the logical mistake that a</p>
<p>lot of anti-Semites or racists or bigots do, which is, somebody hurt me, that person is</p>
<p>a Jew, therefore, all Jews are bad.</p>
<p>And that jump from a person did something to me I don&rsquo;t like, who&rsquo;s a member of a particular</p>
<p>race or class, and therefore, everybody of that race or class is bad, I mean, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>textbook bigotry, and that&rsquo;s pretty obviously what Ye&rsquo;s engaging in here.</p>
<p>So jumping from the individual to the group.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way he&rsquo;s been expressing it, right?</p>
<p>He keeps talking about his Jewish agents, and I watched your interview with him, and</p>
<p>you kept saying, so just name the agents, right?</p>
<p>Just name the people who are screwing you.</p>
<p>And he wouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Instead, he just kept going back to the general, the group, the Jews in general.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s textbook bigotry.</p>
<p>And if it were put in any other context, he would probably recognize it as such.</p>
<p>To the degree as words fuel hate in the world, what&rsquo;s the way to reverse that process?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the way to alleviate the hate?</p>
<p>I mean, when it comes to alleviating the kind of stuff that he&rsquo;s saying, obviously debunking</p>
<p>it, you know, making clear that what he&rsquo;s saying is garbage, but the reality is that</p>
<p>I think that for most people who are in any way engaged with these issues, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being convinced to be anti-Semitic by Ye.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that there&rsquo;s a group of people who may be swayed that anti-Semitism is acceptable</p>
<p>because Ye is saying what he&rsquo;s saying, and he&rsquo;s saying so very loudly, and he&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>it over and over.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think that, for example, there are these signs that are popping up in Los</p>
<p>Angeles saying Ye is right.</p>
<p>Well, that group&rsquo;s been out there posting anti-Semitic signs on the freeways for years.</p>
<p>And there are groups like that posting anti-Semitic signs where I live in Florida.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been doing that for years, well before Ye was saying this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like latest opportunity to kind of jump on that particular bandwagon.</p>
<p>But listen, I think that people do have a moral duty to call that stuff out.</p>
<p>So there is a degree to which it normalizes that kind of idea that Jews control the media,</p>
<p>Jews control X institution.</p>
<p>Is there a way to talk about a high representation of a group like Jewish people in a certain</p>
<p>institution like the media or Hollywood and so on without it being a hateful conversation?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>A high percentage of higher than statistically represented in the population.</p>
<p>Percentage of Hollywood agents are probably Jewish.</p>
<p>A higher percentage of lawyers generally are probably Jewish.</p>
<p>A high percentage of accountants are probably Jewish.</p>
<p>Also, a higher percentage of engineers are probably Asian.</p>
<p>Like the statistical truths are statistical truths.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean anything about the nature of the people who are being talked</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>There are a myriad of reasons why people might be disproportionately in one arena or another,</p>
<p>ranging from the cultural to sometimes the genetic.</p>
<p>I mean, there are certain areas of the world where people are better long distance runners</p>
<p>because of their genetic adaptations in those particular areas of the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not racist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just fact.</p>
<p>What starts to get racist is when you are attributing a bad characteristic to an entire</p>
<p>population based on the notion that some members of that population are doing bad things.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a jump between.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that record label owners as a group have a kind of culture that Fs over</p>
<p>artists, doesn&rsquo;t treat artists fairly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also possible that there&rsquo;s a high representation of Jews in the group of people</p>
<p>that own record labels.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s that small, but a very big leap that people take from the group that own record</p>
<p>labels to all Jews for sure.</p>
<p>And I think that one of the other issues also is that antisemitism is fascinating because</p>
<p>it breaks down into so many different parts, meaning that if you look at sort of different</p>
<p>types of antisemitism, if you&rsquo;re a racist against black people, it&rsquo;s typically because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re racist based on the color of their skin.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re racist, if you&rsquo;re racist against the Jews, you&rsquo;re antisemitic, then there are</p>
<p>actually a few different ways that breaks down, right?</p>
<p>You have antisemitism in terms of ethnicity, which is like Nazi ask antisemitism.</p>
<p>You have Jewish parentage, you have a Jewish grandparent.</p>
<p>Therefore, you are your blood is corrupt and you are inherently going to have bad properties.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s sort of old school religious antisemitism, which is that the Jews are</p>
<p>the killers of Christ or the Jews are the sons of pigs and monkeys.</p>
<p>And therefore, Judaism is bad.</p>
<p>And therefore, Jews are bad and sort of in the way that you get out of that antisemitism,</p>
<p>historically speaking, is mass conversion, which most antisemitism for a couple thousand</p>
<p>years actually was not ethnic.</p>
<p>It was it was much more rooted in this sort of stuff, right?</p>
<p>If a Jew converted out of the faith, then the antisemitism was quote unquote alleviated.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a sort of bizarre antisemitism that&rsquo;s political antisemitism.</p>
<p>And that is members of a group that I don&rsquo;t like are disproportionately Jewish.</p>
<p>Therefore, all Jews are are members of this group or are predominantly represented in</p>
<p>this group.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll see Nazis saying the communists are Jews.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see communists saying the Nazis are Jews or you&rsquo;ll see communists saying that</p>
<p>the capitalists rather are Jews.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the weird thing about antisemitism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the Jews behind every corner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a big conspiracy theory, unlike a lot of other forms of racism, which are</p>
<p>not really conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Antisemitism tends to be a conspiracy theory about believers of power being controlled</p>
<p>by a shadowy cadre of people who are getting together behind closed doors to control things.</p>
<p>Yeah, the most absurd illustration of antisemitism, just like you said, is Stalin versus</p>
<p>Hitler over Poland, that every bad guy was a Jew.</p>
<p>It was like so every enemy, there&rsquo;s a lot of different enemy groups, intellectuals,</p>
<p>political and so on, military and behind any movement that is considered the enemy for</p>
<p>the Nazis and any movement that&rsquo;s considered the enemy for the Soviet army are the Jews.</p>
<p>What does the fact that Hitler took power teach you about human nature?</p>
<p>When you look back at the history of the 20th century, what do you learn from that time?</p>
<p>I mean, there are a bunch of lessons to Hitler taking power.</p>
<p>The first thing I think people ought to recognize about Hitler taking power is that the power</p>
<p>had been centralized in the government before Hitler took it.</p>
<p>So if you actually look at the history of Nazi Germany, the Weimar Republic had effectively</p>
<p>collapsed.</p>
<p>The power had been centralized in the chancellery and really under Hindenburg for a couple of</p>
<p>years before that.</p>
<p>And so it was only a matter of time until someone who was bad grabbed the power.</p>
<p>And so the struggle between the Reds and the Browns in Nazism in pre-Nazi Germany led to</p>
<p>this kind of up spiraling of radical sentiment that allowed Hitler in through the front door,</p>
<p>not through the back door, right?</p>
<p>He was elected.</p>
<p>So you think communists could have also taken power?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no question communists could have taken power.</p>
<p>They were a serious force in pre-Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Do you think there was an underlying current that would have led to an atrocity if the</p>
<p>communists had taken power?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t have been quite the same atrocity, but obviously the communists in Soviet Russia</p>
<p>at exactly this time were committing the Haladomar, right?</p>
<p>So there were very few good guys in terms of good parties.</p>
<p>The moderate parties were being dragged by the radicals into alliance with them to prevent</p>
<p>the worst case scenario from the other guy, right?</p>
<p>So if you look at, I&rsquo;m sort of fascinated by the history of this period because it really</p>
<p>does speak to how does a democracy break down?</p>
<p>I mean, the 20s, Weimar Republic was a very liberal democracy.</p>
<p>How does a liberal democracy break down into complete fascism and then into genocide?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a character who, you know, was very prominent in the history of that time</p>
<p>named Franz von Papen, who was actually the second to last chancellor of the Republic</p>
<p>before Hitler.</p>
<p>So he was the chancellor and then he handed over to Schleicher and then he ended up, Schleicher</p>
<p>ended up collapsing and that ended up handing power over to Hitler.</p>
<p>It was Papen who had stumped for Hitler to become chancellor.</p>
<p>Papen was a Catholic Democrat.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t like Hitler.</p>
<p>He thought that Hitler was a radical and a nut job, but he also thought that Hitler being</p>
<p>a buffoon, as he saw it, was going to essentially be usable by the right forces in order to</p>
<p>get the, in order to prevent the communists from taking power, maybe in order to restore</p>
<p>some sort of legitimacy to the regime because he was popular in order for Papen to retain</p>
<p>power himself.</p>
<p>And then immediately after Hitler taking power, Hitler basically kills all of Papen&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>Papen, out of quote unquote loyalty, stays on.</p>
<p>He ends up helping the Anschluss in Austria.</p>
<p>Now, all this stuff is really interesting mainly because what it speaks to is the great</p>
<p>lie we tell ourselves that people who are evil are not like us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a class apart.</p>
<p>People who do evil things, people who support evil people, people, they&rsquo;re not like us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an easy call.</p>
<p>Everybody, everybody in history who has sinned is a person who&rsquo;s very different from me.</p>
<p>Robert George, the philosopher over at Princeton, he&rsquo;s fond of doing a sort of thought experiment</p>
<p>in his classes where he asks people to raise their hand if they had lived in Alabama in</p>
<p>1861, how many of you would be abolitionists?</p>
<p>And everybody raises their hand.</p>
<p>He says, of course, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>The best protection against evil is recognizing that it lies in every human heart and the</p>
<p>possibility that it takes you over.</p>
<p>And so you have to be very cautious in how you approach these issues.</p>
<p>And the back and forth of politics, the sort of bipolarity of politics, or the polarization</p>
<p>in politics might be a better way to put it, you know, makes it very easy to kind of fall</p>
<p>into the rock&rsquo;em, sock&rsquo;em robots that eventually could theoretically allow you to support somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s truly frightening and hideous in order to stop somebody who you think is more frightening</p>
<p>and hideous.</p>
<p>And you see this kind of language, by the way, now predominating almost all over the</p>
<p>Western world, right?</p>
<p>My political enemy is an enemy of democracy.</p>
<p>My political enemy is going to end the republic.</p>
<p>My political enemy is going to be the person who destroys the country we live in.</p>
<p>And so that person has to be stopped by any means necessary.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s dangerous stuff.</p>
<p>So the communists had to be stopped in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re the devil.</p>
<p>And so any useful buffoon, as long as they&rsquo;re effective against the communists, would do.</p>
<p>Do you ever wonder, because the people that are participating in evil may not understand</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing evil.</p>
<p>Do you ever sit back, you know, in the quiet of your mind and think, am I participating</p>
<p>in evil?</p>
<p>So my business partner and I, one of our favorite memes is from, there&rsquo;s a British comedy show,</p>
<p>the name escapes me, of these two guys who are members of the SS.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re dressed in the SS uniforms and the black uniforms with the skulls on them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re saying to each other, one says to the other guy, you notice like the British,</p>
<p>their symbol is something nice.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like an eagle.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a skull and crossbones.</p>
<p>You see the Americans, you see their blue uniforms, they&rsquo;re very nice and pretty.</p>
<p>Ours are jet black.</p>
<p>Are we the baddies?</p>
<p>And the truth is, we look back at the Nazis and we say, well, of course they were the</p>
<p>baddies.</p>
<p>They wore black uniforms and they had jackboots and they had this.</p>
<p>And of course they were the bad guys.</p>
<p>But evil rarely presents its face so clearly.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, I think you have to constantly be thinking along those lines.</p>
<p>And hopefully you try to avoid it.</p>
<p>You can only do the best that a human being can do.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>If I would say that I spend an inordinate amount of time reflecting on whether I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>the right thing.</p>
<p>And I may not always do the right thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people think that I&rsquo;m doing the wrong thing on a daily basis.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s definitely a question that has to enter your mind as a historically aware and</p>
<p>hopefully morally decent person.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;re mentally strong enough if you realize that you&rsquo;re on the wrong side</p>
<p>of history to switch sides?</p>
<p>Very few people in history seem to be strong enough to do that.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that the answer I hope would be yes.</p>
<p>You never know until the time comes and you have to do it.</p>
<p>I will say that having heterodox opinions in a wide variety of areas is something that</p>
<p>I have done before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the only person I&rsquo;ve ever heard of in public life who actually has a list on their</p>
<p>website of all the dumb, stupid things I&rsquo;ve ever said.</p>
<p>So where I go through and I either say this is why I still believe this or this is why</p>
<p>what I said was terrible and stupid.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that list will get a lot longer.</p>
<p>Yeah, look forward to new additions.</p>
<p>It actually is a super, super long list.</p>
<p>People should check it out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite honest and raw.</p>
<p>What do you think about, it&rsquo;s interesting to ask you given how pro-life you are about</p>
<p>Ye&rsquo;s comments about comparing the Holocaust to the 900,000 abortions in the United States</p>
<p>a year.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll take this from two angles.</p>
<p>As a pro-life person, I actually didn&rsquo;t find it offensive.</p>
<p>Because if you believe, as I do, that unborn and pre-born lives deserve protection, then</p>
<p>the slaughter of just under a million of them every year for the last almost 50 years is</p>
<p>a historic tragedy on par with a Holocaust.</p>
<p>From the outside perspective, I get why people would say there&rsquo;s a difference in how people</p>
<p>view the pre-born as to how people view, say, a seven-year-old who&rsquo;s being killed in the</p>
<p>Holocaust.</p>
<p>Like the visceral power and evil of the Nazis shoving full-grown human beings and small</p>
<p>children into gas chambers can&rsquo;t be compared to a person who, even from a pro-life perspective,</p>
<p>may not fully understand the consequences of their own decisions or from a pro-choice</p>
<p>perspective fully understands the consequences but just doesn&rsquo;t think that that person is</p>
<p>a person.</p>
<p>That that&rsquo;s actually different.</p>
<p>I understand both sides of it.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t offended by Ye&rsquo;s comments in that way, though.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re a pro-life human being, then you do think that what&rsquo;s happening is</p>
<p>a great tragedy on scale that involves the dehumanization of an entire class of people,</p>
<p>the pre-born.</p>
<p>So the philosophical, you understand the comparison.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So in his comments, in the jumping from the individual to the group, I&rsquo;d like to ask</p>
<p>you, you&rsquo;re one of the most effective people in the world at attacking the left.</p>
<p>And sometimes they can slip into attacking the group.</p>
<p>Do you worry that that&rsquo;s the same kind of oversimplification that Ye is doing about</p>
<p>Jewish people that you can sometimes do with the left as a group?</p>
<p>So when I speak about the left, I&rsquo;m speaking about a philosophy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not really speaking about individual human beings as the leftists-like group and</p>
<p>then try to name who the members of this individual group are.</p>
<p>I also make a distinction between the left and liberals.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who are liberal who disagree with me on taxes, disagree with</p>
<p>me on foreign policy, disagree with me on a lot of things.</p>
<p>The people who I&rsquo;m talking about generally, and I talk about the left in the United States,</p>
<p>are people who believe that alternative points of view ought to be silenced because they</p>
<p>are damaging and harmful simply based on the disagreement.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one distinction.</p>
<p>The second distinction, again, is when I talk about the right versus the left, typically</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about a battle of competing philosophies.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not speaking about typically.</p>
<p>It would be hard to, if you put a person in front of me and said, is this person of the</p>
<p>left or of the right?</p>
<p>Having just met them, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to label them in the same way that if you met</p>
<p>somebody in the name of Greenstein, you&rsquo;d immediately got you.</p>
<p>Or you met a black person, it&rsquo;s a black person.</p>
<p>And the adherence to a philosophy makes you a member of a group.</p>
<p>If I think the philosophy is bad, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you as a person are</p>
<p>bad, but it does mean that I think your philosophy is bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the grouping is based on the philosophy versus something like a race, like the color</p>
<p>of your skin or race as in the case of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a different thing.</p>
<p>You can be a little bit more nonchalant and careless in attacking a group because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ultimately attacking a set of ideas.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s really nonchalant in attacking the set of ideas.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that nonchalant would be the way I&rsquo;d put it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d try to be exact when you&rsquo;re, you know, you don&rsquo;t always hit, but, you know, if I</p>
<p>say that I oppose the communists, right?</p>
<p>And then presumably I&rsquo;m speaking of people who believe in the communist philosophy.</p>
<p>Now, the question is whether I&rsquo;m mislabeling, right?</p>
<p>Whether I&rsquo;m taking someone who&rsquo;s not actually a communist and then shoving them in that</p>
<p>group of communists, right?</p>
<p>That would be inaccurate.</p>
<p>The dangerous thing is it expands the group as opposed to you talking about the philosophy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re throwing everybody who&rsquo;s ever said, I&rsquo;m curious about communism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about socialism.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s like a gradient.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like to throw something at you.</p>
<p>I think Joe Biden said, MAGA Republicans, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, I think that&rsquo;s a very careless statement because the thing you jump to immediately</p>
<p>is like all Republicans for Trump versus I think in the charitable interpretation, that</p>
<p>means a set of ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My actually problem with the MAGA Republicans line from Biden is that he went on in the</p>
<p>speech that he made in front of Independence Hall to actually try and define what it meant</p>
<p>to be a MAGA Republican who was a threat to the Republic was the kind of language that</p>
<p>he was using.</p>
<p>And later on in the speech, he actually suggested, well, you know, there are moderate Republicans</p>
<p>and the moderate Republicans are people who agree with me on like the Inflation Reduction</p>
<p>Act.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, that can&rsquo;t be the dividing line between a MAGA Republican and a moderate</p>
<p>like a moderate Republican, somebody who agrees with you that you got to name me like a Republican</p>
<p>who disagrees with you fairly strenuously, but is not in this group of threats to the</p>
<p>Republic.</p>
<p>You make that distinction.</p>
<p>We can have a fair discussion about whether the idea of election denial, for example,</p>
<p>make somebody, you know, a threat to institutions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a conversation that we can have and then we&rsquo;ll have to discuss how much power</p>
<p>they have, you know, what the actual perspective is, delve into it.</p>
<p>But, you know, I think that he was being overbroad and sort of labeling all of his political</p>
<p>enemies under one rubric.</p>
<p>Now, again, in politics, this stuff sort of happens all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to plead clean hands here because I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;ve been inexact.</p>
<p>But somebody will be good in that particular situation is for somebody to sort of read</p>
<p>me back the quote and I&rsquo;ll let you know where I&rsquo;ve been inaccurate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to do that.</p>
<p>And also you don&rsquo;t shy away from humor and occasional trolling and mockery and all that</p>
<p>kind of stuff for the fun, for the chaos, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, I try not to do trollery for trollery sake, but, you know, if the show is not entertaining</p>
<p>and not fun, people aren&rsquo;t going to listen.</p>
<p>And so, you know, if you can&rsquo;t have fun with politics, the truth about politics is we all</p>
<p>take it very seriously because it has some serious ramifications.</p>
<p>Politics is veep.</p>
<p>It is not house of cards.</p>
<p>The general rule of politics is that everyone is a moron unless proven otherwise, that virtually</p>
<p>everything is done out of stupidity rather than malice, and that if you actually watch</p>
<p>politics as a comedy, you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun.</p>
<p>And so the difficulty for me is I take politics seriously, but also I have the ability to</p>
<p>sort of flip the switch and suddenly it all becomes incredibly funny because it really</p>
<p>is like if you just watch it from pure entertainment perspective and you put aside the fact that</p>
<p>it affects hundreds of millions of people, then watching, you know, President Trump being</p>
<p>president, I mean, he&rsquo;s one of the funniest humans who&rsquo;s ever lived.</p>
<p>Watching Kamala Harris be Kamala Harris and talking about how much she loves Venn diagrams</p>
<p>or electric buses.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s funny stuff.</p>
<p>So if I can&rsquo;t make fun of that, then my job becomes pretty morose pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny to figure out what is the perfect balance between seeing the humor and</p>
<p>the absurdity of the game of it versus taking it seriously enough because it does affect</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird balance to strike.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I am afraid with the internet that everything becomes a joke.</p>
<p>I totally agree with this.</p>
<p>I will say this.</p>
<p>I try to make less jokes about the ideas and more jokes about the people in the same way</p>
<p>that I make jokes about myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty self-effacing in terms of my humor.</p>
<p>I would say at least half the jokes on my show are about me.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m reading ads for Tommy John and they&rsquo;re talking about their no wedgie guarantee, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>say things like, you know, that would help me in high school because it would have.</p>
<p>I mean, just factually speaking.</p>
<p>So if I can speak that way about myself, I feel like everybody else can take it as well.</p>
<p>A difficult question.</p>
<p>In 2017, there was a mosque shooting in Quebec City.</p>
<p>Six people died, five others seriously injured.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old gunman consumed a lot of content online and checked Twitter accounts a lot</p>
<p>of a lot of people.</p>
<p>But one of the people he checked quite a lot of is you.</p>
<p>93 times in the month leading up to the shooting.</p>
<p>If you could talk to that young man, what would you tell him?</p>
<p>And maybe other young men listening to this that have hate in their heart in that same</p>
<p>way, what would you tell him?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting it wrong.</p>
<p>If anything that I or anyone else in mainstream politics says drives you to violence, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting it wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting it wrong.</p>
<p>Now, again, when it comes to stuff like this, I have a hard and fast rule that I&rsquo;ve applied</p>
<p>evenly across the spectrum, and that is I never blame people&rsquo;s politics for other people</p>
<p>committing acts of violence unless they&rsquo;re actively advocating violence.</p>
<p>So when a fan of Bernie Sanders shoots up a congressional baseball game, that is not</p>
<p>Bernie Sanders&rsquo; fault.</p>
<p>I may not like his rhetoric.</p>
<p>I may disagree with him on everything.</p>
<p>Bernie Sanders did not tell somebody to go shoot up a congressional baseball game.</p>
<p>When a nutcase in San Francisco goes and hits Paul Pelosi with a hammer, I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>blame Kevin McCarthy, the House Speaker, for that.</p>
<p>When somebody threatens Brett Kavanaugh, I&rsquo;m not going to suggest that that was Joe Biden&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fault because it&rsquo;s not Joe Biden&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>I mean, we can play this game all day long, and I find that the people who are most intensely</p>
<p>focused on playing this game are people who tend to oppose the politics of the person</p>
<p>as opposed to actually believing sincerely that this has driven somebody into the arms</p>
<p>of the god of violence.</p>
<p>But, you know, I have 4.7 million Twitter followers.</p>
<p>I have 8 million Facebook followers.</p>
<p>I have 5 million YouTube followers.</p>
<p>I would imagine that some of them are people who are violent.</p>
<p>I would imagine that some of them are people who do evil things or want to do evil things.</p>
<p>And I wish that there were a wand that we could wave that would prevent those people</p>
<p>from deliberately or mistakenly misinterpreting things as a call to violence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a negative byproduct of the fact that you can reach a lot of people.</p>
<p>And so, you know, if somebody could point me to the comment that I suppose, quote unquote,</p>
<p>drove somebody to go and literally murder human beings, then I would appreciate it so</p>
<p>I could talk about the comment.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, mainly because I just think that if we remove agency from individuals</p>
<p>and if we blame broad scale political rhetoric for every act of violence, we&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to, the people who are going to pay the price are actually the general population because</p>
<p>free speech will go away.</p>
<p>If the idea is that things that we say could drive somebody who is unbalanced to go do</p>
<p>something evil, the necessary byproduct is hate, is that speech is a form of hate.</p>
<p>Hate is a form of violence.</p>
<p>Speech is a form of violence.</p>
<p>Speech needs to be curbed.</p>
<p>And that to me is deeply disturbing.</p>
<p>So definitely he, that man, that 27 year old man is the only one responsible for the evil</p>
<p>he did.</p>
<p>But what if he and others like him are not in our cases?</p>
<p>What if they&rsquo;re people with pain, with anger in their heart?</p>
<p>What would you say to them?</p>
<p>You are exceptionally influential and other people like you that speak passionately about</p>
<p>ideas.</p>
<p>What do you think is your opportunity to alleviate the hate in their heart?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re speaking about people who aren&rsquo;t mentally ill and people who are just misguided,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say to him, the thing that I said to every other young man in the country, you need to</p>
<p>find meaning and purpose in forming connections that actually matter in a belief system that</p>
<p>actually promotes general prosperity and promotes helping other people.</p>
<p>And this is why, you know, the message that I most commonly say to young men is it&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>for you to grow up, mature, get a job, get married, have a family, take care of the people</p>
<p>around you, become a useful part of your community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never at any point in my entire career suggested violence as a resort to political</p>
<p>issues.</p>
<p>And the whole point of having a political conversation is that it&rsquo;s a conversation.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t think that it were worth trying to convince people, from my point of view,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t do what I do for a living.</p>
<p>So violence doesn&rsquo;t solve anything.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>As if this wasn&rsquo;t already a difficult conversation.</p>
<p>Let me ask about Ilhan Omar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve called out her criticism of Israel policies as anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>Is there a difference between criticizing a race of people like the Jews and criticizing</p>
<p>the policies of a nation like Israel?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I criticize the policies of Israel on a fairly regular basis.</p>
<p>I would assume from a different angle than Ilhan Omar does.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, I criticize the policies of a wide variety of states.</p>
<p>And to take an example, I mean, I&rsquo;ve criticized Israel&rsquo;s policy in giving control of the</p>
<p>Temple Mount to the Islamic Waqf, which effectively prevents anybody except for Muslims from praying</p>
<p>up there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also criticized the Israeli government for their COVID crackdown.</p>
<p>I mean, you can criticize the policies of any government, but that&rsquo;s not what Ilhan</p>
<p>Omar does.</p>
<p>Ilhan Omar doesn&rsquo;t actually believe that there should be a state of Israel.</p>
<p>She believes that Zionism is racism and that the existence of a Jewish state in Israel</p>
<p>is in and of itself the great sin.</p>
<p>That is a statement she would make about no other people in no other land.</p>
<p>She would not say that the French don&rsquo;t deserve a state for the French.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t say that Somalis wouldn&rsquo;t deserve a state in Somalia.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t say that Germans don&rsquo;t deserve a state in Germany.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t say for the 50 plus Islamic states that exist across the world that they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t deserve states of their own.</p>
<p>It is only the Jewish state that has fallen under her significant scrutiny.</p>
<p>And she also promulgates lies about one specific state in the form of suggesting, for example,</p>
<p>that Israel is an apartheid state, which it is most eminently not, considering that the</p>
<p>last unity government in Israel included an Arab party, that there are Arabs who sit on</p>
<p>the Israeli Supreme Court and all the rest.</p>
<p>And then beyond that, obviously, she&rsquo;s engaged in some of the same sort of anti-Semitic tropes</p>
<p>that you heard from Ye, right?</p>
<p>The stuff about it&rsquo;s all about the Benjamins, that American support for Israel is all about</p>
<p>the Benjamins.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s had to be chided by members of her own party about this sort of stuff before.</p>
<p>Can you empathize with the plight of Palestinian people?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, I, you know, some of the uglier things that I&rsquo;ve ever said in my career are things</p>
<p>that I said very early on when I was 17, 18, 19.</p>
<p>I started writing a syndicated comment.</p>
<p>I was 17.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now 38.</p>
<p>So virtually all the dumb things, I&rsquo;d say virtually all, many of the dumb things, the</p>
<p>plurality of the dumb things that I&rsquo;ve said came from the ages of, I&rsquo;d say, 17 to maybe</p>
<p>23.</p>
<p>And they are rooted, again, in sloppy thinking.</p>
<p>I feel terrible for people who have lived under the thumb and currently live under the</p>
<p>thumb of Hamas, which is an actual terrorist group, or the Palestinian Authority, which</p>
<p>is a corrupt oligarchy that steals money from its people and leaves them in misery, or Islamic</p>
<p>Jihad, which is an actual terrorist group.</p>
<p>And the basic rule for the region, in my view, is if these groups were willing to make peace</p>
<p>with Israel, they would have a state literally tomorrow.</p>
<p>And if they are not, then there will be no peace.</p>
<p>And it really is that simple.</p>
<p>If Israel, the formula that&rsquo;s typically used has become a bit of a bumper sticker, but</p>
<p>it happens to be factually correct, if the Palestinians put down their guns tomorrow,</p>
<p>there would be a state.</p>
<p>If the Israelis put down their guns, there would be no Israel.</p>
<p>You get attacked a lot on the internet.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I got to ask you about your own psychology.</p>
<p>How do you not let that break you mentally?</p>
<p>And how do you avoid letting that lead to a resentment of the groups that attack you?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, so there are a few sort of practical things that I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>So for example, I would say that four years ago, Twitter was all consuming.</p>
<p>Twitter is an ego machine, especially the notifications button, right?</p>
<p>The notifications button is just people talking about you all the time.</p>
<p>And the normal human tendency is, wow, people talking about me, I got to see what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying about me, which is a recipe for insanity.</p>
<p>So my wife actually said, Twitter is making your life miserable, you need to take it off</p>
<p>your phone.</p>
<p>So Twitter is not on my phone.</p>
<p>If I want to log onto Twitter, I have to go onto my computer and I have to make the conscious</p>
<p>decision to go onto Twitter and then take a look at what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I could just imagine you like there&rsquo;s a computer in the basement, you descend into the check</p>
<p>Twitter in the darkness.</p>
<p>If you look at when I actually tweet, it&rsquo;s generally like in the run up to recording</p>
<p>my show or when I&rsquo;m prepping for my show later in the afternoon, for example.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t affect you negatively mentally, like put you in a bad mental space?</p>
<p>Not particularly if it&rsquo;s restricted to sort of what&rsquo;s being watched.</p>
<p>Now, I will say that I think the most important thing is you have to surround yourself with</p>
<p>a group of people who are who you trust enough to make serious critiques of you when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing something wrong.</p>
<p>But also, you know that they have your best interests at heart, because the Internet is</p>
<p>filled with people who don&rsquo;t have your best interests at heart and who hate your guts.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t really take those critiques seriously or does wreck you.</p>
<p>And the world is also filled with sycophants, right?</p>
<p>Then the more successful you become, there are a lot of people who will tell you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>always doing the right thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very lucky.</p>
<p>I got married when I was 24.</p>
<p>My wife was 20.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s known me long before I was famous or wealthy or anything.</p>
<p>And so she&rsquo;s a good sounding board.</p>
<p>I have a family that&rsquo;s willing to that&rsquo;s willing to call me out on my bullshit as you</p>
<p>talk to Ye about.</p>
<p>I have friends who are able to do that.</p>
<p>I try to have open lines of communications with people who I believe have my best interests</p>
<p>at heart.</p>
<p>But one of the sort of conditions of being friends is that when you see me do something</p>
<p>wrong, I&rsquo;d like for you to let me know that so I can correct it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to leave bad impressions out there.</p>
<p>The sad thing about the Internet, just looking at the critiques you get, I see very few critiques</p>
<p>from people that actually want you to succeed, want you to grow.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re very, they&rsquo;re not sophisticated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, they&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know, they&rsquo;re cruel.</p>
<p>The critiques are just, it&rsquo;s not actual critiques.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just cruelty.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s most of Twitter.</p>
<p>I mean, Twitter is a place to smack and be smacked.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s anybody who uses Twitter for an intellectual conversation, I think is engaging</p>
<p>in category error.</p>
<p>I use it to spread love.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the only one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you and no one else, my friend.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, on that topic, what do you think about Elon buying Twitter?</p>
<p>What do you like?</p>
<p>What are you hopeful on that front?</p>
<p>What would you like to see Twitter improve?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very hopeful about Elon buying Twitter.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that Elon is significantly more transparent than what has taken place</p>
<p>up till now.</p>
<p>He seems committed to the idea that he&rsquo;s going to broaden the Overton window to allow for</p>
<p>conversations that simply were banned before.</p>
<p>Everything ranging from efficacy of masks with regard to COVID to whether men can become</p>
<p>women and all the rest.</p>
<p>A lot of things that would get you banned on Twitter before without any sort of real</p>
<p>explanation.</p>
<p>It seems like he&rsquo;s dedicated to at least explaining what the standards are going to be and being</p>
<p>broader and allowing a variety of perspectives on the outlet, which I think is wonderful.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also why people are freaking out.</p>
<p>I think the kind of wailing and gnashing of teeth and wearing of sackcloth and ash by</p>
<p>so many members of the legacy media, I think a lot of that is because Twitter essentially</p>
<p>was an oligarchy in which certain perspectives were allowed and certain perspectives just</p>
<p>were not.</p>
<p>And that was part of a broader social media reimposed oligarchy in the aftermath of 2017.</p>
<p>So in order for just to really understand, I think, what it means for Elon to take over</p>
<p>Twitter, I think that we have to take a look at sort of the history of media in the United</p>
<p>States in two minutes or less.</p>
<p>The United States, the media for most of its existence up until about 1990, at least</p>
<p>from about 1930s until the 1990s, virtually all media was three major television networks,</p>
<p>a couple major newspapers and the wire services.</p>
<p>Everybody had a local newspaper, the wire services that basically did all the foreign</p>
<p>policy and all the national policy.</p>
<p>McClatchy, Reuters, AP, AFP, etc.</p>
<p>So that monopoly or oligopoly existed until the rise of the Internet.</p>
<p>There were sort of pokes at it and talk radio and Fox News, but there certainly was not</p>
<p>this plethora of sources.</p>
<p>Then the Internet explodes and all of a sudden you can get news everywhere.</p>
<p>And the way that people are accessing that news is you&rsquo;re, I believe, significantly</p>
<p>younger than I am.</p>
<p>But we used to do this thing called bookmarking, where you would bookmark a series of websites</p>
<p>and then you would visit them every morning.</p>
<p>And then social media came up.</p>
<p>Is this an AOL or?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You had the dial up and you&rsquo;d actually, it was actually a can connected to a string and</p>
<p>you would actually just, it would go.</p>
<p>And and and then there came a point where social media arose and social media was sort</p>
<p>of a boon for everybody because you no longer had to bookmark anything.</p>
<p>You just followed your favorite accounts and all of them would pop up and you follow everything</p>
<p>on Facebook and it would all pop up and it was all centralized.</p>
<p>And for a while, everybody was super happy because this was the brand new wave of the</p>
<p>future, made everything super easy.</p>
<p>Suddenly outlets like mine were able to see new eyeballs because it was all centralized</p>
<p>in one place, right?</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have to do it through Google optimization.</p>
<p>You could now just put it on Facebook and so many eyeballs were on Facebook, you&rsquo;d get</p>
<p>more traffic.</p>
<p>And everybody seemed pretty happy with this arrangement until precisely the moment Donald</p>
<p>Trump became president.</p>
<p>At that point, then the sort of pre existing supposition of a lot of the powers that be,</p>
<p>which was Democrats are going to continue winning from here on out so we can sort of</p>
<p>use these social media platforms as ways to to push our information and still allow for</p>
<p>there to be other information out there.</p>
<p>The immediate response was we need to reestablish this this siphoning of information.</p>
<p>It was misinformation and disinformation that won Donald Trump the election.</p>
<p>We need to pressure the social media companies to start cracking down on misinformation and</p>
<p>disinformation and actually see this in the historical record.</p>
<p>I mean, you can see how Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s talk about free speech shifted from about 2015</p>
<p>to about 2018.</p>
<p>You can see Mark Zuckerberg gave a speech at Georgetown in 2018 in which he talked about</p>
<p>free speech and its value.</p>
<p>And by 2019, he was going in front of Congress talking about how he was responsible for the</p>
<p>stuff that was on Facebook, which is not true.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not responsible for the stuff on Facebook, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a platform.</p>
<p>Is AT&amp;T responsible for the stuff you say on your phone?</p>
<p>The answer is typically no.</p>
<p>So when that happened, all of these because all the eyeballs had now been centralized</p>
<p>in these social media sites, they were able to suddenly control what you could see and</p>
<p>what you could not see.</p>
<p>And the most obvious example was obviously leading up to 2020, the election that the</p>
<p>killing of the Hunter Biden story is a great example of this.</p>
<p>And so Elon coming in and taking over one of the social media service and saying, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not playing by your rules, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not going to be this sort of group of people in the halls of power who are going</p>
<p>to decide what we can see and hear.</p>
<p>Instead, I&rsquo;m going to let a thousand flowers bloom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be limits, but it&rsquo;s going to be on more case by case basis.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to allow perspectives that are mainstream, but maybe not mainstream in the</p>
<p>halls of academia or in the halls of media.</p>
<p>Let those let those be said.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really good thing.</p>
<p>Now that comes with some responsibilities on Elon&rsquo;s personal part, which would be to</p>
<p>be, for example, I think more responsible in dissemination of information himself sometimes,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like he got himself in trouble the other day for tweeting out that story about Paul</p>
<p>Pelosi that was speculative and untrue.</p>
<p>And I think I don&rsquo;t think what he did is horrific.</p>
<p>He deleted it when he found out that it was false.</p>
<p>But and that&rsquo;s actually a free speech working, right?</p>
<p>He said something wrong.</p>
<p>People ripped into him.</p>
<p>He realized he was wrong.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s deleted it, which seems to be a better solution than preemptively banning content,</p>
<p>which only raises more questions than it actually stops.</p>
<p>With that said, as the face of responsible free speech, you know, and that&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s pitching at Twitter.</p>
<p>He, I think, should enact that himself and be a little more careful in the stuff that</p>
<p>he tweets out.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a tricky balance.</p>
<p>The reason a lot of people are freaking out is because one, he&rsquo;s putting his thumb on</p>
<p>the scale by saying he is more likely to vote Republican.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s showing himself to be center right and sort of just having a political opinion versus</p>
<p>being this amorphous thing that doesn&rsquo;t have a political opinion.</p>
<p>I think if I were to guess, I haven&rsquo;t talked to him about it, but if I were to guess, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sending a kind of signal that&rsquo;s important for the Twitter, the company itself, because</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re being honest, most of the employees are left leaning.</p>
<p>So you have to kind of send a signal that like a resisting mechanism to say, like, since</p>
<p>most of the employees are left, it&rsquo;s good for Elon to be more right to balance out the</p>
<p>way the actual engineering is done to say we&rsquo;re not going to do any kind of activism</p>
<p>inside the engineering.</p>
<p>If I were to guess, that&rsquo;s kind of the effective aspect of that mechanism.</p>
<p>And the other one, by posting the Pelosi thing, is probably to expand the Overton window,</p>
<p>saying we can play, we can post stuff, we can post conspiracy theories, and then through</p>
<p>discourse figure out what is and isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Yeah, again, like I say, I mean, I think that is a better mechanism in action than what</p>
<p>it was before.</p>
<p>I just think it gave people who hate his guts the opening to kind of slap him for no reason.</p>
<p>But I can see the strategy of it for sure.</p>
<p>And I think that the general idea that he&rsquo;s kind of pushing right where the company had</p>
<p>pushed left before, I think that there there is actually unilateral polarization right</p>
<p>now in politics, at least with regard to social media, in which one side basically says the</p>
<p>solution to disinformation is to shut down free speech from the other side.</p>
<p>And the other side is basically like people like me are saying, the solution to disinformation</p>
<p>is to let 1000 like I&rsquo;d rather have people on the left also being able to put out stuff</p>
<p>that I disagree with, then for there to be anybody who&rsquo;s sort of in charge of these social</p>
<p>media platforms and using them as editorial sites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not criticizing MSNBC for not putting on right wing opinions.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I run a conservative site.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;re not going to put up left wing opinions on a wide variety of issues</p>
<p>because we are a conservative site.</p>
<p>But if you pitch yourself as a platform, that&rsquo;s a different thing.</p>
<p>If you pitch yourself as the town square, as Elon likes to call it, then I think Elon</p>
<p>has a better idea of that than many of the former employees did, especially now that</p>
<p>we have that report from the intercept suggesting that there are people from Twitter working</p>
<p>with DHS to monitor quote unquote disinformation and being rather vague about what disinformation</p>
<p>meant.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think activism has a place in what is fundamentally an engineering company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s building a platform.</p>
<p>Like the people inside the company should not be putting a thumb on the scale of what</p>
<p>is and isn&rsquo;t allowed.</p>
<p>You should create a mechanism for the people to decide what is and isn&rsquo;t allowed.</p>
<p>Do you think Trump should have been removed from Twitter?</p>
<p>Should his account be restored?</p>
<p>His account should be restored, and this is coming from somebody who really dislikes an</p>
<p>enormous number of Donald Trump&rsquo;s tweets.</p>
<p>Again, he&rsquo;s a very important political personage.</p>
<p>Even if he weren&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think that he should be banned from from Twitter or Facebook</p>
<p>in coordinated fashion.</p>
<p>By the way, I hold that opinion about people who I think are far worse than Donald Trump,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>People I everyone knows I&rsquo;m not an Alex Jones guy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like Alex Jones.</p>
<p>I think Alex Jones.</p>
<p>Oh, I think Alex should be back on Twitter.</p>
<p>I do, actually, because I think that there are plenty of people who are willing to say</p>
<p>that what he&rsquo;s saying is wrong.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a big fan of this idea that that because people I disagree with and people</p>
<p>who have personally targeted me, by the way, I mean, Alex Jones, this has been has said</p>
<p>some some things about me personally that I&rsquo;m not real fond of you guys.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re not besties.</p>
<p>Now, it turns out, yeah, you know, all I&rsquo;ve said is I don&rsquo;t really enjoy a show.</p>
<p>He said some other stuff about the Antichrist and such, but that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a bit of a different</p>
<p>thing, I suppose.</p>
<p>You know, even so, you know, I&rsquo;m just not a big fan of this idea.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve defended people who have really gone after me on a personal level, have targeted</p>
<p>me that the town square is online.</p>
<p>Banning people from the town square is unpersoning them.</p>
<p>Unless you violated a criminal statute, you should not be unpersoned in American society</p>
<p>as a general rule.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that companies that are not platforms don&rsquo;t have the ability to respond</p>
<p>to you.</p>
<p>I think Adidas is right to terminate its contract with Kanye, for example, with Ye.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s but Twitter ain&rsquo;t Adidas.</p>
<p>So the way your stance on free speech to the degree it&rsquo;s possible to achieve on a platform</p>
<p>like Twitter is you fight bad speech with more speech, with better speech.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so if Alex Jones and Trump was allowed back on in the coming months and years</p>
<p>leading up to the 2024 election, you think that&rsquo;s going to make for a better world in</p>
<p>the long term?</p>
<p>I think that on the principle that people should be allowed to do this and the alternative</p>
<p>being a group of thought bosses telling us what we can and cannot see.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I think in the short term, it&rsquo;s going to mean a lot of things that I don&rsquo;t like very</p>
<p>much.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the cost of doing business.</p>
<p>You know, I think that one of the cost of freedom is people doing things that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>particularly like.</p>
<p>And I would prefer the freedom with all the stuff I don&rsquo;t like than not the freedom.</p>
<p>Let me linger on the love a little bit.</p>
<p>You and a lot of people are pretty snarky on Twitter, sometimes to the point of mockery,</p>
<p>derision, even a bit of, if I were to say, bad faith in the kind of mockery.</p>
<p>And you see it as a war.</p>
<p>Like, I disagree with both you and Elon on this.</p>
<p>Elon sees Twitter as a war zone, or at least I saw it that way in the past.</p>
<p>Have you ever considered being nicer on Twitter?</p>
<p>Like, as a voice that a lot of people look up to, that if Ben Shapiro becomes a little</p>
<p>bit more about love, that&rsquo;s going to inspire a lot of people?</p>
<p>Or no?</p>
<p>Is it just too fun for you?</p>
<p>The answer is yes.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s occurred to me.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>There are a lot of tweets that actually don&rsquo;t go out that I delete.</p>
<p>I will say that Twitter&rsquo;s new function, that 30-second function is a friend of mine.</p>
<p>Every so often I&rsquo;ll tweet something and I&rsquo;ll think about it a second time.</p>
<p>Like, do I need to say this?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Can you make a book published after you pass away of all the tweets that you didn&rsquo;t send?</p>
<p>Oh no, my kids are still going to be around, I hope.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the legacy.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, sure.</p>
<p>The answer is yes.</p>
<p>And this is a good piece of what we would call in orthodox Judaism, mussar.</p>
<p>This is like, he&rsquo;s giving me a mussar schmooze right now.</p>
<p>This is like the kind of, you know, be a better person stuff.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>And yeah, I mean, I will say that Twitter is sometimes too much fun.</p>
<p>I try to be at least, if not even-handed, then equal opportunity in my derision.</p>
<p>I remember that during the 2016 primaries, I used to post rather snarky tweets about</p>
<p>virtually all of the candidates, Republican and Democrat.</p>
<p>And every so often, I&rsquo;ll still do some of that.</p>
<p>I do think actually the amount of snark on my Twitter feed has gone down fairly significantly.</p>
<p>I think if you go back a couple of years, it was probably a little more snarky.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m trying to use it a little bit more in terms of strategy to get out information.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not going to make jokes about, for example, you know, Joe Biden.</p>
<p>I will make jokes about Joe Biden.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the president of the United States.</p>
<p>Nobody else will mock him.</p>
<p>So the entire comedic establishment has decided they actually work for him.</p>
<p>So the president of the United States, no matter who they are, get the snark.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And President Trump, I think, is fairly aware that he got the snark from me as well.</p>
<p>When it comes to snarking the president, I&rsquo;m not going to stop that.</p>
<p>I think the president deserves to be snarked.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not afraid of attacking Trump?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I&rsquo;ve done it before.</p>
<p>Can you say what your favorite and least favorite</p>
<p>things are about President Trump and President Biden one at a time?</p>
<p>So maybe one thing that you can say is super positive about Trump</p>
<p>and one thing super negative about Trump.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the super positive thing about Trump is that because he has no preconceived views</p>
<p>that are establishmentarian, he&rsquo;s sometimes willing to go out of the box and do things</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t been tried before.</p>
<p>And sometimes that works.</p>
<p>I mean, the best example being the entire foreign policy establishment telling him</p>
<p>that he couldn&rsquo;t get a Middle Eastern deal done unless he centered the Palestinian-Israeli</p>
<p>conflict.</p>
<p>And instead, he just went right around that and ended up cutting a bunch of peace deals</p>
<p>in the Middle East or moving the embassy in Jerusalem, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes he does stuff and it&rsquo;s really out of the box and it actually works.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of awesome in politics and neat to see.</p>
<p>The downside of Trump is that he has no capacity to use any sort of ‚Äî there&rsquo;s no filter between</p>
<p>brain and mouth.</p>
<p>Whatever happens in his brain is the thing that comes out of his mouth.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people find that charming and wonderful and it is very funny, but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that it is a particularly excellent personal quality in a person who has as much</p>
<p>responsibility as President Trump has.</p>
<p>I think he says a lot of damaging and bad things on Twitter.</p>
<p>I think that he seems consumed in some ways by his own grievances, which is why you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen him focusing in on election 2020 so much.</p>
<p>And I think that that is very negative about President Trump.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very grateful to President Trump as a conservative for many of the things that</p>
<p>he did.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of his personality issues are pretty severe.</p>
<p>What about Joe Biden?</p>
<p>So I think that the thing that I like most about Joe Biden, I will say that Biden ‚Äî two</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>One, Biden seems to be a very good father by all available evidence, right?</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who are put out, you know, kind of tape of him talking to Hunter</p>
<p>and Hunter&rsquo;s having trouble with drugs or whatever.</p>
<p>And I keep listening to that tape and thinking, he seems like a really good dad.</p>
<p>The stuff that he&rsquo;s saying to his son is stuff that, God forbid, if that were happening with</p>
<p>my kid, I&rsquo;d be saying to my kid.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you can&rsquo;t help but feel for the guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had an incredibly difficult go of it with his first wife and the death of members</p>
<p>of his family and then Beau dying.</p>
<p>I mean, like that kind of stuff, obviously, is deeply sympathetic and he seems like a</p>
<p>deeply sympathetic father.</p>
<p>As far as his politics, he seems like a slap on the back, you know, kind of guy.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mind that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>So far as it goes, it&rsquo;s sort of an old school politics where things are done with handshake</p>
<p>and personal relationships.</p>
<p>The thing I don&rsquo;t like about him is I think sometimes that&rsquo;s really not genuine.</p>
<p>I think that sometimes, you know, I think that&rsquo;s his personal tendency, but I think</p>
<p>sometimes he allows the prevailing winds of his party to carry him to incredibly radical</p>
<p>places and then he just doubles down on the radicalism in some pretty disingenuous ways.</p>
<p>And there I would cite the Independence Day speech or the Independence Hall speech, which</p>
<p>I thought was truly one of the worst speeches I&rsquo;ve seen a president give.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s trying to be a unifier in general?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what he was elected to do.</p>
<p>He was elected to do two things, not be alive and be a unifier.</p>
<p>Those were the two things.</p>
<p>And when I say not be alive, I don&rsquo;t mean like physically dead.</p>
<p>This is where the snark comes in.</p>
<p>But what I do mean is that he was elected to not be particularly activist.</p>
<p>Basically, the mandate was don&rsquo;t be Trump.</p>
<p>Be sane.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be Trump.</p>
<p>Calm everything down.</p>
<p>And instead he got in and he&rsquo;s like, what if we spend seven trillion dollars?</p>
<p>What if we what if we pull out of Afghanistan without any sort of plan?</p>
<p>What if I start labeling all of my political enemies, enemies of the republic?</p>
<p>What if I start bringing Dylan Mulvaney to the White House and talking about how it is</p>
<p>a moral sin to prevent the general mutilation of minors?</p>
<p>I mean, like this kind of stuff is very radical stuff.</p>
<p>And this is not a president who has pursued a unifying agenda, which is why his approval</p>
<p>rating sank from 60 percent when he entered office to low 40s or high 30s today.</p>
<p>Unlike President Trump, who never had a high approval rating, right?</p>
<p>Trump came into office and he had like a 45 percent approval rating.</p>
<p>And when he left office, he had about a 43 percent approval rating and bounced around</p>
<p>between 45 and 37, pretty much his entire presidency.</p>
<p>Biden went from being a very popular guy coming in to a very unpopular guy right now.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re Joe Biden, you should be looking in the mirror and wondering exactly why.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think that pulling out from Afghanistan could be flipped as a pro for Biden in terms</p>
<p>of he actually did it?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be almost impossible.</p>
<p>I think the American people are incredibly inconsistent about their own views on foreign</p>
<p>policy.</p>
<p>In other words, we like to be isolationist until it comes time for us to be defeated</p>
<p>and humiliated.</p>
<p>When that happens, we tend not to like it very much.</p>
<p>You mentioned Biden being a good father.</p>
<p>Can you make the case for and against the Hunter Biden laptop story for it being a big</p>
<p>deal and against it being a big deal?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So the case for it being a big deal is basically twofold.</p>
<p>One is that it is clearly relevant if the president&rsquo;s son is running around to foreign</p>
<p>countries picking up bags of cash because his last name is Biden while his father is</p>
<p>vice president of the United States.</p>
<p>And it raises questions as to influence peddling for either the vice president or the former</p>
<p>vice president using political connections.</p>
<p>Did he make any money?</p>
<p>Who was the big guy?</p>
<p>All these open questions that obviously implicates the questions to be asked.</p>
<p>And then the secondary reason that the story is big is actually because the reaction of</p>
<p>the story, the banning of the story is in and of itself a major story.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s any story that implicates a presidential candidate in the last month of an election</p>
<p>and there is a media blackout, including a social media blackout, that obviously raises</p>
<p>some very serious questions about informational flow and dissemination in the United States.</p>
<p>So no matter how big of a deal the story is, it is a big deal that there&rsquo;s a censorship</p>
<p>of any relevant story.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s a coordinated collusive blackout, yeah, that&rsquo;s a serious and major problem.</p>
<p>So those are the two reasons why it would be a big story.</p>
<p>The two reasons, a reason why it would not be a big story perhaps is if it turns out,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t really know this yet, but let&rsquo;s say that Hunter Biden was basically off on</p>
<p>his own doing what he was doing, being a derelict or a drug addict or acting badly.</p>
<p>And his dad had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>And Joe was telling the truth.</p>
<p>And he really knew.</p>
<p>But the problem is we never actually got those questions answered.</p>
<p>So if it had turned out to be nothing of a story, the nice thing about stories that turn</p>
<p>out to be nothing is that after they turn out to be nothing, they&rsquo;re nothing.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with this story is that it wasn&rsquo;t allowed to take the normal life</p>
<p>cycle of a story, which is original story breaks.</p>
<p>Follow on questions are asked.</p>
<p>Follow on questions are answered.</p>
<p>Story is either now a big story or it&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>When the life cycle of a story is cut off right at the very beginning, right when it&rsquo;s born,</p>
<p>then that allows you to speculate in any direction you want.</p>
<p>You can speculate.</p>
<p>It means nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nonsense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Russian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Russian laptop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disinformation.</p>
<p>Or on the other hand, this means that Joe Biden was personally calling Hunter and telling</p>
<p>him to pick up a sack of cash over in Beijing.</p>
<p>And then he became president.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s influence peddling.</p>
<p>So, you know, this is why it&rsquo;s important to allow these stories to go forward.</p>
<p>So this is why actually the bigger story for the moment is not the laptop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reaction to the laptop because it cut off that life cycle of the story.</p>
<p>And then, you know, at some point, I would assume that there will be some follow on questions</p>
<p>that are actually answered.</p>
<p>I mean, the House is pledging if it goes Republican to investigate all of this.</p>
<p>Again, I wouldn&rsquo;t be supremely surprised if it turns out that that there was no direct</p>
<p>involvement of Joe in this sort of stuff, because it turns out, as I said before, that</p>
<p>all of politics is veep.</p>
<p>And this is always the story with half the scandals that you see is that everybody assumes</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some sort of deep and abiding, clever plan that some politician is implementing</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And then you look at it and it turns out, no, it&rsquo;s just something dumb, right?</p>
<p>This sort of perfect example of this, you know, President Trump with the classified</p>
<p>documents in Mar-a-Lago.</p>
<p>So people on the left like it&rsquo;s probably nuclear codes.</p>
<p>Probably he&rsquo;s taking secret documents and selling them to the Russians or the Chinese.</p>
<p>And the real, most obvious explanation is Trump looked at the papers and he said, I</p>
<p>like these papers.</p>
<p>And then he just decided to keep them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then people came to him and said, Mr. President, you&rsquo;re not allowed to keep those</p>
<p>papers.</p>
<p>He said, who are those people?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about what they have to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting them in the other room in a box.</p>
<p>It is highly likely that that is what happened.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very disappointing to people, I think, when they realize the human brain, I mean,</p>
<p>you know this better than I do, but the human brain is built to find patterns, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we like to do.</p>
<p>We like to find plans and patterns because this is how we survived in the wild is you</p>
<p>found a plan.</p>
<p>You found a pattern.</p>
<p>You crack the code of the universe.</p>
<p>When it comes to politics, the conspiracy theories that we see so often, it&rsquo;s largely</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re seeing inexplicable events.</p>
<p>Unless you just assume everyone&rsquo;s a moron.</p>
<p>If you assume that there&rsquo;s a lot of stupidity going on, everything becomes quickly explicable.</p>
<p>If you assume that there must be some rationale behind it, you have to come up with increasingly</p>
<p>convoluted conspiracy theories to explain just why people are acting the way that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>acting.</p>
<p>And I find that, I won&rsquo;t say 100% of the time, but 90, 94% of the time, the conspiracy theory</p>
<p>turns out just to be people being dumb and then other people reacting in dumb ways to</p>
<p>the original people being dumb.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, to me, in that same way, very possible, very likely that the Hunter Biden,</p>
<p>Hunter Biden getting money in Ukraine, I guess, for consulting and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>is a nothing burger.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s qualified.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s getting money as he should.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of influence peddling in general that&rsquo;s not corrupt.</p>
<p>I think the most obvious explanation there probably is that he was fake influence peddling,</p>
<p>meaning he went to Ukraine and he&rsquo;s like, guess what?</p>
<p>My dad&rsquo;s Joe.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, well, you don&rsquo;t have any qualifications in oil and natural gas and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really have a great resume, but your dad is Joe.</p>
<p>And then that was kind of the end of it.</p>
<p>They gave him a bag of cash, hoping he would do something.</p>
<p>He never did anything.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re making it sound worse than it is.</p>
<p>I think that in general, consulting is done in that way.</p>
<p>Your name, it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he is some rare case and this is an illustration of corruption.</p>
<p>If you can criticize consulting, which I would.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>Which they&rsquo;re basically not providing.</p>
<p>You look at a resume and who&rsquo;s who, like if you went to Harvard, I can criticize the same</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>If you have Harvard on your resume, you&rsquo;re more likely to be hired as a consultant.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a network there of people that you know and you hire them in that same way.</p>
<p>If your last name is Biden, if your last&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of last names that sound pretty good at it, right?</p>
<p>No, for sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like you&hellip;</p>
<p>And Hunter Biden admitted that much, by the way, right?</p>
<p>In an open interview, he was like, if your last name weren&rsquo;t Biden, wouldn&rsquo;t you got that job?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, probably not.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s an honest&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s getting a ridiculous amount of money.</p>
<p>He was getting like a pretty standard consulting kind of money, which also would criticize</p>
<p>because they get a ridiculous amount of money.</p>
<p>But sort of even to push back on the life cycle or to steel man the side that was concerned</p>
<p>about the Hunter Biden laptop story, I don&rsquo;t know if there is a natural life cycle of a story</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something about the virality of the internet that we can&rsquo;t predict that a story</p>
<p>can just take hold and the conspiracy around it builds, especially around politics, where</p>
<p>the interpretation, some popular, sexy interpretation of a story that might not be</p>
<p>connected to reality at all will become viral.</p>
<p>And that, from Facebook&rsquo;s perspective, is probably what they&rsquo;re worried about,</p>
<p>is a organized misinformation campaign that makes up a sexy story or sexy interpretation</p>
<p>of the vague story that we have.</p>
<p>And that has an influence on the populace.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s true, but I think the question becomes,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the great adjudicator there, right?</p>
<p>Who adjudicates when the story ought to be allowed to go through even a bad life cycle</p>
<p>or allowed to go viral, as opposed to not?</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s one thing if you want to say,</p>
<p>okay, we can spot the Russian accounts that are actually promoting this stuff.</p>
<p>They belong to the Russian government.</p>
<p>Got to shut that down.</p>
<p>I think everybody agrees.</p>
<p>This is actually one of the slides that&rsquo;s happened linguistically that I really object to,</p>
<p>is the slide between disinformation and misinformation.</p>
<p>You notice there is this evolution.</p>
<p>And in 2017, there&rsquo;s a lot of talk about disinformation.</p>
<p>It was Russian disinformation.</p>
<p>The Russians were putting out deliberately false information in order to skew election</p>
<p>results was the accusation.</p>
<p>And then people started using disinformation or misinformation.</p>
<p>And misinformation is either mistaken information or information that is,</p>
<p>quote unquote, out of context.</p>
<p>That becomes very subjective very quickly as to what out of context means.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be from a foreign source.</p>
<p>It can be from a domestic source, right?</p>
<p>It could be somebody misinterpreting something here.</p>
<p>It could be somebody interpreting something correctly,</p>
<p>but PolitiFact thinks that it&rsquo;s out of context.</p>
<p>That sort of stuff gets very murky very quickly.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m deeply uncomfortable with the idea that Facebook, I mean,</p>
<p>Zuckerberg was on with Rogan and talking about how, you know,</p>
<p>the FBI had basically set lookout for Russian interference in the election.</p>
<p>And then all of these people were out there saying that the laptop was Russian</p>
<p>disinformation.</p>
<p>So he basically shut it down.</p>
<p>You know, that sort of stuff is frightening,</p>
<p>especially because it wasn&rsquo;t Russian disinformation.</p>
<p>I mean, the laptop was real.</p>
<p>And so the fact that you have people who seem to let&rsquo;s put this way,</p>
<p>it seems as though maybe this is wrong.</p>
<p>It seems as though when a story gets killed preemptively like this,</p>
<p>it is almost universally a story that negatively affects one side of the political aisle.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the last time there was a story on the right that was disinformation</p>
<p>or misinformation where social media stepped in and they went,</p>
<p>we cannot have this.</p>
<p>This cannot be distributed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to all colludes that this information is not distributed.</p>
<p>Maybe in response to the story being proved false, it gets taken down.</p>
<p>But what made the Hunter Biden thing so amazing is that it wasn&rsquo;t really even</p>
<p>a response to anything.</p>
<p>It was like the story got posted.</p>
<p>There were no actual doubts expressed as to the verified falsity of the story.</p>
<p>It was just supposition that it had to be false and everybody jumped in.</p>
<p>So I think that confirmed a lot of the conspiracy theories people had about social media and</p>
<p>how it works.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if the reason you want to slow down the viral spread of a thing is at all grounded</p>
<p>in partisanship, that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>You should be very honest with yourself and ask yourself that question.</p>
<p>Is it because I&rsquo;m on the left or on the right that I want to slow this down?</p>
<p>Versus is it hate?</p>
<p>Bipartisan hate speech, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really tricky.</p>
<p>Like you, I&rsquo;m very uncomfortable in general with any kind of slowing down, with any kind</p>
<p>of censorship.</p>
<p>But if there is something like a conspiracy theory that spreads hate, that becomes viral,</p>
<p>I still lean to let that conspiracy theory spread because the alternative is dangerous,</p>
<p>more dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like the ring of power, right?</p>
<p>Everybody wants the ring because with the ring you can stop the bad guys from going</p>
<p>forward, but it turns out that the ring gives you enormous power and that power can be used</p>
<p>in the wrong ways too.</p>
<p>You head the Daily Wire, which I&rsquo;m a member of.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I recommend everybody sign up to it.</p>
<p>It should be part of your regular diet, whether you&rsquo;re on the left and the right, the far</p>
<p>left or the far right.</p>
<p>Everybody should be part of your regular diet.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That said, do you worry about the audience capture aspect of it?</p>
<p>Because it is a platform for conservatives.</p>
<p>And you have a powerful voice on there.</p>
<p>It might be difficult for you to go against the talking points or against the stream of</p>
<p>ideas that is usually connected to conservative thought.</p>
<p>Do you worry about that?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the audience would obviously be upset with me and would have a right to</p>
<p>be upset with me if I suddenly flipped all of my positions on a dime.</p>
<p>I have enough faith in my audience that I can say things that I think are true and that</p>
<p>may disagree with the audience on a fairly regular basis, I would say.</p>
<p>But they understand that on the deeper principle, we&rsquo;re on the same side, at least I hope that</p>
<p>much, from the audience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why we provide a number of different views on the platforms, many of which I disagree</p>
<p>with, but are sort of within the generalized range of conservative thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something I do have to think about every day, though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to think about, am I saying this because I&rsquo;m afraid of taking off my audience</p>
<p>or am I saying this because I actually believe this?</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s a delicate dance a little bit.</p>
<p>You have to be sort of honest with yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Somebody like Sam Harris is pretty good at this, at fighting, at saying the most outrageous</p>
<p>thing that he knows.</p>
<p>He almost leans into it.</p>
<p>He knows he&rsquo;ll piss off a lot of his audience.</p>
<p>Sometimes you almost have to test the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you feel you almost exaggerate your feelings just to make sure to send a</p>
<p>signal to the audience that you&rsquo;re not captured by them.</p>
<p>So speaking of people you disagree with, what is your favorite thing about Candace Owens</p>
<p>and what is one thing you disagree with her on?</p>
<p>Well, my favorite thing about Candace is that she will say things that nobody else will say.</p>
<p>My least favorite thing about Candace is that she will say things that nobody else will say.</p>
<p>I mean, listen, she says things that are audacious and I think need to be said sometimes.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think that she is morally wrong, right?</p>
<p>I think the way she responded to Kanye, I&rsquo;ve said this clearly, was dead wrong and morally</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>What was her response?</p>
<p>Her original response was that she proffered confusion of what Ye was actually talking</p>
<p>about and then she was defending her friend.</p>
<p>I wish that the way that she had responded was by saying he&rsquo;s my friend and also he said</p>
<p>something bad and anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>I wish that she had said that.</p>
<p>Right away.</p>
<p>Right away.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think you can also, this is the interesting human thing.</p>
<p>You can be friends with people that you disagree with and you can be friends with people that</p>
<p>actually say hateful stuff and one of the ways to help alleviate hate is being friends</p>
<p>with people that say hateful things.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then calling them out on a personal level when they do say wrong or hateful things.</p>
<p>Yeah, from a place of love and respect and privately.</p>
<p>Privately is also a big thing, right?</p>
<p>The public demand for denunciation from friends to friends is difficult and I certainly have</p>
<p>compassion for Candace given the fact that she&rsquo;s so close with Ye.</p>
<p>Yeah, it breaks my heart sometimes the public fights between friends and broken friendships.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen quite a few friendships publicly break over COVID.</p>
<p>COVID made people behave their worst in many cases, which yeah, it breaks my heart a little</p>
<p>bit because the human connection is a prerequisite for effective debate and discussion and battles</p>
<p>over ideas.</p>
<p>Has there been any argument from the opposite political aisle that has made you change your</p>
<p>mind about something if you look back?</p>
<p>So, I will say that the, I&rsquo;m thinking it through because I think that my views probably on</p>
<p>foreign policy have morphed somewhat.</p>
<p>I would say that I was much more interventionist when I was younger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m significantly less interventionist now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably give myself.</p>
<p>Can you give an example?</p>
<p>Sure, I was a big backer of the Iraq war.</p>
<p>I think now in retrospect, I might not be a backer of the Iraq war if the same situation</p>
<p>arose again.</p>
<p>Now, based on the amount of evidence that had been presented, I would say that I would</p>
<p>not be a backer of the Iraq war if the same situation arose again, based on the amount</p>
<p>of evidence that had been presented or based on the sort of willingness of the American</p>
<p>public to go it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to get involved in a war, you have to know what the endpoint looks like</p>
<p>and you have to know what the American people really are willing to bear.</p>
<p>The American people are not willing to bear open-ended occupations.</p>
<p>And so, knowing that, you have to consider that going in.</p>
<p>And when it comes to social policy, I would say that I&rsquo;m fairly strong where I was.</p>
<p>I may have become slightly convinced actually by more of the conservative side of the aisle</p>
<p>on things like drug legalization.</p>
<p>I think when I was younger, I was much more pro-drug legalization than I am now, at least</p>
<p>on the local level.</p>
<p>On a federal level, I think the federal government can&rsquo;t really do much other than close the</p>
<p>borders with regard to fentanyl trafficking, for example.</p>
<p>But when it comes to how drugs were in local communities, you can see how drugs were in</p>
<p>local communities pretty easily.</p>
<p>Which is weird because I saw you smoke a joint right before this conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my biggest thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I try to keep that secret.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting about intervention.</p>
<p>Can you comment about the war in Ukraine?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deeply personal thing, but I think you&rsquo;re able to look at it from a geopolitics</p>
<p>perspective.</p>
<p>What is the role of the United States in this conflict, before the conflict, during the</p>
<p>conflict?</p>
<p>And right now in helping achieve peace?</p>
<p>I think before the conflict, the big problem is that the West took almost the worst possible</p>
<p>view, which was encourage Ukraine to keep trying to join NATO and the EU, but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let them in.</p>
<p>And so what that does is it achieves the purpose of getting Russia really, really, really ticked</p>
<p>off and feeling threatened, but also does not give any of the protections of NATO or</p>
<p>the EU to Ukraine.</p>
<p>I mean, Zelensky is on film when he was a comedy actor making that exact joke, right?</p>
<p>He has Merkel on the other line, and she&rsquo;s like, oh, welcome to NATO.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, great.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, wait, is this Ukraine on the line?</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>But so, you know, that sort of policy is sort of nonsensical.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to offer alliance to somebody, offer alliance to them.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to guarantee their security, guarantee their security.</p>
<p>And the West failed signally to do that.</p>
<p>So that was mistakes in the run up to the war.</p>
<p>Once the war began, then the responsibility of the West began and became to give Ukraine</p>
<p>as much material as is necessary to repel the invasion.</p>
<p>And the West did really well with that.</p>
<p>I think we were late on the ball in the United States.</p>
<p>It seemed like Europe led the way a little bit more than the United States did there.</p>
<p>But in terms of effectuating American interests in the region, which being an American is</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m chiefly concerned about, you know, the American interests were several fold.</p>
<p>One is preserve borders.</p>
<p>Two is degrade the Russian aggressive military because Russia&rsquo;s military has been aggressive</p>
<p>and they are geopolitical rival of the United States.</p>
<p>Three, recalibrate the European balance with China.</p>
<p>Europe was sort of balancing with Russia and China.</p>
<p>And then because of the war, they sort of rebalanced away from China and Russia, which</p>
<p>is a real geostrategic opportunity for the United States.</p>
<p>It seemed like most of those goals have already been achieved at this point for the United</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p>And so then the question becomes, what&rsquo;s the off ramp here?</p>
<p>And what is the thing you&rsquo;re trying to prevent?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the best opportunity?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best case scenario?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the worst case scenario?</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s realistic?</p>
<p>So best case scenario is Ukraine forces Russia entirely out of Ukraine, including Luhansk,</p>
<p>Donetsk and Crimea, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best case scenario.</p>
<p>Virtually no one thinks that&rsquo;s accomplishable, including the United States, right?</p>
<p>The White House has basically said as much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still cool to imagine, particularly Crimea, the Russians being forced out of Crimea.</p>
<p>The Ukrainians have been successful in pushing the Russians out of certain parts of Luhansk</p>
<p>and Donetsk.</p>
<p>But the idea they&rsquo;re going to be able to push the entire Russian army completely back to</p>
<p>the Russian borders, that would be at best a very, very long and difficult slog in the</p>
<p>middle of a collapsing Ukrainian economy, which is a point that Zelensky has made.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not enough for you guys to give us military aid.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the middle of a war.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to need economic aid as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a pretty open-ended and strong commitment.</p>
<p>Can I take a small tangent on that?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Best case scenario, if that does militarily happen, including Crimea, do you think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a world in which Vladimir Putin would be able to convince the Russian people that this</p>
<p>was a good conclusion to the war?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So the problem is that the best case scenario might also be the worst case scenario, meaning</p>
<p>that there are a couple of scenarios that are sort of the worst case scenario.</p>
<p>And this is sort of the puzzlement of the situation.</p>
<p>One is that Putin feels so boxed in, so unable to go back to his own people and say, we just</p>
<p>wasted tens of thousands of lives here for no reason, that he unleashed a tactical nuclear</p>
<p>weapon on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Nobody knows what happens after that.</p>
<p>So we put NATO planes in the air to take out Russian assets.</p>
<p>Do Russians start shooting down planes?</p>
<p>Does Russia then threaten to escalate even further by attacking an actual NATO civilian</p>
<p>center or even a Ukrainian civilian center with nuclear weapons?</p>
<p>Where it goes from there, nobody knows because nuclear weapons haven&rsquo;t been used since 1945.</p>
<p>So that is a worst case scenario.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unpredictable scenario that could devolve into really, really significant problems.</p>
<p>The other worst case scenario could be a best case scenario, could be a worst.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is Putin falls?</p>
<p>What happens after that?</p>
<p>Who takes over for Putin?</p>
<p>Is that person more moderate than Putin?</p>
<p>Is that person a liberalizer?</p>
<p>It probably won&rsquo;t be Navalny.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s going to be ousted, it&rsquo;ll probably somebody who&rsquo;s a top member of Putin&rsquo;s brass</p>
<p>right now and has capacity to control the military.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s possible the entire regime breaks down.</p>
<p>What you end up with is Syria and Russia, right, where you just have an entirely out</p>
<p>of control region with no centralizing power, which is also a disaster area.</p>
<p>And so in the nature of risk mitigation, in sort of an attempt at risk mitigation,</p>
<p>what actually should be happening right now is some off ramp has to be offered to Putin.</p>
<p>The off ramp likely is going to be him maintaining Crimea and parts of Luhansk and Donetsk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably gonna be a commitment by Ukraine not to join NATO formally, but a guarantee</p>
<p>by the West to defend Ukraine in case of an invasion of its borders again by Russia,</p>
<p>like an actual treaty obligation.</p>
<p>Not like the B.S.</p>
<p>Treaty obligation when Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in the 90s.</p>
<p>And that is likely how this is going to have to go.</p>
<p>The problem is that requires political courage, not from Zelensky.</p>
<p>It requires courage from probably Biden, because the only ‚Äî Zelensky&rsquo;s not in a political</p>
<p>position where he can go back to his own people who have made unbelievable sacrifices on behalf</p>
<p>of their nation and freedom and say to them, guys, now I&rsquo;m calling it quits.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have to give them Luhansk, Donetsk, and give Putin an off ramp.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an acceptable answer to most Ukrainians at this point in time from</p>
<p>the polling data and from the available data we have on the ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to actually take Biden biting the bullet and being the bad guy and saying to</p>
<p>Zelensky, listen, we&rsquo;ve made a commitment of material aid.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re offering you all these things, including essentially a defense pact.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re offering you all this stuff.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t come to the table, then we&rsquo;re going to have to start weaning you ‚Äî like,</p>
<p>there will have to be a stick there.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t just be a carrot.</p>
<p>And so that will allow Zelensky ‚Äî if Biden were to do that, it would allow Zelensky to</p>
<p>blame Biden for the solution everybody knows has to happen.</p>
<p>Zelensky can go back to his own people and he can say, listen, this is the way it has</p>
<p>to go.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t want it to go this way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not my ‚Äî I&rsquo;m signing other people&rsquo;s checks, right?</p>
<p>I mean, like, this is ‚Äî it&rsquo;s not my money.</p>
<p>And Biden would take the hit because he wouldn&rsquo;t then be able to blame Ukraine for whatever</p>
<p>happens next, which has been the easy road off, I think, for a lot of politicians in</p>
<p>the West, is for them to just say, well, this is up to the Ukrainians to decide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to the Ukrainians to decide.</p>
<p>Well, is it totally up to the Ukrainians to decide?</p>
<p>Because it seems like the West is signing an awful lot of checks and all of Europe is</p>
<p>going to freeze this winter.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>This is the importance of great leadership, by the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the people we elect is very important.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s power to just one-on-one conversation where Biden sits down with Zelensky</p>
<p>and Biden sits down with Putin almost in person?</p>
<p>Because I ‚Äî or maybe I&rsquo;m romanticizing the notion, but having done these podcasts</p>
<p>in person, I think there&rsquo;s something fundamentally different than through a remote call and also</p>
<p>like a distant kind of recorded political type speak versus like man-to-man.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m deeply afraid that Putin outplays people in the one-on-one scenarios because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s done it to multiple presidents already.</p>
<p>He gets in one-on-one scenarios with Bush, with Obama, with Trump, with Biden, and he</p>
<p>seems to be a very canny operator and a very sort of hard-nosed operator in those situations.</p>
<p>I think that if you were going to do something like that, like an actual political face-to-face</p>
<p>summit, what you would need is for Biden to first have a conversation with Zelensky, where</p>
<p>Zelensky knows what&rsquo;s going on, so he&rsquo;s aware.</p>
<p>And then Biden walks in and he says to Putin on camera, here&rsquo;s the offer, let&rsquo;s get it</p>
<p>together, let&rsquo;s make peace, you get to keep this stuff.</p>
<p>And then let Putin respond how Putin is going to respond.</p>
<p>But, you know, the big problem for Putin, I think, and the problem with public-facing</p>
<p>fora, maybe it&rsquo;s a private meeting.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a private meeting, maybe that&rsquo;s the best thing.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a public-facing forum, I think it&rsquo;s a problem because Putin&rsquo;s afraid of being</p>
<p>humiliated at this point.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a private meeting, then sure, except that, again, I just, I wonder whether when</p>
<p>it comes to a person as canny as Putin and to a politician that I really don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>is a particularly sophisticated player in Joe Biden.</p>
<p>And again, this is not unique to Biden.</p>
<p>I think that most of our presidents for the last 30, 40 years have not been particularly</p>
<p>sophisticated players.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a risky scenario.</p>
<p>Yeah, I still believe in the power of that because otherwise, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think stuff on paper and political speak will solve these kinds of problems.</p>
<p>Because from Zelensky&rsquo;s perspective, nothing but complete victory will do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>His, as a nation, his people sacrificed way too much and they&rsquo;re all in.</p>
<p>And if you look at, because I traveled to Ukraine, I spent time there, I&rsquo;ll be going</p>
<p>back there, hopefully also going back to Russia.</p>
<p>Just speaking to Ukrainians, they&rsquo;re all in, they&rsquo;re all in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nothing but complete victory.</p>
<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so for that, the only way to achieve peace is through like honest human to human</p>
<p>conversation, giving both people a way to off ramp, to walk away victorious.</p>
<p>And some of that requires speaking honestly as a human being, but also for America to,</p>
<p>actually not even America, honestly, just the president be able to eat their own ego</p>
<p>a bit and be the punching bag a little, just enough for both presidents to be able to walk</p>
<p>away and say, listen, we got the American president to come to us.</p>
<p>And I think that makes the president look strong, not weak.</p>
<p>I mean, I agree with you.</p>
<p>I think it would also require some people on the right, people like me, if it&rsquo;s Joe</p>
<p>Biden to say, if Biden does that, I see what he&rsquo;s doing and it&rsquo;s the right move.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that he&rsquo;s afraid of to steel man him, I think one of the things</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s afraid of is he goes and he makes that sort of deal.</p>
<p>And the right says, you just cowered in front of Russia.</p>
<p>You just gave away Ukraine, whatever it is.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to require some people on the right to say that that move is the right move</p>
<p>and then hold by it if Biden actually performs that move.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exceptionally good at debate.</p>
<p>You wrote how to debate leftists and destroy them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of known for this kind of stuff, just exceptionally skilled at conversation,</p>
<p>at debate, at getting to the facts of the matter and using logic to get to the conclusion</p>
<p>in the debate.</p>
<p>Do you ever worry that this power, talk about the ring.</p>
<p>This power you were given has corrupted you and your ability to see what&rsquo;s like, to pursue</p>
<p>the truth versus just winning debates?</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>I mean, so I think one of the things that&rsquo;s kind of funny about the branding versus the</p>
<p>reality is that most of the things that get characterized as destroying in debates with</p>
<p>facts and logic, most of those things are basically me having a conversation with somebody</p>
<p>on a college campus.</p>
<p>It actually isn&rsquo;t like a formal debate where we sit there and we critique each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>positions or it&rsquo;s not me insulting anybody.</p>
<p>A lot of the clips that have gone very viral is me making an argument and then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not being like an amazing counter argument.</p>
<p>Many of the debates that I&rsquo;ve held have been extremely cordial.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the latest example, like about a year ago, I debated Anna Kasparian from</p>
<p>Young Turks.</p>
<p>It was very cordial.</p>
<p>It was very nice, right?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s sort of the way that I like to debate.</p>
<p>My rule when it comes to debate and or discussion is that my opponent actually gets to pick</p>
<p>the mode in which we work.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s going to be a debate of ideas and we&rsquo;re just going to discuss and critique</p>
<p>and clarify, then we can do that.</p>
<p>If somebody comes loaded for bear, then I will respond in kind because one of the big</p>
<p>problems, I think, in sort of the debate slash discussion sphere is very often misdiagnosis</p>
<p>of what exactly is going on.</p>
<p>People who think that a discussion is a debate and vice versa.</p>
<p>And that can be a real problem.</p>
<p>And there are people who will, you know, treat what ought to be a discussion as, for example,</p>
<p>an exercise in performance art.</p>
<p>And so what that is, is mugging or trolling or are saying trolly things in order to just</p>
<p>get to the like, that&rsquo;s something I actually don&rsquo;t do during debate.</p>
<p>I mean, if you actually watch me talk to people, I don&rsquo;t actually do the trolling thing.</p>
<p>The trolling thing is almost solely relegated to Twitter and me making jokes on my show.</p>
<p>When it comes to actually debating people, that sounds actually a lot like what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the person may be taking just an obverse position to mine.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Usually half of the debate or discussion is me just asking for clarification of terms,</p>
<p>like, what exactly do you mean by this?</p>
<p>So I can drill down on where the actual disagreement may lie, because some of the time people think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re disagreeing and they&rsquo;re actually not disagreeing.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m talking with Anna Kasparian and she&rsquo;s talking about how corporate and government</p>
<p>have too much power together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, you sound like a tea party, like you and I are on the same page about</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>That sort of stuff does tend to happen a lot in discussion.</p>
<p>I think that when discussion gets termed debate, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>When debate gets termed discussion, it&rsquo;s even more problematic because debate is a different</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>And I find that your debate and your conversation is often good faith.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re able to steal men on the other side.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re able to actually, you&rsquo;re actually listening.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re considering the other side.</p>
<p>The times when I see that, you know, Ben Shapiro destroys leftists, it&rsquo;s usually just like</p>
<p>you said, the other side is doing the trolling because they&rsquo;ve, I mean, the people that do</p>
<p>criticize you for that interaction is the people that usually get destroyed are like</p>
<p>20 years old.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re usually not sophisticated in any kind of degree in terms of being able to use</p>
<p>logic and reason and facts and so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s totally fine by the way.</p>
<p>I mean, if people want to criticize me for speaking on college campuses where a lot of</p>
<p>political conversation happens, both right and left, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve had lots of conversations with people on the other side of the aisle too.</p>
<p>I mean, right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done podcasts with Sam Harris and we&rsquo;ve talked about atheism or I&rsquo;ve done debates</p>
<p>with Anna Kasparian or I&rsquo;ve talked to, I&rsquo;ve done a debate with Cenk Uygur or I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had conversations with lots of people on the other side of the aisle.</p>
<p>In fact, I believe I&rsquo;m the only person on the right who recommends that people listen</p>
<p>to his shows on the other side of the aisle, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I say on my show on a fairly regular basis that people should listen to Positive</p>
<p>America.</p>
<p>Now, no one on Positive America will ever say that somebody should listen to my show.</p>
<p>That is verboten.</p>
<p>That is not something that can be had.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the strangenesses of our politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve called the happy birthday problem, which is I have a lot of friends</p>
<p>who are of the left and are publicly of the left.</p>
<p>And on my birthday, they&rsquo;ll send you a text message, happy birthday, but they will never</p>
<p>tweet happy birthday lest they be acknowledging that you were born of woman and that this</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be allowed.</p>
<p>So on the Sunday special, I&rsquo;ve had a bevy of people who are on the other side of the</p>
<p>aisle, a lot of them ranging from people in Hollywood like Jason Blum to Larry Wilmore</p>
<p>to Sam to, you know, just a lot of people on the left.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in the near future probably going to do a Sunday special with Ro Khanna</p>
<p>up in California, the California congressperson.</p>
<p>Very nice guy.</p>
<p>I had him on the show.</p>
<p>That kind of stuff is fun and interesting.</p>
<p>But, you know, I think that the easy way out for a clip that people don&rsquo;t like is to either</p>
<p>immediately clip the clip.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take a two minute clip and clip it down to 15 seconds where somebody insults me and</p>
<p>then that goes viral, which is, you know, welcome to the Internet or or to say, well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only debating colleges.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only talking to 20.</p>
<p>I mean, I talked to a lot more people than that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not the stuff you&rsquo;re watching.</p>
<p>You lost your cool in an interview with BBC&rsquo;s Andrew Neil, and you&rsquo;re really honest about</p>
<p>it after, which was kind of refreshing and enjoyable.</p>
<p>As the Internet said, they&rsquo;ve never seen anyone lose an injury.</p>
<p>So to me, honestly, it was like seeing like Floyd Mayweather Jr.</p>
<p>or somebody like knocked down.</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>Can you take me to that experience?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s that day.</p>
<p>That day is I have a book release.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t get a lot of sleep the night before.</p>
<p>And this is the last interview of the day.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an interview with BBC.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about BBC.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t watch BBC.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know any of the hosts.</p>
<p>So we get on the interview and it&rsquo;s supposed to be about the book.</p>
<p>And the host, Andrew Neil, doesn&rsquo;t ask virtually a single question about the book.</p>
<p>He just starts reading me battle tweets, which I hate.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s annoying and it&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the worst form of interview when somebody just reads you battle tweets, especially when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve acknowledged battle tweets before.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going through the list with him.</p>
<p>And this interview was solidly 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a long interview and we get to and I make a couple of particularly annoyed</p>
<p>mistakes in the interview.</p>
<p>So annoyed mistake number one is the ego play.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a point in the middle of the interview where I say, like, I don&rsquo;t even know who you</p>
<p>are, which was true.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know who he was.</p>
<p>He turns out he&rsquo;s a very famous person in Britain.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t make that ego play.</p>
<p>But even if he&rsquo;s not famous, that&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dumb thing to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an ass thing to do.</p>
<p>So like the so saying that was, you know, more just kind of peak and silliness.</p>
<p>And so that was that was mistake.</p>
<p>I enjoyed watching that.</p>
<p>It was like, oh, man, it&rsquo;s human.</p>
<p>Glad somebody enjoyed it.</p>
<p>So there is there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>And then the other mistake was that I just don&rsquo;t watch enough British TV.</p>
<p>So the way that interviews are done, there are much more adversarial than American TV</p>
<p>in American TV.</p>
<p>If somebody is adversarial with you, you assume that they&rsquo;re a member of the other side.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s typically how it is.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m critiquing some of his questions at the beginning.</p>
<p>And I thought that the critique of some of his questions is actually fair.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s asking me about abortion.</p>
<p>And I thought he was asking it from a way of framing the question that wasn&rsquo;t accurate.</p>
<p>And so I assume that he was on the left because, again, I never heard of him.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I mischaracterized him and I apologize later for mischaracterizing him.</p>
<p>We finally go through the interview.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 20 minutes.</p>
<p>He just keeps going with the battle tweets.</p>
<p>And finally, I got up and I took off the microphone.</p>
<p>I walked out and immediately I knew it was a mistake.</p>
<p>Like within 30 seconds of the end of the interview, I knew it was a mistake.</p>
<p>And and that&rsquo;s why even before the interview came out, I believe I corrected the record</p>
<p>that Andrew Neil is not on the left.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mistake by me.</p>
<p>And and then, you know, took the hit for for a bad interview.</p>
<p>And so as far as, you know, what I wish I&rsquo;d done differently, I wish I&rsquo;d known who he was.</p>
<p>I wish I&rsquo;d done my research.</p>
<p>I wish that I wish that I had treated it as though there was a possibility that was</p>
<p>going to be more adversarial than it was.</p>
<p>I think I was incautious about the interview because it was pitched as it&rsquo;s just another</p>
<p>book interview.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t just another book interview.</p>
<p>It was treated much more adversarially than that.</p>
<p>So I wish that that&rsquo;s on me.</p>
<p>I got to research the people who are talking to me and watch their shows and learn about</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And then obviously, you know, the kind of gut level appeal to ego or arrogance like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bad look.</p>
<p>And and shouldn&rsquo;t have done that.</p>
<p>And losing your cool is always a bad look.</p>
<p>So the fact that that sort of became somewhat viral and stood out just shows that it happens</p>
<p>so rarely to you.</p>
<p>So just to look at like the day in the life of Ben Shapiro, you speak a lot.</p>
<p>Very eloquently about difficult topics.</p>
<p>What goes into the research, the mental part?</p>
<p>And you always look pretty like energetic and you&rsquo;re not exhausted by the burden, the</p>
<p>heaviness of the topics you&rsquo;re covering day after day after day after day.</p>
<p>So what what goes through the preparation mentally, diet wise, anything like that?</p>
<p>Like when do you when do you wake up?</p>
<p>Okay, so I wake up when my kids wake me up.</p>
<p>Usually that&rsquo;s my baby daughter who&rsquo;s two and a half.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s here on the monitor, usually about 615, 620 a.m.</p>
<p>So I get up.</p>
<p>My wife sleeps in a little bit.</p>
<p>I go get the baby and then my son gets up and then my oldest daughter gets up.</p>
<p>I have eight, six and two.</p>
<p>The boys, the middle child.</p>
<p>Is that both a source of stress and happiness?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, it&rsquo;s the height of both.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the source of the greatest happiness.</p>
<p>So the way that I characterize it is this when it comes to sort of kids in life.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re single, your boundaries of happiness and unhappiness, you can be a zero</p>
<p>in terms of happiness, you can be like a 10 in terms of happiness.</p>
<p>Then you get married and it goes up to like a 20 and a negative 20 because</p>
<p>the happiest stuff is with your wife.</p>
<p>And then the most unhappy stuff is when something happens to your spouse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the worst thing in the entire world.</p>
<p>Then you have kids and all limits are removed.</p>
<p>So the best things that have have ever happened to me are things where I&rsquo;m watching my kids</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re playing together and they&rsquo;re being wonderful and sweet and cute.</p>
<p>And I love them so much.</p>
<p>And the worst things are when my son is screaming at me for no reason because he&rsquo;s being insane.</p>
<p>And and I have to deal with that.</p>
<p>Or something bad happens to my daughter at school or something like that.</p>
<p>That stuff is really.</p>
<p>So yes, the source of my greatest happiness, the source of my greatest stress.</p>
<p>So they get me up at about 615 in the morning.</p>
<p>I feed them breakfast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of scrolling the news while I&rsquo;m making the megs and and, you know, just updating</p>
<p>myself on anything that may have happened overnight.</p>
<p>I go into the office, put on the makeup and the wardrobe or whatever.</p>
<p>And then I sit down and do the show.</p>
<p>A lot of the prep is actually done the night before because the news cycle doesn&rsquo;t change</p>
<p>all that much between kind of late at night and in the morning.</p>
<p>So I can supplement in the morning.</p>
<p>So I do the show.</p>
<p>So a lot of the preparation, like thinking through what are the big issues in the world</p>
<p>is done the night before.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, and that&rsquo;s reading, you know, pretty much all the legacy media.</p>
<p>So I rip on legacy media a lot, but that&rsquo;s because a lot of what they do is really good</p>
<p>and a lot of it is really bad.</p>
<p>I cover a lot of legacy media.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably covering, you know, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington</p>
<p>Post, Boston Globe, Daily Mail.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll look over at some of the alternative media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at my own website, Daily Wire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at Breitbart.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at The Blaze.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at maybe The Intercept.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at, you know, a bunch of different sources.</p>
<p>And then I will look at different clips online.</p>
<p>So media comes in handy here.</p>
<p>Grabean comes in handy here.</p>
<p>That sort of stuff because my show relies very heavily on being able to play people</p>
<p>so you can hear them in their own words.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s sort of the media diet.</p>
<p>So I sit down, I do the show, and then once I&rsquo;m done with the show, I usually have between</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like 11, 15 in the morning maybe because sometimes I&rsquo;ll pre-record the show.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s 11, 15 in the morning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go home.</p>
<p>And if my wife&rsquo;s available, I&rsquo;ll grab lunch with her.</p>
<p>If not, then I will go and work out.</p>
<p>I try to work out like five times a week with a trainer, something like that.</p>
<p>And then I will-</p>
<p>Just regular gym stuff?</p>
<p>Just start at the gym?</p>
<p>Yeah, weights and plyometrics and some CrossFit kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, beneath this mild exterior lies a hulking monster.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>Then I will do reading and writing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m usually working on a book at any given time or-</p>
<p>You shut off the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I put some music in my ears, usually Brahms or Bach, sometimes Beethoven or Mozart.</p>
<p>Those four.</p>
<p>Those are on rotation.</p>
<p>No rap?</p>
<p>No rap.</p>
<p>No rap.</p>
<p>Despite my extraordinary rendition of WAP, I am not, in fact, a rap fan.</p>
<p>Do you still hate WAP, the song?</p>
<p>I will say I do not think that it is the peak of Western civilized art.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that 100 years from now, people will be gluing their faces to a WAP</p>
<p>and protest at the environment.</p>
<p>But Brahms and the rest will be still around?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I would assume if people still have a functioning prefrontal cortex and any sort of taste.</p>
<p>Strong words from Ben Shapiro.</p>
<p>All right, so you got some classical music in your ears and you&rsquo;re focusing.</p>
<p>Are you at the computer when you&rsquo;re writing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m at the computer.</p>
<p>Usually we have a kind of a room that has some sun coming in.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nice in there.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;ll go up to a library that we just completed for me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll go up there and I&rsquo;ll write and read.</p>
<p>Like with physical books?</p>
<p>Yeah, I love physical books.</p>
<p>Because I keep Sabbath, I don&rsquo;t use Kindle.</p>
<p>Because when I&rsquo;m reading a book and I hit Sabbath, I have to turn off the Kindle.</p>
<p>So that means that I have tons and tons and tons of physical books.</p>
<p>When you move from Los Angeles to Florida, I had about 7,000 volumes.</p>
<p>I had to discard probably 4,000 of them.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve built that back up now.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m probably gonna have to go through another round where I put them somewhere else.</p>
<p>I tend to tab books rather than highlighting them because I can&rsquo;t highlight on Sabbath.</p>
<p>So I have like the little stickers and I put them in the book.</p>
<p>So a typical book from me, you can see it on the book club,</p>
<p>will be like filled with tabs on the side.</p>
<p>Things that I want to take.</p>
<p>Now, actually, I got a person who I pay to go through and write down in files,</p>
<p>the quotes that I like from the book.</p>
<p>So I have those handy.</p>
<p>Which is a good way for me to remember what it is that I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>Because I read probably somewhere between three and five books a week.</p>
<p>And then the, in a good week, five.</p>
<p>And then I write, I read, and then I go pick up my kids from school at 3.30.</p>
<p>So according to my kids, I have no job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there in the mornings until they leave for school.</p>
<p>I pick them up from school.</p>
<p>I hang out with them until they go to bed, which is usually 7.30 or so.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m helping them with their homework and I&rsquo;m playing with them and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking them on rides in the brand new Tesla, which my son is obsessed with.</p>
<p>And then I put them to bed and then I sit back down.</p>
<p>I prep for the next day, go through all those media sources I was talking about,</p>
<p>compile kind of a schedule for what I want the show to look like and run a show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very detail oriented.</p>
<p>Nobody writes anything for me.</p>
<p>I write all my own stuff.</p>
<p>So every word that comes out of my mouth is my fault.</p>
<p>And then, you know, hopefully I have a couple hours to,</p>
<p>or an hour to hang out with my wife before we go to bed.</p>
<p>The words you write, do you edit a lot or does it just come out?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking like, what are the key ideas I want to express?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t tend to edit a lot.</p>
<p>So I thank God I&rsquo;m able to write extraordinarily quickly.</p>
<p>So I write very, very fast.</p>
<p>In fact, in a previous life, I was&hellip;</p>
<p>You also speak fast, so it&rsquo;s similar.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And I speak in paragraphs.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>In a previous life, I was a ghostwriter.</p>
<p>So I used to be sort of known as a turnaround specialist in the publishing industry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be somebody who came to the publisher and says,</p>
<p>I have three weeks to get this book done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a word done.</p>
<p>And they would call me up and be like, this person needs a book written.</p>
<p>And so in three weeks, I&rsquo;d knock out 60,000 words or so.</p>
<p>Is there something you can say to the process that you follow to think?</p>
<p>Like how you think about ideas?</p>
<p>Like stuff is going on in the world and trying to understand what is happening.</p>
<p>What are the explanations?</p>
<p>What are the forces behind this?</p>
<p>Do you have a process or just you wait for the muse to give you the interpretation?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a formal process, but because I read.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two ways to do it.</p>
<p>One is sometimes, you know, sometimes the daily grind of the news</p>
<p>is going to refer back to core principles that are broader and deeper.</p>
<p>So I thank God because I&rsquo;ve read so much on so many different things</p>
<p>of a lot of different point of views.</p>
<p>Then if something breaks and a piece of news breaks, I can immediately</p>
<p>sort of channel that into in the mental Rolodex.</p>
<p>These three big ideas that I think are really important.</p>
<p>And then I can talk at length about what those ideas are, and I can explicate those.</p>
<p>And so, you know, for example, when we were talking about.</p>
<p>Must taking over Twitter before, and I immediately go to the history of media,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s me tying it into a broader theme on, you know, and I do that.</p>
<p>I would say fairly frequently we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Say subsidization of industry, and I can immediately tie that into,</p>
<p>OK, what&rsquo;s the history of subsidization in the United States</p>
<p>going all the way back to Woodrow Wilson and forward through FDR&rsquo;s industrial policy?</p>
<p>And how does that tie into sort of broader economic policy internationally?</p>
<p>So it allows me to tie into bigger themes because what I tend to read is mostly not</p>
<p>news.</p>
<p>What I tend to read is mostly books.</p>
<p>I would say most of my media diet is actually not the stuff like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the icing on the cake.</p>
<p>But the actual cake is the hundreds of pages in history, econ.</p>
<p>Geography that I&rsquo;m that I&rsquo;m social science that I&rsquo;m reading every week,</p>
<p>and so that sort of stuff allows me to think more deeply about these things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way of doing it.</p>
<p>The other way of doing it is Russia breaks in the news.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about Russia.</p>
<p>I immediately go and I purchase five books about Russia, and I read all of them.</p>
<p>And so one of the unfortunate things about our</p>
<p>the fortunate thing for me and the unfortunate thing about the world is that if the unfortunate</p>
<p>thing about the world is you read two books on a subject, you are now considered by the</p>
<p>media and expert on the subject.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you know, sad and shallow, but that is the way that it is.</p>
<p>The good news for me is that my job isn&rsquo;t to be a full expert on any of these subjects,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t claim to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a Russia expert.</p>
<p>I know enough on Russia to be able to understand when people talk about Russia, what the system</p>
<p>looks like, how it works and all of that, and then to explicate that for the common</p>
<p>man, which a lot of people who are infused with the expertise can&rsquo;t really do.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re so deep in the weeds that you&rsquo;re like a full on academic expert on a thing,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to translate that over to a mass audience, which is really my job.</p>
<p>Well, I think it can actually it&rsquo;s funny with the two books, you can actually</p>
<p>get a pretty deep understanding if you read and also think deeply about it.</p>
<p>It allows you to approach a thing from first principles.</p>
<p>A lot of times if you&rsquo;re a quote unquote expert, you get carried away by the momentum</p>
<p>of what the field has been thinking about versus like stepping back.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What is really going on?</p>
<p>The challenge is to pick the right two books.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that usually what I&rsquo;ll try to find is somebody who knows the topic pretty well and have them</p>
<p>recommend or a couple people and have them recommend books.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I knew nothing about Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I was at a conference and a couple of people who you&rsquo;ve had on your show actually were</p>
<p>there and I asked them, give me your top three books on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Then I went and I read like nine books on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So if you read nine books on Bitcoin, you at least know enough to get by.</p>
<p>So I can actually explain what Bitcoin is and why it works or why it doesn&rsquo;t work in</p>
<p>some cases and what&rsquo;s happening in the markets that way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very, very helpful.</p>
<p>Well, Putin is an example.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a difficult one to find the right books on.</p>
<p>I think The New Tsar is the one I read where it was the most objective.</p>
<p>When I read, I think about Putin was, it was one called Strongman.</p>
<p>It was very highly critical of Putin, but it gave like a good background on him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very skeptical sort of things that are very, they&rsquo;re critical of Putin because</p>
<p>it feels like there&rsquo;s activism injected into the history.</p>
<p>Like the way The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is written about Hitler.</p>
<p>I like because there&rsquo;s almost not a criticism of Hitler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a description of Hitler, which is very, it&rsquo;s easier to do about a historical figure,</p>
<p>which was William Shire with The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impressive because he lived through it, but it&rsquo;s very tough to find objective</p>
<p>descriptions about the history of the man and a country of Putin, of Zelensky, of any</p>
<p>difficult, Trump is the same.</p>
<p>And I feel like-</p>
<p>Everybody that&rsquo;s the hero villain archetype, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like either somebody is completely a hero or a completely a villain.</p>
<p>And the truth is pretty much no one is completely a hero or completely a villain.</p>
<p>People, in fact, I&rsquo;m not sure that I love descriptions of people as heroes or villains</p>
<p>generally.</p>
<p>I think that people tend to do heroic things or do villainous things in the same way that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I love descriptions of people as a genius.</p>
<p>My dad used to say this when I was growing up.</p>
<p>He used to say they didn&rsquo;t believe that there were geniuses.</p>
<p>He said he believed that there were people with a genius for something because people,</p>
<p>yes, there are people who are very high IQ and we call them geniuses, but does that mean</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re good at EQ stuff?</p>
<p>Not necessarily, but there are people who are geniuses at EQ stuff.</p>
<p>In other words, it would be more specific to say that somebody is a genius at engineering</p>
<p>than to say just broad spectrum, they&rsquo;re a genius.</p>
<p>And that does avoid the problem of thinking that they&rsquo;re good at something that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not good at, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little more specific.</p>
<p>So because you read a lot of books, are there, can you look back, and it&rsquo;s always a tough</p>
<p>question because so many, it&rsquo;s like your favorite song, but are there books that have been</p>
<p>influential in your life that are impacting your thinking or maybe ones you go back to</p>
<p>that still carry insight for you?</p>
<p>The Federalist Paper is a big one in terms of sort of how American politics works.</p>
<p>The first econ book that I thought was really great because it was written for teenagers</p>
<p>essentially is one called Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 150 pages.</p>
<p>I recommend it to everybody sort of 15 and up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier than say Thomas Sowell&rsquo;s basic econ, which is four or 500 pages.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s looking at like macroeconomics, microeconomics, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, macro, macro.</p>
<p>And then in terms of, there&rsquo;s a great book by Karl Truman called Rise and Triumph of</p>
<p>the Modern Self, which I think is the best book in the last 10 years that&rsquo;s been sort</p>
<p>of impactful on some of the thoughts I&rsquo;ve been having lately.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the key idea in there that&rsquo;s impactful?</p>
<p>The key idea is that we&rsquo;ve shifted the nature of how identity is done in the West from how</p>
<p>it was historically done.</p>
<p>That basically for nearly all of human history, the way that we identify as human beings is</p>
<p>as a mix of our biological drives and then how that interacts with the social institutions</p>
<p>around us.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re a child, you&rsquo;re a bunch of unfettered biological drives and it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>parents&rsquo; job to civilize you.</p>
<p>And civilize you literally means bring you into civilization, right?</p>
<p>You learn the rules of the road.</p>
<p>You learn how to integrate into institutions that already exist and are designed to shape</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s how you interact with those institutions that makes you you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a set of biological drives.</p>
<p>And then in the modern world, we&rsquo;ve really driven toward the idea that what we are is</p>
<p>how we feel on the inside without reference to the outside world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the job of the outside world to celebrate and reflect what we think about ourselves</p>
<p>on the inside.</p>
<p>And so what that means is that we are driven now toward fighting institutions because institutions</p>
<p>are in positions.</p>
<p>So everything around us, societal institutions, these are things that are crimping our style.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making us not feel the way that we want to feel.</p>
<p>And if we just destroy those things, then we&rsquo;ll be freer and more liberated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a I think much deeper model of how to think about why our social politics particular</p>
<p>moving in a particular direction is that a ground shift has happened in how people think</p>
<p>about themselves.</p>
<p>And this has had some somewhat kind of shocking effects in terms of social politics.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s negative consequences in your view of that.</p>
<p>But is there also a positive consequence of more power, more agency to the individual?</p>
<p>I think that you can make the argument that institutions were weighing too heavily in</p>
<p>how people form their identity.</p>
<p>But I think that what we&rsquo;ve done is gone significantly too far on the other side.</p>
<p>We basically decided to blow up the institutions in favor of unfettered feeling slash identity.</p>
<p>And I think that that is not only a large mistake.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to have dire ramifications for everything from suicidal ideation to</p>
<p>institutional longevity in politics and in society more broadly.</p>
<p>So speaking about the nature of self, you&rsquo;ve been an outspoken proponent of pro-life.</p>
<p>Can we start by you trying to steal man the case for pro-choice that abortion is not murder</p>
<p>and a woman&rsquo;s right to choose is a fundamental human right, freedom?</p>
<p>So I think that the only way to steal man the pro-choice case is to, and be ideologically</p>
<p>consistent, is to suggest that there is no interest in the life of the unborn that counter</p>
<p>weighs at all freedom of choice.</p>
<p>So what that means is we can take the full example or we can take sort of the partial</p>
<p>example.</p>
<p>So if we take the full example, what that would mean is that up until point of birth,</p>
<p>which is sort of the Democratic Party platform position, that a woman&rsquo;s right to choose ought</p>
<p>to extend for any reason whatsoever up to point of birth.</p>
<p>The only way to argue that is that bodily autonomy is the only factor.</p>
<p>There is no countervailing factor that would ever outweigh bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>That would be the strongest version of the argument.</p>
<p>Another version of that argument would be that the reason that bodily autonomy ought</p>
<p>to weigh so heavily is because women can&rsquo;t be the equals of men if the vicissitudes of</p>
<p>biology are allowed to decide their futures, right?</p>
<p>If pregnancy changes women in a way that it doesn&rsquo;t change men, it&rsquo;s a form of sex discrimination</p>
<p>for women to ever have to go through with pregnancy, which is an argument that was made</p>
<p>by Ruth Bader Ginsburg kind of.</p>
<p>Those are the arguments.</p>
<p>The kind of softer version is the more, I would say, emotionally resonant version of</p>
<p>the argument, which is that bodily autonomy ought to outweigh the interests of the fetus</p>
<p>up till point X.</p>
<p>And then people have different feelings about what point X looks like.</p>
<p>Is it up to the point of viability?</p>
<p>Is it up to the point of the heartbeat?</p>
<p>Is it up to 12 weeks or 15 weeks?</p>
<p>And that really is where the American public is, where the American public is, broadly</p>
<p>speaking, not state by state, where there are various really, really varied opinions.</p>
<p>But like broadly speaking, it seems like the American public by polling data wants somewhere</p>
<p>between a 12 and 15 week abortion restriction.</p>
<p>And they believe that up until 12 or 15 weeks, there&rsquo;s not enough there for, to not be specific,</p>
<p>but to be kind of how people feel about it, to outweigh a woman&rsquo;s bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>And then beyond that point, then there&rsquo;s enough of an interest in the life of the preborn</p>
<p>child.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s developed enough that now we care about it enough that it outweighs a woman&rsquo;s bodily</p>
<p>autonomy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the strongest case for pro-life in your mind?</p>
<p>I mean, the strongest case for pro-life is that from conception, a human life has been</p>
<p>created.</p>
<p>It is a human life with potential.</p>
<p>That human life potential, with potential, now has an independent interest in its own</p>
<p>existence.</p>
<p>If I may just ask a quick question.</p>
<p>So conception is when a sperm fertilizes an egg?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Just to clarify the biological beginning of what conception is.</p>
<p>I mean, because that is the beginning of human life.</p>
<p>Now, there are other standards that people have drawn, right?</p>
<p>Some people say implantation in the uterus.</p>
<p>Some people will suggest viability, some brain development or heart development.</p>
<p>But the clear dividing line between a human life exists and a human life does not exist</p>
<p>is the biological creation of an independent human life with its own DNA strands and etc,</p>
<p>which happens at conception.</p>
<p>Once you acknowledge that there is that independent human life with potential, and I keep calling</p>
<p>it that because people sometimes say potential human life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a potential human life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a human life that is not developed yet to the full extent that it will develop.</p>
<p>Once you say that, and once you say that it has its own interest, now the burden of proof</p>
<p>is to explain why bodily autonomy ought to allow for the snuffing out of that human life</p>
<p>if we believe that human life ought not to be killed for, quote unquote, no good reason.</p>
<p>You have to come up with a good reason, right?</p>
<p>The burden of proof has now shifted.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ll find people who will say, well, the good reason is that it&rsquo;s not sufficiently</p>
<p>developed to outweigh the mental trauma or emotional trauma that a woman goes through</p>
<p>if, for example, she was raped or the victim of incest, and that is a fairly emotionally</p>
<p>resonant argument, but it&rsquo;s not necessarily positive.</p>
<p>You can make the argument that just because something horrific and horrible happened to</p>
<p>a woman does not rob the human life of its interest in life.</p>
<p>One of the big problems in trying to draw any line for the self-interest of life in the human</p>
<p>life is that it&rsquo;s very difficult to draw any other line that doesn&rsquo;t seem somewhat arbitrary.</p>
<p>You say that independent heartbeat, well, people have pacemakers.</p>
<p>If you say brain function, people have various levels of brain function as adults.</p>
<p>If you say viability, babies are not viable after they are born.</p>
<p>If I left a newborn baby on a table and did not take care of it, it would be dead in two days.</p>
<p>So once you start getting into these lines, it starts to get very fuzzy very quickly,</p>
<p>and so if you&rsquo;re looking for a bright-line moral rule, that would be the bright-line</p>
<p>moral rule, and that&rsquo;s the pro-life case.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s still mysterious, difficult scientific questions of things like consciousness.</p>
<p>So what do you&hellip;</p>
<p>Does the question of consciousness, how does it come into play into this debate?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t believe that consciousness is the</p>
<p>sole criterion by which we judge the self-interest in human life.</p>
<p>So we are unconscious a good deal of our lives, right?</p>
<p>That does not&hellip;</p>
<p>We will be conscious again, right, when you&rsquo;re unconscious, when you&rsquo;re asleep, for example.</p>
<p>Presumably, your life is still worth living.</p>
<p>If somebody came in and killed you, that&rsquo;d be a serious moral quandary at the very least.</p>
<p>But the birth of consciousness, the lighting up of the flame, the initial lighting up the flame,</p>
<p>there does seem to be something special about that, and it&rsquo;s a mystery of when that happens.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, Peter Singer makes the case that basically self-consciousness doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist until you&rsquo;re two and a half, right?</p>
<p>So he says that even infanticide should be okay, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the bioethicist over at Princeton.</p>
<p>So you get into some real dicey territory once you get into consciousness.</p>
<p>Also, the truth is that consciousness is more of a spectrum than it is a dividing line,</p>
<p>meaning that there are people with various degrees of brain function.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t actually know how conscious they are.</p>
<p>And you can get into eugenic territory pretty quickly when we start dividing between lives</p>
<p>that are worth living based on levels of consciousness and lives that are not worth</p>
<p>living based on levels of consciousness.</p>
<p>Do you find that the aspect of women&rsquo;s freedom,</p>
<p>do you feel the tension between that ability to choose</p>
<p>the trajectory of your own life versus the rights of the unborn child?</p>
<p>In one situation, yes.</p>
<p>In one situation, no.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve had sex with a person voluntarily, and as a product of that you are now pregnant,</p>
<p>no.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve taken an action with a perfectly predictable result.</p>
<p>Even if you took birth control, this is the way that human beings procreated for literally</p>
<p>all of human existence.</p>
<p>And by the way, also how all mammals procreate.</p>
<p>So the idea that this was an entirely unforeseen consequence of your activity,</p>
<p>I find I have less sympathy for you in that particular situation because you could have</p>
<p>made decisions that would not lead you to this particular impasse.</p>
<p>In fact, this used to be the basis of marriage, right?</p>
<p>It was when we were a apparently more terrible society.</p>
<p>We used to say that people should wait until they get married to have sex,</p>
<p>a position that I still hold.</p>
<p>And the reason for that was because then if you have sex and you produce a child,</p>
<p>then the child will grow up in a two-parent family with stability.</p>
<p>So, you know, not a ton of sympathy there.</p>
<p>When it comes to rape and incest, obviously heavy, heavy sympathy.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I think you see, statistically speaking, a huge percentage of Americans,</p>
<p>including many pro-life Americans, people who consider themselves pro-life,</p>
<p>would consider exceptions for rape and incest.</p>
<p>One of the sort of dishonest things that I think happens in abortion debates</p>
<p>is arguing from the fringes.</p>
<p>This tends to happen a lot, is pro-choice activists will argue from rape and incest</p>
<p>to the other 99.8% of abortions.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;ll see people on the pro-life side argue from partial birth abortion to all of abortion.</p>
<p>You actually have to take on sort of the mainstream case</p>
<p>and then decide whether or not that&rsquo;s acceptable or not.</p>
<p>But to you, the exception, just ethically, without generalizing it,</p>
<p>that is a valid ethically exception.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hold that there should be an exception for rape or incest because,</p>
<p>again, I hold by the bright line rule that once a human life with potential exists,</p>
<p>it has its own interest in life that cannot be curbed by your self-interest.</p>
<p>The only exception that I hold by is the same exception that literally all pro-lifers hold by,</p>
<p>which is the life of the mother is put in danger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a tough, tough topic because if you believe that that&rsquo;s the line,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re committing mass murder.</p>
<p>Or at least mass killing.</p>
<p>So I would say that murder typically requires a level of mens rea</p>
<p>that may be absent in many cases of abortion.</p>
<p>Because the usual follow-on question is,</p>
<p>well, if it&rsquo;s murder, why not prosecute the woman?</p>
<p>And the answer is because the vast majority of people who are having abortions</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually believe that they&rsquo;re killing a person.</p>
<p>They have a very different view of what is exactly happening.</p>
<p>So I would say that there are all sorts of interesting hypotheticals that come in</p>
<p>to play when it comes to abortion.</p>
<p>And you can play them any which way.</p>
<p>But levels, let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>There are gradations of wrongs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that all abortions are equally blameworthy,</p>
<p>even if I would ban virtually all of them.</p>
<p>I think that there are mitigating circumstances that make, while being wrong,</p>
<p>some abortions less morally blameworthy than others.</p>
<p>I think that I can admit a difference between killing a two-week-old embryo in the womb</p>
<p>and stabbing a seven-year-old in the face.</p>
<p>I can recognize all that while still saying I think that it would be wrong</p>
<p>to terminate a pregnancy.</p>
<p>Do you think the question of when life begins, which I think is a fascinating question,</p>
<p>is a question of science or a question of religion?</p>
<p>I mean, when life begins, it&rsquo;s a question of science.</p>
<p>When that life becomes valuable enough for people to want to protect it</p>
<p>is going to be a question that is beyond science.</p>
<p>Science doesn&rsquo;t have moral judgments to make about the value of human life.</p>
<p>This is one of the problems that Sam Harris and I have had this argument many times,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Because Sam is of the opinion that you can get to ought from is, right?</p>
<p>That science says is, therefore, we can learn ought.</p>
<p>So human flourishing is the goal of life.</p>
<p>And I always say to him, I don&rsquo;t see where you get that from evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>You can assume it, just say you&rsquo;re assuming it,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t pretend that that is a conclusion that you can draw straight from</p>
<p>biological reality itself.</p>
<p>Because obviously, that doesn&rsquo;t exist in the animal world, for example.</p>
<p>Nobody assumes the innate value of every ant.</p>
<p>I think I know your answer to this, but let&rsquo;s test it,</p>
<p>because I think you&rsquo;re going to be wrong.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a robot behind you.</p>
<p>Do you think there will be a time in the future</p>
<p>when it will be unethical and illegal to kill a robot,</p>
<p>because they will have sentience?</p>
<p>My guess is you would say, no, Lex,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a fundamental difference between humans and robots.</p>
<p>And I just want to get you on record, because I think you&rsquo;ll be wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends on the level of development, I would assume, of the robots.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re assuming a complexity in the robots</p>
<p>that eventually imitates what we in the religious life would call the human soul,</p>
<p>the ability to choose freely, for example,</p>
<p>which I believe is sort of the capacity for human beings.</p>
<p>The ability to suffer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If all of that could be proved and not programmed,</p>
<p>meaning the freely willed capacity of a machine to do X, Y, or Z.</p>
<p>You could not pinpoint exactly where it happens in the program.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not deterministic.</p>
<p>Then it would raise serious moral issues, for sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I know the answer to that question.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of that time?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m afraid of that time.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s any more than I&rsquo;d be afraid</p>
<p>if aliens arrived in the world and had these characteristics.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s just a lot of moral complexities,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be in the physical space.</p>
<p>They can be in the digital space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an increased sophistication and number of bots on the internet,</p>
<p>including on Twitter,</p>
<p>as they become more and more intelligent,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be serious questions about what is our moral duty</p>
<p>to protect ones that have or claim to have an identity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be really interesting.</p>
<p>Actually, what I&rsquo;m afraid of is the opposite happening,</p>
<p>meaning that people&hellip;</p>
<p>The worst that should happen is that we develop robots so sophisticated</p>
<p>that they appear to have free will,</p>
<p>and then we treat them with human dignity.</p>
<p>That should be the worst that happens.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m afraid of is the opposite,</p>
<p>is that if we&rsquo;re talking about this particular hypothetical,</p>
<p>that we develop robots that have all of these apparent abilities,</p>
<p>and then we dehumanize them,</p>
<p>which leads us to also dehumanize the other humans around us,</p>
<p>which you could easily see happening.</p>
<p>The devaluation of life to the point where it doesn&rsquo;t really&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, people have always treated, unfortunately,</p>
<p>newly discovered other humans this way,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s actually a new problem.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a pretty old problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll just be interesting when it&rsquo;s made of human hands.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to celebrate humanity</p>
<p>or to bring out the worst in humanity,</p>
<p>so the derision that naturally happens,</p>
<p>like you said, with pointing out the other.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about climate change.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go from the meme to the profound philosophy.</p>
<p>Okay, the meme was there&rsquo;s a clip of you</p>
<p>talking about climate change and saying that&hellip;</p>
<p>Ah, the Aquaman meme.</p>
<p>You said that for the sake of argument,</p>
<p>if the water level rises five to 10 feet</p>
<p>in the next hundred years,</p>
<p>people will just sell their homes and move,</p>
<p>and then the meme was sell to who?</p>
<p>Can you argue both sides of that?</p>
<p>The argument that they&rsquo;re making is a straw man.</p>
<p>The argument that I&rsquo;m making is over time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean that if a tsunami is about to hit your house,</p>
<p>you can list it on eBay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I mean, obviously.</p>
<p>What I mean is that human beings</p>
<p>have an extraordinary ability to adapt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually our best quality,</p>
<p>and that as water levels rise,</p>
<p>real estate prices in those areas tends to fall,</p>
<p>that over time, people tend to abandon those areas.</p>
<p>They tend to leave.</p>
<p>They tend to, right now, sell their houses,</p>
<p>and then they tend to move,</p>
<p>and eventually those houses will be worthless,</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t have anybody to sell to,</p>
<p>but presumably not that many people</p>
<p>will be living there by that point,</p>
<p>which is one of the reasons why the price would be low,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no demand.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s over a hundred years,</p>
<p>so all of these price dynamics are very gradual</p>
<p>relative to the other price dynamics.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the joke of it, of course,</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m saying that tomorrow</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tsunami on your doorstep,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, oh, Bob will buy my house.</p>
<p>Bob ain&rsquo;t gonna buy your house.</p>
<p>We all get that, but it&rsquo;s a funny meme.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit I laughed at it.</p>
<p>How is your view on climate change?</p>
<p>The human contribution to climate change,</p>
<p>what we should do in terms of policy</p>
<p>to respond to climate change,</p>
<p>how has that changed over the years?</p>
<p>I would say, the truth is, for years and years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve believed that climate change was a reality,</p>
<p>and that anthropogenic climate change is a reality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t argue with the IPCC estimates.</p>
<p>I know climatologists at places like MIT or Caltech,</p>
<p>and they know this stuff better than I do.</p>
<p>So the notion that climate change is just not happening,</p>
<p>or that human beings have not contributed to climate change,</p>
<p>I find doubtful.</p>
<p>The question is to what extent human beings</p>
<p>are contributing to climate change.</p>
<p>Is it 50%? Is it 70%? Is it 90%?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a little bit more play in the joints there,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not totally clear.</p>
<p>The one thing I do know,</p>
<p>and this I know with factual accuracy,</p>
<p>is that all of the measures that are currently being proposed</p>
<p>are unworkable and will not happen.</p>
<p>So when people say Paris Climate Accords,</p>
<p>even if those were imposed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about lowering the potential trajectory</p>
<p>of climate change by a fraction of a degree.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about Green New Deal, net zero by 2050,</p>
<p>the carbon is up there in the air,</p>
<p>and the climate change is going to happen.</p>
<p>Also, you&rsquo;re assuming that geopolitical dynamics don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s going to magically get on the same page,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all going to be imposing massive carbon taxes</p>
<p>to get to net zero by 2050.</p>
<p>I mean, like hundreds of times higher</p>
<p>than they currently are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not me saying, that&rsquo;s Klaus Schwab saying this</p>
<p>of the World Economic Forum,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a big advocate of exactly this sort of policy.</p>
<p>And the reality is that we&rsquo;re going to have to accept</p>
<p>that at least 1.5 degrees Celsius of climate change</p>
<p>is baked into the cake by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Again, not me talking, William Nordhaus, the economist,</p>
<p>who just won the Nobel Prize in this stuff, talking.</p>
<p>And so what that suggests to me is what we&rsquo;ve always known.</p>
<p>Human beings are crap at mitigation</p>
<p>and excellence in adaptation.</p>
<p>All right, we are very bad at mitigating our own faults.</p>
<p>We are very, very good at adapting</p>
<p>to the problems as they exist.</p>
<p>Which means that all of the estimates</p>
<p>that billions will die,</p>
<p>that there will be mass starvation,</p>
<p>that we will see the migration in just a few years</p>
<p>of hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>Those are wrong.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll see is a gradual change of living.</p>
<p>People will move away from areas</p>
<p>that are inundated on the coast.</p>
<p>You will see people building seawalls.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see people adapting new technologies</p>
<p>to suck carbon out of the air.</p>
<p>You will see geoengineering.</p>
<p>This is the sort of stuff that we should be focused on.</p>
<p>And the sort of bizarre focus on,</p>
<p>what if we just keep tossing hundreds of billions of dollars</p>
<p>at the same three technologies over and over</p>
<p>in the hopes that if we subsidize it,</p>
<p>this will magically make it more efficient.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen no evidence whatsoever</p>
<p>that that is going to be the way</p>
<p>that we get ourselves out of this.</p>
<p>Necessity being the mother of invention.</p>
<p>I think human beings will adapt</p>
<p>because we have adapted and we will continue to adapt.</p>
<p>So to the degree we invest in the threat of this,</p>
<p>it should be into the policies</p>
<p>that help with the adaptation versus the mitigation.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Seawalls, geoengineering,</p>
<p>developing technologies to suck carbon out of the air.</p>
<p>Again, if I thought that there was more sort of hope</p>
<p>for the green technologies currently in play,</p>
<p>then subsidization of those technologies</p>
<p>I might be a little bit more for,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t seen tremendous progress</p>
<p>over the course of the last 30 years</p>
<p>in the reliability of, for example, wind energy</p>
<p>or the ability to store solar energy</p>
<p>to the extent necessary to actually power a grid.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your thoughts on nuclear energy?</p>
<p>Nuclear energy is great.</p>
<p>Nuclear energy is a proven source of energy</p>
<p>and we should be radically extending</p>
<p>the use of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>To me, honestly, this is like a litmus test question</p>
<p>as to whether you take climate change seriously.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on right or left</p>
<p>and you take climate change seriously,</p>
<p>you should be in favor of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not, I know that you&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>you have other priorities.</p>
<p>Yeah, the fascinating thing</p>
<p>about the climate change debate</p>
<p>is the dynamics of the fear-mongering</p>
<p>over the past few decades</p>
<p>because some of the nuclear energy</p>
<p>was tied up into that somehow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of fear about nuclear energy.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a lot of social phenomena,</p>
<p>social dynamics involved versus dealing with just science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to watch.</p>
<p>If on my darker days,</p>
<p>it makes me cynical about our ability</p>
<p>to use reason and science</p>
<p>to deal with the threats of the world.</p>
<p>I think that our ability to use reason and science</p>
<p>to deal with threats of the world</p>
<p>is almost a timeframe question.</p>
<p>So I think that, again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re very bad at looking down the road and saying,</p>
<p>because people can&rsquo;t handle, for example,</p>
<p>even things like compound interest.</p>
<p>The idea that if I put a dollar in the bank today,</p>
<p>that 15 years from now,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be worth a lot more than a dollar.</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t actually see that.</p>
<p>And so the idea of let&rsquo;s foresee a problem</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll deal with it right now</p>
<p>as opposed to 30 years down the road,</p>
<p>typically we let the problem happen</p>
<p>and then we solve it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s bloodier and worse</p>
<p>than it would have been if we had solved it 30 years ago.</p>
<p>But it is in fact effective.</p>
<p>And sometimes it turns out the solution</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re proposing 30 years in advance is not effective.</p>
<p>And that can be a major problem as well.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s then to steel man the case for fear mongering,</p>
<p>for irrational fear mongering.</p>
<p>We need to be scared shitless</p>
<p>in order for us to do anything.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m generally against that,</p>
<p>but maybe on a population scale,</p>
<p>maybe some of that is necessary</p>
<p>for us to respond appropriately</p>
<p>for two long-term threats,</p>
<p>we should be scared shitless.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we can actually do that though.</p>
<p>First of all, I think that platonic lies are generally bad.</p>
<p>And then second of all,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we actually have the capacity to do this.</p>
<p>I think that the people who are</p>
<p>the sort of elites of our society</p>
<p>who get together in rooms</p>
<p>and talk about this sort of stuff,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been in some of those meetings</p>
<p>at my synagogues Friday nights, actually.</p>
<p>No, but-</p>
<p>I was gonna make the joke,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m glad you did.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve been in rooms,</p>
<p>Davos-like rooms.</p>
<p>And when people discuss these sorts of topics</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>what if we just tell people</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna be a disaster with tsunamis</p>
<p>and day after tomorrow?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you guys don&rsquo;t have that power.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>you dramatically undercut your own power</p>
<p>because of COVID to do this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>Because a lot of the sort of,</p>
<p>what if we scare the living hell out of you</p>
<p>to the point where you stay in your own house for two years</p>
<p>and we tell you, you can&rsquo;t send your kids to school.</p>
<p>And then we tell you that the vaccine</p>
<p>is gonna prevent transmission.</p>
<p>And then we also tell you</p>
<p>that we need to spend $7 trillion in one year</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t have any inflationary effect.</p>
<p>And it turns out you&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>on literally all of those things.</p>
<p>The last few years have done more</p>
<p>to undermine institutional trust</p>
<p>than any time in probably American history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tend to agree with that.</p>
<p>The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.</p>
<p>Let me ask you back to the question of God</p>
<p>and a big ridiculous question.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s God?</p>
<p>Who is God?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to use sort of the Aquinas formulation</p>
<p>of what God is, right?</p>
<p>That if there is a cause of all things,</p>
<p>not physical things,</p>
<p>if there is a cause underlying the reason of the universe,</p>
<p>then that is the thing we call God.</p>
<p>So not a big guy in the sky with a beard.</p>
<p>You know, like he is the force underlying</p>
<p>the logic of the universe</p>
<p>if there is a logic to the universe.</p>
<p>And he is the creator in the Judaic view of that universe.</p>
<p>And he does have an interest</p>
<p>in us living in accordance with the laws of the universe</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re a religious Jew are encoded in the Torah,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re not a religious Jew,</p>
<p>it would be included in the natural law</p>
<p>by sort of Catholic theology.</p>
<p>Why do you think God created the universe?</p>
<p>Or as is popularly asked,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning behind it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>So I think that the meaning of life</p>
<p>is to fulfill what God made you to do.</p>
<p>And that is a series of roles.</p>
<p>I think that human beings,</p>
<p>and here you have to look to sort of human nature</p>
<p>rather than looking kind of to big questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve evolved something that I&rsquo;ve really been working on.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m writing a book about this actually,</p>
<p>that I call colloquially role theory.</p>
<p>And basically the idea is that</p>
<p>the way that we interact with the world</p>
<p>is through a series of roles.</p>
<p>And those are also the things we find most important</p>
<p>and most implementable.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s sort of virtue ethics, right?</p>
<p>Which suggests that if we act in accordance with virtue,</p>
<p>like Aristotle,</p>
<p>then we will be living the most fulfilled</p>
<p>and meaningful life.</p>
<p>And then you have sort of deontological ethics,</p>
<p>like Kantian ethics, that it&rsquo;s a rule-based ethic.</p>
<p>If you follow the rules,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll find the meaning of life.</p>
<p>And then what I&rsquo;m proposing is that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that I would call role ethics,</p>
<p>which is there are a series of roles</p>
<p>that we play across our lives,</p>
<p>which are also the things that we tend to put</p>
<p>on our tombstones and find the most meaningful.</p>
<p>So when you go to a cemetery,</p>
<p>you can see what people found the most meaningful</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the stuff they put on the stone</p>
<p>that has like four words on it, right?</p>
<p>Like beloved father, beloved mother, sister, brother.</p>
<p>And you might have a job once in a while,</p>
<p>a creator, a religious person, right?</p>
<p>These are all roles that have existed across societies</p>
<p>and across humanity.</p>
<p>And those are the things where we actually find meaning.</p>
<p>And the way that we navigate those roles brings us meaning.</p>
<p>And I think that God created us</p>
<p>in order to fulfill those roles</p>
<p>for purposes that I can&rsquo;t begin to understand</p>
<p>because I ain&rsquo;t him.</p>
<p>And the more we recognize those roles</p>
<p>and the more we live those roles,</p>
<p>and then we can express freedom within those roles.</p>
<p>I think that the liberty exists</p>
<p>inside each of those roles,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what makes all of our lives different and fun.</p>
<p>We all parents in different ways,</p>
<p>but being a parent is a meaningful role.</p>
<p>We all have spouses,</p>
<p>but how you interact that relationship</p>
<p>is what makes your life meaningful and interesting.</p>
<p>And that is what we were put on earth to do.</p>
<p>And if we perform those roles properly,</p>
<p>and those roles do include things like being a creator,</p>
<p>like we have a creative instinct as human beings,</p>
<p>being a creator, being an innovator,</p>
<p>being a defender of your family,</p>
<p>being somebody who builds up,</p>
<p>being a social member of your community,</p>
<p>which is something that we&rsquo;re built to do.</p>
<p>If we fulfill those roles properly,</p>
<p>then we will have made the world a better place</p>
<p>than we inherited it.</p>
<p>And we will also have had the joy</p>
<p>of experiencing the sort of flow</p>
<p>they talk about in psychology,</p>
<p>where when you engage in these roles,</p>
<p>you actually do feel a flow.</p>
<p>So these roles are a fundamental part</p>
<p>of the human condition?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So the book you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>is constructing a system to help us understand?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s looking at,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume that all that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>The real question of the book</p>
<p>is how do you construct a flourishing</p>
<p>and useful society in politics?</p>
<p>So a society level.</p>
<p>If this is our understanding of a human being,</p>
<p>how do we construct a good society?</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Because I think that a lot of political theory</p>
<p>is right now based in either</p>
<p>J.S. Mill kind of thought,</p>
<p>which is all that a good politics does</p>
<p>is allows you to wave your hand around</p>
<p>until you hit somebody in the face.</p>
<p>Or Rawlsian thought,</p>
<p>which is what if we constructed society</p>
<p>in order to achieve the most for the least, essentially?</p>
<p>You know, what if we constructed society</p>
<p>around what actually makes humans the most fulfilled?</p>
<p>And that is the fulfillment of these particular roles.</p>
<p>And where does liberty come into that, right?</p>
<p>How do you avoid the idea of a tyranny in that, right?</p>
<p>How do you, you have to be a mother.</p>
<p>You must be a father.</p>
<p>You must be, where does freedom come into that?</p>
<p>Can you reject those roles totally as a society and be okay?</p>
<p>The answer probably is not.</p>
<p>So you need a society that actually</p>
<p>promotes and protects those roles,</p>
<p>but also protects the freedom inside those roles.</p>
<p>And that raises a more fundamental question</p>
<p>of what exactly liberty is for.</p>
<p>And I think that both the right and the left</p>
<p>actually tend to make a mistake</p>
<p>when they discuss liberty.</p>
<p>The left tends to think that liberty is an ultimate good,</p>
<p>that simple choice makes a bad thing good,</p>
<p>which is not true.</p>
<p>And I think the right talks about liberty</p>
<p>in almost the same terms sometimes.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s not true either.</p>
<p>The question is whether liberty is of inherent value</p>
<p>or instrumental value.</p>
<p>Is liberty good in and of itself,</p>
<p>or is liberty good because it allows you</p>
<p>to achieve X, Y, or Z?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve thought about this one a lot,</p>
<p>and I tend to come down on the latter side of the aisle.</p>
<p>I mean, this is, you asked me areas where I&rsquo;ve moved.</p>
<p>This may be an area where I&rsquo;ve moved,</p>
<p>is that I think when you think more shallowly about politics,</p>
<p>or maybe more quickly,</p>
<p>because this is how we talk in America,</p>
<p>is about liberties and rights.</p>
<p>We tend to think that the right is what makes,</p>
<p>not like the political right,</p>
<p>rights make things good, liberties make things good.</p>
<p>The question really is what are those rights</p>
<p>and liberties for?</p>
<p>Now, you have to be careful</p>
<p>so that that doesn&rsquo;t shade into tyranny, right?</p>
<p>You can only have liberty to do the thing</p>
<p>that I say that you can do.</p>
<p>But there have to be spheres of liberty</p>
<p>that are roiling and interesting and filled with debate,</p>
<p>but without threatening the chief institutions</p>
<p>that surround those liberties.</p>
<p>Because if you destroy the institutions,</p>
<p>liberties will go too.</p>
<p>If you knock down the pillars of the society,</p>
<p>the liberties that are on top of those pillars</p>
<p>are going to collapse.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if people are feeling as though we&rsquo;re on the verge of tyranny,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>This is fascinating, by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an instrumental perspective on liberty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna give me a lot to think about.</p>
<p>Let me ask a personal question.</p>
<p>Was there ever a time that you had a crisis of faith</p>
<p>where you questioned your belief in God?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And I would less call it a crisis of faith</p>
<p>than an ongoing question of faith,</p>
<p>which I think is, I hope, most religious people.</p>
<p>And the word Israel, right, in Hebrew,</p>
<p>Yisrael means to struggle with God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally what the word means.</p>
<p>And so the idea of struggling with God, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Jewish, you&rsquo;re B&rsquo;nai Yisrael, right?</p>
<p>The idea of struggling with God, I think,</p>
<p>is endemic to the human condition.</p>
<p>If you understand what God&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>then I think you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And if you think that that question doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>then I think you&rsquo;re also wrong.</p>
<p>I think that God is a very necessary hypothesis.</p>
<p>So struggle, the struggle with God is life.</p>
<p>That is the process of life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re never gonna get to that answer.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;re God and you aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Why does God allow cruelty and suffering in the world?</p>
<p>One of the tough questions.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going deep here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two types of cruelty and suffering.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re talking about human cruelty and suffering,</p>
<p>because God does not intervene to prevent people</p>
<p>from exercising their free will,</p>
<p>because to do so would be to deprive human beings</p>
<p>of the choice that makes them human.</p>
<p>This is the sin of the Garden of Eden, basically,</p>
<p>is that God could make you an angel,</p>
<p>in which case you wouldn&rsquo;t have the choice</p>
<p>to do the wrong thing.</p>
<p>But so long as we are going to allow for cause and effect</p>
<p>in a universe shaped by your choice,</p>
<p>cruelty and evil are going to exist.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the question of just the natural</p>
<p>cruelty and vicissitudes of life.</p>
<p>And the answer there is, I think that God obscures himself.</p>
<p>I think that if God were to appear in all of his glory</p>
<p>to people on a regular basis,</p>
<p>I think that would make faith, you wouldn&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be no such thing as faith, right?</p>
<p>It would just be reality, right?</p>
<p>Nobody has to prove to you that the sun rises every day.</p>
<p>But if God is to allow us the choice to believe in him,</p>
<p>which is the ultimate choice from a religious point of view,</p>
<p>then he&rsquo;s going to have to obscure himself</p>
<p>behind tragedy and horror and all those other things.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a fairly well-known</p>
<p>Kabbalistic concept called Tzimtzum in Judaism,</p>
<p>which is the idea that when God created the universe,</p>
<p>he sort of withdrew in order to make space</p>
<p>for all of these things to happen.</p>
<p>So God doesn&rsquo;t have an instrumental perspective on liberty.</p>
<p>In a chief sense, he does,</p>
<p>because the best use of liberty is going to be belief in him.</p>
<p>And you can misuse your liberty, right?</p>
<p>There will be consequences if you believe in an afterlife,</p>
<p>or if you believe in sort of a generalized,</p>
<p>better version of life led by faith,</p>
<p>then liberty does have a purpose.</p>
<p>But he also believes that you have to give people,</p>
<p>from a cosmic perspective, the liberty to do wrong</p>
<p>without threatening all the institutions of society.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why it does say in the Bible</p>
<p>that if man sheds blood by man shall his blood be shed, right?</p>
<p>There are punishments that are in biblical thought</p>
<p>for doing things that are wrong.</p>
<p>So for a human being who lacks the faith in God,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re an atheist, can you still be a good person?</p>
<p>Of course, 100%.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of religious people who are crappy people.</p>
<p>How do we understand that tension?</p>
<p>Well, from a religious perspective,</p>
<p>what you would say is that it is perfectly plausible</p>
<p>to live in accordance with a set of rules</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t damage other people without believing in God.</p>
<p>You just might be understanding</p>
<p>the reason for doing that wrong,</p>
<p>is what a religious person would say.</p>
<p>This is the conversation, again,</p>
<p>that I had with Sam, basically,</p>
<p>is you and I agree, I said this to Sam,</p>
<p>you and I agree on nearly everything</p>
<p>when it comes to morality.</p>
<p>Like we probably disagree on 15 to 20% of things.</p>
<p>The other 80% is because you grew up</p>
<p>in a Judeo-Christian society and so do I,</p>
<p>and we grew up 10 miles from each other,</p>
<p>you know, around the turn of the millennium.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>So you can perfectly well be an atheist</p>
<p>living a good, moral, decent life</p>
<p>because you can live a good, moral, decent life</p>
<p>with regard to other people without believing in God.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can build a society on that</p>
<p>because I think that, you know,</p>
<p>that relies on the sort of goodness of mankind,</p>
<p>natural goodness of mankind.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in the natural goodness of mankind.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I believe in, I believe that man is created</p>
<p>both sinful and with the capacity for sin</p>
<p>and the capacity for good.</p>
<p>But if you let them be on their own,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t, doesn&rsquo;t it-</p>
<p>Without social institutions to shape them,</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s very likely to go poorly.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Well, we came to something we disagree on,</p>
<p>but that may be, that might reflect itself</p>
<p>in our approach to Twitter as well.</p>
<p>I think if humans are left on their own,</p>
<p>they tend towards good.</p>
<p>They definitely have the capacity for good and evil,</p>
<p>but when left on their own,</p>
<p>I tend to believe they&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>I think they might be good with limits.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is that</p>
<p>what the evidence I think tends to show</p>
<p>is that human beings are quite tribal.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;ll end up with is people</p>
<p>who are good with their immediate family</p>
<p>and maybe their immediate neighbors.</p>
<p>And then when they&rsquo;re threatened by an outside tribe,</p>
<p>then they kill everyone,</p>
<p>which is sort of the history of civilization</p>
<p>in the pre-civilizational era,</p>
<p>which was a very violent time.</p>
<p>Pre-civilizational era was quite violent.</p>
<p>Do you think on the topic of tribalism</p>
<p>in our modern world,</p>
<p>what are the pros and cons of tribes?</p>
<p>Is that something where we should try</p>
<p>to outgrow as a civilization?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s ever gonna be possible</p>
<p>to fully outgrow tribalism.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a natural human condition</p>
<p>to want to be with people who think like you</p>
<p>or have a common set of beliefs.</p>
<p>And I think trying to obliterate that</p>
<p>in the name of a universalism</p>
<p>likely leads to utopian results</p>
<p>that have devastating consequences.</p>
<p>Utopian sort of universalism</p>
<p>has been failing every time it&rsquo;s tried.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>now it seems to be sort of a liberal universalism,</p>
<p>which is being rejected by a huge number of people</p>
<p>around the world in various different cultures,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re talking about religious universalism,</p>
<p>which typically comes with religious tyranny,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re talking about communistic</p>
<p>or Nazi-esque sort of universalism,</p>
<p>which comes with mass slaughter.</p>
<p>So this is, universalism, I&rsquo;m not a believer in.</p>
<p>I think that you have some values</p>
<p>that are fairly limited</p>
<p>that all human beings should hold in common.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty much it.</p>
<p>Like, I think that everybody should have</p>
<p>the ability to join with their own culture.</p>
<p>I think how we define tribes is a different thing.</p>
<p>So I think that tribes should not be defined</p>
<p>by innate physical characteristics, for example.</p>
<p>Because I think that, thank God,</p>
<p>as a civilization, we&rsquo;ve outgrown that.</p>
<p>And I think that that is a childish way to view the world.</p>
<p>And all the tall people aren&rsquo;t a tribe.</p>
<p>All the black people, all the white people aren&rsquo;t a tribe.</p>
<p>So the tribes should be formed</p>
<p>over ideas versus physical characteristics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Which is why, actually, to go back</p>
<p>to sort of the beginning of the conversation,</p>
<p>when it comes to Jews.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not a big believer in ethnic Judaism.</p>
<p>Right, I&rsquo;m, as a person who takes Judaism seriously,</p>
<p>Judaism is more to me than you were born</p>
<p>with a last name like Berg or Steen.</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;ve made conversations-</p>
<p>Hitler would disagree with you, but-</p>
<p>He would disagree with me,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s because he was a tribalist, right?</p>
<p>He thought in racial terms, so.</p>
<p>So maybe robots will help us see humans as one tribe.</p>
<p>Maybe that, as long as-</p>
<p>This is Reagan&rsquo;s idea, right?</p>
<p>Reagan said, well, if there&rsquo;s an alien invasion,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll all be on the same side.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll go over to the Soviets and we&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some deep truth to that.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a good man?</p>
<p>The various role that a human being takes on</p>
<p>in this role theory that you&rsquo;ve spoken about,</p>
<p>what does it mean to be good?</p>
<p>It means to perform-</p>
<p>Now, I will do Aristotle.</p>
<p>It means to perform the function well.</p>
<p>What Aristotle says is the good</p>
<p>is not like moral good, moral evil,</p>
<p>in the way that we tend to think about it.</p>
<p>He meant that a good cup holds liquid.</p>
<p>A good spoon holds soup.</p>
<p>It means that a thing that is broken</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t hold those things, right?</p>
<p>So the idea of being a good person</p>
<p>means that you are fulfilling the function</p>
<p>for which you were made.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a teleological view of humanity.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a good father,</p>
<p>this means that you are bringing up your child</p>
<p>in durable values that is going to bring them up healthy,</p>
<p>capable of protecting themselves</p>
<p>and passing on the traditional wisdom of the ages</p>
<p>to future generations while allowing</p>
<p>for the capacity for innovation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be being a good father.</p>
<p>Being a good spouse would mean protecting</p>
<p>and unifying with your spouse</p>
<p>and building a safe family</p>
<p>and a place to raise children.</p>
<p>Being a good citizen of your community</p>
<p>means protecting the fellow citizens of your community</p>
<p>while incentivizing them to build for themselves.</p>
<p>And it becomes actually much easier to think of how to&hellip;</p>
<p>This is why I like the role theory</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>since sort of in virtue theory to say,</p>
<p>be generous.</p>
<p>Okay, how does that manifest?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that looks like.</p>
<p>Sometimes being generous might be</p>
<p>being not generous to other people, right?</p>
<p>When Aristotle says that you should be benevolent,</p>
<p>like what does that mean?</p>
<p>This is very vague.</p>
<p>When I say be a good dad,</p>
<p>most people sort of have a gut level understanding</p>
<p>of what it means to be a good dad.</p>
<p>And mostly what they have a gut level understanding</p>
<p>of what it means to really be a really bad dad.</p>
<p>And so what it means to be a good man</p>
<p>is to fulfill those roles,</p>
<p>as many of them as you can,</p>
<p>properly and at full function.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very hard job.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said before that,</p>
<p>because I engage a lot with the public and all of this,</p>
<p>the word great comes up a lot.</p>
<p>What does it take to be a great leader?</p>
<p>What does it take to be a great person?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always said to people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually fairly easy to be great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to be good.</p>
<p>There are a lot of very great people who are not very good.</p>
<p>And there are not a lot of good people.</p>
<p>And most of them, frankly, most good people</p>
<p>die mourned by their family and friends.</p>
<p>And two generations later, they&rsquo;re forgotten.</p>
<p>But those are the people</p>
<p>who incrementally move the ball forward in the world,</p>
<p>sometimes much more than the people who are considered great.</p>
<p>Understand the role in your life</p>
<p>that involves being a cup and be damn good at it.</p>
<p>Exactly. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Hold the soup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very&hellip;</p>
<p>Jordan Peterson have been there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very like lobster with Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>I think people will quote you</p>
<p>for years and years to come on that.</p>
<p>What advice would you give?</p>
<p>A lot of young people look up to you.</p>
<p>What advice, despite their better judgment?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just only kidding.</p>
<p>They seriously look up to you</p>
<p>and draw inspiration from your ideas,</p>
<p>from your bold thinking.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to them?</p>
<p>How to live a life worth living,</p>
<p>how to have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>and everything like that.</p>
<p>So live out the values that you think are really important</p>
<p>and seek those values in others</p>
<p>would be the first piece of advice.</p>
<p>Second piece of advice,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go on Twitter until you&rsquo;re 26.</p>
<p>Or 26.</p>
<p>Because your brain is fully developed at that point.</p>
<p>As I said early on,</p>
<p>I was on social media and writing columns</p>
<p>from the time I was 17.</p>
<p>It was a great opportunity.</p>
<p>And as it turns out,</p>
<p>a great temptation to say</p>
<p>enormous numbers of stupid things when you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re kind of trying out ideas</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re putting them on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking them off.</p>
<p>And social media permanentizes those things</p>
<p>and engraves them in stone.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s used against you for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>So I tell young people this all the time.</p>
<p>Like, if you wanna be on social media,</p>
<p>be on social media,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t post, like watch.</p>
<p>If you wanna take in information</p>
<p>and more importantly, you should read books.</p>
<p>As far as other advice,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say engage in your community.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no substitute for engaging your community</p>
<p>and engage in interpersonal action</p>
<p>because that will soften you</p>
<p>and make you a better person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become a better person since I got married.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become an even better person since I&rsquo;ve had kids.</p>
<p>So you can imagine how terrible I was</p>
<p>before all these things.</p>
<p>And engaging your community</p>
<p>does allow you to build the things that matter</p>
<p>on the most local possible level.</p>
<p>I mean, the outcome, by the way,</p>
<p>of the sort of politics of the politics of fulfillment</p>
<p>that I was talking about earlier</p>
<p>is a lot of localism</p>
<p>because the roles that I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>are largely local roles.</p>
<p>So that stuff has to be protected locally.</p>
<p>I think we focus way too much in this country</p>
<p>and others on like world beating solutions,</p>
<p>national solutions,</p>
<p>solutions that apply to hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>How do we get to the solutions</p>
<p>that apply for like five?</p>
<p>And then we get to the solutions</p>
<p>that apply to like 20.</p>
<p>And then we get to the solutions</p>
<p>that involve 200 people or a thousand people.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s solve that stuff.</p>
<p>And I think the solutions at the higher level</p>
<p>flow bottom up, not top down.</p>
<p>What about mentors and maybe role models?</p>
<p>Have you had a mentor</p>
<p>or maybe people you look up to,</p>
<p>either you interacted on a local scale,</p>
<p>like you actually knew them</p>
<p>or somebody you really looked up to?</p>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;m very lucky.</p>
<p>I grew up in a very solid two parent household.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extremely close to my parents.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived near my parents,</p>
<p>literally my entire life</p>
<p>with the exception of three years of law school.</p>
<p>And like right now,</p>
<p>they live a mile and a half from us.</p>
<p>Would you learn about life</p>
<p>from your parents and your father?</p>
<p>So, man, so many things from my parents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard one.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the good stuff from my dad</p>
<p>is that you should hold true to your values.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very big on, you have values.</p>
<p>Those values are important.</p>
<p>Hold true to them.</p>
<p>Did you understand what your values are,</p>
<p>what your principles are early on?</p>
<p>Fairly quickly, yeah.</p>
<p>And so he was very big on that,</p>
<p>which is why, for example,</p>
<p>I get asked a lot in the Jewish community</p>
<p>why I wear a kippah.</p>
<p>And the answer is it never occurred to me</p>
<p>to take off the kippah.</p>
<p>I always wore it.</p>
<p>Why would I take it off at any point?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the life that I want to live.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>So that was a big one from my dad,</p>
<p>from my mom, practicality.</p>
<p>My dad is more of a dreamer.</p>
<p>My mom is much more practical.</p>
<p>And so the sort of lessons that I learned</p>
<p>from my dad are that you can have,</p>
<p>this is sort of the counter lesson,</p>
<p>is that you can have a good idea,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t have a plan for implementation,</p>
<p>then it doesn&rsquo;t end up as reality.</p>
<p>And I think actually he&rsquo;s learned that</p>
<p>better over the course of his life too.</p>
<p>But my dad, from the time I was very young,</p>
<p>he wanted me to engage with other adults,</p>
<p>and he wanted me to learn from other people.</p>
<p>And one of his rules was if he didn&rsquo;t know something,</p>
<p>he would find somebody who he thought</p>
<p>did know the thing for me to talk to.</p>
<p>That was a big thing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very lucky.</p>
<p>I have wonderful parents.</p>
<p>As far as sort of other mentors,</p>
<p>in terms of media, Andrew Breitbart was a mentor.</p>
<p>Andrew obviously, he was kind of known in his latter days,</p>
<p>I think more for the militancy</p>
<p>than when I was very close with him.</p>
<p>So for somebody like me who doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>who knows more about the militancy,</p>
<p>can you tell me what is a great,</p>
<p>what makes him a great man?</p>
<p>Well, what made Andrew great</p>
<p>is that he engaged with everyone.</p>
<p>I mean everyone.</p>
<p>So there are videos of him rollerblading down the boulevard</p>
<p>and people would be protesting</p>
<p>and he would literally like rollerblade up to them</p>
<p>and he would say, let&rsquo;s go to lunch together.</p>
<p>And he would just do this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually who Andrew was.</p>
<p>What was the thinking behind that?</p>
<p>Just a great sexual act?</p>
<p>The two he was, he was just garrulous.</p>
<p>He was much more outgoing than I am actually.</p>
<p>He was very warm with people.</p>
<p>Like for me, I would say that with Andrew,</p>
<p>I knew Andrew for, let&rsquo;s say I met him when I was 16.</p>
<p>He passed away when I would have been 28.</p>
<p>So I knew Andrew for 10, 12 years.</p>
<p>And people who met Andrew for about 10 minutes</p>
<p>knew Andrew 99% as well as I knew Andrew</p>
<p>because he was just all out front.</p>
<p>Like everything was out here</p>
<p>and he loved talking to people.</p>
<p>He loved engaging with people.</p>
<p>And so this made him a lot of fun and unpredictable</p>
<p>and fun to watch and all of that.</p>
<p>And then I think Twitter got to him.</p>
<p>I think by, you know, Twitter is,</p>
<p>one of the lessons I learned from Andrew</p>
<p>is the counter lesson, which is Twitter can poison you.</p>
<p>Twitter can really wreck you.</p>
<p>If you spend all day on Twitter reading the comments</p>
<p>and getting angry at people who are talking about you,</p>
<p>it becomes a very difficult life.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, in the last year of his life,</p>
<p>Andrew got very caught up in that</p>
<p>because of a series of sort of circumstances.</p>
<p>It can actually affect your mind.</p>
<p>It can actually make you resentful,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I tend to agree with that.</p>
<p>So, but the lesson that I learned from Andrew</p>
<p>is engage with everybody,</p>
<p>take joy in sort of the mission that you&rsquo;re given.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t always fulfill that.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes it&rsquo;s really rough and difficult.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to pretend that it&rsquo;s all fun</p>
<p>and rainbows all the time because I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And some of the stuff that I have to cover, I don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And some of the things I have to say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly like, you know, like that happens.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, but that&rsquo;s what I learned from Andrew.</p>
<p>As far as sort of other mentors,</p>
<p>I had some teachers when I was a kid</p>
<p>who, you know, said things that stuck with me.</p>
<p>I had a fourth grade teacher named Ms. Gianetti</p>
<p>who said, don&rsquo;t let potential be written on your tombstone,</p>
<p>which is a pretty-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great line, particularly to a fourth grader.</p>
<p>But it was, you know,</p>
<p>this guy had an 11th grade English teacher</p>
<p>named Anthony Miller, who is terrific, really good writer.</p>
<p>He had studied with James Joyce</p>
<p>at Trinity College in Dublin.</p>
<p>And so he and I really got along</p>
<p>and he helped my writing a lot.</p>
<p>Did you ever have doubt in yourself?</p>
<p>I mean, especially as you got into the public eye</p>
<p>with all the attacks,</p>
<p>did you ever doubt your ability to stay strong,</p>
<p>to be able to be a voice of the ideas that you represent?</p>
<p>You definitely, I don&rsquo;t doubt my ability</p>
<p>to say what I want to say.</p>
<p>I doubt my ability to handle</p>
<p>the emotional blowback of saying it,</p>
<p>meaning that that&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>I mean, again, to take just one example,</p>
<p>in 2016, the ADL measured</p>
<p>that I was the number one target</p>
<p>of antisemitism on planet Earth.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s unpleasant.</p>
<p>And when you take critiques, not from antisemites,</p>
<p>but when you take critiques from people generally,</p>
<p>we talked about near the beginning</p>
<p>how you surround yourself with people</p>
<p>who are gonna give you good feedback.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to tell.</p>
<p>Sometimes people are giving you feedback</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s well-motivated</p>
<p>or poorly motivated.</p>
<p>And if you are trying to be a decent person,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t cut off the mechanism of feedback.</p>
<p>And so what that means is,</p>
<p>sometimes you take to heart the wrong thing</p>
<p>or you take it to heart too much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not light enough about it.</p>
<p>You take it very, very seriously.</p>
<p>You lose sleep over it.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of nights</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve just not slept</p>
<p>because of some critique somebody&rsquo;s made of me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve thought to myself, maybe that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Maybe that, and sometimes it is right.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>So some of that is good to stew in that criticism,</p>
<p>but some of that can destroy you.</p>
<p>Do you have a shortcut?</p>
<p>So Rogan has talked about taking a lot of mushrooms.</p>
<p>So since you&rsquo;re not into the mushroom thing,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your escape from that?</p>
<p>Like when you get low, when you can&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>Usually writing is a big one for me.</p>
<p>So the writing for me is cathartic.</p>
<p>I love writing.</p>
<p>That is a huge one.</p>
<p>Spending time with my family.</p>
<p>Again, I usually have a close circle of friends</p>
<p>who I will talk with in order to sort of</p>
<p>bounce ideas off of them.</p>
<p>And then once I&rsquo;ve kind of talked it through,</p>
<p>I tend to feel a little bit better.</p>
<p>Exercise is also a big one.</p>
<p>I mean, if I go a few days without exercise,</p>
<p>I tend to get pretty grumpy pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I mean, I gotta keep the six pack going somehow, man.</p>
<p>There, you and Rogan agree.</p>
<p>Well, we haven&rsquo;t, aside from Twitter, mentioned love.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of love in the human condition, Ben Shapiro?</p>
<p>Man, don&rsquo;t get asked for love too much.</p>
<p>In fact, I was-</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get that question on college camp?</p>
<p>No, I typically don&rsquo;t actually.</p>
<p>In fact, we were at an event recently.</p>
<p>It was a Daily Wire event.</p>
<p>And in the middle of this event,</p>
<p>it was a meet and greet with some of the audience.</p>
<p>And in the middle of this event,</p>
<p>this guy walks by with this girl.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking and they&rsquo;re talking to me</p>
<p>and their time kind of runs.</p>
<p>The security&rsquo;s moving them.</p>
<p>He says, no, no, no, wait, hold on a minute.</p>
<p>And he gets down on one knee</p>
<p>and he proposes to the girl in front of me.</p>
<p>And I said to him,</p>
<p>this is the weirdest proposal in human history.</p>
<p>What is happening right now?</p>
<p>Like, I was your choice of Cupid here.</p>
<p>So, well, you know, we actually like got together</p>
<p>because we listened to your show.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I can perform it</p>
<p>like a Jewish marriage right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna need like a glass.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna need some wine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna get weird real fast.</p>
<p>But yeah, so love doctor,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m typically not asked too much about.</p>
<p>The role of love is important in binding together</p>
<p>human beings who ought to be bound together.</p>
<p>And the role of respect is even more important</p>
<p>in binding together broader groups of people.</p>
<p>I think one of the mistakes that we make in politics</p>
<p>is trying to substitute love for respect or respect for love.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a big mistake.</p>
<p>So I do not bear tremendous love</p>
<p>in the same sense that I do for my family,</p>
<p>for random strangers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I love my family.</p>
<p>I love my kids.</p>
<p>Anybody who tells you they love your kid</p>
<p>as much as you love your kid is lying to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I love my community more than I love other communities.</p>
<p>I love my state more than I love other states.</p>
<p>I love my country more than I love other countries, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s all normal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>The problem of empathy can be when that becomes</p>
<p>so tight knit that you&rsquo;re not outward looking,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t actually have respect for other people.</p>
<p>So in the local level, you need love in order to protect you</p>
<p>and shield you and give you the strength to go forward.</p>
<p>And then beyond that, you need a lot of respect for people</p>
<p>who are not in the circle of love.</p>
<p>And I think trying to extend love to people</p>
<p>who either are not going to love you back</p>
<p>or are going to slap you in the face for it,</p>
<p>or who you&rsquo;re just not that close to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either it runs the risk of being airsats and fake,</p>
<p>or it can actually be counterproductive in some senses.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s some sense in which you could have love</p>
<p>for other human beings just based on the humanity</p>
<p>that connects everybody, right?</p>
<p>So you love this whole project that we&rsquo;re a part of.</p>
<p>And actually sort of another thing we disagree on,</p>
<p>so loving a stranger, like having that basic empathy</p>
<p>and compassion towards a stranger,</p>
<p>even if it can hurt you, I think is ultimately like a,</p>
<p>that to me is what it means to be a good man,</p>
<p>to live a good life,</p>
<p>is to have that compassion towards strangers.</p>
<p>Because to me, it&rsquo;s almost,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy and natural and obvious</p>
<p>to love people close to you.</p>
<p>But to step outside yourself and to love others,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the fabric of a good society.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s value to that?</p>
<p>I think there can be,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;re also discussing love</p>
<p>almost in two different senses.</p>
<p>Meaning that when I talk about love,</p>
<p>what I think of immediately is the love I bear</p>
<p>for my wife and kids, or my parents,</p>
<p>or my siblings.</p>
<p>Or the love of my close friends.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, but I think that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>using that same term to describe</p>
<p>how I feel about strangers,</p>
<p>I think would just be inaccurate.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m suggesting that respect</p>
<p>might be a more solid and realistic foundation</p>
<p>for the way that we treat people far away from us</p>
<p>or people who are strangers,</p>
<p>respect for their dignity,</p>
<p>respect for their priorities,</p>
<p>respect for their role in life.</p>
<p>It might be too much of an ask, in other words.</p>
<p>There might be the rare human being</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s capable of literally loving</p>
<p>a homeless man on the street</p>
<p>the way that he loves his own family.</p>
<p>But if you respect the homeless man on the street</p>
<p>the way that you respect your own family,</p>
<p>because everyone is deserved,</p>
<p>everyone deserves that respect,</p>
<p>I think that you get to the same end</p>
<p>without forcing people into a position</p>
<p>of unrealistically expecting themselves</p>
<p>to feel a thing they don&rsquo;t feel.</p>
<p>You know, one of the big questions in religion</p>
<p>that comes up is God makes certain requests</p>
<p>that you feel certain ways, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to be bismillah,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to be happy about certain things,</p>
<p>or, you know, you&rsquo;re supposed to love thy neighbor</p>
<p>as thyself, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that in that statement,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thy neighbor, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just like generally anyone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s love thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
<p>In any case, the-</p>
<p>I think that extends to anyone</p>
<p>that follows you on Twitter.</p>
<p>Thy neighbor, because God anticipated</p>
<p>the social network aspect</p>
<p>that is not constrained by geography.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna differ with you</p>
<p>on the interpretation on that.</p>
<p>But in any case, the sort of, you know,</p>
<p>the kind of extension of love outwards</p>
<p>might be too big an ask,</p>
<p>so maybe we can start with respect,</p>
<p>and then hopefully out of that respect</p>
<p>can grow something more</p>
<p>if people earn their way in.</p>
<p>Because I think that one of the big problems</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about universalism</p>
<p>is when people say, like, I&rsquo;m a world citizen.</p>
<p>I love people of the other country</p>
<p>as much as I love myself</p>
<p>or as much as I love my country.</p>
<p>It tends to actually lead to</p>
<p>an almost crammed down utopianism.</p>
<p>That I think can be kind of difficult</p>
<p>because with love</p>
<p>comes a certain expectation of solidarity.</p>
<p>And I think, right,</p>
<p>when you love your family, you love your wife,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a certain level of solidarity</p>
<p>that is required inside the home</p>
<p>in order to preserve the most loving kind of home.</p>
<p>And so if you love everybody,</p>
<p>then that sort of implies</p>
<p>a certain level of solidarity that may not exist.</p>
<p>So maybe the idea is, for me,</p>
<p>start with respect,</p>
<p>and then maybe as people respect each other more,</p>
<p>then love is an outgrowth of that,</p>
<p>as opposed to starting with love</p>
<p>and then hoping that respect develops.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a danger that that word becomes empty</p>
<p>and instead is used for dogmatic kind of utopianism.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the way that, for example,</p>
<p>religious theocracies very often work.</p>
<p>We love you so much, we have to convert you.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with respect.</p>
<p>What I would love to see</p>
<p>after our conversation today</p>
<p>is to see a Ben Shapiro</p>
<p>that continues the growth on Twitter</p>
<p>of being even more respectful</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;ve already been.</p>
<p>And maybe one day converting that into love on Twitter.</p>
<p>That would, if I could see that in this world,</p>
<p>that would make me die a happy man.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>A little bit more love in the world for me,</p>
<p>as a gift for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to make that happen.</p>
<p>I do have one question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna need you to tell me,</p>
<p>can I, like, which jokes are okay?</p>
<p>Are jokes still okay?</p>
<p>So yeah, can I just run your Twitter from now on?</p>
<p>You just send it to me.</p>
<p>100%, I will pre-screen you the jokes.</p>
<p>And you can tell me if this is a loving joke</p>
<p>or if this is a hate-filled obnoxious joke.</p>
<p>People will be very surprised</p>
<p>by all the heart emojis that start popping up</p>
<p>on your Twitter.</p>
<p>Ben, thank you so much for being bold and fearless</p>
<p>and exploring ideas.</p>
<p>And your Twitter aside,</p>
<p>thank you for being just good faith</p>
<p>in all the arguments</p>
<p>and all the conversations you&rsquo;re having with people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking to me.</p>
<p>Hey, thanks for having me.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Ben Shapiro.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Ben Shapiro himself.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech and thought matters,</p>
<p>especially when it is speech and thought</p>
<p>with which we disagree.</p>
<p>The moment the majority decides to destroy people</p>
<p>for engaging a thought it dislikes,</p>
<p>thought crime becomes a reality.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next time.</p>
