<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>welcome back everyone we&rsquo;re here with</p>
<p>another q a we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>everything keto and you guys might have</p>
<p>some additional questions anything that</p>
<p>I say is definitely not meant to replace</p>
<p>your medical care check with your doctor</p>
<p>before implementing any of the things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about we have some</p>
<p>great uh people in The Green Room as</p>
<p>well as people on social media so bring</p>
<p>your questions and let&rsquo;s get started</p>
<p>okay very good we do have a great one</p>
<p>and also this is a milestone for us we</p>
<p>have in Dr Berg show history the longest</p>
<p>single question in terms of word count</p>
<p>of any other one so that&rsquo;s very exciting</p>
<p>news for all of you we&rsquo;ll get to that</p>
<p>shortly but why don&rsquo;t we jump all we</p>
<p>love everyone Green Room participants of</p>
<p>course Dr Berg and also social media so</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we kick it off with some</p>
<p>social media questions to begin with and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start with Ravi from YouTube</p>
<p>please discuss the best ways to</p>
<p>naturally cleanse the liver I&rsquo;ve heard a</p>
<p>regimen of olive oil Epsom salts and</p>
<p>citrus juice is very effective any</p>
<p>comments on that doc</p>
<p>yeah just one thing you need to know</p>
<p>about the liver it&rsquo;s not a storage of</p>
<p>toxins it doesn&rsquo;t store toxins</p>
<p>uh the fat maybe in the liver might</p>
<p>store toxins but not the liver itself</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a detoxifying machine so it goes</p>
<p>through this whole biochemical</p>
<p>enzyme pathway</p>
<p>two different phases so actually three</p>
<p>different phases to be able to turn</p>
<p>poisons into harmless particles</p>
<p>so how can you</p>
<p>increase that well you want to</p>
<p>strengthen the liver</p>
<p>um cruciferous vegetables also can help</p>
<p>stimulate your own genes to actually</p>
<p>detoxify and there&rsquo;s also things in</p>
<p>those cruciferous that can help</p>
<p>dismantle poisons as well so you have</p>
<p>the cruciferous vegetables now as far as</p>
<p>lemons yes lemon is definitely a great</p>
<p>thing to help that process you also have</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>olive oil can help that process as well</p>
<p>it supports the liver but you have many</p>
<p>of the different herbs like milk thistle</p>
<p>stinging nettle root anything bitter</p>
<p>dandelion greens</p>
<p>arugula</p>
<p>any of these bitter vegetables are</p>
<p>really good to help</p>
<p>increase the ability for that liver to</p>
<p>detoxify and get rid of poisons</p>
<p>very good okay good luck with that sir</p>
<p>Steve from YouTube I&rsquo;ve lost 65 excuse</p>
<p>me 62 pounds on healthy keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>had to ring that and uh let&rsquo;s see he</p>
<p>says but he&rsquo;s got crepe skin c-r-e-p-e</p>
<p>Terry is that right does that make sense</p>
<p>crep skin</p>
<p>uh and wants to know on his arms and so</p>
<p>on and wants to know how to get rid of</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>a couple things related to that you may</p>
<p>want to make sure that you have</p>
<p>electrolytes to hold the fluid in your</p>
<p>tissue so your your tissues are not</p>
<p>too um dehydrated also you want to make</p>
<p>sure you have enough of the right fats</p>
<p>not just the saturated fats that come</p>
<p>with the keto diet but also the omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acids that might be helpful as</p>
<p>well and then you may want to just raise</p>
<p>your carb level up to but not more than</p>
<p>50 grams because the carbs tend to</p>
<p>increase water retention okay a little</p>
<p>bit more this is why I like bodybuilders</p>
<p>might go into competition and carbo load</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t recommend you do but just</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking just raise the carbs up a</p>
<p>little bit you just the car below tends</p>
<p>to it doesn&rsquo;t increase muscle it</p>
<p>basically increases the fullness</p>
<p>around your body so you so you hold more</p>
<p>fluid and that might just handle it</p>
<p>right there interesting now I can</p>
<p>visualize the crep skin sort of rippled</p>
<p>or something like that uh well good luck</p>
<p>with that Stephen congratulations again</p>
<p>on a tremendous weight loss that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>healthy the other is just a uh an</p>
<p>annoyance I&rsquo;m sure Jane from Zambia on</p>
<p>YouTube I am on I am on peripheral not</p>
<p>neuropathy supplements but we couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get that out that have 18 milligrams of</p>
<p>calcium citrate can I increase my intake</p>
<p>to support bone growth</p>
<p>well peripheral neuropathy is the um if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having supplements for that</p>
<p>then you want to take more calcium for</p>
<p>bones two different problems</p>
<p>uh to build bone you really want it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just about calcium I would recommend</p>
<p>having the full Ray of trace minerals to</p>
<p>build bone make sure you have enough uh</p>
<p>of the amino acids high quality amino</p>
<p>acids from animal Meats specifically red</p>
<p>meat and then also you definitely need</p>
<p>calcium for sure but also the vitamins</p>
<p>that help the calcium go into the bones</p>
<p>like vitamin K2</p>
<p>and so where do you get that that&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>sauerkraut uh cheese which then you can</p>
<p>also get the calcium as well uh fatty</p>
<p>liver things like that that&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>the K2 and of course don&rsquo;t forget</p>
<p>vitamin D so you can get that from the</p>
<p>Sun a cod liver oil or a supplement</p>
<p>those are the things that I would focus</p>
<p>on if you want to strengthen the bone of</p>
<p>course the peripheral neuropathy that</p>
<p>would be a combination of</p>
<p>benphotamine and alpha lipoic acid</p>
<p>all right now I just don&rsquo;t know of many</p>
<p>other shows that have the worldwide</p>
<p>support and viewership that the Dr Burke</p>
<p>show has and once again here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>evidence of that a good morning to all</p>
<p>of our viewers joining us today from the</p>
<p>UK Canada by the way we&rsquo;ve got a couple</p>
<p>of folks in The Green Room from Canada</p>
<p>Mexico Zambia uh Jordan Switzerland the</p>
<p>Czech Republic Chile South Africa India</p>
<p>Japan Colombia the Netherlands Pakistani</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates Egypt Belgium Nepal</p>
<p>Brunei the Philippines Sweden Australia</p>
<p>France Taiwan Brazil the Virgin Islands</p>
<p>Indonesia the Ukraine excuse me the</p>
<p>Ukraine Ukraine New Zealand Peru Nigeria</p>
<p>Bangladesh Poland Ireland Bermuda Oman</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago Norway Austria Greek</p>
<p>Greece Dubai Martis</p>
<p>Uganda Spain Albania aratria Israel</p>
<p>Croatia Kurdistan Bulgaria turkey</p>
<p>Finland cashmere Iran and Qatar Armenia</p>
<p>Bahrain Yugoslavia Hong Kong</p>
<p>Moldavia Tanzania Russia Portugal</p>
<p>Scotland Thailand and of course all</p>
<p>across these United States of America</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m always really nervous to read</p>
<p>that because our producer Terry is uh</p>
<p>you know broadcast you know degreed in</p>
<p>English major and he&rsquo;s a real grammarian</p>
<p>and he always catches me on</p>
<p>mispronouncing something so I&rsquo;m just in</p>
<p>an absolute sweat and panic each week as</p>
<p>I read that for fear that I have somehow</p>
<p>butchered the English language or</p>
<p>foreign pronunciations of country so</p>
<p>Terry I&rsquo;m doing the best I can Trish</p>
<p>from Facebook is mushroom coffee a good</p>
<p>alternative for a regular coffee</p>
<p>I think it is I think it is I</p>
<p>kind of wish I never started drinking</p>
<p>coffee but now I&rsquo;m addicted so</p>
<p>um but yeah mushrooms uh there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>fascinating benefits with these</p>
<p>different mushroom Beverages and</p>
<p>supplements from anti-aging to</p>
<p>anti-cancer to</p>
<p>incredible cognitive function as well so</p>
<p>I would I would definitely go that route</p>
<p>if if you&rsquo;re not addicted like myself</p>
<p>okay very good and speaking of our</p>
<p>grammarian uh Terry sent me a message</p>
<p>that that crepe is pronounced crepe so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crepe skin thank you for that Terry</p>
<p>that public humiliation Alberto from</p>
<p>YouTube</p>
<p>If the uh absorbic acid a form of</p>
<p>vitamin C is not good for us how do we</p>
<p>get the best forms of vitamin C without</p>
<p>using fresh fruits and fresh fruit</p>
<p>juices</p>
<p>you can get them from fresh vegetables</p>
<p>like the bell pepper bell peppers are</p>
<p>have loaded and also you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>give vitamin C and all the vegetables</p>
<p>and onions uh salad as well as lemons</p>
<p>juice the whole lemon and then you can</p>
<p>also get it from sauerkraut</p>
<p>that would be a good source and berries</p>
<p>are some berries are acceptable on the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet</p>
<p>okay very good here is the first quiz</p>
<p>question of the day Dr Burke</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right question which part of the</p>
<p>lemon contains most of the nutrition</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared of what you&rsquo;re going to say</p>
<p>but there it is Doc which is or audience</p>
<p>excuse me which is the most nutritious</p>
<p>part the delicious inner part or</p>
<p>something else maybe who knows okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back once again to social media</p>
<p>uh Matt from YouTube what is the best</p>
<p>way to remove toxic metals from our skin</p>
<p>cells so that our immune system can</p>
<p>properly do its job</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s filled with traffic</p>
<p>the first thing to do is to find out the</p>
<p>source where it&rsquo;s coming from and avoid</p>
<p>that and the second thing is cilantro</p>
<p>happens to be a good</p>
<p>um remedy for toxic Metals as well as um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>drinking distilled water that will help</p>
<p>help as well</p>
<p>um but then you can put the minerals</p>
<p>that you want back into the body but I</p>
<p>did a complete video on it uh heavy</p>
<p>metals is a problem for sure</p>
<p>um and so there&rsquo;s many different hidden</p>
<p>sources and uh it can really mess you up</p>
<p>and unfortunately like</p>
<p>because of the food supply</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it grows in things that have runoffs</p>
<p>from different</p>
<p>chemical companies you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>exposed to these these toxic</p>
<p>um pollutants and not just heavy metals</p>
<p>but all sorts of plastics and things</p>
<p>like that so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other things you can use too</p>
<p>like um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s the other one um</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t recall but there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s many</p>
<p>different remedies but I think those two</p>
<p>would be a good good start all right</p>
<p>very good uh uh Felipe from Facebook</p>
<p>besides Physical Therapy what would you</p>
<p>recommend to alleviate the horrible I</p>
<p>put that in symptoms of sciatica</p>
<p>well you can try Chiropractic</p>
<p>um but um</p>
<p>I have a lot of videos on sciatica I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>um the sciatic nerve is composed of uh</p>
<p>more than one nerves and it branches</p>
<p>from your lower lumbar to the lower</p>
<p>sacrum and it comes out through a little</p>
<p>um it bundles into one nerve which is</p>
<p>the largest nerve of the body and it</p>
<p>comes right up through your butt and up</p>
<p>through a little Notch that goes down</p>
<p>the back of the leg so um usually what</p>
<p>happens is some type of</p>
<p>pinching in the lumbar area could be</p>
<p>part of a protruded disc or some scar</p>
<p>tissue in that area so</p>
<p>um what you can do is you can keep that</p>
<p>curve arched inward so you want to take</p>
<p>a lumbar support or some type of cushion</p>
<p>or foam roller land your lower back to</p>
<p>keep that curve in there because when</p>
<p>you lose the curve you start putting</p>
<p>undue pressure on that lower back</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>certain vitamin deficiency things that</p>
<p>can be related to that as well I do I do</p>
<p>videos on that but I think the most</p>
<p>important thing is to keep that curve in</p>
<p>there and you don&rsquo;t want to necessarily</p>
<p>stretch</p>
<p>your hamstring on the same side you have</p>
<p>that pain you want to stretch in the</p>
<p>opposite way so if you just stretch your</p>
<p>your thigh muscle that would that would</p>
<p>give you probably more relief but I will</p>
<p>say that long</p>
<p>term sitting or driving just can really</p>
<p>aggravate that sciatic nerve all right</p>
<p>well good luck with that we hope uh</p>
<p>that you can get over that Felipe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an awful thing I&rsquo;ve suffered from that</p>
<p>but we have not suffered from an</p>
<p>unresponsive audience because they</p>
<p>already have the answer to quiz question</p>
<p>number one which asks which part of the</p>
<p>lemon contains the most nutritious part</p>
<p>and 98 of the respondents say it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>skin of the Rhine of the lemon yuck and</p>
<p>two percent say it&rsquo;s the seeds no one</p>
<p>voted for the gushy part</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re correct so if you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>eat a lemon just eat the rind and the</p>
<p>seeds and throw the rest away well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s some vitamin C in the</p>
<p>pith or not yeah the pith I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the meat of that lemon so um</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s vitamin c in there but and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a trick question because I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t tell you what nutrients so mainly</p>
<p>um the flavonoids flavonoids are a</p>
<p>general term of over</p>
<p>I think six to eight thousand to even</p>
<p>more different molecules so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quite a few and that&rsquo;s what uh lemons</p>
<p>are known for especially the little</p>
<p>white part underneath the Rhine so this</p>
<p>is this is why the best way to Consumer</p>
<p>lemon is to blend it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>versus just juicing it in the water but</p>
<p>you can still do that you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get some nutrition but you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get probably 10 times more if you uh</p>
<p>blend the whole lemon and I put a little</p>
<p>trace minerals or I might put a couple</p>
<p>drops of stevia or a little couple</p>
<p>blueberries drink that drink down it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good if you if you ever</p>
<p>drink uh lemonade sweet lemonade</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you have to try try this blending a</p>
<p>lemon and putting a couple drops maybe</p>
<p>10 drops of Stevia in there I swear you</p>
<p>this is like the the totally acceptable</p>
<p>version of lemonade that you can have</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;d really enjoy it and if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to blend it just take the</p>
<p>juice from it and add that Stevia and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great alternative to the</p>
<p>sweetened lemonade that so many people</p>
<p>consume all right I&rsquo;m gonna blast one up</p>
<p>in the blender this afternoon and try it</p>
<p>out now would you also add water to that</p>
<p>once you blast off yes yeah add add a</p>
<p>couple or two of water for sure all</p>
<p>right I&rsquo;ll report back with my findings</p>
<p>carry from YouTube what&rsquo;s the best form</p>
<p>of potassium supplements potassium</p>
<p>chloride or potassium citrate</p>
<p>I like the citrate because the citrate</p>
<p>is something that is involved in our</p>
<p>mitochondrial Krebs cycle pathway and it</p>
<p>kind of gives the raw material for</p>
<p>everything else to work and citrates</p>
<p>also bind with oxalates which actually</p>
<p>prevent kidney stones so so you have a</p>
<p>couple other nice things about that</p>
<p>citrate that can help you but</p>
<p>I will say this when you buy a potassium</p>
<p>citrate a lot of people just get it in</p>
<p>electrolyte powder be wary of</p>
<p>the manufacturing of that product</p>
<p>because a lot of companies get the</p>
<p>cheaper version and it&rsquo;s loaded with</p>
<p>maltodextrin now how would you know if</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>powder or that potassium powder that you</p>
<p>have that&rsquo;s loaded with um this starch</p>
<p>all you have to do</p>
<p>is put some water in it put in a little</p>
<p>glass and then put a couple drops of of</p>
<p>iodine in it</p>
<p>and if there&rsquo;s starch in there it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>turn dark purple</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;ll just stay yellow or</p>
<p>almost transparent so I did a video on</p>
<p>that and you&rsquo;d be shocked to find out</p>
<p>how many companies had this hidden</p>
<p>maltodextrin maltodextrin think about</p>
<p>this on the glycemic index</p>
<p>sugar is like 70 what 73 or 74. glucose</p>
<p>is 100</p>
<p>maltodextrin is like 110 to 130. so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>way way worse than actual sugar but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not even classified as a sugar it&rsquo;s they</p>
<p>made it as a starch for probably</p>
<p>marketing purposes so you wouldn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>this hidden sugar</p>
<p>interesting okay well now drum roll it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>time to go to our wonderful Green Room</p>
<p>uh with the all-female cast today we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to start off with Stacy in Alberta</p>
<p>Canada and Stacy I&rsquo;m going to unmute you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ll do the same thing and uh she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to ask you one question in 30</p>
<p>seconds and get a great answer okay go</p>
<p>ahead hit it</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been watching you</p>
<p>April 23rd of this year I have started</p>
<p>keto intermittent fasting quit drinking</p>
<p>blah blah blah I&rsquo;ve lost 60 pounds in</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um strict I went through all my</p>
<p>cupboards anyways that&rsquo;s not my question</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m on it so a year and a half ago I</p>
<p>had a hip replacement on my left hip</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>I was supposed to get another hip</p>
<p>replacement on my right hip</p>
<p>but three days after I started doing the</p>
<p>keto intermittent fasting I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taken one pill or nothing for it wow</p>
<p>yeah like I&rsquo;m everybody knows about you</p>
<p>in my world</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m just wondering is there any way</p>
<p>um I can prevent from having another hip</p>
<p>replacement</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re not hurting right I mean no</p>
<p>not at all now</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing I would ride the wave</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s a major surgery and you know</p>
<p>how the recovery is for that so I mean</p>
<p>the fact that you went on keto you</p>
<p>dropped your inflammation</p>
<p>um things can start healing in that area</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s say worst case scenario you can</p>
<p>also even possibly do some stem cell</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some miraculous stuff done with</p>
<p>that if you need it but um I think I</p>
<p>would ride the wave I I&rsquo;ve had patients</p>
<p>come in to see me when I was in practice</p>
<p>bone on bone and yet they&rsquo;re doing fine</p>
<p>so yeah you know if you don&rsquo;t have pain</p>
<p>I think um I I would I think a lot of</p>
<p>people who were in your boat would be</p>
<p>shocked to find out if they just changed</p>
<p>their diet how much inflammation would</p>
<p>go away oh exactly exactly it is it is</p>
<p>phenomenal and my brain function I I</p>
<p>think way better than I&rsquo;ve ever thought</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s so great yeah um and the uh</p>
<p>you can of course support there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of joint formulas out there with um the</p>
<p>chondroitin sulfate and uh glucosamine</p>
<p>you can take those uh as well but um</p>
<p>yeah oh I do I&rsquo;m so glad you said about</p>
<p>the sauerkraut I eat that every day I</p>
<p>love sauerkraut and I grow microgreens</p>
<p>and I sell them because of you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome yeah and on top of that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Alberta which is even more awesome</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been through there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beautiful yeah I went up to see Lake</p>
<p>Banff I think it&rsquo;s called oh bounce yeah</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>okay now listen I just want to show off</p>
<p>her micro green so I shifted again there</p>
<p>they are baking away in the background</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not all of them</p>
<p>wow great job you betcha people love</p>
<p>them I&rsquo;m spreading the word right you</p>
<p>bad you&rsquo;re my you&rsquo;re my hero</p>
<p>yeah thank you I appreciate you thank</p>
<p>you all right thanks so much uh Stacy</p>
<p>you did very well with the questioning</p>
<p>protocol and we&rsquo;re very proud of you for</p>
<p>that so uh let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s move on to</p>
<p>what time is it it&rsquo;s time for Quest quiz</p>
<p>question number two and this drum roll</p>
<p>is what I said is the uh the longest in</p>
<p>history by word count question but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fun one and here you go</p>
<p>okay so definition</p>
<p>of medical misinformation</p>
<p>a false misleading or inaccurate medical</p>
<p>information or B anything that conflicts</p>
<p>with the World Health organiz Foundation</p>
<p>or now it&rsquo;s World Health Organization</p>
<p>not Foundation or General Medical</p>
<p>consensus</p>
<p>um what&rsquo;s the answer what&rsquo;s the true</p>
<p>answer of that All Right audience I know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on it and let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>Katrina from Facebook</p>
<p>which foods and protocols would you</p>
<p>suggest for someone with do patrons he</p>
<p>did phonetically did that for me do pie</p>
<p>Trends uh contracture a condition in</p>
<p>which one or more fingers becomes</p>
<p>permanently bent in a flexed position</p>
<p>ouch</p>
<p>so um there&rsquo;s a couple different</p>
<p>theories of it they don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>exactly why it is</p>
<p>um but I will say that um</p>
<p>I would I would take because we have a</p>
<p>contracture I would take um magnesium</p>
<p>first okay like like uh well you can</p>
<p>take different versions but glycosinate</p>
<p>is a good type of magnesium and I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t also avoid calcium I would</p>
<p>probably take a calcium</p>
<p>uh usually you can get magnesium with</p>
<p>calcium in there and that way you have</p>
<p>the minerals to allow the contraction</p>
<p>relaxation of muscles now the other</p>
<p>point about this contraction is that if</p>
<p>your pH is to on the alkaline side</p>
<p>um that can create these minerals from</p>
<p>working correctly so you may find that</p>
<p>if you acidify the body with either</p>
<p>ongoing apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>and or betaine hydrochloride you can</p>
<p>take it when you eat uh with your for</p>
<p>your digestive system you may find that</p>
<p>um that allows those minerals to work a</p>
<p>lot better as well so it&rsquo;s either a pH</p>
<p>problem I&rsquo;m guessing or a mineral</p>
<p>problem between magnesium and calcium</p>
<p>all right very good so Sean from</p>
<p>Facebook writes bless you dude Canada</p>
<p>loves you I&rsquo;ve lost 80 pounds thanks to</p>
<p>your intermittent fasting videos</p>
<p>exclamation mark and there you go Sean</p>
<p>you get a couple of those that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrific what a great story and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thousands of those I didn&rsquo;t lose 80</p>
<p>pounds but I&rsquo;m down about 45 and never</p>
<p>felt better so that&rsquo;s terrific uh now</p>
<p>the audience is Promised uh has</p>
<p>bared through the entire huge question</p>
<p>number two which asks definition of</p>
<p>medical misinformation fall a false</p>
<p>misleading or interactive in inaccurate</p>
<p>medical information or B anything that</p>
<p>conflicts with the World Health</p>
<p>Organization or General Medical</p>
<p>consensus and uh 50 percent there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>split of a respondents say it&rsquo;s a and</p>
<p>fifty percent say it&rsquo;s B</p>
<p>well according to YouTube it&rsquo;s B</p>
<p>so in other words anything that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>align with World Health Organization or</p>
<p>medical consensus is misinformation and</p>
<p>that would be false information so</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re starting to censor</p>
<p>um anyone who doesn&rsquo;t comply with that</p>
<p>so this is why you may have a hard time</p>
<p>finding my videos so you want to just</p>
<p>type Dr Berg and the topic because they</p>
<p>kind of de-ranked a lot of us especially</p>
<p>even in the ketogenic World</p>
<p>unfortunately so I&rsquo;m going to release a</p>
<p>video on that soon but to me I think</p>
<p>misinformation is incorrect invalid</p>
<p>you know false information I mean that</p>
<p>just would be</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t I mean regardless of how many</p>
<p>times does uh</p>
<p>General Medical consensus have been</p>
<p>wrong right I mean just just recently</p>
<p>um they changed their they flipped their</p>
<p>idea and if you should take</p>
<p>omega-3 before surgery because it could</p>
<p>thin the blood so it&rsquo;s constantly</p>
<p>changing all the time so unfortunately</p>
<p>if you have the opposing Viewpoint</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re not going to be heard</p>
<p>um on YouTube so a lot of people are are</p>
<p>switching to other platforms yeah the</p>
<p>idea that the sort of infallible uh you</p>
<p>know medical community sticks with it Dr</p>
<p>Berg and I both have a great friend uh</p>
<p>MD in Bethesda and he graduated from</p>
<p>Yale as a doctor and he said on his</p>
<p>graduation day the dean said</p>
<p>congratulations you&rsquo;ve gotten the finest</p>
<p>medical education of any place in the</p>
<p>world however half of what we&rsquo;ve taught</p>
<p>you is incorrect and he said your job</p>
<p>over the next 30 years or so is to</p>
<p>figure out which half so isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>um isn&rsquo;t that uh you know it makes you</p>
<p>feel comfortable with all that and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very true things change or so but the</p>
<p>medical community will admit themselves</p>
<p>that they they don&rsquo;t know everything and</p>
<p>things change constantly so I&rsquo;m sorry to</p>
<p>hear that other people are speaking on</p>
<p>behalf of the medical community all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go back to to um</p>
<p>social media</p>
<p>Raquel from YouTube could you share any</p>
<p>remedies for constant throat clearings</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah I think it&rsquo;s um I would the best</p>
<p>remedy for that and this can also cause</p>
<p>laryngeal spasm which will cause a</p>
<p>coughing as well and a clearing of the</p>
<p>throat is to take more calcium</p>
<p>take calcium I would get the calcium</p>
<p>lactate is a good one but you can take</p>
<p>other calcium as well but that just</p>
<p>usually means you need more calcium and</p>
<p>that will usually handle that clearing</p>
<p>now you could also have</p>
<p>acid reflux coming up that could be a</p>
<p>situation in which case you would use</p>
<p>the chain hydrochloride as a remedy so</p>
<p>sometimes you want to differentiate or</p>
<p>you might have like some immune</p>
<p>infection that is that&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re having this post nasal drip</p>
<p>in which case you would want to take</p>
<p>vitamin D zinc and um</p>
<p>also vitamin C</p>
<p>so there you have it</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>very good stand by just push the wrong</p>
<p>button all right back to social media uh</p>
<p>spam Mouse from YouTube great great</p>
<p>fellow which is a more effective way of</p>
<p>getting vitamin C strawberries or bell</p>
<p>peppers</p>
<p>I like bell peppers</p>
<p>because um you have less sugar and less</p>
<p>fructose</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>if you have a garden boy you should just</p>
<p>grow those bell peppers oh I just</p>
<p>recently had one of my bell peppers what</p>
<p>a difference between a garden bell</p>
<p>pepper and the store-bought I mean just</p>
<p>night and day I when I buy these bell</p>
<p>peppers in the store I&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to them say it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>eating a tomato at the store so I</p>
<p>encourage you to either buy them at the</p>
<p>farmer&rsquo;s market or grow your own</p>
<p>um I am going to be starting a channel</p>
<p>on growing</p>
<p>very soon I know I&rsquo;ve been saying that</p>
<p>for some time but</p>
<p>we finally are working on our Greenhouse</p>
<p>um in West Virginia so we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>actually film a lot of things related to</p>
<p>that I think it&rsquo;s going to be pretty</p>
<p>pretty exciting because we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do a lot of research and then share what</p>
<p>we found in that area which will</p>
<p>help a lot of people who are trying to</p>
<p>just decide what the best how to what</p>
<p>how to create the best soil and all the</p>
<p>other factors that contribute to uh</p>
<p>healthy food that is excited we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>waiting for that Dr Berg so it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>great news to hear that it&rsquo;s underway</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s put up the uh third quiz</p>
<p>question for the day then we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>go over to our green room and here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>true falser for today</p>
<p>all right true or false the average</p>
<p>amount of added sugar a person in the</p>
<p>U.S consumes daily is 26 teaspoons</p>
<p>sounds like a lot is that true or false</p>
<p>audience okay let&rsquo;s uh we&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>over to Victoria who&rsquo;s from Toronto</p>
<p>another area that you&rsquo;re familiar with a</p>
<p>doc and here she is with her one</p>
<p>question 30 seconds</p>
<p>hi Dr Burke how are you great thanks</p>
<p>good good I love all of the videos that</p>
<p>you post honestly you&rsquo;ve helped myself</p>
<p>my husband my mother so thank you thank</p>
<p>you for all the information that you</p>
<p>post so I wanted to ask a really quick</p>
<p>two questions if I may I promise I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get it within 30 seconds so</p>
<p>I have been suffering from endometriosis</p>
<p>now for about 20 years it&rsquo;s a horrible</p>
<p>problem in my life I have two questions</p>
<p>about endometriosis and a healthy keto</p>
<p>diet with if first on which days of my</p>
<p>25 day cycle should I follow the healthy</p>
<p>keto diet for example like any specific</p>
<p>foods that I should avoid during my</p>
<p>cycle and then second is regarding your</p>
<p>videos regarding um endometriosis and</p>
<p>Pain Relief is there a recommended</p>
<p>amount of stinging nettle root think</p>
<p>sure maybe if possible that I should</p>
<p>take and I want to make sure that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take too much thank you</p>
<p>yes so this the cool thing about singing</p>
<p>ever</p>
<p>is it helps to regulate estrogen as well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an enzyme called aromatase which</p>
<p>it inhibits so that can actually help a</p>
<p>lot and I would take I would adjust I</p>
<p>would take some right and then I would</p>
<p>keep increasing it until</p>
<p>you feel better and it might be</p>
<p>five times the normal amount that you</p>
<p>would normally take during when you need</p>
<p>it as far as the foods to avoid uh with</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>unfortunately Dairy is a top of the list</p>
<p>because the dairy tends to affect</p>
<p>estrogen more than any other thing</p>
<p>um a key Trace mineral that you should</p>
<p>be focusing on right now is iodine and</p>
<p>sea kelp is a good source but iodine is</p>
<p>one of those wonderful things that can</p>
<p>actually help balance this estrogen</p>
<p>problem and reduce the formation even of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>endometriosis</p>
<p>um there is some additional data</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that um I recently stumbled on that you</p>
<p>could probably</p>
<p>do further research on something called</p>
<p>NATO kinase</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an enzyme to help dissolve fibrous</p>
<p>tissue and that&rsquo;s what endometriosis is</p>
<p>so you might want to see if there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>connection between NATO kinase</p>
<p>and fiber and endometriosis you might</p>
<p>find something there</p>
<p>thank you thank you is the seek help</p>
<p>because I ordered all of your</p>
<p>supplements by the way so your sea kelp</p>
<p>does it have iodine because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember oh yeah yeah in the right</p>
<p>amounts so yeah you&rsquo;re good on that for</p>
<p>sure</p>
<p>perfect thank you you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>great question thank you so much</p>
<p>Victoria and can&rsquo;t wait to hear uh you</p>
<p>know fair weather times for you in the</p>
<p>future with uh with your continued</p>
<p>pursuit of getting some relief from that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>irritating and</p>
<p>troubling disease if that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called okay let&rsquo;s um go and ask a</p>
<p>question from Lou from YouTube I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>suffering from migraines I suspect it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from high histamine levels because of my</p>
<p>Eczema and insomnia what&rsquo;s the best way</p>
<p>to lower histamine levels doc do you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s part of his problem</p>
<p>quercetin is is one remedy and a lot</p>
<p>more vitamin C</p>
<p>can help reduce systemine levels too and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also you might want to do a</p>
<p>search on high histamine foods and start</p>
<p>avoiding those as well and there&rsquo;s quite</p>
<p>a list on that but the the biggest thing</p>
<p>is the quercetin is a good remedy for</p>
<p>that and and higher amounts</p>
<p>so try that onions actually are loaded</p>
<p>with with quercetin and so start eating</p>
<p>a lot of onions as well very good good</p>
<p>luck with that okay quiz question number</p>
<p>three was a true falser and it asked</p>
<p>true false the average amount of added</p>
<p>sugar a person U.S consumes daily is 26</p>
<p>teaspoons that&rsquo;s a pile I believe and</p>
<p>um 72 percent of a respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true and 28 say that&rsquo;s just impossible</p>
<p>no way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;s true now that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even count for the amount of sugar</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the other carbohydrates like</p>
<p>all the breads pasta cereal crackers</p>
<p>that type of thing so you have to</p>
<p>realize that an average American</p>
<p>I mean who&rsquo;s average just there&rsquo;s quite</p>
<p>a few people that are eating way more</p>
<p>than that and there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>eating a lot less than that including</p>
<p>myself so right in the middle though</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of sugar right so</p>
<p>unfortunately it that&rsquo;s going to create</p>
<p>something called hyperglycemia</p>
<p>now this is interesting if you look at a</p>
<p>trusted source of medical to learn about</p>
<p>hypoglycemic hyperglycemia from of</p>
<p>course Wikipedia we know they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>most trusted Source if you look down to</p>
<p>the cause of that</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t even mention dietary sugar at</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>I wonder how that got omitted I mean</p>
<p>that just blew my mind so you know it</p>
<p>could come from glandular endocrine</p>
<p>problems or diabetes or or infection or</p>
<p>excess eating but no one they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mention this excess sugar in the diet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like the elephant in the</p>
<p>room and um</p>
<p>apparently that&rsquo;s an omission yeah okay</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s evidence of someone that</p>
<p>probably doesn&rsquo;t do that anymore Jack</p>
<p>from Facebook I&rsquo;ve lost 50 pounds on</p>
<p>healthy keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>thank you Dr Berg with several</p>
<p>exclamation marks so good for you Jack</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tremendous uh achievement and I</p>
<p>know you feel terrific</p>
<p>so and there&rsquo;s lots of those again</p>
<p>audience we could spend uh most part of</p>
<p>the show</p>
<p>recanting people&rsquo;s uh pleasure from</p>
<p>feeling better and being healthier but</p>
<p>we want to stick with your questions as</p>
<p>the Paramount thing so we can get you</p>
<p>feeling healthier and better let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>how about</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Rebecca from Facebook what would you</p>
<p>take to alleviate shaky hands and what</p>
<p>do you recommend to address varicose</p>
<p>veins</p>
<p>well I mean</p>
<p>there are people that have a dopamine</p>
<p>deficiency and Parkinson Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s that shake their hands a lot</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s more rare so I wouldn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>in that direction I will say that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some interesting data about a</p>
<p>vitamin B1 deficiency and that affecting</p>
<p>part of the brain that controls this</p>
<p>involuntary movement so I might I would</p>
<p>recommend taking an uh natural source of</p>
<p>B1 but take larger amounts that might</p>
<p>help the shaking with the varicose veins</p>
<p>I would go right to that whole lemon</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s loaded with the bioflavonoids</p>
<p>that can help support this uh</p>
<p>the vein collagen</p>
<p>outer part of that vein and artery and</p>
<p>that would help your circulation as well</p>
<p>um also realize that if you have</p>
<p>estrogen dominance that can also cause</p>
<p>increase in varicose veins and spider</p>
<p>veins so you might want to deal with</p>
<p>that as well with iodine or the</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables which help</p>
<p>balance out that excess estrogen</p>
<p>okay I think this is an interesting</p>
<p>question Boyka from Facebook is it okay</p>
<p>to consume colostrum during intermittent</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>um good question I think it&rsquo;s okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not not too much of a dose and there is</p>
<p>some small amount of calories in there</p>
<p>if you can find colostrum from a sheep</p>
<p>or a goat versus a cow you might</p>
<p>it might work a little bit better but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying the cows won&rsquo;t work but I</p>
<p>know some people there have</p>
<p>sensitivities to casein</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and even lactose which could be in that</p>
<p>colostrum but colostrum has like all</p>
<p>these amazing immune factors and</p>
<p>if we just talk about clostrum we talk</p>
<p>talk about breast milk which is the the</p>
<p>most amazing Liquid Gold nutrition that</p>
<p>a human a baby could consume and</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the baby infant formulas the companies</p>
<p>are really discouraging in indirect ways</p>
<p>women breastfeeding and I think</p>
<p>if you take a look at some of these</p>
<p>infant formulas they&rsquo;re like at the</p>
<p>epitome of ultra process</p>
<p>junk food I mean look at the ingredients</p>
<p>in this stuff I would not want to give</p>
<p>that to an infant um if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>breastfeed there&rsquo;s something called a</p>
<p>little late shade League you could get</p>
<p>some donations from breast milk but the</p>
<p>colostrum is really important for the</p>
<p>immune system and uh even if you have</p>
<p>like a if you had to take a lot of</p>
<p>steroids or and you damage your immune</p>
<p>system colostrum is one way to kind of</p>
<p>help recover it so I talked about that</p>
<p>in a video so can you describe for the</p>
<p>audience what colostrum is is it</p>
<p>different from breast milk in itself</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s produced in the</p>
<p>first</p>
<p>time first few times that you you give</p>
<p>milk when you&rsquo;re breastfeeding they</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a colostrum that&rsquo;s released and</p>
<p>that has a tremendous amount of immune</p>
<p>building properties</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called the part of the innate</p>
<p>immune system not something not the</p>
<p>other system that you acquire</p>
<p>from being infected but something that</p>
<p>the mother gives you and the other thing</p>
<p>in breast milk and I don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>colostrum is you have a lot of</p>
<p>probiotics as well from the mother to</p>
<p>the infant uh so you get a lot of great</p>
<p>things from colostrum but mainly immune</p>
<p>factors that</p>
<p>um are in the first part of that that</p>
<p>cycle of breastfeeding okay very good</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um Kelly from YouTube I need your help</p>
<p>to quit smoking that&rsquo;s a rotten thing</p>
<p>please share your suggestions</p>
<p>I think um smoking tends to help people</p>
<p>reduce stress they drink they they smoke</p>
<p>to relax reduce stress so if you were to</p>
<p>take um some type of natural combination</p>
<p>of things like let&rsquo;s say ashwagandha</p>
<p>natural vitamin B1 and lemon balm tea</p>
<p>and you just started adding that as a</p>
<p>replacement that might help you and if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really bad maybe you need to add</p>
<p>like a whole desiccated adrenal</p>
<p>supplement with that but there&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be a couple weeks of withdrawals and</p>
<p>um difficulty coming off cigarettes but</p>
<p>are nicotine but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s uh definitely</p>
<p>all that all the chemicals and the</p>
<p>actual smoke and the carbon monoxide the</p>
<p>Arsenic all that stuff</p>
<p>ends up right through your lung into</p>
<p>your bloodstream into the arteries and</p>
<p>it messes with your arteries and it</p>
<p>creates</p>
<p>problems that you don&rsquo;t want so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it also kind of increases your risk for</p>
<p>cancer and other issues too so it&rsquo;s best</p>
<p>that you take this and and substitute</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that stress relief with other things</p>
<p>that can reduce stress keep yourself</p>
<p>really busy as well yeah Kelly I tell</p>
<p>you and all those people in the audience</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s Millions still that are</p>
<p>smoking that was one of the most</p>
<p>difficult but rewarding things that I</p>
<p>ever did I quit about 35 years ago and</p>
<p>when I asked a few people nervously</p>
<p>while I was you know 15 minutes into</p>
<p>quitting smoking you know how do you do</p>
<p>it and many people would say well you</p>
<p>know you have the physical part for</p>
<p>three days and then the emotional part</p>
<p>for five days and then you&rsquo;re fine and I</p>
<p>thought that doesn&rsquo;t sound right and I</p>
<p>finally talked to one guy and he said</p>
<p>look just forget about the calendar he</p>
<p>goes it&rsquo;s going to suck for a while but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s well worth it so just don&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>day by day just just keeps you know</p>
<p>stating it&rsquo;s okay to want a cigarette</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s okay not to smoke one and and</p>
<p>just keep with that and I&rsquo;m so glad I</p>
<p>did but that is an insane addiction I</p>
<p>mean I it&rsquo;s hard to describe people that</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been but it is just bugs you</p>
<p>every second and so I&rsquo;m so April I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>free of that and Kelly you can be too so</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you check back in with us and</p>
<p>one last thing I bought a bicycle for</p>
<p>the first time in my life right when I</p>
<p>quit smoking because I said I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I can smoke a cigarette while I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>riding and then every time I thought</p>
<p>well why don&rsquo;t you start smoking again</p>
<p>okay good I&rsquo;ll just bend of the bicycle</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be needing that anymore and that</p>
<p>and that little routine kept me off long</p>
<p>enough uh and I still enjoy riding bikes</p>
<p>so good for you Kelly keep it up</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see um Lynn from</p>
<p>Facebook what would you recommend for</p>
<p>someone diagnosed with uh s jagran</p>
<p>syndrome a long-term autoimmune disease</p>
<p>that affects the body&rsquo;s moisture</p>
<p>producing glands that&rsquo;s interesting you</p>
<p>heard of that yeah oh okay um</p>
<p>vitamin D in high quantities anything</p>
<p>with autoimmune you want to take vitamin</p>
<p>D and I&rsquo;m talking like maybe 40 to 50</p>
<p>000 IUS per day that would be a good</p>
<p>thing to take</p>
<p>there is some other types of</p>
<p>remedies to help lubricate the eyes in</p>
<p>the meantime and you can get those</p>
<p>online they&rsquo;re natural remedies but yeah</p>
<p>this uh the tear glands and</p>
<p>start drying up and you have all sorts</p>
<p>of issues with even your connective</p>
<p>tissue and your skin so high levels of</p>
<p>vitamin D tend to act as like a natural</p>
<p>steroid without the side effect</p>
<p>um you know we think about vitamin D as</p>
<p>a vitamin but really it&rsquo;s a hormone and</p>
<p>it has very similar functions to</p>
<p>cortisol</p>
<p>but it does it&rsquo;s like an</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory and it helps your</p>
<p>immune system</p>
<p>but cortisol suppresses the immune</p>
<p>system vitamin D regulates or moderates</p>
<p>the immune system so it won&rsquo;t it&rsquo;ll turn</p>
<p>off like a cytokine storm but it will</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll not shut it down like cortisol</p>
<p>will</p>
<p>interesting okay I&rsquo;m going to use the</p>
<p>same routine we did a few minutes ago</p>
<p>and that is to ask a question and then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to go to our final Green</p>
<p>Room participant Joy so Joy stand by for</p>
<p>a minute and here&rsquo;s quiz question number</p>
<p>four</p>
<p>all right most of your vitamin E is</p>
<p>stored in which body organ</p>
<p>all right well Joyce boom we replaced</p>
<p>the question and bring you up uh one</p>
<p>question please in 30 seconds</p>
<p>good morning uh Dr Berg thank you for</p>
<p>all the information that you share with</p>
<p>everybody I love your program</p>
<p>um the question I have today is about my</p>
<p>husband about a year ago he was</p>
<p>diagnosed with slow AFib so only when</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s relaxed as he go into uh afib</p>
<p>um he also he takes meds for high blood</p>
<p>pressure</p>
<p>he has psoriatic arthritis which he no</p>
<p>longer takes</p>
<p>biologics for because keto and if has</p>
<p>helped that tremendously and my question</p>
<p>is what can we do well actually he had a</p>
<p>cardioversion too I forgot that in March</p>
<p>he had a cardioversion which lasted</p>
<p>three days</p>
<p>what else can we do to help this</p>
<p>situation</p>
<p>the doctors are saying you know blood</p>
<p>thinners for the rest of your life we</p>
<p>live a very active lifestyle and um</p>
<p>you know he exercises and it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>little unsettling</p>
<p>so yeah just so you know like I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to give you areas of research</p>
<p>because of course I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to cure anything but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s some things to look at uh number</p>
<p>one you said he was he he is or he was</p>
<p>an athlete at one time right yeah did he</p>
<p>did he do uh biking</p>
<p>no not so much she played lacrosse</p>
<p>running surfing</p>
<p>yeah we used to be big Runners but not</p>
<p>so much anymore because um because one</p>
<p>of the things that can happen if someone</p>
<p>was an athlete is their heart uh becomes</p>
<p>stronger and bigger</p>
<p>and when the heart becomes bigger it</p>
<p>does alter the Pacemakers you have four</p>
<p>of them and that that can that can</p>
<p>create a um arrhythmia just from the</p>
<p>heart being bigger so that&rsquo;s just one as</p>
<p>a side note because I did a lot of</p>
<p>biking and I started having arrhythmias</p>
<p>and I was like what is going on</p>
<p>um so there&rsquo;s a couple other things and</p>
<p>of course the the elephant in the room</p>
<p>is is electrolytes</p>
<p>um definitely the Magnesium of potassium</p>
<p>and larger amounts over a longer period</p>
<p>of time will be necessary to really</p>
<p>build up the body I think a really good</p>
<p>test if you could find do a search on</p>
<p>the internet uh it&rsquo;s called interests</p>
<p>called intracellular magnesium test</p>
<p>so you want to check not in your blood</p>
<p>but inside the cells and you you send</p>
<p>you a kit and you take a little scrape</p>
<p>of the inside of your your oh and you</p>
<p>send it in it&rsquo;ll tell you where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>intracellular potassium is I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>magnesium I think they might check</p>
<p>potassium too but that would be a really</p>
<p>good test to see what&rsquo;s going on with</p>
<p>that mineral because</p>
<p>I know the electrolytes are involved in</p>
<p>arrhythmias problems you also have um</p>
<p>electromagnetic fields from cell phones</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>like I found</p>
<p>um if you get a tester I don&rsquo;t think I</p>
<p>have mine here but the tri-failed</p>
<p>uh EMF tester go around your house and</p>
<p>uh I found not only my computer but</p>
<p>right in the head of my wall where I</p>
<p>sleep was radiating magnetic fields</p>
<p>eight feet off the wall so every time</p>
<p>you went to sleep I was bathing in this</p>
<p>electromagnetic field I had an</p>
<p>electrician open the wall redo and</p>
<p>looking in there they found all these</p>
<p>cross wires and all these problems</p>
<p>electrically that they fixed all that</p>
<p>and my rhythmias went away that was my</p>
<p>the cause of mine</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so you have that and then um</p>
<p>the other things with the arrhythmias if</p>
<p>you take a look at if the body is too</p>
<p>ass or too alkaline you can have</p>
<p>arrhythmias on both Spectrum so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just something else to look at in</p>
<p>relationship to arrhythmias</p>
<p>worst case scenario if he has to take a</p>
<p>blood thinner I would I would try to</p>
<p>find one that is</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t restrict his ability to consume</p>
<p>dark leafy green</p>
<p>vitamin K Rich vegetables I know they</p>
<p>have them out there</p>
<p>because the coumatin doesn&rsquo;t allow you</p>
<p>to do that so that restricts certain</p>
<p>things so right</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if the one that he&rsquo;s on he</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can say the name of it</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s Xarelto if that restricts I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t remember the doctor saying that</p>
<p>you you couldn&rsquo;t have Greek leafy greens</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure but okay something to look</p>
<p>at but um those are the things that I</p>
<p>would recommend and uh</p>
<p>um hopefully one of those will will help</p>
<p>him</p>
<p>thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great Joyce um you know keep us</p>
<p>posted on your husband&rsquo;s progress we</p>
<p>hope so</p>
<p>get back to the bicycle or whatever I</p>
<p>guess he didn&rsquo;t do that get back to his</p>
<p>active life that would be terrific okay</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see um we did get answers in</p>
<p>the interim while Joyce was giving us</p>
<p>her husband&rsquo;s condition and the question</p>
<p>asks most of your vitamin E is stored in</p>
<p>which body organ and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>55 percent of the respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the skin 35 say it&rsquo;s the liver and 10</p>
<p>say It&rsquo;s stuck in the brain</p>
<p>okay the answer is</p>
<p>adipose tissue it&rsquo;s your fat</p>
<p>your fat is an organ that produces</p>
<p>hormones but your fat stores the</p>
<p>majority of your vitamin E but not just</p>
<p>vitamin E</p>
<p>vitamin A vitamin D</p>
<p>um and vitamin K and so when you lose</p>
<p>weight when you do a fast for example</p>
<p>um you have to realize you&rsquo;re releasing</p>
<p>some of these fat soluble vitamins into</p>
<p>circulation and this allows you to um</p>
<p>not be deficient</p>
<p>so think about an overweight person that</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t tap into fat</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t tap into some of these fat</p>
<p>soluble vitamins as well</p>
<p>um but what&rsquo;s interesting about this is</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>when you consume water-soluble vitamins</p>
<p>like the B vitamins and vitamin C</p>
<p>um the question is</p>
<p>how long are these water soluble</p>
<p>vitamins stored in the body</p>
<p>and for that question I should probably</p>
<p>ask that next weekend or next week</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a really good question with</p>
<p>a very interesting answer interesting</p>
<p>well we can&rsquo;t wait for that and speaking</p>
<p>of questions Here&rsquo;s the final one for</p>
<p>this show</p>
<p>okay what is the advantage of consuming</p>
<p>fermented foods over just fiber-rich</p>
<p>Foods</p>
<p>climb on it audience okay Anila from</p>
<p>Facebook the root cause of most disease</p>
<p>is inflammation what steps should we</p>
<p>follow every day to change that</p>
<p>condition</p>
<p>I think inflammation is is is not the</p>
<p>root cause it&rsquo;s the tip of the iceberg</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something deeper what&rsquo;s causing</p>
<p>the inflammation you got to pull the</p>
<p>string deeper and that&rsquo;s usually related</p>
<p>to this thing called diet so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that a person&rsquo;s eating that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating the inflammation the most</p>
<p>likely reason is the</p>
<p>sugar in refined carbs refined sugars</p>
<p>and refined carbs then we get the</p>
<p>omega-6 fatty acid type oils the seed</p>
<p>oils</p>
<p>um so we&rsquo;re talking about Ultra</p>
<p>processed foods when you go into a</p>
<p>grocery store</p>
<p>did you realize that 6 83 percent</p>
<p>of all the calories in a grocery store</p>
<p>is ultra processed foods foods that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even resemble the original food</p>
<p>so you have the situation where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to find food you have to go to</p>
<p>the perimeter and try to find food</p>
<p>because everything else is processed so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my opinion that all the the inside</p>
<p>of those the aisles that you go down are</p>
<p>just filled with inflammatory foods now</p>
<p>of course stress can create inflammation</p>
<p>and smoking and drinking and all that</p>
<p>but it really boils down to your Foods</p>
<p>um you can have like myself my genes</p>
<p>um are are such that I&rsquo;m my weak link is</p>
<p>inflammation so if I over train or don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat right I will get way more</p>
<p>inflammation than an average person so I</p>
<p>have to constantly regulate that so</p>
<p>there you have it that&rsquo;s my long-winded</p>
<p>answer all right well that was a great</p>
<p>answer Michelle from YouTube because of</p>
<p>my</p>
<p>dinner oh gosh</p>
<p>aidenomyces I cannot consume lemons what</p>
<p>alternatives think go ahead pronounce</p>
<p>that for me or is that enough Aiden o</p>
<p>mices</p>
<p>adenomiasis I think I said it right does</p>
<p>that ring a bell</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m probably saying it wrong</p>
<p>I thought you&rsquo;re going to give me some</p>
<p>easy questions you know I started</p>
<p>because I like the word Michelle I</p>
<p>yeah when I when I read the question it</p>
<p>started with Michelle and I said I can</p>
<p>pronounce that but as I got deeper into</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>you know for that it&rsquo;s kind of like uh</p>
<p>if I have too much of uh cyclopentanyl</p>
<p>propane hydrofen and threes is that</p>
<p>going to cause uh a redness in my well</p>
<p>good well I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re perplexed too</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not your fault doc</p>
<p>again I probably was probably pronounced</p>
<p>totally differently but let&rsquo;s move on</p>
<p>from that and uh we&rsquo;ll Michelle we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>try to do some research and figure out</p>
<p>what that is all about uh let&rsquo;s see uh</p>
<p>Joanne from Facebook I was told not to</p>
<p>take ashwagandha if you have an</p>
<p>autoimmune disease what are your</p>
<p>thoughts on that</p>
<p>you know I disagree I disagree I think</p>
<p>ashwagandha is is still good with</p>
<p>autoimmune it&rsquo;s a fascinating herb from</p>
<p>India that has the ability to increase</p>
<p>the adaptation of stress</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a great great uh little</p>
<p>device that I&rsquo;m about to</p>
<p>finally get around to</p>
<p>organizing today I&rsquo;m going to work on</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um so people can have access to this</p>
<p>very inexpensive little device that you</p>
<p>can measure your own autonomic nervous</p>
<p>system and you can really see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with your</p>
<p>ability to</p>
<p>fight stress and your capacity to handle</p>
<p>stress and your</p>
<p>flight or fight mechanism and your</p>
<p>parasympathetic nervous system so you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be able to measure all that and really</p>
<p>find out what&rsquo;s going on inside and then</p>
<p>you can use it to do your own research</p>
<p>on your own body won&rsquo;t that be cool</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exciting that is exciting yeah</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s talk uh briefly about other</p>
<p>ways for the audience to be able to get</p>
<p>your information and that&rsquo;s the free app</p>
<p>for both Android and iOS or iPhone as</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s known and doc I think those are all</p>
<p>still fed from the same well though</p>
<p>right don&rsquo;t they link to your YouTube</p>
<p>videos</p>
<p>yeah you know um you&rsquo;re not going to be</p>
<p>able to find a lot of information on</p>
<p>YouTube like you did before on me so the</p>
<p>best way to go is on my website</p>
<p>drbird.com because that way we have it</p>
<p>classified and easy to find you can do</p>
<p>searches and you can find all the</p>
<p>information right there</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s the best way to do it and</p>
<p>also sign up for my newsletter on my</p>
<p>website because if anything ever happens</p>
<p>in the future where you can&rsquo;t find me</p>
<p>that way you&rsquo;re on my list and I can</p>
<p>make sure you get all the information</p>
<p>you need</p>
<p>um and you can have access to it because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly sending</p>
<p>um anyone on my list</p>
<p>um great data that sometimes you know</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really see on these other</p>
<p>platforms</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great so it would it be just go</p>
<p>to the website and there&rsquo;s a way to sign</p>
<p>up is that the way so doctorberg.com</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several places that you can sign</p>
<p>up they&rsquo;re opt-in forms so you can sign</p>
<p>up and get in my mailing list or my</p>
<p>email list that I I send out a few times</p>
<p>a week great let&rsquo;s take that seriously</p>
<p>audience we want to be able to stay</p>
<p>connected with Dr Berg uh in any event</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see uh our final question for</p>
<p>the day and audience thank you for</p>
<p>helping us get through them all asked</p>
<p>what is the advantage of consuming</p>
<p>fermented foods over just good old</p>
<p>fiber-rich Foods</p>
<p>88 of our respondents say fermented</p>
<p>foods boost the gut function and 12 say</p>
<p>they are good for digestion and boosting</p>
<p>immunity kind of sounds the same</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re everyone&rsquo;s correct they give you</p>
<p>probiotics and and many of these</p>
<p>fermented vegetables have fiber</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s other things that donate</p>
<p>fiber like the fermented milk and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in Kiefer</p>
<p>sometimes yogurt but</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>the benefits of putting that those</p>
<p>micros back in your gut</p>
<p>um I mean I don&rsquo;t know anyone who has</p>
<p>never taken an antibiotic before</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been looking at the research on</p>
<p>antibiotics</p>
<p>your gut doesn&rsquo;t ever come back to where</p>
<p>it should there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s changes that</p>
<p>occur that sometimes take</p>
<p>six months to restore and even at that</p>
<p>point they never come back to normal so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always a weak link and then if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like me who has taken a lot of</p>
<p>antibiotics in your life boy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be like an issue and you might</p>
<p>have some</p>
<p>inflammation deep in your gut that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know about on top of all the food</p>
<p>and things that create inflammation so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really important on a regular basis</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>keep those probiotics in your gut and</p>
<p>fermented foods are the best way</p>
<p>especially the sauerkraut the kimchi and</p>
<p>the kefir which I like kefir</p>
<p>very important I&rsquo;m going to release</p>
<p>another updated video on how to use</p>
<p>kefir</p>
<p>um more at night or maybe at your last</p>
<p>meal to help you sleep</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s amazing these these microbes</p>
<p>really help us in so many different ways</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t understand the</p>
<p>significance of that you can end up</p>
<p>wiping them out or</p>
<p>killing them and end up having</p>
<p>deficiencies at the microbes and then</p>
<p>then you get all the pathogens</p>
<p>and other issues that come along with</p>
<p>that the side effect from antibiotics</p>
<p>huh well we don&rsquo;t want to do that Maria</p>
<p>from Facebook is the healthy keto okay</p>
<p>for someone with hereditary high</p>
<p>cholesterol levels</p>
<p>it is um but maybe what you do is you</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t add the extra fat you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>add the extra MCT oil or the the keto</p>
<p>bomb fat cookies you know maybe you just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that but but having the the fat</p>
<p>that normally comes with the meat uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be fine you can also do</p>
<p>many things to help if you have a</p>
<p>cholesterol problem that&rsquo;s related to</p>
<p>your genes you could you can add vitamin</p>
<p>B3 which is awesome uh you can also add</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>NATO kinase which is another one</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s I have a list of a lot of</p>
<p>different ones that work really good to</p>
<p>help regulate cholesterol and prevent</p>
<p>problems in your arteries</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that um have less side effects than</p>
<p>things like statins</p>
<p>all right very good well we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>close here let me see if I can find it</p>
<p>fresh</p>
<p>question uh Terry is teaching me about</p>
<p>pronunciation still sorry to be on that</p>
<p>theme so much but it seems to have come</p>
<p>into a question this time so let me look</p>
<p>back here</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>vitamin C we did that</p>
<p>the Adoration of Dr Berg we&rsquo;ve gone by</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>uh Dr Byrne for the first time ever I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m coming up empty on questions</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see can we finally answered all</p>
<p>the questions that people wanted to know</p>
<p>about and they just ran out of questions</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right I was waiting till I</p>
<p>ended up at this point where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely nothing else to talk about</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>all the questions are answered you know</p>
<p>that is a thorough show I will see</p>
<p>everyone next week same time same place</p>
<p>have a wonderful weekend and stay tuned</p>
<p>for great videos</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
