<p>into little</p>
<p>plastic pillowy things for people to fuck</p>

<p>flash flashlight whatever you call it isn&rsquo;t it kind of</p>
<p>creepier that</p>
<p>it actually does look like a vagina like if it was</p>
<p>green or something like that</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;d be easier to fuck</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have to think</p>
<p>about it being a serial killer sort of a thing</p>
<p>so that really</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look like anything</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t but the vagina one does</p>
<p>like the 4th grader made that you just</p>
<p>as a good father be like oh yeah yeah I can see that</p>
<p>totally does you have a lot of talent</p>
<p>you encourage them</p>
<p>we were saying yesterday that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny that they sell the butthole version and the</p>
<p>vagina version and what if the butthole version just</p>
<p>so outsold the vagina version they just</p>
<p>canceled making them because nobody wanted to fuck to</p>
<p>river vagina</p>
<p>like left handed guitars</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like 10</p>
<p>extra for the vagina</p>
<p>Joe next time you fuck I try</p>
<p>taking it out like fish in the bucket</p>
<p>and fucking it out of the plastic thing</p>
<p>yeah like your hand really it&rsquo;s so much better</p>
<p>really Brian has a tip a health</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like the Martha Stewart of fake vaginas</p>

<p>no I don&rsquo;t review sex toys only</p>
<p>technology shit I</p>
<p>should I should review</p>
<p>sex toys why not dude</p>
<p>you should totally do a full</p>
<p>you fuck it version</p>
<p>of a review</p>
<p>where you fuck</p>
<p>the flashlight I</p>
<p>should take the food blog to the next</p>
<p>show and show us</p>
<p>like show us you fucking it but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want we don&rsquo;t have to see your dick and anything but we</p>
<p>should know that you really are fucking it like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>naked no no you</p>
<p>take a picture</p>
<p>right after you&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll try to get</p>
<p>the level of</p>
<p>satisfaction</p>
<p>just fill my face the whole time</p>
<p>using it but that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>is there a fucking</p>
<p>thing on this</p>
<p>earth that&rsquo;s more disgusting than another dude&rsquo;s loads</p>
<p>if you think about it</p>
<p>if you had a choice between the guy pissing on you or</p>
<p>shooting a load on you well obviously it&rsquo;s no brainer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s longer</p>
<p>would get over</p>
<p>and you have a washcloth</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>right and a</p>
<p>stand up shower</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s over really</p>
<p>quickly wow</p>
<p>that might be better you know</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s just a pool you just a</p>
<p>load might be better</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s right it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quicker it&rsquo;s just like get it done wipe it</p>
<p>off you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>like sitting there for 2 minutes getting pissed on I</p>
<p>see what you&rsquo;re saying you get a</p>
<p>laugh at the guys faces he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I see what he&rsquo;s saying but to me it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>dude just shot a load on me and I can&rsquo;t deal with it I</p>
<p>could deal with a dude pissing on me that&rsquo;s an act of</p>
<p>aggression a guy</p>
<p>shooting a load on me is like that guy</p>
<p>basically just fucked me</p>
<p>yeah you know I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>it just snot from below</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>yeah but it&rsquo;s sort of a</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>was just an accident a Mark he&rsquo;s marking me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an accident you gotta</p>
<p>stop being so judgmental</p>
<p>but peeing is how you usually</p>
<p>market animals usually use</p>
<p>PETA marks that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s like I said that&rsquo;s an active</p>
<p>aggression an active</p>
<p>aggression like</p>
<p>urinating on me</p>
<p>would not offend me nearly as much as</p>
<p>dropping a load on me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just me though</p>
<p>I agree with</p>
<p>that honestly</p>
<p>things that I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think of what if it was a long beer piss</p>
<p>though you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>asparagus piss yeah 4 hours</p>
<p>sitting in Yankee Stadium</p>
<p>right drinking beer in the hot sun</p>
<p>are you a sports female</p>
<p>sports fan no</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t the only</p>
<p>sport I watch besides</p>
<p>mixed martial arts and boxing is pool</p>
<p>I watch professional pool</p>
<p>which is completely ridiculous</p>
<p>actually I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching the NBA finals</p>
<p>and I have to have the game on mute</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m convinced the announcers hate my team</p>
<p>and it just</p>
<p>gets insane</p>
<p>dude people get so fucking mad if they feel</p>
<p>like someone&rsquo;s doing bias commentary I get so much shit</p>
<p>from due to or</p>
<p>angry at me because I call the</p>
<p>fight as I see</p>
<p>it you know I try to be as objective as possible</p>
<p>and have like</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s my favorite I don&rsquo;t want anybody in</p>
<p>particular to win I just wanted to happen</p>
<p>I have a bunch of guys that I love</p>
<p>watching when they</p>
<p>fight because they&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t I try to</p>
<p>never like root for somebody</p>
<p>right so I do my best to stay objective</p>
<p>but I call like I fucking see it some dudes get</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so emotionally invested like me with the</p>
<p>Celtics I want them to win</p>
<p>and like you</p>
<p>know like I&rsquo;ve got invited to a come on down</p>
<p>watch watch game</p>
<p>7 it&rsquo;s like I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t fucking deal with all</p>
<p>these I&rsquo;m gonna sit there by myself and I have to</p>
<p>watch it on</p>
<p>mute I can&rsquo;t be around a</p>
<p>bunch of other people</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be people there</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>or they gonna be rooting for another team</p>
<p>and I will literally have rage</p>
<p>me and no I&rsquo;ve really been examining it like</p>
<p>what was silly</p>
<p>it is I heard</p>
<p>somebody told me that I</p>
<p>think Jay Leno said</p>
<p>was I wasn&rsquo;t into</p>
<p>sports and he was just like</p>
<p>bait why do I care if</p>
<p>the peanuts</p>
<p>beat the kangaroos and you know something like that</p>
<p>and it just</p>
<p>really sort of was like yeah why do I give a shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a trick</p>
<p>people think that the NBA</p>
<p>finals are rigged</p>
<p>like that kardashians</p>
<p>going on TMZ</p>
<p>saying the whole</p>
<p>thing&rsquo;s rigged who is</p>
<p>going on Kim Kardashian</p>
<p>Robert Kardashian</p>
<p>Robert Carne</p>
<p>I think is the brother of Kim and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>going on saying like you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible source that family</p>
<p>I mean one of</p>
<p>one of the guys is a</p>
<p>Are they gonna re examine the Warren</p>
<p>Commission next</p>
<p>take another peek at the Sapruder film</p>
<p>yeah come on really yeah</p>
<p>but the thing</p>
<p>the Kardashians looked into the moon landing</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t somebody off that in the</p>
<p>Kardashians</p>
<p>married to an NBA player though</p>
<p>there were yeah that is true and the</p>
<p>NBA also had a ref that got busted with mob ties and I</p>
<p>loved how they acted like he was the only one who</p>
<p>I was just Tim</p>
<p>like you wouldn&rsquo;t notice that if you were</p>
<p>refereeing with them</p>
<p>is he teeing everybody up you know</p>
<p>like if he bet the</p>
<p>under and everybody&rsquo;s like fouling out</p>
<p>I mean I know that&rsquo;s an exaggeration</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the easiest games to fix</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>had a problem with that with professional pool</p>
<p>with professional pool</p>
<p>the only one time</p>
<p>that a sports book</p>
<p>ever put a line</p>
<p>on the event</p>
<p>I forget what casino was in</p>
<p>it was that but it was in Vegas</p>
<p>and it was a big tournament</p>
<p>these guys are</p>
<p>grinding they&rsquo;re out there</p>
<p>you know professional pool players don&rsquo;t make much</p>
<p>money you know even the best in the world so</p>
<p>there was an</p>
<p>underdog this guy Mike LeBron he hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>won a big tournament</p>
<p>like that in a long time so they all got together and</p>
<p>said hey Mike</p>
<p>guess what you won the tournament we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to fucking bet on you</p>
<p>they all threw in and everybody dumped</p>
<p>and they all dumped Mike LeBron one they</p>
<p>cleaned up and the book he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never put a line on pool again</p>
<p>and did they</p>
<p>and they obviously figured it out</p>
<p>fucking everybody</p>
<p>know they&rsquo;re driving balls of the rail</p>
<p>their fucking supposed</p>
<p>to get out ball in hand they don&rsquo;t get out they scratch</p>
<p>you know there was</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>bunch of shots were dudes were like what the</p>
<p>fuck is this they were obviously bad</p>
<p>well you know they do</p>
<p>their best but</p>
<p>these guys high</p>
<p>level pros don&rsquo;t miss very often</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>they can fuck up and take a bad path on purpose and</p>
<p>a path that gives them a high percentage of getting</p>
<p>stuck behind balls or something like that</p>
<p>so they make</p>
<p>errors on purpose</p>
<p>and you look at it and you&rsquo;re like why the fuck</p>
<p>would that guy play that like that like</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s top of the food</p>
<p>chain world champion</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just trying</p>
<p>a snooker player got busted recently for taking a 300</p>
<p>300 thousand euro bribe</p>
<p>he was taking a bribe</p>
<p>to dump a bunch of matches</p>
<p>and this guy is like one of the very best in the</p>
<p>world he&rsquo;s like a top line</p>
<p>and snooker players make big bank</p>
<p>but apparently</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a common</p>
<p>what was his vice</p>
<p>money that he took it</p>
<p>just wanted</p>
<p>money you know</p>
<p>he said that they&rsquo;ve done it before</p>
<p>and you know they got</p>
<p>this guy on hidden camera and shit it was pretty pretty</p>
<p>devastating for the</p>
<p>whole snooker community because he&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>their starbs but all</p>
<p>8 people who are in the fucking</p>
<p>snooker huge over there bro you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what snooker is</p>
<p>snooker is this</p>
<p>crazy game it&rsquo;s like pool but it&rsquo;s played on a</p>
<p>giant table a 12 by 6</p>
<p>and the pockets are really</p>
<p>small and the balls are really</p>
<p>small and they&rsquo;re colored</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>exact room is there mushrooms on the table</p>
<p>is that from the 70s remember that bumper pool</p>
<p>remember that</p>
<p>I do remember bumper pool that</p>
<p>shit was ridiculous god</p>
<p>about that yeah you just</p>
<p>they had like little mushroom trees or something</p>
<p>in the middle</p>
<p>little rubber ones to bounce it off that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause you didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>space for a real table</p>
<p>so you get one of</p>
<p>these goofy fucking</p>
<p>things was only 2 and</p>
<p>you had to make it more difficult that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right yeah that was the 70s everybody</p>
<p>put some sort of</p>
<p>reference to drugs</p>
<p>right on the table</p>
<p>pool has always</p>
<p>had a problem with people gambling and dumping</p>
<p>money it&rsquo;s like a common</p>
<p>thing a bunch</p>
<p>amongst guys who bet like guys</p>
<p>will back pool players and the pool players would dump</p>
<p>and cut up the</p>
<p>money because they know this</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re gonna win</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>that whole world the</p>
<p>world of gambling when you get gambling involved</p>
<p>with anything and there&rsquo;s a lot of gambling on pro</p>
<p>basketball I</p>
<p>would just assume it&rsquo;s rigged</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>yeah I mean I</p>
<p>You know I I</p>
<p>would think uh</p>
<p>well I think the players make too much money</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s very hard like that and the way the way to</p>
<p>definitely do</p>
<p>it is some sort of authority figure on the</p>
<p>court like you know</p>
<p>referee and umpire or something like that</p>
<p>given back and</p>
<p>I went to the game when</p>
<p>Kevin Garnett hurt his knee</p>
<p>against Utah</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m sure you</p>
<p>still have on</p>
<p>videotape such</p>
<p>a huge hoop</p>
<p>fan I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know those humans</p>
<p>the referees were</p>
<p>literally dictating the pace of the game</p>
<p>and it made like</p>
<p>no I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>equate it to what you do be like</p>
<p>a guy had no</p>
<p>stand up and all of a</p>
<p>sudden he was great at</p>
<p>stand up and then 5</p>
<p>seconds later</p>
<p>again oh yeah</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t have any it</p>
<p>would make wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s not consistent</p>
<p>right they were like calling</p>
<p>everything everything</p>
<p>everything and you</p>
<p>could just see</p>
<p>him loosen up the rains then a guy would like</p>
<p>literally take a dude&rsquo;s head off and they just I had no</p>
<p>blood no foul</p>
<p>and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden it was like</p>
<p>did these guys bet</p>
<p>us it was almost like they bet like a specific number</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it was but it was one of the</p>
<p>weirdest called games</p>
<p>guys have been busted for that though</p>
<p>right referees have been busted for doing</p>
<p>things that there well they had they had that referee</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure if</p>
<p>other ones got busted</p>
<p>maybe they kept it</p>
<p>quiet I have no idea as usual</p>
<p>I have like one</p>
<p>story and then that becomes law I just</p>
<p>spread it out over</p>
<p>every sport and</p>
<p>start pontificating</p>
<p>Bill Burr is one of the more interesting conspiracy</p>
<p>theorists that I know because Bill Burr you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start talking to him</p>
<p>about it and then 5 minutes in he&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>admit that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know what the fuck he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about he saw a YouTube</p>
<p>video what&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up with this GPS</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the</p>
<p>people okay</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t use GPS</p>
<p>I called them to give him directions I go you got GPS</p>
<p>thinking I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna give him my address</p>
<p>nah I got a</p>
<p>Thomas Guide</p>
<p>a fucking Thomas</p>
<p>Guide like a goddamn pioneer</p>
<p>yeah like a pencil and like an eraser</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like putting compass like directions on</p>
<p>stuff first</p>
<p>of all you guys are acting like I&rsquo;m churning</p>
<p>butter you guys</p>
<p>both had one like fucking 5 years ago didn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>yeah why did I get here I was on</p>
<p>yes you were</p>
<p>I was early</p>
<p>early on with the GPS</p>
<p>I had the first GPS was a CD based GPS</p>
<p>it was CD ROM based so</p>
<p>I only had a map of Los Angeles but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never even</p>
<p>used those books I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;ve just always used</p>
<p>map quests and stuff</p>
<p>maybe before that my mom</p>
<p>would write down the directions on a napkin</p>
<p>when I first</p>
<p>moved here I used it</p>
<p>I had it written down on</p>
<p>an envelope</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d I get here</p>
<p>there was no problems it was very easy</p>
<p>when I first</p>
<p>moved to LA I had a</p>
<p>Thomas guy but I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had</p>
<p>one in a long time for LA that just seems impossible</p>
<p>it is impossible</p>
<p>so many you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>think don&rsquo;t use your</p>
<p>brain let the computer</p>
<p>do it that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right type in the zip let a</p>
<p>British woman</p>
<p>tell me what to do so what is your deal with GPS you</p>
<p>think the GPS is</p>
<p>possibly dangerous</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a waste of</p>
<p>money then also</p>
<p>one of my many</p>
<p>non researched opinions is I just don&rsquo;t like that that</p>
<p>the fact that there&rsquo;s some sort of I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>they beam a signal up to a</p>
<p>satellite it burns back down through the</p>
<p>atmosphere and into my fucking car</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s somebody</p>
<p>talking to me</p>
<p>actually I think it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t beam</p>
<p>anything out I</p>
<p>think it just is like a receiver</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>beaming at you</p>
<p>and it picks up what it&rsquo;s being beamed at you always</p>
<p>beam it at me</p>
<p>yeah yeah I don&rsquo;t want that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>stuff always beamed at me</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting it no matter what yeah you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>it right now</p>
<p>how do you think I&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>right now if you receive</p>
<p>it if you receive it like there&rsquo;s a beam coming at you</p>
<p>okay if there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>to receive it like a box like some sort of a GPS box</p>
<p>all that&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>but all that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing is receiving something that&rsquo;s already there</p>
<p>if your brain is</p>
<p>going to be affected by</p>
<p>its getting affected by what&rsquo;s already there no matter</p>
<p>I have lead</p>
<p>I have lead on the inside of my</p>
<p>thing you guys</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna die</p>
<p>earlier because you guys don&rsquo;t want to fucking use a</p>
<p>Thomas guy why</p>
<p>would you think the GPS</p>
<p>would be dangerous though it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>radio being dangerous</p>
<p>or this Wi Fi</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing this we&rsquo;re broadcasting a show to that</p>
<p>plastic bottle you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking out it&rsquo;s more dangerous</p>
<p>it is if you</p>
<p>leave it in say</p>
<p>that classic</p>
<p>bar room point</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>that plastic bottle is more dangerous really</p>
<p>you just got done doing research on that didn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>you have no</p>
<p>idea yeah it is because</p>
<p>actually like he said if you keep it in your car and it</p>
<p>might heat up it actually</p>
<p>released it in</p>
<p>warehouses for years yeah being heated up</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hopefully not</p>
<p>hopefully not</p>
<p>but they said that if you</p>
<p>leave one in your car and it</p>
<p>gets really hot out it actually releases chemicals that</p>
<p>especially for men are not good for you oh</p>
<p>even if you have</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just in here just the fact that&rsquo;s in a plastic yeah</p>
<p>the chemicals are in the plastic</p>
<p>well now you&rsquo;re on my page</p>
<p>see I like how you&rsquo;re concerned</p>
<p>about this that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying you&rsquo;re not concerned</p>
<p>about the anything and don&rsquo;t you hear</p>
<p>that dude you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fucking die anyway</p>
<p>he always ends up</p>
<p>going to that by the way he just quit</p>
<p>cigarettes like a</p>
<p>month ago right</p>
<p>so oh there you go</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a buddy of mine I had a</p>
<p>buddy of mine was giving me shit</p>
<p>when I went</p>
<p>I was about</p>
<p>ready to head out</p>

<p>that fucking people just because you have a kid they</p>
<p>think that automatically makes you responsible you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still a fuck up</p>
<p>you just have it you just passing it on now</p>
<p>well what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny is the nobility that they attach to</p>
<p>it and this is coming from someone who has 2 children</p>
<p>but I used to get so</p>
<p>annoyed when I</p>
<p>would talk to people who had kids and they</p>
<p>would compare</p>
<p>their life to my life</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be like well look at you you know you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>a single guy just running around being the same guy</p>
<p>what what the fuck</p>
<p>do we have to make people is there a</p>
<p>shortage of fucking</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 6 billion of us all</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s plenty of people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not more</p>
<p>noble because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re raising a person I commend you for it</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy</p>
<p>it I hope you you know you really commit to it you</p>
<p>raise a good person it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be</p>
<p>a fucking psycho but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you a more</p>
<p>noble person because you have a</p>
<p>child yet that</p>
<p>some of them</p>
<p>think that I&rsquo;m moral</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more just they&rsquo;re doing the right</p>
<p>thing they&rsquo;re not being</p>
<p>silly with their life</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s so but</p>
<p>this guy really wanted to go out and get wasted</p>
<p>and he was jealous that I can</p>
<p>continue to live my sad lonely life</p>
<p>stick it in your face</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny a single person so that</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a good shit though</p>
<p>cause I called him up the next day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like dude</p>
<p>you fucking</p>
<p>failed a drug test</p>
<p>like 6 months ago and you took a header off your</p>
<p>front steps walking your dog down the street</p>
<p>and you had a red Mark looking like fucking</p>
<p>Jimmy Snooker when I</p>
<p>catch you right</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re giving me shit</p>
<p>Jimmy Snooker</p>
<p>yeah he comes with</p>
<p>Jimmy Snooker</p>
<p>reference the</p>
<p>Super Fly remember that you get on the top row</p>
<p>any all that scar</p>
<p>tissue I love you</p>
<p>he did have that scar tissue that&rsquo;s the old school guys</p>
<p>would cut their own forehead to bleed</p>
<p>oh yeah you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s related to The Rock</p>
<p>is he really the Rock is somehow related to</p>
<p>Super Fly Snook I</p>
<p>know I think that was his uncle</p>
<p>you really you can somebody name me a cooler uncle</p>
<p>than Jimmy fly</p>
<p>Snooker that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>yeah especially if you turn up to be a</p>
<p>wrestler yourself</p>
<p>he was Jimmy</p>
<p>Superfly snooker was my favorite when I was in high</p>
<p>school he was my number one Bob Backlin was pretty good</p>
<p>cause he had a real wrestling</p>
<p>stance I appreciated that</p>
<p>he went in there and looked like he really knew how to</p>
<p>wrestle he would arm drag dudes and shit</p>
<p>I heard he didn&rsquo;t like a lot of the characters really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a joke writer hating a performer you</p>
<p>know he&rsquo;s in there doing like the well he was a real</p>
<p>wrestler you know what really sucks</p>
<p>about wrestlers</p>
<p>wrestling is one of the toughest</p>
<p>sports in the</p>
<p>world but there&rsquo;s no professional avenue for it</p>
<p>they tried it they</p>
<p>tried out Professional</p>
<p>Wrestling League a few years back</p>
<p>nobody wanted to</p>
<p>watch it just it hasn&rsquo;t caught on</p>
<p>when things</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t caught on it&rsquo;s very hard to get them to</p>
<p>catch on unless it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>fucking crazy like</p>
<p>mixed martial arts</p>
<p>mixed martial arts is so</p>
<p>crazy and so primal</p>
<p>that once it</p>
<p>started getting on TV everybody&rsquo;s like whoa holy shit</p>
<p>you know just gets everybody in you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get that from</p>
<p>wrestling but</p>
<p>wrestling is easily more</p>
<p>exciting than a lot of</p>
<p>sports that are already on TV including</p>
<p>you know soccer</p>
<p>soccer&rsquo;s not as</p>
<p>exciting as</p>
<p>wrestling to me I</p>
<p>would rather</p>
<p>watch like really good I like</p>
<p>I can defend soccer</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t mind</p>
<p>it not American soccers like if LA plays like DC</p>
<p>right the Columbus Crew yeah yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s horrible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s horrible but international</p>
<p>level soccer</p>
<p>is pretty bad yeah because now you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>like the shit talk and goes to a</p>
<p>whole another</p>
<p>level you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s wars one and loss between the 2 teams</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Holocaust genocide</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>fundamental and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re singing songs you</p>
<p>know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going nuts they got</p>
<p>their Elton John scarves on</p>
<p>did you hear what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in Africa</p>
<p>forget what country it is in Africa but</p>
<p>2 people have been killed and a</p>
<p>bunch have been arrested</p>
<p>for watching the World Cup</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a super extreme</p>
<p>Muslim village</p>
<p>that has a very extreme interpretation of the Quran and</p>
<p>apparently the Quran does not</p>
<p>allow gambling</p>
<p>does not allow</p>
<p>any sort of games and does not</p>
<p>allow dancing and any of</p>
<p>those things they&rsquo;ll lock you up for</p>
<p>so this is considered</p>
<p>basically no happiness</p>
<p>no happiness</p>
<p>and the World Cup</p>
<p>is considered</p>
<p>again so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going door to door and arresting people for</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>World Cup Brian</p>
<p>could you Google that real</p>
<p>quick tell me what the fuck that is</p>
<p>by the way how&rsquo;s that coffee taste it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great it&rsquo;s coming out of an animal&rsquo;s</p>
<p>butt I&rsquo;m loving that oh really this is the</p>
<p>iced coffee</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>right isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>smooth yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a coffee called copi luuac</p>
<p>and it comes from the butthole of a</p>
<p>thing called a palm civic</p>
<p>this is animal that eats coffee beans and shits em out</p>
<p>and they go through his</p>
<p>digestive tract</p>
<p>digestive tract</p>
<p>and they pull</p>
<p>these little beans out of his shit</p>
<p>clean em up</p>
<p>and sell em</p>
<p>and they make coffee out of em and the coffee&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super smooth</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>is it an insect the end no it&rsquo;s like a cat like a Civic</p>
<p>you know what a Civic it is it&rsquo;s just big fucking</p>
<p>well not big it&rsquo;s a little not yet</p>
<p>this is bullshit</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;s totally true</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called kopi</p>
<p>ka opi luaq</p>
<p>l u w AK it&rsquo;s not a cat&rsquo;s a Civic but it looks</p>
<p>like a cat you know it&rsquo;s got a long tail it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>weird animal that eats coffee beans</p>
<p>so it eats the beans shits them out and then</p>
<p>somehow or another I guess</p>
<p>they would thought the beans were</p>
<p>worth too much</p>
<p>money they let</p>
<p>these animals</p>
<p>eat them like fuck let&rsquo;s not let them go to</p>
<p>waste like somebody must have been desperate when they</p>
<p>first tried it</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth like a lot of</p>
<p>money I probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have tried it</p>
<p>unless because then deep in this coffee cup it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>good but then what it has</p>
<p>it added a new flavor yeah</p>
<p>it changes the it makes it more</p>
<p>mellow it makes it</p>
<p>taste better it really does it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>not that good I like my favorite coffee&rsquo;s from Hawaii</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m stuck it in his armpit</p>
<p>did you find the story</p>
<p>yeah I said simoleons are going underground to</p>
<p>watch band soccer is that what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>yeah well there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of arrests too because Somalia is fucking buck</p>
<p>wild man you know that people&rsquo;s Coast Guard of Somalia</p>
<p>those guys that are just jacking people</p>
<p>every day out there I know the</p>
<p>giants are weak</p>
<p>I remember those guys</p>
<p>do you know what they&rsquo;re doing up you know the whole</p>
<p>thing about Somali</p>
<p>pirates you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re high on a drug</p>
<p>they take this thing called cat it&rsquo;s like a plant that</p>
<p>they chew like the leaves of this plant</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a narcotic it&rsquo;s like crystal meth</p>
<p>I was like the boy soldiers over there</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the boy soldiers that&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>8 years old but you&rsquo;re a soldier</p>
<p>oh well yeah</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s the war out over there is incredible</p>
<p>yeah I mean you</p>
<p>you see dudes with like hyenas</p>
<p>on chains and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>carrying around fucking</p>
<p>rocket launchers down the streets I mean some of</p>
<p>the like Liberia like some of the</p>
<p>videos about</p>
<p>you ever seen the Vice</p>
<p>Guide series online</p>
<p>these guys they go to the some of the craziest fucking</p>
<p>places in the</p>
<p>world and you see some of the nuttiest shit like</p>
<p>they went to the Arctic Circle</p>
<p>with this guy who lives up there in a fucking</p>
<p>cabin in the Arctic Circle and hunts caribou all day</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all he does</p>
<p>like hunts and eats and hunts and eats</p>
<p>so it happens when you tap out yeah</p>
<p>now you this guy&rsquo;s been there for</p>
<p>30 years though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really fascinating but anyway they went to</p>
<p>North Korea</p>
<p>and they also went to</p>
<p>Liberia and</p>
<p>Liberia is fucking</p>
<p>crazy they are</p>
<p>first of all there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been there&rsquo;s been war in</p>
<p>Liberia forever</p>
<p>Liberia was</p>
<p>basically founded</p>
<p>from what I</p>
<p>understand is they had American</p>
<p>slaves they let go</p>
<p>and they sent them back to Africa and they formed</p>
<p>Liberia and the UN was there</p>
<p>until like really</p>
<p>recently like 1020 years ago or something like that</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re gone and the</p>
<p>place is just chaos</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just war and cannibalism is running rampant</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eating each</p>
<p>other left and right</p>
<p>they sell like</p>
<p>human food on the corner like human meat</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know it and they buy it and guys turn people in</p>
<p>this one guy</p>
<p>his name was General Butt</p>
<p>Naked because he</p>
<p>would go to war and he</p>
<p>would get Butt Naked</p>
<p>and he believed that he</p>
<p>could not be killed because he</p>
<p>would eat the</p>
<p>blood and flesh</p>
<p>of an innocent</p>
<p>child of the</p>
<p>enemy so they</p>
<p>would go to the</p>
<p>enemy&rsquo;s camp</p>
<p>they would steal a</p>
<p>child kill the</p>
<p>child and eat a</p>
<p>piece of its fucking</p>
<p>heart because</p>
<p>they felt like they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be able to die in combat this is a guy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>alive right now</p>
<p>sounds like a plan</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize how fucking</p>
<p>crazy the world can be</p>
<p>until you watch what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in Africa uh</p>
<p>yeah I mean</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I take a lot</p>
<p>of comfort in knowing that I can only die once</p>
<p>how do you think</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think like</p>
<p>you work out too much</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>worth he is T</p>
<p>Joe be like a flank steak</p>
<p>you know just some tough</p>
<p>piece of meat you know</p>
<p>you want something</p>
<p>more Joey Diaz</p>
<p>would be delicious oh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like veal</p>
<p>and you could sell them for days</p>
<p>if you think</p>
<p>about the way Africa is</p>
<p>right now with a lot of countries like</p>
<p>Liberia and Somalia it really is like the</p>
<p>apocalypse like if that was going on right here</p>
<p>if that was over here</p>
<p>if we were in fucking</p>
<p>north Hollywood there was gangs they were eating each</p>
<p>other and fucking shooting each</p>
<p>other and walking on the street with hyenas</p>
<p>we would go okay the end is here</p>
<p>this is the end yeah but you know I love</p>
<p>about that shit</p>
<p>those are the guys who win</p>
<p>all these who&rsquo;s that not Bill</p>
<p>Bixby what the hell&rsquo;s the name of that guy the the guy</p>
<p>with the he&rsquo;s been riding a bicycle out here forever</p>
<p>solar panels and not Bill Bixby</p>
<p>ed Bagley Jr Oh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bad with the names</p>
<p>that green show yeah that</p>
<p>he he&rsquo;s gonna be at the</p>
<p>apocalypse comes he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be fucked</p>
<p>I have this theory that people who gather</p>
<p>all this shit for it if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>you need a militia</p>
<p>cause if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t all you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re just turning your</p>
<p>house into a</p>
<p>supply room</p>
<p>the target yeah for the</p>
<p>toughest guys who come down</p>
<p>the block and then just take it from you</p>
<p>my car&rsquo;s like that my car has like walkie</p>
<p>talkies in it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got fucking like</p>
<p>every single like</p>
<p>like sleeping bags just in case I have to escape this</p>
<p>city real quick but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>starting to get retarded</p>
<p>like I have</p>
<p>like batteries</p>
<p>that can recharge by the sun and</p>
<p>stuff like that do you realize the</p>
<p>level of heads up that you how</p>
<p>on the inside you&rsquo;d have to be that this entire city</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be like gridlock</p>
<p>right of people leaving yeah</p>
<p>yeah oh this city</p>
<p>would be the worst ever</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even know how many</p>
<p>people in LA that&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t fill out the census</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like you know fill out the census</p>
<p>what the fuck is the point</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>20,000,000 Mexicans that you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>count on like they</p>
<p>literally have no idea how many Mexicans are here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking just a flat out guess and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not shit on Mexicans I</p>
<p>would do the goddamn same thing</p>
<p>my grandparents</p>
<p>were immigrants I</p>
<p>would be I got</p>
<p>no problem with immigration I don&rsquo;t even believe in</p>
<p>countries I</p>
<p>think the whole</p>
<p>thing is ridiculous</p>
<p>I mean I think if they came over here yeah I</p>
<p>would fuck things up but you</p>
<p>know what it&rsquo;s really that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed</p>
<p>to keep people impoverished in a shitty</p>
<p>place just because you</p>
<p>know you claim this</p>
<p>patch of dirt you won&rsquo;t let him over here I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous you know if there</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t countries</p>
<p>and you just allowed to just sort of cruise around</p>
<p>like where would you go</p>
<p>that would be the problem is</p>
<p>things would they</p>
<p>would level out</p>
<p>the problem</p>
<p>is you let people go and move to wherever they want</p>
<p>and people are always</p>
<p>gonna move to the</p>
<p>place where it&rsquo;s better and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna abandon</p>
<p>their shitty place</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>allow them they have to stay in</p>
<p>their shitty</p>
<p>place and make</p>
<p>their shitty</p>
<p>place better</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna fucking do</p>
<p>so you ensure that there&rsquo;s always gonna be</p>
<p>levels of people</p>
<p>the only way to keep levels</p>
<p>other than that is just</p>
<p>fucking be heavily armed</p>
<p>you have to be</p>
<p>armed to the teeth</p>
<p>your whole town</p>
<p>would have to be an armory</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>literally if you wanted to keep people out</p>
<p>you would have to like</p>
<p>constantly be</p>
<p>shooting people</p>
<p>the weapons they have now</p>
<p>I just love</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>stealing money from our paychecks to</p>
<p>basically invent these</p>
<p>weapons that&rsquo;ll make it impossible</p>
<p>for they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never be another revolution no</p>
<p>other than you know who&rsquo;s doing it</p>
<p>right is that guy out there in the Carolinas the</p>
<p>Blackwater guy or whatever</p>
<p>whatever the fuck it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>what are you talking about</p>
<p>that the Bill Bixby</p>
<p>guy up there</p>
<p>the Bill Bixby</p>
<p>that fucking dude</p>
<p>who he buys like old F 16s and old tanks</p>
<p>and he basically they&rsquo;re saying if he wanted to</p>
<p>could take over</p>
<p>the White House in all of DC</p>
<p>by the time they fucking responded</p>
<p>who the fuck is this guy</p>
<p>uh he&rsquo;s fucking he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>No no no black water so this is a private contractor</p>
<p>yeah yeah I can&rsquo;t believe Jesus Christ</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you haven&rsquo;t heard of the guy no</p>
<p>well I know though there&rsquo;s that one guy that was a</p>
<p>black comedy central has a development deal with them</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the final guy</p>
<p>in show business if he was funny they would do it</p>
<p>yeah he has like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got like his own</p>
<p>thing did it come up Eric Prince</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that the guy that got Pop for murder</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s being processed for</p>
<p>about no he&rsquo;s the guy he actually has his own</p>
<p>basically I from what I&rsquo;ve heard has his own militia</p>
<p>and he actually hired</p>
<p>he gets hired out</p>
<p>by the US government for</p>
<p>them to go over there when they want to do some covert</p>
<p>extra filthy shit yeah</p>
<p>this is the I</p>
<p>have a friend who</p>
<p>works it there I have a friend who went over there</p>
<p>to work for who</p>
<p>he worked for</p>
<p>black Water he went over there</p>
<p>twice dude 2</p>
<p>seconds ago you</p>
<p>asked me who they were</p>
<p>no I know who</p>
<p>Black Water is I don&rsquo;t know who this guy is that</p>
<p>stores all this weapons and I</p>
<p>thought you</p>
<p>were talking</p>
<p>about the head guy a</p>
<p>private guy</p>
<p>no no well I have a friend who</p>
<p>he was a sniper in the Marines</p>
<p>and when he got out he went back over he went back I</p>
<p>think he went to both Afghanistan and Iraq but he</p>
<p>definitely went to Afghanistan</p>
<p>he went twice for</p>
<p>money because</p>
<p>he was opening up a gym a</p>
<p>mixed martial arts gym and he needed some cash</p>
<p>so I just went over there for a few</p>
<p>months and he made like</p>
<p>some ridiculous amount of money like</p>
<p>something like</p>
<p>$10,000 a month or something like that was a lot of</p>
<p>money so for him</p>
<p>and they go over for a couple</p>
<p>months make</p>
<p>30 grand you know</p>
<p>did he do like the the</p>
<p>stereotypical</p>
<p>my talk about go up in the bell</p>
<p>tower yeah yeah he was in a bell tower</p>
<p>yeah there was times</p>
<p>where he was in a tower</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Eric Prince is the owner of</p>
<p>Black Water so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>guessing that&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the guy that&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>trouble right</p>
<p>right and he&rsquo;s like fleeing and he&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>trouble see</p>
<p>they had to take them down because he got too</p>
<p>powerful because he</p>
<p>could basically</p>
<p>that guy could write out</p>
<p>any sort of</p>
<p>uprising any sort of craziness</p>
<p>they done to me went</p>
<p>crazy whatever it&rsquo;s just like yeah I got guns</p>
<p>and an endless bag of</p>
<p>snow peas and</p>
<p>a bunch of mercenaries</p>
<p>loyal to you these</p>
<p>paid forever</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;ve been paying these guys to do all</p>
<p>these campaigns</p>
<p>for you overseas they&rsquo;re all murderers for you</p>
<p>and you know you keep</p>
<p>those guys online say hey you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna run this shit I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna take care of you you take care of me</p>
<p>you know simplify</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>black water for life</p>
<p>the whole deal and then they go</p>
<p>and when it</p>
<p>goes down they can defend</p>
<p>it but then what always ends up happening is eventually</p>
<p>somebody always wants your</p>
<p>title so someone</p>
<p>would want to be him</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s oh yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it</p>
<p>goes down that&rsquo;s how it goes down in Mexico</p>
<p>the drug you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>matter of time before something happens with one of</p>
<p>those fucking guys you get a guy&rsquo;s got that much power</p>
<p>that many jets</p>
<p>and fucking machine guns and tanks and shit he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get a little nutty</p>
<p>you want to use them</p>
<p>you know what I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like about a bag of fireworks he&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>stick them in the corner of your bedroom</p>
<p>wait till the next 4th of July you&rsquo;re not occasionally</p>
<p>gonna light off an M80 oh</p>
<p>they like to use them</p>
<p>have you ever I mean this is the first time</p>
<p>you know in</p>
<p>human history or rather in the</p>
<p>history of the United States that we&rsquo;ve had a deal with</p>
<p>mercenaries</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t had</p>
<p>mercenaries</p>
<p>in this country in a long long long fucking time</p>
<p>this whole like</p>
<p>giant mercenary corporation sort of a thing</p>
<p>this is very recent</p>
<p>this is just</p>
<p>Cheney and Bush</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>mercenaries during Clinton</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>mercenaries during the</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter days you know</p>
<p>this is some</p>
<p>crazy shit shady</p>
<p>and Bush the Hall and Oates</p>
<p>I mean the fact</p>
<p>that they can hire</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>to go do shit that you&rsquo;re not supposed to do</p>
<p>they can shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not in the Geneva Convention shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally illegal we&rsquo;ve been doing that for a while</p>
<p>I know we have but we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been doing this openly</p>
<p>you know oh yeah no they</p>
<p>company to do it</p>
<p>well I think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>for that but I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like when</p>
<p>wrestling finally just came out and said it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sports entertainment they like all</p>
<p>right you know we hire</p>
<p>these guys for</p>
<p>some filthy shit what do you want from us it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>entertaining though right</p>
<p>yeah and they</p>
<p>changed it to WWE</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s change the name of Blackwater</p>
<p>what is it now I don&rsquo;t know something short some</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s something happier yeah</p>
<p>bunny Rabbits Incorporated</p>
<p>clear water</p>
<p>fresh drink</p>
<p>fresh drinking</p>
<p>water for everybody</p>
<p>his babies are us yeah</p>
<p>arrowhead yeah</p>
<p>we love the children that&rsquo;s they</p>
<p>changed it to</p>
<p>yeah I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 2 schools of thought one is</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s a fucked up</p>
<p>place look at what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in Africa look what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in the Middle East</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you want somebody over there protecting you</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just trying to keep America cool keep our</p>
<p>standard alive keep our</p>
<p>standard of</p>
<p>living the same</p>
<p>I see that argument too</p>
<p>but then you know you see also the</p>
<p>other argument</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in that whole</p>
<p>that those guys</p>
<p>have to live the way they live so I live the way I live</p>
<p>so those guys on top can have as much as they have</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>much more likely</p>
<p>you know what was pissing me off the</p>
<p>other day like</p>
<p>but I think they also do keep</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a 2 fold argument</p>
<p>one it&rsquo;s like they keep conflict</p>
<p>going on and the more conflict they keep</p>
<p>going on the more we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna need government the</p>
<p>more we&rsquo;re gonna need</p>
<p>protection I</p>
<p>mean that&rsquo;s been proven that they create conflict</p>
<p>in other parts of the</p>
<p>world in order to control</p>
<p>regions they&rsquo;ll arm someone</p>
<p>if their enemy</p>
<p>is you know the</p>
<p>other side and they&rsquo;ll fuck with things I</p>
<p>mean we manipulated yeah but all that bullshit</p>
<p>where they go</p>
<p>where they say</p>
<p>where they justify like</p>
<p>sweatshop labor and moving factories</p>
<p>out of the US</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>they just went around the</p>
<p>unions and then</p>
<p>they just justified it by saying you know</p>
<p>they always say in order</p>
<p>to compete in a global economy it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>fuck you in</p>
<p>order for you</p>
<p>to get another yacht</p>
<p>yeah you know what I mean you can&rsquo;t legally pay a</p>
<p>child you know whatever the fuck they pay over there</p>
<p>in America yeah</p>
<p>yeah you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do it so they just went around all of that shit</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>stuck all of everybody&rsquo;s in cubicles now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I</p>
<p>go on the road</p>
<p>gets to who is they</p>
<p>see because we were just talking</p>
<p>about the military before we were talking</p>
<p>about the military now we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>corporations</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about big business</p>
<p>where I think corporations are at the end</p>
<p>every quarter they have to show a profit</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re at the end</p>
<p>of legal ways to do it</p>
<p>so now they&rsquo;re just straight up</p>
<p>beginning to steal</p>
<p>like my fucking bank that&rsquo;s taking 28</p>
<p>bucks a month out of my account for no reason</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even notice you know on the road one of</p>
<p>those fucking accounts you just you know have</p>
<p>a couple on a</p>
<p>bun I finally said dude</p>
<p>why are you taking 28</p>
<p>bucks out of this and they did</p>
<p>on the on the laptop oh yeah we shouldn&rsquo;t be doing that</p>
<p>yeah go alright well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this</p>
<p>for 5 years let&rsquo;s go back they go unfortunately sir</p>
<p>our records only go back 4</p>
<p>months yeah well</p>
<p>that convenient</p>
<p>I bet if I was getting 28</p>
<p>bucks from you</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>other way I bet</p>
<p>that they would fucking go back to the 60s same</p>
<p>thing happened to me</p>
<p>it was 3 months</p>
<p>and this is what they said to me</p>
<p>I said what if I</p>
<p>bring in all my records what if I</p>
<p>bring in all my records and then they go</p>
<p>sir it was still we&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>going to reimburse you</p>
<p>4 months I go</p>
<p>got that that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>and then the guy at the</p>
<p>bank goes well the bank looks at it like that&rsquo;s on you</p>
<p>right because I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>judge you to pay attention that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stealing from</p>
<p>paying attention yeah it&rsquo;s what he was</p>
<p>basically saying</p>
<p>what he was</p>
<p>basically saying was lawyer up</p>
<p>and yeah why</p>
<p>you up buddy go</p>
<p>ahead pretty much how it works is that&rsquo;s why you have</p>
<p>30 days you know for credit cards you have</p>
<p>30 days to return shit you have</p>
<p>30 days to make sure all</p>
<p>these charges are correct once you get past</p>
<p>30 days then you&rsquo;re pretty much</p>
<p>screwed do they do</p>
<p>other shit where</p>
<p>if you if you say you&rsquo;re one of</p>
<p>these guys I pay off my balance every</p>
<p>month and you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re getting them</p>
<p>this is what they do is if</p>
<p>if you pay it</p>
<p>3 days before</p>
<p>this guy was telling me it ends up being late</p>
<p>because they send</p>
<p>it somewhere else to be processed they deliberately</p>
<p>they artificially delay it</p>
<p>so by the time it does get to that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s messed up and this is</p>
<p>one of those</p>
<p>other things someone told me that in a Starbucks</p>
<p>and I got 3</p>
<p>chords away through</p>
<p>the sentence and I realized I didn&rsquo;t have any official</p>
<p>right I do know who&rsquo;s there I do know there has to be</p>
<p>something artificial because nowadays you can write a</p>
<p>check and within</p>
<p>hours that check</p>
<p>clears your bank</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>check and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going through in 2</p>
<p>hours and I&rsquo;m like yes this is you know</p>
<p>technology isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>changed in the banking</p>
<p>system so this is new</p>
<p>but yet if you try to</p>
<p>pay something off or do something like that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>immediately</p>
<p>I mean it takes like</p>
<p>3 days on your like transfer funds</p>
<p>right you know it takes like</p>
<p>3 days what</p>
<p>it makes no</p>
<p>sense because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s artificial</p>
<p>however long they can hold on to your</p>
<p>money they make interest off your</p>
<p>money too so I</p>
<p>guess if you think</p>
<p>about that that like you know if they hold on to your</p>
<p>money an extra few days before they do something</p>
<p>and you add</p>
<p>that up over you know the million people they have in</p>
<p>their bank and the 365 days a year</p>
<p>that practice</p>
<p>probably nets them a significant amount of</p>
<p>money if you look</p>
<p>28 bucks from</p>
<p>every shit like me who doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>check for a fucking year</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t notice when it</p>
<p>until it went</p>
<p>under a thousand</p>
<p>bucks because</p>
<p>I knew I had a thousand something in there</p>
<p>it was one of the thing</p>
<p>counts I had back east</p>
<p>so I came out here and I was always meaning to</p>
<p>close it out</p>
<p>I had like 1200</p>
<p>bucks or something in it and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden I&rsquo;m out</p>
<p>here for like a year and 1/2 and all of a</p>
<p>sudden I get my statement</p>
<p>and it was like down to like 900 something</p>
<p>bucks and that is on me</p>
<p>it is on me</p>
<p>cause I didn&rsquo;t realize that your bank</p>
<p>could fucking</p>
<p>steal from you and then just</p>
<p>say well you know go fuck yourself that&rsquo;s kind of your</p>
<p>fault tell you what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give you like 8090 bucks back</p>
<p>all right then</p>
<p>what they gave you they gave you like</p>
<p>3 months back</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if they did the guy just said he</p>
<p>would I walked out disgusted and then</p>
<p>the NBA finals</p>
<p>started Fred Durk</p>
<p>and I started</p>
<p>watching that and I</p>
<p>never followed up</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually something that just passed you guys</p>
<p>especially the audience</p>
<p>might want to</p>
<p>check this out</p>
<p>used to be a credit card like a bank or a credit card</p>
<p>if you had like</p>
<p>7 charges go through at the same time</p>
<p>they can take out</p>
<p>all those 7 charges and then charge you</p>
<p>7 overdraft</p>
<p>fees that&rsquo;s how they used to be able to do it</p>
<p>but something just passed recently that you</p>
<p>could tell your credit cards and your bank</p>
<p>that if there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>money in your account you are not allowed to pull</p>
<p>money out so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to trick you</p>
<p>into signing and</p>
<p>going no let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>keep it the old way so they&rsquo;ll call you up or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll tell you like hey</p>
<p>you know you want to make sure all</p>
<p>these charges go through right</p>
<p>yeah well you need to accept</p>
<p>these is that</p>
<p>what that letter was</p>
<p>about that new letter is</p>
<p>so what you</p>
<p>do what I blew off yeah you don&rsquo;t blow it off</p>
<p>tell all your credit card companies know</p>
<p>that if there is no</p>
<p>money in the account you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want it to go through and you&rsquo;ll save yourself all</p>
<p>those over you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never have an overdraft charge</p>
<p>again so they&rsquo;re forcing overdraft fees on people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re trying to go back to the old way</p>
<p>where like you</p>
<p>would have 7</p>
<p>things go through like a 3</p>
<p>charge and then you get charged 39</p>
<p>for an overdraft fee</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like well</p>
<p>why did it go through</p>
<p>I had no money in my account</p>
<p>you made a deposit to</p>
<p>cover it they</p>
<p>input the deposit last</p>
<p>right and then Bam Bam Bam</p>
<p>and they nail</p>
<p>it well deposit takes you know 90 days to go through</p>
<p>where the charge only takes</p>
<p>3 seconds yeah so</p>
<p>sorry sir I know I</p>
<p>understand there&rsquo;s nothing we can do I love that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you always get there&rsquo;s nothing we can do I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry I don&rsquo;t nip</p>
<p>got on a plane ticket the</p>
<p>other day and I show up and all of a</p>
<p>sudden I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a seat reservation I have one on the way out</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s oversold</p>
<p>well I didn&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>and then the lady has an attitude with me</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like what the fuck I</p>
<p>spent 4 500 bucks</p>
<p>they asked me</p>
<p>where I wanted to sit I picked out the fucking seat</p>
<p>and I was told to</p>
<p>have a reservation and then you oversold you oversold</p>
<p>you do that</p>
<p>with a car yeah so you</p>
<p>somebody pays</p>
<p>for a car and you go okay your car is waiting for you</p>
<p>and the guy comes down no</p>
<p>no it was oversold</p>
<p>yeah I oversold that</p>
<p>should be against the law</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure I sold the car so I sold it twice</p>
<p>yeah but that&rsquo;s not even as bad</p>
<p>because you can get in your car and fucking drive home</p>
<p>imagine if they go</p>
<p>to somebody drop job no</p>
<p>no we oversold whatever car you have</p>
<p>so they had to come and take yours</p>
<p>and took it away and you&rsquo;re fucking sitting in your</p>
<p>house going yeah but I have to go to the airport</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry sir there&rsquo;s nothing we could do</p>
<p>how account</p>
<p>how can they do that I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>money how can they sell more seats and there are seats</p>
<p>that should be that</p>
<p>should be I think</p>
<p>they figured out a way</p>
<p>to have like remember</p>
<p>10 years ago when used to go on the road</p>
<p>how many times</p>
<p>was the seat next to you empty</p>
<p>and occasionally you&rsquo;d get the</p>
<p>whole row and you</p>
<p>curl up back in the good old days</p>
<p>the good old days right</p>
<p>the good old days when does that happen now and it</p>
<p>never happens now because they&rsquo;ll always say like</p>
<p>they cancel</p>
<p>flights and jam</p>
<p>people together there you go they don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about your convenience that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just give away tickets to people that will</p>
<p>like hey you get a free</p>
<p>ticket if you you know</p>
<p>wait till the next flight so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not actually overselling it because they&rsquo;ll get rid of</p>
<p>those tickets for you you know what</p>
<p>though when the way I look at it</p>
<p>that you have to have fucking airlines or I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have a job I</p>
<p>literally need airlines to get</p>
<p>along no no I&rsquo;m not most people don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>against airlines I&rsquo;m not even I mean</p>
<p>I only have a whatever that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I hate that too but</p>
<p>whatever the fuck they have to do is stay in business</p>
<p>for us for comics</p>
<p>could you imagine if you had a fucking</p>
<p>drive to all your gigs</p>
<p>could you imagine if you had a</p>
<p>drive if you had a New York gig</p>
<p>okay I got a gig in on Friday in New York so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Monday I&rsquo;m packing up my car</p>
<p>could you fucking imagine no you don&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>great would would be</p>
<p>immediately how regional all our comedy would be</p>
<p>back in Boston</p>
<p>yeah I had like jokes when I uh</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>chain like 7 11 called christie&rsquo;s remember that yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget the first time I did a gig</p>
<p>outside of Boston</p>
<p>I think it was like New Hampshire</p>
<p>and I had some</p>
<p>stupid joke</p>
<p>about winning the lottery</p>
<p>how nobody respects</p>
<p>you like you move into a rich neighborhood</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like what do you do I&rsquo;m a doctor I did this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a brain surgeon</p>
<p>what do you do I say oh I went to christie&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>meaning I got a lottery</p>
<p>ticket it wasn&rsquo;t even a good fucking joke to begin with</p>
<p>and then I went up to New Hampshire</p>
<p>and I told the</p>
<p>joke and I&rsquo;m like I went to christie&rsquo;s it was the</p>
<p>first time I used a</p>
<p>reference that nobody fucking got</p>
<p>and I was remember</p>
<p>that high 5 you were gone by then the high 5 gig</p>
<p>where was that the top of the</p>
<p>only skyscraper in like Manchester New Hampshire oh no</p>
<p>one yeah yeah and I</p>
<p>ate my balls</p>
<p>I used to do</p>
<p>a lot of local material</p>
<p>when I was living in Boston because it</p>
<p>would kill you</p>
<p>know see jokes</p>
<p>about girls</p>
<p>in Revere with a big bulletproof hairdos and</p>
<p>a lot of like regional shit</p>
<p>and then when I</p>
<p>would go on the road it was like I was disarmed</p>
<p>like none of my</p>
<p>references would work</p>
<p>I would tell Revere</p>
<p>beach joke and you</p>
<p>would get like</p>
<p>recognition</p>
<p>laughter in Boston</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re on the road they just</p>
<p>okay where&rsquo;s the joke</p>
<p>well you remember</p>
<p>those guys and they&rsquo;d go down to Jersey and be like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the equivalent to Revere</p>
<p>Beach down here you</p>
<p>gotta like yes</p>
<p>you gotta regionalize all your references</p>
<p>the only time that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>lately is if I go over to Europe</p>
<p>and I was saying</p>
<p>to somebody the</p>
<p>other day one of the few</p>
<p>things that not only I didn&rsquo;t have to change</p>
<p>but fucking destroyed</p>
<p>was a reference to</p>
<p>Rick Flair really that</p>
<p>wrestler Rick Flair that&rsquo;s how big those guys are</p>
<p>wow fucking destroyed in London</p>
<p>Dublin and Glasgow Scotland</p>
<p>well they have a lot of American</p>
<p>you know American culture over there England</p>
<p>especially I find it English</p>
<p>American comedians</p>
<p>translate way</p>
<p>quicker to England than England do to American</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re like yeah we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stuck with snobs over</p>
<p>here we hear like a British accent we&rsquo;re like English</p>
<p>yeah but I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m saying like the comedy doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>translate as well</p>
<p>they have a very specific type of</p>
<p>humor but they get ours you know</p>
<p>yeah I don&rsquo;t know what what I feel like</p>
<p>I felt when British comedians</p>
<p>or comedians</p>
<p>from over there I either love them</p>
<p>or I Not only</p>
<p>do I not like them but I feel like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like 15 years behind the time which is</p>
<p>so nice over there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost like the attitude they have as a country as a</p>
<p>culture hampers</p>
<p>their ability to tell real</p>
<p>stand up cause real</p>
<p>stand up there&rsquo;s a part of real</p>
<p>stand up was like what the fuck are you doing</p>
<p>you know they don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get that but somehow it</p>
<p>comes out in their</p>
<p>music though like it always</p>
<p>seems like you know</p>
<p>everything from like the Sex Pistols</p>
<p>fucking Ozzy Osbourne</p>
<p>these all these</p>
<p>these broke</p>
<p>angry fucking dudes it comes out of</p>
<p>fighting too there&rsquo;s a lot of tough MMA</p>
<p>guys that come out of you yeah somehow I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re more polite there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about their humor</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>you know what is it&rsquo;s cheeky</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that the word that</p>
<p>they use cheeky</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is it just</p>
<p>some of them are really good you know</p>
<p>but some of them are just</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know and I think</p>
<p>first of all the</p>
<p>style of comedy that you and I come from to</p>
<p>you get very spoiled</p>
<p>for a certain</p>
<p>particular type of comedy</p>
<p>Boston comedy</p>
<p>is a very specific kind of comedy</p>
<p>if you stop and think</p>
<p>about how many good</p>
<p>comics have come from Boston</p>
<p>you know Jay</p>
<p>Leno came from</p>
<p>Boston Steven Wright came from Boston guys</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t know that are probably better than</p>
<p>90% of the fucking people that are like big name</p>
<p>comics like Gavin</p>
<p>don gavin&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>the funniest guys ever walked the fucking face of the</p>
<p>Earth yeah he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>monster he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>masterful I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s all like the East</p>
<p>Coast I think all the way down to like DC</p>
<p>the amount of guys</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>I also think it was</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>yeah Boston does have because</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t leave</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t leave</p>
<p>those guys stayed there</p>
<p>no one left Boston the big monsters</p>
<p>Steve Sweeney</p>
<p>Kenny Rogerson</p>
<p>those don Gavin</p>
<p>Mike Donovan</p>
<p>when I was a kid okay and</p>
<p>when I first</p>
<p>started doing open mics there</p>
<p>and those guys were all the national headliners or the</p>
<p>local headliners</p>
<p>rather they&rsquo;d be at nick&rsquo;s and they&rsquo;d be at</p>
<p>The Connection</p>
<p>I remember sitting there</p>
<p>watching those guys and they</p>
<p>would have like some</p>
<p>national guy</p>
<p>would come through like</p>
<p>Billy Crystal</p>
<p>and Billy Crystal</p>
<p>would come through</p>
<p>and they would put on</p>
<p>don Gavin Steve</p>
<p>Sweeney and</p>
<p>Lenny Clark in a row</p>
<p>and then bring up</p>
<p>Billy Crystal</p>
<p>yeah it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fair they did it on purpose yeah oh yeah</p>
<p>they knew that the</p>
<p>level of comedy was so high there and</p>
<p>these guys were only doing 20 minutes</p>
<p>height to say 20 minutes left</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also doing a lot of them were doing</p>
<p>local references</p>
<p>dude I don&rsquo;t give if you put on 4</p>
<p>local headliners</p>
<p>yeah in front of me</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m on the road yeah I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucked you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re fucked for the</p>
<p>first couple minutes</p>
<p>until you can get them into your groove</p>
<p>but people love</p>
<p>local shit and Boston</p>
<p>especially Boston is such</p>
<p>a city that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in love with being from Boston</p>
<p>so like Donovan</p>
<p>was one of my favorite his name</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get brought up enough not enough</p>
<p>that that he used to do that joke about uh</p>
<p>had some some he is</p>
<p>comedy was so blue collar and I was coming up</p>
<p>you know working in</p>
<p>warehouses and</p>
<p>stuff it was</p>
<p>where my both my parents were professional</p>
<p>white collar but I was a moron</p>
<p>so I fucked up in</p>
<p>school so I had like blue</p>
<p>color job so</p>
<p>his comedy was just</p>
<p>right out over the place</p>
<p>he did something</p>
<p>he had some sort of back and forth with the boss</p>
<p>and he made this</p>
<p>reference you know</p>
<p>basically tell him</p>
<p>the boss to go fuck himself he said I&rsquo;ll take a</p>
<p>20 minute shit on the</p>
<p>clock if I want to</p>
<p>and I fucking</p>
<p>fell out because it was always that lazy fuck</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t help unload the</p>
<p>trucks he had</p>
<p>every goddamn</p>
<p>trick in the book on how to somehow make that</p>
<p>8 hour day go by and one of them</p>
<p>was when he</p>
<p>would grab the Herald of the</p>
<p>Globe to go take</p>
<p>shit and it would somehow take like fucking</p>
<p>forty minutes</p>
<p>every day donovan was a</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s another one he&rsquo;s a master</p>
<p>there was a bunch of guys</p>
<p>that were around back then i mean they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still around i&rsquo;m sure donovan</p>
<p>if you live in boston you could probably find him</p>
<p>headlining somewhere</p>
<p>i mean still doing comedy i&rsquo;m sure right</p>
<p>i know he ran afoul into the irs for a bit</p>
<p>he owed a lot of those guys that were working for cash</p>
<p>for a long time they weren&rsquo;t paying</p>
<p>taxes on it i didn&rsquo;t hear anything</p>
<p>about that i</p>
<p>heard they were all up to date</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right you know what i misheard</p>
<p>i misheard i</p>
<p>think those those guys out in long island i</p>
<p>think some of</p>
<p>them did yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i miss her</p>
<p>oh here&rsquo;s another one who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get brought up</p>
<p>teddy bergeron</p>
<p>you ever get a chance to see</p>
<p>teddy bears run</p>
<p>holy shit that guy was good</p>
<p>let me tell you something</p>
<p>i saw that guy in 1988 i was at an open mic night</p>
<p>it was one of the</p>
<p>first times that i thought</p>
<p>about quitting comedy</p>
<p>i went up yeah</p>
<p>it was an open mic</p>
<p>night and i</p>
<p>went up and i you know i did my little five minutes of</p>
<p>fucking nonsense</p>
<p>stupid terrible bad comedy</p>
<p>just trying to make people</p>
<p>laugh didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck i was doing</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t go so good you know</p>
<p>those early sets it was like one of my</p>
<p>third or fourth sets so i&rsquo;m not so good clumsy</p>
<p>you know maybe one</p>
<p>laugh and then i fuck it up with a swag</p>
<p>punchline and i just didn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing teddy</p>
<p>bergeron goes up and</p>
<p>just so fucking smooth</p>
<p>smooth and relaxed</p>
<p>and the way he</p>
<p>would talk just like mesmerizing</p>
<p>and i had heard</p>
<p>about his tonight</p>
<p>show fucking said he just done the tonight show</p>
<p>and somebody had a</p>
<p>video of it</p>
<p>and they played the</p>
<p>video and he plays the fucking</p>
<p>piano he does like this talks</p>
<p>about commercials</p>
<p>and he plays the</p>
<p>piano and talk someone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>smooth and so good</p>
<p>you would look at him and go okay this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be gigantic this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be bigger than</p>
<p>robin williams he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the biggest</p>
<p>stand up comic in the country</p>
<p>never left boston</p>
<p>just stayed</p>
<p>yeah they all stayed i don&rsquo;t yeah they were they were</p>
<p>it was like townies</p>
<p>they were like townies but uh</p>
<p>but comedians but they all</p>
<p>got work they</p>
<p>all got work in boston they didn&rsquo;t have to leave see</p>
<p>when they were working</p>
<p>at next comedy stop and they were working at you know</p>
<p>stitches and all</p>
<p>these different clubs</p>
<p>they could hop around from club to club like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that that</p>
<p>you see that documentary france</p>
<p>almeida did</p>
<p>stand up stood out yeah</p>
<p>and you know lenny</p>
<p>clark talks</p>
<p>about all the different sets that he did he</p>
<p>would do all</p>
<p>these different sets of</p>
<p>night now we&rsquo;d go from here to</p>
<p>there and there to there and there to there and close</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be making 1500 bucks a</p>
<p>night yeah and he just hire a driver</p>
<p>just to wait outside</p>
<p>and do all the sets what i loved</p>
<p>about those guys</p>
<p>is there was almost like a height</p>
<p>requirement too like they were all like fucking six two</p>
<p>six three huge guys</p>
<p>and they could like</p>
<p>literally would have like a keg of beer</p>
<p>over one shoulder and like an</p>
<p>eight ball in</p>
<p>their hand and</p>
<p>would just be</p>
<p>going from club to club destroying destroying</p>
<p>and hammered and doing</p>
<p>blow all the way just to keep that buzz</p>
<p>going and then and then the end of the</p>
<p>night dude i</p>
<p>heard some fuck</p>
<p>that that back room at nick&rsquo;s man somebody oh</p>
<p>they offered to pay me a coke</p>
<p>what yeah they</p>
<p>would offer to pay you</p>
<p>in coke yeah</p>
<p>that was the deal</p>
<p>did they go you do coke</p>
<p>well no we could pay you in coke</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;ll take cash yeah i&rsquo;ll take cash what</p>
<p>the fuck like i</p>
<p>thought that</p>
<p>was a joke i didn&rsquo;t realize they pay you in coke</p>
<p>they offer to pay you in coke and that</p>
<p>was what a lot of guys did a lot of guys got some of</p>
<p>their money in coke</p>
<p>cause i guess</p>
<p>are comedians and porn stars to</p>
<p>two careers that</p>
<p>can get paid and coke</p>
<p>if it had to come down to it yeah i</p>
<p>would say probably bands too</p>
<p>probably a lot of bands a portion of</p>
<p>the boxers back in the day but</p>
<p>djs they&rsquo;d give you some</p>
<p>chips you ever see that i know it&rsquo;s just a photo op</p>
<p>thing do you ever see that</p>
<p>great picture of</p>
<p>sunny liston</p>
<p>yeah where he</p>
<p>looks like he just</p>
<p>knocked somebody out and he&rsquo;s sitting there</p>
<p>still in his boxer trunks</p>
<p>hands taped up i</p>
<p>think his hands were on but that had to been a</p>
<p>promotional</p>
<p>even those mob guys be like come on sonny let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get you showered</p>
<p>up a little</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get you showered</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think the</p>
<p>starting out in boston was like one of the best</p>
<p>places you could have ever</p>
<p>chose to begin your comedy career i think</p>
<p>about that a lot so</p>
<p>lucky whenever i</p>
<p>think about that cause when did you start what year i</p>
<p>started in march of 92</p>
<p>i was like 23 almost 24 so i</p>
<p>started a little bit late</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>just some of the times like when i&rsquo;ve gone on the road</p>
<p>and you meet</p>
<p>the up and coming guys like yeah the comedy</p>
<p>scene here sucks</p>
<p>and blah blah blah blah like</p>
<p>it sucks so bad like don&rsquo;t even know what to do</p>
<p>and you always tell them well just go out and</p>
<p>start a room</p>
<p>like some of them like</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>scene so bad they don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think of doing that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what do you mean</p>
<p>start a room it&rsquo;s like go pick a fucking sports bar</p>
<p>that does no business</p>
<p>on a monday tuesday</p>
<p>and tell them that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get people in here you know lie to them</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get people to come in to watch</p>
<p>these fucking open micers do five minutes each</p>
<p>dude the first time i ate my</p>
<p>fucking balls on</p>
<p>stage i was doing this</p>
<p>place like kelly</p>
<p>something or other</p>
<p>in either redding or</p>
<p>north redding it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist anymore this comedian jack</p>
<p>lynch booked it</p>
<p>and there would</p>
<p>literally be like a bruins game on tv</p>
<p>and they wouldn&rsquo;t shut the game off</p>
<p>either fuck no</p>
<p>no you gotta</p>
<p>do comedy over</p>
<p>the game yeah and the volume for the game was</p>
<p>still on too</p>
<p>yeah a lot of</p>
<p>those gigs down the cape i did a lot of those gigs</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d find out the fucking game was on</p>
<p>while you got there</p>
<p>fuck the game</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>leave the game on</p>
<p>there was like an always an</p>
<p>issue yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna leave the game</p>
<p>and if they said are we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna turn the game off</p>
<p>they would turn the game off everybody go what the fuck</p>
<p>you fucking shot the game off</p>
<p>you shut the fuck</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>would have to go do comedy for a</p>
<p>bunch of people were angry</p>
<p>at you for shutting the game off</p>
<p>it was brutal and i remember</p>
<p>the second question</p>
<p>other than are you</p>
<p>gonna are you</p>
<p>gonna shut the game off is there a stage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another thing now</p>

<p>green we were it was me</p>
<p>al del benny</p>
<p>patrice o&rsquo;neal</p>
<p>and i want to say dane cook was on it</p>
<p>and we were</p>
<p>bobby kelly</p>
<p>i think it was his gig that he booked we were so</p>
<p>green and years</p>
<p>later i finally figured it out</p>
<p>they gave us this</p>
<p>microphone it was a lapel mic</p>
<p>so we had to go up and do</p>
<p>comedy with</p>
<p>just like a lapel on like we were doing letterman</p>
<p>but we were so</p>
<p>green we didn&rsquo;t know that you clipped it on through all</p>
<p>standing there holding</p>
<p>i swear to god</p>
<p>holding a lapel mic i remember</p>
<p>patrice he&rsquo;s like fucking six five</p>
<p>hold it because i remember</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why del benny</p>
<p>al del benny</p>
<p>was hosting is like what the fuck is up with this mic</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like this is the</p>
<p>smallest mic ever look i&rsquo;ll put it my head in his mouth</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>laughing at them like yeah</p>
<p>what a half assed fucking gig and we were so stupid</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what it was and like he would let</p>
<p>it al would</p>
<p>bring me up and</p>
<p>then hand me the mic like a teacup with his pinkies out</p>
<p>picky out and i</p>
<p>would just be like hey keep it going</p>
<p>yeah my dad was</p>
<p>he was pretty nuts growing up with like</p>
<p>three fingers up in the air holding this</p>
<p>thing have you done</p>
<p>stand up on a talk show with a lapel mic</p>
<p>yeah i actually really like it do you</p>
<p>yeah you ever</p>
<p>thought about</p>
<p>going bobby</p>
<p>brown style on</p>
<p>stage y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>ready for this i know</p>
<p>chris titus does that</p>
<p>titus wears like a headgear thing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like that i don&rsquo;t like jackets and i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like the head</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how you do comedy</p>
<p>with a jacket on i don&rsquo;t mind it if it&rsquo;s cold</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s cold i wear a jacket i</p>
<p>can wear a zip</p>
<p>up i can wear a zip up but the</p>
<p>sport coat it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t move with the</p>
<p>shirt i wore a</p>
<p>sport coat the</p>
<p>first time i went on</p>
<p>stage because i thought that&rsquo;s how you supposed to</p>
<p>dress out of</p>
<p>sport coat with the</p>
<p>sleeves rolled up like</p>
<p>this i was talking</p>
<p>about that miami</p>
<p>vice t shirt a</p>
<p>wacky t shirt t</p>
<p>shirt with like a</p>
<p>silly smile on it</p>
<p>i thought that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>in a pin i had like a button or something on my fucking</p>
<p>sports coat did you guys see chris rock on lino the</p>
<p>other day just owning</p>
<p>oh that was so</p>
<p>great what happened</p>
<p>buddy just fucking with it</p>
<p>like jay what you doing here</p>
<p>last time i was here is a dude with red hair</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>started saying that</p>
<p>kevin the man guy</p>
<p>you got a cheaper brother and</p>
<p>the guys like man that&rsquo;s cold because he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>funny he attacked</p>
<p>he attacked it&rsquo;s uncomfortable</p>
<p>he kept on going into</p>
<p>like you can tell jay when you like</p>
<p>something else</p>
<p>that is one of the most amazing</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>what is how he got that show back</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t disagree with him though look you know</p>
<p>everybody puts it this way look</p>
<p>the guy was on top he was fucking number one number one</p>
<p>and they come</p>
<p>along and say we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna lose you or</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna lose conan</p>
<p>unless we give him the</p>
<p>tonight show so we want to give him the tonight show</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like what fucking really you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take my gang away from me</p>
<p>and so he goes okay all right i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>under duress</p>
<p>offers to give up the gig in five years see that</p>
<p>thing but he&rsquo;s number one i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s under</p>
<p>arrest he was number brilliant</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>brilliant but he was number one so he gets kicked off</p>
<p>they put this</p>
<p>new guy and the new guy is bombing he&rsquo;s eating dick</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s what no one wants to talk about</p>
<p>conan o&rsquo;brien</p>
<p>on the tonight show wasn&rsquo;t that good yeah but you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s bullshit</p>
<p>because leto&rsquo;s doing the</p>
<p>exact same ratings right now</p>
<p>as conan was</p>
<p>on a time out</p>
<p>no no we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go back to that</p>
<p>dropped substantially</p>
<p>it dropped substantially from</p>
<p>where it was before</p>
<p>from where it was when lenno was hosting it to work</p>
<p>at the ratings in</p>
<p>i can refuse</p>
<p>conan hold on a</p>
<p>second they fucked conan</p>
<p>by not letting him do any of his</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t do the masturbating bear</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t do all these</p>
<p>different sketches</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>triumph the</p>
<p>insult dog couldn&rsquo;t do any of that shit</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an 11 o&rsquo;clock show they fucked up if when jay</p>
<p>leno got the tonight show</p>
<p>if he had to</p>
<p>follow johnny carson bombing for an hour you&rsquo;re totally</p>
<p>right about that i mean</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>worst decision ever but that&rsquo;s like if a comedian</p>
<p>bombs in front of you</p>
<p>for a half hour</p>
<p>in front of you i mean you gotta</p>
<p>spend not only that you gotta</p>
<p>jack the tonight</p>
<p>show because the tonight show was always the</p>
<p>late night show</p>
<p>where guys would go on and all the</p>
<p>guests would go on</p>
<p>and it would</p>
<p>be like an important spot well the 10 o&rsquo;clock spot</p>
<p>became just as important</p>
<p>so he was like they were like siphoning off</p>
<p>guests like</p>
<p>you know you couldn&rsquo;t have a guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>promoting you know mel gibson goes on</p>
<p>jay leno show and then goes on tonight show as well</p>
<p>no you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>gonna have one or the other</p>
<p>like tv is all</p>
<p>about the landing</p>
<p>for guests so the brilliance of it</p>
<p>was j bombing</p>
<p>actually fucked conan</p>
<p>they gave conan</p>
<p>we had the show for like six months</p>
<p>right before they were</p>
<p>started going like all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s get this guy out and he got it back now</p>
<p>i think i think taking i</p>
<p>think it was a brilliant</p>
<p>away from it i</p>
<p>think it was a brilliant</p>
<p>brilliant the way jay</p>
<p>played it was</p>
<p>absolutely brilliant i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think and bombed</p>
<p>on purpose no no i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>bond on purpose but the way he played it like yeah</p>
<p>yeah sure i&rsquo;ll do it and then the fucking 12th hour</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m gonna leave but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not retiring and then they</p>
<p>freak the fuck out</p>
<p>so like he now i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>at least how we look at it like i</p>
<p>understand jay being like look i the number</p>
<p>one show what are you kicking me off for he&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>right about that</p>
<p>but i also i don&rsquo;t look at conan like he failed like</p>
<p>conan got fucked conan</p>
<p>got fucked yes he got fucked because i completely</p>
<p>agree but what i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>you got to realize that jay</p>
<p>leno had the</p>
<p>number one spot he was number one in the late</p>
<p>night wars before</p>
<p>they gave it to conan</p>
<p>so why would he</p>
<p>give a fuck if they gave the show to conan</p>
<p>offered it back to him why</p>
<p>would he not take it</p>
<p>conan took it</p>
<p>from him i don&rsquo;t you know but everybody&rsquo;s making out</p>
<p>like jay is this asshole for taking conan&rsquo;s job like</p>
<p>wait conan took his job</p>
<p>conan&rsquo;s not a he&rsquo;s not a poor man he&rsquo;s a rich man</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>worried about</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>about is conan keeps saying don&rsquo;t feel bad for me</p>
<p>he made he made a</p>
<p>great little</p>
<p>said a great little</p>
<p>thing on his last episode he said don&rsquo;t be cynical</p>
<p>you know blah blah</p>
<p>i hate people</p>
<p>who are cynically said this really positive</p>
<p>thing don&rsquo;t feel bad</p>
<p>for me played fucking free bird with the band</p>
<p>went out like a man and that was it he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never bitched</p>
<p>about it already that type</p>
<p>of shit dude they gave him</p>
<p>forty fucking million dollars</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>would suit smooth</p>
<p>things over a</p>
<p>bit see no matter</p>
<p>what kona does he&rsquo;s an asshole i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>asshole and</p>
<p>he also and</p>
<p>he also gave</p>
<p>a lot of that</p>
<p>money he gave a lot of that</p>
<p>money out to people he worked with i</p>
<p>know they wanted to fucking move back</p>
<p>felt bad those guys yes the only</p>
<p>thing that i find annoying</p>
<p>about jay leno</p>
<p>is acting as though</p>
<p>he he isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a shrewd businessman that</p>
<p>whole i mean i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m going to yes</p>
<p>he does do that</p>
<p>but if that&rsquo;s how he</p>
<p>wants to portray himself</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine that&rsquo;s the but i&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing that fucking</p>
<p>annoys about the</p>
<p>whole thing i don&rsquo;t know the only</p>
<p>thing that annoyed me was when everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>making a big deal like jay&rsquo;s taking conan&rsquo;s job</p>
<p>but conan took jay&rsquo;s job</p>
<p>and jay took johnny&rsquo;s job he</p>
<p>fucking forced him out did he really yeah i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that how did</p>
<p>he force him out</p>
<p>ah that fucking book i read</p>
<p>i read the late shift</p>
<p>and a fucking book i read</p>
<p>the fucking late shift book</p>
<p>i read hilarious how much people pay attention to</p>
<p>these late night wars no but this this the</p>
<p>thing though</p>
<p>if if jay only got</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>jay without johnny bombing in</p>
<p>front of him</p>
<p>going on if they like fucking er</p>
<p>and seinfeld and all</p>
<p>those hit shows dude</p>
<p>it still took him eighteen months</p>
<p>remember letterman was kicking the shit out of yes</p>
<p>until you got hugh grant on</p>
<p>it took him</p>
<p>18 months you know</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really funny</p>
<p>about to give</p>
<p>him only six fucking</p>
<p>months and he&rsquo;s got to follow the previous host</p>
<p>eating his balls for a half hour in</p>
<p>front of him</p>
<p>it was it was bullshit</p>
<p>they should</p>
<p>have ridiculous idea it was a</p>
<p>ridiculous idea they were just afraid to let conan go</p>
<p>and conan was like look i want the fucking tonight show</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t want to give it to him</p>
<p>to go back and forth and so they give it to him to give</p>
<p>they thought that jay&rsquo;s numbers were gonna drop</p>
<p>yeah in five years they&rsquo;re like alright he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be pushing 60</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna want to watch this</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>dumbest thing ever a guy&rsquo;s gonna what</p>
<p>johnny carson got better as he got older</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>this is what i</p>
<p>think i think conan is</p>
<p>gonna be way better off</p>
<p>on a network that</p>
<p>just lets him do whatever the fuck he wants i think</p>
<p>tbs is gonna</p>
<p>own great show</p>
<p>dude he owns that show</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be so much he&rsquo;s brilliant</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>when conan is at his best</p>
<p>when you get to see how</p>
<p>funny it is like you ever see that one</p>
<p>sketch they did</p>
<p>about baseball</p>
<p>a bunch of people who play baseball like 1800s baseball</p>
<p>they have like a</p>
<p>they wear vintage</p>
<p>clothes they make</p>
<p>their own oh yeah</p>
<p>yeah i saw this fucking</p>
<p>genius hilarious</p>
<p>cause he just goes balls out it&rsquo;s just him you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just him being funny</p>
<p>if you think</p>
<p>i guarantee</p>
<p>you they fucked with them too much when they</p>
<p>switched him over to 11 o&rsquo;clock they probably cut</p>
<p>all the meat and anything controversial</p>
<p>out of his monologues or out of his sketches</p>
<p>they probably stopped him from doing a lot of shit</p>
<p>yeah and he</p>
<p>said when he left don&rsquo;t feel bad for me and people are</p>
<p>still saying that he&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s whining</p>
<p>which i don&rsquo;t get i mean he did he did jokes</p>
<p>about it in his</p>
<p>model up what the fuck he&rsquo;s supposed to do</p>
<p>now is just</p>
<p>sitting there talking about</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get replaced you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to go out there and be like hey do you see the</p>
<p>earthquake in</p>
<p>haiti it was</p>
<p>funny when they</p>
<p>had a car i</p>
<p>think it was a bugatti</p>
<p>a million dollar car and they played the rolling</p>
<p>stones get no satisfaction</p>
<p>and there was a</p>
<p>sketch just to</p>
<p>spend money</p>
<p>oh yeah i saw that yeah</p>
<p>which i&rsquo;m sure is bullshit it is</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still pretty</p>
<p>funny it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>funny that he did it like that</p>
<p>speaking of that i was</p>
<p>watching one of</p>
<p>those car auctions the other</p>
<p>yesterday and i&rsquo;m just sitting there looking at all</p>
<p>these awesome old cars that i would love</p>
<p>to own and as the price kept</p>
<p>going up and up and up on some fucking like ferrari</p>

<p>started to resent the people in the</p>
<p>crowd like are</p>
<p>these the bankers</p>

<p>who the fuck has the money</p>
<p>they think there was some</p>

<p>death penalty</p>
<p>you touch a kid you fuck with an animal</p>

<p>people look at bernie made off and they look like like</p>
<p>they well they took down one of the bankers</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s not a banker</p>
<p>he was like a fucking an investment banker yeah</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>he was like one of</p>
<p>those private guys</p>
<p>like joe i know what to do with your fucking money yes</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have like an atm that you</p>
<p>could use he</p>
<p>was one of those guys the</p>
<p>smith barney guys</p>
<p>right he fucked a lot of employees i&rsquo;m stupid</p>
<p>well he fucked a</p>
<p>bunch of people that</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>known better</p>
<p>you know there</p>
<p>was a lot of people that were in the business</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how when i just like that i always thought</p>
<p>fucked of the rich people</p>
<p>yeah we fucked up most rich but he fucked also a</p>
<p>bunch of like</p>
<p>different jewish</p>
<p>groups that had</p>
<p>charities he fucked charities over</p>
<p>he fucked a lot of people over</p>
<p>but he was he was fucking over people that were in</p>
<p>the whole the the</p>
<p>the industry the financial industry</p>
<p>so they should have</p>
<p>known what he was doing was fucked up and they</p>
<p>still were but look at the returns</p>
<p>and so they just dove in</p>
<p>even though like none of it made</p>
<p>sense there</p>
<p>was people that were calling for an investigation into</p>
<p>his firm like years and years ago and they</p>
<p>ignored it they just kept going</p>
<p>the guy was the fucking</p>
<p>head of the fcc at one</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>or what is it</p>
<p>the new york stock</p>
<p>exchange what was he the head of</p>
<p>nasdaq was it nasdaq he was the head of</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think he was the head of nasdaq and</p>
<p>not fcc he&rsquo;s the head of nasdaq</p>
<p>and this fucking guy goes on to be the biggest ponzi</p>
<p>scheme mastermind</p>
<p>in the history of the country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty incredible a guy that</p>
<p>worked in the system</p>
<p>he must have known</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s impossible to figure it out</p>
<p>i never paid attention like i look at the</p>
<p>stock market i see all</p>
<p>those numbers</p>
<p>going back and forth</p>
<p>and i was like what</p>
<p>the fuck is all that what does that even mean you know</p>
<p>somebody knows</p>
<p>the crap table</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>seems like it&rsquo;s all bullshit but look obviously</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this alan</p>
<p>greenspan guy seems very bright he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>everything under wraps someone knows</p>
<p>until this whole</p>
<p>financial collapse came</p>
<p>along and this bernie maidoff</p>
<p>thing came along i was like oh</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>nobody even knows</p>
<p>nobody knows how this</p>
<p>thing works</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a belief</p>
<p>system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy you at</p>
<p>you have to believe</p>
<p>that it work i</p>
<p>started reading it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>i started reading up on it</p>
<p>and i started</p>
<p>you know as i always do i read a little bit and then i</p>
<p>start pontificating</p>
<p>and then two follow up questions and my</p>
<p>whole argument falls on the ground</p>
<p>but after reading</p>
<p>a little bit more i read that book the case</p>
<p>against the fed</p>
<p>and i stopped talking to people</p>
<p>about it because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if i really</p>
<p>start informing people and everybody knows this</p>
<p>whole thing is</p>
<p>gonna fucking collapse so</p>
<p>i just became part of the line</p>
<p>so now i&rsquo;m play doh yeah</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>points that i like</p>
<p>like people</p>
<p>gonna put your</p>
<p>money in the bank it&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s insured</p>
<p>up to 200 really and she</p>
<p>gonna go with insurance companies</p>
<p>the only people</p>
<p>fucking more corrupt</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s insured</p>
<p>until it isn&rsquo;t the craziest</p>
<p>thing is when you go to new york and times square</p>
<p>you see that one</p>
<p>building that has the national debt</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s accumulating</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>spinning just</p>
<p>they had to add an</p>
<p>extra fucking zero to it recently</p>
<p>oh yeah no they coming around they had</p>
<p>like we hit a point</p>
<p>the legal amount of debt were allowed to have</p>
<p>so we didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do so they had a</p>
<p>quick meeting and then they just doubled it</p>
<p>just double like</p>
<p>there you go</p>
<p>okay so now it&rsquo;s not a problem</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only halfway</p>
<p>there now so</p>
<p>uh yeah dude i can</p>
<p>admit like this there&rsquo;s a lot of terrifying</p>
<p>things about living</p>
<p>out here in</p>
<p>los angeles living in a city that is in a bankrupt</p>
<p>state with the</p>
<p>you know doesn&rsquo;t really have a</p>
<p>water supply technically</p>
<p>you live in a fucking desert</p>
<p>yeah the property is like</p>
<p>really overrun</p>
<p>and all that crazy</p>
<p>drug cartel shit i mean is</p>
<p>essentially</p>
<p>geographically it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right down the fucking</p>
<p>street two hours</p>
<p>drive it&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re living in afghanistan</p>
<p>and the war is two hours away</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be like wow we&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>close to this shit</p>
<p>you know saying</p>
<p>if we could</p>
<p>take a road trip you want to go to war today</p>
<p>yeah literally</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re in san diego</p>
<p>whenever i&rsquo;m down in san</p>
<p>diego you&rsquo;re fucking half an hour from</p>
<p>tianana it&rsquo;s unsettling and those</p>
<p>those you know something this something i wish it was</p>
<p>a mexican comedian here</p>
<p>right now i really</p>
<p>wish it was because this is called willy barcenos</p>
<p>this one i&rsquo;ve always wondered</p>
<p>is why they got so offended by that sign</p>
<p>that has the running mexicans</p>
<p>the running</p>
<p>family across the</p>
<p>street right</p>
<p>why is that offensive</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to run over you people</p>
<p>are embarrassed because they&rsquo;re embarrassed by the idea</p>
<p>that mexicans have to get into this country that way</p>
<p>and oh i get it it&rsquo;s embarrassing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not realistic because there&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>three people in the field</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s embarrassing</p>
<p>the whole idea</p>
<p>about mexico being that close</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s got to be embarrassing there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>other place in the world that i know of where there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>first world country connected to a</p>
<p>third world country you know</p>
<p>yeah what the</p>
<p>fuck is the solution see if you open the borders</p>
<p>and you let people go</p>
<p>everywhere that they like i said</p>
<p>this is not</p>
<p>gonna last take</p>
<p>this this this</p>
<p>standard of living that we have in america it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be the same if we had open borders and anybody</p>
<p>could just emigrate</p>
<p>to america it</p>
<p>would get fucked</p>
<p>quick yeah you</p>
<p>gotta have the gated community uh</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s what the united</p>
<p>states is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a big fucking gated community well i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you should just be able to walk can i</p>
<p>like we get a lot of shit for that i mean can i just</p>
<p>can you just walk into france</p>
<p>someplace some</p>
<p>countries you</p>
<p>can pretty much</p>
<p>go anywhere you want to if you wanted to</p>

<p>can i just start</p>
<p>living in france</p>

<p>maybe three fingers in this hand and i</p>
<p>would kind of move to two on this hand</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>the whole a burn victim</p>
<p>i type like i&rsquo;ve had my hand smashed with hammers</p>
<p>but i always say i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna eventually get that fucking</p>
<p>mavis bacon i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get on it</p>
<p>dude you&rsquo;ll be like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m really surprised at some of the shit that i finally</p>
<p>like the only</p>
<p>thing i ever worked on was being a comedian</p>
<p>cause i thought it was gonna</p>
<p>solve all my problems people</p>
<p>gonna see me on</p>
<p>stage he&rsquo;s funny and everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna stop fucking with me</p>
<p>and everything was</p>
<p>gonna work out and then what</p>
<p>ended up happened was the only</p>
<p>thing i was remotely decent at was being a comedian so</p>
<p>i finally learned how to</p>
<p>start fixing shit</p>
<p>like what kind of shit</p>
<p>did i fix my toilet</p>
<p>in new york i got a tenant</p>
<p>back there and he was bitching</p>
<p>about something</p>
<p>we got this fucking</p>
<p>awful landlord</p>
<p>he always comes in i</p>
<p>swear to god with like used parts from</p>
<p>other other</p>
<p>apartments and they</p>
<p>never work so i just looked in the back</p>
<p>i was just picturing how dumb he looks</p>
<p>yet he knows how to do it</p>
<p>so i just i don&rsquo;t know what i did i went on youtube i</p>
<p>watched a couple of</p>
<p>videos it&rsquo;s a toilet it&rsquo;s basic</p>
<p>and i just sort of figured shit out and i listened</p>
<p>i flushed it i looked</p>
<p>and i figured out what the father flapper</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fuckin 8 dollar flapper</p>
<p>and then i got it and i</p>
<p>was like ah fuck how does this go in he just like just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like when i got better at computers</p>
<p>where i stopped</p>
<p>freaking out and i just was</p>
<p>like just stop</p>
<p>take in information</p>
<p>process it and</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what i edited</p>
<p>fucking two</p>
<p>second i wish</p>
<p>i had the time the patience and the interest to</p>
<p>build my own car</p>
<p>i would love i love to get one of</p>
<p>those kids corvette like a 67</p>
<p>the people who can do that the body&rsquo;s good i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>toss at 350 i wish</p>
<p>fucking bondo it</p>
<p>remember that boy</p>
<p>of the mask</p>
<p>the old jeep</p>
<p>kits remember the old jeep kit so you</p>
<p>could buy a kit and</p>
<p>build your own</p>
<p>army jeep remember it was like a thousand</p>
<p>bucks or something</p>
<p>like this they</p>
<p>still have kit kat yes</p>
<p>and you can take a kit car like a noble</p>
<p>i remember they used to sell the</p>
<p>noble in america but you couldn&rsquo;t buy it with a</p>
<p>powertrain you couldn&rsquo;t buy</p>
<p>with an engine you had to put your own engine your own</p>
<p>powertrain in it so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically like a</p>
<p>do it yourself fucking car</p>
<p>i knew a guy</p>
<p>who had a friend in this</p>
<p>state i used to live in</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not gonna say where but</p>
<p>back in the day the jeep cj 7</p>
<p>they basically kept</p>
<p>the same chassis</p>
<p>body all that shit for like fucking fifteen years</p>
<p>so he had some old</p>
<p>piece of shit one so he did</p>
<p>was he went out</p>
<p>and he stole a</p>
<p>brand new one</p>
<p>and just parked him side by side in his garage</p>
<p>just took apart the new one and put all the new</p>
<p>so all the numbers</p>
<p>still match</p>
<p>wherever the numbers are supposed to be like on the</p>
<p>frame and all that</p>
<p>everything matched</p>
<p>and he just he did like a</p>
<p>like plastic surgery</p>
<p>and he just took all the new shit that he needed</p>
<p>i think he had to keep his engine block and</p>
<p>and there was the</p>
<p>frame or something like gearheads</p>
<p>would know what he</p>
<p>would have to do so</p>
<p>what did he do with the the rest of the</p>
<p>stuff then he</p>
<p>just took like he had like a weld he&rsquo;s like a welding</p>
<p>thing and he just sort of cut it into</p>
<p>pieces and would just sort of</p>
<p>remember the</p>
<p>great escape when they</p>
<p>would just the</p>
<p>bottom of their</p>
<p>pants yeah they</p>
<p>would just sort</p>
<p>of dump shit here or there if you just have</p>
<p>a piece of a</p>
<p>frame they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna give a fuck or</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know what it is how do you prove it</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t really i mean</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have the mechanical</p>
<p>know how to say</p>
<p>exactly what he did but i said what did he do with the</p>
<p>extra shit and that was</p>
<p>basically it he cut it down into</p>
<p>smaller pieces</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>build a car</p>
<p>today like you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>build a new</p>
<p>2011 shelby mustang convertible you can&rsquo;t build it</p>
<p>you know computer</p>
<p>chip but with your computer</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so much shit</p>
<p>going on it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so complicated</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not like the old days</p>
<p>you know if you if you in the old days</p>
<p>if your fucking engine blew</p>
<p>you could replace your engine</p>
<p>you know all you need is like a</p>
<p>crane and a</p>
<p>buddy who knew what</p>
<p>the fuck he was doing and yeah you know but it was also</p>
<p>much more like my</p>
<p>first card i had i had a ford ranger and i actually</p>
<p>learned if i wanted to go i just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the balls to do it because i didn&rsquo;t have a friend</p>
<p>who could fix the problem</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>so i had to keep it very like i was like a hygienist</p>
<p>but like working on fucking</p>
<p>car like you know</p>
<p>you learned you know</p>
<p>changing the oil is the</p>
<p>first thing then you</p>
<p>learn how to change the belts</p>
<p>then you start doing the</p>
<p>spark plugs then you get the timing</p>
<p>light and i got</p>
<p>right to the fucking</p>
<p>point where i was</p>
<p>gonna start fucking with</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>trying to do like the pistons and shit and maybe i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll try to get some more</p>
<p>horsepower in this and i</p>
<p>was just like bill it&rsquo;s a fucking ford ranger two wheel</p>
<p>drive what are you a douchebag</p>
<p>just be happy</p>
<p>just be happy that it&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>i changed my oil</p>
<p>once and i dumped it into the sewer</p>
<p>i dumped it into one of</p>
<p>those you know those days</p>
<p>was the 80s it was legal</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think i was you know</p>
<p>17 years old i was retarded</p>
<p>and as i&rsquo;m dumping in this guy walks by</p>
<p>goes yeah that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>place for that</p>
<p>and i thought yeah it was a good place</p>
<p>and i thought</p>
<p>about oh he&rsquo;s making fun of me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like oh my god i&rsquo;m a douchebag god why did i</p>
<p>think it was okay to pour the oil in this fucking drain</p>
<p>and then i thought</p>
<p>that fucks with me</p>
<p>today really</p>
<p>still still i think</p>
<p>about it sometimes</p>
<p>i think about sometimes that i poured oil</p>
<p>into the drain like a retard</p>
<p>and that this guy came by and go yeah that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>place for that</p>
<p>and then i was so dumb i was like yeah it is a good</p>
<p>place for it</p>
<p>right it fucks you because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running the environment or because he made you look</p>
<p>stupid because i was a retard not</p>
<p>cause he name you look</p>
<p>stupid i was</p>
<p>stupid he probably</p>
<p>thinks the same</p>
<p>thing like that asshole</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t probably</p>
<p>still he&rsquo;s probably dead that old fuck</p>
<p>it was a long time ago</p>
<p>i like how you are uninformed</p>
<p>because you are uninformed he becomes an old fuck</p>
<p>an old fuck you you</p>
<p>piece of shit makes it funnier</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>weird things like that</p>
<p>that gentleman he&rsquo;s probably passed away</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>weird things like that</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not allowed to dispose of like that like</p>
<p>things like monitor</p>
<p>water man it gets into the</p>
<p>ocean but like the crazy</p>
<p>thing there&rsquo;s oil</p>
<p>that the oil that i put</p>
<p>in is nothing compared to what&rsquo;s on the fucking road</p>
<p>every day i mean</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s leaking oil you&rsquo;re driving up and down the</p>
<p>street it rains goes in the gutter and</p>
<p>goes right in the</p>
<p>ocean justify</p>
<p>it anyway you have to oh i don&rsquo;t justify it i told you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m ashamed</p>
<p>to this day</p>
<p>one time i was fishing i used</p>
<p>to dump it in the woods</p>
<p>really has taken i didn&rsquo;t know it</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know as bad as i did</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know that you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t supposed to do that and then</p>
<p>but then i figured out they had this</p>
<p>place down the</p>
<p>street near the fire department they had this big</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it was this</p>
<p>giant thing that you just dumped your oil in right</p>
<p>back in the day when there wasn&rsquo;t computer</p>
<p>chips and it was easy</p>
<p>i was in the</p>
<p>charles river fishing once</p>
<p>and it was right across the</p>
<p>street from my</p>
<p>house where i</p>
<p>lived in boston and i saw this bubbling in the</p>
<p>water i couldn&rsquo;t figure out what the fuck it was</p>
<p>i was looking i was like something&rsquo;s like bubbling like</p>
<p>water&rsquo;s coming up this kind of crazy</p>
<p>and then i saw a rubber</p>
<p>and then i realized</p>
<p>that what i was looking at was shit some of it was shit</p>
<p>there was a broken</p>
<p>sewer pipe that was pouring directly into the river</p>
<p>so every time people</p>
<p>flush their toilet shit and pens and</p>
<p>rubbers and tampons</p>
<p>were just floating</p>
<p>in this fucking river</p>
<p>disgusting unfinished</p>
<p>medicine oh so</p>
<p>nasty and i went a little bit further down there was a</p>
<p>waterfall at the bottom of the</p>
<p>waterfall there was foam</p>
<p>there was so much chemicals in the</p>
<p>water that it made like a thick</p>
<p>white and yellow foam</p>
<p>at the bottom of the water yep</p>

<p>there&rsquo;s one behind your</p>
<p>that last time mine was</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna take</p>
<p>a chance you&rsquo;re the one who busted out the fake asshole</p>
<p>amended into this podcast</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t mean when i say faggot i don&rsquo;t mean faggot</p>
<p>like i was in a game man you mean</p>
<p>pussy i mean yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of my</p>
<p>words i will</p>
<p>not give up no matter how much people give me shit</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>now louis ck&rsquo;s got that big</p>
<p>chunk on it i have</p>
<p>a problem with that that word to me</p>
<p>is not a gay slur</p>
<p>you know it really drives me</p>
<p>crazy when they&rsquo;re saying you can&rsquo;t say gay</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s gay like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s offensive or</p>
<p>insensitive means lame</p>
<p>well didn&rsquo;t it always mean joyful</p>
<p>and beginning it made</p>
<p>you know like have a gay old time</p>
<p>happy it means happy man</p>
<p>happy gay nineties</p>
<p>the eighteen</p>
<p>nineties yeah words</p>
<p>change homosexual</p>
<p>and why can&rsquo;t they accept</p>
<p>that it also means lame</p>
<p>because certain</p>
<p>groups own words what if you</p>
<p>spell it g h e y</p>
<p>gays own gay jewish people own holocaust</p>
<p>you know that whole</p>
<p>thing actually do is dope</p>
<p>will you want</p>
<p>and why open</p>
<p>the show exquisite</p>
<p>were you on the only</p>
<p>show when jeffries was talking about his</p>
<p>oh yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>ridiculous is that</p>
<p>he wanted that jim jeffrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hilarious comedian wanted to name his dvd</p>
<p>alcoholic cost</p>
<p>and apparently it offended a</p>
<p>bunch of jewish people they got</p>
<p>super upset</p>
<p>i think it offended</p>
<p>the ones who are in the group</p>
<p>i think generally</p>
<p>speaking most people don&rsquo;t give a shit</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that i</p>
<p>would say that a lot of people who are jewish</p>
<p>would probably have a problem with that</p>
<p>people are very very sensitive to that</p>
<p>you know they don&rsquo;t want you</p>
<p>cracking jokes on something that fucked up</p>
<p>their whole you know well yeah well</p>
<p>he explained it and he didn&rsquo;t even need to explain it</p>
<p>i get it i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he was</p>
<p>making fun of jewish people he was saying like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>drinking so much</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>holocaust he&rsquo;s having a holocaust of alcohol</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t own a word i mean just calling something</p>
<p>a hol look they need another word for what happened</p>
<p>to the jews in nazi germany it&rsquo;s a horrible horrible</p>
<p>thing and it is a holocaust</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the only holocaust you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>own that word now you can&rsquo;t yeah they</p>
<p>treat it like</p>
<p>the ohio state university</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s trademark</p>
<p>the holocaust</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s trademark</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a word to describe anything that&rsquo;s atrocious</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>horrible i mean that&rsquo;s really what it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a word to describe as</p>
<p>usual terrible disaster i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never looked it up i don&rsquo;t know what it means</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s look up the official term</p>
<p>of holocaust brian</p>
<p>tell us what it is</p>
<p>i i just look up a</p>
<p>and then look up the</p>
<p>i mean look</p>
<p>it was clear</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s making</p>
<p>light of this horrible situation</p>
<p>that that has happened it was a play on words</p>
<p>but then he did make</p>
<p>light then he fucked up and said</p>
<p>they should get over it was</p>
<p>his fucking 60 years ago fucking get over it</p>

<p>thing where it was like</p>

<p>one day they gave you a day to get fucking used to it</p>
<p>and then you did the gig</p>
<p>and then they flew you back i</p>
<p>stuck around for a couple days</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of how i was in</p>

<p>giant fucking kangaroos called gray kangaroos</p>
<p>and they tell</p>
<p>you if you run into gray kangaroos you better</p>
<p>leave just get the fuck away from they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>super aggressive</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really big</p>
<p>they like the fucking</p>
<p>three hundred what am i doing they</p>
<p>like and they</p>
<p>kick you in the stomach and fucking gore you bugs bunny</p>

<p>their tail and attack you but</p>
<p>they have claws man they&rsquo;ll rip your fucking stomach</p>
<p>apart they&rsquo;ll fuck you up when they get inside i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched enough</p>
<p>ufc that fucking</p>
<p>elbow you got a clinch</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>thing gotta get that clinch</p>
<p>you got a no</p>
<p>space between</p>
<p>you and you</p>
<p>gotta take the</p>
<p>kangaroo to the ground they&rsquo;re they got a</p>
<p>great stand up</p>
<p>then i bounce</p>
<p>right back to</p>
<p>their feet bro don&rsquo;t even try but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>their fucking arms are too</p>
<p>small to grapple</p>
<p>if you got the</p>
<p>under hooks you</p>
<p>gotta get the</p>
<p>under hooks</p>
<p>but you got to go</p>
<p>randy couture</p>
<p>style we just</p>
<p>press them up</p>
<p>against a tree and work them over with knees</p>
<p>hey does racking balls work on animals</p>
<p>racking balls yeah like if you rack</p>
<p>a dog&rsquo;s balls</p>
<p>they like go oh</p>
<p>at all are we the only ones i think</p>
<p>it hurts them but i</p>
<p>think when an animal gets into that</p>
<p>state where they&rsquo;re attacking and trying to kill you</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about pain the way people do</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve seen dogs</p>
<p>fight with each other</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re wagging</p>
<p>their tail like</p>
<p>happy meanwhile they&rsquo;re ripping each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s faces apart</p>
<p>especially pit bulls</p>
<p>you know pit bulls</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t seem to</p>
<p>experience any pain when they</p>
<p>fight they seem to just do it and then</p>
<p>think about the pain</p>
<p>later like they</p>
<p>block it out somehow</p>
<p>i would not</p>
<p>count on kicking a dog in the balls</p>
<p>if a dog is attacking you</p>
<p>your best move is to choke it</p>
<p>unconscious i wonder if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>videos of monkeys getting racked</p>
<p>you know monkeys i&rsquo;m sure it would suck</p>
<p>they know they know it</p>
<p>sucks because when they attack people and chimps</p>
<p>attack people they go for your balls</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the number one</p>
<p>things they do they try to eat your genitalia</p>
<p>they rip your balls off and actually</p>
<p>twist your foot off to</p>
<p>yeah take your</p>
<p>fingers off it</p>
<p>they bite people&rsquo;s fingers off</p>
<p>they go for your balls they try to</p>
<p>blind you they try to take away</p>
<p>everything that makes you</p>
<p>human all your valuable assets</p>
<p>your ability to control</p>
<p>things your ability to use your dick</p>
<p>i fucking i fucking i hate</p>
<p>monkeys really</p>
<p>i just something</p>
<p>about him i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>him chimps are</p>
<p>scary as fuck</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t mind chimps i don&rsquo;t mind gorillas but</p>
<p>those little fucking</p>
<p>throwing shit at you</p>
<p>spider monkeys i just don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s from indiana</p>
<p>jones because that</p>
<p>monkey was a dick and ever</p>
<p>since then i&rsquo;ve hated</p>
<p>small monkeys they&rsquo;re always dicks</p>
<p>organ grinder guy from back when i was a kid down in</p>
<p>fannua hall</p>
<p>they were always at</p>
<p>granted they had to wear that</p>
<p>stupid bellboy outfit so they probably</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t in a good mood but</p>
<p>they were always creepy</p>

<p>chew gum she</p>
<p>would give chee chee</p>
<p>gum and he would</p>
<p>unwrap the gum put in his</p>
<p>mouth but he only liked my</p>
<p>grandmother didn&rsquo;t</p>

<p>have you ever seen the</p>
<p>video the chimp</p>
<p>eating the monkey</p>
<p>oh yeah yeah</p>
<p>finally realizing that</p>
<p>they do that and they also they sort of all talk shit</p>
<p>after they do it they feel like</p>
<p>start beating that</p>
<p>chest a very</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ruthless</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>i thought for the longest time it was orangutan</p>
<p>like the orange</p>
<p>drink no it&rsquo;s tan</p>
<p>i still did</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the end of all</p>
<p>neanderthals not really neanderthals neanderthal</p>
<p>yeah you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>named after a part in</p>
<p>part of france</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where they</p>
<p>found the first skeletons</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>saying recently that people are</p>
<p>most people</p>
<p>or a good percentage of people have neanderthal</p>
<p>genetics in them</p>
<p>and that we</p>
<p>somehow another absorb them</p>
<p>i do look at my forehead i got</p>
<p>frankenstein forehead dude my eyebrows</p>
<p>like look at that</p>
<p>ultimate doom</p>
<p>tell me i don&rsquo;t have the same</p>
<p>brow it&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;s that fucking</p>
<p>thing yeah your</p>
<p>brow&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>i want to show you my dentist my dentist is so</p>
<p>freaky i will</p>
<p>drive you over to</p>
<p>his office just to say hi just so you can see his head</p>
<p>really his fucking forehead what&rsquo;s dennis man it&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>sticks out like this far</p>
<p>like no bullshit it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>look real it looks like he&rsquo;s wearing like oh</p>
<p>you like you putting</p>
<p>shit up bar</p>
<p>like you put a cling on</p>
<p>plate from fucking</p>
<p>star wars the next</p>
<p>generation and put it on his</p>
<p>head i mean it really looks like that he just got this</p>
<p>these deep&rsquo;s</p>
<p>his eyes no bullshit are like that deep into his head</p>
<p>jesus my dentist is kind of</p>
<p>crazy my dentist is like that what&rsquo;s that movie</p>
<p>people under the</p>
<p>stairs or whatever where</p>
<p>danny what&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>should say this in case my dentist is listening he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great guy look</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not fucking perfect either i look like a chimp</p>
<p>all right i&rsquo;m not the best looking guy in the</p>
<p>world too late</p>
<p>those guys are all depressed</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a very nice</p>
<p>guy you probably already</p>
<p>hung up the he&rsquo;s a very nice guy but he&rsquo;s got a big</p>
<p>crazy forehead</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a fact</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t name any names</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>about that shit</p>
<p>with that big forehead i wonder if that affects</p>
<p>that light that they have on</p>
<p>their head if it&rsquo;s like too far and it just</p>
<p>shines on the back of your head</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got adjusted yeah it&rsquo;s too far in</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gotta point it like straight down</p>
<p>some people do they even use that or am i</p>
<p>thinking of minors</p>
<p>i think dennis probably use that shit too like</p>
<p>digging deep in your mouth it should right</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a rough job</p>
<p>my dentist hypnotizes me there&rsquo;s a part</p>
<p>where they check for cancer</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if your dentist do that where they go</p>
<p>okay so this is where you&rsquo;re so and so glad</p>
<p>your dentist is</p>
<p>broke does your dentist stick his fingers in your mouth</p>
<p>no no but stick out and then you wake up</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>did you ever see that guy</p>
<p>that would feel girls that way put them</p>
<p>under yeah and they busted him</p>
<p>they busted this and what i love</p>
<p>about that guy is you could so tell</p>
<p>he never got arrested for anything in his life</p>
<p>and he just he just like</p>
<p>he just you saw it in his whole body</p>
<p>he was just like</p>
<p>okay like the girl was under right and</p>
<p>she kept waking up feeling like her</p>
<p>bra wasn&rsquo;t right the way it</p>
<p>should have been</p>
<p>so they basically get her to go in there</p>
<p>again to go under and they</p>
<p>drilled in from like the cvs next door or some shit</p>
<p>and they got this camera so he</p>
<p>starts fucking</p>
<p>second he starts being</p>
<p>sitting he seems seem like yeah i have a</p>
<p>tits and he</p>
<p>has all this type of shit and then immediately all</p>
<p>these swat guys coming</p>
<p>and he goes</p>
<p>literally from that to</p>
<p>and my life&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>and he just fucking</p>
<p>shoulder slumped</p>
<p>dragged out can you imagine</p>
<p>what happened to that guy in prison</p>
<p>he going in as a fucking sex offender dentist</p>
<p>who probably hasn&rsquo;t had a</p>
<p>fight since the</p>
<p>third grade no gang affiliation</p>
<p>he would have to join one</p>
<p>who would take him</p>
<p>you gotta you</p>
<p>gotta be somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bitch the first</p>
<p>night yeah you</p>
<p>gotta suck some cock right away</p>
<p>you gotta put on a dress who</p>
<p>you think of some guys in prison like what the fuck is</p>
<p>gonna happen like bernie made off what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with that guy in prison</p>
<p>they must be beating the fuck out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s white collar there probably</p>
<p>guys guys who were getting out he&rsquo;s probably holding</p>
<p>court is he in a</p>
<p>white collar prison</p>
<p>absolutely he probably can get</p>
<p>fresh despite</p>
<p>the fact that his felonies were so</p>
<p>egregious that but</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not violent</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not violent</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t give a shit so and he</p>
<p>and non violent</p>
<p>offenses they put them with</p>
<p>other non violent people</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how it works dude</p>
<p>i just know if you&rsquo;re rich you don&rsquo;t go to real jail</p>
<p>but he actually</p>
<p>fucked the problem was</p>
<p>was not how much</p>
<p>money he took</p>
<p>was i think who he took it from</p>
<p>and they had as much</p>
<p>influence if not more</p>
<p>as he did so he actually got life in prison</p>
<p>you think that</p>
<p>unusual i just pulled that on my ass i have no idea</p>
<p>no fucking idea you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s unusual that</p>
<p>he got life in prison i mean what he did was i mean</p>
<p>fucking 50 billion dollars that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you got to put him in jail for life there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna pay that back</p>
<p>i mean what</p>
<p>would be oh</p>
<p>did you see that</p>
<p>thing in rolling</p>
<p>stone this month</p>
<p>matt taibi&rsquo;s article</p>
<p>it was the one</p>
<p>about those kids</p>
<p>that have the biggest like internet</p>
<p>cyberspace crime</p>
<p>ever yeah i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t read that yet oh you</p>
<p>gotta read that yeah</p>
<p>make you super paranoid</p>
<p>about where you use your credit card</p>
<p>these guys would sit outside the mall</p>
<p>this is was this was their</p>
<p>their their</p>
<p>their hacky way they</p>
<p>first did it</p>
<p>would sit there in a car with like a fucking</p>
<p>eight foot to antenna</p>
<p>and they somehow tap in</p>
<p>to whatever that shit in the fucking air is</p>
<p>where you know that computer shit</p>
<p>the satellite</p>
<p>thing went back to that</p>
<p>and as you use the credit cards they</p>
<p>somehow they</p>
<p>would break into the</p>
<p>system or something i don&rsquo;t what</p>
<p>the fuck i can&rsquo;t even explain it i&rsquo;m too fucking dumb</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s even even for a guy like me it was fascinating</p>
<p>so there was some sort of a wireless</p>
<p>transmission</p>
<p>of your credit card information you&rsquo;re in there</p>
<p>buying a thermal okay all</p>
<p>right and you</p>
<p>swipe your card and as they&rsquo;re putting it into the</p>
<p>system or as you</p>
<p>swipe it somehow</p>
<p>that tapped into this shit through the fucking air</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally like</p>
<p>magic like all</p>
<p>those years of people pulling out</p>
<p>rabbits out of hats and it was all bullshit</p>
<p>these guys i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how the fuck they were doing it so they</p>
<p>would do that</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>were like are this is bullshit it&rsquo;s too it&rsquo;s too risky</p>
<p>they somehow then they took it to the next</p>
<p>level and they got into the main</p>
<p>database database</p>
<p>thank you i needed a word</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll go with that</p>
<p>the main database of like all the</p>
<p>macy&rsquo;s or whatever and</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s credit</p>
<p>numbers yeah they jacked him</p>
<p>yeah they got like like i don&rsquo;t know i mean</p>
<p>what number of my</p>
<p>seven say fifty million credit cards</p>
<p>the banks are totally corrupt do you</p>
<p>think that the banks</p>
<p>would hack into people should on purpose</p>
<p>like hire people to hack into people shit</p>
<p>well this is what i</p>
<p>think about i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>this is what i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not my money</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s their money</p>
<p>and they give</p>
<p>it to me and my job is to get in debt with</p>
<p>it and if i don&rsquo;t then they just fucking take it for me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically what happens</p>
<p>right but i mean the hackers</p>
<p>i mean you think that</p>
<p>you think that</p>
<p>you know how like</p>
<p>the cia&rsquo;s always been accused of selling drugs and the</p>
<p>the argument for it is</p>
<p>the bad guys</p>
<p>gonna sell drugs no matter what you do</p>
<p>the cia takes that</p>
<p>money and uses it for</p>
<p>covert operations to protect americans blah blah blah</p>
<p>the cia&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>sold drugs and that&rsquo;s just the way it is</p>
<p>do you think that the bankers</p>
<p>would get involved in hacker</p>
<p>activity just because they figured look someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna do this</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do this</p>
<p>at this point it</p>
<p>might be another they just look at</p>
<p>everything as revenue</p>
<p>streams yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that they look at shit</p>
<p>well then we work because they</p>
<p>would be selfs they</p>
<p>would be sabotaging themselves</p>
<p>but this is my questions like i&rsquo;m always looking at</p>
<p>these but i don&rsquo;t think bank</p>
<p>i really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think bankers are</p>
<p>above stealing now</p>
<p>of course not</p>
<p>about i always</p>
<p>look at these hacker situations</p>
<p>and i go okay you hear</p>
<p>about this fucking russian</p>
<p>teenager made 50 million dollars in a year</p>
<p>in his basement and then</p>
<p>he started an</p>
<p>empire blah blah blah and he was just a hacker</p>
<p>well if i&rsquo;m reading</p>
<p>about this there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be some people that are rich and</p>
<p>powerful and</p>
<p>recognize that 50 million dollars is some real</p>
<p>money and if this goofball kid</p>
<p>in his fucking basement is making that kind of money</p>
<p>there a way they can do that and i</p>
<p>think i mean</p>
<p>is there any of this shit</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>they have to hack into</p>
<p>their own system i</p>
<p>think that they do what</p>
<p>they they steal</p>
<p>from the the people who put</p>
<p>money us the customers they steal</p>
<p>through like fees</p>
<p>right well they</p>
<p>definitely do that too i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna risk what they have for doing</p>
<p>hacker shit you know what i mean like if this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super rich he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna risk everything he has</p>
<p>maybe not in america but</p>
<p>i bet in some other</p>
<p>countries are pulling some shit off</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about that shit though</p>
<p>where i find that</p>
<p>that type of shit is so fascinating</p>
<p>well you know you</p>
<p>learn how to pick</p>
<p>a lock the bullshit that i&rsquo;m doing is no big deal but</p>
<p>those guys who can actually</p>
<p>you know hack their way</p>
<p>i tell you what&rsquo;s even more interesting is that</p>
<p>if you go on</p>
<p>youtube there&rsquo;s ways to show you how to get those</p>
<p>things that you put on atms at the gas pump</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s videos showing how to do it like how</p>
<p>and where to buy them</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>thing that fits</p>
<p>over the credit card slot at your gas pump</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a little camera that you tape into the corner</p>
<p>so when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using it outside</p>
<p>right now that&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>never use your fucking atm</p>
<p>card because that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>money they get that shit they get your money</p>
<p>they get you</p>
<p>be a fucking credit card</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s city banks money</p>
<p>so then they&rsquo;ll call you out and be like</p>
<p>did you buy a tank top in</p>
<p>kansas city no i did not</p>
<p>you ever get that you</p>
<p>would be on the road so much i used</p>
<p>to be on the road like they</p>
<p>would constantly be shutting my credit card off</p>
<p>and not realizing</p>
<p>that i was a comedian they be like did you get a lap</p>
<p>dance in toronto yes i did</p>
<p>you get chicken wings</p>
<p>two days later in st</p>
<p>louis yes i did</p>
<p>and they finally like what are you doing</p>
<p>comedian i&rsquo;m on a college tour</p>
<p>yeah and you</p>
<p>should always you</p>
<p>should never do debit either you</p>
<p>should always do credit card you know</p>
<p>where they always try to</p>
<p>trick you in and like</p>
<p>put in your</p>
<p>pin and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like no i&rsquo;m not putting my pin</p>
<p>running as a credit card</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ever do that yeah</p>
<p>cause then it also protects your ship for 30 days too</p>
<p>yeah fuck that</p>
<p>fuck all that dude and they&rsquo;re trying to make it</p>
<p>ca they&rsquo;re gonna make it cashless</p>
<p>cash is to shit</p>
<p>yeah cash is we</p>
<p>gotta go back to one</p>
<p>to go one donkey</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we gotta go</p>
<p>fucking bite</p>
<p>a piece of it off to get some potatoes</p>
<p>something it&rsquo;s come</p>
<p>you got to get something for something your</p>
<p>money has to represent something the</p>
<p>problem is our money</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t actually represent anything it&rsquo;s just an idea</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just confidence we have</p>
<p>confidence that a hundred dollars is</p>
<p>worth a hundred dollars</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t represent</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>just keep that</p>
<p>confidence i&rsquo;m alright with it fucking</p>
<p>dude i like your hall of fame of fucking</p>
<p>geese you have in there</p>

<p>you&rsquo;re like one of the few guys it was actually a</p>
<p>success before they got into this shit</p>
<p>well i was but it</p>
<p>definitely wasn&rsquo;t a financial</p>
<p>success that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t doing a taekwondo</p>
<p>tour i was teaching i was</p>
<p>teaching at boston</p>
<p>university i was</p>
<p>teaching at bu</p>
<p>when i was 19</p>
<p>i taught at boston</p>
<p>university that&rsquo;s not normal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s way above</p>
<p>most people well i was</p>
<p>banging half the</p>
<p>broads in your</p>
<p>class i banged if i fucked a few of them</p>
<p>i fucked one of them</p>
<p>one of them she was so hot and</p>
<p>she was just</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to say her name but she was this really hot</p>
<p>latina chick</p>
<p>kelly chris and then i saw her</p>
<p>again like three years ago</p>
<p>and she wasn&rsquo;t the type of girl to work out</p>
<p>she was just</p>
<p>the type of girl that you know when she was</p>
<p>young she was</p>
<p>19 when i was 19 she was just getting by on her looks</p>
<p>but now she&rsquo;s like 41</p>
<p>and she doesn&rsquo;t exercise and it was so sad</p>
<p>i mean she&rsquo;s probably sad to see</p>
<p>me too i was a fucking handsome looking fellow when i</p>
<p>was young dude</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>see broken down man joe coming in at 19 to teach the</p>
<p>class he probably did that jean claude van damme</p>
<p>fucking split</p>
<p>between two desks</p>
<p>and that was it well</p>
<p>that was ran through the</p>
<p>whole class</p>
<p>from that year</p>
<p>from 15 until i was 21</p>
<p>i was literally</p>
<p>all i did was fight</p>
<p>all i did was train and</p>
<p>fight that&rsquo;s all i did i didn&rsquo;t have any social life</p>
<p>i had like a</p>
<p>girlfriend here and there they</p>
<p>would always get sick of me and</p>
<p>break up with me and whatever</p>
<p>but all i did was</p>
<p>train and fight i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>party i didn&rsquo;t drink</p>
<p>very rarely did i drink</p>
<p>i smoked pot twice</p>
<p>from like 15 to 21 that&rsquo;s all i did was fight was</p>
<p>completely out of my head</p>
<p>and i went from that to from from</p>
<p>going to taekwondo</p>
<p>straight into</p>
<p>going to comedy</p>
<p>kickboxing i had a few</p>
<p>three kickboxing fights</p>
<p>and then i went</p>
<p>right into comedy because i knew i was</p>
<p>going nowhere</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>money in it was your opening like</p>
<p>stand up was it</p>

<p>no one wants to</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some fucking guys on martial arts</p>

<p>thing because he was actually good at it like this you</p>

<p>drive and travel</p>
<p>if you had 500</p>

<p>like just little road gigs an hour</p>
<p>drive here hour</p>
<p>drive there more of</p>
<p>those in that area than anywhere else in the country no</p>
<p>when i would talk to guys from like</p>

<p>trying to keep trying to</p>
<p>yeah trying to</p>
<p>cover for it anyway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a famous one</p>
<p>and in the lead up to that it was like</p>
<p>hulk hogan was getting really pissed off at him like</p>
<p>like the whole time</p>
<p>like there was like</p>
<p>like seven minutes up to that or six minutes up to that</p>
<p>he was being a smartass and just pissing the hulk off</p>
<p>like and for real</p>
<p>why would you</p>
<p>do that even if what they did what was really fake</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>obviously that you know the predetermined the victor</p>
<p>stuff when somebody</p>
<p>fucking slams you down the back it hurts yeah you</p>
<p>gotta be conscious of who you&rsquo;re talking to</p>
<p>yeah those guys are savages</p>
<p>you know even though</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>might not be actually</p>
<p>fighting for a living they will fuck you</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll beat the</p>
<p>shit out of you if they want to like you better be nice</p>
<p>they live in a wild</p>
<p>world too a</p>
<p>wild world of</p>
<p>sweaty men that you hoist</p>
<p>through the air and slam on</p>
<p>their back you know</p>
<p>their idea of like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s acceptable danger</p>
<p>and punishment that you take</p>
<p>with your body is not what most people&rsquo;s is you know</p>
<p>for them is like i just fell asleep if belzo was</p>
<p>covering that was pretty good no he wasn&rsquo;t covering</p>
<p>he went i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>he was uh no i</p>
<p>think he was because the lead up</p>
<p>was trust me that guy went out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a hundred percent</p>
<p>unconscious no that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re saying he was</p>
<p>covering up that</p>
<p>that was oh yeah yeah belzer was</p>
<p>covering as a pro at the end yeah</p>
<p>yeah definitely yeah</p>
<p>well he went to</p>
<p>sleep no doubt</p>
<p>about it the way got that guy</p>
<p>squeezed his</p>
<p>100 the way his arms go limp</p>
<p>how long does it take</p>
<p>two seconds</p>
<p>when a guy puts a guy in a choke</p>
<p>there was a guy i choked out on a</p>
<p>radio show there was this radio show</p>
<p>he was like a</p>
<p>a pa and they had him do little stunts and</p>
<p>stuff and if he couldn&rsquo;t do it then they</p>
<p>would punish him</p>
<p>it was like this gag they used to do it was in boston</p>
<p>so they had this dude</p>
<p>dress up as a cow</p>
<p>and he had to fucking try to jump over a chair on</p>
<p>rollerblades</p>
<p>and he couldn&rsquo;t make it over the cherry falls</p>
<p>and crashes</p>
<p>and they get him upstairs and they go okay now</p>
<p>your punishment is gonna be</p>
<p>joe rogan has to choke you</p>
<p>unconscious i go what</p>
<p>and he goes okay i&rsquo;ll do it i go</p>
<p>do you really you sure</p>
<p>about this and he goes yeah i go you sure</p>
<p>and he goes yeah i go all</p>
<p>right so i go</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t take it just tap out</p>
<p>and i lock the</p>
<p>choke on him</p>
<p>squeeze on and he goes to tap and he&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>and i let him go</p>
<p>thinking that he tapped and he falls and fucking face</p>
<p>plants on the carpet</p>
<p>he bumps his head off the carpet he</p>
<p>only fell a couple inches</p>
<p>but he was unconscious</p>
<p>immediately if you just let someone squeeze your neck</p>
<p>he go out pretty quick</p>
<p>do you know</p>
<p>that became the</p>
<p>thing to do</p>
<p>for like like</p>
<p>maybe like a week and a half when i was in seventh</p>
<p>grade we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what</p>
<p>we were doing but somebody came up with it</p>
<p>choking each</p>
<p>other no what</p>
<p>you do is you</p>
<p>would just basically grab two handfuls</p>
<p>of somebody&rsquo;s neck on each side</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re grabbing</p>
<p>their jugular</p>
<p>but the thing</p>
<p>about it was was</p>
<p>grabbing it</p>
<p>like this yeah we didn&rsquo;t know what we were doing</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know what we were doing so some people</p>
<p>just grabbing like</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>a neck muscle</p>
<p>they were back here</p>
<p>but occasionally people</p>
<p>would grab them right</p>
<p>this is some shit yeah</p>
<p>the final would happen was someone did it correctly</p>
<p>and the dude did the same</p>
<p>thing he fell straight forward</p>
<p>and then there was</p>
<p>announcements</p>
<p>at the end of the day and there&rsquo;s been a fad</p>
<p>around the school</p>
<p>to be grabbing</p>
<p>your classmates necks this</p>
<p>whole fucking</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very dangerous</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re depriving oxygen to the temporal lobe</p>
<p>and all this fucking bullshit that just basically</p>
<p>could you please stop choking each</p>
<p>other i wonder how many kids</p>
<p>today are practicing</p>
<p>mma moves on</p>
<p>their friends at school</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>watch the ultimate</p>
<p>fighter or something</p>
<p>like that see what you get me got him a</p>
<p>kimora let me show you give me your arm</p>
<p>yeah dude the</p>
<p>first time i ever</p>
<p>threw up my back</p>
<p>was in fourth</p>
<p>grade i let this kid put me in the figure four leg lock</p>
<p>i swear to god</p>
<p>cause i was</p>
<p>cause i was also on a bleep well it&rsquo;s not real it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t hurt</p>
<p>and it was killing me</p>
<p>so i was i was</p>
<p>i was leaning up</p>
<p>to try to take his leg off it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first time i felt</p>
<p>lower back pain</p>
<p>fourth grade wow</p>
<p>that was you jacked your back in the fourth</p>
<p>grade it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>fucking with you ever since</p>
<p>figure four leg look well</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t fuck with me</p>
<p>until football a few years</p>
<p>later unorganized of course because i</p>
<p>never had the grades but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s when it really got bad but the first</p>
<p>yeah first back pain i had</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>those people that say that back pain is all</p>
<p>psychological</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bullshit are you serious</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that actually say that oh yeah the john</p>
<p>sarto guy he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>whatever on it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s fucking i</p>
<p>think there are a lot of people that have</p>
<p>psychological back pain oh</p>
<p>absolutely there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>injuries yeah</p>
<p>it exists but</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it it&rsquo;s all oh</p>
<p>this guy like</p>
<p>he i don&rsquo;t know if he says all of them but i</p>
<p>think he attributes a lot of them he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about people even if they have injuries</p>
<p>the injuries don&rsquo;t really hurt nearly as much as you</p>
<p>think they do it&rsquo;s all psychosomatic</p>
<p>i agree that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically saying we&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>bunch of pussies</p>
<p>bunch of pussies</p>
<p>bunch of pussies and the idea is that the injuries</p>
<p>distract you from</p>
<p>other stress</p>
<p>you know and take it</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m a firm</p>
<p>believer of</p>
<p>stretching yoga</p>
<p>any of that type of shit</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t know what happens when you get</p>
<p>older but even just</p>
<p>sleeping the amount</p>
<p>more that your tendons or whatever shrivel up</p>
<p>like dude if you ever saw me hobble to the bathroom</p>
<p>in the morning you</p>
<p>would think that i played like five</p>
<p>years of professional ball or so i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with me</p>
<p>so i but if i stretch before</p>
<p>i go to bed or something like that i&rsquo;m way better</p>
<p>really yeah like my forbid</p>
<p>my foot is fucking jacked</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an old injury i had from playing drums</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a real hard feel you get a drum injury yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be surprised</p>
<p>some other drummers one of planters</p>
<p>official i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what the fuck they call it but it was from</p>
<p>i was i had poor technique</p>
<p>and i was trying to do this bass drum lick</p>
<p>this thing that</p>
<p>john bonham did the song good times bad times</p>
<p>these really</p>
<p>quick 16th note</p>
<p>triplets i&rsquo;m sure you</p>
<p>heard that the</p>
<p>fight game and i</p>
<p>had bad technique</p>
<p>what i was doing and i fucked up the arch of it and it</p>
<p>literally felt like as i was walking down the street</p>
<p>someone was like i was stepping on nails</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>typical irish guy i just thought well just fucking</p>
<p>stick it in the air for a</p>
<p>minute and it&rsquo;ll be fine and i</p>
<p>toughed and i finally had to go</p>
<p>you gotta like take a</p>
<p>bottled water</p>
<p>freeze it in the fridge</p>
<p>right and step on it and then just sit there rolling</p>
<p>on the bottom of your foot anti inflammatories then you</p>
<p>gotta then you</p>
<p>gotta rest it up because</p>
<p>so what is the actual injury is a tendon what is</p>
<p>it i don&rsquo;t fucking know say carpal</p>
<p>tunnel for drummers</p>
<p>i always stop and think</p>
<p>about if i lived</p>
<p>like just a hundred years ago</p>
<p>or even less i</p>
<p>would be useless my body&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>screwed back together so many different times</p>
<p>so many different</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve had three</p>
<p>pretty significant knee surgeries</p>
<p>two reconstructions</p>
<p>both knees i&rsquo;ve had the acls replaced</p>
<p>this one i had my meniscus done</p>
<p>i had my nose</p>
<p>fixed my nose was broken</p>
<p>who knows how many fucking times</p>
<p>so i had to</p>
<p>scoop out all the shit out of my nose and</p>
<p>the deviated septum repair</p>
<p>i stop and think</p>
<p>about it like if</p>
<p>modern science wasn&rsquo;t around</p>
<p>modern medicine</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be fuck you be an ogre</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be living</p>
<p>under a bridge</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be a cripple i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to do anything for without fear of my legs</p>
<p>given out and</p>
<p>popping out and falling to the ground in agony</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just what people did back in the i</p>
<p>would have been dead</p>
<p>my appendix</p>
<p>ruptured in the</p>
<p>sixth grade that</p>
<p>would have been it</p>
<p>would have been a wrap wow</p>
<p>one of those</p>
<p>things ruptures</p>
<p>what happens</p>
<p>your parents just tell</p>
<p>you to go take a nap and they don&rsquo;t believe you for</p>
<p>three days and then</p>
<p>finally they take you down there</p>
<p>and you almost die yeah wow</p>
<p>i always poison yourselves for that one</p>
<p>they just didn&rsquo;t believe you</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t know my brother was convinced</p>
<p>i was playing baseball and that&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even remember i just kept having like side pain</p>
<p>and then the next day i</p>
<p>would feel fine then i&rsquo;d have a fever</p>
<p>and then i would feel fine</p>
<p>and then one day i</p>
<p>guess it just</p>
<p>burst isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>crazy that what your appendix is is an</p>
<p>organ that you don&rsquo;t use anymore because it&rsquo;s used to</p>
<p>is it an organ meat</p>
<p>yeah so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an organ that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve evolved</p>
<p>for bone breaking</p>
<p>down bone is sure</p>
<p>is your your</p>
<p>intestines are an</p>
<p>organ i thought your</p>
<p>organs like a</p>
<p>liver pancreas</p>
<p>google intestines find out what the fuck it is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty sure that what what intestine is</p>
<p>not intestine</p>
<p>appendix rather</p>
<p>what appendix is</p>
<p>is an organ that we used to use when we process meat</p>
<p>we processed much more raw meat you know</p>
<p>i thought was only</p>
<p>eight leaves</p>
<p>that was both trees</p>
<p>jesus look at it&rsquo;s something between the</p>
<p>three evolving between the</p>
<p>three we don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>clue yeah it&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;re evolving</p>
<p>you know are we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>evolving so we don&rsquo;t use it anymore</p>
<p>which is pretty fascinating when you think</p>
<p>about it it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>it couldn&rsquo;t have been that long ago it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>clear evidence that the</p>
<p>human body is</p>
<p>adapting to its environment</p>
<p>and we literally don&rsquo;t use this fucking</p>
<p>organ anymore and sometimes it blows up in your body</p>
<p>you know i mean that&rsquo;s what it does</p>
<p>right just fucking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like why</p>
<p>yeah suicide bombs</p>
<p>i would have been i</p>
<p>would have died of that there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>things i would have died of</p>
<p>broke my arm when i was six i got hit by a car</p>
<p>if i thought</p>
<p>if it was the eighteen hundreds i</p>
<p>would have died by get hit by a car by</p>
<p>getting hit by that car in</p>
<p>the eighteen</p>
<p>hundreds what how did you</p>
<p>hit by a car i didn&rsquo;t look i was racing my brother home</p>
<p>and he had stronger legs than i did so</p>
<p>i figured if i</p>
<p>cross i was</p>
<p>sure i looked</p>
<p>and i just do</p>
<p>right out in</p>
<p>front of a jeep</p>
<p>i wish i had</p>
<p>video because i</p>
<p>still don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how i didn&rsquo;t get run over all i remember</p>
<p>was being upside</p>
<p>down and feeling the heat of the engine</p>
<p>and seeing the bumper</p>
<p>and then the next</p>
<p>thing i remember i was</p>
<p>lying perpendicular to the double lines</p>
<p>i was only out for a</p>
<p>second just like bells are</p>
<p>when he got choked out i was only out for a</p>
<p>second click cause</p>
<p>when i came to</p>
<p>the biggest dude you ever</p>
<p>saw in your life gets out of this jeep</p>
<p>he probably had nightmares</p>
<p>because of the way i just rode out in</p>
<p>front of me</p>
<p>already crying</p>
<p>going oh my god i hit</p>
<p>and i all i</p>
<p>could think was my dad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fucking kill me and i got up</p>
<p>and i ran the only</p>
<p>thing that fucking happened the only thing that</p>
<p>other than i got</p>
<p>knocked out was</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>thing here if you bite down on your back</p>
<p>teeth that thing</p>
<p>that goes in and out on the side of your head yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>where i got hurt so i had to eat with a little spoon</p>
<p>for a couple</p>
<p>of days i remember it happened on a wednesday</p>
<p>because the doctor says you don&rsquo;t have to go to</p>
<p>school for the rest of the week and i was</p>
<p>psyched i finally have to fake school</p>
<p>and i had fucking thursday</p>
<p>friday saturday and</p>
<p>sunday off it was totally worth it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why i stopped</p>
<p>fighting is because when i was kickboxing</p>
<p>there was many</p>
<p>nights where i couldn&rsquo;t chew my food</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d come home and i</p>
<p>literally couldn&rsquo;t chew</p>
<p>oh because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard too much side of the head</p>
<p>and i would get headaches i&rsquo;d lay in bed at</p>
<p>night and get fucking vicious headaches</p>
<p>that was not fun yeah it was</p>
<p>scary shit the</p>
<p>other chewing</p>
<p>food i&rsquo;d be chewing food going</p>
<p>you know you get kicked in the fucking jaw</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not fun</p>
<p>you know you get kicked or</p>
<p>punched in the head like really</p>
<p>blasted oh yeah your jaw just gets</p>
<p>i fought right up right up</p>
<p>until fifth grade and then</p>
<p>i went from being one of the bigger kids to one of the</p>
<p>smaller kids</p>
<p>and then also kids</p>
<p>started getting to be like a buck 20</p>
<p>kind of knowing how to throw a punch and like</p>
<p>i saw i saw scary</p>
<p>yeah dude i totally became a coward i became</p>
<p>funny i knew a bunch of dudes who had brain damage</p>
<p>i knew a bunch of dudes from boxing gyms that had</p>
<p>brain damage</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t too significant</p>
<p>but it was enough that you could see it</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d seen guys from you know when i</p>
<p>started when i was 15 and i&rsquo;d seen</p>
<p>how they evolved</p>
<p>you know how they develop brain damage up</p>
<p>until you know when i was like 21 when i stopped</p>
<p>fighting 21 or 22</p>
<p>i got to see the deterioration</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some scary shit</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his face you know save me</p>
<p>i want i want to go get i want to get in</p>
<p>shape when i was living in new york so i</p>

<p>basically what charlie told me that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>charlie murphy gave you some good advice</p>
<p>great advice</p>
<p>he laughed his ass off when i told him that</p>
<p>cause he just</p>
<p>started he just</p>
<p>started thinking</p>
<p>about my big</p>
<p>stupid charlie</p>
<p>brown head getting battered</p>
<p>around the ring boxing gyms are notorious for that shit</p>
<p>see when that happens in</p>
<p>jiu jitsu it&rsquo;s really no big deal i remember when i</p>
<p>first started doing</p>
<p>jiu jitsu i</p>
<p>started rolling with guys who were really good</p>
<p>and just getting humiliated</p>
<p>getting strangled it was this one purple belt kid</p>
<p>i was a white belt i</p>
<p>was on newsradia and i was just</p>
<p>starting out there&rsquo;s this purple belt kid</p>
<p>this brazilian</p>
<p>kid he was badass and he used to fucking rape me</p>
<p>every day i</p>
<p>would be terrified to have to</p>
<p>fucking roll with this kid because he was really good</p>
<p>and i was terrible</p>
<p>and every time i&rsquo;d roll with them this</p>
<p>motherfucker would</p>
<p>mount me and</p>
<p>choke me and armbar me</p>
<p>he would tap me</p>
<p>three four times</p>
<p>i was exhausted just over and over and over</p>
<p>again he would tap me</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t hurt me you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>what was the</p>
<p>level of frustration</p>
<p>coming from being a national</p>
<p>champion in</p>
<p>taiwan doing</p>
<p>well it was eye opening well</p>
<p>one of the reasons</p>
<p>why i stopped doing taekwondo is because</p>
<p>taekwondo you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>punch to the head in the tournaments</p>
<p>and i started kickboxing i</p>
<p>started working with</p>
<p>there was a guy</p>
<p>named joe lake who was a boxing</p>
<p>coach in boston and he</p>
<p>was training</p>
<p>at the same gym that i was at and he was offering me to</p>
<p>teach me boxing</p>
<p>if i would teach him how to kick</p>
<p>and so we sort of made</p>
<p>this little deal and we worked back and forth with each</p>
<p>other and i</p>
<p>started boxing and as i</p>
<p>started boxing i realized how bad my hands were</p>
<p>from taekwondo and then i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;ve wasted all my time doing this taekwondo shit</p>
<p>then when i go box</p>
<p>with guys in kickbox i&rsquo;m fucking terrible with my hands</p>
<p>so i started</p>
<p>getting really good with my hands and working on it</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;d already been</p>
<p>enlightened to the</p>
<p>fact that my original path was not the best path in the</p>
<p>world one of the reasons why i stopped</p>
<p>fighting i stopped</p>
<p>fighting in taekwondo</p>
<p>tournaments because i realized how</p>
<p>silly it was</p>
<p>how easy it was for people to</p>
<p>punch me in</p>
<p>the face and how many techniques didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>once you added punching</p>
<p>then when the</p>
<p>ultimate fighting</p>
<p>championship came along</p>
<p>i realized like</p>
<p>oh well look what this fucking guy does he just</p>
<p>hoist gracie</p>
<p>just takes guys down and strangles them</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>would i do if that guy got me</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know shit</p>
<p>so i started doing</p>
<p>jiu jitsu and i was just a rank beginner</p>
<p>i had wrestled one year</p>
<p>in high school</p>
<p>so i knew how to throw</p>
<p>bodies around a little bit</p>
<p>but i didn&rsquo;t know how to defend myself</p>
<p>against anybody</p>
<p>was any good and this kid just mangled me over</p>
<p>but he never really hurt me</p>
<p>you know if this was kickboxing</p>
<p>and he did that to me he</p>
<p>would have given me</p>
<p>brain damage</p>
<p>broke my face</p>
<p>knocked me out</p>
<p>but this guy just choked</p>
<p>me and i just tapped and he armbarred me and i tapped</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not really hurting you</p>
<p>every time he&rsquo;s doing this to you you just tap</p>
<p>and emotionally</p>
<p>devastating</p>
<p>just to know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>until you roll</p>
<p>with a guy who&rsquo;s good how a guy who&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>you know high</p>
<p>level purple bills a</p>
<p>strong guy can just</p>
<p>do whatever the fuck he wants to you</p>
<p>like literally you have no defense</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s almost nothing you do</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>punch him and knock him</p>
<p>unconscious as he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grabbing a hold of you once he grabs you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a victim you&rsquo;re just a victim</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s almost like if you get</p>
<p>grabbed by like a bear</p>
<p>like a wild animal it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>second they grab your button down</p>
<p>way worse for the bear</p>
<p>you finished</p>
<p>you imagine what it must feel like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>photo that a guy took</p>
<p>he died he was killed by this bear</p>
<p>but he got one last</p>
<p>photograph of the female</p>
<p>charging him</p>
<p>because he was a wildlife</p>
<p>photographer it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>famous photo</p>
<p>and he was in</p>
<p>the woods and as he&rsquo;s walking through the woods he</p>
<p>stumbled upon</p>
<p>bare cubs and as he</p>
<p>stumbled upon</p>
<p>it was just too late</p>
<p>the female just runs out i&rsquo;m a grizzly and he got a</p>
<p>photo of her fucking</p>
<p>lips curled</p>
<p>teeth bareed</p>
<p>roaring and looking at him with dead eyes</p>
<p>and that was his last</p>
<p>photo that he ever took it&rsquo;s a fucking intense photo</p>
<p>if you find it online anybody finds</p>
<p>it online twitter that shit to me because i lost it</p>
<p>i had it online</p>
<p>i was showing it to somebody and then i cannot</p>
<p>find it anymore i don&rsquo;t know if it was pulled or what</p>
<p>jesus you know when i was in</p>
