<p>It&rsquo;s going to be very entertaining.</p>
<p>All right. I&rsquo;m flying back this afternoon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Mr. Beast.</p>
<p>Alan Shippel, Muth.</p>
<p>This is going to be fucking fireworks tonight.</p>
<p>Fireworks.</p>
<p>I am going to lock it up.</p>
<p>The AC, your AC is locked up.</p>
<p>Wait, what time does it start?</p>
<p>Asshole seven to seven a.m.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s going to be here.</p>
<p>Is your is your guest house taken?</p>
<p>No, you can stay in the guest house if you want.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>No, we start.</p>
<p>We started the show and we started the show.</p>
<p>Yes, David.</p>
<p>We start at six, but we&rsquo;re going to break for dinner as normal at seven.</p>
<p>So get here by five.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come. I got to have dinner with my kids.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen him in a month.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>I just remember their names.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Boop and Boop.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s three of them.</p>
<p>OK, yeah, there&rsquo;s three.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come after dinner, OK?</p>
<p>All right. OK, good.</p>
<p>Good. Here we go.</p>
<p>First topic of the day is you didn&rsquo;t do the intros.</p>
<p>Asshole. All right.</p>
<p>Three, two.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You already did that part.</p>
<p>Just introduce.</p>
<p>You started with Saxon.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t say myself.</p>
<p>When did you become the director?</p>
<p>OK, sit down, Scorsese.</p>
<p>All right. With us again.</p>
<p>The dictator himself, Chamath Paliahapitiya.</p>
<p>Back from his Italian castle.</p>
<p>Fresh off his Italian castle retreat.</p>
<p>One button up.</p>
<p>Maybe we should call you the duke instead of the dictator.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you&rsquo;ve really taken this this Italian nobility thing to heart.</p>
<p>You know, Jason invaded my castle.</p>
<p>He ravaged my toilets several.</p>
<p>He literally had he co-opted the butler.</p>
<p>He co-opted the chef.</p>
<p>And when he would bicycle back into the best life, I&rsquo;ll be totally honest.</p>
<p>For a bicycle, he would bicycle back to the to the house.</p>
<p>The gate would close and they would scurry out with two little cokes,</p>
<p>a huge glass filled with ice.</p>
<p>I was so confused when I got zero.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, Mr.</p>
<p>Jason, Mr.</p>
<p>Jason, Mr.</p>
<p>Jason, he always percent.</p>
<p>What percent of your book did you write, J.Cowell?</p>
<p>Well, a nonfiction book, typically 60,000 is the target.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to write 60 and then try to edit it down to 50.</p>
<p>And I got the first 10 done.</p>
<p>Sorry, can I just say on the on the plane, as well as at my house,</p>
<p>Jason read us the intro.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say what they&rsquo;re about or the title of the book.</p>
<p>The first couple of chapters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking amazing.</p>
<p>Oh, the idea.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I legit.</p>
<p>The idea is amazing.</p>
<p>The title is fantastic.</p>
<p>And what he&rsquo;s written so far is exceptional.</p>
<p>I was genuinely like, oh, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really great.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of it was informed by the discussions we&rsquo;ve been having here.</p>
<p>Of course, back in the mix is Friedberg, the queen of quinoa</p>
<p>in front of some Kmart artwork</p>
<p>that he purchased for his new house.</p>
<p>How are you doing, Queen?</p>
<p>How do you feeling about your decision to not come to Italy with us?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>Hey, can we can we tell our best Italy story?</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I don&rsquo;t know what the best is.</p>
<p>A lot of best Italy stories.</p>
<p>Well, I want to tell two stories, and one of them is the joke</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make at the speech, which I thought was the best fucking joke.</p>
<p>And I want to just get your reaction.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to tell.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So just to give a little background here.</p>
<p>Our friend&rsquo;s 50th birthday.</p>
<p>Two of our friends had 50 birthdays, me and our other friend.</p>
<p>And so we were in Italy for a week as a group</p>
<p>playing cards and celebrating those two birthdays.</p>
<p>The joke I didn&rsquo;t make was the following joke, which is all right, guys,</p>
<p>I just want to call a friend.</p>
<p>Number one redacted.</p>
<p>Yeah, redacted.</p>
<p>I just want to call out the elephant in the room.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s really someone very, very famous amongst us.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, he&rsquo;s known to be one of the richest men in the world.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s known, you know, to really love rockets.</p>
<p>He throws, you know, up rockets all the time.</p>
<p>The despotic leader of North Korea is here.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un, everybody.</p>
<p>And I point to D.C.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, that is so annoying.</p>
<p>I know, wow, that was a joke I didn&rsquo;t get to make.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell that joke because because it would in the context of,</p>
<p>you know, obviously it would have been a very. Yeah.</p>
<p>All right. And</p>
<p>yeah, it was just a great trip, I have to say.</p>
<p>I took my my.</p>
<p>Yeah, my Italy story is that the second birthday is Jekyll.</p>
<p>The first birthday is a friend to remain nameless.</p>
<p>The second birthday redacted.</p>
<p>The second birthday was Jekyll&rsquo;s 50th.</p>
<p>Then we find out that Jekyll&rsquo;s birthday was actually like six months ago.</p>
<p>Six months ago, November 28.</p>
<p>Yeah, nobody nobody cared.</p>
<p>And frankly, none of us went to Italy for Jekyll&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>We went to the other guy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We went to the other guy&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p>Yeah. Jekyll&rsquo;s birthday is like COVID.</p>
<p>He keeps trying to bring it back in different variants.</p>
<p>And no one wants any part of it.</p>
<p>So on the last night, the last night of the trip,</p>
<p>we had the Jekyll birthday party.</p>
<p>And what do they serve? Pizza.</p>
<p>I mean, like because it&rsquo;s on Jekyll&rsquo;s dime.</p>
<p>I mean, the rest of the week, we had this like magnificent five star.</p>
<p>I think you throw my birthday party for me, Saks.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t even throw in any breadsticks.</p>
<p>I mean, he was like he just door dash dominoes.</p>
<p>We had truffle pizza.</p>
<p>I will say it was delicious.</p>
<p>I think it was the best meal.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re just a little jealous because the dinner you hosted</p>
<p>maybe didn&rsquo;t hit the notes you wanted to hit, Saks.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Are you serious?</p>
<p>We brought it.</p>
<p>I mean, he flew in a fucking troop from the food.</p>
<p>I was talking about the pizza versus, you know, by the way,</p>
<p>I just want to say that that whole circus thing in the in the water.</p>
<p>I got so mad at one of my kids because it was so dark</p>
<p>and the kids were in the pool and he kept diving.</p>
<p>Yes. And I kept saying, stop.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see you.</p>
<p>And so I was just like he never none of the kids should have been in the pool.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>And the truth of the matter is, you know, my five years old was in the pool, too.</p>
<p>And all I could do was keep an eye on him.</p>
<p>And I was so worried about it.</p>
<p>I was playing lifeguard with my family.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t enjoy the show for that reason.</p>
<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>They had the time of their lives.</p>
<p>Yes, they loved it.</p>
<p>And actually, that was that was definitely worth it.</p>
<p>And the day before, I want to give credit to Saks because Saks and I</p>
<p>went down to that restaurant and we made them open up the wine closet.</p>
<p>We raided it.</p>
<p>We found the best three bottles of wine and we brought them back for everybody.</p>
<p>Oh, and then and then I&rsquo;m not sure if you remember this.</p>
<p>We taped an episode of Colin in which I was a little drunk.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was drunk. I was confused.</p>
<p>Yeah. So anyway, the whole world can listen to us drunk on Colin.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re launching on September 2nd.</p>
<p>So, oh, yeah. Nice. Congrats.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s going to be a big deal.</p>
<p>And congratulations to the all in syndicate members</p>
<p>who wet their beaks and to my syndicate members.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t know this, but it was the absolute record</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve ever had for any syndicate.</p>
<p>I believe at the end of the day, we had 150 slots and we had 950 people.</p>
<p>Apply Saks.</p>
<p>Amazing. We had a million or so in allocation.</p>
<p>And I think we had seven million in demand.</p>
<p>I am really excited.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really going to be huge.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m really excited about this product.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best product I&rsquo;ve been involved in creating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than Yammer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than PayPal.</p>
<p>Truly. Oh, spicy take.</p>
<p>Yeah. Wow.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>Daddy, Daddy got a little taste.</p>
<p>Saks, don&rsquo;t hurt your.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hurt your elbow patting yourself on the back there, but go ahead.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a little.</p>
<p>You got a little product manager elbow there.</p>
<p>Pat yourself on the back.</p>
<p>Dislocate your tricep.</p>
<p>Feedback we&rsquo;ve gotten from users has been incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just the reactions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s good about it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s what I think you nailed</p>
<p>as a person who&rsquo;s been in podcasting for over a decade.</p>
<p>The critical</p>
<p>aspect of this is when you pop up your club or room on call in,</p>
<p>it creates a podcast out of it with an RSS feed</p>
<p>and you can go listen to the previous show.</p>
<p>So if you are listening to this and you wanted to create</p>
<p>your own version of all in, you could do it on call</p>
<p>and just get three of your knucklehead friends and talk about your adventures</p>
<p>on boats and private jets and drinking fine wine wherever you are.</p>
<p>And you can start your own podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not really expensive.</p>
<p>Why not included? Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the key insight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the show.</p>
<p>You know, like everything we think of as social audio</p>
<p>is really just a feature of creating a show, creating a new podcast.</p>
<p>And so anyway, people really like it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited.</p>
<p>September shows have been created in the beta.</p>
<p>This is the thing that&rsquo;s blown me away is like well over 100.</p>
<p>I think maybe a couple of hundred.</p>
<p>If you go to the show directory and the cover art that people have created</p>
<p>is really elaborate.</p>
<p>You know, people are really getting into it.</p>
<p>I said this before.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re a phenomenal you&rsquo;re a phenomenal product builder.</p>
<p>So I think this is really exciting under underrated product builder, I would say.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just interesting that this doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Somebody should have made this already.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s Zencaster and Riverside for recording podcasts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Lipson for hosting them.</p>
<p>What what&rsquo;s happened as a as a protected minority?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask this question.</p>
<p>What happens? What&rsquo;s happening to clubhouse?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s irrelevant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t want to dunk on founders, but I think that</p>
<p>they why can&rsquo;t they just do these features?</p>
<p>It sounds I mean, I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not trying to guarantee you</p>
<p>they will copy sexist features for sure.</p>
<p>I think they will copy it at some point.</p>
<p>Yeah, but but I think that it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>And I really think there&rsquo;s different visions here.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I&rsquo;ve listened to their founder talk about his vision,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very much about creating this live serendipitous type experience,</p>
<p>like kind of like a cocktail party.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine. We&rsquo;re not doing that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re creating long tail podcasting is what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And my experience is informed by what we&rsquo;ve all been doing</p>
<p>on the show for last year and a half, which is podcasting. Right.</p>
<p>And the thing that I&rsquo;ve seen that I didn&rsquo;t know until we did the all in pod</p>
<p>is how much work goes into what Jake does behind the scenes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>We got Nick doing six hours of post production on the show.</p>
<p>I want to automate all that work away so anybody can do what we do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a very different vision.</p>
<p>No offense, Nick.</p>
<p>No, I mean, not everybody is going to want to</p>
<p>put the type of post production into this.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have you know, I&rsquo;ve got six people on our podcast team.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not everybody&rsquo;s got that infrastructure.</p>
<p>So over time, you&rsquo;ll build that, I believe it will turn out great.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s get to our first topic here.</p>
<p>While we were away.</p>
<p>The United States started the process of leaving Afghanistan</p>
<p>after a 20 year war in which I think it&rsquo;s pretty safe to say</p>
<p>that was an unwinnable war.</p>
<p>And we have felt like the Russians did.</p>
<p>Sachs had a tweet that was getting a little bit of play on the old Twitter.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re seeing before our eyes is the collapse of the American empire</p>
<p>because the people in charge are completely corrupt and incompetent.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t talk about that</p>
<p>because insiders can never criticize other insiders.</p>
<p>The Larry Summers rule.</p>
<p>Did I tweet that?</p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you might have had a couple of drinks.</p>
<p>And then sorry, he actually didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He just texted that in the group.</p>
<p>OK, so that was a confidential text to our thought, to our group</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not supposed to even say exists.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s OK. Don&rsquo;t beep it. It&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not exactly what I tweeted, but it&rsquo;s similar to things I&rsquo;ve been tweeting.</p>
<p>And tragically, yesterday,</p>
<p>ISIS-K, which is an Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State,</p>
<p>claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings outside of the airport.</p>
<p>And that tragically killed over 100 people,</p>
<p>90 Afghan citizens and 13 American service members.</p>
<p>I guess, you know, we&rsquo;re not here to talk about wars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly in the mandate, but everybody wants our opinion on this.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>Saks, you have strong opinions. We&rsquo;ll start.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s how can you not talk about this?</p>
<p>This feels to me, this is one of those events where, you know,</p>
<p>I was glued to my TV for days.</p>
<p>I think I was in France at the time the Taliban overrun, overran Kabul.</p>
<p>And yeah, it was, you know, the Afghanistan war&rsquo;s been going on for 20 years.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s been talking about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this thing that&rsquo;s been happening in the background.</p>
<p>But all along, we&rsquo;ve been assured by the Pentagon that we&rsquo;re winning.</p>
<p>Hey, you know, don&rsquo;t worry about this. We got this.</p>
<p>And then you wake up one day and all of a sudden we&rsquo;ve lost the war</p>
<p>and the Taliban&rsquo;s overrunning the country.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, what is going on here?</p>
<p>You know, not only is the the botched withdrawal incompetent,</p>
<p>the fact that we were lied to for two decades about what was really happening,</p>
<p>the idea that we had created, you know, we were how many times were we told</p>
<p>that we had created this Afghan army? It was 300 strong.</p>
<p>We spent, you know, two trillion dollars in the country, you know, being.</p>
<p>And we were told the whole time that we were building institutions there,</p>
<p>that, you know, that we were creating a democracy in the Middle East,</p>
<p>that we were even, you know, promoting gender equality</p>
<p>and lecturing the Taliban on toxic masculinity or something like that.</p>
<p>And then we find out one day that, poof, the whole thing was just kind of a lie.</p>
<p>It was this giant debacle.</p>
<p>And now we can&rsquo;t even get our we can&rsquo;t even get our civilians out of the country.</p>
<p>Not only that, but we&rsquo;ve seen 12 people, 12 American servicemen and women killed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, trying to 13, trying to protect the airport,</p>
<p>almost 100 Afghans.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;d only have to not only contend with the Taliban,</p>
<p>whose positions I don&rsquo;t think any of us know about,</p>
<p>but we also have to deal with ISIS-K, which is like some, you know, offshoot</p>
<p>affiliate of ISIS run by a guy who was actually summarily killed by the Taliban.</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t clearly stop anybody.</p>
<p>The the level of.</p>
<p>Honestly, just to say the the the lying that we&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>On this topic is just utterly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really scary.</p>
<p>You know, how could we have gone 20 years, two trillion dollars,</p>
<p>2400 American lives and counting and found a way to just basically waste</p>
<p>all this money and tell ourselves these lies for so long?</p>
<p>And it turns out none of it was true.</p>
<p>And then the back half of it is that.</p>
<p>We look like a little bit of a country that&rsquo;s sort of in decline</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t even figure out an orderly withdrawal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if, you know, this thing came out of the blue, out of nowhere.</p>
<p>This was a negotiated withdrawal.</p>
<p>So we had months to plan for this, you know, and we had months</p>
<p>to do the right honorable moral thing for all of these</p>
<p>for for all of these people that helped us in that country.</p>
<p>Just to give you a small anecdote.</p>
<p>You know, the day that Kabul was overrun, you know, the Democrats</p>
<p>were actually tweeting out about celebrating Librarian Day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they were focused on.</p>
<p>Jason and I, on the way back, you know, we flew back with my</p>
<p>with my mom and my sister.</p>
<p>We stopped in Toronto to drop them off.</p>
<p>And the planes beside us.</p>
<p>Jason, do you remember this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I think Brett or Paul were telling us</p>
<p>my pilots were telling us</p>
<p>these planes have been going back and forth.</p>
<p>Saving refugees in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, wow, what an honor to just be beside these</p>
<p>these amazingly heroic men and women.</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t know, Jason, if you saw, but as we were refueling,</p>
<p>they came and boarded and they were getting ready to leave again.</p>
<p>Wow. Meanwhile, that America cannot get</p>
<p>even to a point of view on the topic.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so shameful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like not only do we spend the money, not only do we lose all these lives,</p>
<p>not only didn&rsquo;t we have an orderly withdrawal,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t even at the end guarantee the safety of Americans or</p>
<p>do the right thing for all these people who risk their lives</p>
<p>to help us fight clearly a useless war.</p>
<p>Freeberg, you have lots watching all this.</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t like when we delve into politics too much.</p>
<p>But what do you have?</p>
<p>Any thoughts you want to add? Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about politics as much as</p>
<p>I kind of use a little bit of a startup analogy.</p>
<p>Like America never really found product market fit</p>
<p>with what we were trying to do in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some fantastic</p>
<p>Gallup polling that&rsquo;s been done in Afghanistan over the past</p>
<p>15, 20 years already, and they&rsquo;ve actually had people on the ground polling there.</p>
<p>And most recently, which has been consistent for over 10 years,</p>
<p>polling shown that 87 to 90% of Afghans</p>
<p>said that the government is corrupt.</p>
<p>This is the government, you know, put in power, put in place by the United States.</p>
<p>90% say businesses are corrupt.</p>
<p>And if you go back to a poll they ran in 2010, the question was, in general,</p>
<p>which of these statements comes closest to your point of view?</p>
<p>Sharia law must be the only source of legislation.</p>
<p>56% of the Afghan population in 2010 believed that to be true.</p>
<p>And another 38% said Sharia law must be a source of legislation,</p>
<p>but not the only source.</p>
<p>That leaves just 7% of people that think that Sharia law should not be.</p>
<p>Is it Sharia or Sharia?</p>
<p>Sharia, sorry, Sharia law should not be part of the legislative process</p>
<p>in defining the Afghan laws and constitution.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it&rsquo;s really telling that, you know, it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>when you when you start a company and you try and create a product</p>
<p>and you sell it to a customer base, you got to figure out what the product is.</p>
<p>You got to make sure the customers want it.</p>
<p>And then the idea for the startup works.</p>
<p>The problem here is our views as a nation</p>
<p>and maybe Western democracy doesn&rsquo;t necessarily fit with what that market wants.</p>
<p>And we can certainly make the case that we believe that our ethics</p>
<p>and our values are superior and provide more of an opportunity</p>
<p>for individual freedom and liberty, things that we believe</p>
<p>should be available around the world.</p>
<p>But if the market&rsquo;s not buying it, the customers don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really just raising a ton of venture money,</p>
<p>trying to create a product that no one really wants.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re a trillion dollars down</p>
<p>and you have to shut the thing down and it goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s effectively what went down here.</p>
<p>And if you look at the history of Afghanistan, remember,</p>
<p>they were in the Soviet-Afghan war in the 80s, nearly the entire decade of the 80s.</p>
<p>Then the Taliban came along and provided a degree of stability in the 90s.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, this Al Qaeda 9-11 war began,</p>
<p>you know, after Taliban had been in power for a year.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been 20 plus years of strife and 20 years of strife and challenge</p>
<p>where the population have increasingly viewed the government to be corrupt,</p>
<p>businesses to be corrupt.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a really interesting statistic,</p>
<p>which also came out of this polling that Gallup does.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years, the percentage of Afghans that are happy</p>
<p>with their present household income has gone or are not happy.</p>
<p>Sorry, with their present household income has gone from 60% to 90%.</p>
<p>Nine out of 10 Afghans as of last year</p>
<p>were not making enough money to make ends meet.</p>
<p>So you put all of these facts together, you&rsquo;ve got this long history of strife</p>
<p>with this company effectively coming in, trying to tell you</p>
<p>how to run your government, how to run your country</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t match with your beliefs on the way you think a government should be built.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got all of this turmoil that&rsquo;s happened historically.</p>
<p>You know, it really was, I would say, to some degree,</p>
<p>this inevitable failure of a startup that got overfunded,</p>
<p>that never found product market fit, that never really got off the ground.</p>
<p>Certainly the exit strategy on how do you wind something down in this case,</p>
<p>and it certainly relates to human lives.</p>
<p>And the tragedy of the partners that we had on the ground</p>
<p>was was totally mishandled.</p>
<p>But the broader picture here is like, I think it&rsquo;s more corrupt than that.</p>
<p>I think that we basically engage in a $2 trillion wealth transfer</p>
<p>from the people of the United States, the citizens of the United States,</p>
<p>to the military industrial complex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we did.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I have two points I want to I want to build on</p>
<p>from from yours, Friedberg, and now yours, Chamath, which is</p>
<p>the original mandate here was to go and get rid of Al Qaeda and to also</p>
<p>you know, kill Osama bin Laden and to not have the Taliban</p>
<p>giving safe harbor to Al Qaeda that quick that mission got accomplished</p>
<p>in large part in the first year or two.</p>
<p>And then when we finally got to Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, I think</p>
<p>it probably would have been a better idea to understand this is an unwinnable war.</p>
<p>Get in there, destroy the Taliban, leave and then say, if you come back,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do it again.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not going to stay here for 20 years.</p>
<p>To your point, Friedberg, and try to create a revolution</p>
<p>if the people are not ready for it.</p>
<p>I think that we have to start looking at our foreign policy and saying</p>
<p>we do need we do have a better view of human rights clearly</p>
<p>than the Middle East and certainly Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And we do want to promote human rights around the world and freedom.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not doing that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not we&rsquo;re not we&rsquo;re not freedom fighters of democracy or justice.</p>
<p>We should be. We should be.</p>
<p>We are led by motives of revenue and profit.</p>
<p>I know that. But we should be.</p>
<p>And when we went and we kicked the Nazis asses and we beat Japan</p>
<p>when, you know, they were trying to dominate the world,</p>
<p>we were doing it to stop communism.</p>
<p>And I think when you look at nation building in these these kind of revolutions,</p>
<p>to Friedberg&rsquo;s point, they have to want it as well.</p>
<p>So we should be working with the countries that are teetering</p>
<p>on going from authoritarianism to democracy.</p>
<p>I just we should take the high ground and we should be the moral authority</p>
<p>of the world, because if we&rsquo;re not, who&rsquo;s going to be?</p>
<p>I agree with that part.</p>
<p>But I think the right thing to do is just to open our doors and say,</p>
<p>you know what? We&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a draft. Right.</p>
<p>And the smart and the capable and the willing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re willing to basically bring inside of our borders</p>
<p>so that they can work on our behalf.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what other countries, I think, get right about all of this stuff.</p>
<p>Like, again, as a Canadian,</p>
<p>you know, the Canadian perspective of this is not that you deploy troops</p>
<p>and you get embroiled in these, you know, debacles over 20 years</p>
<p>and thousands of lives and trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the exact opposite.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there to support humanitarian efforts, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there to send peacekeeping forces as they need to.</p>
<p>But otherwise, their real response is to actually then open the borders</p>
<p>for folks that want to be there, who are then wanting to trade up</p>
<p>Jason to those values, because that&rsquo;s the simple way to self-select.</p>
<p>Instead of saying, I&rsquo;m going to impose my version of democracy over there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually going to show you what our version looks like over here.</p>
<p>And if you want to come, the doors are open.</p>
<p>Certainly being an example is step one.</p>
<p>And we, I think, do that largely well.</p>
<p>But we do need to sometimes intervene.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the question here is, when is it just to intervene</p>
<p>when there is human rights on the line</p>
<p>and a country is teetering on authoritarianism or democracy?</p>
<p>Like, where is that line?</p>
<p>The just cause here was to go get Osama bin Laden because he attacked us.</p>
<p>And we should have gotten out of that country</p>
<p>as soon as we realized that bin Laden was no longer there.</p>
<p>I mean, that was basically after the Battle of Tora Bora.</p>
<p>And if we didn&rsquo;t leave then, we certainly should have left</p>
<p>after we got bin Laden in around 2010.</p>
<p>So what were you still doing there?</p>
<p>We were engaged in this exercise of nation building, which, by the way,</p>
<p>we spent six trillion dollars on nation building exercises</p>
<p>in the Middle East between Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>For what? For not.</p>
<p>This is why the electorate is in such a foul mood.</p>
<p>How many of our domestic disputes are caused by the fact</p>
<p>that we squandered that six trillion dollars?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more than Biden&rsquo;s entire domestic agenda.</p>
<p>You know, so we wasted all this money.</p>
<p>To Freiburg&rsquo;s point, we never understood the culture there.</p>
<p>And to Chamath&rsquo;s point, it was a giant money</p>
<p>funneling operation to defense contractors.</p>
<p>There was a great piece of reporting by an independent journalist</p>
<p>named Michael Tracy, and he talked to frontline grunts</p>
<p>about the wasteful spending.</p>
<p>You know, they had sent 12 Humvees</p>
<p>to some local Afghan partner.</p>
<p>Only two of them would ever get there.</p>
<p>The other 10 would break down and disappear.</p>
<p>No one would even know where all the money went.</p>
<p>It was like an unbelievable orgy of wastefulness.</p>
<p>And, you know, one other important detail on this, there&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>who I think should be much more famous to all of us.</p>
<p>His name is John F. Sopko.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the special inspector general for Afghanistan Reconstruction.</p>
<p>That short for cigar.</p>
<p>He was appointed by Congress about 13 years ago</p>
<p>to look into what was really happening in Afghanistan</p>
<p>and to report on, quote, unquote, lessons learned from the Afghan war.</p>
<p>And so for 13 years, Sopko has been very quietly, diligently</p>
<p>interviewing people, everyone from frontline troops to commanders</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s really been happening in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been releasing these reports that everyone in D.C.</p>
<p>knows about, but nobody in the country knows about.</p>
<p>Let me just read you.</p>
<p>These are just the chapter titles from his latest report.</p>
<p>OK, Jesus, just the chapter titles.</p>
<p>Harmful spending patterns, resistance to honesty, personnel struggles,</p>
<p>willful disregard for critical information, incorrect theories of change,</p>
<p>poor understanding of local context.</p>
<p>And by the way, that includes ignoring things like the sexual abuse</p>
<p>of young boys by Afghan warlords who are allies.</p>
<p>OK, which The New York Times reported on.</p>
<p>We completely have swept that under the rug.</p>
<p>OK, that&rsquo;s just a table of contents.</p>
<p>OK, from one of his latest reports, which is about 100 pages,</p>
<p>a complete incompetence on our in our government, complete waste.</p>
<p>The Pentagon was telling us the whole time.</p>
<p>I mean, while this guy Sopko, the cigar, the special inspector general</p>
<p>was telling us the truth of what was happening.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the Pentagon telling us and the elected leaders</p>
<p>the whole time that we&rsquo;re winning this war, that things are improving.</p>
<p>They had all these bogus metrics to prove it.</p>
<p>And, you know, and so it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a systemic failure.</p>
<p>But sex, what would be their motivation to say it&rsquo;s not working?</p>
<p>Look, I think I think that, well, right, will be the motivation, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t fix what you don&rsquo;t measure.</p>
<p>And so basically, like if you want to lie there, there you have it.</p>
<p>We have that now for 20 years of lying.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the metrics, because this is actually an important point.</p>
<p>But this is my point is like, what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the objective for them to be measured?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the objective in that case?</p>
<p>The objective is to demonstrate the objective is to demonstrate leadership.</p>
<p>The objective is to basically say, you know what, this is really not working.</p>
<p>And this is about putting yourself in the position</p>
<p>of a person whose child is over there, OK?</p>
<p>If any of our children were there who signed up because they thought</p>
<p>they wanted to do the right thing and and and, you know, be in the army</p>
<p>or the Navy or the Marines found themselves in Afghanistan,</p>
<p>got killed, God, heaven forbid.</p>
<p>And then that body comes back and this report comes with it.</p>
<p>Which is effectively what it is.</p>
<p>OK, this is the coda to the death of two point, you know, 2400 Americans</p>
<p>and two trillion dollars.</p>
<p>I would be so heartbroken.</p>
<p>I am heartbroken just thinking about this.</p>
<p>Like this is not that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re about.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t keep doing this and we can&rsquo;t keep lying.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t rationalize lying anymore.</p>
<p>Right. Well, I agree with that.</p>
<p>And let me just speak to the point about the metrics,</p>
<p>because the problem was not that we didn&rsquo;t have any metrics.</p>
<p>The problem is that the metrics are bogus.</p>
<p>Now, why is that?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, the mission was very unclear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear how you measure the success</p>
<p>of transforming a country to Afghanistan, like Afghanistan, to our values.</p>
<p>I mean, what what really are the metrics for that?</p>
<p>So what the military started doing is not measuring outputs,</p>
<p>but measuring inputs.</p>
<p>So you have, you know, the commanders on the ground saying, well, today</p>
<p>we trained a thousand new Afghan troops, OK?</p>
<p>But what they don&rsquo;t say is that over 90 percent of those troops are illiterate</p>
<p>and 85 percent of them are on drugs.</p>
<p>I mean, and this is what the journalists who are on the ground</p>
<p>when they would do the interviews with these, you know, with these,</p>
<p>you know, frontline commanders or trainers, they would find this out.</p>
<p>Now, why wasn&rsquo;t this in the report?</p>
<p>Well, because the military is a culture that&rsquo;s based on advancement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically the Pentagon is a big country club.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big insiders club.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dogma.</p>
<p>The dogma was we&rsquo;re winning the war.</p>
<p>And if you want to advance that organization, you&rsquo;re not going to be the one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be the skunk at the garden party</p>
<p>who tells the generals that they&rsquo;re full of shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically the guy who gives them the metrics they want to hear.</p>
<p>And then their boss, the person who&rsquo;s the boss of the frontline guy</p>
<p>is going to improve things 20 percent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to shape things another 20 percent.</p>
<p>And then the next guy in the chain of command shapes things 20 percent.</p>
<p>And by the time you get all the way to the top,</p>
<p>the chairman of the chiefs is telling Biden, we have an army</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s three hundred thousand strong.</p>
<p>These guys are going to take over the country.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to have a problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have plenty of time to get our people out.</p>
<p>And that is why we had a lackadaisical withdrawal strategy.</p>
<p>These guys thought they had all the time in the world</p>
<p>because systemically they&rsquo;ve been bullshitting themselves</p>
<p>about having a 300,000 man Afghan army.</p>
<p>And then, you know, when you actually look under the hood of this thing,</p>
<p>there is no army.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just basically a bunch of kleptocracy.</p>
<p>I think what happened at the end of this thing</p>
<p>is even more dangerous for the future, on top of everything you said, David,</p>
<p>which I agree with, is that what we basically said is that we will engage</p>
<p>in whatever cover up is necessary because we&rsquo;re not willing to lead</p>
<p>and talk about the mistakes we&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>and to do the things that are necessary to really fix it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really fucking sad, because as he said, as you said,</p>
<p>the minute that you knew that bin Laden wasn&rsquo;t there, we had a choice.</p>
<p>Then the minute you knew that he was already dead, we had a choice.</p>
<p>And the choice was to do the fucking right thing.</p>
<p>And instead, what happened was we got caught up in virtue signaling.</p>
<p>We got caught up in personal advancement.</p>
<p>We got caught up in the grift.</p>
<p>We got caught up in graft.</p>
<p>We got caught up in corruption.</p>
<p>We got caught up in the, you know, military industrial complex.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>And the crazy thing is, Biden had a moment.</p>
<p>Where he could have stepped in and said, you know what, guys,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at all of this data, here&rsquo;s the new plan.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t do it either.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>If Biden had run an orderly exit</p>
<p>and then it spiraled into Taliban and reverted back to what it was,</p>
<p>how would you feel about all this?</p>
<p>I think that would have been that&rsquo;s the goal, right?</p>
<p>Trump wanted to get out.</p>
<p>Yes. And Biden both wanted to get executed twice as good or 50% better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be no problem here.</p>
<p>We all want to be out, correct?</p>
<p>Yes, that that decision, the decision to get out was a 70% popular decision</p>
<p>when Biden made the decision in April.</p>
<p>And then they made it last time because he did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So this is a bipartisan decision to get out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>It was clearly the correct decision to get out.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s where Biden screwed it up, OK?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some blame that needs to be apportioned to Biden</p>
<p>and to the to the generals.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really know who screwed it up, but collectively they did.</p>
<p>The big mistake, the original sin of this withdrawal</p>
<p>is that they pulled out of Bagram Airfield at the beginning of July.</p>
<p>OK, they didn&rsquo;t just pull out.</p>
<p>They literally ghosted the Afghan.</p>
<p>I mean, they pulled out in the middle of the night without telling anybody.</p>
<p>The Afghans army, who are our allies, woke up the next morning</p>
<p>and the Americans were just gone and the electricity had been turned off.</p>
<p>I mean, this was unbelievable.</p>
<p>And so the problem is we then lost our air superiority over the country.</p>
<p>We lost our ability to conduct close combat air support.</p>
<p>We lost our ability to do a mass evacuation.</p>
<p>OK, we basically gave up our central military asset in the country</p>
<p>before we got the civilians out, before we got our allies out.</p>
<p>And there were 18,000 of these so-called civs, the special immigration visas.</p>
<p>These are the Afghani translators and helpers</p>
<p>who are embedded in our combat unit units.</p>
<p>We the State Department, meanwhile, was totally caught up</p>
<p>in bureaucracy, slow walking their applications.</p>
<p>Those 18,000 translators are now stuck there.</p>
<p>OK, they have 50,000 dependents.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about spouses and children.</p>
<p>And so they have no way of getting out.</p>
<p>And then the final thing that just takes the cake</p>
<p>is that we gave a list to the Taliban of here&rsquo;s our biggest helpers.</p>
<p>When if they go to the checkpoints, we want you to let them.</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s basically an assassination.</p>
<p>This is a kill list given a kill list to the Taliban.</p>
<p>I mean, this is really unforgivable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s and this was it&rsquo;s not like this was unknown.</p>
<p>OK, there was a bipartisan working group of both Democrats and Republicans</p>
<p>who wrote a letter to Blinken at the State Department back in May</p>
<p>saying we are afraid of the about the safety of our Afghan allies.</p>
<p>You need to get them out now.</p>
<p>The State Department is taking too long processing the special immigration visas.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re totally caught up in red tape bureaucracies solve this problem.</p>
<p>Blinken did nothing.</p>
<p>He was another deer caught in the headlights.</p>
<p>They could have also just</p>
<p>instead of making people fill out all these forms and all this red tape.</p>
<p>I heard one comment or saying like the right thing to do in situations</p>
<p>like this is to just get everybody out, put them in a holding</p>
<p>location and then process them there.</p>
<p>In other words, if this person says they were translating their family</p>
<p>and they have, you know, relatively good paperwork, get them out,</p>
<p>put them into that holding pattern and then figure out how to process them later.</p>
<p>We got to wrap on this discussion, get to some other topics.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing to watch here is what&rsquo;s going to be the future</p>
<p>of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw the Financial Times story,</p>
<p>but China is watching this like a hawk.</p>
<p>And they China and Russia are just sitting there laughing.</p>
<p>Well, China is even worse.</p>
<p>They have aspirations of partnership in this region</p>
<p>with Pakistan already and Afghanistan and building super highways</p>
<p>and expanding their train network and having their own Silk Road,</p>
<p>essentially, to get to the Middle East from China.</p>
<p>And this is going to be the axis of the United States</p>
<p>authoritarianism by Biden.</p>
<p>And I even asked Putin if it was OK for us to stage military resources from.</p>
<p>You know, from from from close quarters in Asia,</p>
<p>then Putin was like, no, go, Jason, I think what you just pointed out</p>
<p>is the motivating factor for having a presence</p>
<p>in this and other similar similarly situated territories around the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of people assume it&rsquo;s about imperialism</p>
<p>and imposing kind of American democratic principles and ideals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way the narrative is sold internally here in this country.</p>
<p>But the truth from the intelligence community, and I think the folks</p>
<p>that maybe are a little bit more thoughtful and long term</p>
<p>thinking about this sort of stuff is that the absence of an American</p>
<p>presence in certain parts of the world will enable</p>
<p>the the success of what we would consider competing states globally.</p>
<p>And, you know, there is still that unanswered question, ultimately,</p>
<p>of how do we compete on a global stage,</p>
<p>given what is currently</p>
<p>a very negative view on our having a presence overseas,</p>
<p>a military presence overseas, a physical presence overseas</p>
<p>in these sorts of territories?</p>
<p>And it begs the question of does that really set us up for challenges</p>
<p>and failures in the 21st century as a nation state,</p>
<p>as the other global players, in particular China,</p>
<p>you know, take advantage of these openings?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I agree with that.</p>
<p>And let me just let me just say why China is so smart and we are so dumb.</p>
<p>China is going to Afghanistan right now and cutting deals with the Taliban</p>
<p>to build a highway so they can get to the rare earth minerals,</p>
<p>which Afghanistan is rich in.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to use the superhighway they&rsquo;re going to build</p>
<p>to get that out and feed their economy.</p>
<p>That is how they&rsquo;re going to spend their capital in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we spent over two trillion and we have nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>You know, they go abroad in search of rare earth minerals.</p>
<p>We go there to lecture people on toxic masculinity.</p>
<p>It is absurd. OK.</p>
<p>Now, the president.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a little too cynical.</p>
<p>We were also protecting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not educating women in that country.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget the pronouns.</p>
<p>Yes, we go to the pronouns.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s them. They them. It&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. We go there to lecture people on their pronouns.</p>
<p>No, that is far too cynical.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>We went there to protect some people who wanted democracy</p>
<p>and to allow women to read and to be.</p>
<p>Oh, we just decided we just flushed that.</p>
<p>We just flushed that right down the toilet.</p>
<p>Sorry, I know that we do not conflate that.</p>
<p>We just want to lecture.</p>
<p>But David, David is right.</p>
<p>We knew that the minute we pulled out, we were casting 50 percent</p>
<p>of that population to a complete state of stasis</p>
<p>that was completely not known.</p>
<p>So are you saying that we should have stayed there with some presence?</p>
<p>Well, this is this is like the argument in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell the truth.</p>
<p>We should have just told the truth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re leaving. We don&rsquo;t have a plan.</p>
<p>And this is going to risk all women.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to risk people that helped us.</p>
<p>And we are not sure what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>We decided we&rsquo;re leaving.</p>
<p>That was the truth.</p>
<p>Remember, remember the Vietnam War?</p>
<p>We killed two million Vietnamese to make the country safe for democracy.</p>
<p>You know what the Vietnamese said at the end of that?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d rather have our two million people back.</p>
<p>We see these wars in terms of ideology.</p>
<p>We think we&rsquo;re going there to spread democracy.</p>
<p>They see it in terms of nationalism.</p>
<p>All they see is a foreign invader trying to impose their values.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t buy into what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And by the way, the whole idea that we&rsquo;re going to plant</p>
<p>Madisonian democracy in the soil of the Middle East,</p>
<p>that was a 20 year folly that cost us trillions.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons why there are no Madison&rsquo;s over there,</p>
<p>there are no Madison&rsquo;s, there are no Jefferson&rsquo;s, there are no Washington&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Who is going to take up that cause?</p>
<p>What we had in Afghanistan is this president Ghani, who&rsquo;s a crook</p>
<p>who was off on the first helicopter with millions of our dollars.</p>
<p>That is how stupid we are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the last place we should be trying to do democracy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other places where it&rsquo;s teetering and we can probably be more helpful.</p>
<p>The American president, John Quincy Adams.</p>
<p>This is back when America had a rational foreign policy.</p>
<p>He said America does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy.</p>
<p>That used to be our foreign policy.</p>
<p>Now we involve ourselves all over the world to impose our values for no reasons.</p>
<p>It is costing us a fortune and has led to the crumbling</p>
<p>of the America of American wealth and power.</p>
<p>And it completely erodes our trust in institutions,</p>
<p>particularly the institution of the federal government.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re left just scratching our heads, saying, if not these guys,</p>
<p>then who is going to figure this out?</p>
<p>What do we do with Taiwan?</p>
<p>If Chamath and Sachs, if you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want to be, if you don&rsquo;t want to support democracy in the world,</p>
<p>what happens to Taiwan in your world?</p>
<p>This sign Taiwan&rsquo;s death ward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but you should just assume that we should just let Taiwan go.</p>
<p>No, my point is the following.</p>
<p>Taiwan will, when the when PRC has the right window,</p>
<p>be under complete Chinese control.</p>
<p>And we because of how we have executed this and how we&rsquo;ve executed</p>
<p>the rest of our Middle Asia strategy means that we will not really engage.</p>
<p>And the reason is because it will be an enormous food fight</p>
<p>inside the United States where all of these past experiences</p>
<p>of us fucking this up will come up.</p>
<p>Should we defend Taiwan?</p>
<p>By the way, the difference is we&rsquo;re not going to we would not be going to war</p>
<p>with a bunch of like fucking tribal people in the mountains</p>
<p>carrying sticks and AK-47s from the 80s.</p>
<p>This is China.</p>
<p>So if we get if we if we can&rsquo;t beat and win in Afghanistan, I mean, we also</p>
<p>what are our chance?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sorry, guys, but chances alone, it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>With a group of Japan,</p>
<p>South Korea, Australia and the EU, we should be defending Taiwan.</p>
<p>In my mind. What do you think, Freeberg?</p>
<p>Should we try and defend Taiwan when this inevitably leads</p>
<p>to the Chinese government finding their window as Chamath is predicting?</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t think that the motivating factor</p>
<p>could necessarily be</p>
<p>imposing democratic principles as the priority.</p>
<p>If you were to to to actually weigh that decision,</p>
<p>you would realize that you should probably have a presence</p>
<p>in some Latin American countries.</p>
<p>You should probably have a presence in Central Africa</p>
<p>where there are authoritarian regimes that are doing terrible things.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t have a competing global interest there to defend against.</p>
<p>Well, to be clear, Taiwan is right now democratic.</p>
<p>So we would be defending a democracy.</p>
<p>Freeberg, Jake is asking a specific question.</p>
<p>If China invades Taiwan, do you think the United States should get involved?</p>
<p>On a principle basis, or do I think the United States will get involved?</p>
<p>Either one.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think the challenge is the escalation with China, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to be the big calculus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about what&rsquo;s the what&rsquo;s the long term cost?</p>
<p>Certainly on a on a principle basis, you&rsquo;d say, let&rsquo;s go defend the weak</p>
<p>and go protect them because they share principles and ideals with us.</p>
<p>But the backlash, the challenge would be if we were to do this,</p>
<p>global trade would stall.</p>
<p>There would be massive issues at home with people saying</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re getting involved in an overseas war.</p>
<p>All of the reasons that from a political perspective,</p>
<p>it would stall our economy, it would cause all these, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of speculating a bit here.</p>
<p>But the actual cost isn&rsquo;t just about sending a few thousand troops</p>
<p>over and surrounding the island and protecting people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually much more severe than that.</p>
<p>And if you were to weigh it, it could be that we end up with 25,</p>
<p>30 million people losing their jobs over the next decade</p>
<p>because of the economic fallout that occurs in our doing that and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And a lot of American prosperity that we get to enjoy,</p>
<p>you know, kind of kind of declines.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the real calculus.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how to do that calculus, but I think that is the calculus</p>
<p>that that is being done by the intelligence community</p>
<p>to figure out the answer to that question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s swing it to Sachs to do a little bit more of this calculus,</p>
<p>because what we&rsquo;re talking about here is not giving up an authoritarian state</p>
<p>that wants to be authoritarian.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a democracy on the risk board.</p>
<p>Yes. We take it and flipped from a democracy like Hong Kong has been flipped.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a I think it&rsquo;s a very important distinction</p>
<p>that Taiwan is already a democracy.</p>
<p>They got there on their own.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done a lot of hard work building that country.</p>
<p>Since that, basically, the country became separate from mainland China,</p>
<p>I think, in 1945, it&rsquo;s never been under the control of the CCP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a free enterprise system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s democratic capitalism.</p>
<p>There is basically 24 million free souls who live on that island.</p>
<p>And if we show any weakness and we frankly already have</p>
<p>by what we&rsquo;ve done in the Middle East, if we show any weakness,</p>
<p>they will fall under the boot of the communist regime.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a big difference between trying to plant democracy</p>
<p>or nation build verse in a country that&rsquo;s never had it before</p>
<p>in thousands of years and basically being friends and allies</p>
<p>with a country that already is a democracy and just wants to be free.</p>
<p>And I think our message to China should just be we like things the way they are.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want them to change. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>We have a policy of what&rsquo;s called strategic ambiguity to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It basically says that we may come to the defense of Taiwan or we may not.</p>
<p>And I think we should just continue with that policy.</p>
<p>I think our message should just be we like the status quo.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think it should change. Let&rsquo;s leave things alone.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But I think we need to be investing hundreds of billions.</p>
<p>The trillions of dollars we wasted in Afghanistan could have been better served</p>
<p>building an infrastructure in America for chips and semiconductors</p>
<p>and a bunch of these critical components,</p>
<p>because then it would give us a lot more bargaining room</p>
<p>to actually be able to play out that strategic ambiguity more fully.</p>
<p>I think the reality is that despite the policy framework,</p>
<p>the practical economic reality is that we would be engulfed in a war</p>
<p>if if Taiwan were taken over by China, because as Friedberg said,</p>
<p>our economy would ground to a halt because those critical assets are linchpins</p>
<p>for how massive swaths of the American economy work.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing we should be making plans for.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if our military is competent enough, but we&rsquo;ve talked on this pod</p>
<p>before about how what 70 percent of the advanced chips come out of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Companies like TSMC, if China takes over that island,</p>
<p>I mean, those chips are the new oil, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be dependent on them in a way we never should be for our supply chain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, Chamath.</p>
<p>We never should have gotten this dependent.</p>
<p>But frankly, our military needs to have a plan to sabotage those chip factories</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t let them fall under the control of the CCP.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re competent enough to do that.</p>
<p>But but if Taiwan falls, it needs to be a poison chalice for the CCP.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to need to make some decisions here because Russia with Crimea</p>
<p>and the Ukraine and their ambitions and then China taking over Hong Kong</p>
<p>and looking at Taiwan.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the lesson here is if you&rsquo;re a dictator</p>
<p>and you are allowed to take over other regions and other countries,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to stop is the nature of dictators.</p>
<p>And we have to at least put our foot down.</p>
<p>You know, Afghanistan&rsquo;s a shitshow.</p>
<p>But these other places were flat footed right now.</p>
<p>Jekyll, we&rsquo;re stumbling forward.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not a serious problem.</p>
<p>And so and so we need to we need to sort of like recenter ourselves and get momentum.</p>
<p>You know, you to use a poker analogy.</p>
<p>Yes. Basically, it&rsquo;s just bluffed off half our stack with the Jack 8 offsuit.</p>
<p>And then and then when you get the ace king suited, you have no chips to play with.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. You know, and you have to reestablish our credibility.</p>
<p>Basically, 9-11, 9-11 put us on tilt.</p>
<p>OK, and we&rsquo;ve been losing pots for the last 20 years.</p>
<p>Yeah. Now we just lost the big one.</p>
<p>And the question is, to Jamal&rsquo;s point, are we going to lose the rest of our stack</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re going to go take a walk around the block like Muth?</p>
<p>We center our center.</p>
<p>Time to recenter. Time to take a walk.</p>
<p>On the recentering thing,</p>
<p>China is going in the opposite direction in a way that could actually help us,</p>
<p>meaning like, you know, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a pretty scary</p>
<p>set of things that&rsquo;s happening over there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a kind of instructive about how we could recenter ourselves</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re actually enacting the laws that we all talk about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about for seven months, but they&rsquo;re actually willing to do it.</p>
<p>And they and so if American policymakers would actually give it to</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on over there with the China or should we go to robotics?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s finish China and then we can and then we can talk about</p>
<p>China is continuing their crackdown of tech companies</p>
<p>and has proposed a ban on foreign IPOs.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal had some exclusive reporting today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just read a quote and then hand it over to Chamath.</p>
<p>China plans to propose new rules that would ban companies</p>
<p>with large amounts of sensitive consumer data from going public in the US.</p>
<p>People familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>And in addition to that, under these new rules,</p>
<p>they are looking at the algorithms that are being run</p>
<p>and different services and making them transparent.</p>
<p>And the Chinese government will basically control the algorithms</p>
<p>that have caused so much chaos here in the United States</p>
<p>with Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.</p>
<p>And then finally, they&rsquo;re going to close the loophole on VIEs.</p>
<p>Chamath, you want to explain what this means from a market perspective?</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s a really big day because of these things, Jason, as you just said.</p>
<p>So let me just break this down, because I think it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>for us to all learn about this together.</p>
<p>So one thing is around the technology, which I&rsquo;ll talk about in a second,</p>
<p>which you just talked about and then previewed.</p>
<p>And then the second is around the capital markets and the money flow.</p>
<p>And that this is a really big deal.</p>
<p>So what is a VIE?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re going to hear this a lot.</p>
<p>A VIE is what&rsquo;s called a variable interest entity.</p>
<p>And what it is, is just a massive workaround.</p>
<p>So essentially what happened was a VIE was a legal business</p>
<p>where, you know, an entity had control of a company,</p>
<p>OK, through a contract, but not through equity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, Sachs, like I had a contract with Colin</p>
<p>that said, I can dictate, you know, who does what, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t own any equity.</p>
<p>Now, the company that completely ran afoul of all of these things was Enron.</p>
<p>And back in 2001, Enron went fucking ham, as we all know.</p>
<p>They had a bunch of these VIEs and they used it to basically shield</p>
<p>a bunch of losses and do a bunch of shady things.</p>
<p>So then there was a bunch of accounting laws that were introduced.</p>
<p>China.</p>
<p>On a completely separate track around that same time was like, hey, listen,</p>
<p>we want to control our economy, so we&rsquo;re going to prohibit foreign ownership.</p>
<p>So just for all you guys to know, China to this day</p>
<p>does not allow a foreigner to own a piece, large sections of the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>OK, so as of 2018, which is the last updated list, as far as I could find it,</p>
<p>there are 33 sectors of the economy where China says</p>
<p>you cannot be a foreigner and own any equity.</p>
<p>You have to have a local partner.</p>
<p>No, you cannot own any equity.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You want to start a business there.</p>
<p>You have to have like a partner like Yahoo did.</p>
<p>So all technology companies fall under this.</p>
<p>All data companies, any education company, any media company.</p>
<p>So you can imagine it&rsquo;s basically every part of the economy that matters.</p>
<p>And so because of all these restrictions, you know, the Chinese</p>
<p>Internet companies were like, hey, hold on a second.</p>
<p>I need to get access to the capital markets.</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>They dusted off the VIE structure and they basically created</p>
<p>all of these, you know, Cayman&rsquo;s holding companies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where all the American investors would go and buy equity</p>
<p>from or contribute equity to.</p>
<p>And so, you know, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Didi.com, JD,</p>
<p>all of these folks have these VIEs.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting about these VIEs is it&rsquo;s written clear as day,</p>
<p>but not a single investor seemed to care.</p>
<p>But in the prospectuses of these Chinese companies, they were clear.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you actually have a claim on the assets.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you can actually make a demand of management.</p>
<p>I mean, if you saw this in an American prospectus,</p>
<p>you would not put a single dollar into these companies.</p>
<p>But in fact, the exact opposite happened because people were greedy</p>
<p>and chasing the money.</p>
<p>And and these risks, by the way, came back to bear.</p>
<p>Because, Jason, I think you were the one that gave the example</p>
<p>of the Chinese tutoring guys where, you know, overnight</p>
<p>this guy lost ninety nine percent of his net worth.</p>
<p>I think this is a one or two pods ago.</p>
<p>The way they did that was that they canceled the VIEs.</p>
<p>They said online tutoring.</p>
<p>Nope. Sorry, these things can&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>And so essentially, we have the situation now</p>
<p>where VIEs are part of 58 companies,</p>
<p>massive Chinese mega cap companies that are in the huge indexes</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>These 58 companies account for two trillion dollars of market cap.</p>
<p>We are we are we are now in a situation now</p>
<p>where the Chinese government basically says for online tutoring,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to cancel the VIEs in a bunch of other areas.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to start with regulation.</p>
<p>We could cancel the VIEs later.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve essentially put the capital markets, in my opinion, on pause.</p>
<p>And so now let&rsquo;s transition to the markets in China.</p>
<p>Capital markets in China, I think now are the most volatile</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
<p>Essentially, the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, the government,</p>
<p>the CCP chooses how and who will make money.</p>
<p>And they are basically putting their foot down in a big way in the capital.</p>
<p>What happens to the one point six, two trillion in existing shares</p>
<p>that have been bought by people around the world?</p>
<p>Would there be some way to unravel that or a tender offer?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to delist these ADRs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t exactly know what would happen.</p>
<p>I think what happens is unprecedented. Am I correct?</p>
<p>No, you have capital loss, Jason, because when they canceled</p>
<p>the online tutoring VIEs, the stock prices basically went to zero.</p>
<p>So you could eviscerate two trillion dollars of market cap tomorrow</p>
<p>if they decide, you know what, that VIE for Alibaba, by the way, Nick,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send it to you.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a thing of art.</p>
<p>If you look at the VIE structure for BABA,</p>
<p>I mean, it is a fucking babushka doll of nesting entities and this or that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how any investor who bought shares in Alibaba</p>
<p>actually took the time to understand what they were actually buying.</p>
<p>They suspended disbelief because they were greedy.</p>
<p>So so the point is, that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>OK, so the the capital markets are now, I think, getting really constrained.</p>
<p>The complement to this is that they&rsquo;re starting to now introduce legislation</p>
<p>as a prelude, in my opinion, to canceling some of these VIEs</p>
<p>in the most important area that we care about, which is tech.</p>
<p>So, Jason, to your point, the Chinese cyberspace watchdog today</p>
<p>or yesterday, I think it was they just published a list of draft</p>
<p>regulations that will now become law.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to read this to you.</p>
<p>So let me just just FYI for you guys.</p>
<p>So let me just give you a sense of them.</p>
<p>Users must be provided with a convenient way to see and delete</p>
<p>all the keywords that an algorithm uses to profile them.</p>
<p>Number two, providers shall not have that.</p>
<p>Providers shall not record illegal and undesirable keywords</p>
<p>in the user points of interest or as user tags and push information content to them.</p>
<p>And they may not become discriminatory or biased based on that information.</p>
<p>Users must be informed that algorithms are being used on them</p>
<p>to recommend content or products to them, and they must be allowed to opt out</p>
<p>and see completely generic, non-personalized results.</p>
<p>The algorithm recommendation shall adhere to me.</p>
<p>This is incredible to mainstream values.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that means.</p>
<p>They must have harmony in China.</p>
<p>They must actively spread positive energy and promote the application</p>
<p>of algorithms for the better.</p>
<p>Providers shall regularly review and evaluate and verify</p>
<p>these algorithms, models and datas with these watchdogs.</p>
<p>These watchdogs will now start to increasingly take board seats</p>
<p>on the on on Chinese companies.</p>
<p>So you put these two things together.</p>
<p>It is a moment in China Tech.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a takeover. Yes, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, so some of those provisions sound like, you know, privacy regulations.</p>
<p>We might want to adopt over here completely, but I think we should focus</p>
<p>on the one towards the end that you mentioned.</p>
<p>The algorithm recommendation</p>
<p>source provider shall adhere to mainstream values, actively spread</p>
<p>positive energy and promote applications for the better.</p>
<p>Now, how do you actively spread positive energy?</p>
<p>I mean, as a business person under that regulation,</p>
<p>like what does that even mean?</p>
<p>I mean, it basically means it means what you&rsquo;re not spreading, David.</p>
<p>It means you&rsquo;re not spreading a protest in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>It means you&rsquo;re not talking about the Uyghurs.</p>
<p>It means you&rsquo;re not talking about Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not creating social unrest.</p>
<p>This is a way for them to say, you know, positive energy means</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t criticize Xi Jinping or the CCP or bring up topics</p>
<p>that are in the no fly zone like the Uyghurs.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re going to have content moderation guidelines.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re bringing it all under their control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the type of thing that despite all of our problems</p>
<p>makes me very happy to be an American.</p>
<p>Yeah. Can you I would say, though, that the first part of what I said</p>
<p>about the regulations to me seem really intelligent.</p>
<p>And I think Americans would want that.</p>
<p>And if American policymakers</p>
<p>would actually just suspend disbelief for a second, go to the Chinese website.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d Nick, we can put a link into the into the show notes</p>
<p>of where the regulations were published and actually try to implement those laws.</p>
<p>I think we as Americans, we&rsquo;d all want most of them except that one.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s what the devil does.</p>
<p>They mix the lies with the truth in order to get you to be convinced</p>
<p>to give up your freedoms.</p>
<p>Friedberg, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting increasingly convinced that this idea of decentralized</p>
<p>blockchain based government governing might work in the 21st century.</p>
<p>I just feel like they&rsquo;re the you know, we keep hearing more about the overreach</p>
<p>and the ineptitude of centralized institutions like</p>
<p>CCP and the US government and.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not hearing anyone that says, man, you know, this is a great.</p>
<p>Well, I think we&rsquo;re seeing great progress.</p>
<p>No, but Friedberg, I think I think the CCP is actually pretty good at what they do.</p>
<p>We may not agree with them, but I think they&rsquo;re trying to agree with you.</p>
<p>I agree with you generally. Yeah.</p>
<p>But I do think it creates an incentive and a motivation also,</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t agree with their principles.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re going to find yourself looking for an alternative.</p>
<p>So, you know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is probably not the right time or forum for this conversation.</p>
<p>We should probably do it on another show.</p>
<p>But we should talk about some of the innovations,</p>
<p>blockchain innovations that are taking place.</p>
<p>And Jake, I know you spent a lot of time on this as well, but, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be worth kind of talking about the notion that, you know, can you see</p>
<p>governing move to the blockchain?</p>
<p>And what does society look like in maybe the 22nd century</p>
<p>if this becomes a reality?</p>
<p>And how do we how does the world kind of evolve there?</p>
<p>Well, in the crypto world, you would put in some effort,</p>
<p>you would have some skin in the game and you would because of your</p>
<p>processing power, your nodes on the network would get some votes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be like in a democracy, how much money you had</p>
<p>or how much work you produced, you had some sort of say,</p>
<p>which kind of sounds like ours.</p>
<p>I mean, imagine if the US government, instead of, you know, having some folks</p>
<p>go to Congress and say, I want a trillion dollars and spend 25 years in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>You know, it was more of a distributed decision making process</p>
<p>where data was available in real time, metrics were used to make the decision.</p>
<p>And the folks that actually contributed dollars</p>
<p>to the network ended up being the ones that made the decisions</p>
<p>based on how many dollars they&rsquo;ve contributed</p>
<p>or based on some other principle of decision making</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t kind of aggregate institutional ineptitude,</p>
<p>which is kind of part of the issue we&rsquo;ve seen here.</p>
<p>Well, so I think that brings up an interesting point, which is, you know,</p>
<p>when we talk about all the ways that we could have spent</p>
<p>these trillions of dollars better than nation building, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the fundamental problem. I agree with that.</p>
<p>I mean, I wish we had spent the six trillion</p>
<p>that we spent on nation building in the Middle East.</p>
<p>I wish we had spent that at home domestically on our own priorities.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem is, I think what Afghanistan</p>
<p>and specifically the military industrial conflict shows is how good</p>
<p>these special interests get at extracting money from the system</p>
<p>while providing so little value.</p>
<p>You know, we spent these contractors spent or</p>
<p>they they charge so much to basically deliver so little in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Do you really think it&rsquo;s going to be much different for the trillion dollar,</p>
<p>the one point two trillion dollar infrastructure bill that&rsquo;s coming?</p>
<p>You know, and if we create it, they&rsquo;re licking their lips.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking. Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>The people, the groups are going to get that money,</p>
<p>who are going to feast on that trillion dollars are people</p>
<p>who their skill set is lobbying.</p>
<p>OK, that is what they spend their time doing.</p>
<p>Sorry, I think it&rsquo;s backwards.</p>
<p>No, listen, and if you are really good at lobbying,</p>
<p>why would you even waste your time trying to get good at delivering value?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not. That&rsquo;s your business is lobbying.</p>
<p>That is your value. Yeah, that is your skill set. Exactly.</p>
<p>So this idea that we can basically spend a trillion dollars</p>
<p>on some domestic innovation program.</p>
<p>The problem is it&rsquo;ll never go to the right people, never go to the innovators.</p>
<p>Hmm. The best thing we could do is just not spend the money, quite frankly.</p>
<p>So smaller government.</p>
<p>Or how about how about just not a government that&rsquo;s 20 trillion dollars in debt?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s like smaller or small government to</p>
<p>if we were to save six trillion, we&rsquo;d still be 14 trillion in debt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a small government.</p>
<p>I think a good jumping off point here might be the Supreme Court eviction</p>
<p>moratorium and the Supreme Court not upholding it.</p>
<p>And what are your thoughts on that, Sax?</p>
<p>Because it does relate to this never ending free money train.</p>
<p>No repercussions of personal behavior and,</p>
<p>you know, spending insanely forever.</p>
<p>It seems like we&rsquo;re never going to stop with the stimmies.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the Supreme Court threw out Biden&rsquo;s eviction moratorium.</p>
<p>As unconstitutional. Look, I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You know, the government should not be preventing eviction,</p>
<p>you know, especially not the federal government.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how this is supposed to work.</p>
<p>I mean, all you look, I don&rsquo;t want to see anybody get evicted.</p>
<p>But the reality is you have to pay your rent.</p>
<p>And if and if there are groups of people who can&rsquo;t pay the rent</p>
<p>and the government decides that that those people should be helped,</p>
<p>the right way to help them is to give them the money to pay their rent,</p>
<p>not just to tell landlords, sorry, like you can&rsquo;t collect rent.</p>
<p>Yes, Congress could give more stimulus to those people.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a taking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clear taking from landlords to say that, oh,</p>
<p>your tenants don&rsquo;t have to pay you anymore. How does that make sense?</p>
<p>Well, how do we unwind the free money train?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s 10 million job openings right now that are not getting filled.</p>
<p>And then we have unemployment starting to unwind or the bonus</p>
<p>unemployment, and then we have all this free rent concept</p>
<p>or just you don&rsquo;t have to pay your rent.</p>
<p>At some point, it feels like we have to let the free market come back</p>
<p>and maybe people can&rsquo;t pay their rent.</p>
<p>So they go take one of the 10 million jobs.</p>
<p>I know that sounds cold hearted.</p>
<p>No, Jason, you&rsquo;ve talked about this before in California.</p>
<p>We have a labor shortage in California.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve basically run a controlled experiment in the UBI,</p>
<p>the universal basic income where we&rsquo;ve basically been paying people</p>
<p>not to work or paying them regardless of whether they work.</p>
<p>Guess what? They don&rsquo;t take jobs.</p>
<p>And so we actually have a labor shortage in California</p>
<p>despite having high unemployment.</p>
<p>At some point, the government&rsquo;s going to have to say to people like, look,</p>
<p>COVID is not an excuse for shirking your adult responsibilities.</p>
<p>You know, we all have a responsibility to go to work, to pay our rent,</p>
<p>you know, to pay our parking tickets.</p>
<p>And COVID has been this excuse for suspending, you know,</p>
<p>this this sort of normal life.</p>
<p>And the problem is COVID is going to be around forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the cold or the flu.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t continue to be this excuse for people not working, not paying rent,</p>
<p>not doing what they&rsquo;re supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>I think on top of that, though, I think, Jason, maybe you want to talk about this.</p>
<p>I think on top of that, we</p>
<p>are amplifying that by taking people&rsquo;s agency away.</p>
<p>And we are Prop 22.</p>
<p>And Prop 22 is a perfect example of that, which you should talk about.</p>
<p>But when you put these two things together, on the one hand,</p>
<p>you have a government that basically</p>
<p>wants to subsidize opting out of the system.</p>
<p>And then you have a set of laws that if they&rsquo;re not unwound,</p>
<p>reinforce that dynamic.</p>
<p>And you put these two things together and folks just want to sit on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s get freeberg freeberg.</p>
<p>You want to talk about the Prop 22</p>
<p>Supreme Court decision, et cetera.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was an appeals court appeals.</p>
<p>You know, appeals court that overturned some elements of the California Prop 22,</p>
<p>which was a heavily lobbied California proposition lobbied by Uber and Lyft</p>
<p>and other businesses that have built effectively marketplaces</p>
<p>for independent contractors like drivers and delivery people and so on.</p>
<p>The SEIU, which is a big employees union,</p>
<p>had fought very hard to pass legislation in California that made it</p>
<p>effectively very difficult for people to operate as independent contractors</p>
<p>and forcing companies like Uber and Lyft to treat them like full time employees</p>
<p>or to treat them like employees.</p>
<p>And so Prop 22 was to counter the union funded legislation,</p>
<p>which basically provided more freedom and flexibility to workers</p>
<p>where there weren&rsquo;t all these very arbitrary random rules</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re a writer, you can be an independent contractor.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re a driver, you cannot.</p>
<p>And, you know, all this nonsense that took place because the unions</p>
<p>were trying to increase the scale and scope of their union base.</p>
<p>And so Prop 22 was passed in California after much spending and lobbying</p>
<p>and it passed by a pretty decent margin.</p>
<p>And then this court ruling basically in the appeals court overruled</p>
<p>the constitutionality of some elements of Prop 22, which brings into question</p>
<p>whether that Prop 22 is actually going to hold in California.</p>
<p>Therefore, are all these people who are drivers for Uber, delivery people for DoorDash</p>
<p>and all these companies that are creating like Thumbtack</p>
<p>and all these companies that are creating marketplaces for individuals</p>
<p>to have flexible work, to go and work where they want, when they want to find gigs,</p>
<p>to find short term jobs, to find tasks and projects that they can run.</p>
<p>Are they now going to be seeing that those marketplaces stop working?</p>
<p>Because when you have to start treating those people like employees,</p>
<p>the flexibility and freedom of those marketplaces enable stalls out.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;re already seeing, so it&rsquo;s super nasty.</p>
<p>And the implications are that we&rsquo;re now seeing.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re now facing once again, this crisis of, you know,</p>
<p>are basically lower income people, people that want to have flexible labor</p>
<p>going to be restricted from having access to gig jobs</p>
<p>because the unions want to force everyone into a full time job,</p>
<p>which, you know, as our friend Bill Gurley pointed out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like an archaic element of the 19th and 20th century.</p>
<p>I mean, this is like, let&rsquo;s play a clip from Bill Gurley.</p>
<p>And here it is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one big issue that I don&rsquo;t think is talked about enough, which is,</p>
<p>you know, that if you poll the drivers, they&rsquo;re not looking for any changes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really happy with the flexible work product.</p>
<p>If you look at the voters of California, they stepped up and voted</p>
<p>and made it very clear in a state that voted two to one, you know, in favor of Biden.</p>
<p>They came down very strong, 60-40, that they didn&rsquo;t want this to happen.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one entity that&rsquo;s really been pushing this the whole time,</p>
<p>going all the way back to AE5, and that&rsquo;s the SEIU.</p>
<p>It is a single union, but to call them a single union understates it</p>
<p>because they are the granddaddy of special interest groups.</p>
<p>I sent along some data maybe you can put on the screen.</p>
<p>They spend more money lobbying than any other organization in our country</p>
<p>and have for many, many years.</p>
<p>They only represent two million members.</p>
<p>But oddly, those members are in hospitality, health care and government services.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not even in this industry.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re taking the dues from their members and using it to fight these battles</p>
<p>because they want to expand their footprint.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re really after is putting $400, $420,</p>
<p>which is the minimum member union fee for the two million they have.</p>
<p>They want to expand that to these drivers.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t actually want to help them.</p>
<p>They want to add to their cost.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s been pushing this the whole time.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s worth just saying one thing on this, which is,</p>
<p>you know, this is really kind of a question not about California and Prop 22,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a question about what is work</p>
<p>and all the tech companies that are enabling a new form of work globally.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want to have 40 hour a week jobs.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want to have to go sit at a desk all the time.</p>
<p>People want to have flexibility in their lives.</p>
<p>They want to have gigs.</p>
<p>Technology enables us to quickly find short term jobs,</p>
<p>short term opportunities to work on things and make some money</p>
<p>and figure out how we want to build our lives in a more flexible way.</p>
<p>Figure out how workers want to build lives in a more flexible way</p>
<p>across all industries.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really, frankly,</p>
<p>a non-progressive policy to say</p>
<p>that everyone has to be pigeonholed into working</p>
<p>full time, 40 hour a week labor jobs, be employees.</p>
<p>And not have the flexibility of running their own business</p>
<p>in their own way with the with their own time</p>
<p>and choosing what they want to go do and work on.</p>
<p>And so this sort of legislation and this sort of battle</p>
<p>is a really important one for defining the future of work in the United States,</p>
<p>which will ultimately represent the future of work globally.</p>
<p>And the craziness of all this, David, is that Uber drivers,</p>
<p>Lyft drivers, door dish drivers, et cetera, are getting paid a fortune now</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a labor shortage and.</p>
<p>These ride sharing companies have given a minimum</p>
<p>$21 an hour fee, so I don&rsquo;t know exactly what&rsquo;s going on here,</p>
<p>but it seems to me like it&rsquo;s a union grab because everybody else</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s affluent or rich real estate folks, you know, doctors, whoever.</p>
<p>Can be freelance, but if you&rsquo;re a ride share driver or a freelance writer,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get to be.</p>
<p>And it seems just incredibly unfair.</p>
<p>It is. And, you know, one of the best things about COVID, I think for all of us</p>
<p>is that we learned that we could do our jobs from anywhere.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have to go into an office.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have to work the standard, whatever, nine to six hours.</p>
<p>We could be anywhere. We had flexibility.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think it&rsquo;s one of the lasting consequences of COVID</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually been very positive for a lot of people.</p>
<p>And here you have the government basically trying to take away</p>
<p>and prohibit freelance work, flexible hours,</p>
<p>gig type jobs.</p>
<p>These are the sort of modern, flexible working relationships that people want.</p>
<p>Why are they getting rid of it?</p>
<p>Because of lobbying pressure from the SEIU, which only has two million members.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a big union.</p>
<p>But they got Lorena Gonzalez in their back pocket.</p>
<p>She passed AB5 in California.</p>
<p>The people of California didn&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>Remember, 58% of Californians said, we don&rsquo;t want this.</p>
<p>So they overturned it in this ballot initiative.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;ve got this activist judge basically, you know,</p>
<p>inventing these specious grounds for overturning Prop 22,</p>
<p>which is what the people want.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>And, you know, the common thread to me on this show</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve come to realize about American politics</p>
<p>is just the degree of special interest corruption.</p>
<p>And, you know, people are used to thinking in terms of left versus right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not. There&rsquo;s a special interest corruption that pervades everything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this union that is destroying freelance work</p>
<p>and flexible working relationships because of corruption,</p>
<p>because it benefits them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got defense contractors in Afghanistan who are just looting,</p>
<p>looting the Pentagon and the federal budget because it&rsquo;s in their interest.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got these special interests of both the right and the left.</p>
<p>This is a central problem in American politics.</p>
<p>And, you know, what they do to cover up the naked self-interest</p>
<p>is they disguise it in a kind of woke virtue signaling.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll start, you know, talking about, you know.</p>
<p>How what they&rsquo;re doing is for the benefit of these drivers</p>
<p>when the drivers don&rsquo;t even want it.</p>
<p>And to build on that, I&rsquo;d say, you know,</p>
<p>my great realization from having this conversation with you all every week</p>
<p>is that we are starting to propose a nanny state</p>
<p>in which people have no agency.</p>
<p>Even if they want to have agency over their life and career,</p>
<p>you are taking it away.</p>
<p>And then if there&rsquo;s no repercussions to people&rsquo;s behavior</p>
<p>and they have no agency, they become, you know, disenfranchised from society.</p>
<p>And why are they going to participate?</p>
<p>And then what kind of society do we have?</p>
<p>If people can&rsquo;t make their own choices</p>
<p>and you see it also in, you know, accreditation laws</p>
<p>and you see it, we&rsquo;re only rich people can invest.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re seeing it with this freelancing where, you know,</p>
<p>my dad would have loved to have an extra shift or two to make extra money.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not allowed to 80% of drivers want flexibility.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re willing to participate on things that ultimately.</p>
<p>On things that they think matter,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t necessarily solve the core root cause problems.</p>
<p>There are people right now in America, I think, are focused too much on symptoms,</p>
<p>meaning, you know, they want to fight for the right hashtags.</p>
<p>They want to fight for the right pronouns.</p>
<p>They want to make sure that,</p>
<p>you know, this person gets canceled for things that happened eight or 10 years ago.</p>
<p>And I think what they don&rsquo;t understand is these are all symptoms.</p>
<p>And this is this is not what solves the problem.</p>
<p>Right. We have a water crisis in America.</p>
<p>We have a food impending food crisis as we shut off the water.</p>
<p>We have a climate crisis that&rsquo;s engulfing the entire nation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still in the middle of a pandemic that we can&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p>We have an economic system that&rsquo;s fragile, that&rsquo;s dependent on a country</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s sometimes our friend and sometimes our foe in China.</p>
<p>These are huge transformational issues</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t get organized around.</p>
<p>And so instead, we spend our time at the edges on the symptoms.</p>
<p>And we think the symptoms are if we get the pronouns right,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s going to come together and everything&rsquo;s going to get fixed.</p>
<p>The looting will stop.</p>
<p>The graft will stop.</p>
<p>The corruption will stop.</p>
<p>And it turns out, actually, it emboldens those people to say, hey, wait a minute.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tricking these people.</p>
<p>If they think that I want it to happen, can happen.</p>
<p>Let them focus on the pronouns</p>
<p>while I continue to loot the American Treasury for another trillion dollars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the perfect the perfect representation of that is Gavin Newsom.</p>
<p>He represents both of these trends.</p>
<p>He is one of the most corrupt governors we&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>As soon as COVID happened, they suspended all sorts of,</p>
<p>you know, the process for contracting so that his</p>
<p>campaign contributors could get all these special contracts.</p>
<p>He cut a sweetheart deal to PG&amp;E to absolve them of liability</p>
<p>for all the fires they&rsquo;ve been causing.</p>
<p>And on and on it goes, the 12 billion dollars to the homeless industrial complex.</p>
<p>And then he disguises it with all this woke virtue signaling.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I would just give a shout out to the recall campaign.</p>
<p>The election is on September 14th, but the ballots have gone out.</p>
<p>If you want to send a message to the political class</p>
<p>that this special interest corruption has got to stop,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s cut the head off the snake here.</p>
<p>Just vote to recall Gavin Newsom on question one. Period.</p>
<p>All right. You guys want to end on Jeff Bezos?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s talk about the AI bot first and then Bezos.</p>
<p>All right. So if you haven&rsquo;t been watching, Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>tweeted a video which will play right now as I talk over it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically their robots</p>
<p>which have been picking up heavy objects and walking around doing parkour.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what parkour is, it&rsquo;s basically people jumping off</p>
<p>the side of objects and flipping and doing balance beams</p>
<p>and vaulting themselves all around. It is.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s like breakdancing in France.</p>
<p>Yeah, but from heights and jumping over things as well, and the French</p>
<p>are like parkour experts.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s I think parkour is French for jumping.</p>
<p>I made that up.</p>
<p>But if you look at these parks, do parkour?</p>
<p>No, absolutely.</p>
<p>I have never seen him.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll show that video.</p>
<p>I have seen him so drunk that he&rsquo;s on the floor, but never seen him do parkour.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t get in the way of a bottle of DRC.</p>
<p>This robot looks more dexterous than any of the Terminators</p>
<p>we saw in the films.</p>
<p>And then adding to that.</p>
<p>Oh, if you didn&rsquo;t know, Boston Dynamics got bought by Google.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Freeberg has some inside information on that.</p>
<p>And then they got sold again.</p>
<p>SoftBank had bought them and now they are owned by Hyundai,</p>
<p>the South Korean Hyundai, the South Korean automaker, because apparently the.</p>
<p>Softies at Google didn&rsquo;t want to be involved in</p>
<p>government contracting with robots, i.e.</p>
<p>making soldiers of the future, which obviously I don&rsquo;t know the Chinese have.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t characterize the whole story like that.</p>
<p>I mean, remember, like there was.</p>
<p>Well, Google bought Boston Dynamics in 2013.</p>
<p>And remember, Boston Dynamics had been around for over a decade.</p>
<p>Prior to that, they spun out of MIT like in the 90s, I think.</p>
<p>And they were had always been working on, you know, advanced neural nets</p>
<p>being applied to kind of, you know, automation systems</p>
<p>so you could get things to mimic real life.</p>
<p>And the idea at Google, this was when they had set up Google X</p>
<p>and were starting to kind of do a lot of this,</p>
<p>you know, moonshot type tech investing as a separate entity</p>
<p>outside of the core Google.</p>
<p>And it was like leveraging their cash flow to start new projects.</p>
<p>The idea was, let&rsquo;s build this into kind of a next gen robotics platform.</p>
<p>They had Andy Rubin, who previously started and ran Android</p>
<p>company was called Danger.</p>
<p>Google bought it, turned into Android,</p>
<p>run the run the unit, and they made several other acquisitions.</p>
<p>They rolled them all up into this kind of robotics platform.</p>
<p>They had spent, I think, 400 million on Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>and hundreds of millions more on these other companies.</p>
<p>And ultimately, I think the challenge was less about like, you know,</p>
<p>who does or doesn&rsquo;t want to do contracts with us.</p>
<p>But it was more about the fundamental question that is still the question</p>
<p>mark today, which is, do we really need general purpose automation</p>
<p>or do we need special purpose automation for industries, for customers?</p>
<p>Right. Where do you find product market fit?</p>
<p>Do people really need a robot that does parkour or do they need an automation</p>
<p>system that can lift boxes and pack and place things or an automation</p>
<p>system that can move things from point A to point B?</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re solving for a customer&rsquo;s problem, you typically find</p>
<p>that the special purpose automation solution is a more elegant, cheaper</p>
<p>solution that you can get to market right away, like building an automated</p>
<p>little truck that moves things around or building a machine that lifts</p>
<p>and puts boxes in the right place.</p>
<p>Parallel the discussion between narrow AI and general. Correct.</p>
<p>And this is exactly the same question.</p>
<p>Jake, I was like, you know, is, you know, is general purpose</p>
<p>AI really what the market needs?</p>
<p>Or are there specific applications of neural network or machine learning</p>
<p>technologies that allow us to solve for the problems that customers have</p>
<p>without needing to replicate the human being?</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re lifting boxes, you don&rsquo;t necessarily need all the other things</p>
<p>that humans have. Right. You don&rsquo;t need to mimic a human when you&rsquo;re moving a package.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to have four legs to do it.</p>
<p>You can have it on four wheels and just have a simple system that moves it around.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I think SoftBank, you know, Masa-san had this whole belief</p>
<p>with Vision Fund One when he raised 100 some odd billion dollars that, you know,</p>
<p>the singularity where machines were going to be smarter and better than humans</p>
<p>in every way. Intelligence and dexterity and all these things</p>
<p>were about was about to kind of we&rsquo;re about to pass that moment.</p>
<p>And this was part of that core thesis he had, which is this is going to be</p>
<p>the robotics company.</p>
<p>And I think as we&rsquo;ve seen, they can mimic parkour,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t do all the other things humans can do.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re, you know, trying to get a machine to do something</p>
<p>that a customer needs, it&rsquo;s really not parkour.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, they can&rsquo;t even walk a dog</p>
<p>because they wouldn&rsquo;t know how to deal with the edge cases</p>
<p>if the dog had diarrhea.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s core IP at Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s certainly critically valuable for businesses</p>
<p>that are in special purpose automation, which Hyundai is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a great set of applications for leveraging that IP</p>
<p>into some of the existing product lines and customers that they serve.</p>
<p>So in related in a related story, Elon then revealed the Tesla bot plans</p>
<p>at his AI day.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in a couple of these AI days, and I think they&rsquo;re primarily designed</p>
<p>to get AI talent, which is some of the hardest developers to find in the world.</p>
<p>And they said that their Tesla bot will weigh 125 pounds,</p>
<p>five, eight, so I&rsquo;ll be a half inch taller than it,</p>
<p>but it will weigh significantly less than me.</p>
<p>And it will move up up to five miles per hour and can carry 45 pounds.</p>
<p>Elon said the reason he was doing that is so a human can easily overtake it</p>
<p>in case to become sentient, which was quite entertaining.</p>
<p>Chamath, do you think this is</p>
<p>one of the chances Elon has a robot like this and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s operating the real world?</p>
<p>I saw a bunch of journalists dunking on him that this would never, ever happen,</p>
<p>which is kind of hard to believe when there&rsquo;s a million Tesla&rsquo;s on the road.</p>
<p>Yeah, no comment.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Oh, OK. Can&rsquo;t comment. All right.</p>
<p>Leave it at that.</p>
<p>Sachs, you have any comments on this?</p>
<p>I was working with Elon at PayPal.</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought it was a little bit of a surprise that he was working on a robot.</p>
<p>But, you know, obviously, this has been an interest of his.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s talked a lot about it.</p>
<p>And so it kind of makes sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just another innovative thing he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Should we talk about Elon versus Bezos on the space?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I just wanted to let people know, by the way, the robot going at five</p>
<p>miles an hour, it&rsquo;s not as outlandish as I think some of the journalists</p>
<p>and idiots out there who don&rsquo;t build anything in the world,</p>
<p>who were kind of dunking on him, like we&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>If you think about those cars going 65, 75, 85 miles an hour on the road,</p>
<p>processing the world, doing a neural network, machine learning on the fly</p>
<p>to figure out where the car should go.</p>
<p>A robot going five miles an hour is an easier task.</p>
<p>I think all those people dunking on him should have just taken a step back</p>
<p>and actually asked the question, am I just being really insecure right now?</p>
<p>And if so, why am I making fun of this guy who just seems to be,</p>
<p>you know, firing on all cylinders?</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s maybe it&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>Maybe, you know, maybe maybe maybe I&rsquo;m writing this article out of my own insecurity.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m feeling a little impotent, you know.</p>
<p>And also to dunk on a guy for the version one or even the version</p>
<p>zero point one of a product is so ridiculous.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember the version zero of Tesla.</p>
<p>Now look at the company.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s about iterating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you get to product.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just so stupid and short term.</p>
<p>And by the way, he&rsquo;s on the current product capabilities and his his</p>
<p>his style of doing these things, I think makes a ton of sense.</p>
<p>When when, you know, he started with Starlink, it was the same reaction.</p>
<p>People were dunking, dunking, dunking too slow, too expensive, not going to work.</p>
<p>And what you find through these events are really technical people</p>
<p>building companies that could help him want to be a part of the mission.</p>
<p>Right. And so, you know, for whatever it&rsquo;s worth, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I think Starlink is going to be a real thing. I think.</p>
<p>This is probably going to be a real thing.</p>
<p>I think great companies will get absorbed into this.</p>
<p>These efforts, I think I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I really think the people that.</p>
<p>Are just so low, like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like this loathing going on.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>What do you think will differentiate the opportunity for success</p>
<p>with Larry Page owning and running</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics, then Masa owning and running Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>and then Elon trying to take on the same project from scratch?</p>
<p>You know, why were these other two kind of well-capitalized</p>
<p>influential businesses that have attract great partners</p>
<p>not been able to turn Boston Dynamics into kind of a successful business?</p>
<p>But but you guys believe Elon will.</p>
<p>If I had to just categorize them, I would say</p>
<p>Larry is absent and is sitting on a hundred billion dollar fortune</p>
<p>with no idea what to do.</p>
<p>I think on one of seven islands.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, he&rsquo;s just absent.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s irrelevant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody knows what the fuck he looks like.</p>
<p>I mean, we do.</p>
<p>But, you know, he&rsquo;s frittered away enormous potential, I think.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Masa is a master capital allocator, but not an engineer.</p>
<p>And I think Elon is the most important</p>
<p>technical product and business mind of our lifetime.</p>
<p>I think the answer is even simpler.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the customer of the robot.</p>
<p>So he understands what the spec should be because he has so many robots</p>
<p>working in the factories.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s going to buy the first thousand to go colonize Mars</p>
<p>or work at a space station to build shit in space.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s going to have them working in the Tesla factory</p>
<p>and for the boring company carrying rocks out of tunnels.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the customer.</p>
<p>Of course, he knows.</p>
<p>And Masa wasn&rsquo;t the customer.</p>
<p>Masa was looking to increase whatever money.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it has to do this, but it&rsquo;s also it&rsquo;s also skill set.</p>
<p>Like Masa, of course, is an incredible visionary and investor,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not going to be the guy in the engine room making the robot.</p>
<p>Larry. Now, in fairness to Larry Page, he could be that good.</p>
<p>And there was a moment in time where Larry was that good</p>
<p>and frankly, better than Elon.</p>
<p>But that window has closed and it&rsquo;s well past.</p>
<p>And now, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of like the player</p>
<p>that just keeps getting better and better.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Great sex. Your thoughts.</p>
<p>I mean, nothing to add to that.</p>
<p>I think you both make great points.</p>
<p>I mean, the amazing thing is that Elon is still working so hard,</p>
<p>doubling down, coming up with new ideas, new initiatives.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s harder than ever when most people are, you know, doing.</p>
<p>Most people would do what Larry did, you know, go buy an island or seven</p>
<p>and yours and hang out, you know.</p>
<p>All right. Bezos is lost his way,</p>
<p>and he left his position as CEO of Amazon to focus on Blue Origin.</p>
<p>And then he sued NASA over the moon program,</p>
<p>accusing NASA of wrongly evaluated its lunar lander proposal,</p>
<p>giving all the funds to SpaceX.</p>
<p>He then did a series of like infographics talking about how terrible</p>
<p>SpaceX&rsquo;s plans were.</p>
<p>This lawsuit has delayed SpaceX&rsquo;s work on the project,</p>
<p>according to The Verge.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>Amazon urged the FCC to dismiss the newly submitted plans for SpaceX</p>
<p>to launch another cluster of satellites to power Starlink.</p>
<p>And Elon tweeted, turns out Bezos retired in order to pursue a full time job,</p>
<p>filing lawsuits against SpaceX, which is hilarious.</p>
<p>Well, how sad is this that it&rsquo;s a huge miscalculation in the following way,</p>
<p>which is that in order for Jeff to achieve his ambitions,</p>
<p>he needs deeply technical people.</p>
<p>And this is the simplest way to basically turn them off,</p>
<p>because this is not what technical people do.</p>
<p>What do technical people do?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t we don&rsquo;t take our toys and run from the sandbox crying like a bitch.</p>
<p>We stay there and we keep iterating, trying to make things work.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don&rsquo;t act like patent trolls.</p>
<p>I have a new I have a new slogan for you, J-Cal.</p>
<p>Go ahead. Winners do and losers sue.</p>
<p>Winners do and losers sue.</p>
<p>OK, folks, there you have it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the all in podcast. We&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back from a big vacation.</p>
<p>Make it happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, make the banger.</p>
<p>Make the banger. All right, everybody.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your free bird?</p>
<p>Do you have any thoughts on these on the lawsuit?</p>
<p>I feel bad for Bezos.</p>
<p>I feel like he&rsquo;s just getting so beat up on this shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s honestly it&rsquo;s a little disappointing</p>
<p>because I think he&rsquo;s got all the right intentions.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incredible engineer, obviously an incredible operator.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see him and Elon succeed in the work they&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>as well as all the other startups that are pursuing this.</p>
<p>I am concerned about, frankly, the lack of commercial readiness for this industry.</p>
<p>I feel like in terms of the hype cycle, we&rsquo;re at that early point</p>
<p>where the investment dollars and the number of companies exceeds the market demand.</p>
<p>And therefore, there&rsquo;s this fight over the one or two customers,</p>
<p>which is basically NASA and the federal government.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s creating this really nasty set of circumstances</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where the money comes from.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the customers are right now.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re all fighting over one or two customers.</p>
<p>And Elon filed suits</p>
<p>against the federal agencies when he lost contracts.</p>
<p>And I know he did that when they no bid them.</p>
<p>I get it. I get it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s slightly different.</p>
<p>I get it. But still, like I think at the end of the day,</p>
<p>you know, Bezos is willing to put his money where his mouth is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s offered to put up a billion dollars or more to fund this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see multiple companies simultaneously going to the moon,</p>
<p>multiple companies simultaneously going to Mars.</p>
<p>But rather than have, you know, a single contract with one customer</p>
<p>or have, you know, private industry figure out ways to make money from this and fund it.</p>
<p>The challenge is just it&rsquo;s another product market fit question, right?</p>
<p>The market is one customer today.</p>
<p>And Bezos is almost 60 years old.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got 150, 200 billion dollars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to cost him two or three billion dollars.</p>
<p>One, two, three percent of his net worth to do all this.</p>
<p>Just fucking do it, Bezos.</p>
<p>And stop crying and you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>He may end up doing that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the problem is he&rsquo;s losing a competitor.</p>
<p>No, but he&rsquo;s losing the human capital that&rsquo;s required.</p>
<p>So there was a great there was a huge little press cycle about this one person.</p>
<p>He was like the the leader of the of the lander project who just quit and went to SpaceX.</p>
<p>My point is, other engineers don&rsquo;t want to see that this is the way to win.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got to crawl out of that hole now.</p>
<p>Build, iterate and solve.</p>
<p>Build, iterate, solve.</p>
<p>It certainly seems the case that his PR stunt with shooting himself into space</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do him any favors either.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s almost like everyone sees the great work</p>
<p>Elon does when he does these PR events and he gets all this attention</p>
<p>and publicity and gets positive press and accolades.</p>
<p>And then Bezos does them.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, oh, Bezos has no besties.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no bestie taking Bezos aside.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s bestie-less.</p>
<p>He needs bestie-less Bezos.</p>
<p>No, he may have besties, but they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re not doing the job</p>
<p>that other besties do for other people.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re yes men and women and they&rsquo;re not being true besties,</p>
<p>they need to tell him when he&rsquo;s got something that&rsquo;s a blind spot.</p>
<p>He needs real besties.</p>
<p>And the blind spot here is he was dunking on Richard Branson</p>
<p>and being like, oh, you didn&rsquo;t go to the right height.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an infographic.</p>
<p>Stop with the fucking infographics, Bezos.</p>
<p>What are you, 12 years old?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like going to the teacher with like a drawing like,</p>
<p>I should technically get an A plus and I should be singing the solo</p>
<p>for the choir practice.</p>
<p>And like some other person is like, got the solo.</p>
<p>You got the fucking solo next year, Bezos.</p>
<p>Bezos offered you a huge consulting fee, Jake.</p>
<p>How would you be his bestie consigliere?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bestie for hire, for sure.</p>
<p>For sure. Bestie as a service.</p>
<p>By the way, I hired this fuck nut.</p>
<p>He flies back with me.</p>
<p>I mean, he literally ate everything on the plane.</p>
<p>And then what are you talking about?</p>
<p>And hold on, let me finish.</p>
<p>You were eating the tiramisu.</p>
<p>Let me finish.</p>
<p>You went double on the tiramisu.</p>
<p>He said to me, Chamath, you have some great toiletries in the back.</p>
<p>I said, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s Marvis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s great toothbrushes.</p>
<p>And then out of his pocket, he pulled some scope bottles that he had.</p>
<p>The more in my bag.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to buy scope until 2022.</p>
<p>I was shocked.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not generic, it&rsquo;s the real scope.</p>
<p>This motherfucker was looting.</p>
<p>I looted the planet.</p>
<p>I looted all your lactate.</p>
<p>We all take advantage of CP.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>This this other guy, this motherfucker,</p>
<p>Friedberg, once was so buried, he got so fucking mad.</p>
<p>He grabbed all the lactate in my, you know, our little medicine cabinet</p>
<p>and ran out and came back.</p>
<p>He was angry and he was like, I&rsquo;m so fucking angry</p>
<p>because he had lost a big pot right during poker.</p>
<p>Then he took all the pistachios and shoved them in his pocket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an Afghan warlord.</p>
<p>So he stole the pistachios?</p>
<p>Yeah, I sold the pistachios and the lactate.</p>
<p>And the lactate, and the lactate.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, fuck it.</p>
<p>I lost ten dimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get back thirty seven dollars in lactate.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>So sad. So sad.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ll see you all.</p>
<p>Wait, Friedberg, you want me to prepare the house?</p>
<p>You want me to prepare the, the.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I think. Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be awesome if you could do that.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to. I&rsquo;ll bring some.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring some tests, some Binax tests, too.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, just as an aside, Bill Gurley was talking about this.</p>
<p>We talked about this early in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we have fucking one dollar test, Friedberg?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Does everybody not have a hundred tests everywhere?</p>
<p>Binax now tests are literally lateral flow strips.</p>
<p>They cost pennies to make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how much it costs to buy.</p>
<p>Twenty bucks.</p>
<p>Why is it a dollar?</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t Biden or Trump get that done?</p>
<p>Is it some graft, graft, greed?</p>
<p>Yeah, you should get Mike Romino on to talk about this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the the guy to talk about it.</p>
<p>But I mean, if people were taking those every day, we could.</p>
<p>I think you guys may remember this.</p>
<p>I tweeted about this over a year ago, like last April,</p>
<p>where we could actually print these antigen tests for pennies in the US.</p>
<p>I mean, when we had that like whole emergency authority thing</p>
<p>and we were making masks and liquid oxygen tanks and all this shit,</p>
<p>we should have been printing antigen tests on strips of paper.</p>
<p>We have the facilities in the US to do it.</p>
<p>And we could have made, you know, 100 billion 50 cent tests</p>
<p>and made them just free and available to schools, to workplaces, to everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely insane.</p>
<p>But people can&rsquo;t people can&rsquo;t be freelance writers</p>
<p>or drive an Uber for two hours a day in California.</p>
<p>We can we can mandate that, but we can&rsquo;t mandate a 25 cent, 50 cent test</p>
<p>and put them in everybody&rsquo;s fucking mailboxes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on fire now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking stupid.</p>
<p>Everything is so dumb.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s a grifter in this government, incompetent assholes.</p>
<p>I would like to I would like to vote.</p>
<p>I would like to go to war with Fiji because it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like an island, and I think that Fiji probably has a lot of them.</p>
<p>Well, Fiji is not respect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than French Polynesia, just because I think it&rsquo;s a little closer.</p>
<p>Yeah. So we can go there and spread pronouns.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;d like to go to war with Iceland, but only in the summertime</p>
<p>because I hear it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go to war with Tuscany over the gelato.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to war with Florence over gelato.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to occupy Tuscany for the pizza and the pasta.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on fire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on fire.</p>
<p>For the pizza and the pasta.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m occupying Tuscany.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to build a bog room in all these places</p>
<p>just to accommodate all the private jets are going to come in.</p>
<p>I mean, but just in closing, let&rsquo;s just let&rsquo;s just say thank you</p>
<p>to the amazing people of Italy for having.</p>
<p>What an incredible greatest country for adults to go on vacation in.</p>
<p>What an incredible country.</p>
<p>Florence is amazing.</p>
<p>Tuscany is outrageous.</p>
<p>Rome is beautiful.</p>
<p>Venice is incredible.</p>
<p>Everything is delightful.</p>
<p>I love Sardinia.</p>
<p>I love you, Italy.</p>
<p>I love you so much.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be back next year.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you all next time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you next time on the All-In podcast.</p>
<p>Bye bye.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be.</p>
<p>David Sacks, you come to me from your boat in Sicily.</p>
<p>My daughter&rsquo;s wedding day.</p>
<p>Sacks, you come to me and you ask me not to interrupt you</p>
<p>so that Henry Bellacaster can make a clean cut of your speech.</p>
<p>Well, you can stop by acting like a man, David Sacks.</p>
<p>I got interrupted on the podcast.</p>
<p>Oh, you didn&rsquo;t let me finish my thought.</p>
<p>You wanted this part?</p>
<p>You wanted this part on this podcast?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the director?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the producer?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get you this part.</p>
<p>But someday, Sacks, I&rsquo;m gonna ask you for a favor, Sacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask you for an allocation in All-In, in your call-in app.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask you to lead the Series B.</p>
<p>And on that day, I expect a valuation,</p>
<p>cause measure it with what I&rsquo;ve done for you today.</p>
<p>Okay, David Sacks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty good bit.</p>
<p>Look at Don Canole over here.</p>
