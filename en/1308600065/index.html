    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to discuss sugar,</p>
<p>in particular, how our nervous system</p>
<p>regulates our sugar intake and our seeking of sugar.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to discuss</p>
<p>how sugar regulates our nervous system.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>sugar really impacts our brain and body</p>
<p>by two main mechanisms.</p>
<p>One of those mechanisms is based on the sweet taste of sugar,</p>
<p>which itself is rewarding.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not much of a sweet tooth,</p>
<p>I confess I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>most people enjoy sweet tastes more than bitter tastes.</p>
<p>And the sweet taste of sugar and its various forms</p>
<p>is strongly reinforcing,</p>
<p>meaning it triggers the activation of neurons,</p>
<p>nerve cells in the brain and body</p>
<p>that make us want to consume more of that sweet substance.</p>
<p>Incidentally, sweet tastes also make us want</p>
<p>to eat more of other substances as well.</p>
<p>You may be familiar with that phenomenon.</p>
<p>Now, sugar also triggers mechanisms in the brain and body</p>
<p>based on its nutritive content,</p>
<p>independent of its sweetness.</p>
<p>What that means is that the actual caloric content</p>
<p>and the way that sugar interacts with your nervous system</p>
<p>at a subconscious level without your awareness</p>
<p>also impacts your craving and seeking of sugar</p>
<p>and other foods.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to discuss what happens</p>
<p>when you ingest sugar in terms of your body&rsquo;s reaction</p>
<p>and your brain&rsquo;s reaction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about what happens</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t ingest enough sugar.</p>
<p>Because as it turns out,</p>
<p>sugar is such a powerful fuel for the brain</p>
<p>that under conditions where people don&rsquo;t ingest enough sugar</p>
<p>or where their so-called blood glucose,</p>
<p>which is basically blood sugar of a particular form,</p>
<p>gets too low, their neurons don&rsquo;t function as well.</p>
<p>That said, there are conditions of very low blood sugar</p>
<p>in which neurons can function even better.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk about the ins and outs,</p>
<p>the ups and downs of sugar</p>
<p>as it relates to your nervous system.</p>
<p>And by the end of this episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident that you&rsquo;ll have a much clearer picture</p>
<p>as to how much sugar you should be ingesting,</p>
<p>whether or not you should avoid sugars</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re currently eating.</p>
<p>And you will certainly understand much, much more</p>
<p>about the energy and fuel sources that your brain relies on,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m certain will allow you</p>
<p>to make better informed choices</p>
<p>about the foods you eat and avoid</p>
<p>toward mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health, even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low, we simply can&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>as well as we would otherwise, our mood is off,</p>
<p>hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about sugar.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how sugar impacts your brain</p>
<p>and how your brain impacts your pursuit</p>
<p>or your avoidance of sugar.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get a few things out of the way first.</p>
<p>The first thing is that there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>inherently bad about sugar.</p>
<p>I know the word sugar gets a bad rap nowadays,</p>
<p>and indeed, you&rsquo;re going to hear over and over again</p>
<p>during this podcast that consuming a lot of refined sugars,</p>
<p>in particular high fructose corn syrup,</p>
<p>is known to have a very large number</p>
<p>of bad effects on the brain and body.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s anyone</p>
<p>that really debates that anymore.</p>
<p>Even if we just agree, and I think we should all agree,</p>
<p>on the so-called calories in, calories out principle, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a principle of thermodynamics</p>
<p>that if we ingest more energy than we burn,</p>
<p>we are going to gain weight.</p>
<p>If we ingest less energy than we burn,</p>
<p>we are generally going to lose weight.</p>
<p>And if the two things are in balance,</p>
<p>ingestion and burning of energy,</p>
<p>well, then we&rsquo;re going to maintain weight.</p>
<p>So everyone agrees on that.</p>
<p>I agree on that, but beyond that,</p>
<p>there are a number of ways in which particular nutrients,</p>
<p>in the case of today&rsquo;s episode, sugar,</p>
<p>impact the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>such that we tend to seek out more of particular nutrients.</p>
<p>For instance, if we eat sugar,</p>
<p>there are two or at least two mechanisms</p>
<p>by which we will crave more sugar.</p>
<p>I think most people are aware of that experience,</p>
<p>but today I&rsquo;m going to explain exactly how that works.</p>
<p>But also that when we ingest sugar,</p>
<p>it has a bunch of different effects</p>
<p>on the way that our neural circuits work</p>
<p>that can allow us to be more or less focused,</p>
<p>more or less agitated, more or less happy,</p>
<p>more or less depressed in some cases.</p>
<p>So today, as we explore this thing we&rsquo;re calling sugar,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to explore that mainly in the context</p>
<p>of the nervous system,</p>
<p>but also in the context of how the nervous system</p>
<p>regulates many, many functions and behaviors</p>
<p>that are important to all of you.</p>
<p>Your ability to think, your ability to exercise,</p>
<p>your ability to gain weight, lose weight,</p>
<p>whatever your goals might happen to be.</p>
<p>Sugar plays a critical role in achieving those goals.</p>
<p>And in some cases, if you&rsquo;re ingesting too much</p>
<p>at the wrong times or the wrong forms,</p>
<p>sugar can actually impede those goals.</p>
<p>In fact, sugar can prevent all the right behaviors</p>
<p>from allowing you to achieve the goals that you want.</p>
<p>So today we are going to place sugar</p>
<p>into its proper context.</p>
<p>The way I want to start off by doing that</p>
<p>is to tell you a little bit of what happens when we eat</p>
<p>and a little bit of what the brain does</p>
<p>to respond to those events.</p>
<p>So what happens when we eat?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve done an entire episode on metabolism.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in the full cascade of hormonal</p>
<p>and neural events that occurs when we eat,</p>
<p>please check out that episode.</p>
<p>But for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just take a, what I call top contour view</p>
<p>of the hormonal response to ingesting food.</p>
<p>Now, anytime we eat, that is the consequence</p>
<p>of a number of things that happened before we ate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hormone in our brain and body called ghrelin,</p>
<p>spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.</p>
<p>Ghrelin is a hormone that increases</p>
<p>depending on how long it&rsquo;s been since we ate last, okay?</p>
<p>So the longer it&rsquo;s been since we had a meal,</p>
<p>ghrelin levels are going to be higher and higher and higher.</p>
<p>And it essentially makes us hungry</p>
<p>by interacting with particular neurons</p>
<p>in an area of the brain called the arcuate nucleus</p>
<p>of the hypothalamus and some other areas as well,</p>
<p>like the lateral hypothalamus.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know the names of those brain areas,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;d like to know them, there they are.</p>
<p>Ghrelin increases, it tends to make us hungry.</p>
<p>And then when we eat,</p>
<p>typically what happens is ghrelin levels go down.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very logical system.</p>
<p>Now, when we eat, assuming that we eat carbohydrates,</p>
<p>but even if we just eat some protein and some fats,</p>
<p>we will experience a slight, or in some cases,</p>
<p>a large rise in blood glucose.</p>
<p>Blood glucose is simply blood sugar.</p>
<p>And the body and brain, we should say particular,</p>
<p>the nervous system doesn&rsquo;t function well</p>
<p>if blood sugar is too high or too low.</p>
<p>So as a consequence, we have another hormone</p>
<p>which is released from the pancreas,</p>
<p>which is called insulin,</p>
<p>which helps regulate the amount of glucose</p>
<p>in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>So even if you were to ingest an entire cup,</p>
<p>an eight ounce cup of pure table sugar,</p>
<p>which would send your blood glucose very, very high,</p>
<p>assuming that you have a normal insulin response,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not diabetic,</p>
<p>that insulin response would help clamp</p>
<p>that blood glucose level so that it did not cause damage</p>
<p>to your brain and body.</p>
<p>Because if blood sugar goes too high,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually toxic to neurons</p>
<p>and other cells of your body can kill them off.</p>
<p>And neurons of the central nervous system,</p>
<p>meaning the brain and spinal cord,</p>
<p>once they are dead, they do not come back.</p>
<p>So your biological systems understand this</p>
<p>at a biological level that is,</p>
<p>and prevent that death of cells due to high blood sugar</p>
<p>by keeping insulin around in order to clamp blood glucose.</p>
<p>Diabetics, we call them type one diabetics</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t make insulin have to take insulin when they eat,</p>
<p>in particular, when they eat foods</p>
<p>that raise their blood sugar,</p>
<p>specifically to avoid that neurotoxicity</p>
<p>and the other deleterious effects of high blood sugar.</p>
<p>Okay, so ghrelin is a hormone that goes up</p>
<p>the longer it&rsquo;s been since we&rsquo;ve eaten.</p>
<p>It tends to stimulate hunger.</p>
<p>When we eat, ghrelin is suppressed.</p>
<p>Blood glucose typically goes up,</p>
<p>especially when we eat a carbohydrate-containing meal.</p>
<p>When blood glucose goes up, it&rsquo;s regulated in the body,</p>
<p>meaning its peaks and its valleys</p>
<p>are more or less smoothed out.</p>
<p>And that glucose is sequestered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken away where it needs to be taken away.</p>
<p>And in certain locations, it&rsquo;s delivered to cells</p>
<p>so that those cells can use the glucose.</p>
<p>Now, one of the chief organs for glucose utilization</p>
<p>is the brain.</p>
<p>Neurons are tremendously metabolically active</p>
<p>and their preferred mode of metabolism</p>
<p>is glucose metabolism.</p>
<p>In other words, neurons basically run on sugar,</p>
<p>which is not to say that you should eat a lot of sugar.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll see today, there are states of mind and body,</p>
<p>for instance, fasted states in which people report</p>
<p>having immense amounts of mental clarity</p>
<p>and their blood glucose is actually quite low.</p>
<p>So it is simply not the case</p>
<p>that the more sugar that you ingest,</p>
<p>the better that your brain will function.</p>
<p>But it is the case that for most people,</p>
<p>meaning people who are not on a ketogenic</p>
<p>or very low carbohydrate diet,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not adapted to low carbohydrate diets,</p>
<p>that neurons in their brain and body</p>
<p>are using glucose in order to function.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what allows those neurons</p>
<p>to fire electrical potentials.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we refer to it, firing,</p>
<p>meaning sending electrical signals down their length</p>
<p>to communicate with other neurons.</p>
<p>To illustrate just how important glucose is</p>
<p>for brain function, I&rsquo;d like to describe a study</p>
<p>that just recently came out</p>
<p>that sits on a long history of similar studies,</p>
<p>but the one that just came out is particularly interesting.</p>
<p>Now, I want to point out that unless I say otherwise,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to refer to typical diets,</p>
<p>meaning I have to believe that most people out there</p>
<p>are ingesting some starch or carbohydrate.</p>
<p>I do realize there are people</p>
<p>following very low carbohydrate diets</p>
<p>or moderately carbohydrate diets.</p>
<p>I even know that there&rsquo;s some folks out there</p>
<p>who are on the so-called carnivore diet.</p>
<p>They only eat meat and organs, maybe a little fruit,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to assume that the vast majority</p>
<p>of people listening ingest proteins and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So unless I say ketogenic or I emphasize ketosis itself,</p>
<p>which I will, I&rsquo;m referring to a kind of typical diet</p>
<p>where people are consuming fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>I count myself as one such individual.</p>
<p>At some point, I might try the carnivore diet, who knows?</p>
<p>I might try a pure vegan diet, who knows?</p>
<p>But for my entire life up until now, I&rsquo;m 46 years old,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a proud omnivore,</p>
<p>meaning I&rsquo;ve tried to eat high quality,</p>
<p>as much as I can, unprocessed foods.</p>
<p>I try and really avoid highly processed foods,</p>
<p>but I do eat from those three macronutrient groups,</p>
<p>proteins, carbohydrates, and fats,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to assume that most of you do as well.</p>
<p>The study I&rsquo;d like to emphasize,</p>
<p>recorded from neurons, nerve cells in the brain,</p>
<p>in particular, in the part of the brain</p>
<p>that responds to visual images, a so-called visual cortex,</p>
<p>and neurons in the visual cortex are beautifully tuned,</p>
<p>as we say, to particular features of what we see.</p>
<p>The primary example of this, the kind of classic example,</p>
<p>is if you put a little electrode next to a neuron</p>
<p>in your visual cortex,</p>
<p>or if we put you into an fMRI scanner machine,</p>
<p>which can detect neural activity,</p>
<p>and I were to show you a bunch of just little lines,</p>
<p>you know, bars of light, they could be dark bars of light,</p>
<p>they could be light bars of light</p>
<p>on a screen in front of you,</p>
<p>so some would be vertical, some would be horizontal,</p>
<p>some would be at 45 degrees.</p>
<p>What we would see is that some neurons respond best,</p>
<p>meaning they fire a lot of electrical activity</p>
<p>to vertical lines.</p>
<p>Other ones respond to horizontal lines,</p>
<p>and others respond to 45 degree lines.</p>
<p>And this so-called orientation tuning,</p>
<p>meaning because of the orientation of the line,</p>
<p>is a cardinal classic feature</p>
<p>of the way that your visual system is built.</p>
<p>And everything that you see,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a face or a dog or a cat or a landscape,</p>
<p>is built up from these very simple neuron responses.</p>
<p>In other words, when you look at a face,</p>
<p>there are neurons deep in the brain that respond to faces,</p>
<p>but the only reason that those neurons</p>
<p>can respond to those faces</p>
<p>is because they receive signals from neurons</p>
<p>in your visual cortex,</p>
<p>some of which respond to vertical lines,</p>
<p>some of which respond to horizontal lines,</p>
<p>and some which respond to 45 degree lines,</p>
<p>and all of those are built up</p>
<p>in what we call a hierarchical representation,</p>
<p>which is fancy language for it.</p>
<p>Those are the building blocks by which you see a face</p>
<p>and you recognize a face.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really an amazing phenomenon.</p>
<p>It happens very, very fast.</p>
<p>You never notice that you&rsquo;re doing this,</p>
<p>but everything is built up</p>
<p>from these fundamental orientation-tuned neurons.</p>
<p>Now, orientation-tuned neurons are so fundamental</p>
<p>that they are the building blocks</p>
<p>by which you make up all other things that you see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way you read,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the way that you recognize faces, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>and everything else.</p>
<p>Experimentally, it&rsquo;s quite straightforward</p>
<p>to measure how sharply tuned one of these neurons is.</p>
<p>In other words, if I were to show you a vertical line</p>
<p>and find a neuron in your brain</p>
<p>that responds to vertical lines,</p>
<p>I could also ask whether or not</p>
<p>that neuron fires any electrical activity</p>
<p>in response to a line that&rsquo;s not quite vertical,</p>
<p>maybe just 10 degrees off vertical,</p>
<p>or 20 degrees, or 30 degrees.</p>
<p>And what I eventually would find</p>
<p>is that that neuron was orientation-tuned</p>
<p>over a particular range of angles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only going to respond to vertical lines,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also going to respond to lines</p>
<p>that are about 10 degrees off vertical in either side,</p>
<p>but probably not much more, maybe 20,</p>
<p>but usually it&rsquo;s going to be anywhere</p>
<p>from vertical to just tilted slightly, okay?</p>
<p>In the recent experiment</p>
<p>that was published in the journal, Neuron,</p>
<p>cell press journal, excellent journal,</p>
<p>the authors asked a really interesting question.</p>
<p>They asked whether or not the sharpness of tuning,</p>
<p>the precision of orientation tuning of these neurons</p>
<p>is dependent on blood glucose level.</p>
<p>So just to cut to the chase, to give you the answer,</p>
<p>what they found is that when subjects are well-fed,</p>
<p>neurons that responded to vertical</p>
<p>responded very strongly to vertical,</p>
<p>but not very much at all to other angles</p>
<p>of what we call stimuli,</p>
<p>to lines that are 10 degrees or 20 degrees off.</p>
<p>If they looked at neurons that were primarily tuned,</p>
<p>that preferred horizontal lines,</p>
<p>they found the same thing, okay?</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t something unique to vertical lines.</p>
<p>What they basically found was the sharpness,</p>
<p>the precision of tuning of neurons in the brain</p>
<p>was best when subjects were fed.</p>
<p>And conversely, when subjects were fasted,</p>
<p>the orientation tuning of these neurons</p>
<p>became much broader.</p>
<p>What it meant was that a neuron</p>
<p>that normally would only respond to vertical</p>
<p>now responded to other angles of lines as well.</p>
<p>You might say, well, that&rsquo;s great, right?</p>
<p>These neurons that at one point could only do one thing</p>
<p>are now tuned to other things, but it&rsquo;s not so great</p>
<p>because what that means is that in the fasted state,</p>
<p>your perception of the outside world is actually distorted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s blurred.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as precise as it is when you&rsquo;re fed.</p>
<p>And when I say fed, what I really mean</p>
<p>is when glucose is available to neurons.</p>
<p>Now, for some of you, maybe many of you,</p>
<p>and including myself, intermittent fasting</p>
<p>or some variant thereof is actually a state that I like.</p>
<p>It allows me to focus.</p>
<p>For instance, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>and even earlier in this podcast,</p>
<p>I tend to eat my first meal sometime around 11 a.m.</p>
<p>And then I generally eat my last meal</p>
<p>sometime around 8 p.m., plus or minus an hour on either side.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not super strict about it.</p>
<p>And occasionally I&rsquo;ll wake up really hungry</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll eat something before 11 a.m.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not super strict about this intermittent fasting thing.</p>
<p>It just seems to be how my appetite works best</p>
<p>given my schedule, et cetera.</p>
<p>In the morning, I tend to be most focused.</p>
<p>And I always associated that with the fact</p>
<p>that I was fasted.</p>
<p>I just water and some caffeine.</p>
<p>About 90 minutes after waking up, I drink my caffeine,</p>
<p>but I hydrate from the time I get up, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I know a lot of other people have had the experience</p>
<p>of being fasted and feeling like</p>
<p>they have a lot of mental clarity.</p>
<p>When you are in a fasted state,</p>
<p>typically you&rsquo;re going to use fuels</p>
<p>that are available to the neurons</p>
<p>based on your intake of food the day before.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re using some glycogen.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re using some fat.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re using some blood sugar</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s derived from other storage sites in the body.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually use fat as a fuel source for neurons</p>
<p>under typical conditions,</p>
<p>but there are ways in which proteins and fats</p>
<p>and glycogen, et cetera,</p>
<p>are converted into fuel that neurons can use.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this study is that</p>
<p>the study says that when well-fed,</p>
<p>meaning when blood glucose sugar</p>
<p>is at a properly elevated level in the bloodstream,</p>
<p>it can be delivered to the brain in a way</p>
<p>that allows neurons to work best,</p>
<p>which is really all just to underscore</p>
<p>the point that I made earlier,</p>
<p>which is that your nervous system</p>
<p>is extremely metabolically demanding and it loves glucose.</p>
<p>Neurons love glucose.</p>
<p>So the takeaway from this study</p>
<p>is not that you should avoid fasting.</p>
<p>The takeaway from this study</p>
<p>is that there are elements of the fasted state,</p>
<p>in particular, the elevations</p>
<p>and things like epinephrine and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>also called adrenaline and noradrenaline,</p>
<p>that can give us this kind of clarity of mind</p>
<p>that many people are pursuing when they fast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of one of the reasons a lot of people fast.</p>
<p>They like the way that they feel mentally and physically.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s only fair to point out</p>
<p>that glucose is the preferred source of fuel for the brain.</p>
<p>And this study that I mentioned</p>
<p>is one of many studies that have explored</p>
<p>how nutritional status or blood glucose status</p>
<p>in the brain and body influence neuronal tuning</p>
<p>and neuronal function.</p>
<p>And it really points to the fact that ultimately,</p>
<p>your brain as an organ is a glucose-consuming machine.</p>
<p>Now, when you eat a food, that food is broken down.</p>
<p>And if it contains carbohydrates,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be converted into glucose.</p>
<p>And that glucose can&rsquo;t get directly</p>
<p>into the brain as a fuel source.</p>
<p>It actually has to be carried across</p>
<p>the so-called blood-brain barrier, the BBB.</p>
<p>And the actual metabolism of glucose</p>
<p>and the delivery of the glucose to the neurons</p>
<p>is carried out by a different cell type.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a cell type that you should all know about</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the most abundant cell type in your brain</p>
<p>and maybe even in your entire nervous system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the so-called astrocyte.</p>
<p>Astrocytes are one of several types of glia.</p>
<p>The word glia means glue,</p>
<p>but many people have taken that name, glia, glue,</p>
<p>to think that, oh, the only thing</p>
<p>that the astrocytes are doing</p>
<p>is just kind of holding things together.</p>
<p>Actually, the astrocytes are involved</p>
<p>in delivering glucose to the neurons.</p>
<p>They are critically involved</p>
<p>in shaping your neuronal function and brain plasticity,</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s ability to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>So these astrocytes are like the little waiters</p>
<p>and waitresses bringing glucose to the neurons,</p>
<p>and the neurons are going to do the heavy lifting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in perception and behavior and action.</p>
<p>So if prior to this episode,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t already realize that glucose, blood sugar,</p>
<p>is vital to the function of your brain</p>
<p>and other neurons of your nervous system, now you know.</p>
<p>And for those of you that have experienced</p>
<p>the increase in mental clarity</p>
<p>that comes after a properly timed, properly composed,</p>
<p>meaning it has the right macronutrients</p>
<p>and the right ratios, and a properly sized meal,</p>
<p>well, then, now you have justification</p>
<p>for eating something as a way</p>
<p>to improve the way that your brain works.</p>
<p>It turns out that your brain is going to work best</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s got glucose available.</p>
<p>Whether you like to fast or not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the reality of things.</p>
<p>The same thing is also true for the neurons in your body.</p>
<p>The way that you are able to move the limbs of your body,</p>
<p>the way you are able to perform exercise</p>
<p>or movement of any kind for that matter,</p>
<p>is because neurons called motor neurons</p>
<p>send electrical potentials to the muscle fibers.</p>
<p>They release a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine,</p>
<p>which causes contraction of the muscle fibers</p>
<p>and allows you to move your limbs.</p>
<p>Those neurons are also very metabolically demanding,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re doing demanding types</p>
<p>of physical work, and that could be cycling or running</p>
<p>or weightlifting or yoga or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>Those neurons require a ton of glucose.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had the experience</p>
<p>of having to think very hard</p>
<p>about how you&rsquo;re generating a movement</p>
<p>or force yourself to continue to endure in a given exercise,</p>
<p>you might&rsquo;ve thought, oh, you know, I&rsquo;m running out of fuel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m getting tired.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually the case sometimes,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that it feels like work</p>
<p>is because your so-called upper motor neurons,</p>
<p>the one that control the lower motor neurons</p>
<p>in your spinal cord, which control your muscles,</p>
<p>they have to be very metabolically active.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to engage in a reflexive movement</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just walking around</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re running continuously,</p>
<p>but when you suddenly have to focus on what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and you have to generate specific patterns</p>
<p>of motor movement, well, that feels demanding</p>
<p>because one, it increases the release of adrenaline</p>
<p>in your brain and body, which makes you feel</p>
<p>a little bit agitated and more alert,</p>
<p>but also deliberate thought,</p>
<p>deliberately controlling the way</p>
<p>that your brain and body is moving</p>
<p>requires more glucose uptake,</p>
<p>more energy in those very neurons.</p>
<p>And this is also why after doing a long bout of exercise,</p>
<p>you might be tired, but also if you do</p>
<p>a bout of skill learning of any kind,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;ve been reading and thinking</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re reading,</p>
<p>or if you had a intense conversation with somebody</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re really forcing yourself to listen</p>
<p>and hopefully they&rsquo;re listening to you too,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really trying to parse what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>and maybe you&rsquo;re doing that right now</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to really track something,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s work and that work requires glucose uptake</p>
<p>by neurons, both in the brain and in your body.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve established that glucose</p>
<p>is the preferred source of fuel for the nervous system,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to concentrate on a few of the other types</p>
<p>of sugars that we ingest on a common basis</p>
<p>and the impact that those have</p>
<p>on brain function and body function.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d particularly like to focus on fructose.</p>
<p>Fructose, of course, is found in fruit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also found in the infamous high fructose corn syrup,</p>
<p>which we will talk about today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that the concentrations</p>
<p>of fructose in fruit is quite low</p>
<p>compared to the concentrations of fructose</p>
<p>in high fructose corn syrup.</p>
<p>High fructose corn syrup is approximately 50% fructose,</p>
<p>which turns out to be an enormously high percentage</p>
<p>of anything really, especially when we contrast</p>
<p>that to the concentrations of fructose in fruit.</p>
<p>Fruits have other types of sugars in them as well.</p>
<p>You know, the sucrose content of most fruit</p>
<p>and fruit juices is low,</p>
<p>although there are some fruits like, you know,</p>
<p>melons, peaches, pineapples, and so forth</p>
<p>that contain, you know, a little less than 10% or so</p>
<p>of sucrose.</p>
<p>Things like mangoes can have a lot of sucrose,</p>
<p>but typically the amount of fructose,</p>
<p>fructose, I think is the proper pronunciation</p>
<p>that people are always correcting me,</p>
<p>fructose is anywhere from 1% to about 10%, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really going to vary quite a bit.</p>
<p>And many of you have probably heard</p>
<p>of the so-called glycemic index,</p>
<p>which is a basically a measure</p>
<p>of how fast blood sugar rises</p>
<p>after eating particular foods, et cetera.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to set aside the glycemic index for now,</p>
<p>we will come back to it.</p>
<p>It has some relationship</p>
<p>to the concentrations of fructose in fruit.</p>
<p>But the point that I&rsquo;d like to make is that fructose</p>
<p>as a sugar is handled very differently</p>
<p>in the body than is glucose.</p>
<p>But I also want to emphasize</p>
<p>that because the percentage of fructose in fruit</p>
<p>is rather low,</p>
<p>especially compared to high fructose corn syrup,</p>
<p>many people have demonized fructose</p>
<p>saying that fructose makes you fat</p>
<p>or that fruit makes you fat.</p>
<p>If you look at the data, that&rsquo;s not really the case.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that the concentrations</p>
<p>of fructose in fruit are so low</p>
<p>that unless someone is consuming a lot of fruit</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re consuming a lot of fruit</p>
<p>on the backdrop of a highly processed diet</p>
<p>or a diet that has a lot of other stuff</p>
<p>that they might not want to be ingesting,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really say that fructose is fattening.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think that there&rsquo;s any basis</p>
<p>for saying that fructose itself is bad.</p>
<p>Now, high fructose corn syrup is a different issue.</p>
<p>And too much consumption of anything,</p>
<p>but fructose included,</p>
<p>whether or not it comes from fruit or otherwise,</p>
<p>can be a problem for the ways that it impacts</p>
<p>the neural circuits that process sugar,</p>
<p>not just glucose, but fructose.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll illustrate those neural circuits in a bit,</p>
<p>and it will become very clear to all of you,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you have a background</p>
<p>in biology or metabolism, nutrition or otherwise,</p>
<p>why ingesting very high concentrations of fructose</p>
<p>is not going to be a good thing</p>
<p>for the way that your brain functions.</p>
<p>One of the key distinctions between glucose and fructose</p>
<p>is that fructose most likely</p>
<p>cannot directly access the brain.</p>
<p>It actually needs to be converted into glucose in the liver.</p>
<p>And the way that conversion occurs</p>
<p>feeds back to a set of hormones and neural pathways</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>which have a lot to do with appetite.</p>
<p>And to just summarize what is now a lot of very solid data,</p>
<p>fructose and specifically fructose</p>
<p>has the ability to reduce certain hormones</p>
<p>and peptides in our body,</p>
<p>whose main job is to suppress ghrelin.</p>
<p>As you recall, ghrelin is a hormone that increases</p>
<p>the longer it&rsquo;s been since we&rsquo;ve eaten.</p>
<p>And ghrelin makes us hungry</p>
<p>by stimulating particular neurons in our hypothalamus.</p>
<p>It actually makes us really want to eat.</p>
<p>And in particular,</p>
<p>really makes us want to eat sugary and fatty foods.</p>
<p>Fructose reduces the activity of the hormones</p>
<p>that reduce ghrelin.</p>
<p>And so the net consequence of that</p>
<p>is that fructose increases ghrelin.</p>
<p>So although I, and I think pretty much everyone out there,</p>
<p>save for a few individuals,</p>
<p>agrees that calories in, calories out</p>
<p>is the fundamental principle of weight loss,</p>
<p>weight maintenance, or weight gain,</p>
<p>ingesting fructose shifts our hormone system.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>our neural pathways within our brain, the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>to be hungrier regardless of how many calories we&rsquo;ve eaten.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Now, I also want to be absolutely clear.</p>
<p>This does not mean that eating an apple or eating a melon</p>
<p>or eating a couple of apricots or something</p>
<p>is going to make you hyperphagic.</p>
<p>Meaning it&rsquo;s going to make you just want to eat</p>
<p>and eat and eat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>But if you compare fructose and you compare glucose,</p>
<p>not only are they metabolized differently</p>
<p>in the brain and body, but in addition to that,</p>
<p>fructose has this impact of reducing the hormones</p>
<p>that reduce hunger hormones and neural circuits.</p>
<p>And so fructose does have this kind of twist</p>
<p>in its phenotype, right?</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s, I guess if fructose had a dating profile,</p>
<p>this would be a kind of a red flag in that profile</p>
<p>because fructose itself,</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s actually a pretty good fuel source in many ways,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s often packaged in things like fruits,</p>
<p>which bring along fiber and vitamins and minerals</p>
<p>that I think for many of us are things</p>
<p>that we should be eating more of and ingesting more of,</p>
<p>it can suppress the pathways that suppress hunger.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, it can increase hunger.</p>
<p>So current recommendations for most people</p>
<p>are to eat more fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>But for those of you that are trying to control your hunger,</p>
<p>ingesting a lot of fructose</p>
<p>is probably not going to be a good idea.</p>
<p>Certainly ingesting it from high fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>is not going to be a good idea</p>
<p>because of the enormous percentages of fructose</p>
<p>in high fructose corn syrup, 50% or sometimes even more.</p>
<p>But even from fruit, some people will find</p>
<p>that fruit really quenches their appetite.</p>
<p>Other people will find that fruit stimulates their appetite.</p>
<p>And I suppose if you&rsquo;re trying to stimulate your appetite,</p>
<p>then ingesting more fruit</p>
<p>might actually be advantageous to you.</p>
<p>So fructose provides a bridge for us</p>
<p>between a particular kind of sugar, hormone function,</p>
<p>in this case, ghrelin, and the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which leads us to the next question,</p>
<p>which is what is it about sugar</p>
<p>that makes it such an attractive thing for us?</p>
<p>Why do we like it so much?</p>
<p>And the obvious answer that most people arrive at is,</p>
<p>well, it just tastes really, really good.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s actually not the way it works.</p>
<p>The rewarding properties, as we say, of sugar,</p>
<p>whether or not they come in the form of sucrose or fructose</p>
<p>or foods that increase glucose to a very high level</p>
<p>actually is not just related to the taste</p>
<p>of the foods that produce that elevation</p>
<p>in glucose, sucrose, or fructose.</p>
<p>It is in part, but that&rsquo;s only part of the story.</p>
<p>And the rest of the story, once you understand it,</p>
<p>can actually place you in a position</p>
<p>to much better control your sugar intake of all kinds,</p>
<p>but also your food intake in ways that can allow you</p>
<p>to make much better choices about the foods you ingest.</p>
<p>And actually, at this point,</p>
<p>I should probably give a confession.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said today, and I&rsquo;ll say it again,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve said it on previous podcasts,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much of a sweet tooth,</p>
<p>and indeed that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And I can kind of pass on chocolate or ice cream</p>
<p>or things like that.</p>
<p>It seems like with each successive year,</p>
<p>sweet things are less and less appealing to me.</p>
<p>Of course, savory foods,</p>
<p>anything that is really fatty, salty, savory,</p>
<p>those don&rsquo;t last long in my presence.</p>
<p>But I always say I don&rsquo;t really like sweet things so much,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t, I like sweet people,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t tend to like sweet foods, which is true.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s probably one exception, and that&rsquo;s mangoes.</p>
<p>And it turns out that mangoes have the highest percentage</p>
<p>of sugar in them, in particular fructose,</p>
<p>as well as other forms of sugars.</p>
<p>So what I do, because I love mangoes so much,</p>
<p>is I will have mangoes probably twice a week,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll have them after some sort of resistance training</p>
<p>or hard run or something like that.</p>
<p>Because it is the case that after you exercise hard,</p>
<p>in particular, exercise that is of the high intensity</p>
<p>variety, that your body is more efficient</p>
<p>at using circulating blood sugar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s able to store that or use that for fuel.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;ll typically do is just take the mango,</p>
<p>actually eat the peels too.</p>
<p>I know that probably some people are going to cringe</p>
<p>when they hear that.</p>
<p>I find them delicious,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll just bite into those things like apples.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t eat the pits, however.</p>
<p>So now I want to take us on a journey</p>
<p>into the nervous system to explain the pathways</p>
<p>in the brain and body that regulate our appetite for sugar.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind what I already told you before,</p>
<p>which is that when we ingest foods,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re broken down into various components,</p>
<p>and glucose is going to be shuttled to the brain,</p>
<p>and of course, to other neurons in our spinal cord</p>
<p>and elsewhere, and to our muscles, et cetera,</p>
<p>in order for all of those cells and organs and tissues</p>
<p>to be able to function.</p>
<p>The fact that so many cells and organs and tissues</p>
<p>require glucose in order to function</p>
<p>has led to a situation where you have dedicated</p>
<p>neural machinery, pieces of your brain</p>
<p>that are almost entirely, if not entirely devoted</p>
<p>to seeking out of sugar or foods that contain sugars</p>
<p>and to make sure that you not only seek those out,</p>
<p>but you know where those foods are</p>
<p>and that you ingest more and more and more of them.</p>
<p>And there are two main ways that these neural circuits work.</p>
<p>In fact, we can say that there are two neural circuits</p>
<p>entirely that work in parallel,</p>
<p>and this is a common theme throughout the nervous system,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s parallel pathways.</p>
<p>Parallel pathways are the ways</p>
<p>that you can distinguish light from dark.</p>
<p>Parallel pathways are the ways that you can distinguish</p>
<p>high-pitched sounds from low-pitched sounds.</p>
<p>Parallel pathways are the ways that you can</p>
<p>flex your muscles versus extend your muscles.</p>
<p>For instance, if you move your wrist closer to your shoulder,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re flexing your bicep and you&rsquo;re actually inhibiting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually preventing the action of your tricep.</p>
<p>If you move your wrist away from your shoulder,</p>
<p>you are essentially using your extensor, your tricep,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re inhibiting the activity of your bicep.</p>
<p>So for every function in your body</p>
<p>that you might think is controlled by one brain area</p>
<p>or one neural circuit, almost always there are two</p>
<p>or more so-called parallel pathways that ensure</p>
<p>that that particular behavior happens.</p>
<p>Now, in the case of sugar consumption,</p>
<p>the two parallel pathways involve one pathway</p>
<p>related to the actual taste and the perception</p>
<p>of sweet tastes that lead not just you,</p>
<p>but every animal that we&rsquo;re aware of</p>
<p>to seek more sweet-containing foods.</p>
<p>The other parallel pathway is related</p>
<p>to the nutritive component of sweet foods,</p>
<p>meaning the degree to which a given food</p>
<p>will raise blood glucose.</p>
<p>I want to repeat that.</p>
<p>One pathway in your brain and body is devoted</p>
<p>to getting you to seek out sweet-tasting things</p>
<p>that you perceive as sweet.</p>
<p>And another parallel pathway is devoted</p>
<p>to getting you to seek out foods</p>
<p>that lead to increases in blood glucose.</p>
<p>It just so happens that the foods that lead</p>
<p>to big increases in blood glucose typically</p>
<p>are associated with that sweet taste.</p>
<p>Now, this is distinctly different than the neural pathways</p>
<p>that control seeking of savory foods or salty foods</p>
<p>or spicy foods for that matter, or bitter foods.</p>
<p>The sweet pathway is what we would call hardwired.</p>
<p>It exists as far as we know in every mammal</p>
<p>that even exists in fruit flies, hence fruit fly.</p>
<p>Basically getting sweet stuff into the body</p>
<p>might seem like it has a lot to do with the taste,</p>
<p>but it has just as much to do with the nutritive components</p>
<p>that sweet-tasting foods carry,</p>
<p>and the fact that your nervous system</p>
<p>and so many cells in your brain and body run on glucose.</p>
<p>If you recall earlier, I said, even if you ingest fructose,</p>
<p>fructose can be converted into glucose in the liver.</p>
<p>And I mentioned, of course,</p>
<p>that fructose may actually work directly on the brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still unclear for humans.</p>
<p>You know, the jury&rsquo;s still out on that.</p>
<p>We will see.</p>
<p>But the fundamental thing to understand here</p>
<p>is that when you think you want a piece of chocolate</p>
<p>or you think you want a piece of cake</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re craving something sweet,</p>
<p>you are both craving the taste</p>
<p>and your neurons are literally craving</p>
<p>the nutritive components that arrive with that taste.</p>
<p>And simply by understanding that can allow you</p>
<p>to circumvent some of the sugar cravings</p>
<p>that you might otherwise be a complete hopeless victim to.</p>
<p>Also in this episode, I will talk about ways</p>
<p>that you can sort of undermine or short-circuit</p>
<p>these circuits, if you will,</p>
<p>in order to reduce sugar cravings on a regular basis,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your goal.</p>
<p>Okay, two parallel pathways.</p>
<p>One of the parallel pathways</p>
<p>has to do with conscious perception.</p>
<p>So animals of all kinds, mice, rats, and humans</p>
<p>will prefer sugary tastes to non-sugary tastes.</p>
<p>When we eat something that tastes sweet,</p>
<p>we register that sweet taste by way of sweet receptors,</p>
<p>literally little ports or portals of neurons</p>
<p>on our tongue and on our palate.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but there are a lot of taste receptors on the soft palate</p>
<p>and around the mouth, on the sides of the mouth.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually tasting things, not just with your tongue</p>
<p>but with your entire mouth and your palate.</p>
<p>So when you ingest something sweet,</p>
<p>very quickly there are signals sent</p>
<p>from those neurons in your mouth</p>
<p>to brain areas that cause you to seek out</p>
<p>or at least pay attention to the source</p>
<p>and the abundance of those sweet things.</p>
<p>They literally change your perception.</p>
<p>In fact, there are beautiful neuroimaging studies</p>
<p>that show that when people ingest a sugary drink,</p>
<p>their perception of images of foods change very much</p>
<p>to make those foods appear more appetizing</p>
<p>and not just foods that contain sugar.</p>
<p>Results of those studies do show</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an increase, for instance,</p>
<p>in the perception of detail and images of ice cream</p>
<p>after you ingest a sweet drink</p>
<p>or even put like a hard candy into your mouth.</p>
<p>It will make you seek out sugary things more.</p>
<p>It will make sugary things look more appetizing</p>
<p>but also other foods more appetizing.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s important that people recognize that fact</p>
<p>that when you have a sweet taste in your mouth</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;ve tasted something sweet within your mouth,</p>
<p>I should say, your perception of food</p>
<p>has immediately shifted.</p>
<p>These are fast neural pathways,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get into some of the brain structures</p>
<p>in a moment, but these are fast neural pathways</p>
<p>that shift your entire self</p>
<p>toward seeking more sugary stuff and more food generally.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean</p>
<p>that you should never ingest anything sweet?</p>
<p>No, certainly I&rsquo;m not saying that.</p>
<p>Everyone has to decide for themselves</p>
<p>what the appropriate amount of sugar intake is.</p>
<p>But I find it remarkable when people say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, I need to get my sugar fix</p>
<p>or I need to have my chocolate</p>
<p>or I need to have a little bit of something</p>
<p>to just kind of take care of that sugar appetite.</p>
<p>Because in taking care of that sugar appetite,</p>
<p>maybe for the very disciplined of you,</p>
<p>you can just have that one piece of chocolate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s great and you can relish in it.</p>
<p>But it does shift the way</p>
<p>that you perceive other foods as well.</p>
<p>And the way it does that is through our,</p>
<p>probably if you&rsquo;re a listener to this podcast now,</p>
<p>old friend, but incredible neuromodulator dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a molecule that is released</p>
<p>from several places in the brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a so-called mesolimbic reward pathway,</p>
<p>which is a whole set of places in the brain</p>
<p>or circuits designed to get us motivated</p>
<p>and craving and in pursuit of things.</p>
<p>And then of course there are areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in movement</p>
<p>that are linked up with those areas involved in motivation.</p>
<p>That makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Why would you have a brain area involved in motivation</p>
<p>if you couldn&rsquo;t actually do something with that motivation?</p>
<p>So the way that your brain is designed</p>
<p>is when there&rsquo;s an increase in dopamine</p>
<p>in the mesolimbic reward pathway,</p>
<p>there are signals sent to an area of the brain</p>
<p>called the striatum.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to spend a little bit of time today</p>
<p>in the striatum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a dorsal part, meaning an upper part</p>
<p>and a ventral part, which means a lower part.</p>
<p>And the dopamine sent to those areas places us,</p>
<p>excuse me, into modes of action to pursue particular things.</p>
<p>Sugar or sweet tastes, I should say to be more specific,</p>
<p>have an incredibly potent ability</p>
<p>to activate dopamine release</p>
<p>within the mesolimbic reward pathway.</p>
<p>This has been shown over and over and over again.</p>
<p>In animal models and in humans.</p>
<p>This is especially true, I should mention,</p>
<p>through the ingestion of sweet liquids.</p>
<p>Now, this becomes a very important point to us</p>
<p>a little later on when we talk about the proliferation</p>
<p>of sodas and sweet drinks,</p>
<p>and dare I even say non-sugar or diet sodas.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get into that a little bit later.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most third rail topics in nutrition.</p>
<p>But when we ingest something sweet,</p>
<p>the perception of that sweet taste increases dopamine</p>
<p>in the mesolimbic reward pathways,</p>
<p>which then are conveyed to pathways for motor behavior.</p>
<p>And in general, place us into modes of focused action</p>
<p>toward getting more of whatever was sweet.</p>
<p>Again, for those of you that are very disciplined,</p>
<p>you can probably eat that one piece of chocolate</p>
<p>and be just fine.</p>
<p>But if you understand the way that dopamine works,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll realize is that when this dopamine pathway</p>
<p>is triggered, it tends to create not the sensation</p>
<p>or the perception of satiety,</p>
<p>of feeling like something is enough,</p>
<p>but rather to produce the sensation of wanting more.</p>
<p>As described in the episode that I hosted</p>
<p>with my phenomenal colleague</p>
<p>from Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Anna Lemke,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s an expert on addiction and dopamine pathways.</p>
<p>The dopamine circuits of the brain</p>
<p>have what we call a pleasure pain balance.</p>
<p>And there I&rsquo;m paraphrasing what Dr. Anna Lemke has said</p>
<p>and has written about in her beautiful book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dopamine Nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read that book, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Whether or not you have issues with addiction</p>
<p>or you know people that do or you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an incredibly important read,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re interested in understanding</p>
<p>motivated behaviors and ways to channel your behaviors</p>
<p>in life toward healthy motivated behaviors</p>
<p>and make sure that you avoid some of the common pitfalls</p>
<p>that people fall into, not just addiction,</p>
<p>but things like overuse of social media</p>
<p>or wasting time in general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a phenomenal book.</p>
<p>In that book, and of course, within research articles,</p>
<p>you will find evidence of this so-called pleasure pain</p>
<p>balance that exists within our dopamine circuits.</p>
<p>Nobody has dopamine circuits that allow them to escape</p>
<p>this pleasure pain balance.</p>
<p>And the way this works is that anytime that we engage</p>
<p>in a behavior or we ingest something</p>
<p>that increases our levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>there is a subsequent increase in the neural circuits</p>
<p>that control our sense of frustration, pain, and lack.</p>
<p>And you can actually notice this phenomenon.</p>
<p>If, for instance, you&rsquo;re somebody who really likes chocolate</p>
<p>or you really like something else,</p>
<p>pay attention to the way that you experience indulging</p>
<p>in that thing.</p>
<p>If you eat that piece of chocolate</p>
<p>and you really focus on savoring its amazing taste,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that it provides some quenching</p>
<p>of your desire for, let&rsquo;s say, sweet stuff</p>
<p>or chocolate or both.</p>
<p>But right as you stop experiencing that,</p>
<p>right as that chocolate intake tapers off,</p>
<p>as you swallow it down your throat,</p>
<p>or you just pause for a second afterwards,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll notice is that your brain and body</p>
<p>actually orient toward wanting more.</p>
<p>And that wanting of more is really the action</p>
<p>of the neural circuits that underlie pain</p>
<p>and are pushing your dopamine levels back down.</p>
<p>And when these circuits go awry, or I should say,</p>
<p>when people fail to control themselves</p>
<p>within the context of that pleasure-pain balance,</p>
<p>the typical behavior is to reach for yet another chocolate</p>
<p>or to then look for something that will quench that desire</p>
<p>and get dopamine levels back up.</p>
<p>Now, the way these pleasure-pain circuits work</p>
<p>is very diabolical because it turns out</p>
<p>that were you to take another piece of chocolate,</p>
<p>yes, your dopamine levels would go back up,</p>
<p>but not to the same extent</p>
<p>that they did the first bite of chocolate that you had.</p>
<p>In fact, we can say that the longer it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;ve indulged in something</p>
<p>that you really enjoy or would like,</p>
<p>the greater the dopamine you will experience</p>
<p>when you finally engage in that behavior</p>
<p>or indulge that thing, ingest that thing.</p>
<p>And the greater the dopamine increase,</p>
<p>the greater the subsequent action of those pain circuits.</p>
<p>So this puts you on a very complicated seesaw.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very wobbly, precarious state to be in,</p>
<p>which is not to say you shouldn&rsquo;t have a piece of chocolate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to say that the sweet taste of sweet things,</p>
<p>in particular things that we crave very much</p>
<p>and we wait and wait and wait,</p>
<p>and then we allow ourselves to indulge,</p>
<p>those trigger changes in our neurochemistry</p>
<p>and our neural circuits</p>
<p>that place us in a very vulnerable place</p>
<p>to either want more and more of that thing</p>
<p>or to seek out other ways to fill</p>
<p>that kind of emptiness that we feel or that gap,</p>
<p>like, oh, I would love more,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to allow myself more.</p>
<p>Now, again, I&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>that you shouldn&rsquo;t pursue pleasurable things.</p>
<p>I mean, this molecule dopamine exists for a reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, frankly,</p>
<p>because of its involvement in sex and reproduction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the reason we&rsquo;re all here in the first place,</p>
<p>because last time I checked,</p>
<p>the only way any of us got here was one way or another,</p>
<p>sperm met egg, and there was conception.</p>
<p>I still believe there are no exceptions to that</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of anyways.</p>
<p>That is a process where I should say</p>
<p>the events leading up to that process</p>
<p>typically involve dopamine in one way or another.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to that too, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>These dopamine pathways are not evil, they&rsquo;re not bad,</p>
<p>but once you understand the way they work,</p>
<p>you can leverage them to your advantage</p>
<p>as opposed to them leveraging you to their advantage.</p>
<p>Okay, so when you ingest something sweet,</p>
<p>you perceive that sweet taste,</p>
<p>and a cascade ensues within your brain</p>
<p>that makes you want more of the sweet thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the conscious pathway for sugar perception,</p>
<p>for sweet perception.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s the second pathway.</p>
<p>The second pathway is what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the post-ingestive reinforcing properties of sugar,</p>
<p>which is really just a fancy nerd speak way of saying</p>
<p>there are events that happen within your stomach</p>
<p>and below your conscious detection</p>
<p>that are also driving you to seek out</p>
<p>sweet tasting things independent of their taste</p>
<p>and foods that increase blood glucose</p>
<p>independent of their taste.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate the immense power</p>
<p>of these subconscious circuits for sugar seeking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to describe an experiment.</p>
<p>And this is just one experiment of many,</p>
<p>of dozens or more experiments done in animal models</p>
<p>and humans, which essentially illustrate the same thing.</p>
<p>And as I describe this experiment,</p>
<p>I think you will come to understand</p>
<p>the power of these circuits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link to this study in the caption.</p>
<p>The first author is Freeman.</p>
<p>The paper was published in Frontiers in Bioscience,</p>
<p>but there have been others, papers in Nature Neuroscience,</p>
<p>papers in Neuron, Cell Press Journals, et cetera.</p>
<p>Many, many journals, many, many papers.</p>
<p>If subjects are given the choice of drinking plain water</p>
<p>or a sweet tasting fluid,</p>
<p>their preference for the sweet tasting fluid</p>
<p>is much, much higher, right?</p>
<p>Sweet things taste better than plain water,</p>
<p>at least for most people and certainly for animals.</p>
<p>Now, if for instance, you take an animal</p>
<p>which completely lacks sweet receptors,</p>
<p>and you can do this through some molecular genetic tools</p>
<p>and gymnastics in the laboratory,</p>
<p>we call these knockout mice,</p>
<p>where you can knock out a particular receptor</p>
<p>for sweet taste, you can confirm</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no perception of sweet things</p>
<p>or at least no preference for sweet things</p>
<p>in those animals.</p>
<p>In humans, you can numb the mouth.</p>
<p>There are other pharmacologic ways</p>
<p>that you can eliminate sweet receptors in the mouth.</p>
<p>And by doing that, people will tell you,</p>
<p>no, I can&rsquo;t taste anything sweet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you could give them ice cream,</p>
<p>you could give them pure sucrose,</p>
<p>you give them table sugar,</p>
<p>and they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to perceive it as sweet.</p>
<p>If you eliminate the perception of sweet taste in the mouth</p>
<p>and you offer people or laboratory animals</p>
<p>water versus some sugar-containing solution,</p>
<p>you eliminate the preference for the sugary solution,</p>
<p>which tells us that the perception of sweet</p>
<p>is important for the preference for sweet-tasting drink.</p>
<p>This is also true for sweet-tasting foods,</p>
<p>I should mention.</p>
<p>However, in both animal models and in humans,</p>
<p>after about 15 minutes,</p>
<p>subjects start preferring the sugary water,</p>
<p>even though they can&rsquo;t taste that it is sweeter.</p>
<p>Okay, so to repeat that,</p>
<p>if you eliminate the ability to sense sweet,</p>
<p>to perceive sweetness in foods,</p>
<p>then you eliminate the preference for sweet beverages</p>
<p>or sweet foods.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not surprising.</p>
<p>But if you wait about 15 minutes,</p>
<p>the preference for the sweet beverage</p>
<p>or the sweet food comes back.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they can perceive the sweetness.</p>
<p>In fact, the way these experiments are done is very clever.</p>
<p>You offer people various cups of different things</p>
<p>or different food items,</p>
<p>and then you just look at what they eat more of</p>
<p>or what they prefer to eat more of.</p>
<p>So this experiment is so crucial because what it says</p>
<p>is that the preference for sugar-containing foods</p>
<p>is in part due to the sweetness of those foods,</p>
<p>but in part due to something else.</p>
<p>And this something else</p>
<p>is what we call the post-ingestive effect.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before, it took about 15 minutes,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve actually experienced this,</p>
<p>whether you realize it or not,</p>
<p>this phenomenon of post-ingestive rewarding properties</p>
<p>of sweet foods, meaning what happens in your body</p>
<p>when you ingest something</p>
<p>that increases your blood glucose very much</p>
<p>has no doubt controlled you</p>
<p>from the inside below your awareness.</p>
<p>This was happening to you and you didn&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>We all have neurons within our gut.</p>
<p>These neurons have a name, they are called neuropod cells.</p>
<p>Neuropod cells were famously discovered</p>
<p>by Professor Dr. Diego Borges at Duke University.</p>
<p>And these cells respond to, among other things,</p>
<p>to the presence of sugar within the gut.</p>
<p>So when we ingest a sugary food or drink,</p>
<p>or we ingest a food or drink</p>
<p>that simply contains fructose, sucrose, glucose,</p>
<p>or some other form of sugar</p>
<p>that later, through metabolism,</p>
<p>will be converted into glucose,</p>
<p>the neuropod cells are able to register the presence</p>
<p>of those sweet or glucose-stimulating foods.</p>
<p>And in response to that, send electrical signals,</p>
<p>because electrical signals</p>
<p>are the way neurons communicate,</p>
<p>up to the brain via the so-called vagus nerve,</p>
<p>the vagus nerve, of course, being a nerve pathway</p>
<p>famous for its role in relaxation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the assumption out there</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s always involved in relaxation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in a lot of things besides relaxation.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, these neuropod cells</p>
<p>send electrical signals through a particular highway</p>
<p>within the vagus to the so-called nodose ganglion.</p>
<p>This is a cluster, a ganglion is just a cluster of neurons.</p>
<p>And then the nodose ganglion sends on information</p>
<p>to the nucleus of the solitary tract.</p>
<p>The nucleus of the solitary tract is an area of the brain</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about extensively today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important for understanding sugar preference.</p>
<p>These neuropod cells also trigger activation</p>
<p>of dopamine pathways within the mesolimbic reward pathway.</p>
<p>In other words, there are signals conveyed from the gut,</p>
<p>meaning stomach and intestines, to the brain</p>
<p>anytime we ingest sweet foods,</p>
<p>but it has nothing to do with our perception</p>
<p>of them being sweet.</p>
<p>It has everything to do with the fact that sweetness</p>
<p>of food is almost always correlated with an ability</p>
<p>to increase blood glucose.</p>
<p>And the net effect of this is a parallel pathway</p>
<p>by which dopamine is increased further.</p>
<p>Now, the experiment that I described before</p>
<p>of animals or humans ingesting something</p>
<p>that contains sugar,</p>
<p>but not being able to perceive its sweetness.</p>
<p>And yet after a period of time,</p>
<p>still preferring that food or drink</p>
<p>to non-sugar-containing food or drinks,</p>
<p>even though they can&rsquo;t distinguish their tastes,</p>
<p>is dependent on these neuropod cells and related pathways.</p>
<p>What this means for you</p>
<p>is that anytime you eat something sweet,</p>
<p>that substance is actually causing your gut,</p>
<p>your stomach and your intestine,</p>
<p>or to be more precise, I should say,</p>
<p>that food substance is causing the neuropod cells</p>
<p>in your stomach and intestines</p>
<p>to send a parallel set of signals up to your brain</p>
<p>saying, eat more of that, or simply eat more,</p>
<p>eat more, eat more, and preferably eat more sweet foods.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve all heard of hidden sugars,</p>
<p>meaning the sugars that manufacturers have put into foods</p>
<p>and disguised them with other flavors.</p>
<p>I talked about this in the episode on salt,</p>
<p>using salt to mask the taste of sweetness</p>
<p>so that people ingest more sugar.</p>
<p>That is not an accident that hidden sugars</p>
<p>are often hidden with salt or with other flavors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done so that people will, meaning you or me,</p>
<p>will want to ingest more of a particular food</p>
<p>independent of how sweet that food tastes.</p>
<p>And in fact, some crackers, for instance,</p>
<p>chips, for instance, you might think,</p>
<p>oh, well, you know, chips, they&rsquo;re not sweet,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re salty and savory.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;ll mention I love salty, savory foods,</p>
<p>including certain foods.</p>
<p>I love kettle chips, for instance.</p>
<p>I try not to walk by them in the grocery store.</p>
<p>I usually have to eat one bag while I&rsquo;m in the store</p>
<p>and then another later.</p>
<p>The savory foods are often laden with these hidden sugars</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t register as sweetness,</p>
<p>but trigger the neuropod cells,</p>
<p>which then further trigger dopamine,</p>
<p>which make us want more of them.</p>
<p>Now, we may be able to resist eating more of them,</p>
<p>but it makes us crave more food in general.</p>
<p>Now, we will talk about ways to regulate this pathway,</p>
<p>to sort of intervene in this subconscious pathway.</p>
<p>But for now, I&rsquo;m hoping that just the understanding</p>
<p>that we all have this pathway,</p>
<p>this is hardwired into our body,</p>
<p>could potentially allow people to better understand</p>
<p>why is it that their cravings are so intense,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not necessarily just about the taste of that food.</p>
<p>And when you consider this in concert with the fact</p>
<p>that we have this dopamine-pain-pleasure balance,</p>
<p>excuse me, that I referred to earlier,</p>
<p>you start to realize that there are multiple mechanisms</p>
<p>that are hardwired into us</p>
<p>that make it especially hard to not eat the sweet thing,</p>
<p>or to not eat the food that we&rsquo;re craving.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>We have two major accelerators.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a car with two accelerators,</p>
<p>and we will talk about the brakes,</p>
<p>but two ways that really get us into forward motion</p>
<p>toward pursuing the consumption of sweet foods.</p>
<p>Now, if it doesn&rsquo;t already seem diabolical enough</p>
<p>that sweet things that we perceive as sweet</p>
<p>make us want to eat more of those because of dopamine,</p>
<p>and then send us down this pain-pleasure pathway</p>
<p>that I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>and the fact that we have this subconscious circuit</p>
<p>coming from the neuropod cells in our gut</p>
<p>that are registering the presence of sugar</p>
<p>or glucose-increasing foods in our gut</p>
<p>and sending those signals to the brain</p>
<p>for yet more dopamine-pain-pleasure challenges,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a third layer to this whole thing.</p>
<p>And that has to do with how sugar is metabolized</p>
<p>in the brain, or I should say how glucose is used.</p>
<p>Without getting into too much detail,</p>
<p>some of the more beautiful studies of neuroimaging</p>
<p>and evaluating which brain areas are active</p>
<p>when we eat certain foods</p>
<p>were done by Dr. Dana Small&rsquo;s lab at Yale University,</p>
<p>and in some of her previous work when she was elsewhere,</p>
<p>and of course, by other laboratories too.</p>
<p>And they used an approach</p>
<p>called positron emission tomography,</p>
<p>and they and others have used PET scanning,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called, positron emission tomography,</p>
<p>along with a tool called 2-deoxyglucose.</p>
<p>2-deoxyglucose is actually involved in the procedure</p>
<p>of seeing which brain areas are active</p>
<p>when people eat foods</p>
<p>or engage in other types of behaviors.</p>
<p>But the way that 2-deoxyglucose, sometimes shortened 2DG,</p>
<p>the way that it works</p>
<p>is to block glucose uptake from neurons</p>
<p>and instead bring along with it a marker</p>
<p>that one can see through imaging.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>a tool for looking at what parts of the brain are active</p>
<p>when eating particular foods</p>
<p>actually prevents foods such as sugar</p>
<p>from allowing glucose to get into particular neurons.</p>
<p>Now, that might seem like a bad situation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d say, well, wait,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to understand how sugar works in the brain,</p>
<p>and then you block the ability for sugar glucose</p>
<p>to bind to or be used by these neurons</p>
<p>because of the thing that you&rsquo;re using for the experiment.</p>
<p>Exactly, it&rsquo;s a huge problem,</p>
<p>but it turns out to be a huge problem</p>
<p>that led to a great insight.</p>
<p>And the great insight is this,</p>
<p>the preference for sweet tasting foods and liquids</p>
<p>is actually blocked by 2-deoxyglucose.</p>
<p>What that means experimentally,</p>
<p>but also in terms of what it means for you and me</p>
<p>in the real world</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s yet a third parallel pathway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related to the use of blood sugar,</p>
<p>the use of glucose by neurons</p>
<p>that further reinforces our desire to eat more sweet things.</p>
<p>And the preference for sweet foods</p>
<p>can actually be eliminated through 2-deoxyglucose.</p>
<p>Now, I definitely don&rsquo;t want people going out</p>
<p>and consuming 2-deoxyglucose.</p>
<p>This is a laboratory tool.</p>
<p>It is not something that you should be ingesting.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t go look it up and try and get some.</p>
<p>There might be other uses for it, but that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>The point is that it is the sweet taste of sugary foods.</p>
<p>It is the signals coming from your gut,</p>
<p>from your digestive tract to your brain.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the use of the metabolic consequences</p>
<p>of sugary foods that are acting as a three-pronged push</p>
<p>on your desire to consume more sugary foods.</p>
<p>So this car analogy that I used before</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s some weird car that has two accelerators,</p>
<p>it actually has three accelerators.</p>
<p>And so with three accelerators, all pushing the system hard,</p>
<p>we can say, wow, there must be something really special</p>
<p>about this pathway.</p>
<p>And indeed there is.</p>
<p>This pathway is the quickest source of fuel for the brain</p>
<p>and the rest of the nervous system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the preferred source of fuel</p>
<p>for the brain and nervous system.</p>
<p>And I realize as I say that all the ketonistas</p>
<p>are probably going, no,</p>
<p>actually ketones are the preferred source.</p>
<p>Okay, I acknowledge that.</p>
<p>There are conditions under which</p>
<p>you can bring your blood glucose very low,</p>
<p>and there are reasons to do that.</p>
<p>Actually, ketosis has been a terrifically successful</p>
<p>treatment for a lot of forms of epilepsy,</p>
<p>in particular pediatric epilepsy.</p>
<p>Many people do derive benefit from ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not knocking ketogenic diets.</p>
<p>But if you were to look at what neurons normally prefer,</p>
<p>meaning in a typical diet regimen, it would be glucose.</p>
<p>And the fact that fructose</p>
<p>is eventually converted to glucose.</p>
<p>The fact that when we ingest sucrose,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s eventually converted into a fuel that neurons can use.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very much in the glucose pathway.</p>
<p>What you basically arrive at is the fact</p>
<p>that your nervous system is a glucose-consuming machine,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got at least three pathways,</p>
<p>of which I&rsquo;ve described,</p>
<p>that are pushing on your brain consciously</p>
<p>and subconsciously to get you to seek</p>
<p>and consume more sugar.</p>
<p>Now that all sounds like a pretty depressing picture,</p>
<p>at least for those of you that are trying</p>
<p>to reduce your sugar intake.</p>
<p>And of course we can all reduce sugar intake</p>
<p>by way of sheer will.</p>
<p>We can not have those foods at home.</p>
<p>We can restrict ourselves from those.</p>
<p>But there are some things that we all can</p>
<p>and perhaps should do in order to regulate these pathways</p>
<p>such that we don&rsquo;t feel so controlled by them,</p>
<p>but rather that we control their output.</p>
<p>And of course they are us and we are them.</p>
<p>So this gets into all sorts of issues of consciousness</p>
<p>and free will that I certainly don&rsquo;t want to cover</p>
<p>in this episode.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, I think once you understand</p>
<p>that these circuits exist and you understand</p>
<p>that there are simple substitutions and modifications</p>
<p>that one can make to their food intake</p>
<p>that can work within these pathways</p>
<p>and even bypass some of these pathways,</p>
<p>you start to realize that you have a lot more control</p>
<p>over sugar intake and sugar appetite</p>
<p>than you previously thought.</p>
<p>Now, many of you have heard of the so-called glycemic index.</p>
<p>The glycemic index is a measure</p>
<p>of how quickly blood sugar rises</p>
<p>after ingesting particular foods</p>
<p>and very broadly speaking,</p>
<p>we can say that there are low glycemic index foods</p>
<p>of less than 55 typically is the measurement</p>
<p>or medium glycemic index foods,</p>
<p>which go from about 55 to 69</p>
<p>and then so-called high glycemic foods,</p>
<p>which are above 70.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s additional nuance</p>
<p>related to glycemic load</p>
<p>and many more features of the glycemic index.</p>
<p>A couple of things to understand</p>
<p>about how the glycemic index is measured.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d like to just briefly talk</p>
<p>about how the glycemic index can be leveraged</p>
<p>to short circuit some of the neural circuits</p>
<p>that would otherwise lead us to crave</p>
<p>and perhaps even ingest sugary foods.</p>
<p>First of all, measurements of glycemic indices of food</p>
<p>are typically made by having people</p>
<p>ingest those foods in isolation.</p>
<p>And in general, we can say that anytime we ingest fiber</p>
<p>and or fat lipids along with a particular food,</p>
<p>it will reduce the glycemic index of that particular food,</p>
<p>either the absolute level of blood glucose</p>
<p>that a particular food causes</p>
<p>or the rate at which that elevation in blood glucose occurs.</p>
<p>And this is why there are some seemingly paradoxical aspects</p>
<p>to sweet stuff in terms of the glycemic index.</p>
<p>For instance, ice cream has a lower glycemic index</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s ice cream that includes fat,</p>
<p>which I hope it would</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the good tasting ice cream in my opinion,</p>
<p>compared to something like mangoes or table sugar, right?</p>
<p>So the glycemic index is not something to hold wholly</p>
<p>in most cases,</p>
<p>because most people are not ingesting foods in isolation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a lot of argument</p>
<p>as to whether or not the glycemic index</p>
<p>is really as vital as some people claim.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the context</p>
<p>in which you ingest particular foods.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>after I do hard training of any kind,</p>
<p>meaning training that ought to deplete glycogen,</p>
<p>so hard resistance training,</p>
<p>I actually make it a point to ingest</p>
<p>some very sweet high glycemic foods like a mango.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also ingest some starches</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to replenish glycogen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also trying to spike my blood sugar a little bit</p>
<p>because that can be advantageous</p>
<p>in terms of certain strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy protocols, et cetera.</p>
<p>But most of the time I&rsquo;m avoiding these high glycemic foods</p>
<p>and high sugar foods.</p>
<p>I should point that out.</p>
<p>Now, why am I telling you about the glycemic index?</p>
<p>Well, if we zoom out and take our perspective</p>
<p>on all of this discussion about the glycemic index</p>
<p>through the lens of the nervous system,</p>
<p>and we remind ourselves</p>
<p>that neurons prefer glucose for energy,</p>
<p>and that all sweet things,</p>
<p>or things that we perceive as sweet,</p>
<p>but also sweet things that are ingested</p>
<p>and registered by those neuropod cells in our gut</p>
<p>trigger the release of dopamine</p>
<p>and trigger these neural circuits</p>
<p>to make us want to eat more of these foods,</p>
<p>what we start to realize</p>
<p>is that a sharp rise in blood glucose</p>
<p>or a very high degree of elevation in blood glucose</p>
<p>is going to be a much more potent signal</p>
<p>than will a more moderate rise in blood glucose</p>
<p>or a slower rise in blood glucose.</p>
<p>So if we think about the analogy of three accelerators,</p>
<p>meaning three parallel neural circuits,</p>
<p>all essentially there to get us to seek out</p>
<p>and consume more sweet tasting and sugary foods,</p>
<p>well, then the glycemic index</p>
<p>is sort of our measurement of how hard we are pushing down</p>
<p>or how fast we are pushing down on those three accelerators.</p>
<p>And so those of you that are trying to reduce sugar intake,</p>
<p>and you want to do that through an understanding</p>
<p>of how these neural circuits work,</p>
<p>and you want to short circuit some of the dopamine release</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s caused by ingesting sugary foods,</p>
<p>it can be advantageous to ingest sweet foods</p>
<p>either alone or in combination with foods</p>
<p>that reduce glycemic index or reduce glycemic load.</p>
<p>So that might mean making different food choices.</p>
<p>So paying attention to sweet tasting foods</p>
<p>that can satisfy sugar cravings,</p>
<p>but do not have as steep,</p>
<p>or I should say do not cause a steeper rise in blood sugar,</p>
<p>or it could mean consuming other foods</p>
<p>along with sweet foods</p>
<p>in order to reduce the glycemic index</p>
<p>and thereby slow or blunt the release of dopamine.</p>
<p>You might think, well, why would I want to do that?</p>
<p>I want the maximum dopamine output</p>
<p>in response to a given sweet food.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just want the level 10,</p>
<p>I want the level 100 output of dopamine,</p>
<p>but you really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because of the pleasure pain balance that dopamine causes.</p>
<p>And in fact, if we consider some of the non-food substances</p>
<p>that really push hard on these dopamine pathways,</p>
<p>we can come up with a somewhat sinister,</p>
<p>but nonetheless appropriate analogy.</p>
<p>The drug cocaine causes very robust,</p>
<p>potent increases in dopamine within the brain,</p>
<p>and typically causes people to want to ingest more cocaine</p>
<p>because of those sharp increases in dopamine.</p>
<p>But within the category of the drug cocaine,</p>
<p>there are various modes of ingestion.</p>
<p>Some people inhale it,</p>
<p>some people will inject it intravenously,</p>
<p>some people will smoke it.</p>
<p>And those different forms of taking cocaine</p>
<p>actually impact the dopamine circuits differently.</p>
<p>And it turns out that crack cocaine,</p>
<p>the smokable form of cocaine rock,</p>
<p>increases dopamine to a very high degree,</p>
<p>but also very, very quickly.</p>
<p>And it is the sharp rise in dopamine over time,</p>
<p>not so much the absolute level of dopamine</p>
<p>that makes crack cocaine so absolutely addictive.</p>
<p>So sometimes you&rsquo;ll hear, you know, sugar is like crack.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s getting a little extreme</p>
<p>because even though I don&rsquo;t think the measurements</p>
<p>have been done in the same experiment,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s reasonable to think</p>
<p>that the absolute level of dopamine</p>
<p>caused by ingesting sugar, at least for most people,</p>
<p>is not going to be as high as the absolute level</p>
<p>of dopamine caused by smoking crack.</p>
<p>Of course, it goes without saying,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t do cocaine in any form, by the way.</p>
<p>It is appropriate to say</p>
<p>that the rate of dopamine increase over time</p>
<p>has a profound effect on how people will,</p>
<p>and if people will, go on to want to pursue more</p>
<p>of what caused that increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m basically saying is,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to ingest sweet foods</p>
<p>in order to satisfy a sweet craving,</p>
<p>ingesting sweet foods for which the glycemic index is lower</p>
<p>or in which you&rsquo;ve adjusted those glycemic index foods</p>
<p>through the co-ingestion of fiber or maybe fat</p>
<p>might be beneficial.</p>
<p>So is this justification for putting peanut butter</p>
<p>on that piece of chocolate</p>
<p>or for having a bowl of ice cream</p>
<p>along with the mango that you&rsquo;re craving?</p>
<p>In some sense, yes.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s also the issue of how sweet</p>
<p>and how delicious something tastes.</p>
<p>Highly palatable foods, absolutely delicious foods</p>
<p>trigger that one neural circuit,</p>
<p>that one accelerator that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>in terms of our analogy of three accelerators.</p>
<p>And the more delicious something tastes within our mouth,</p>
<p>the further increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>So if you really wanted to adjust your sugar cravings</p>
<p>and you really still want to ingest some sugary foods,</p>
<p>you probably would be better off combining fiber</p>
<p>with that sugary or sweet food.</p>
<p>Now, I do realize that it&rsquo;s somewhat unusual</p>
<p>and you probably get some strange stares</p>
<p>if you decided to consume broccoli, for instance,</p>
<p>along with your chocolate or with another dessert</p>
<p>that would otherwise cause a steep increase in blood sugar</p>
<p>and has a high glycemic index.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, if your goal</p>
<p>is to blunt your sugar cravings,</p>
<p>what you really need to do is blunt that dopamine increase.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is trying to reduce the dopamine signal</p>
<p>that is the consequence of ingesting sweet foods.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about doing that</p>
<p>through these different parallel pathways,</p>
<p>not just by preventing sweet taste,</p>
<p>but also by preventing the post-ingestive effects</p>
<p>of sweet foods.</p>
<p>And of course, the backdrop to all of this</p>
<p>is that most of us, again, most of us, not all of us,</p>
<p>should probably be ingesting fewer refined sugars.</p>
<p>Certainly there are exceptions to that,</p>
<p>but I think the bulk of data point to the fact</p>
<p>that ingesting these highly palatable,</p>
<p>certainly highly palatable, highly processed foods</p>
<p>or foods that contain a lot of high fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>can be really deleterious to our health, especially in kids.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to cite off a bunch of statistics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve all heard them before that, you know,</p>
<p>for hundreds of years, we ingested, you know,</p>
<p>the equivalent of a few cups or pounds of sugar per year.</p>
<p>And, you know, now people are ingesting hundreds of pounds</p>
<p>of sugar per year.</p>
<p>The major culprit always seems to be sugary drinks,</p>
<p>meaning soft drinks, and I think indeed that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>I do want to point out the incredible work</p>
<p>of Dr. Robert Lustig, who&rsquo;s a pediatric endocrinologist</p>
<p>at University of California, San Francisco,</p>
<p>who was really early in the game of voicing the dangers</p>
<p>of so-called hidden sugars and highly processed foods.</p>
<p>There are other people, of course, now talking about this.</p>
<p>His laboratory has done important work showing,</p>
<p>for instance, that if high fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>or even just fructose is replaced with glucose,</p>
<p>even if the same number of calories is ingested,</p>
<p>that there are important, meaning significant reductions</p>
<p>in type two diabetes,</p>
<p>some of the metabolic syndromes associated</p>
<p>with high fructose corn syrup and on and on and on.</p>
<p>And of course there are other culprits in type two diabetes.</p>
<p>There are other factors that are going to lead to obesity,</p>
<p>but I think the work from Lustig and others</p>
<p>has really illustrated that we should all be trying</p>
<p>to reduce our intake of highly refined sugars</p>
<p>and high fructose corn syrup,</p>
<p>and certainly trying to reduce our intake</p>
<p>of very sugary drinks, not just soft drinks,</p>
<p>but also fruit juices that contain a lot of sugar.</p>
<p>Now, even for people that are of healthy weight</p>
<p>and who don&rsquo;t have metabolic syndromes,</p>
<p>there may be an additional reason to not want</p>
<p>to ingest very sweet foods and highly refined sugars.</p>
<p>And this has to do with a new and emerging area</p>
<p>of nutrition neuroscience.</p>
<p>And I want to point out that these are new data, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a lock.</p>
<p>The double blind placebo controlled studies</p>
<p>in large populations have not been finished.</p>
<p>So I want to make sure that that&rsquo;s clear,</p>
<p>but I also want to make clear</p>
<p>what some of the really exciting data</p>
<p>coming from Dana Small&rsquo;s lab at Yale</p>
<p>and from other laboratories are showing.</p>
<p>And this has to do with what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>conditioned taste preference.</p>
<p>Using a kind of Pavlovian paradigm,</p>
<p>what they do is they have people,</p>
<p>and these studies were done in people,</p>
<p>ingest maltodextrin, which increases blood glucose.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have much flavor,</p>
<p>but even if it does have a little bit of subtle flavor,</p>
<p>the maltodextrin is cloaked by some other flavor.</p>
<p>And by cloaking it with that other flavor</p>
<p>or pairing it with that other flavor,</p>
<p>what they find is that over time,</p>
<p>because the maltodextrin increases blood glucose</p>
<p>and they are ingesting a particular flavor</p>
<p>along with that maltodextrin,</p>
<p>they can then remove the maltodextrin</p>
<p>and the flavor will induce an increase in insulin.</p>
<p>The increase in insulin, of course,</p>
<p>is the consequence of the fact</p>
<p>that anytime there&rsquo;s a rise in blood glucose,</p>
<p>provided the person isn&rsquo;t diabetic,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a parallel increase in insulin.</p>
<p>Now, this is very interesting because what it says is,</p>
<p>well, at a first pass, it says that we are very Pavlovian</p>
<p>in terms of our physiological responses to foods</p>
<p>and particular flavors come to be associated</p>
<p>with particular patterns of blood glucose increase</p>
<p>and hence patterns of insulin increase</p>
<p>because of course insulin manages glucose</p>
<p>in the bloodstream, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>This also has implications for understanding</p>
<p>things like artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>And here, I want to highlight</p>
<p>that this is still very controversial work,</p>
<p>needs more data, but nonetheless,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share it with you for consideration.</p>
<p>The small laboratory has done studies in humans,</p>
<p>both in adults and in children,</p>
<p>showing that if the flavor of artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>is paired with maltodextrin</p>
<p>and then the maltodextrin is removed,</p>
<p>that the artificial sweetener taste itself</p>
<p>can subsequently increase insulin in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>In other words, taking something that increases blood sugar,</p>
<p>attaching a flavor experience to that,</p>
<p>having children or adults ingest that thing</p>
<p>allows the nervous system to associate that flavor</p>
<p>with that increase in blood glucose,</p>
<p>but then you can remove the glucose increasing substance</p>
<p>and the flavor alone will increase insulin</p>
<p>because insulin typically follows blood glucose.</p>
<p>So this is a conditioning effect.</p>
<p>Now, the reason these data are controversial</p>
<p>is several fold.</p>
<p>First of all, the landscape around the discussion</p>
<p>around artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>is definitely what I would call a barbed wire topic.</p>
<p>And I want to preface what I&rsquo;m about to say next</p>
<p>by saying I actually ingest artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>I will have the occasional diet soda, not every day,</p>
<p>maybe, I don&rsquo;t know, once or twice a month.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly like the taste,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll do it just because it&rsquo;s around</p>
<p>and I want some caffeine and I like the carbonation</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m on a plane or something.</p>
<p>I do ingest plant-based non-caloric sweeteners.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there have not been high quality studies</p>
<p>of plant-based non-caloric sweeteners</p>
<p>in the context that I&rsquo;m referring to here, okay?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, these studies show that particular flavors</p>
<p>can be conditioned to cause an insulin increase</p>
<p>and the flavor associated with certain</p>
<p>artificial sweeteners is included in that category</p>
<p>of flavors that can induce insulin,</p>
<p>even in the absence of something</p>
<p>that can increase blood glucose.</p>
<p>Now, the simple takeaway from these studies</p>
<p>would be the following.</p>
<p>And this is actually the one interpretation</p>
<p>that Dana Small has offered to her data,</p>
<p>but she offers other interpretations as well.</p>
<p>One interpretation is that if people are going to ingest</p>
<p>artificial sweeteners and they do that along with foods</p>
<p>that very sharply increase blood glucose,</p>
<p>then there is the potential, highlight the potential,</p>
<p>for those same artificial sweeteners to increase insulin</p>
<p>even in the absence of food.</p>
<p>In other words, let&rsquo;s just draw the scenario out</p>
<p>in the real world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having a diet soda</p>
<p>along with a cheeseburger and fries.</p>
<p>You do that every day for lunch, okay?</p>
<p>This somewhat extreme example, but natural world example.</p>
<p>You do that every day for lunch,</p>
<p>and then you just have a diet soda alone.</p>
<p>The extreme interpretation of the data</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve collected says, well,</p>
<p>that diet soda alone will increase insulin,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s no increase in blood glucose</p>
<p>because you haven&rsquo;t ingested food with it</p>
<p>because you conditioned that taste of artificial sweetener</p>
<p>to the experience of a rise in glucose and hence insulin.</p>
<p>Now, the counter argument to this would be,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s a very unusual situation.</p>
<p>Maltodextrin causes big increases in blood glucose,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s not really a fair experiment</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s not a natural world experiment.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a decent assessment,</p>
<p>although I will point out that one of the reasons</p>
<p>why this study is so controversial</p>
<p>or why these data are so controversial</p>
<p>is that the experiment actually had to be stopped,</p>
<p>and particularly the experiment in children</p>
<p>had to be stopped because the changes in insulin</p>
<p>that were observed early in the study were so detrimental</p>
<p>that the institutional review board quite appropriately said</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t do this to these kids.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re experiencing these odd shifts in insulin</p>
<p>that are not healthy for them</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re just ingesting artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>in the absence of these glucose increasing foods.</p>
<p>So once again, I do ingest artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that they are dangerous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that they are not dangerous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that you have to decide for yourself.</p>
<p>In previous episodes, I&rsquo;ve highlighted</p>
<p>that artificial sweeteners have been shown</p>
<p>in studies of animals that when given in very high doses,</p>
<p>sucralose in particular,</p>
<p>there can be fairly robust disruption to the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>which is vital for immune health</p>
<p>and brain health, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But thus far, our knowledge</p>
<p>of how artificial sweeteners negatively impacts</p>
<p>or positively impacts, I should say,</p>
<p>the microbiome and other deleterious effects</p>
<p>on the body has mainly been explored in animal studies.</p>
<p>Again, the work by Dana Small has been done in humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some parallel work by others in animal models.</p>
<p>I bring it up today to illustrate the following point.</p>
<p>Normally we have a pathway</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have to condition at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there from birth whereby ingestion of sweet foods</p>
<p>causes increases in dopamine.</p>
<p>And there are parallel pathways by which neurons in our gut</p>
<p>and elsewhere in our body trigger further increases</p>
<p>in dopamine.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no need for a conditioned response</p>
<p>or to become Pavlovian about this, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hardwired to want to eat sweet things</p>
<p>by at least two and probably three parallel pathways.</p>
<p>Now, the work from Dana Small&rsquo;s lab and others</p>
<p>that have illustrated this conditioned flavor preference,</p>
<p>I think beautifully show that any flavor that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with a glucose spike or a long sustained increase</p>
<p>in glucose can also be conditioned.</p>
<p>In other words, the circuits for dopamine</p>
<p>that reinforce the desire to eat particular things</p>
<p>is not unique to the sugar pathway.</p>
<p>And this is one of the reasons I believe</p>
<p>why ingestion of sweet foods doesn&rsquo;t just lead us</p>
<p>to want to eat more sweet foods.</p>
<p>I think that is absolutely clear based on animal data</p>
<p>and on human data.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s robust.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the stuff of textbooks now.</p>
<p>But in addition, ingesting sweet foods and or foods</p>
<p>that raise blood glucose,</p>
<p>but that we don&rsquo;t perceive as sweet.</p>
<p>So for instance, foods with hidden sugars,</p>
<p>sugars that have been masked by salty or spicy tastes,</p>
<p>increases our desire for glucose elevating foods</p>
<p>and food generally.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the only logical interpretation</p>
<p>of the data that I can arrive at.</p>
<p>So for people that struggle with regulating their appetite</p>
<p>or with regulating their sugar appetite,</p>
<p>I think the understanding of conditioned flavor preference</p>
<p>while a little bit complicated ought to be useful</p>
<p>in trying to navigate reducing sugar cravings</p>
<p>and sugar intake.</p>
<p>As a segue into tools to control sugar intake</p>
<p>as a means to both regulate sugar intake itself</p>
<p>as well as food intake overall</p>
<p>and steer us towards healthier choices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about some of the special populations</p>
<p>out there that might want to be especially wary</p>
<p>of having a dysregulated sugar appetite system.</p>
<p>And the group I&rsquo;m referring to specifically</p>
<p>are those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,</p>
<p>or I should say, and or people who have issues</p>
<p>with focus and attention generally.</p>
<p>And I think more and more nowadays,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing that people are having a hard time focusing.</p>
<p>This probably has something to do with our interactions</p>
<p>with electronic devices.</p>
<p>As I always say, if a picture is worth a thousand words,</p>
<p>a movie is worth a million pictures.</p>
<p>And the fact that we can access so many movies</p>
<p>just by scrolling with our thumb</p>
<p>is something that the nervous system</p>
<p>has just never contended with before in human history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident of that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that it can&rsquo;t deal with it.</p>
<p>The question is, what&rsquo;s the trade-off?</p>
<p>You know, what are the consequences of that?</p>
<p>So attention and ability to focus is obviously key</p>
<p>to success in school, success in relationships,</p>
<p>success in the workplace and success in life.</p>
<p>We could probably even go so far as to say</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s ability to succeed in anything</p>
<p>is proportional to one&rsquo;s ability to focus</p>
<p>and then deliberately defocus</p>
<p>when the time comes to defocus, right?</p>
<p>Because we all need rest and we need to disengage</p>
<p>and then re-engage.</p>
<p>If you look at the sum total of the meta-analyses</p>
<p>and the clinical data on ADHD and nutrition,</p>
<p>you arrive at a pretty clear answer,</p>
<p>which is that sugar consumption,</p>
<p>in particular highly refined sugars,</p>
<p>is just not good for people with ADHD</p>
<p>or with attentional issues.</p>
<p>Now, as I say that, I also want you to recall</p>
<p>the earlier study that I referred to</p>
<p>whereby the tuning of neurons in the brain</p>
<p>is highly dependent on glucose.</p>
<p>So this doesn&rsquo;t mean consuming no glucose</p>
<p>is going to be a good idea.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>is necessarily the best diet for ADHD,</p>
<p>although there are some people pursuing that</p>
<p>and exploring that and we&rsquo;ll do yet another episode</p>
<p>on ADHD at some point that goes a little bit deeper</p>
<p>into that because there&rsquo;s some new data.</p>
<p>I did do a very long and fairly extensive episode on ADHD.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to look that up if you like in our archive,</p>
<p>excuse me, in our archive at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all timestamped.</p>
<p>So, you know, because a number of people said,</p>
<p>oh, you know, it&rsquo;s an episode on ADHD</p>
<p>and you made it two and a half hours long.</p>
<p>Yes, we did because we wanted it to be as comprehensive</p>
<p>as we could at the time, but it is timestamped.</p>
<p>So you can just jump to the particular topics of interest</p>
<p>in their short little cassettes there.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;d like to know upon what I&rsquo;m basing</p>
<p>this statement that sugar consumption</p>
<p>and highly refined sugar consumption</p>
<p>is potentially bad for ADHD,</p>
<p>basing this mainly on the conclusions</p>
<p>of a really nice paper that the title of the paper</p>
<p>is Sugar Consumption, Sugar-Sweetened Beverages</p>
<p>and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,</p>
<p>A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</p>
<p>And this is a paper,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll put a link to this in the caption.</p>
<p>This was published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine,</p>
<p>which is a bit of an atypical journal in some sense,</p>
<p>but I really like this meta-analysis.</p>
<p>The sum total of this meta-analysis is really that</p>
<p>when especially kids get beyond four sugary drinks per week,</p>
<p>so four sodas of, you know, typical 12 ounce soda,</p>
<p>when they get past four 12 ounce sugary sodas,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t, as far as I know,</p>
<p>look at artificial sweetened sodas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you start to see a shift</p>
<p>towards more negative outcomes,</p>
<p>more symptoms of existing ADHD.</p>
<p>Now, where the controversy comes in is whether or not</p>
<p>sugar consumption can actually trigger or cause ADHD.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we can conclude that at all at this time.</p>
<p>And this review, if you decide to check it out,</p>
<p>review slash meta-analysis, I should say,</p>
<p>if you decide to check it out,</p>
<p>goes into some of the nuance around that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s also interesting in terms of ADHD and sugar intake,</p>
<p>and probably has relevance to all of us,</p>
<p>is that they also cover some of the interesting data</p>
<p>showing that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>can actually be beneficial for people,</p>
<p>in particular, kids with ADHD.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about the utility of omega-3s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been shown in various studies</p>
<p>that have compared omega-3 fatty acid intake</p>
<p>to, say, prescription antidepressants like SSRIs,</p>
<p>like Prozac, Zoloft, and similar, fluoxetine.</p>
<p>And the results of those studies are pretty clear,</p>
<p>at least to me, that provided that one gets</p>
<p>at least one gram of EPA, essential fatty acid,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just getting one gram per day,</p>
<p>but one or more grams per day</p>
<p>of the EPA form of essential fatty acid,</p>
<p>can rival some prescription antidepressants</p>
<p>and or decrease the amount of antidepressants</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required to take,</p>
<p>which for a lot of people can be a very useful thing</p>
<p>because of the side effect profile</p>
<p>of many of those antidepressants.</p>
<p>Of course, talk to your psychiatrist, talk to your doctor,</p>
<p>but the omega-3s are no doubt powerful.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there&rsquo;s a whole story</p>
<p>about omega-3s in heart health.</p>
<p>And of course, like anything else,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some controversy around omega-3s,</p>
<p>but I think the data are clear enough to me</p>
<p>around mood and cardiovascular health</p>
<p>that certainly I personally ingest them.</p>
<p>But as always, I always say,</p>
<p>anytime you&rsquo;re going to add or remove anything</p>
<p>from your nutrition, supplementation, exercise,</p>
<p>or otherwise your lifestyle,</p>
<p>definitely consult with a board-certified physician.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just say that to protect me,</p>
<p>I say that to protect you.</p>
<p>You are responsible for your health ultimately.</p>
<p>So omega-3 supplementation has been shown</p>
<p>to be beneficial for ADHD.</p>
<p>Why am I talking about this in the context of an episode</p>
<p>on sugar and the nervous system?</p>
<p>Well, if you remember those neuropod cells,</p>
<p>those cells in your gut that respond to sugar</p>
<p>and send signals up to the brain</p>
<p>to cause the release of dopamine,</p>
<p>well, it turns out that neuropod cells</p>
<p>also respond to amino acids and to fatty acids,</p>
<p>in particular, essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>So these cells that we call neuropod cells</p>
<p>have three jobs.</p>
<p>One is to detect levels of sugar in the gut.</p>
<p>The other is to detect levels of amino acids</p>
<p>and to detect levels of particular essential fatty acids</p>
<p>and communicate that information to the brain.</p>
<p>And I should point out,</p>
<p>when I say communicate that information,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not actually saying,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s amino acids here,</p>
<p>or hey, there&rsquo;s sugar here,</p>
<p>or hey, there&rsquo;s essential fatty acids,</p>
<p>because the language of these cells is somewhat generic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the firing of electrical potentials,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the key point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generic, and all three, or any of those three,</p>
<p>sugar, essential fatty acids, or amino acids</p>
<p>will trigger these neurons to signal to the brain</p>
<p>to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>And it is not coincidental</p>
<p>that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation</p>
<p>can help ameliorate some of the symptoms of ADHD</p>
<p>by way of presumably increasing dopamine</p>
<p>in this neuropod to dopamine pathway</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>The whole thing has a very nice logical structure to it</p>
<p>and points to, yet again,</p>
<p>the immense value of bringing the proper amounts,</p>
<p>maybe even supplementing the proper amounts</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>and the proper amounts of amino acids into the gut</p>
<p>as a way to supplant some of the stimulation</p>
<p>of these pathways that would otherwise be caused by sugar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a version of this where one could say,</p>
<p>if you want to reduce sugar cravings,</p>
<p>you might consider increasing</p>
<p>certain forms of amino acid intake</p>
<p>or certain forms of fatty acid intake.</p>
<p>So what are some ways that we can reduce our sugar cravings?</p>
<p>And ideally, ways that we can do that</p>
<p>that also benefit us in other ways,</p>
<p>both nutritionally and from the neuroscience standpoint?</p>
<p>Well, these neuropod cells that respond to</p>
<p>and signal the brain when we ingest sugar,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, also respond to amino acids</p>
<p>and essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>We already talked about the essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>I make it a particular point to ingest</p>
<p>anywhere from one to three grams, that&rsquo;s grams,</p>
<p>of EPA essential fatty acid per day.</p>
<p>I make it a point to do that</p>
<p>with the ingestive high quality omega-3s.</p>
<p>For me, the simplest way to do that,</p>
<p>and I think for most people,</p>
<p>the lowest cost way to do that</p>
<p>is to use some liquid form of fish oil</p>
<p>or some capsule form of fish oil.</p>
<p>You really do have to see how much essential fatty acid</p>
<p>in the form of EPA is in those.</p>
<p>If you try and do that only through capsules,</p>
<p>it can get kind of expensive</p>
<p>depending on which particular brands you use.</p>
<p>Some have more EPA, some less.</p>
<p>You can, of course, also do this through foods.</p>
<p>You can do this with non-fish sources</p>
<p>through things like algae, and there&rsquo;s some other forms.</p>
<p>You can look it up online now,</p>
<p>plant-based sources of EPAs.</p>
<p>You can do this with high quality fish oil.</p>
<p>In any case, that does seem,</p>
<p>at least based on a modest amount,</p>
<p>but nonetheless solid literature,</p>
<p>to reduce sugar craving somewhat,</p>
<p>but that could easily be by mere replacement of calories.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know yet based on human studies</p>
<p>whether or not the ingestion of those EPAs</p>
<p>is specifically activating the neuropod cells,</p>
<p>which specifically activates dopamine release</p>
<p>and bypasses the need for, or the craving for sugar.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that yet,</p>
<p>but logically it holds up to assume that.</p>
<p>The fact that these neuropod cells,</p>
<p>and I should say other neurons within the gut,</p>
<p>respond very robustly</p>
<p>to the presence of particular amino acids</p>
<p>is also a potential lever</p>
<p>by which one could reduce sugar cravings.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an interesting literature</p>
<p>around the amino acid glutamine,</p>
<p>in particular supplementing with the amino acid glutamine</p>
<p>as it relates to sugar cravings,</p>
<p>and certainly as it relates to other aspects of the gut,</p>
<p>in particular leaky gut.</p>
<p>The use of supplemental glutamine</p>
<p>to try and treat leaky gut is not a new phenomenon.</p>
<p>There are other approaches too, of course,</p>
<p>but there are many people who are experimenting</p>
<p>with supplementing with glutamine several grams per day,</p>
<p>often even five grams distributed</p>
<p>through three or four different servings throughout the day</p>
<p>as a way to blunt their sugar cravings.</p>
<p>Now, there has not yet been a large-scale clinical trial</p>
<p>using glutamine to reduce sugar cravings,</p>
<p>but the results of the few studies that I looked at</p>
<p>my understanding of the logic of these neural circuits,</p>
<p>including the neuropod cells,</p>
<p>brings us to a conclusion that it makes sense</p>
<p>why if there&rsquo;s a population of neurons within our gut</p>
<p>that responds very robustly</p>
<p>to the presence of sugar, fatty acids, or amino acids,</p>
<p>that the intake of particular amino acids</p>
<p>would allow the dopamine pathways</p>
<p>that might otherwise be triggered by sugar</p>
<p>to be triggered by something like glutamine,</p>
<p>which has very few or no calories.</p>
<p>And in fact, having talked about this previously,</p>
<p>a number of people that I know went out and tried this.</p>
<p>Now, this is, of course, is what I call anecdata, right?</p>
<p>This is not a quality peer-reviewed study.</p>
<p>This is anecdata.</p>
<p>Many of them have reported back</p>
<p>that they actually feel</p>
<p>as if their sugar cravings are reduced.</p>
<p>I know some people who actually take glutamine</p>
<p>and mix it with full-fat cream</p>
<p>and take it kind of like a shot of full-fat cream,</p>
<p>which sounds absolutely delicious, by the way.</p>
<p>Glutamine is a little bit chalky,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not that great tasting to ingest with sugar.</p>
<p>I should mention that if you do try</p>
<p>and take this approach of ingesting glutamine</p>
<p>to reduce sugar cravings,</p>
<p>you want to increase the amount of glutamine</p>
<p>that you take somewhat gradually.</p>
<p>It can create some gastric distress.</p>
<p>If you just, you know,</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t take a big tablespoon of it,</p>
<p>throw it in water, and chug it down three times a day.</p>
<p>Some of you with very hearty stomachs</p>
<p>can probably tolerate that.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re like my, you know, my bulldog,</p>
<p>which unfortunately passed away, but Costello,</p>
<p>I always imagine that if ever we did an autopsy on him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d have like a license plate</p>
<p>and like a human being in his gut</p>
<p>because it seemed like he could ingest anything</p>
<p>with no issues.</p>
<p>But of course, many people have kind of sensitive guts.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to try taking glutamine</p>
<p>as a means to reduce sugar cravings,</p>
<p>just know that the studies are still ongoing.</p>
<p>Some people have achieved benefit.</p>
<p>Please also realize that there&rsquo;s an entire literature</p>
<p>devoted to the potential hazards of increasing glutamine</p>
<p>if you have a preexisting cancer.</p>
<p>So if you have cancer, you&rsquo;re cancer prone,</p>
<p>I would really discourage you from this approach.</p>
<p>And in any case, as always, talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>The logic nonetheless is there,</p>
<p>why increasing amino acid intake or fatty acid intake</p>
<p>might decrease sugar craving.</p>
<p>Now, there are other ways to reduce sugar craving,</p>
<p>and there are certainly ways to reduce the sharp rise</p>
<p>in blood glucose that can occur</p>
<p>when we ingest sugary sweet foods,</p>
<p>or even just an abundance of carbohydrate foods.</p>
<p>And there are a huge number of these things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to sort of layer up through the ones</p>
<p>that you might find in your cupboard or the grocery store,</p>
<p>and then get into some of the more extravagant,</p>
<p>or I should say, esoteric ones.</p>
<p>Many of which, however, can be quite potent.</p>
<p>The first of which is simple lemon juice, right?</p>
<p>Or lime juice.</p>
<p>There was an old lore and actually some papers</p>
<p>pointing to the idea that the ingestion of vinegar,</p>
<p>either white vinegar or wine vinegar,</p>
<p>could somehow blunt blood glucose</p>
<p>after the ingestion of sugary foods,</p>
<p>or the ingestion of a lot of carbohydrate foods,</p>
<p>or even just a big meal.</p>
<p>Actually, Tim Ferriss, I should say the great Tim Ferriss,</p>
<p>because I do have great respect for the fact</p>
<p>that he seems to be about 10 years ahead of everything,</p>
<p>both in terms of nutrition and skill learning</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Many of the things that he predicted in his books,</p>
<p>the four-hour body and the four-hour chef,</p>
<p>actually turned out to be true based on scientific data,</p>
<p>some of which only exists in the animal models,</p>
<p>but now also some predictions that played out to be true</p>
<p>in both the animal models and the human model.</p>
<p>So I think that Tim certainly deserves a hat tip</p>
<p>for the fact that he experimented with these methods</p>
<p>and reported his experiences with those methods,</p>
<p>and that now some of them, many of them,</p>
<p>have been validated by what I perceive</p>
<p>to be quality science.</p>
<p>He talked about the fact that,</p>
<p>at least in his experiments on himself,</p>
<p>the ingestion of vinegar did not seem to blunt blood glucose</p>
<p>and he was using continuous glucose monitors.</p>
<p>These, incidentally, another example</p>
<p>of where Ferriss was early to the game</p>
<p>and the rest of us are kind of just in his wake.</p>
<p>He talked about the use of blood glucose monitors.</p>
<p>Those, I think at the time, were implanted below the skin.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are less invasive blood glucose monitors,</p>
<p>things like levels and so forth,</p>
<p>and these are actually becoming pretty popular.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worn one of these before.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually pretty informative.</p>
<p>I learned, for instance, that when I go in the sauna,</p>
<p>that I experience a sharp rise in blood glucose,</p>
<p>and that makes sense because of the dehydration</p>
<p>associated with being in the sauna, a lot of sweating,</p>
<p>concentration of sugar in the bloodstream goes up.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some other things,</p>
<p>certain foods affect my blood glucose one way or another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of an interesting and fun experiment</p>
<p>that some of you might be interested in doing as well.</p>
<p>Regardless, there are now data pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that lemon juice and lime juice,</p>
<p>a couple of tablespoons or so,</p>
<p>if ingested before or even during</p>
<p>or even after consumption of sugary foods,</p>
<p>or I should say foods that sharply increase blood glucose,</p>
<p>or large carbohydrate meals</p>
<p>can actually blunt the blood glucose response.</p>
<p>And I did see that when I did my own experiments on myself</p>
<p>with continuous glucose monitor.</p>
<p>It was kind of fun to do those experiments.</p>
<p>I preferred to do those experiments</p>
<p>by eating somewhat larger meals</p>
<p>of things that didn&rsquo;t contain a lot of sugar.</p>
<p>I saw some big increases in blood glucose</p>
<p>in certain instances,</p>
<p>and then I would ingest some lemon juice or lime juice,</p>
<p>typically mixed in with water.</p>
<p>And sure enough, you could see a blunting</p>
<p>of the blood glucose response.</p>
<p>And of course, this was real time blood continuous,</p>
<p>hence continuous blood glucose monitoring.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in blunting your blood sugar response, certain foods,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a simple low cost way to do that</p>
<p>if you want to explore it.</p>
<p>I will say, if you are fasting</p>
<p>and you already have low blood glucose</p>
<p>and you ingest lemon juice,</p>
<p>or I should say some lemon juice and water,</p>
<p>or lime juice and water,</p>
<p>be careful because you can actually become hypoglycemic,</p>
<p>right, for the very same reasons</p>
<p>that lemon juice and lime juice can blunt blood glucose</p>
<p>when your blood glucose levels are moderate to high.</p>
<p>You can also reduce blood glucose levels even further</p>
<p>when blood glucose levels are low.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s lemon juice and lime juice there,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t say that has to do</p>
<p>with acidic things generally.</p>
<p>And just as a side point,</p>
<p>many of you have probably seen in the store,</p>
<p>so-called adjusted pH waters,</p>
<p>or foods and drinks that are supposed to adjust your pH.</p>
<p>Hate to break it to you,</p>
<p>but your pH is very tightly regulated</p>
<p>throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>You do not want this to change.</p>
<p>It is entirely impossible, at least in any safe way,</p>
<p>that you would become quote unquote more alkaline</p>
<p>by ingesting an alkaline water or something like that.</p>
<p>It is true that your pH, your alkalinity and acidity</p>
<p>varies in different compartments in your body,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Unless you are hemorrhaging or vomiting</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s something badly wrong with you health-wise</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a really dire circumstance,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want big shifts in your body pH</p>
<p>and your body has all sorts of ways</p>
<p>of buffering against changes in pH.</p>
<p>So I encourage you not to fall on the,</p>
<p>or hop on the bandwagon of adjusting pH</p>
<p>and becoming less acidic and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>When you ingest lemon juice or lime juice,</p>
<p>the mechanism by which it blunts blood glucose</p>
<p>is probably twofold.</p>
<p>One is probably through the post-ingestive effects</p>
<p>of glucose in the gut,</p>
<p>meaning the way in which sugars are interacting</p>
<p>with neurons and other components of your gut circuitry</p>
<p>to impact things like gastric emptying time,</p>
<p>to impact things like the firing of those neuropod cells</p>
<p>and their signaling to the brain.</p>
<p>But almost certainly it has something to do also</p>
<p>with the perception of sour taste on the tongue.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t go into this too much today,</p>
<p>but you of course don&rsquo;t just have</p>
<p>sweet taste receptors in your mouth,</p>
<p>you also have bitter taste receptors,</p>
<p>you have salty taste receptors,</p>
<p>you have sour taste receptors in your mouth</p>
<p>and of course that means your tongue and palate.</p>
<p>And those are interacting.</p>
<p>If you ingest a substance that&rsquo;s just sweet</p>
<p>or mostly sweet,</p>
<p>that causes a certain set of effects on your blood glucose,</p>
<p>but also your brain, dopamine</p>
<p>and the other neural circuits of your brain.</p>
<p>If you also ingest something that&rsquo;s sour,</p>
<p>like lemon juice or lime juice,</p>
<p>it adjusts the output of those neural circuits in your brain.</p>
<p>So again, where you have a situation</p>
<p>where you have two parallel pathways,</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s post-ingestive coming from phenomenon</p>
<p>within our gut neurons,</p>
<p>but also things like gastric emptying time,</p>
<p>the clearance and the transfer of food</p>
<p>and the conversion of food into particular nutrients</p>
<p>and the circulation of glucose in your bloodstream</p>
<p>and how it gets into the brain.</p>
<p>But also simply by ingesting something sour,</p>
<p>you are changing the way that sweet things</p>
<p>impact your brain.</p>
<p>And so I think it stands to reason</p>
<p>that the lemon juice, lime juice effect</p>
<p>is not going to be magic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to have everything to do with the way</p>
<p>that ingesting sour foods can adjust the taste,</p>
<p>excuse me, can adjust the neural response</p>
<p>to taste of sweet foods.</p>
<p>And in fact, we know based on the beautiful work</p>
<p>of Charles Zucker at Columbia Medical School,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s exactly what happens.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve measured the activity of neurons</p>
<p>at various locations in the so-called taste pathways</p>
<p>of the brain.</p>
<p>And they found that when particular tastes</p>
<p>like just sweet or just bitter or just sour</p>
<p>evoke certain ensembles of neurons</p>
<p>to fire in particular sequences,</p>
<p>when sweet and sour co-ingested,</p>
<p>when bitter and sour are co-ingested,</p>
<p>you get distinct ensembles,</p>
<p>meaning distinct patterns of activity of those neurons.</p>
<p>And of course, distinct patterns of downstream activity</p>
<p>within the brain and body.</p>
<p>So while it is still somewhat mysterious</p>
<p>as to how exactly things like lemon juice and lime juice</p>
<p>can reduce our blood glucose spikes</p>
<p>when we ingest those with sweet foods</p>
<p>or carbohydrate laden foods or with big meals,</p>
<p>you can use this as a tool with the understanding</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a grounding in the biology</p>
<p>of the way these circuits work.</p>
<p>Now, some of you have probably heard that cinnamon</p>
<p>can be a useful tool for controlling blood sugar.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that cinnamon can adjust the rate</p>
<p>of glucose entry into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>possibly by changing the rate of gastric emptying.</p>
<p>It might slow the rate of gastric emptying</p>
<p>and thereby also reduce the glycemic index</p>
<p>of particular foods.</p>
<p>So I suppose if I were going to eat a mango</p>
<p>and I hadn&rsquo;t just done a bunch of hard training,</p>
<p>I might sprinkle some cinnamon on it here.</p>
<p>I always enjoy kind of coming up with new ideas</p>
<p>of ways that I can eat foods during these podcasts.</p>
<p>In any event, there&rsquo;s some debate out there.</p>
<p>If you look online as to whether or not Saigon cinnamon,</p>
<p>Kassia cinnamon, excuse me, or Ceylon cinnamon is best</p>
<p>for purposes of blunting blood glucose spikes.</p>
<p>But I think the, at least by my read of the data</p>
<p>and from what I found, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s real cinnamon.</p>
<p>And you have to actually look and make sure</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s real cinnamon because a lot of cinnamon</p>
<p>that you buy is not real.</p>
<p>I do want to provide a cautionary note about cinnamon.</p>
<p>However, cinnamon contains something called coumadin,</p>
<p>which can be toxic at high levels.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to ingest more than about a teaspoon,</p>
<p>maybe a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon per day</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll start to exceed the threshold</p>
<p>at which cinnamon could start to be problematic.</p>
<p>But certainly if you&rsquo;re going to have a big meal</p>
<p>or a meal that has a lot of sugar in it</p>
<p>or a lot of carbohydrate laden foods</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want an increase in blood glucose,</p>
<p>you could put cinnamon in a beverage,</p>
<p>you could put cinnamon on food</p>
<p>in order to blunt that blood glucose increase,</p>
<p>reduce the glycemic index by way</p>
<p>of reducing gastric emptying time.</p>
<p>Again, just making sure that you don&rsquo;t get out</p>
<p>past that one and a half teaspoons per day</p>
<p>because you really don&rsquo;t want to start dealing</p>
<p>with any of the toxicity related to coumadin.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about lemon juice and lime juice</p>
<p>and cinnamon, these are kind of commonplace</p>
<p>in many kitchens.</p>
<p>Then of course we can venture into the more esoteric</p>
<p>or I would say the more advanced tools</p>
<p>for adjusting sugar intake.</p>
<p>And the one that comes to mind is of course berberine.</p>
<p>Berberine is a derivative of tree bark</p>
<p>and is a very, very potent substance</p>
<p>for reducing blood glucose.</p>
<p>So much so that it is on par with metformin</p>
<p>or glibenclamide, which are prescription drugs</p>
<p>specifically used to reduce blood glucose.</p>
<p>So using berberine is a serious step,</p>
<p>you should absolutely talk to your doctor about it.</p>
<p>I know of a number of people that use it</p>
<p>to lower blood glucose when they eat really large meals.</p>
<p>I know of a number of people that are using it</p>
<p>to get to some of the other effects of metformin</p>
<p>that people have discussed, things like activating</p>
<p>or tapping into the so-called AMPK pathway,</p>
<p>reducing mTOR.</p>
<p>These are people that are aiming their activities</p>
<p>at increasing longevity,</p>
<p>a somewhat controversial approach still,</p>
<p>but I know many people are doing it.</p>
<p>It is true that if you ingest berberine,</p>
<p>your blood glucose will plummet.</p>
<p>And I point that out because I&rsquo;ve actually tried it before,</p>
<p>it gave me brutal headaches and I felt really dizzy</p>
<p>and I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t see straight.</p>
<p>And actually I couldn&rsquo;t see straight.</p>
<p>Why did it do that?</p>
<p>Well, it made me hypoglycemic.</p>
<p>It actually drove my blood glucose down too far.</p>
<p>And the reason it did that is that I took berberine</p>
<p>on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>I know some people can tolerate it.</p>
<p>I would say be very cautious about ingesting berberine</p>
<p>on an empty stomach,</p>
<p>or if you are in a low carbohydrate diet,</p>
<p>unless you really know what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and you have a medical professional</p>
<p>to kind of guide you through that.</p>
<p>If I took berberine along with a very large meal</p>
<p>that include a lot of carbohydrates,</p>
<p>I can recall the days in which Costello and I</p>
<p>would eat a couple of pizzas</p>
<p>and then we might get ice cream, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Then I felt perfectly fine on even up to 750 milligrams</p>
<p>or a gram of berberine.</p>
<p>It has the kind of unique property</p>
<p>of making you feel not overwhelmed</p>
<p>by the amount of blood glucose increase</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re experiencing from eating a big meal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite know how else to describe it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if you can keep eating</p>
<p>and eating and eating.</p>
<p>And of course you have to protect your gastric volume,</p>
<p>you only have so much space in your stomach to ingest food.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t using it to gorge on food.</p>
<p>I just heard about it.</p>
<p>I was interested in experimenting with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any chronic blood sugar issues.</p>
<p>But again, when I took it on an empty stomach,</p>
<p>it made me hypoglycemic on a low carbohydrate intake,</p>
<p>hypoglycemic, not a good experience.</p>
<p>And again, an experience I think to avoid,</p>
<p>but provided there&rsquo;s a lot of glucose in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>And certainly if you are of the experimental type</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to regulate blood glucose,</p>
<p>berberine might be a good option.</p>
<p>But again, talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>It does have some other interesting effects</p>
<p>in terms of lowering total cholesterol</p>
<p>that are research supported</p>
<p>of reducing insulin a little bit.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not surprising.</p>
<p>If you reduce blood glucose,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to reduce insulin</p>
<p>because of course insulin manages blood glucose</p>
<p>in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>So I would place berberine,</p>
<p>and of course metformin and glibenclamide</p>
<p>in the kind of the heavy hitting potent tools</p>
<p>for regulating blood glucose.</p>
<p>Now this is an episode not about sugar per se,</p>
<p>but sugar viewed through the lens of the nervous system.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting about berberine, metformin,</p>
<p>glibenclamide and related substances</p>
<p>is that some of the effects are of course</p>
<p>on gastric emptying or buffering blood glucose</p>
<p>within the bloodstream, et cetera.</p>
<p>But there appear to also be some neural effects</p>
<p>of having chronically low glucose</p>
<p>or blunting blood glucose through things like berberine.</p>
<p>And some of those neural effects</p>
<p>include longstanding changes in the hormonal cascades</p>
<p>that are the consequence of having low blood sugar</p>
<p>and thereby changes in the neural circuits</p>
<p>that manage blood glucose overall.</p>
<p>The simple way of saying this</p>
<p>is that by maintaining low to moderate blood glucose,</p>
<p>either by not ingesting heavily carbohydrate laden foods,</p>
<p>so here I&rsquo;m speaking to the low carb</p>
<p>and to the ketogenic types,</p>
<p>or by blunting blood glucose</p>
<p>through things like metformin or berberine,</p>
<p>even if ingesting carbohydrates, maybe even some sugars,</p>
<p>over time it seems that there&rsquo;s a adjustment,</p>
<p>what we call a homeostatic regulation of the neural circuits</p>
<p>that control things like sugar craving.</p>
<p>And indeed some people report</p>
<p>feeling fewer sugar cravings over time.</p>
<p>Now I didn&rsquo;t use berberine for a very long period of time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never used metformin.</p>
<p>I have experienced a somewhat odd,</p>
<p>but welcome phenomenon of,</p>
<p>with each progressive year of my life,</p>
<p>I have fewer and fewer sugar cravings.</p>
<p>Why that is, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I suspect it might have something to do with my sleep,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk about that in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to explore berberine</p>
<p>or metformin or otherwise,</p>
<p>in addition to working with a doctor,</p>
<p>I think you should understand why you&rsquo;re doing it, right?</p>
<p>I think that many of the effects can be quite potent.</p>
<p>They can happen in both the immediate term</p>
<p>in terms of regulating blood glucose,</p>
<p>they can send you hypoglycemic</p>
<p>if you aren&rsquo;t careful.</p>
<p>They can also cause longstanding changes</p>
<p>to the neural circuitry</p>
<p>that regulates blood sugar over time.</p>
<p>Some of which might be welcome changes, right?</p>
<p>Reduce sugar cravings, for instance.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re really, really serious</p>
<p>about modulating blood glucose</p>
<p>through things like berberine,</p>
<p>the typical dose range again</p>
<p>is anywhere from half a gram to 1.5 grams daily.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the typical dosages that have been explored.</p>
<p>And there are some other substances</p>
<p>like sodium cuprate,</p>
<p>which are known to augment the effects of berberine</p>
<p>via the AMPK pathways.</p>
<p>They basically can increase the ability for berberine</p>
<p>to have its glucose lowering actions.</p>
<p>But that of course is getting into the really potent,</p>
<p>what I would call sharp blade tools</p>
<p>for controlling blood glucose.</p>
<p>And listen, anytime you&rsquo;re dealing with blood glucose,</p>
<p>you are dealing with the brain&rsquo;s preferred source of fuel.</p>
<p>And anytime you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with the brain&rsquo;s preferred source of fuel,</p>
<p>you have to be especially cautious</p>
<p>about depriving the brain of what it needs.</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re low-carb, high-carb,</p>
<p>keto, vegan, carnivore,</p>
<p>these substances like berberine are very, very potent</p>
<p>and you need to take them seriously.</p>
<p>There is yet another tool for controlling sugar cravings</p>
<p>and the neural circuits that regulate sugar craving</p>
<p>and its downstream consequences.</p>
<p>And this tool is what I would call a high-performance tool,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one that you probably didn&rsquo;t suspect</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done extensive episodes about sleep</p>
<p>and we actually have an episode called Master Your Sleep.</p>
<p>You can find that episode easily at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available in all the various formats,</p>
<p>YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera,</p>
<p>and provides a lot of tools.</p>
<p>And on social media, I provide a lot of tools.</p>
<p>Often we have a newsletter that provides tools</p>
<p>on how to maximize sleep.</p>
<p>What is the role of sleep in sugar metabolism,</p>
<p>sugar hunger, and the way that the brain</p>
<p>regulates those things?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a really exciting study that came out</p>
<p>just last year.</p>
<p>This study was published in the journal Cell Report,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.</p>
<p>And the reason I love this study so much</p>
<p>is it involved having people,</p>
<p>so yes, this was done in humans, sleep in the laboratory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not unusual.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sleep lab at Stanford,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sleep labs elsewhere.</p>
<p>But what they did was they actually measured</p>
<p>from the breath of these people</p>
<p>and they extracted from their breath,</p>
<p>the metabolites that would allow them to understand</p>
<p>what sorts of metabolism was occurring</p>
<p>in these people&rsquo;s bodies at different phases of sleep.</p>
<p>And this is a really remarkable study.</p>
<p>They actually did this every 10 seconds</p>
<p>throughout the entire night.</p>
<p>So in little tiny 10 second bins,</p>
<p>meaning at very high resolution,</p>
<p>they could evaluate what is the metabolism</p>
<p>in the brain and body that people experience</p>
<p>as they go from REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>to slow wave sleep and so on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll go deeper into the study again in the future</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so interesting and I think so important.</p>
<p>But what they discovered was that each stage of sleep</p>
<p>was associated with a very particular</p>
<p>signature pattern of metabolism.</p>
<p>And particular phases of sleep</p>
<p>are associated with sugar metabolism</p>
<p>or more with fat metabolism</p>
<p>or more with other aspects of metabolism.</p>
<p>And the reason why I think this study is important</p>
<p>to discuss in the context of today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>about sugar in the brain</p>
<p>is that many people have experienced</p>
<p>the effects of disrupted sleep on their appetite.</p>
<p>And in particular, it&rsquo;s been reported</p>
<p>that when people are sleep deprived</p>
<p>or the quality of their sleep is disrupted,</p>
<p>that their appetite for sugary foods increases.</p>
<p>Now that was always assumed to be due to some</p>
<p>metabolic need that was triggered by the sleep deprivation</p>
<p>or by the poor sleep.</p>
<p>But in reading over this study,</p>
<p>some of the more important points made by the authors</p>
<p>relate to the fact that, well,</p>
<p>sleep is known to have incredibly important effects</p>
<p>on brain and body for a variety of systems,</p>
<p>immune system, neural functioning, et cetera.</p>
<p>This very organized sequence</p>
<p>of particular forms of metabolism</p>
<p>being active during particular phases of sleep,</p>
<p>which are very, very well orchestrated as we know,</p>
<p>slow wave sleep and REM sleep being orchestrated</p>
<p>in 90 minutes, so-called ultradian cycles</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Is thought to perhaps set up the brain and body</p>
<p>to be able to regulate itself in the waking hours.</p>
<p>And therefore, when people are sleep deprived</p>
<p>or deprived of certain forms or states within sleep,</p>
<p>such as rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>that it creates a disruption</p>
<p>in a particular set of metabolic pathways.</p>
<p>Now we don&rsquo;t want to leap too far from this study</p>
<p>to sugar metabolism and the neural circuits</p>
<p>controlling sugar metabolism.</p>
<p>But I will say this,</p>
<p>if you look at the sum total of the data on obesity</p>
<p>or on type two diabetes or on metabolic syndromes</p>
<p>of any kind, you almost always see disruptions in sleep.</p>
<p>Now, some of those could be due to sleep apnea</p>
<p>caused by even just the size of somebody&rsquo;s neck</p>
<p>or the weight of their body.</p>
<p>In other words, we don&rsquo;t know the direction of the effect.</p>
<p>Metabolic syndromes could disrupt sleep,</p>
<p>which disrupt metabolic syndromes.</p>
<p>And indeed the authors point out quite appropriately</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t understand the direction</p>
<p>of the effects that they observe either.</p>
<p>But there is now a plethora of data</p>
<p>pointing to the fact that getting quality sleep each night</p>
<p>helps regulate not only appetite,</p>
<p>but also the specific forms of metabolism</p>
<p>that drive specific appetites.</p>
<p>So the takeaway is,</p>
<p>while there are extravagant and potent</p>
<p>and interesting ways to regulate glucose,</p>
<p>everything from cinnamon to lemon juice,</p>
<p>to berberine, to sodium caprate, to behavioral tools,</p>
<p>to the mere understanding of how the direct</p>
<p>and indirect pathways go from the gut to dopamine, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not establishing the firm foundation</p>
<p>of proper metabolism,</p>
<p>all of those things are going to be</p>
<p>sort of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic</p>
<p>as sometimes described.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t overstate the importance of getting regular,</p>
<p>sufficient amount of high quality sleep</p>
<p>at least 80% of the time,</p>
<p>not just for sake of immune system function,</p>
<p>for clear thinking, et cetera,</p>
<p>but also for properly regulating our metabolism,</p>
<p>including our sugar metabolism.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me for this discussion</p>
<p>about sugar and the nervous system</p>
<p>and how they are regulating each other</p>
<p>in both the brain and body.</p>
