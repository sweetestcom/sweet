    <p>Hi friends, so this week I want to share something I&rsquo;ve been dealing with and</p>
<p>then teach you how I got out of it which is being tired of being strong like when</p>
<p>you always have to be the one to be strong and you&rsquo;re like you&rsquo;re aware that</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s in your control but you get pissed the fuck off at it I got you</p>
<p>cuz I was going through it real hard the last couple weeks but before we jump</p>
<p>into that I want to say I want to add a new segment to my podcast and I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>call it what would Leo do WWLD so basically I want you guys to comment on</p>
<p>this video and give me your situation you&rsquo;re dealing with and you&rsquo;re wondering</p>
<p>what I would do like how I would handle it if you need advice on something leave</p>
<p>it in the comments because I&rsquo;m either gonna start doing a full episode like</p>
<p>one a month or like add it at the end of my podcast like answer a couple</p>
<p>situations and give you what I would do I haven&rsquo;t decided on that yet but leave</p>
<p>comments on this video of what you need help with and like your little situation</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on and you want my take on it and I know some things are a little</p>
<p>personal and you don&rsquo;t want everybody to see it so if you want to have</p>
<p>something like private sent in send it into my DMS on Instagram my Instagram is</p>
<p>the Leo Skeppy I&rsquo;ll also leave it in the description but you can DM me your</p>
<p>situation and it&rsquo;s all gonna be anonymous I&rsquo;m not gonna reveal anybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>names and if you have a situation with somebody I&rsquo;m gonna make them a code name</p>
<p>okay a lot of you guys have wanted me to start doing something like this so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a whole segment now what would Leo do okay so now let&rsquo;s jump into</p>
<p>what to do when you&rsquo;re tired of being strong and I&rsquo;m gonna have to open up and</p>
<p>be a little vulnerable in this episode and I&rsquo;m fine doing that but watch your</p>
<p>fucking mouth don&rsquo;t be mean don&rsquo;t be rude don&rsquo;t attack me because I will</p>
<p>attack you back but straight up the last couple of weeks I have been burnt the</p>
<p>fuck out tired exhausted resentful because I understand everything&rsquo;s in my</p>
<p>control like all the things that I want I&rsquo;m in control of bringing them about</p>
<p>the universe is there to assist and help and all that and like I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>get too spiritual with it because we&rsquo;re living in real life I hate when people</p>
<p>talk too much in the fucking spiritual shit it&rsquo;s like we get it girl but that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t help me with what I&rsquo;m doing in the physical world so I was just so</p>
<p>frustrated because like everything that I&rsquo;m working toward everything I want</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;m trying to create I just got so frustrated because I was like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all in my control and I get it and a lot of people get happy once you</p>
<p>finally realize your life is in your control like once you take</p>
<p>responsibility for your full life and all your goals everything you want your</p>
<p>success your everything is determined on you it&rsquo;s a relief for a minute until</p>
<p>you hit the wall that I&rsquo;ve hit where you understand everything&rsquo;s in your control</p>
<p>but it pisses you the fuck off because that&rsquo;s so much pressure like I get that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in control but goddamn girl I&rsquo;m fucking tired and when I say that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>tired I&rsquo;ve been pushing to an extreme my whole life basically but the last like</p>
<p>two years I&rsquo;ve really just been pushing it and like driving into what I want and</p>
<p>taking a chance on myself and like being on social media and quitting nursing and</p>
<p>going for my goals and my passion because I&rsquo;ve finally found it and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been going for it and I&rsquo;m just fucking tired like I&rsquo;m not talking about my body</p>
<p>is tired like sure but that&rsquo;s the least of my worries me being physically tired</p>
<p>is not the problem my fucking heart is tired like I just feel like my soul is</p>
<p>exhausted my hope is tired like I&rsquo;m sick of having fucking hope I&rsquo;m sick of trying</p>
<p>to like hope things get better and hope things work out I hit a place where I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if I want to keep going with a lot of different things I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>suicidal again okay that that chapter is closed but I&rsquo;ve hit a point where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just so fucking frustrated and with trying to follow your purpose everybody</p>
<p>always fucking posts and talks about even not even your purpose your desires</p>
<p>anytime you follow a desire you have or something that you want things are gonna</p>
<p>be easy they&rsquo;re gonna line up it&rsquo;s like everything&rsquo;s just gonna start falling</p>
<p>into place and working out for you and that&rsquo;s the opposite of what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>experienced like I&rsquo;m pissed because I&rsquo;ve been going for what I want I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>going for my desires I&rsquo;ve been trying to help people I&rsquo;ve genuinely just been</p>
<p>pouring everything I can out of me to be of use and like provide value to</p>
<p>other people and it&rsquo;s stressful as fuck and it&rsquo;s not been lining up like I deal</p>
<p>with so many little ironic inconveniences and every time something</p>
<p>happens I&rsquo;m like fuck like I know what to do I know how to handle it but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like shit on shit on shit on shit and I&rsquo;m like when the fuck is enough enough</p>
<p>you know and like I&rsquo;m the most aware person I know and I&rsquo;m not saying that to</p>
<p>sound like I got fucking like big britches but I see the possibilities and</p>
<p>the explanations other people don&rsquo;t see so usually when I&rsquo;m facing something I</p>
<p>know what to do I know how to handle it and even if I don&rsquo;t in the moment I know</p>
<p>how to go into it I know how to go into myself and find the new solutions but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing that and I&rsquo;m at a point where I see all the solutions in front</p>
<p>of me but I&rsquo;m just like I don&rsquo;t want to do them I know frustration and headache</p>
<p>is gonna come and it&rsquo;s like it just doesn&rsquo;t stop and it makes you get to a</p>
<p>point where like you&rsquo;ve fought so long and you&rsquo;re just at a point where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just like why like to keep going for what like I know what I need to do but I</p>
<p>can see that it&rsquo;s just gonna be fucking more shit on more shit you just want to</p>
<p>throw your hands up and that&rsquo;s where I got to last week like I had a very very</p>
<p>dark weekend I fucking hate the weekends cuz I always like have free time and I</p>
<p>be like stressing the fuck out and it&rsquo;s like everything be hitting me on the</p>
<p>weekends I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m supposed to be relaxing and here I am like having all</p>
<p>this shit come up I have to work through and like I just get very down and this</p>
<p>last weekend was a very very low weekend for me and I&rsquo;m gonna share with you how</p>
<p>I got out of this fucking cycle and how I got my inspiration back because I was</p>
<p>at a point where like like I said I knew what I needed to do I just didn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>to do it anymore like sure my heart is good I have good intentions I have pure</p>
<p>intentions I want to help people I want to do all this shit right but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t matter when you keep getting beat the fuck down and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how I was looking at everything that was happening to me I just look like I was</p>
<p>being prevented I felt like I was so unsupported by the fucking universe I</p>
<p>was like this is not how it&rsquo;s supposed to go like you&rsquo;re supposed to help me</p>
<p>get to where I want to get to not make shit fucking difficult like why the fuck</p>
<p>are there so many inconveniences I&rsquo;m supposed to be assisted I&rsquo;m supposed to</p>
<p>be guided I felt so unsupported I felt prevented I felt like something was</p>
<p>pushing against me in every aspect and every direction I turned so that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>I got to the standstill of like okay every move I make is gonna be prevented</p>
<p>every move I make there&rsquo;s gonna be fucking headache and there&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>frustration and I had to sit in that spot for a minute like I genuinely just</p>
<p>had to fucking sit there and be like what now what the fuck is life literally</p>
<p>what the fuck is this shit this is some sick-ass game and I did not sign up to</p>
<p>play it okay my soul might have but I fucking did it me but physical body me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pissed I&rsquo;m frustrated I&rsquo;m over it and with all this frustration finally</p>
<p>getting to like the boiling point I also started to get really down and sad</p>
<p>because I was like I&rsquo;ve had to be strong for so long like mentally emotionally</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to be so strong and I&rsquo;m fucking tired like when I said I&rsquo;m tired and my</p>
<p>heart is tired like I&rsquo;m just emotionally tired mentally tired my physical body I</p>
<p>can push it as far as I want to I&rsquo;ll push it until it breaks but I&rsquo;m so much</p>
<p>more tired than just physical and I feel like I can&rsquo;t have an off day I feel like</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t break like I&rsquo;m not allowed to break or have time off I&rsquo;m not allowed</p>
<p>to be down because something&rsquo;s gonna suffer like I have so much pressure and</p>
<p>so much shit and like everything I&rsquo;m working on at once it&rsquo;s like I know I</p>
<p>get it but I feel like I can&rsquo;t have a minute like I feel like I can&rsquo;t have an</p>
<p>off day I feel like everything will suffer if I do if I break down or if I</p>
<p>even break a little everything&rsquo;s fucked like I have no space to fall down and I</p>
<p>have no space to not be strong is basically it so now I&rsquo;m at a point where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like resentful of like I have to be strong I&rsquo;m able to be strong I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>strongest person I&rsquo;ve ever fucking met besides my mom that&rsquo;s a tough bitch but</p>
<p>my strength is not what&rsquo;s in question like I&rsquo;m able to be strong and I started</p>
<p>to get so resentful of like I&rsquo;ve had to be strong and I am very strong and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucking pissed that I keep having to be strong dude like the frustration I was</p>
<p>feeling this last weekend it was like it&rsquo;s things I&rsquo;ve been dealing with my</p>
<p>whole life and it&rsquo;s like it just fucking hit a wall and I hit that fucking wall</p>
<p>too and something a lot of people don&rsquo;t talk about with having a personality</p>
<p>online or being someone online and then also being a coach like I&rsquo;m a one-on-one</p>
<p>coach and I get people through their problems there&rsquo;s so much pressure that</p>
<p>comes with that because like I said I feel like I can&rsquo;t break I have so many</p>
<p>people that rely on me depend on me that I&rsquo;m scared to let everybody down</p>
<p>one I&rsquo;m scared to let myself down and I&rsquo;m scared for everything I&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>for to be for nothing like I&rsquo;m scared to lose it I&rsquo;m scared to like for all of it</p>
<p>to break it&rsquo;s like if I break everything breaks and that&rsquo;s gonna hurt ten times</p>
<p>worse so I&rsquo;m like I was faced with a decision of like keep pushing through</p>
<p>and just being strong or face everything you have being gone and losing it all</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a hard position to be in it really is so weird because some days I</p>
<p>wake up and I&rsquo;m like yes let&rsquo;s rock this shit let&rsquo;s fucking rock and roll we got</p>
<p>this and I&rsquo;m like confident and I&rsquo;m ready to go and I&rsquo;m able to be strong I</p>
<p>feel able and willing to be strong and face what comes up and then other days I</p>
<p>feel very weak I feel very like I don&rsquo;t want to fucking do this shit I&rsquo;m pissed</p>
<p>I have to keep it all together and I&rsquo;m just like if one thing goes wrong I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna shatter is how I feel some days and then other it&rsquo;s like the weirdest</p>
<p>pendulum swing it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m extremely strong nothing can penetrate me nothing</p>
<p>can hurt me nothing can fuck with me nothing can stop me and then I swing to</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m so fragile if one thing goes wrong like the other day I was in the</p>
<p>kitchen and I was eating and I was like cooking and I just kept dropping little</p>
<p>shit and I was like oh my god like so many little frustrations and</p>
<p>inconveniences I was like bro fuck like just quit and my breaking point was like</p>
<p>I was I had a handful of almonds and like I went to grab one to eat it and it</p>
<p>fell in the floor like it just fell and I was just like that&rsquo;s where I mean I</p>
<p>feel so fragile on the off days where it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ll have like four or five</p>
<p>days where I&rsquo;m extremely strong and then I&rsquo;ll have a couple of days where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m the most fragile and like sensitive person and I can be stopped by</p>
<p>like the simplest thing going wrong but it&rsquo;s not even be stopped it&rsquo;s like I can</p>
<p>just be like down like it will just wreck me okay so by now you understand</p>
<p>the way that I&rsquo;m feeling a lot of you feel the same fucking way and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I want to be so vulnerable about the way that I&rsquo;m feeling is because I want</p>
<p>everyone that watches this to understand you are not alone you are not the only</p>
<p>one that feels the way that you feel a lot of the times everybody feels special</p>
<p>everybody feels different everybody convinces themselves look at me using</p>
<p>the proper term themselves instead of their self that their problems and their</p>
<p>feelings are special they&rsquo;re different but we all are different we all are</p>
<p>special in our own way but the way that we all feel is the same throughout every</p>
<p>human being we all feel the exact same things we might have different</p>
<p>circumstances but I promise you your pain is not different than mine we all</p>
<p>feel the same shit you are never alone and anything that you fucking feel I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting goosebumps talking about this shit cuz it&rsquo;s like I truly mean it and I</p>
<p>get it and I&rsquo;ve experienced it and I&rsquo;ve seen it like we all feel the same things</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t convince yourself you&rsquo;re special and you&rsquo;re different you are but</p>
<p>not the way that you feel the way that you feel you can relate to any other</p>
<p>being that breeds like we all share it okay so now I&rsquo;m gonna tell you how I got</p>
<p>out of this place I was stuck in so I looked at all the inconveniences that</p>
<p>were happening and I was like what the fuck this is what I mean when I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>okay I see solutions and possibilities on their own but then when I need to go</p>
<p>into something I see all the other shit that I wasn&rsquo;t seeing before like it just</p>
<p>takes a little bit of digging for me now and I just see everything I need to see</p>
<p>so I have all these inconveniences happening all this shit I feel like is</p>
<p>working against me and pushing against me and holding me back so I looked at it</p>
<p>all and I was like okay I have the belief that nothing in your life is</p>
<p>against you so I asked myself how am I a match to so many fucking inconveniences</p>
<p>like what are these inconveniences allowing what are they helping me with</p>
<p>what the fuck do I get out of being a match to all of the inconveniences and</p>
<p>all the headache and all the shit that I&rsquo;m going through and I&rsquo;m talking like</p>
<p>just little things going wrong like nothing lining up everything being way</p>
<p>more difficult than it seems like it fucking needs to be that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about inconveniences and my shit is ironic like the amount of things that</p>
<p>have to line up for the things that happen to me to happen it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>inconveniences I go through it&rsquo;s like someone is literally orchestrating it</p>
<p>cuz I&rsquo;m like no way this shit just happens like I can clearly see</p>
<p>everything is lined up so I&rsquo;m like okay if I feel like something is lining it up</p>
<p>that means it&rsquo;s happening for a reason a hundred percent so what the fuck is the</p>
<p>reason so asking myself why am I a match to so much frustration how are all these</p>
<p>inconveniences serving me had to go into myself and be honest for a second when I</p>
<p>suffer for things and I fight for things and I feel like I have to overcome a lot</p>
<p>I feel like I finally deserve what I just got so without all of the</p>
<p>frustration and all the headache I don&rsquo;t like to feel like things are just given</p>
<p>to me subconsciously I like to suffer for shit because it allows me to feel</p>
<p>like I deserve it so it&rsquo;s like if I say oh my god I want this vape and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>handed to me I feel uncomfortable taking it weird I know right but it&rsquo;s my little</p>
<p>fucking thing it&rsquo;s a behavior and a subconscious belief that I&rsquo;ve just like</p>
<p>adopted and I&rsquo;ll go into that shit later but if I see something that I want</p>
<p>and I feel like I have to jump a couple of hurdles to get it now I&rsquo;m confident</p>
<p>about taking it I fucking earned it I fucking deserve it now it&rsquo;s mine and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give a fuck the second thing I realized about asking why do so many</p>
<p>inconveniences happen like how does it benefit me why am I a match to this shit</p>
<p>when I am frustrated when I&rsquo;m working towards something when I&rsquo;m facing</p>
<p>challenges and consequences I feel more free to be truthful about the way that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling I feel more free to be more direct even if it sounds rude like I get</p>
<p>an excuse to not have to be so understanding it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m frustrated</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pissed off I&rsquo;m going straight for what the fuck I want I don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about navigating other people&rsquo;s feelings and navigating the situation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m straight up just going for what I want and I don&rsquo;t have to hide the</p>
<p>way that I feel I see where I want to go I&rsquo;m pissed off trying to get there</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s my goal so it&rsquo;s like I feel free to just be lying for it and not</p>
<p>have to like pussyfoot and like be considerate and sweet and like overly</p>
<p>sensitive it&rsquo;s like I just I get an excuse because I&rsquo;m pissed off that I can</p>
<p>just straight up go for it and be honest about the way that I feel and the thing</p>
<p>that I want so feeling like I suffer for things and feeling like I have to fight</p>
<p>for something makes me feel like I deserve it so that was a real addition</p>
<p>that came out of that and then I looked at am I actually being prevented because</p>
<p>I said I felt like I was being prevented like I was saying all these little</p>
<p>weird-ass things were lining up to like be inconvenient as fuck but then I had</p>
<p>to look at am I actually being prevented and the answer was no because I just saw</p>
<p>how everything being a convenient and why I was a match to so much frustration</p>
<p>was to help me it allowed me to feel like I deserve something and to feel</p>
<p>free to go straight for it so asking myself am I being prevented was a no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the way I was looking at everything happening like it&rsquo;s the way I</p>
<p>was looking at the universe it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re fucking preventing me like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not fair I felt like it was very unfair but then I had to look at my idea of how</p>
<p>things are supposed to go so in the universe and in the world and everything</p>
<p>there is contrast there is good and bad there is black and white with everything</p>
<p>so even with the things that I want there are good and there are bad with</p>
<p>the things I don&rsquo;t want there&rsquo;s good parts to it and then there&rsquo;s bad parts</p>
<p>to it but with whatever you go for in life or whatever you try to do it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just gonna be smooth sailing for anything or anyone it might seem like</p>
<p>that for other people but it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re fucking hiding the truth they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not showing how much they&rsquo;re suffering they&rsquo;re just showing how much they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gaining but that is the universal truth contrast there&rsquo;s good and bad with</p>
<p>everything so I was sitting here telling myself me going for what I want I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>being prevented I&rsquo;m really not we discovered all that but then I looked at</p>
<p>oh my god it should be easy to follow my desires and follow my purpose no it</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not going to be for anyone because like I said there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>contrasts and everything there&rsquo;s good and bad in everything so for me to</p>
<p>follow my purpose and for me to try and do the things that I do and make the</p>
<p>content that I make there&rsquo;s gonna be bad parts to it too and it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>how pure your heart is and how pure your intentions are and how much you truly</p>
<p>want to help you are still gonna be shit on either way like you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>blessed and shit on at the same time it&rsquo;s just how it&rsquo;s gonna go with</p>
<p>everything you try and do so like people even with ill intentions there&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be good and bad with that like people with bad intentions they just want to</p>
<p>steal and like make money real quick they&rsquo;re gonna manipulate people and like</p>
<p>fuck them over for the money they get the positive of getting the money they</p>
<p>get the positive of feeling successful and then they have the negative of</p>
<p>everything that comes with that so they&rsquo;re gonna face frustration as</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re moving toward it too they&rsquo;re gonna face the frustration of getting to</p>
<p>a point where they realize they&rsquo;ve scammed all these fucking people they no</p>
<p>longer have clients they no longer have people that want shit to do with them so</p>
<p>they got what they wanted but they lost everything at the same time like they</p>
<p>lost what&rsquo;s truly valuable does that make sense like it doesn&rsquo;t matter good</p>
<p>or bad there&rsquo;s shit that&rsquo;s gonna come along so even with all these</p>
<p>realizations I didn&rsquo;t feel better because I was still faced with all right</p>
<p>I still have to fucking be strong like I still am back at that spot so now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna tell you how I got through that I&rsquo;ve had to pick myself up so many times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of picking myself up and you guys have no idea what I deal with</p>
<p>emotionally and mentally because I see things that normal people don&rsquo;t see I</p>
<p>feel things no people don&rsquo;t feel like people that have expanded awareness and</p>
<p>higher awareness levels we see a lot but when you expand and you&rsquo;re willing to</p>
<p>feel things and see things you can&rsquo;t control what you see and feel but</p>
<p>everything about those experiences is gonna get higher so in emotions I feel</p>
<p>emotions ten times stronger than normal people so the happy times I have are ten</p>
<p>times happier but then the sad times and the painful times is ten times stronger</p>
<p>and it gets debilitating at times so my strength has built because when I was</p>
<p>like asleep before I started like waking up it wasn&rsquo;t that hard to pick myself up</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t feel my emotions that strongly but now I&rsquo;m in a place where I</p>
<p>feel my emotions to a point that they&rsquo;re debilitating to have to pick myself up</p>
<p>out of that state takes ten times more strength so when I say my strength is</p>
<p>exhausted it&rsquo;s for many fucking reasons but this is the side of getting in touch</p>
<p>with yourself and the side of self-development that other people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to talk about they want to make it sound like it&rsquo;s all gumdrops and roses</p>
<p>and happy times and fucking peaches and cream it sucks ass okay it&rsquo;s the best of</p>
<p>the best and the worst of the worst you have you can&rsquo;t say yes to only the best</p>
<p>of the best without also saying yes to the worst of the worst that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>also about contrast but getting in tune with yourself and gaining awareness like</p>
<p>bitch it gets rough it&rsquo;s the most rewarding thing but your pain is gonna</p>
<p>seem so much bigger because it is you see it for truly what it is you feel it</p>
<p>at the level it&rsquo;s meant to be felt on and that shit is like not fun so</p>
<p>realizing all that shit was cute and fun but like I said I still felt so pissed</p>
<p>off that I had to be strong like just these realizations didn&rsquo;t set me free I</p>
<p>still had that resentment of like okay now I know all this I&rsquo;m still gonna have</p>
<p>to go live life with these new beliefs and these new outlooks but I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>dealing with that like I&rsquo;m tired of being strong I can give you a visual I</p>
<p>felt like I was trapped in a hole like deep in the ground and it&rsquo;s like I keep</p>
<p>trying to climb out of this hole and every time I get up to the top of the</p>
<p>hole something kicks me the fuck back in and I fall back down to the bottom or as</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m climbing up my ladder breaks or I fucking something happens and I fall</p>
<p>back down I hit the bottom it&rsquo;s like you can only try and climb out of the</p>
<p>fucking hole so many times and you can only get kicked back down so many times</p>
<p>before you just throw your hands up and say fuck it I&rsquo;m just gonna fucking lay</p>
<p>at the bottom then and that&rsquo;s exactly where I was I was faced with a decision</p>
<p>of like okay I&rsquo;ve been kicked down this many times so I can choose to just sit</p>
<p>here or I can choose to keep trying and this was one of the scariest things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever done and ever gone into but for the first time I felt relief by</p>
<p>throwing my hands up and just laying at the bottom and not trying to get out</p>
<p>because your only options are to die or to keep trying to get out or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be stuck in the hole until you die it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s it and I always follow</p>
<p>the feeling of relief and it felt like relief to just sit at the bottom and</p>
<p>stop trying because I knew no matter how strong I am no matter how many times I</p>
<p>climb up something&rsquo;s gonna kick me the fuck back in so when I say it was scary</p>
<p>what I had to do was fully face the situation for what it is and where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>at like if I feel like I&rsquo;m ready to just give up then I&rsquo;m gonna stop toying with</p>
<p>that possibility and just do it so I made myself lay like imaginatively like</p>
<p>lay in the bottom of the hole so that what I did in real life was I fully</p>
<p>allowed myself to give up I literally took a piss and I laid in my bed and I</p>
<p>was like you never have to get up again you can lay here until you fucking die</p>
<p>and just give up like I let myself just give up and I got to fully explore the</p>
<p>freedom and experience the freedom of no pressure no stress no headache no oh my</p>
<p>god I have to get up oh my god I&rsquo;m gonna lose all my social media oh my god I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna lose all my clients oh my god I&rsquo;m gonna hurt these people by giving up I</p>
<p>just let myself lay in the bed and I stopped reasoning with anything I felt I</p>
<p>no longer was thinking oh my god I have to get up to go do this thing I gave up</p>
<p>I mentally told myself you never have to do anything again you&rsquo;re free to just</p>
<p>lay in this bed and give up and I made myself but I said Leo if you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>choose to give up give the fuck up you&rsquo;re not getting up to pee you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting up to eat lay in this fucking bed and give up and that&rsquo;s exactly what</p>
<p>I did like I said I didn&rsquo;t judge how I was feeling I didn&rsquo;t feel anything</p>
<p>anymore I was so happy to be relieved of all the pressure and all the fucking</p>
<p>stress I was under with everything I&rsquo;m trying to do it&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>think about the future I don&rsquo;t have to think about anybody else or anything</p>
<p>else it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m I just got to give up I got to relieve myself of everything</p>
<p>and I just got to lay there and it was so fucking peaceful for about an hour</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t shame myself I just let myself lay there and fucking do it I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t beat myself up mentally oh you&rsquo;re a fucking fuck-up you&rsquo;re a waste like</p>
<p>you just wasted your life I didn&rsquo;t say none of that because that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so worried about is like wasting my potential could have done should have</p>
<p>done would have done it&rsquo;s like I didn&rsquo;t have to think about any of that for the</p>
<p>first time like I literally just was free like truly fucking free and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like I just laid in the bottom of the hole and I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m never I never have</p>
<p>to try and climb out again and I just like was so relieved and so happy but</p>
<p>like I said it only lasted for an hour because I got to experience the relief I</p>
<p>was looking for and I no longer had any pressure no longer had any obligations</p>
<p>but I committed to giving up I didn&rsquo;t let myself get up to pee I didn&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>myself get up to fucking do anything like I just laid there after laying there</p>
<p>for a little bit I was like okay now what like I literally was just laying in</p>
<p>the bed and I was like okay this was fun this was cute but like I felt everything</p>
<p>I wanted to feel I experienced it all I got relief from the pressure finally</p>
<p>because I fully committed to giving up and I allowed myself to do that you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just half-ass like give up you have to like fully give up and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I did that&rsquo;s why I said it was so fucking scary because I literally in</p>
<p>that moment decided to throw my life away as I knew it I was like okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>done like I was dealing with that much internally I don&rsquo;t want to say I was in</p>
<p>that much pain but kind of like I was just at that level of hopeless that I</p>
<p>fully just let myself give up I got bored I genuinely got bored and I was</p>
<p>like what now like to lay at the bottom of the hole to lay in my bed and just</p>
<p>give up I was like well I&rsquo;m still here like there&rsquo;s nothing left to fucking do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m just there I got to experience no positives and no negatives</p>
<p>I got to just experience true like neutral and that&rsquo;s not good for a human</p>
<p>being we be getting bored like I said like it&rsquo;s just fucking like it&rsquo;s not fun</p>
<p>and allowing myself to get there I realized I don&rsquo;t actually want to stay</p>
<p>there like to not feel anything at all and to just live in neutral and like</p>
<p>numb I was like and so then I started thinking okay if this is what giving up</p>
<p>feels like and everything in life is hard and difficult and it all comes with</p>
<p>positives and negatives like every time I try to climb out of this fucking hole</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s gonna come with positives and negatives but is there anything that</p>
<p>I would be willing to say yes to the positives and the negatives of it like</p>
<p>in life is there anything I want bad enough that I&rsquo;m willing to suffer for it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s all just gonna be suffering there&rsquo;s gonna be good and</p>
<p>bad with anything you decide to do so I was like thinking is there anything in</p>
<p>life that I&rsquo;m willing to take on the negatives as well as the positives for</p>
<p>it and if nothing was ever gonna be worth it like for me to be working</p>
<p>towards something it&rsquo;s like if I never truly got out of the hole what would</p>
<p>make me happy to just keep climbing like what about just trying to climb out of</p>
<p>the hole would make me happy what could I climb for even if I never got out like</p>
<p>is there anything I&rsquo;d be willing to climb for that like I never got any</p>
<p>reward out of and I never got anything out of is there anything I&rsquo;m willing to</p>
<p>suffer for was number one and number two is there anything that I would just try</p>
<p>and go for just to try and go for it whether I get it or not because I just</p>
<p>want to go for it you know what I mean and those two questions are what got me</p>
<p>back in front of this fucking camera because this podcast and doing what I do</p>
<p>in my life and sharing the awareness I&rsquo;ve gained is what I would do even if</p>
<p>I never got anything for it like I would gladly just continue to do this</p>
<p>just to do it because I like to do it so now I&rsquo;m climbing with no hope of</p>
<p>getting out of a hole I&rsquo;m just climbing to climb and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m now</p>
<p>dedicating my energy and my goals to like I had to reset all new goals and I</p>
<p>was like I&rsquo;m done doing shit I&rsquo;m not willing to suffer for so everything I am</p>
<p>willing to suffer for and do just for the fuck of it now I&rsquo;m doing that and I</p>
<p>feel relief I don&rsquo;t feel like I have to be strong the whole obligation and</p>
<p>resentment to like being strong is gone like I&rsquo;m happy to go for the things that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing now because I&rsquo;m not doing it for an end goal I&rsquo;m doing it to do it</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m sharing what I know to share it I coach people one-on-one to help them I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need anything back like these are just the things that I genuinely feel</p>
<p>like energized to do and these are the things I&rsquo;m willing to say yes to all of</p>
<p>the headache that comes with it just because I enjoy doing it but this whole</p>
<p>experience brought me a lot of new awareness of like how I want to structure</p>
<p>my life and how I want to live my life like I want to spend more time with</p>
<p>people and friends and I&rsquo;ve been making time for that and I feel so much better</p>
<p>and this does not feel like one of the times where I was having to just fight</p>
<p>through and be strong this feels like true strength this feels like true</p>
<p>resilience because resilience is not how many times can you get up after being</p>
<p>knocked down resilience is being able to keep moving and keep going through</p>
<p>things I feel like I truly have that because of all this shit that I realized</p>
<p>and just went through and also there&rsquo;s been a lot less inconveniences since</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve like recommitted like it&rsquo;s just weird how it all worked like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>realized the shadow behind it and why I was a match to it but there still are</p>
<p>little inconveniences and headaches but like now things are lining up for me and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re lining up in like a better way and in ways that I haven&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>imagined like I didn&rsquo;t realize shit could like happen like this so it all</p>
<p>flipped once I did the internal work of everything I felt like was lining up</p>
<p>against me so things are lining up now to go with me and to help me like this</p>
<p>has been some real life-changing shit and if you want help with anything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re facing or going through or you just need a little direction you look</p>
<p>kick in the ass you need some realizations you need some awareness you</p>
<p>can work with me one-on-one that&rsquo;s why I do one-on-one client calls and zoom</p>
<p>calls with people I like to share and help and I&rsquo;m able to truly do it and</p>
<p>truly make the changes people need and help them really transform not just what</p>
<p>these fucking self-help books do because I&rsquo;m doing it to myself like I will never</p>
<p>teach something that I have not used on myself and have done first like I know</p>
<p>how to create the real change that&rsquo;s why you guys like what I share is because it</p>
<p>really fucking works so if you&rsquo;re interested in scheduling with me and you</p>
<p>want to talk to me I&rsquo;ll leave the link to book a call with me in the</p>
<p>description and also with this podcast I set up a donations page so for everyone</p>
<p>that wants to support the podcast and show love I have it linked in the</p>
<p>description where you can make a donation but also every week between</p>
<p>Sunday to Sunday whoever sends in the highest donation gets a free one-on-one</p>
<p>zoom call with me so if that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re interested in the links are below</p>
<p>but I also want to get into one more thing I realized about this whole</p>
<p>situation and it&rsquo;s about feeling like I have to do everything alone and face</p>
<p>everything alone because like I said like I&rsquo;m very aware of things and I tend</p>
<p>to isolate a lot when I&rsquo;m dealing with shit because I feel like I&rsquo;m the only</p>
<p>one that can like help me and having to face everything alone or feeling like I</p>
<p>have had to face everything alone also built my resentment to having to do</p>
<p>shit and be strong I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m sick of fucking doing shit because I have to do</p>
<p>it all alone one and two which is inconvenient piss me off but I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>give you permission right now to ask people for help to ask people to help</p>
<p>you whether that&rsquo;s them doing something for you or just allowing people to</p>
<p>comfort you and I want to break down a lot of people&rsquo;s fear of like being a</p>
<p>bother because me too bitch I don&rsquo;t want to be a bother to nobody but allowing</p>
<p>people to help you allows them to feel useful to you like with people in your</p>
<p>life friends relationships parents whatever it is anyone in your life they</p>
<p>want to feel valued they want to feel useful to you so if you&rsquo;re someone that</p>
<p>just is strong and handles everything alone people are never gonna truly feel</p>
<p>connected to you or feel like they can relate to you because if you never share</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going through they don&rsquo;t know that you feel the same way that</p>
<p>they do so if someone is always coming to me to vent and talk about their</p>
<p>problems and ask me for help and ask me for advice and I just stand here solid</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m dealing with nothing if I never share back it&rsquo;s gonna push them away</p>
<p>because who the fuck wants to go to someone who has it all together all the</p>
<p>time nobody like if you truly want to connect with people you have to let them</p>
<p>know that you&rsquo;re struggling too you have to let them be there for you whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s emotionally or do a favor for you or ask you for help because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>times where I love to help people I love my friends asking for advice I love when</p>
<p>people come to me but I also need to give them the chance to be there for me</p>
<p>also it&rsquo;s a give-and-take you have to do both for many reasons like I said it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make them feel like they can relate to you you&rsquo;re gonna feel a lot</p>
<p>more connected they&rsquo;re gonna feel a lot more comfortable because they don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re just this thing that&rsquo;s so strong and impenetrable like I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>for so long like they feel like you&rsquo;re a human and they&rsquo;ll be able to care for</p>
<p>you more and they&rsquo;ll be happy to help you now there are certain people in your</p>
<p>life that are gonna fucking make it seem like you having any type of need or</p>
<p>needing any kind of help is an inconvenience don&rsquo;t go to those fucking</p>
<p>people because that&rsquo;s how I felt growing up that&rsquo;s why hyper independence</p>
<p>developed in me there were consequences anytime I needed something or wanted</p>
<p>something I was looking as an inconvenience so I didn&rsquo;t want to bother</p>
<p>anybody with anything I was going through but I had to get through a lot</p>
<p>of things personally to get to where I am but these are some of the</p>
<p>realizations I&rsquo;ve had around that with like the self-doubt the worry the fear</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like being hyper independent is keeping you distant from people so like</p>
<p>I said in my other episode on hookup culture we all want to feel connected we</p>
<p>all want to feel close to people so you have to do the things that are gonna</p>
<p>allow you to feel that and the first thing is breaking down that wall but</p>
<p>breaking down that wall to the right people is not gonna make you feel like</p>
<p>shit it&rsquo;s gonna make you feel better than ever you&rsquo;re gonna feel supported</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna feel cared for you&rsquo;re gonna feel seen if even someone can just make</p>
<p>you feel seen for what you&rsquo;re going through like I see that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>struggling just to feel like someone can see that is the best fucking feeling</p>
<p>like I had a girl DM me on Instagram today and say like she loves the podcast</p>
<p>she was being so sweet and then she said thank you for following your purpose and</p>
<p>that shit almost made me fucking cry because I felt like she saw me like she</p>
<p>was basically saying thank you for following your purpose because it</p>
<p>benefits everybody else like thank you for facing the struggles that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>facing and doing what you have to do to land in your purpose because everyone</p>
<p>gets to benefit so like it made me feel like all my suffering and all my work</p>
<p>was for something like I felt appreciated I felt seen so stop trying</p>
<p>to do everything alone well you can try to do it alone but stop forcing yourself</p>
<p>to do everything alone understand you can lean on people there are people who</p>
<p>are going to derive joy out of being there for you I promise if you have not</p>
<p>found them yet they&rsquo;re coming they&rsquo;re on their way they&rsquo;re coming into your life</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all a match to it because we all have to be waking the fuck up if you</p>
<p>liked this episode leave it a thumbs up if you want to be more aware and less</p>
<p>aggravated hit the subscribe button and watch my future episodes and let me know</p>
<p>your thoughts in the comments below if this was helpful to you or not or you</p>
<p>just want to let me know something leave a comment and also for the what would</p>
<p>Leo do leave me your situations in the comments or DM me on Instagram because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start incorporating that I&rsquo;m excited but I hope you learned something</p>
<p>thank you all for watching and I will see you next Sunday</p>
