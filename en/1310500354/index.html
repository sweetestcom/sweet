    <p>The following is a conversation with Batul Kachar,</p>
<p>an astrobiologist at University of Wisconsin,</p>
<p>studying the essential biological attributes of life.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got House of Macadamias for a satiating</p>
<p>and delicious snack.</p>
<p>Mizanamane for style.</p>
<p>8sleep for naps.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN for privacy and security.</p>
<p>GiveDirectly for philanthropy.</p>
<p>And Blinkist for nonfiction.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will, too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by House of Macadamias,</p>
<p>a company that ships delicious, high-quality,</p>
<p>and healthy macadamia nuts directly to your door,</p>
<p>which they did just today.</p>
<p>Another shipment.</p>
<p>I got, in my hand, an unopened box</p>
<p>dipped macadamia&rsquo;s chocolate flavor.</p>
<p>This is the one I went through first, last time,</p>
<p>and it was delicious.</p>
<p>It is an incredible source of happiness for me.</p>
<p>I knew for a long time that macadamia nuts</p>
<p>were really healthy,</p>
<p>because I remember when I was first exploring,</p>
<p>okay, so on keto, what is the way to get fats into the diet?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s to be a high-fat diet.</p>
<p>And I was looking at nuts, and I was thinking of,</p>
<p>okay, which nuts are the healthiest?</p>
<p>And I remember macadamia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always coming up to the top of the list.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try not to eat all of them,</p>
<p>so that I have some for guests when they come over,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like a perfect guest snack.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s healthy, it&rsquo;s delicious, it&rsquo;s just pure perfection.</p>
<p>They also sent me some macadamia bars,</p>
<p>which were also delicious last time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably prefer the whole nuts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nuts for nuts.</p>
<p>Anyway, go to houseofmacadamias.com slash Lex</p>
<p>to get 20% off your first order.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Mizzen and Main,</p>
<p>the maker of comfortable stylish dress shirts</p>
<p>and other menswear.</p>
<p>I wear their black dress shirt, and I love it.</p>
<p>I have a ton of them.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I do these ad reads,</p>
<p>I struggle to try to convey</p>
<p>exactly why I like this particular piece of clothing,</p>
<p>which is where I wish there was</p>
<p>like a brain-computer interface way</p>
<p>to directly communicate the actual experience</p>
<p>of wearing the clothing.</p>
<p>And if you get a large number of people with that data,</p>
<p>you get a sense of, okay,</p>
<p>well, 96% of people feel good in this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good chance that I will also feel good in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Of course, you could get that through self-report surveys,</p>
<p>but it would be nice to get direct data,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t lie, but the feelings don&rsquo;t lie.</p>
<p>But then again, there could be other kinds of variables,</p>
<p>like what else is going on in your life?</p>
<p>You might be just in a bad mood about something else,</p>
<p>or watch a really sad movie while wearing the shirt.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an imperfect system that we&rsquo;re gonna have to work out.</p>
<p>Right now, you&rsquo;ll get $35 off any regular price order</p>
<p>when you go to Mizzen and Main.com and use promo code Lex.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by Eat Sleep</p>
<p>and this new Pod 3 mattress.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been a sponsor forever,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been my bed mattress cooling system</p>
<p>when I sleep forever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a source of a lot of happiness.</p>
<p>I recently tweeted about the number of hours</p>
<p>there are in a regular lifetime.</p>
<p>You know, if you live 70 to 80 years old,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s about 600 to 700,000 hours in a life.</p>
<p>And I think a large percent of those hours</p>
<p>is spent sleeping.</p>
<p>Of course, you can think of sleeping</p>
<p>as a important process for health</p>
<p>to regenerate your energy and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But it is also in itself a source of happiness.</p>
<p>And I think you wanna use the best bed for the job.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just not a better feeling</p>
<p>of a cool surface with a warm blanket.</p>
<p>And a day full of battles won,</p>
<p>and you return to rest and reminisce about the battles.</p>
<p>So you can again, the next day,</p>
<p>return to the battles that are in store for you.</p>
<p>Check it out and get special savings</p>
<p>when you go to ASleep.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used them for many years.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve had the big, sexy button</p>
<p>that just works when you press it.</p>
<p>And I use it as the first layer of protection</p>
<p>of your data, of your privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>ISPs and basically a lot of different services</p>
<p>and tools collect your data.</p>
<p>And a good VPN should be your first layer</p>
<p>of protection in those situations, in most situations.</p>
<p>You know, you can also change your location in the world.</p>
<p>Now, this is useful for different services</p>
<p>like Netflix and so on.</p>
<p>But mostly, I just like it</p>
<p>from a software engineering design perspective.</p>
<p>I love tools that just work.</p>
<p>They do one thing and they do it really well.</p>
<p>And they do it across different platforms.</p>
<p>They never break down.</p>
<p>Everything just works.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s intuitive from the UI perspective.</p>
<p>And from the backend perspective,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s just works smooth.</p>
<p>Android, Linux, everything.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Go to ExpressVPN.com slash LexPod</p>
<p>for an extra three months free.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by GiveDirectly,</p>
<p>a nonprofit that lets you send cash</p>
<p>directly to people in need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perhaps a counterintuitive notion,</p>
<p>but the giving of money to alleviate</p>
<p>some of the suffering in the world</p>
<p>or to improve the quality of life</p>
<p>for a bunch of people in the world is not an easy problem.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many challenges.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just a lot of studies behind the principles</p>
<p>that GiveDirectly operates under,</p>
<p>which is if you actually give money</p>
<p>to the people most in need,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to themselves spend that money</p>
<p>to maximally improve their life.</p>
<p>This too is a counterintuitive notion,</p>
<p>but it works time and time again.</p>
<p>Like many things, I have so much to learn in this world</p>
<p>about challenging problems like this.</p>
<p>So philanthropy is definitely one of them.</p>
<p>So I should also mention that a bunch of guests,</p>
<p>previous guests of this podcast</p>
<p>have used GiveDirectly to donate money.</p>
<p>Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, Vitalik Buterin,</p>
<p>and several others.</p>
<p>Visit GiveDirectly.org slash Lex to learn more</p>
<p>and send cash directly to someone living in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s GiveDirectly.org slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Blinkist,</p>
<p>my favorite app for learning new things.</p>
<p>Blinkist takes key ideas from thousands of nonfiction books</p>
<p>and condenses them down into 15 minutes</p>
<p>that you can read or listen to.</p>
<p>I set the goal of reading one book a week.</p>
<p>I said a classic book, but really what I mean</p>
<p>is a book that really challenges you</p>
<p>and really makes you think.</p>
<p>So I look forward to seeing,</p>
<p>sort of using Blinkist to help me review the books,</p>
<p>actually also choose the books,</p>
<p>and maybe help others that are interested</p>
<p>in following along with my reading</p>
<p>to get deeper and deeper insights</p>
<p>into these different books.</p>
<p>I think my perspectives on many books I read</p>
<p>are non-standard.</p>
<p>I get lost on a single quote here and there,</p>
<p>and it just kind of takes me down</p>
<p>this whole tangent of thought,</p>
<p>these ideas that get inspired and get sparked,</p>
<p>and then I just construct this whole world</p>
<p>from a single quote sometimes.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what makes it interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very subjective experience,</p>
<p>like appreciating art, appreciating books, and so on.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can claim a special offer for savings</p>
<p>at Blinkist.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Batul Kachar.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>What is the phylogenetic tree,</p>
<p>or the evolutionary tree of life,</p>
<p>and what can we learn by running it back</p>
<p>and studying ancient gene sequences as you have?</p>
<p>I think phylogenetic trees could be</p>
<p>one of the most romantic and beautiful notions</p>
<p>that can come out of biology.</p>
<p>It shows us a way to depict the connectedness of life</p>
<p>and all living beings with one another.</p>
<p>It itself is an ever-evolving notion.</p>
<p>Biologists like visualizations.</p>
<p>They like these graphics, these diagrams,</p>
<p>and tree of life is one of them.</p>
<p>So the tree starts at a common ancestor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the other way around.</p>
<p>It starts from-</p>
<p>At the end?</p>
<p>It starts from the branches.</p>
<p>It starts from the tip of the branch, actually.</p>
<p>And then, depending on what you collected</p>
<p>to build the tree.</p>
<p>So depending on the branches,</p>
<p>depending on what&rsquo;s on the tip of the branch,</p>
<p>and I will explain what I mean,</p>
<p>the root will be determined by what is really sitting</p>
<p>on the tip of the branch of the tree.</p>
<p>So we could study the leaves of the tree</p>
<p>by looking at what we have today</p>
<p>and then start to reverse engineer,</p>
<p>start to move back in time to try to understand</p>
<p>what the rest of the tree,</p>
<p>what the roots of the tree look like.</p>
<p>Exactly, so the tree itself,</p>
<p>by just taking a few steps back</p>
<p>and looking at the entire tree itself,</p>
<p>can give you an idea about the connectedness,</p>
<p>the relatedness of the organisms,</p>
<p>or whatever, again, you use to create your tree.</p>
<p>There are different ways.</p>
<p>But in this case, I&rsquo;m imagining entire diversity</p>
<p>of life today is sitting on the tips</p>
<p>of the branches of this tree.</p>
<p>And we look at biologists, look at the tree itself.</p>
<p>We like to think of it as the topology of the tree</p>
<p>to understand when certain organisms</p>
<p>or their ancestry may have merged over time.</p>
<p>Depending on the tools you use,</p>
<p>you might use this tree to then reconstruct</p>
<p>the ancestors as well.</p>
<p>And so what are the different ways</p>
<p>to do the reconstruction?</p>
<p>So you can do that at the gene level,</p>
<p>or you could do it at the higher complex biology level, right?</p>
<p>So in which way have you approached</p>
<p>this fascinating problem?</p>
<p>We approached it in every way we can.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the gene, could be protein,</p>
<p>the product of the gene, or species,</p>
<p>or could be even groups of species.</p>
<p>It totally depends on what you want to do with your tree.</p>
<p>If you wanna understand certain past events,</p>
<p>whether an organism exchanged a certain DNA</p>
<p>with another one along the course of evolution,</p>
<p>you can build your tree accordingly.</p>
<p>If you rather use the tree to reconstruct</p>
<p>or resurrect ancient DNA, which is what we do,</p>
<p>then in our case, for instance,</p>
<p>we do both gene, protein, and species</p>
<p>because we want to compare the tree</p>
<p>that we create using these different information.</p>
<p>Okay, well, let me ask you the ridiculous question then.</p>
<p>So how realistic is Jurassic Park?</p>
<p>Can we study the genes of ancient organisms,</p>
<p>and can we bring those ancient organisms back?</p>
<p>So the reason I ask that kind of ridiculous sounding question</p>
<p>is maybe it gives us context of what we can and can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>by looking back in time.</p>
<p>Yeah, so dinosaurs or all these mammals,</p>
<p>at least for us, is the exciting thing already happened</p>
<p>by the time we hit to the larger organisms or to eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Oh, to you, the fun stuff is before we got to the mammals.</p>
<p>The fun stuff is what people think is boring, I think.</p>
<p>The phase that&rsquo;s, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two different times in the geologic history.</p>
<p>One is the first life, past origin of life,</p>
<p>how did first life look like?</p>
<p>And the second is why do we think that</p>
<p>over certain periods of geologic time,</p>
<p>no significant innovation happened</p>
<p>to the degree of leaving no record behind?</p>
<p>So what do we not have a record of?</p>
<p>Which part?</p>
<p>So you say, the fun stuff to you</p>
<p>is after the origin of life, which we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>After the origin of life, there&rsquo;s single cell organisms,</p>
<p>the whole thing with the photosynthesis,</p>
<p>the whole thing with the eukaryotes</p>
<p>and multi-cell organisms, and what else is the fun stuff?</p>
<p>The whole oxygen thing,</p>
<p>which mixes in with the origin of life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of different inventions,</p>
<p>all they have to do with this primitive</p>
<p>kind of looking organisms</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have a good record of.</p>
<p>So I will tell you the more interesting things for us.</p>
<p>One is the origin of life or what happened, right,</p>
<p>following the emergence of life.</p>
<p>How did the first cells look like?</p>
<p>And then pretty much anything</p>
<p>that we think shaped the environments</p>
<p>and was shaped by the environments</p>
<p>in a way that impacted the entire planet</p>
<p>that enabled you and I to have this conversation.</p>
<p>We have very little understanding</p>
<p>of the biological innovations that took place</p>
<p>in the past of this planet.</p>
<p>We work with a very limited set of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna even say data</p>
<p>because they are fossil records.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say imprints,</p>
<p>either that comes from the rock and the rock record itself,</p>
<p>or what I just described,</p>
<p>these trees that we create</p>
<p>and whatever we can infer about the past.</p>
<p>So we have two distinct ways</p>
<p>that comes from geology and biology,</p>
<p>and they each have their limitations.</p>
<p>Okay, so, right, so there&rsquo;s an interplay.</p>
<p>The geology gives you that little bit of data,</p>
<p>and then the biology gives you</p>
<p>that little bit of kind of constraints</p>
<p>in the materials you get to work with to infer</p>
<p>how does this result in the kind of data that we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>And now we can have this through the fog.</p>
<p>We can see, we can look back hundreds of millions of years,</p>
<p>a couple of billion years, and try to infer.</p>
<p>Even further, and I like that you said fog.</p>
<p>It is pretty foggy, what we are,</p>
<p>and it gets foggier and foggier</p>
<p>the more you, the further you try to see into the past.</p>
<p>Biology is, you basically study the survivors,</p>
<p>broadly speaking, and you&rsquo;re trying to pitch the,</p>
<p>sort of put together their history</p>
<p>based on whatever you can recover today.</p>
<p>What makes biology fascinating</p>
<p>also let it erase its own history in a way, right?</p>
<p>So you work with this four billion year product,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s genome, that&rsquo;s the DNA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great, it&rsquo;s a very dynamic,</p>
<p>ever evolving chemical thing.</p>
<p>And so you will get some information,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not gonna get much</p>
<p>unless you know where to look</p>
<p>because it is responding to the environment.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what we have, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>What we have is the survivors, the successful,</p>
<p>the successful organisms, even the primitive ones,</p>
<p>even the bacteria we have today.</p>
<p>So bacteria is not primitive, and we-</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry to offend the bacteria.</p>
<p>We should be very grateful to bacteria.</p>
<p>First of all, they are our great, great ancestors.</p>
<p>I like this quote by Douglas Adams,</p>
<p>humans don&rsquo;t like their ancestors,</p>
<p>they rarely invite them over for dinner, right?</p>
<p>But bacteria is in your dinner,</p>
<p>bacteria is in your gut,</p>
<p>bacteria is helping you along the way.</p>
<p>So we do invite them for dinner.</p>
<p>Well, they get themselves invited in a way.</p>
<p>And so we, and they&rsquo;re definitely older</p>
<p>and definitely very sophisticated,</p>
<p>very resilient than anything else.</p>
<p>As someone working as a bacteriologist,</p>
<p>I feel like I need to defend them in this case</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t get much shout out</p>
<p>when we think about life.</p>
<p>So you do study bacteria.</p>
<p>So which organisms gives you hints that are alive today</p>
<p>that give you hints about what ancient organisms were like?</p>
<p>Is it bacteria, is it viruses?</p>
<p>What do you study in the lab?</p>
<p>We study a variety of different bacteria,</p>
<p>depending on the questions that we ask.</p>
<p>We engineer bacteria.</p>
<p>So ideally, we wanna work with bacteria</p>
<p>that we can engineer.</p>
<p>Seldom we developed the tools to engineer them.</p>
<p>And it depends on the question that we are interested in.</p>
<p>If we are interested in connecting the biology and geology</p>
<p>to understand the early life and fundamental innovations</p>
<p>across billions of years,</p>
<p>there are really good candidates like cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>So we use cyanobacteria very frequently in the lab.</p>
<p>We can engineer its genome.</p>
<p>We can perturb its function by poking its own DNA</p>
<p>with the foreign DNA that we engineer in the lab.</p>
<p>We work with E. coli.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most simple in terms of model systems goes.</p>
<p>Organism that one can study, well-established,</p>
<p>sort of a pet, lab pet that we use it a lot for cloning</p>
<p>and for understanding basic functions of the cell,</p>
<p>given that it&rsquo;s really well studied.</p>
<p>So, and what you do with that E. coli,</p>
<p>you said that you inject it with foreign DNA?</p>
<p>We inject pretty much all the bacteria</p>
<p>that we work with, with foreign DNA.</p>
<p>We also work with diazotrophs.</p>
<p>These are azotobacteria.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re one of the prime nitrogen fixers,</p>
<p>nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Can you explain what that is, nitrogen-fixing?</p>
<p>Is that, is the source of its energy?</p>
<p>So nitrogen is a triple-bond gas</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty abundant in the atmosphere,</p>
<p>but nitrogen itself cannot be directly utilized by cells</p>
<p>given it is triple-bond.</p>
<p>It needs to be converted to ammonia</p>
<p>that is then used for the downstream cellular functions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what counts as nitrogen-fixing.</p>
<p>Yes, so nitrogen needs to be fixed</p>
<p>before our cells can make use of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>No offense to nitrogen either.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s actually a very important element.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most abundant elements on our planet</p>
<p>that is used by biology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in ATP, it&rsquo;s in chlorophyll,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uses, that relies on nitrogen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very important enzyme for a lot of cell functions.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just one mechanism</p>
<p>that evolution invented to convert it, to fix it.</p>
<p>So far we know there&rsquo;s only one nitrogen-fixation pathway,</p>
<p>as opposed to, say, carbon.</p>
<p>You can find up to seven or eight</p>
<p>different carbon-based microbes invented to fix carbon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the case for nitrogen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a singularity across geologic time.</p>
<p>We think it evolved around 2.7 maybe, roughly three,</p>
<p>probably less than three billion years ago.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only way that nature invented</p>
<p>to fix the nitrogen in the atmosphere</p>
<p>for the subsequent use.</p>
<p>Would we still have life as we know it today</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t invent that nitrogen-fixing step?</p>
<p>I cannot think of it, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essential to life as we know.</p>
<p>You and I are having this conversation</p>
<p>because life found a way to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>Is that one of the tougher ones?</p>
<p>If you put it sort of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon,</p>
<p>what are, in terms of being able to work</p>
<p>with these elements, what is the hardest thing?</p>
<p>What is the most essential for life?</p>
<p>Just to give context.</p>
<p>Well, we think of this as the cocktail.</p>
<p>You may hear schnapps.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in the cocktail?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the schnapps, right?</p>
<p>Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur.</p>
<p>So there are five elements that life relies on.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t quite know whether that&rsquo;s the only,</p>
<p>out of many options, that life necessarily</p>
<p>needs to operate on.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just how it happened on our own planet.</p>
<p>And there are many abiotic ways to fix nitrogen,</p>
<p>like lightning, right?</p>
<p>Lightning can accumulate ammonia.</p>
<p>Humans found a way about 100 years ago,</p>
<p>I think around World War I, the Haber-Bosch process</p>
<p>that we can abiotically convert nitrogen into ammonia.</p>
<p>Actually, 50% of the nitrogen in our bodies</p>
<p>comes from the human conversion of nitrogen to ammonia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helped, it&rsquo;s the fertilizer that we use, urea,</p>
<p>comes from that process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in our food.</p>
<p>So we found a way to fix our own nitrogen for ourselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s way after the original invention</p>
<p>of how to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>And without that, we wouldn&rsquo;t have all the steps</p>
<p>of evolution along the way.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>We tried to replicate in the most simplest way</p>
<p>what nature has come up with, right?</p>
<p>We do this by taking nitrogen, using a lot of pressure,</p>
<p>and then generating ammonia.</p>
<p>Life does this in a more sophisticated way,</p>
<p>relying on one single enzyme called nitrogenase.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the nitrogen that is used together</p>
<p>with eight electron donor and ATP,</p>
<p>together with a lot of hydrogen.</p>
<p>Life pushes this metabolism down to create fixed nitrogen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite remarkable.</p>
<p>So the lab pet E. coli, inject them with DNA,</p>
<p>so E. coli does nitrogen fixing in part,</p>
<p>or is that a different one?</p>
<p>So some biological engineers engineered E. coli</p>
<p>to fix nitrogen, I believe, not us.</p>
<p>We use nature&rsquo;s nitrogen fixing bug</p>
<p>and engineer it with the nitrogen fixing metabolism</p>
<p>that we resurrected using our computational</p>
<p>and phylogenetic tools.</p>
<p>How complicated are these little organisms?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>It depends on how we define complication.</p>
<p>Okay, so I can tell that you appreciate</p>
<p>and respect the full complexity</p>
<p>of even the most seemingly primitive organisms,</p>
<p>because none of them are primitive.</p>
<p>Okay, that said, what kind of, what are we talking about?</p>
<p>What kind of machineries do they have</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working with when you&rsquo;re injecting them with DNA?</p>
<p>So I will start with one of the most fascinating machineries</p>
<p>that we target, which is the translation machinery.</p>
<p>It is a very unique subsystem of cellular life</p>
<p>in comparison to, I would say, metabolism.</p>
<p>And we used to, when we are thinking about cellular life,</p>
<p>we think of cell as the basic unit or the building block.</p>
<p>But from a key perspective, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>That one may argue that everything that happens</p>
<p>inside the cell serves the translation</p>
<p>and the translation machinery.</p>
<p>There is a nice paper that called this,</p>
<p>that the entire cell is hopelessly addicted</p>
<p>to this main informatic, computing,</p>
<p>biological, chemical system</p>
<p>that is operating at the heart of the cell.</p>
<p>Which is the translation?</p>
<p>It is the translation.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the translation from what to what?</p>
<p>So RNA to enzymes?</p>
<p>It converts a linear sequence of mRNA</p>
<p>into a folded, later folded protein.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the, that&rsquo;s the core processing center</p>
<p>for information for life.</p>
<p>It has multiple steps.</p>
<p>It initiates, it elongates, it terminates, and it recycles.</p>
<p>It operates discrete bits of information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s itself is like a chemical decoding device.</p>
<p>And that is incredibly unique for translation</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think you will find anywhere else</p>
<p>in the cell that does this.</p>
<p>So even though it&rsquo;s called translation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really like a factory that reads the schematic</p>
<p>and builds a three-dimensional object.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a printer.</p>
<p>I would divide it into actually even four more</p>
<p>additional steps or disciplines</p>
<p>than what would it take to study it</p>
<p>by the way you described it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a chemical system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the compounds that make it up are chemicals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s physical.</p>
<p>It tracks the energy to make its job, to do its job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s informatic.</p>
<p>What is processed are the bits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s computational.</p>
<p>The discrete states that the system is placed</p>
<p>when the information is being processed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s itself is computational.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s biological.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s variability and inheritance</p>
<p>that come from imperfect replication</p>
<p>even and imperfect computation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Oh man, that&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>So from the biology comes the,</p>
<p>like when you mess up, the bugs are the features.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biology.</p>
<p>Informatics is obvious in the RNA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s this set of information there.</p>
<p>The different steps along the way</p>
<p>is actually kind of what the computer does with bits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done computation, physical.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, I guess, almost like a mechanical process</p>
<p>to the whole thing that requires energy.</p>
<p>And actually, it&rsquo;s manipulating actual physical objects</p>
<p>and chemicals because you have to,</p>
<p>ultimately, it&rsquo;s all chemistry.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it tracks this information.</p>
<p>So it is almost a mini computer device inside ourselves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the oldest computational device of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely the key operation system</p>
<p>that had to evolve for life to emerge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more interesting,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s more complicated in interesting ways</p>
<p>than the computers we have today.</p>
<p>I mean, everything you said, which is really, really nice.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess our computers have the informatic</p>
<p>and they have the computational,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have the chemical,</p>
<p>the physical, or the biology.</p>
<p>Exactly, and the computers don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t link information to function, right?</p>
<p>They are not tightly coupled,</p>
<p>nowhere close to what translation</p>
<p>or the way translation does it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the number one, I think,</p>
<p>difference between the two.</p>
<p>And yes, it&rsquo;s informatic,</p>
<p>and we can discuss this further too.</p>
<p>100%, let&rsquo;s please discuss this further.</p>
<p>Which part are we discussing further?</p>
<p>Each one of those are fascinating worlds,</p>
<p>each of the five.</p>
<p>Yeah, so well, we can start with the more,</p>
<p>I guess the ones that are more established,</p>
<p>which is the chemical aspect of the translation machinery.</p>
<p>The specific compounds make up the assembly of RNA.</p>
<p>Chemists showed this in many different ways.</p>
<p>We can rip apart the entire machinery.</p>
<p>We know that at the core of it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an RNA that operates</p>
<p>not only as an information system itself</p>
<p>or information itself, but also as an enzyme.</p>
<p>And origin of life chemists make these molecules easily.</p>
<p>Now we know we can manipulate RNA.</p>
<p>We can make, even with single-pot chemistries,</p>
<p>we can create compounds.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a single-pot chemistry?</p>
<p>I would say when you add all the recipes</p>
<p>that you know that will lead you to the final product.</p>
<p>This is what origin of life chemists do,</p>
<p>is they come up with this pot,</p>
<p>they throw a bunch of chemicals in,</p>
<p>and they try to, they&rsquo;re basically chefs of a certain kind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s what they call it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s how I think of it,</p>
<p>because it is all combined in a test tube,</p>
<p>and you know the outcome.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very mathematical.</p>
<p>Once you know the right environment</p>
<p>and the right chemistry that needs to get</p>
<p>into this container or this pot,</p>
<p>you know what the outcome is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no luck there anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty rigid, established input-output system,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all chemistry.</p>
<p>So you actually wear a lot of hats.</p>
<p>Is one of them origin of life chemists?</p>
<p>My PhD is in chemistry,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t do origin of life chemistry.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re interested in origin of life.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>So some of your best friends are origin of life chemists.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you have good chemist friends</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in origin of life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 100% required.</p>
<p>It should be mandatory.</p>
<p>Okay, so chemistry.</p>
<p>So what else about this machinery</p>
<p>that we need to know chemically?</p>
<p>Well, chemically, I think that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>You have enzymes, you have proteins.</p>
<p>Enzymes are doing their thing.</p>
<p>They know how to chew energy using ATP or GTP.</p>
<p>They know what to do in their own way.</p>
<p>They do their enzymatic thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the ribosome</p>
<p>that is at the heart of the transition,</p>
<p>but there are a lot of different proteins.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at about 100 different components</p>
<p>that compose this machinery.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask, maybe it&rsquo;s a ridiculous question,</p>
<p>but did the chemistry make this machine,</p>
<p>or did the machine use chemistry to achieve a purpose?</p>
<p>So like, I guess there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of different chemical possibilities on Earth.</p>
<p>Is this translation machinery just like choosing,</p>
<p>picking and choosing different chemical reactions</p>
<p>that it can use to achieve a purpose?</p>
<p>Or did the chemistry basically,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a momentum, like a constraint</p>
<p>to the thing that can only build</p>
<p>a certain kind of machinery?</p>
<p>Basically, is chemistry fundamental, or is it just emergent?</p>
<p>Like, how important is chemistry to this whole process?</p>
<p>You cannot have life without chemistry.</p>
<p>You cannot have any cellular process without chemistry.</p>
<p>What makes life interesting is that even</p>
<p>if the chemistry is imperfect,</p>
<p>even if there are accidents along the way,</p>
<p>if something binds to another chemical</p>
<p>in a way it shouldn&rsquo;t, there is resilience</p>
<p>within the system that it can maybe not necessarily</p>
<p>repair itself, but it moves on.</p>
<p>However imperfect, mistakes can be handled.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the biology comes in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the biology comes in.</p>
<p>But in terms of chemistry, you absolutely cannot</p>
<p>have a translation machinery without chemistry.</p>
<p>And so, as I said, there are four main steps.</p>
<p>These are the core steps that are conserved</p>
<p>in all translation machinery.</p>
<p>And I should say, all life has this machine, right?</p>
<p>Every cell, everything.</p>
<p>On Earth.</p>
<p>On Earth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>When you think of this machine,</p>
<p>do you think very specifically about the kind</p>
<p>of machinery that we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>or do you think more philosophically?</p>
<p>A machine that converts information into function.</p>
<p>I cannot separate the two.</p>
<p>I think what makes this machinery fascinating</p>
<p>is that those five components that I listed,</p>
<p>they coexist.</p>
<p>So, for instance, if we,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just, talking about the chemistry part,</p>
<p>we know the certain rate constant,</p>
<p>all these proteins that operate in this machinery</p>
<p>needs to harbor in order to get the mechanism going, right?</p>
<p>If you are bringing the information</p>
<p>to the translation machinery,</p>
<p>and you are the initiator of this computation system,</p>
<p>you need to have,</p>
<p>you can only afford a certain range of mistakes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too fast,</p>
<p>then the next message cannot be delivered fast.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too slow, you may stall the process.</p>
<p>So there is definitely a chemistry constant going on</p>
<p>within the machinery.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not perfect, far from it,</p>
<p>but they all have their own margin of error</p>
<p>that they can tolerate versus they cannot,</p>
<p>otherwise the system collapses.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a jazz ensemble,</p>
<p>the notes of the chemistry,</p>
<p>but you can be a little offbeat.</p>
<p>I like that you said jazz.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a party, and it&rsquo;s like everybody&rsquo;s invited,</p>
<p>and they need to operate together, right?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really cool about it, I think,</p>
<p>there are many things</p>
<p>that are very interesting about this thing,</p>
<p>but if you remove it from the cell</p>
<p>and put it in a cell-free environment,</p>
<p>it works just fine, right?</p>
<p>So you can get cell-free translation systems,</p>
<p>put this translation in a test tube,</p>
<p>and it is doing its thing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need the rest of the cell</p>
<p>to translate information.</p>
<p>Of course, you need to feed the information,</p>
<p>at least so far,</p>
<p>because we are far from evolving a translation,</p>
<p>maybe not so far,</p>
<p>evolving a translation in the lab,</p>
<p>or a machinery that can process information</p>
<p>as it generates it.</p>
<p>We have not done that yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty complicated machinery,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s hard for those origin of life chemists</p>
<p>to find a pot that generates.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s far more than chemistry.</p>
<p>You need biology, obviously.</p>
<p>You need biochemistry.</p>
<p>You need to think, as I think network systems folk,</p>
<p>you need to think about computation.</p>
<p>You need to think about information.</p>
<p>And that is not happening yet,</p>
<p>except we are trying to bring this perspective.</p>
<p>But the more you understand how the information systems work,</p>
<p>you cannot, once you see it, you cannot unsee it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things.</p>
<p>So, but you can still rip it out and the chemistry happens.</p>
<p>Yes, and chemistry can happen</p>
<p>even if you strip some of the parts out.</p>
<p>It can, you can get very minimal level</p>
<p>of information processing</p>
<p>that does not look anything like the translation</p>
<p>that cells relies on,</p>
<p>but chemists showed from linear,</p>
<p>you can generate information that arrives</p>
<p>to a processing center in the form of a linear polymer.</p>
<p>But the informatic part of this system</p>
<p>that I think sets it apart from computation</p>
<p>and from metabolism comes in,</p>
<p>if you think about the information itself, right?</p>
<p>So we have four nucleotide letters that compose DNA</p>
<p>and they are processed in the translation in triplets.</p>
<p>So you have in triplet codon fragments.</p>
<p>So you have four times four times four.</p>
<p>So you have 64 possible states that can be encoded</p>
<p>by four letters in three positions.</p>
<p>All right, so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so amazing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one code that says start.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, that there&rsquo;s only one.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s two, if not three, that says stop.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you work with,</p>
<p>but you can have 64 possible states,</p>
<p>but LIFE only uses 20 amino acids.</p>
<p>So we use, LIFE uses 64 possible states minus four</p>
<p>of the starts and stops</p>
<p>to code for 20 amino acids in different combinations.</p>
<p>That is really amazing.</p>
<p>If you think about,</p>
<p>there are 500 different amino acids LIFE can choose, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s narrowed it down to 20.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know why a lot of people think</p>
<p>about this genetic code is quite fascinating.</p>
<p>So far, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it didn&rsquo;t do it for 4 billion years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We may wait for another 4 billion years, but.</p>
<p>But you didn&rsquo;t have those amino acids</p>
<p>in the very beginning, right?</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So we wouldn&rsquo;t be fooling ourselves</p>
<p>if we said we know exactly how many amino acids existed.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no reason to think</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t the same set.</p>
<p>Or similar.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a good reason,</p>
<p>but because roughly 20 out of 60 states are used,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using one third of your possible states</p>
<p>in your information system.</p>
<p>So this may seem like a waste,</p>
<p>but informatically it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s abundant and it is redundant.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So this code degeneracy, you see this in,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s implemented by this translation machinery</p>
<p>inside the cell.</p>
<p>So it means we can make errors, right?</p>
<p>You can make errors, but the message will still get through.</p>
<p>You can speak, missing some letters to the information</p>
<p>can miss some parts, but the message will still get through.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s two thirds of the not used states</p>
<p>gives you that robustness and resilience within the system.</p>
<p>So at the informatic level, there&rsquo;s room for error.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably room for error probably</p>
<p>in all five categories that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably room for error in the computation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably room for error in the physical.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Everywhere there&rsquo;s room for error.</p>
<p>Because the informatic capacity is made possible</p>
<p>together with the other components.</p>
<p>And not only that, but also the product yields</p>
<p>a function, no, in this case, enzyme or protein.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really amazing to me.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I mean, in my head, just so you know,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a computer science AI person,</p>
<p>the parallels between even like language models</p>
<p>that encode language, or now they&rsquo;re able to encode</p>
<p>basically any kind of thing, including images and actions,</p>
<p>all in this kind of way.</p>
<p>The parallel in terms of informatic and computation</p>
<p>is just incredible.</p>
<p>Actually, I have a image maybe I can send you.</p>
<p>Can we pull it up now?</p>
<p>If you just do genetic codon charts, we can pull that up.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a very standard table.</p>
<p>So I can explain why this is so amazing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking at, this is life&rsquo;s alphabet, right?</p>
<p>So I also want to make a very quick link now</p>
<p>to your first question, the tree of life.</p>
<p>When we try to understand ancient languages,</p>
<p>or the cultures that use these extinct languages,</p>
<p>we start with the modern languages, right?</p>
<p>So we look at Indo-European languages</p>
<p>and try to understand certain words and make trees</p>
<p>to understand this is what Slavic word is for snow,</p>
<p>something like snig.</p>
<p>Now we jumped to languages that humans spoke.</p>
<p>Humans spoke, exactly.</p>
<p>So we make trees to understand what is the original</p>
<p>ancestor, what did they use to say snow?</p>
<p>And if you have a lot of cultures who use the word snow,</p>
<p>you can imagine that it was snowy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they needed that word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing for biology, right?</p>
<p>If we understand some function about that enzyme,</p>
<p>we can understand the environment that they lived in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar in that sense.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re looking at the alphabet of life.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s not 20 or 25 letters,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you have four letters.</p>
<p>So what is really interesting that stands out to me</p>
<p>when I look at this, on the outer shell,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at the 20 amino acids</p>
<p>that compose life, right?</p>
<p>The methionine that you see, that&rsquo;s the start.</p>
<p>So the start is always the same.</p>
<p>To me, that is fascinating,</p>
<p>that all life starts with the same start.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other start code.</p>
<p>So you sent the AUG to the cell,</p>
<p>that when that information arrives,</p>
<p>the translation knows, all right, I gotta start,</p>
<p>function is coming.</p>
<p>Following this is a chain of information</p>
<p>until the stop code arrives,</p>
<p>which are highlights that&rsquo;s in black squares.</p>
<p>So for people just listening,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at a standard RNA color table</p>
<p>organized in a wheel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an outer shell and there&rsquo;s an inner shell,</p>
<p>all using the four letters that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And with that, we can compose all of the amino acids</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a start and there&rsquo;s a stop.</p>
<p>And presumably you put together,</p>
<p>with these letters, you walk around the wheel</p>
<p>to put together the words, the sentences</p>
<p>and you, again, you get one start,</p>
<p>you get three, there are three different ways to stop this,</p>
<p>one way to start it.</p>
<p>And for each letter, you have multiple options.</p>
<p>So you say you have a code A,</p>
<p>the second code can be another A.</p>
<p>And even if you messed that up,</p>
<p>you still can rescue yourself.</p>
<p>So you can get, for instance,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at the lysine K,</p>
<p>you get an A and you get an A</p>
<p>and then you get an A that gives you the lysine.</p>
<p>But if you get an A and if you get an A and I get a G,</p>
<p>you still get the lysine.</p>
<p>So there are different combinations.</p>
<p>So even if there&rsquo;s an error,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know if these are selected</p>
<p>because they were erroneous</p>
<p>and somehow they got locked down.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a mechanism behind this too,</p>
<p>or we certainly don&rsquo;t know this definitively.</p>
<p>But this is the informatic part of this.</p>
<p>And notice that the colors in some tables too,</p>
<p>the colors will be coded in a way</p>
<p>that the type of the nucleotides can be similar chemically.</p>
<p>But the point is that you will still end up</p>
<p>with the same amino acids or something similar to it,</p>
<p>even if you mess up the code.</p>
<p>Do we understand the mechanism</p>
<p>how natural selection interplays</p>
<p>with this resilience to error?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Which errors result in the same output,</p>
<p>like the same function and which don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Which actually results in a dysfunction or which are-</p>
<p>We understand to some degree</p>
<p>how translation and the rest of the cell work together,</p>
<p>how an error at the translation level,</p>
<p>this is the really core level,</p>
<p>can impact entire cell.</p>
<p>But we understand very little</p>
<p>about the evolutionary mechanisms</p>
<p>behind the selection of the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thought to be as one of the hardest problems</p>
<p>in biology, and it is still the dark side of biology,</p>
<p>even though it is so essential.</p>
<p>So this is, yeah, you&rsquo;re looking at the language of life,</p>
<p>so to speak, and how it can found ways</p>
<p>rather to tolerate its own mistakes.</p>
<p>So the entire phylogenetic tree</p>
<p>can be like deconstructed with this wheel of language.</p>
<p>Because all the final letters,</p>
<p>those are, that&rsquo;s the 20 amino acids, that&rsquo;s our alphabet.</p>
<p>They are all brought together</p>
<p>with these bits of information, right?</p>
<p>So when you look at the genes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at those four letters.</p>
<p>When you look at the proteins,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at the 20 amino acids,</p>
<p>which may be a little easier way to track the information</p>
<p>when we create the tree.</p>
<p>So using this language,</p>
<p>we can describe all life that&rsquo;s lived on Earth.</p>
<p>I wish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, we are not that good at it yet, right?</p>
<p>So in theory, this is one way to look at life on Earth.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a biologist and you want to understand</p>
<p>how life evolved from a molecular perspective,</p>
<p>this would be the way to do it.</p>
<p>And this is what nature narrowed its code down to.</p>
<p>So when we think of nitrogen, when we think of carbon,</p>
<p>when we think of sulfur, it&rsquo;s all in this,</p>
<p>all these nucleotides are built based on those elements.</p>
<p>And this is fundamentally the informatic perspective.</p>
<p>Exactly, that&rsquo;s the informatic perspective.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to emphasize</p>
<p>that this is not engineered by humans.</p>
<p>This evolved by itself.</p>
<p>Like, right, humans didn&rsquo;t invent this</p>
<p>just because we were just describing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to find,</p>
<p>trying to describe the language of life.</p>
<p>It appears to be a highly optimized</p>
<p>chemical and information code.</p>
<p>It may indicate that a great deal of chemical evolution,</p>
<p>and this may indicate that a lot of selection pressure</p>
<p>and Darwinian evolution happened</p>
<p>prior to the rise of last universal common ancestor.</p>
<p>Because this is almost a bridge</p>
<p>that connects the earliest cells</p>
<p>to the last universal common ancestor.</p>
<p>Okay, can you describe what the heck you just said?</p>
<p>So this mechanism evolved before the what common ancestor?</p>
<p>The last universal common ancestor.</p>
<p>Yes, so when we talk about the tree,</p>
<p>when we think about the root,</p>
<p>if you ideally included all the living information</p>
<p>or all the available information</p>
<p>that comes from living organisms on your tree,</p>
<p>then on the root of your tree</p>
<p>lies the last universal common ancestor, Leuka, right?</p>
<p>Why last, last universal?</p>
<p>Because the earlier universal,</p>
<p>it also had trees, but they all died off.</p>
<p>We call it the last because it is sort of the first one</p>
<p>that we can track because we cannot,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what we cannot track, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one organism that started the whole thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like, I would think of it</p>
<p>as more like a population, a group of organisms</p>
<p>than a single-</p>
<p>Okay, hold on a second.</p>
<p>I tweeted this, so I wanna know the accuracy of my tweet.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Sometimes early in the morning,</p>
<p>I tweet very pothead-like things.</p>
<p>I said that we all evolved from one common ancestor</p>
<p>that was a single cell organism 3.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Something like this.</p>
<p>How true is that tweet?</p>
<p>Do I need to delete it?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s, actually, correct.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, of course, there&rsquo;s a lot to say,</p>
<p>which is like, we don&rsquo;t know exactly,</p>
<p>but to what degree is that,</p>
<p>the single organism aspect, is that true,</p>
<p>versus multiple organisms?</p>
<p>Do you want me to be-</p>
<p>Brutally honest?</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s still time.</p>
<p>This is how we get, like, caveats to tweets.</p>
<p>All right, so first of all, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>3.5 is still a very conservative estimate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>In which direction?</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s 3.8 is probably safer to say at this point.</p>
<p>A bunch of people said it probably way before that.</p>
<p>If you put an approximately, I&rsquo;ll take that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I just love the idea that I was once,</p>
<p>first of all, as a single organism, I was once a cell.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re still a, you&rsquo;re a group of cells.</p>
<p>No, but I started from a single cell.</p>
<p>Me, Lex.</p>
<p>You mean, like, you versus Luca?</p>
<p>Are you relating to Luca right now?</p>
<p>No, no, no, I&rsquo;m relating to my, like, Lex-</p>
<p>Your own development.</p>
<p>My own development, I started from a single cell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it like, built up and stuff, okay?</p>
<p>That, and then, so that&rsquo;s for a single biological organism.</p>
<p>And then, from an evolutionary perspective, the Luca,</p>
<p>like, I start, like, my ancestor is a single cell,</p>
<p>and then, here I am sitting, half-asleep, tweeting.</p>
<p>Like, I started from a single cell,</p>
<p>evolved a ton of murder along the way,</p>
<p>to this, like, brutal search for adaptation</p>
<p>through the 3.5, .8 billion years.</p>
<p>So, you defy the code of Douglas Adams.</p>
<p>You are proud of your ancestors,</p>
<p>and you invite them over to dinner,</p>
<p>and you invite them over to your Twitter.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s amazing that this,</p>
<p>to the degree you can call it intelligence,</p>
<p>emerged to be able to tweet whatever the heck I want.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s almost intelligence at the chemical level,</p>
<p>and this is also probably one of the first</p>
<p>chemically intelligent system</p>
<p>that evolved by itself in nature.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you see that translation</p>
<p>is a fundamentally, like, intelligent mechanism.</p>
<p>In its own way, and again, if we manage to figure out</p>
<p>how to drive life&rsquo;s evolution,</p>
<p>if it can evolve a sophisticated,</p>
<p>sort of, informatic processing system like this,</p>
<p>you may ask yourself, what might chemical systems</p>
<p>be capable of, independently doing,</p>
<p>under different circumstances?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, like, locally, they&rsquo;re intelligent locally.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need the rest of the shebang.</p>
<p>Like, they don&rsquo;t need the big picture.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s a great segue</p>
<p>into what makes this biological, right?</p>
<p>The heart of the cellular activities are translation.</p>
<p>You kill translation, you kill the cell.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Not only the translation itself,</p>
<p>you kill the component that initiates it,</p>
<p>you kill the cell.</p>
<p>You remove the component that elongates it,</p>
<p>you kill the cell.</p>
<p>So, there are many different ways to disrupt this machinery.</p>
<p>All the parts are important.</p>
<p>Now, it can vary across different organisms.</p>
<p>We see variation between bacteria</p>
<p>versus eukaryotes versus archaea, right?</p>
<p>So, it is not the same exact steps,</p>
<p>but it can get more crowded</p>
<p>as we get closer to eukaryotes, for instance.</p>
<p>But you are still computing about 20 amino acids per second.</p>
<p>This is what you&rsquo;re generating every second.</p>
<p>That single machinery is doing 20 a second?</p>
<p>21 for bacteria, I believe eight for eukaryotes, or nine.</p>
<p>21 a second.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s super inefficient or super efficient,</p>
<p>depending on how you think about it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I mean, I can actually do nine amino acids.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s way slower than a computer</p>
<p>could generate through simulation.</p>
<p>I think, if you can show me a computer that does this,</p>
<p>we are done here.</p>
<p>Well, this is the big, this includes the five things,</p>
<p>not just, but I could show you a computer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing the informatic, right?</p>
<p>Yes, you can show me that,</p>
<p>but you cannot show me the one that has all.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>I will ask you about probably alpha fold, right?</p>
<p>I think the more we learn about,</p>
<p>and this is why early life and origin</p>
<p>is also very fascinating and applicable</p>
<p>to many different disciplines.</p>
<p>There is no way you see this the way we just described it,</p>
<p>unless you think about early life and early geochemistry</p>
<p>and earliest emergent systems.</p>
<p>But going back to the biological component,</p>
<p>all of these attributes that we think about life</p>
<p>or that we associate with biology</p>
<p>stems from translation and as well as metabolism.</p>
<p>But I see metabolism as a way to keep translation going</p>
<p>and translation keeps metabolism going.</p>
<p>But translation is arguably a bit more sophisticated process</p>
<p>for the reasons that I just described.</p>
<p>So metabolism is a source of energy</p>
<p>for this translation process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to process materials</p>
<p>and it is inherently dynamic and it is flexible,</p>
<p>but it is not focused on reputation as translation does.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the main difference.</p>
<p>Translation is the kind of in a way,</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s repeats, right?</p>
<p>So you have the metabolism that can synthesize materials,</p>
<p>creates or benefits from available energy.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s a dynamic system.</p>
<p>And then you have computation</p>
<p>that is inherently repetitive, right?</p>
<p>Needs to carry out repetitive processes.</p>
<p>And it does the tasks and it implements an algorithm,</p>
<p>but it is not dynamic.</p>
<p>So you see both of those attributes</p>
<p>in translation combined.</p>
<p>It is repetitive and it is dynamic</p>
<p>and it also processes this information.</p>
<p>So they are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can get life</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t find a way</p>
<p>to process the information around you.</p>
<p>In a repetitive dynamic way.</p>
<p>Yeah, and somehow that&rsquo;s what got selected,</p>
<p>maybe not selected.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was accidental,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what it seems to be conserved</p>
<p>for four billion years,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what life established.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the connection between translation</p>
<p>and the self-replication,</p>
<p>which seems to be another weird thing</p>
<p>that life just started doing,</p>
<p>wanting to just replicate itself?</p>
<p>I think when we truly understand</p>
<p>the answer to that question,</p>
<p>we may have just made ourselves life, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we know quite how translation machinery</p>
<p>as a whole fits into equation.</p>
<p>So we try to understand ribosomes, RNA,</p>
<p>how the linear information is processed,</p>
<p>or the genetic code,</p>
<p>why this codons, not others,</p>
<p>why 20, not more, not less.</p>
<p>And we are sort of moving towards translation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we are working on anyway.</p>
<p>To finally look at the patterns</p>
<p>in which this system operates itself.</p>
<p>And if you understand that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really unlocking a very emergent behavior.</p>
<p>One of the things you didn&rsquo;t mention is physical.</p>
<p>Is there something to mention about that component</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a paper published in 2013.</p>
<p>I want to say the first author is Zirnoff.</p>
<p>So they surveyed computational engineered systems level</p>
<p>computational engineered systems level</p>
<p>computation, energy consumption, okay?</p>
<p>And they tried to understand whether the universe</p>
<p>is using its own or life is using its full capacity</p>
<p>of energy consumption.</p>
<p>And whether if different planets in the universe</p>
<p>had life with the capacity would increase or decrease.</p>
<p>Does life operate at its energy maximum?</p>
<p>And they think that it does.</p>
<p>That it actually operates at an efficiency</p>
<p>that is far more above and beyond any computational system.</p>
<p>How is that possible to determine at all?</p>
<p>That you tell me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I dropped the citation.</p>
<p>I found the citation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite an interesting paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit, you know, it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>obviously we can only calculate and infer these things.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question to ask.</p>
<p>Is the life that we see here on earth</p>
<p>and life elsewhere in the universe,</p>
<p>is it using the energy most efficiently?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It seems to be very efficient.</p>
<p>Again, if we compare it to computers,</p>
<p>it seems to be incredibly efficient at using energy.</p>
<p>I think they look at the theoretical optimum</p>
<p>for electronic devices.</p>
<p>And then try to understand where life falls on this.</p>
<p>And life is certainly more efficient.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s ultimately the physical side.</p>
<p>How well are you using for this entire mechanism,</p>
<p>the energy available to you?</p>
<p>And so given all the resilience to errors</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>it seems that it&rsquo;s close to its maximum.</p>
<p>And this paper aside, it does seem that life,</p>
<p>obviously that&rsquo;s the constraint we have on earth, right?</p>
<p>Is the amount of energy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way to define life.</p>
<p>Well, the input is energy.</p>
<p>And the output is what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Self-replicating.</p>
<p>Wait, okay, let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>How do you personally define life?</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite definition</p>
<p>that you try to sneak up on?</p>
<p>Is it possible to define life on earth?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It depends on what you are defining it for.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re defining it for finding different life forms,</p>
<p>then it probably needs to have some quantification in it</p>
<p>so that you can use it in whatever the mission</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re operating to.</p>
<p>Do you mean like it&rsquo;s not binary?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a seven out of 10?</p>
<p>Life-like?</p>
<p>Life-like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that defining is that essential.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good exercise,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure if we need to agree</p>
<p>a universally defined way of understanding life.</p>
<p>Because the definition itself</p>
<p>seems to be ever-evolving anyway, right?</p>
<p>We have the NASA&rsquo;s definition.</p>
<p>It has its minuses and pluses,</p>
<p>but it seems to be doing its job.</p>
<p>Well, what are the different,</p>
<p>if there is a line and it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>or unproductive to define that line,</p>
<p>nevertheless, we know it when we see it</p>
<p>is one definition that the Supreme Court likes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of an important thing</p>
<p>to think about when we look at life on other planets.</p>
<p>So how do we try to identify if a thing is living</p>
<p>when we go to Mars,</p>
<p>when we go to the different moons in our solar system,</p>
<p>when we go outside our solar system</p>
<p>to look for life on other planets?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely to be a sort of smoking gun event, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be, hey, I found this.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think so?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Unless you find an elephant on some exoplanet,</p>
<p>then I can say, yeah, there&rsquo;s life here.</p>
<p>No, but isn&rsquo;t there a dynamic nature to the thing?</p>
<p>Like it moves, it has a membrane</p>
<p>that looks like there&rsquo;s stuff inside.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to move, right?</p>
<p>I mean, like look at plants.</p>
<p>I mean, they grow,</p>
<p>but there are plants that can be also pretty dormant.</p>
<p>And arguably, they do everything</p>
<p>that one of my favorite professors once said,</p>
<p>that a plant does everything</p>
<p>that a giraffe does without moving.</p>
<p>So movement is not necessarily.</p>
<p>A very Zen statement.</p>
<p>But on a certain time scale,</p>
<p>the plant does move, it just moves slower.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It moves pretty quickly and at times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to quantify this or even measure it,</p>
<p>but life is definitely chemistry finding solutions, right?</p>
<p>So it is chemistry exploring itself</p>
<p>and maintaining this exploration for billions of years.</p>
<p>So, okay, so a planet is a bunch of chemistry</p>
<p>and then you run it and say, all right,</p>
<p>figure out what cool stuff you can come up with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what life is.</p>
<p>Given a chemistry,</p>
<p>what is the cool stuff I can come up with?</p>
<p>If that chemistry or the solutions that it embarks upon</p>
<p>are maintained in a form of memory, right?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t just need to have the exploring chemical space,</p>
<p>but you need to also maintain a memory</p>
<p>of some of those solutions for over long periods of time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the memory component makes it more living to me.</p>
<p>Because chemistry can always sample, right?</p>
<p>So chemistry is chemistry,</p>
<p>but are you just constantly sampling</p>
<p>or are you building on your former solutions</p>
<p>and then maintaining a memory of those solutions</p>
<p>over billions of years?</p>
<p>Or at least that&rsquo;s what happened here.</p>
<p>Chemistry can&rsquo;t build life</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s always living in the moment.</p>
<p>The physicists will be very upset with you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So memory could be a fundamental requirement of life.</p>
<p>I mean, life is obviously chemistry and physics</p>
<p>leading to biology.</p>
<p>So this is not a disciplinary problem of one discipline</p>
<p>triumphing other discipline.</p>
<p>But what you need to have is definitely,</p>
<p>chemistry is everywhere, right?</p>
<p>I tend to think you can be a chemist,</p>
<p>you can study chemistry, you can study physics,</p>
<p>you can study geology anywhere in the universe,</p>
<p>but this is the only place you can study biology.</p>
<p>This is the only place to be a biologist.</p>
<p>Earth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So definitely something very fundamental happened here</p>
<p>and you cannot take biology out of the equation.</p>
<p>If you wanna understand how that vast chemistry space,</p>
<p>how that general sequence space got narrowed down</p>
<p>to what is available or what is used by life,</p>
<p>you need to understand the rules of selection.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when evolution and biology comes into play.</p>
<p>So the rules of natural selection operate to you</p>
<p>on the level of biology?</p>
<p>Rules?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there are any rules like that.</p>
<p>It would be fascinating to find</p>
<p>in terms of the biology&rsquo;s rules.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very fascinating area of study now.</p>
<p>And probably we will hear more about that decades to come.</p>
<p>But if you wanna go from the broad to specific,</p>
<p>you need to understand the rules of selection.</p>
<p>And that is gonna come from understanding biology, yes.</p>
<p>Well, actually, let me ask you about selection.</p>
<p>You have a paper on evolutionary stalling</p>
<p>where you describe that evolution&rsquo;s not good at multitasking</p>
<p>or like in populations that evolve quickly.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a very specific thing,</p>
<p>but there could be a generalizable fundamental thing to this</p>
<p>that evolution&rsquo;s not able to improve multiple modules</p>
<p>simultaneously.</p>
<p>I guess the question is what part of the organism</p>
<p>does evolution quote-unquote focus on to improve?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was the driving question.</p>
<p>We meddled with the part where you shouldn&rsquo;t be messing up</p>
<p>with translation.</p>
<p>This is the-</p>
<p>Should or should not?</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>As I said, there are many ways to break it</p>
<p>and all life needs it, so-</p>
<p>One of your favorite things to do</p>
<p>is to break life to see what happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, yeah, because that&rsquo;s how kids learn, right?</p>
<p>So you have to break something and see how it will,</p>
<p>then you do it over and over again</p>
<p>to see if it will fix itself in the same ways.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s our, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most fundamental properties</p>
<p>of ourselves as human beings.</p>
<p>So if we shouldn&rsquo;t break translation,</p>
<p>then we should try to break it to see how it will repair.</p>
<p>So which part did you break?</p>
<p>I broke elongation.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of elongation in this process?</p>
<p>So we have four steps of the translations,</p>
<p>initiate, elongate.</p>
<p>So you elongate the chain of the information chain</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re now creating, the peptide chain,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say broadly polymer chain.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the termination step and there&rsquo;s the recycling.</p>
<p>So all of these steps are carried out by proteins</p>
<p>that are also named after these steps.</p>
<p>Initiation is the initiation factor,</p>
<p>protein elongation is the elongator protein.</p>
<p>We broke elongation.</p>
<p>So the cell, the starting codon could still arrive</p>
<p>to where it&rsquo;s supposed to go,</p>
<p>but the following information couldn&rsquo;t get carried out</p>
<p>because we replaced elongation</p>
<p>with its own ancestral version.</p>
<p>So we inserted roughly a 700 million year old</p>
<p>elongation factor protein</p>
<p>after removing the modern gene.</p>
<p>So we made this ancient modern hybrid organism.</p>
<p>And that essentially creates in some way</p>
<p>the ancient version of that organism.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hybrid organism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily,</p>
<p>because the rest of the cell,</p>
<p>the rest of the genome is still modern.</p>
<p>And that goes back to the difference</p>
<p>between Jurassic Park.</p>
<p>There are many differences, obviously,</p>
<p>given that this is not fiction, we are doing it.</p>
<p>But also we are not necessarily,</p>
<p>I think in Jurassic Park, they are taking an ancient,</p>
<p>they find an ancient organism</p>
<p>and then put a modern gene inside the ancient organism.</p>
<p>In our case, we are still working with what we got,</p>
<p>but putting an ancestral DNA inside the modern organism.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like taking a new car</p>
<p>and putting an old engine into it?</p>
<p>In a way, yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And seeing what happens.</p>
<p>Yes, but in our case, it&rsquo;s more like a transformer</p>
<p>than just a regular car.</p>
<p>It is doing things.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a more complicated organism</p>
<p>than just a car.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>So what does that teach you?</p>
<p>We wanted to understand multiple things.</p>
<p>One is how does the cell respond to perturbation?</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t just put the ancient DNA,</p>
<p>we sampled DNA from currently existing organisms,</p>
<p>so the cousins of this microbe,</p>
<p>and collected DNA sequences from the cousins as well.</p>
<p>So both ancestor and the current cousin DNA, so to speak.</p>
<p>And engineered all of these things to the modern bacteria</p>
<p>and generated a collection of microbes</p>
<p>that either have the ancient component</p>
<p>or the variant elongator component</p>
<p>that still alive today,</p>
<p>but coming from a different part of the tree.</p>
<p>So you broke elongation.</p>
<p>Was that something you did as part of the paper</p>
<p>on evolutionary stalling to try to figure out</p>
<p>how evolution figures out what to try to improve?</p>
<p>Did that help?</p>
<p>Yes, because we were not supposed to</p>
<p>mess with the translation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what we did.</p>
<p>And we altered elongation by changing it</p>
<p>with different versions of elongation</p>
<p>that are either coming from species</p>
<p>that still are around today,</p>
<p>you can imagine them as sitting on the tips of the tree,</p>
<p>near branch, far branch,</p>
<p>to compare to the organism that we&rsquo;re working with,</p>
<p>cousins, distant cousins,</p>
<p>as well as the ancestors of the bacteria</p>
<p>that we are now modifying.</p>
<p>How much different variation is there</p>
<p>in that elongation step?</p>
<p>Like what are the different flavors of elongation?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>So mechanistically or mechanically, it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very conserved.</p>
<p>So all life elongates the same way.</p>
<p>You are, it&rsquo;s nothing but a shuttle.</p>
<p>You just carry a chemical with you,</p>
<p>the bit, to the heart of the machine.</p>
<p>Is that essentially doing like a copy paste operation?</p>
<p>It has its tail that&rsquo;s attached to the code,</p>
<p>which is then carried biochemically to the linear chain,</p>
<p>to the core of ribosome.</p>
<p>And it sits on there, it&rsquo;s released,</p>
<p>and the peptides click, the codes rather click.</p>
<p>Once that chemistry, that the tail end occurs,</p>
<p>the protein leaves the center.</p>
<p>So you can imagine it&rsquo;s like it hops in there and hops out.</p>
<p>And when it hops and hops out,</p>
<p>it leaves the information behind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it does,</p>
<p>is bring the information, get out of there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all triggered by biophysics, biochemistry,</p>
<p>because of the way the enzyme choose energy,</p>
<p>in this case, GTP, how the phosphor leaves the center,</p>
<p>that kicks, that gives the additional kick to the enzyme</p>
<p>to leave the center.</p>
<p>So which parts are different then?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the flavors, different flavors of the location?</p>
<p>Usually the parts that matter don&rsquo;t change over time.</p>
<p>Nature conserves the sites of these proteins</p>
<p>that are important for its job.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a difference, then we wanna know,</p>
<p>especially if there&rsquo;s a difference between two cousins.</p>
<p>And we look at the sites that interact</p>
<p>with the most important parts of this machinery.</p>
<p>If we see any difference, we tend to mutate,</p>
<p>or we revert, we engineer that part, we alter that part,</p>
<p>because it gives us a clue</p>
<p>that there must be something interesting</p>
<p>going on here or not.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s not the fundamental part of the machinery,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s some flavorful characteristic</p>
<p>that you can play with.</p>
<p>So now you stripped the machinery down to its parts,</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re looking at the parts of the parts.</p>
<p>And it depends where you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>and how you&rsquo;re looking and what you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>But usually we see up to 70% level conserved identity</p>
<p>across all modern versions.</p>
<p>When you travel back in time, the identity decreases.</p>
<p>So elongation likely existed.</p>
<p>We have good reason to think that it existed</p>
<p>at the dawn of life.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking at a 3.8 billion year old mechanism.</p>
<p>And when we look at the ancestors that we resurrect,</p>
<p>we see about 40% identity.</p>
<p>So the identity definitely decreases as you go back in time,</p>
<p>but still 60% shared information over 4 billion year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Is that just for elongation or for the entire translation?</p>
<p>Depends on what you do.</p>
<p>So for initiation, we&rsquo;ve also recently published this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>But overall, you see high level of identity</p>
<p>that is kept intact,</p>
<p>especially if the component is essential for life.</p>
<p>Okay, so 40% and 60%, 70% you said.</p>
<p>But like from generation to generation,</p>
<p>how does evolution,</p>
<p>and presumably that&rsquo;s what that paper is looking at,</p>
<p>is the parts of the parts.</p>
<p>How does it able to say, mess with the parts</p>
<p>and try to come up with a cooler,</p>
<p>improved version of the organism?</p>
<p>Yeah, so let me describe to you</p>
<p>what we did in that experiment.</p>
<p>We took bacteria,</p>
<p>we perturbed the elongation in all of these</p>
<p>with different variants.</p>
<p>So we had an initial set of a group of bacteria that we had.</p>
<p>We then subjected these bacteria to evolution in the lab.</p>
<p>So we, first of all, we knew we broke it</p>
<p>because upon engineering,</p>
<p>we measured what&rsquo;s going on with the cell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not growing as well.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not healthy.</p>
<p>We can see it with our eyes, we can measure it.</p>
<p>That if they were generating an offspring,</p>
<p>now it is 40 minutes, right?</p>
<p>So we really messed them up.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to work with this thing.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want each other, but they need each other.</p>
<p>So we created that situation for them,</p>
<p>which is good because we wanted to see</p>
<p>how they will cooperate with each other</p>
<p>to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Because we know that that&rsquo;s not the condition</p>
<p>that they want to live in,</p>
<p>especially when they know what they can do.</p>
<p>So with that, we subjected these organisms</p>
<p>to evolution in the lab.</p>
<p>We refer to this as experimental evolution.</p>
<p>We subject bacteria to different selection pressure,</p>
<p>project them through bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Every day, we randomly collect a handful of bacteria</p>
<p>from the flask, put them in a new fresh environment</p>
<p>with fresh food,</p>
<p>keep them in this environment for 24 hours</p>
<p>until they reach a more dormant state,</p>
<p>and then we introduce them to a new environment.</p>
<p>So we repeated this for about, I will say, 150 days.</p>
<p>So every day, nonstop, we repeated this experiment.</p>
<p>So how many different kinds of environments are there?</p>
<p>We kept the environments to the same,</p>
<p>because we had different initial conditions.</p>
<p>We kept the environment constant.</p>
<p>Same temperature, same food, same source of carbon.</p>
<p>But we created replicates for each lineage.</p>
<p>So in some ways, we created our own fossil record</p>
<p>in the lab by evolving and generating these flasks.</p>
<p>And every step of the way, we also froze these cells</p>
<p>and took stocks of them in the cryo-freezer.</p>
<p>How long does it take to go from one generation</p>
<p>to the next in bacteria?</p>
<p>If you, for E. coli, it&rsquo;s usually 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the experiment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the experiment.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re always messing with it in the same way</p>
<p>for the initial condition?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same way.</p>
<p>So we introduced variation at the elongation level,</p>
<p>because we perturbed it with different elongations.</p>
<p>We found that if we introduce a different protein</p>
<p>that is very different, the cells don&rsquo;t like that, right?</p>
<p>So if the distance is larger, the consequence is also large,</p>
<p>meaning that you hit them harder.</p>
<p>If you introduce a variant that is really foreign to them,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really distant.</p>
<p>In our case, it was the ancestor.</p>
<p>They really did not like the ancestor,</p>
<p>but they were okay with their nearest cousin.</p>
<p>Right, okay, great.</p>
<p>So you did vary in the distance.</p>
<p>We varied the evolutionary distance,</p>
<p>and then we kept the experimental conditions the same,</p>
<p>and we propagated these populations every day</p>
<p>for 150 days.</p>
<p>And we collected bacteria every step of the way</p>
<p>and looked at the sequence.</p>
<p>We wanted to understand what sort of changes</p>
<p>may have happened in the genome</p>
<p>to respond to the variation that we&rsquo;ve introduced.</p>
<p>So what kind of changes would you be seeing</p>
<p>depending on the evolutionary distance</p>
<p>of the thing you shoved into it?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So we knew where we punched, right?</p>
<p>We punched right at the heart, right?</p>
<p>We punched the translation.</p>
<p>So we expected, is it gonna be, is it translation?</p>
<p>Are we gonna see a change?</p>
<p>Will translation respond to this</p>
<p>by fixing itself right away?</p>
<p>Or will it be another, outside of translation,</p>
<p>something completely different, a different module?</p>
<p>Because translation itself is a module.</p>
<p>Or will it be within elongation,</p>
<p>a really sub-protein level thing?</p>
<p>So we had a strategy to identify the mutational pathways</p>
<p>by categorizing what we expected to find or where.</p>
<p>Okay, so why does it not do multitasking?</p>
<p>Why is it not improving multiple things simultaneously?</p>
<p>It turned out that what we observed in general</p>
<p>is that first of all, the harder we hit the cells,</p>
<p>the more likely they were to respond by changes</p>
<p>right at where we hit it.</p>
<p>When you say hit it,</p>
<p>you mean like changing something about the elongation?</p>
<p>I like to think of it as hitting,</p>
<p>because I like to think of it as breaking the cell, right?</p>
<p>I mean, not breaking enough to kill it,</p>
<p>but we still, because they&rsquo;re still alive,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not doing their job well.</p>
<p>So the bigger the evolutionary distance</p>
<p>of the thing you put in there,</p>
<p>the harder the hit is how you think about it?</p>
<p>The bigger the hammer?</p>
<p>Bigger the hammer, exactly.</p>
<p>That you hit it with, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it turned out to be,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what the data told us,</p>
<p>that if the variation is higher,</p>
<p>then the consequences will also be higher</p>
<p>in the sense that the cells will not grow as healthy</p>
<p>compared to a variant that is coming from a near,</p>
<p>or a variant that is coming</p>
<p>from a near evolutionary distance.</p>
<p>Is it wrong to think of this kind of hitting</p>
<p>as akin to a mutation, or no?</p>
<p>What are we supposed to learn from this hitting?</p>
<p>Like how the thing evolves after it&rsquo;s being hit in this way?</p>
<p>What does that teach us?</p>
<p>Because we see translation machinery</p>
<p>as almost, it is so conserved and so essential.</p>
<p>It is not even clear whether we can remove some of the parts</p>
<p>or whether the entire translation will need</p>
<p>all of the same parts in the same efficiency.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand the rules of this machinery.</p>
<p>So the first thing we understand is that,</p>
<p>what is the resilience?</p>
<p>What are we really talking about here</p>
<p>when we talk about you cannot mess with this translation?</p>
<p>Is this true?</p>
<p>Because it is so conserved and so similar</p>
<p>and functions in the most conserved ways.</p>
<p>That was the first thing that we wanted to understand.</p>
<p>Did you learn anything interesting about the resilience</p>
<p>at the chemical, physical, informatic,</p>
<p>computational, biological?</p>
<p>No, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>I think the biological level, yes,</p>
<p>because we found that the different modules</p>
<p>started responding to the changes that we&rsquo;ve introduced</p>
<p>and that we could never recover the translation</p>
<p>as effectively as it used to be.</p>
<p>So that it never reached to,</p>
<p>it is optimality, that it was always suboptimal.</p>
<p>It needed, say, one more mutation perhaps to get there.</p>
<p>It accumulated four mutations that was,</p>
<p>we did a lot of experiments to understand this, of course.</p>
<p>It was accumulating mutations.</p>
<p>It was getting better at its task.</p>
<p>Maybe it needed a couple other mutations</p>
<p>to get really good at it,</p>
<p>but somehow those mutations never happened.</p>
<p>And before those mutations happened,</p>
<p>we saw another module emerging through mutations</p>
<p>and getting better at its own different task</p>
<p>that is not translation.</p>
<p>You can think of cell as a web of networks, right?</p>
<p>And we think of this as multiple, almost airports</p>
<p>that are proteins that are more central hubs</p>
<p>versus their proteins that maybe are not as important hub.</p>
<p>If you introduce a problem in the most populated hub,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna mess up the traffic system more drastically.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we were messing with</p>
<p>in the biological terms as well.</p>
<p>So when we say module,</p>
<p>like translation would be one of the modules.</p>
<p>Translation would be one.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically saying when you mess with translation,</p>
<p>the organism would choose to either try to fix that module</p>
<p>or another module, depending.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But it wouldn&rsquo;t do multiple modules.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t do multiple modules.</p>
<p>It focused on one module at a time.</p>
<p>And right before that module maybe reached</p>
<p>to its own maximum, it stalled its optimality</p>
<p>at a certain degree.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d never get to a degree that is more optimal</p>
<p>than you can achieve,</p>
<p>even though perhaps another mutation could get you there.</p>
<p>Since you messed with the translation,</p>
<p>from a sort of optimal perspective,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it make sense for the cell</p>
<p>to try to start fixing the translation?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what we thought.</p>
<p>And it was not the case</p>
<p>for all the broken translation missionaries.</p>
<p>For instance, if the variant was coming</p>
<p>from a near ancestor, that didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>It was almost cruising around,</p>
<p>trying different modules</p>
<p>and sort of living its best life still without,</p>
<p>because there is no real urgency in the system</p>
<p>to fix the most important problem.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also not a direction.</p>
<p>Maybe to you, it&rsquo;s obvious that&rsquo;s the problem,</p>
<p>but to the cell, maybe you&rsquo;re the problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m living, like you said, my best life.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess that&rsquo;s the thing about evolution</p>
<p>is we don&rsquo;t know what the right direction to-</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s almost like you can imagine</p>
<p>that you have this messy closet</p>
<p>and you can-</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>Happens to be an accurate representation of my life.</p>
<p>So you take a look at it</p>
<p>and you see all the sweaters or jeans all over the place.</p>
<p>And then you look at a drawer</p>
<p>that has socks coming out of it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d think that&rsquo;s the most important one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna fix that one.</p>
<p>And then you fix that one.</p>
<p>And then you think you will get to the other one,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t, because you just fix the most important one.</p>
<p>That is the, whatever that was getting into your way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what evolution is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite lazy.</p>
<p>It fixes the problem that seems to be the most immediate</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t go beyond what it really needs to.</p>
<p>It seems like at least for our experimental setup,</p>
<p>that was the case.</p>
<p>Especially for rapidly evolving systems.</p>
<p>So like, or is the environment they&rsquo;re operating</p>
<p>in pretty constrained?</p>
<p>Like, is there urgency?</p>
<p>I would say that we definitely constrain the environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely removed from their natural setup.</p>
<p>We are not evolving them in a gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very homogeneous system,</p>
<p>very controlled temperature, controlled food,</p>
<p>controlled carbon.</p>
<p>So just looking at that, let me ask the romantic question.</p>
<p>How did evolution create so much beautiful,</p>
<p>complex variety on earth?</p>
<p>Like from that, you&rsquo;re saying that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about improving different modules,</p>
<p>but if we step back and look at the entirety of the tree</p>
<p>of the different organisms that created</p>
<p>all throughout history, the stuff that&rsquo;s fun to you</p>
<p>with the first few billion and the stuff that&rsquo;s fun to me</p>
<p>when I watch on YouTube, which is like the lion</p>
<p>versus gorilla fights and so on.</p>
<p>But the whole thing is fun.</p>
<p>So with all that beautiful variety from the predator</p>
<p>and the prey, from the self-replicating bacteria</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff, how did it do it?</p>
<p>How is a very difficult question,</p>
<p>especially when we don&rsquo;t understand the past</p>
<p>with clarity at all.</p>
<p>I can tell you that there seems to be very critical</p>
<p>innovations that happened throughout the history of life</p>
<p>that are each themselves very sophisticated singularities</p>
<p>that emerged once and then they set the tone.</p>
<p>One of which is emergence of translation.</p>
<p>It seems like it happened once.</p>
<p>It had to happen once.</p>
<p>Seems like that&rsquo;s all it took.</p>
<p>3.8 billion year, maybe older.</p>
<p>Clearly subjected to a lot of chemical evolution</p>
<p>even prior to last universal common ancestor.</p>
<p>And then you jump and you see emergence of cyanobacteria</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s undeniably changed the course of those planets</p>
<p>in the subsequent aerobic photosynthesis that&rsquo;s life learned.</p>
<p>How to utilize what&rsquo;s available in the environment</p>
<p>in the most profound way.</p>
<p>And then you move forward, you see the emergence</p>
<p>of eukaryotes, endosymbiosis, also another singular event.</p>
<p>And then you move forward and then comes the plants.</p>
<p>So these are, I counted I think six different things</p>
<p>that seems to have happened just once.</p>
<p>And the singularity events in the history of evolution</p>
<p>of life on earth.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s really fascinating here is that there seems</p>
<p>to be two different courses, the time course.</p>
<p>Evolution is operating at the molecular level, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about seconds.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about mutations that happen every second.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about selection</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also happening under a minute, right?</p>
<p>So that is a very fast process.</p>
<p>The fact that I can evolve bacteria in a lab</p>
<p>and I say almost complainingly,</p>
<p>oh my goodness, it took me 150 days.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s pretty rapid for a change to be seen.</p>
<p>But then the big changes and the ones that I&rsquo;m talking,</p>
<p>the really big innovations that caused an increase</p>
<p>of oxygen on this planet or even its own mere presence</p>
<p>are due to these molecular innovations.</p>
<p>Seems to only happen a handful of times</p>
<p>over billions of years of timescale.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this question having to do</p>
<p>with my half-asleep tweet.</p>
<p>So saying that we all originated from one common ancestor,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just one of the miraculous things</p>
<p>about life on Earth.</p>
<p>Of course, you could say there&rsquo;s multiple common ancestors</p>
<p>in the beginning, multiple organisms and so on,</p>
<p>but the other stuff that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is these singular events, these leaps of invention</p>
<p>throughout evolutionary history.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a bunch of people who were commenting,</p>
<p>a bit surprising to me,</p>
<p>who were basically skeptical of this idea.</p>
<p>The idea of?</p>
<p>Well, I would say evolution, honestly,</p>
<p>the process of evolution,</p>
<p>but when you just actually focus in on like holy crap,</p>
<p>eukaryotes were invented,</p>
<p>holy crap, photosynthesis was invented.</p>
<p>Those are incredible inventions.</p>
<p>And also, if we can even go to Homo sapiens,</p>
<p>the intelligence, like where did that come from?</p>
<p>These mysteries.</p>
<p>I think where that skeptical comments were coming from</p>
<p>were also just the general skepticism of science.</p>
<p>I think from the pandemic,</p>
<p>people, maybe a failure of institutions and so on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a growing distrust of science.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not so much that it&rsquo;s anti-evolution,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of a stepping back and saying, wait a minute,</p>
<p>maybe scientists don&rsquo;t have it all figured out.</p>
<p>And I think to Steel Man,</p>
<p>that case is almost a step back into realize</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much mystery to each of these leaps.</p>
<p>So it makes you wonder,</p>
<p>is there something that in 100, 200 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll figure out that we totally don&rsquo;t understand yet?</p>
<p>Like some, you know, there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I talked to a bunch of people about another mystery,</p>
<p>which is consciousness, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s people called panpsychics</p>
<p>who believe consciousness</p>
<p>is one of the fundamental laws of the universe.</p>
<p>So there could be, you know, like we have laws of physics,</p>
<p>that could be something that&rsquo;s like a consciousness field</p>
<p>or something that permeates all matter.</p>
<p>And so like there might be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like Newtonian physics</p>
<p>versus general relativity.</p>
<p>Like we have a good understanding of how things happen,</p>
<p>but we need another layer of understanding</p>
<p>to fill in the gaps of the mysteries of it all.</p>
<p>And that sort of is a sobering reality</p>
<p>that maybe there is something</p>
<p>we really deeply don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of where the biggest mysteries here are?</p>
<p>Is it the origin of life itself?</p>
<p>Is it the leaps that we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>So you see the beauty,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fascinated about the translation mechanism.</p>
<p>What are the deep mysteries there to you?</p>
<p>We are nothing but chemical systems</p>
<p>capable of formulating or answering questions</p>
<p>about our own existence.</p>
<p>We humans or all of life, you think?</p>
<p>I mean, no, no.</p>
<p>Humans are, I mean, the fact that we can,</p>
<p>we even have this conversation</p>
<p>about our place in the universe is,</p>
<p>at least to our knowledge,</p>
<p>is quite specific to our own chemical species.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of wild.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re introspecting on our evolutionary history</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just a couple of organisms.</p>
<p>Yes, and we&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like another organism listening to this</p>
<p>and like they&rsquo;re mind blown.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like three organisms,</p>
<p>two of them talking and the third one&rsquo;s like, holy shit.</p>
<p>I think that understanding the,</p>
<p>what I really find interesting</p>
<p>about understanding origin of life</p>
<p>or even contemplating about our own place in the universe,</p>
<p>if at the end of this would come down to appreciating</p>
<p>or even before appreciating,</p>
<p>really truly comprehending what it is that we got here,</p>
<p>that to me is a huge gain</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no single question in biology,</p>
<p>I think, that will give that,</p>
<p>that will deliver that magnitude</p>
<p>of that message and understanding,</p>
<p>but understanding how life here started at first place,</p>
<p>if we truly comprehend that.</p>
<p>This is not a concept that is well thought in schools.</p>
<p>We ask students to memorize these concepts.</p>
<p>If they are lucky, they learned RNA world,</p>
<p>chicken and egg problem, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the extent to which that got,</p>
<p>maybe their biology teacher</p>
<p>was personally interested in the subject matter,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>You know the saying that the brains are evenly distributed</p>
<p>across any metric you can imagine,</p>
<p>but opportunities are not.</p>
<p>So if people aren&rsquo;t understanding the importance of this</p>
<p>is because that&rsquo;s a lack of opportunity right there,</p>
<p>that was skipped through the proper education and training</p>
<p>in the delivery of why science matters</p>
<p>or how science actually works.</p>
<p>Yeah, but how do you even begin to seriously think</p>
<p>about the origin of life?</p>
<p>I mean, every problem of existence of life has its time.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s time to understand consciousness yet.</p>
<p>We might be 100 years away from that.</p>
<p>The origin of life, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>for us to understand that yet.</p>
<p>Maybe we need to solve so many more problems along the way.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a competition of problems, right?</p>
<p>So there are all kinds of problems</p>
<p>and it takes a lot of people to make the world.</p>
<p>So you will always have some interesting brain</p>
<p>going after an interesting problem to their own.</p>
<p>The issue here is that we need to, first of all,</p>
<p>understand that what we have going on on this planet</p>
<p>is pretty good.</p>
<p>Good planets are hard to find.</p>
<p>If we are alone in the universe, that&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>We need to take care of what we got here.</p>
<p>And we are incredibly vulnerable to the changes</p>
<p>that our own species also helped create</p>
<p>at the biosphere, at the ecosystem level.</p>
<p>We take it for granted.</p>
<p>We take what we created for granted</p>
<p>because of the fact that we think we are some sort</p>
<p>of ultimate end point, the most sophisticated,</p>
<p>amazing thing that nature could generate.</p>
<p>I think understanding, not even understanding,</p>
<p>but asking these questions of where did this even come from?</p>
<p>How did this even begin?</p>
<p>And attempting to understand that using chemistry</p>
<p>and physics and biology, and because we can,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the ultimate gift we can give back</p>
<p>to the entire species on this planet.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s humbling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humbling to realize the complexity</p>
<p>of this whole mechanism.</p>
<p>It certainly puts humans in their proper perspective.</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re not, just because we have brains</p>
<p>and brains are intelligent doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the most intelligent thing,</p>
<p>because ultimately the whole mechanism of nature</p>
<p>seems to be orders of magnitude more intelligent.</p>
<p>All of it, like we&rsquo;re a bunch,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like a hierarchy of organisms</p>
<p>that have a history of several billion years,</p>
<p>and that all somehow came together to make a human.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ll be life after us,</p>
<p>just as it was life before us.</p>
<p>And something that comes after</p>
<p>will be perhaps even more fascinating.</p>
<p>I think when you understand the magnitude</p>
<p>of what happened here, there is no room for arrogance.</p>
<p>It should overwhelm you and humiliate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty humiliating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s quite amazing what happened here.</p>
<p>And there is no other discipline that will deliver that,</p>
<p>but exploring our own origins</p>
<p>and looking at life as a more planetary system phenomena</p>
<p>rather than one single species at a time,</p>
<p>a collective look.</p>
<p>You mentioned this question in your TED Talk,</p>
<p>is the two possibilities of the universe being full of life</p>
<p>and the universe being empty</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re the only life in the universe.</p>
<p>How do you feel about both options?</p>
<p>Just actually you as a single chemical organism</p>
<p>introspecting about its existence in this world.</p>
<p>Having a planet flow of life is interesting</p>
<p>because we talked about life being all about chemistry,</p>
<p>exploring solutions,</p>
<p>and having solutions in front of you is great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beneficial, right?</p>
<p>Solutions being different organisms.</p>
<p>Like other humans, you see them as the solutions</p>
<p>to a chemistry problem.</p>
<p>Different, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s an interesting solution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, next time we&rsquo;re in Austin,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a bunch of weirdos.</p>
<p>Every time I see a weirdo, I&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s an interesting solution</p>
<p>to this chemistry problem.</p>
<p>Now you think like an origin of life science.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny that that one worked out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see where else it goes.</p>
<p>But having this emptiness and unpredictability</p>
<p>of uncovering a novel solution</p>
<p>can also have its own benefits.</p>
<p>And we should be open to what other solutions</p>
<p>might be out there and exploring those solutions.</p>
<p>Oh, to different chemistry problems.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you see.</p>
<p>You see the other planets out there</p>
<p>as different chemistry problems.</p>
<p>To their own local environment, yes.</p>
<p>So how many chemistry problems have solutions</p>
<p>that are lifelike to you out there in the universe?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wide open palette, if you think about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, we know the chemistry is chemistry.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the chemistry will be different elsewhere.</p>
<p>But again, what is selected by chemistry</p>
<p>will be determined by the environment most likely.</p>
<p>See, I think there is life everywhere out there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a guy named Nick Lane</p>
<p>whose gut, and it&rsquo;s interesting to me,</p>
<p>I wonder what you think about it,</p>
<p>his gut is there&rsquo;s life everywhere out there,</p>
<p>but it stops at the bacteria stage.</p>
<p>So he says the eukaryotes is the biggest invention</p>
<p>and the hardest one.</p>
<p>I wonder if he thinks that&rsquo;s an accidental outcome,</p>
<p>if he thinks that&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>I wonder what that means.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a likely possibility</p>
<p>that the bacterial or microbial life</p>
<p>is definitely more attainable.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a weird world where our entire galaxy</p>
<p>just has bacteria everywhere.</p>
<p>So you know, if you don&rsquo;t like microbes,</p>
<p>you are on the wrong planet.</p>
<p>I know, yeah, and viruses.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which one there&rsquo;s more of,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re both, and most of them are productive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fascinating, they do everything for us.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like microbes, you&rsquo;re on the wrong planet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re full of good lines.</p>
<p>Okay, right, right.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s like an imperative to the whole thing.</p>
<p>To me, the origin is the hard question.</p>
<p>But once it gets going, I just don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s constantly creating</p>
<p>more intelligent things,</p>
<p>more fascinating, complex things</p>
<p>that are able to solve complicated problems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting,</p>
<p>I definitely agree that the initial steps</p>
<p>may be the ultimate determinants,</p>
<p>that once it&rsquo;s, you cannot stop it once it starts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, right?</p>
<p>And I just have never unearthed,</p>
<p>maybe, but maybe, I just, whenever I see life,</p>
<p>it seems to flourish everywhere.</p>
<p>The thing is, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the only thing I haven&rsquo;t seen is the start of it.</p>
<p>Exactly, but, and how are we gonna understand it</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t know the origin of life science?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the, and the question here</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t exactly our ability to recapitulate</p>
<p>everything that happened in the exact way</p>
<p>that it happened, right?</p>
<p>This is about what can happen, rather than,</p>
<p>or maybe how it can happen.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s possible to study</p>
<p>the origin of language using English?</p>
<p>So, like, there&rsquo;s a very particular chemistry here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a particular set of assumptions,</p>
<p>understanding about what life is,</p>
<p>what everything is, our perception of reality</p>
<p>is very specifically constructed</p>
<p>through the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to get to some first principles,</p>
<p>deep understanding of how life originates</p>
<p>in such a way that you can actually</p>
<p>construct it on other planets.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it feels like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing it in a lab on Earth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always going to be using</p>
<p>some aspect of the life that&rsquo;s already here.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s what I sort of talked about in my talk as well.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Everyone should go watch the TED Talks, very good.</p>
<p>The annoying thing to me about TED Talks,</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s by design, is they&rsquo;re too short.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, come on.</p>
<p>And did you know that there&rsquo;s no prompter involved?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, wait, there is?</p>
<p>Or there isn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to memorize stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, and thanks to my amazing editor</p>
<p>who probably is watching this too, David Bielo,</p>
<p>that it was very, very helpful.</p>
<p>But I would say that-</p>
<p>Very professional organization.</p>
<p>I like this podcast, it&rsquo;s a very professional organization.</p>
<p>I respect that medium.</p>
<p>Yeah, anyway, in the TED Talk about, yeah, life,</p>
<p>life creating life.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s a likely scenario that once we understand</p>
<p>how life as a chemical system is capable</p>
<p>of formulating its own expression and generating a memory</p>
<p>and manages its existence on a planetary body,</p>
<p>for billions of years,</p>
<p>once we understand what conditions gave rise to that,</p>
<p>we may be very likely to understand</p>
<p>whether a different planet also be likely</p>
<p>to instigate its own chemical revolution</p>
<p>if it was provided through some missing ingredients.</p>
<p>You can think of it as sending fertilizer</p>
<p>to a different planet that is missing</p>
<p>its own chemical composition or lacking</p>
<p>or that it needs more of what it has.</p>
<p>The difference between making that planet Earth-like,</p>
<p>which was, this is not what that&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about terraforming</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re not talking about turning that planet</p>
<p>into Earth-like system.</p>
<p>We are talking about first understanding that planet,</p>
<p>studying its chemistry, studying its properties</p>
<p>well enough to understand whether it is close</p>
<p>to its own chemical revolution</p>
<p>and maybe giving it that extra nudge.</p>
<p>So, this is obviously a pretty big speculation</p>
<p>and suggestion and it&rsquo;s a very interesting proposition</p>
<p>because this is a yes or no question, right?</p>
<p>This is the ultimate would you rather.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, and I think it says a lot about the perception</p>
<p>of the person who&rsquo;s answering this question,</p>
<p>that if the answer is no, no, no, absolutely not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something we wanna do.</p>
<p>I wanna know why that is the case.</p>
<p>So, just to be clear, what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is looking at the chemical cocktail of a particular planet</p>
<p>and having like tasting it and seeing what&rsquo;s missing.</p>
<p>So, having a very systematic, rigorous,</p>
<p>scientific process for understanding what is missing.</p>
<p>Not what is missing in terms of to make it Earth-like,</p>
<p>but what is missing in order to be sufficiently,</p>
<p>have the spark or the capacity of the spark</p>
<p>to launch the evolution revolution,</p>
<p>the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Exactly, so.</p>
<p>And then the question is,</p>
<p>do we want to then complete the cocktail?</p>
<p>The proposition is to also make us think</p>
<p>that we will likely have this capacity at some point,</p>
<p>especially when we understand origin of life</p>
<p>better and better, right?</p>
<p>So, we will be asking ourselves this question.</p>
<p>I guess I wanted to bring this to daylight a little bit</p>
<p>because maybe in 10, 20 years, maybe more.</p>
<p>So, you wanted to ask the ethical question,</p>
<p>should we basically start life elsewhere on another planet?</p>
<p>Or enable the chemical capacity of that planet</p>
<p>that it may one day itself get there?</p>
<p>Okay, so for me, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>So, if you were to try to argue against my yes,</p>
<p>what would you say?</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the worst that can happen</p>
<p>if we seed another planet with life?</p>
<p>What are the things we should think about?</p>
<p>Is your main concern a chemical biological one</p>
<p>or is it an ethical one?</p>
<p>What do you think about?</p>
<p>Well, the worst thing that can happen</p>
<p>is that it wouldn&rsquo;t work, right?</p>
<p>So, that it&rsquo;s not likely that an attempt like this would work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably, because how do you-</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>You gotta be very, you have to have an understanding</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think we have just yet.</p>
<p>I see, because if it doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>then we could try again, right?</p>
<p>To me, the worst case, the thing I would be worried about</p>
<p>is we create life.</p>
<p>I mean, the same stuff I worry about like with plants</p>
<p>or is things that might have a conscious experience.</p>
<p>And then the dark aspect of life is life</p>
<p>is increasingly complex life.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m anthropomorphizing,</p>
<p>but it seems to have the capacity to suffer.</p>
<p>And so, we&rsquo;re creating something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you have children,</p>
<p>you put creatures into this world that will suffer,</p>
<p>can suffer, and may suffer,</p>
<p>depending on how you view life, may likely suffer.</p>
<p>And so, now you carry this responsibility</p>
<p>for doing your best to alleviate any suffering</p>
<p>that might go through.</p>
<p>And that, perhaps it&rsquo;s romanticizing this notion of life.</p>
<p>Perhaps bacteria are not capable of suffering,</p>
<p>but perhaps it&rsquo;ll create more complex life forms</p>
<p>that would be able to suffer.</p>
<p>And that feels like a responsibility as well.</p>
<p>Of course, other people would be concerned.</p>
<p>The more obvious concern is like,</p>
<p>well, you just created a life form.</p>
<p>How do you know it&rsquo;s not gonna be a super deadly virus</p>
<p>that somehow is able to hurt humans?</p>
<p>Yeah, my concern is more,</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s a solvable problem.</p>
<p>The problem of creating conscious beings</p>
<p>that are able to suffer, that&rsquo;s a tricky one.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see why, because it goes back to, again,</p>
<p>would we, first of all, do we have a responsibility</p>
<p>to propagate more of this chemistry</p>
<p>that we have on this planet elsewhere?</p>
<p>Given that we know ultimately we will be vanished</p>
<p>by the entire planet.</p>
<p>And if this is, in fact, a very rare chemical event</p>
<p>that happens because all the right circumstances</p>
<p>came together and we were the lucky one,</p>
<p>do we have a responsibility to sponsor it?</p>
<p>If we were to back up-</p>
<p>Sponsor, I like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good way to put it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If we try to back up remnants of our civilization, right?</p>
<p>So we wanna potentially create conditions</p>
<p>on the different planets so that humans can survive,</p>
<p>given that we know, or we want to,</p>
<p>just for the sake of growing.</p>
<p>Yeah, propagating, becoming a multi-planetary species.</p>
<p>Exactly, but what really is at stake here,</p>
<p>is actually, or what is really more interesting</p>
<p>is what we don&rsquo;t see, which is the, again,</p>
<p>the chemical behavior that enabled everything</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s different than sending potato crops</p>
<p>or engineering bacteria to live on a different planet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really stripping it down to what is,</p>
<p>what is possible at the chemical level.</p>
<p>So even if you are instigating the chemistry</p>
<p>on different planets,</p>
<p>you are letting that very planet to do its thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not necessarily contaminating this planet</p>
<p>with different chemistry,</p>
<p>because the idea behind this,</p>
<p>at least the way I thought about,</p>
<p>is that you understand that planet,</p>
<p>you understand the conditions,</p>
<p>you understand the chemistry of the planet really well</p>
<p>before choosing the planet as a candidate at first place.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s not about sending a missing ingredient per se,</p>
<p>but again, just sending more of what it already has.</p>
<p>That will be respecting that planet&rsquo;s condition too.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not suggesting any occupation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting any colonization.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting any, like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just strip everything and make everything Earth-like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about empowering that place.</p>
<p>What you are saying is likely to be</p>
<p>the motivator behind all this that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>because I see suffering, I see pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I think this is a question that really reveals</p>
<p>a lot about the person who&rsquo;s answering it.</p>
<p>Well, okay, so the pushback on my pushback.</p>
<p>If I saw him deeply troubled by suffering,</p>
<p>then I should be probably paralyzed</p>
<p>about the history of life on Earth.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Can you elaborate, what do you mean?</p>
<p>Most of life who&rsquo;s ever lived,</p>
<p>suffered in ways that are almost unimaginable to me.</p>
<p>You mean, like, our own species?</p>
<p>Our own species and before, and animals living today.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not even talking about factory farms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just animals living in extreme poverty in the jungle.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, people think like in the natural environment,</p>
<p>animals live in a happy place.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a brutal place of desperately trying to survive,</p>
<p>of desperately trying to look for food.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like all of that life, that&rsquo;s just mammals.</p>
<p>And we understand mammals, but like throughout</p>
<p>like trillions of organisms that led up to those mammals</p>
<p>and the organisms living everywhere,</p>
<p>like even bacteria, there&rsquo;s death everywhere.</p>
<p>So maybe this idea of death,</p>
<p>this idea of suffering is actually,</p>
<p>this thing that we see as a bug is actually a feature.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think suffering is a linear property</p>
<p>like that with life.</p>
<p>And I may be with Nick Lane on this one,</p>
<p>that the likeliness of anything similar</p>
<p>to what we got here evolving in another planetary body,</p>
<p>I think is quite low.</p>
<p>Where would you say is the biggest unlikely thing?</p>
<p>Do you mean humans,</p>
<p>or do you mean even multicellular organisms?</p>
<p>Probably multicellular, but I understand</p>
<p>both sides of the equation, right?</p>
<p>In one level I can see that we may not have any other choice</p>
<p>but to back up this chemistry somewhere else.</p>
<p>So you would be saving, it&rsquo;s the ultimate saving</p>
<p>or our own record.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about, yes, let&rsquo;s also save</p>
<p>Beatles and all the amazing songs,</p>
<p>but this would be the ultimate repository of life.</p>
<p>But I can also see your point of view for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So like, don&rsquo;t seed a plan with a missing ingredient.</p>
<p>Try to understand what the ingredients it has.</p>
<p>Is it possible to construct life?</p>
<p>For me, from a computer person,</p>
<p>it just feels like something</p>
<p>that could be solved computationally.</p>
<p>We can learn from the mistakes that we&rsquo;ve done here</p>
<p>and aspire not to repeat them.</p>
<p>It is possible.</p>
<p>We do amazing things as humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of suffering,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a lot of beauty.</p>
<p>And we could choose what we want to be</p>
<p>or what we want to see, right?</p>
<p>So these attempts don&rsquo;t need not to come from,</p>
<p>need not to come from a place of fear,</p>
<p>but it can be ultimately,</p>
<p>can come from a piece of hope and love.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re just very recently figuring out stuff.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve, even just a century ago,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing atrocities that weren&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>as atrocities at the time.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re learning very quickly</p>
<p>of what is right and wrong.</p>
<p>Yes, and I work with a lot of,</p>
<p>maybe because I&rsquo;m at the university,</p>
<p>I get to teach young people every day,</p>
<p>even at a time of four year or three, few years,</p>
<p>you see generational difference</p>
<p>already unfolding in front of you.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s why I see hope</p>
<p>because I think what we get to interact with in classrooms,</p>
<p>every year, it&rsquo;s just getting better.</p>
<p>They are aware of issues in a way</p>
<p>that I sure wasn&rsquo;t at their age.</p>
<p>Some levels I was, but in many levels I didn&rsquo;t think about.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t concerned of the problems.</p>
<p>Well, they maybe have to be concerned</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hitting the reality, it&rsquo;s hitting them hard,</p>
<p>but younger people are not afraid of these things.</p>
<p>An 18 year old can face these brutal facts</p>
<p>about the planet in ways</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think any other generation before them did.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s super cool.</p>
<p>And like the, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these cool technologies</p>
<p>that aid in the process of a human being,</p>
<p>being able to see the truth at deeper, deeper levels,</p>
<p>like, you know, Wikipedia and just the internet in general</p>
<p>is enabling education at a level</p>
<p>that was unimaginable before the internet.</p>
<p>Yes, and I think space exploration,</p>
<p>even contemplating about these possibilities,</p>
<p>ultimately, and I will emphasize this again,</p>
<p>should make us think about our own place in the universe.</p>
<p>If we are alone, that is quite fascinating</p>
<p>and we definitely have a responsibility</p>
<p>to guard what we got better and protect it better</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t take it for granted.</p>
<p>If we are not the only one,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also a lot of responsibility</p>
<p>to understand what else is out there.</p>
<p>So either proposition, as famously being told,</p>
<p>is fascinating, but as a scientist, I think,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s a general behavior,</p>
<p>maybe not my fellow scientists listening to this</p>
<p>can correct me if they aren&rsquo;t like this,</p>
<p>but you need to have a level of optimism and hope.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something, you know,</p>
<p>that things are worth working for,</p>
<p>worth dreaming, worth imagining,</p>
<p>and we cannot just have fear of suffering or fear of pain</p>
<p>stopping us from doing marvelous things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to quite a few people in my life</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of shit done,</p>
<p>have helped a lot of people,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know a single one of them</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not an optimist.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a place for critics</p>
<p>and cynicism in this world,</p>
<p>but in terms of actually building things</p>
<p>and creating things in this world</p>
<p>that help a lot of people,</p>
<p>I think optimism is a requirement,</p>
<p>is a precondition in almost all cases</p>
<p>in my limited, humble human experience.</p>
<p>But I tend to, when I look out there,</p>
<p>I think that aliens are everywhere.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>to me, I have a humility about,</p>
<p>I tend to see us humans as being very limited cognitively.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s so many things we don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I think eventually we&rsquo;ll understand,</p>
<p>of course, we don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but my gut says we&rsquo;ll understand that alien signals</p>
<p>and life has been all around us,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re too dumb to see it.</p>
<p>Like, whatever life is,</p>
<p>whatever the life force is,</p>
<p>whatever consciousness is,</p>
<p>whatever intelligence,</p>
<p>whatever the mechanism that led to the origin</p>
<p>of life on Earth was everywhere,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just too dumb to see it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhere, we&rsquo;ll find it somewhere in the physics.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the most humbling parts</p>
<p>of also being a scientist,</p>
<p>that we know that we never know for sure.</p>
<p>And for the outsiders, perhaps,</p>
<p>that may be a very strange way of living,</p>
<p>especially when your pursuit is about creating knowledge,</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ll know that what you created can also be,</p>
<p>and hopefully will be disproven</p>
<p>so that another level will rise.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve seen this lack of maybe connection</p>
<p>between the approach to science or knowledge</p>
<p>versus folks who are maybe not thinking</p>
<p>about these problems every day,</p>
<p>that we are okay with being wrong.</p>
<p>In fact, we know that that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>to push the limits of knowledge.</p>
<p>How do you think life originated on Earth?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this a bit.</p>
<p>Do you have a gut feeling about,</p>
<p>first of all, actually even to step back,</p>
<p>do you think, because you were flirting with this idea,</p>
<p>did the translation mechanism came before life?</p>
<p>I think that you cannot separate</p>
<p>from emergence of translation machinery</p>
<p>from emergence of life,</p>
<p>or something like translation machinery,</p>
<p>this whole informatic chemical computing system</p>
<p>that is also capable of dynamism</p>
<p>and evolvability that comes with biology,</p>
<p>biological behavior from emergence of life itself.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve definitely took a lot of steps</p>
<p>towards understanding origins.</p>
<p>We are able to create molecules from environments,</p>
<p>lightning, heat, and you make amino acids.</p>
<p>So we are able to create the building blocks,</p>
<p>the Miller-Urey experiment, that&rsquo;s now 60 years ago.</p>
<p>We are able to create the building blocks.</p>
<p>We are able to make them interact with one another.</p>
<p>They can get more complex.</p>
<p>Some call this messy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this chemistry that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>We are able to have these chemicals interact</p>
<p>with one another,</p>
<p>maybe have even some emergent properties</p>
<p>that we can quantify.</p>
<p>Definitely there is this trend</p>
<p>towards more systems-level approach to origins,</p>
<p>more introduction of systems-level chemistry,</p>
<p>more network-level chemistry,</p>
<p>and complex system integration</p>
<p>in order to understand how,</p>
<p>now that we can make these building blocks,</p>
<p>we can make them interact with one another,</p>
<p>but how do we make them interact with one another</p>
<p>in more intelligent ways</p>
<p>that will have the properties of a biological system,</p>
<p>will be heritable,</p>
<p>it will be responding to the environment,</p>
<p>it will mutate, and it will sustain itself.</p>
<p>That is the final bit, I think,</p>
<p>in our Origin of Life adventure.</p>
<p>And we are extremely close.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very optimistic that our community</p>
<p>will get a handle of this problem in this decade.</p>
<p>This is, in fact, I think,</p>
<p>one of the most exciting times to be doing this work.</p>
<p>What would be super convincing to you,</p>
<p>like incredibly amazing,</p>
<p>would blow your mind if X was done in a lab?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you would call it Origin of Life,</p>
<p>but something really truly remarkable</p>
<p>and special done in a lab.</p>
<p>What would that look like to you?</p>
<p>These properties that I listed,</p>
<p>those five properties that I listed about,</p>
<p>and the machinery that is capable of sensing</p>
<p>and responding to the environment,</p>
<p>if we can, I would imagine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s similar to Miller-Urey experiments,</p>
<p>where they only sparked particular environmental forces</p>
<p>and were able to produce a chemical</p>
<p>that is important for life,</p>
<p>or a mix of chemicals important for life,</p>
<p>or building blocks, rather.</p>
<p>If I saw that a similar experiment</p>
<p>where a well-defined geochemical parameter</p>
<p>was subjected on a mix of chemistry,</p>
<p>which led that chemistry to form</p>
<p>some level of computation, informatic, biological property,</p>
<p>and by biological, I&rsquo;m gonna keep it to very minimum,</p>
<p>as I defined early on,</p>
<p>that would be super exciting to me,</p>
<p>a self-organizing chemistry</p>
<p>that we can create experimentally in a flask</p>
<p>by simulating the conditions of early Earth,</p>
<p>be it radiation, be it temperature,</p>
<p>mix of both, that would be very cool.</p>
<p>And doing all the five,</p>
<p>the chemical, physical, informatic, computational, biological.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So simulation and a computer would not be good enough?</p>
<p>It would be great,</p>
<p>because they help to understand the parameters,</p>
<p>maybe formulate, maybe quantify, create models,</p>
<p>but ultimately you need to experiment.</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s quantum mechanical simulation,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s going to be extremely difficult.</p>
<p>So simulating from the physics up,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be very difficult,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna have to simulate</p>
<p>the physical, the chemical, the informatic.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to start the quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and end up in biology all through simulation.</p>
<p>But the stuff that DeepMind did with alpha fold</p>
<p>and the protein folding is really inspiring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inspiring in that you&rsquo;re able to do,</p>
<p>to solve a difficult biology problem.</p>
<p>Absolutely, that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>a lot of benefits to those models, predictions,</p>
<p>because they at least help the experimentalist</p>
<p>to come up with the priors</p>
<p>and parameterize things better,</p>
<p>maybe eliminates very obvious dead ends early on,</p>
<p>given that experiments take such a long time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a huge investment.</p>
<p>And no one&rsquo;s a better experimentalist than nature, so.</p>
<p>Let me ask you perhaps a depressing, sad for you question.</p>
<p>You really want to make me sad, you&rsquo;re not gonna win.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a flame of optimism in you</p>
<p>that will never be extinguished.</p>
<p>Okay, the idea of panspermia.</p>
<p>You mentioned, would we seed another planet with life?</p>
<p>Is it possible that our planet</p>
<p>was seeded with life from elsewhere?</p>
<p>So what the proposition I made,</p>
<p>I like to think of it as protospermia</p>
<p>rather than panspermia,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s even more, it&rsquo;s a more proto state</p>
<p>than acknowledging, because in panspermia,</p>
<p>you still have a cell, right?</p>
<p>You still have something that is very,</p>
<p>even a cell to me would be very Earth-like, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking at sub-cellular level</p>
<p>in the proposition of spreading chemistry.</p>
<p>So spreading chemical ingredients, not spreading life.</p>
<p>Exactly, it would be more like the fertilizer</p>
<p>that is well-adopted and compatible with that planetary body.</p>
<p>In panspermia, you&rsquo;re still imagining</p>
<p>either an entire bacteria or microbe or a cell</p>
<p>or something that is DNA, which is still Terran.</p>
<p>So in that sense, that doesn&rsquo;t matter to you,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s chemistry, that&rsquo;s the initial conditions.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how the initial conditions came to be.</p>
<p>They are what they are, and let&rsquo;s go from there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all kinds of fascinatingly different</p>
<p>initial conditions in terms of chemistry</p>
<p>on different planets.</p>
<p>Yes, but in terms of panspermia,</p>
<p>I mean, obviously there&rsquo;s gonna be always room</p>
<p>for those sort of discussions,</p>
<p>or there will be, those discussions will always be present,</p>
<p>I think, in any life in universe debates.</p>
<p>But the problem I have with panspermia</p>
<p>is that it removes the problem</p>
<p>from the planet to somewhere else.</p>
<p>It makes it very difficult to answer scientifically.</p>
<p>You just took the problem away from this planet</p>
<p>and formulate it in a way that I cannot go</p>
<p>and try to understand in the lab,</p>
<p>doing experiments, or even through models.</p>
<p>Does it, though, so I&rsquo;ve heard brilliant biologists</p>
<p>like yourself say that, but I just, to me,</p>
<p>okay, here&rsquo;s how I think of Earth.</p>
<p>So I actually am able to hold all these possibilities</p>
<p>in my head, and all of them are inspiring to me.</p>
<p>I kind of think there&rsquo;s a possibility</p>
<p>that Earth is just an experiment by a graduate student,</p>
<p>by an alien graduate student, like.</p>
<p>So I know the exact episode of Star Trek</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But there is some, to me, that&rsquo;s inspiring.</p>
<p>If we are.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what panspermia is about,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about my proposition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what panspermia is.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s panspermia?</p>
<p>It is-</p>
<p>Oh, life just came from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Still, that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s still giant leaps that happened on Earth,</p>
<p>it seems like, beyond the initial primitive organisms,</p>
<p>like eukaryotes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think panspermia usually articulates</p>
<p>at the level of eukaryotes.</p>
<p>I think they talk about bacteria primarily.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s still interesting,</p>
<p>because all the different leaps of evolution</p>
<p>still happen here on Earth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>interesting to listen to,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t place it in,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to place it</p>
<p>in the studies of origin of life, I guess, or-</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how we place it.</p>
<p>You have the initial conditions for the origin of life,</p>
<p>and you try to create life in that way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve described in the five components,</p>
<p>and it keeps failing.</p>
<p>So what panspermia allows you to do</p>
<p>is to also consider the question,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s missing components.</p>
<p>How do you answer that question?</p>
<p>Through exploration and through science.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, tell me-</p>
<p>Looking outside of Earth,</p>
<p>looking at the fundamentals of chemistry and physics.</p>
<p>How do you understand that</p>
<p>with fundamentals of chemistry and physics?</p>
<p>How do you understand gravity?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re talking about panspermia, right?</p>
<p>Just, I don&rsquo;t understand how would you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different than,</p>
<p>if you think it&rsquo;s similar to looking for life</p>
<p>in the universe, is that what you&rsquo;re thinking?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying there&rsquo;s a missing component</p>
<p>that came from elsewhere.</p>
<p>But a whole entire organism</p>
<p>is not a missing component like that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, when you&rsquo;re thinking about origin of life.</p>
<p>No, no, no, that&rsquo;s an assumption.</p>
<p>Your assumption is all the ingredients</p>
<p>for the origin of life are here on Earth.</p>
<p>Now, I tend to believe that most likely that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s inspiring</p>
<p>to think that there is some ingredients</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna push back,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not panspermia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>See, okay, so think,</p>
<p>but yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also kind of fun to push back on you.</p>
<p>No, I understand, I understand.</p>
<p>I understand if actually a living organism</p>
<p>ended up here from elsewhere,</p>
<p>that means a lot of the exploration we&rsquo;re doing here</p>
<p>with the ingredients that we know</p>
<p>will not give us the clues to the origin of life.</p>
<p>But it just seems like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still very useful to try to create life here.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll see, wait a minute,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;ll be able to prove,</p>
<p>not prove, but show that panspermia is very likely?</p>
<p>Like if we just keep failing,</p>
<p>we understand biology deeply,</p>
<p>we understand chemistry deeply.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I mean, there will be,</p>
<p>the failure is not gonna indicate</p>
<p>that this must have been,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone will put the problem</p>
<p>to something else just because our failures,</p>
<p>our experiments failed.</p>
<p>So failure means we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the chemistry deeply enough.</p>
<p>Yeah, and given the progress we made</p>
<p>and how many brilliant people are working on this right now,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s definitely more,</p>
<p>I would say that we are approaching this problem</p>
<p>in more broader ways, with different ways possible,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident that we will get there.</p>
<p>For us, again, we are interested in early cells</p>
<p>and first cells and what followed the origin of life,</p>
<p>but we cannot, given that it&rsquo;s a continuum,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s between the origin and emergence of first cells,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to separate these two ends from one another.</p>
<p>So given that life is a solution to a chemistry problem,</p>
<p>if we re-ran Earth a million times,</p>
<p>how different would the results be?</p>
<p>If we look at that wheel,</p>
<p>how different would be the tree of life, do you think?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s your gut say?</p>
<p>My mind asks, are you imagining,</p>
<p>if we are repeating the planet 1 million times,</p>
<p>are we seeing, are the things that happened,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking at the chemical level,</p>
<p>but at the environment level,</p>
<p>do they happen at the same time, at the same frequency,</p>
<p>at the same intensity,</p>
<p>every time you&rsquo;re running this tape over and over again?</p>
<p>Yes, you mean like geological stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, like, so is the same-</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying those are important?</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that you would ask that question</p>
<p>is also fascinating.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s important, the timing, the frequency,</p>
<p>the intensity of geological events?</p>
<p>Yeah, so when we run this imaginary</p>
<p>rewind and replay experiments in our minds,</p>
<p>I wanna know whether we are positioning</p>
<p>all the same geologic events</p>
<p>at the same chronological order as well,</p>
<p>or whether we are also giving them more randomness.</p>
<p>So if the volcano erupted, is it happening at the same time?</p>
<p>If you have, are dinosaurs getting wiped off every time</p>
<p>with the same meteorite that&rsquo;s hitting the same-</p>
<p>But also, like, temperature changes and all that-</p>
<p>Temperature changes, everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually, I&rsquo;ve heard you say somewhere</p>
<p>that one of the things that&rsquo;s fascinating to you</p>
<p>about this whole process of evolution</p>
<p>is that the process of evolution,</p>
<p>all the mechanisms were invented and developed</p>
<p>despite all the variation geologically,</p>
<p>through the hardship that Earth has gone through.</p>
<p>That the biological innovations persisted despite that?</p>
<p>Persisted, yeah, despite that, which is interesting.</p>
<p>You kind of think of the biological innovations</p>
<p>kind of happening on their own.</p>
<p>Because we, so we actually have a center</p>
<p>exploring this problem.</p>
<p>We wanna understand whether,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like judging a book by its cover, right?</p>
<p>Do you just look at an environment</p>
<p>and then see whatever is present</p>
<p>or scarce in that environment,</p>
<p>and then think that, okay, the life form</p>
<p>that will exist in this environment</p>
<p>will obviously have a lot of molybdenum in its system.</p>
<p>Look at all this molybdenum around here.</p>
<p>Or will it be, because if you say that,</p>
<p>you are now putting the environment</p>
<p>in the more prime driver role, right?</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re saying that environment will determine</p>
<p>what biology will or will not use.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve done studies that show</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not necessarily this straightforward.</p>
<p>That for instance, we looked at going back to nitrogen.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>about the way cells fix nitrogen,</p>
<p>the ones that can do,</p>
<p>is that they also do this</p>
<p>through a lot of help of a lot of metals,</p>
<p>a lot of elemental support really.</p>
<p>And which geologists use to understand</p>
<p>where did this metabolism even evolved,</p>
<p>where at first place.</p>
<p>So we look at the ancient oceans,</p>
<p>we try to understand the elemental composition</p>
<p>of ancient oceans.</p>
<p>And what we see is that in some cases,</p>
<p>the metabolisms, even though they prefer a certain metal</p>
<p>or an element that is in the environment,</p>
<p>that metal wasn&rsquo;t abounded in the environment,</p>
<p>but still life chose that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that straightforward as though,</p>
<p>whatever, you are what you eat,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t necessarily eat what is obvious to you.</p>
<p>Just because there&rsquo;s a lot of that food around</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean life will ultimately go there.</p>
<p>Maybe most of the time it will,</p>
<p>but it seems like in the case of nitrogen fixation,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t and maybe that made the difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool that, right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the abundant resource</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be the definition</p>
<p>of what kind of life flourishes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a straightforward thing.</p>
<p>But your sense is that the different timing,</p>
<p>the different conditions of the environment</p>
<p>would change the way evolution happens.</p>
<p>Yeah, for instance, I mean,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s in the 80s, maybe earlier than that,</p>
<p>the Stephen Jay Gould&rsquo;s book, Wonderful Life,</p>
<p>which changed, I think, a lot of scientists&rsquo; life,</p>
<p>including mine.</p>
<p>He contemplates on this notion of the tape of life.</p>
<p>Of course, I hope people still know what tape is,</p>
<p>but I think your listeners will know what tape is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the-</p>
<p>Tape?</p>
<p>Go on, tell me about the tape.</p>
<p>Is it like a TikTok?</p>
<p>Can you swipe on it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>I apologize for my rude interruptions.</p>
<p>I kind of ask for it.</p>
<p>But he speculated or he suggested</p>
<p>this hypothetical experiment whether,</p>
<p>if life was recorded on,</p>
<p>or can be imagined to be recorded on a linear,</p>
<p>is it linear chain of events recorded on a tape,</p>
<p>and if we were to rewind the tape,</p>
<p>would we listen to the same song, right?</p>
<p>So this was, and in his proposition, I also thought,</p>
<p>yeah, but are we replaying the tape in the same exact manner</p>
<p>or are we, meaning all the geological</p>
<p>and environmental events,</p>
<p>are they happening at the same time?</p>
<p>Because then you removed the randomness</p>
<p>from equation a little bit, right?</p>
<p>You just removed it because you&rsquo;re assuming</p>
<p>everything will happen at the same time,</p>
<p>at the same intensity.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not too contingent.</p>
<p>That means that the natural selection you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>is really operating at more,</p>
<p>or evolution is operating at more,</p>
<p>under more random forces</p>
<p>than that can be dictated by the environment.</p>
<p>So in our way of understanding</p>
<p>or thinking about rewinding, replaying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>the role of the environment as clearly</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t seem to be integrated as much.</p>
<p>But I also wonder if it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that the chemistry ultimately defines the destination,</p>
<p>that despite all the environmental changes,</p>
<p>despite all the randomness,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll end up in something.</p>
<p>But we are not talking about whether life will emerge</p>
<p>and sustain itself.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about whether life will emerge</p>
<p>and sustain itself in the shape and form</p>
<p>that is similar to what we have right now.</p>
<p>So you are chemistry, I&rsquo;m chemistry,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having this conversation,</p>
<p>and your plants are chemistry too.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also having their own conversation.</p>
<p>These plants are fake, but yes.</p>
<p>I knew that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to say that, but they&rsquo;re fake.</p>
<p>Do you look at my place?</p>
<p>Of course they would be fake,</p>
<p>otherwise they would die.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with this place?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Alice and this is Wonderland.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that this is a place where robots flourish</p>
<p>and those plants are fake.</p>
<p>Are you saying that you and I are the only living organisms?</p>
<p>Well, obviously there are microbes in this room, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, we are the only living organisms.</p>
<p>I was thinking of getting a dog.</p>
<p>This is not a clean room.</p>
<p>So you have microbes here.</p>
<p>Yes, many, millions.</p>
<p>Yes, so you and I and all the microbes in this room,</p>
<p>your chemical systems that are operating</p>
<p>in a way that we can respond and sense</p>
<p>our environments and whatnot.</p>
<p>But if you are asking if we are going to be here,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re imagining that another solution</p>
<p>is also possible, which is different</p>
<p>than the fundamentals of life.</p>
<p>Because life will do always.</p>
<p>Life will do its life thing.</p>
<p>I guess it goes all the way back</p>
<p>to the things we were talking about, translation,</p>
<p>and the stuff you were messing with,</p>
<p>is figuring out what is the important stuff and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder about,</p>
<p>just like with the translation machinery with human beings,</p>
<p>I wonder what&rsquo;s the important stuff.</p>
<p>Is it important to have two limbs?</p>
<p>Is it important to have eyes?</p>
<p>Like, it was obvious that the sensory mechanism of eyes,</p>
<p>like sight, were to develop.</p>
<p>How many times if we re-enter Earth</p>
<p>would the sensory mechanism of sight develop?</p>
<p>And what would it look like?</p>
<p>Would it be one giant eye?</p>
<p>Or would it be two?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s with the symmetry?</p>
<p>Why are we so damn symmetrical?</p>
<p>In response to Steve Jay Gould&rsquo;s proposition,</p>
<p>most people who argue that life is convergent</p>
<p>and it will in fact lead to a few determined outcomes,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s not that the outcome is determined per se,</p>
<p>but the pathways are restricted</p>
<p>and the mutational trajectories that life can act upon</p>
<p>are already very limited</p>
<p>so that the final outcomes are a few,</p>
<p>and eyes being one of them.</p>
<p>So the convergence at the eye level</p>
<p>was presented as an example</p>
<p>of why life may actually embark on the same solution</p>
<p>over and over again,</p>
<p>given that many species evolved independently</p>
<p>from one another.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s any inkling of truth to that?</p>
<p>Like, is it just us humans thinking</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re special?</p>
<p>I think those innovations came again so far after the&hellip;</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s the fun stuff, yes.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I mean, thank you.</p>
<p>I think we humans tend to talk about the later stuff,</p>
<p>but without the earlier stuff-</p>
<p>So when we think of earlier,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, and I ask this to my students too,</p>
<p>I want them to close their eyes</p>
<p>and think about just nothingness but dust.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have trees.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have plants.</p>
<p>When we say an empty place,</p>
<p>or visually at least,</p>
<p>we are talking about a planet that is really alien.</p>
<p>So understanding our own past</p>
<p>is similar to understanding an alien planet altogether,</p>
<p>given that it is a very different planet</p>
<p>that did not have any oxygen for 2 billion years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that is familiar to us</p>
<p>that we would even think about</p>
<p>when we think about life that is present in our past,</p>
<p>yet here we are.</p>
<p>So cool that from that came this.</p>
<p>And we are very, very,</p>
<p>we are the super late arrivals to the party, right?</p>
<p>So this is definitely not our planets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the microbial planets that we live in.</p>
<p>But the potential to create us was always there.</p>
<p>How do you know that?</p>
<p>Because we were created.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s possible that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>even for the early stuff,</p>
<p>yeah, maybe if it&rsquo;s super unlikely, yeah,</p>
<p>we just got super,</p>
<p>this is the planet that got really lucky given the chemistry.</p>
<p>Like maybe to create the bacteria is not so lucky,</p>
<p>but to create complex organisms all the way up to mammals,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super lucky.</p>
<p>Yes, and it may all come down to a few innovations</p>
<p>that happened at the molecular level</p>
<p>that may or may not be inevitable.</p>
<p>So all these molecular tricks may have enabled</p>
<p>the sort of mere existence of whatever you are able</p>
<p>to define as familiar to yourself.</p>
<p>And you have a hope that science can answer these questions</p>
<p>to reconstruct?</p>
<p>Science is answering these questions.</p>
<p>I mean, we are limited to going back to the beginning</p>
<p>in our ways, right?</p>
<p>So we rely on biology.</p>
<p>It says overwritten.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about four billion year old records</p>
<p>that is ever changing.</p>
<p>That again makes it beautiful,</p>
<p>but also makes it difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not tractable.</p>
<p>Geology has some degree,</p>
<p>to some degree it has a record of a more static,</p>
<p>frozen state record that is embedded on itself</p>
<p>on the surface of this planet if we can find them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the key that most of these recorded remnants are,</p>
<p>if we are lucky we find them.</p>
<p>They are not naturally selected.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re found, they need to be found for us to read them.</p>
<p>So we work with a very handful set of samples,</p>
<p>especially when we talk about the deep past,</p>
<p>the planets with no oxygen,</p>
<p>when we passed the great oxidation event threshold</p>
<p>that is about 2.5 billion years.</p>
<p>So the earliest life is even harder.</p>
<p>You are trying to write the story of life</p>
<p>based on a handful of rocks and what is recorded on them.</p>
<p>Speaking of finding select remnants of our deep past,</p>
<p>you said that you&rsquo;ve been thinking about Nick Nealon&rsquo;s essay</p>
<p>on scientific knowledge and scientific abstraction.</p>
<p>So let me ask you,</p>
<p>where do you think scientific questions and answers</p>
<p>or in general ideas come from?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a scientist.</p>
<p>You ask very good questions</p>
<p>and try systematically and rigorously</p>
<p>to answer them through experiment.</p>
<p>Where do you think ideas come from?</p>
<p>So ideas come all the time, right?</p>
<p>There are all kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>There are good ideas, there are not so good ideas.</p>
<p>There are really exciting ideas, maybe some boring ones.</p>
<p>But if you are really interested</p>
<p>in doing something different,</p>
<p>then you need to be willing to take the risk to be wrong.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>Even though we talked about the idealist</p>
<p>sort of notion behind science</p>
<p>that we ultimately want to be rejected</p>
<p>or our ideas need to be rejected</p>
<p>for the entire infrastructure to move forward.</p>
<p>There is a level of risk-taking, I think,</p>
<p>behind any creative idea.</p>
<p>And I mean that in a true sense.</p>
<p>If you are disappointed that your idea didn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>then it wasn&rsquo;t a risk</p>
<p>because you still hoped that it will work.</p>
<p>True risk is that you accept that this may not work</p>
<p>so that the failure shouldn&rsquo;t also surprise you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it when you embark on stuff,</p>
<p>when you embark on an idea,</p>
<p>do you actually contemplate and accept failure?</p>
<p>Not consciously, I wouldn&rsquo;t say so.</p>
<p>But I eliminated a lot of the things</p>
<p>out of my work line</p>
<p>by simply not feeling like studying them.</p>
<p>I was bored chasing certain questions and I-</p>
<p>So you trusted the signal of boredom</p>
<p>as a good sign that it&rsquo;s not a good question.</p>
<p>It should definitely be,</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re doing should be exciting to you.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s only one person</p>
<p>that should be ever excited about what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>that should be you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s enough for that idea to go somewhere.</p>
<p>I think that you need to believe in the idea.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to not fall in love</p>
<p>with your mistakes.</p>
<p>That if something isn&rsquo;t working,</p>
<p>you should let it go instead of trying to fix it.</p>
<p>Even though you feel that this is a mistake</p>
<p>or you know that it&rsquo;s a mistake,</p>
<p>in order to,</p>
<p>sorry, instead of trying to fix it,</p>
<p>you should wrap it up and move on to something else,</p>
<p>which is incredibly hard.</p>
<p>Good advice for science,</p>
<p>but also good advice for relationships.</p>
<p>But okay, so that&rsquo;s actually really hard,</p>
<p>especially, I mean, this is like PhD stuff.</p>
<p>If you sink in so much of your time,</p>
<p>not even PhD,</p>
<p>entire scientific careers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really tough to let go.</p>
<p>Yes, and there is not a lot of room for true freedom,</p>
<p>maybe at this certain degree.</p>
<p>So first you need to be trained, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that scientists are just brilliant, amazing humans.</p>
<p>I mean, they just know and learn.</p>
<p>They know how to do science</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re trained in how to do science.</p>
<p>So that is important because I,</p>
<p>as someone who wants to definitely,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that I&rsquo;m giving the message</p>
<p>that this is for everybody,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this notion of scientists</p>
<p>being super smart people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s definitely not true, right?</p>
<p>It is a method that you learn to solve a problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what science is.</p>
<p>And some are really good at it,</p>
<p>and they get better at it under really good guidance,</p>
<p>maybe good mentorship.</p>
<p>And ultimately everyone finds their own style</p>
<p>of problem solving and what sort of problems they solve.</p>
<p>But I have not met a scientist</p>
<p>that finds their own pursuit boring.</p>
<p>Well, it can happen,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not going to be effective,</p>
<p>just like you said, I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting because</p>
<p>in the age of social media and attention economies</p>
<p>and stuff like that,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve interacted with a lot of folks</p>
<p>like YouTubers and so on.</p>
<p>I think a lot of their work is driven</p>
<p>by what others find exciting.</p>
<p>And I think that ultimately leads</p>
<p>to a life that&rsquo;s not fulfilling.</p>
<p>I can see the reason behind it,</p>
<p>or perhaps there&rsquo;s, again, fear of failure</p>
<p>that can be a major determinant of that pattern, right?</p>
<p>So you try to do something that is accepted by others</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s maybe likely to give results right away.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a long game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very long game.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re aiming a long-term change</p>
<p>and long-term impact,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to be very, very patient about it</p>
<p>and you better tame your ego.</p>
<p>I mean, on YouTube and those kinds of places</p>
<p>on the internet, on social media,</p>
<p>you get feedback like right away.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s even harder to be patient.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because yeah, change and ideas develop</p>
<p>over a period of months and years, not decades.</p>
<p>And the response from social media and so on</p>
<p>is on the rate of seconds, minutes, and hours.</p>
<p>So I recommend actual physical libraries</p>
<p>for people who may wanna appreciate</p>
<p>or remember the sense of time</p>
<p>and how long it takes to build something.</p>
<p>I think it is, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the immediacy and the right response of,</p>
<p>and the fact that these places are,</p>
<p>the algorithm wants you to respond right away</p>
<p>and interact with itself, right?</p>
<p>So I can see the appeal,</p>
<p>but true innovation, I think, doesn&rsquo;t even scream.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not shiny, especially in the beginning.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also important to not fool ourselves</p>
<p>and think that everything that people criticize</p>
<p>has some super important meaning behind it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a mix of the technique, the methods,</p>
<p>and your gut feeling.</p>
<p>Yeah, and a weird dance between learning</p>
<p>and accepting the ideas of the current science,</p>
<p>and at times trusting your gut and rejecting those.</p>
<p>Because science progresses by sometimes rejecting</p>
<p>the ideas of the past, or sometimes building on them</p>
<p>in a way that changes them, transforms them.</p>
<p>Yes, and I think what is hard is to really drill down</p>
<p>into a concept, right?</p>
<p>So you can create a new thing,</p>
<p>and then it may be appealing and gain a lot of traction,</p>
<p>but to sustain that, to continue that,</p>
<p>you really need to show the true expertise.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not only about defining a problem,</p>
<p>but then really systematically solve that problem</p>
<p>maybe over the course of decades.</p>
<p>You mentioned library.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also saw that you&rsquo;ve translated scientific documents,</p>
<p>or at least mentioned that you did it</p>
<p>at some point in your life.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, how much do you think</p>
<p>is lost in translation, in science and in life?</p>
<p>How many languages do you speak?</p>
<p>Two. Two.</p>
<p>How much is lost in translation, in science and in life</p>
<p>between those two?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s actually three,</p>
<p>because science is like another language, right?</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I speak Russian, a little bit of French,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always fascinating to see how much is lost.</p>
<p>And the Soviet Union has a tradition of science</p>
<p>and mathematics and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting that a lot of the wisdom</p>
<p>gained from that part of the world is lost,</p>
<p>basically because it was never translated.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not sure if it is lost per se.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s more like a gain in some sense, right?</p>
<p>Because you understand,</p>
<p>science is ultimately a human pursuit.</p>
<p>So you cannot separate as much as,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s the best system that humans ever came up with</p>
<p>to seek knowledge, to generate and make sense of the world.</p>
<p>It works most of the time.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>Did the kind of translation you do, by the way,</p>
<p>was for scientific work?</p>
<p>I directly translated for scientific work, yes.</p>
<p>I think that, again,</p>
<p>brains are equally distributed,</p>
<p>but opportunities are not, right?</p>
<p>So if you want to include,</p>
<p>if you want to benefit from all human power,</p>
<p>whatever we can generate as human beings,</p>
<p>you need to include everybody on the table.</p>
<p>And that is by extending the opportunity.</p>
<p>I think most of us that make it tend to think</p>
<p>that we did because of something special about ourselves.</p>
<p>But it is important to know that,</p>
<p>no, we were given opportunities,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why we are here,</p>
<p>not because there was something inherently special about us</p>
<p>or that the system truly selects</p>
<p>for the ones that really are.</p>
<p>Yeah, and language is a part of the opportunity.</p>
<p>Yeah, language is an opportunity</p>
<p>because it comes with, similar to bacteria, right?</p>
<p>They speak these languages.</p>
<p>Even we call culturing the bacteria,</p>
<p>we call it culturing, right?</p>
<p>When we grow bacteria that we isolate</p>
<p>from the environment in the lab,</p>
<p>meaning that you create an environment</p>
<p>for them to grow and thrive and sustain themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we say, but culture is,</p>
<p>for microbiologists, for language,</p>
<p>with language comes a different culture,</p>
<p>a different perspective,</p>
<p>and you bring that to the table.</p>
<p>I mean, it brings the sense of diversity</p>
<p>that can only be achieved by clashing, perhaps,</p>
<p>two different cultures, two different languages,</p>
<p>two different approaches,</p>
<p>maybe in some cases, four different approaches.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think language is not just</p>
<p>a mechanism of communication.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to, it&rsquo;s a dynamic system of exploring ideas,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s interesting to see that different languages</p>
<p>explores ideas differently.</p>
<p>Yes, and I think that, so when I said science</p>
<p>is like a language itself, I said it in two different ways.</p>
<p>One is very literal meaning, that you can speak English,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you will understand</p>
<p>the scientific paper.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s a different level of English</p>
<p>that you need to learn to understand,</p>
<p>even not just for scientific papers,</p>
<p>even from discipline to discipline.</p>
<p>I challenge any chemist to read</p>
<p>an evolutionary biology paper, and vice versa.</p>
<p>It may sound extremely different,</p>
<p>a different language altogether,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the language of communicating,</p>
<p>and because words matter, how we talk matter,</p>
<p>how we represent our science matters.</p>
<p>So yes, just learning English as a second language alone</p>
<p>is not gonna make you fluent in science either.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting, because in that sense,</p>
<p>you speak many more than three languages,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re pretty cross-disciplinary.</p>
<p>It seems like you have a foot in a lot of disciplines.</p>
<p>I mean, especially in geology, biology, evolutionary biology,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s chemistry.</p>
<p>Biochemistry, biophysics, even we do a lot of statistics,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a lot of mathematics to what we do as well.</p>
<p>Yes, we like to think of it</p>
<p>as this Nell&rsquo;s Astrobiology program.</p>
<p>I repeat it, because it&rsquo;s fun,</p>
<p>that it is not a fruit salad, but it&rsquo;s a smoothie,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what we are generating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fruit salad?</p>
<p>So a smoothie is a successful combination of those fields,</p>
<p>and a fruit salad is not?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s success, necessarily.</p>
<p>If you put the wrong ingredient,</p>
<p>and you press the blender, and you&rsquo;ve made it a smoothie,</p>
<p>you mean it can ruin the entire mix.</p>
<p>Can it though?</p>
<p>Because I feel like every-</p>
<p>Yes, I can definitely assess that for ginger first.</p>
<p>Those that ruins every smoothie.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Ginger?</p>
<p>I think so, but it&rsquo;s just a personal thing.</p>
<p>And also I don&rsquo;t like cinnamon.</p>
<p>Ginger has a cinnamony taste?</p>
<p>Because I thought ginger was-</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think they do, but I also don&rsquo;t like-</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that a thing they add in a lot of smoothies?</p>
<p>I was forced a smoothie.</p>
<p>I went to Malibu with a good friend of mine, Dan Reynolds,</p>
<p>and he forced me to consume a smoothie.</p>
<p>And it was probably the first smoothie I&rsquo;ve ever had,</p>
<p>because I always was very judgmental</p>
<p>of the kind of places and people that drink smoothies.</p>
<p>But it was good, it was good.</p>
<p>Well, smoothie is very American, so I-</p>
<p>Yeah, it is an American thing.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say success per se,</p>
<p>but it is true that when you dance</p>
<p>at the edge of different disciplines,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s when inevitably the innovation will rise,</p>
<p>because you will see things maybe a little differently</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on the edge, right?</p>
<p>So, but it will probably take longer,</p>
<p>and it may not be understood right away.</p>
<p>It may not come into final form quickly,</p>
<p>given that it is a new concept rising.</p>
<p>So therefore the patience will make more sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, patience will be even more important.</p>
<p>So if you are, in other words,</p>
<p>if you are into immediate appreciation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably not the way to go.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one chemical organism.</p>
<p>So let me ask maybe a little bit more of a personal thing.</p>
<p>Where did your life form originate?</p>
<p>And what fond memory do you have</p>
<p>from the early days of childhood</p>
<p>that are representative of your bacteria culture?</p>
<p>I was born in Istanbul.</p>
<p>So I grew up in Turkey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a city that has two continents,</p>
<p>which is quite interesting.</p>
<p>You have a, you see a welcome to Europe sign</p>
<p>and then welcome to Asia sign the same day,</p>
<p>depending on which part of the bridge you are.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I was born</p>
<p>and I spent about roughly 20 years of my life</p>
<p>and then I immigrated to United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very proud culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very flavorful culture.</p>
<p>What aspects of it is part of who you are?</p>
<p>What are the beautiful aspects</p>
<p>that you carry with you in your heart?</p>
<p>I think we are very sincerely human,</p>
<p>as a culture, I think that we have the saying</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t go to bed full if your neighbor is hungry.</p>
<p>So, you know, you wouldn&rsquo;t eat any food</p>
<p>in front of someone where I come from</p>
<p>without offering to share the bite.</p>
<p>So I think those things, however small they may sound,</p>
<p>a really big deal, especially when you are put in</p>
<p>or move to a place that may not have those attributes.</p>
<p>So I think that culturally, we had a lot of conscious,</p>
<p>just role, deep human.</p>
<p>The connection, the value of the connection</p>
<p>between human beings.</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>I think I definitely carried that with me.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about biology.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about the romantic question.</p>
<p>What role does love play in the human condition</p>
<p>or in the entirety of life on earth?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to learn how to love if you&rsquo;re not loved.</p>
<p>But the good news is that it is something</p>
<p>that you can learn, I think,</p>
<p>that you can practice and teach yourself</p>
<p>how to maybe give yourself the thing</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t given to you</p>
<p>and then ultimately give it to others.</p>
<p>I think it would be quite arrogant to think</p>
<p>that we will be capable of loving.</p>
<p>It could be anything, really.</p>
<p>So just like translation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a repeating and a dynamical process.</p>
<p>That you can learn.</p>
<p>Yeah, that you can learn.</p>
<p>Yes, and you should learn.</p>
<p>We should, even, there&rsquo;s no excuse to not learning.</p>
<p>To love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s a deeply human thing.</p>
<p>It is a deeply human thing.</p>
<p>It is a very sad thing if any one of us passes this planet</p>
<p>without knowing what love is.</p>
<p>And that could be a love to a pet, a love to a plant.</p>
<p>To a robot.</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>Or a fake plant.</p>
<p>We love, we can&rsquo;t help who we love.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person today?</p>
<p>High school, college?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>How to have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or how to have a life they can be proud of.</p>
<p>You said an interesting thing about brains</p>
<p>being distributed evenly but opportunity is not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting to think about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to folks from Africa.</p>
<p>You realize that there&rsquo;s whole areas of this earth</p>
<p>that have so much brilliance</p>
<p>but unfortunately so little opportunity.</p>
<p>And one of the exciting things about the 21st century</p>
<p>is more and more opportunities are created</p>
<p>and so the brilliance is unlocked</p>
<p>in all those different places.</p>
<p>And so all these young people now have the opportunity</p>
<p>to do something to change the world.</p>
<p>I had a chance to visit Bosnia.</p>
<p>So I was invited to give a talk</p>
<p>in a very northern most part of the country</p>
<p>that was impacted by the war tremendously.</p>
<p>And it was a public talk.</p>
<p>It was open to everybody in the village.</p>
<p>And I was told even people drew from Sarajevo to attend.</p>
<p>Whenever I think about our role as a scientist</p>
<p>or the beneficiaries of the knowledge that we create,</p>
<p>I always think about that night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how many people were in that room.</p>
<p>It was incredibly crowded.</p>
<p>And lots of young people who were trying</p>
<p>to start everything new and not do or not carry,</p>
<p>replace whatever maybe the feeling that was taken from them</p>
<p>with hope and love, start a new beginning,</p>
<p>be the seed for the next generation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s moved me so much that they all came</p>
<p>to hear about early life space,</p>
<p>something maybe different for them</p>
<p>that maybe they were always interested in</p>
<p>and never thought about.</p>
<p>But what stayed with me was just the look and the feeling,</p>
<p>the look on their faces and the feeling in the room,</p>
<p>the energy just was really moving to me.</p>
<p>Their willingness to be the seed,</p>
<p>the first of their family and generation</p>
<p>to do that big new thing.</p>
<p>Yes, and that&rsquo;s exactly why I&rsquo;m telling this whole story.</p>
<p>Because for most of us,</p>
<p>we may have to be that seed in our families,</p>
<p>the first one to do something new,</p>
<p>to break that cycle,</p>
<p>whatever it is that you want to break free from.</p>
<p>I would want the young people to know that you can be that,</p>
<p>that there are just wonderful things</p>
<p>to learn from this life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just incredible to be living.</p>
<p>And I would want them to know that their voice matters</p>
<p>and they need to use it,</p>
<p>especially those who think that their voice doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And ultimately, I think what it comes down to</p>
<p>is to trusting yourself,</p>
<p>trusting and respecting your voice.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not loved, learn how to love.</p>
<p>If you are not respected, start by respecting yourself.</p>
<p>Learn how to respect yourself.</p>
<p>You can teach yourself things.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really difficult</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re surrounded by people that don&rsquo;t believe in you.</p>
<p>Yes, I definitely know the feeling.</p>
<p>And I would just want them to know</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t need to be defined</p>
<p>or reduced down to what others see in them.</p>
<p>Believe in yourself, have the respect,</p>
<p>try to develop the respect and the love for yourself.</p>
<p>And then from that, it flourishes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find others that&rsquo;ll give you love.</p>
<p>It may not.</p>
<p>I mean, life is not fair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Be prepared that it&rsquo;s not very fair, unfortunately.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t wanna depict this Disney story</p>
<p>that, and then yes, and everything will be just fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly isn&rsquo;t, but you learn a way,</p>
<p>learn, you know, life does it all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaking of which,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning of all this?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>Why we are here?</p>
<p>All the beauty you&rsquo;ve discussed.</p>
<p>Why is the translational mechanism machinery here?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Why so much beauty?</p>
<p>Why so much beauty?</p>
<p>It is because we choose to see it that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>But there is no meaning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, no.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But why is it so beautiful?</p>
<p>Why did we choose?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>From where is the imperative to see it,</p>
<p>to see so much beauty in a thing</p>
<p>that scientifically speaking,</p>
<p>or from a rational perspective is void of beauty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it just is.</p>
<p>Not everybody chooses to see the beauty.</p>
<p>Haters gonna hate.</p>
<p>I mean, we have the capacity to see the beauty.</p>
<p>We have the capacity,</p>
<p>so why not use it to the fullest, right?</p>
<p>We have the capacity.</p>
<p>But that capacity, isn&rsquo;t that fascinating?</p>
<p>That we developed that?</p>
<p>It feels like that was always laid in there</p>
<p>in the whole process of life.</p>
<p>This ability to find, to introspect ourselves.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s definitely soothing to think like that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think there is a meaning like that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that we can understand it.</p>
<p>But why is it soothing?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a desire, there&rsquo;s a longing.</p>
<p>But soothing doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s a meaning.</p>
<p>Why is soothing a meaning?</p>
<p>Let me just put it this way.</p>
<p>Because there is just, I think,</p>
<p>so much unfairness going on,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even dare myself to think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a meaning out of respect</p>
<p>to the ones that are suffering.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>I think out of suffering emerges flourishing and beauty.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I see.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>When I went to Ukraine and saw all the people suffering</p>
<p>in their eyes and in their stories</p>
<p>is a hope for the future,</p>
<p>is a love for the people who are still living,</p>
<p>is a love for life.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the dark thing is the suffering</p>
<p>and the law somehow intensifies your appreciation</p>
<p>of the life that is still left.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weird thing too.</p>
<p>I think that there is something about</p>
<p>still doing your best</p>
<p>and believing that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>whatever the goodness is worth working for</p>
<p>is beyond.</p>
<p>And to do that without a meaning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something more humbling and profound about that.</p>
<p>And we have a,</p>
<p>this will come out very random.</p>
<p>Okay, so just in Turkish bathrooms,</p>
<p>there is this sign that says,</p>
<p>leave it as you want to find it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your meaning of life found in the Turkey.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s wisdom to that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s wisdom to that,</p>
<p>but it also is because however you leave defines you.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s some profound meaning to that too,</p>
<p>that just leave it as you would want to find it.</p>
<p>So that your little scribble in the long story</p>
<p>of life on earth is one that ultimately</p>
<p>did a pretty good job.</p>
<p>You know, it at least kept it the same as you found it.</p>
<p>Or at least I left it in the way that I wish I found it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, right.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the wisdom from Turkish bathrooms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I search for wisdom as well.</p>
<p>And as we started with the origin of life</p>
<p>and ended with the wisdom in a Turkish bathroom,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a perfect conversation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>The humor, the humanity,</p>
<p>but also the brilliance of your work.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that you would talk with me today.</p>
<p>This was really fun.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Batool Kachar.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with one of my favorite quotes</p>
<p>from Robert Frost.</p>
<p>In three words,</p>
<p>I can sum up everything I&rsquo;ve ever learned about life.</p>
<p>It goes on.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next time.</p>
