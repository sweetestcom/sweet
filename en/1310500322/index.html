    <p>Well, the source of energy at the origin of life</p>
<p>is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.</p>
<p>And amazingly, most of these reactions are exergonic,</p>
<p>which is to say they release energy.</p>
<p>If you have hydrogen and CO2,</p>
<p>and you put them together in a falcon tube</p>
<p>and you warm it up to say 50 degrees centigrade,</p>
<p>and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>But thermodynamically, that is less stable.</p>
<p>Two gases, hydrogen and CO2, is less stable than cells.</p>
<p>What should happen is you get cells coming out.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t that happen?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of the kinetic barriers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you need the spark.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Nick Lane,</p>
<p>a biochemist at University College London</p>
<p>and author of some of my favorite books</p>
<p>on biology, science, and life ever written,</p>
<p>including his two most recent titled</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Transformer,&rsquo; The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and the vital question, why is life the way it is?</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Nick Lane.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with perhaps the most mysterious,</p>
<p>the most interesting question that we little humans</p>
<p>can ask of ourselves.</p>
<p>How did life originate on Earth?</p>
<p>You could ask anybody working on the subject,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a different answer from all of them.</p>
<p>They will be pretty passionately held opinions,</p>
<p>and their opinions grounded in science,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still really, at this point, their opinions,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much stuff to know</p>
<p>that all we can ever do is get a small slice of it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the context which matters.</p>
<p>So I can give you my answer.</p>
<p>My answer is from a biologist&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p>That has been missing from the equation over decades,</p>
<p>which is, well, what does life do on Earth?</p>
<p>Why is it this way?</p>
<p>Why is it made of cells?</p>
<p>Why is it made of carbon?</p>
<p>Why is it powered by electrical charges on membranes?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these interesting questions about cells</p>
<p>that if you then look to see,</p>
<p>well, is there an environment on Earth,</p>
<p>on the early Earth four billion years ago,</p>
<p>that kind of matches the requirements of cells?</p>
<p>Well, there is one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very obvious one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically created by whenever you have</p>
<p>a wet, rocky planet, you get these hydrothermal vents,</p>
<p>which generate hydrogen gas in bucket loads,</p>
<p>and electrical charges on kind of cell like pores</p>
<p>that can drive the kind of chemistry that life does.</p>
<p>So it seems so beautiful and so obvious</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve spent the last 10 years or more</p>
<p>trying to do experiments.</p>
<p>It turns out to be difficult, of course.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s more difficult than you ever thought</p>
<p>it was gonna be, but it looks, I would say,</p>
<p>more true rather than less true over that 10 year period.</p>
<p>I think I have to take a step back every now and then</p>
<p>and think, hang on a minute, where&rsquo;s this going?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy it&rsquo;s going in a sensible direction.</p>
<p>And I think then you have these other interesting dilemmas.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m often accused of being too focused</p>
<p>on life on Earth, too kind of narrow minded</p>
<p>and inward looking, you might say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about carbon, I&rsquo;m talking about cells,</p>
<p>and maybe you or plenty of people can say to me,</p>
<p>ah, yeah, but life can be anything.</p>
<p>I have no imagination.</p>
<p>And maybe they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But unless we can say why life here is this way,</p>
<p>and if those reasons are fundamental reasons,</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re just trivial reasons,</p>
<p>then we can&rsquo;t answer that question.</p>
<p>So I think they&rsquo;re fundamental reasons,</p>
<p>and I think we need to worry about them.</p>
<p>Yeah, there might be some deep truth to the puzzle</p>
<p>here on Earth that will resonate</p>
<p>with other puzzles elsewhere that will,</p>
<p>solving this particular puzzle</p>
<p>will give us that deeper truth.</p>
<p>So what, to this puzzle, you said vents, hydrogen,</p>
<p>wet, so chemically, what is the potion here?</p>
<p>How important is oxygen?</p>
<p>You wrote a book about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I actually just came straight here</p>
<p>from a conference where I was chairing a session</p>
<p>on whether oxygen matters or not in the history of life.</p>
<p>Of course it matters, but it matters most</p>
<p>to the origin of life to be not there.</p>
<p>As I see it, we have this, I mean,</p>
<p>life is made of carbon, basically, primarily,</p>
<p>organic molecules with carbon, carbon bonds.</p>
<p>And the building block, the Lego brick</p>
<p>that we take out of the air or take out of the oceans</p>
<p>is carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>And to turn carbon dioxide into organic molecules,</p>
<p>we need to strap on hydrogen.</p>
<p>And so we need, and this is basically</p>
<p>what life is doing, it&rsquo;s hydrogenating carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking the hydrogen, the bubbles out of the earth</p>
<p>in these hydrothermal vents, and it sticks it on CO2.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of really as simple as that.</p>
<p>And actually, thermodynamically,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the thing that I find most troubling</p>
<p>is that if you do these experiments in the lab,</p>
<p>the molecules you get are exactly the molecules</p>
<p>that we see at the heart of biochemistry</p>
<p>in the heart of life.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about the earliest origins</p>
<p>of that little potion, that chemical process?</p>
<p>What really is the spark there?</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a spark.</p>
<p>There is a continuous chemical reaction.</p>
<p>And there is kind of a spark,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a continuous electrical charge</p>
<p>which helps drive that reaction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a literally spark.</p>
<p>Well, the charge at least, but yes.</p>
<p>I mean, a spark in that sense is,</p>
<p>we tend to think of in terms of Frankenstein,</p>
<p>we tend to think in terms of electricity</p>
<p>and one moment you zap something and it comes alive.</p>
<p>And what does that really mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s come alive and now what&rsquo;s sustaining it?</p>
<p>Well, we are sustained by oxygen,</p>
<p>by this continuous chemical reaction.</p>
<p>And if you put a plastic bag on your head,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got a minute or something before it&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>So some way of being able to leverage a source of energy.</p>
<p>Well, the source of energy at the origin of life</p>
<p>is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.</p>
<p>And amazingly, most of these reactions are exergonic,</p>
<p>which is to say they release energy.</p>
<p>If you have hydrogen and CO2</p>
<p>and you put them together in a falcon tube</p>
<p>and you warm it up to say 50 degrees centigrade</p>
<p>and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>But thermodynamically, that is less stable.</p>
<p>Two gases, hydrogen and CO2, is less stable than cells.</p>
<p>What should happen is you get cells coming out.</p>
<p>So why doesn&rsquo;t that happen?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of the kinetic barriers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you need the spark.</p>
<p>Is it possible that life originated</p>
<p>multiple times on Earth?</p>
<p>The way you describe it, you make it sound so easy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long distance to go from the first bits</p>
<p>of prebiotic chemistry to, say, molecular machines</p>
<p>like ribosomes.</p>
<p>Is that the first thing that you would say is life?</p>
<p>Like if I introduce you, the two of you at a party,</p>
<p>you would say that&rsquo;s a living thing?</p>
<p>I would say as soon as we introduce genes, information,</p>
<p>into systems that are growing anyway,</p>
<p>so I would talk about growing protocells,</p>
<p>as soon as we introduce even random bits of information</p>
<p>into there, I&rsquo;m thinking about RNA molecules, for example,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to have any information in it.</p>
<p>It can be a completely random sequence.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s introduced into a system which is in any case</p>
<p>growing and doubling itself and reproducing itself,</p>
<p>then any changes in that sequence that allow it</p>
<p>to do so better or worse are now selected</p>
<p>by perfectly normal natural selection.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a system.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when it becomes alive to my mind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s encompassed into like an object</p>
<p>that keeps information and evolves that information</p>
<p>over time or changes that information over time</p>
<p>in response to the.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always part of a cell system</p>
<p>from the very beginning.</p>
<p>So is your sense that it started only once</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s difficult or is it possibly started</p>
<p>in multiple locations on Earth?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible it started multiple occasions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two provisos to that.</p>
<p>One of them is oxygen makes it impossible really</p>
<p>for life to start.</p>
<p>So as soon as we&rsquo;ve got oxygen in the atmosphere,</p>
<p>then life isn&rsquo;t gonna keep starting over.</p>
<p>So I often get asked by people,</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t we have life starting?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s so easy, why can&rsquo;t life start in these vents now?</p>
<p>And the answer is if you want hydrogen to react with CO2</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s oxygen there, hydrogen reacts</p>
<p>with oxygen instead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you get an explosive reaction that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rocket fuel.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s never gonna happen.</p>
<p>But for the origin of life earlier than that,</p>
<p>all we know is that there&rsquo;s a single common ancestor</p>
<p>for all of life.</p>
<p>There could have been multiple origins</p>
<p>and they all just disappeared.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a very interesting deep split in life</p>
<p>between bacteria and what are called archaea,</p>
<p>which look just the same as bacteria.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not quite as diverse, but nearly.</p>
<p>And they are very different in their biochemistry.</p>
<p>And so any explanation for the origin of life</p>
<p>has to account as well for why they&rsquo;re so different</p>
<p>and yet so similar.</p>
<p>And that makes me think that life probably</p>
<p>did arise only once.</p>
<p>Can you describe the difference that&rsquo;s interesting there?</p>
<p>Well, how they&rsquo;re similar, how they&rsquo;re different?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re different in their membranes primarily.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different in things like DNA replication.</p>
<p>They use completely different enzymes</p>
<p>and the genes behind it for replicating DNA.</p>
<p>So they both have membranes, both have DNA replication.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The process of that is different.</p>
<p>They both have DNA.</p>
<p>The genetic code is identical in them both.</p>
<p>The way in which it&rsquo;s transcribed into RNA,</p>
<p>into the copy of a gene,</p>
<p>and the way that that&rsquo;s then translated into a protein,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all basically the same in both of these groups.</p>
<p>So they clearly share a common ancestor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re different</p>
<p>in fundamental ways as well.</p>
<p>And if you think about, well,</p>
<p>what kind of processes could drive that divergence</p>
<p>very early on?</p>
<p>I can think about it in terms of membranes,</p>
<p>in terms of the electrical charges on membranes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that that makes me think that there was probably,</p>
<p>there were probably many unsuccessful attempts</p>
<p>but only one really successful attempt.</p>
<p>Can you explain why that divergence</p>
<p>makes you think there&rsquo;s one common ancestor?</p>
<p>Okay, can you describe that intuition?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit unclear about why the divert,</p>
<p>like the leap from the divergence means there&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>Do you mean like the divergence indicates</p>
<p>that there was a big invention at that time from one source?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d got, as I imagine it,</p>
<p>you have a common ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say there are millions of vents</p>
<p>and millions of potential common ancestors</p>
<p>living in all of those vents,</p>
<p>but only one of them makes it out first.</p>
<p>Then you could imagine that that cell</p>
<p>is then gonna kind of take over the world</p>
<p>and wipe out everything else.</p>
<p>And so what you would see would be</p>
<p>a single common ancestor for all of life.</p>
<p>But with lots of different vent systems</p>
<p>all kind of vying to create the first life forms,</p>
<p>you might say.</p>
<p>So this thing is a cell, a single cell organism.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always talking about populations of cells, but yes.</p>
<p>These are single celled organisms.</p>
<p>But the fundamental life form is a single cell, right?</p>
<p>So like, or, so they&rsquo;re always together</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re alone together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a machinery in each one individual component</p>
<p>that if left by itself would still work, right?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the unit of selection is a single cell.</p>
<p>But selection operates over generations</p>
<p>and changes over generations in populations of cells.</p>
<p>So it would be impossible to say that a cell</p>
<p>is the unit of selection in the sense that</p>
<p>unless you have a population, you can&rsquo;t evolve,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Right, but there was one Chuck Norris,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an American reference cell</p>
<p>that made it out of the vents, right?</p>
<p>Or like the first one.</p>
<p>So imagine then that there&rsquo;s one cell gets out</p>
<p>and it takes over the world.</p>
<p>It gets out in the water, it&rsquo;s like floating around.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re deep in the ocean somewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But actually two cells got out</p>
<p>and they appear to have got out from the same vent</p>
<p>because they both share the same code and everything else.</p>
<p>So unless all the, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a million different common ancestors</p>
<p>in all these different vents.</p>
<p>So either they all have the same code</p>
<p>and two cells spontaneously merge from different places</p>
<p>or two different cells, fundamentally different cells</p>
<p>came from the same place.</p>
<p>So either way, what are the constraints that say,</p>
<p>not just one came out or not half a million came out,</p>
<p>but two came out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a bit strange.</p>
<p>So how did they come out?</p>
<p>Well, they come out because what are you doing inside a vent</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re relying on the electrical charges down there</p>
<p>to power this reaction between hydrogen and CO2</p>
<p>to make yourself grow.</p>
<p>And when you leave the vent, you&rsquo;ve got to do that yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to power up your own membrane.</p>
<p>And so the question is,</p>
<p>well, how do you power up your own membrane?</p>
<p>And the answer is, well, you need to pump.</p>
<p>You need to pump ions to give an electrical charge</p>
<p>on the membrane.</p>
<p>So what do the pumps look like?</p>
<p>Well, the pumps look different in these two groups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if they both emerged from a common ancestor.</p>
<p>As soon as you&rsquo;ve got that ancestor,</p>
<p>things move very quickly and divergently.</p>
<p>Why does the DNA replication look different?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s joined to the membrane.</p>
<p>The membranes are different.</p>
<p>The DNA replication is different</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s joined to a different kind of membrane.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s interesting, this is detail, you may say,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also fundamental</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s about the two big divergent groups</p>
<p>of life on Earth that seem to have diverged really early on.</p>
<p>And it all started from one organism.</p>
<p>And then that organism just start replicating</p>
<p>the heck out of itself with some mutation of the DNA.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s some, there&rsquo;s a competition</p>
<p>through the process of evolution.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not like trying to beat each other up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, they&rsquo;re just trying to live.</p>
<p>Just replicate us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you know, let&rsquo;s not minimize there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just trying to chill.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to relax up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, but there&rsquo;s no sense of trying to survive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re replicating.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no sense</p>
<p>in which they&rsquo;re trying to do anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just kind of an outgrowth of the Earth,</p>
<p>you might say.</p>
<p>Of course, the aliens would describe us humans</p>
<p>in that same way.</p>
<p>They might be right.</p>
<p>This primitive life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just ants that are hairless,</p>
<p>mostly hairless.</p>
<p>Overgrown ants.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What do you think about the idea of panspermia</p>
<p>that the theory that life did not originate on Earth</p>
<p>and was planted here from outer space?</p>
<p>Or pseudopanspermia, which is like the basic ingredients,</p>
<p>the magic that you mentioned was planted here</p>
<p>from elsewhere in space?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t find them helpful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>So, pseudotranspermia, the idea that the chemicals,</p>
<p>the amino acids, the nucleotides</p>
<p>are being delivered from space.</p>
<p>Well, we know that happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unequivocal.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re delivered on meteorites, comets, and so on.</p>
<p>So what do they do next?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, to me, the question.</p>
<p>Well, what do they do is they stock a soup.</p>
<p>Presumably, they land in a pond or in an ocean</p>
<p>or wherever they land.</p>
<p>And then you end up with a best possible case scenario</p>
<p>is you end up with a soup of nucleotides</p>
<p>and amino acids.</p>
<p>And then you have to say, so now what happens?</p>
<p>And the answer is, oh, well, they have to go,</p>
<p>bloop, become alive.</p>
<p>So how did they do that?</p>
<p>And you may as well say then a miracle happened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in soup.</p>
<p>I think what we have in event is a continuous conversion,</p>
<p>a continuous growth, a continuous reaction,</p>
<p>a continuous converting a flow of molecules</p>
<p>into more of yourself, you might say,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a small bit.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a kind of continuous self organization</p>
<p>and growth from the very beginning.</p>
<p>You never have that in a soup.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the entire universe and living organisms</p>
<p>in the universe, isn&rsquo;t it just soup all the way down?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it all soup?</p>
<p>No, no, I mean, soup almost by definition</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a structure.</p>
<p>But soup is a collection of ingredients</p>
<p>that are like randomly interacting.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they&rsquo;re not random.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, I mean, we have chemistry going on here.</p>
<p>We have metal grains forming, which are, you know,</p>
<p>effective oil water interactions.</p>
<p>Okay, so it feels like there&rsquo;s a direction to a process,</p>
<p>like a directed process.</p>
<p>There are directions to processes, yeah.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re starting with CO2</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got two reactive fluids being brought together</p>
<p>and they react, what are they gonna make?</p>
<p>Well, they make carboxylic acids,</p>
<p>which include the fatty acids</p>
<p>that make up the cell membranes.</p>
<p>And they form directly into bilayer membranes.</p>
<p>They form like soap bubbles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spontaneous organization caused by the nature</p>
<p>of the molecules.</p>
<p>And those things are capable of growing</p>
<p>and are capable in effect of being selected</p>
<p>even before there are genes.</p>
<p>We have this, so we have a lot of order</p>
<p>and that order is coming from thermodynamics.</p>
<p>And the thermodynamics is always about increasing</p>
<p>the entropy of the universe.</p>
<p>But if you have oil and water and they&rsquo;re separating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re increasing the entropy of the universe,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;ve got some order,</p>
<p>which is the soap and the water are not missable.</p>
<p>Now, to come back to your first question</p>
<p>about panspermia properly,</p>
<p>that just pushes the question somewhere else.</p>
<p>That just, even if it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>maybe life did start on Earth by panspermia.</p>
<p>So what are the principles</p>
<p>that govern the emergence of life on any planet?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an assumption that life started here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an assumption that it started</p>
<p>in a hydrothermal vent or it started</p>
<p>in a terrestrial geothermal system.</p>
<p>The question is, can we work out a testable sequence</p>
<p>of events that would lead from one to the other one</p>
<p>and then test it and see if there&rsquo;s any truth in it or not?</p>
<p>With panspermia, you can&rsquo;t do any of that.</p>
<p>But the fundamental question of panspermia is,</p>
<p>do we have the machine here on Earth to build life?</p>
<p>Is the vents enough?</p>
<p>Is oxygen and hydrogen and whatever the heck else we want</p>
<p>and some source of energy and heat,</p>
<p>is that enough to build life?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, of course you would say that as a human.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But there could be aliens right now</p>
<p>chuckling at that idea.</p>
<p>Maybe you need some special sauce,</p>
<p>special elsewhere sauce.</p>
<p>So your sense is we have everything here.</p>
<p>I mean, this is precisely the question.</p>
<p>I like to, when I&rsquo;m talking in schools,</p>
<p>I like to start out with the idea</p>
<p>of we can make a time machine.</p>
<p>We go back four billion years</p>
<p>and we go to these environments that people talk about.</p>
<p>We go to a deep sea hydrothermal vent,</p>
<p>we go to a kind of Yellowstone Park type place environment</p>
<p>and we find some slime that looks like we can test it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made of organic molecules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a structure which is not obviously cells,</p>
<p>but you know, is this a stepping stone</p>
<p>on the way to life or not?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do we know?</p>
<p>Unless we&rsquo;ve got an intellectual framework</p>
<p>that says this is a stepping stone and that&rsquo;s not a step.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;d never know.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t know which environment to go to,</p>
<p>what to look for, how to say this.</p>
<p>So all we can ever hope for,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re never gonna build that time machine,</p>
<p>is to have an intellectual framework</p>
<p>that can explain step by step, experiment by experiment,</p>
<p>how we go from a sterile inorganic planet</p>
<p>to living cells as we know them.</p>
<p>And in that framework, every time you have a choice,</p>
<p>it could be this way or it could be that way,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s lots of possible forks down that road.</p>
<p>Did it have to be that way?</p>
<p>Could it have been the other way?</p>
<p>And would that have given you life</p>
<p>with very different properties?</p>
<p>And so if you come up with a, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a long hypothesis, because as I say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going from really simple prebiotic chemistry</p>
<p>all the way through to genes and molecular machines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long, long pathway.</p>
<p>And nobody in the field would agree on the order</p>
<p>in which these things happened,</p>
<p>which is not a bad thing,</p>
<p>because it means that you have to go out</p>
<p>and do some experiments and try and demonstrate</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s possible or not possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so freaking amazing that it happened though.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s a direction to the thing.</p>
<p>Can you try to answer from a framework perspective</p>
<p>of what is life?</p>
<p>So you said there&rsquo;s some order and yet there&rsquo;s complexity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not perfectly ordered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not boring.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still some fun in it.</p>
<p>And it also feels like the processes have a direction</p>
<p>through the selection mechanism.</p>
<p>They seem to be building something,</p>
<p>always better, always improving.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a perception.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our romanticization of things are always better.</p>
<p>Things are getting better, we&rsquo;d like to believe that.</p>
<p>I mean, you think about the world</p>
<p>from the point of view of bacteria</p>
<p>and bacteria are the first things to emerge</p>
<p>from whatever environment they came from.</p>
<p>And they dominated the planet very, very quickly.</p>
<p>And they haven&rsquo;t really changed.</p>
<p>Four billion years later, they look exactly the same.</p>
<p>So about four billion years ago,</p>
<p>bacteria started to really run the show.</p>
<p>And then nothing happened for a while.</p>
<p>Nothing happened for two billion years.</p>
<p>Then after two billion years,</p>
<p>we see another single event origin, if you like,</p>
<p>of our own type of cell, the eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p>So cells with a nucleus and lots of stuff going on inside.</p>
<p>Another singular origin.</p>
<p>It only happened once in the history of life on earth.</p>
<p>Maybe it happened multiple times and there&rsquo;s no evidence.</p>
<p>Everything just disappeared,</p>
<p>but we have to at least take it seriously</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something that stops bacteria</p>
<p>from becoming more complex because they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fact that they emerged four billion years ago.</p>
<p>And something happened two billion years ago,</p>
<p>but the bacteria themselves didn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>They remain bacterial.</p>
<p>So there is no trajectory, necessary trajectory</p>
<p>towards great complexity in human beings at the end of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to imagine that without photosynthesis</p>
<p>arising or without eukaryotes arising,</p>
<p>that a planet could be full of bacteria and nothing else.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to that because that&rsquo;s a brilliant invention.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few brilliant invention along the way.</p>
<p>But what is life?</p>
<p>If you were to show up on earth,</p>
<p>but to take that time machine,</p>
<p>and you said, asking yourself the question,</p>
<p>is this a stepping stone towards life?</p>
<p>As you step along, when you see the early bacteria,</p>
<p>how would you know it&rsquo;s life?</p>
<p>And then this is really important question</p>
<p>when you go to other planets and look for life.</p>
<p>Like what is the framework of telling a difference</p>
<p>between a rock and a bacteria?</p>
<p>I mean, the question&rsquo;s kind of both impossible to answer</p>
<p>and trivial at the same time.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like to answer it</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think there is an answer.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re trying to describe the process of time.</p>
<p>Those are the most fun questions.</p>
<p>What do you mean there&rsquo;s no answer?</p>
<p>No, there is no answer.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s lots of,</p>
<p>there are at least 40 or 50 different definitions</p>
<p>of life out there.</p>
<p>And most of them are, well, obviously bad</p>
<p>in one way or another.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s freaks.</p>
<p>I can never remember the exact words that people use,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a NASA working definition of life,</p>
<p>which more or less says a system,</p>
<p>which is capable of self sustaining system,</p>
<p>capable of evolution or something along those lines.</p>
<p>And I immediately have a problem</p>
<p>with the word self sustaining</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s sustained by the environment.</p>
<p>And I know what they&rsquo;re getting at.</p>
<p>I know what they&rsquo;re trying to say,</p>
<p>but I pick a hole in that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always wags who say,</p>
<p>but you know, by that definition, a rabbit is not alive.</p>
<p>Only a pair of rabbits would be alive</p>
<p>because a single rabbit is incapable of copying itself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of pedantic, silly,</p>
<p>but also important objections to any hypothesis.</p>
<p>The real question is what is, you know,</p>
<p>we can argue all day or people do argue all day</p>
<p>about is a virus alive or not?</p>
<p>And it depends on the content.</p>
<p>Most biologists could not agree about that.</p>
<p>So then what about a jumping gene,</p>
<p>a retro element or something that is even simpler</p>
<p>than a virus, but it&rsquo;s capable of converting</p>
<p>its environment into a copy of itself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about as close, this is not a definition,</p>
<p>but this is a kind of a description of life</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s able to parasitize the environment.</p>
<p>And that goes for plants as well as animals</p>
<p>and bacteria and viruses to make a relatively exact copy</p>
<p>of themselves, informationally exact copy of themselves.</p>
<p>By the way, it doesn&rsquo;t really have to be</p>
<p>a copy of itself, right?</p>
<p>It just has to be, you have to create something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting, the way evolution is.</p>
<p>So it is extremely powerful process of evolution,</p>
<p>which is basically make a copy of yourself</p>
<p>and sometimes mess up a little bit.</p>
<p>That seems to work really well.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to mess up big time</p>
<p>as a standard, as a default.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a hopeful monster and in principle it can.</p>
<p>Actually, it turns out, I would say that this is due</p>
<p>a reemergence, this is some amazing work</p>
<p>from Michael Levin, I don&rsquo;t know if you came across him,</p>
<p>but if you haven&rsquo;t interviewed him,</p>
<p>you should interview him about, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to him in a few days.</p>
<p>Oh, fantastic.</p>
<p>So I mentioned, there&rsquo;s two people that Andre,</p>
<p>if I may mention, Andre Kapathe is a friend</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s really admired in the AI community,</p>
<p>said you absolutely must talk to Michael and to Nick.</p>
<p>So of course, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m really fortunate that we can actually</p>
<p>make this happen.</p>
<p>Anyway, you were saying?</p>
<p>Well, Michael Levin is doing amazing work,</p>
<p>basically about the way in which electrical fields</p>
<p>control development and he&rsquo;s done some work</p>
<p>with planarian worms, so flat worms,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;ll tell you all about this,</p>
<p>so I won&rsquo;t say any more than the minimum,</p>
<p>but basically you can cut their head off</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll redevelop a different, a new head.</p>
<p>But the head that they develop depends,</p>
<p>if you knock out just one iron pump in a membrane,</p>
<p>so you change the electrical circuitry just a little bit,</p>
<p>you can come up with a completely different head.</p>
<p>It can be a head which is similar to those</p>
<p>that diverged 150 million years ago</p>
<p>or it can be a head which no one&rsquo;s ever seen before,</p>
<p>a different kind of head.</p>
<p>Now that is really, you might say, a hopeful monster.</p>
<p>This is a kind of leap into a different direction.</p>
<p>The only question for natural selection is does it work?</p>
<p>Is the change itself feasible as a single change?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes, it&rsquo;s just a small change</p>
<p>to a single gene.</p>
<p>And the second thing is it gives rise</p>
<p>to a completely different morphology.</p>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<p>And if it works, that can easily be a shift.</p>
<p>But for it to be a speciation, for it to continue,</p>
<p>for it to give rise to a different morphology over time,</p>
<p>then it has to be perpetuated.</p>
<p>So that shift, that change in that one gene</p>
<p>has to work well enough that it is selected and it goes on.</p>
<p>And copied enough times to where you can really test it.</p>
<p>So the likelihood, it would be lost,</p>
<p>but there will be some occasions where it survives.</p>
<p>And yes, the idea that we can have sudden, fairly abrupt</p>
<p>changes in evolution, I think it&rsquo;s time for a rebirth.</p>
<p>What about this idea that kind of trying to</p>
<p>mathematize a definition of life and saying how many steps,</p>
<p>the shortest amount of steps it takes to build the thing,</p>
<p>almost like an engineering view of it?</p>
<p>Ah, I like that view.</p>
<p>Because I think that in a sense, that&rsquo;s not very far away</p>
<p>from what a hypothesis needs to do</p>
<p>to be a testable hypothesis for the origin of life.</p>
<p>You need to spell out, here&rsquo;s each step,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the experiment to do for each step.</p>
<p>The idea that we can do it in the lab,</p>
<p>some people say, oh, we&rsquo;ll have created life</p>
<p>within five years, but ask them what they mean by life.</p>
<p>We have a planet four billion years ago</p>
<p>with these vent systems across the entire surface</p>
<p>of the planet, and we have millions of years if we wanted.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that we&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>millions of years.</p>
<p>I have a feeling we&rsquo;re talking about maybe millions</p>
<p>of nanoseconds or picoseconds.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about chemistry, which is happening quickly.</p>
<p>But we still need to constrain those steps,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve got a planet doing similar chemistry.</p>
<p>You asked about a trajectory.</p>
<p>The trajectory is the planetary trajectory.</p>
<p>The planet has properties.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s got a lot of iron at the center of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a lot of electrons at the center of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more oxidized on the outside,</p>
<p>partly because of the sun and partly because the heat</p>
<p>of volcanoes puts out oxidized gases.</p>
<p>So the planet is a battery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant battery, and we have a flow of electrons</p>
<p>going from inside to outside in these hydrothermal vents,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the same topology that a cell has.</p>
<p>A cell is basically just a micro version of the planet,</p>
<p>and there is a trajectory in all of that,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an inevitability that certain types</p>
<p>of chemical reaction are going to be favored over others,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an inevitability in what happens in water,</p>
<p>the chemistry that happens in water.</p>
<p>Some will be immiscible with water and will form membranes</p>
<p>and will form insoluble structures,</p>
<p>and nobody really understands water very well,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s another big question.</p>
<p>For experiments on the origin of life, what do you put it in?</p>
<p>What kind of structure do we want to induce in this water?</p>
<p>Because the last thing it&rsquo;s likely to be</p>
<p>is just kind of bulk water.</p>
<p>How fundamental is water to life, would you say?</p>
<p>I would say pretty fundamental.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t like to say it&rsquo;s impossible for life</p>
<p>to start any other way, but water is everywhere.</p>
<p>Water&rsquo;s extremely good at what it does,</p>
<p>and carbon works in water especially well.</p>
<p>So those things, and carbon is everywhere.</p>
<p>So those things together make me think probabilistically,</p>
<p>if we found a thousand life forms, 995 of them</p>
<p>would be carbon based and living in water.</p>
<p>Now the reverse question, if you found a puddle of water</p>
<p>elsewhere and some carbon, no, just a puddle of water.</p>
<p>Is a puddle of water a pretty damn good indication</p>
<p>that life either exists here or has once existed here?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t work the other way.</p>
<p>I think you need a living planet.</p>
<p>You need a planet which is capable</p>
<p>of turning over its surface.</p>
<p>It needs to be a planet with water.</p>
<p>It needs to be capable of bringing those electrons</p>
<p>from inside to the outside.</p>
<p>It needs to turn over its surface.</p>
<p>It needs to make that water work and turn it into hydrogen.</p>
<p>So I think you need a living planet.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;ve got the living planet,</p>
<p>I think the rest of it is kind of thermodynamics all the way.</p>
<p>So if you were to run Earth over a million times up</p>
<p>to this point, maybe beyond, to the end,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s run it to the end, what is it?</p>
<p>How much variety is there?</p>
<p>You kind of spoke to this trajectory</p>
<p>that the environment dictates chemically,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know in which other way, spiritually,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like dictates kind of the direction</p>
<p>of this giant machine that seems chaotic,</p>
<p>but it does seem to have order in the steps it&rsquo;s taking.</p>
<p>How often will life, how often will bacteria emerge?</p>
<p>How often will something like humans emerge?</p>
<p>How much variety do you think there would be?</p>
<p>I think at the level of bacteria, not much variety.</p>
<p>I think we would get, that&rsquo;s how many times</p>
<p>you say you want to run it, a million times.</p>
<p>I would say at least a few hundred thousand will get bacteria again.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, nice.</p>
<p>Because I think there&rsquo;s some level of inevitability</p>
<p>that a wet rocky planet will give rise</p>
<p>through the same processes to something very close.</p>
<p>I think this is not something I&rsquo;d have thought</p>
<p>a few years ago, but working with a PhD student</p>
<p>of mine, Stuart Harrison, he&rsquo;s been thinking</p>
<p>about the genetic code, and we&rsquo;ve just been publishing</p>
<p>on that, there are patterns that you can discern in the code,</p>
<p>or he has discerned in the code,</p>
<p>that if you think about them in terms of,</p>
<p>we start with CO2 and hydrogen,</p>
<p>and these are the first steps of biochemistry,</p>
<p>you come up with a code which is very similar</p>
<p>to the code that we see.</p>
<p>So it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me any longer</p>
<p>if we found life on Mars and it had a genetic code</p>
<p>that was not very different to the genetic code</p>
<p>that we have here, without it just being transferred across.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some inevitability about the whole</p>
<p>of the beginnings of life, in my view.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really promising, because if the basic chemistry</p>
<p>is tightly linked to the genetic code,</p>
<p>that means we can interact with other life</p>
<p>if it exists out there.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s potentially.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really exciting, if that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Okay, but then bacteria.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got bacteria.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How easy is photosynthesis?</p>
<p>Much harder, I would say.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s actually go there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through the inventions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is photosynthesis?</p>
<p>And why is it hard?</p>
<p>Well, there are different forms.</p>
<p>I mean, basically, you&rsquo;re taking hydrogen</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sticking it onto CO2,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s powered by the sun.</p>
<p>Question is, where are you taking the hydrogen from?</p>
<p>And in photosynthesis that we know in plants,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming from water.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re using the power of the sun to split water,</p>
<p>take out the hydrogen, stick it onto CO2,</p>
<p>and the oxygen is a waste product,</p>
<p>and you just throw it out, throw it away.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the single greatest planetary pollution event</p>
<p>in the whole history of the Earth.</p>
<p>The pollutant being oxygen.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>It also made possible animals.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have large, active animals</p>
<p>without an oxygenated atmosphere,</p>
<p>at least not in the sense that we know on Earth.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really big invention</p>
<p>in the history of Earth. Huge invention, yes.</p>
<p>And it happened once.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few things that happen once on Earth,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re always stuck with this problem.</p>
<p>Once it happened, did it become so good so quickly</p>
<p>that it precluded the same thing happening ever again?</p>
<p>Or are there other reasons?</p>
<p>And we really have to look at each one in turn</p>
<p>and think, why did it only happen once?</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s really difficult to split water.</p>
<p>It requires a lot of power,</p>
<p>and that power, you&rsquo;re effectively separating charge</p>
<p>across a membrane, and the way in which you do it,</p>
<p>if it doesn&rsquo;t all rush back</p>
<p>and kind of cause an explosion right at the site,</p>
<p>requires really careful wiring.</p>
<p>And that wiring, it can&rsquo;t be easy to get it right</p>
<p>because the plants that we see around us,</p>
<p>they have chloroplasts.</p>
<p>Those chloroplasts were cyanobacteria ones.</p>
<p>Those cyanobacteria are the only group of bacteria</p>
<p>that can do that type of photosynthesis.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s plenty of opportunity.</p>
<p>So not even many bacteria.</p>
<p>So who invented photosynthesis?</p>
<p>The cyanobacteria, or their ancestors.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not many?</p>
<p>No other bacteria can do</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called oxygenic photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Lots of other bacteria can split.</p>
<p>I mean, you can take your hydrogen from somewhere else.</p>
<p>You can take it from hydrogen sulfide</p>
<p>bubbling out of a hydrothermal vent.</p>
<p>Grab your two hydrogens.</p>
<p>The sulfur is the waste now.</p>
<p>You can do it from iron.</p>
<p>You can take electrons.</p>
<p>So the early oceans were probably full of iron.</p>
<p>You can take an electron from ferrous iron,</p>
<p>so iron two plus and make it iron three plus,</p>
<p>which now precipitates as rust,</p>
<p>and you take a proton from the acidic early ocean,</p>
<p>stick it there.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve got a hydrogen atom.</p>
<p>Stick it onto CO2.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve just done the trick.</p>
<p>The trouble is you bury yourself in rusty iron.</p>
<p>And with sulfur, you can bury yourself in sulfur.</p>
<p>One of the reasons oxygenic photosynthesis</p>
<p>is so much better is that the waste product is oxygen,</p>
<p>which just bubbles away.</p>
<p>That seems like extremely unlikely,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s extremely essential</p>
<p>for the evolution of complex organisms</p>
<p>because of all the oxygen.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that didn&rsquo;t accumulate quickly either.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s converting, what is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s converting energy from the sun</p>
<p>and the resource of water</p>
<p>into the resource needed for animals.</p>
<p>Both resources needed for animals.</p>
<p>We need to eat, and we need to burn the food,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re eating plants,</p>
<p>which are getting their energy from the sun,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re burning it with their waste product,</p>
<p>which is the oxygen.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of circularity in that,</p>
<p>but without an oxygenated planet,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t really have predation.</p>
<p>You can have animals,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t really have animals</p>
<p>that go around and eat each other.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have ecosystems as we know them.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s actually step back.</p>
<p>What about eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cells, prokaryotes?</p>
<p>What are each of those,</p>
<p>and how big of an invention is that?</p>
<p>I personally think that&rsquo;s the single biggest invention</p>
<p>in the whole history of life.</p>
<p>Exciting.</p>
<p>So what are they?</p>
<p>Can you explain?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mentioned bacteria and archaea.</p>
<p>These are both prokaryotes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically small cells that don&rsquo;t have a nucleus.</p>
<p>If you look at them under a microscope,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see much going on.</p>
<p>If you look at them under a super resolution microscope,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re fantastically complex.</p>
<p>In terms of their molecular machinery, they&rsquo;re amazing.</p>
<p>In terms of their morphological appearance</p>
<p>under a microscope, they&rsquo;re really small and really simple.</p>
<p>The earliest life that we can physically see</p>
<p>on the planet are stromatolites,</p>
<p>which are made by things like cyanobacteria,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re large superstructures.</p>
<p>Effectively, biofilms plated on top of each other,</p>
<p>and you end up with quite large structures</p>
<p>that you can see in the fossil record.</p>
<p>But they never came up with animals.</p>
<p>They never came up with plants.</p>
<p>They came up with multicellular things,</p>
<p>filamentous cyanobacteria, for example.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just long strings of cells.</p>
<p>But the origin of the eukaryotic cell</p>
<p>seems to have been what&rsquo;s called an endosymbiosis,</p>
<p>so one cell gets inside another cell.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s transformed</p>
<p>the energetic possibilities of life.</p>
<p>So what we end up with is a kind of supercharged cell,</p>
<p>which can have a much larger nucleus</p>
<p>with many more genes, all supported.</p>
<p>If you think about it, you could think about it</p>
<p>as multi bacterial power without the overhead.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a cell and it&rsquo;s got bacteria living in it,</p>
<p>and those bacteria are providing it</p>
<p>with the energy currency it needs.</p>
<p>But each bacterium has a genome of its own,</p>
<p>which costs a fair amount of energy to express,</p>
<p>to kind of turn over and convert into proteins and so on.</p>
<p>What the mitochondria did,</p>
<p>which are these power packs in our own cells,</p>
<p>they were bacteria once,</p>
<p>and they threw away virtually all their genes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve only got a few left.</p>
<p>So mitochondria is, like you said,</p>
<p>is the bacteria that got inside a cell</p>
<p>and then throw away all this stuff it doesn&rsquo;t need to,</p>
<p>survive inside the cell, and then kept what?</p>
<p>So what we end up with,</p>
<p>so it kept always a handful of genes.</p>
<p>In our own case, 37 genes.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a few protists, which are single celled things</p>
<p>that have got as many as 70 or 80 genes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not always the same, but it&rsquo;s always a small number.</p>
<p>And you can think of it as a paired down power pack</p>
<p>where the control unit has really been,</p>
<p>has been kind of paired down to almost nothing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re putting out the same power,</p>
<p>but the investment in the overheads is really paired down.</p>
<p>That means that you can support</p>
<p>a much larger nuclear genome.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve gone up in the number of genes,</p>
<p>but also the amount of power you have</p>
<p>to convert those genes into proteins.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone up about fourfold in the number of genes,</p>
<p>but in terms of the size of genomes</p>
<p>and your ability to make the building blocks,</p>
<p>make the proteins, we&rsquo;ve gone up 100,000 fold or more.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s huge step change in the possibilities of evolution.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting then that the only two occasions</p>
<p>that complex life has arisen on Earth,</p>
<p>plants and animals,</p>
<p>fungi you could say are complex as well,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t form such complex morphology</p>
<p>as plants and animals.</p>
<p>Start with a single cell.</p>
<p>They start with an oocyte and a sperm</p>
<p>fused together to make a zygote.</p>
<p>So we start development with a single cell</p>
<p>and all the cells in the organism have identical DNA.</p>
<p>And you switch off in the brain,</p>
<p>you switch off these genes and you switch on those genes</p>
<p>and liver, you switch off those</p>
<p>and you switch on a different set.</p>
<p>And the standard evolutionary explanation for that</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re restricting conflict.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a load of genetically different cells</p>
<p>that are all fighting each other.</p>
<p>And so it works.</p>
<p>The trouble with bacteria, they form these biofilms</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all genetically different.</p>
<p>And effectively they&rsquo;re incapable</p>
<p>of that level of cooperation.</p>
<p>They would get in a fight.</p>
<p>Okay, so why is this such a difficult invention</p>
<p>of getting this bacteria inside</p>
<p>and becoming an engine which the mitochondria is?</p>
<p>Why do you assign it such great importance?</p>
<p>Is it great importance in terms of the difficulty</p>
<p>of how it was to achieve or great importance</p>
<p>in terms of the impact it had on life?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>It had a huge impact on life</p>
<p>because if that had not happened,</p>
<p>you can be certain that life on earth</p>
<p>would be bacterial only.</p>
<p>And that took a really long time too.</p>
<p>It took 2 billion years.</p>
<p>And it hasn&rsquo;t happened since to the best of our knowledge.</p>
<p>So it looks as if it&rsquo;s genuinely difficult.</p>
<p>And if you think about it then</p>
<p>from just an informational perspective,</p>
<p>you think bacteria have got,</p>
<p>they structure their information differently.</p>
<p>So a bacterial cell has a small genome,</p>
<p>you might have 4,000 genes in it,</p>
<p>but a single E. coli cell has access</p>
<p>to about 30,000 genes potentially.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a kind of metagenome</p>
<p>where other E. coli out there</p>
<p>have got different gene sets</p>
<p>and they can switch them around between themselves.</p>
<p>And so you can generate a huge amount of variation</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got more,</p>
<p>an E. coli metagenome is larger than the human genome.</p>
<p>We own 20,000 genes or something.</p>
<p>So, and they&rsquo;ve had 4 billion years of evolution</p>
<p>to work out what can I do</p>
<p>and what can&rsquo;t I do with this metagenome?</p>
<p>And the answer is you&rsquo;re stuck, you&rsquo;re still bacteria.</p>
<p>So they have explored genetic sequence space</p>
<p>far more thoroughly than eukaryotes ever did</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve had twice as long at least</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got much larger populations</p>
<p>and they never got around this problem.</p>
<p>So why can&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>It seems as if you can&rsquo;t solve it with information alone.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is structure.</p>
<p>If the very first cells needed an electrical charge</p>
<p>on their membrane to grow and in bacteria,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the outer membrane that surrounds the cell</p>
<p>which is electrically charged.</p>
<p>You try and scale that up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a fundamental design problem,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got an engineering problem.</p>
<p>And there are examples of it</p>
<p>and what we see in all these cases</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s known as extreme polyploidy,</p>
<p>which is to say they have tens of thousands of copies</p>
<p>of their complete genome,</p>
<p>which is energetically hugely expensive</p>
<p>and you end up with a large bacteria</p>
<p>with no further development.</p>
<p>What you need is to incorporate</p>
<p>these electrically charged power pack units inside</p>
<p>with their control units intact</p>
<p>and for them not to conflict so much with the host cell</p>
<p>that it all goes wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps it goes wrong more often than not.</p>
<p>And then you change the topology of the cell.</p>
<p>Now you don&rsquo;t necessarily have any more DNA</p>
<p>than a giant bacterium with extreme polyploidy,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;ve got is an asymmetry.</p>
<p>You now have a giant nuclear genome</p>
<p>which surrounded by lots of subsidiary energetic genomes</p>
<p>that do all the, they&rsquo;re the control units</p>
<p>that are doing all the control of energy generation.</p>
<p>Could this have been done gradually</p>
<p>or does it have to be done,</p>
<p>the power pack has to be all intact</p>
<p>and ready to go and working?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a kind of step change</p>
<p>in the possibilities of evolution,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna still require multiple, multiple generations.</p>
<p>So it could take millions of years.</p>
<p>It could take shorter times.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another thing I would like to put the number of steps</p>
<p>and try and work out what&rsquo;s required at each step.</p>
<p>And we are trying to do that with sex for example.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have a very large genome</p>
<p>unless you have sex at that point.</p>
<p>So what are the changes to go</p>
<p>from bacterial recombination to eukaryotic recombination?</p>
<p>What do you need to do?</p>
<p>Why do we go from passing around bits of DNA</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s loose change to fusing cells together,</p>
<p>lining up the chromosomes,</p>
<p>recombining across the chromosomes,</p>
<p>and then going through two rounds of cell division</p>
<p>to produce your gametes?</p>
<p>All eukaryotes do it that way.</p>
<p>So again, why switch?</p>
<p>What are the drivers here?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of time, there&rsquo;s a lot of evolution,</p>
<p>but as soon as you&rsquo;ve got cells living inside another cell,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ve got is a new design.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got new potential that you didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>So the cell living inside another cell, that design</p>
<p>allows for better storage of information,</p>
<p>better use of energy, more delegation,</p>
<p>like a hierarchical control of the whole thing.</p>
<p>And then somehow that leads to ability</p>
<p>to have multi cell organisms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that you have hierarchical control necessarily,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve got a system where you can have</p>
<p>a much larger information storage depot in the nucleus.</p>
<p>You can have a much larger genome.</p>
<p>And that allows multicellularity, yes,</p>
<p>because it allows you, it&rsquo;s a funny thing,</p>
<p>to have an animal where I have 70% of my genes</p>
<p>switched on in my brain,</p>
<p>and a different 50% switched on in my liver or something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to have all those genes in the egg cell</p>
<p>at the very beginning,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got to have a program of development</p>
<p>which says, okay, you guys switch off those genes</p>
<p>and switch on those genes, and you guys, you do that.</p>
<p>But all the genes are there at the beginning.</p>
<p>That means you&rsquo;ve got to have a lot of genes in one cell</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got to be able to maintain them.</p>
<p>And the problem with bacteria is they don&rsquo;t get close</p>
<p>to having enough genes in one cell.</p>
<p>So if you were to try and make a multicellular organism</p>
<p>from bacteria, you&rsquo;d bring different types</p>
<p>of bacteria together and hope they&rsquo;ll cooperate.</p>
<p>And the reality is they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, really tough to do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We know they don&rsquo;t because it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>We have the data as far as we know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a few special ones</p>
<p>and they dead off quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to know some of the most fun things</p>
<p>bacteria have done since.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s a few.</p>
<p>I mean, they can do some pretty funky things.</p>
<p>And this is broad brushstroke that I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Generally speaking.</p>
<p>So how was, so another fun invention.</p>
<p>Us humans seem to utilize it well,</p>
<p>but you say it&rsquo;s also very important early on is sex.</p>
<p>So what is sex?</p>
<p>Just asking for a friend.</p>
<p>And when was it invented and how hard was it to invent,</p>
<p>just as you were saying, and why was it invented?</p>
<p>Why, how hard was it and when?</p>
<p>I have a PhD student who&rsquo;s been working on this</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve just published a couple of papers on sex.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>What do you publish?</p>
<p>Does biology, is it biology, genetics, journals?</p>
<p>This is actually PNAS,</p>
<p>which is Proceedings of the National Academy.</p>
<p>Broad, big, big picture stuff.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s interested in sex.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the job of a biologist is to make sex dull.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, that&rsquo;s a beautiful way to put it.</p>
<p>Okay, so when was it invented?</p>
<p>It was invented with eukaryotes about two billion years ago.</p>
<p>All eukaryotes share the same basic mechanism</p>
<p>that you produce gametes, the gametes fuse together.</p>
<p>So a gamete is the egg cell and the sperm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not necessarily even different in size or shape.</p>
<p>So the simplest eukaryotes produce</p>
<p>what are called motile gametes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all like sperm and they all swim around.</p>
<p>They find each other, they fuse together.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have kind of much going on there beyond that.</p>
<p>And then these are haploid,</p>
<p>which is to say we all have two copies of our genome</p>
<p>and the gametes have only a single copy of the genome.</p>
<p>So when they fuse together, you now become diploid again,</p>
<p>which is to say you now have two copies of your genome.</p>
<p>And what you do is you line them all up</p>
<p>and then you double everything.</p>
<p>So now we have four copies of the complete genome.</p>
<p>And then we crisscross between all of these things.</p>
<p>So we take a bit from here and stick it on there</p>
<p>and a bit from here and we stick it on here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s recombination.</p>
<p>And then we go through two rounds of cell division.</p>
<p>So we divide in half.</p>
<p>So now the two daughter cells have two copies</p>
<p>and we divide in half again.</p>
<p>Now we have some gametes,</p>
<p>each of which has got a single copy of the genome.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the basic ground plan</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s called meiosis and Syngami.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically sex.</p>
<p>And it happens at the level of single celled organisms.</p>
<p>And it happens pretty much the same way in plants</p>
<p>and pretty much the same way in animals and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not found in any bacteria.</p>
<p>They switch things around using the same machinery</p>
<p>and they take up a bit of DNA from the environment.</p>
<p>They take out this bit and stick in that bit</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same molecular machinery they&rsquo;re using to do it.</p>
<p>So what about the kind of, you said, find each other,</p>
<p>this kind of imperative, find each other.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Like, is that?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve got a few cells together.</p>
<p>So the bottom line on all of this is bacteria.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of simple when you&rsquo;ve figured it out</p>
<p>and figuring it out, this is not me,</p>
<p>this is my PhD student, Marco Colnaghi.</p>
<p>And in effect, if you&rsquo;re doing lateral,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a Nicoli cell, you&rsquo;ve got 4,000 genes.</p>
<p>You wanna scale up to a eukaryotic size.</p>
<p>I wanna have 20,000 genes.</p>
<p>And I need to maintain my genome</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t get shot to pieces by mutations.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna do it by lateral gene transfer.</p>
<p>So I know I&rsquo;ve got a mutation in a gene.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which gene it is because I&rsquo;m not sentient,</p>
<p>but I know I can&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>I know all my regulation systems are saying,</p>
<p>something wrong here, something wrong, pick up some DNA,</p>
<p>pick up a bit of DNA from the environment.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a small genome,</p>
<p>the chances of you picking up the right bit of DNA</p>
<p>from the environment is much higher</p>
<p>than if you&rsquo;ve got a genome of 20,000 genes.</p>
<p>To do that, you&rsquo;ve effectively got to be picking up DNA</p>
<p>all the time, all day long and nothing else.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re still gonna get the wrong DNA.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to pick up large chunks.</p>
<p>And in the end, you&rsquo;ve got to align them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re forced into sex, to coin a phrase.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re forced.</p>
<p>So there is a kind of incentive.</p>
<p>If you wanna have a large genome,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to prevent it mutating to nothing.</p>
<p>That will happen with bacteria.</p>
<p>This is another reason why bacteria</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t have a large genome.</p>
<p>But as soon as you give them the power pack,</p>
<p>as soon as you give eukaryotic cells the power pack</p>
<p>that allows them to increase the size of their genome,</p>
<p>then you face the pressure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got to maintain its quality.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to stop it just mutating away.</p>
<p>What about sexual selection?</p>
<p>So the finding, like, I don&rsquo;t like this one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like this one.</p>
<p>This one seems all right.</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it&hellip;</p>
<p>At which point does it become less random?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know.</p>
<p>Because eukaryotes just kind of float around.</p>
<p>Just kind of have&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, is there sexual selection</p>
<p>in single celled eukaryotes?</p>
<p>There probably is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t know very much about it.</p>
<p>By the time we get onto&hellip;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hang out with the eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Well, I do all the time, but&hellip;</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t communicate with them yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, a peacock or something.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The kind of standard answer,</p>
<p>this is not quite what I work on,</p>
<p>but the standard answer is that it&rsquo;s female mate choice.</p>
<p>She is looking for good genes.</p>
<p>And if you can have a tail that&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>and still survive, still be alive,</p>
<p>not actually have been taken down by the nearest predator,</p>
<p>then you must&rsquo;ve got pretty good genes</p>
<p>because despite this handicap, you&rsquo;re able to survive.</p>
<p>So those are like human interpretable things,</p>
<p>like with a peacock.</p>
<p>But I wonder, I&rsquo;m sure echoes of the same thing</p>
<p>are there with more primitive organisms.</p>
<p>Basically your PR, like how you advertise yourself</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re worthy of.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So one big advertisement is the fact</p>
<p>that you survived it all.</p>
<p>Let me give you one beautiful example of an algal bloom.</p>
<p>And this can be a sign of bacteria.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be in bacteria.</p>
<p>So if suddenly you pump nitrate or phosphate</p>
<p>or something into the ocean and everything goes green,</p>
<p>you end up with all this algae growing there.</p>
<p>A viral infection or something like that</p>
<p>can kill the entire bloom overnight.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that the virus takes out everything overnight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that most of the cells in that bloom kill themselves</p>
<p>before the virus can get onto them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s through a form of cell death</p>
<p>called programmed cell death.</p>
<p>And we do the same things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we have the gaps between our fingers and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we craft synapses in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fundamental again to multicellular life.</p>
<p>They have the same machinery in these algal blooms.</p>
<p>How do they know who dies?</p>
<p>The answer is they will often put out a toxin.</p>
<p>And that toxin is kind of a challenge to you.</p>
<p>Either you can cope with the toxin or you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you can cope with it, you form a spore</p>
<p>and you will go on to become the next generation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re forming kind of a resistance spore.</p>
<p>You sink down a little bit, you get out of the way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out of the, you can&rsquo;t be attacked by a virus</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a spore or it&rsquo;s not so easily.</p>
<p>Whereas if you can&rsquo;t deal with that toxin,</p>
<p>you pull the plug and you trigger your death apparatus</p>
<p>and you kill yourself.</p>
<p>Oh, so it&rsquo;s truly life and death selection.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>
<p>And this is a bit like sexual selection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so, they&rsquo;re all pretty much genetically identical,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve had different life histories.</p>
<p>So have you had a tough day?</p>
<p>Did you happen to get infected by this virus?</p>
<p>Or did you run out of iron?</p>
<p>Or did you get a bit too much sun?</p>
<p>Whatever it may be, if this extra stress of the toxin</p>
<p>just pushes you over the edge,</p>
<p>then you have this binary choice.</p>
<p>Either you&rsquo;re the next generation</p>
<p>or you kill yourself now using this same machinery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also actually exactly the way I approach dating,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably why I&rsquo;m single.</p>
<p>Okay, what about if we can step back, DNA?</p>
<p>Just mechanism of storing information.</p>
<p>RNA, DNA, how big of an invention was that?</p>
<p>That seems to be, that seems to be fundamental</p>
<p>to like something deep within what life is,</p>
<p>is the ability, as you said,</p>
<p>to kind of store and propagate information.</p>
<p>But then you also kind of infer that</p>
<p>with your and your students work,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a deep connection between the chemistry</p>
<p>and the ability to have this kind of genetic information.</p>
<p>So how big of an invention is it</p>
<p>to have a nice representation,</p>
<p>nice hard drive for info to pass on?</p>
<p>Huge, I suspect.</p>
<p>I mean, but when I was talking about the code,</p>
<p>you see the code in RNA as well.</p>
<p>And RNA almost certainly came first.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been an idea going back decades</p>
<p>called the RNA world,</p>
<p>because RNA in theory can copy itself</p>
<p>and can catalyze reactions.</p>
<p>So it kind of cuts out this chicken and egg loop.</p>
<p>So DNA as possible is not that special.</p>
<p>So RNA, RNA is the thing that does the work really.</p>
<p>And the code lies in RNA.</p>
<p>The code lies in the interactions</p>
<p>between RNA and amino acids.</p>
<p>And it still is there today in the ribosome, for example,</p>
<p>which is just kind of a giant ribozyme,</p>
<p>which is to say it&rsquo;s an enzyme that&rsquo;s made of RNA.</p>
<p>So getting to RNA, I suspect is probably not that hard,</p>
<p>but getting from RNA, how do you,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s multiple different types of RNA now.</p>
<p>How do you distinguish?</p>
<p>This is something we&rsquo;re actively thinking about.</p>
<p>How do you distinguish between,</p>
<p>you know, a random population of RNA?</p>
<p>Some of them go on to become messenger RNA.</p>
<p>This is the transcript of the code</p>
<p>of the gene that you want to make.</p>
<p>Some of them become transfer RNA,</p>
<p>which is kind of the unit that holds the amino acid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be polymerized.</p>
<p>Some of them become ribosomal RNA,</p>
<p>which is the machine which is joining them all up together.</p>
<p>How do they discriminate themselves?</p>
<p>And, you know, is some kind of phase transition</p>
<p>going on there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult question.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now in the region of biology</p>
<p>where information is coming in.</p>
<p>But the thing about RNA is very, very good at what it does.</p>
<p>But the largest genome supported by RNA</p>
<p>are RNA viruses like HIV, for example.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty small.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a limit to how complex life could be</p>
<p>unless you come up with DNA,</p>
<p>which chemically is a really small change.</p>
<p>But how easy it is to make that change,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>As soon as you&rsquo;ve got DNA,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got an amazingly stable molecule</p>
<p>for information storage.</p>
<p>And you can do absolutely anything.</p>
<p>But how likely that transition from RNA to DNA was,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know either.</p>
<p>How much possibility is there for variety</p>
<p>in ways to store information?</p>
<p>Because it seems to be very,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s specific characteristics</p>
<p>about the programming language of DNA.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of work going on</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s called the xenodNA or RNA.</p>
<p>Can we replace the bases themselves,</p>
<p>the letters, if you like, in RNA or DNA?</p>
<p>Can we replace the backbone?</p>
<p>Can we replace, for example, phosphate with arsenate?</p>
<p>Can we replace the sugar ribose or deoxyribose</p>
<p>with a different sugar?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes, you can.</p>
<p>Within limits, there&rsquo;s not an infinite space there.</p>
<p>Arsenate doesn&rsquo;t really work</p>
<p>if the bonds are not as strong as phosphate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably quite hard to replace phosphate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to do it.</p>
<p>The question to me is why is it this way?</p>
<p>Is it because there was some form of selection</p>
<p>that this is better than the other forms</p>
<p>and there were lots of competing forms</p>
<p>of information storage early on</p>
<p>and this one was the one that worked out?</p>
<p>Or was it kind of channeled that way,</p>
<p>that these are the molecules that you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>and they work?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m increasingly thinking it&rsquo;s that way,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re channeled towards ribose, phosphate,</p>
<p>and the bases that are used.</p>
<p>But there are 200 different letters</p>
<p>kicking around out there that could have been used.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an interesting question.</p>
<p>If you look in the programming world in computer science,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a programming language called JavaScript,</p>
<p>which was written super quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant mess, but it took over the world.</p>
<p>And it was kind of a&hellip;</p>
<p>Sounds very biological.</p>
<p>It was kind of a running joke that like,</p>
<p>like surely this can&rsquo;t be,</p>
<p>this is a terrible programming language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant mess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of bugs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to write really crappy code,</p>
<p>but it took over all a front end development</p>
<p>in the web browser.</p>
<p>If you have any kind of dynamic interactive website,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually running JavaScript.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s now taking over much of the backend,</p>
<p>which is like the serious heavy duty computational stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s become super fast</p>
<p>with the different compilation engines that are running it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it really took over the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that this initially crappy derided language</p>
<p>actually takes everything over.</p>
<p>And then the question is,</p>
<p>did human civilization always strive towards JavaScript?</p>
<p>Or was JavaScript just the first programming language</p>
<p>that ran on the browser and still sticky?</p>
<p>The first is the sticky one.</p>
<p>And so it wins over anything else because it was first.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s answerable, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s good to ask that.</p>
<p>I suppose in the lab,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t run it with programming languages,</p>
<p>but in biology you can probably do some kind of</p>
<p>small scale evolutionary test to try to infer,</p>
<p>which is which.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, in a way we&rsquo;ve got the hardware</p>
<p>and the software here.</p>
<p>And the hardware is maybe the DNA and the RNA itself.</p>
<p>And then the software perhaps is more about the code.</p>
<p>Did the code have to be this way?</p>
<p>Could it have been a different way?</p>
<p>People talk about the optimization of the code</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some suggestion for that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s weak actually.</p>
<p>But you could imagine you could come out</p>
<p>with a million different codes</p>
<p>and this would be one of the best ones.</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, people have tried to model it</p>
<p>based on the effect that mutations would have.</p>
<p>So no, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know because that&rsquo;s a single assumption</p>
<p>that a mutation is what&rsquo;s being selected on there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s other possibilities too.</p>
<p>I mean, there does seem to be a resilience</p>
<p>and a redundancy to the whole thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to mess up and the way you mess it up</p>
<p>often is likely to produce interesting results.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you talking about JavaScript or the genetic code now?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, it&rsquo;s almost,</p>
<p>biology is underpinned by this kind of mess as well.</p>
<p>And you look at the human genome and it&rsquo;s full of stuff</p>
<p>that is really either broken or dysfunctional</p>
<p>or was a virus once, whatever it may be.</p>
<p>And somehow it works.</p>
<p>And maybe we need a lot of this mess.</p>
<p>We know that some functional genes are taken from this mess.</p>
<p>So what about, you mentioned the predatory behavior.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We talked about sex.</p>
<p>What about violence, predator and prey dynamics?</p>
<p>When was that invented?</p>
<p>And poetic and biological ways of putting it,</p>
<p>how do you describe predator prey relationship?</p>
<p>Is it a beautiful dance or is it a violent atrocity?</p>
<p>Well, I guess it&rsquo;s both, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I mean, when does it start?</p>
<p>It starts in bacteria.</p>
<p>You see these amazing predators.</p>
<p>Della Vibrio is one that Lynn Margulis</p>
<p>used to talk about a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a kind of a drill piece</p>
<p>that drills through the wall</p>
<p>and the membrane of the bacterium.</p>
<p>And then it effectively eats the bacterium</p>
<p>from just inside the periplasmic space</p>
<p>and makes copies of itself that way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s straight predation.</p>
<p>There are predators among bacteria.</p>
<p>So predation in that, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>means you murder somebody</p>
<p>and use their body as a resource in some way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not parasitic in that</p>
<p>you need them to be still alive.</p>
<p>No, no, I mean, predation is you kill them, really.</p>
<p>You murder.</p>
<p>Parasites, so you kind of live on them.</p>
<p>Okay, so, but it seems the predator is the really popular.</p>
<p>So what we see if we go back 560, 570 million years</p>
<p>before the Cambrian explosion,</p>
<p>there is what&rsquo;s known as the Ediacaran fauna,</p>
<p>or sometimes they call Vendobionts,</p>
<p>which is a lovely name.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not obvious that they&rsquo;re animals at all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re stalked things.</p>
<p>They often have fronds that look a lot like leaves</p>
<p>with kind of fractal branching patterns on them.</p>
<p>And the thing is, they&rsquo;re found,</p>
<p>sometimes geologists can figure out the environment</p>
<p>that they were in and say,</p>
<p>this is more than 200 meters deep</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no sign of any waves.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no storm damage down here, this kind of thing.</p>
<p>They were more than 200 meters deep,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re definitely not photosynthetic.</p>
<p>These are animals and they&rsquo;re filter feeders.</p>
<p>And we know sponges and corals and things</p>
<p>are filter feeding animals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re stuck to the spot.</p>
<p>And little bits of carbon that come their way,</p>
<p>they filter it out and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>So no predation involved in this,</p>
<p>beyond stuff just dies anyway.</p>
<p>And it feels like a very gentle, rather beautiful,</p>
<p>rather limited world, you might say.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot going on there.</p>
<p>And something changes.</p>
<p>Oxygen definitely changes during this period.</p>
<p>Other things may have changed as well.</p>
<p>But the next thing you really see in the fossil record</p>
<p>is the Cambrian explosion.</p>
<p>And what do we see there?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now seeing animals that we would recognize.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got eyes, they&rsquo;ve got claws, they&rsquo;ve got shells.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re plainly killing things or running away and hiding.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve gone from a rather gentle but limited world</p>
<p>to a rather vicious, unpleasant world that we recognize</p>
<p>and which leads to kind of arms races,</p>
<p>evolutionary arms races, which again is something</p>
<p>that when we think about a nuclear arms race,</p>
<p>we think, Jesus, we don&rsquo;t want to go there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not done anybody any good.</p>
<p>In some ways, maybe it does do good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make an argument for nuclear arms.</p>
<p>But predation as a mechanism forces organisms</p>
<p>to adapt to change to be better to escape or to kill.</p>
<p>If you need to eat, then you&rsquo;ve got to eat.</p>
<p>And a cheetah&rsquo;s not going to run at that speed</p>
<p>unless it has to because the zebra is capable of escaping.</p>
<p>So it leads to much greater feats of evolution</p>
<p>than would ever have been possible without it.</p>
<p>And in the end, to a much more beautiful world.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not all bad by any means.</p>
<p>But the thing is you can&rsquo;t have this</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have an oxygenated planet.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s all in the end, it&rsquo;s about how much energy</p>
<p>can you extract from the food you eat.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have an oxygenated planet,</p>
<p>you can get about 10% out, not much more than that.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve got an oxygenated planet,</p>
<p>you can get about 40% out.</p>
<p>And that means you can have,</p>
<p>instead of having one or two trophic levels,</p>
<p>you can have five or six trophic levels.</p>
<p>And that means things can eat things</p>
<p>that eat other things and so on.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve gone to a level of ecological complexity,</p>
<p>which is completely impossible in the absence of oxygen.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the Hunter S. Thompson quote,</p>
<p>that for every moment of triumph,</p>
<p>for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.</p>
<p>The history of life on Earth, unfortunately,</p>
<p>is that of violence.</p>
<p>Just the trillions and trillions of multi cell organisms</p>
<p>that were murdered in the struggle for survival.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sorry statement, but yes, it&rsquo;s basically true.</p>
<p>And that somehow is a catalyst</p>
<p>from an evolutionary perspective for creativity,</p>
<p>for creating more and more complex organisms</p>
<p>that are better and better at surviving.</p>
<p>I mean, survival of the fittest,</p>
<p>if you just go back to that old phrase,</p>
<p>means death of the weakest.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s fit, what&rsquo;s weak,</p>
<p>these are terms that don&rsquo;t have much intrinsic meaning.</p>
<p>But the thing is, evolution only happens because of death.</p>
<p>One way to die is the constraints,</p>
<p>the scarcity of the resources in the environment,</p>
<p>but that seems to be not nearly as good of a mechanism</p>
<p>for death than other creatures</p>
<p>roaming about in the environment.</p>
<p>When I say environment, I mean like the static environment,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s the dynamic environment</p>
<p>of bigger things trying to eat you</p>
<p>and use you for your energy.</p>
<p>It forces you to come up with a solution</p>
<p>to your specific problem that is inventive</p>
<p>and is new and hasn&rsquo;t been done before.</p>
<p>And so it forces, I mean, literally change,</p>
<p>literally evolution on populations.</p>
<p>They have to become different.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting that humans have channeled that</p>
<p>into more, I mean, I guess what humans are doing</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re inventing more productive</p>
<p>and safe ways of doing that.</p>
<p>You know, this whole idea of morality</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>I think they ultimately lead to competition</p>
<p>versus violence, because I think violence</p>
<p>can have a cold, brutal, inefficient aspect to it.</p>
<p>But if you channel that into more controlled competition</p>
<p>in the space of ideas, in the space of approaches to life,</p>
<p>maybe you can be even more productive than evolution is.</p>
<p>Because evolution is very wasteful.</p>
<p>Like the amount of murder required</p>
<p>to really test a good idea,</p>
<p>genetically speaking, is just a lot.</p>
<p>Many, many, many generations.</p>
<p>Morally, we cannot base society</p>
<p>on the way that evolution works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an invention, right?</p>
<p>But actually, in some respects we do,</p>
<p>which is to say, this is how science works.</p>
<p>We have competing hypotheses that have to get better,</p>
<p>otherwise they die.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way that society works.</p>
<p>You know, in ancient Greece, we had the Athens</p>
<p>and Sparta and city states,</p>
<p>and then we had the Renaissance and nation states,</p>
<p>and universities compete with each other.</p>
<p>Tremendous amount of companies competing</p>
<p>with each other all the time.</p>
<p>It drives innovation.</p>
<p>And if we want to do it without all the death</p>
<p>that we see in nature,</p>
<p>then we have to have some kind of societal level control</p>
<p>that says, well, there&rsquo;s some limits, guys,</p>
<p>and these are what the limits are gonna be.</p>
<p>And society as a whole has to say,</p>
<p>right, we want to limit the amount of death here,</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t do this and you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And you know, who makes up these rules,</p>
<p>and how do we know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough thing, but it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>trying to find a moral basis</p>
<p>for avoiding the death of evolution and natural selection</p>
<p>and keeping the innovation and the richness of it.</p>
<p>And I forgot who said it, but that murder is illegal.</p>
<p>Probably Kurt Vonnegut.</p>
<p>Murder is illegal except when it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>to the sound of trumpets and at a large scale.</p>
<p>So we still have wars.</p>
<p>But we are struggling with this idea</p>
<p>that murder is a bad thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting how we&rsquo;re channeling</p>
<p>the best of the evolutionary imperative</p>
<p>and trying to get rid of the stuff that&rsquo;s not productive.</p>
<p>Trying to almost accelerate evolution.</p>
<p>The same kind of thing that makes evolution creative.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to use that.</p>
<p>I think we naturally do it.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think we can help ourselves do it.</p>
<p>And you know, capitalism as a form</p>
<p>is basically about competition and differential rewards.</p>
<p>But we, society, and you know, we have a,</p>
<p>I keep using this word moral obligation,</p>
<p>but you know, we cannot operate as a society</p>
<p>if we go that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that we&rsquo;ve had problems achieving balance.</p>
<p>So for example, in the financial crash in 2009,</p>
<p>do you let banks go to the wall or not?</p>
<p>This kind of question.</p>
<p>In evolution, certainly you let them go to the wall.</p>
<p>And in that sense, you don&rsquo;t need the regulation</p>
<p>because they just die.</p>
<p>Whereas if we, as a society,</p>
<p>think about what&rsquo;s required for society as a whole,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t necessarily let them go to the wall.</p>
<p>In which case you then have to impose</p>
<p>some kind of regulation that the bankers themselves will,</p>
<p>in an evolutionary manner, exploit.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve been struggling with this kind of idea</p>
<p>of capitalism, the cold brutality of capitalism</p>
<p>that seems to create so much beautiful things</p>
<p>in this world.</p>
<p>And then the ideals of communism</p>
<p>that seem to create so much brutal destruction in history.</p>
<p>We struggle with ideas of,</p>
<p>well, maybe we didn&rsquo;t do it right.</p>
<p>How can we do things better?</p>
<p>And then the ideas are the things</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re playing with as opposed to people.</p>
<p>If a PhD student has a bad idea,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t shoot the PhD student.</p>
<p>We just criticize their idea and hope they improve.</p>
<p>You have a very humane lab.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know how you guys do it.</p>
<p>The way I run things, it&rsquo;s always life and death.</p>
<p>Okay, so it is interesting about humans</p>
<p>that there is an inner sense of morality</p>
<p>which begs the question of how did homo sapiens evolve?</p>
<p>If we think about the invention of,</p>
<p>early invention of sex and early invention of predation,</p>
<p>what was the thing invented to make humans?</p>
<p>What would you say?</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose a couple of things I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>Number one is you don&rsquo;t have to wind the clock back</p>
<p>very far, five, six million years or so,</p>
<p>and let it run forwards again.</p>
<p>And the chances of humans as we know them</p>
<p>is not necessarily that high.</p>
<p>You know, imagine as an alien, you find planet Earth</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got everything apart from humans on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing, wonderful, marvelous planet,</p>
<p>but nothing that we would recognize</p>
<p>as extremely intelligent life,</p>
<p>kind of space faring civilization.</p>
<p>So when we think about aliens,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of after something like ourselves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re after a space faring civilization.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not after zebras and giraffes and lions and things,</p>
<p>amazing though they are.</p>
<p>But the additional kind of evolutionary steps</p>
<p>to go from large, complex mammals, monkeys, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>to humans doesn&rsquo;t strike me as that long a distance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the brain.</p>
<p>And where&rsquo;s the brain and morality coming from?</p>
<p>It seems to me to be all about groups,</p>
<p>human groups and interactions between groups.</p>
<p>The collective intelligence of it.</p>
<p>Yes, the interactions really.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a guy at UCL called Mark Thomas,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done a lot of really beautiful work,</p>
<p>I think, on this kind of question.</p>
<p>So I talk to him every now and then,</p>
<p>so my views are influenced by him.</p>
<p>But a lot seems to depend on population density,</p>
<p>that the more interactions you have going on</p>
<p>between different groups, the more transfer of information,</p>
<p>if you like, between groups,</p>
<p>people moving from one group to another group,</p>
<p>almost like lateral gene transfer in bacteria,</p>
<p>the more expertise you&rsquo;re able to develop and maintain,</p>
<p>the more culturally complex your society can become.</p>
<p>And groups that have become detached,</p>
<p>like on Easter Island, for example,</p>
<p>very often degenerate in terms of the complexity</p>
<p>of their civilization.</p>
<p>Is that true for complex organisms in general?</p>
<p>Population density is often productive.</p>
<p>Really matters, but in human terms,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the actual factors were</p>
<p>that were driving a large brain,</p>
<p>but you can talk about fire, you can talk about tool use,</p>
<p>you can talk about language,</p>
<p>and none of them seem to correlate especially well</p>
<p>with the actual known trajectory of human evolution</p>
<p>in terms of cave art and these kind of things.</p>
<p>That seems to work much better</p>
<p>just with population density</p>
<p>and number of interactions between different groups,</p>
<p>all of which is really about human interactions,</p>
<p>human human interactions and the complexity of those.</p>
<p>But population density is the thing</p>
<p>that increases the number of interactions,</p>
<p>but then there must have been inventions</p>
<p>forced by that number of interactions</p>
<p>that actually led to humans.</p>
<p>So like Richard Wrangham talks about that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically the beta males had to beat up the alpha male.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what collaboration looks like,</p>
<p>is they, when you&rsquo;re living together,</p>
<p>our early ancestors don&rsquo;t like the dictatorial aspect</p>
<p>of a single individual at the top of a tribe.</p>
<p>So they learned to collaborate</p>
<p>how to basically create a democracy of sorts,</p>
<p>a democracy that prevents, minimizes,</p>
<p>or lessens the amount of violence,</p>
<p>which essentially gives strength to the tribe</p>
<p>and make the war between tribes versus the dictator.</p>
<p>I mean, I think one of the most wonderful things</p>
<p>about humans is we&rsquo;re all of those things.</p>
<p>I mean, we are deeply social as a species</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re also deeply selfish.</p>
<p>And it seems to me the conflict</p>
<p>between capitalism and communism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really just two aspects of human nature,</p>
<p>both of which are.</p>
<p>We have both and we have a constant kind of vying</p>
<p>between the two sides.</p>
<p>We really do care about other people beyond our families,</p>
<p>beyond our immediate people.</p>
<p>We care about society and the society that we live in.</p>
<p>And you could say that&rsquo;s a drawing</p>
<p>towards socialism or communism.</p>
<p>On the other side, we really do care about ourselves.</p>
<p>We really do care about our families,</p>
<p>about working for something that we gain from.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the capitalist side of it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both really deeply ingrained in human nature.</p>
<p>In terms of violence and interactions between groups,</p>
<p>yes, all this dynamic of,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interacting between groups,</p>
<p>you can be certain that they&rsquo;re gonna be burning each other</p>
<p>and all kinds of physical violent interactions as well,</p>
<p>which will drive the kind of cleverness</p>
<p>of how do you resist this?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build a tower.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do to prevent being overrun</p>
<p>by those marauding gangs from over there?</p>
<p>And you look outside humans</p>
<p>and you look at chimps and bonobos and so on,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very, very different structures to society.</p>
<p>Chimps tend to have an aggressive alpha male type structure</p>
<p>and bonobos, there&rsquo;s basically a female society</p>
<p>where the males are predominantly excluded</p>
<p>and only brought in at the behest of the female.</p>
<p>We have a lot in common with both of those groups.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, again, tension there.</p>
<p>And probably chimps, more violence,</p>
<p>the bonobos, probably more sex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another tension.</p>
<p>How serious do we wanna be?</p>
<p>How much fun we wanna be?</p>
<p>Asking for a friend again,</p>
<p>what do you think happened to Neanderthals?</p>
<p>What did we cheeky humans do to the Neanderthals,</p>
<p>Homo sapiens?</p>
<p>Do you think we murdered them?</p>
<p>Was it, how do we murder them?</p>
<p>How do we outcompete them?</p>
<p>Or do we mate them?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s unequivocal evidence</p>
<p>that we mated with them.</p>
<p>We always try to mate with everything.</p>
<p>Yes, pretty much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some interesting,</p>
<p>the first sequences that came along</p>
<p>were in mitochondrial DNA.</p>
<p>And that was back to about 2002 or thereabouts.</p>
<p>What was found was that Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA</p>
<p>was very different to human mitochondria.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>You could do a clock on it</p>
<p>and it said the divergent state</p>
<p>was about 600,000 years ago or something like that.</p>
<p>So not so long ago.</p>
<p>And then the first full genomes were sequenced</p>
<p>maybe 10 years after that.</p>
<p>And they showed plenty of signs of mating between.</p>
<p>So the mitochondrial DNA effectively says no mating.</p>
<p>And the nuclear genes say, yeah, lots of mating.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that possible?</p>
<p>So can you explain the difference</p>
<p>between mitochondrial DNA and nucleus?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about the mitochondria,</p>
<p>which are the power packs in cells.</p>
<p>These are the paired down control units is their DNA.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s passed on by the mother only.</p>
<p>And in the egg cell,</p>
<p>we might have half a million copies of mitochondrial DNA.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only 37 genes left and they do a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically the control unit of energy production.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a basic old school machine that does.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got genes that were considered</p>
<p>to be effectively trivial</p>
<p>because they did a very narrowly defined job,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not trivial in the sense</p>
<p>that that narrowly defined job</p>
<p>is about everything that is being alive.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re much easier to sequence.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got many more copies of these things</p>
<p>and you can sequence them very quickly.</p>
<p>But the problem is because they go down</p>
<p>only the maternal line from mother to daughter,</p>
<p>your mitochondrial DNA and mine is going nowhere.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Any kids we have, they get their mother&rsquo;s mitochondrial DNA</p>
<p>except in very, very rare and strange circumstances.</p>
<p>And so it tells a different story</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a story which is easy to reconcile always.</p>
<p>And what it seems to suggest to my mind at least</p>
<p>is that there was one way traffic of genes</p>
<p>probably going from humans into Neanderthals</p>
<p>rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>Why did the Neanderthals disappear?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I suspect that they were,</p>
<p>I suspect they were probably less violent,</p>
<p>less clever, less populous, less willing to fight.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it probably drove them to extinction</p>
<p>at the margins of Europe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting how much,</p>
<p>if we ran Earth over and over again,</p>
<p>how many of these branches of intelligent beings</p>
<p>that have figured out some kind of</p>
<p>how to leverage collective intelligence,</p>
<p>which ones of them emerge?</p>
<p>Which ones of them succeed?</p>
<p>Is it the more violent ones?</p>
<p>Is it the more isolated ones?</p>
<p>Like what dynamics result in more productivity?</p>
<p>And I suppose we&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>The more complex the organism,</p>
<p>the harder it is to run the experiment in the lab.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And in some respects, maybe it&rsquo;s best if we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The truth might be very painful.</p>
<p>What about if we actually step back</p>
<p>a couple of interesting things that we humans do?</p>
<p>One is object manipulation and movement.</p>
<p>And of course, movement was something that was done,</p>
<p>that was another big invention,</p>
<p>being able to move around the environment.</p>
<p>And the other one is this sensory mechanism,</p>
<p>how we sense the environment.</p>
<p>One of the coolest high definition ones is vision.</p>
<p>How big are those inventions</p>
<p>in the history of life on Earth?</p>
<p>Vision, movement, I mean, again, extremely important,</p>
<p>going back to the origin of animals,</p>
<p>the Cambrian explosion where suddenly you&rsquo;re seeing eyes</p>
<p>in the fossil record.</p>
<p>And you can, it&rsquo;s not necessarily, again,</p>
<p>lots of people historically have said</p>
<p>what use is half an eye?</p>
<p>And you can go in a series of steps</p>
<p>from a light sensitive spot on a flat piece of tissue</p>
<p>to an eyeball with a lens and so on.</p>
<p>If you assume no more than, I don&rsquo;t remember,</p>
<p>this was a specific model that I have in mind,</p>
<p>but it was 1% change or half a percent change</p>
<p>for each generation.</p>
<p>How long would it take to evolve an eye as we know it?</p>
<p>And the answer is half a million years.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to take long.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how evolution works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an answer to the question.</p>
<p>It just shows you can reconstruct the steps</p>
<p>and you can work out roughly how it can work.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that big a deal to evolve an eye,</p>
<p>but once you have one, then there&rsquo;s nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re back to predator prey relationships.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back to all the benefits</p>
<p>that being able to see brings you.</p>
<p>And if you think philosophically what bats are doing</p>
<p>with eco location and so on, I have no idea,</p>
<p>but I suspect that they form an image of the world</p>
<p>in pretty much the same way that we do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of mental reconstruction.</p>
<p>So I suppose the other thing about sight,</p>
<p>there are single celled organisms that have got a lens</p>
<p>and a retina and a cornea and so on.</p>
<p>Basically they&rsquo;ve got a camera type eye in a single cell.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a brain.</p>
<p>What they understand about their world</p>
<p>is impossible to say, but they&rsquo;re capable of coming up</p>
<p>with the same structures to do so.</p>
<p>So I suppose then is that once you&rsquo;ve got things like eyes,</p>
<p>then you have a big driving pressure</p>
<p>on the central nervous system</p>
<p>to figure out what it all means.</p>
<p>And then we come around to your other point</p>
<p>about manipulation, sensory input, and so on</p>
<p>about now you have a huge requirement</p>
<p>to understand what your environment is and what it means</p>
<p>and how it reacts and how you should run away</p>
<p>and where you should stay put.</p>
<p>Actually on that point, let me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know the work of Donald Hoffman,</p>
<p>who uses the argument, the mechanism of evolution</p>
<p>to say that there&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>a strong evolutionary value to seeing the world as it is.</p>
<p>So objective reality, that our perception actually</p>
<p>is very different from what&rsquo;s objectively real.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re living inside an illusion</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re basically the entire set of species on earth,</p>
<p>I think, I guess, are competing in a space</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an illusion that&rsquo;s distinct from,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s far away from physical reality as it is,</p>
<p>as defined by physics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s an illusion so much as a bubble.</p>
<p>I mean, we have a sensory input,</p>
<p>which is a fraction of what we could have</p>
<p>a sensory input on, and we interpret it</p>
<p>in terms of what&rsquo;s useful for us to know to stay alive.</p>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s an illusion in that sense,</p>
<p>but the tree is physically there.</p>
<p>And if you walk into that tree, you know,</p>
<p>that there is, it&rsquo;s not purely a delusion,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some physical reality to it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a sensory slice into reality as it is,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s just a slice,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing a big picture.</p>
<p>But he says that that slice doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>need to be a slice.</p>
<p>It could be a complete fabrication</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just consistent amongst the species,</p>
<p>which is an interesting, or at least it&rsquo;s a humbling</p>
<p>realization that our perception is limited</p>
<p>and our cognitive abilities are limited.</p>
<p>And at least to me, it&rsquo;s argument from evolution,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much, how strong that is as an argument,</p>
<p>but I do think that life can exist in the mind.</p>
<p>In the same way that you can do a virtual reality video game</p>
<p>and you can have a vibrant life inside that place</p>
<p>and that place is not real in some sense,</p>
<p>but you could still have a vibrant,</p>
<p>all the same forces of evolution,</p>
<p>all the same competition, the dynamics of between humans</p>
<p>you can have, but I don&rsquo;t know if,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s evidence for that being</p>
<p>the thing that happened on earth.</p>
<p>It seems that earth.</p>
<p>I think in either environment, I wouldn&rsquo;t deny</p>
<p>that you could have exactly the world that you talk about</p>
<p>and it would be very difficult to,</p>
<p>the idea in matrix movies and so on</p>
<p>that the whole world is completely a construction</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re fundamentally deluded.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to say that&rsquo;s impossible or couldn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>or, and certainly we construct in our minds</p>
<p>what the outside world is, but we do it on input</p>
<p>and that input, I would hesitate to say it&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s precisely how we do understand the world.</p>
<p>We have eyes, but if you keep someone in,</p>
<p>apparently this kind of thing happens,</p>
<p>someone kept in a dark room for five years</p>
<p>or something like that, they never see properly again</p>
<p>because the neural wiring that underpins</p>
<p>how we interpret vision never developed.</p>
<p>You need, when you watch a child develop,</p>
<p>it walks into a table, it bangs his head on the table</p>
<p>and it hurts and now you&rsquo;ve got two inputs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got one pain from this sharp edge</p>
<p>and number two, you probably, you&rsquo;ve touched it</p>
<p>and realized it&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s a sharp edge</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got the visual input</p>
<p>and you put the three things together and think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna walk into a table again.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re learning and it&rsquo;s a limited reality,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a true reality and if you don&rsquo;t learn</p>
<p>that properly, then you will get eaten,</p>
<p>you will get hit by a bus, you will not survive.</p>
<p>And same, if you&rsquo;re in some kind of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, computer construction of reality,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in my ground here, but if you construct the laws</p>
<p>that this is what reality is inside this,</p>
<p>then you play by those laws.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, as long as the laws are consistent.</p>
<p>So just like you said in the lab,</p>
<p>the interesting thing about the simulation question,</p>
<p>yes, it&rsquo;s hard to know if we&rsquo;re living inside a simulation,</p>
<p>but also, yes, it&rsquo;s possible to do these kinds</p>
<p>of experiments in the lab now more and more.</p>
<p>To me, the interesting question is,</p>
<p>how realistic does a virtual reality game need to be</p>
<p>for us to not be able to tell the difference?</p>
<p>A more interesting question to me is,</p>
<p>how realistic or interesting</p>
<p>does a virtual reality world need to be</p>
<p>in order for us to want to stay there forever</p>
<p>or much longer than physical reality, prefer that place?</p>
<p>And also prefer it not as we prefer hard drugs,</p>
<p>but prefer it in a deep, meaningful way</p>
<p>in the way we enjoy life.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose the issue with the matrix,</p>
<p>I imagine that it&rsquo;s possible to dilute the mind sufficiently</p>
<p>that you genuinely, in that way,</p>
<p>do think that you are interacting with the real world</p>
<p>when in fact the whole thing&rsquo;s a simulation.</p>
<p>How good does a simulation need to be to be able to do that?</p>
<p>Well, it needs to convince you</p>
<p>that all your sensory input is correct and accurate</p>
<p>and joins up and makes sense.</p>
<p>Now, that sensory input is not something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re born with.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re born with a sense of touch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re born with eyes and so on,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know how to use them.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what to make of them.</p>
<p>We go around, we bump into trees.</p>
<p>We cry a lot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in pain a lot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re basically booting up the system</p>
<p>so that it can make head or tail</p>
<p>of the sensory input that it&rsquo;s getting.</p>
<p>And that sensory input&rsquo;s not just a one way flux of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, you have to walk into things.</p>
<p>You have to hear things.</p>
<p>You have to put it together.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;ve got just babies in the matrix</p>
<p>who are slotted into this,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they have that kind of sensory input.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they would have any way</p>
<p>to make sense of New York as a world that they&rsquo;re part of.</p>
<p>The brain is just not developed in that way.</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t make sense of New York</p>
<p>in this physical reality either.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, but you said pain</p>
<p>and the walking into things.</p>
<p>Well, you can create a pain signal.</p>
<p>And as long as it&rsquo;s consistent,</p>
<p>that certain things result in pain,</p>
<p>you can start to construct a reality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, maybe you disagree with this,</p>
<p>but I think we are born almost with a desire</p>
<p>to be convinced by our reality,</p>
<p>like a desire to make sense of our reality.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m sure we are, yes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an imperative.</p>
<p>So whatever that reality is given to us,</p>
<p>like the table hurts, fire is hot.</p>
<p>I think we wanna be diluted</p>
<p>in the sense that we want to make a simple,</p>
<p>like Einstein&rsquo;s simple theory of the thing around us.</p>
<p>We want that simplicity.</p>
<p>And so maybe the hunger for the simplicity</p>
<p>is the thing that could be used</p>
<p>to construct a pretty dumb simulation that tricks us.</p>
<p>So maybe tricking humans</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t require building a universe.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, this is not what I work on,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know how close to it we are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone works on it.</p>
<p>But I agree with you that, yeah,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s a morally justifiable thing to do,</p>
<p>but is it possible in principle?</p>
<p>I think it would be very difficult,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t see why in principle it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible.</p>
<p>And I agree with you that we try to understand the world.</p>
<p>We try to integrate the sensory inputs that we have,</p>
<p>and we try to come up with a hypothesis</p>
<p>that explains what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I think though that we have huge input</p>
<p>from the social context that we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do it by ourselves.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t kind of blunder around in a universe by ourself</p>
<p>and understand the whole thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re told by the people around us</p>
<p>what things are and what they do,</p>
<p>and language is coming in here and so on.</p>
<p>So it would have to be an extremely impressive simulation</p>
<p>to simulate all of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, simulate all of that,</p>
<p>including the social construct,</p>
<p>the spread of ideas and the exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But those questions are really important to understand</p>
<p>as we become more and more digital creatures.</p>
<p>It seems like the next step of evolution</p>
<p>is us becoming all the same mechanisms we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>are becoming more and more plugged into the machine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re becoming cyborgs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an interesting interplay</p>
<p>between wires and biology.</p>
<p>Zeros and ones and the biological systems.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll have the luxury</p>
<p>to see humans as disjoint from the technology</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve created for much longer.</p>
<p>We are an organism that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I agree with you.</p>
<p>But we come really with this to consciousness.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And is there a distinction there?</p>
<p>Because what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>the natural end point says we are indistinguishable,</p>
<p>that if you are capable of building an AI,</p>
<p>which is sufficiently close and similar</p>
<p>that we merge with it,</p>
<p>then to all intents and purposes,</p>
<p>that AI is conscious as we know it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have a strong view, but I have a view.</p>
<p>And I wrote about it in the epilogue to my last book,</p>
<p>because 10 years ago,</p>
<p>I wrote a chapter in a book called Life Ascending</p>
<p>about consciousness.</p>
<p>And the subtitle of Life Ascending</p>
<p>was The 10 Great Inventions of Evolution.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t possibly write a book</p>
<p>with a subtitle like that that did not include consciousness.</p>
<p>And specifically consciousness</p>
<p>as one of the great inventions.</p>
<p>And it was in part because I was just curious to know more</p>
<p>and I read more for that chapter.</p>
<p>I never worked on it, but I&rsquo;ve always,</p>
<p>how can anyone not be interested in the question?</p>
<p>And I was left with the feeling that A, nobody knows,</p>
<p>and B, there are two main schools of thought out there</p>
<p>with a big kind of skew in distribution.</p>
<p>One of them says, oh, it&rsquo;s a property of matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unknown law of physics.</p>
<p>Panpsychism, everything is conscious.</p>
<p>The sun is conscious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of, or a rock is conscious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of how much.</p>
<p>And I find that very unpersuasive.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I think we somehow can tell the difference</p>
<p>between something that&rsquo;s living and something that&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And then the other end is it&rsquo;s an emergent property</p>
<p>of a very complex central nervous system.</p>
<p>And I never quite understand what people mean</p>
<p>by words like emergence.</p>
<p>I mean, there are genuine examples,</p>
<p>but I think we very often tend to use it</p>
<p>to plaster over ignorance.</p>
<p>As a biochemist, the question for me then was,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s a concoction of a central nervous system.</p>
<p>A depolarizing neuron gives rise to a feeling,</p>
<p>to a feeling of pain, or to a feeling of love,</p>
<p>or anger, or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>So what is then a feeling in biophysical terms</p>
<p>in the central nervous system?</p>
<p>Which bit of the wiring gives rise to,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone answer that question</p>
<p>in a way that makes sense to me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an important question to answer.</p>
<p>I think if we want to understand consciousness,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only question to answer.</p>
<p>Because certainly an AI is capable of out thinking,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s already happened.</p>
<p>In terms of just information processing</p>
<p>and computational skill,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have any problem in designing a mind</p>
<p>which is at least the equal of the human mind.</p>
<p>But in terms of what we value the most as humans,</p>
<p>which is to say our feelings, our emotions,</p>
<p>our sense of what the world is in a very personal way,</p>
<p>that I think means as much or more to people</p>
<p>than their information processing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I don&rsquo;t think that AI necessarily</p>
<p>will become conscious, because I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the property of life.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about it more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible writer, one of my favorite writers.</p>
<p>So let me read from your latest book, Transformers,</p>
<p>what you write about consciousness.</p>
<p>I think therefore I am, said Descartes,</p>
<p>is one of the most celebrated lines ever written.</p>
<p>But what am I exactly?</p>
<p>An artificial intelligence can think too, by definition,</p>
<p>and therefore is, yet few of us could agree</p>
<p>whether AI is capable in principle</p>
<p>of anything resembling human emotions,</p>
<p>of love or hate, fear and joy, of spiritual yearnings,</p>
<p>for oneness or oblivion,</p>
<p>or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger.</p>
<p>The problem is we don&rsquo;t know what emotions are,</p>
<p>as you were saying.</p>
<p>What is the feeling in physical terms?</p>
<p>How does a discharging neuron give rise</p>
<p>to a feeling of anything at all?</p>
<p>This is the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>the seeming duality of mind and matter,</p>
<p>the physical makeup of our innermost self.</p>
<p>We can understand in principle</p>
<p>how an extremely sophisticated parallel processing system</p>
<p>could be capable of wondrous feats of intelligence,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t answer in principle</p>
<p>whether such a supreme intelligence</p>
<p>would experience joy or melancholy.</p>
<p>What is the quantum of solace?</p>
<p>I, speaking to the question of emergence,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s just technical,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an excellent paper on this recently</p>
<p>about this kind of phase transition,</p>
<p>emergence of performance in neural networks</p>
<p>on the problem of NLP, natural language processing.</p>
<p>So language models, there seems to be this question of size.</p>
<p>At some point, there is a phase transition</p>
<p>as you grow the size of the neural network.</p>
<p>So the question is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of somewhat of a technical question</p>
<p>that you can philosophize over.</p>
<p>The technical question is,</p>
<p>is there a size of a neural network</p>
<p>that starts to be able to form the kind of representations</p>
<p>that can capture a language,</p>
<p>and therefore be able to, not just language,</p>
<p>but linguistically capture knowledge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sufficient to solve a lot of problems in language,</p>
<p>like be able to have a conversation.</p>
<p>And there seems to be not a gradual increase,</p>
<p>but a phase transition.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to construct the science of where that is,</p>
<p>like what is a good size of a neural network,</p>
<p>and why does such a phase transition happen?</p>
<p>Anyway, that sort of points to emergence,</p>
<p>that there could be stages where a thing goes</p>
<p>from being, oh, you&rsquo;re very intelligent toaster,</p>
<p>to a toaster that&rsquo;s feeling sad today and turns away</p>
<p>and looks out the window, sighing,</p>
<p>having an existential crisis.</p>
<p>Thinking of Marvin, the paranoid android.</p>
<p>Marvin is simplistic because Marvin is just cranky.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So easily programmed.</p>
<p>Yeah, easily programmed, nonstop existential crisis.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re almost basically, what is it?</p>
<p>Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky,</p>
<p>like just constantly complaining about life.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re capturing the full rollercoaster</p>
<p>of human emotion, the excitement, the bliss,</p>
<p>the connection, the empathy and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And then the selfishness, the anger, the depression,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re capturing all of that</p>
<p>and be able to experience it deeply.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the most important thing</p>
<p>you could possibly experience today.</p>
<p>The highest highs, the lowest lows, this is it.</p>
<p>My life will be over.</p>
<p>I cannot possibly go on that feeling.</p>
<p>And then like after a nap, you&rsquo;re feeling amazing.</p>
<p>That might be something that emerges.</p>
<p>So why would a nap make an AI being feel better?</p>
<p>First of all, we don&rsquo;t know that for a human either, right?</p>
<p>But we do know that that&rsquo;s actually true</p>
<p>for many people much of the time.</p>
<p>You may be utterly depressed and you have a nap</p>
<p>and you do in fact feel better, so.</p>
<p>Oh, you are actually asking the technical question there,</p>
<p>is there, so that&rsquo;s a very,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a biological answer to that.</p>
<p>And so the question is whether AI needs to have</p>
<p>the same kind of attachments to its body,</p>
<p>bodily function and preservation</p>
<p>of the brain&rsquo;s successful function,</p>
<p>self preservation essentially in some deep biological sense.</p>
<p>I mean, to my mind, it comes back round</p>
<p>to the problem we were talking about before</p>
<p>about simulations and sensory input</p>
<p>and learning what all of this stuff means</p>
<p>and life and death,</p>
<p>that biology unlike society has a death penalty</p>
<p>over everything and natural selection works</p>
<p>on that death penalty.</p>
<p>That if you make this decision wrongly, you die.</p>
<p>And the next generation is represented by beings</p>
<p>that made a slightly different decision on balance.</p>
<p>And that is something that&rsquo;s intrinsically</p>
<p>difficult to simulate in all this richness, I would say.</p>
<p>So what is?</p>
<p>Death in all its richness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Our relationship with death or the whole of it.</p>
<p>So which when you say richness, of course,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot in that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is hard to simulate.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s part of the richness that&rsquo;s hard to simulate?</p>
<p>I suppose the complexity of the environment</p>
<p>and your position in that or the position</p>
<p>of an organism in that environment,</p>
<p>in the full richness of that environment</p>
<p>over its entire life, over multiple generations</p>
<p>with changes in gene sequence over those generations.</p>
<p>So slight changes in the makeup of those individuals</p>
<p>over generations.</p>
<p>But if you take it back to the level of single cells,</p>
<p>which I do in the book and ask how does a single cell</p>
<p>in effect know it exists as a unit, as an entity?</p>
<p>I mean, no, in inverted commas,</p>
<p>obviously it doesn&rsquo;t know anything,</p>
<p>but it acts as a unit and it acts</p>
<p>with astonishing precision as a unit.</p>
<p>And I had suggested that that&rsquo;s linked</p>
<p>to the electrical fields on the membranes themselves</p>
<p>and that they give some indication</p>
<p>of how am I doing in relation to my environment</p>
<p>as a kind of real time feedback on the world.</p>
<p>And this is something physical,</p>
<p>which can be selected over generations</p>
<p>that if you get this wrong,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s linked with this set of circumstances</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve just, as an individual,</p>
<p>I have a moment of blind panic and run</p>
<p>as a bacterium or something.</p>
<p>You have some electrical discharge that says blind panic</p>
<p>and it runs whatever it may be.</p>
<p>And you associate over generations, multiple generations</p>
<p>that this electrical phase that I&rsquo;m in now</p>
<p>is associated with a response like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to see how feelings come in</p>
<p>through the back door almost with that kind of giving real time</p>
<p>feedback on your position in the world</p>
<p>in relation to how am I doing.</p>
<p>And then you complexify the system</p>
<p>and yes, I have no problem with phase transition.</p>
<p>And can all of this be done purely by the language,</p>
<p>by the issues with how the system understands itself?</p>
<p>Maybe it can, I honestly don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But the philosophers for a long time</p>
<p>have talked about the possibility</p>
<p>that you can have a zombie intelligence</p>
<p>and that there are no feelings there,</p>
<p>but everything else is the same.</p>
<p>I mean, I have to throw this back to you really.</p>
<p>How do you deal with the zombie intelligence?</p>
<p>So first of all, I can see that from a biologist perspective,</p>
<p>you think of all the complexities</p>
<p>that led up to the human being.</p>
<p>The entirety of the history of four billion years</p>
<p>that in some deep sense integrated the human being</p>
<p>into this environment.</p>
<p>And that dance of the organism and the environment,</p>
<p>you could see how emotions arise from that.</p>
<p>And then emotions are deeply connected</p>
<p>and creating a human experience.</p>
<p>And from that, you mix in consciousness</p>
<p>and the full mess of it, yeah.</p>
<p>But from a perspective of an intelligent organism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already here, like a baby that learns,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t need to learn how to be a collection of cells</p>
<p>or how to do all the things it needs to do.</p>
<p>The basic function of a baby as it learns</p>
<p>is to interact with its environment,</p>
<p>to learn from its environment,</p>
<p>to learn how to fit in to the social society,</p>
<p>to like&hellip;</p>
<p>And the basic response of the baby</p>
<p>is to cry a lot of the time.</p>
<p>To cry, well, to convince the humans to protect it</p>
<p>or to discipline it, to teach it.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve developed a bunch of different tricks,</p>
<p>how to get our parents to take care of us,</p>
<p>to educate us, to teach us about the world.</p>
<p>Also, we&rsquo;ve constructed the world in such a way</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s safe enough for us to survive in</p>
<p>and yet dangerous enough for learning the valuable lessons.</p>
<p>Like the tables are still hard with corners,</p>
<p>so it can still run into them.</p>
<p>It hurts like how&hellip;</p>
<p>So AI needs to solve that problem,</p>
<p>not the problem of constructing</p>
<p>this super complex organism that leads up&hellip;</p>
<p>To run the whole&hellip;</p>
<p>To make an apple pie, to build the whole universe,</p>
<p>you need to build a whole universe.</p>
<p>I think the zombie question is something</p>
<p>I would leave to the philosophers.</p>
<p>Because&hellip;</p>
<p>And I will also leave to them the definition of love</p>
<p>and what happens between two human beings</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a magic that just grabs them.</p>
<p>Like nothing else matters in the world</p>
<p>and somehow you&rsquo;ve been searching for this feeling,</p>
<p>this moment, this person your whole life.</p>
<p>That feeling, the philosophers can have a lot of fun</p>
<p>with that one and also say that that&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>You can have a biological explanation,</p>
<p>you can have all kinds of&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all fake, it&rsquo;s actually&hellip;</p>
<p>Ayn Rand will say it&rsquo;s all selfish.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different interpretations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it to the philosophers.</p>
<p>The point is the feeling sure as hell feels very real.</p>
<p>And if my toaster makes me feel</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s the only toaster in the world.</p>
<p>And when I leave and I miss the toaster</p>
<p>and when I come back, I&rsquo;m excited to see the toaster</p>
<p>and my life is meaningful and joyful</p>
<p>and the friends I have around me get a better version of me</p>
<p>because that toaster exists.</p>
<p>That sure as hell feels like a conscious toaster.</p>
<p>Is that psychologically different to having a dog?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Because I mean most people would dispute</p>
<p>whether we can say a dog&hellip;</p>
<p>I would say a dog is undoubtedly conscious,</p>
<p>but some people say it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s degrees of consciousness and so on,</p>
<p>but people are definitely much more uncomfortable</p>
<p>saying a toaster can be conscious than a dog.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still a deep connection.</p>
<p>You could say our relationship with the dog</p>
<p>has more to do with anthropomorphism.</p>
<p>Like we kind of project the human being onto it.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>We can do the same damn thing with a toaster.</p>
<p>Yes, but you can look into the dog&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<p>and you can see that it&rsquo;s sad,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s delighted to see you again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a dog, by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m a dog person or a cat person.</p>
<p>And dogs are actually incredibly good</p>
<p>at using their eyes to do just that.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t imagine that a dog is remotely</p>
<p>as close to being intelligent as an AI intelligence,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s certainly capable</p>
<p>of communicating emotionally with us.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what I would venture to say.</p>
<p>We tend to think because AI plays chess well</p>
<p>and is able to fold proteins now well,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s intelligent.</p>
<p>I would argue that in order to communicate with humans,</p>
<p>in order to have emotional intelligence,</p>
<p>it actually requires another order</p>
<p>of magnitude of intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to be flawed.</p>
<p>Solving a mathematical puzzle is not the same</p>
<p>as the full complexity of human to human interaction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually, we humans just take for granted</p>
<p>the things we&rsquo;re really good at.</p>
<p>Nonstop, people tell me how shitty people are driving.</p>
<p>No, humans are incredible at driving.</p>
<p>Bipedal walking, walking, object manipulation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re incredible at this.</p>
<p>And so people tend to discount the things</p>
<p>we all just take for granted.</p>
<p>And one of those things that they discount</p>
<p>is our ability, the dance of conversation</p>
<p>and interaction with each other.</p>
<p>The ability to morph ideas together.</p>
<p>The ability to get angry at each other</p>
<p>and then to miss each other.</p>
<p>Like to create a tension that makes life fun</p>
<p>and difficult and challenging in a way that&rsquo;s meaningful.</p>
<p>That is a skill that&rsquo;s learned</p>
<p>and AI would need to solve that problem.</p>
<p>I mean, in some sense, what you&rsquo;re saying is</p>
<p>AI cannot become meaningfully emotional, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>until it experiences some kind of internal conflict</p>
<p>that is unable to reconcile these various aspects</p>
<p>of reality or its reality with a decision to make.</p>
<p>And then it feels sad, necessarily,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>And I certainly can&rsquo;t dispute that.</p>
<p>That may very well be how it works.</p>
<p>I think the only way to find out is to do it.</p>
<p>And to build it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and leave it to the philosophers</p>
<p>if it actually feels sad or not.</p>
<p>The point is the robot will be sitting there alone</p>
<p>having an internal conflict, an existential crisis,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s required for it to have a deep,</p>
<p>meaningful connection with another human being.</p>
<p>Now, does it actually feel that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to throw something else at you,</p>
<p>which troubles me on reading it.</p>
<p>Noah Harari&rsquo;s book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s written about this kind of thing</p>
<p>on various occasions.</p>
<p>And he sees biochemistry as an algorithm.</p>
<p>And then AI will necessarily be able to hack that algorithm</p>
<p>and do it better than humans.</p>
<p>So there will be AI better at writing music</p>
<p>that we appreciate than Mozart ever could,</p>
<p>or writing better than Shakespeare ever did, and so on.</p>
<p>Because biochemistry is algorithmic,</p>
<p>and all you need to do is figure out</p>
<p>which bits of the algorithm to play</p>
<p>to make us feel good or bad or appreciate things.</p>
<p>And as a biochemist, I find that argument</p>
<p>an argument close to irrefutable and not very enjoyable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the sound of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just my reaction as a human being.</p>
<p>You might like the sound of it because that says</p>
<p>that AI is capable of the same kind of emotional feelings</p>
<p>about the world as we are,</p>
<p>because the whole thing is an algorithm</p>
<p>and you can program an algorithm, and there you are.</p>
<p>He then has a peculiar final chapter</p>
<p>where he talks about consciousness</p>
<p>in rather separate terms.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s talking about meditating and so on</p>
<p>and getting in touch with his inner conscious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t meditate, I don&rsquo;t know anything about that.</p>
<p>But he wrote in very different terms about it,</p>
<p>as if somehow it&rsquo;s a way out of the algorithm.</p>
<p>Now, it seems to me that consciousness in that sense</p>
<p>is capable of scuppering the algorithm.</p>
<p>I think in terms of the biochemical feedback loops</p>
<p>and so on, it is undoubtedly algorithmic.</p>
<p>But in terms of what we decide to do,</p>
<p>it can be much more based on an emotion.</p>
<p>We can just think, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t resolve this complex situation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do that.</p>
<p>And that can be based on, in effect, a different currency,</p>
<p>which is the currency of feelings and something</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t have very much personal control over.</p>
<p>And then it comes back around to you</p>
<p>and what are you trying to get at with AI?</p>
<p>Do we need to have some system</p>
<p>which is capable of overriding a rational decision</p>
<p>which cannot be made</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s too much conflicting information</p>
<p>by effectively an emotional judgmental decision</p>
<p>that just says, do this and see what happens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what consciousness is really doing in my view.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the question is whether it&rsquo;s a different process</p>
<p>or just a higher level process.</p>
<p>I might, you know, the idea that biochemistry</p>
<p>is an algorithm is, to me, an oversimplistic view.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that the moment you say it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s irrefutable, but it simplifies.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And in the process loses something fundamental.</p>
<p>So for example, calling a universe</p>
<p>and an information processing system, sure, yes.</p>
<p>You could make that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a computer that&rsquo;s performing computations,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re missing the process of the entropy</p>
<p>somehow leading to pockets of complexity</p>
<p>that creates these beautiful artifacts</p>
<p>that are incredibly complex and they&rsquo;re like machines.</p>
<p>And then those machines are through the process of evolution</p>
<p>are constructing even further complexity.</p>
<p>Like in calling universe information processing machine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing those little local pockets</p>
<p>and how difficult it is to create them.</p>
<p>So the question to me is if biochemistry is an algorithm,</p>
<p>how difficult is it to create a software system</p>
<p>that runs the human body, which I think is incorrect.</p>
<p>I think that is going to take so long.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s going to be centuries from now</p>
<p>to be able to reconstruct the human.</p>
<p>Now, what I would venture to say</p>
<p>to get some of the magic of a human being</p>
<p>with what we&rsquo;re saying with the emotions</p>
<p>and the interactions and like a dog makes a smile</p>
<p>and joyful and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>that will come much sooner,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t require us to reverse engineer</p>
<p>the algorithm of biochemistry.</p>
<p>Yes, but the toaster is making you happy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about whether you make the toaster happy.</p>
<p>No, it has to be.</p>
<p>It has to be.</p>
<p>The toaster has to be able to leave me happy.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s the toaster is the AI in this case</p>
<p>is very intelligent.</p>
<p>Yeah, the toaster has to be able to be unhappy and leave me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essential.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essential for my being able to miss the toaster.</p>
<p>If the toaster is just my servant,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not, or a provider of like services,</p>
<p>like tells me the weather makes toast,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to deep connection.</p>
<p>It has to have internal conflict.</p>
<p>You write about life and death.</p>
<p>It has to be able to be conscious of its mortality</p>
<p>and the finiteness of its existence.</p>
<p>And that life is for temporary</p>
<p>and therefore it needs to be more selective.</p>
<p>One of the most moving moments in the movies</p>
<p>from when I was a boy was the unplugging of Hal in 2001,</p>
<p>where that was the death of a sentient being</p>
<p>and Hal knew it.</p>
<p>So I think we all kind of know</p>
<p>that a sufficiently intelligent being</p>
<p>is going to have some form of consciousness,</p>
<p>but whether it would be like biological consciousness,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re thinking about how do we bring together,</p>
<p>I mean, obviously we&rsquo;re going to interact</p>
<p>more closely with AI,</p>
<p>but is a dog really like a toaster</p>
<p>or is there really some kind of difference there?</p>
<p>You were talking about biochemistry is algorithmic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not single algorithm</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very complex, of course it is.</p>
<p>So it may be that there are again conflicts</p>
<p>in the circuits of biochemistry,</p>
<p>but I have a feeling that the level of complexity</p>
<p>of the total biochemical system</p>
<p>at the level of a single cell is less complex</p>
<p>than the level of neural networking in the human brain</p>
<p>or in an AI.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I assumed that we were including the brain</p>
<p>in the biochemistry algorithm, because you have to&hellip;</p>
<p>I would see that as a higher level of organization</p>
<p>of neural networks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all using the same biochemical wiring</p>
<p>within themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the human brain is not just neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the immune system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the whole package.</p>
<p>I mean, to have a biochemical algorithm</p>
<p>that runs an intelligent biological system,</p>
<p>you have to include the whole damn thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty fascinating that it comes from like,</p>
<p>from an embryo, like the whole, I mean, oh boy.</p>
<p>I mean, if you can, what is a human being?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s just some code and then you built,</p>
<p>and then that says DNA doesn&rsquo;t just tell you what to build,</p>
<p>but how to build it.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing is impressive.</p>
<p>And the question is how difficult is it</p>
<p>to reverse engineer the whole shebang?</p>
<p>Very difficult.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to say impossible,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s much easier to build a human</p>
<p>than to reverse engineer, to build like a fake human,</p>
<p>human like thing than to reverse engineer</p>
<p>the entirety of the process of the evolution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if we are capable</p>
<p>of reverse engineering the whole thing.</p>
<p>If the human mind is capable of doing that.</p>
<p>I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t be a biologist if I wasn&rsquo;t trying,</p>
<p>but I know I can&rsquo;t understand the whole problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to understand the rudimentary outlines</p>
<p>of the problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another aspect though,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about developing from a single cell</p>
<p>to the human mind and all the part system,</p>
<p>subsystems that are part of the immune system and so on.</p>
<p>This is something that you&rsquo;ll talk about, I imagine,</p>
<p>with Michael Levin, but so little is known about,</p>
<p>you talk about reverse engineering,</p>
<p>so little is known about the developmental pathways</p>
<p>that go from a genome to going to a fully wired organism.</p>
<p>And a lot of it seems to depend on the same</p>
<p>in electrical interactions that I was talking about</p>
<p>happening at the level of single cells</p>
<p>and its interaction with the environment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole electrical field side to biology</p>
<p>that is not yet written into any of the textbooks,</p>
<p>which is about how does an embryo develop into</p>
<p>or a single cell develop into these complex systems?</p>
<p>What defines the head, what defines the immune system,</p>
<p>what defines the brain and so on?</p>
<p>That really is written in a language</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re only just beginning to understand</p>
<p>and frankly, biologists, most biologists</p>
<p>are still very reluctant to even get themselves tangled up</p>
<p>in questions like electrical fields influencing development.</p>
<p>It seems like mumbo jumbo to a lot of biologists</p>
<p>and it should not be because this is</p>
<p>the 21st century biology, this is where it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not gonna reverse engineer a human being</p>
<p>or the mind or any of these subsystems</p>
<p>until we understand how this developmental process</p>
<p>or how electricity in biology really works.</p>
<p>And if it is linked with feelings</p>
<p>and with consciousness and so on,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the, I mean, in the meantime, we have to try,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s where the answer lies.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s possible that the key to things</p>
<p>like consciousness are some of the more tricky aspects</p>
<p>of cognition might lie in that early development,</p>
<p>the interaction of electricity and biology.</p>
<p>Electrical fields.</p>
<p>But we already know the EEG and so on</p>
<p>is telling us a lot about brain function,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know which cells, which parts</p>
<p>of a neural network is giving rise to the EEG.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the basics.</p>
<p>The assumption is, I mean, we know it&rsquo;s neural networks,</p>
<p>we know it&rsquo;s multiple cells, hundreds or thousands</p>
<p>of cells involved in it and we assume</p>
<p>that it has to do with depolarization during action</p>
<p>potentials and so on.</p>
<p>But the mitochondria which are in there</p>
<p>have much more membranes than the plasma membrane</p>
<p>of the neuron and there&rsquo;s a much greater membrane potential</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s formed in parallel, very often parallel cristae,</p>
<p>which are capable of reinforcing a field</p>
<p>and generating fields over longer distances.</p>
<p>And nobody knows if that plays a role</p>
<p>in consciousness or not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s reasons to argue that it could,</p>
<p>but frankly we simply do not know</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not taken into consideration.</p>
<p>You look at the structure of the mitochondrial membranes</p>
<p>in the brains of simple things like Drosophila,</p>
<p>the fruit fly, and they have amazing structures.</p>
<p>You can see lots of little rectangular things</p>
<p>all lined up in amazing patterns.</p>
<p>What are they doing?</p>
<p>Why are they like that?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t the first clue.</p>
<p>What do you think about organoids and brain organoids</p>
<p>and so in a lab trying to study the development</p>
<p>of these in the Petri dish development of organs.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s promising?</p>
<p>Do you have to look at whole systems?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done anything like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about it.</p>
<p>The people who I&rsquo;ve talked to who do work on it</p>
<p>say amazing things can happen</p>
<p>and a bit of a brain grown in a dish</p>
<p>is capable of experiencing some kind of feelings</p>
<p>or even memories of its former brain.</p>
<p>Again, I have a feeling that until we understand</p>
<p>how to control the electrical fields</p>
<p>that control development, we&rsquo;re not going to understand</p>
<p>how to turn an organoid into a real functional system.</p>
<p>But how do we get that understanding?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>I mean, you would have to, I mean, one promising direction,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get your opinion on this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with the work of DeepMind</p>
<p>and AlphaFold with protein folding and so on.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that that will give us some breakthroughs in biology</p>
<p>trying to basically simulate and model the behavior</p>
<p>of trivial biological systems</p>
<p>as they become complex biological systems?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it will.</p>
<p>The interesting thing to me about protein folding</p>
<p>is that for a long time, my understanding,</p>
<p>this is not what I work on, so I may have got this wrong,</p>
<p>but my understanding is that you take the sequence</p>
<p>of a protein and you try to fold it.</p>
<p>And there are multiple ways in which it can fold.</p>
<p>And to come up with the correct conformation</p>
<p>is not a very easy thing because you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>from first principles from a string of letters,</p>
<p>which specify the string of amino acids.</p>
<p>But what actually happens is when a protein</p>
<p>is coming out of a ribosome,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming out of a charged tunnel</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in a very specific environment,</p>
<p>which is going to force this to go there now</p>
<p>and then this one to go there and this one to come like that.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re forcing a specific conformational set</p>
<p>of changes onto it as it comes out of the ribosome.</p>
<p>So by the time it&rsquo;s fully emerged,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already got its shape.</p>
<p>And that shape depended on the immediate environment</p>
<p>that it was emerging into one letter,</p>
<p>one amino acid at a time.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that the field was looking at it that way.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s correct,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s very characteristic of science,</p>
<p>which is to say it asks very often the wrong question</p>
<p>and then does really amazingly sophisticated analyses</p>
<p>on something having never thought to actually think,</p>
<p>well, what is biology doing?</p>
<p>And biology is giving you a charged electrical environment</p>
<p>that forces you to be this way.</p>
<p>Now, did DeepMind come up through patterns</p>
<p>with some answer that was like that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got absolutely no idea.</p>
<p>It ought to be possible to deduce that</p>
<p>from the shapes of proteins.</p>
<p>It would require a much greater skill</p>
<p>than the human mind has.</p>
<p>But the human mind is capable of saying, well, hang on,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s look at this exit tunnel and try and work out</p>
<p>what shape is this protein going to take?</p>
<p>And we can figure that out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting about the exit tunnel,</p>
<p>but like sometimes we get lucky</p>
<p>and just like in science, the simplified view</p>
<p>or the static view will actually solve the problem for us.</p>
<p>So in this case, it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>that the sequence of letters has a unique mapping</p>
<p>to our structure without considering how it unraveled.</p>
<p>So without considering the tunnel.</p>
<p>And so that seems to be the case in this situation</p>
<p>where the cool thing about proteins,</p>
<p>all the different shapes they can possibly take,</p>
<p>it actually seems to take very specific unique shapes</p>
<p>given the sequence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s forced on you by an exit tunnel.</p>
<p>So the problem is actually much simpler than you thought.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a whole army of proteins</p>
<p>which change the conformational state, chaperone proteins.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re only used when there&rsquo;s some presumably issue</p>
<p>with how it came out of the exit tunnel</p>
<p>and you wanna do it differently to that.</p>
<p>So very often the chaperone proteins will go there</p>
<p>and will influence the way in which it falls.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two ways of doing it.</p>
<p>Either you can look at the structures</p>
<p>and the sequences of all the proteins</p>
<p>and you can apply an immense mind to it</p>
<p>and figure out what the patterns are</p>
<p>and figure out what happened.</p>
<p>Or you can look at the actual situation where it is</p>
<p>and say, well, hang on, it was actually quite simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a charged environment</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s forced to come out this way.</p>
<p>And then the question will be,</p>
<p>well, do different ribosomes</p>
<p>have different charged environments?</p>
<p>What happens if a chaperone?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking a different set of questions</p>
<p>to come to the same answer in a way</p>
<p>which is telling you a much simpler story</p>
<p>and explains why it is rather than saying it could be,</p>
<p>this is one in a billion different possible conformational</p>
<p>states that this protein could have.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, well, it has this one</p>
<p>because that was the only one it could take</p>
<p>given its setting.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, currently humans are very good</p>
<p>at that kind of first principles thinking.</p>
<p>I was stepping back, but I think AI is really good</p>
<p>at collecting a huge amount of data</p>
<p>and a huge amount of data of observation of planets</p>
<p>and figure out that Earth is not at the center</p>
<p>of the universe, that there&rsquo;s actually a sun,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re orbiting the sun.</p>
<p>But then you can, as a human being, ask,</p>
<p>well, how do solar systems come to be?</p>
<p>What are the different forces that are required</p>
<p>to make this kind of pattern emerge?</p>
<p>And then you start to invent things like gravity.</p>
<p>I mixed up the ordering of gravity,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t considered as a thing that connects planets,</p>
<p>but we are able to think about those big picture things</p>
<p>as human beings.</p>
<p>AI is just very good to infer simple models</p>
<p>from a huge amount of data.</p>
<p>And the question is with biology,</p>
<p>we kind of go back and forth at how we solve biology.</p>
<p>Listen, protein folding was thought to be impossible</p>
<p>to solve, and there&rsquo;s a lot of brilliant PhD students</p>
<p>that worked one protein at a time</p>
<p>trying to figure out the structure.</p>
<p>And the fact that I was able to do that.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m not knocking it at all,</p>
<p>but I think that people have been asking</p>
<p>the wrong question.</p>
<p>But then, as the people start to ask</p>
<p>better and bigger questions,</p>
<p>the AI kind of enters the chat and says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll help you out with that.</p>
<p>Can I give you another example for my own work?</p>
<p>The risk of getting a disease as we get older,</p>
<p>there are genetic aspects to it.</p>
<p>If you spend your whole life overeating and smoking</p>
<p>and whatever, that&rsquo;s a whole separate question.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a genetic side to the risk.</p>
<p>And we know a few genes that increase your risk</p>
<p>of certain things.</p>
<p>And for probably 20 years now,</p>
<p>people have been doing what&rsquo;s called GWAS,</p>
<p>which is genome wide association studies.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve effectively scanned the entire genome</p>
<p>for any single nucleotide polymorphisms,</p>
<p>which is to say a single letter change in one place,</p>
<p>that has a higher association of being linked</p>
<p>with a particular disease or not.</p>
<p>And you can come up with thousands of these things</p>
<p>across the genome.</p>
<p>And if you add them all up and try and say,</p>
<p>well, so do they add up to explain</p>
<p>the known genetic risk of this disease?</p>
<p>And the known genetic risk often comes from twin studies.</p>
<p>And you can say that if this twin gets epilepsy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a 40 or 50% risk that the other twin,</p>
<p>identical twin will also get epilepsy.</p>
<p>Therefore, the genetic factor is about 50%.</p>
<p>And so the gene similarities that you see</p>
<p>should account for 50% of that known risk.</p>
<p>Very often it accounts for less than a 10th</p>
<p>of the known risk.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s two possible explanations.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one which people tend to do,</p>
<p>which is to say,</p>
<p>ah, well, we don&rsquo;t have enough statistical power.</p>
<p>If we, maybe there&rsquo;s a million,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve only found a thousand of them.</p>
<p>But if we find the other million,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re weakly related,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a huge number of them.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll account for that whole risk.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a billion of them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>The other way is to say,</p>
<p>well, hang on a minute, you&rsquo;re missing a system here.</p>
<p>That system is the mitochondrial DNA,</p>
<p>which people tend to dismiss because it&rsquo;s small</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t change very much.</p>
<p>But a few single letter changes in that mitochondrial DNA,</p>
<p>it controls some really basic processes.</p>
<p>It controls not only all the energy</p>
<p>that we need to live and to move around</p>
<p>and do everything we do,</p>
<p>but also biosynthesis to make the new building blocks</p>
<p>to make new cells.</p>
<p>And cancer cells very often kind of take over</p>
<p>the mitochondria and rewire them</p>
<p>so that instead of using them for making energy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re effectively using them as precursors</p>
<p>for the building blocks for biosynthesis.</p>
<p>You need to make new amino acids,</p>
<p>new nucleotides for DNA.</p>
<p>You wanna make new lipids to make your membranes and so on.</p>
<p>So they kind of rewire metabolism.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is that we&rsquo;ve got all these interactions</p>
<p>between mitochondrial DNA and the genes in the nucleus</p>
<p>that are overlooked completely</p>
<p>because people throw away,</p>
<p>literally throw away the mitochondrial genes.</p>
<p>And we can see in fruit flies that they interact</p>
<p>and produce big differences in risk.</p>
<p>So you can set AI onto this question</p>
<p>of exactly how many of these base changes there are.</p>
<p>And this is one possible solution</p>
<p>that maybe there are a million of them</p>
<p>and it does account for the greatest part of the risk.</p>
<p>Or the other one is they aren&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s just not there.</p>
<p>That actually the risk lies in something</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t even looking at.</p>
<p>And this is where human intuition is very important.</p>
<p>And just this feeling that, well, I&rsquo;m working on this</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s important and I&rsquo;m bloody minded about it.</p>
<p>And in the end, some people are right.</p>
<p>It turns out that it was important.</p>
<p>Can you get AI to do that, to be bloody minded?</p>
<p>And that, hang on a minute,</p>
<p>you might be missing a whole other system here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much bigger.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the moment of discovery of scientific revolution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving up on saying AI can&rsquo;t do something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it enough times about enough things.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s been a lot of progress.</p>
<p>And instead I&rsquo;m excited by the possibility</p>
<p>of AI helping humans.</p>
<p>But at the same time, just like I said,</p>
<p>we seem to dismiss the power of humans.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re so limited in so many ways</p>
<p>that we kind of, in what we feel like dumb ways,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re not strong, we&rsquo;re kind of our attention,</p>
<p>our attention, our memory is limited.</p>
<p>Our ability to focus on things is limited</p>
<p>in our own perception of what limited is.</p>
<p>But that actually, there&rsquo;s an incredible computer</p>
<p>behind the whole thing that makes this whole system work.</p>
<p>Our ability to interact with the environment,</p>
<p>to reason about the environment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s magic there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m hopeful that AI can capture</p>
<p>some of that same magic.</p>
<p>But that magic is not gonna look like</p>
<p>Deep Blue playing chess.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s going to be more interesting.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna look</p>
<p>like pattern finding either.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s essentially what you&rsquo;re telling me.</p>
<p>It does very well at the moment.</p>
<p>And my point is it works very well</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re looking for the right pattern.</p>
<p>But we are storytelling animals</p>
<p>and the hypothesis is a story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a testable story.</p>
<p>But a new hypothesis is a leap into the unknown</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a new story basically.</p>
<p>And it says this leads to this leads to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a causal set of storytelling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that the leap into the unknown</p>
<p>has a pattern of its own.</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible that it&rsquo;s learnable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a nice book by Arthur Kessler</p>
<p>on the nature of creativity.</p>
<p>And he likens it to a joke where the punchline goes off</p>
<p>in a completely unexpected direction</p>
<p>and says that this is the basis of human creativity.</p>
<p>That some creative switch of direction</p>
<p>to an unexpected place is similar to a joke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s how it works,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a nice idea and there must be some truth in it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of these,</p>
<p>most of the stories we tell are probably the wrong story</p>
<p>and probably going nowhere and probably not helpful.</p>
<p>And we definitely don&rsquo;t do as well</p>
<p>at seeing patterns in things.</p>
<p>But some of the most enjoyable human aspects</p>
<p>is finding a new story that goes to an unexpected place.</p>
<p>And again, these are all aspects</p>
<p>of what being human means to me.</p>
<p>And maybe these are all things</p>
<p>that AI figures out for itself,</p>
<p>or maybe they&rsquo;re just aspects.</p>
<p>But I just have the feeling sometimes</p>
<p>that the people who are trying to understand</p>
<p>what we are like,</p>
<p>if we wish to craft an AI system</p>
<p>which is somehow human like,</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have a firm enough grasp</p>
<p>of what humans really are like in terms of how we are built.</p>
<p>But we get a better, better understanding of that.</p>
<p>I agree with you completely.</p>
<p>We try to build a thing and then we go,</p>
<p>hang on a minute, there&rsquo;s another system here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually the attempt to build AI</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s human like,</p>
<p>is getting us to a deeper understanding of human beings.</p>
<p>The funny thing that I recently talked to Magnus Carlsen,</p>
<p>why they consider to be the greatest chess player</p>
<p>of all time.</p>
<p>And he talked about AlphaZero,</p>
<p>which is a system from DeepMind that plays chess.</p>
<p>And he had a funny comment.</p>
<p>He has a kind of dry sense of humor.</p>
<p>But he was extremely impressed</p>
<p>when he first saw AlphaZero play.</p>
<p>And he said that it did a lot of things</p>
<p>that could easily be mistaken for creativity.</p>
<p>So he like, as a typical human,</p>
<p>refused to give the system sort of its due.</p>
<p>Because he came up with a lot of things</p>
<p>that a lot of people are extremely impressed by.</p>
<p>Not just the sheer calculation,</p>
<p>but the brilliance of play.</p>
<p>So one of the things that it does</p>
<p>in really interesting ways is it sacrifices pieces.</p>
<p>So in chess, that means you basically take a few steps back</p>
<p>and then take a step forward.</p>
<p>You give away pieces for some future reward.</p>
<p>And that, for us humans, is where art is in chess.</p>
<p>You take big risks.</p>
<p>That for us humans, those risks are especially painful</p>
<p>because you have a fog of uncertainty before you.</p>
<p>So to take a risk now based on intuition</p>
<p>of I think this is the right risk to take,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many possibilities,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s where it takes guts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where art is, that&rsquo;s that danger.</p>
<p>And then the alpha,</p>
<p>alpha zero takes those same kind of risks</p>
<p>and does them even greater degree.</p>
<p>But of course, it does it from a,</p>
<p>well, you could easily reduce down</p>
<p>to a cold calculation over patterns.</p>
<p>But boy, when you see the final result,</p>
<p>it sure looks like the same kind of magic</p>
<p>that we see in creativity.</p>
<p>When we see creative play on the chessboard,</p>
<p>but the chessboard is very limited.</p>
<p>And the question is, as we get better and better,</p>
<p>can we do that same kind of creativity in mathematics,</p>
<p>in programming, and then eventually in biology, psychology,</p>
<p>and expand into more and more complex systems?</p>
<p>I was, I used to go running when I was a boy,</p>
<p>and fell running, which is to say, running up and down mountains.</p>
<p>And I was never particularly great at it,</p>
<p>but there were some people who were amazingly fast,</p>
<p>especially at running down.</p>
<p>And I realized in trying to do this,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s only really two ways,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s three possible ways of doing it,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only two that work.</p>
<p>Either you go extremely slowly and carefully,</p>
<p>and you figure out, okay, there&rsquo;s a stone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put my foot on this stone,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s another,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a muddy puddle I&rsquo;m going to avoid.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s slow, it&rsquo;s laborious.</p>
<p>You figure it out step by step.</p>
<p>Or you can just go incredibly fast,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t think about it at all.</p>
<p>The entire conscious mind is shut out of it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably the same playing table tennis</p>
<p>or something, there&rsquo;s something in the mind,</p>
<p>which is doing a whole lot of subconscious calculations</p>
<p>about exact, and it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>You can run at astonishing speed down a hillside</p>
<p>with no idea how you did it at all.</p>
<p>And then you panic, and you think,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to break my leg if I keep doing this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to think about where I&rsquo;m going to put my foot.</p>
<p>So you slow down a bit and try to bring</p>
<p>those conscious mind in, and then you do, you crash.</p>
<p>You cannot think consciously while running downhill.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s amazing how many calculations</p>
<p>the mind is able to make.</p>
<p>And now the problem with playing chess or something,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re able to make all of those subconscious</p>
<p>kind of forward calculations about</p>
<p>what is the likely outcome of this move now</p>
<p>in the way that we can by running down a hillside</p>
<p>or something, it&rsquo;s partly about what we have adapted to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partly about the reality of the world that we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Running fast downhill is something</p>
<p>that we better be bloody good at,</p>
<p>otherwise we&rsquo;re going to be eaten.</p>
<p>Whereas trying to calculate multiple, multiple moves</p>
<p>into the future is not something</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve ever been called on to do.</p>
<p>Two or three, four moves into the future</p>
<p>is quite enough for most of us most of the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so yeah, just solving chess may not,</p>
<p>we may not be as far towards solving the problem</p>
<p>of downhill running as we might think</p>
<p>just because we solve chess.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s beautiful to see creativity.</p>
<p>Humans create machines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to create art and art on a chessboard</p>
<p>and art otherwise.</p>
<p>Who knows how far that takes us.</p>
<p>So I mentioned Andrej Karpathy earlier.</p>
<p>Him and I are big fans of yours.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re taking votes, his suggestion was</p>
<p>you should write your next book on the Fermi Paradox.</p>
<p>So let me ask you on the topic of alien life.</p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;ve been talking about life</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re a kind of aliens,</p>
<p>how many alien civilizations are out there, do you think?</p>
<p>Well, the universe is very big, so some,</p>
<p>but not as many as most people would like to think</p>
<p>is my view because the idea that there is a trajectory</p>
<p>going from simple, simple cellular life like bacteria</p>
<p>all the way through to humans.</p>
<p>It seems to me there&rsquo;s some big gaps along that way</p>
<p>that the eukaryotic cell, the complex cell that we have</p>
<p>is the biggest of them, but also photosynthesis is another.</p>
<p>The other, another interesting gap is a long gap</p>
<p>from the origin of the eukaryotic cell</p>
<p>to the first animals.</p>
<p>That was about a billion years, maybe more than that.</p>
<p>A long delay in when oxygen began</p>
<p>to accumulate in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So from the first appearance of oxygen</p>
<p>in the Great Oxidation Event to enough for animals</p>
<p>to respire, it was close to two billion years.</p>
<p>Why so long?</p>
<p>It seems to be planetary factors.</p>
<p>It seems to be geology as much as in anything else.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really know what was going on.</p>
<p>So the idea that there&rsquo;s a kind of an inevitable march</p>
<p>towards complexity and sentient life,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think is right.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t, not to say it&rsquo;s not gonna happen,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s not gonna happen often.</p>
<p>So if you think of Earth,</p>
<p>given the geological constraints and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>do you have a sense that life, complex life,</p>
<p>intelligent life happened really quickly on Earth</p>
<p>or really long?</p>
<p>So just to get a sense of,</p>
<p>are you more sort of saying that it&rsquo;s very unlikely</p>
<p>to get the kind of conditions required to create humans?</p>
<p>Or is it, even if you have the condition,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just statistically difficult?</p>
<p>I think the, I mean, the problem,</p>
<p>the single great problem at the center of all of that,</p>
<p>to my mind, is the origin of the eukaryotic cell,</p>
<p>which happened once and without eukaryotes,</p>
<p>nothing else would have happened.</p>
<p>And that is something that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s super important,</p>
<p>the eukaryotes, but.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying a tantamount to saying that it is impossible</p>
<p>to build something as complex as a human being</p>
<p>from bacterial cells.</p>
<p>Totally agree in some deep fundamental way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just like a one cell going inside another.</p>
<p>Is that so difficult to get to work right?</p>
<p>That like.</p>
<p>Well, again, it happened once.</p>
<p>And if you think about, if you think,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m in a minority view in this position.</p>
<p>Most biologists probably wouldn&rsquo;t agree with me anyway.</p>
<p>But if you think about the starting point,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a simple cell, it&rsquo;s an alkyl cell,</p>
<p>we can be fairly sure about that.</p>
<p>So it looks a lot like a bacterium,</p>
<p>but is in fact from this other domain of life.</p>
<p>So it looks a lot like a bacterial cell.</p>
<p>That means it doesn&rsquo;t have anything.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have a nucleus.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really have complex endomembrane.</p>
<p>It has a little bit of stuff, but not that much.</p>
<p>And it takes up an endosymbiont.</p>
<p>So what happens next?</p>
<p>And the answer is basically everything</p>
<p>to do with complexity.</p>
<p>To me, there&rsquo;s a beautiful paradox here.</p>
<p>Plants and animals and fungi</p>
<p>all have exactly the same type of cell.</p>
<p>But they all have really different ways of living.</p>
<p>So a plant cell, it&rsquo;s photosynthetic.</p>
<p>They started out as algae in the oceans and so on.</p>
<p>So think of algal blooms, single cell things.</p>
<p>The basic cell structure that it&rsquo;s built from</p>
<p>is exactly the same with a couple of small differences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got chloroplasts as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a vacuole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a cell wall.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything else is exactly the same</p>
<p>in a plant cell and an animal cell.</p>
<p>And yet the ways of life are completely different.</p>
<p>So this cell structure did not evolve</p>
<p>in response to different ways of life,</p>
<p>different environments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the ocean doing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on land running around as part of an animal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fungus in a soil,</p>
<p>spreading out long shoots into whatever it may be, mycelium.</p>
<p>So they all have the same underlying cell structure.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Almost certainly it was driven by adaptation</p>
<p>to the internal environment,</p>
<p>to having these pesky endosymbionts</p>
<p>that forced all kinds of change on the host cell.</p>
<p>Now, in one way you could see that as a really good thing</p>
<p>because it may be that there&rsquo;s some inevitability</p>
<p>to this process that as soon as you got endosymbionts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more or less bound to go in that direction.</p>
<p>Or it could be that there&rsquo;s a huge fluke about it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost certain to go wrong</p>
<p>in just about every case possible.</p>
<p>That the conflict will lead to effectively war</p>
<p>leading to death and extinction.</p>
<p>And it simply doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>So maybe it happened millions of times</p>
<p>and it went wrong every time.</p>
<p>Or maybe it only happened once and it worked out</p>
<p>because it was inevitable.</p>
<p>And actually we simply do not know enough now</p>
<p>to say which of those two possibilities is true.</p>
<p>But both of them are a bit grim.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re leaning towards,</p>
<p>we just got really lucky in that one leap.</p>
<p>Like we got, so do you have a sense</p>
<p>that our galaxy, for example, has just maybe millions</p>
<p>of planets with bacteria living on it?</p>
<p>I would expect billions, tens of billions of planets</p>
<p>with bacteria living on it practically.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s probably what, five to 10 planets per star</p>
<p>of which I would hope that at least one</p>
<p>would have bacteria on.</p>
<p>So I expect bacteria to be very common.</p>
<p>I simply can&rsquo;t put a number otherwise.</p>
<p>I mean, I expect it will happen elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I think we&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>in a completely empty universe.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s not gonna happen inevitably.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something, it wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the only problem with complex life on earth.</p>
<p>I mentioned oxygen and animals and so on as well.</p>
<p>And even humans, we came along very late.</p>
<p>You go back 5 million years and would we be that impressed</p>
<p>if we came across a planet full of giraffes?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;d think, hey, there&rsquo;s life here</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a nice planet to colonize or something.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t think, oh, let&rsquo;s try and have a conversation</p>
<p>with this giraffe.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly we would think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what makes humans so interesting</p>
<p>from an alien perspective or how they would notice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk to you about cities too</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s an interesting perspective</p>
<p>of how to look at human civilization.</p>
<p>But your sense, I mean, of course you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an interesting world, it&rsquo;s an interesting galaxy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting universe to live in</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like every sun,</p>
<p>like 90% of solar systems have bacteria in it.</p>
<p>Imagine that world and the galaxy maybe has</p>
<p>just a handful if not one intelligent civilization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a wild world.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even think about that world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of thought that,</p>
<p>like one of the reasons it would be so exciting</p>
<p>to find life on Mars or Titan or whatever</p>
<p>is like if its life is elsewhere,</p>
<p>then surely, statistically, that life,</p>
<p>no matter how unlikely you query as multicellular organisms,</p>
<p>sex, violence, what else is extremely difficult?</p>
<p>I mean, photosynthesis, figuring out some machinery</p>
<p>that involves the chemistry and the environment</p>
<p>to allow the building up of complex organisms,</p>
<p>surely that would arise.</p>
<p>But man, I don&rsquo;t know how I would feel</p>
<p>about just bacteria everywhere.</p>
<p>Well, it would be depressing if it was true.</p>
<p>I suppose depressing, I don&rsquo;t think, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s more depressing,</p>
<p>bacteria everywhere or nothing everywhere.</p>
<p>Yes, either of them are chilling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But whether it&rsquo;s chilling or not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think should force us to change our view</p>
<p>about whether it&rsquo;s real or not.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m saying may or may not be true.</p>
<p>So how would you feel if we discovered life on Mars?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It sounds like you would be less excited than some others</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like, well.</p>
<p>What I would be most interested in</p>
<p>is how similar to life on Earth it would be.</p>
<p>It would actually turn into quite a subtle problem</p>
<p>because the likelihood of life having gone to and fro</p>
<p>between Mars and the Earth is quite,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say high, but it&rsquo;s not low, it&rsquo;s quite feasible.</p>
<p>And so if we found life on Mars</p>
<p>and it had very similar genetic code,</p>
<p>but it was slightly different,</p>
<p>most people would interpret that immediately</p>
<p>as evidence that they&rsquo;ve been transit one way or the other</p>
<p>and that it was a common origin of life on Mars</p>
<p>or on the Earth and it went one way or the other way.</p>
<p>The other way to see that question though would be to say,</p>
<p>well, actually the beginnings of life</p>
<p>lie in deterministic chemistry and thermodynamics,</p>
<p>starting with the most likely abundant materials,</p>
<p>CO2 and water and a wet rocky planet.</p>
<p>And Mars was wet and rocky at the beginning.</p>
<p>And will, I won&rsquo;t say inevitably,</p>
<p>but potentially almost inevitably come up</p>
<p>with a genetic code which is not very far away</p>
<p>from the genetic code that we already have.</p>
<p>So we see subtle differences in the genetic code.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>Could be very difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>Is it possible, do you think, to tell the difference</p>
<p>of something that truly originated?</p>
<p>I think if the stereochemistry was different,</p>
<p>we have sugars, for example, that are the L form</p>
<p>or the D form and we have D sugars and L amino acids</p>
<p>right across all of life.</p>
<p>But lipids, the bacteria have one stereoisomer</p>
<p>and the bacteria have the other, the opposite stereoisomer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s perfectly possible to use one or the other one.</p>
<p>And the same would almost certainly go for,</p>
<p>and I think George Church has been trying to make life</p>
<p>based on the opposite stereoisomer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s perfectly possible to do and it will work.</p>
<p>And if we were to find life on Mars</p>
<p>that was using the opposite stereoisomer,</p>
<p>that would be unequivocal evidence</p>
<p>that life had started independently there.</p>
<p>So hopefully the life we find will be on Titan and Europa</p>
<p>or something like that where it&rsquo;s less likely</p>
<p>that we shared and it&rsquo;s harsher conditions</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s gonna be weirder kind of life.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t count on that because if life started</p>
<p>in deep sea hydrothermal vents here, that&rsquo;s pretty harsh.</p>
<p>So Titan is different.</p>
<p>Europa is probably quite similar to Earth</p>
<p>in the sense that we&rsquo;re dealing with an ocean,</p>
<p>some acidic ocean there, as the early Earth would have been.</p>
<p>And it almost certainly has hydrothermal systems.</p>
<p>Same with Enceladus.</p>
<p>We can tell that from these plumes</p>
<p>coming from the surface through the ice.</p>
<p>We know there&rsquo;s a liquid ocean</p>
<p>and we can tell roughly what the chemistry is.</p>
<p>For Titan, we&rsquo;re dealing with liquid methane</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So that would really, if there really is life there,</p>
<p>it would really have to be very, very different</p>
<p>to anything that we know on Earth.</p>
<p>So the hard leap, the hardest leap,</p>
<p>the most important leap is from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s eukaryotic.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the second, if we&rsquo;re ranking?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, you gave a lot of emphasis on photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that would be my second one, I think.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not so much, I mean,</p>
<p>photosynthesis is part of the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult thing to do.</p>
<p>Again, we know it happened once.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know why it happened once.</p>
<p>But the fact that it was kind of taken on board completely</p>
<p>by plants and algae and so on as chloroplasts</p>
<p>and did very well in completely different environments</p>
<p>and then on land and whatever else seems to suggest</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no problem with exploring,</p>
<p>whether you could have a separate origin</p>
<p>that explored this whole domain over there</p>
<p>that the bacteria had never gone into.</p>
<p>So that kind of says that the reason</p>
<p>that it only happened once is probably</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s difficult, because the wiring is difficult.</p>
<p>But then it happened at least 2.2 billion years ago,</p>
<p>right before the GOE, maybe as long as 3 billion years ago,</p>
<p>when there are, some people say there are whiffs of oxygen,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just kind of traces in the fossil</p>
<p>in the geochemical record that say,</p>
<p>maybe there was a bit of oxygen then.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really disputed.</p>
<p>Some people say it goes all the way back</p>
<p>four billion years ago and then it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And the common ancestor of life on Earth was photosynthetic.</p>
<p>So immediately you&rsquo;ve got groups of people</p>
<p>who disagree over a two billion year period of time</p>
<p>about when it started.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s take the latest date when it&rsquo;s unequivocal,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 2.2 billion years ago,</p>
<p>through to around about the time of the Cambrian explosion</p>
<p>when oxygen levels definitely got close to modern levels,</p>
<p>which was around about 550 million years ago.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve gone more than one and a half billion years</p>
<p>where the Earth was in stasis.</p>
<p>Nothing much changed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known as the boring billion, in fact.</p>
<p>Probably stuff was, that was when eukaryotes arose</p>
<p>somewhere in there, but it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>So this idea that the world is constantly changing,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re constantly evolving,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re moving up some ramp is a very human idea.</p>
<p>But in reality, there are kind of tipping points</p>
<p>to a new stable equilibrium where the cells</p>
<p>that are producing oxygen are precisely counterbalanced</p>
<p>by the cells that are consuming that oxygen,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s 21% now and has been that way</p>
<p>for hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p>We have a very precise balance.</p>
<p>You go through a tipping point and you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where the next stable state&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>but it can be a long way from here.</p>
<p>And so if we change the world with global warming,</p>
<p>there will be a tipping point.</p>
<p>The question is where and when,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the next stable state?</p>
<p>It may be uninhabitable to us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be habitable to life, for sure.</p>
<p>But there may be something like the Permian extinction</p>
<p>where 95% of species go extinct</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a five to 10 million year gap</p>
<p>and then life recovers, but without humans.</p>
<p>And the question statistically, well, without humans,</p>
<p>but statistically does that ultimately lead</p>
<p>to greater complexity, more interesting life,</p>
<p>more intelligent life?</p>
<p>Well, after the first appearance of oxygen with the GOE,</p>
<p>there was a tipping point which led</p>
<p>to a longterm stable state that was equivalent</p>
<p>to the Black Sea today, which is to say oxygenated</p>
<p>at the very surface and stagnant, sterile,</p>
<p>not sterile, but sulfurous, lower down.</p>
<p>And that was stable certainly around the continental margins</p>
<p>for more than a billion years.</p>
<p>It was not a state that led to progression</p>
<p>in an obvious way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting to think about evolution,</p>
<p>like what leads to stable states</p>
<p>and how often are</p>
<p>evolutionary pressures emerging from the environment.</p>
<p>So maybe other planets are able</p>
<p>to create evolutionary pressures, chemical pressures,</p>
<p>whatever, some kind of pressure that say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re screwed unless you get your shit together</p>
<p>in the next like 10,000 years, like a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>It seems like Earth, like the boring building</p>
<p>might be explained in two ways.</p>
<p>One is super difficult to take any kind of next step.</p>
<p>And the second way it could be explained</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s no reason to take the next step.</p>
<p>No, I think there is no reason, but at the end of it,</p>
<p>there was a snowball Earth.</p>
<p>So there was a planetary catastrophe on a huge scale</p>
<p>where the ice was, the sea was frozen at the equator.</p>
<p>And that forced change in one way or another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not long after that, 100 million years,</p>
<p>perhaps after that, so not a short time,</p>
<p>but this is when we begin to see animals.</p>
<p>There was a shift again, another tipping point</p>
<p>that led to catastrophic change</p>
<p>that led to a takeoff then.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know why, but one of the reasons</p>
<p>why that I discuss in the book is about sulfate</p>
<p>being washed into the oceans,</p>
<p>which sounds incredibly parochial.</p>
<p>But the issue is, I mean, what the data is showing,</p>
<p>we can track roughly how oxygen was going</p>
<p>into the atmosphere from carbon isotopes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two main isotopes of carbon</p>
<p>that we need to think about here.</p>
<p>One is carbon 12, 99% of carbon is carbon 12.</p>
<p>And then 1% of carbon is carbon 13,</p>
<p>which is a stable isotope.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s carbon 14, which is a trivial radioactive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s trivial in amount.</p>
<p>So carbon 13 is 1%.</p>
<p>And life and enzymes generally,</p>
<p>you can think of carbon atoms as little balls</p>
<p>bouncing around, ping pong balls bouncing around.</p>
<p>Carbon 12 moves a little bit faster than carbon 13</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s lighter and it&rsquo;s more likely</p>
<p>to encounter an enzyme.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s more likely to be fixed into organic matter.</p>
<p>And so organic matter is enriched.</p>
<p>And this is just an observation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent</p>
<p>compared to carbon 13,</p>
<p>relative to what you would expect if it was just equal.</p>
<p>And if you then bury organic matter as coal</p>
<p>or oil or whatever it may be,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s no longer oxidized.</p>
<p>So some oxygen remains leftover in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>And you can work out historically</p>
<p>how much oxygen there must&rsquo;ve been in the atmosphere</p>
<p>by how much carbon was being buried.</p>
<p>And you think, well, how can we possibly know</p>
<p>how much carbon was being buried?</p>
<p>And the answer is, well, if you&rsquo;re burying carbon 12,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re leaving behind is more carbon 13 in the oceans</p>
<p>and that precipitates out into limestone.</p>
<p>So you can look at limestones over these ages</p>
<p>and work out what&rsquo;s the carbon 13 signal.</p>
<p>And that gives you a kind of a feedback</p>
<p>on what the oxygen content.</p>
<p>Right before the Cambrian explosion,</p>
<p>there was what&rsquo;s called a negative isotope anomaly excursion,</p>
<p>which is basically the carbon 13 goes down</p>
<p>by a massive amount and then back up again</p>
<p>10 million years later.</p>
<p>And what that seems to be saying is the amount</p>
<p>of carbon 12 in the oceans was disappearing,</p>
<p>which is to say it was being oxidized.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s being oxidized, it&rsquo;s consuming oxygen.</p>
<p>And that should, so a big carbon 13 signal says</p>
<p>the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is really going down,</p>
<p>which means there&rsquo;s much more carbon 12</p>
<p>being taken out and being oxidized.</p>
<p>Sorry, this is getting too complex, but.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a good way to estimate the amount of oxygen.</p>
<p>If you calculate the amount of oxygen</p>
<p>based on the assumption that all this carbon 12</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being taken out is being oxidized by oxygen,</p>
<p>the answer is all the oxygen in the atmosphere</p>
<p>gets stripped out, there is none left.</p>
<p>And yet the rest of the geological indicators say,</p>
<p>no, there&rsquo;s oxygen in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a kind of a paradox.</p>
<p>And the only way to explain this paradox</p>
<p>just on mass balance of how much stuff is in the air,</p>
<p>how much stuff is in the oceans and so on,</p>
<p>is to assume that oxygen was not the oxygen,</p>
<p>it was sulfate.</p>
<p>Sulfate was being washed into the oceans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used as an electron acceptor</p>
<p>by sulfate reducing bacteria,</p>
<p>just as we use oxygen as an electron acceptor.</p>
<p>So they pass their electrons to sulfate instead of oxygen.</p>
<p>And. Bacteria did.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So these are bacteria.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re oxidizing carbon, organic carbon with sulfate,</p>
<p>passing the electrons onto sulfate,</p>
<p>that reacts with iron to form iron pyrite or fool&rsquo;s gold,</p>
<p>sinks down to the bottom, gets buried out of the system.</p>
<p>And this can account for the mass balance.</p>
<p>So why does it matter?</p>
<p>It matters because what it says is</p>
<p>there was a chance event,</p>
<p>tectonically there was a lot of sulfate sitting on land</p>
<p>as some kind of mineral.</p>
<p>So calcium sulfate minerals, for example, are evaporitic.</p>
<p>And because there happened to be</p>
<p>some continental collisions, mountain building,</p>
<p>the sulfate was pushed up the side of a mountain</p>
<p>and happened to get washed into the ocean.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I wonder how many happy accidents</p>
<p>like that are possible.</p>
<p>Statistically, it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>Maybe you can rule that in statistically,</p>
<p>but this is the course of life on earth.</p>
<p>Without all that sulfate being raised up,</p>
<p>this Cambrian explosion almost certainly</p>
<p>would not have happened.</p>
<p>And then we wouldn&rsquo;t have had animals and so on and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this kind of explanation of the Cambrian explosion.</p>
<p>So let me actually say in several ways.</p>
<p>So folks who challenge the validity</p>
<p>of the theory of evolution will give us an example.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not well studied in this,</p>
<p>but will give us an example of the Cambrian explosion</p>
<p>as like, this thing is weird.</p>
<p>Oh, it is weird, yeah.</p>
<p>So the question I would have is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the biggest mystery or gap in understanding</p>
<p>about evolution?</p>
<p>Is it the Cambrian explosion?</p>
<p>And if so, what&rsquo;s our best understanding</p>
<p>of how to explain, first of all, what is it?</p>
<p>In my understanding, in the short amount of time,</p>
<p>maybe 10 million years, 100 million years,</p>
<p>something like that, a huge number of animals,</p>
<p>a variety, diversity of animals were created.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&rsquo;s like five questions in there.</p>
<p>Is that the biggest mystery?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a particularly big mystery</p>
<p>really anymore.</p>
<p>There are still mysteries about why then.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve just said sulfate being washed</p>
<p>into the oceans is one.</p>
<p>It needs oxygen and oxygen levels rose around that time.</p>
<p>So probably before that, they weren&rsquo;t high enough</p>
<p>for animals.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re seeing with the Cambrian explosion</p>
<p>is the beginning of predators and prey relationships.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing modern ecosystems and we&rsquo;re seeing arms races</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re seeing the full creativity of evolution unleashed.</p>
<p>So I talked about the boring billion,</p>
<p>nothing happens for one and a half billion years,</p>
<p>one and a half billion years.</p>
<p>The assumption, and this is completely wrong,</p>
<p>this assumption, is then that evolution works really slowly</p>
<p>and that you need billions of years</p>
<p>to affect some small change</p>
<p>and then another billion years to do something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely wrong.</p>
<p>Evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it stays that way</p>
<p>for tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p>And Steven Jay Gould used to argue this,</p>
<p>he called it punctuated equilibrium,</p>
<p>but he was doing it to do with animals</p>
<p>and to do with the last 500 million years or so,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s much less obvious</p>
<p>than if you think about the entire planetary history.</p>
<p>And then you realize that the first two billion years</p>
<p>was bacteria only.</p>
<p>You have the origin of life,</p>
<p>two billion years of just bacteria,</p>
<p>oxygen photosynthesis arising here.</p>
<p>Then you have a global catastrophe,</p>
<p>snowball earths and great oxidation event</p>
<p>and then another billion years of nothing happening</p>
<p>and then some period of upheavals</p>
<p>and then another snowball earth</p>
<p>and then suddenly you see the Cambrian explosion.</p>
<p>This is long periods of stasis</p>
<p>where the world is in a stable state</p>
<p>and is not geared towards increasing complexity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just everything is in balance.</p>
<p>And only when you have a catastrophic level,</p>
<p>global level problem like a snowball earth,</p>
<p>it forces everything out of balance</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a tipping point and you end up somewhere else.</p>
<p>Now, the idea that evolution is slow is wrong.</p>
<p>It can be incredibly fast.</p>
<p>And I mentioned earlier on that you can,</p>
<p>in theory, it would take half a million years</p>
<p>to invent an eye, for example, from a light sensitive spot.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take long to convert</p>
<p>one kind of tube into a tube with nobbles on it</p>
<p>into a tube with arms on it and then multiple arms</p>
<p>and then at one end is the head</p>
<p>where it starts out as a swelling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not difficult intellectually to understand</p>
<p>how these things can happen.</p>
<p>It boggles the mind that it can happen so quickly,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re used to human timescales.</p>
<p>And what we need to talk about is generations of things</p>
<p>that live for a year in the ocean.</p>
<p>And then a million years is a million generations.</p>
<p>And the amount of change that you can do,</p>
<p>it can affect in that period of time is enormous.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re dealing with large populations of things</p>
<p>where selection is sensitive to pretty small changes</p>
<p>and can, so again, as soon as you throw in</p>
<p>the competition of predators and prey</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re ramping up the scale of evolution,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not very surprising that it happens very quickly</p>
<p>when the environment allows it to happen.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a big mystery.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of details that need to be filled in.</p>
<p>I mean, the big mystery in biology is consciousness.</p>
<p>The big mystery in biology is consciousness.</p>
<p>Well, intelligence is kind of a mystery too.</p>
<p>I mean, you said biology, not psychology.</p>
<p>Because from a biology perspective,</p>
<p>it seems like intelligence and consciousness</p>
<p>all are the same, like weird, like all the brain stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see intelligence as necessarily that difficult,</p>
<p>I suppose.</p>
<p>I mean, I see it as a form of computing</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know much about computing, so I&hellip;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know much about consciousness either.</p>
<p>So I mean, I suppose, oh, I see.</p>
<p>I see, I see, I see, I see.</p>
<p>That consciousness you do know a lot about as a human being.</p>
<p>No, no, I mean, I think I can understand the wiring</p>
<p>of a brain as a series of, in pretty much the same way</p>
<p>as a computer in theory, in terms of the circuitry of it.</p>
<p>The mystery to me is how this system gives rise to feelings,</p>
<p>as we were talking about earlier on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just, I think we oversimplify intelligence.</p>
<p>I think the dance, the magic of reasoning</p>
<p>is as interesting as the magic of feeling.</p>
<p>We tend to think of reasoning as like very,</p>
<p>running a very simplistic algorithm.</p>
<p>I think reasoning is the interplay between memory,</p>
<p>whatever the hell is going on, the unconscious mind,</p>
<p>all of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to diminish it in any way at all.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s extraordinarily exquisitely complex,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t see a logical difficulty with how it works.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I mean, I agree with you, but sometimes, yeah,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big cloak of mystery around consciousness.</p>
<p>Let me compare it with classical versus quantum physics.</p>
<p>Classical physics is logical, and you can understand the kind</p>
<p>of language we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost at the human level, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with stars and things that we can see.</p>
<p>And when you get to quantum mechanics and things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s practically impossible for the human mind</p>
<p>to compute what just happened there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that is the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you understand mathematically</p>
<p>that the notes of a musical composition, that&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>
<p>But why it makes you feel a certain way,</p>
<p>that is much harder to understand.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really, but it was interesting framing</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a mystery at the core of biology.</p>
<p>I wonder who solves consciousness.</p>
<p>I tend to think consciousness will</p>
<p>be solved by the engineer, meaning the person who builds</p>
<p>it, who keeps trying to build the thing,</p>
<p>versus biology, such a complicated system.</p>
<p>I feel like the building blocks of consciousness</p>
<p>from a biological perspective are like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the final creation of a human being.</p>
<p>So you have to understand the whole damn thing.</p>
<p>You said the electrical field, but like,</p>
<p>electrical field is plus plus.</p>
<p>Everything, the whole shebang.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m inclined to agree.</p>
<p>I mean, my feeling is from my meager knowledge</p>
<p>of the history of science is that the biggest breakthrough</p>
<p>has usually come through from a field that was not related.</p>
<p>So if anyone is not going to be a biologist who</p>
<p>solves consciousness, just because biologists</p>
<p>are too embedded in the nature of the problem.</p>
<p>And then nobody&rsquo;s going to believe you when you&rsquo;ve done it,</p>
<p>because nobody&rsquo;s going to be able to prove that this AI is</p>
<p>in fact conscious and sad in any case,</p>
<p>and any more than you can prove that a dog is</p>
<p>conscious and sad.</p>
<p>So it tells you that it is in good language,</p>
<p>and you must believe it.</p>
<p>But I think most people will accept,</p>
<p>if faced with that, that that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>All of this probability of complex life,</p>
<p>in one way, I think why it matters is that my expectation,</p>
<p>I suppose, is that we will be over the next 100 years</p>
<p>or so, if we survive at all, that AI will increasingly</p>
<p>dominate.</p>
<p>And pretty much anything that we put out</p>
<p>into space looking for other, well, for the universe,</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s out there, will be AI, won&rsquo;t be us.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t be doing that.</p>
<p>Or when we do, it&rsquo;ll be on a much more limited scale.</p>
<p>I suppose the same would apply to any alien civilization.</p>
<p>So perhaps rather than looking for signs of life out there,</p>
<p>we should be looking for AI out there.</p>
<p>But then we face the problem that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see how a planet is going to give rise directly to AI.</p>
<p>I can see how a planet can give rise directly to organic life.</p>
<p>And if the principles that govern the evolution of life</p>
<p>on Earth apply to other planets as well,</p>
<p>and I think a lot of them would, then</p>
<p>the likelihood of ending up with a humanlike civilization</p>
<p>capable of giving rise to AI in the first place</p>
<p>is massively limited.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done it once, perhaps it takes over</p>
<p>the universe, and maybe there&rsquo;s no issue.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that the two are necessarily linked,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not going to just turn a sterile planet</p>
<p>into an AI life form without the intermediary of the organics</p>
<p>first.</p>
<p>So you have to run the full evolutionary computation</p>
<p>with the organics to create AI.</p>
<p>How does AI bootstrap itself up without the aid, if you like,</p>
<p>of an intelligent designer?</p>
<p>The origin of AI is going to have</p>
<p>to be in the chemistry of a planet.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not a limiting factor, right?</p>
<p>So let me ask the Fermi paradox question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we live in this incredibly dark and beautiful</p>
<p>world of just billions of planets with bacteria on it</p>
<p>and very few intelligent civilizations,</p>
<p>and yet there&rsquo;s a few out there.</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t we, at scale, seen them visit us?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>Is it because they don&rsquo;t exist?</p>
<p>Well, don&rsquo;t exist in the right part of the universe</p>
<p>at the right time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the simplest answer for it.</p>
<p>Is that the one you find the most compelling,</p>
<p>or is there some other explanation?</p>
<p>I find that, no, it&rsquo;s not that I find it more compelling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that I find more probable.</p>
<p>And I find all of them, I mean, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of handwaving in this.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to read out from what I know about life on Earth</p>
<p>to what might happen somewhere else.</p>
<p>And it gives, to my mind, a bit of a pessimistic view</p>
<p>of bacteria everywhere and only occasional intelligent life</p>
<p>and running forward humans only once on Earth and nothing else</p>
<p>that you would necessarily be any more excited about making</p>
<p>contact with than you would be making contact with them</p>
<p>on Earth.</p>
<p>So I think the chances are pretty limited.</p>
<p>And the chances of us surviving are pretty limited, too,</p>
<p>in the way we&rsquo;re going on at the moment.</p>
<p>The likelihood of us not making ourselves extinct</p>
<p>within the next few hundred years,</p>
<p>possibly within the next 50 or 100 years, seems quite small.</p>
<p>I hope we can do better than that.</p>
<p>So maybe the only thing that will survive from humanity</p>
<p>will be AI.</p>
<p>And maybe AI, once it exists and once</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s capable of effectively copying itself and cutting</p>
<p>humans out of the loop, then maybe that</p>
<p>will take over the universe.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a kind of inherent sadness</p>
<p>to the way you described that.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that also potentially beautiful,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the next step of life, I suppose,</p>
<p>from your perspective, as long as it carries the flame</p>
<p>of consciousness somehow?</p>
<p>No, I think, yes, there can be some beauty to it</p>
<p>being the next step of life.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if consciousness matters or not,</p>
<p>from that point of view, to be honest with you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some sadness, yes, probably,</p>
<p>because I think it comes down to the selfishness</p>
<p>that we were talking about earlier on.</p>
<p>I am an individual with a desire not</p>
<p>to be displaced from life.</p>
<p>I want to stay alive.</p>
<p>I want to be here.</p>
<p>So I suppose the threat that a lot of people would feel</p>
<p>is that we will just be wiped out,</p>
<p>so that there will be potential conflict between AI and humans</p>
<p>and that AI will win because it&rsquo;s a lot smarter.</p>
<p>Boy, would that be a sad state of affairs</p>
<p>if consciousness is just an intermediate stage</p>
<p>between bacteria and AI, right?</p>
<p>Well, I would see bacteria as being potentially</p>
<p>a kind of primitive form of consciousness anyway.</p>
<p>So the whole of life on Earth, to my mind,</p>
<p>is capable of some form of feelings</p>
<p>in response to the environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s intelligent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got its own algorithms for intelligence,</p>
<p>but nothing comparable with us.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s beautiful what a planet, what a sterile planet,</p>
<p>can come up with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s astonishing that it&rsquo;s come up with all of this stuff</p>
<p>that we see around us and that either we or whatever we</p>
<p>produce is capable of destroying all of that is a sad thought.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also hugely pessimistic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that we&rsquo;re capable of giving rise</p>
<p>to something which is at least as good,</p>
<p>if not better than us, as AI.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have that same optimism, especially a thing</p>
<p>that is able to propagate throughout the universe</p>
<p>more efficiently than humans can.</p>
<p>Or extensions of humans, some merger with AI and humans,</p>
<p>whether that comes from bioengineering of the human body</p>
<p>to extend its life somehow, to carry</p>
<p>that flame of consciousness and that personality</p>
<p>and the beautiful tension that&rsquo;s within all of us,</p>
<p>carry that through to multiple planets,</p>
<p>to multiple solar systems, all out there in the universe.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a beautiful vision.</p>
<p>Whether AI can do that or bioengineered humans can,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an exciting possibility.</p>
<p>And especially meeting other alien civilizations</p>
<p>in that same kind of way.</p>
<p>Do you think aliens have consciousness?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re organic.</p>
<p>So organic is connected to consciousness.</p>
<p>I mean, I think any system which is going to bootstrap itself</p>
<p>up from planetary origins, I mean, let me finish this</p>
<p>and then come on to something else.</p>
<p>But from planetary origins is going</p>
<p>to face similar constraints.</p>
<p>And those constraints are going to be addressed</p>
<p>in similar basic engineering ways.</p>
<p>And I think it will be cellular.</p>
<p>And I think it will have electrical charges.</p>
<p>And I think it will have to be selected</p>
<p>in populations over time.</p>
<p>And all of these things will tend</p>
<p>to give rise to the same processes</p>
<p>as the simplest fix to a difficult problem.</p>
<p>So I would expect it to be conscious, yes.</p>
<p>And I would expect it to resemble life</p>
<p>on Earth in many ways.</p>
<p>When I was about, I guess, 15 or 16,</p>
<p>I remember reading a book by Fred Hoyle</p>
<p>called The Black Cloud, which I was a budding biologist</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>And this was the first time I&rsquo;d come across someone really</p>
<p>challenging the heart of biology and saying,</p>
<p>you are far too parochial.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking about life as carbon based.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a life form which is kind of dust, interstellar dust</p>
<p>on a solar system scale.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a novel.</p>
<p>But I felt enormously challenged by that novel</p>
<p>because it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me how limited my thinking was,</p>
<p>how narrow minded I was being.</p>
<p>And here was a great physicist with a completely different</p>
<p>conception of what life could be.</p>
<p>And since then, I&rsquo;ve seen him attacked in various ways.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m kind of reluctant to say the attacks make more sense</p>
<p>to me than the original story, which</p>
<p>is to say, even in terms of information processing,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on that scale and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a limit to the speed of light, how quickly can something</p>
<p>think if you&rsquo;re needing to broadcast</p>
<p>across the solar system, it&rsquo;s going to be slow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to hold a conversation with you</p>
<p>on the kind of timelines that Fred Hoyle was imagining,</p>
<p>at least not by any easy way of doing it,</p>
<p>assuming that the speed of light is a limit.</p>
<p>And then again, you really can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This is something Richard Dawkins argued long ago.</p>
<p>And I do think he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There is no other way to generate</p>
<p>this level of complexity than natural selection.</p>
<p>Nothing else can do it.</p>
<p>You need populations.</p>
<p>And you need selection in populations</p>
<p>and a kind of an isolated interstellar cloud.</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s unlimited time.</p>
<p>And maybe there&rsquo;s no problems with distance.</p>
<p>But you need to have a certain frequency of generational time</p>
<p>to generate a serious level of complexity.</p>
<p>And I just have a feeling it&rsquo;s never going to work.</p>
<p>Well, as far as we know, so natural selection and evolution</p>
<p>is really a powerful tool here on Earth.</p>
<p>But there could be other mechanisms.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with cellular automata,</p>
<p>but complex systems that have really simple components</p>
<p>and seemingly move based on simple rules</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re taken as a whole, really interesting complexity</p>
<p>emerges.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the pressures on that are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really selection, but interesting complexity</p>
<p>seems to emerge.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not well understood exactly why that complexity</p>
<p>emerges.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a difference between complexity</p>
<p>and evolution.</p>
<p>So some of the work we&rsquo;re doing on the origin of life</p>
<p>is thinking about how do genes arise?</p>
<p>How does information arise in biology?</p>
<p>And thinking about it from the point of view</p>
<p>of reacting CO2 with hydrogen, what do you get?</p>
<p>Well, what you&rsquo;re going to get is carboxylic acids, then</p>
<p>amino acids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite hard to make nucleotides.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible to make them, and it&rsquo;s been done,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been done following this pathway as well.</p>
<p>But you make trace amounts.</p>
<p>And so the next question, assuming</p>
<p>that this is the right way of seeing the question, which</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s just not, but let&rsquo;s assume it is,</p>
<p>is, well, how do you reliably make more nucleotides?</p>
<p>And how do you become more complex and better at becoming</p>
<p>a nucleotide generating machine?</p>
<p>And the answer is, well, you need positive feedback loops,</p>
<p>some form of autocatalysis.</p>
<p>So that can work, and we know it happens in biology.</p>
<p>If this nucleotide, for example, catalyzes CO2 fixation,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to increase the rate of flux</p>
<p>through the whole system, and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to effectively steepen the driving force</p>
<p>to make more nucleotides.</p>
<p>And this can be inherited because there</p>
<p>are forms of membrane heredity that you can have.</p>
<p>And effectively, if a cell divides in two</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got a lot of stuff inside it,</p>
<p>and that stuff is basically bound</p>
<p>as a network which is capable of regenerating itself,</p>
<p>then it will inevitably regenerate itself.</p>
<p>And so you can develop greater complexity.</p>
<p>But everything that I&rsquo;ve said depends on the underlying rules</p>
<p>of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>There is no evolvability about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply an inevitable outcome of your starting point,</p>
<p>assuming that you&rsquo;re able to increase the driving</p>
<p>force through the system.</p>
<p>You will generate more of the same.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll expand on what you can do,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll never get anything different than that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only when you introduce information into that</p>
<p>as a gene, as a kind of small stretch of RNA, which</p>
<p>can be random stretch, then you get real evolvability.</p>
<p>Then you get biology as we know it.</p>
<p>But you also have selection as we know it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how to think about information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a kind of memory of the system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, yeah, at the local level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s propagation of copying yourself and changing</p>
<p>and improving your adaptability to the environment.</p>
<p>But if you look at Earth as a whole, it has a kind of memory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the key feature of it.</p>
<p>In what way?</p>
<p>It remembers the stuff it tries.</p>
<p>Like, if you were to describe Earth,</p>
<p>I think evolution is something that we experience</p>
<p>as individual organisms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the individual organisms</p>
<p>interact with each other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a natural selection.</p>
<p>But when you look at Earth as an organism in its entirety,</p>
<p>how would you describe it?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Well, not as an organism.</p>
<p>I mean, the idea of Gaia is lovely.</p>
<p>And James Lovelock originally put Gaia out</p>
<p>as an organism that had somehow evolved.</p>
<p>And he was immediately attacked by lots of people.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not wrong, but he backpedaled somewhat</p>
<p>because that was more of a poetic vision than the science.</p>
<p>The science is now called Earth systems science.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really about how does the world regulate itself</p>
<p>so it remains within the limits which are hospitable to life.</p>
<p>And it does it amazingly well.</p>
<p>And it is working at a planetary level of integration,</p>
<p>of regulation.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not evolving by natural selection.</p>
<p>And it can&rsquo;t because there&rsquo;s only one of it.</p>
<p>And so it can change over time.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not evolving.</p>
<p>All the evolution is happening in the parts of the system.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s a self sustaining organism.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s sustained by the sun.</p>
<p>Right, so you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to see Earth</p>
<p>as its own organism?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s poetic and beautiful.</p>
<p>And I often refer to the Earth as a living planet.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, in biological terms, an organism, no.</p>
<p>If aliens were to visit Earth, what would they notice?</p>
<p>What would be the basic unit of light they would notice?</p>
<p>Trees, probably.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s green.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s green and blue.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the first thing you&rsquo;d notice.</p>
<p>It stands out from space as being different to any</p>
<p>of the other planets.</p>
<p>So it would notice the trees at first because the green.</p>
<p>Well, I would.</p>
<p>I notice the green, yes.</p>
<p>And then probably notice, figure out the photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Probably notice cities a second, I suspect, maybe first.</p>
<p>If they arrived at night, they&rsquo;d notice cities first,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>Depends the time.</p>
<p>You write quite beautifully in Transformers.</p>
<p>Once again, I think you opened the book in this way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>From space, describing Earth, it&rsquo;s such an interesting idea</p>
<p>of what Earth is, you also, I mean, Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide,</p>
<p>summarizing it as harmless, or mostly harmless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautifully poetic thing.</p>
<p>You open Transformers with, from space,</p>
<p>it looks gray and crystalline, obliterating</p>
<p>the blue green colors of the living Earth.</p>
<p>It is crisscrossed by irregular patterns</p>
<p>and convergent striations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a central amorphous density</p>
<p>where these scratches seem lighter.</p>
<p>This, quote, growth does not look alive,</p>
<p>although it has extended out along some lines,</p>
<p>and there is something grasping and parasitic about it.</p>
<p>Across the globe, there are thousands of them,</p>
<p>varying in shape and detail, but all of them gray, angular,</p>
<p>and organic, spreading.</p>
<p>Yet at night, they light up, glowing up the dark sky,</p>
<p>suddenly beautiful.</p>
<p>Perhaps these cankers on the landscape</p>
<p>are in some sense living.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a controlled flow of energy.</p>
<p>There must be information and some form of metabolism,</p>
<p>some turnover of materials.</p>
<p>Are they alive?</p>
<p>No, of course not.</p>
<p>They are cities.</p>
<p>So is there some sense that cities are living beings?</p>
<p>You think aliens would think of them as living beings?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;d be easy to see it that way, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It wakes up at night, they wake up at night.</p>
<p>Strictly nocturnal, yes.</p>
<p>I imagine that any aliens that are smart enough</p>
<p>to get here would understand</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not living beings.</p>
<p>My reason for saying that is that we tend to think</p>
<p>of biology in terms of information and forget about cells.</p>
<p>I was trying to draw a comparison between the cell</p>
<p>as a city and the energy flow through the city</p>
<p>and the energy flow through cells</p>
<p>and the turnover of materials.</p>
<p>And an interesting thing about cities</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re not really exactly governed by anybody.</p>
<p>There are regulations and systems and whatever else,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty loose.</p>
<p>They have their own life,</p>
<p>their own way of developing over time.</p>
<p>And in that sense, they&rsquo;re quite biological.</p>
<p>There was a plan after the great fire of London.</p>
<p>Christopher Wren was making plans</p>
<p>not only for St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral,</p>
<p>but also to rebuild in large Parisian type boulevards,</p>
<p>a large part of the area of central London that was burned.</p>
<p>And it never happened</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t have enough money, I think.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting what was in the plan.</p>
<p>There were all these boulevards</p>
<p>that were built in the middle of the city.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting what was in the plan.</p>
<p>There were all these boulevards,</p>
<p>but there were no pubs and no coffee houses</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>And the reality was London just kind of grew up</p>
<p>in a set of jumbled streets.</p>
<p>And it was the coffee houses and the pubs</p>
<p>where all the business of the city of London was being done.</p>
<p>And that was where the real life of the city was.</p>
<p>And no one had planned it.</p>
<p>The whole thing was unplanned and works much better that way.</p>
<p>And in that sense, the cell is completely unplanned,</p>
<p>is not controlled by the genes in the nucleus</p>
<p>in the way that we might like to think that it is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of evolved entity</p>
<p>that has the same kind of flux,</p>
<p>the same animation, the same life.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful analogy,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t get too stuck with it as a metaphor.</p>
<p>See, I disagree with you.</p>
<p>I disagree with you.</p>
<p>I think you are so steeped,</p>
<p>and actually the entirety of science,</p>
<p>the history of science is steeped</p>
<p>in a biological framework of thinking about what is life.</p>
<p>And not just biological, it&rsquo;s very human centric too.</p>
<p>That human, the human organism is the epitome of life</p>
<p>on earth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think there is some deep fundamental way</p>
<p>in which a city is a living being</p>
<p>in the same way that a human individual can.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t give rise to an offspring city.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t work by natural selection.</p>
<p>It works by, if anything, memes.</p>
<p>It works by copying itself conceptually</p>
<p>as a mode of being.</p>
<p>So maybe memes, maybe ideas are the organisms</p>
<p>that are really essential to life on earth.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s much more important</p>
<p>about the collective aspect of human nature,</p>
<p>the collective intelligence</p>
<p>than the individual intelligence.</p>
<p>Maybe the collective humanity is the organism.</p>
<p>And the thing that defines the collective intelligence</p>
<p>of humanity is the ideas.</p>
<p>And maybe the way that manifests itself is cities,</p>
<p>maybe, or societies or geographically concentrated societies</p>
<p>or nations and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, from an alien perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that that is the more deeply noticeable thing,</p>
<p>not from a place of ignorance.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s noticeable doesn&rsquo;t tell you how it works.</p>
<p>I think, I mean, I don&rsquo;t have any problem</p>
<p>with what you&rsquo;re saying really,</p>
<p>except that it&rsquo;s not possible without the humans.</p>
<p>You know, we went from a hunter gatherers type economy,</p>
<p>if you like, without cities to cities.</p>
<p>And as soon as we get into human evolution</p>
<p>and culture and society and so on,</p>
<p>then yes, there are other forms of evolution,</p>
<p>other forms of change.</p>
<p>But cities don&rsquo;t directly propagate themselves,</p>
<p>they propagate themselves through human societies</p>
<p>and human societies only exist because humans</p>
<p>as individuals propagate themselves.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of, there is a hierarchy there</p>
<p>and without the humans in the first place,</p>
<p>none of the rest of it exists.</p>
<p>So do you, life is primarily defined by the basic unit</p>
<p>on which evolution can operate?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really important thing, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know, we don&rsquo;t have any other better ideas</p>
<p>than evolution for how to create life.</p>
<p>I never came across a better idea than evolution.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe I&rsquo;m just ignorant and I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you know, you mentioned that&rsquo;s no automator</p>
<p>and so on, and I don&rsquo;t think specifically about that,</p>
<p>but I have thought about it in terms of selective units</p>
<p>of the origin of life and the difference</p>
<p>between evolvability and complexity</p>
<p>or just increasing complexity,</p>
<p>but within very narrow, narrowly defined limits.</p>
<p>The great thing about genes and about selection</p>
<p>is it just knocks down all those limits.</p>
<p>It gives you a world of information in the end</p>
<p>which is limited only by the biophysical reality</p>
<p>of what kind of an organism you are,</p>
<p>what kind of a planet you live on and so on.</p>
<p>And cities and all these other forms that look alive</p>
<p>and could be described as alive</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t propagate themselves</p>
<p>can only exist as the product of something</p>
<p>that did propagate itself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a deeply compelling truth</p>
<p>to that kind of way of looking at things,</p>
<p>but I just hope that we don&rsquo;t miss the giant cloud</p>
<p>among us.</p>
<p>I kind of hope that I&rsquo;m wrong about a lot of this</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t say that my worldview</p>
<p>is particularly uplifting, but in some sense,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s uplifting or not.</p>
<p>Science is about what&rsquo;s reality, what&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>why is it this way?</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s beauty in that too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s beauty in darkness.</p>
<p>You write about life and death</p>
<p>sort of at the biological level.</p>
<p>Does the question of suicide, why live,</p>
<p>does the question of why the human mind</p>
<p>is capable of depression, are you able to introspect</p>
<p>that from a place of biology?</p>
<p>Why our minds, why we humans can go to such dark places?</p>
<p>Why can we commit suicide?</p>
<p>Why can we go suffer, suffer period,</p>
<p>but also suffer from a feeling of meaninglessness</p>
<p>of going to a dark place that depression can take you?</p>
<p>Is this a feature of life or is it a bug?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, if it&rsquo;s a feature of life,</p>
<p>then I suppose it would have to be true</p>
<p>of other organisms as well.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, we were talking about dogs earlier on</p>
<p>and they can certainly be very sad and upset</p>
<p>and may mooch for days after their owner died</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So I suspect in some sense it&rsquo;s a feature of biology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a feature of mortality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a, but beyond all of that,</p>
<p>I mean, I guess there&rsquo;s two ways you could come at it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one of them would be to say,</p>
<p>well, you can effectively do the math</p>
<p>and come to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s all pointless</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s really no point</p>
<p>in me being here any longer.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s true in the greater scheme of things.</p>
<p>You can justify yourself in terms of society,</p>
<p>but society will be gone soon enough as well.</p>
<p>And you end up with a very bleak place just by logic.</p>
<p>In some sense, it&rsquo;s surprising</p>
<p>that we can find any meaning at all.</p>
<p>Well, maybe this is where consciousness comes in</p>
<p>that we have transient joy, but with transient joy,</p>
<p>we have transient misery as well.</p>
<p>And sometimes with everything in biology,</p>
<p>getting the regulation right is practically impossible.</p>
<p>You will always have a bell shaped curve</p>
<p>where some people unfortunately are at the joy end</p>
<p>and some people are at the misery end.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way brains are wired.</p>
<p>And I doubt there&rsquo;s ever an escape from that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with sex and everything else as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re dealing with, you can&rsquo;t regulate it.</p>
<p>So anything goes, it&rsquo;s all part of biology.</p>
<p>Amen to that.</p>
<p>Let me, on writing in your book, Power, Sex and Suicide.</p>
<p>First of all, can I just read off the books you&rsquo;ve written?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s any better titles and topics to be covered,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they are.</p>
<p>It makes me look forward</p>
<p>to whatever you&rsquo;re going to write next.</p>
<p>I hope there&rsquo;s things you write next.</p>
<p>So first you wrote oxygen, the molecule that made the world</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve talked about this idea</p>
<p>of the role of oxygen in life on earth.</p>
<p>Then wait for it, power, sex, suicide, mitochondria</p>
<p>and the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Then life ascending, the 10 great inventions of evolution.</p>
<p>The vital question, the first book I&rsquo;ve read of yours,</p>
<p>the vital question, why is life the way it is?</p>
<p>And the new book, Transformer,</p>
<p>the deep chemistry of life and death.</p>
<p>In Power, Sex and Suicide, you write about writing</p>
<p>or about a lot of things,</p>
<p>but I have a question about writing.</p>
<p>You write, in The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy,</p>
<p>Ford Perfect spends 15 years researching his revision</p>
<p>to the guide&rsquo;s entry on the earth,</p>
<p>which originally read harmless.</p>
<p>By the way, I would also as a side quest,</p>
<p>as a side question would like to ask you</p>
<p>what would be your summary of what earth is.</p>
<p>You write, his long essay on the subject is edited down</p>
<p>by the guide to read mostly harmless.</p>
<p>I suspect that too many new editions suffer similar fate,</p>
<p>if not through absurd editing decisions,</p>
<p>at least through a lack of meaningful change in content.</p>
<p>As it happens, nearly 15 years have passed</p>
<p>since the first edition of Power, Sex, Suicide was published</p>
<p>and I am resisting the temptation to make any lame revisions.</p>
<p>Some say that even Darwin lessened the power</p>
<p>of his arguments in The Origin of Species</p>
<p>through his multiple revisions,</p>
<p>in which he dealt with criticisms</p>
<p>and sometimes shifted his views in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>I prefer my original to speak for itself,</p>
<p>even if it turns out to be wrong.</p>
<p>Let me ask the question about writing,</p>
<p>both your students in the academic setting,</p>
<p>but also writing some of the most brilliant writings</p>
<p>on science and humanity I&rsquo;ve ever read.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the process of writing?</p>
<p>How do you advise other humans?</p>
<p>If you were to talk to young Darwin or the young you</p>
<p>and just young anybody and give advice about how to write</p>
<p>and how to write well about these big topics,</p>
<p>what would you say?</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose there&rsquo;s a couple of points.</p>
<p>One of them is what&rsquo;s the story?</p>
<p>What do I want to know?</p>
<p>What do I want to convey?</p>
<p>Why does it matter to anybody?</p>
<p>And very often the biggest, most interesting questions,</p>
<p>the childlike questions are the one actually</p>
<p>that everybody wants to ask, but dents quite,</p>
<p>do it in case they look stupid.</p>
<p>And one of the nice things about being in science</p>
<p>is the longer you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>the more you realize that everybody doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the answer to these questions</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not so stupid to ask them after all.</p>
<p>So trying to ask the questions</p>
<p>that I would have been asking myself at the age of 15, 16,</p>
<p>when I was really hungry to know about the world</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t know very much about it</p>
<p>and wanted to go to the edge of what we know,</p>
<p>but be helped to get there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be too much terminology.</p>
<p>And so I want someone to keep a clean eye</p>
<p>on what the question is.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I&rsquo;ve wondered a lot about who am I writing for?</p>
<p>And that was in the end, the only answer I had</p>
<p>was myself at the age of 15 or 16,</p>
<p>because even if you just don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s reading,</p>
<p>but also where are they reading it?</p>
<p>Are they reading it in the bath or in bed</p>
<p>or on the Metro or listening to an audio book?</p>
<p>Do you want to have a recapitulation every few pages</p>
<p>because you read three pages at a time</p>
<p>or are you really irritated by that?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get criticism from people</p>
<p>who are irritated by what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t know who they are or what you&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to irritate people.</p>
<p>And in the end, all you can do is just try</p>
<p>and please yourself.</p>
<p>And that means, well, what are these big fun,</p>
<p>fascinating and big questions?</p>
<p>And what do we know about it?</p>
<p>And can I convey that?</p>
<p>And I kind of learned in trying to write,</p>
<p>first of all, say what we know.</p>
<p>And I was shocked in the first couple of books</p>
<p>how often I came up quickly against</p>
<p>all the stuff we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re trying to, I&rsquo;ve realized later on</p>
<p>in supervising various physicists and mathematicians</p>
<p>who are PhD students, their maths is way beyond</p>
<p>what I can do.</p>
<p>But the process of trying to work out</p>
<p>what are we actually going to model here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going into this equation?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very similar one to writing.</p>
<p>What am I going to put on a page?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the simplest possible way</p>
<p>I can encapsulate this idea?</p>
<p>So that I now have it as a unit</p>
<p>that I can kind of see how it interacts</p>
<p>with the other units.</p>
<p>And you realize that, well, if this is like that</p>
<p>and this is like this, then that can&rsquo;t be true.</p>
<p>So you end up navigating your own path</p>
<p>through this landscape.</p>
<p>And that can be thrilling</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to think that that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>my books have worked for people</p>
<p>because this sense of the thrilling adventure ride</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s going either.</p>
<p>So finding the simplest possible way</p>
<p>to explain the things we know</p>
<p>and the simplest possible way to explain</p>
<p>the things we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and the tension between those two.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the story emerges.</p>
<p>What about the edit?</p>
<p>Do you find yourself to the point of this,</p>
<p>you know, editing down to mostly harmless?</p>
<p>To arrive at simplicity, do you find the edit is productive</p>
<p>or does it destroy the magic that was originally there?</p>
<p>No, I usually find, I think I&rsquo;m perhaps a better editor</p>
<p>than I am a writer.</p>
<p>I write and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite.</p>
<p>Put a bunch of crap on the page first</p>
<p>and then see the edit where it takes you.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then there&rsquo;s the professional editors</p>
<p>who come along as well.</p>
<p>And I mean, in Transformer, the editor came back to me</p>
<p>after I&rsquo;d sent him, two months after I sent</p>
<p>the first edition, he&rsquo;d read the whole thing</p>
<p>and he said, the first two chapters prevent</p>
<p>a formidable hurdle to the general reader.</p>
<p>Go and do something about it.</p>
<p>And that was the last thing I really wanted to do.</p>
<p>Your editor sounds very eloquent in speech.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, this was an email,</p>
<p>but I thought about it, you know,</p>
<p>the bottom line is he was right.</p>
<p>And so I put the whole thing aside for about two months,</p>
<p>spent the summer, this would have been,</p>
<p>I guess last summer, and then turned to it</p>
<p>with full attention in about September or something</p>
<p>and rewrote those chapters almost from scratch.</p>
<p>I kept some of the material,</p>
<p>but it took me a long time to process it,</p>
<p>to work out what needs to change, where does it need to,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t writing in this time.</p>
<p>How am I going to tell this story better</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s more accessible and interesting?</p>
<p>And in the end, I think it worked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still biochemistry, but it has,</p>
<p>he ended up saying, now he&rsquo;s got a barreling energy to it.</p>
<p>And I was, you know, because he&rsquo;d been,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;d told me the truth the first time,</p>
<p>I decided to believe that he was telling me the truth</p>
<p>the second time as well and was delighted.</p>
<p>Could you give advice to young people in general,</p>
<p>folks in high school, folks in college,</p>
<p>how to take on some of the big questions you&rsquo;ve taken on?</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve done that in the space of biology</p>
<p>and expanded out.</p>
<p>How can they have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Gosh, that&rsquo;s a big question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve gathered some wisdom</p>
<p>that you can impart.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the only advice that I actually ever give</p>
<p>to my students is follow what you&rsquo;re interested in</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re often worried</p>
<p>that if they make this decision now</p>
<p>and do this course instead of that course,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re going to restrict their career opportunities</p>
<p>and there isn&rsquo;t a career path in science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, I mean, there is, but there isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of competition,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of death symbolically.</p>
<p>So who survives?</p>
<p>The people who survive are the people</p>
<p>who care enough to still do it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very often the people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t worry too much about the future</p>
<p>and are able to live in the present.</p>
<p>Because if you do a PhD,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve competed hard to get onto the PhD,</p>
<p>then you have to compete hard to get a postdoc job</p>
<p>and you have the next one maybe on another continent</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s only two years anyway.</p>
<p>And so, and there&rsquo;s no guarantee</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get a faculty position at the end of it.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always the next step to compete.</p>
<p>If you get a faculty position,</p>
<p>you get a tenure and with tenure go full professor</p>
<p>and full professor, then you go to some kind of,</p>
<p>whatever the discipline is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an award.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in physics,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always competing for the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different awards.</p>
<p>And then eventually you&rsquo;re all competing to,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s always a competition.</p>
<p>So there is no happiness.</p>
<p>Happiness does not lie.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking into the future, yes.</p>
<p>And if what you&rsquo;re caring about is a career,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s probably not the one for you.</p>
<p>If though you can put that aside,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve also worked in industry for a brief period</p>
<p>and I was made redundant twice.</p>
<p>So I know that.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s no guarantee</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got a career that way either.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, so live in the moment</p>
<p>and try and enjoy what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And that means really go to the,</p>
<p>go to the themes that you&rsquo;re most interested in</p>
<p>and try and follow them as well as you can.</p>
<p>And that tends to pay back in surprising ways.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve found this as well,</p>
<p>but I found that people will help you often.</p>
<p>If they see some light shining in the eye,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re excited about their subject</p>
<p>and you know, just want to talk about it.</p>
<p>And they know that their friend in California</p>
<p>has got a job coming up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, go for this, this guy&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;ll use the network to help you out</p>
<p>if you really care.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not gonna have a job two years down the line,</p>
<p>but if what you really care about is what you&rsquo;re doing now,</p>
<p>then it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have a job</p>
<p>in two years time or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll work itself out if you&rsquo;ve got the light in your eye.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the only advice I can give.</p>
<p>And most people probably drop out through that system</p>
<p>because the fight is just not worth it for them.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you have the light in your eye,</p>
<p>when you have the excitement for the thing,</p>
<p>what happens is you start to surround yourself with others</p>
<p>that are interested in that same thing,</p>
<p>that also have the light.</p>
<p>If you really are rigorous about this</p>
<p>because I think it does take, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it takes effort to make.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;ve got to be obsessive.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re doing what you really love doing,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s not work anymore, it&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I also mean the surrounding yourself</p>
<p>with other people that are obsessed about the same thing</p>
<p>because depending on.</p>
<p>Oh, that takes some work as well, yes.</p>
<p>And luck.</p>
<p>Finding the right, yeah, finding the right mentors,</p>
<p>the collaborators, because I think one of the problem</p>
<p>with the PhD process is people are not careful enough</p>
<p>in picking their mentors.</p>
<p>Those are people, mentors and colleagues and so on,</p>
<p>those are people who are gonna define</p>
<p>the direction of your life, how much you love a thing,</p>
<p>how much, I mean the power of just like</p>
<p>the few little conversations you have in the hallway,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So you have to be a little bit careful in that.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just get randomly almost assigned,</p>
<p>really pursue, I suppose, the subject</p>
<p>as much as you pursue the people that do that subject.</p>
<p>So like both, the whole dance of it.</p>
<p>They kind of go together really.</p>
<p>Yeah, they really do.</p>
<p>But take that part seriously.</p>
<p>And probably in the way you&rsquo;re describing it,</p>
<p>careful how you define success.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never find happiness in success.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lovely quote from Robert Louis Stevenson,</p>
<p>I think, who said, nothing in life</p>
<p>is so disenchanting as attainment.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, in some sense,</p>
<p>the true definition of success is getting to do today</p>
<p>what you really enjoy doing.</p>
<p>Just what fills you with joy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s ultimately success.</p>
<p>So success isn&rsquo;t the thing beyond the horizon,</p>
<p>the big trophy, the financials.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s as close as we can get to happiness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say you&rsquo;re full of joy all the time,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s as close as we can get</p>
<p>to a sustained human happiness</p>
<p>is by getting some fulfillment</p>
<p>from what you&rsquo;re doing on a daily basis.</p>
<p>And if what you&rsquo;re looking for is the world</p>
<p>giving you the stamp of approval with a Nobel Prize</p>
<p>or a fellowship or whatever it is,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ve known people like this who,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eaten away by the anger,</p>
<p>the kind of caustic resentment</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve not been awarded this prize that they deserve.</p>
<p>And the other way, if you put too much value</p>
<p>into those kinds of prizes and you win them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to see that it also,</p>
<p>the more quote unquote successful you are in that sense,</p>
<p>the more you run the danger of growing ego</p>
<p>so big that you don&rsquo;t get to actually enjoy</p>
<p>the beauty of this life.</p>
<p>You start to believe that you figured it all out</p>
<p>as opposed to, I think what ultimately</p>
<p>the most fun thing is is being curious</p>
<p>about everything around you, being constantly surprised,</p>
<p>and these little moments of discovery</p>
<p>of enjoying beauty in small and big ways all around you.</p>
<p>And I think the bigger your ego grows,</p>
<p>the more you start to take yourself seriously,</p>
<p>the less you&rsquo;re able to enjoy that.</p>
<p>Amen to that, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
<p>So the summary from harmless to mostly harmless</p>
<p>in Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy,</p>
<p>how would you try to summarize Earth?</p>
<p>And if you were given,</p>
<p>if you had to summarize the whole thing</p>
<p>in a couple of sentences,</p>
<p>and maybe throw in meaning of life in there,</p>
<p>like what, why, why, why, maybe,</p>
<p>is that a defining thing about humans</p>
<p>that we care about the meaning of the whole thing?</p>
<p>I wonder if that should be part of the,</p>
<p>these creatures seem to be very lost.</p>
<p>Yes, they&rsquo;re always asking why.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s my defining question is why.</p>
<p>It was, as people used to make a joke,</p>
<p>I have a small scar on my forehead</p>
<p>from a climbing accident years ago.</p>
<p>And the guy I was climbing with had dislodged a rock</p>
<p>and he shouted something.</p>
<p>He shouted below, I think,</p>
<p>meaning that the rock was coming down.</p>
<p>And I hadn&rsquo;t caught what he said,</p>
<p>so I looked up and then smashed the street on my forehead.</p>
<p>And everybody around me took the piss,</p>
<p>saying he looked up to ask why.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a human imperative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>Look up to the sky and ask why, and ask why.</p>
<p>So your question, define the earth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I can do that.</p>
<p>I mean, the first word that comes to mind is living.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t like to say mostly living, but perhaps.</p>
<p>Mostly living.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting because like,</p>
<p>if you were to write the Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy,</p>
<p>I suppose, say our idea that we talked about,</p>
<p>that bacteria is the most prominent form of life</p>
<p>throughout the galaxy and the universe.</p>
<p>I suppose that earth would be kind of unique</p>
<p>and would require.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s abundance in that case.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s profligate, it&rsquo;s rich, it&rsquo;s enormously,</p>
<p>enormously living.</p>
<p>So how would you describe that it&rsquo;s not bacteria?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Eukaryotic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, that&rsquo;s the technical term,</p>
<p>but it is basically it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then.</p>
<p>How would I describe that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually really struggled with that term</p>
<p>because the word, I mean, there&rsquo;s few words</p>
<p>quite as good as eukaryotic to put everybody off immediately.</p>
<p>You start using words like that</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll leave the room.</p>
<p>A Krebs cycle is another one that gets people</p>
<p>to leave the room, but so I&rsquo;ve tried to think,</p>
<p>is there another word for eukaryotic that I can use?</p>
<p>And really the only word that I&rsquo;ve been able to use</p>
<p>is complex, complex cells, complex life and so on.</p>
<p>And that word, it serves one immediate purpose,</p>
<p>which is to convey an impression.</p>
<p>But then it means so many different things to everybody</p>
<p>that actually is lost immediately.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a noticeable from the perspective</p>
<p>of other planets, that is a noticeable phase transition</p>
<p>of complexity is the eukaryotic.</p>
<p>What about the harmless and the mostly harmless?</p>
<p>Is that kind of.</p>
<p>Probably accurate on a universal kind of scale.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that humanity is in any danger</p>
<p>of disturbing the universe at the moment.</p>
<p>At the moment, which is why the mostly, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Depends what Elon is up to, depends how many rockets.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be still even then a while, I think,</p>
<p>before we disturb the fabric of time and space.</p>
<p>Was the aforementioned Andrej Karpathy,</p>
<p>I think he summarized Earth as a system</p>
<p>where you hammer it with a bunch of photons.</p>
<p>The input is like photons and the output is rockets.</p>
<p>If you just.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a hell of a lot of photons</p>
<p>before there was a rocket launch.</p>
<p>But like, you know, maybe in the span of the universe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that much time.</p>
<p>And so, and I do wonder, you know, what the future is,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re just in the early beginnings of this Earth,</p>
<p>which is important when you try to summarize it,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re at the end, where humans have finally</p>
<p>gained the ability to destroy the entirety</p>
<p>of this beautiful project we&rsquo;ve got going on.</p>
<p>Not with nuclear weapons, with engineered viruses,</p>
<p>with all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Or just inadvertently through global warming</p>
<p>and pollution and so on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re quite capable of that.</p>
<p>I mean, we just need to pass the tipping point.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re more likely to do it inadvertently</p>
<p>than through a nuclear war, which could happen at any time.</p>
<p>But my fear is we just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where the tipping points are.</p>
<p>And we will, we kind of think we&rsquo;re smart enough</p>
<p>to fix the problem quickly if we really need to.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the overriding assumption</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all right for now.</p>
<p>Maybe in 20 years time, it&rsquo;s gonna be a calamitous problem.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll really need to put some serious mental power</p>
<p>into fixing it without seriously worrying</p>
<p>that perhaps that is too late.</p>
<p>And that however brilliant we are, we miss the boat.</p>
<p>And just walk off the cliff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I have optimism in humans being clever descendants.</p>
<p>Oh, I have no doubt that we can fix the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an urgent problem.</p>
<p>We need to fix it pretty sharpish.</p>
<p>And I do have doubts about whether politically</p>
<p>we are capable of coming together enough</p>
<p>to not just in any one country, but around the planet.</p>
<p>To, I mean, I know we can do it, but do we have the will?</p>
<p>Do we have the vision to accomplish it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes this whole ride fun.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Not only do we not know if we can handle</p>
<p>the crises before us, we don&rsquo;t even know all the crises</p>
<p>that are gonna be before us in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>The ones I think that will most likely challenge us</p>
<p>in the 21st century are the ones we don&rsquo;t even expect.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t expect World War II</p>
<p>at the end of World War I.</p>
<p>Some folks did, but yeah, not at the end of World War I.</p>
<p>But by the late 1920s, I think people</p>
<p>were beginning to worry about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, there&rsquo;s always people worrying about everything.</p>
<p>So if you focus on the thing that.</p>
<p>People worry about, yes.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a million things people worry about</p>
<p>and 99.999999% of them don&rsquo;t come to be.</p>
<p>Of course, the people that turn out to be right,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say, I knew all along, but that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not an accurate way of knowing</p>
<p>what you could have predicted.</p>
<p>I think rationally speaking, you can worry about it,</p>
<p>but nobody thought you could have another World War.</p>
<p>The war to end all wars, why would you have another war?</p>
<p>And the idea of nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>just technologically, is a very difficult thing</p>
<p>to anticipate, to create a weapon</p>
<p>that just jumps orders of magnitude</p>
<p>and destructive capability.</p>
<p>And of course, we can intuit all the things</p>
<p>like engineered viruses, nanobots,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence, yes, all the different</p>
<p>complicated global effects of global warming.</p>
<p>So how that changes the allocation of resources,</p>
<p>the flow of energy, the tension between countries,</p>
<p>the military conflict between countries,</p>
<p>the reallocation of power,</p>
<p>then looking at the role of China in this whole thing</p>
<p>with Russia and growing influence of Africa</p>
<p>and the weird dynamics of Europe,</p>
<p>and then America falling apart through the political</p>
<p>division fueled by recommender systems</p>
<p>through Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>The whole beautiful mess is just fun.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of incredible engineers,</p>
<p>incredible scientists, incredible human beings</p>
<p>that while everyone is bickering and so on online</p>
<p>for the fun of it on the weekends,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually trying to build solutions.</p>
<p>And those are the people that will create</p>
<p>something beautiful.</p>
<p>At least I have, that&rsquo;s the process of evolution.</p>
<p>It all started with a Chuck Norris single cell organism</p>
<p>that went out from the vents and was the parent</p>
<p>to all of us.</p>
<p>And for that guy or lady or both, I guess,</p>
<p>is a big thank you and I can&rsquo;t wait to what happens next.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s incredible humans writing</p>
<p>and studying it like you are, Nick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would talk to me.</p>
<p>This is fantastic.</p>
<p>This is really amazing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to read what you write next.</p>
<p>Thank you for existing.</p>
<p>And thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Nick Lane.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>I think the biggest innovations of the 21st century</p>
<p>will be at the intersection of biology and technology.</p>
<p>A new era is beginning.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
