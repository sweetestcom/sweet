    <p>The following is a conversation with Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer at the Human</p>
<p>Rights Foundation and the Oslo Freedom Forum.</p>
<p>In recent times, Alex has focused on how cryptocurrency, and especially Bitcoin, can be a tool for</p>
<p>empowering democracy and civil liberties in the world, most crucially, parts of the world</p>
<p>that are living under authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I have been learning a lot about the ways in which money</p>
<p>can be used to amass power, and in the same way, the decentralization of money can be</p>
<p>used to resist the corrupting nature of this power.</p>
<p>Alex and I do not agree on everything, but we strive for the same betterment of humanity.</p>
<p>He is sensitive to the suffering in the world, and is dedicating his life to finding solutions</p>
<p>that lessen that suffering.</p>
<p>Whether Bitcoin is one such solution, I don&rsquo;t know, but I think it has a chance, and that</p>
<p>means it is worth exploring deeply.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m staying in this path of learning, patiently, and with as little ego as possible, I hope</p>
<p>you come along with me on this journey as well.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>We recorded this conversation a while ago, and I thought I lost the audio, and was really</p>
<p>disappointed with myself for messing this thing up, but luckily, last week, I found</p>
<p>it, and so, rescued from out of the abyss of nonexistence, here&rsquo;s my conversation with</p>
<p>Alex Glastain.</p>
<p>What are some universal human rights that you believe all people should have?</p>
<p>So free speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of belief, freedom to participate in your</p>
<p>government, the freedom to have privacy, the freedom to own things, property rights, these</p>
<p>are all basic, fundamental, negative rights, what we call them.</p>
<p>These are the basic, fundamental human freedoms.</p>
<p>What does negative rights mean?</p>
<p>Negative rights are liberties, and positive rights are entitlements.</p>
<p>So after World War II, when the UN came together, it was largely a compromise between the communist</p>
<p>Soviet Union and the, you know, free United States, right?</p>
<p>So the US had, on its side of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, a bunch of liberties, essentially,</p>
<p>things like free speech, freedom of association, freedom of assembly.</p>
<p>The Soviets wanted entitlements, like the right to work, the right to have housing,</p>
<p>the right to water, the right to a vacation.</p>
<p>So if you actually read the UN Declaration for Human Rights, it&rsquo;s a negotiation between</p>
<p>the Soviets and the Americans.</p>
<p>Later, there was another document in the 70s released called the International Covenant</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
<p>And this is what HRF uses as its sort of like lodestar, its founding document.</p>
<p>And this is like, essentially, an international agreement on the negative rights.</p>
<p>Those are the things we choose to focus on, because essentially, authoritarian regimes</p>
<p>can commit fraud and claim they&rsquo;re giving the positive rights, the entitlements, without</p>
<p>having any of the negative liberties.</p>
<p>And they can do that because they don&rsquo;t have any like free speech or press freedom.</p>
<p>When you take people&rsquo;s basic fundamental freedoms away, it&rsquo;s quite easy to make like a Potemkin</p>
<p>village and pretend that there&rsquo;s the entitlements and that we have good health care and, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s the same sort of thing that authoritarians have done for decades, Cuba and Venezuela</p>
<p>and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Peter Bell.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible for authoritarian regimes to manipulate, to kind of lie about</p>
<p>the negative rights as well, by saying that the people have free speech, the people have</p>
<p>the freedom for assembly and all those kinds of things, can&rsquo;t you still manipulate the</p>
<p>idea that citizenry still has those rights?</p>
<p>The opposition leader of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim, he once told me the funny joke that, you know,</p>
<p>in my country, we have freedom of speech, we don&rsquo;t have freedom after speech.</p>
<p>So yeah, they can absolutely manipulate whatever they want.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve done research into socioeconomic data.</p>
<p>And I guess what I&rsquo;m telling you is that authoritarian regimes, which make up 53% of the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>population across 95 countries, about 4.3 billion people, those who live under those</p>
<p>regimes are subject to massive fraud when it comes to things like literacy rates, life</p>
<p>expectancy, any sort of socioeconomic data, economic growth.</p>
<p>They can do this because there&rsquo;s no free press.</p>
<p>So for us at the Human Rights Foundation, and for people like me, we believe that the</p>
<p>negative rights, the liberties, the things that are in, for example, the Bill of Rights</p>
<p>in the US Constitution, these things are the table and then we can build on top of that.</p>
<p>We can build the rest of our societies on top of that.</p>
<p>The freest countries in the world have both the negative liberties and the entitlements</p>
<p>like Norway, for example, but there&rsquo;s a big difference between Norway and North Korea.</p>
<p>In North Korea, they only claim to have the entitlements and they definitely don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the liberties.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s one right that&rsquo;s more important than others?</p>
<p>You kind of suggested the freedom of the press, maybe freedom of speech, that if you take</p>
<p>that away, all the other ones kind of collapse along with like from a ripple effect.</p>
<p>Is there something fundamental that you like to focus your attention on to defend, to protect,</p>
<p>to make sure it&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think free speech is probably the most fundamental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably why the founders chose to make it into the First Amendment.</p>
<p>A lot of things are downstream from there.</p>
<p>Property rights are also very, very important.</p>
<p>Obviously we&rsquo;ve seen the toll of violent redistributionism, you know, in over the last hundred years,</p>
<p>whether it was Lenin or Stalin or Mao or other regimes and everywhere from Ethiopia to colonialists</p>
<p>everywhere to North Korea, it&rsquo;s not a pretty legacy.</p>
<p>Is free speech clear to you as a concept?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been quite a few debates, especially in the digital age, what it means to violate</p>
<p>freedom of speech.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of new, like novel mechanisms for people to communicate with each other,</p>
<p>like especially on social networks.</p>
<p>And it seems that unclear because a lot of times those are managed by private companies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how much protection do the citizens have to have when they&rsquo;re communicating.</p>
<p>A lot of people are being censored on these social platforms.</p>
<p>Some people, even presidents get removed from those social platforms.</p>
<p>Have you thought about the freedom of speech in the United States, but in the world?</p>
<p>As it&rsquo;s implemented in the 21st century, given the internet and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>There is a Soviet dissident named Natan Sharansky who survived the regime and he wrote a book</p>
<p>in which his thesis was essentially the way that you can define a free society is through</p>
<p>something called the town square test.</p>
<p>Can you go to a public space where you live and criticize your ruler loudly without fear</p>
<p>of retribution?</p>
<p>If you can do that, you have free speech.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good litmus test.</p>
<p>Most people in this world cannot do that.</p>
<p>If you live in Havana, if you live in Moscow, if you live in Beijing, you cannot do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a free society.</p>
<p>In Austin, Texas, in Boston, Massachusetts, in London, in Santiago, Chile, in Tokyo, Japan,</p>
<p>in many democracies, you can do that.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a really helpful basic sort of litmus test.</p>
<p>Does the content of the criticism matter?</p>
<p>Can it be complete lies, meaning conspiracy theories that involve claiming that the leader</p>
<p>is, let&rsquo;s say, a lizard slash pedophile slash, you know, I&rsquo;m not saying that those are lies,</p>
<p>look into it, but they&rsquo;re very unlikely phenomena.</p>
<p>So like, does that matter?</p>
<p>I think it ends poorly when the state tries to restrict speech.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of how I would define censorship.</p>
<p>I think censorship and deplatforming are two different things.</p>
<p>Private companies, you know, they get to make up their own rules about what&rsquo;s allowed on</p>
<p>their platforms.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s very different from a government with guns and an army restricting the speech</p>
<p>of its citizens with threats of violence.</p>
<p>These things are different for me.</p>
<p>That violence is a fundamental difference.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to have dinner with Alex Jones and I&rsquo;ve talked to</p>
<p>him a few times offline and it does, I understand why people are so off put by him, but it does</p>
<p>bother me that he&rsquo;s universally removed from every platform.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s many more evil people, bad people compared to Alex Jones who still</p>
<p>are given a voice on these platforms.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the universality of the application of the censorship by these</p>
<p>platforms.</p>
<p>But on the flip side, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a violence, there&rsquo;s not tanks, there&rsquo;s not guns behind that censorship.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a generalization, but Alex Jones would be in prison or dead if he were in North</p>
<p>Korea or in Cuba or in Russia or in China, that the authorities would not tolerate him</p>
<p>to do what he did.</p>
<p>And here he can kind of do what he wants.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s encountering some resistance in the marketplace of ideas, large organizations, corporations,</p>
<p>and a lot of public sentiment in different parts of our country don&rsquo;t like him.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing their best to drown out his voice, but that&rsquo;s very different from a violent</p>
<p>threat of censorship from the state.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we study.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I study are these, you know, what is the state doing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of paramount for me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true because in the marketplace of ideas, there could be a company that springs</p>
<p>up that gives Alex Jones a platform and the United States is not going to prevent those</p>
<p>companies from functioning.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s from a technology perspective, there is AWS removing Parler from the platform</p>
<p>and gets a little weird, you know, as you get closer and closer to the computer infrastructure,</p>
<p>because then you get closer and closer to the state, actually, the more you get to the</p>
<p>infrastructure that&rsquo;s usually managed by the state, the closer it gets to then the control</p>
<p>of the state.</p>
<p>I would argue AWS is pretty damn close to infrastructure that&rsquo;s kind of controlled</p>
<p>by the state.</p>
<p>If you especially look at other nations, China, Russia, there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know who runs the</p>
<p>computer infrastructure for Russia and China, but I bet the state has complete oversight</p>
<p>over that.</p>
<p>And so that level of computer infrastructure, having control about which social networks</p>
<p>can and cannot operate is very uncomfortable to me.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right, I think it&rsquo;s good to focus on the obvious violations of these principles</p>
<p>as opposed to the gray areas.</p>
<p>Of course, the gray areas are fascinating.</p>
<p>You mentioned HRF, Human Rights Foundation.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>What is its mission?</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve been working for HRF since 2007.</p>
<p>We are a charity, a nonprofit, a 501c3 based in New York, and our mission is to promote</p>
<p>and protect individual rights and freedoms in authoritarian societies around the world.</p>
<p>So again, we define about 95 countries as authoritarian, meaning it&rsquo;s either a one party</p>
<p>state or opposition politicians are outlawed or persecuted, there&rsquo;s no real free speech,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no press freedom, there&rsquo;s no independent judiciary, there really aren&rsquo;t checks and</p>
<p>balances and even trying to create like a human rights organization or like an environmental</p>
<p>group would be illegal.</p>
<p>And the majority of the world&rsquo;s population lives in that environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>You said 53%.</p>
<p>53%, 4.3 billion people.</p>
<p>And I saw you outlined a lot of different sources of suffering in the world.</p>
<p>And then you sort of put people living under authoritarian governments as like more than</p>
<p>all of them.</p>
<p>I forget all the examples you provided, but then&hellip;</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe you can mention if you remember.</p>
<p>The number of people who are refugees, the number of people who suffer from natural disasters,</p>
<p>the number of people who live under abject poverty, the number of people who don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>access to clean drinking water, all of these are dwarfed by the number of people who live</p>
<p>under authoritarianism.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s not something that we talk about a lot because people are mercantilist and</p>
<p>the powers that be are happy to sacrifice freedoms and privacy for money.</p>
<p>We live in a profit seeking world.</p>
<p>To get evidence of this, take a look at the list of sponsors of the upcoming Olympics</p>
<p>in China where the CCP is currently committing genocide against the weaker population or</p>
<p>look at the number of people and the famous investors who went to Saudi Arabia a couple</p>
<p>months ago for the Davos in the desert.</p>
<p>I mean, Ray Dalio was there, all kinds of people were there, or at least they were invited</p>
<p>and they said they were gonna go.</p>
<p>And this is a government that at the time was torturing a female activist who just wanted</p>
<p>to drive a car.</p>
<p>This is a government that had murdered Jamal Khashoggi in a brutal fashion just a couple</p>
<p>years earlier.</p>
<p>So, I mean, at the end of the day when it comes down to brass tacks, I mean, the powers</p>
<p>that be, even the free countries are led by people who are very, very happy to sacrifice</p>
<p>all these pretty words about human rights when it comes down to profits, unfortunately.</p>
<p>So, do you think capitalism, that&rsquo;s maybe one of the flaws of capitalism is it turns</p>
<p>a blind eye to injustices against human nature, against the human rights, like it turns a</p>
<p>blind eye to authoritarian governments?</p>
<p>Look, I think that at the end of the day, like free trade is actually really good.</p>
<p>And you can just look at France and Germany as an example of how like a capitalist structure</p>
<p>would develop.</p>
<p>If you have two capitalist actors, they&rsquo;re very unlikely to fight each other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very unlikely to be violence, right?</p>
<p>These are two countries which basically murdered some large percentage of each other&rsquo;s male</p>
<p>population three times in a hundred years in three different wars, right?</p>
<p>And now today, war is like unthinkable and a lot of that is because of increased collaboration,</p>
<p>increased trade.</p>
<p>So, when you have two capitalist actors, they act in a very productive way with each other.</p>
<p>But as soon as you introduce an authoritarian actor, all bets are off.</p>
<p>So, I think what you have is a conflict between capitalist actors and authoritarian actors.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, people need to, yes, have more than just capitalist intentions</p>
<p>in the geopolitical level I&rsquo;m talking about, they need to actually take a stand for principles.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you have athletes and businesses and governments that are all too happy to</p>
<p>do business with the Chinese Communist Party, for example, right now.</p>
<p>I think that there is a little more than just kind of the pure profit, yes.</p>
<p>You mentioned what are the signs that the state is an authoritarian state.</p>
<p>How do you know if you&rsquo;re living in an authoritarian state or when you study another nation and</p>
<p>analyze the behavior of another nation, how do you know that&rsquo;s an authoritarian state?</p>
<p>Is it as simple as them having a dictator?</p>
<p>Is it as simple as them as declaring that they don&rsquo;t have a democracy or is there something</p>
<p>more subtle?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of good litmus tests.</p>
<p>One is actually, can you have a gay pride parade?</p>
<p>It actually lines up perfectly, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what religion the dictatorship is.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like minorities and they love to scapegoat, whether it&rsquo;s gays or religious</p>
<p>minorities, etc.</p>
<p>So it lines up pretty well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>If you cannot have a gay pride parade in your country, because you&rsquo;re fearful that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get the crap kicked out of you, probably live in an authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not just about some kind of homophobia.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through&hellip;</p>
<p>Fascism scapegoats minorities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an other, you create an other group and then you&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean Uganda is a great example of this, but so is Saudi Arabia, so is China.</p>
<p>I mean, so is Cuba.</p>
<p>I mean, these are all regimes which demonize the LGBT communities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because maybe you can correct me, but from my very distant outside of perspective,</p>
<p>the sort of the way that certain authoritarian governments speak about gay people is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost like, what is it?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have gay people in our country kind of idea as opposed to scapegoating, which</p>
<p>is like&hellip;</p>
<p>Total denial is the most powerful form of demonization.</p>
<p>I mean, this is what the Iranian dictatorship does.</p>
<p>A few years ago when Ahmadinejad, who was then sort of the de facto leader, he came</p>
<p>to Columbia University and he tried to give a speech, which you can look up and he tried</p>
<p>to claim that there were no gays in Iran.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the most powerful form of demonization is trying to just wipe out your utter existence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other good litmus tests too.</p>
<p>For example, you can think about comedy.</p>
<p>Can you make money making fun of your government on television?</p>
<p>If you cannot, you live in a dictatorship most likely.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s shocking to people that I work with who live in dictatorships when I tell</p>
<p>them that not only are comedians able to safely make fun of our government, but they get paid</p>
<p>very well to do so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hallmark of our free society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another good litmus test.</p>
<p>Hear that Tim Dylan, you should go to North Korea, check it out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And look, there are tons of flaws with democracies.</p>
<p>This is a really good test by the way.</p>
<p>The United States is a deeply flawed country in many ways.</p>
<p>Our prison system is a disaster.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a horrible war on drugs.</p>
<p>We committed a grievous crime in my opinion by invading Iraq.</p>
<p>We did a lot of problematic things, but our core architecture is still an open society.</p>
<p>The people who criticize the US the most usually live within it.</p>
<p>And if they were to move to a different country and try to use that criticism against their</p>
<p>new rulers, they wouldn&rsquo;t fare so well.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s Chomsky or whomever, if they were to go to Cuba and live in Cuba and try</p>
<p>to criticize Cuba like they do America, it wouldn&rsquo;t last very long.</p>
<p>So I think what&rsquo;s important to distinguish between open societies and closed ones or</p>
<p>like free societies and authoritarian regimes, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that your government&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be good all the time.</p>
<p>What it means is that the citizens have a way to push for reform, have a way to hold</p>
<p>the rulers accountable.</p>
<p>So even if you don&rsquo;t like what the US government does, whether it was under Biden or Trump</p>
<p>or Obama or Bush, we can rotate them through voting.</p>
<p>And we have an independent Supreme Court that rotates over time.</p>
<p>And we have people that we can elect directly to serve our interests.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like a free press and there&rsquo;s lobbyists and all kinds of people that jostle</p>
<p>for power.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a separation of powers.</p>
<p>And I like to think about a free society really as like at the bottom of the foundation of</p>
<p>the pyramid really would be free speech.</p>
<p>And then you would have civil society, like for example, human rights organizations, environmental</p>
<p>groups, stamp collectors, athletes, any groups that come together beyond the government&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of strict instruction.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, at the third level, you have separation of powers, again, what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m describing.</p>
<p>So authoritarian regimes don&rsquo;t really have any of these layers to them.</p>
<p>And then at the top, then you put elections, but the elections are meaningless if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the foundation below.</p>
<p>Every dictator gets elected.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un gets elected.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the only person on the ballot.</p>
<p>Every dictator from Hitler to Chavez, they all got elected.</p>
<p>Elections on their own mean literally nothing.</p>
<p>You have to have these other layers beneath to actually be an open and free society.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important for people to understand.</p>
<p>Although Hitler in an interesting way, at a certain point just said, I&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>a ruler forever, which is interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an important switch that happens when you, as opposed to having a facade of elections,</p>
<p>you just put that aside and saying basically like, we&rsquo;re not even doing this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a ladder that you climb the election and you pull the ladder up and then no one</p>
<p>else can climb up.</p>
<p>This sadly happened in Egypt and it was quite predictable.</p>
<p>After Mubarak was ousted after the Arab Spring, Morsi came in and it looked like the Muslim</p>
<p>Brotherhood was not really going to be very democratic.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t really matter because then the military came back and now we have Sisi who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even worse than Mubarak.</p>
<p>So a lot of times in these regimes, unfortunately, it&rsquo;s very difficult for people to build that</p>
<p>democratic society afterwards.</p>
<p>Some people have told me that when you live in a totalitarian or authoritarian regime,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a political desert.</p>
<p>What grows in the desert?</p>
<p>Scorpions and cacti, right?</p>
<p>So basically people with very extreme views because you as an authoritarian ruler, your</p>
<p>best method for control is to get rid of the moderates.</p>
<p>You have to crush the moderates.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>You want to have the only opposition to you be extremists.</p>
<p>That way when you go and have negotiations with the United States, you can kind of hold</p>
<p>up the terrorists or whomever, the extremists and say, it&rsquo;s either us or them, right?</p>
<p>And then the realists who run the US government are going to choose you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, one of the reasons why the US government has supported so many dictators</p>
<p>around the world over the last few decades.</p>
<p>Do you think authoritarian systems emerge naturally, like that&rsquo;s the natural state of</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>If you incorporate what human nature is, is there always going to be corrupt people the</p>
<p>rise to the top?</p>
<p>And we almost have to construct systems that protect us against ourselves kind of thing.</p>
<p>Another way to ask that is what kind of systems protect us from our own human nature?</p>
<p>We started with authoritarianism or autocracy, right?</p>
<p>Ruled by one or a small group oligarchy, and all humans lived under this structure for,</p>
<p>you know, the virtual, you know, bulk of all human existence.</p>
<p>Only until pretty recently did we start having actual democracy.</p>
<p>The idea that we should be ruled by rules, not by rulers, very powerful.</p>
<p>Invented in many places across the world.</p>
<p>Western Africa had this idea and so did the ancient Greeks.</p>
<p>And they started to implement it.</p>
<p>Although as most know, we didn&rsquo;t have full democracy for a long, long time because it</p>
<p>was only property owners or only men, only people of a certain race.</p>
<p>But this idea that we can like rotate our rulers and that we could be ruled by rules</p>
<p>is extremely powerful and it really like for me, the ideas behind this, I think unlocked</p>
<p>a lot of the industrial revolution, these small personal freedoms that were allowed</p>
<p>in some countries, but not others.</p>
<p>And they unlocked a lot of the scientific innovation over the last few hundred years.</p>
<p>And to me, there&rsquo;s like a really straight line between like scientific inquiry, free</p>
<p>speech, freedoms, and then more prosperity and more effectiveness as a civilization.</p>
<p>So I think that democracy, you know, ruled by the people is definitely an upgrade from</p>
<p>autocracy or oligarchy, you know, which would be ruled by one or ruled by a small group.</p>
<p>And I think that the democratic revolution has been an incredible thing for our world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, you can do half class full, half class empty.</p>
<p>The half class full is that almost half the world lives under democracy.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s an incredible achievement.</p>
<p>But just under half.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just under half.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s billions of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s billions of people.</p>
<p>And if you look at the progress of things, it&rsquo;s getting better and better and better.</p>
<p>I mean, if you, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a little bit of a stalemate here.</p>
<p>Democracy&rsquo;s really blossomed between World War II and the year 2000, especially in the</p>
<p>eighties and nineties, you had an incredible wave of fall, you know, where many, many authoritarian</p>
<p>regimes fell and were replaced by democracies.</p>
<p>I think around 2015, the acceleration kind of came to a standstill a little bit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some good news in some countries and there&rsquo;s bad news in others.</p>
<p>Like in the last 10 years, you&rsquo;ve had, for example, the Philippines has gone backwards.</p>
<p>Thailand has gone backwards.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has gone backwards.</p>
<p>Turkey has gone backwards.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a half billion people right there.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve had some positives, like, you know, there was positive movement forward in Armenia,</p>
<p>Malaysia, some other countries, but we&rsquo;re kind of at a stalemate right now.</p>
<p>And what most people fear about where we are right now, who I respect, is what is the digital</p>
<p>transformation of the world due to this like progress of democracy or of open societies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what concerns me the most.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve, and we&rsquo;ll talk about one of the most fascinating technologies, which is Bitcoin,</p>
<p>how it can help.</p>
<p>But I have a sense that technology, like most technological innovations will give power</p>
<p>to the individuals, will fight authoritarian governments as opposed to give more power</p>
<p>to authoritarian governments.</p>
<p>But your sense is there&rsquo;s ways to give for technology to be utilized as a tool for the</p>
<p>abuse of the citizenry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen both.</p>
<p>In my work at Ahrefs, I started by helping to put together backpacks with foreign information</p>
<p>that we sent to the Cuban underground library movement.</p>
<p>So in Cuba, you know, to own a book at the time, you had to have the government&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little internet penetration.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we would send in movies, you know, V for Vendetta, dubbed into Spanish, and people</p>
<p>would sit inside their homes and they&rsquo;d watch it and they would answer questions with each</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>It was awful.</p>
<p>And then after that, I worked with people inside North Korea.</p>
<p>We would send in flash drives.</p>
<p>We have this program called Flash Drives for Freedom.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve sent over 100,000 flash drives in our work into North Korea, a country of about</p>
<p>25 million people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big, big difference.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you know, many, many millions of hours of films, books, movies, etc.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve seen the power that technology can have where, you know, in the 60s and 70s,</p>
<p>you know, to get to break an information blockade, you had to like send in crates of books into</p>
<p>a communist country.</p>
<p>So now all of a sudden, you can send the entire contents of what was once the Library of Alexandria</p>
<p>on something the size of your thumbnail, like that&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>So obviously, I&rsquo;ve seen the positives of technology and we&rsquo;ll certainly get into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m, you know, very concerned about essentially big data analysis, like what people call AI</p>
<p>or general, you know, specific kinds of AI, like very concerning.</p>
<p>I think these are very authoritarian.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very hard to make a case that AI is going to be good for human rights.</p>
<p>Very difficult, in my opinion.</p>
<p>It may be good for health.</p>
<p>It may be good for our efforts to protect the planet.</p>
<p>It may be good for a lot of scientific things.</p>
<p>I find it very hard to believe it&rsquo;ll be good for civil liberties.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>This is fun because I disagree.</p>
<p>Give me your examples.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>What AI applications will improve civil liberties?</p>
<p>I thought you meant examples of stuff that&rsquo;s already out there, because I can give you</p>
<p>examples that, for example, the kind of things I would like to work on, but also the kind</p>
<p>of things I&rsquo;m hoping to see, which is AI could be used by centralized powers, by governments,</p>
<p>by big organizations like Facebook and Twitter and so on to collect data about people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I believe there&rsquo;s a huge hunger among people to have control over their own data.</p>
<p>So instead you can have AI that&rsquo;s distributed or people have complete ownership of their</p>
<p>little AI systems.</p>
<p>So like the kind of stuff that I would like to build or like to see it to be built is</p>
<p>you could think of it as personal assistance or AI that&rsquo;s owned by you and you get to give</p>
<p>it out.</p>
<p>You have complete control over all of your data.</p>
<p>You have complete control over everything that&rsquo;s learnable about your day to day experiences</p>
<p>that could be useful in the market of goods and ideas and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So it has to do with, so I know you talk about the surveillance, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s who gets to have control of the data.</p>
<p>And I think, I believe there&rsquo;s a lot of hunger in among regular people to have control over</p>
<p>their data such that if you want to create a business, you have a lot of money to be</p>
<p>made from a capitalist perspective by providing products that let people control their data</p>
<p>where you have no control.</p>
<p>Sounds like to me you&rsquo;re describing encryption or at least the ability to encrypt, the ability</p>
<p>to use digital keys to secure your property.</p>
<p>And that to me is a very powerful force for individual rights, very powerful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what animates Bitcoin ultimately, which we&rsquo;ll get into.</p>
<p>But for me, at least the way I look at it today in 2021, the threat from big data analysis</p>
<p>used by governments and authoritarian regimes is terrifying.</p>
<p>I mean, to actually see what the Chinese Communist Party is doing where they have hundreds of</p>
<p>millions of cameras overseeing society, cameras that can tell who&rsquo;s a Uyghur and who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>Ham, that to me is terrifying and everything is sorted instantly.</p>
<p>There are supercomputers that are built in Urumqi, in Xinjiang for this explicit purpose.</p>
<p>And it allows the government to quickly sort and basically commit genocide a lot faster</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really scary.</p>
<p>So I do agree and I&rsquo;ve seen personally how powerful technology can be as a force for</p>
<p>freedom, but I&rsquo;m very, very worried about big data analysis in the hands of governments.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s funny because I tend to see governments as ultimately incompetent in the space of</p>
<p>technology to where there will always be lagging behind.</p>
<p>So you look at what the Chinese surveillance systems are doing, I believe once it starts</p>
<p>getting bad enough that technologies would be created to resist that.</p>
<p>So to mess with it from the hacker community, but also from the individual community.</p>
<p>So surveillance is actually very difficult from a centralized perspective to collect</p>
<p>data about you, to detect everything you are because you can spoof a lot of that information.</p>
<p>So I believe you can put power in the hands of the citizens to sort of feed the government</p>
<p>fake data to confuse it at a mass scale to where it&rsquo;ll make their surveillance less effective.</p>
<p>That could be very sort of hopeful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, the practical application in Xinjiang, which is a territory the size of Alaska, where</p>
<p>a large percentage of the population has been put into prison camps.</p>
<p>The current issue of the New Yorker has an absolutely harrowing essay that tells the</p>
<p>story of one such woman who in, I believe, 2017 got sucked into one of these camps and</p>
<p>it took her a year or more to get out.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s talking about how in each home in Xinjiang, each home has a QR code on it that</p>
<p>the police can scan and get like a quick instant download of who lives there.</p>
<p>Each car has, you know, like a scannable code.</p>
<p>Every single person has their DNA taken and the DNA is being sifted through and analyzed</p>
<p>by algorithms.</p>
<p>So this is like the Chinese government&rsquo;s laboratory for how can we use technology to oppress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like sort of like digital Leninism.</p>
<p>And that to me is one of the biggest risks in our world today and it&rsquo;s not talked about</p>
<p>enough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So technology is basically enables the automation of oppression.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So like&hellip;</p>
<p>But to define technology, big data analysis and, you know, maybe specific AI, etc. does,</p>
<p>but encryption allows us to fight back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important people understand we have tools to fight back.</p>
<p>The, you know, big brother can only grow if it can feed on your data.</p>
<p>If it can&rsquo;t get your data, it can&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>So you have to willingly give up stuff to the cloud for this monster to grow.</p>
<p>We can like make the monster hungry and shrink it if we give it less data.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where I would agree with you in terms of like wanting to empower people</p>
<p>to be able to do stuff on their own terms in a sovereign way.</p>
<p>And yeah, maybe you&rsquo;re kind of thinking like the personal assistant who helps out Tony</p>
<p>Stark or something like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, yeah, as long as there&rsquo;s no back doors and that&rsquo;s a sovereign thing that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>popped up and created and you have the keys to, absolutely.</p>
<p>But practically speaking, if we&rsquo;re talking about the world today as is, we need to be</p>
<p>concerned about the way that authoritarian regimes are using big data analysis and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to buy this software and this equipment from the Chinese government, they&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>doing it.</p>
<p>State level surveillance has already been purchased by governments everywhere from Latin</p>
<p>America to Sub Saharan Africa to the heart of Europe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been huge scandals in Britain over their purchase of Chinese surveillance technology.</p>
<p>Part of the Chinese government&rsquo;s Belt and Road campaign, which is basically to build</p>
<p>the infrastructure of this century and to be in control of it, part of that idea is</p>
<p>to ship out and install surveillance technology both at the telecom level and at the surveillance</p>
<p>level across dozens of countries around the world and have that back door.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this national security law in China, which states that companies that are Chinese,</p>
<p>which are abroad, are mandated to send data back to Beijing.</p>
<p>So they are building this huge global surveillance state.</p>
<p>And again, not talked about enough, you should go Google and research the Belt and Road.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important that we confront this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m really glad you&rsquo;re talking about it because it&rsquo;s probably important to understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also hopeful that as people get educated about how much their data, when collected,</p>
<p>unencrypted, but in general, can be used to harm them.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s almost like an education.</p>
<p>I feel like if you know, it&rsquo;s a double edged sword because I feel like people become fearful</p>
<p>too easily and that actually has a very negative effect on the quality of life.</p>
<p>In some sense, you want to have tools that allow you to live freely as opposed to live</p>
<p>in fear.</p>
<p>If you live in fear, it&rsquo;s not a good way to live.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a free society versus a fear society.</p>
<p>Yeah, fear society.</p>
<p>And look, people are, it&rsquo;s all about the trade offs you make in your daily life.</p>
<p>Like living more privately with more freedom is less convenient.</p>
<p>You trade freedom and privacy for convenience and comfort and speed.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And the engineering decision and everything that you do.</p>
<p>In the West, in advanced democracies, we have not necessarily personally seen the results</p>
<p>of that trade off because we live in these free societies that have these checks and</p>
<p>balances and freedoms.</p>
<p>But as soon as you step into an authoritarian state and you make those trade offs, your</p>
<p>life immediately becomes more restrictive.</p>
<p>And what people are worried about is that even in advanced economies, market democracies,</p>
<p>etc., people are worried that they might not survive the great social digital transformation.</p>
<p>You know, look at what the NSA is capable of doing.</p>
<p>I mean, for now, it&rsquo;s not that big of a problem because we still have free speech.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s deeply concerning what Snowden revealed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a nice reminder that we need to be focused on privacy and encryption and on helping</p>
<p>users become more sovereign regardless of where you live.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a crutch to live in a free society.</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s almost like a free lunch in a way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be sent to a prison camp because of the color of your skin or your</p>
<p>beliefs or what you say about the government.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re very lucky.</p>
<p>Again, most people do live in a society where you can be persecuted for those things.</p>
<p>And I feel like, especially in America, we forget that we&rsquo;re distanced from that really</p>
<p>strong reality, you know.</p>
<p>On the topic of Snowden and the NSA, what should we be thinking about?</p>
<p>Because that feels like already an outdated set of conversations because of the information</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve gotten from the past.</p>
<p>It feels like everything&rsquo;s gotten quiet now in terms of how much we actually know about</p>
<p>the&hellip;</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s hugely important.</p>
<p>I think the two lessons from Snowden are, A, the Patriot Act and the War on Terror and</p>
<p>mass surveillance are not necessary for our democracy and for our freedoms.</p>
<p>This was a false choice.</p>
<p>We never had to sacrifice them to be safer.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen that.</p>
<p>The government has spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on these like surveillance</p>
<p>programs that you can read about have amounted to very little, except for tremendous bureaucratic</p>
<p>waste and, you know, erosion of our freedoms.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we need to practice more privacy.</p>
<p>And the dramatic increase in the usage of Signal, for example, has been really, really</p>
<p>great to see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic that tens of millions of people are downloading Signal and using it.</p>
<p>You should try to be onboarding more and more of your conversations onto Signal, for example,</p>
<p>where governments can&rsquo;t see what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Maybe they can see the metadata.</p>
<p>Maybe they can see that you sent your phone number, sent a message to someone else&rsquo;s phone</p>
<p>number at this time, but they can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s inside.</p>
<p>So using encryption in your life is very, very important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good starting point.</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s kind of step A.</p>
<p>The ideas of democracy, the ideas of the balance of power, all the ideas that we were talking</p>
<p>about, the constructs, were inventions.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s other inventions that will allow us to sort of not engage, not give</p>
<p>governments or any centralized institutions so much power.</p>
<p>Why do citizens have to use Signal?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s an effort.</p>
<p>You have to understand exactly why.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a nice little solution for a particular set of problems.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a million other ways that data, I&rsquo;m sure, is being collected constantly.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t create a system that prevents the establishment of these centralized powers,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll always have this problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we can keep it simple for the purposes of this conversation.</p>
<p>You have politics, information, and money.</p>
<p>Those are the three things I would encourage us to focus on.</p>
<p>In politics, yes, someone invented democracy.</p>
<p>I mean, whether it was the Greeks, the West Africans, or many others around the world</p>
<p>around the same time invented this idea that we should be ruled by rules and not by rulers.</p>
<p>And that has evolved dramatically.</p>
<p>And then you have information.</p>
<p>Information also used to be highly centralized, right?</p>
<p>Think about how rich you had to be to gain access to a library before the printing press,</p>
<p>or how much money you had to have, or how close to the king or the feudal lord you had</p>
<p>to be to be able to have that ability.</p>
<p>But now, the majority of the world, billions of people have access to all information in</p>
<p>their pocket, and they can set up an account on social media and get their word out.</p>
<p>So not only politics, but information has been dramatically decentralized.</p>
<p>And I would say that encrypted messaging is kind of a corollary to that second innovation</p>
<p>in as much as now people are like more effortlessly, like Signal is a lot easier to use than PGP,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more easily able to practice privacy when it comes to having private messages globally.</p>
<p>These are all good things and we need to keep pushing.</p>
<p>And I think money is like, honestly, maybe the most important piece.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I spent so much time thinking about Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Okay, so politics, information, money, yes, let&rsquo;s talk about money.</p>
<p>What is money?</p>
<p>Why is it important to think about in the context of human rights?</p>
<p>I have witnessed money be peripheralized, it has taken a backseat in the human rights</p>
<p>conversation.</p>
<p>The idea of currency, who makes the money, who makes the rules, who issues it, who sets</p>
<p>the interest rates, all these things, it is not on the menu of human rights activists.</p>
<p>If you just do like a systematic study of like the human rights discourse over the last</p>
<p>several decades, money is not there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not really taught in schools.</p>
<p>Like children don&rsquo;t really learn about money, where does it come from?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hidden from a lot of our discourse.</p>
<p>Only really when I got into Bitcoin did I started learning more about money.</p>
<p>I spent 10 years at the Human Rights Foundation and we did all kinds of programs around the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>We convened Oslo Freedom Forums in different places and I got to meet hundreds of dissidents.</p>
<p>And very rarely did they ever speak about currency or bank accounts or moving money</p>
<p>from one place to another.</p>
<p>But when I started asking them, they always had amazing stories about money, always.</p>
<p>I mean, my friend, Ivan Mawire, who started the This Flag movement in Zimbabwe, which</p>
<p>ended up toppling Robert Mugabe, when I asked him to come to San Francisco to give a talk</p>
<p>about hyperinflation, which he lived through.</p>
<p>He said, no one&rsquo;s ever asked me to do that before, but I&rsquo;ll come.</p>
<p>And he came, this was about three years ago.</p>
<p>And the first thing he did when he got on the stage is he opened up a shirt and he brought</p>
<p>out a necklace that had the 1980 Zimbabwean dollar on it.</p>
<p>And he said, we in the activist community wear this as a symbol of where our country</p>
<p>used to be because the Zimbabwean dollar used to be worth two British pounds.</p>
<p>And then of course, over the next two and a half decades of economic mismanagement and</p>
<p>corruption by Mugabe, it got inflated out of existence, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen those like a hundred trillion dollars in Zimbabwean notes.</p>
<p>So he had to live through that, which was terrible and crushing, but he is an expert</p>
<p>on money.</p>
<p>If you actually talk to human rights activists about money, they know a lot about money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not usually asked to talk about it.</p>
<p>So for me, when I study money or look at money, it&rsquo;s really about control, who&rsquo;s creating</p>
<p>it, and how much does the population know about the creation of that money.</p>
<p>And when it comes to Bitcoin, it&rsquo;s really the people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>Like there is no shadowy force in charge of it.</p>
<p>We all know the rules.</p>
<p>We all know how it&rsquo;s going to get minted and how it&rsquo;s going to get printed.</p>
<p>And you know, that information is out there for everybody to see.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no like special group of rules for one group of people or another group.</p>
<p>You know, a billionaire and a refugee are the same in the eyes of the protocol.</p>
<p>This is a rather revolutionary concept.</p>
<p>And in the same way that democracy allowed us to decentralize politics and have checks</p>
<p>and balances.</p>
<p>And in the same way that the internet is this culmination of technologies that allowed us</p>
<p>to decentralize information, access to and control over it, Bitcoin, you know, decentralizes</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>I mean, no longer, again, is there one group of people who can just change it arbitrarily.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all in the same playing field.</p>
<p>And I think that that is a tremendous innovation.</p>
<p>You know, from one perspective, money and inflation, hyperinflation is a kind of symptom</p>
<p>of corruption, as opposed to the core of the corruption.</p>
<p>And at the flip side, in terms of resisting the corruption, resisting the abuse of human</p>
<p>rights, it&rsquo;s interesting to think that fighting inflation or fighting the mismanagement of</p>
<p>the money supply is a way to fight back authoritarianism or to fight authoritarianism.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an interesting concept that I think was introduced to me by just plugging myself</p>
<p>intellectually into the Bitcoin community, but also just cryptocurrency in general, is</p>
<p>to like, it&rsquo;s not that money is a symptom.</p>
<p>You know, money is a tool to fight back, too.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So in what way can Bitcoin be used to fight authoritarianism, not just in the United States,</p>
<p>but all of those 53% that you&rsquo;re referring to, how can Bitcoin help?</p>
<p>So we talked about authoritarianism, and we talked about the surveillance state.</p>
<p>To me, Bitcoin has two kind of key mechanisms through which it can help us.</p>
<p>Number one, it&rsquo;s a sovereign savings account.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s debasement proof, meaning the government cannot print more whenever they want.</p>
<p>This is very, very different from fiat currency, which by its very name, its very nature can</p>
<p>be issued on sort of demand, right, by the rulers.</p>
<p>And while I live in a country where the rulers do a reasonable job managing the money, most</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t so lucky.</p>
<p>So only 13% of humans in the world live in a country that&rsquo;s a liberal democracy with</p>
<p>property rights and has what we call a reserve currency, meaning a currency so stable and</p>
<p>desirable that other countries save in it at the central bank level, right?</p>
<p>You basically have the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Switzerland, the Euro, and Canada.</p>
<p>I mean, those are like reserve currencies.</p>
<p>And these are liberal democracies where people have reasonable guarantees over property rights.</p>
<p>Everybody else either lives under like a weaker currency or an authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 87% of the world&rsquo;s population, almost 7 billion people.</p>
<p>So for them, a sovereign savings account that&rsquo;s permissionless, meaning you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>have ID to use it, is a big, big deal.</p>
<p>And a lot of people talk about Zimbabwe or Venezuela as some like isolated cases.</p>
<p>Oh, well, you know, hyperinflation only happens in those two countries.</p>
<p>I actually did some research into this and there&rsquo;s about one point, over, you know, close</p>
<p>to 1.3 billion people who live under double or triple digit inflation.</p>
<p>This is not an isolated instance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking huge countries, Nigeria, 200 million people, 15% inflation, Turkey, 15%</p>
<p>inflation for 100 million people, Argentina, 40% inflation for a country of 45 million</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>So you can go down the list, there&rsquo;s about 35 countries where like people&rsquo;s earnings,</p>
<p>their wages are literally disappearing in front of their eyes over a matter of weeks</p>
<p>or months against things like the dollar or gold or real estate, right?</p>
<p>So this is a huge issue.</p>
<p>It absolutely is a human rights issue for me.</p>
<p>I mean, when it comes to your time and energy, having control over that or having it stolen</p>
<p>from you, I think this is pretty clear.</p>
<p>And Bitcoin is like an immediate, low cost, easily accessible solution for people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve learned this not from my own assumptions, but by talking to people, by interviewing</p>
<p>dozens of people, whether it&rsquo;s in Sudan, which currently has triple digit inflation, or people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve escaped from Syria, who have used Bitcoin to get their wealth out of the country, and</p>
<p>then also to make payments back to people inside, or Venezuela or elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very powerful.</p>
<p>I think some very small percentage of people who have used, have owned Bitcoin was something</p>
<p>like 1%, right?</p>
<p>Of the world, whatever that number is, it&rsquo;s small.</p>
<p>Call it 2% for the purposes of our, about a little under 200 million people.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At most, right now.</p>
<p>So if we look at Zimbabwe, Sudan, if we look at&hellip;</p>
<p>Small percentages of people.</p>
<p>Do you think the technology is mature enough?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not just about the idea, it&rsquo;s also about the implementation of it.</p>
<p>Like Bitcoin, for the most part, requires access to the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what do you think about accessibility of this technology now as a method of activism</p>
<p>in the worst parts of the world?</p>
<p>We often think like all the conversations we&rsquo;ve had about Bitcoin is essentially middle</p>
<p>class, like wealthy people relative to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of talking sort of investment and high concept ideas.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s also the people in the world who are suffering, who are living through</p>
<p>hyperinflation.</p>
<p>They may not have a computer or access to the internet.</p>
<p>How do you think Bitcoin can help there?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So again, we have one clear use case, which is a sovereign savings account that you can</p>
<p>control, right?</p>
<p>The other use case is an unstoppable payments network.</p>
<p>This is very important for people who live behind, for example, sanctions, like the US</p>
<p>like basically weaponizes the dollar and like sanctions different countries.</p>
<p>And instead of sanctioning like a handful of rulers, for example, which I would support,</p>
<p>this is like a Magnitsky or smart sanctions.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;ll just say, we&rsquo;re just going to shut off this whole country.</p>
<p>So the people suffer.</p>
<p>Cuba or Iran are good examples.</p>
<p>Average people suffer, right?</p>
<p>So people in those two countries I just mentioned, Cuba, Iran, or even Palestine, which is also</p>
<p>sort of like blockaded by the Israelis.</p>
<p>So you have Cuba, Iran, Palestine are three good examples where people inside all three</p>
<p>of those countries now are using Bitcoin to do commerce, do their business, send money</p>
<p>back and forth.</p>
<p>So sanctions resistant.</p>
<p>Sanctions resistant.</p>
<p>It does not get stopped by sanctions, right?</p>
<p>And also it&rsquo;s, again, remittances are extortionate.</p>
<p>I mean, the average remittance, you know, costs has a high fee, takes several days.</p>
<p>If your family is in Ghana or something like that, or Nigeria, and you live in the United</p>
<p>States, it can take time to use Western Union.</p>
<p>Sometimes it gets paused, it gets lost, there&rsquo;s issues, you have to deal with customer service.</p>
<p>Screw that.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, if the person has a cell phone, which increasingly is the case, I mean,</p>
<p>by the end of next year, more than five or six billion people depending on different</p>
<p>estimates will have smartphones basically by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking like the vast majority of humans will have access to smartphones.</p>
<p>They can all have sovereign Bitcoin wallets.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s even ways to access Bitcoin without the internet.</p>
<p>But I mean, we can get into that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like hardware wallets and so on.</p>
<p>What do you mean by sovereign Bitcoin wallet?</p>
<p>You know, most users today are using Bitcoin in a custodial manner.</p>
<p>So this is kind of like having a bank account where you have a deposit account at a bank,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So you have a claim, right?</p>
<p>You go to the bank and they have some of your money and you take it out, right?</p>
<p>With an ATM.</p>
<p>So what I would call noncustodial Bitcoin use would be similar to withdrawing cash from</p>
<p>an ATM.</p>
<p>You have it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bearer instrument.</p>
<p>OK, so when I&hellip;</p>
<p>Bearer instrument.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bearer instrument.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m outside this community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a bar of gold or a banknote or Bitcoin that you control, meaning you have the seed</p>
<p>phrase, right?</p>
<p>Which for the listeners essentially is 12 to 24 English words that you write down on</p>
<p>a piece of paper.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your like password to get into your Bitcoin account.</p>
<p>And that gives you that bearer instrument quality, right?</p>
<p>But unfortunately, most users still use Bitcoin in a custodial way, meaning they buy it on</p>
<p>Coinbase or Square or something like that.</p>
<p>You would put into the custodial into the custodial category like a bank.</p>
<p>And look, the good news is you can withdraw to your own control.</p>
<p>And in the Bitcoin community, we try to teach this idea that it&rsquo;s not your keys, not your</p>
<p>coins in the same way that if you deposit your money at the bank, you might not get</p>
<p>it back.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s low likelihood, but it&rsquo;s very possible.</p>
<p>Same thing in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Like if you want to get the full experience, you want to actually custody your own Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You want to put it whether it&rsquo;s on an open source software wallet, like the blue wallet</p>
<p>is a good one for people to check out or a hardware wallet like cold card, for example.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different ways to do this.</p>
<p>But essentially, like around the world, people are innovating.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t think so low of your fellow man.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like people are able to figure this out.</p>
<p>You know, I get a lot of flak from people saying, oh, Bitcoin is so hard to use.</p>
<p>I read this article in the New York Times saying this guy in Silicon Valley lost all</p>
<p>of his Bitcoin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because he was a moron and didn&rsquo;t care about it.</p>
<p>This guy lost all this Bitcoin because it wasn&rsquo;t worth much 10 years ago and he, you</p>
<p>know, he forgot the password.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re like receiving your remittance from a family member, you&rsquo;re going to lose</p>
<p>the password.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And you trust in the basic intelligence of people to figure this out and to innovate</p>
<p>and so on and figure out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re watching it, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m, it&rsquo;s kind of funny that, but people in the United States are not very savvy</p>
<p>with money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly the way you&rsquo;re describing is like when you have very little money, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be savvy with money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to understand exactly the mechanisms that work, that are resistant to the corruption</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s around you.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember sort of growing up in the Soviet Union, the general bureaucracy and</p>
<p>the corruption of everything around you, you figure out ways around that.</p>
<p>You figure out ways how to function within that kind of system to survive under inflation,</p>
<p>under hyperinflation, under all like basically being unable to trust any kind of, even the</p>
<p>police force and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>You figure it out and that same way, perhaps Bitcoin could be all the different ways to</p>
<p>store and gain Bitcoin.</p>
<p>These mechanisms could be something that&rsquo;s figured out in the third world as opposed</p>
<p>to in the United States.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, I would say the capital of Bitcoin could easily be Lagos and not San Francisco</p>
<p>in terms of users, in terms of people using it.</p>
<p>And again, the two use cases as a savings account and as an unstoppable payment rail.</p>
<p>These are the two ones that you should really think about, this is how people are using</p>
<p>it today.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to, could it possibly be adopted by like a sufficient majority of the</p>
<p>population?</p>
<p>I say, yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very similar to the way the mobile phone spread.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the cell phone was only for rich people, it was only for the elite,</p>
<p>it was huge, it didn&rsquo;t work very well, the interface sucked, it was clunky.</p>
<p>Over time, it got smaller and smaller and cheaper and cheaper and easier to use and</p>
<p>easier to use.</p>
<p>And today, everyone benefits.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to watch a similar technology upgrade process with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Already in the last 10 years, Bitcoin has gotten so much easier to use.</p>
<p>I mean, there are now mobile wallets that are so slick.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one called Moon M U U N wallet from a team in Argentina.</p>
<p>And these guys created it because they saw their own currency devalued like three times</p>
<p>in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve had a hell of a time trying to get their money back and forth in different</p>
<p>countries.</p>
<p>So they were like, let&rsquo;s make this easy for people.</p>
<p>Again, you know, this is the people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>This is something that cannot be controlled by governments or corporations.</p>
<p>And that makes it very powerful.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s actually quite exciting to be here in the adoption phase.</p>
<p>In the early days.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, this is the early days.</p>
<p>And you also mentioned that Bitcoin is the mechanism of a peaceful revolution.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a way to resist authoritarianism in a peaceful way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately, you know, you mentioned sort of politics, information, and money.</p>
<p>It seems like in the space of money, this is one of the peaceful mechanisms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to opt out.</p>
<p>You can opt out peacefully from the system.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s beautiful, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin is currently by far the most popular sort of dominant cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>That said, and I look forward to your letters, Bitcoin maximalists.</p>
<p>That said, you know, Internet Explorer was the most popular browser for quite a long</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And then other browsers came along that out competed it like Chrome, Firefox, People&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Checkout Brave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great browser.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s my favorite browser at this point.</p>
<p>Anyway, so why Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Why not another cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>If you look in the next 10, 20, 50, 100 years, do you think it&rsquo;s possible for another cryptocurrency</p>
<p>like Ethereum or something that it&rsquo;s not even here yet to overtake Bitcoin as a mechanism?</p>
<p>When you say overtake, what do you mean?</p>
<p>What do you mean overtake?</p>
<p>You mean number of users?</p>
<p>Do you mean a price per coin?</p>
<p>Yeah, the number of users, because we&rsquo;re talking about 1%, 2%.</p>
<p>And if we are serious about this being in the space of money as a way to give individuals</p>
<p>power, fight the centralized powers that use the money system and so on, how do we get</p>
<p>from 2% to 50%, right, to 60%, to 80%?</p>
<p>At that jump, is it obvious to you, not obvious, but do you think Bitcoin is the way to get</p>
<p>from 2% to 50% or are there going to be other cryptocurrencies that may emerge that get</p>
<p>us to 50%?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, Bitcoin is the innovation.</p>
<p>The innovation is in having the decentralized mint.</p>
<p>No one can change the monetary policy.</p>
<p>Everything else is downstream from there.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, the mean would be 21 million.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never going to be any more than 21 million.</p>
<p>Every other cryptocurrency either has an inflationary policy, meaning there&rsquo;s going to continue</p>
<p>to be more and more of it over time, or its monetary policy can be changed by a small</p>
<p>group of people.</p>
<p>This is vividly on display in Ethereum, which is like the second largest and second most</p>
<p>robust cryptocurrency, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to senior Ethereum engineers over the last couple of weeks trying to figure</p>
<p>out what is the monetary policy of Ethereum?</p>
<p>No one can tell me.</p>
<p>No one knows how much ETH is going to be minted in 2022 and 2023 after they shift to proof</p>
<p>of stake.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen estimates that range from 100,000 to 2 million.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, you&rsquo;re going to be trusting a small group of people to make</p>
<p>those decisions.</p>
<p>That is what we are escaping with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So all these other cryptocurrencies, they might have their use cases, virtually all</p>
<p>of them are not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important for people to know that if you take like the 4,500 cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>on CoinMarketCap, almost all of them are scams straight up.</p>
<p>Even the ones that have like noble intentions, I just don&rsquo;t think are going to add that much</p>
<p>value ultimately.</p>
<p>I think Bitcoin to me is the innovation and you know, that&rsquo;s because it has a monetary</p>
<p>policy and an issuance schedule that cannot be changed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what gets me so excited about it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s such an important tool for human rights.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting because when you grow from 2%, when you grow in the number of people</p>
<p>using it at the scale, they&rsquo;re using it, it&rsquo;s going to need to be resistant to governments</p>
<p>and institutions messing with it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to see what kind of cryptocurrency would be resistant to that.</p>
<p>Obviously Dogecoin is going to win.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, look, the number two cryptocurrency in the world, probably by like how useful</p>
<p>it is to people is Tether, which is totally centralized, has blacklists.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying there won&rsquo;t be like new digital assets that are lumped into this category</p>
<p>that have usage, but they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s not the same innovation as Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sort of building on this idea of like a Euro dollar, maybe like a dollar that</p>
<p>is minted outside of the control of the US Federal Reserve, right?</p>
<p>It would be a Euro dollar.</p>
<p>So stable coins are kind of like Euro dollars just minted by private actors in a way, right?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re still tied to the dollar.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pegged to the dollar.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not escaping the system.</p>
<p>Escaping the system is Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t reliant on the dollar.</p>
<p>We have our own, you know, full store value, medium of exchange, unit of account eventually.</p>
<p>And you know, the Bitcoin world will be denominated in different terms.</p>
<p>And I think everyone, everything else will be tied to it.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>It does feel currently like Bitcoin is like, like pirates or something like that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still like the central banks that are like the main navies of the, of the different</p>
<p>nations.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this, if you talk about scale.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be a moment if Bitcoin continues to grow in its impact, when governments</p>
<p>are going to seriously contend with, you know, what do we do with this?</p>
<p>Do you think about those moments?</p>
<p>Is Bitcoin, is the cryptocurrency world in general going to be able to withstand the</p>
<p>serious legal pushback from countries, from nations, especially authoritarian nations?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 12 years, okay?</p>
<p>More than 12 years since Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin and they haven&rsquo;t been able</p>
<p>to stop it.</p>
<p>They have tried.</p>
<p>They have tried a lot.</p>
<p>I wrote a long essay for Quillette on this, like, like why haven&rsquo;t governments been able</p>
<p>to stop Bitcoin?</p>
<p>And my thesis is essentially that there&rsquo;s been like this mix of different kinds of technical,</p>
<p>social and economic and political incentives and disincentives that make it very difficult.</p>
<p>And I think to me, the best way to think about it is that Bitcoin is like a Trojan horse.</p>
<p>So just to actually tell that story just a little bit, because I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to understand the classical mythology tale, I find this very interesting.</p>
<p>Of the actual Trojan horse?</p>
<p>Of the actual Trojan horse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which was told in the Aeneid actually by Virgil, right?</p>
<p>And the idea was the Greeks had been like trying to take the city of Troy for like a</p>
<p>decade at these like impregnable walls and they couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And Ulysses and the rest of the Greek army were like, we don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>So Minerva, the god of strategy and war, you know, kind of like they get this idea from</p>
<p>her, I guess, to actually try to use subterfuge and trickery to take over the city.</p>
<p>So the idea is to, and this was sort of hatched by Ulysses, right?</p>
<p>To put this horse together that would kind of be like a gift.</p>
<p>So the idea was the Greeks just like pretended to leave, right?</p>
<p>They deserted.</p>
<p>They left behind one soldier and this horse and the Trojans looked at it and they were</p>
<p>like, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>And they brought in the soldier and the soldier&rsquo;s like, look, they left.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so sorry for all of the desecration and blood spill.</p>
<p>This is their gift to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, honoring Minerva, you know, it&rsquo;s like this like, you know, trophy for</p>
<p>you guys.</p>
<p>And there were actually people inside Troy, Cassandra, a prophet, as well as Laocoon,</p>
<p>who was like a priest who said, no, no, no, this is obviously a trick.</p>
<p>This is obviously a trick.</p>
<p>But they were like dispatched and ignored because the horse was like, it was just like</p>
<p>so bad ass.</p>
<p>So the Trojans were like, I&rsquo;m bringing it in the city.</p>
<p>So they brought it in themselves.</p>
<p>No blood spilled at all.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, of course, what you realize is the horse was packed with Greek</p>
<p>soldiers and they come out and they let the army in, which was like hiding behind an island.</p>
<p>So this idea that like something could be so attractive that you really can&rsquo;t say no,</p>
<p>even if you know what&rsquo;s inside of it, is at play in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So like in Bitcoin has this number go up technology, right?</p>
<p>It is what we call it in sort of shorthand NGO, NGU, right?</p>
<p>But what people don&rsquo;t realize is that NGU is like the Trojan horse.</p>
<p>Inside the Trojan horse is FGU, Freedom Go Up technology.</p>
<p>So dictators and rogue regimes and corporations are going to buy, mine, tax, accumulate this</p>
<p>thing because it&rsquo;s the best performing financial asset in the world.</p>
<p>What they don&rsquo;t realize or they&rsquo;re going to have to ignore is that they&rsquo;re also aiding</p>
<p>and abetting this freedom technology, which allows individuals to be sovereign and eventually</p>
<p>erodes their power.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that rogue regimes and bad actors have already used and will continue</p>
<p>to use Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The thing is when you think about a North Korea or a Venezuela and that government instructs</p>
<p>some of its bureaucrats and cronies and officials to start stealing Bitcoin or accumulating</p>
<p>it or whatever for short term gain to get around sanctions and use it to buy dollars</p>
<p>or something like that, right?</p>
<p>Which they can&rsquo;t get normally.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>All those people who the regime has instructed to like figure this thing out and use it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all going to realize, oh my God, this is money the government doesn&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to spread like a virus.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So this is like the idea of the Trojan horse allegory, why I think it&rsquo;s so important and</p>
<p>powerful with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>All the people talking about Bitcoin today on TV, they don&rsquo;t care about freedom and privacy.</p>
<p>They just care about number go up.</p>
<p>But what they don&rsquo;t realize is what&rsquo;s concealed within.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very, very powerful to me.</p>
<p>So the people talking about Bitcoin on TV are maybe investor types.</p>
<p>Yeah, professional investors, corporations and soon governments.</p>
<p>I mean, you just had today this morning on CNBC, the leader of the Republican leader</p>
<p>of the House of Representatives, a congressman saying, like, we need to be pro Bitcoin as</p>
<p>a country.</p>
<p>And the other day, Peter Thiel had a very interesting comment where he was basically</p>
<p>like, let&rsquo;s not fall behind China in this race.</p>
<p>So you have influential people in our government, like sort of posturing for this, like, you</p>
<p>know, Bitcoin race that&rsquo;s going to happen in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to see this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to compete to stack Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So you believe the the thing that&rsquo;s shiny and sexy, like the Trojan horse, the number</p>
<p>go up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too hard to ignore.</p>
<p>And for it to do to define that a little further as meaning it does seem like the more people</p>
<p>get excited and start using Bitcoin, the more its value grows.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a good feedback loop.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a feedback loop.</p>
<p>And then the reason you&rsquo;re excited about it, especially is that F.G.</p>
<p>Freedom go up.</p>
<p>Freedom go up, which is it ultimately gives power to the individuals to so decentralize</p>
<p>the entire system.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, like when Tesla stacks Bitcoin, they&rsquo;re just doing that as self interest.</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s going to be a good inflation hedge.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>But what they maybe don&rsquo;t care about, don&rsquo;t realize or they don&rsquo;t need to care.</p>
<p>I mean, Bitcoin&rsquo;s power is it like co ops people into promoting a freedom tool, even</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t care about or even if they hate freedom, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So when Tesla stacks Bitcoin and the price goes up and more interest goes up and more</p>
<p>people around the world are like, wow, Bitcoin, then more people get involved again.</p>
<p>More adoption, more price, more developers, better user interface, more privacy tools,</p>
<p>more mining, more network security.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this like positive feedback loop that continues to grow and it will grow intensely</p>
<p>in the next decade as we go through the adoption cycle.</p>
<p>And the reason why I&rsquo;m so excited about this is the human rights world, again, to get back</p>
<p>to our previous conversation, is very hard to find people who have, you know, the empathy</p>
<p>or the altruism to actually make a difference abroad in places like China or Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>or North Korea.</p>
<p>People are very quick to just like, they&rsquo;ll just quickly toss off the pretty words that</p>
<p>they care about human rights as soon as profits come into play.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no alignment of incentives, right?</p>
<p>The reason why Bitcoin is so powerful is that it aligns the incentives.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, they can be as greedy as they want.</p>
<p>They are being forced to promote a freedom tool.</p>
<p>This I&rsquo;ve never seen before and it makes me, it gives me a lot of like excitement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very refreshing because we&rsquo;ve been laboring in the human rights space, you have to like</p>
<p>raise money and it&rsquo;s all like nonprofit work and you&rsquo;re like begging for people to make</p>
<p>a difference for you.</p>
<p>Here you have this like incredible asset which people will accumulate out of self preservation,</p>
<p>self interest and greed, and yet it will strengthen the power of the individual.</p>
<p>That is what we need to fight, big brother.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we need to fight, like what I&rsquo;m scared is happening in China, like this growing</p>
<p>authoritarian state which is powered by big data analysis.</p>
<p>This is our way to fight back and it runs on this like really interesting engine again</p>
<p>that like takes advantage of our base nature as humans and I know that it sounds terrible</p>
<p>for me to say this, but I mean, ultimately we are self interested and it is hard to get</p>
<p>people to care about others living a thousand miles away.</p>
<p>We are kind of localized in our empathy.</p>
<p>Being as someone who works to help people who live in like a hundred different countries,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to get Americans to care about what&rsquo;s happening in Belarus or in Kashmir.</p>
<p>It just is.</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to definitely care about Bitcoin because they want to see their net worth go</p>
<p>up, they want to do better for their family, et cetera.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to get into this thing and it&rsquo;s really going to like make that powerful tool</p>
<p>for everyone else who&rsquo;s using it.</p>
<p>So this interplay dynamic is fascinating to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have to, I&rsquo;m somebody who doesn&rsquo;t like the corrupting effects of greed, but</p>
<p>it is also human nature.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t like it either, but we have to be realists.</p>
<p>You have to acknowledge it and then maybe use it for your advantage.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just Bitcoin itself.</p>
<p>Like exchanges today are adopting something called lightning network, which is a way to</p>
<p>scale Bitcoin on a second layer.</p>
<p>Much like we had gold bars, which we scaled with paper money and then we had visa credit</p>
<p>cards, which were a way of scaling the paper notes, Bitcoin scales through lightning network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a private instant globally final settlement network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something you all should check out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very interesting.</p>
<p>The exchanges aren&rsquo;t adopting lightning for its privacy benefits.</p>
<p>Like lightning operates off the chain, meaning surveillance companies can&rsquo;t see, they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do chain analysis on lightning because it&rsquo;s on an onion routed second layer kind of that</p>
<p>works kind of like the Tor project.</p>
<p>The exchanges don&rsquo;t care about privacy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing it because it reduces fees.</p>
<p>Lightning is cheaper and faster.</p>
<p>So again, we have this really interesting alignment of incentives where like the freedom</p>
<p>tech is being promoted by people who don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what their incentives</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>I could care less if they were altruistic or not.</p>
<p>And I think this is, and you&rsquo;re going to maybe see this even in the future.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more things coming in Bitcoin down the pike.</p>
<p>Lightning was enabled by an upgrade called Segwit, right?</p>
<p>Which took place a few years ago, which was the culmination of the block size conflict.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another thing coming up called cross input signature aggregation, which may, if</p>
<p>it takes effect in the next few years, it may compel exchanges to collaboratively spend</p>
<p>all their Bitcoin together in a way that really protects our privacy and fights surveillance.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not going to do it for moral reasons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to do it because it&rsquo;s going to save them money and improve their bottom</p>
<p>line.</p>
<p>Can you speak to that kind of collaborative so that you can have multiple parties in a</p>
<p>single transaction kind of thing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you could do that today.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the CoinJoin, for example.</p>
<p>But right now it&rsquo;s more expensive to CoinJoin in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You have to pay a premium for your privacy.</p>
<p>This would flip that on its head and would basically say, if you have one transaction,</p>
<p>hey, pile them all in, have as many parties as you want.</p>
<p>The more parties you get in, the cheaper it&rsquo;s going to be per party.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not possible in Bitcoin today, but it might be in the future.</p>
<p>But again, the beauty in Bitcoin are these ways that it just aligns human incentives</p>
<p>and it aligns our most base desires and needs and realities with freedom and privacy.</p>
<p>That I&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>So somebody like Eric Weinstein actually spoke to this, the idea of blockchain in general.</p>
<p>From a 10,000 foot view, the blockchain is a centralized place to keep the record of</p>
<p>everything that ever happened and does that concern you from a privacy perspective, from</p>
<p>a control perspective, even though it&rsquo;s managed, especially given the low frequency of transaction</p>
<p>for Bitcoin, you can have a lot of small computers across the globe contain the entirety set</p>
<p>of transactions, all of those kinds of features.</p>
<p>Does that concern you that there&rsquo;s one place where everything is made public in terms of</p>
<p>everything that ever happened?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you two reasons.</p>
<p>Number one, the Bitcoin blockchain is ultimately a settlement layer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like something like Fedwire in the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way for like institutions to settle with each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think it&rsquo;s going to be like in 20, 30 years from now.</p>
<p>The average person is never going to touch the Bitcoin blockchain probably.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to use things like lightning or unfortunately, they may use Bitcoin banks,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll either use custodians or they&rsquo;ll use second layer noncustodial solutions to</p>
<p>interact.</p>
<p>The main chain is going to get very expensive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars or even more if the dollar</p>
<p>starts to weaken to make a transaction on the main chain.</p>
<p>And that will be reserved for like very large transactions or transactions that need final</p>
<p>final settlement, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s fine and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very important that that ledger, that settlement layer be kept by thousands</p>
<p>of people around the world.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin blockchain is not centralized.</p>
<p>It is decentralized.</p>
<p>It is run by people like me who run a node at home.</p>
<p>I run a personal server.</p>
<p>I run the Bitcoin blockchain, no one else.</p>
<p>You run it.</p>
<p>That person runs it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one in charge.</p>
<p>Well, you have a full node?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I run a full node.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great, man.</p>
<p>You run it and that way you can be sovereign over all of your usage, right?</p>
<p>And you can run it on a Raspberry Pi with less than 150 bucks of equipment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so important because again, there is no Amazon web service vulnerability here.</p>
<p>That is a problem.</p>
<p>And I agree with you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trending in a bad direction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, the government could just turn off a big important website or a news source.</p>
<p>Well, they can&rsquo;t turn off Bitcoin because it doesn&rsquo;t live on AWS, it lives with us.</p>
<p>We are Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s very, very powerful.</p>
<p>And then you can have something like a lightning network where you can escape some of the constraints</p>
<p>of the blockchain, depending on your needs of the privacy and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s an engineering trade off, but yeah, you can trade off some of the assurances</p>
<p>of the base layer to go into lightning, for example, and there you can get more speed</p>
<p>and more privacy.</p>
<p>And the things that Bitcoin lacks, speed and privacy, for example, you can get on these</p>
<p>second layers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all kinds of cool engineering things that people are coming up with.</p>
<p>But I also want to say anyone who says the blockchain, like that&rsquo;s a red flag for that</p>
<p>person doesn&rsquo;t really know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Like Satoshi didn&rsquo;t use the blockchain in the white paper.</p>
<p>Blockchain was a marketing term that people came up with later to try and do this thing</p>
<p>that was kind of like it peaked in 2015 and it continues to be an issue today of it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blockchain not Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And that was like a very corporate kind of social attack on Bitcoin to say we could take</p>
<p>this ledger part of this radical thing that&rsquo;s for criminals and all these bad people, but</p>
<p>we could take one part of it out and we could bring it over here and we could make it safe</p>
<p>for everybody.</p>
<p>The real McCoy&rsquo;s Bitcoin, I mean, Satoshi referred to it as the time chain.</p>
<p>I mean, really what they&rsquo;re talking about is just these blocks that are connected chronologically</p>
<p>of transactions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not that exciting.</p>
<p>The exciting part of Bitcoin is the proof of work where the transaction processing is</p>
<p>done by mining and by energy and by real world expenditures instead of like, you know, some</p>
<p>central ledger.</p>
<p>And you know, when you remove the blockchain from Bitcoin, it&rsquo;s not very, to me, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>not that interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, to me, blockchain or time chain, whatever, as it philosophically is a pretty</p>
<p>beautiful idea.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty simple, but it&rsquo;s nevertheless as beautiful from a big database person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting way to store information that, especially that&rsquo;s totally publicly accessible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I know that to Bitcoin proof of work is the fundamental idea, but to cryptocurrency</p>
<p>and digital money in general and to money, the blockchain is a really interesting idea</p>
<p>to me.</p>
<p>The way I think about it is it&rsquo;s kind of, you know, physics.</p>
<p>And I like that there&rsquo;s a place that you can rely on that&rsquo;s very difficult to mess with.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s not though, like it&rsquo;s outside of maybe Ethereum.</p>
<p>Every other blockchain is easy to mess with.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that proof of work is what makes it hard to mess with.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Proof of work is the key.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And Ethereum is about to leave proof of work.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about to go to proof of stake, which is literally the existing system where a small</p>
<p>group of people get to decide the monetary policy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Reputation has a lot of value there and that you could be, it could be manipulated.</p>
<p>I may sound brutal, but I&rsquo;m coming at it from a political science perspective.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s all about freedom versus dictatorship.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I find it so compelling that regardless of how much power or might or how</p>
<p>many armies you have, you can&rsquo;t change the rules of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wrong about Bitcoin, what would that look like?</p>
<p>What kind of thing that in 10, 20 years that you, you&rsquo;re not wrong.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t pan out.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t pan out, but other things that actually make you feel good about all the</p>
<p>hard work you&rsquo;ve done do pan out, something you haven&rsquo;t expected.</p>
<p>What might that be?</p>
<p>Well, as we&rsquo;ve talked about, my career started in human rights and in promoting individual</p>
<p>freedom and fighting authoritarianism.</p>
<p>That fight will continue on no matter what happens with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I think it would be a massive failure and a tragedy if this project like didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin project.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If the Bitcoin project didn&rsquo;t work, we would, it would, honestly, it&rsquo;s one of the only</p>
<p>things that gives me hope because it is an effective way to push back against the creeping</p>
<p>centralized control.</p>
<p>If for whatever reason, and I can&rsquo;t really see, one of the reasons I&rsquo;m so into it is</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really see how it&rsquo;s not going to work.</p>
<p>Again, I think the Trojan horse allegory is too powerful.</p>
<p>These big centralized actors are going to be too greedy and they&rsquo;re going to want some</p>
<p>as opposed to banning it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way easier for them to buy it than to ban it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>But if, but if whatever, for whatever reason it failed, I would have very little hope left</p>
<p>because really, I mean, the Chinese model of like centralizing all of your data and</p>
<p>controlling it, I mean, ultimately is, is a very, very powerful sort of like arch force.</p>
<p>And I would be concerned that that would be all of our, of our sort of destiny.</p>
<p>I do have to sort of push back at a style of communication and you, you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>it today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;re being exceptionally eloquent and arguing these ideas.</p>
<p>But me, especially just from studying history and being very skeptical from growing up in</p>
<p>the Soviet Union, I&rsquo;m very skeptical and cautious when I see a community of people being very</p>
<p>sure of an idea.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what that idea is.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a huge amount of certainty around Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Part of it is an important feature because you, it&rsquo;s number go up.</p>
<p>So far.</p>
<p>Number go up is a really important part of the mechanism to make sure that it, it grows</p>
<p>in impact, network effects, because I mean, it&rsquo;s really important to get excited about</p>
<p>idea for take hold, that&rsquo;s the way human nature works and so on.</p>
<p>But I also get, even something that you mentioned that, you know, others may not, you know,</p>
<p>if you mentioned blockchain, you&rsquo;re sensitive to the attacks that have been, that have been</p>
<p>mounted or the word blockchain have been used.</p>
<p>People have been fooled.</p>
<p>I mean, like people in the humanitarian sector have been fooled into thinking that some centralized</p>
<p>blockchain project is going to help some refugee all collapsed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge, it makes me sad that there&rsquo;s a huge number of scams.</p>
<p>Like you know what makes me really sad and just a tiny little tangent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been recently, I guess with the growing platform or something, there&rsquo;s been a bunch</p>
<p>of fake Lex Friedman accounts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And have a million, but not only do they do stupid stuff, but they&rsquo;ve been messaging people</p>
<p>like on LinkedIn and people write to me and they&rsquo;re saying like, I think it gets people.</p>
<p>I think they click on stuff.</p>
<p>I think they were not sure.</p>
<p>And it makes me think like, people are gullible or not gullible, but like, they&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>I am, which is they&rsquo;re like hopeful about the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re optimistic about the world, naive about the evil that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>This is what goes wrong with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>People fall for these like, I mean, like in these different countries, I&rsquo;m trying to like</p>
<p>talk to different people about Bitcoin and like the amount of like MLM schemes, pyramid</p>
<p>schemes, Ponzi schemes, there are just so many of them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s plenty here too.</p>
<p>But like in Zimbabwe, I was talking to this guy who is a reporter who studies the effects</p>
<p>like the foreign currency exchange markets.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just saying one of the main reasons people don&rsquo;t want to get into Bitcoin is because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been scammed so hard by all these other things.</p>
<p>So I would say that that&rsquo;s one way it could go wrong is that like people just continue</p>
<p>to be like afraid of it because of things that are like that in the past.</p>
<p>So that not, it&rsquo;s not just the volatility, it&rsquo;s just the, you know, yeah, having like</p>
<p>If you think it&rsquo;s a pyramid scheme, you&rsquo;re not going to want to get involved.</p>
<p>And in some sense, if I were to speak to the Bitcoin Maximus community is to maybe ease</p>
<p>up on the certainty because that gives me the signal that it&rsquo;s a scam, to be honest.</p>
<p>So whenever somebody, whenever there&rsquo;s a lot of people being cultishly excited about something,</p>
<p>I start being very skeptical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, I used to like Green Day before they became really popular.</p>
<p>And then the moment they became really popular, I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know, he started wearing</p>
<p>mascara and I was like, I don&rsquo;t like him anymore.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very skeptical about evangelists of an idea because I think Bitcoin on its own</p>
<p>is just a powerful idea that stands.</p>
<p>But I also understand that in a world of a lot of competing ideas where there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of scams and a lot of money to be made through those scams that you have to be, that you</p>
<p>have to be innovative in the kind of mechanisms you use to break through the scam, the ocean</p>
<p>of scams.</p>
<p>I took this personality test and I&rsquo;m a 99 skepticism.</p>
<p>So I was first, sadly, cause I was first introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and I was like, ah, whatever.</p>
<p>And it took me four years to actually get into it, to go down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really start to grasp it and start getting excited about it until 2017.</p>
<p>So I was regrettably very, very skeptical for a long time.</p>
<p>And I just thought it was like, whatever.</p>
<p>So I appreciate that.</p>
<p>And you should be skeptical.</p>
<p>But ultimately you got to believe in things like I believe in democracy, I believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for people.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s better than tyranny.</p>
<p>I believe in the internet.</p>
<p>I know that we&rsquo;ve had issues with centralization of the internet, but I still believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better to be connected than to have bridges between us.</p>
<p>And I believe in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s like a very similar progressive force that we&rsquo;re encountering.</p>
<p>But yeah, be skeptical, nothing will befall you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bad if you&rsquo;re like cautious and skeptical.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a good mentality to have.</p>
<p>One thing we haven&rsquo;t talked about all the violations of the human rights that authoritarian</p>
<p>regimes do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, not a positive, but there is a, you mentioned that nationalism is a drug.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something beautiful about loving your country, having pride in your country, loving</p>
<p>the, there&rsquo;s a feeling of belonging.</p>
<p>It could be country, it could be tribe, it could be family.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>And that speaks to human nature as well.</p>
<p>And that can sometimes overpower everything else.</p>
<p>Patriotism, and you know, sometimes it can be seen when you study history, when you look</p>
<p>at Stalinist, the Soviet Union, or you can even look at Hitler and Nazi Germany, we tend</p>
<p>to paint patriotism in a negative light.</p>
<p>And then maybe when we look at the United States, but even here in the United States,</p>
<p>people often paint patriotism in a bad light, you know, every time I say I love America,</p>
<p>also as an immigrant, I love this country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how that&rsquo;s taken as a political statement that, you know, people, I guess</p>
<p>on the right has been, have been more active in saying that they love the country and people</p>
<p>on the left have not sort of, it&rsquo;s almost become a weird slogan as opposed to a statement</p>
<p>of just love.</p>
<p>And I understand that patriotism can be a slippery slope into letting your government,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re saying, the value of freedom of speech is you hold your</p>
<p>government to account for all the ways they mess up.</p>
<p>I mean, look, you have patriotism and then you have jingoism, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important that we stay on the patriotic side.</p>
<p>Like as an American, I&rsquo;m very patriotic in terms of, I love the values that this country</p>
<p>was founded on if you read the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>And I love the fact that it was just flexible enough that we were able to change it to grant,</p>
<p>or at least to try to grant all people the same rights.</p>
<p>It was not the original plan of the founders, right?</p>
<p>It had to be changed.</p>
<p>But since then we&rsquo;ve remained, those laws have remained and they&rsquo;re very good.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very proud of that.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m not proud of is the jingoistic part of our country where we invade other countries</p>
<p>and bomb other countries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not proud of our prison system.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a huge stain on our nation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not proud of a lot of things.</p>
<p>So I think you can be patriotic, but you can be critical of your country.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s important, I feel like the jingoistic thing is the thing that we need to watch out</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just my own personal take.</p>
<p>Out of all the projects that the Human Rights Foundation works on, what&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>one to you right now?</p>
<p>Like what that&rsquo;s been occupying your mind?</p>
<p>Yeah, I just read again this New Yorker piece that just came out that you should read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Ghost Walls.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the story of how the Chinese Communist Party is committing genocide right now, just</p>
<p>like other regimes did and the Turks did to the Armenians and the Nazis did to the Jews.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s happening again right now.</p>
<p>We said never again, and you know, that&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re letting it happen.</p>
<p>And again, with the business stuff, like Airbnb is like a sponsor of the Olympics, like what?</p>
<p>At the individual level, at a business level, how does somebody like me, who&rsquo;s just one</p>
<p>little ant, how does somebody like Elon Musk, who is in charge of 10,000 ants, fight it?</p>
<p>How do we push back?</p>
<p>A great blueprint is the fight against the South African apartheid.</p>
<p>So we did a few events down in Johannesburg, and I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of being able to</p>
<p>go to the apartheid museum several times.</p>
<p>And it really does a good job of chronicling how they were able to do it.</p>
<p>It took a while, there&rsquo;s no doubt, but the way it was done was good.</p>
<p>Peaceful action from abroad was very important.</p>
<p>So there was like the Sullivan principles.</p>
<p>So like you can peacefully protest as a company, particular regimes, and it&rsquo;s very effective.</p>
<p>And not just corporations, but like the Olympics is a great example.</p>
<p>Like Chinese government should not be able to host the Olympics.</p>
<p>The IOC should say no, not until you close down those prison camps.</p>
<p>This is a perfect, peaceful way to push back.</p>
<p>No one gets hurt.</p>
<p>Same thing when we had the Korean Olympics a few years ago, North Korea should not have</p>
<p>been allowed any sort of symbolistic kind of hosting rights there.</p>
<p>They have prison camps, gulags that we can see from outer space very clearly.</p>
<p>And their regime is the cruelest one on the planet probably.</p>
<p>Why were they able to sit and cheer and get to sort of cohost the Olympics?</p>
<p>This is spineless.</p>
<p>Like the IOC, the Olympics, and major corporations should stand up, especially in the cultural</p>
<p>sector where you don&rsquo;t lose anything, or you shouldn&rsquo;t have to lose anything.</p>
<p>So I think if we look at the way that we forced the apartheid regime out, this international</p>
<p>solidarity of musicians, athletes, performers, celebrities is very, very powerful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, today&rsquo;s celebrities are doing the opposite.</p>
<p>We just had this press release go out yesterday about ACON, and he&rsquo;s off whitewashing the</p>
<p>crimes of the dictator of Uganda and trying to build a future city there with him.</p>
<p>If this was the 1980s, ACON would be raising his fist and saying, we need to fight the</p>
<p>apartheid regime.</p>
<p>How do we get back to that?</p>
<p>We need to think about that.</p>
<p>We have to figure out how to harness celebrities, influencers, and companies and get them to</p>
<p>actually stand up for something for once.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve really had a spine against that, and we&rsquo;ve lost it.</p>
<p>And you lose things.</p>
<p>You lose them forever.</p>
<p>Look at Tibet.</p>
<p>Tibet was a big cause for people in the 90s.</p>
<p>You used to go to colleges and kids would have the Tibetan flags all over the dorm rooms.</p>
<p>Go ahead, we&rsquo;d have Tibet on the stage, and everybody wanted to, you know, free Tibet</p>
<p>was a big thing.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>Like, we lost it for some reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a thing anymore, and Tibet has been totally colonized, you know?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s important that we find a way to unlock an interest in the celebrity classes</p>
<p>among athletes, singers, presidents.</p>
<p>You know, we need to find a way to punish these people.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s surprising because we&rsquo;ve become more and more connected so we can communicate</p>
<p>more effectively at a large scale, and yet we seem to be worse and worse at real activism.</p>
<p>It seems like the outrage that&rsquo;s overtaken the communication channels has been very US</p>
<p>focused and often more about outrage and less about productive activism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very jaded.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very difficult to do these things at scale effectively.</p>
<p>I do not believe we will be successful in boycotting the Chinese Olympics.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t in 2008.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, and they&rsquo;re much more evil now, and I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to do it this time.</p>
<p>And again, to go back to the Bitcoin piece, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m like very interested in this</p>
<p>thing because it doesn&rsquo;t require my altruism.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t require some famous singer or some corporation to sacrifice anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally just going to follow their own profits, seeking self interested motives,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to end up making a stronger human rights tool for other people.</p>
<p>Freedom go up.</p>
<p>FGU, man.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s kind of a dark question, but do you think we&rsquo;re headed towards a war</p>
<p>with China, the United States versus China?</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>In the cyberspace and potentially even a hot war.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s too many people with too much money to be lost to go to a hot war on both</p>
<p>sides, but eventually we&rsquo;re just going to, someone&rsquo;s going to have to stand up.</p>
<p>I mean, the subjugation of Hong Kong and the genocide of the Uyghurs and the colonization</p>
<p>of Tibet.</p>
<p>I mean, Taiwan is the next big thing.</p>
<p>I mean, Xi Jinping has made it very clear, you know, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to have to stand up for Taiwan for different reasons, both for moral reasons,</p>
<p>but also for semiconductor reasons.</p>
<p>We need TSMC to be on our side, not have China take over TSMC.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different reasons why we&rsquo;re going to have to protect Taiwan.</p>
<p>And you just hope it&rsquo;s not a hot war.</p>
<p>I mean, at this point, well, but also from inside the governments of China and Russia</p>
<p>as well, but China I guess is the powerhouse here, is how do these governments get reformed?</p>
<p>Is there a hope for them to become democracies, like true democracies, representative democracies</p>
<p>and sort of reform them to be ethical players on the world stage?</p>
<p>No empire lasts forever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s impossible to predict when these regimes fall.</p>
<p>I mean, no one thought the Soviet Union was going to fall when it fell.</p>
<p>Like that, like if you study like the news and the scholarship of the era, no one knew</p>
<p>that the Tunisian government was going to fall after Mohammed Bouazizi lit himself on</p>
<p>fire.</p>
<p>No one predicted that that would become what we now know as the Arab Spring, right?</p>
<p>These things are impossible to predict.</p>
<p>And one day the Chinese regime will fall.</p>
<p>I just, we don&rsquo;t know when.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know, but, and there&rsquo;s quite a few folks who talk about the fall of the American empire.</p>
<p>And it also concerns me that we don&rsquo;t know when that might fall.</p>
<p>You assume me as a very excited, naive American, I&rsquo;m very excited by this project that I think</p>
<p>is the beacon of hope in the world still, but that&rsquo;s probably how you feel before it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the end.</p>
<p>Yeah, the party, you want to leave the party before it starts to deteriorate.</p>
<p>I think America could continue to have like a major, major leadership role for a long,</p>
<p>long time.</p>
<p>I think certain things we do will become maybe no longer possible in terms of the way we</p>
<p>intimidate people on the world stage and especially the way we use our currency as a weapon.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s going to decline over time as we become more of a multipolar world.</p>
<p>But I do still believe in America and the values that were founded on despite all the</p>
<p>warts.</p>
<p>I believe in us and I would prefer us absolutely to be the most prominent of the multipolar</p>
<p>world vis a vis a regime like Russia or China.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been talking about states and nations, but can we just briefly talk about Facebook</p>
<p>and Twitter and companies that have a huge impact on the world as well.</p>
<p>And actually one of the things that make America a great nation is it is the place from which</p>
<p>these great companies have sprung up.</p>
<p>Is there, from a human rights perspective, is there something that bothers you about</p>
<p>Facebook about these large companies?</p>
<p>Is there something we need to fix?</p>
<p>Something we need to be upset about, fight back on, reform, do some sort of real activism</p>
<p>about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very concerned about social media platforms and companies.</p>
<p>It almost feels like we&rsquo;re losing the golden age of the internet.</p>
<p>You know, we could like go online and interact with each other and share and not be worried</p>
<p>about censorship.</p>
<p>It feels like that was a golden age, like in the late nineties, the two thousands, and</p>
<p>now everything is becoming very politicized.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure that there&rsquo;s a solution.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a button we can press to fix it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of afraid that this is sort of just what happens when societies digitize.</p>
<p>Like I think that certain opinions just become demonized in the room and then the social</p>
<p>room that we have on the internet.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a magical solution there.</p>
<p>I do know that there&rsquo;s technological solutions that will allow us to continue to communicate</p>
<p>and for creators to reach their audiences without censorship.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very exciting.</p>
<p>Like right now you could be deplatformed from your, you know, from like whether it&rsquo;s Patreon</p>
<p>or YouTube or whatever, and your bank account can be closed down, right?</p>
<p>There are emerging ways that Adam Curry, like the Podfather and a bunch of other people</p>
<p>are experimenting with, where you can essentially have your audio podcast across a whole bunch</p>
<p>of different, you know, platforms.</p>
<p>So you know, it&rsquo;s censorship resistant, and then your audience can pay you over lightning</p>
<p>in streaming money.</p>
<p>Like they can stream you money as they listen.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re removing the whole advertising piece.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do advertising anymore.</p>
<p>You have this direct relationship with your audience.</p>
<p>And this is possible with something like lightning where you can do streaming money that&rsquo;s censorship</p>
<p>resistant.</p>
<p>And a lot of the people who are building a lightning network, for example, Elizabeth</p>
<p>Stark who, you know, started Lightning Labs and has done within her company that people</p>
<p>that work with her have built a huge part of the lightning infrastructure, you know,</p>
<p>what animates her is this idea of like, again, artists and creators being able to have that</p>
<p>direct ability to reach out and have that peer to peer relationship with their audience.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m excited for that.</p>
<p>And I do think that&rsquo;s coming, but I am very worried that the golden age of like centralized</p>
<p>social media platforms is kind of behind us.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure how to fix that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s like a fixable problem.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I have a hope that it&rsquo;s a fixable problem.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fixable because there&rsquo;s demand for it to be fixed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I think about it.</p>
<p>Well, is Twitter that bad right now?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, it&rsquo;s fixable in as much as you can do a verification.</p>
<p>So you can give a blue check to someone and then that person is like more credible and</p>
<p>they go to the top of the comments and there&rsquo;s like tweaks you can do.</p>
<p>You can continue to improve it, but it&rsquo;s not going to fix the fact that like Twitter can</p>
<p>decide to kick off the president.</p>
<p>And like a lot of people are going to be upset by that, you know, like there&rsquo;s ways you can</p>
<p>improve the UX over time and they continue to do so.</p>
<p>Like Clubhouse is a lot of fun, great phenomenon.</p>
<p>So is Twitter spaces.</p>
<p>So they continue to iterate, but the censorship deplatforming piece, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s fixable</p>
<p>because if you, I mean, you watch the US government haul these people, haul Zuckerberg and Dorsey</p>
<p>and whatever in front of Congress, they want more censorship.</p>
<p>I mean, our elected leaders want more censorship, right?</p>
<p>See, I just believe censorship is a really harsh word.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s possible to create technologies where it&rsquo;s not Twitter doing the censorship,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s individuals doing their own selection of what they want and don&rsquo;t want to see.</p>
<p>So for example, if you get sick and tired of Donald Trump and whatever he says, or you</p>
<p>love Donald Trump, you get to select yourself.</p>
<p>Like you get to have more control over what you consume.</p>
<p>Twitter tries to do that a little bit, but they obviously fail where ideas infiltrate</p>
<p>our view that misinformation spreads really fast and conspiracy theories spread really</p>
<p>fast to where the immune system that Twitter has created to try to censor conspiracy theories</p>
<p>and misinformation is over firing and you&rsquo;re now censoring too many people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s exactly the same intuition as you said before.</p>
<p>If the state is doing it, in this case, Twitter is kind of the state that&rsquo;s not going to work</p>
<p>out well.</p>
<p>But if you give power to the individuals to do this sort of the, not even censorship,</p>
<p>but incentivization and deaccentivization of great thoughtful content and terrible low</p>
<p>effort content, then I feel like that&rsquo;s going to create a system where there&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be a much more open discourse of ideas, dangerous ideas, difficult ideas, controversial ideas,</p>
<p>and people in a decentralized way will be able to use their own intelligence to select</p>
<p>content to share content, spread content.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep it simple.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one example, Twitter and Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s quite clear that what he believes is the solution is as you&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of hinting at a more kind of like regionalized system, which is not have one we call federated</p>
<p>system, right?</p>
<p>Which does not just have like one company in charge of everything, but there&rsquo;s an open</p>
<p>protocol and then there&rsquo;s like different instances, right?</p>
<p>So Twitter may, you know, Jack&rsquo;s dream for Twitter is that Twitter is this open protocol</p>
<p>that the Russian government can use and the Chinese government can use and the Iranian</p>
<p>government can use and the American government can use and then Twitter as a company is going</p>
<p>to use too.</p>
<p>And you as the customer decide which implementation you want to join and there&rsquo;s going to be different</p>
<p>censorship on each instance or each federation, but the protocol itself would be like untouchable.</p>
<p>This is kind of like the idea behind the internet, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like different parts of the internet that are censored, but like at the very bottom</p>
<p>of the very bottom of the backbone of it, it&rsquo;s like this globally connected relatively</p>
<p>unstoppable thing, right?</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good vision and Twitter is working towards that with the blue</p>
<p>sky initiative.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little skeptical that it like works out because I&rsquo;ve used Mastodon, for example.</p>
<p>Mastodon is an example of a federated social media.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s ruled by a benevolent.</p>
<p>Each instance is ruled by a benevolent dictator.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like I happen to like this one, so I know.</p>
<p>So rather than trust one dictator, Twitter, you could choose which dictator you want to</p>
<p>trust and that&rsquo;s kind of the federated model and maybe we head that way, but you lose things.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s federated, you lose the UX, you lose the slickness and the feel and all the</p>
<p>millions of dollars they spend on developers.</p>
<p>Like Mastodon is like not anywhere close to as nice to use as Twitter.</p>
<p>So I feel like it&rsquo;s, again, it&rsquo;s this trade off that we make with everything where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>convenience, comfort, speed versus privacy and freedom, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to have something that gives you both.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think, I think, uh, yeah, it is a trade off.</p>
<p>Have you used one of these things that I feel like is good?</p>
<p>The federated, they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re not, but the federated, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good, I think, uh, it requires genius, it requires skill, it requires great design</p>
<p>to come up with a way to, you know, there&rsquo;s a Pareto front here, there&rsquo;s a right way to</p>
<p>hit that trade off.</p>
<p>And I honestly think there&rsquo;s the UX, the experience should be centralized, should be designed</p>
<p>by the company, but the data and like a lot of stuff that could be used to violate your</p>
<p>basic rights should be owned by the individual.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a way to decouple those, like create an incredible experience to where</p>
<p>you go there and you enjoy the market where you can share your data and have complete</p>
<p>control over it and always have, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of basic UX ideas, like just as an example,</p>
<p>I think there should always be in everything you design, a one button that&rsquo;s always there</p>
<p>that says, forget I ever existed, delete everything you know about me.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s, maybe it&rsquo;s one button that you click and it asks, are you sure?</p>
<p>And you have to be able to say yes.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a feature that&rsquo;s fundamental to a good social network, I believe.</p>
<p>Like currently social networks, first of all, most of them don&rsquo;t allow you to do that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t make it transparent how much data they had, who they shared it with.</p>
<p>And they also make it exceptionally difficult to delete accounts.</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s a very basic starting point, but that having that button means that you</p>
<p>have control, but that&rsquo;s step one of the control.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a transparency of knowing exactly when, what data is being shared about you,</p>
<p>how much data is already being recorded about you, all that is transparency.</p>
<p>And I believe in the, I believe that&rsquo;s a really good business model, because when there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>transparency and control, people would be willing to give over a lot more data as long</p>
<p>as they know what they&rsquo;re given over, as long as they know what they can delete.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess maybe you&rsquo;re more optimistic about people caring about, I feel like not so few</p>
<p>people actually care about their privacy and freedom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just watched everybody give it up, you know, but we&rsquo;ll see, I guess just to book</p>
<p>in that I think we&rsquo;re at this moment where obviously the centralized platforms are just</p>
<p>so much easier and better to use and to strike it out and, you know, adventure out and use</p>
<p>a like a federated instance or something even like Keybase, which is kind of like a cool</p>
<p>encrypted way to like have group chats.</p>
<p>It just requires like a lot of your time and a lot of people don&rsquo;t have that time.</p>
<p>But I will say one thing, like I do think there is this future where we do go into more</p>
<p>of this like, it&rsquo;s called a tribal model or like tribes, which is this social environment</p>
<p>being built on top of lightning by an app called Sphinx.</p>
<p>And the idea is like kind of like it&rsquo;s like a decentralized Slack, like you have your</p>
<p>Slack instance, which has like a bunch of people in the community and you have different</p>
<p>ways to message each other and it&rsquo;s all encrypted.</p>
<p>And then it has like plugins for like things like Jitsi instead of Zoom.</p>
<p>So like an open source encrypted video messenger.</p>
<p>It has ways to like plug in the content you want to get from like different platforms</p>
<p>that you follow, like podcasts, things like that.</p>
<p>And again, it allows you to pay those people directly in a censorship resistant private</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really nice to connect to the lightning network.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all sort of built on lightning, but the idea you can think about it as like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>slowly starting to build up the idea of a WeChat, but with freedom principles.</p>
<p>Because right now, WeChat&rsquo;s like the king of convenience and comfort, but of course</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s feeding all that data to the big brother and the surveillance state.</p>
<p>And then we have like our own versions over here in America that are not quite as convenient</p>
<p>or amazing, but like we give up slightly less privacy and freedom.</p>
<p>But this thing has a lot of promising features to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth checking out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very like early days.</p>
<p>Like it feels like, I mean, I was pretty young, but it feels like the nineties in the internet.</p>
<p>Like it has that feeling where you, yeah, you know it&rsquo;s rough around the edges, but</p>
<p>you can feel the magic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much like with Steve Jobs on this.</p>
<p>I think the founding principles are exceptionally important, but at the end of the day, the</p>
<p>design of how sleek it is, how easy it is to use.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not just like pretty icing on the cake.</p>
<p>That is the icing is the cake because like how easy it is to use, how natural it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Trojan horse thing.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t get, it has to be pretty and shiny and it has to have, it has to fundamentally</p>
<p>connect to the basics of human nature, which is what is pleasant to use, what feels good</p>
<p>to use.</p>
<p>You have to, you know, to trick people into eating the broccoli, you have to put like</p>
<p>a delicious whatever on it.</p>
<p>Well, again, PGP is a kind of a pain to use, right?</p>
<p>For if you want privacy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So Signal is an upgrade.</p>
<p>Signal is way better.</p>
<p>I mean, and it&rsquo;s way better than it was five years ago and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not quite as good</p>
<p>as like not quite as seamless, right, as like a WhatsApp yet, but it&rsquo;s almost there.</p>
<p>And they were able to do it and you&rsquo;re going to see that with, with Bitcoin wallets as</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re almost there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, if you use like a moon wallet is like, I mean, it&rsquo;s so cool looking and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so seamless and they&rsquo;ve spent so many hours thinking about your experience.</p>
<p>We are getting there.</p>
<p>Whereas 10 years ago, it was like impossible to use.</p>
<p>One of the things that Signal doesn&rsquo;t have, and I believe these kinds of applications</p>
<p>need to have is like a, I hate the term, but killer app, which is like a dumb, but very</p>
<p>viral and popular reason to switch it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see exactly, I mean, I&rsquo;ve been using Signal, but I haven&rsquo;t seen a you know, a big</p>
<p>reason to, to switch.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re on it, man.</p>
<p>To switch.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason.</p>
<p>But I haven&rsquo;t switched everything to it, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like a.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The exodus to Signal was in, in January, they had a huge user surge for two main reasons.</p>
<p>One hilariously enough, of course, was Elon tweeted, like you should use Signal, right?</p>
<p>Which is not insignificant.</p>
<p>And then the other one was that like WhatsApp changed kind of some of its terms of service</p>
<p>and like, you know, announced to all of its users in this little pop up that it was going</p>
<p>to be sort of like changing the way it handled your data.</p>
<p>That spooked a lot of people.</p>
<p>So these two things really combined and tens of millions of people in the following weeks</p>
<p>between January and February joined Signal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it really has had its day in the sun and they are like frantically trying to</p>
<p>keep up with it.</p>
<p>Like, and it&rsquo;s really nice to see that, that, that this encrypted messaging service, which,</p>
<p>which prioritizes your privacy in a way that, you know, you know, the government again may</p>
<p>know like the metadata, but doesn&rsquo;t know exactly what you&rsquo;re saying unless they can get your</p>
<p>hands on your phone.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very, very powerful.</p>
<p>So it can be done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be too jaded here.</p>
<p>I think it can be done.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I think we can fight back and I think we can make, continue to make these digital communications</p>
<p>tools and platforms in a way that, that, that really benefits us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not sure, but I&rsquo;m hopeful as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful that if you look at the trend of technologies, they ultimately are ones</p>
<p>that respect privacy, respect security and basic human rights.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s at least the hope.</p>
<p>So Gary Kasparov, I&rsquo;m Russian.</p>
<p>He means a lot to me on a personal level.</p>
<p>He is the chairman of a human rights foundation.</p>
<p>What does Gary have to do with anything?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your relationship like with him?</p>
<p>Do you like chess?</p>
<p>What are his specific focuses and ideas around the HRF?</p>
<p>Can you just speak to it in general?</p>
<p>Yeah, so our chairman at the human rights foundation was V√°clav Havel, who of course</p>
<p>was like the famous Czech democracy activist who, you know, helped lead the Velvet Revolution</p>
<p>and then ended up becoming the first democratically elected leader of the Czech Republic after</p>
<p>the Soviet Union fell.</p>
<p>He passed away in 2011 and it was very difficult to find a replacement because who can fill</p>
<p>Havel&rsquo;s shoes, you know?</p>
<p>But if one could, it would be Gary, right?</p>
<p>So we like really tried to get Gary to join and thankfully he agreed and we&rsquo;ve had an</p>
<p>amazing relationship with Gary over the years.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s been relentless in his pursuit of freedom.</p>
<p>I mean, he could have retired and taken his career in a different direction and he could</p>
<p>be hanging out with Putin and have a pleasure yacht and all kinds of stuff, but he decided</p>
<p>to risk it.</p>
<p>And if you actually study like the times when he was running for president in Russia, Amash</p>
<p>Gessen followed him around in The Man Without a Face, it&rsquo;s a great, great book about Putin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fabulous chapter where she&rsquo;s following around Gary when he&rsquo;s campaigning and I mean,</p>
<p>he risked a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, he can&rsquo;t go back to Russia anymore, he gave up his country, he&rsquo;s given up a huge</p>
<p>amount to be able to speak his mind and to have this dream, this beautiful vision of</p>
<p>a free and democratic Russia, he really believes in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a great experience, I work very closely with Gary, we talk a lot, we do different</p>
<p>things around the world together.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s come out to a lot of events in different cities around the world.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been a very active chairman, this isn&rsquo;t some figurehead, he&rsquo;s very involved</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really, really great.</p>
<p>I mean, everything he&rsquo;s involved with is, as one journalist who attends our events says,</p>
<p>when he walks in the room, the average IQ of the room goes up pretty significantly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big chess person, unfortunately, so I have not been able to connect with him</p>
<p>on that, but I think he probably would prefer it that way.</p>
<p>All he gets is people who want to talk to him about chess.</p>
<p>So here we can talk about human rights strategy and how to improve our fight against dictators.</p>
<p>But he really has that moral clarity that I really appreciate.</p>
<p>Yeah, he has a lot of fascinating ideas about artificial intelligence as well.</p>
<p>Please open my eyes a little bit to the state of Russia today, because I&rsquo;ve read most books</p>
<p>on Putin in the English language, in sort of trying to understand things.</p>
<p>And I try to look at it from a historical perspective, almost like we&rsquo;re living a hundred</p>
<p>years from now, and I look at Putin as an important figure in the history of human civilization</p>
<p>and study it in that way.</p>
<p>I think the way Gary looks at it, he probably doesn&rsquo;t appreciate me looking at the way I</p>
<p>do, but the way he looks at it is we can still change the direction of Russia, and we individual</p>
<p>human beings and we communities and we nations can take actions, have policies that can change</p>
<p>the direction of Russia.</p>
<p>To me, I take a sort of going to the library, passive view of studying fascinating aspects</p>
<p>of Russia.</p>
<p>To me, Russia means like most of my family suffered through the Soviet Union, and I see</p>
<p>beauty in suffering, the poetry, the music, the stories, and just there&rsquo;s so much love</p>
<p>that emerged from the pain that I just enjoy the music of that.</p>
<p>But to Gary and to many activists that I speak to, to them, they love not just the Russia</p>
<p>of the past.</p>
<p>They have a vision and a hope for Russia of the future.</p>
<p>And they criticize me a little bit for being a little bit too scholarly about the past</p>
<p>and ignoring the future, and there&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>So he opens my eyes to look to the future of Russia.</p>
<p>Gary and a handful of other Russian activists that we work closely with, including Vladimir</p>
<p>Karamurza, who again, I mean, it&rsquo;s just incredibly heroic, the man has survived two poisonings</p>
<p>by Putin.</p>
<p>They like to say that, you know, Russians will bring democracy to Russia on their own</p>
<p>terms.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need our help.</p>
<p>This is what Vladimir especially says.</p>
<p>But what he does say is that we should stop propping up Putin.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s kind of his, stop kind of legitimizing him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of his argument.</p>
<p>Is like, we don&rsquo;t need your foreign interference.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need your ideas.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, you know, we don&rsquo;t need your help.</p>
<p>We can do it on our own, but please stop like propping up our, you know, illegitimate ruler.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like his point of view, which I think is interesting and fair.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me just say on one unrelated comment, some people criticize me and others like Joe</p>
<p>Rogan for giving people a platform.</p>
<p>I think in some cases that&rsquo;s applicable, but I think in most cases, knowledge is power</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no such thing as giving a platform.</p>
<p>The conversation just shines a light as long as you shine the light well.</p>
<p>And as long as in shining the light and having the conversation, you reveal something fundamental</p>
<p>about the state of things, about the people, whether that&rsquo;s Putin or some of the other</p>
<p>controversial figures that have come up in a possible future conversation.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like this kind of platforming idea.</p>
<p>I think conversations save us.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t destroy us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s journalism though.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s very different from, you know, advocacy or strategic thinking about what</p>
<p>to do with Russia.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We should interview everybody and everybody should know exactly what they&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think, you know, journalism to me has become a dirty word because, because it&rsquo;s done so</p>
<p>poorly by so many people that, you know, I listened to sometimes certain programs, like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like, uh, meet the press and the Fox Sunday program, just certain things</p>
<p>just to tune in and see what different news medias are paying attention to.</p>
<p>And the kind of interviews they do, you know, is like five minutes at most, but usually</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one minute it&rsquo;s these quick clip things and it&rsquo;s very gotcha and they&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>for ways to sort of grab almost a misstatement.</p>
<p>They want to catch you off guard.</p>
<p>They want to ask the quote, like, like the harsh question, but without any of the, like</p>
<p>the dance of conversation that reveals the truth, you know, you can&rsquo;t just get to the</p>
<p>truth by asking it.</p>
<p>You have to sneak up on it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an art form.</p>
<p>And I think that art form involves long form conversation.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a huge believer in just, I guess that&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s called, I don&rsquo;t know, in depth</p>
<p>journal or whatever, like where you spend months or years on a story in that same way.</p>
<p>I think of long form conversation is like you spend many hours and you spend months</p>
<p>and years preparing for those many hours, but like, it&rsquo;s not this like short form trying</p>
<p>to, trying to get the most controversial little tidbit of a story out.</p>
<p>And unfortunately the funding mechanisms behind journalism are such that they are incentivized</p>
<p>clickbait journalism versus like in depth long form digging for the truth.</p>
<p>I have a conflicted relationship with journalism because to me, press freedom is so core and</p>
<p>independent journalists around the world are so brave, especially in countries like Russia</p>
<p>or China, et cetera.</p>
<p>And really good journalism is still something I absolutely, I love and I enjoy.</p>
<p>Like this, especially like to say again, this New Yorker piece on what&rsquo;s happening to the</p>
<p>Uyghurs is incredibly well reported.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, you have this sort of clickbaity journalism that&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>sensationalism and that gets used as a tool.</p>
<p>I mean, whether it be against things like privacy or Bitcoin or whatever, you have like</p>
<p>people who sensationalize and it gets used in the service of the surveillance state,</p>
<p>the war on terror or whatever.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s difficult, but you know, I think journalism is essential to a free society.</p>
<p>But it can sometimes be, it can wear my patience thin sometimes.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s been, to be honest, it&rsquo;s been a huge burden on me personally, if I were to</p>
<p>just turn this into a therapy session for a brief moment.</p>
<p>When I look at people, when I interact with people, I&rsquo;d like to see the best in them.</p>
<p>And the burden that weighs heavy on me is sometimes people I talk to may not be good</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d love to, I believe everybody has good in them and I try to focus on that.</p>
<p>The burden that weighs on me is sometimes that there may be conversations where that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>irresponsible, where I have to also call people out.</p>
<p>I have to do enough of the hard lifting and the hard work of knowing exactly what are</p>
<p>the bad things that that person has done.</p>
<p>And I also have the responsibility to call them out on it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s for me personally, just an unpleasant feeling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where speaking to journalism, like I think journalists are too much focused on</p>
<p>the bad things a person has done and not enough on the digging into the full complexity of</p>
<p>the human being behind all the things that have been done.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you know, I can&rsquo;t have a conversation with Hitler and not ask about</p>
<p>the prison camps.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So from the human rights perspective, one of our programs is we like, we try to go after</p>
<p>people who do like PR for dictators.</p>
<p>So like, like then a lot of people do like PR firms in Washington get hired by all these</p>
<p>dictators and make a lot of money to make them look good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called whitewashing or putting lipstick on a pig or whatever you want to do.</p>
<p>Astroturfing is like the fake, make like fake social media accounts to make it seem like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re popular.</p>
<p>But whitewashing is a huge issue.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s completely fair to interview like dictators and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Amanpour does a pretty good job.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>She makes sure that there&rsquo;s no messing around.</p>
<p>I mean, her interviews of Museveni recently, the Ugandan dictator was very good.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s basically like, well, like, well, why are you rigging another election?</p>
<p>Please tell us, you know, and she&rsquo;s fearless and she&rsquo;s good and that can be a helpful thing</p>
<p>to have on YouTube as a resource.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s quite clear when, when it descends into a PR session and you just</p>
<p>have to be like very careful about it.</p>
<p>Like Asma al Assad, the wife of the butcher in Syria, you know, was like profiled by Vogue</p>
<p>and it was this whole rose in the desert things, a bunch of nonsense, terrible, terrible, terrible,</p>
<p>total propaganda.</p>
<p>But a like honest interview where you, you know, you&rsquo;re asking about all the tough questions.</p>
<p>Very important.</p>
<p>You know, so I think, I think it&rsquo;s just a matter of like content.</p>
<p>Is this, is there a good resource to study whitewashing?</p>
<p>Like to know what manipulative PR looks like?</p>
<p>I think you just, you should know if you&rsquo;ve researched the topic, you should know it inside</p>
<p>you because it would be, is there anything you&rsquo;re afraid to ask?</p>
<p>That would be it.</p>
<p>Make sure you&rsquo;re asking all the questions.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re asking all the questions that you have, you&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re afraid to ask, then, then maybe you&rsquo;re self censoring,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it takes us back to that, like what is it that litmus test about is your country</p>
<p>a lot to have a gay pride parade?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like obvious things that might be on your mind that you just want to ask</p>
<p>and you shouldn&rsquo;t, you shouldn&rsquo;t run from them.</p>
<p>As long as you feel like you&rsquo;re a free person when you&rsquo;re interviewing, I think you&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully put.</p>
<p>Are there books, technical fiction, philosophical that had an impact on your life that you recommend</p>
<p>or even resources like blogs, films?</p>
<p>I have four books I&rsquo;ll briefly mention.</p>
<p>Number one is The Fear.</p>
<p>The Fear had a deep impact on me.</p>
<p>The Fear was written by Peter Godwin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the systematic dismantling of Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe.</p>
<p>Peter is Zimbabwean and it is a riveting book.</p>
<p>I think everyone should read it because it helps you understand what it&rsquo;s like to go</p>
<p>through not just authoritarianism, but also hyperinflation.</p>
<p>And I mean, really, you know, at the end of the day, what The Fear describes is how Mugabe</p>
<p>took this country in the 1980s and he actually brought it back in time to the 1920s in terms</p>
<p>of infrastructure, literacy rates, health rates, all these things.</p>
<p>He stole so much from the people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a heartbreaking book, but it&rsquo;s a very important book.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a way to do excellent, excellent journalism.</p>
<p>So The Fear is a good one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a personal story?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because he was, it&rsquo;s part of his whole family story and he&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s interviewing people personally.</p>
<p>So I would say that one.</p>
<p>Is it also connected, sorry to interrupt, is it, from the inflation perspective, is</p>
<p>it a good study of hyperinflation and the effects?</p>
<p>Does Bitcoin at all come as a discussion of money?</p>
<p>Does that come into the, or is it purely the experience of inflation is almost a symptom</p>
<p>of an authoritarian government?</p>
<p>A little bit, a little bit.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s not deep.</p>
<p>I have another book on that, which I&rsquo;ll recommend in a second, but I would just say that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very powerfully written book about how society can basically deteriorate and how you can</p>
<p>lose everything.</p>
<p>The second book is, I just mentioned it, but The Man Without a Face by Masha Gessen.</p>
<p>Incredible book about modern Russia and Putin.</p>
<p>Just a masterpiece.</p>
<p>So that one is.</p>
<p>Could be one of your favorite books about Putin and Russia.</p>
<p>That one&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s just so fearless.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>She interviews Putin in the book at the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>The third one is a fiction book called The Mandibles written by Lionel Shriver.</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good gift book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s witty, but it&rsquo;s about the United States losing its status as the reserve currency</p>
<p>and going into hyperinflation.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is that the characters in the book map where we are today.</p>
<p>The book itself is about the late, I think it&rsquo;s the late 2020s.</p>
<p>And we have a populist president who decides to announce that the United States is like</p>
<p>basically going to default on its debts.</p>
<p>And the rest of the world comes up with like a new currency and everybody switches to that</p>
<p>one and the dollar like overnight becomes worthless.</p>
<p>And all these like economists are saying, no, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Like inflation won&rsquo;t be a problem.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this one character who&rsquo;s an economist who&rsquo;s like an economist.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s basically he gets to the point where he&rsquo;s living as a refugee in Prospect Park</p>
<p>in Brooklyn and he&rsquo;s still saying everything&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You know, so it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s dry, it&rsquo;s witty, but it&rsquo;s also about the surveillance state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about centralization of power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>So The Mandibles, I would highly recommend.</p>
<p>So those three books.</p>
<p>And then on the topic of Bitcoin, because we talked about it a lot, I would just say</p>
<p>that my portal into Bitcoin was The Internet of Money by Andreas Antonopoulos and I did</p>
<p>it by audio book.</p>
<p>And I just think this is an important one for people to start with because he goes through</p>
<p>all the main concepts, whether it be proof of work or how the network functions.</p>
<p>But he does it in a way that&rsquo;s extremely engaging and really fascinating.</p>
<p>And it really just kind of like sparked my curiosity.</p>
<p>Is it discussing the technical sides or also the philosophical?</p>
<p>Because a lot of people mentioned sort of the Bitcoin standard is the philosophical</p>
<p>entry into the whole Bitcoin world.</p>
<p>Very different from the Bitcoin standard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more for like the average person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a history book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a collection of his talks that he gave over like two or three years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very technical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very approachable.</p>
<p>And some of it might be dated now because it&rsquo;s like 2015, 2016.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s great to hear a shout out for Andreas because he seems to be one of</p>
<p>the seminal figures to sort of make Bitcoin ideas accessible.</p>
<p>Andreas is the goat.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people will have issues with some of his like more recent work, but Andreas</p>
<p>is the goat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny to watch the Bitcoin maximalist immune system also attacking him.</p>
<p>And this whole feedback mechanism is working together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Well, I probably consider myself a maximalist, but I really like Andreas.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s room for nuance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s room for nuance in this world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to hear that.</p>
<p>If people are fascinated by your work, what is the way to get more of Alex?</p>
<p>So two years ago, I came together with seven other people from around the world and we</p>
<p>wrote a book in a book sprint.</p>
<p>We lived in a house for four days.</p>
<p>We wrote a book together.</p>
<p>It was really cool.</p>
<p>It was like a design sprint, but we did it in book format.</p>
<p>And my coauthors are from Nigeria, Venezuela, the Philippines, from former Soviet Union,</p>
<p>from all over.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s called The Little Bitcoin Book, and I&rsquo;m still proud of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hundred pages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something you give to somebody who knows nothing about the topic.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a technical book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the sort of social political aspect of it.</p>
<p>Like why is it important for you, for your finances, for your freedom, for your future?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve translated it into like a lot of languages by now.</p>
<p>I think English, Spanish and Portuguese are for sale and littlebitcoinbook.com, you know,</p>
<p>you go buy it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made it as a free PDF in Mandarin, Hindi, Punjab, Korean, Uyghur, which I was really</p>
<p>excited about, Arabic, Farsi.</p>
<p>And I mean, it spreads, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been really, really cool.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m proud of that.</p>
<p>I also made a video that did very well for Reason magazine called Why is Bitcoin Protecting</p>
<p>Human Rights Around the World?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s five minutes.</p>
<p>And it just, I feel like I tried to boil everything that I want to tell you into this five minute</p>
<p>video.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>I would recommend that.</p>
<p>And then if you&rsquo;re interested in the why have governments not stopped it, which I think</p>
<p>is really intriguing, I wrote this long essay in Quillette in February called, you know,</p>
<p>why haven&rsquo;t governments banned Bitcoin?</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;ll be a helpful guide to some folks.</p>
<p>Is this speaking to the Trojan horse idea that there&rsquo;s something enticing about it?</p>
<p>Yeah, at the end, it does get into that.</p>
<p>But it really also just kind of goes through technically, why is it hard to do a 51% attack?</p>
<p>Like if a government wanted to, could it really get all that equipment?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a semiconductor shortage, like it can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like certain things that stop governments from doing it.</p>
<p>And same thing with like this idea of a 6102, which would be based on the idea of the executive</p>
<p>order 6102, which is from 1933 when FDR made holding gold illegal in the United States.</p>
<p>The idea is that like banks would go around now with governments and try to like steal</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Well, in Bitcoin we have like a practice called proof of keys day every January 3rd, you know,</p>
<p>which is coinciding with the launch of the Bitcoin blockchain, where we all like withdraw</p>
<p>our keys from exchanges and we&rsquo;d be sovereign users.</p>
<p>What we are doing is we are preparing for a 6102 attack, which will one day probably</p>
<p>come, right?</p>
<p>So the essay just goes through all of the like possible attacks and it runs through</p>
<p>like the ones that happened, like the Chinese and Indian governments, the two largest governments</p>
<p>in the world, both tried to attack Bitcoin by banning their citizens from exchanging</p>
<p>fiat for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Interest instead exploded.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Barbra Streisand effect where, you know, by making something public and saying</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t do X, it actually increases attention about X a lot more, right?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting game theory there that people would enjoy.</p>
<p>Do you think, are you seriously concerned about this kind of thing where the idea is</p>
<p>a sovereignty and that Bitcoin espouses would actually one day be tested?</p>
<p>Do you have like a legitimate concern because you said like one day very well might.</p>
<p>Do you think it might go down?</p>
<p>First of all, Bitcoin has been attacked again, many times and we talk about the, you spoke</p>
<p>about this with Nick Carter on your show, the sort of protocol wars or conflict or whatever,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And Bitcoin almost died a whole bunch of times during that and ended up surviving.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t know how bad the blocks at that point was.</p>
<p>Oh it got really bad.</p>
<p>It was, it was a sort of a very existential threat and Bitcoin survived and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so intrigued by it is that it basically survived an attack in an environment several</p>
<p>years ago when Bitcoin was much more vulnerable than it is today.</p>
<p>It survived an attack by a conglomeration of Chinese billionaires, Silicon Valley corporations</p>
<p>and a ton of people who owned the majority of the hash rate and all this infrastructure.</p>
<p>They had 83% of all the hash rate and they couldn&rsquo;t get what they wanted and that was</p>
<p>so intriguing to me.</p>
<p>Like why didn&rsquo;t it, why didn&rsquo;t it get killed?</p>
<p>So as Nick said, I think you should read The Block Size War, which is a book on that you</p>
<p>can get on Amazon by Jonathan Beer.</p>
<p>Really good, kind of like really important to understand the, the, the, the scaling conflict</p>
<p>and the visions over the different visions of what Bitcoin should be.</p>
<p>And you know, again, people like me believe it should be a freedom tool, not like a payments</p>
<p>technology for retail.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m glad it worked out the way it did because it almost didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Do you think a human&rsquo;s civilization will destroy itself?</p>
<p>So if we think about all the threats facing human civilization, nuclear war, natural or</p>
<p>engineer pandemics, you know, we talk about human rights violations.</p>
<p>We talk about authoritarian governments taking control of the money supply, but do you have</p>
<p>grander concerns for the future of human civilization?</p>
<p>Do you have hope for us becoming a multi planetary species?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I, I guess longterm we&rsquo;d want to decentralize, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want a single point of failure in the earth is a single point of failure.</p>
<p>But no, I mean, you look at all this kind of like space fiction and I mean, who would</p>
<p>want to live on Mars, man?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fricking desert.</p>
<p>I mean, the earth is so beautiful.</p>
<p>I hope we can save it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just so gorgeous when you look at the earth compared to any other like exoplanet</p>
<p>or whatever you look at it, I mean, the earth is so spectacular and wondrous and singular.</p>
<p>I think we got to do everything we can to save it here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people would have said that about Europe before the explorers</p>
<p>ventured out Columbus and the rest out into the unknown.</p>
<p>The thing about human nature is that we are explorers too.</p>
<p>We are.</p>
<p>Some small fraction of us are insane enough to explore in the most dangerous grounds and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s quite a few people that would love to take the first step on</p>
<p>Mars, the first few steps on Mars in the harshest of environments, even when the odds of survival</p>
<p>extremely low.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thankful for those people because I sit back and drink my vodka back here on</p>
<p>earth and enjoy good friendships because I think ultimately that step to Mars is going</p>
<p>to be a first step into exploring and colonizing the rest of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Mars might be a harsh environment, but maybe space is not like other planets, other exoplanets,</p>
<p>but also forget planets, just creating colonies that flow about in space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s exciting technologies that are yet to be discovered, yet to be engineered and</p>
<p>built that I think require that first painful step.</p>
<p>The journey of a thousand miles starts with one step and I think Mars is that first step.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I was born the day before the Challenger blew up and it was always so tragic for me</p>
<p>to look back on that because that really altered our arc in terms of space exploration.</p>
<p>That had not happened.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be on a very different arc and I do respect and admire people pushing for exploration,</p>
<p>but at the same time, I just want to recognize that we know how unique Earth is and I do</p>
<p>think we got to do everything we can to protect it.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;ve already answered the question if we&rsquo;re going to destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I guess.</p>
<p>Are you hopeful?</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>If we do not decentralize properly out into different physical spaces, probably, I guess,</p>
<p>yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, do you have concerns that are immediately facing you, so not in terms of the injustices</p>
<p>on the world, but nuclear war?</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I&rsquo;m a lot more concerned about what&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>Like, what is destroying ourselves?</p>
<p>If you were to go and see what&rsquo;s happening in Xinjiang or North Korea right now or Eritrea,</p>
<p>that is destroying ourselves and it&rsquo;s already happened.</p>
<p>So I guess the end, that&rsquo;s why I said, yes, I mean, if you don&rsquo;t decentralize and power</p>
<p>is completely under one person, life is destroyed as we know it.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to go into science fiction to know what a totalitarian hellscape dystopia</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several that exist already and let&rsquo;s try to help those people at the same time</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re trying to push out into space would be my counter, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with you.</p>
<p>In my mind, destruction and suffering are next door neighbors.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t need to destroy all of human civilization.</p>
<p>If much, a large fraction of it lives in conditions that we would equate to suffering, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a good world.</p>
<p>Is there advice that you would give to young people today about life, about career, about</p>
<p>how they can help a world where 53% are living under authoritarian governments, but in general,</p>
<p>a world that&rsquo;s full of injustice, but also full of opportunity?</p>
<p>Just thinking about my own upbringing, I went to a public school here and we never learned</p>
<p>about money.</p>
<p>It was never part of our curriculum.</p>
<p>Even personal finances was not part of our curriculum.</p>
<p>You could take like an optional course to learn about like business or something.</p>
<p>And I think that that would be really valuable as a young person or as a teenager to start</p>
<p>incorporating into your children&rsquo;s lives is like a curiosity about what is money, I think</p>
<p>would be very healthy, regardless of what path that takes them down.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t think about it enough, either from an administrative sort of personal finance</p>
<p>thing about like responsibility, or more fundamentally, like, what is it and who creates it?</p>
<p>Where did it come from?</p>
<p>Both of those things are very important.</p>
<p>So my advice to a young person would be to get to the point where you feel like you can</p>
<p>answer the question, what is money?</p>
<p>So you ultimately see money as a kind of power and freedom and a mechanism of suffering.</p>
<p>It is so core to everything.</p>
<p>The United States, whether you want to call it the Pax Americana, the Empire, the hyperpower,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call this moment in time where the US is dominant around the world,</p>
<p>it is because of the fact that we have this petrodollar system, where we are able to force</p>
<p>the Saudis and other oil producing nations to sell their oil in dollars.</p>
<p>That is really inescapable, inseparable from our power.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very rarely talked about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very important to understand.</p>
<p>So yeah, if young people could start thinking about that stuff, it&rsquo;d be good.</p>
<p>I remember being, it sounds silly to say, but I remember being really uncomfortable</p>
<p>that I was dependent on my parents at a young age for like financial.</p>
<p>You need to be 18 to have a bank account or whatever.</p>
<p>One of the people that we supported at Ahrefs through our, we do software development funding</p>
<p>for people in Bitcoin, open source projects.</p>
<p>And one of the guys we funded is this very young, smart sort of prodigy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like 17.</p>
<p>But one of the reasons he got into Bitcoin was because he wanted to have control of his</p>
<p>money when he was like 14.</p>
<p>I mean, if you think in history, people who invented all kinds of incredible contributions</p>
<p>to science or math, I mean, a lot of them did it before they were 15.</p>
<p>So think about that maturity that is capable and possible in many people.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve participated in some of the years ago, some of the sort of selection processes</p>
<p>for like the Teal fellowship, which is like really amazing.</p>
<p>Like these people who are 14, 15, 16, who don&rsquo;t need to go to college, they&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>like so smart, they can figure it out, but they wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to have a bank account.</p>
<p>So hey, that&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>Like now you have a permissionless money, you can open up yourself without permission</p>
<p>from your parents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating to me.</p>
<p>I feel like I would have loved my parents more if I had freedom to fully realize myself,</p>
<p>because I felt like I was a little bit trapped by, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s not explicit, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit, it&rsquo;s like a subtle push that you&rsquo;re somehow dependent on them.</p>
<p>I mean, part of that is like, I think it actually very much has to do not talking about money.</p>
<p>Like what does it take to operate as an individual entity in this world?</p>
<p>Like knowing that when you&rsquo;re 10 years old, knowing that when you&rsquo;re very young, so that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve, then you see the, how amazing it is to have the support of your parents until</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re 18.</p>
<p>Like have that freedom, have the freedom to appreciate the value your parents bring.</p>
<p>And at the same time, the freedom to leave in some capacity to carve your own path.</p>
<p>I mean, like just all of that, I think for weirdos like me, especially because I was</p>
<p>a very nontraditional path that I think it would be very empowering and certainly would</p>
<p>be empowering in the third world.</p>
<p>Not just weirdos like you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was going to mention one of the people I got who taught me about Bitcoin, her name</p>
<p>is Roya Mapoob.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an Afghan technology CEO, and in 2013 she started paying her employees in Bitcoin</p>
<p>because they were not allowed to open bank accounts, the women that worked for her.</p>
<p>She started the country&rsquo;s first female, like all female software company.</p>
<p>And if they brought cash home, their like husbands or uncles or brothers would steal</p>
<p>it from them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a power patriarchal dominance thing going on.</p>
<p>But they had phones and she was able to pay them in Bitcoin and no one knew, and it gave</p>
<p>them that power.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always stuck in my mind as a very interesting effect of this kind of thing of</p>
<p>permissionless money, like that it can be an empowerment tool.</p>
<p>So absolutely.</p>
<p>So in your own personal life, where did the deep concern for the suffering in the world</p>
<p>come from?</p>
<p>Where was that born?</p>
<p>I was going to be an engineer actually, and then in 2003 we invaded Iraq and I got very</p>
<p>interested in why we did that as a nation and I switched my focus of study to like international</p>
<p>relations and that&rsquo;s how I kind of went down the kind of political science democracy rabbit</p>
<p>hole and ended up getting a job at the human rights foundation.</p>
<p>So that I&rsquo;m a very much a child of like 9 11 and the Iraq war.</p>
<p>Those are the two really formative events for me personally.</p>
<p>Can you break that apart a little bit?</p>
<p>Like what illusion about this world was broken apart by the invasion of Iraq?</p>
<p>Well I think first of all, 9 11 just shifted the world dynamics completely from a focus</p>
<p>on big power politics between the US, Russia and China to this new threat of Islamic terror.</p>
<p>And a lot of it we learned later, a lot of the things we did, we were manufactured, choreographed,</p>
<p>like there were no WMDs in Iraq.</p>
<p>Like the reason our rulers said we needed to invade and destroy this country was a lie.</p>
<p>And that I think has really been forgotten.</p>
<p>Like I think a lot of like the Zoomers like today don&rsquo;t really know a lot about that time</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Unanimously, I mean Democrat, Republican, like Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, like and</p>
<p>the Republicans, everybody wanted to invade this country and it&rsquo;s a confusing time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really good book by Ian McEwen called Saturday, a fiction book that takes place</p>
<p>during I think 2003 and it&rsquo;s one day in the life of the doctor in London.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good though to revisit this time because he has two characters, he has characters</p>
<p>in the book, one of whom is very pro war and one of them is very against war.</p>
<p>Basically he, the father himself is pro war and his son is against it and they have all</p>
<p>these debates.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice to go back to revisit but that time was, it&rsquo;s really crazy and it really</p>
<p>showed you that like the media could be captured into like helping promote this idea of like</p>
<p>invading another country.</p>
<p>So I was very curious about why we did it and like who was pulling the strings and what</p>
<p>are the reasons that we went.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really interesting is that like I took all these courses on and interviewed</p>
<p>all these decision makers, whether they were like neocons or whatever, different people</p>
<p>who were involved.</p>
<p>And the whole like dollar reserve currency thing like really never came up until like</p>
<p>I learned about it more recently because of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And today when I look back, it seems kind of obvious that the reason we invaded Iraq</p>
<p>was because Saddam Hussein wanted to sell oil in euros.</p>
<p>It seems really obvious when you go back and look at the chronology of it and we were like,</p>
<p>no, we actually don&rsquo;t want you to sell dollars in euros because that would threaten the dollar.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to invade you and then you&rsquo;re not going to do it and then no one else is</p>
<p>going to like sell dollars in euros, just oil in euros, right?</p>
<p>I guess you could say the same thing about Qaddafi, but we as a nation have very much</p>
<p>protected our reserve currency, let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually one of the things that Bitcoin community has motivated me to do is to look</p>
<p>back to the histories that I have studied myself from just even the two world wars,</p>
<p>the history of the 20th century from a perspective of the monetary system of money.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to look at human history in the context of money.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t we be patriotic and be pro America, but like not want the petrodollar?</p>
<p>Like I should be proud of my country.</p>
<p>Why do we need to be propping up the Saudis?</p>
<p>Why do we need to be, you know, threatening to invade other countries if they sell their</p>
<p>oil for a different currency?</p>
<p>I think we can be just as powerful as we are today, if not more powerful in a Bitcoin world.</p>
<p>If you think about the infrastructure Americans are building, all the innovations we&rsquo;re building,</p>
<p>all the wealth we have, I think we&rsquo;ll be fine, better than fine.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t have these horrible negative externalities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an optimistic vision for the future.</p>
<p>I thought we learned the lesson of 9 11 and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re leaving and you know, Biden announced we&rsquo;re leaving Afghanistan this year, 20 years</p>
<p>for what?</p>
<p>The Taliban are going to take over.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, that&rsquo;s at least a good, the longest war, right?</p>
<p>The forever wars.</p>
<p>I feel like the past 20 years or whatever it is, 18 years, 19 years, we&rsquo;ve been very</p>
<p>skeptical about invading other countries, about, we&rsquo;ve been skeptical about military</p>
<p>intervention in other nations.</p>
<p>Well, our leaders certainly haven&rsquo;t, we have like seven active wars right now, and neither</p>
<p>the Russians and the Chinese, everybody&rsquo;s starting to invade everybody else.</p>
<p>I mean, so yes, but I meant to a degree that I was worried about like conflicts with, hot</p>
<p>conflicts with Iran, with North Korea, those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That there was not as much war mongering as I was afraid about.</p>
<p>But yes, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still, there&rsquo;s a big presence by the United States and other nations and across</p>
<p>the world that&rsquo;s military.</p>
<p>The military industrial complex is a thing that has huge detrimental ripple effects throughout</p>
<p>the entirety of our governments.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the big question is how do we prevent the rise of this like authoritarian surveillance</p>
<p>state in China while at the same time kind of diffusing the military industrial complex</p>
<p>on our side?</p>
<p>That to me is like the biggest challenge of our time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the answer, but we should keep digging.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I believe there&rsquo;s technological innovations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re suggesting that perhaps one of the technological innovations like is Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big part of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On the money side, I think the information side, there&rsquo;s innovations that are open, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible.</p>
<p>And the political side, I&rsquo;m the most skeptical about.</p>
<p>I just feel like there&rsquo;s, without hot wars that we don&rsquo;t seem to make any kind of progress.</p>
<p>Cities just grow, corruption and greed grow and human nature does not do well in the political</p>
<p>arena.</p>
<p>So I hope technology can outpace the darker sides of human nature.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re busy fighting the demons, the darkness that&rsquo;s out there, but looking in the mirror,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a finite being.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this ride ends for you pretty soon.</p>
<p>Do you ever ask yourself about the meaning at all of why the hell us descendants of apes</p>
<p>are even on this thing, striving so hard to make a better world for ourselves?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t often zoom out that much.</p>
<p>I feel like my day job is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>It keeps me very engaged with all the stuff we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>As far as the meaning of life though, it seems quite clear that we do have the possibility</p>
<p>as a species to create these beautiful communities and constructs and to share an exploration</p>
<p>of the world together that is often marred by cold realities that we&rsquo;ve discussed.</p>
<p>But I do feel like in a way that the meaning of life is that pursuit, of course biologically</p>
<p>is to spread our species, but also to pursue knowledge and science and innovation and freedom</p>
<p>most importantly.</p>
<p>I think freedom has to guide us or else we end up with prison camps.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t let freedom guide us, we end up with the prison camps.</p>
<p>So we need to have scientific innovation and adventurism and colonization of the stars,</p>
<p>but without the slavery and without the prison camps.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s so key.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the creation of beauty that seems fundamental to human nature and</p>
<p>what seems beautiful is these communities that don&rsquo;t have suffering, they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>injustice.</p>
<p>And we have some kind of inner sense of what is injustice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like some of the human rights that you&rsquo;ve mentioned earlier, they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>philosophical constructs, but they&rsquo;re also seem to be somehow deeply in us too.</p>
<p>We have a sense of what is right and what is wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a kind of illusion that we&rsquo;ve all agreed on.</p>
<p>Yeah, arbitrary power, torture, executions.</p>
<p>We know these things are wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, we know they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to read a book to know that.</p>
<p>But you do need to&hellip;</p>
<p>People can get brainwashed.</p>
<p>I mean, you talk to people who&rsquo;ve grown up in North Korea, they don&rsquo;t know any better.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on in the outside world.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve never experienced anything differently.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why, look, technology can play a big role here in terms of the meaning of it</p>
<p>all.</p>
<p>It can really help emancipate, liberate people, at least so that they can make their own choices</p>
<p>about what to do, at least so that we&rsquo;re on a level playing field.</p>
<p>So technologies like the internet and Bitcoin, they can at least give you the option to do</p>
<p>things your own way on your own terms.</p>
<p>And then from there, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important that we have design choices where we can have a little more say</p>
<p>and not everything be preprogrammed for us.</p>
<p>That would be very disappointing.</p>
<p>So I mean, the open web and encryption in Bitcoin, these are things that help prevent</p>
<p>social engineering and that promote more freedom and more possibilities, honestly, and more</p>
<p>entrepreneurship and more creativity and more scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>I mean, think about the people who tried to shut down scientific inquiry 500, 600 years</p>
<p>ago or whatever that were trying to say the earth was the center of everything and they</p>
<p>were wrong.</p>
<p>And then all these conservative religious types throughout history have always said</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no value in science and there&rsquo;s no value in technology and they&rsquo;ve been wrong</p>
<p>the whole time.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s continue pushing here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s continue pushing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of scary to me sometimes, humbling, beautiful, but also scary to think of.</p>
<p>You mentioned North Korea, people are kind of living in ignorance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary to me to think about how much ignorance there is in the world today, like how little</p>
<p>I know personally, or us as a human civilization knows there&rsquo;s yet to be discovered to that</p>
<p>very&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a difference between laziness and ignorance, right?</p>
<p>So I would be lazy if I didn&rsquo;t take advantage of the internet, right?</p>
<p>Someone in North Korea doesn&rsquo;t have the option.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the option.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally no way for them to access the internet.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of like social laziness that philosophers have warned about forever that</p>
<p>we basically become sheep, okay, and then there&rsquo;s actual like brainwashing and censorship that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible like by closing off your population and keeping them off like the internet, right?</p>
<p>So I think these are two very different concepts.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But I also mean just like not even laziness, but cognitive limitations and just historical</p>
<p>scientific limitations like, you know, we&rsquo;re a very young species, like all of the exciting</p>
<p>stuff we&rsquo;ve been talking about have happened on the scale of decades, maybe centuries.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very young and all the cool stuff we&rsquo;ve come up with and it&rsquo;s just humbling to think</p>
<p>about how little we know, but you&rsquo;re right that, you know, ultimately having the freedom</p>
<p>to keep exploring, keep venturing out, even if we later discover that a lot of the stuff</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been doing now is ethically horrible.</p>
<p>If you think about animals or I think about robots a lot, the kind of things we might</p>
<p>be doing to other consciousnesses that are here on earth might be, we might see as atrocities</p>
<p>later on, but ultimately you have to have the freedom to explore those kinds of ideas</p>
<p>and without that freedom, you don&rsquo;t even get the chance to be lazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look, don&rsquo;t be a sheep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to be a sheep.</p>
<p>No offense to sheep.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some practical things, man.</p>
<p>Get on signal, start encrypting your messages, take control over your privacy.</p>
<p>The media doesn&rsquo;t want you to, but check out Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You can be your own bank.</p>
<p>You can transact with people around the world and no one can stop you.</p>
<p>This can put a stop to a lot of arbitrary power and a lot of human rights violations.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use WeChat, question more, research what&rsquo;s happening in Xinjiang, I mean, learn</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening in the genocide in that country and let&rsquo;s think about how we</p>
<p>can build our societies so that we never have that kind of power concentration ever again.</p>
<p>Each of us can make a difference.</p>
<p>Alex, it&rsquo;s a huge honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of your work.</p>
<p>A lot of people spoke really highly of you as one of the beacons of hope for our human</p>
<p>civilization.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really glad we got a chance to talk.</p>
<p>Thank you for wasting all this time with me today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an honor.</p>
<p>Thanks man.</p>
<p>A lot of fun.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Alex Glastine.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Alice Walker.</p>
<p>The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
