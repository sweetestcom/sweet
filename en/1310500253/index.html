    <p>The following is a conversation with Albert Berla, CEO of Pfizer.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to skip ahead to our conversation, the timestamps as always are below.</p>
<p>But if not, please allow me to say a few words about truth and human nature.</p>
<p>Specifically, about two groups of people throughout history that seek to lay claim to the truth.</p>
<p>The first group will tell you that only they possess the truth,</p>
<p>and that the government will save you, the company will save you, the science, the authorities, the experts, the institutions will save you.</p>
<p>The second group, too, will tell you that only they possess the truth,</p>
<p>and that the government will hurt you, the company will hurt you, the science, the authorities, the experts, the institutions will hurt you.</p>
<p>Both groups have the benevolent and the malevolent, their heroes and their charlatans.</p>
<p>And I think the hard truth is that no one in this world can tell you with absolute certainty which is which.</p>
<p>You have to use your mind.</p>
<p>This is the burden of being human, of being free.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blindly follow any leader, neither the emperor nor the martyr who points out that the emperor has no clothes.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the lessons of history.</p>
<p>Vaccines have saved hundreds of millions of lives in the past century,</p>
<p>and in general, the advance of medicine has saved billions of lives.</p>
<p>If you ignore the power of science, you&rsquo;re not being honest with the lessons of history.</p>
<p>And if you ignore the corrupting nature of power and money within institutions,</p>
<p>including governments and companies that led to the suffering and death of hundreds of millions in the past century,</p>
<p>you are once again not being honest with the lessons of history.</p>
<p>I announced that I will be having this conversation with Albert Burla, Pfizer CEO, and a lot of people wrote to me.</p>
<p>I would like to say that I was and am and always will be listening and learning with an open mind from everyone.</p>
<p>My own opinion, worth little as it is, is that the development of the COVID vaccines is one of the greatest accomplishments of science in recent history.</p>
<p>For the rest, from safety and efficacy to policy and economics,</p>
<p>I stand humbled before a complicated world full of fear and anger.</p>
<p>A small number of malicious people from all walks of life will use that fear and anger to divide us,</p>
<p>because the division makes them money and gives them power.</p>
<p>I took two shots of the Pfizer vaccine.</p>
<p>This was my decision.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever want to force this on anyone, and I certainly don&rsquo;t want to dismiss your concerns or worse,</p>
<p>you as a person if you choose not to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>I can assure you one thing, in this conversation, and in any conversation,</p>
<p>the choice of questions I ask and words I say is mine and mine alone.</p>
<p>When my words fall short, as they often do, it is only because of the limitations of my mind and of my speaking ability.</p>
<p>It is not due to pressure or fear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid of anyone.</p>
<p>I cannot be bought by anyone with money, power, or fame.</p>
<p>I hope to prove this to you and to myself in the coming years.</p>
<p>This life is short, and to me, without integrity, it is not worth living.</p>
<p>People sometimes talk down to me, call me naive.</p>
<p>Perhaps they are right, but it is who I am.</p>
<p>I think this life, this world, this, our human civilization is beautiful.</p>
<p>And as Dostoevsky said, beauty will save the world.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here&rsquo;s my conversation with Albert Borla.</p>
<p>The development of the COVID 19 vaccine was one of the greatest accomplishments of science in recent history.</p>
<p>No matter what, this should give people hope for the future.</p>
<p>And yet, it is more of a source of division.</p>
<p>I hope we can discuss both the inspiring and the difficult ideas in this conversation</p>
<p>so that we can do our small part in healing this division.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>Take me through the day of November 8th, 2020,</p>
<p>when the Pfizer team were waiting for the results of the phase three clinical trials.</p>
<p>We had assembled in a very small office that we are having in Connecticut, very few people.</p>
<p>There were five, I think.</p>
<p>And in another place, what we call the Data Monitoring Committee,</p>
<p>which is a group of experts, independent experts, they&rsquo;re on Pfizer,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have the opportunity to unblind the data</p>
<p>and then tell us if the study needs to continue or if it is successful or if it fails.</p>
<p>And we were waiting for their call.</p>
<p>So the call came a little bit later than what we expected,</p>
<p>which created a lot of anxiety to all of us, but came around, I think, two o clock.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just sitting there waiting? What were you feeling?</p>
<p>Sitting there waiting and teasing one another, drinking coffee, making jokes.</p>
<p>So how did you feel like when you heard the results, the successful results?</p>
<p>Free, liberated, happy.</p>
<p>Like if a huge weight that was on my shoulders was lifted.</p>
<p>I heard you said, I love you to the team.</p>
<p>I did. This is how we speak in Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Listen, maybe it&rsquo;s the Russian thing too.</p>
<p>I love love, so I appreciate that kind of celebration.</p>
<p>So looking back from that moment to before,</p>
<p>how much did it cost to develop the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine?</p>
<p>What was it like making the decision to make that investment</p>
<p>when the risk is very high and you don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to be successful?</p>
<p>You know, we do a lot of that anyway.</p>
<p>This is what we do in our daily work.</p>
<p>We are putting money.</p>
<p>We are investing in research, which is highly risky.</p>
<p>The difference in that case was that we didn&rsquo;t risk at all.</p>
<p>We put it all in.</p>
<p>We put everything in one go so that we don&rsquo;t lose time.</p>
<p>Usually, we will spend 50 millions.</p>
<p>And then if that goes well, then we will spend another 50.</p>
<p>And then if it goes well, then 100.</p>
<p>Here, we put all together a little bit more than $2 billion, $2.3 billion.</p>
<p>And it was a significant decision.</p>
<p>But it was a very easy decision to make in the context of what</p>
<p>we were living at that time.</p>
<p>It was a pandemic.</p>
<p>People were scared.</p>
<p>We were scared.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know how tomorrow would look like.</p>
<p>We were living unprecedented situations.</p>
<p>And we knew that we have capabilities that may help.</p>
<p>So there was not a second question or choice.</p>
<p>We go all in.</p>
<p>When you make decisions like that, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the CEO of a company that needs to make money</p>
<p>and that hopes to do a lot of good in the world.</p>
<p>How much of both of those things are part of the calculation?</p>
<p>So when you said it was an obvious choice,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve said a bunch of things of the kind of saying</p>
<p>we need to go all in, sort of very boldly diving in.</p>
<p>How much was that the world is facing uncertainty and fear</p>
<p>and potentially destructive pandemic in the early days,</p>
<p>just when you&rsquo;re seeing the full uncertainty before us,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s going to unroll?</p>
<p>And how much of it is this may also</p>
<p>be a good financial decision to take this risk?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think about it all the time.</p>
<p>And I know very well that if you focus too much on making money,</p>
<p>you will never make.</p>
<p>You should focus in what is the real value driver.</p>
<p>And the real value driver, it is to make breakthroughs</p>
<p>that change patients lives.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t do that, you will never make money.</p>
<p>If you do that, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>Things will fall into place, and also money will follow.</p>
<p>But the mentality of the company is</p>
<p>to be how to help the patient.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the management was that the shareholders want,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only way that we can create value.</p>
<p>In this particular case, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thinking at all about what are we</p>
<p>going to make when we sell it or if we don&rsquo;t sell it.</p>
<p>Because what we were focusing 100%</p>
<p>was how to bring a solution to the world that</p>
<p>will help all of us change the fear that</p>
<p>was bringing hope to the world.</p>
<p>And as always, when you do that, you</p>
<p>will have good returns as well.</p>
<p>On a philosophical level, on a human level,</p>
<p>do you ever worry that the pressure</p>
<p>to cover the costs that were invested,</p>
<p>to develop a new drug, to develop this vaccine,</p>
<p>harms your ability to conduct unbiased studies?</p>
<p>Not at all, because the studies are highly regulated.</p>
<p>Everybody knows what regulators, and when</p>
<p>I say regulators, FDA, European authorities, UK authorities,</p>
<p>Israeli authorities, Japanese authorities, Canadian</p>
<p>authorities, want to see how the study needs to be conducted</p>
<p>and what exactly they need to see to approve it or not.</p>
<p>So clearly, everybody takes into consideration</p>
<p>how much money I&rsquo;m going to invest</p>
<p>and what is the chances that I&rsquo;m going to lose them.</p>
<p>But what you can do is to change the rules of the game</p>
<p>so that you won&rsquo;t lose the money.</p>
<p>There are very well established methodologies</p>
<p>that would say with very high precision</p>
<p>if your medicine is effective, if your medicine is safe.</p>
<p>And those are there for all and are</p>
<p>playing with the same rules.</p>
<p>Do you have an intuition about why</p>
<p>is the FDA trying to get 75 years to release the Pfizer</p>
<p>data?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to request that it will not</p>
<p>be released for 75 years.</p>
<p>And then maybe the broader version of that question</p>
<p>is do you think people should have</p>
<p>sort of full transparency and immediate access to the data,</p>
<p>immediate on the scale of weeks, not years?</p>
<p>I think the relations with regulators,</p>
<p>they have been always very transparent.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of laws that they</p>
<p>are forcing regulators and companies</p>
<p>to put out their interactions and what exactly was discussed.</p>
<p>Now, to go into specific details of some discussions,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is the reason that FDA</p>
<p>wants to take the time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure they have very good reasons.</p>
<p>Well, let me just say my side of it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like a good reason.</p>
<p>It looks like maybe it&rsquo;s because I come from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Now, this is not you saying this.</p>
<p>This is me saying this.</p>
<p>There seems to be a bureaucracy that</p>
<p>gets in the way of transparency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the challenge with government.</p>
<p>So government is very good at setting rules and making</p>
<p>sure there&rsquo;s oversight of companies and people and so on.</p>
<p>But they create, they slow things down,</p>
<p>which is a feature and a bug.</p>
<p>And in this case, they slow down so much.</p>
<p>I think the reason they set it at 75 years</p>
<p>is because they set a rate of being</p>
<p>able to only review 500 pages of data a day</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very kind of bureaucratic thing,</p>
<p>where in reality, you could just show the data.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like something is being hidden.</p>
<p>But in the battle to win people&rsquo;s trust,</p>
<p>to inspire them with science, it feels</p>
<p>like transparency is one of the most beautiful things, one</p>
<p>of the most powerful things that the FDA has.</p>
<p>FDA has the potential to be one of the great institutions</p>
<p>of our country.</p>
<p>And this is one example that it feels, to me, like a failure.</p>
<p>So in your perspective, you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they have a good reason.</p>
<p>So to you, the FDA is this black box</p>
<p>that you submit things to once they approve.</p>
<p>You know that those are the rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s approved.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>But this is not a black box.</p>
<p>We know very well what is the process.</p>
<p>Everybody knows very well what are the processes.</p>
<p>The review process also, it is very detailed.</p>
<p>They have scientists of very, very high caliber.</p>
<p>Not every regulator in the world,</p>
<p>but the Europeans, the BRIDs, the FDA clearly,</p>
<p>they have very, very high caliber of scientists</p>
<p>that they are going into a lot of details.</p>
<p>And also, basically everything for a study</p>
<p>is really released by law in the specifications</p>
<p>of the product, but it&rsquo;s a very detailed document</p>
<p>that it is issued and has basically the essence</p>
<p>of everything that was discussed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about specific documents</p>
<p>if take them time to release,</p>
<p>but clearly this is not a black box type of process.</p>
<p>A lot of this stuff is how do you effectively communicate</p>
<p>to the world about the incredible science that&rsquo;s been done,</p>
<p>about the processes that were followed.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>And then sometimes it&rsquo;s just in eloquence in communication.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s a failure process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in eloquence of communication and silence.</p>
<p>Silence in the moment when clearly a lot of people</p>
<p>are bothered and have questions.</p>
<p>This is when you speak out and you explain exactly why</p>
<p>as opposed to letting the sort of distrust build up</p>
<p>and linger because the result is there&rsquo;s a very large</p>
<p>percentage of the population that just,</p>
<p>I mean, it divides people and science suffers, I think.</p>
<p>And also the effectiveness of solutions suffers</p>
<p>like the vaccine and so on.</p>
<p>I asked a few folks I know</p>
<p>if they had challenging questions for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of them answered your call.</p>
<p>Yeah, many friendly folks out there.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m sweating not because this is a difficult</p>
<p>conversation, it is, but it&rsquo;s also hot in here</p>
<p>for the record.</p>
<p>So one of the folks is Mr. Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who that is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a psychologist and intellectual and author.</p>
<p>He suggested to me that I raised the concern</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a close working relationship</p>
<p>between Pfizer, FDA, and CDC.</p>
<p>So we talked about FDA.</p>
<p>Do you worry that this affects both positive and negative</p>
<p>Pfizer&rsquo;s chances of getting drugs approved?</p>
<p>The fact that there&rsquo;s people that worked at the FDA</p>
<p>that now work at Pfizer, Pfizer, FDA,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a kind of pipeline.</p>
<p>Does this worry you that it affects your ability</p>
<p>to do great, unbiased work?</p>
<p>I have zero doubts that this is not affecting at all</p>
<p>their ability to be unbiased and regulate.</p>
<p>And in order to, for the system also reinforces that</p>
<p>by creating significant time barriers.</p>
<p>If someone moves from an industry to FDA,</p>
<p>she won&rsquo;t be able to deal with topics for a period of time.</p>
<p>And then for even an enhanced period of time</p>
<p>with topics that are related with a company</p>
<p>he or she may come from.</p>
<p>I think these regulators, they are really very strict.</p>
<p>Rightly so.</p>
<p>If anything, I feel sometimes that maybe they should</p>
<p>be a little bit more open minded,</p>
<p>particularly when it comes to new technologies,</p>
<p>rather than trying to judge and implement the same</p>
<p>framework of variation of new technologies to all.</p>
<p>They are always as regulators in the conservative side.</p>
<p>But always, always, they are unbiased</p>
<p>and they are trying the best.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only one or two people.</p>
<p>They have processes to make sure that there are self checks</p>
<p>and balances within the agencies,</p>
<p>both in CDC and in the FDA.</p>
<p>Difficult decisions, they bring external experts</p>
<p>that they should express.</p>
<p>Easy decisions, they are internal experts</p>
<p>that they are debating a lot.</p>
<p>And if there are disagreements, they elevate them.</p>
<p>So I think we are lucky to have good regulators.</p>
<p>I think I agree with what you said before,</p>
<p>as with all governmental agencies, there is bureaucracy.</p>
<p>And the bureaucracy needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>And by saying bureaucracy is not relaxing the bar.</p>
<p>The bar needs to remain high.</p>
<p>But focusing on what matters rather than on the detail.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ve been reading quite a bit about history.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t worry about human nature and corruption</p>
<p>that can seep in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying institutionally,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s protections against this.</p>
<p>I think there is always the fear of corruption,</p>
<p>particularly when you speak about public servants.</p>
<p>But clearly the risk is very different country by country.</p>
<p>And speaking about agencies by agencies,</p>
<p>I think the regulatory agencies</p>
<p>have a very good track record in history</p>
<p>of the US, of Europe, of England,</p>
<p>of very, very good track record of integrity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something I think about.</p>
<p>So I grew up in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and I need to perhaps introspect this a little bit.</p>
<p>But when I was growing up, ethically,</p>
<p>there was a sense that bribery</p>
<p>is the only way you can get stuff done.</p>
<p>That was the system of the time.</p>
<p>Like you get pulled over by a police officer.</p>
<p>Like obviously you need to bribe them.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like the way of life.</p>
<p>And then so coming to this country was beautiful</p>
<p>to see that the rule of law has so much power.</p>
<p>And ultimately the rule of law when enacted,</p>
<p>when it holds up, it gives people freedom</p>
<p>to do the best work of their lives.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still human nature.</p>
<p>And that worries me a lot here.</p>
<p>And again, it goes back to the perception,</p>
<p>the communication, when there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>that have worked at Pfizer and an FDA, at the CDC,</p>
<p>you look at their resume,</p>
<p>they have those things on their resume, it worries people.</p>
<p>Are these great leaders that we are supposed</p>
<p>to see as authorities, are they playing a game on us?</p>
<p>I would say that I recognize what you said</p>
<p>about what happened in, or what,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that what you described</p>
<p>in the country that you&rsquo;re coming from,</p>
<p>it was how you experienced it.</p>
<p>And I know that there are other countries</p>
<p>that you need to do these things to do your job.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the case in this country,</p>
<p>particularly when it comes to those agencies</p>
<p>that you mentioned.</p>
<p>I think they have a very high track record.</p>
<p>And also, I don&rsquo;t think that there are a lot of people</p>
<p>that they are worried about it or doubt it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, like everywhere, there will be a minority,</p>
<p>but the vast majority of the Americans,</p>
<p>the vast majority of the Europeans,</p>
<p>the vast majority of the Brits,</p>
<p>the vast majority of the Israelis,</p>
<p>they trust what FDA or EMA or CDC or MHRA will say.</p>
<p>MHRA will say.</p>
<p>Still, there&rsquo;s currently a distrust</p>
<p>of big pharma in the public.</p>
<p>Maybe this is something I&rsquo;d love to hear your comment on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s distrust of science when it&rsquo;s tangled up</p>
<p>with corporations and government institutions,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>But they have to be entangled to achieve scale,</p>
<p>oversight, and to achieve the kind of scale</p>
<p>that Pfizer&rsquo;s been able to accomplish.</p>
<p>So, how can Pfizer regain the public trust?</p>
<p>How can you regain the public trust, do you think?</p>
<p>Not regain, but sort of take steps</p>
<p>to increase the public trust.</p>
<p>Reputation is something that you can lose in buckets,</p>
<p>but you can earn it back in drops.</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;ve lost it,</p>
<p>you are going to take a lot of effort to bring it back.</p>
<p>And the pharmaceutical industry lost it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that the reputation of the industry</p>
<p>in the last decade was on the lowest</p>
<p>that we have seen ever.</p>
<p>And there are many reasons for that,</p>
<p>but clearly there are reasons that are related also</p>
<p>with the behavior of the industry.</p>
<p>That needed to change, and I&rsquo;m hopeful</p>
<p>that very few will disagree</p>
<p>that the industry is a very different industry right now.</p>
<p>That being said, I truly believe</p>
<p>that if there is one lesson that stands out</p>
<p>from the many lessons that we learned during COVID,</p>
<p>is the power of science in the hands of the private sector.</p>
<p>I think it was the private sector</p>
<p>that came with solutions with diagnostic tests</p>
<p>when we didn&rsquo;t have, solutions with respirators</p>
<p>when we didn&rsquo;t have, solutions with treatments,</p>
<p>solutions with vaccines.</p>
<p>And I think that demonstrated very clearly to the world</p>
<p>the value of thriving life sciences sector,</p>
<p>private life sciences sector to society.</p>
<p>That also affected very positively the reputation,</p>
<p>both of the sector and of Pfizer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make the mistake to consider given.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make the mistake</p>
<p>that because our reputation is high, that will remain so.</p>
<p>We need to earn it every day.</p>
<p>Every day with everything we do,</p>
<p>with everything we say, with the way we behave.</p>
<p>And I hope that we&rsquo;ll rise to this occasion</p>
<p>and we will do that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been at Pfizer for 28 years.</p>
<p>Time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve become CEO in 2019.</p>
<p>It is a company you love, a company you believe in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a company that has developed drugs</p>
<p>that has helped millions of people.</p>
<p>So let me ask yet another hard question</p>
<p>on this topic of reputation.</p>
<p>In 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty</p>
<p>to the illegal marketing of arthritis drug Bextra</p>
<p>and agreed to a $2.3 billion settlement.</p>
<p>How do you make sense of the fact that this happened</p>
<p>to a company you love and that you believe in?</p>
<p>Yes, the Bextra case in 2009</p>
<p>was related to things that happened in 2003.</p>
<p>And the things that happened in 2003</p>
<p>were things that basically several of our reps</p>
<p>did off label promotion.</p>
<p>So they spoke with the physicians</p>
<p>about off label use of the product, and they shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Can you clarify it?</p>
<p>So off label are things that the FDA didn&rsquo;t approve,</p>
<p>extra stuff.</p>
<p>You basically say this drug does extra stuff</p>
<p>that the FDA never approved.</p>
<p>Correct, and this is something that it is allowed</p>
<p>when physicians are speaking to physicians,</p>
<p>but it is not allowed for the pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p>to refer to these studies,</p>
<p>because usually our studies that are happening off label.</p>
<p>And apparently several of our reps in 2003, they did it.</p>
<p>And we had to settle in 2009,</p>
<p>and we paid a very big fine, as you said.</p>
<p>The fine was related not to the severity of the conduct,</p>
<p>but the size of the revenues.</p>
<p>So the fines are, if Bextra was a small product,</p>
<p>we would get a small fine.</p>
<p>Bextra was a very big product,</p>
<p>and we got a very large fine.</p>
<p>Very bad, what happened in 2003.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that these things happened since then.</p>
<p>We have a stellar record from 2009 until now</p>
<p>of complying with every single regulation and rule.</p>
<p>We have internal processes to make sure</p>
<p>that these are not happening by individuals</p>
<p>that may have an interest.</p>
<p>For example, to get a promotion,</p>
<p>they may try and do things</p>
<p>that are not the right things.</p>
<p>And we have, more importantly, a culture in this company</p>
<p>that really sets aside people that they think differently.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t like what happened in 2003,</p>
<p>but I believe a lot has changed</p>
<p>in the 20 years that followed, or almost 20 years.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re developing drugs,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re developing solutions to help millions of people,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s risk involved.</p>
<p>And so there will be lawsuits heading back your way</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of lawyers in the world, partially.</p>
<p>How do you put that into the calculation</p>
<p>of how you try to do good in the world?</p>
<p>That some of the cost is the lawsuits.</p>
<p>How do you not fall victim to thinking</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just the cost of doing business,</p>
<p>and that some of the lawsuits might actually represent</p>
<p>real pain that people are going through?</p>
<p>No, I think that we try always to do the right thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, as I said, very well embedded into our culture.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t do the right thing,</p>
<p>sooner or later, you will pay for it, one way or another.</p>
<p>And right now, for us doing the right thing,</p>
<p>it is being able to find innovations to issues</p>
<p>that are real, diseases that they do not have</p>
<p>good coverage, good treatments right now.</p>
<p>We try to find treatments that significantly</p>
<p>surpass the current standards of care.</p>
<p>And we try not only to comply with what regulators</p>
<p>are asking us to do, this is what you need to do</p>
<p>to prove the safety or the efficacy, but exceed them.</p>
<p>No matter what we do on that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that people will find opportunity</p>
<p>because, as you said, there are a lot of lawyers to sue us.</p>
<p>But we believe in the justice system</p>
<p>and we believe that eventually,</p>
<p>if you are doing the right thing,</p>
<p>you will be on the right side of the history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad you say that because</p>
<p>focusing on doing the right thing, no matter the money,</p>
<p>I believe is the best way to make money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I said.</p>
<p>And also, in another way, in other realms,</p>
<p>creating a product that people love</p>
<p>is the best way to make money.</p>
<p>So focusing on the core of the thing</p>
<p>that makes people feel good,</p>
<p>that brings value to people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>My good friend, Joe Rogan, he&rsquo;s been highlighting to me</p>
<p>this aggressive marketing on mainstream media channels</p>
<p>by Pfizer.</p>
<p>So let me ask a general marketing question.</p>
<p>Do you see this as a conflict of interest?</p>
<p>Is it my bias, the reporting of news?</p>
<p>That a lot of us, a lot of people, me included,</p>
<p>look to these mainstream channels of news</p>
<p>for kind of authority of like,</p>
<p>what the heck&rsquo;s going on in the world?</p>
<p>And if Pfizer is sponsoring</p>
<p>many of these shows,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a worry, it may be a perception thing,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a natural worry</p>
<p>that it would influence what they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid of losing the sponsorship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s subtle, but at scale, it might have a serious impact.</p>
<p>Do you worry about this?</p>
<p>I think people could go one way or another</p>
<p>because of multiple reasons.</p>
<p>From our perspective,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have aggressive marketing.</p>
<p>What we do, we go on TV</p>
<p>and we are having ads about our products</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re highly regulated.</p>
<p>I think it is the right of people to know,</p>
<p>to learn that if there is a product like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clearly that we cannot say things</p>
<p>that they are off label, that have not been approved.</p>
<p>We need to have, every time we go on TV, as you know,</p>
<p>FDA is forcing us to say also the bad things</p>
<p>that can happen for a medicine.</p>
<p>Sometimes that takes more time than the good things.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that we are doing aggressive marketing.</p>
<p>Now, people could be influenced</p>
<p>and can be biased in the podcasts</p>
<p>or the other type of media activities that they have</p>
<p>for multiple different reasons.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, but it&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s pressure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
<p>I mean, one of it is perception, but I worry about too.</p>
<p>I think I have a ton of sponsors for this podcast,</p>
<p>for example, and none of them ever asked me to anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, you know,</p>
<p>I think likely that kind of pressure&rsquo;s not happening</p>
<p>for Pfizer, but there&rsquo;s implied pressure sometimes.</p>
<p>And I worry about that a lot because, you know,</p>
<p>I look at academia, like I look for the good in people.</p>
<p>I tend to believe most people are good</p>
<p>or have the capacity to be good and desire to be good.</p>
<p>When I came to MIT, I was a little bit disappointed,</p>
<p>maybe heartbroken.</p>
<p>How much pressure?</p>
<p>I think unjustified pressure people felt</p>
<p>from financial constraints, especially at MIT</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s, I think, a lot of money.</p>
<p>People still felt constraints and they weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t bringing out the best in them.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t supporting each other.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t loving each other,</p>
<p>like celebrating each other&rsquo;s successes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to blame money on everything,</p>
<p>money constraints, but when you have sponsors,</p>
<p>it just, I personally worry</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t bring the best out of people.</p>
<p>And so I feel like I want to put some responsibility</p>
<p>on sponsors and great big companies like Pfizer</p>
<p>to kind of not get in the way of the best of human nature,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s sponsoring podcasts, mainstream media,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know, athletes, whatever.</p>
<p>You need to know that we are so, so careful</p>
<p>with sponsorships.</p>
<p>First of all, we have very few, very, very few.</p>
<p>We have a team that for every single one,</p>
<p>could be $2,000.</p>
<p>They will try to see if there is a conflict of interest</p>
<p>in the way we do it.</p>
<p>And also what is the reputation of the persons</p>
<p>or the programs that we are sponsoring?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think, our friend, I think was from Texas.</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t. Joe Rogan, yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he got it right</p>
<p>that we do those type of things.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Oh, in terms of like having a negative effect on.</p>
<p>Not even having aggressive sponsorships.</p>
<p>We have very few.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you clip them all together.</p>
<p>And most of the sponsorships that we have,</p>
<p>it is more on patient related organizations</p>
<p>rather than we are very careful not to sponsor other things</p>
<p>that can be perceived, not even influenced,</p>
<p>but perceived that we may influence.</p>
<p>So we are very, very careful on that.</p>
<p>This is not the case with us.</p>
<p>So with the incredibly fast development of the vaccine,</p>
<p>could you tell me the story from the engineering</p>
<p>to the science, to the human story</p>
<p>of how you could do it so fast?</p>
<p>By November, you even had the ambition to do it by October.</p>
<p>It was in the initial days.</p>
<p>How do you. Eight days later.</p>
<p>In that time, how do you show</p>
<p>that the vaccine is safe and effective</p>
<p>given that I think previous vaccines</p>
<p>have taken years to do that?</p>
<p>Yeah, the vaccines take years to do that.</p>
<p>And the time that it takes, it is basically</p>
<p>the vast majority of the time to conduct</p>
<p>the final phase three study,</p>
<p>that is the confirmatory study.</p>
<p>And you do that because the phase three study</p>
<p>costs a lot of money, in our case, cost almost a billion.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to go and risk a billion</p>
<p>in blinded data normally before you do a lot of experiments</p>
<p>to make sure that the product that you&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>in the phase three is the right one.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have that time.</p>
<p>So we risked all the money.</p>
<p>So we went into, we condensed all the time</p>
<p>towards this phase three.</p>
<p>But the phase three study had to follow all the rules</p>
<p>that any study follows when we do this trial.</p>
<p>Could you just briefly describe the basics</p>
<p>of what is phase one, what is phase two, what is phase three?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that there are so many phases</p>
<p>when you try first of all to find</p>
<p>what is the right vaccine.</p>
<p>We tried from 20 different vaccines,</p>
<p>we nailed down to four.</p>
<p>And for those four, we selected eventually two</p>
<p>and then eventually one.</p>
<p>Once you have those selections,</p>
<p>what is the dose you&rsquo;re going to use?</p>
<p>And then we tried multiple different doses</p>
<p>to see which one we think is the best.</p>
<p>What does trying entail in those early days?</p>
<p>You go first of all with smaller doses in humans.</p>
<p>And then after you have done a lot of experiments</p>
<p>in animals so that you can feel that it is safe enough</p>
<p>to go to humans and then go with very low dose.</p>
<p>And then you gradually increase the dose</p>
<p>and then you monitor those humans to make sure</p>
<p>that there are not any, let&rsquo;s say reactogenicity</p>
<p>to what you are giving them.</p>
<p>At the same time, you start to measure what it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>in terms of immune responses.</p>
<p>So you do that with multiple vaccines</p>
<p>and you do that with multiple doses</p>
<p>and you do that with multiple ages of people,</p>
<p>young people, old people.</p>
<p>And eventually from the 20 vaccines to multiple doses,</p>
<p>to multiple schedules, is it after three weeks</p>
<p>the second dose or is it after four weeks</p>
<p>or after six months?</p>
<p>All of that will inform you that I think this is the vaccine,</p>
<p>this is the dose, this is the scheme</p>
<p>that I believe will give me the best results.</p>
<p>And when you have that,</p>
<p>then you go to do what we call the phase three.</p>
<p>This is a very big study with thousands of people</p>
<p>where you use the vaccine that you think is the right one</p>
<p>and a placebo.</p>
<p>The placebo and the vaccine, they look identical.</p>
<p>Nobody knows if is injected a placebo or a vaccine.</p>
<p>The physician that makes the injection,</p>
<p>the doctor doesn&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s injecting placebo</p>
<p>or vaccine, he knows a barcode.</p>
<p>Only the computer knows.</p>
<p>In order to go into this computer, there are keys</p>
<p>and there are at least two people</p>
<p>that needs to put their keys</p>
<p>so that someone can see the data.</p>
<p>And those people, they have legal obligations</p>
<p>never to do that, right?</p>
<p>So before a certain point.</p>
<p>So all of that is blind.</p>
<p>The idea is that when you go into this study,</p>
<p>you need to make sure that you are going with the right one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it takes so much time.</p>
<p>But the study is the study.</p>
<p>You need to have a significant number of people</p>
<p>that will give the two</p>
<p>and then you let them live their lives.</p>
<p>And then you see how many of them will get the disease.</p>
<p>And then you see if there are differences</p>
<p>in percentage of infections for the vaccinated</p>
<p>compared to the non vaccinated.</p>
<p>At the same time, you&rsquo;re monitoring all of them</p>
<p>to see if there are differences in the safety profile.</p>
<p>If those that go to placebo have the same,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, heart attacks with those that they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They got the vaccine because heart attacks will happen</p>
<p>if you have 50,000 people because it&rsquo;s part of life.</p>
<p>These are the, all these processes are very, very,</p>
<p>very well established and since years.</p>
<p>What we did the last one was exactly the same</p>
<p>as we did always.</p>
<p>We just didn&rsquo;t lose time.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re not careful with money.</p>
<p>Instead of recruiting 50,000 people over a year,</p>
<p>because we had let&rsquo;s say 30 hospitals doing the recruitment,</p>
<p>we went with 150 hospitals doing the recruitment.</p>
<p>That cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>But instead of recruiting them in a year,</p>
<p>we recruited them in three, four months.</p>
<p>So I did this type of things by taking return on investment,</p>
<p>taking costs out of the equation</p>
<p>and we were able to achieve this result.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not the process, believe me.</p>
<p>It is the heart of the people.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t know what they can and what they cannot do.</p>
<p>And if anything, they have a serious tendency</p>
<p>to underestimate what they can do.</p>
<p>And always, when you ask them something</p>
<p>that is seemingly impossible,</p>
<p>they will think out of the box to be able to deliver.</p>
<p>We discussed about the timing.</p>
<p>Instead of eight years, we then asked them to do it</p>
<p>in six, we asked them to do it in eight months.</p>
<p>Our normal manufacturing yearly production of Pfizer</p>
<p>was 200 million doses of vaccines every year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we are doing in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t ask them to make 300 million doses for a new vaccine.</p>
<p>We asked them to make 3 billion doses for a new vaccine.</p>
<p>The discovery phase of a new molecule,</p>
<p>like the treatment that we have now, the pill against COVID,</p>
<p>takes four years.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t ask them to do it in three.</p>
<p>We asked them to do it in four months,</p>
<p>which is what they did.</p>
<p>When you are setting this type of goals,</p>
<p>they know immediately, they cannot just think</p>
<p>within the box.</p>
<p>And immediately, this is where the human ingenuity</p>
<p>and the heart comes.</p>
<p>And this is how they surprised all of us.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s incredible science and engineering</p>
<p>going on here.</p>
<p>This is an incredible thing. Absolutely.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s bothering me,</p>
<p>that the conversation in public is often not about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about politics, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Politics.</p>
<p>So I spent the day with Elon Musk yesterday.</p>
<p>He works with rockets.</p>
<p>Similar situation as with Pfizer,</p>
<p>in the sense that there&rsquo;s NASA</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s this private company.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a source of incredible inspiration to people.</p>
<p>No politics, very little politics.</p>
<p>So this is part of the thing I&rsquo;m trying to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to do our little part in this conversation</p>
<p>to help untangle a little bit,</p>
<p>just reveal the beauty and the power of the thing</p>
<p>that was done here, especially with the vaccine,</p>
<p>but other things that are being done</p>
<p>with the antiviral drug.</p>
<p>Let me just kind of linger on the safety.</p>
<p>What can you say?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that are concerned</p>
<p>that the Pfizer vaccine, by the way,</p>
<p>of which I took two shots, no booster yet,</p>
<p>is unsafe.</p>
<p>What do you say to people that say that?</p>
<p>No, they should not fear something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely wrong.</p>
<p>There is no medical product in the history of humanity</p>
<p>that have been tested as much as this vaccine.</p>
<p>Has been administered to hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>And because of the importance of COVID,</p>
<p>they have been scrutinized, those people, constantly.</p>
<p>Right now, healthcare authorities are looking</p>
<p>for every single signal around the world</p>
<p>of people that they got the vaccine</p>
<p>and try to see if it is vaccine related or not.</p>
<p>There are electronic medical records</p>
<p>that will tell us when and what happened</p>
<p>to a person when he did got the vaccine.</p>
<p>And we know now, we have so high certainty</p>
<p>that it is so safe, exactly as the data sheet says</p>
<p>about this vaccine, more than any other product.</p>
<p>They should not be afraid of something like that.</p>
<p>And they should not listen to information</p>
<p>that it is misinformation, that it is spread on purpose.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t like the word misinformation</p>
<p>because, you know, again, back to the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>anyone who opposes the state is spreading misinformation.</p>
<p>So you can basically call anything misinformation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the unfortunate times we live in,</p>
<p>is you can call anyone, you can basically call anybody</p>
<p>a liar and say, I&rsquo;m the sole possessor of the truth.</p>
<p>And just no offense to me, just because you wear a tie,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re any more likely to be</p>
<p>in the possession of the truth than anyone else.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t disagree with that at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s not wearing a tie.</p>
<p>And as you can, people can see</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not wearing a tie and you are.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not about being able,</p>
<p>those that they have the power to impose on the others,</p>
<p>the stigma that what you&rsquo;re saying is misinformation.</p>
<p>But there are a few things that as society</p>
<p>we have accomplished and science is one of them.</p>
<p>And data is, and analytics of data is another one.</p>
<p>And to say that something which is highly scientific</p>
<p>by people that they are not scientists.</p>
<p>I think that it is not what you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>what used to happen in Soviet Union</p>
<p>or in any other autocratic regime in the world right now.</p>
<p>But I definitely do think that the scientists,</p>
<p>the public science communicators I&rsquo;ve listened to</p>
<p>over COVID have really disappointed me</p>
<p>because they have not spoken with empathy.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t sufficiently in my view</p>
<p>have put their ego aside and really listened to people.</p>
<p>Yes, people that don&rsquo;t have a PhD,</p>
<p>people who have not really,</p>
<p>maybe not even taken like a biology course in college</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But still they have children, they worry, they fear.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know who to trust.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know if they should listen to the CEO of Pfizer</p>
<p>who might have other incentives in mind,</p>
<p>who might just care about money and nothing else.</p>
<p>And so they just use common sense and they ask questions.</p>
<p>And I think to them talking down to them</p>
<p>as if they&rsquo;re not intelligent and so on</p>
<p>is something scientists have done</p>
<p>almost like rolled their eyes.</p>
<p>And that disappoints me because I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of what is the source of division.</p>
<p>Humility is a virtue.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the fact that you are educated</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that you are having either humility or empathy</p>
<p>or you have good human qualities.</p>
<p>This was never and will never be a metric</p>
<p>of judging this type of virtues.</p>
<p>Those that they do this, they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And actually they are not doing good service</p>
<p>to the public health because they&rsquo;re undermining.</p>
<p>People are not stupid.</p>
<p>They see if you&rsquo;re not be respecting them</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re not respecting their need to learn</p>
<p>because that affects their health,</p>
<p>the health of the mother, of the kids.</p>
<p>So I fully agree with you that we should be very patient</p>
<p>to explain again and again and again what is happening.</p>
<p>And the vast majority of the people</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t get vaccinations right now</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re afraid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for any other reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they have an agenda.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying it is there is a small number of people</p>
<p>that they have made business for them</p>
<p>to profit from this anxiety.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>I have been arrested by FBI.</p>
<p>This is what someone wrote.</p>
<p>I read it, I laughed.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, this is where they take it.</p>
<p>There was a reason why they wrote it that.</p>
<p>The Pfizer CEO was arrested by the FBI</p>
<p>because they want to create doubts</p>
<p>in the minds of the people that they&rsquo;re afraid</p>
<p>and say, look, if the FBI arrested him,</p>
<p>likely I will not do the vaccine.</p>
<p>But I laughed.</p>
<p>A week later, the wife of the Pfizer CEO died.</p>
<p>There is a picture in this website of my wife.</p>
<p>Someone sends to me, now I&rsquo;m pissed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not laughing.</p>
<p>I tried to find my kids to tell them,</p>
<p>if you read something, mom is fine.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>Then I remember that she has very old parents back in Greece.</p>
<p>We start calling them to making sure</p>
<p>because so you know that that will be picked up</p>
<p>by Greek newspapers and they will publish it, okay?</p>
<p>They are those people that wrote these things.</p>
<p>They know very well that my wife didn&rsquo;t die</p>
<p>and died because she was vaccinated, right?</p>
<p>So this is the narratives that they are on purpose forming</p>
<p>to profit from the stress and the anxiety of good people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I have to kind of,</p>
<p>people that listen to this, that kind of doubt institutions,</p>
<p>I do also want to say that there&rsquo;s quite a few folks</p>
<p>who realize they can make money from saying,</p>
<p>the man is lying to you.</p>
<p>The government is lying to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all corrupt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a scam.</p>
<p>Big pharma is lying to you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re manipulating you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised at how much money can be made with that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>So you have to, just as people use their common sense</p>
<p>to be skeptical when listening to politicians</p>
<p>and powerful figures, they should be skeptical</p>
<p>to also when listening to sort of the conspiracy theorists</p>
<p>or not even the conspiracy theorists,</p>
<p>but people who raise questions about institutions.</p>
<p>Think on your own, think critically with an open mind</p>
<p>that everyone can be manipulating you,</p>
<p>but also everybody has the capacity to do good.</p>
<p>And I think science in its pure form,</p>
<p>not when entangled with institutions is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>And in the hands of many companies,</p>
<p>it is a beautiful thing at scale.</p>
<p>Still, you have a lot of incentive</p>
<p>as having created the vaccine at Pfizer,</p>
<p>this incredible technology to sing it praises.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of, you know, people are skeptical,</p>
<p>like how much do we trust,</p>
<p>how excited Albert is about this vaccine.</p>
<p>So for example, I mean, not to do a Shakespearean analysis</p>
<p>of your Twitter, but I think he tweeted something</p>
<p>about a study with a 100% efficacy of the vaccine</p>
<p>or in stopping and transmission or something like that.</p>
<p>Do you regret sort of being like over representing</p>
<p>the effectiveness of the vaccine,</p>
<p>technically saying correct things,</p>
<p>but just kind of like highlighting the super positive things</p>
<p>that may be misinterpreted, you know, saying 100%?</p>
<p>No, I never said something 100%.</p>
<p>Every time I speak, if a number is 100%,</p>
<p>I rush to say that in biology, there is nothing 100%</p>
<p>because always there will be</p>
<p>when you go to the millions, okay?</p>
<p>There were in the study things that were 100%,</p>
<p>for example, deaths or in South Africa.</p>
<p>When we tried, there was 100% efficacy.</p>
<p>Clearly, it&rsquo;s more numbers.</p>
<p>When the numbers will become much bigger,</p>
<p>the 100% will not hold, but will be 95, 96.</p>
<p>So still the direction of this is the point.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very, very careful what I tweet.</p>
<p>And in addition to how careful I am,</p>
<p>I have people that they are looking at</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re having second or third opinions</p>
<p>to make sure that we don&rsquo;t put, why?</p>
<p>Because I know that people are listening to me right now,</p>
<p>everything I say, and I want to make sure</p>
<p>that they continue not only being clear</p>
<p>as to what I want to say, so there are no misunderstandings,</p>
<p>but also I maintain the trust of the people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that someone who only cherry picks information</p>
<p>and only emphasizes positive things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s someone that is the one to be trusted.</p>
<p>And I want me and Pfizer to be trusted.</p>
<p>So many felt the vaccine was presented as a cure</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t require regular booster shots.</p>
<p>Was that something you believed early on?</p>
<p>Did you always believe that many regular shots</p>
<p>would be required?</p>
<p>And maybe in a bigger picture,</p>
<p>how many do you think this will, for the Pfizer vaccine,</p>
<p>is it something you see that&rsquo;s taking a booster shot</p>
<p>regularly, like annually?</p>
<p>Yes, in the beginning when we had the first months</p>
<p>with the vaccine, people would ask me,</p>
<p>do we need another one?</p>
<p>And I said, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I was very clear about it.</p>
<p>Then around April, May, I start seeing the first data</p>
<p>and I made statements that I think we will need a booster</p>
<p>around eight to 12 months after the second dose.</p>
<p>And then after that, annually vaccinations,</p>
<p>this is what I said,</p>
<p>believe is one of the most likely scenarios.</p>
<p>And it was based on the data that I had,</p>
<p>but then Delta came.</p>
<p>And because I always making the caveat</p>
<p>that with absent a new variant with everything we know.</p>
<p>With Delta, it was proven that we need the booster</p>
<p>to move to the three, to the six months.</p>
<p>And this is what happened.</p>
<p>And I still said, I think the booster is a six months.</p>
<p>And then I think it will be an annual revaccination likely.</p>
<p>We have to monitor to see the data,</p>
<p>but this is the likely scenario.</p>
<p>Now we have Omicron.</p>
<p>And Omicron says that two doses might be challenging.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly yet, but three doses work.</p>
<p>So clearly a lot of countries already started moving now</p>
<p>the third dose, not from six months to three.</p>
<p>So that they will reduce the period</p>
<p>that people will not be protected with the third dose.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know with Omicron if how long this will last.</p>
<p>And frankly, I don&rsquo;t know if we will need a new vaccine</p>
<p>tailor made to Omicron based on everything we know so far.</p>
<p>We are monitoring and we will know way more</p>
<p>in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>If there is a need for a new vaccine, we will have it.</p>
<p>And if there is a need for mass production</p>
<p>of this new vaccine, I can also feel very comfortable</p>
<p>that we will not lose any of our capacity</p>
<p>that we have developed.</p>
<p>Right now we are running at 1 billion almost approximately</p>
<p>doses per quarter, four per year.</p>
<p>And if we have to switch and have half of that</p>
<p>in the new, half of that in the old,</p>
<p>we will do still 4 billion doses.</p>
<p>So I think the world should feel very, very comfortable</p>
<p>that if there is a need, we will be ahead of the virus.</p>
<p>Yeah, you did, you delivered or produced 3 billion</p>
<p>this year vaccines and you&rsquo;re on track</p>
<p>to do 4 billion next year.</p>
<p>I mean, if we had a lot more time,</p>
<p>we would talk about how the heck you achieve</p>
<p>that kind of scale, it&rsquo;s truly incredible.</p>
<p>Let me ask the policy question.</p>
<p>What are your feelings about vaccine mandates</p>
<p>in terms of, do you think the most effective way</p>
<p>to vaccinate the population is to acquire it?</p>
<p>Or do you go with the American way</p>
<p>and give people the freedom to choose?</p>
<p>I think it is a very difficult topic</p>
<p>and a very difficult decision for whoever needs to make it.</p>
<p>And clearly it&rsquo;s not me.</p>
<p>It is the public health officials of every country</p>
<p>that they have to make this decision.</p>
<p>I have to make the decision for Pfizer employees.</p>
<p>And I had to balance the fear of those that they work,</p>
<p>that they want to feel that the others are vaccinated</p>
<p>and the fear of those that they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>And eventually I came to the decision</p>
<p>that we will mandate it at Pfizer.</p>
<p>We are flexible, we are giving exceptions,</p>
<p>of course for health, maybe some religions,</p>
<p>but we decided to mandate it.</p>
<p>Now, at Pfizer, when we did this decision,</p>
<p>we were at 90% vaccination rates</p>
<p>when we said we are going to mandate it.</p>
<p>And that took it up to 96.</p>
<p>It works, right?</p>
<p>This 10% was never going to move, I felt.</p>
<p>Because no matter what, you have a small number of people</p>
<p>that really are scared.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t feel comfortable to do it, okay?</p>
<p>It worked in our case, we took it to 96%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy for those people.</p>
<p>A lot will not disease and some will not die</p>
<p>of those people.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not me to say, because the debate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s serious debate.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of pros and cons</p>
<p>if you need to push people,</p>
<p>if you need to give them the freedom.</p>
<p>And it comes with the territory.</p>
<p>If you are elected to run a country,</p>
<p>you should be ready to make difficult decisions.</p>
<p>And no matter what decision you make,</p>
<p>there will be fake stories written about you</p>
<p>as we talked about.</p>
<p>You will not be able to please everyone.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, let me just say that I think,</p>
<p>again, coming from the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>I think at the public level, at the federal level,</p>
<p>mandates is a really bad idea.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s good for the health of the populace,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about preserving the freedom</p>
<p>is really powerful about this country.</p>
<p>Like doing the hard work of convincing people</p>
<p>to get vaccinated, to choose to get vaccinated</p>
<p>if they want, but still have the freedom not to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really powerful freedom.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s super lazy to mandate.</p>
<p>People should understand the science</p>
<p>and want to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Do you think children need to get vaccinated?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I do think that they need to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>So age ranges five to 16.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of parents</p>
<p>that fear for the wellbeing of their children.</p>
<p>Can you empathize with those parents?</p>
<p>Can you steel man their arguments</p>
<p>against the vaccine for their children?</p>
<p>You know, because people know who I am.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to interact with parents</p>
<p>before that was, let&rsquo;s say, approved.</p>
<p>And there were so many, way more,</p>
<p>that I had a lot of empathy</p>
<p>because they were afraid for their kids</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t have a vaccine.</p>
<p>And they were the ones that were speaking at that time.</p>
<p>Bring me vaccine.</p>
<p>When are you going to bring me a vaccine?</p>
<p>I really fear.</p>
<p>I feel that this is unfair,</p>
<p>but I am protected.</p>
<p>My husband is protected.</p>
<p>My old son is protected.</p>
<p>And my little sweetheart,</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s below the age, is not protected.</p>
<p>Now that we have the vaccines,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that those that they are afraid of the vaccine,</p>
<p>not of the disease,</p>
<p>which are smaller number, admittedly.</p>
<p>Also, they will have, if they&rsquo;re afraid of them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that they will afraid even more about their kids</p>
<p>because they love, I would say,</p>
<p>more than they love themselves.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to be this situation.</p>
<p>And again, the same.</p>
<p>How can you do to demonstrate, to convince people,</p>
<p>to win the minds and the hearts of the people</p>
<p>that this is the right thing to do?</p>
<p>What do you think about that calculation?</p>
<p>Because the risk for kids is very low.</p>
<p>Kids do die.</p>
<p>Kids do go to the hospital from COVID.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But the rate is very low.</p>
<p>The rate is lower, but kids, they do die.</p>
<p>And how can you say that I&rsquo;m not going to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to protect a kid</p>
<p>for something that it is likely to happen?</p>
<p>And it is not only that.</p>
<p>What happens in the school</p>
<p>when they stop the education process</p>
<p>because a kid got the disease</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have vaccines so that they can control.</p>
<p>It is such a big disruption</p>
<p>and such a big risk for the health of the kids</p>
<p>that it shouldn&rsquo;t be a debate.</p>
<p>Look, how many kids are having polio right now?</p>
<p>Way fewer number than those</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re having COVID in the hospital.</p>
<p>But everybody&rsquo;s getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>Well, polio was deadlier for kids.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not now.</p>
<p>So why a kid to do it now?</p>
<p>Because it needs to be protected.</p>
<p>Well, the unique thing about the COVID vaccine</p>
<p>is a new type of technology too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an extra concern.</p>
<p>Choosing to vaccinate a child,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making a choice that can potentially hurt them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way parents that are hesitant</p>
<p>about the vaccine think.</p>
<p>I think choosing to vaccinate children makes a choice</p>
<p>so that something could not potentially hurt them,</p>
<p>which is the disease.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we are doing vaccinations since ever.</p>
<p>I know that there are people</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re concerned for themselves and for their kids.</p>
<p>What I know it is that I&rsquo;m a scientist and I&rsquo;m a parent.</p>
<p>And I am telling you that vaccines</p>
<p>is a very good thing for kids.</p>
<p>And thank God we were able to develop.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked quite a bit about the vaccine,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an incredible new technology</p>
<p>that Pfizer is developing</p>
<p>with the PaxLovid antiviral for COVID.</p>
<p>Where does that stand?</p>
<p>How does that work?</p>
<p>And how are you able to develop it in four months?</p>
<p>Like you said, and all of that in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>First of all, what this is about,</p>
<p>this is a real game changer.</p>
<p>This is a course of treatment</p>
<p>that you get only if you get the disease, you get COVID.</p>
<p>Then what happens is that you will take for five days,</p>
<p>pills day and night, and twice a day for five days.</p>
<p>And instead of 10 people from those that disease</p>
<p>to go to hospital, only one will go.</p>
<p>This is an end with all the caveats</p>
<p>that the numbers are small, no one died.</p>
<p>It was 100% efficacy on deaths.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m sure that in real world,</p>
<p>when the numbers are getting very high,</p>
<p>we may have 99 instead of 100.</p>
<p>But these are spectacular results</p>
<p>for something that you can take home and stay home.</p>
<p>The biggest problem right now in Europe, in the US,</p>
<p>when we have surges,</p>
<p>every time that we have a surge of COVID,</p>
<p>it is that the ICUs are full,</p>
<p>the hospitals are paralyzed,</p>
<p>they have to postpone elective surgeries,</p>
<p>they have to postpone other operations</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have the capacity because of that.</p>
<p>Keeping people out of the hospitals, home,</p>
<p>keeping people without dying,</p>
<p>it is something that I didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>And this is a significant, significant game changer.</p>
<p>I have to ask a controversial, difficult question.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about ivermectin?</p>
<p>Has it sufficiently been studied?</p>
<p>Has Pfizer considered it in its, like I said,</p>
<p>incredible development of the antiviral</p>
<p>as a comparator or that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Just investigate it in general.</p>
<p>The reason I bring it up,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve read quite a few criticisms of people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been some comparisons</p>
<p>of paxilovir to the ivermectin,</p>
<p>and I think people should look up.</p>
<p>There is Dr. John Campbell that describes that comparison</p>
<p>and makes that claim,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s quite a lot of people that debunk</p>
<p>or argue against that.</p>
<p>You can do your own research,</p>
<p>but there is a lot of people that kind of see</p>
<p>this free drug without patents on it</p>
<p>and say this could be the savior.</p>
<p>So can you just speak to that comparison?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time.</p>
<p>If you remember, there were other compounds</p>
<p>that were claimed that they are the solution to COVID,</p>
<p>and clearly they were proving that they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>There are compounds that are solutions</p>
<p>and compounds that are not.</p>
<p>I, as a scientist, and I discuss with our scientists,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t see any reason why a medicine like ivermectin,</p>
<p>which is a parasitic site,</p>
<p>to be able to act on COVID,</p>
<p>and so they don&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s any connection,</p>
<p>and they haven&rsquo;t seen any paper</p>
<p>that describes someone that used it that had any results.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there will be some people that will claim,</p>
<p>because people are claiming anything,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that there was any paper</p>
<p>in any peer review magazine,</p>
<p>any reliable scientific magazine, to support this claim.</p>
<p>So we are focusing on saving people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>We are not focusing on craziness.</p>
<p>Well, to push back, there is quite a lot of papers,</p>
<p>but the studies are small,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no conclusive evidence, and that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen any that it is reliable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where are these, small or big, reliable.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen any.</p>
<p>Well, some of the big ones have been retracted,</p>
<p>which means they weren&rsquo;t legitimate.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, so?</p>
<p>This is definitely something that people need to look into,</p>
<p>the people that kind of question</p>
<p>are the effectiveness of ivermectin,</p>
<p>definitely something to think about,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s the reason that past public.</p>
<p>It was chloroquine alone before.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For God&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why PaxLovid.</p>
<p>How many people died because of that?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the dangerous thing.</p>
<p>This is the sad thing.</p>
<p>PaxLovid has been studying thousands of people</p>
<p>and will be under the scrutiny, not only of regulators,</p>
<p>but as we will go into the implementation,</p>
<p>as it happened in many countries,</p>
<p>they will monitor to see what&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that whatever we do, once it is out there,</p>
<p>within a few weeks, they will know all hospitals,</p>
<p>if it works or not, because they will see the statistics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through one of the more difficult periods</p>
<p>in recent human history over the past two years,</p>
<p>like as a society.</p>
<p>What gives you hope about the future</p>
<p>for our human civilization?</p>
<p>You look into the next few years.</p>
<p>I think the human ingenuity.</p>
<p>I think although there is,</p>
<p>the world always is progressing,</p>
<p>although there are a lot of things</p>
<p>that need to be fixed in the society of 2020.</p>
<p>The society of 2020 is better at large</p>
<p>than things 50 years back, 100 years back,</p>
<p>in all different aspects, from poverty,</p>
<p>for human rights, from science,</p>
<p>from quality of life, from any aspect.</p>
<p>I am positive that humans can create</p>
<p>and always create a better future</p>
<p>and will continue doing so.</p>
<p>You have helped save the lives of millions of people,</p>
<p>helped improve the quality of their lives,</p>
<p>but you yourself are just one biological organism</p>
<p>with an expiration date.</p>
<p>Do you ponder your mortality?</p>
<p>Do you think about your death?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting question.</p>
<p>I was discussing with a lot of people</p>
<p>that I was fearless of death, I couldn&rsquo;t care less,</p>
<p>when I was young.</p>
<p>The first time that I start feeling</p>
<p>that I want to be around was when I had kids.</p>
<p>And then I started feeling that,</p>
<p>oh gosh, I hope I will be around to see their wedding.</p>
<p>I hope they will be around to see their children.</p>
<p>So if there is something that scares me,</p>
<p>the possibility I will not be part of their lives anymore</p>
<p>and I will not be watching.</p>
<p>I hope there is life upstairs,</p>
<p>so I will be able to watch them from there.</p>
<p>From upstairs, get a nice overview.</p>
<p>Let me ask the big ridiculous question.</p>
<p>And you only have two minutes or less to answer it.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>You said ingenuity is the thing that gives you hope.</p>
<p>We seem to be all busy trying to help each other,</p>
<p>trying to build a better world.</p>
<p>Why are we doing that?</p>
<p>I would repeat something that Steve Jobs has said.</p>
<p>Death is life&rsquo;s biggest invention.</p>
<p>It eliminates the old and gives place to the new.</p>
<p>Life is all about moving forward.</p>
<p>Life is all about creating new things.</p>
<p>And maybe everyone is a contributor,</p>
<p>but no one is the owner.</p>
<p>And always creating something new.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>Adding something beautiful into the world,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit of love.</p>
<p>Hopefully.</p>
<p>Albert, thank you so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor that you go through</p>
<p>some of these difficult questions with me today</p>
<p>and that you give your extremely valuable time</p>
<p>for this conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest and I&rsquo;m happy,</p>
<p>as I was telling you before,</p>
<p>but I can brag with my kids that I was in your podcast</p>
<p>because you are their hero.</p>
<p>You made it.</p>
<p>I made it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Albert Burla.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde.</p>
<p>The truth is rarely pure and never simple.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
