    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Sam Harris.</p>
<p>Dr. Sam Harris did his undergraduate training</p>
<p>in philosophy at Stanford University,</p>
<p>and then went on to do his doctorate in neuroscience</p>
<p>at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>He is well-known as an author</p>
<p>who has written about everything</p>
<p>from meditation to consciousness, free will,</p>
<p>and he holds many strong political views</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s voiced on social media</p>
<p>and in the content of various books</p>
<p>as they relate to philosophy and neuroscience.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I mainly talked to Dr. Harris about his views</p>
<p>and practices related to meditation,</p>
<p>consciousness, and free will.</p>
<p>In fact, he made several important points</p>
<p>about what a proper meditation practice can accomplish.</p>
<p>Prior to this episode,</p>
<p>I thought that meditation</p>
<p>was about deliberately changing one&rsquo;s conscious experience</p>
<p>in order to achieve things such as deeper relaxation,</p>
<p>a heightened sense of focus or ability to focus generally,</p>
<p>elevated memory, and so on.</p>
<p>What Sam taught me and what you&rsquo;ll soon learn as well</p>
<p>is that while meditation does indeed hold</p>
<p>all of those valuable benefits,</p>
<p>the main value of a meditation practice,</p>
<p>or perhaps the greater value of a meditation practice</p>
<p>is that it doesn&rsquo;t just allow one</p>
<p>to change their conscious experience,</p>
<p>but it actually can allow a human being</p>
<p>to view consciousness itself,</p>
<p>that is to understand what the process of consciousness is.</p>
<p>And in doing so, to profoundly shift the way</p>
<p>that one engages with the world and with oneself</p>
<p>in all practices, all environments, and at all times,</p>
<p>both in sleep and in waking states.</p>
<p>And in that way, making meditation</p>
<p>perhaps the most potent and important portal</p>
<p>by which one can access novel ways of thinking and being</p>
<p>and viewing one&rsquo;s life experience.</p>
<p>We also discussed the so-called mind-body problem</p>
<p>and issues of duality and free will,</p>
<p>concepts from philosophy and neuroscience</p>
<p>that fortunately, thanks to valuable experiments</p>
<p>and deep thinking on the part of people</p>
<p>like Dr. Sam Harris and others,</p>
<p>is now leading people to understand</p>
<p>really what free will is and isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>where the locus of free will likely sits in the brain</p>
<p>if it indeed resides in the brain at all,</p>
<p>and what it means to be a conscious being</p>
<p>and how we can modify our conscious states</p>
<p>in ways that allow us to be more functional.</p>
<p>We also discussed perception, both visual perception,</p>
<p>auditory perception, and especially interesting to me,</p>
<p>and I think as well, hopefully to you, time perception,</p>
<p>which we know is very elastic in the brain.</p>
<p>The literal frame rate by which we process</p>
<p>our conscious experience can expand</p>
<p>and contract dramatically depending on our state of mind</p>
<p>and how conscious we are about our state of mind.</p>
<p>So we went deep into that topic as well.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s discussion was indeed an intellectual deep dive</p>
<p>into all the topics that I mentioned a few moments ago,</p>
<p>but it also included many practical tools.</p>
<p>In fact, I pushed Sam to share with us</p>
<p>what his specific practices are</p>
<p>and how we can all arrive at a clearer</p>
<p>and better understanding of a meditation practice</p>
<p>that we can each and all apply</p>
<p>so that we can derive these incredible benefits,</p>
<p>not just the ones related to stress and focus</p>
<p>and enhanced memory,</p>
<p>but the ones that relate to our consciousness,</p>
<p>that is to our deeper sense of self and to others.</p>
<p>Several times during today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I mentioned the Waking Up app.</p>
<p>The Waking Up app was developed by Sam Harris,</p>
<p>but I want to emphasize that my mention of the app</p>
<p>is in no way a paid promotional.</p>
<p>Rather, the Waking Up app is one that I&rsquo;ve used</p>
<p>for some period of time now and find very, very useful.</p>
<p>I have family members that also use it,</p>
<p>other staff members here at the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>use it because we find it to be such a powerful tool.</p>
<p>Sam has generously offered Huberman Lab Podcast listeners</p>
<p>a 30-day completely free trial of the Waking Up app.</p>
<p>If any of you want to try it,</p>
<p>you can simply go to wakingup.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get that 30-day free trial.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t just talk about meditation,</p>
<p>consciousness, and free will.</p>
<p>We also talked about psychedelics,</p>
<p>both their therapeutic applications</p>
<p>for the treatment of things like depression and PTSD,</p>
<p>but also the use of psychedelics</p>
<p>and we discussed Sam&rsquo;s experiences with psychedelics</p>
<p>as they relate to expanding one&rsquo;s consciousness.</p>
<p>I also asked Sam about his views and practices</p>
<p>related to social media,</p>
<p>prompted in no small part by his recent voluntary decision</p>
<p>to close down his Twitter account.</p>
<p>So we talked about his rationale for doing that,</p>
<p>how he feels about doing that,</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;ll find that to be very interesting as well.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Levels.</p>
<p>Levels is a program that lets you see</p>
<p>how different foods and behaviors affect your health</p>
<p>by giving you real-time feedback</p>
<p>using a continuous glucose monitor.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors</p>
<p>in your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>are your blood sugar levels,</p>
<p>and not just your overall blood sugar levels,</p>
<p>but your blood sugar levels throughout the day</p>
<p>in response to different foods you eat,</p>
<p>to fasting, if you&rsquo;re into fasting,</p>
<p>to exercise, and so forth.</p>
<p>I started using Levels some time ago</p>
<p>in order to figure out how different foods</p>
<p>impact my blood sugar levels,</p>
<p>and indeed, it does that very well.</p>
<p>It allowed me to see how certain foods</p>
<p>really spike my blood sugar and others keep it more level,</p>
<p>and in particular, how foods that I eat after exercise</p>
<p>can help raise my blood glucose just enough,</p>
<p>but not so much that then I get a crash</p>
<p>two or three hours later,</p>
<p>which is what was happening before I started using Levels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made certain adjustments to my diet.</p>
<p>I can now eat post-exercise</p>
<p>and still have plenty of energy throughout the day</p>
<p>without any issue.</p>
<p>It also has helped me understand</p>
<p>how different behaviors impact my blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about Levels</p>
<p>and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,</p>
<p>go to levels.link slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s levels.link spelled L-I-N-K slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by WOOP.</p>
<p>WOOP is a fitness wearable device</p>
<p>that tracks your daily activity and sleep,</p>
<p>but goes beyond activity and sleep tracking</p>
<p>to provide real-time feedback</p>
<p>on how to adjust your training and sleep schedules</p>
<p>in order to feel and perform better.</p>
<p>Six months ago, I started working with WOOP</p>
<p>as a member of their scientific advisory council</p>
<p>as a way to help WOOP advance their mission</p>
<p>of unlocking human performance.</p>
<p>And as a WOOP user, I&rsquo;ve experienced firsthand</p>
<p>the health benefits of their technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear based on quality research</p>
<p>that WOOP can inform you how well you&rsquo;re sleeping,</p>
<p>how to change your sleep habits,</p>
<p>how to change your activity habits,</p>
<p>even how to modify different aspects of your nutrition,</p>
<p>exercise, sleep, and lifestyle</p>
<p>in order to maximize your mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re an athlete</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re exercising simply for health,</p>
<p>WOOP can really help you understand</p>
<p>how your body functions under different conditions</p>
<p>and how to really program your schedule,</p>
<p>nutrition, and exercise,</p>
<p>and many other factors of your life</p>
<p>in order to really optimize your health and performance,</p>
<p>including your cognition.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in trying WOOP,</p>
<p>you can go to joinWOOP spelled W-H-O-O-P.com slash Huberman.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the fact that sleep is the fundamental layer</p>
<p>of mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Now, one of the key things</p>
<p>for getting a great night&rsquo;s sleep every single night</p>
<p>is to optimize the temperature of your sleeping environment.</p>
<p>Put simply, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep,</p>
<p>your body temperature needs to drop</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>And waking up, on the other hand,</p>
<p>involves a heating of your body</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>With Eight Sleep, you can tune the temperature</p>
<p>of your mattress cover or mattress</p>
<p>to be cooler or hotter,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you tend to run</p>
<p>too hot or too cold.</p>
<p>And you can even vary it across the night</p>
<p>so that you can access the best deep sleep</p>
<p>early in the night,</p>
<p>the so-called REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more pronounced in the later half of the night.</p>
<p>And in doing so, really get your sleep optimized,</p>
<p>not just in terms of duration,</p>
<p>but in terms of quality</p>
<p>and the overall architecture of your sleep.</p>
<p>This has a profound influence</p>
<p>on your alertness, focus, mood,</p>
<p>and many other important factors throughout the day.</p>

<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Sam Harris.</p>
<p>Dr. Sam Harris.</p>
<p>We were just talking about this.</p>
<p>You are indeed a doctor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a scientist.</p>
<p>I cannot save your life,</p>
<p>but I might save your non-existent soul</p>
<p>if we talk long enough.</p>
<p>Well, neither of us are clinicians,</p>
<p>but we are both brain explorers</p>
<p>from the different perspectives, some overlapping.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really excited to have this conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to your voice for many years,</p>
<p>learning from you for many years.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t say that my father,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also a scientist,</p>
<p>is an enormous fan of your waking up app.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Has spent a lot of time over the last few years.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in his late seventies, he&rsquo;s almost 80.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a theoretical physicist.</p>
<p>Walking to the park near his apartment</p>
<p>and spending time meditating with the app</p>
<p>or sometimes separate from the app,</p>
<p>but using the same sorts of meditations in his head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he kind of toggles back and forth.</p>
<p>And even, I shouldn&rsquo;t say even, but yes,</p>
<p>even in his late seventies has reported</p>
<p>that it has significantly shifted his awareness of self</p>
<p>and his conscious experience of things happening</p>
<p>in and around him.</p>
<p>And he was somebody who I think already saw himself</p>
<p>as a pretty aware person,</p>
<p>thinking about quantum mechanics and the rest.</p>
<p>So a thank you from him indirectly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>A thank you from me now directly.</p>
<p>And I really want to use that as a way to frame up</p>
<p>what I think is one of the more interesting questions</p>
<p>in not just science and philosophy and psychology,</p>
<p>but all of life,</p>
<p>which is what is this thing that we call a self?</p>
<p>You know, as far as I know,</p>
<p>we have not localized the region in the brain</p>
<p>that can entirely account for our perception of self.</p>
<p>There are areas of course, that regulate proprioception,</p>
<p>you know, our awareness of where our limbs are in space,</p>
<p>maybe even our awareness of where we are in physical space.</p>
<p>There are such circuits as we both know.</p>
<p>But when we talk about sense of self,</p>
<p>I have to remember this kind of neuroscience 101 thing</p>
<p>that we always say, you know, when you teach memory,</p>
<p>you say, you know, you wake up every morning</p>
<p>and you remember who you are.</p>
<p>You know who you are.</p>
<p>Most people do.</p>
<p>Even if they lack memory systems in the brain</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>pretty much everyone seems to know who they are.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on what that whole thing is about?</p>
<p>Do we come into the world feeling that way?</p>
<p>I would appreciate answers from the perspective</p>
<p>of any field, including neuroscience, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, big question.</p>
<p>I mean, the problem is we use the term self</p>
<p>in so many different ways, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one sense of that term,</p>
<p>which is the target of meditation</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the target of deconstruction by the practice</p>
<p>and by just any surrounding philosophy.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll hear, and you&rsquo;ll hear it from me,</p>
<p>that this self is an illusion, right?</p>
<p>And that there&rsquo;s a psychological freedom</p>
<p>that can be experienced on the other side</p>
<p>of discovering it to be an illusion.</p>
<p>And some people don&rsquo;t like that framing.</p>
<p>Some people would insist that it&rsquo;s not so much an illusion,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a construct and it&rsquo;s not what it seems, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not that every use of the term self is illegitimate</p>
<p>and there are certain types of selves that are not illusory.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I&rsquo;m not saying that people are illusions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that you can&rsquo;t talk about yourself</p>
<p>as distinct, yourself as a whole person</p>
<p>and, you know, as psychological continuity</p>
<p>with your past experience as being distinct</p>
<p>from the person and psychological continuity</p>
<p>of some other person, right?</p>
<p>Obviously we have to be able to conserve those data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fundamentally mysterious</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna wake up tomorrow morning</p>
<p>still being psychologically continuous</p>
<p>with your past and not my past, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, if we swapped lives, you know,</p>
<p>that would demand some explanation.</p>
<p>So the illusoriness of the self doesn&rsquo;t cut against</p>
<p>any of those obvious facts.</p>
<p>So the sense of self that is illusory,</p>
<p>and again, we might wanna talk about self in other modes</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just a lot of interest there</p>
<p>psychologically and ultimately scientifically.</p>
<p>But the thing that doesn&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>it certainly doesn&rsquo;t exist as it seems.</p>
<p>And I would wanna argue that it actually</p>
<p>is just a proper illusion,</p>
<p>is the sense that there is a subject interior to experience</p>
<p>in addition to experience.</p>
<p>So most people feel like they&rsquo;re having an experience</p>
<p>of the world and they&rsquo;re having an experience</p>
<p>of their bodies in the world.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>they feel that they are a subject internal to the body</p>
<p>and are very likely in the head.</p>
<p>Most people feel like they&rsquo;re behind their face</p>
<p>as a kind of locus of awareness and thought and intention.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re a passenger inside your body.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t feel identical to their bodies</p>
<p>and they can imagine,</p>
<p>and this is sort of the origin, the psychological origin,</p>
<p>you know, the folk psychological origin of a sense</p>
<p>that there might be a soul</p>
<p>that could survive the death of the body.</p>
<p>I mean, most people are what my friend Paul Bloom calls</p>
<p>common sense dualists, right?</p>
<p>The default expectation seems to be that</p>
<p>whatever the relationship between the mind and the body,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some promise of separability there, right?</p>
<p>And whenever you really push hard on the science side</p>
<p>and say, well, no, no, the mind is really just</p>
<p>what the brain is doing,</p>
<p>that begins to feel more and more counterintuitive to people</p>
<p>and there still seems some residual mystery that, you know,</p>
<p>at death, maybe something is gonna lift off the brain</p>
<p>and go elsewhere, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense of dualism that many people have</p>
<p>and obviously that&rsquo;s supported by many religious beliefs.</p>
<p>But this feeling, it&rsquo;s a very peculiar starting point.</p>
<p>People feel that, you know,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t feel identical to their experience, right?</p>
<p>As a matter of experience,</p>
<p>they feel like they&rsquo;re on the edge of experience,</p>
<p>somehow appropriating it from the side.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of on the edge of the world</p>
<p>and the world is out there.</p>
<p>Your body is in some sense, an object in the world,</p>
<p>which you, you know, it&rsquo;s different from the world.</p>
<p>You know, the boundary of your skin is still meaningful.</p>
<p>You can sort of loosely control your body.</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t control,</p>
<p>you can control your gross and subtle, you know,</p>
<p>voluntary motor movements, but you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not controlling everything your body is doing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not controlling your heartbeat and your, you know,</p>
<p>your hormonal secretions and all of that.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>that is in the dark for you.</p>
<p>And then you give someone an instruction to meditate, say,</p>
<p>and you say, okay, well,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s examine all of this from the first person&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look for this thing you&rsquo;re calling I.</p>
<p>And again, I is not identical to the body.</p>
<p>People feel like their hands are out there</p>
<p>and if they&rsquo;re going to meditate,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to close their eyes, very likely.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re going to pay attention to something.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to pay attention to the breath or the sounds.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s from the point of view of being a locus of attention</p>
<p>that is now aiming attention strategically at an object</p>
<p>like the breath, that there&rsquo;s this dualism that is set up.</p>
<p>And ultimately the ultimate promise of meditation,</p>
<p>I mean, there are really two levels</p>
<p>at which you could be interested in meditation.</p>
<p>One is, you know, very straightforward and remedial</p>
<p>and non-paradoxical and very well subscribed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the usual set of claims</p>
<p>about all the benefits you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>from meditation, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to lower your stress</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to increase your focus</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to, you know, stave off cortical thinning</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all kinds of good things</p>
<p>that science is saying meditation will give you.</p>
<p>And none of that entails really drilling down</p>
<p>on this paradoxical claim that the self is an illusion</p>
<p>or anything else of that sort.</p>
<p>But from my point of view, the real purpose of meditation</p>
<p>and its real promise is not in this long list of benefits.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not discounting any of those,</p>
<p>though, you know, the science for many of them</p>
<p>is quite provisional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in this deeper claim that if you look</p>
<p>for this thing you&rsquo;re calling I,</p>
<p>if you look for the sense that there&rsquo;s a thinker</p>
<p>in addition to the mirror rising of the next thought, say,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t find that thing.</p>
<p>And you can, what&rsquo;s more, you can not find it</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s conclusive and that matters, right?</p>
<p>And it has a, there&rsquo;s a host of benefits</p>
<p>that follow from that discovery,</p>
<p>which are quite a bit deeper and more interesting</p>
<p>than engaging meditation on the side of its benefits,</p>
<p>you know, de-stressing, increasing focus and all the rest.</p>
<p>I have a number of questions related to what you just said.</p>
<p>And first of all, I agree that the evidence</p>
<p>that meditation can improve focus, reduce stress, et cetera,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s not an enormous pile of evidence,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s growing.</p>
<p>And I think that especially for some</p>
<p>of the shorter meditations,</p>
<p>which I these days view more as perceptual exercises,</p>
<p>you know, talked about this on the podcast before,</p>
<p>but for those that haven&rsquo;t heard it before about,</p>
<p>you know, perception, you can have exteroception,</p>
<p>extending to things beyond the confines of your skin,</p>
<p>interoception, which is also includes the surfaces</p>
<p>of the skin, but everything inward.</p>
<p>And meditation through eyes closed,</p>
<p>typically involving some sort of attentional spotlighting,</p>
<p>something we&rsquo;ll get into,</p>
<p>to more interoceptive versus exteroceptive events,</p>
<p>et cetera, including thoughts.</p>
<p>And so I think of at a basic level,</p>
<p>meditation as a somewhat of a perceptual exercise.</p>
<p>You can tell me where you disagree there</p>
<p>and I would expect and hope that you would.</p>
<p>But I would like to just touch on this idea</p>
<p>that you brought up,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such an interesting one of this idea</p>
<p>that our bodies are containers</p>
<p>and that we somehow view ourselves as passengers</p>
<p>within those containers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly been my experience.</p>
<p>And the image that I have is of,</p>
<p>as you say that is of myself or of people out there</p>
<p>that sit a few centimeters below the surface</p>
<p>or that sit entirely in their head.</p>
<p>And of course the brain and body</p>
<p>are connected through the nervous system.</p>
<p>I think sometimes a brain is used to replace nervous system</p>
<p>and that can get us into trouble</p>
<p>in terms of coming up with real directions and definitions.</p>
<p>But the point is that there is something special</p>
<p>about the real estate in the head.</p>
<p>I think for as much as my laboratory</p>
<p>and many other scientists are really interested</p>
<p>in brain body connections through the nervous system</p>
<p>and other organ systems that the nervous system binds,</p>
<p>that if you cut off all my limbs, I&rsquo;m going to be different,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m fundamentally still Andrew.</p>
<p>Whereas if we were to lesion a couple of square millimeters</p>
<p>out of my parietal cortex,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an open question as to whether or not</p>
<p>I would still seem as much like Andrew</p>
<p>to other people and to myself even.</p>
<p>And so there is something fundamentally different</p>
<p>about the real estate in the cranial vault, right?</p>
<p>You can even remove both of my eyes, I&rsquo;d still be Andrew.</p>
<p>And those are two pieces of my central nervous system</p>
<p>that are fundamental to my daily life,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d still be me.</p>
<p>Whereas, and this doesn&rsquo;t, I think,</p>
<p>just apply to memory systems.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there are regions of the frontal cortex</p>
<p>that when destroyed have been shown to modify personality</p>
<p>and self-perception in dramatic ways.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a sort of obvious point once it&rsquo;s made,</p>
<p>but I do think it&rsquo;s worth highlighting</p>
<p>because there does seem to be something special</p>
<p>about being in the head.</p>
<p>The other thing is that sitting a few centimeters</p>
<p>below the surface or riding in this container</p>
<p>makes sense to me,</p>
<p>except I wonder if you&rsquo;ve ever experienced a shift</p>
<p>as I have when something very extreme happens.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the negative example of,</p>
<p>all of a sudden you&rsquo;re in a fear state.</p>
<p>All of a sudden it feels as if your entire body</p>
<p>is you or is me and now I need to get this thing,</p>
<p>the whole container and me to some place of safety</p>
<p>in whatever form.</p>
<p>This is also true, I think, in ecstatic states</p>
<p>where you can feel really, when people say embodied,</p>
<p>I wonder whether or not we normally oscillate</p>
<p>below the surface of our body.</p>
<p>When I say oscillate, I mean, in neural terms,</p>
<p>maybe our sensory experience is not truly</p>
<p>at the bodily surface, but sits below the bodily surface,</p>
<p>more at the level of organ systems and within our head.</p>
<p>And then certain things that jolt us,</p>
<p>our autonomic nervous system into heightened states,</p>
<p>bring us into states of, bring us closer to the surface</p>
<p>and therefore include all of us.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t want to take us down</p>
<p>a mechanistic description of something that doesn&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>but does any of that resonate</p>
<p>in terms of how you are thinking about</p>
<p>or describing the self?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot there.</p>
<p>First on the point of the brain being the locus</p>
<p>of what we are as minds.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there are people who will insist</p>
<p>that sort of the whole nervous system</p>
<p>has to be thought of as,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about our emotional life</p>
<p>and the insulus connection to the gut</p>
<p>and you just, the sense of self extends beyond the brain.</p>
<p>But I totally take your point</p>
<p>that a brain transplant is a coherent idea</p>
<p>and you would expect to go with the brain</p>
<p>rather than with the viscera.</p>
<p>And so in that sense,</p>
<p>we really are the old philosophical thought experiment</p>
<p>of being a brain in a vat.</p>
<p>I mean, we essentially are already,</p>
<p>the vat is our skull and we&rsquo;re virtually in that situation.</p>
<p>The horrible movie, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but interrupt.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager,</p>
<p>my sister and I used to go to the movies</p>
<p>every once in a while.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d trade off who could pick the movie.</p>
<p>And she took me to see once the movie,</p>
<p>Boxing Helena, the David Lynch film.</p>
<p>I never saw that.</p>
<p>Where he amputates the limbs of a woman</p>
<p>who he&rsquo;s obsessed by and keeps her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really horrible film.</p>
<p>And about 20 minutes into it,</p>
<p>my sister just turned to me and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>And the question then was whether or not two siblings</p>
<p>should actually persist in a movie like that.</p>
<p>And we decided to persist in the movie</p>
<p>so that we could laugh about it later,</p>
<p>but it was rather disturbing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend the movie,</p>
<p>nor do I recommend seeing it with a sibling.</p>
<p>But in that movie that the woman,</p>
<p>he takes her as a container</p>
<p>and restricts her movement, right?</p>
<p>Quite sadistic and horrible thing, really.</p>
<p>David Lynch, interesting mind perhaps.</p>
<p>But the idea was that,</p>
<p>was to question how much of the person persists</p>
<p>in the absence of their ability to move, et cetera.</p>
<p>Could there be love?</p>
<p>Could there be these other affections?</p>
<p>Anyway, a rather extreme example,</p>
<p>but one that still haunts me</p>
<p>and I suppose I&rsquo;m thinking about still now, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, so just to follow that point,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot about us that we don&rsquo;t have access to</p>
<p>unless we enact it physically.</p>
<p>Like, if I ask you,</p>
<p>do you still know how to ride a bike, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no place in your memory where you can inspect</p>
<p>by just sitting in your chair</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve retained the knowledge</p>
<p>of how to ride a bike, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a procedural memory</p>
<p>is different from semantic or episodic memory.</p>
<p>If I asked you, do you know your address?</p>
<p>Yes, you can recall your address just sitting there.</p>
<p>But if you had had a micro stroke</p>
<p>that neatly dissected out your ability to ride a bike</p>
<p>and left everything else intact,</p>
<p>you might think you could ride a bike,</p>
<p>but suddenly you stand up next to one</p>
<p>and you have no idea what to do with it.</p>
<p>And that would be a discovery</p>
<p>that would only happen</p>
<p>if you were motorically engaged with that object.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we could probably come up with a hundred things about us</p>
<p>that really seem core to us</p>
<p>and are not separable from our personhood,</p>
<p>which seem to only get invoked</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re out there moving in the world</p>
<p>and we have limbs, et cetera.</p>
<p>And, but yeah, no, it&rsquo;s the seat of consciousness.</p>
<p>I mean, the right framework to talk about all of this</p>
<p>from my point of view is consciousness and its contents.</p>
<p>Right, so we have consciousness,</p>
<p>the fact that there&rsquo;s something that is like to be us,</p>
<p>right, the fact that the world</p>
<p>and our internal experience is illuminated,</p>
<p>that it has a qualitative character.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the question</p>
<p>of what is that qualitative character?</p>
<p>What is it, you know,</p>
<p>what kinds of information do we have access to?</p>
<p>What does it feel like to be us?</p>
<p>How do different states of arousal change that?</p>
<p>So you talked about fear.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, fear can change a lot of things,</p>
<p>but, and, you know, various neurological deficits,</p>
<p>or, you know, you can add drugs to the mix.</p>
<p>You add psychedelics that radically transform</p>
<p>the contents of consciousness.</p>
<p>From my point of view,</p>
<p>consciousness itself is simply the cognizance,</p>
<p>the awareness that is the floodlights</p>
<p>by which any of that stuff appears, right?</p>
<p>So consciousness doesn&rsquo;t change, but its contents change.</p>
<p>And to come back to meditation for a second,</p>
<p>many people think meditation</p>
<p>is about changing the contents of consciousness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some contents you wanna get rid of, like anxiety,</p>
<p>other contents you want to encourage,</p>
<p>like calm and, you know, unconditional love,</p>
<p>or, you know, some other, you know,</p>
<p>classically pleasant pro-social emotion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all fine, that&rsquo;s all possible.</p>
<p>But the real, you know, wisdom of, you know,</p>
<p>the 2000-year-old wisdom of meditation</p>
<p>that really is the, you know,</p>
<p>the chewy center of the tootsie pop</p>
<p>is a recognition of what consciousness itself</p>
<p>is always already like, regardless of the contents</p>
<p>and the changes in contents.</p>
<p>And this is why, I mean, we might talk about this,</p>
<p>but this is why they&rsquo;re mutually compatible.</p>
<p>Psychedelics and meditation for me are somewhat orthogonal</p>
<p>because psychedelics is all about making wholesale changes</p>
<p>to the contents of consciousness.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>some wonderful consequences of doing that.</p>
<p>There can be some harrowing</p>
<p>and terrifying consequences of doing that.</p>
<p>But generally speaking, I think, you know,</p>
<p>used wisely, they can be incredibly valuable</p>
<p>and the therapeutic potential there is enormous.</p>
<p>But the crucial disjunction here</p>
<p>is that there really is something to recognize</p>
<p>about ordinary waking consciousness,</p>
<p>that the consciousness that&rsquo;s compatible</p>
<p>with my driving a car to get here on time, right?</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t have to have the pyrotechnics</p>
<p>of being on LSD to see the,</p>
<p>to transcend the central illusion</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m saying is the thing to be transcended,</p>
<p>which is the sense that there is a duality</p>
<p>between subject and object in every moment of experience.</p>
<p>And to take it back to something you said</p>
<p>about just all of our different modes in ordinary life,</p>
<p>the interesting thing is I think people</p>
<p>are constantly losing their sense of self</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not aware of it.</p>
<p>And I mean, there&rsquo;s probably an analogy</p>
<p>to the visual system here,</p>
<p>which is to a visual saccades,</p>
<p>which perhaps you&rsquo;ve spoken about</p>
<p>at some point on your podcast.</p>
<p>Not enough, so please.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what happens with our, you know,</p>
<p>every time we move our eyes, this is called a saccade</p>
<p>and we do that about three times a second or so,</p>
<p>just normally, there is a, you know,</p>
<p>the region of motor cortex that affects that movement</p>
<p>sends what&rsquo;s called an efferent copy of that motor movement,</p>
<p>which is used as information that propagates back</p>
<p>to visual cortex that suppresses the data of vision</p>
<p>while the eyes are moving.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, if you weren&rsquo;t doing that,</p>
<p>every time you moved your eyes,</p>
<p>it would seem like the visual scene itself</p>
<p>was lurching around.</p>
<p>And people can experience this for themselves</p>
<p>if they just, you know, touch one of their eyeballs</p>
<p>on the side, you know, not all that hard</p>
<p>and kind of jiggle it, you know,</p>
<p>and then you can roll it around,</p>
<p>you can jiggle it from side to side.</p>
<p>You can see that a movement of the eyeball</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not governed by your ocular motor system</p>
<p>delivers a jiggling of the world,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not, your brain is not anticipating it</p>
<p>in the same way and it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not producing that same, you know,</p>
<p>predictive copy of the movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like,</p>
<p>we have some action sports filmers on our staff here,</p>
<p>that the gimbal, you know, that holds an iPhone,</p>
<p>like you see the kids on surfboards or skateboards</p>
<p>or something, they&rsquo;re going to hold a phone</p>
<p>while moving around, or the people who, the vloggers,</p>
<p>does anyone even still use that for his vlog?</p>
<p>Moving around and it&rsquo;s image stabilization, essentially,</p>
<p>that keeps the camera steady.</p>
<p>And these are more than cameras, of course,</p>
<p>for those listening, I&rsquo;m pointing at my eyes,</p>
<p>but they do far more than just what a camera would do.</p>
<p>But yeah, this internal system of image stabilization,</p>
<p>yeah, I can see perhaps where you&rsquo;re going with this,</p>
<p>that it allows us to remain in a self-referencing scheme</p>
<p>as opposed to sort of paying attention</p>
<p>to just how confusing it is to track the visual world</p>
<p>at some level.</p>
<p>Well, actually where I&rsquo;m going is that,</p>
<p>so people are having this suppression of vision</p>
<p>three times a second on average,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not experiencing it, right?</p>
<p>So like, you&rsquo;re literally like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re effectively going blind and you&rsquo;re not noticing it.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very fast.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s very fast.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s an analogous suppression, I would say,</p>
<p>of the sense of self that occurs every time attention</p>
<p>gets absorbed significantly in its object, right?</p>
<p>So like, we even have this concept of, you know,</p>
<p>losing yourself in your work or, you know, losing your,</p>
<p>I mean, the classic flow experiences have this quality</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s, and this tends to be</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re so rewarding, where there&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in some, you know, athletic activity</p>
<p>or, you know, an aesthetic one,</p>
<p>or you could be having sex or you could be,</p>
<p>whatever it is, some peak experience,</p>
<p>its peakness usually entails there being some brief period</p>
<p>where there was no distance between you</p>
<p>and the experience, right?</p>
<p>For that moment, you were no longer looking</p>
<p>over your own shoulder or anticipating the next moment</p>
<p>or trying to get somewhere where you weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>or, you know, micromanaging errors or like this,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s just the flow of unity</p>
<p>with whatever the, you know, whatever the experience is,</p>
<p>you know, a surfer on the wave, right?</p>
<p>And we love those experiences.</p>
<p>And then we are continually abstracted away from them</p>
<p>by our thinking about them.</p>
<p>Like we were thinking, oh my God, that was so good.</p>
<p>Or how do I get back to that?</p>
<p>Or, you know, you&rsquo;re looking at a sunset,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most beautiful sunset you&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re continually interrupting the experience</p>
<p>of merely seeing it with a commentary</p>
<p>about how amazing this is.</p>
<p>And I wonder, you know, what are real estate prices here?</p>
<p>I mean, is it possible that we could move here?</p>
<p>And like your mind is just continually narrating</p>
<p>a conversation you&rsquo;re having with yourself,</p>
<p>however paradoxically.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re telling yourself things</p>
<p>that you already know as though there were two of you</p>
<p>rather often, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, you&rsquo;re just, you know, I&rsquo;m looking for,</p>
<p>you know, which is the water?</p>
<p>And I say, oh, there it is, right?</p>
<p>But like, I&rsquo;m the one seeing it.</p>
<p>Who am I saying, oh, you know, there it is too.</p>
<p>As though there&rsquo;s someone else who needs to be informed</p>
<p>about the thing I already saw, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s something about our internal dialogue</p>
<p>that is paradoxical.</p>
<p>Is there any neurologic condition,</p>
<p>colosselectomy or anything like that</p>
<p>where somehow people feel more unified with the self</p>
<p>on a continual basis?</p>
<p>The observer and the actor within,</p>
<p>whether it stay more as a complete sentence,</p>
<p>is there any known neurological syndrome,</p>
<p>makes it sound like a bad thing, but it could be a good thing</p>
<p>whereby people feel that the actor and the observer</p>
<p>within them are unified continually.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a pathological one.</p>
<p>Some of the work on the default mode network</p>
<p>suggests that that&rsquo;s at least part of the story, right?</p>
<p>So the default mode network,</p>
<p>which has been talked about a lot of late</p>
<p>because it has come up both in the meditation literature</p>
<p>and in the psychedelic literature,</p>
<p>but its original discovery was that, you know,</p>
<p>and the reason why it was called the default mode</p>
<p>was that in virtually every neuroimaging experiment</p>
<p>ever run, they found that between tasks,</p>
<p>when the brain was just in its default state,</p>
<p>these midline structures would increase their activity</p>
<p>and then they would reliably diminish</p>
<p>whenever the person in the scanner was on task.</p>
<p>And usually that meant some kind of outward looking,</p>
<p>you know, visual discrimination task.</p>
<p>I mean, but it could be, you know, it could be visual,</p>
<p>it could be semantic, it could be,</p>
<p>but it tends to be their eyes are open</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re paying attention to something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being broadcast to them through,</p>
<p>you know, monitor goggles,</p>
<p>or, you know, they&rsquo;re looking at a mirror</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s showing them a computer monitor.</p>
<p>But the, so the general insight was</p>
<p>there are these midline structures in the brain</p>
<p>that seem to be increasing their activity</p>
<p>when the brain is just kind of idling between tasks,</p>
<p>waiting for something to happen.</p>
<p>And then further experiments found tasks</p>
<p>that actually up-regulated activity there beyond baseline.</p>
<p>And those tasks seem to be self-referential</p>
<p>so that when you ask people, you know,</p>
<p>you give them a list of words and you say,</p>
<p>well, do these, any of these apply to you, right?</p>
<p>You know, and so people, or you ask people to think about,</p>
<p>you know, actually in one experiment I did,</p>
<p>when you, you know, when you&rsquo;re challenging</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s beliefs, when you&rsquo;re challenging beliefs</p>
<p>that have more of a personal significance,</p>
<p>like political or religious beliefs,</p>
<p>you get an up-regulation in these regions</p>
<p>as opposed to just generic beliefs about, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in Los Angeles, this is the table,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s something to which, you know,</p>
<p>people are not, you know,</p>
<p>holding fast as a matter of identity.</p>
<p>So anyway, both meditation and psychedelics</p>
<p>seem to suppress activity in these regions,</p>
<p>which we know are associated with both self-talk,</p>
<p>mind-wandering and explicit acts of self-representation.</p>
<p>Right, so.</p>
<p>Could we say that they are somewhat autobiographical</p>
<p>because they access memory systems</p>
<p>and in the way you&rsquo;re describing them</p>
<p>and in the way that a colleague of mine</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been a guest on this podcast,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve interacted with him before,</p>
<p>but I think you&rsquo;d very much enjoy</p>
<p>whatever interaction you would have as David Spiegel,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s our Associate Chair of Psychiatry.</p>
<p>He and his father actually,</p>
<p>his father then he founded hypnosis</p>
<p>as a valid clinical practice in psychiatry.</p>
<p>And hypnosis, which is obviously</p>
<p>a heightened sense of attention with deep relaxation</p>
<p>is known to dramatically suppress the default mode network.</p>
<p>He talks about this a lot.</p>
<p>And I always wonder as we take down activity</p>
<p>within the default mode network,</p>
<p>what surfaces it in its place</p>
<p>and is what surfaces in its place,</p>
<p>does that somehow reflect</p>
<p>that the two are normally in a push-pull?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case, right?</p>
<p>When I fall asleep, I can hallucinate,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that during the day</p>
<p>the fact that I&rsquo;m looking at objects</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s preventing me from hallucinating.</p>
<p>If I close my eyes, I can get imagery,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this kind of a different illusion,</p>
<p>the illusion of antagonistic circuitry sometimes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to take us off course,</p>
<p>but the default mode network seems to,</p>
<p>want to be there, quote unquote.</p>
<p>It seems to be fighting for our attention</p>
<p>unless we give ourselves a visual target</p>
<p>or an auditory target or some salient experience</p>
<p>of some kind it sounds like.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m surprised to hear that meditation</p>
<p>reduces activity in the default mode network at some level</p>
<p>because meditation to me oftentimes involves</p>
<p>paying attention to some sort of perceptual target.</p>
<p>Maybe you could eventually explain</p>
<p>how it might do that or why it might.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the whole story</p>
<p>because obviously outward going attention is not,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re having the kind of egoic saccade</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m talking about where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually not clearly aware of yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not clearly defining yourself</p>
<p>as separate from experience</p>
<p>for the moment of paying attention.</p>
<p>So you are sort of losing yourself in your work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the same thing as having</p>
<p>the clear meditative insight of selflessness</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m claiming is the goal of meditation.</p>
<p>But there is a, you know, to wind back</p>
<p>to the original point I was making</p>
<p>and the reason why I drew the analogy to visual saccades,</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s a continuous interruption</p>
<p>in our sense of self that goes unrecognized.</p>
<p>And, but the conscious acquisition</p>
<p>of the understanding that the self is an illusion</p>
<p>is a different experience.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re then focusing on this absence.</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s another analogy to the visual system</p>
<p>that applies here, which is to the optic blind spot.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, so, which is a good analogy for me</p>
<p>because it cuts through a bunch of false assumption</p>
<p>as to where that you would look for this</p>
<p>or how this relates to ordinary experience.</p>
<p>So as many people know that we have in both eyes,</p>
<p>we have what&rsquo;s called the blind spot,</p>
<p>which is a consequence of the optic nerve</p>
<p>transiting through the retina.</p>
<p>I mean, unlike cephalopods, I think,</p>
<p>I mean, I think cephalopods have their optic nerve,</p>
<p>you know, as, you know, an omniscient being</p>
<p>would have engineered it connecting the retina from the back</p>
<p>and therefore there is no blinds,</p>
<p>the area of blindness associated with its transit</p>
<p>back through the retina.</p>
<p>But our-</p>
<p>Photoreceptors on the outside.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>Humans, for whatever reason, put photoreceptors,</p>
<p>well, I always say I wasn&rsquo;t consulted the design phase,</p>
<p>something put a photoreceptors combination of things,</p>
<p>but photoreceptors in the back.</p>
<p>And so you actually have to send the highway of information</p>
<p>through the pixel center of the eye.</p>
<p>Yeah, cephalopods and Drosophila,</p>
<p>basically invertebrates.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The design is more at its face logical.</p>
<p>Mammals, very illogical design,</p>
<p>at least as far as our judgments go.</p>
<p>But it gives me a good analogy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that also contains digestive enzymes and adaptogens.</p>
<p>I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s 10 years now of taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>every single day.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring this podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>So whether or not I&rsquo;m eating well or enough or not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;m covering all of my needs</p>
<p>for vitamins, minerals, probiotics,</p>
<p>adaptogens to combat stress,</p>
<p>and the digestive enzymes really help my digestion.</p>
<p>I just feel much better when I&rsquo;m drinking Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.</p>

<p>10 free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.</p>
<p>Vitamin D3 and K2 are vital for immune function,</p>
<p>metabolic function, hormone health,</p>
<p>but also calcium regulation and heart health.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim their special offer in the month of January</p>
<p>of 10 free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.</p>
<p>So in any case, we have this blind spot,</p>
<p>which you can, I think most people learn this in school,</p>
<p>although my daughters had not been taught this in school.</p>
<p>I just showed them this for the first time</p>
<p>like a month ago, which, and they were briefly fascinated.</p>
<p>And then they want to return to their screen time.</p>
<p>But anyway, you can take a piece of paper</p>
<p>and you make two marks on it,</p>
<p>and then you cover one eye and you fixate on one mark.</p>
<p>I mean, you can look this up online</p>
<p>if you need details about how to do this.</p>
<p>And while staring at one fixation point,</p>
<p>you move the paper back and forth</p>
<p>and you can get it to a place</p>
<p>where the other mark disappears.</p>
<p>And you can run this experiment long enough</p>
<p>to satisfy yourself that there is in fact a blind spot</p>
<p>in your visual field, which with one eye closed,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t normally notice.</p>
<p>The reason why you have to cover one eye</p>
<p>is because each eye compensates</p>
<p>for the blind spot of the other.</p>
<p>So, but which is to say that if you close one eye</p>
<p>and survey the visual scene,</p>
<p>something really is missing, whatever you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at a crowd of people,</p>
<p>somebody is missing a head and you&rsquo;re not noticing it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not easy to notice because,</p>
<p>you know, the brain doesn&rsquo;t tend</p>
<p>to vividly represent the absence of information.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just part of the game that&rsquo;s not being rendered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not showing up as a break in the visual field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not there.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re, I mean, people have argued</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a kind of filling in phenomenon that happens,</p>
<p>but I think that can be misunderstood or exaggerated.</p>
<p>But the eye movements themselves that you described before,</p>
<p>I guess I should say that the saccade analogy</p>
<p>of about transiently and repetitively erasing the self</p>
<p>works perfectly here because indeed micro saccades,</p>
<p>little smaller saccades that occur all the time</p>
<p>also prevent our eyes from fixating at one location</p>
<p>for long enough to observe our blind spot,</p>
<p>even if one eye is closed.</p>
<p>So if we, the experiments done with paralytics</p>
<p>to essentially lock eyes at one location,</p>
<p>basically things just start disappearing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d all love to think that we&rsquo;d start hallucinating,</p>
<p>but actually we start going blind.</p>
<p>And those experiments have been done.</p>
<p>And on humans, I hear they&rsquo;re quite terrifying.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>But I mean, you can do that for yourself too.</p>
<p>It just, you know, it begins to just all melt away</p>
<p>in a warm glow, no psychedelics required.</p>
<p>But the interesting point there is that</p>
<p>when you ask yourself, okay, so this,</p>
<p>because of the, as a consequence of the eye&rsquo;s anatomy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this thing you can see</p>
<p>that is absent from your experience.</p>
<p>But the question is, where is that in relationship</p>
<p>to the rest of you, to your mind?</p>
<p>Is that deep within, or is that in some sense</p>
<p>right on the surface of experience?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this expectation that people have,</p>
<p>again, I think conflating meditation</p>
<p>with a search for changes in the context of consciousness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking for, you know,</p>
<p>much more subtle things to notice about the mind</p>
<p>or much, you know, vaster things to notice.</p>
<p>Psychedelics sets up this expectation that, you know,</p>
<p>you do, you know, a massive dose of mushrooms or LSD</p>
<p>and everything changes.</p>
<p>I mean, you just get this full, you know,</p>
<p>beatific vision and you get not only visual changes,</p>
<p>but, you know, emotional changes</p>
<p>and you get synesthesia where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just, you have much more mind in so many ways.</p>
<p>So they begin, having these experiences</p>
<p>or reading the mystical literature,</p>
<p>you begin to think, okay, well then freedom</p>
<p>is really elsewhere, or it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s deep within.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not coincident with the ordinary awareness</p>
<p>that can see this coffee cup clearly</p>
<p>and that can just transition attention to, you know,</p>
<p>reading an email with a sort of full sobriety</p>
<p>of just, you know, ordinary waking consciousness.</p>
<p>But the truth is this insight into selflessness,</p>
<p>this insight into the non-duality of subject and object</p>
<p>is as close to ordinary consciousness</p>
<p>as this insight into the optic blind spot.</p>
<p>Like where do you have to go</p>
<p>to have this insight into the blind spot?</p>
<p>No, you just have to, you don&rsquo;t have to go anywhere.</p>
<p>You just have to set up the experiment correctly</p>
<p>such that, you know, you can see the data,</p>
<p>but the data&rsquo;s right on the surface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s almost too close to you to notice.</p>
<p>I mean, if it&rsquo;s at all hard to notice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s so close</p>
<p>rather than it&rsquo;s, you know, deep within or far away.</p>
<p>And there are other analogies like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember those mind&rsquo;s eye</p>
<p>pieces of artwork that were the random dot stereograms</p>
<p>where you have an image that pops out.</p>
<p>I always find it very difficult to see those</p>
<p>because I have a very dominant eye, you know,</p>
<p>but some people-</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t see those.</p>
<p>These are these images that used to be</p>
<p>at the kind of like touristy shops.</p>
<p>People would say, oh, there it is, the whale.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking, I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>You know, kids that swim a lot when they&rsquo;re younger</p>
<p>and they tend to breathe just to one side.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this was you, this was definitely me.</p>
<p>They tend to, will keep one eye closed.</p>
<p>You set up a pretty strong ocular dominance</p>
<p>biasing your vision to one or the other eye early in life,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re learning how to be a bow hunter</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re learning how to throw darts or shoot billiards</p>
<p>or anything involves selectively viewing the world</p>
<p>through one eye for even a couple of hours</p>
<p>can set up a permanent asymmetry</p>
<p>in the weighting of visual flow,</p>
<p>flow of visual information from the eye to the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reversible, but only through the reverse gymnastics</p>
<p>of covering up the other eye intentionally.</p>
<p>So I actually be, I had to be reverse patched for a while</p>
<p>because I was seeing double because I lost binocular vision.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t stand a chance in hell</p>
<p>of seeing an image pop out of a random top stereo,</p>
<p>which is kind of ironic</p>
<p>because I did my PhD on binocular circuitry.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, if people can see these</p>
<p>or if they can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I think they provide a really terrific example</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re talking about as a larger theme,</p>
<p>which is that perceptually you see a bunch of dots</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden what you thought wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>are suddenly there, but can just disappear again.</p>
<p>Or there are certain visual illusions,</p>
<p>if we were to include others,</p>
<p>that once you see them, you cannot unsee them.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the faces, vases, figure ground type stuff.</p>
<p>Bi-stable percepts.</p>
<p>Bi-stable percepts.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s sort of ocular competition.</p>
<p>You show two different images to the eyes,</p>
<p>each of the two eyes.</p>
<p>It is near impossible for people</p>
<p>to perceive them both simultaneously.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit of what you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>I mean, these seem to be fundamental features</p>
<p>about the way the neural circuits are organized,</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t want to stay fixated</p>
<p>on any one thing for very long.</p>
<p>To do so either takes training, intense interest,</p>
<p>intense fear, intense excitement.</p>
<p>When I say intense, I guess I come back to this idea</p>
<p>that the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>is somehow governing our ability</p>
<p>to spotlight at any one location for very long.</p>
<p>Is that a useful framework</p>
<p>or is that going to take us down a different path?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s sort of a different path for this.</p>
<p>The only point I was making is that</p>
<p>the seemingly paradoxical claim</p>
<p>that something can be right on the surface</p>
<p>and yet hard to see, right?</p>
<p>So there are things that are,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, and again,</p>
<p>this seems to justify the expectation held by,</p>
<p>I would think, the vast majority of people</p>
<p>who get interested in these spiritual things,</p>
<p>for lack of a better word,</p>
<p>that the truth must somehow be deep within, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s really like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some distance between where you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>between the one who is looking</p>
<p>and the thing that has to be found, right?</p>
<p>And you have to go through this long evolution of changes.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s many metaphors that set this up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re at the base of a mountain</p>
<p>and you have to climb to the top.</p>
<p>And so you have to find the path,</p>
<p>however secure it is to get you there.</p>
<p>But there really is a distance</p>
<p>between where you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>between your starting point and the goal.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m arguing, you know,</p>
<p>and this is a kind of a non-dual,</p>
<p>to use a term of jargon,</p>
<p>is a non-dual approach to meditation</p>
<p>as opposed to a dualistic one.</p>
<p>That there really is a,</p>
<p>the path and the goal are coincident, right?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>that you have to unravel the logic</p>
<p>that you have to unravel the logic</p>
<p>by which you would seek something that&rsquo;s outside of you,</p>
<p>you know, the present moment&rsquo;s experience,</p>
<p>you know, i.e. not available,</p>
<p>really not available to you now.</p>
<p>Because so many things worth having,</p>
<p>so many skills worth acquiring</p>
<p>really are not available to you now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>if you want to be a pianist</p>
<p>or if you want to speak Chinese,</p>
<p>or if you want like, like the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and then you want to learn that thing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole process, right?</p>
<p>And you might not be capable of doing it, right?</p>
<p>You might, and, and real mastery is far away, right?</p>
<p>If you, if you&rsquo;ve never hit a golf ball</p>
<p>and you want to hit a golf ball 300 yards straight, right?</p>
<p>You know, I can pretty much guarantee</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to do that initially</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not going to do it, you know, on day two.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not going to do it reliably for the longest time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s real training, you know,</p>
<p>in front of you to be able to do that reliably.</p>
<p>And insight into, and really the core insight,</p>
<p>I mean, the insight that is, you know,</p>
<p>the core of, you know, the Buddha&rsquo;s teaching</p>
<p>to take one, one historical example of this,</p>
<p>really is available now.</p>
<p>And it is not, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>granted it can be very hard won for people.</p>
<p>I mean, I had probably spent a year on silent retreat</p>
<p>in, in, you know, one week to three month increments</p>
<p>before I sort of got the point I&rsquo;m making now, right?</p>
<p>So like, I, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s quite,</p>
<p>I mean, literally, and this is, these are, you know,</p>
<p>these are retreats where you spend, you know,</p>
<p>12 to 18 hours a day just meditating,</p>
<p>trying to, to, you know,</p>
<p>unpack the kinds of claims I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m, you know, making now.</p>
<p>So there, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s possible to rigorously overlook this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to stand in front of the mind&rsquo;s eye image</p>
<p>and stare in a way that is guaranteed</p>
<p>not to give you pop out, right?</p>
<p>And to be, to be adept at, you know, staring in that way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible to be misled.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;m, what I&rsquo;m trying to argue here</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a fair amount of leverage</p>
<p>you can get with, with better information,</p>
<p>which can kind of cut the time course</p>
<p>of your searching for this thing</p>
<p>and, and, and kind of cancel your false expectations</p>
<p>about just where this is in relation</p>
<p>to your ordinary waking consciousness.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible to get bad information</p>
<p>and to have a bunch of experiences.</p>
<p>You know, you go, you go and do an Ayahuasca trip</p>
<p>and you have, it&rsquo;s incredibly valuable</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s valuable for all the ways</p>
<p>in which it changed the contents of your consciousness</p>
<p>in, in, you know, startling ways.</p>
<p>And you had insights into your past</p>
<p>and into your relationships</p>
<p>and into why you&rsquo;re not as loving as you might be.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots to think about.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, okay, that&rsquo;s all great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all something that, you know, you can,</p>
<p>you can talk about, but there is, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it truly is orthogonal.</p>
<p>I mean, if it makes a point of contact</p>
<p>to what I&rsquo;m talking about, it&rsquo;s really just at one point,</p>
<p>you know, and it&rsquo;s at the point where</p>
<p>this sense of, of subject object division</p>
<p>in consciousness is illusory</p>
<p>and vulnerable to investigation.</p>
<p>And if you investigate it</p>
<p>as sort of the right plane of focus, you know,</p>
<p>you pick the analogy you want from, you know,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s, you know, setting up the, the,</p>
<p>the optic blind spot experiment in just the right way</p>
<p>so that you can see that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually not, the data is not there.</p>
<p>Or, I mean, the bistable percept is, is great because,</p>
<p>you know, when you see one of these images,</p>
<p>like the vase face diagram, or, you know, the Dalmatian,</p>
<p>you know, that it looks like just a mess of dots.</p>
<p>And then you see the image of a Dalmatian dog pop out.</p>
<p>Once you see it, you really can&rsquo;t unsee it.</p>
<p>I mean, like once you have the, the requisite conceptual,</p>
<p>you know, anchor to it, then every time you look,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find it again</p>
<p>and it eventually becomes effortless.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what ultimately meditation is.</p>
<p>I mean, this kind of meditation,</p>
<p>you ultimately learn to recognize</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no separation from you,</p>
<p>between you and your experience, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not the experience on the one hand</p>
<p>and the self on the other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just experience, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just seeing, hearing, smelling,</p>
<p>tasting, touching, thinking, feeling,</p>
<p>you know, proprioception,</p>
<p>add whatever channels of information you want to that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s just the, there&rsquo;s just the totality</p>
<p>of the energy of consciousness and its contents.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no, it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re on the river bank.</p>
<p>And this is, this is how it can seem in the beginning,</p>
<p>even when you&rsquo;re practicing meditation,</p>
<p>it can seem like you&rsquo;re on the river bank,</p>
<p>watching the contents of consciousness flow by.</p>
<p>And then, and meditation is the act of doing that</p>
<p>more and more dispassionately.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re no longer grabbing at the pleasant</p>
<p>or pushing the unpleasant away.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just kind of relaxing</p>
<p>and in the most nonjudgmental frame of mind,</p>
<p>just witnessing the flow, right?</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re doing that dualistically,</p>
<p>you feel like the meditator.</p>
<p>You feel like the subject aiming attention.</p>
<p>And so now you&rsquo;re on the river bank,</p>
<p>watching everything go, go past.</p>
<p>But the truth is you are the river, right?</p>
<p>Experience itself is that there is just experience itself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not on the edge of experience</p>
<p>and everything you can notice is part of the flow, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, and there&rsquo;s no point from which</p>
<p>to abstract yourself away from the flow,</p>
<p>to stand outside it and to say, okay, this is,</p>
<p>this is my life.</p>
<p>This is my experience.</p>
<p>This is my body.</p>
<p>Yes, you can do that.</p>
<p>I mean, those are all just thoughts,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s more of the flow, right?</p>
<p>And so there is a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a process by which you would eventually recognize</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no distance between you and your experience.</p>
<p>And again, you can,</p>
<p>you can wait for those moments in life</p>
<p>where experience gets so good or so terrifying,</p>
<p>you know, or it&rsquo;s just so salient, right?</p>
<p>Your amygdala is driving so hard.</p>
<p>I mean, so you&rsquo;re in a war</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t think about anything because the, you know,</p>
<p>the enemy is shooting at you</p>
<p>and this is the most thrilling video game</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever played in your life</p>
<p>and your life is on the line or you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>at the peak of, of some, you know, athletic event</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re doing the things you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all happening automatically, right?</p>
<p>But, you know, those are, those are, you know,</p>
<p>one 100th of 1% of one&rsquo;s life, you know,</p>
<p>and, you know, what I&rsquo;m calling meditation</p>
<p>is a way of simply understanding the mechanics of attention</p>
<p>whereby you are denying yourself</p>
<p>that unity of experience so much of the time</p>
<p>and recognizing that that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s based on a misperception</p>
<p>of the way consciousness always already is.</p>
<p>Well, if there wasn&rsquo;t an incentive</p>
<p>to learn how to meditate properly,</p>
<p>that was one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been meditating a fair amount since I was in my teens,</p>
<p>but more along the lines of just paying attention to breath</p>
<p>and, you know, recognize thoughts,</p>
<p>sort of observer, open observer type meditation</p>
<p>or focused attention,</p>
<p>I would suppose more of the focused attention type.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into these a little bit later,</p>
<p>but I have a number of questions</p>
<p>related to what you just said.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I love the idea that this thing that we would all do well</p>
<p>to understand, to observe consciousness itself,</p>
<p>as opposed to trying to alter the contents of consciousness</p>
<p>may sit much closer to us than one might think that it,</p>
<p>and that because it sits so close to us</p>
<p>that that might be one of the reasons why we miss it.</p>
<p>I go right to a visual system example.</p>
<p>I mean, if you don&rsquo;t, if you&rsquo;re wearing corrective lenses</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a spec on your lens, you know,</p>
<p>typically you&rsquo;re looking out through the lens</p>
<p>and so you wouldn&rsquo;t observe that spec.</p>
<p>Any number of different analogies could work here.</p>
<p>The fact that there are states,</p>
<p>however few positive and negative ecstasy,</p>
<p>extreme ecstasy and extreme fear</p>
<p>being the two, I think, most obvious ones</p>
<p>that seems like we agree on</p>
<p>that allow us to capture the sense of completeness of self</p>
<p>or the unity of the observer and the actor.</p>
<p>The fact that those are seldom for the non-trained,</p>
<p>for the non-meditator, suggests to me two things.</p>
<p>I think one perhaps worth exploring more than the other,</p>
<p>but one is that what&rsquo;s really being revealed</p>
<p>in the states where we can feel the unity</p>
<p>of the observer and the actor</p>
<p>is understanding something fundamental about the algorithm,</p>
<p>not the online algorithm,</p>
<p>but the algorithm that is our nervous system.</p>
<p>Just as you mentioned cephalopods,</p>
<p>mantis shrimp see an enormous array of color hues</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Their maps and representations of the world</p>
<p>are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Pit vipers see in the infrared.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re restricted to somewhat of a limited range</p>
<p>within the color spectrum,</p>
<p>but still more vast than that of dogs or cats.</p>
<p>Okay, so understanding that for seeing</p>
<p>what a pit viper can see for moments</p>
<p>would be informative, perhaps sensing heat emissions</p>
<p>as a human might be invasive,</p>
<p>then maybe that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So the question is, to just make it straightforward,</p>
<p>is why would the system be designed this way?</p>
<p>Again, neither of us were consulted the design phase,</p>
<p>but that brings me to perhaps the more tractable question</p>
<p>which is about development.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a great believer that the neural circuits</p>
<p>that encouraged healthy parent-child relations</p>
<p>or unhealthy parent-child relations,</p>
<p>as the case may be in childhood,</p>
<p>stem from the initial demands</p>
<p>of internal versus external states,</p>
<p>which is exactly that we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>which is that a young child feels anxious</p>
<p>because it needs its diaper changed.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really know it needs its diaper change</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s cold, or it&rsquo;s uncomfortable,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s hungry, or it&rsquo;s overly full.</p>
<p>And so it vocalizes and then some external source</p>
<p>comes to us and relieves that hopefully, right?</p>
<p>And so the fundamental rule that we first learn</p>
<p>is not that we have a self or that things fall down, not up,</p>
<p>but is that when uncomfortable externalize that discomfort</p>
<p>and it will be relieved by an outside player.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&rsquo;s a repurposing of that circuitry</p>
<p>for adult romantic attachments.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone doubts that.</p>
<p>And that can explain a lot indeed</p>
<p>about attachment and so forth.</p>
<p>So something about our developmental wiring</p>
<p>and the algorithms that these neural circuits run</p>
<p>tend to bias most people, the non-practice meditators,</p>
<p>to live a somewhat functional life, at least,</p>
<p>without this awareness of actor and observer.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>is a deliberate intervention to understand</p>
<p>and resolve that gap in the algorithm.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more or less restating what you said</p>
<p>in a way that I&rsquo;m hoping will serve as a jumping off point</p>
<p>as to why questions are always very dangerous in biology</p>
<p>or any, you know, and-</p>
<p>Or in relationship.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Or in relationship.</p>
<p>Or in relationship, right, exactly.</p>
<p>Although I think it all does really harken back</p>
<p>to this early developmental wiring,</p>
<p>which of course is modifiable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of the nervous system</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s the one organ that seems to be able to change itself</p>
<p>at least to some degree.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts about the organization</p>
<p>of the circuitry to essentially under normal conditions</p>
<p>to not reveal what seems to be</p>
<p>one of its more important and profound</p>
<p>and for, you know, dare I say, enlightening features, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if we are potentially like mantis shrimp.</p>
<p>We can see so many more colors than we actually see,</p>
<p>and yet we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We sort of opt, most people opt not to.</p>
<p>And I would argue that one of the great strengths</p>
<p>of the waking up app, for instance,</p>
<p>that it essentially walks you through the process</p>
<p>of being able to arrive at these things</p>
<p>without having to go do one year or three year</p>
<p>long silent meditation retreats.</p>
<p>So if you could just elaborate for a moment</p>
<p>before we move on about, you know,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts about how the circuitry</p>
<p>is arranged by default versus the,</p>
<p>and what that means for there to be an intervention</p>
<p>that we have to intervene in the self</p>
<p>in order to reveal the self?</p>
<p>Well, so the two big questions there,</p>
<p>one about evolution, one about development.</p>
<p>So with respect to evolution, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to recognize that evolution</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t see our deepest concerns about human flourishing</p>
<p>and human wellbeing, you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, we are set up to spawn</p>
<p>and to survive long enough to help our progeny spawn</p>
<p>if we can do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it, right?</p>
<p>And so anything that was good for that,</p>
<p>including, you know, tribalism and xenophobia</p>
<p>and, you know, all kinds of hardware and software flaws</p>
<p>that reveal themselves to be flaws in the present time</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re trying to build a viable global civilization.</p>
<p>But, you know, they redounded to the advantage</p>
<p>of our ancestors somehow, or they just,</p>
<p>there are things about us that we&rsquo;re simply not selected for.</p>
<p>They just kind of came along for the ride.</p>
<p>You know, what Stephen J. Gould called a spandrel,</p>
<p>you know, so we are not set up by evolution</p>
<p>to be as happy as we possibly can be.</p>
<p>And certainly, and to do almost anything</p>
<p>that interests us well.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not set up by evolution</p>
<p>to be mathematicians or musicians</p>
<p>or to create democracies that are healthy.</p>
<p>I mean, evolution can see none of this.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing these things based on cognitive</p>
<p>and emotional hardware that we&rsquo;re leveraging</p>
<p>in new directions, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we have, we are primates and we are, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re communicating with, you know, small mouth noises.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re language using primates</p>
<p>and all of that is clearly evolved.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing these amazing things, including science,</p>
<p>you know, however improbably we&rsquo;re actually able to,</p>
<p>you know, almost entirely with language,</p>
<p>understand reality that at a scale</p>
<p>that exceeds us in both directions.</p>
<p>I mean, the very vast and the very small</p>
<p>and, you know, also temporally, the very old.</p>
<p>We have, you know, visions of the far future.</p>
<p>We can figure out, you know, where, you know,</p>
<p>an asteroid is gonna, you know, cross earth&rsquo;s orbit</p>
<p>a thousand years from now, if we just do the math.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing that we can do all of those things,</p>
<p>but evolution is blind to all of that, right?</p>
<p>And so we have, in terms of what we care about</p>
<p>and certainly in terms of what we,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna ensure our survival as a species,</p>
<p>we have flown the perch that was created for us by evolution.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re just not, it&rsquo;s not just the primate things.</p>
<p>And so, so it is with learning how to regulate our emotions</p>
<p>and, you know, punch through to a self-concept</p>
<p>or beyond a self-concept that is more normative</p>
<p>psychologically that allows us to, you know,</p>
<p>not be terrorized by our apish genes</p>
<p>as fully as we seem to be,</p>
<p>even in the presence of more and more destructive technology</p>
<p>that, I mean, like, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still practically chimpanzees</p>
<p>armed with nuclear weapons, right?</p>
<p>I mean, and that is, you know, increasingly dysfunctional.</p>
<p>And very soon we&rsquo;re gonna be in the presence of minds</p>
<p>or apparent minds that we have built, you know,</p>
<p>that are as intelligent as we are or, and very quickly,</p>
<p>you know, probably 15 minutes after that,</p>
<p>far more intelligent than we are.</p>
<p>And so what we do with all of that is again,</p>
<p>something that we have to figure out</p>
<p>based on the minds we have, the minds we can build,</p>
<p>the minds we can change, you know,</p>
<p>we can meddle with our own genomes now</p>
<p>and that will produce its own consequences, you know,</p>
<p>in ourselves and in future generations,</p>
<p>if we meddle with the germline.</p>
<p>And again, all of that is just, you know,</p>
<p>evolution is just sort of the womb we came out of,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, it didn&rsquo;t anticipate any of that, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, mother nature has simply not had</p>
<p>our best interests at heart, right?</p>
<p>And we might die off and from the point of view</p>
<p>of mother nature, that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>because 99% of every species dies off, you know?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that, but when you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>the individual developmentally,</p>
<p>so, you know, we all come into this world again,</p>
<p>as a fairly hairless primate</p>
<p>that needs a tremendous amount of care by others.</p>
<p>And the logic of that is that, you know,</p>
<p>you know, the reason why we&rsquo;re not a gazelle</p>
<p>that can run, you know, 45 minutes later</p>
<p>and then basically do all the gazelle things</p>
<p>perfectly soon thereafter,</p>
<p>the reason why we have, you know,</p>
<p>we have this time of immaturity</p>
<p>and that becomes, has become functional for us</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s just, we&rsquo;re far more flexible</p>
<p>and we can learn based on the needs of an environment</p>
<p>to do, you know, so much more than a gazelle can.</p>
<p>And language is a part of that.</p>
<p>And, you know, in the last 10,000 years or so,</p>
<p>culture increasingly has been more and more a part of that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably a layer at which we can plausibly</p>
<p>talk about cultural evolution, you know,</p>
<p>and cultural evolution interacting</p>
<p>with biological evolution to change us.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re talking about the development</p>
<p>of an individual, each of us comes into this world,</p>
<p>I think, not recognizing ourselves in any sense</p>
<p>that would make sense to reify.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>I mean, there could be some kind</p>
<p>of proto self differentiation,</p>
<p>but I think it takes a long while</p>
<p>and there is very likely a coincidence</p>
<p>between really recognizing others.</p>
<p>We recognize others first</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re certainly in relationship immediately</p>
<p>and we orient to human faces and we, you know,</p>
<p>even detect other humans as good</p>
<p>and bad moral actors very early.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly long before we recognize ourselves</p>
<p>in a mirror, the experiments run again,</p>
<p>this is Paul Bloom and colleagues experiments run</p>
<p>on kind of the moral hardware</p>
<p>and software of developing toddlers.</p>
<p>But I think at this point, they push it down all the way</p>
<p>to like six months of age where you&rsquo;ll get these infants</p>
<p>staring at kind of a puppet show</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll show a greater interest</p>
<p>in classically good actors versus bad actors,</p>
<p>you know, cooperators versus defectors</p>
<p>in various puppet show games.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not that we have no mind</p>
<p>and no proto awareness of others and of self,</p>
<p>but what eventually happens certainly</p>
<p>as we become at all facile with language use</p>
<p>is that we become aware that not only are we</p>
<p>in relationship to others,</p>
<p>but we are an object in the world for them, right?</p>
<p>So that like we have enough people pointing at us</p>
<p>in our cribs, right?</p>
<p>And impinging upon our experience, right?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re being physically moved</p>
<p>and prodded and touched and consoled or not consoled.</p>
<p>And just imagine what all of these,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the receiving end of 10,000 interventions, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re completely helpless for the longest time.</p>
<p>And all of that attention,</p>
<p>you have all of these people coming up, you know,</p>
<p>to the crib and making faces at you.</p>
<p>Cheering for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s all pointed at you, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a classic magical narcissism</p>
<p>that gets constructed there.</p>
<p>If you take the psychological literature, you know,</p>
<p>at least a certain strand of it seriously.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s largely apt to think of a child</p>
<p>at that age as a kind of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of narcissistic structure there</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s all kind of going inward.</p>
<p>And at a certain point you realize,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m the center of all of this, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not just a movie that you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re completely absorbed in</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve lost your sense of self.</p>
<p>I mean, this is to talk to yet another example</p>
<p>of what it&rsquo;s like as a grownup to lose our sense of self.</p>
<p>And one of the things I think we find so fascinating</p>
<p>by television and film is that</p>
<p>when we get totally absorbed in it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in this very unusual circumstance where we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know, our brain is basically reading it</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re in the classic social circumstance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re presented with, you know,</p>
<p>the facial displays of other people.</p>
<p>In fact, you know, we can get some of the,</p>
<p>sometimes these people are 10 feet tall, right?</p>
<p>Or their faces are 10 feet tall.</p>
<p>You leave a closeup in a movie theater.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like this super stimulus in terms of evolution.</p>
<p>And they could be making direct eye contact</p>
<p>with a camera, right?</p>
<p>So you have this gigantic face staring at you</p>
<p>and yet you&rsquo;re totally unimplicated socially.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be seen.</p>
<p>And something about you, you know you can&rsquo;t be seen.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re completely,</p>
<p>you completely lose self-consciousness</p>
<p>and yet you&rsquo;re able to examine</p>
<p>with completely free attention,</p>
<p>again, because you&rsquo;re totally unimplicated,</p>
<p>the facial minutiae and the mimetic facial play of people</p>
<p>at a very close range.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re seeing people close.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;d have to be, you know, physically just,</p>
<p>you know, about to kiss your spouse.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what a closeup is in a film, right?</p>
<p>Like that, you never get that close to people, right?</p>
<p>And yet here you&rsquo;re in a situation where you&rsquo;re unobserved</p>
<p>and you know that.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, this is a bit of a tangent,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the other side of what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>developmentally for a kid.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in a movie theater watching a movie,</p>
<p>you are truly invisible and yet you&rsquo;re right there</p>
<p>seeing, you know, however harrowing the human drama is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing it play out and you&rsquo;re seeing it up close.</p>
<p>And it is in principle, a social encounter</p>
<p>that your genes are ready for,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not ready for you to be invisible, right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s so magical about it.</p>
<p>But what happens developmentally for a kid</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re not invisible.</p>
<p>You are an object that is constantly being overrun.</p>
<p>The boundaries of your sensory engagement with the world</p>
<p>are constantly being impinged upon by others.</p>
<p>And at a certain point you recognize,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m at the center of this.</p>
<p>And the way this gets enshrined as a self,</p>
<p>I think is probably coincident</p>
<p>with our learning the language game.</p>
<p>We learn to play with others.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking to others.</p>
<p>People are talking to us.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, we&rsquo;re talking to ourselves</p>
<p>even when the other people leave the room, right?</p>
<p>So, and you can hear if you ever have been with a toddler</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re externalizing their self-talk,</p>
<p>you hear them talking to themselves,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re playing and they&rsquo;re having a conversation.</p>
<p>They were talking to you, the parent,</p>
<p>but then you left the room and they&rsquo;re still talking.</p>
<p>You come back in and they&rsquo;re still talking, right?</p>
<p>And what happens to us, strangely,</p>
<p>and this comes back to the logic of evolution,</p>
<p>we never stop because evolution never thought</p>
<p>to build us an off switch for this, right?</p>
<p>I mean, language is so useful</p>
<p>and it gets tuned up so strongly for us.</p>
<p>And there was never a reason to shut it off, right?</p>
<p>There was never a reason to give you this ability to say,</p>
<p>oh, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have four hours of quiet now</p>
<p>and like no self-talk.</p>
<p>And so for most of us, I mean, I think there are people</p>
<p>who for whatever neurological reason</p>
<p>or idiosyncratic reason,</p>
<p>undoubtedly there&rsquo;d be a neurological reason for it,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have any self-talk.</p>
<p>But for most of us, we are covertly talking</p>
<p>basically all the time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an imagistic component of this for many people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re visualizing things as well,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just a ton of white noise in the mind</p>
<p>that feels a certain way.</p>
<p>And what you discover in meditation ultimately</p>
<p>is that the self is what it feels like to be thinking</p>
<p>without knowing that you&rsquo;re thinking, right?</p>
<p>A thought arises uninspected</p>
<p>and seems to just become you, right?</p>
<p>So like you and I are talking now</p>
<p>and people are listening to us,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re struggling to follow the train of this conversation</p>
<p>because it is competing with the conversation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in their heads, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be saying something</p>
<p>and a person listening will say,</p>
<p>well, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Or like, oh, but wait a minute, he just contradicted himself</p>
<p>or like, and there&rsquo;s a voice in your head</p>
<p>that is also vying for your attention much of the time.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, the first discovery people make in meditation</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s just so hard to pay attention to anything,</p>
<p>the breath or a mantra or a sound, whatever it is,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re thinking every,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about the thing you need to do in an hour</p>
<p>and oh, it&rsquo;s so good that I downloaded this app.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, this is really good.</p>
<p>This is gonna be good for me.</p>
<p>But that chatter isn&rsquo;t showing up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not far back enough</p>
<p>in the kind of the theater of consciousness</p>
<p>so as to see it emerge.</p>
<p>It is just sneaking up behind you</p>
<p>and it feels like me again, right?</p>
<p>It feels like when someone is thinking the thought,</p>
<p>well, what the hell does that mean, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not seeing it as an emerging object</p>
<p>in consciousness, it just feels like me.</p>
<p>It just feels that that&rsquo;s, it is,</p>
<p>subjectively, it&rsquo;s like the mind contracts</p>
<p>around this appearance in consciousness.</p>
<p>And it really is just, it is just a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a sound with the voice of the mind.</p>
<p>If you actually can inspect it,</p>
<p>it is deeply inscrutable</p>
<p>that we ever feel identified with our thoughts.</p>
<p>I mean, how is it that we could be a thought?</p>
<p>These thoughts, a thought just arises and passes away.</p>
<p>And when you inspect it, when you go to inspect it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, it unravels,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s the least substantial possible thing.</p>
<p>And it could, but yet it could be a thought of self-hatred.</p>
<p>You know, it could be a thought that unrecognized</p>
<p>totally defines your mood.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I mean, just again, this all can seem kind of abstract, but.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s extremely concrete</p>
<p>from the perspective of the neural circuits</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll return to maybe in a few minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,</p>
<p>however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,</p>
<p>lipids, and hormones, and so forth,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with those data.</p>
<p>InsideTracker solves that problem</p>
<p>and makes it very easy for you to understand</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,</p>
<p>maybe even supplementation-based interventions</p>
<p>you might want to take on</p>
<p>in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,</p>
<p>hormones, lipids, and other things</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>to bring those numbers into the ranges</p>
<p>that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.</p>

<p>If you could elaborate a bit on this notion</p>
<p>of internal chatter and external stimuli</p>
<p>and the bridge between them,</p>
<p>because I think that for some people</p>
<p>that might be intuitive.</p>
<p>I think for others it&rsquo;s not so obvious</p>
<p>that language is ongoing in the backdrop.</p>
<p>Because sometimes, I think some people</p>
<p>are more tuned into that language.</p>
<p>For some people it&rsquo;s louder volume.</p>
<p>For some people it&rsquo;s more structured.</p>
<p>I have a colleague at Stanford</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been on this podcast called Diceroth,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like one of the preeminent bioengineers,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t call it a meditative practice,</p>
<p>but he has a practice where each evening</p>
<p>after his five kids are put down to sleep,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re older now,</p>
<p>but in the quiet of the late hours</p>
<p>of the night, early morning,</p>
<p>he sits and forces himself to think in complete sentences</p>
<p>with punctuation for an hour.</p>
<p>This is the way that he has taught himself</p>
<p>to structure his thinking</p>
<p>because of the very fact that you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>which is that ordinarily there is an underlying structure</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s internal,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s disrupted by external events</p>
<p>and typically it&rsquo;s not coherent enough</p>
<p>to really make meaning from.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like somebody sitting down</p>
<p>to write in complete sentences,</p>
<p>but forcing himself to do it in his head.</p>
<p>But for many people, including myself,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a foreign experience</p>
<p>and we only experience structure</p>
<p>through our interactions with the world and other people.</p>
<p>That if I&rsquo;ve taken the time to try and explore ideas</p>
<p>with eyes closed and I&rsquo;ve been able to do that,</p>
<p>there are certain pharmacologic states</p>
<p>that we could talk about that facilitate that.</p>
<p>And no, those are not amphetamines.</p>
<p>Those do exactly the opposite, by the way.</p>
<p>But I think people exist in varying degrees</p>
<p>of structured and unstructured internal dialogue</p>
<p>and in varying depths of recognition</p>
<p>of that internal dialogue.</p>
<p>And so the question I suppose is,</p>
<p>is just the recognition that there&rsquo;s a dialogue</p>
<p>ongoing internally, is that itself valuable?</p>
<p>Yeah, and that also can take some time.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a claim I would make</p>
<p>that some people might find surprising,</p>
<p>but I think this is an objectively true claim</p>
<p>about the subjectivity of most people,</p>
<p>which is that unless you have a fair amount of training,</p>
<p>unless you just happen to be some kind of savant</p>
<p>in this area, which most people by definition aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>or you have a remarkable amount of training</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called concentration practice in meditation,</p>
<p>I believe this is a true claim</p>
<p>that if we just put a stopwatch on this table</p>
<p>and people could just watch 30 seconds elapse.</p>
<p>And I set all of our listeners or viewers the task</p>
<p>for the next 30 seconds, just pay attention to anything,</p>
<p>your breath, or the sight of your hand</p>
<p>or the sight of the clock or any object</p>
<p>without getting lost in thought,</p>
<p>without getting momentarily distracted</p>
<p>by this conversation you&rsquo;re having with yourself.</p>
<p>This couple of things would happen.</p>
<p>One is no one would be able to do it, right?</p>
<p>And this is not just a superficial inability.</p>
<p>I mean, if your life&rsquo;s dependent on it,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it.</p>
<p>I mean, if the fate of civilization depended on it,</p>
<p>none of our listeners would be able to do this.</p>
<p>And yet some percentage of them are so distracted by thought</p>
<p>that they will actually try this experiment</p>
<p>and think they succeeded, right?</p>
<p>And for these people, what happens is you put them</p>
<p>on a meditation retreat and you have them spend 12 hours</p>
<p>a day in silence doing nothing but this, right?</p>
<p>So the practice is just pay attention to the breath</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re sitting.</p>
<p>And then eventually you incorporate everything,</p>
<p>sounds and other sensations.</p>
<p>And then you interleave that with walking meditation</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re paying attention just to the sensations</p>
<p>of lifting and moving and placing their feet.</p>
<p>And then once the practice is going,</p>
<p>you incorporate sounds and sights and everything.</p>
<p>But so you can pay attention to everything,</p>
<p>but the goal is for every moment</p>
<p>you are going to cultivate this faculty of mind,</p>
<p>which increasingly is known as mindfulness, right?</p>
<p>So, and mindfulness is nothing other</p>
<p>than this very careful attention</p>
<p>to the contents of consciousness.</p>
<p>But the crucial piece is,</p>
<p>it is not a moment of being lost in thought, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not blocking thoughts.</p>
<p>Thoughts themselves can arise,</p>
<p>but in those moments of being truly mindful,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re noticing thoughts as thoughts,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s language in the mind or images,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re noticing those two</p>
<p>as spontaneous appearances in consciousness.</p>
<p>So if most people,</p>
<p>certainly anyone who thinks they can pay attention to,</p>
<p>they can do the experiment successfully</p>
<p>that I just suggested,</p>
<p>pay attention to something for 30 seconds</p>
<p>without being lost in thought.</p>
<p>You put those people on a meditation retreat,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re going to experience is,</p>
<p>on the first day,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to feel like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, I was, you know,</p>
<p>I was with the breath or I was walking,</p>
<p>you know, I was with the sensations of walking</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be there for like five minutes,</p>
<p>you know, solid,</p>
<p>and then I would get lost in thought.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;d come back, you know,</p>
<p>five more minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be lost in thought and then get back.</p>
<p>But as the day has progressed, you know,</p>
<p>even, you know,</p>
<p>10 days into a silent meditation retreat,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to experience more and more distraction.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to, it&rsquo;s going to seem like,</p>
<p>okay, wait a minute.</p>
<p>Now I can&rsquo;t pay attention to anything</p>
<p>for more than five seconds, right?</p>
<p>That is progress, right?</p>
<p>Because what they&rsquo;re discovering</p>
<p>is just how distractible they are, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, so some,</p>
<p>for some people that will be immediately obvious,</p>
<p>for some people it&rsquo;ll actually take a lot of practice</p>
<p>to realize just how distracted they are.</p>
<p>What you just said,</p>
<p>which was that at some point</p>
<p>we can start noticing our thoughts.</p>
<p>I can notice my thoughts,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;re talking about is as a goal state</p>
<p>is not being distracted by thoughts,</p>
<p>but actually seeing the relationship between thoughts,</p>
<p>self and other types of perceptions.</p>
<p>And here I think recognizing and seeing thoughts</p>
<p>is a form of perception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an internally directed perception.</p>
<p>This raises a topic that I&rsquo;m also obsessed by,</p>
<p>which I think neuroscience can somewhat explain,</p>
<p>but still incompletely that the circuits and mechanics,</p>
<p>et cetera, are not yet known,</p>
<p>which is about time perception.</p>
<p>And, you know, a simple analogy would be</p>
<p>that there are a lot of small objects flying around</p>
<p>in the space that we happen to be having this discussion,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re moving so fast that I can&rsquo;t perceive them</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re entirely stationary.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t perceive them</p>
<p>because of the reasons we talked about before</p>
<p>in the visual system.</p>
<p>My eyes are moving in perfect concert</p>
<p>with these small object movements,</p>
<p>and therefore I am blind to them.</p>
<p>A slight shift in time perception,</p>
<p>think of this perhaps as a change in the frame rate,</p>
<p>my camera frame rates, faster frame rate,</p>
<p>you can capture slow motion, slower frame rate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get more of a strobe type effect</p>
<p>if the frame rate is low enough.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Could it be that our time perception is not one thing,</p>
<p>but we have one rate of perceiving time</p>
<p>for external objects at a given distance,</p>
<p>which we know is true.</p>
<p>Another frame rate for objects that are up close,</p>
<p>we know this to be true,</p>
<p>even if those objects are moving</p>
<p>at the exact same speed, right?</p>
<p>I mean, this would be the sitting on a train,</p>
<p>the rungs on the fence seem to be going by very, very fast,</p>
<p>but the ones in the distance seem to be moving slowly.</p>
<p>This is the way the visual system</p>
<p>and time perception interconnect at some level.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re up on a skyscraper,</p>
<p>the little ants of cars and people down below,</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re moving much faster</p>
<p>than you perceive them to move,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a distance effect.</p>
<p>I mean, you see a plane,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s could be going 300 miles an hour.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not because of the lack of resolution.</p>
<p>The lack of resolution is incidental.</p>
<p>We know this because in animals such as hawks</p>
<p>that have twice the degree of acuity,</p>
<p>as far as we know,</p>
<p>they have the same distance associated shifts</p>
<p>in time perception.</p>
<p>So could it be that we are running multiple streams</p>
<p>of time perception, multiple cones of attention</p>
<p>that include cones of attention to our thoughts</p>
<p>and that somehow through meditation,</p>
<p>we start to align the frame rate</p>
<p>for these different streams of attention</p>
<p>so that they all fall into the same movie, if you will,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not just a movie with visual content.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m doing here is clearly I&rsquo;m becoming a lumper</p>
<p>rather than a splitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this violates certain rules</p>
<p>of time perception, neural circuitry,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s entirely untrue either.</p>
<p>And does it survive at all as a possible model</p>
<p>for what you&rsquo;re describing?</p>
<p>And if the answer is no,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m perfectly comfortable with that.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s dependent on what you mean by meditation.</p>
<p>This is where you sort of the particularities</p>
<p>of what one is doing with one&rsquo;s attention</p>
<p>under the frame of meditation really matter</p>
<p>because there are ways to practice mindfulness</p>
<p>in particular where the frame rate</p>
<p>really does seem to go way, way up, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually been some research done on this</p>
<p>where you take people before and after</p>
<p>a three month silent meditation retreat</p>
<p>and you give them some kind of visual discrimination task</p>
<p>where they have to like detect,</p>
<p>I think they used a tachistoscope.</p>
<p>Is that the tool for it?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that presents,</p>
<p>you know, like very quick pulses of light.</p>
<p>And in any case, you can discriminate</p>
<p>just in any sensory channel, I would imagine,</p>
<p>you can make finer grain discriminations</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re practicing mindfulness in a very specific way,</p>
<p>which is to be making these fine grain discriminations</p>
<p>more and more and do nothing else</p>
<p>for three months, which is a way of practicing.</p>
<p>So the classic mindfulness practice</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called Vipassana meditation</p>
<p>is to pay scrupulous attention to seeing,</p>
<p>hearing, smelling, tasting, touching</p>
<p>in a way that breaks everything down</p>
<p>into this kind of microscopic sensory moments.</p>
<p>So, you know, you&rsquo;re, rather than feel your, you know,</p>
<p>your hands pressing together,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re trying to feel with your attention</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re feeling more and more</p>
<p>is all of the micro sensations of pressure</p>
<p>and temperature and movement</p>
<p>such that the feeling of hands completely disappears.</p>
<p>You realize that a hand is a concept</p>
<p>and all you have is this cloud of punctate</p>
<p>and very brief sensations.</p>
<p>And so anything you think you have as a datum of experience</p>
<p>as you bore into it with your attention,</p>
<p>it resolves into this kind of diaphanous cloud</p>
<p>of changing sensation.</p>
<p>And that can be even something as captivating</p>
<p>as like a, you know, a serious pain in your body.</p>
<p>I mean, you could have like, you know,</p>
<p>you could have injured your neck, you know,</p>
<p>and so you have some excruciating pain in your neck.</p>
<p>If you just are willing to pay attention to it, you know,</p>
<p>and just pay a hundred percent attention to it,</p>
<p>your, a couple of things happen.</p>
<p>One is your resistance to feeling it goes away by definition</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re now your goal is just pay attention to it.</p>
<p>And you recognize that so much of the suffering</p>
<p>associated with the pain was born of a,</p>
<p>of the resistance to feeling it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of, you&rsquo;re bracing against it</p>
<p>and all of your thinking about it, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking like, well, why did I do this to myself?</p>
<p>Should I see an orthopedist or why,</p>
<p>how long is this going to last?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re, you know, maybe I herniated a disc,</p>
<p>like all of that self-talk is producing anxiety.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s never anything</p>
<p>to think about there, but, you know,</p>
<p>either you can do something about it in the moment</p>
<p>or you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so much of our suffering in the presence of pain</p>
<p>is the result of resisting it, worrying about it.</p>
<p>Think it&rsquo;s just all of the,</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;re doing with our minds,</p>
<p>but just feeling it, right?</p>
<p>So when you just feel it, again, it breaks apart</p>
<p>into this ever-shifting collection of different sensations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not one thing and it never stays the same.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, and so there&rsquo;s two things happen there.</p>
<p>One is there can be a tremendous amount of relief</p>
<p>that happens there where you can achieve a level</p>
<p>of equanimity, even in the presence of really unpleasant,</p>
<p>you know, physical sensation.</p>
<p>And this is true of mental sensation as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s true of emotions, you know,</p>
<p>the classically negative emotions like anger or depression</p>
<p>or, you know, fear.</p>
<p>The moment you become willing to just feel them</p>
<p>in all of their, you know, punctate and changeable qualities</p>
<p>they cease to be what they were a moment ago.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just there.</p>
<p>And they, when you&rsquo;re talking about emotional states,</p>
<p>they cease to map back onto you and your self-concept</p>
<p>as meaningful in the same way.</p>
<p>So that suddenly, you know, the anxiety you feel,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say before going out on stage to give a talk,</p>
<p>you know, a moment ago, it was, it had psychological meaning.</p>
<p>It felt like, you know, okay, I&rsquo;m anxious.</p>
<p>How do I get rid of this?</p>
<p>You know, why am I this sort of person?</p>
<p>Why, you know, should I have taken a beta blocker?</p>
<p>You know, this is the conversation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having with yourself.</p>
<p>The moment you just become willing to feel it</p>
<p>as the pure energy of the physiology of, you know,</p>
<p>of cortisol release, it ceases to have any meaning.</p>
<p>It just, it ceases to be a problem in that moment</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s no more, it no more maps</p>
<p>onto the kind of person you are</p>
<p>than a feeling of indigestion or a pain in your knee</p>
<p>maps onto the kind of person you are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just sensation.</p>
<p>Anyway, but back to the main point here,</p>
<p>which is that if you train your attention in this way</p>
<p>to notice the particularities of sensory experience</p>
<p>and emotional experience, like you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>for the atoms of experience, you know,</p>
<p>you get better and better at that.</p>
<p>And certain things happen.</p>
<p>But one thing that, you know,</p>
<p>one thing that I really do think happens</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a kind of frame rate change in,</p>
<p>in the data stream where you really are just,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just noticing much, much more.</p>
<p>All of that is a very interesting way of training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what I tend to recommend now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great preliminary practice for what I do recommend</p>
<p>because it gives you, it really teaches you the difference</p>
<p>between being lost and thought and not.</p>
<p>It really teaches you what mindfulness is,</p>
<p>but it tends to be done, you know,</p>
<p>by 99.9% of people in a dualistic way,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re, again, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re set up to think,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m over here as the locus of attention, you know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m continually getting distracted by thought.</p>
<p>And the project is to not do that anymore</p>
<p>and actually pay attention to the breath</p>
<p>and sounds and sensations.</p>
<p>And, and every time I get lost in thought,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go back to here,</p>
<p>but this whole dance of I&rsquo;m lost in thought.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m, now I&rsquo;m strategically directing my attention again.</p>
<p>All of this seems to ramify this sense of self,</p>
<p>the sense of there&rsquo;s one to be doing this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody holding the spotlight of attention</p>
<p>and getting better at coming back</p>
<p>to the object of meditation.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s inevitable that 99.9% of people</p>
<p>are going to start there and stay there</p>
<p>for some considerable period of time.</p>
<p>But the thing I like to do when I talk about all of this</p>
<p>is undercut the false assumptions</p>
<p>that are anchoring all of that as early as possible,</p>
<p>because where I think you want to be</p>
<p>is recognizing that there is no place</p>
<p>from which to aim attention, right?</p>
<p>This whole dualistic setup of subject and object</p>
<p>is the thing that is already not there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that you, it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>and you meditated out of existence successfully.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not there.</p>
<p>And if you, if you learn how to look for it,</p>
<p>you can see that it&rsquo;s not there and feel that it&rsquo;s not there</p>
<p>and it no longer seems to be there, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not, and it becomes like, again,</p>
<p>like a bistable percept where you looked at it long enough</p>
<p>and you thought, okay, now I see the vase and the face</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t unsee it.</p>
<p>And every time I look, it&rsquo;s there again, right?</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I mean, so to come back to the example</p>
<p>you gave with your colleague at Stanford,</p>
<p>whose book I know I have, I haven&rsquo;t read it.</p>
<p>This is a, he wrote a book, Projections, right?</p>
<p>Deseroth, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s on my stack to read, but it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m recommending essentially the opposite end</p>
<p>of the continuum of the sort of internal exercise</p>
<p>he was doing.</p>
<p>So rather than, so, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing something very deliberate and controlled</p>
<p>and he is deliberately thinking in complete sentences</p>
<p>and kind of commandeering the machinery of thought</p>
<p>and attention in a way that I would imagine,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d be interested to talk to him about it,</p>
<p>but I would imagine he really feels like he&rsquo;s doing that,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s an engineer.</p>
<p>As you describe it in this way, it reminds me,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a physician, but he&rsquo;s also an engineer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really about taking the raw materials of thought</p>
<p>and engineering something structured from it.</p>
<p>I think, you know, I haven&rsquo;t been in Carl&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if we got him talking on that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we would get a sense of what it is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do that conversation at some point.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the exact opposite of what you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>The exact opposite would be to recognize</p>
<p>that the sense of control is a total illusion, right?</p>
<p>It could, because you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to think next, right?</p>
<p>And even he, in the most laborious way, I mean,</p>
<p>he could just get as muscular as he wants with it.</p>
<p>He still doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s going to think next,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Because thoughts simply arise, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, you can run this experiment for yourself</p>
<p>and this connects up to the topic of free will,</p>
<p>which we might want to touch.</p>
<p>But, I mean, just think of any category of thing.</p>
<p>You know, if I asked you to think of, you know,</p>
<p>the names of cities or of, you know, friends you have</p>
<p>or of famous people you can, you know, remember exist</p>
<p>or think of nouns or, you know, anything.</p>
<p>And just watch what comes percolating</p>
<p>into consciousness, right?</p>
<p>Now, there are things you can&rsquo;t think of, right?</p>
<p>There are things you don&rsquo;t know the name of.</p>
<p>You know, there are languages you don&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>There are famous people you&rsquo;ve never seen</p>
<p>or never heard of, right?</p>
<p>So you have no control over that part.</p>
<p>Like those names and faces are not going</p>
<p>to suddenly come streaming into consciousness.</p>
<p>But of the totality of facts and figures and faces</p>
<p>and names that you do know, right?</p>
<p>Only some will come vying for inclusion, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not, and there&rsquo;s a sort of, you know,</p>
<p>we could make guess that we know something</p>
<p>about the neurology of this, but we, you know,</p>
<p>depending on what channel you&rsquo;re waiting for thoughts in.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s going to be different if it&rsquo;s visual</p>
<p>or semantic or episodic memory.</p>
<p>I mean, all of these things are different,</p>
<p>but wherever you kind of point your inner gaze</p>
<p>of attention and wait for the next face or name,</p>
<p>certain things are going to come</p>
<p>and certain things aren&rsquo;t going to come.</p>
<p>And how you land on one, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be this process.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re paying attention, you might think,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll say we go with names of cities, right?</p>
<p>You just say, you&rsquo;ll think of Paris.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll think of London.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll think of Rome.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll think of Sedona.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll think like, so these names will come.</p>
<p>And if I ask you to just say one, right?</p>
<p>So just-</p>
<p>Minneapolis is what came to mind.</p>
<p>For me, it was very straightforward.</p>
<p>It was Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The famous person was Joe Strummer.</p>
<p>And they just, like, I can give you reasons</p>
<p>why I think those came to mind, recent conversations.</p>
<p>Okay, so we know a fair bit about much of this.</p>
<p>So one, we know that your reasons,</p>
<p>obviously could be right or wrong.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very likely to be wrong</p>
<p>because we have this sort of confabulatory</p>
<p>storytelling mechanism, even in an intact brain</p>
<p>where we just, we seem to never lack</p>
<p>for the reasons why something came to mind.</p>
<p>And we can know we can manipulate people</p>
<p>in ways that prove that people are just reliably wrong</p>
<p>and confident, you know, confidently so</p>
<p>about the reasons why they thought of things or did things.</p>
<p>But leaving that aside,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re completely accurate, right?</p>
<p>There are people&rsquo;s names who you know</p>
<p>and city&rsquo;s names that you know</p>
<p>that inexplicably just didn&rsquo;t come to mind.</p>
<p>And if we ran this experiment again and again and again,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t come to mind if your brain</p>
<p>was in precisely the state it was in a moment ago.</p>
<p>If we could return your brain to the state</p>
<p>it was in a moment ago,</p>
<p>correcting for, you know, all the deterministic changes</p>
<p>and all the random changes that would have to,</p>
<p>you know, be corrected for to just get all the synapses</p>
<p>and the synaptic weights and, you know,</p>
<p>everything in the state it was in</p>
<p>to produce Joe Strummer in Minneapolis, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to, if we rewind that movie,</p>
<p>that part of the movie of your life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to say Joe Strummer in Minneapolis</p>
<p>a trillion times in a row, right?</p>
<p>So this is why, in my view,</p>
<p>the notion of free will makes absolutely no sense, right?</p>
<p>And you can add as much randomness</p>
<p>to that process as you want.</p>
<p>It still doesn&rsquo;t get you the freedom</p>
<p>people think they have.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another conversation to have about, you know,</p>
<p>why none of that matters and why things only get better</p>
<p>once you admit to yourself that free will is an illusion.</p>
<p>And yes, you can get in shape and you can diet</p>
<p>and you can do all the things you want to do</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to think about free will.</p>
<p>But from a contemplative meditative point of view,</p>
<p>the thing to notice is that everything</p>
<p>is just springing into view, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, there&rsquo;s no place from which you are authoring</p>
<p>your next thought because you would have to think it</p>
<p>before you think it, right?</p>
<p>Like there is just this fundamental mystery at our backs</p>
<p>that is disgorging everything that we experience.</p>
<p>What if I&rsquo;m speaking?</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m talking about something</p>
<p>and I have some command of that information,</p>
<p>I can often sense what I&rsquo;m going to say next</p>
<p>and then find myself saying it.</p>
<p>Hopefully that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying, not something else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly said things I didn&rsquo;t intend to say</p>
<p>or never thought I would say in life,</p>
<p>but when engaged in speech or action,</p>
<p>it at least gives us the illusion, I think,</p>
<p>that we somehow have more command over our thoughts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you have a script.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like there are things you know a lot about</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve talked about them a lot</p>
<p>and you know you have the things you want to say</p>
<p>about those things and the things you don&rsquo;t want to say</p>
<p>or you wouldn&rsquo;t want to say.</p>
<p>And you know you can,</p>
<p>it still is a bit of a high wire act</p>
<p>because you can misspeak</p>
<p>or you can fail to get to the end of a sentence</p>
<p>in a grammatically correct way.</p>
<p>And again, all of this subjectively,</p>
<p>this whole process is mysterious to you, right?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t know how you follow</p>
<p>the rules of English grammar, right?</p>
<p>Like your tongue is doing it somehow</p>
<p>and when it fails, it fails</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just as surprised as the next guy that it failed.</p>
<p>And you mispronounce a word and,</p>
<p>okay, I don&rsquo;t know what happened there,</p>
<p>but if it keeps happening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to worry I had a stroke.</p>
<p>And if it stops, I&rsquo;m not going to worry about it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still mysterious,</p>
<p>even when you&rsquo;re doing it in a very rote,</p>
<p>deliberative and repetitive way.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re talking about something</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked about a lot</p>
<p>and you know, you sort of know where you&rsquo;re going to go, right?</p>
<p>Like, and this is, you know,</p>
<p>we have many conversations like this.</p>
<p>It is somewhat analogous to like a golf swing</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, you know how you want to do it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be all kinds of errors</p>
<p>that are going to creep into your execution of it</p>
<p>in real time.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s like, you basically have a pattern.</p>
<p>And so you have certain linguistic patterns</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re following.</p>
<p>Again, none of this is a proof of free will,</p>
<p>but I will grant you that, you know,</p>
<p>phenomenologically it feels different</p>
<p>than just waiting for the next thought to come.</p>
<p>But my point is that even if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I mean, you can trim it down to the simplest possible thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you take two things you like to drink, right?</p>
<p>You may, you like coffee and you like tea</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re deciding which to have, right?</p>
<p>Both are on offer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got two cups in front of you.</p>
<p>And the question is, you know, which, you know,</p>
<p>or here I&rsquo;ve got water and I&rsquo;ve got coffee,</p>
<p>which am I going to drink next?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly, it&rsquo;s the simplest possible decision.</p>
<p>And no matter how long I make this decision process,</p>
<p>I could literally sit for an hour trying to figure out</p>
<p>which to reach for next.</p>
<p>And I could have my reasons why,</p>
<p>and I could have all my self-talk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a final change in me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be the proximate cause</p>
<p>of me deciding one over the other.</p>
<p>And that no matter how laborious I can make it seem</p>
<p>in terms of my reasoning about it,</p>
<p>it is going to be fundamentally mysterious</p>
<p>as to why I went with one rather than the other, right?</p>
<p>Whatever story I have, because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still going to be as mysterious</p>
<p>as you thinking of Joe Strummer</p>
<p>when you absolutely, like,</p>
<p>you know of the existence of Marilyn Monroe just as much.</p>
<p>And yet she simply didn&rsquo;t occur to you, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s fundamentally mysterious.</p>
<p>Like there are people who are even more famous</p>
<p>than Joe Strummer to you, right?</p>
<p>Who, I mean, I&rsquo;m sure he may be somebody</p>
<p>who you have thought a lot about,</p>
<p>but there are people who,</p>
<p>like if we could just inventory, you know,</p>
<p>your conscious life going back the last 10 years,</p>
<p>there are people who you&rsquo;ve thought about</p>
<p>more than Joe Strummer, yet they didn&rsquo;t appear, right?</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s, that is mysterious, right?</p>
<p>And they could have, but they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so, and what I&rsquo;m saying is that</p>
<p>this mystery never gets banished in our experience,</p>
<p>whatever stories we have to tell about it.</p>
<p>Like, because if the story is,</p>
<p>oh, well, I went for the water</p>
<p>because I, you know,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve been drinking too much coffee.</p>
<p>You know, I listened to Andrew Huberman&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>and he was talking about caffeine</p>
<p>and I think I probably-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for us, but you don&rsquo;t want to overdo it, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s say that is actually the causal chain.</p>
<p>Like I listened to your podcast,</p>
<p>you said something about caffeine.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m self-conscious about my coffee intake, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just adding a couple of links to the chain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still this fundamental mystery of,</p>
<p>well, why did I find that persuasive?</p>
<p>And why did I find it persuasive now</p>
<p>and not five minutes ago when I was drinking the coffee?</p>
<p>Right, like, why did I just remember it now?</p>
<p>Or why was it effective now?</p>
<p>Like, you only have,</p>
<p>your experience in every moment</p>
<p>is precisely what it is and not one bit more.</p>
<p>Like, and this subsumes even moments of real resolve</p>
<p>and effort and, you know,</p>
<p>picking yourself up by your bootstraps</p>
<p>and changing everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re on a diet</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re tempted to eat chocolate</p>
<p>and you think you&rsquo;re about to reach,</p>
<p>and you say, no, I&rsquo;m not breaking this diet.</p>
<p>This diet is actually going to stick, right?</p>
<p>Okay, why did that arise in that moment</p>
<p>and not at this analogous moment on your last diet, right?</p>
<p>And why did it arise now</p>
<p>to precisely the degree that it did?</p>
<p>Why will it be as effective as it will be</p>
<p>and have the half-life that it will have</p>
<p>and not, you know, 10% more or less?</p>
<p>Like, all of those are always mysterious to you.</p>
<p>Well, could we give a, as we did before,</p>
<p>an evolutionary and a developmental explanation?</p>
<p>An evolutionary explanation might be</p>
<p>that directed attention and action</p>
<p>is metabolically demanding.</p>
<p>It would be inefficient or impossible</p>
<p>for us to be in constant, you know, deliberate action</p>
<p>and with access to all the relevant information</p>
<p>as to why we would do anything.</p>
<p>So our ideas literally spring to the surface</p>
<p>at the last possible moment</p>
<p>in order to offset the metabolic,</p>
<p>the great metabolic requirements of having ideas</p>
<p>that are related to goal-directed action</p>
<p>or that goal-directed action is expensive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one idea.</p>
<p>The other idea would be, and we know this as a fact,</p>
<p>which is that initially the brain is fairly crudely wired.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true within the neural circuits</p>
<p>that control breathing, heart rate, et cetera,</p>
<p>but within the neural circuits of sensory perception,</p>
<p>thought, et cetera, they&rsquo;re fairly crudely wired.</p>
<p>And then across development,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a progressive pruning back</p>
<p>and also in parallel to that,</p>
<p>a strengthening of the connections</p>
<p>that underlie directed action and thought.</p>
<p>And here, I don&rsquo;t mean directed as in free will.</p>
<p>I mean, just that I can decide to imagine an apple</p>
<p>and imagine that apple, for instance.</p>
<p>There seems to be some maintenance</p>
<p>of the fine random wiring in systems.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve seen this even in worms,</p>
<p>in flies, in so-called lower invertebrates</p>
<p>and lower vertebrates.</p>
<p>And we see this in humans.</p>
<p>And it seems to be that there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of background spontaneous activity.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve sunk electrodes into the brains</p>
<p>of humans, macaques, carnivores, and mice.</p>
<p>And in every case, most of what you hear is called hash.</p>
<p>And it has nothing to do with hashish,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just on the audio monitor,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re picking up a bunch of action potentials.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re listening to a chorus of action potentials,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s rare to find a neuron that faithfully fires</p>
<p>to represent some sensory stimulus in the world.</p>
<p>And you can arrange that marriage experimentally</p>
<p>so that you can arrive</p>
<p>at those strong signal-to-noise events.</p>
<p>But I was always struck by how much noise there is</p>
<p>in the system all around, all the time.</p>
<p>And people argue, is the noise really noise, et cetera?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still a lot of debate about that.</p>
<p>But I can imagine that some of the spontaneous nature</p>
<p>of thoughts just relates to the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of background spontaneous activity</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>Now, why that is, is a whole other discussion.</p>
<p>But if I were to sort of set up two constraints</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of spontaneous activity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to generate random thoughts.</p>
<p>Thankfully, not much random action,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s a little bit of random action</p>
<p>in our daily lives.</p>
<p>And then against that, say, well, any deliberate thought</p>
<p>or motion is going to be expensive, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a metabolically expensive organ to begin with.</p>
<p>And so you just have to, evolution has arrived at a place</p>
<p>where spontaneous geysering up of things</p>
<p>upon which deliberate thoughts and action are superimposed</p>
<p>is the best arrangement overall</p>
<p>for this very metabolically demanding organ.</p>
<p>Is that, I mean, what I basically gave</p>
<p>was just kind of a biological description</p>
<p>of just one narrow aspect of it.</p>
<p>But can we get comfortable with that?</p>
<p>And the reason I say get comfortable is that,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m here,</p>
<p>admittedly, I&rsquo;m forcing a little bit of a striptease</p>
<p>towards what I think I and everyone else wants to know,</p>
<p>which is how to meditate</p>
<p>and why in particular meditation convinces us</p>
<p>that something doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be eliminated,</p>
<p>but that was actually never there.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re now set up sort of almost like a,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not contradicting yourself by any means,</p>
<p>but in my mind there&rsquo;s a contradiction</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the contradiction.</p>
<p>I love this statement that meditation over time</p>
<p>or done properly reveals to us</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re actually not trying to make the gap</p>
<p>between actor and observer go away.</p>
<p>It was actually never there.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s one of the more important statements</p>
<p>that I perhaps have ever heard.</p>
<p>And it inspires me to go further down</p>
<p>this path of meditation</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve never experienced that,</p>
<p>not deliberately and certainly not through meditation.</p>
<p>If I ever experienced it, it was transient enough</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m intrigued to experience it more.</p>
<p>So on the one hand,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re telling me something was never there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a profound experience to be had</p>
<p>by anyone that&rsquo;s willing to do the work</p>
<p>to arrive at that experience of the loss of that illusion.</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing that there&rsquo;s a profound gap</p>
<p>that really does exist,</p>
<p>which is that we believe that our thoughts</p>
<p>are somehow from us</p>
<p>and indeed they&rsquo;re from in the cranial vault someplace,</p>
<p>maybe in the body a bit as well,</p>
<p>but that we over attribute the degree</p>
<p>to which we are that and that is us</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s volitional, that we control.</p>
<p>And so once I&rsquo;m hearing that there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an illusion that we can eliminate.</p>
<p>And on the other hand,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing that there&rsquo;s an illusion that we can&rsquo;t eliminate</p>
<p>and maybe these are unrelated</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m bridging them in an unimportant way</p>
<p>that seems only important to me,</p>
<p>but somehow I can&rsquo;t resolve these two.</p>
<p>And maybe the thing to do then is,</p>
<p>can we separate them in terms of a practice to witness them</p>
<p>that would allow us to resolve them separately?</p>
<p>Right, so I think I&rsquo;m hearing the problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this, well, let me kind of bracket</p>
<p>the whole free will discussion</p>
<p>because it really is the flip side of this coin</p>
<p>that the obverse of which is the illusion of the self.</p>
<p>Okay, so at least I might be on the right track.</p>
<p>They are the opposite sides of a coin.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>To me, they seem very different in essence.</p>
<p>No, because what I&rsquo;m calling the sense of self</p>
<p>and what I think most people feel</p>
<p>as their core sense of self is this feeling of,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the feeling of being the locus of attention,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the feeling of being the locus of agency.</p>
<p>Like I can do the next thing.</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s doing this?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s reaching for the cup?</p>
<p>I am, right?</p>
<p>I intended this and now I&rsquo;m doing the thing.</p>
<p>And my conscious intention</p>
<p>is the proximate cause of my reaching, right?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m the author of my thoughts and actions essentially</p>
<p>and my specific uses of attention, right?</p>
<p>So I can pay attention to the breath.</p>
<p>I get lost in thought.</p>
<p>I come back to the breath.</p>
<p>But on some level, the thoughts themselves</p>
<p>are more of my doing something</p>
<p>with almost a authorial intent, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m thinking like,</p>
<p>what the hell is this guy talking about?</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m thinking,</p>
<p>I know who&rsquo;s thinking these thoughts.</p>
<p>I am, right?</p>
<p>Like the person who really doesn&rsquo;t get what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>is thinking something like that, right?</p>
<p>What the fuck is this guy talking about?</p>
<p>Like I know I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a self, I&rsquo;m a body, I&rsquo;m a mind.</p>
<p>I can reach for things that these intentional actions</p>
<p>are different from things that happened to me, right?</p>
<p>A voluntary action is different from an involuntary one.</p>
<p>So having a tremor is different</p>
<p>from consciously deciding to pick up a glass, right?</p>
<p>So obviously everything I&rsquo;m saying about meditation</p>
<p>and the self and free will</p>
<p>in order to be a sane picture of a human mind</p>
<p>and of reality has to conserve the data of experience</p>
<p>such that, yes, I can acknowledge the difference</p>
<p>between a tremor and a deliberative,</p>
<p>voluntary motor action.</p>
<p>And the things you do volitionally are different,</p>
<p>not just psychologically and behaviorally,</p>
<p>but they just have different implications</p>
<p>for like in a court of law,</p>
<p>you accidentally hit someone with your car</p>
<p>or you did it on purpose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still a distinction that matters, right?</p>
<p>Importantly, it tells us a lot about the global properties</p>
<p>of your mind such that we have a sense</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re likely to do in the future.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re someone who likes running over people</p>
<p>with your car, you&rsquo;re a psychopath</p>
<p>who we need to worry about.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re someone who did it by accident,</p>
<p>well then you may be culpable for the level of negligence</p>
<p>that allowed that to happen,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re a very different person</p>
<p>and we treat you differently and we&rsquo;re wise to.</p>
<p>So anyway, let&rsquo;s bracket all of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this, I mean, there&rsquo;s some fundamental,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some false assumptions</p>
<p>about the underlying logic of this process,</p>
<p>which I think it&rsquo;s worth addressing.</p>
<p>And it was actually, there&rsquo;s a kind of found object</p>
<p>in the news that I talk about at one point,</p>
<p>I forget where it is in the Waking Up app,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a story that I stumbled on</p>
<p>on the internet.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s about 12 or 13 years old</p>
<p>of a tourist bus in, I think it was Norway.</p>
<p>It was somewhere in Northern Europe</p>
<p>and it had about 30 people on it.</p>
<p>And one person was described as an Asian woman</p>
<p>and they went to a rest stop and everyone got off the bus</p>
<p>and they shopped and had lunch.</p>
<p>And this Asian woman changed her clothing</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>And they all got back on the bus.</p>
<p>I think the relevance of it being an Asian woman</p>
<p>is that there were language barriers</p>
<p>that explained what later happened.</p>
<p>So everyone gets back on the bus,</p>
<p>the Asian woman has changed her clothing</p>
<p>and the bus is about to leave,</p>
<p>but then someone notices,</p>
<p>hey, there was an Asian woman who got off the bus</p>
<p>who hasn&rsquo;t come back yet.</p>
<p>And they tell the driver this and this poses a problem.</p>
<p>So now everyone&rsquo;s waiting for this person to return.</p>
<p>But in fact, everyone was on the bus</p>
<p>that this woman had just changed her clothing</p>
<p>and was not recognized by her fellow travelers.</p>
<p>So everyone gets concerned as this tourist doesn&rsquo;t show up</p>
<p>and they start looking for her, right?</p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t find her.</p>
<p>And so a search party is formed and the Asian woman,</p>
<p>because of whatever language barrier,</p>
<p>heard that there was a missing tourist.</p>
<p>So she joins the search party,</p>
<p>which in fact is looking for her, right?</p>
<p>And this goes on into the night</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re readying helicopters for a dawn patrol</p>
<p>to find the missing tourist.</p>
<p>Now at some point along the way,</p>
<p>I think it was at like three in the morning,</p>
<p>this tourist realizes that she is the object</p>
<p>of this search, right?</p>
<p>And obviously the whole thing unravels.</p>
<p>She confesses that she changed her clothes</p>
<p>and the problem is solved,</p>
<p>but the problem is not solved by the logic</p>
<p>that the seeker is expected, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not true to say</p>
<p>that the missing tourist was found</p>
<p>in the way that was expected, right?</p>
<p>Because the missing tourist was never lost.</p>
<p>The missing tourist was part of the search party, right?</p>
<p>And so when you think about it from her point of view,</p>
<p>like what happened, she&rsquo;s part of the search party.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s looking for the missing tourist,</p>
<p>not knowing that she in fact is the missing tourist.</p>
<p>So what happens at the moment she realizes</p>
<p>that everyone&rsquo;s looking for her, right?</p>
<p>Like what is, the search isn&rsquo;t consummated</p>
<p>in the way that is implied</p>
<p>by the logic of everyone&rsquo;s use of attention.</p>
<p>And yet the problem evaporates</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something deeply analogous</p>
<p>about the structure of that and the meditative journey.</p>
<p>Precisely in, again, not talking about all the changes</p>
<p>and the possible changes in the contents of consciousness</p>
<p>that could be good, which again,</p>
<p>they come along for the ride anyway</p>
<p>when you do the thing I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on this point of looking for the self</p>
<p>and not finding it.</p>
<p>And there is this sense that, okay,</p>
<p>the self is here and it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>It is the string upon which all of my conscious states,</p>
<p>mostly unhappy ones are strung, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that is at the center of my anxiety.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that I don&rsquo;t feel good about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that when criticized, I sort of let implode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the center of my problem.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m trying to feel better</p>
<p>and meditation has been handed to me</p>
<p>as a possible remedy for my situation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s billed as a remedy.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m hearing from this guy</p>
<p>that this is the thing that is gonna cause me to realize</p>
<p>that myself isn&rsquo;t where, or as I thought it was.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m gonna look, right?</p>
<p>And so again, the sense is I start out</p>
<p>far away from the goal here.</p>
<p>I start out with a problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now meditating on the evidence of my unenlightenment.</p>
<p>I can feel my problem.</p>
<p>I feel that I&rsquo;m distracted and distractible.</p>
<p>And I feel as this sort of cramp</p>
<p>at the center of my life, it&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not as happy as I wanna be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as confident as I wanna be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more distractible than I wanna be.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m paying attention to the breath, right?</p>
<p>This is what the search party feels like.</p>
<p>This is what the confused tourist feels like</p>
<p>in her own search party.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s looking for the missing person.</p>
<p>And so the angle of, the inclination of all of this is,</p>
<p>and the logic of it is all wrong, understandably so,</p>
<p>given how we all get into this situation.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s useful to continually try to undercut it</p>
<p>and recognize that the thing that&rsquo;s being looked for</p>
<p>is actually right on the surface,</p>
<p>there is no one looking.</p>
<p>There is no place from which,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re paying attention to the breath or to sounds</p>
<p>or noticing the next thought arise,</p>
<p>this sense that you are over here doing that thing</p>
<p>is actually what it&rsquo;s like to be thinking</p>
<p>and not knowing that you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thought, there&rsquo;s an undercurrent of thought</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going uninspected in that moment.</p>
<p>And so there is just a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a continually looking for the mind,</p>
<p>a looking for the center of experience,</p>
<p>a looking for the one who is looking,</p>
<p>which again, which is the kind of the orienting practice</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot more I say about this, obviously,</p>
<p>over at Waking Up,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the experiment you have to perform</p>
<p>in order to get ready to recognize that this whole,</p>
<p>the search party was formed in error, essentially.</p>
<p>And the problem that you&rsquo;re trying to solve</p>
<p>with this practice does evaporate in a similar way,</p>
<p>which is like, you don&rsquo;t actually get there</p>
<p>in the way that you&rsquo;re hoping for, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you drop out the bottom of this thing</p>
<p>in an unexpected way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s actually another kind of a similar</p>
<p>parable or anecdote that I don&rsquo;t remember if it&rsquo;s Zen</p>
<p>or Sufi, or I mean, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s been reappropriated</p>
<p>in many different ways, but, or by many different traditions.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s this, you know, the case of somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s lost in a town and they&rsquo;re asking for directions,</p>
<p>you know, you could put this in Manhattan.</p>
<p>You can, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re wandering Manhattan</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a tourist, you don&rsquo;t know where anything is.</p>
<p>And you stop and ask someone, you know,</p>
<p>where is Central Park?</p>
<p>And the person thinks for a second, they says, oh yeah,</p>
<p>unfortunately you can&rsquo;t get to Central Park from here.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Now that is a very strange, I mean,</p>
<p>if you think about that for a second, you realize,</p>
<p>okay, that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s an absurd claim.</p>
<p>There is no place that you can&rsquo;t get to from the place</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re starting, you know, on earth, right?</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a failure to describe the physical relationships</p>
<p>between anything in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s just not the world we live in, right?</p>
<p>So, but it&rsquo;s a funny thing, but on some level,</p>
<p>that is true of meditation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can&rsquo;t get there from here.</p>
<p>Like the sense of you, the sense of you as subject</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t brought along to this thing you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re, you know, it&rsquo;s almost like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re making a fist</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to get to an open hand.</p>
<p>The fist doesn&rsquo;t get to take that journey as a fist.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t, the fist doesn&rsquo;t go along for the ride.</p>
<p>The fist comes apart, right?</p>
<p>And on some level that our subjectivity is a,</p>
<p>kind of an intentional fist.</p>
<p>You know, it is a contraction of energy.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s so much bound up in thought</p>
<p>for most of us, most of the time.</p>
<p>That is, and when properly inspected,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just this, you know,</p>
<p>evaporation of the starting point.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not this, there&rsquo;s not this fulfillment of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get this fist, it&rsquo;s going to just going to,</p>
<p>if I, you know, if life gets good enough,</p>
<p>if I get concentrated enough, focused enough,</p>
<p>you know, if I austere enough, if I renounce enough,</p>
<p>if I desire less, if I, you know,</p>
<p>you know, with enough good intentions,</p>
<p>this fist is going to move</p>
<p>into some sort of sublime condition, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the logic of the process.</p>
<p>I really appreciate these models and analogies</p>
<p>for conscious experience,</p>
<p>both as most people experience them and harbor them.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s as a way to frame what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>through a proper meditation practice.</p>
<p>I do want to talk about what a proper meditation practice</p>
<p>looks like a bit.</p>
<p>But at some point, I do want to raise a model</p>
<p>of maybe even just perceptual awareness</p>
<p>to see if it survives the filters that you&rsquo;ve provided.</p>
<p>But first, just even if briefly,</p>
<p>and then we could return to it,</p>
<p>you know, what does this meditation practice</p>
<p>or set of practices look like?</p>
<p>Obviously, the app is a wonderful tool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started using it, as I mentioned in the beginning,</p>
<p>my father&rsquo;s been using it for a while,</p>
<p>and many people have derived great benefit from it.</p>
<p>But if we were to break it down meditation</p>
<p>into some basic component parts,</p>
<p>as we have broken down normal perceptual experience</p>
<p>and some of its component parts,</p>
<p>I can just throw out some things</p>
<p>that I associate with meditation,</p>
<p>and maybe you can elaborate on how these</p>
<p>may or may not be applied.</p>
<p>For instance, there is almost always</p>
<p>a ceasing of robust motor movement.</p>
<p>I know there are walking meditations and so forth,</p>
<p>but it seems like sitting or lying down</p>
<p>and perhaps not always, but often,</p>
<p>limiting our visual perception, closing the eyes,</p>
<p>right, directing a mind&rsquo;s eye someplace.</p>
<p>Is there a dedicated effort toward generating imagery?</p>
<p>What are the component parts?</p>
<p>And where I&rsquo;m really going with this is</p>
<p>why would those component parts eventually</p>
<p>allow for this disillusion of the fist</p>
<p>or the realization that there is no distinction</p>
<p>between actor and observer and so on?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, well, so to answer that second question first,</p>
<p>ultimately meditation is not a practice</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re adding to your life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a doing more of anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually ceasing to do something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately non-distraction.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s ultimately you&rsquo;re recognizing</p>
<p>what consciousness is like when you&rsquo;re no longer distracted</p>
<p>by the automatic arising of thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that thoughts don&rsquo;t arise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you can&rsquo;t use them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;ve become irrational</p>
<p>or unintelligent.</p>
<p>I mean, all of that, you still have all of your tools,</p>
<p>but everything is in plain view.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s an analogy in Tibetan Buddhism,</p>
<p>which I love, which is kind of in the final stage</p>
<p>of meditation, thoughts are like thieves</p>
<p>entering an empty house.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s nothing for them to steal, right?</p>
<p>So in the usual case, thoughts are,</p>
<p>there really is something in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Every time a thought comes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not meditating anymore.</p>
<p>And not only that, I feel terrible</p>
<p>because of what I&rsquo;m thinking about most of the time, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s totally understandable</p>
<p>that thoughts seem like a problem in the beginning.</p>
<p>And for certain types of meditation,</p>
<p>they are explicitly thought of as a problem</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to focus on one thing</p>
<p>to the exclusion of everything else, including thought.</p>
<p>And that is what I called concentration practice earlier.</p>
<p>And that is a, you know, that&rsquo;s a training</p>
<p>that can be good to do.</p>
<p>It becomes a tool that you can use</p>
<p>for other kinds of insight,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very specific</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of brittle skill in the end.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a skill,</p>
<p>just like I&rsquo;m gonna pay attention to one thing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna do that so well</p>
<p>that everything else is gonna fade out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s somewhat analogous</p>
<p>to what you described in the visual system.</p>
<p>If you have a laser focus to one fixation point,</p>
<p>everything else in your visual field</p>
<p>begins to fade out.</p>
<p>But meditatively, if you have a laser focus</p>
<p>on any one thing, whether it&rsquo;s the breath</p>
<p>or a candle flame or whatever it is,</p>
<p>not only does, I mean,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s use the breath for a second</p>
<p>because your eyes can be closed.</p>
<p>I mean, you can lose all sense of everything.</p>
<p>I mean, you can lose all sense of hearing</p>
<p>and your physical body can disappear.</p>
<p>I mean, like literally it can become incredibly subtle</p>
<p>and vast and drug-like.</p>
<p>And many people approach meditation thinking</p>
<p>kind of climbing the ladder of those changes</p>
<p>into subtlety and vastness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole game, right?</p>
<p>And it can be a deeply rewarding game to play.</p>
<p>And it also does come with all kinds of ancillary benefits.</p>
<p>I mean, all the focus and the calm</p>
<p>and the kind of smoothness of emotional states.</p>
<p>I mean, all of that comes with greater concentration</p>
<p>and it can be quite wonderful.</p>
<p>But again, at best, that&rsquo;s a tool to aim in the direction</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m talking about now with respect to meditation,</p>
<p>which relates to more what I would call</p>
<p>mindfulness generically</p>
<p>and ultimately kind of non-dual mindfulness.</p>
<p>So mindfulness generically, and for most people,</p>
<p>certainly in the beginning, dualistically</p>
<p>is just the practice of paying careful attention</p>
<p>to whatever is arising on its own, right?</p>
<p>Now, in the beginning, it&rsquo;s natural to take a single object</p>
<p>like the breath as a starting point, it&rsquo;s kind of an anchor.</p>
<p>But very, very quickly over the course of even</p>
<p>your first week of doing this,</p>
<p>teachers and various sources of information will recommend</p>
<p>that once you get some facility,</p>
<p>once you know the difference between being lost in thought</p>
<p>and actually paying attention to the breath,</p>
<p>well, then you can open it up to everything.</p>
<p>You can open it up to sounds and other sensations</p>
<p>in the body and moods and emotions</p>
<p>and even ultimately thoughts themselves.</p>
<p>And so very quickly, you can recognize that</p>
<p>thoughts are not intrinsically the enemy to this practice.</p>
<p>They are also just spontaneous appearances</p>
<p>in consciousness that can be observed.</p>
<p>But for some considerable period of time,</p>
<p>people will feel that there is a place</p>
<p>from which that observation is happening, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;m now the one who&rsquo;s being mindful.</p>
<p>And however attenuated that sense of self can be,</p>
<p>I mean, again, it can get very expansive.</p>
<p>I mean, you can lose, as you get anything,</p>
<p>just a modicum of concentration,</p>
<p>you know, it becomes very drug-like and you get,</p>
<p>you know, the boundaries of your body dissolve</p>
<p>and your feeling of having a body can disappear.</p>
<p>And, you know, if your eyes are closed,</p>
<p>you know, your visual field can be,</p>
<p>most people when they close their eyes initially,</p>
<p>they just forget about their visual field.</p>
<p>But, you know, if you close your eyes right now,</p>
<p>you notice your visual field is fully present.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s, we call it dark,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not quite dark.</p>
<p>There is this sort of scintillating</p>
<p>some field of color and shadow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s there in the darkness of your closed eyes.</p>
<p>And that can become a sky-like domain of kind of vast,</p>
<p>you know, visual expression that opens up</p>
<p>as you get more concentrated with, you know,</p>
<p>with your eyes closed, right?</p>
<p>So you can very much be aware of seeing</p>
<p>with your eyes closed in meditative practice.</p>
<p>But from the point of view of mindfulness,</p>
<p>the logic is not to care about any of the interesting</p>
<p>changes in experience that come</p>
<p>as a result of practicing in this way,</p>
<p>because what the underlying goal is,</p>
<p>is to be more and more equanimous with changes.</p>
<p>So not to grasp at what&rsquo;s pleasant or interesting</p>
<p>and not to push what&rsquo;s unpleasant or, you know,</p>
<p>boring or, you know, otherwise non-engaging away.</p>
<p>What you want is just a kind of a sky-like mind</p>
<p>that just allows everything to appear.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not clinging to anything or reacting to anything.</p>
<p>Could I ask you what your thoughts are</p>
<p>about the differences between nouns, adjectives,</p>
<p>and verbs in the context of what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re describing?</p>
<p>And the reason I bring this up is that, as you know,</p>
<p>and I know everything in biology is a process, you know,</p>
<p>we would never ever say, oh, you know,</p>
<p>the perception of that red line on a painting</p>
<p>is a noun, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an event in the visual system.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re abstracting some understanding</p>
<p>about that thing in the outside world.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very useful in thinking about the brain</p>
<p>and people will notice I notice, excuse me,</p>
<p>actively avoid the use of the word mind</p>
<p>because I figure, especially with you sitting across from me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll step in it if I do.</p>
<p>But the brain generates a series of perceptions</p>
<p>or what have you by through processes, not nouns.</p>
<p>And so when thinking about biology,</p>
<p>I think of development as an arc of processes.</p>
<p>Aging is an arc, perception is an arc of processes.</p>
<p>They just exist on different timescales.</p>
<p>And so a little bit of what I&rsquo;m hearing</p>
<p>is that inside of an effective meditation practice,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of a certainly non-judgment,</p>
<p>but discarding of the noun and the adjective</p>
<p>modes of language, like red apple.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s a red apple, but then you sort of need</p>
<p>to eliminate some other adjectives about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rotten apple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, you know, ripe apple.</p>
<p>And instead view the appearance and disappearance</p>
<p>of that apple as a, it&rsquo;s just a thing, a process,</p>
<p>as opposed to an event.</p>
<p>And now events could, we could really get</p>
<p>into the language aspect of that.</p>
<p>That just reveals how diminished language is</p>
<p>to describe the workings of the brain at some level.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if any of this resonates,</p>
<p>but it seems to me the goal or one of the goals</p>
<p>is to start to understand the algorithm</p>
<p>that is the fleeting nature of perception,</p>
<p>but to not focus on any one single perception.</p>
<p>And then to not even focus on one single algorithm,</p>
<p>but to, at some level, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>what is revealed to the meditator over time</p>
<p>is some sort of macroscopic principle</p>
<p>about the way perceptions work at a deeper level, right?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s sort of a deeper principle there</p>
<p>that sits below our, certainly our normal everyday awareness,</p>
<p>but that in paying attention to the mechanics</p>
<p>of all this stuff and not judging those mechanics,</p>
<p>not naming those mechanics,</p>
<p>or just naming them and let them pass by,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some action function, some verb is revealed.</p>
<p>And that maybe that verb,</p>
<p>maybe the word to describe that verb is mindfulness.</p>
<p>Maybe mindfulness is really just a verb to describe that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But is there anything here or am I creating, am I?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m creating just like useless straw</p>
<p>or if there&rsquo;s actually a seed here of something real.</p>
<p>But to me, anytime I want to understand something</p>
<p>in biology or psychology,</p>
<p>I try and broaden the time domain</p>
<p>and think in terms of verbs, not nouns or adjectives.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s very useful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s somewhat adjacent to this distinction I make</p>
<p>in between dualistic and non-dualistic ways</p>
<p>of experiencing the world.</p>
<p>So even dualistically, everything is still a process, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re misled by the reification</p>
<p>that noun talk gives us.</p>
<p>So, and this applies not just to something like mindfulness,</p>
<p>but even to something like the self, right?</p>
<p>So the sense of self is also a process.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a verb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, so we&rsquo;re selfing more than we are selves, right?</p>
<p>And there, you know, even appropriate uses of the term self</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t go away even when you recognize</p>
<p>that the core subject self is an illusion.</p>
<p>There are states of self, right?</p>
<p>Where you can recognize in your life</p>
<p>that you inhabit very different modes of being</p>
<p>depending on the context.</p>
<p>So like there are moments where you,</p>
<p>just by walking into a certain building,</p>
<p>you suddenly transition into a different state of self.</p>
<p>Like suddenly you pass through a door</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re a customer in a store, right?</p>
<p>So we know what that customer feeling is.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re now the person who&rsquo;s getting the attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very kind of formalized type of attention</p>
<p>from the person who&rsquo;s running the store and, you know,</p>
<p>or a restaurant, you&rsquo;re a customer in a restaurant, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, I just remembered something that&rsquo;s kind of funny</p>
<p>that was born of a mismatch of this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to that in a second.</p>
<p>But so there are, so we go through, you can be a,</p>
<p>you know, you can be a student in the presence of a teacher.</p>
<p>You can be a parent in the presence of a son or a daughter.</p>
<p>You can be a spouse in presence of your spouse.</p>
<p>And all of those shadings of like the change in context</p>
<p>really does usher in some fundamental psychological changes</p>
<p>in just the states of consciousness</p>
<p>that are available to you.</p>
<p>I mean, and it&rsquo;s, and some of this is really, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we could understand a lot about this, you know,</p>
<p>personally and, you know, generically,</p>
<p>but it is pretty mysterious.</p>
<p>I mean, like, I mean, there are people who I know,</p>
<p>who I, you know, I&rsquo;m with them in a certain way.</p>
<p>And like, based on something I&rsquo;m getting off of them,</p>
<p>like, I can&rsquo;t be that, I&rsquo;m effortlessly one way with them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no way I could be that way with somebody else.</p>
<p>Right, like, it&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the pheromones</p>
<p>or their, you know, their facial,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the way they are, their facial expression.</p>
<p>But I mean, there are people with whom</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really kind of effortlessly funny.</p>
<p>And there are people with whom, you know, I couldn&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>it would never occur to me to be funny</p>
<p>no matter what happened, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, and I have like longstanding relationships</p>
<p>with these people, you know?</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s just very, you know,</p>
<p>all of that&rsquo;s very mysterious.</p>
<p>But anyway, the difference there is not in this core sense</p>
<p>of subject in relationship to all the objects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in kind of the states of self.</p>
<p>And all of that is just, is very verby, right?</p>
<p>Like all this is a pattern of changes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pattern of what&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s not available, the capacities that are,</p>
<p>you know, that come online or not in those various contexts.</p>
<p>But no, the memory I just had,</p>
<p>which I hadn&rsquo;t had in a long time,</p>
<p>but it was one of these moments where I realized</p>
<p>the power of these shifts in context for states of self.</p>
<p>So I once, I was a young man,</p>
<p>I think I was probably 22 or so and single.</p>
<p>And like, you&rsquo;re just like trying to figure out</p>
<p>how do you meet women?</p>
<p>And like, how does one get confident to do this well?</p>
<p>And I walked into a restaurant</p>
<p>and a kind of a woman was walking toward me,</p>
<p>you know, toward the front door of the restaurant,</p>
<p>but she was walking toward me in a way where I just</p>
<p>by default assumed she was the hostess in the restaurant,</p>
<p>but she wasn&rsquo;t the hostess.</p>
<p>She was just a, you know,</p>
<p>someone who had just eaten there, I guess.</p>
<p>So I walked through and she comes out.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a fundamental misunderstanding in me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s set up by literally just this change in architecture.</p>
<p>And so I just said hi to her in a way that I would,</p>
<p>presumably I would say hi to any hostess</p>
<p>who was coming up to ask me where I wanted to sit.</p>
<p>But what had actually happened is I had said hi</p>
<p>to a total stranger in a way that I tended at that point,</p>
<p>never to say hi to total strangers,</p>
<p>because I was shy and, you know, it was just like,</p>
<p>but apparently I gave her like a 10,000 watt,</p>
<p>you know, high of like all of the confidence</p>
<p>you would have if you were that sort of person.</p>
<p>And it just ushered in a complete, like, you know,</p>
<p>so I went to my table and this woman,</p>
<p>like came back into the restaurant,</p>
<p>like gave me her phone number, right?</p>
<p>Which was something that was just</p>
<p>completely foreign experience to me, you know?</p>
<p>And it was based completely on my misunderstanding</p>
<p>of the situation I was in, right?</p>
<p>And so anyway-</p>
<p>Among the misunderstandings that one can have</p>
<p>and then action engage in life,</p>
<p>I would say that was a somewhat adaptive one.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then you realize that, okay,</p>
<p>but then there are certain people</p>
<p>who recognize this machinery to whatever degree</p>
<p>or have kind of natural aptitudes</p>
<p>for bringing certain things online or not,</p>
<p>such that, okay, they can make these states,</p>
<p>they can consciously make these states of self,</p>
<p>you know, this level of gregariousness, say,</p>
<p>available to them in different,</p>
<p>in the circumstances where it&rsquo;s actually useful to them.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re single and you want to meet people,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s actually very helpful to feel confident enough</p>
<p>to just go say hi to strangers</p>
<p>and ask them how they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and to be, you know, online, you know, in that way,</p>
<p>where at that point in my life, in that circumstance,</p>
<p>you know, by default, I was going to ignore this stranger</p>
<p>who I was passing by in the doorway of a restaurant,</p>
<p>but thinking she was the hostess,</p>
<p>I was engaging her, you know, fully.</p>
<p>So anyway, you can consciously,</p>
<p>again, this does not invoke free will at all,</p>
<p>but yes, you can consciously decide to play</p>
<p>with these mechanisms such that you can decide</p>
<p>what states of self would be more normative to have,</p>
<p>you know, given what you want in life.</p>
<p>And you can become increasingly, you know,</p>
<p>attentive to the ways in which you get played by the world.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re a kind of instrument,</p>
<p>your mind is a kind of instrument,</p>
<p>your brain is a kind of instrument</p>
<p>that is continually getting played</p>
<p>by the situations you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And you can become more of an intelligent curator</p>
<p>of your conscious states and your conscious capacities</p>
<p>just by noticing the changes in you.</p>
<p>Like I, in graduate school,</p>
<p>this is something I talk about,</p>
<p>I think at some point in waking up,</p>
<p>this became very stark for me because I had,</p>
<p>you know, I was a, you know, an old graduates dude</p>
<p>and I had taken 11 years off at Stanford</p>
<p>between my sophomore and junior year, right?</p>
<p>So I like, when I went back to school-</p>
<p>Talk about a leave of absence.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it was, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But I mean, so Stanford had this, you know,</p>
<p>you might know this,</p>
<p>they have this stop out policy</p>
<p>where you never really drop out, you just stop out.</p>
<p>So you can always go back,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to write letters</p>
<p>saying that you still exist every, you know,</p>
<p>two years as you do in other schools.</p>
<p>So anyway, I showed up after 11 years and,</p>
<p>but, you know, so I was really on a deadline</p>
<p>and I felt late for everything.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of, you know, finishing my degree,</p>
<p>you know, as quickly as I can as an undergraduate.</p>
<p>And then I jump into graduate school</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m an old graduate student and I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real sense of kind of urgency.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m late, I should have done this earlier.</p>
<p>I want to get this stuff done.</p>
<p>But then 9-11 happened.</p>
<p>And I, just as I had finished my coursework at, you know,</p>
<p>getting my PhD and I was just getting into my research,</p>
<p>but 9-11 intersected with my life in such a way</p>
<p>that I just had to drop everything and write my first book.</p>
<p>And I did that.</p>
<p>And then I just had to drop everything</p>
<p>and write my second book</p>
<p>because of the response to the first book.</p>
<p>And so essentially I had like four years</p>
<p>where I was AWOL doing my PhD,</p>
<p>but I was still had a toe in the lab</p>
<p>and I was still showing up occasionally,</p>
<p>but I was becoming this kind of cautionary tale</p>
<p>from the point of view of grad school,</p>
<p>but I was also becoming kind of a famous,</p>
<p>you know, or semi-famous writer.</p>
<p>Cause my first book had been a New York Times bestseller.</p>
<p>And I just, I was, you know,</p>
<p>so I was getting some notoriety as a writer.</p>
<p>And so I was doing things like, you know,</p>
<p>I was giving a TED talk,</p>
<p>but I still hadn&rsquo;t finished graduate school, right?</p>
<p>So like, it was just, it was,</p>
<p>I think that timing&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Maybe I had just finished graduate school</p>
<p>when I gave the TED talk, but anyway,</p>
<p>so I was rowing in two boats and one boat was sinking</p>
<p>or, you know, showing every sign of being damaged.</p>
<p>And I was literally like, you know,</p>
<p>getting letters from the head of the department saying,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re concerned about you.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I was like becoming a, you know,</p>
<p>a quasi celebrity in that world too,</p>
<p>you know, at least in a world that was overlapping.</p>
<p>So I was having the experience of like going in,</p>
<p>I mean, the moment where this crystallized with,</p>
<p>for me in a, in a fairly peculiar way was</p>
<p>I had a meeting at like three o&rsquo;clock with my advisor,</p>
<p>who was just this guy, Mark Cohen</p>
<p>and the Brain Mapping Center at UCLA is a fantastic guy.</p>
<p>Great advisor, I did not extract as much wisdom from him</p>
<p>as I should have, brilliant scientist.</p>
<p>And, you know, he&rsquo;s, for him, I&rsquo;m late, right?</p>
<p>At least in my head, like he,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that he was riding me so hard,</p>
<p>but like in my head, I&rsquo;m very self-conscious</p>
<p>about how I&rsquo;m not living up to his expectations</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>So I have a meeting with him at like three o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just kind of wilting, you know, under my, you know,</p>
<p>his gaze and my own imagined, you know, inner gaze of his,</p>
<p>you know, but that two hours later,</p>
<p>I have a meeting with his boss, you know,</p>
<p>a dinner meeting with his boss who wants to meet with me</p>
<p>to get advice on launching his book.</p>
<p>We have the same publisher,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m like the much bigger author at, you know,</p>
<p>at Norton, you know, and he&rsquo;s coming to me for advice.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m ricocheting between two diametrically opposite</p>
<p>self-states that are, again,</p>
<p>this comes down to architecture.</p>
<p>It was literally like the state I was in</p>
<p>walking into one building and then leaving</p>
<p>and walking into another building on the same campus.</p>
<p>And they were completely opposite self-concepts.</p>
<p>Like in one context, I&rsquo;m a fuck up.</p>
<p>In another context, I&rsquo;m a celebrity who&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>And you have mastery and virtuosity</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re developing it very quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah, and, but so again,</p>
<p>this is a kind of a stark version of that,</p>
<p>but everyone has some version of this</p>
<p>just in bouncing between talking to their mom</p>
<p>and then talking to their best friend</p>
<p>and then talking to a stranger</p>
<p>and talking to someone who&rsquo;s very successful,</p>
<p>talking to someone who&rsquo;s not very successful.</p>
<p>Like all, you notice your vulnerability</p>
<p>to all of this stuff.</p>
<p>And ultimately what you want is</p>
<p>a level of psychological integrity</p>
<p>that is truly divorceable from that.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying you&rsquo;re ever going to get it perfect.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be some,</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t talk about the ultimate fulfillment</p>
<p>of this process.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not a Buddha.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;ve finished the project,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s more and more,</p>
<p>as you become sensitive to these changes</p>
<p>and you become sensitive to what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to actually not be psychologically reactive</p>
<p>and not be definable by your own self-concept,</p>
<p>your own idea.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not identifying with anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not hanging your hat on anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not thinking about yourself in terms,</p>
<p>in the kind of terms that you would export to others</p>
<p>and then care about what they think about you, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a kind of invulnerability</p>
<p>that arises that&rsquo;s not born of being well-defended.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s born of being evaporated, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re no longer keeping score in those ways.</p>
<p>Once again, we&rsquo;re at the,</p>
<p>I really appreciate that description</p>
<p>because these days I&rsquo;m really intrigued</p>
<p>by something we&rsquo;ve known for a long time</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re certainly familiar with</p>
<p>is the prefrontal cortex&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to establish context-dependent rule sets.</p>
<p>Stroop task would be a basic example</p>
<p>of reading numbers or letters on cards</p>
<p>and then switching to having to report the colors</p>
<p>that the letters and numbers are written in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a basic task,</p>
<p>but prefrontal cortex is obviously important</p>
<p>for setting context-dependent thought and behavior</p>
<p>and directed action.</p>
<p>But within the context of all these different variations</p>
<p>of the self, depending on graduate school</p>
<p>or relationship or sitting alone in one&rsquo;s room,</p>
<p>yeah, there are different rule sets arise,</p>
<p>and somehow we are able to have a sense,</p>
<p>a coherent sense of self that encompasses all of those.</p>
<p>Functional people can toggle between them as needed</p>
<p>and not overlap them inappropriately,</p>
<p>at least not to the extent that it&rsquo;s career failing</p>
<p>or life failing.</p>
<p>Although there are sad examples of that,</p>
<p>many of which exist in the Twitter space.</p>
<p>I know several colleagues, not directly of mine,</p>
<p>but people who through mistakes made with their thumbs</p>
<p>where they forgot context or forgot to realize</p>
<p>that the context on social media is near infinite,</p>
<p>but the context that it existed in their head</p>
<p>might not be clear in the way that they communicated</p>
<p>something and they lost their jobs</p>
<p>by saying what were perceived as insensitive things</p>
<p>in some cases were in fact offensive, insensitive things.</p>
<p>In some cases it&rsquo;s debatable, right?</p>
<p>In any case, I think that the image that now comes to mind</p>
<p>relates to something you&rsquo;ve said several times</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not about eliminating something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about revealing that something</p>
<p>was never actually there.</p>
<p>And then in terms of sensory experience</p>
<p>and these different aspects of the self,</p>
<p>I had this image in my mind of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an experienced scuba diver,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve done enough of it, worn a wetsuit.</p>
<p>You wear a complete wetsuit with the hood.</p>
<p>And this idea, if you were born into that wetsuit,</p>
<p>you might think that, yeah, you nudge up</p>
<p>or lean up against a wall and you experience it one way.</p>
<p>But were you to shed that wetsuit,</p>
<p>you go, wow, there&rsquo;s this incredible landscape</p>
<p>of somatosensory experience that I had no idea.</p>
<p>That goes way beyond levels of sensitivity, right?</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re talking about fine two-point discrimination</p>
<p>and light strokes, and this could be positive or negative,</p>
<p>pain in other ways too.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re describing is essentially</p>
<p>that the wetsuit was never really there,</p>
<p>but was created through a series of action steps.</p>
<p>And I think what we&rsquo;re migrating towards here</p>
<p>is a set of foremost non-intuitive</p>
<p>or non-reflexive action steps that reveal to us</p>
<p>that in fact, we&rsquo;re not wearing this wetsuit.</p>
<p>Now you raised one topic,</p>
<p>which I think is analogous to this wetsuit,</p>
<p>which is this notion of distraction.</p>
<p>That normally distraction is masking</p>
<p>what would otherwise be a better experience of life.</p>
<p>I can think of distraction</p>
<p>as falling into two different bins.</p>
<p>One would be the kind of distraction</p>
<p>that is internally generated,</p>
<p>like the fact that thoughts arise</p>
<p>and pull me down different alleyways and avenues</p>
<p>of my brain and my thoughts and my experience.</p>
<p>And then the other would be,</p>
<p>and that would compete with my ability</p>
<p>to really focus on something.</p>
<p>And then another form of distraction,</p>
<p>which captures my ability to focus intensely,</p>
<p>but has me focusing on the wrong things.</p>
<p>And here, I think the judgment of wrong</p>
<p>is reasonable to include.</p>
<p>If for instance, I&rsquo;m being impulsively yanked</p>
<p>to something on social media,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being impulsively yanked</p>
<p>to someone else&rsquo;s pain and experience,</p>
<p>and somehow confusing that with my own experience.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t empathy, but just being yanked around,</p>
<p>my attention as a spotlight is kind of like</p>
<p>over here, over there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not feeling as if I&rsquo;m the one</p>
<p>standing behind that spotlight controlling,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not the spotlight,</p>
<p>just to keep with what we&rsquo;ve been building up here.</p>
<p>So could you tell us a little bit about distraction</p>
<p>and tell me whether or not these two forms</p>
<p>are in any way accurate or inaccurate?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy for them to be inaccurate.</p>
<p>And whether or not there are other forms of distraction</p>
<p>that we need to be on the lookout for.</p>
<p>And again, I think what most people are seeking</p>
<p>is what is the way to not just enhance our ability to focus,</p>
<p>but to shed this wetsuit-like cloak</p>
<p>that limits our experience that I&rsquo;m calling</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ve called distraction.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get what this,</p>
<p>I mean, distraction is one component of it.</p>
<p>The other aspect of it is identification with thought</p>
<p>and the feeling of self is bound up in the sense</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m the thinker, I&rsquo;m the one attending,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one vulnerable,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the inner kind of the inner homunculus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s vulnerable to experience.</p>
<p>And I think it can be gratified by it or not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s constantly trying to improve it</p>
<p>or in mitigate negative aspects of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sense that there&rsquo;s kind of a rider</p>
<p>on the horse of consciousness</p>
<p>as opposed to just consciousness and its contents.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, again, it rides atop this illusion of control,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>So to go all the way back to the question you asked about,</p>
<p>what do I recommend as a starting point for meditation?</p>
<p>Some of your assumptions are in fact true.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I often recommend in the beginning people close their eyes</p>
<p>and you do a sitting practice</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s different from a walking practice.</p>
<p>I mean, you can do both,</p>
<p>but people tend to start, you know,</p>
<p>sitting with their eyes closed.</p>
<p>But again, ultimately where this is going is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an art of meditation properly recognized</p>
<p>is not an artifice that you&rsquo;re adding to your life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a practice.</p>
<p>It is less rather than more, you know,</p>
<p>and therefore it is also coincident with, you know,</p>
<p>potentially every waking moment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that you can do with your attention</p>
<p>once you know how to meditate</p>
<p>that in principle excludes meditation</p>
<p>because meditation is just a recognition</p>
<p>of an intrinsic character of consciousness</p>
<p>in each moment.</p>
<p>And all you have in each moment is consciousness</p>
<p>and its contents, whatever you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So in the beginning, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be very deliberate and precious</p>
<p>about deciding to practice meditation</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll set aside 10 minutes in the morning</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>And then, and it&rsquo;ll seem very different</p>
<p>from the next 10 minutes when you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>spilling out onto your to-do list</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to figure out, you know,</p>
<p>what the day looks like, right?</p>
<p>But ultimately you want to erase this boundary</p>
<p>between formal practice and the rest of life</p>
<p>such that it&rsquo;s just not remotely findable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s achievable.</p>
<p>And I think even from the very beginning,</p>
<p>you can relax this conceptual distinction</p>
<p>between meditation and its antithesis,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not at the level of anything you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at the level of what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in your relationship to thought.</p>
<p>You know, like what can you notice</p>
<p>when you know, it&rsquo;s the transition from,</p>
<p>you know, the bistable percept.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re looking at the image and you see nothing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say this, you know, the Dalmatian,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s just the spots on the paper</p>
<p>and you just, you don&rsquo;t see, you don&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden the Dalmatian</p>
<p>or the face of Jesus or whatever the image is,</p>
<p>pops out and then you see it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the transition from nothing to something, right?</p>
<p>That you, the practice becomes the transition</p>
<p>from being lost in thought and then waking up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very much like breaking the spell of thought</p>
<p>and identification with thought is very much like</p>
<p>waking up from a dream and having,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that transition, the whole,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re having a dream</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a couple of things are true there.</p>
<p>I mean, it really is a kind of, it&rsquo;s a psychosis</p>
<p>that is just not, we don&rsquo;t problematize</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re safely in bed and you&rsquo;re not moving</p>
<p>or unless you&rsquo;ve got some kind of sleep disorder,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not walking around harming yourself or anybody else.</p>
<p>So, but to be in bed and to not know it</p>
<p>and to think you&rsquo;re running along a beach</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re getting tried for murder in a court of law</p>
<p>or whatever the thing is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re completely delusional about, right?</p>
<p>That is psychosis, right?</p>
<p>And so like you&rsquo;re fundamentally unaware</p>
<p>of your circumstance.</p>
<p>And then you, the two things can happen there.</p>
<p>You can either become lucid within the dream, right?</p>
<p>Which is interesting.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a whole, there&rsquo;s a whole phenomenology of that</p>
<p>which can be practiced.</p>
<p>But more commonly, you can just wake up from the dream</p>
<p>and all of a sudden the problem you thought you had</p>
<p>is no longer there.</p>
<p>And you have a completely different context</p>
<p>for your conscious life.</p>
<p>Like now you know you&rsquo;re in bed,</p>
<p>you were safely in bed all the while.</p>
<p>There really is something analogous</p>
<p>when you break this identification with thought, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re having a thought</p>
<p>that seems to be some kind of, you know,</p>
<p>moral or psychological emergency.</p>
<p>And yet you can,</p>
<p>the moment you see daylight around it,</p>
<p>the moment you see that the mind is larger</p>
<p>than this mere appearance, right?</p>
<p>Then you have it, suddenly you have a degree of freedom</p>
<p>that a moment ago was just unthinkable, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also, you recognize,</p>
<p>you sort of come to in a way,</p>
<p>you recognize your circumstance in a way</p>
<p>that you weren&rsquo;t a moment ago</p>
<p>when you were just talking to yourself,</p>
<p>when you were just identical to that conversation.</p>
<p>So this is all to say that ultimately meditation,</p>
<p>I mean, so again, there&rsquo;s another apparent paradox here.</p>
<p>Many people don&rsquo;t know much about meditation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say things like, you know,</p>
<p>well, you know, for me, running is my meditation</p>
<p>or skiing or rock climbing or playing the guitar,</p>
<p>something they like to do</p>
<p>that gives them an experience of flow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they go to, to feel better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the opposite of all the chaos of their lives</p>
<p>or their time on Twitter or whatever it is.</p>
<p>In virtually every case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not true to say that that is effectively meditation.</p>
<p>By learning to play the guitar,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna learn what I&rsquo;m calling meditation.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not gonna learn it by, you know,</p>
<p>cycling or getting,</p>
<p>no matter how good you get at any of those things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna learn it by doing those things.</p>
<p>But paradoxically, I mean, not really,</p>
<p>but it can seem like a paradox,</p>
<p>once you know how to meditate,</p>
<p>then you can meditate doing all of those things, right?</p>
<p>Meditation is totally compatible with playing the guitar</p>
<p>or skiing or doing any ordinary thing you like to do, right?</p>
<p>So once you know how to meditate,</p>
<p>and again, it&rsquo;s totally natural in the beginning</p>
<p>to formalize it and to set aside time each day to do it,</p>
<p>because it is a training.</p>
<p>I mean, it is something that in the beginning</p>
<p>you have to get used to,</p>
<p>but once you&rsquo;re getting used to it,</p>
<p>then there is no good reason not to be experiencing</p>
<p>this thing I&rsquo;m calling meditation,</p>
<p>this insight into the centerlessness of consciousness,</p>
<p>the non-selfhood of consciousness.</p>
<p>You should experience it</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re playing your favorite sport</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re having a conversation with somebody.</p>
<p>And then to come back to your initial assumption</p>
<p>about eyes closed, a lot of practice,</p>
<p>even formal practice can be done eyes open,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important to do it eyes open,</p>
<p>because so much of our anchoring of our sense of self</p>
<p>is based on visual cues.</p>
<p>I mean, we know that if you give people</p>
<p>the right visual cues,</p>
<p>you can translocate their sense of self.</p>
<p>You can give them an out-of-body experience</p>
<p>with a video display,</p>
<p>where you can literally make them feel</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a body swapping illusion.</p>
<p>You can make them feel that they&rsquo;re in another person&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>looking back at their body</p>
<p>if you run the cameras the right way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this in VR,</p>
<p>seeing an image of they create an avatar for you,</p>
<p>and then your bodily movements</p>
<p>generate the movements of the avatar,</p>
<p>and you start gaining presence,</p>
<p>as they call it in the VR lingo, very quickly.</p>
<p>And then pretty soon,</p>
<p>you lose sense of your own bodily representation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little eerie.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s eeriest to me is going back into,</p>
<p>of course, never left,</p>
<p>but back into your actual body</p>
<p>when the VR goggles pop off.</p>
<p>The world seems almost overwhelming,</p>
<p>the number of sensory stimuli</p>
<p>that are in like a laboratory room,</p>
<p>which is actually quite sparse.</p>
<p>So exactly what you described,</p>
<p>this translocation of notions of self</p>
<p>through visual experience.</p>
<p>But conversely, when you lose the sense of self,</p>
<p>the sense of self I&rsquo;m talking about,</p>
<p>it can be especially vivid and salient with eyes open,</p>
<p>because so many of your reference points to selfhood</p>
<p>are delivered visually, right?</p>
<p>Especially in a social situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m talking to you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking back at me, right?</p>
<p>The implication of your gaze</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m over here behind my face,</p>
<p>implicated by your gaze.</p>
<p>So the sense that you&rsquo;re looking at something</p>
<p>is the sense of self in that social context, right?</p>
<p>And so if your facial expression changes,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m saying something,</p>
<p>and if you kind of furrow your brow,</p>
<p>like, well, what the hell&rsquo;s here?</p>
<p>And I can read into that facial change,</p>
<p>some inner state of yours that is salient to me.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, we&rsquo;ve got this sort of dance</p>
<p>of like, I&rsquo;m noticing you reacting to me,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s changing the way I&rsquo;m feeling about what I&rsquo;m&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the purview of every neurosis</p>
<p>everyone didn&rsquo;t want, right?</p>
<p>And every relationship.</p>
<p>I had a girlfriend when I was a postdoc</p>
<p>who was very, very&hellip;</p>
<p>She was brilliant, really, still is.</p>
<p>And she always said that every relationship&hellip;</p>
<p>There are four arrows, she used to say.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a neuroscientist, still is.</p>
<p>And said, there&rsquo;s the arrow of&hellip;</p>
<p>She was talking to me.</p>
<p>So she said, me to you,</p>
<p>and kind of what you perceive coming from me,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s you to me,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s an arrow from the middle</p>
<p>going right back at each one of us,</p>
<p>which is our own perception</p>
<p>of what the other person is thinking about us,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s feeding back on the other arrow.</p>
<p>And she gave me this very clear,</p>
<p>but model of basically relationships.</p>
<p>The relationship failed,</p>
<p>but it was good while it lasted, I should say.</p>
<p>And, but the four arrow model of relationships</p>
<p>actually shows up in every type</p>
<p>of one-on-one relationship,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably an under-description</p>
<p>of the total number of arrows.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>is that perception of self through the eyes of other,</p>
<p>whether or not we&rsquo;re empathic or not,</p>
<p>strongly shapes the way that we access</p>
<p>different context-dependent rule sets</p>
<p>about what we&rsquo;re going to say and not going to say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very dynamic, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, but the freedom that I think we want,</p>
<p>and people can sometimes experience this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just haphazardly,</p>
<p>but the thing that the center of the bullseye</p>
<p>from the meditative point of view</p>
<p>is to get off that ride entirely.</p>
<p>And to, so that losing the sense of self</p>
<p>in this context of a social encounter</p>
<p>is to give up your face, essentially.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re like, so, and what that entails is,</p>
<p>or what that gives you is the free attention</p>
<p>to actually just pay attention to the other person, right?</p>
<p>And the other person is now no longer quite an object</p>
<p>in the world for you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really just a kind of a totality</p>
<p>of which that person is a part.</p>
<p>And actually, you know, Martin Buber,</p>
<p>the kind of mystical Jewish philosopher,</p>
<p>talked about the kind of the I-Thou relationship.</p>
<p>And this, I think it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve read Buber,</p>
<p>but, and I don&rsquo;t know if he goes, you know,</p>
<p>far enough to be truly non-dualistic,</p>
<p>but this distinction between I and thou,</p>
<p>the kind of the thou part of it is,</p>
<p>I think, potentially this,</p>
<p>or again, it&rsquo;s been several decades since I read him.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a way of beholding another person</p>
<p>where you have the free attention</p>
<p>to simply behold them, right?</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re no longer,</p>
<p>you no longer care what they think about you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t feel neurotically implicated by their gaze.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t feel, you&rsquo;re simply the space</p>
<p>in which they&rsquo;re appearing, right?</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re free.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s no, and people can feel,</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;re, by definition,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re no longer self-conscious, right?</p>
<p>And when, and this phrase, self-consciousness</p>
<p>really does get at this, what I&rsquo;m calling the self,</p>
<p>the illusory self as a kind of contraction.</p>
<p>And you can notice this for yourself.</p>
<p>Just imagine what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to go from not being self-conscious</p>
<p>to suddenly being self-conscious.</p>
<p>And the proximate cause of this, you know,</p>
<p>almost invariably is suddenly recognizing</p>
<p>that somebody&rsquo;s looking at you, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re in a Starbucks and you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re alone and you&rsquo;re reading the newspaper</p>
<p>or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And this is, it now sounds highly anachronistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been three years since I&rsquo;ve held a physical newspaper</p>
<p>in a Starbucks, but you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just minding your own business and you look up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re seeing, you know,</p>
<p>a room full of strangers,</p>
<p>but then you notice that someone is just looking at you,</p>
<p>you know, and so like that moment of eye contact, right?</p>
<p>Suddenly that throws you back on yourself</p>
<p>as a kind of, suddenly you&rsquo;re the object in the world</p>
<p>for that other person.</p>
<p>That recognition is a, the tightening there,</p>
<p>the kind of contraction there is a further ramification</p>
<p>of this feeling most of us have most of the time</p>
<p>of being the center of experience.</p>
<p>Like the place you feel like, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all walking around with a fist</p>
<p>and in moments of self-consciousness,</p>
<p>the fist gets really tight, you know?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing that gets fully relaxed</p>
<p>when you discover this, what I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>at various points called the nature of mind</p>
<p>or the non-dual nature of consciousness</p>
<p>is just that there is no center to this experience.</p>
<p>And when you recognize no center,</p>
<p>then even when your gaze is aimed at another person&rsquo;s gaze,</p>
<p>there is no implication going back to the center</p>
<p>because there is no center, right?</p>
<p>And rather than that being an experience</p>
<p>of weird detachment or confusion,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s actually an experience of greater relationship</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re no longer, you no longer defend it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not defending anything over here.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not braced against anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just the space in which that person is showing up.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s an experience of being much more comfortable</p>
<p>in the presence of another person,</p>
<p>whatever your relationship,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not contracting, right?</p>
<p>And then when you do, when you have that, again,</p>
<p>and this is meditation, right?</p>
<p>This is a meditation that is totally compatible</p>
<p>with having a conversation with somebody.</p>
<p>And then when you notice yourself contracting,</p>
<p>like when you notice you&rsquo;re not doing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not meditating anymore,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re actually reacting.</p>
<p>Like they just said something or looked a certain way.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re cast back upon yourself</p>
<p>in relationship to them.</p>
<p>That becomes a kind of mindfulness alarm, right?</p>
<p>Then, you know, that, it becomes like the,</p>
<p>the unsatisfactoriness of that psychologically</p>
<p>becomes more and more salient, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, because that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>one, that&rsquo;s not the way you wanna be.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the antithesis</p>
<p>of being as comfortable as you were a moment ago,</p>
<p>but two, it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re doing unnecessarily, right?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re like, again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making a fist when you don&rsquo;t have to make a fist,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, again, you can leave aside</p>
<p>all those circumstances where it&rsquo;s appropriate</p>
<p>to react to someone.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m into martial arts and self-defense</p>
<p>and yes, you&rsquo;re not supposed to be just</p>
<p>this puddle of goo out in the world</p>
<p>who can be just mistreated by people</p>
<p>and, you know, never put up, you know, resistance,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s psychologically, you know,</p>
<p>even if a state like anger or contraction</p>
<p>is sometimes normative and appropriate,</p>
<p>the question is how long is it normative</p>
<p>and appropriate for?</p>
<p>Like, how long do you wanna stay angry for?</p>
<p>In my experience, these kind of classically</p>
<p>negative emotions like anger and fear</p>
<p>are appropriate as salience cues.</p>
<p>You know, they orient you to, you know,</p>
<p>an emergency or a potential emergency,</p>
<p>but then in dealing with the emergency,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re almost never the state you wanna be in.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s better to actually be calm in an emergency,</p>
<p>you know, so.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>I think that, and again, the language is insufficient</p>
<p>to describe what you&rsquo;re telling us,</p>
<p>but I think what comes to mind for me</p>
<p>is this distinction between situational awareness</p>
<p>and self-awareness, and we need both,</p>
<p>but under conditions of emergency, true emergency,</p>
<p>or motivated desire,</p>
<p>we need to dial down the amount of self-awareness</p>
<p>in order to be more effective</p>
<p>within the situational awareness.</p>
<p>But you said something very important,</p>
<p>my lab has been working on fear-like states for a long time,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna, I confess I&rsquo;m gonna rob this from you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll credit you every time I describe it,</p>
<p>is that the fear or the threat detection state</p>
<p>or set of events acts as a flag,</p>
<p>but is not meant to persist in the way</p>
<p>that the flag went up.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If one is to be in their most adaptive state.</p>
<p>Actually, Jocko Willink and I were talking about this.</p>
<p>He talks a lot about detachment and open gaze,</p>
<p>things that my lab is interested in,</p>
<p>visual system and autonomic interaction,</p>
<p>so why broadening the gaze literally</p>
<p>broadens the time domain of thinking,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve come up with new solutions</p>
<p>to complex problems in real time, and so on,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re describing an everyday set of interactions</p>
<p>where that could be very useful,</p>
<p>and yet there seems to be something</p>
<p>about the way you describe meditation</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;ve managed to arrive at</p>
<p>and what practitioners of meditation can arrive at,</p>
<p>which is something more than that.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not just about being effective</p>
<p>or optimizing all the language we see thrown around a lot</p>
<p>in the space that I live in these days,</p>
<p>but something fundamentally more important</p>
<p>about how to experience life and the self,</p>
<p>this realization that what you thought was there</p>
<p>was never really there,</p>
<p>but that there are constraints that limit that,</p>
<p>and so to try and fracture those constraints one by one,</p>
<p>would you say that meditation as a practice</p>
<p>done for a few minutes each day or with the app,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a kind of a step function,</p>
<p>is it very nonlinear in terms of people&rsquo;s progress?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly going to go start doing more meditation</p>
<p>based on this discussion, truly,</p>
<p>because anytime someone describes</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s kind of a myth that we&rsquo;ve been living in,</p>
<p>I become obsessed with the idea of dissolving that myth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very seductive phrase,</p>
<p>so thank you for using that one.</p>
<p>There is no better marketing tool,</p>
<p>which is, I realize what you&rsquo;re not trying to do here,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s, for me to capture my efforts,</p>
<p>you tell me that there&rsquo;s a myth that I&rsquo;m living in</p>
<p>and that it can be dissolved</p>
<p>and that opens up a better landscape.</p>
<p>What is the process like?</p>
<p>Do some people make progress very quickly?</p>
<p>Do some people experience kind of step functions</p>
<p>towards progress?</p>
<p>What does the meditation practice look like over time?</p>
<p>Do you still meditate or have you just threaded it</p>
<p>through your jujitsu, your writing, your daily life,</p>
<p>your coffee, your time with your wife, et cetera?</p>
<p>Yeah, so just to come back,</p>
<p>just to talk about the myth for a second.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re really, what you just enunciated</p>
<p>was a kind of a second doorway into this whole project.</p>
<p>So the usual door is through the door of suffering,</p>
<p>for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>I mean, people feel unhappy in a variety of ways</p>
<p>and they get more sensitized to the mechanics</p>
<p>of their own unhappiness.</p>
<p>And meditation is one of the things on the menu</p>
<p>that is explicitly billed as a remedy for unhappiness.</p>
<p>And it is, and that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably the most common path to this.</p>
<p>But another path is just intellectual interest.</p>
<p>I mean, just wanting to know what&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>about the mind subjectively, in a first person way.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no contradiction between those two things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m motivated by both of them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a totally valid doorway into this.</p>
<p>There are definitely step functions.</p>
<p>I mean, I would say there are at least two.</p>
<p>I mean, and they really are articulated along the lines</p>
<p>of the framework I&rsquo;ve been describing</p>
<p>of dualistic and non-dualistic mindfulness, right?</p>
<p>So in the beginning, you&rsquo;re gonna start out,</p>
<p>99.9% of people will start out</p>
<p>dualistically paying attention</p>
<p>and noticing the difference</p>
<p>between being distracted by thought</p>
<p>and then being on the object of attention,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the breath or sounds or whatever.</p>
<p>And eventually that opens up</p>
<p>to all possible objects of attention, including thoughts.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still this fluctuation</p>
<p>between being distracted</p>
<p>and then being mindful of whatever.</p>
<p>And the fact that it&rsquo;s open to all possible objects</p>
<p>differentiates this type of practice</p>
<p>from anything that is narrowly focused on one object,</p>
<p>like a mantra or a visualization or society.</p>
<p>Those are other paths of practice</p>
<p>that are more concentration-based and interesting.</p>
<p>But the benefit of mindfulness is that very quickly,</p>
<p>you realize it&rsquo;s by definition compatible</p>
<p>with all possible experience</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not artificially contracting your attention</p>
<p>down to something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just being aware of the next thing,</p>
<p>a sight, a sound, a taste, a thought.</p>
<p>So the first step function</p>
<p>is to very clearly experience the difference</p>
<p>between being lost in thought</p>
<p>and being clearly aware of any part of experience,</p>
<p>including thought,</p>
<p>and to notice the freedom,</p>
<p>the comparative psychological freedom that gives you, right?</p>
<p>So you can, like, something&rsquo;s made you angry</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re thinking about all the reasons</p>
<p>why you should be angry and have every right to be angry</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re gonna tell that person when you see them.</p>
<p>And then you notice you&rsquo;re thinking, right?</p>
<p>And you notice the connection</p>
<p>between the thought and the anger, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, the minute spent lost in thought</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s making you angry</p>
<p>is the thing that dragged through</p>
<p>the physiology of anger, right?</p>
<p>And the moment you notice that once you&rsquo;re mindful,</p>
<p>once you can be mindful,</p>
<p>you can notice thought as thought</p>
<p>and how quickly that dissipates,</p>
<p>that just the language and the imagery,</p>
<p>just you couldn&rsquo;t hold onto it if you wanted to.</p>
<p>And then you notice the physiology of the anger</p>
<p>is just this kind of meaningless,</p>
<p>you know, kind of inner incandescence</p>
<p>that has its own half-life and degrades very, very quickly</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re no longer thinking about the reasons</p>
<p>why you should be angry.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t hold onto the anger.</p>
<p>The anger itself dissipates, right?</p>
<p>And from the point of view of the one who&rsquo;s being mindful,</p>
<p>this is tremendous relief.</p>
<p>I mean, and at minimum, it&rsquo;s a degree of freedom.</p>
<p>You can, at that point, decide,</p>
<p>well, how long do I wanna be angry for, right?</p>
<p>Is it useful to stay angry?</p>
<p>Do I wanna be angry for one minute, two minutes,</p>
<p>five minutes, 10 minutes?</p>
<p>Or, and before you have that capacity to be mindful,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna helplessly be as angry as you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>for as long as you&rsquo;re gonna be that way,</p>
<p>just based on the kind of the time course</p>
<p>of your thinking about it, brooding about it,</p>
<p>telling your wife about it.</p>
<p>You know, like just the, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just gonna be this conversation-based misadventure</p>
<p>in, you know, negative states of mind.</p>
<p>And you are going to be the hostage of that</p>
<p>for as long as you&rsquo;ll be the hostage of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have nothing you can do apart from just deciding</p>
<p>to, you know, check out and watch Game of Thrones again</p>
<p>for the third time, right?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s just, you can divert your attention</p>
<p>to something else, which is, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes a good thing to do.</p>
<p>But mindfulness, even dualistic mindfulness</p>
<p>gives you this capacity to just observe</p>
<p>the mechanics of this and then get off the ride</p>
<p>when you, whenever you want.</p>
<p>So that really is a step function.</p>
<p>Like, first there was a time when,</p>
<p>there was a time before you could do that,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a time after which you can do that.</p>
<p>The other step function is noticing</p>
<p>that there is no one who is doing that.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the non-duality, the selflessness,</p>
<p>the centrallessness of awareness, right?</p>
<p>The fact that there&rsquo;s no place from which</p>
<p>the mindfulness is being aimed,</p>
<p>but the fact that there&rsquo;s just this open condition</p>
<p>in which everything is appearing, you know,</p>
<p>thoughts included.</p>
<p>To have you as, at that point,</p>
<p>your mindfulness no longer becomes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no longer this dualistic effort</p>
<p>to strategically pay attention to anything</p>
<p>as opposed to being lost in thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s left when thoughts,</p>
<p>when the present recognized thought unravels,</p>
<p>even before it unravels, what&rsquo;s recognized is</p>
<p>you are simply identical to the condition</p>
<p>in which everything is appearing.</p>
<p>Again, this is not a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making a Deepak Chopra-like</p>
<p>metaphysical claim about the mind.</p>
<p>You know, this is not, I&rsquo;m not saying the mind</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t what the brain is doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that you&rsquo;re recognizing the consciousness</p>
<p>that gave birth to the universe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making any broad claims about metaphysics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just talking about as a matter of experience,</p>
<p>there is just this condition</p>
<p>in which everything is appearing, right?</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re calling your body,</p>
<p>again, as a matter of experience,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that we can&rsquo;t have third-person conversations</p>
<p>about physical bodies in a physical world,</p>
<p>but as a matter of experience,</p>
<p>the only body you&rsquo;re ever going to directly encounter</p>
<p>as your own is an appearance in consciousness, right?</p>
<p>So consciousness is not in your body.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re calling your body is in consciousness.</p>
<p>Visually, proprioceptively,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like everything is just appearing in this condition.</p>
<p>And again, you&rsquo;re not aiming,</p>
<p>this is not a spotlight that you&rsquo;re aiming at the body</p>
<p>or at, you know, there&rsquo;s just this condition</p>
<p>in which everything,</p>
<p>including anything you could call yourself is appearing.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, so that&rsquo;s the second step function</p>
<p>is to recognize that this is already true.</p>
<p>Consciousness is already without this thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been calling your ego,</p>
<p>hoping to unravel it through meditation.</p>
<p>Consciousness is not going to get any more selfless,</p>
<p>any more centerless,</p>
<p>any freer than it always already is recognized as such.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the step function at that point</p>
<p>is your mindfulness at that point,</p>
<p>the thing you come back to when you&rsquo;re no longer distracted</p>
<p>is that recognition again and again.</p>
<p>And then it becomes, yeah,</p>
<p>it becomes compatible with anything you would do.</p>
<p>And so to answer your question, yes,</p>
<p>I still practice, you know, formally, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes, you know, frequently, but not, you know,</p>
<p>I definitely miss days and I don&rsquo;t do it for,</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I don&rsquo;t rule out the possibility</p>
<p>that I will go back on retreat at various times</p>
<p>just to check in with that</p>
<p>and see if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>But, you know, I tend to sit for,</p>
<p>I mean, I tend to, I&rsquo;ve designed my life</p>
<p>so that I can spend a lot of time meditating</p>
<p>without having to be formally meditating.</p>
<p>Like, so, you know, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go for a hike for two hours, right?</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m doing when I&rsquo;m hiking is identical</p>
<p>to what I&rsquo;m doing when I&rsquo;m quote meditating,</p>
<p>you know, sitting in a chair, you know,</p>
<p>doing nothing but meditate.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, yeah, I mean, I just, again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in erasing the boundary</p>
<p>between what people are calling meditation</p>
<p>and the rest of life.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, in teaching these things,</p>
<p>I tend to emphasize that from the beginning</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s very easy to set up,</p>
<p>to get gulled by a bunch of assumptions</p>
<p>that cause you to be very split in your sense</p>
<p>of what your life is about.</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;m sort of banking my meditation over here</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m meditating two hours a day diligently</p>
<p>and this is gonna be really good for me.</p>
<p>And then over here is the rest of my life,</p>
<p>which is not nearly as wise or as useful</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s like, this is the stuff</p>
<p>that is still the area of my problems.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s useful to recognize you&rsquo;ve got one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got one life, you know,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got this single condition of consciousness</p>
<p>and its contents in every mode of life.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something to recognize about it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re always free to recognize that,</p>
<p>truly even in your dreams, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just not, it never stops.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I tend to emphasize.</p>
<p>So earlier you told us that meditation is not</p>
<p>about changing the content of conscious experience.</p>
<p>And in a different podcast that you were on,</p>
<p>I heard you say something to the effect of</p>
<p>that normally we are in our daily experience</p>
<p>and unless we are trained in meditation,</p>
<p>unless we&rsquo;ve dissolved this illusion of the gap</p>
<p>between actor and self and observer,</p>
<p>that we require certain sensory events</p>
<p>to create collisions within us</p>
<p>and with the natural world that sort of, you know,</p>
<p>blast us into a different mode of being.</p>
<p>I want to use that as a way to frame up this idea</p>
<p>that some things such as psychedelics,</p>
<p>but also a very long hike, a very long fast,</p>
<p>you know, who knows, a banquet, you know,</p>
<p>different types of life experiences</p>
<p>do exactly the opposite</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re describing meditation does,</p>
<p>which is that they actively change the content</p>
<p>of our conscious experience.</p>
<p>So much so that we often remember those</p>
<p>for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Could you tell us why psychedelics can be useful</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;ll give the caveats</p>
<p>that maybe you&rsquo;ll feel obligated to give as well,</p>
<p>but this we&rsquo;re talking about use safely and responsibly,</p>
<p>age appropriate, context appropriate,</p>
<p>ideally with some clinical or other type of guidance,</p>
<p>legality issues obeyed, et cetera.</p>
<p>All that stated, psychedelics to me are an experience</p>
<p>of altered perception, internal and external perception,</p>
<p>altered space-time relationship, somewhat dreamlike.</p>
<p>I think it was Alan Hobson at Harvard</p>
<p>for a long time talking about the relationship</p>
<p>between psychedelic-like states and dreamlike states</p>
<p>because of this distortion of space-time dimensionality.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t experimented with them much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been part of a clinical trial, three doses of MDMA,</p>
<p>which certainly altered the quality</p>
<p>of my conscious experience in ways that led</p>
<p>to a lot of lasting and at least for me, valuable learning.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts about psychedelics</p>
<p>in terms of how they intersect with the discussion</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been having and what utility do they play</p>
<p>in recognition of the self</p>
<p>or in other sorts of brain changes?</p>
<p>Well, so yeah, let&rsquo;s just price in all those caveats</p>
<p>that people can anticipate.</p>
<p>These drugs are not without their risks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one problem is that we have this single term drugs</p>
<p>or psychedelics, which names many different types</p>
<p>of substances and they&rsquo;re not all the same.</p>
<p>And so like MDMA is not even technically a psychedelic.</p>
<p>I think it has an immense therapeutic value.</p>
<p>And it actually was my gateway drug</p>
<p>to this whole area of concern.</p>
<p>Amphetamine pathogen, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of an amphetamine and a pathogen at the same time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s often called-</p>
<p>M pathogen, excuse me.</p>
<p>Yeah, an amphetogen.</p>
<p>Not pathogen, M pathogen, yeah.</p>
<p>An amphetogen or an antactogen it&rsquo;s been called,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t tend to change perception</p>
<p>in the way that classic psychedelics do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also serotonergic,</p>
<p>but it has to be in some part differently.</p>
<p>So then even LSD and psilocybin,</p>
<p>which are much more similar in classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>both are also serotonergic, but they&rsquo;re not merely so.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also different.</p>
<p>And the higher dose you take of these drugs,</p>
<p>the more you at lower doses,</p>
<p>everything can kind of seem the same.</p>
<p>At higher doses, they begin to diverge.</p>
<p>And we can talk about the pharmacology if you wanted to,</p>
<p>but I would just say that for many of us,</p>
<p>I mean, certainly for me,</p>
<p>psychedelics were indispensable in the beginning</p>
<p>in proving to me that this was,</p>
<p>that a first person interrogation of the mind</p>
<p>was worth doing.</p>
<p>Because I was somebody who at age 17 or 18</p>
<p>before I had any real experience with MDMA</p>
<p>or LSD or psilocybin.</p>
<p>If you had taught me how to meditate at that point,</p>
<p>I think I would have just bounced off the whole project.</p>
<p>I think my mind was, I was just,</p>
<p>I was so cerebral in my,</p>
<p>just my engagement with anything.</p>
<p>I was so skeptical of any of the spiritual,</p>
<p>the religious and spiritual traditions</p>
<p>that have given us most of our meditation talk,</p>
<p>that I think I just would have,</p>
<p>and I know many of these people,</p>
<p>like I have tried to teach,</p>
<p>Richard Dawkins to meditate and Daniel Dennett to meditate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ambushed them with meditation</p>
<p>both in a group setting and one-on-one,</p>
<p>not Dan, but Richard,</p>
<p>I ambushed on my own podcast with a guided meditation.</p>
<p>And he just,</p>
<p>from his, he closes his eyes, he looks inside</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing of interest to see, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t have the conceptual interest in him</p>
<p>that would cause him to persist long enough</p>
<p>to find out that there&rsquo;s a there there, right?</p>
<p>Now, this is not a problem with LSD or psilocybin or MDMA.</p>
<p>I know that if I gave him a hundred micrograms of LSD</p>
<p>or five grams of mushrooms,</p>
<p>or 20, 25 milligrams of psilocybin,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably not the analogous dosage</p>
<p>to the five grams of mushrooms.</p>
<p>Five grams of mushrooms would be more than that.</p>
<p>I forget what it is of MDMA, maybe 120 milligrams.</p>
<p>I think the MAPS dose is,</p>
<p>which is the one that&rsquo;s under clinical trials</p>
<p>is 125 milligrams with an option</p>
<p>of a 75 milligram booster.</p>
<p>Funny, I don&rsquo;t remember that.</p>
<p>The facts that come to hand,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just no possibility</p>
<p>that nothing&rsquo;s gonna happen right now.</p>
<p>Something with a psychedelic,</p>
<p>with MDMA, most people tend to have,</p>
<p>certainly under any kind of guidance,</p>
<p>tend to have a very positive pro-social experience.</p>
<p>But with a psychedelic,</p>
<p>you might have a somewhat terrifying experience</p>
<p>if you have, we&rsquo;ll quote, a bad trip.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve certainly had those experiences on LSD</p>
<p>and to some degree on psilocybin.</p>
<p>But the prospect that nothing is gonna happen</p>
<p>is just in a million,</p>
<p>nearly a million cases out of a million,</p>
<p>just not in the cards.</p>
<p>I mean, just neurophysiologically,</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s gonna happen with the requisite dose</p>
<p>of one of these drugs.</p>
<p>And if that thing that happens</p>
<p>is psychologically at all normative</p>
<p>and pleasant and interesting and valuable,</p>
<p>which it is so much of the time,</p>
<p>and certainly under the appropriate set and setting</p>
<p>and guidance, it can be a lot of the time</p>
<p>for virtually everybody.</p>
<p>Again, there are caveats.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re prone, if you think you have a proclivity</p>
<p>for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>this is almost certainly not for you.</p>
<p>And anyone doing the studies like Johns Hopkins</p>
<p>for the therapeutic effects of any of these drugs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ruling out people with first degree relatives</p>
<p>with any of these clinical conditions.</p>
<p>But so for somebody like me at 18</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t know that this was an area</p>
<p>of not only interest, but would it be</p>
<p>the center of gravity for the rest of his life</p>
<p>if only he could pay attention clearly enough</p>
<p>to see that it could be, right?</p>
<p>I was someone who very likely, again,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t have the counterfactual in hand.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened</p>
<p>if someone had forced me to meditate</p>
<p>for an hour at that point.</p>
<p>But I know I wasn&rsquo;t interested in it until I took MDMA.</p>
<p>I know I wasn&rsquo;t having these kinds</p>
<p>of experiences spontaneously that showed me</p>
<p>that there was an inner landscape that was worth exploring.</p>
<p>I was a very hardheaded skeptic</p>
<p>who was very interested in lots of things,</p>
<p>but there was no alternative to me</p>
<p>just thinking more about those things, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the idea that there&rsquo;s some other way</p>
<p>of grasping cognitively at the interesting parts</p>
<p>of the world beyond thinking about the world, right?</p>
<p>I just, that just wouldn&rsquo;t have computed for me at all.</p>
<p>And if you had, so I just, and I literally,</p>
<p>no one ever gave me a book to read or,</p>
<p>the noun meditation very likely</p>
<p>meant absolutely nothing to me</p>
<p>before I took my first dose of, in this case, it was MDMA.</p>
<p>So what the drug experience did for me is it just proved,</p>
<p>I mean, so one of the limitations of a drug</p>
<p>is that obviously no matter how good the experience,</p>
<p>the drug wears off and then you&rsquo;re back</p>
<p>to more or less your usual form.</p>
<p>And now you have a memory of the experience</p>
<p>and it can be a fairly dim memory.</p>
<p>I mean, some of these experiences are so discontinuous</p>
<p>with normal waking consciousness</p>
<p>that it can be like trying to remember a dream,</p>
<p>you know, that just disappeared,</p>
<p>that it degrades, you know, over the course of seconds.</p>
<p>And then it could have been the most intense dream</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>And for whatever reason, you can barely get a purchase</p>
<p>on, you know, what it was about.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s some psychedelic experiences</p>
<p>that are analogous to that, but for most people,</p>
<p>most of the time, there&rsquo;s a residue of this experience.</p>
<p>And with something like MDMA, they can be quite vivid</p>
<p>where you recognize, okay, there was a way of being</p>
<p>that is quite different than what I&rsquo;m tending to access</p>
<p>by default.</p>
<p>And it is different in ways that are just, you know,</p>
<p>obviously better and psychologically more healthy.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s possible to be healthy psychologically</p>
<p>in a way that I never imagined, right?</p>
<p>And then when you link it up</p>
<p>to the traditional literature around any of this stuff,</p>
<p>again, so much of it is shot through with superstition</p>
<p>and other worldliness of religion.</p>
<p>And, you know, as you know,</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;re probably aware of this,</p>
<p>no, and I think your listeners probably know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time criticizing all that,</p>
<p>but there is a baby in the bathwater to all of that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not that somebody like Jesus or the Buddha</p>
<p>or any of the matriarchs and patriarchs</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s religions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that they were all conscious frauds</p>
<p>or, you know, temporal lobe epileptics,</p>
<p>or like there&rsquo;s a pathological lens</p>
<p>that you can put on top of all that,</p>
<p>but once you have one of these experiences on psychedelics</p>
<p>or on a drug like MDMA,</p>
<p>you know that there&rsquo;s a there there,</p>
<p>you know that unconditional love is a possibility, right?</p>
<p>You know that feeling truly one with nature, right?</p>
<p>I mean, just so one with nature</p>
<p>that you could spend 10 hours in front of a tree</p>
<p>and find that to be the most rewarding experience</p>
<p>of your life, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a possible state of consciousness.</p>
<p>Now, it may not be the state of consciousness</p>
<p>you want all the time, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna be the crazy guy by the tree,</p>
<p>you know, who can&rsquo;t have a conversation about anything else,</p>
<p>but once you have one of these experiences,</p>
<p>you recognize, okay, there&rsquo;s some reason</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m not having the beatific vision right now,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t even figure out how to aim my attention</p>
<p>so as to have anything like it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a problem, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s available, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the best, you know,</p>
<p>it is among the best things that has ever happened to me,</p>
<p>right, and now I can just only dimly remember</p>
<p>what that was like.</p>
<p>So how do I get back there on some level?</p>
<p>And that seems, so that invites, again,</p>
<p>a logic of changes, a logic of seeking changes</p>
<p>in the contents of consciousness,</p>
<p>which sets someone up for this</p>
<p>protracted or seemingly protracted</p>
<p>and fairly frustrating search to game their nervous system</p>
<p>so as to have those kinds of experiences more and more.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s not that that&rsquo;s in principle fruitless,</p>
<p>but it is from the point of view</p>
<p>of the kind of the core insight of the core wisdom</p>
<p>of what I would take from a tradition like Buddhism,</p>
<p>which is not, you know, it&rsquo;s not the only tradition</p>
<p>that has given voice to this,</p>
<p>but I would argue has given voice to it</p>
<p>in the most articulate way.</p>
<p>Again, leaving aside any of the superstition</p>
<p>and other worldliness and miracles</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have to talk about at the moment.</p>
<p>And you certainly don&rsquo;t need to endorse</p>
<p>in order to be interested in this stuff.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the bifurcation</p>
<p>between all of the utility of psychedelics</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>under the rubric of meditation is at this point of,</p>
<p>okay, once you realize there&rsquo;s a there there,</p>
<p>what do you do?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the logic by which you&rsquo;re led to do it?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible, like if your only framework</p>
<p>is the good experiences,</p>
<p>the good feels you had on whatever drug it was,</p>
<p>and a further discussion of like what that path of changes</p>
<p>you know, can look like,</p>
<p>and that can become in a religious context,</p>
<p>it can come in just a purely psychedelic context</p>
<p>or, you know, some combination of the two.</p>
<p>I think you can be misled to,</p>
<p>you can just be, you can be misled</p>
<p>to just seek lots of peak experiences.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just trying to string together</p>
<p>a lot of peak experiences,</p>
<p>hoping they&rsquo;re gonna change you.</p>
<p>Every one of which by definition</p>
<p>is going to be impermanent, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s first it wasn&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s there, and then it&rsquo;s no longer there.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got a memory of it, right?</p>
<p>The quest, what I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>what everyone really wants,</p>
<p>whether they know it or not,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re right to want,</p>
<p>is a type of freedom that is compatible</p>
<p>with even ordinary states of consciousness,</p>
<p>which can ride along with them</p>
<p>into extraordinary states of consciousness.</p>
<p>I mean, so what I hadn&rsquo;t done psychedelics for 25 years,</p>
<p>because I mean, again,</p>
<p>they were super useful for me in the beginning.</p>
<p>Then I discovered meditation</p>
<p>on the basis of those experiences,</p>
<p>got really into meditation and realized,</p>
<p>okay, this is a much more,</p>
<p>this really is, you know,</p>
<p>conceptually, this makes much more sense to me.</p>
<p>This is delivering the goods, you know,</p>
<p>in terms of my experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to keep having these, you know,</p>
<p>seeking these peak experiences with drugs.</p>
<p>But it had been, you know, 25 years since I had done that.</p>
<p>And there was this resurgence in research on psychedelics.</p>
<p>And I was being asked about psychedelics</p>
<p>and I was talking about their utility for me.</p>
<p>But again, these were distant memories.</p>
<p>And so I, and there was also one type</p>
<p>of psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>I was aware that I had never had,</p>
<p>I had never done a high dose of mushrooms blindfolded,</p>
<p>you know, like every mushroom trip I&rsquo;d ever had,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been out in nature and interacting with, you know,</p>
<p>you know, it was just been a very transformed</p>
<p>sensory experience of the world and of other people.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d never done it alone, blindfolded,</p>
<p>just purely, you know, inwardly directed</p>
<p>and at a high dosage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d done high doses of LSD, but not mushrooms.</p>
<p>So I did that, you know, and it was very useful.</p>
<p>And I spoke about it on my podcast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually, there&rsquo;s, I think if you search</p>
<p>Sam Harris mushroom trip on YouTube,</p>
<p>you get the 19 minute version of that,</p>
<p>my describing that trip.</p>
<p>It was incredibly useful.</p>
<p>And, but what was doubly useful was my mindfulness training</p>
<p>in the context of that explosion of synesthesia.</p>
<p>I mean, it was such an overwhelmingly strong experience.</p>
<p>And there were so many moments where it could have gone</p>
<p>one way or the other based on my sense of just, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to resist this.</p>
<p>You know, it was like, it was, it was, it was in truth,</p>
<p>irresistible because it was just so much,</p>
<p>but there were moments where I was aware of, okay,</p>
<p>this is like letting go of self, you know,</p>
<p>in this context is, is the thing that is going to,</p>
<p>you know, make the difference between heaven and hell here.</p>
<p>You know, and cause there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there are experiences that are so extreme</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t even tell if it&rsquo;s agony or ecstasy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>everything has turned up to 11, right.</p>
<p>And it, and the difference between the two is like,</p>
<p>you know, the tipping point is just, it&rsquo;s on,</p>
<p>it really is kind of a high wire act in some sense,</p>
<p>you know, you can just fall to one side or the other.</p>
<p>And yeah, so what I think people want is they certainly</p>
<p>want to be able to extract from the psychedelic experience,</p>
<p>wisdom that is applicable to ordinary states</p>
<p>of consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what is the thing you can realize in a moment</p>
<p>of having a conversation with your child that isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>distracting you from that relationship?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a memory of when the world dissolved or, you know,</p>
<p>when you were indistinguishable from the sky,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a way of a way of having free attention</p>
<p>and unconditional love in this, you know,</p>
<p>totally ordinary and potentially chaotic human experience,</p>
<p>you know, which can be psychologically fraught</p>
<p>and you can meet, you know,</p>
<p>iterations of yourself that you don&rsquo;t like that are,</p>
<p>that are not equipping you to be the best possible person</p>
<p>in that relationship.</p>
<p>And what we want to do is cut through all of that</p>
<p>and actually, you know, be in love with our lives</p>
<p>and with the people in our lives more and more of the time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s the psych,</p>
<p>you know, that repeated psychedelic journeys aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be integral to that project,</p>
<p>but you know that it can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that the project can&rsquo;t be being high all the time, right?</p>
<p>So whatever is extractable from the occasional,</p>
<p>you know, psychedelic trip has got to be mappable</p>
<p>into ordinary waking consciousness.</p>
<p>And the point of, the real point of contact</p>
<p>does kind of run through this, you know,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve been calling the illusion of the self.</p>
<p>And again, it is, that part is discoverable</p>
<p>without any changes in contents, right?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to suddenly feel the energy of your body,</p>
<p>be rush out and be continuous with the, you know,</p>
<p>the ocean of energy that is not your body, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s an experience that&rsquo;s there to be had, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no doubt, but this,</p>
<p>the truth is just looking at this cup</p>
<p>is just as formless and as mysterious as that, right?</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s seen in the right way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what, you know,</p>
<p>meditation encourages to, you know, one to recognize.</p>
<p>Well, I share the experience that MDMA</p>
<p>significantly altered my perception of what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>in terms of an emotional stance towards self and others,</p>
<p>including animals, right?</p>
<p>Something that runs very deep for me</p>
<p>and that I had been kind of actively suppressing</p>
<p>in anticipation of having to put my dog down,</p>
<p>but also, you know, I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to frame it except to say, you know,</p>
<p>my lab did animal research for years</p>
<p>and I was always very conflicted about it</p>
<p>because I love animals</p>
<p>and yet I wanted to understand the brain</p>
<p>and we need to work on animal brains.</p>
<p>Rodents or what?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll be very direct about this.</p>
<p>My laboratory, I&rsquo;ve worked on many species.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on mice and rats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on, admittedly, I&rsquo;ve worked on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d done some cat experiments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on large non-human primates, including macaques.</p>
<p>I no longer work on any of those species.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on cuttlefish, cephalopods,</p>
<p>a discussion for another time,</p>
<p>brilliant little creatures,</p>
<p>maybe as smart as us or who knows, maybe smarter.</p>
<p>And now I work on humans</p>
<p>because I couldn&rsquo;t reconcile the challenge inside me,</p>
<p>which was my love of animals and working on them.</p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t do it any longer.</p>
<p>And MDMA didn&rsquo;t set that transition.</p>
<p>That transition actually had been set a lot earlier</p>
<p>and it was something I really grappled with.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t keep me up at night,</p>
<p>but it was always in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>In any event, I hope what we discovered was worthwhile,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a bigger debate.</p>
<p>And I have strong feelings about this</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s a topic for another podcast,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very happy that now I work on humans</p>
<p>and they can tell me</p>
<p>if they want to be part of the experiment or not.</p>
<p>And I trust them and I trust their answers.</p>
<p>I think that MDMA in its role as an empathogen,</p>
<p>I think really did set an understanding</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s real and true.</p>
<p>So I think truths like that become,</p>
<p>I felt that they didn&rsquo;t hit me square in the face.</p>
<p>I just could, the feeling behind the conflict</p>
<p>made itself evident</p>
<p>and what to do about it made itself evident.</p>
<p>So I suppose MDMA did assist the transition</p>
<p>to purely human research as opposed to animal research.</p>
<p>The other thing that I noticed it did is</p>
<p>it made it not scary to confront things</p>
<p>that were scary to confront in my conscious life.</p>
<p>And I could think about things in my conscious life,</p>
<p>but it brought them close in a way</p>
<p>that I could get closer and closer to the flame</p>
<p>and then gain some understanding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still amazed at how answers arrive</p>
<p>both during the session</p>
<p>and then the weeks and months that follow.</p>
<p>If one puts the attention to it,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to have a guide</p>
<p>of some sort or to have some pseudo structure</p>
<p>because otherwise you can,</p>
<p>one can get attached to the sounds in the room</p>
<p>and just, and there&rsquo;s probably meaning there,</p>
<p>but I wanted to do some deeper work.</p>
<p>I have not had experience with psilocybin</p>
<p>at least not since my youth</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t recommend young people do it.</p>
<p>I regret doing LSD and psilocybin as a young person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that for politically correct reasons</p>
<p>or liability reasons.</p>
<p>I just think my mind was not developed.</p>
<p>And, but I&rsquo;m intrigued by something.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>How is it that psilocybin in particular</p>
<p>and high dose psilocybin and the ego dissolution</p>
<p>that people talk about on psilocybin,</p>
<p>how do you think that lines up with some of the experiences</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been describing</p>
<p>for a adequate meditation practice?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s something that I did not experience on MDMA.</p>
<p>In fact, if anything, I experienced for the first time</p>
<p>what really feeling like a isolated container was</p>
<p>and the difference in how empathy and being bounded,</p>
<p>having in other words,</p>
<p>good boundaries and empathy could be symbiotic.</p>
<p>I experienced that for the first time there.</p>
<p>And I do think that there is learning inside of these states</p>
<p>that translates into everyday life</p>
<p>when one is not on these states.</p>
<p>And the last thing I&rsquo;ll say is,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t feel the impulse to go</p>
<p>and do 20 more MDMA sessions.</p>
<p>I think that the three is part of this study</p>
<p>were very effective for me.</p>
<p>And, you know, as they say,</p>
<p>if you hear the calling again, you might do it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m very curious about psilocybin in particular</p>
<p>and this notion of ego dissolution</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve been talking about the self.</p>
<p>Well, so there are different ways</p>
<p>in which the sense of self can be eroded or expanded</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s lots of experiences</p>
<p>that can still have a kind of center to them,</p>
<p>but be very novel and transformational.</p>
<p>And one can reify those as a kind of goal state, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of, there&rsquo;s a concept in Buddhism</p>
<p>that I think is useful.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t translate well to English</p>
<p>or it can set up kind of false associations in English</p>
<p>that are unfortunate.</p>
<p>But so there&rsquo;s a concept of emptiness in Buddhism,</p>
<p>which sounds again, kind of gray and dispiriting in English,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, what it&rsquo;s sort of cognate terms</p>
<p>are things like unconditioned,</p>
<p>unconstrained, open, centerless, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a, and that is,</p>
<p>so when I&rsquo;m talking about non-duality,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m talking about the loss of a sense of subject</p>
<p>and then what&rsquo;s left,</p>
<p>in Buddhism they would often describe</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s left as emptiness,</p>
<p>but emptiness is not a something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a, and it&rsquo;s importantly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the same thing as unity, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a oneness, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s left,</p>
<p>and that when the center drops out of experience,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like you are suddenly merged with the cup, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, but now granted, you know,</p>
<p>this is where psilocybin and other psychedelics</p>
<p>can give a false impression of, I think, what the goal is.</p>
<p>You can have kind of seeming merging experience.</p>
<p>You can have unity experiences on psychedelics,</p>
<p>which can be quite powerful,</p>
<p>especially with nature, with other people and with nature,</p>
<p>where you can just feel like the energy of your body</p>
<p>becomes incredibly vivid and powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like you&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>everything is just buzzing with life energy,</p>
<p>and then when you touch another person&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>or you touch a tree,</p>
<p>there can be this sort of continuity of energy,</p>
<p>which can be this overwhelming experience of,</p>
<p>and again, this is just a 20 megaton change</p>
<p>in the contents of consciousness, right?</p>
<p>This is a non-ordinary state of consciousness,</p>
<p>but this gives some indication of how this happens.</p>
<p>Back in the day when I was in my 20s</p>
<p>and I was experimenting with, this was LSD,</p>
<p>but some friends and I had decided,</p>
<p>we had this brilliant idea,</p>
<p>we would camp above mere woods</p>
<p>and then take some LSD at dawn</p>
<p>and then walk down, like a mile, I think,</p>
<p>from the campsite into the actual proper grove of trees</p>
<p>and commune with the giant redwoods,</p>
<p>the tallest trees on earth.</p>
<p>And so we dropped the acid at dawn and we start walking,</p>
<p>but the acid came on almost immediately.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t get, I mean, we got nowhere near the woods</p>
<p>and we got stopped by a tree</p>
<p>that was just like an ordinary 20-foot oak tree,</p>
<p>like the most boring tree in the world.</p>
<p>And that tree absorbed like the next six hours</p>
<p>of our conscious attention,</p>
<p>because it was just, you know, it was the tree of life.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just, there could be no better tree.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about non-ordinary states of consciousness</p>
<p>wherein a merging with life and with the world is possible.</p>
<p>And that is a, so I&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>that kind of experience isn&rsquo;t possible,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a sort of expanded self-reification</p>
<p>it is a kind of ego dissolution,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a kind of egoity</p>
<p>that sort of goes along for the ride as well,</p>
<p>or can go along for the ride.</p>
<p>And the real insight into emptiness,</p>
<p>the real sort of centerless, you know, center of the bullseye</p>
<p>is a recognition that in some ways equalizes all experiences.</p>
<p>I mean, again, it&rsquo;s just as available now</p>
<p>in this ordinary, you know, podcasting experience</p>
<p>as it is when you&rsquo;re merging hands-on with an oak tree</p>
<p>and, you know, on, you know, 400 micrograms of acid.</p>
<p>And this is, you know, this is the whole universe.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s the equality of those two experiences</p>
<p>that this concept of emptiness captures,</p>
<p>which a concept of oneness doesn&rsquo;t quite capture,</p>
<p>because oneness is really this peak experience</p>
<p>of being dragged out of your, you know,</p>
<p>your somethingness into a much bigger somethingness, right?</p>
<p>Emptiness is just no center, right?</p>
<p>And then everything is in its own place, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still sights and sounds and sensations</p>
<p>and thoughts and feelings,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s no center</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no clinging to anything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no clinging to identity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no clinging to the good stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no resistance to the bad stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, this is so pleasant and unpleasant,</p>
<p>gets sort of strangely equalized.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this very, it&rsquo;s very expansive.</p>
<p>And most importantly, it doesn&rsquo;t block anything.</p>
<p>So yeah, if for whatever reason,</p>
<p>if your nervous system is set up to have the,</p>
<p>oh my God, I&rsquo;m now merging with the tree experience,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible from the state of no center, right?</p>
<p>And on my, you know, my recent,</p>
<p>I mean, now not so recent,</p>
<p>three years ago, it was right before COVID,</p>
<p>but my last, you know, big psychedelic experience,</p>
<p>you know, there was, I was very much experiencing that.</p>
<p>Whereas, you know, insofar as I, you know,</p>
<p>you know, at the peak,</p>
<p>there was no me to remember any of this stuff.</p>
<p>But, you know, insofar as I could experiment with,</p>
<p>is this really different from anything else?</p>
<p>You know, there is a kind of equalizing</p>
<p>to the emptiness recognition,</p>
<p>even in the presence</p>
<p>of a completely transformed neurophysiology.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, again, there&rsquo;s a point of contact.</p>
<p>I mean, the real point of contact</p>
<p>between psychedelics and meditation for me is,</p>
<p>but for my experiences on psychedelics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s just no way</p>
<p>I would have had the free attention</p>
<p>to be interested in the project at all.</p>
<p>And there are other aspects to the project.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just having this insight into selflessness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of the ethical ramifications of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, what kind of person do you want to be?</p>
<p>What are your values?</p>
<p>What is a good life altogether</p>
<p>when you are talking about relationships</p>
<p>and, you know, political engagement</p>
<p>and the changes you can make in the world or not make?</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>what kind of person do you want to be?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a much larger consideration.</p>
<p>And, I mean, as you discovered, you know,</p>
<p>an experience on MDMA can</p>
<p>really both expand your model of what is possible</p>
<p>and what is desirable, what is normative.</p>
<p>I mean, just what kind of, you know,</p>
<p>what kind of self do you want to be in the world?</p>
<p>And it can also help you cut through things</p>
<p>that are inhibiting your actualizing</p>
<p>any of those possibilities in ordinary waking consciousness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly found that to be the case.</p>
<p>I mean, you raise a really important point,</p>
<p>which is that once these learnings take place,</p>
<p>these understandings take place</p>
<p>inside of psychedelic journeys,</p>
<p>and I do believe they translate to neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>I do want to highlight the point for people.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people say, you know,</p>
<p>this mushroom or this psychedelic, it opens plasticity,</p>
<p>but of course, plasticity has to be directed someplace.</p>
<p>Plasticity is just a process like walking</p>
<p>or anything else underlying neural process.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s impossible for me to understand</p>
<p>what compartments of my life have been impacted</p>
<p>by these three MDMA sessions.</p>
<p>But I, in some ways, I wonder whether or not,</p>
<p>not just the transition away from animal research,</p>
<p>but also a deeper realization of the love</p>
<p>for learning and sharing information.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go so far as to say this podcast is happening</p>
<p>because of that particular session,</p>
<p>but these things, they splay out</p>
<p>into multiple domains of the self.</p>
<p>And I do think that the key features</p>
<p>that feel most important to me to mention</p>
<p>are that it really identified true loves,</p>
<p>things that I truly love and made me less cautious</p>
<p>about feeling how intense those loves really are.</p>
<p>And then also lower the inhibition point of exploring,</p>
<p>like, well, what would that mean, right?</p>
<p>You know, and one of the reasons I bring this up</p>
<p>and why I think it&rsquo;s so important that you mentioned,</p>
<p>you know, some issues around politics and ethics</p>
<p>and many things have splayed out from your exploration</p>
<p>of psychedelics, meditation, neuroscience, philosophy,</p>
<p>you know, all the things that are you.</p>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s only a subset,</p>
<p>is that so much of what I hear and see,</p>
<p>so much of what I hear and see</p>
<p>in the kind of self-help space</p>
<p>contradicts itself and leads back to the origin</p>
<p>without a lot of progress.</p>
<p>And for instance, we hear, you know,</p>
<p>absence makes the heart grow fonder,</p>
<p>but then out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p>You hear about radical acceptance,</p>
<p>but then what if it&rsquo;s radical acceptance of non-acceptance?</p>
<p>Right, I mean, there are some experiences in people</p>
<p>for which I radically accept the fact</p>
<p>that I want nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>Am I supposed to transcend that?</p>
<p>So these are the questions I think that keep a lot of people</p>
<p>from exploring things like meditation</p>
<p>because they feel like, well,</p>
<p>is the idea to just be okay with everything?</p>
<p>Is radical acceptance just like,</p>
<p>well, just, you know, bulldoze me with things,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>and my goal is to somehow surpass the idea</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re harmful.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s actually the way</p>
<p>any of this stuff is supposed to work,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t claim to be the authority on it either.</p>
<p>I, you know, I think notions of radical acceptance</p>
<p>and radical honesty and any number of different sayings</p>
<p>that one can find out there</p>
<p>are really the most salient beacons and guides</p>
<p>that most people have in order to try</p>
<p>and navigate tough areas in their life,</p>
<p>including the relationship to self,</p>
<p>but others and political orientations.</p>
<p>And so I feel like almost all those things</p>
<p>can be used to anchor down in a stance</p>
<p>that may or may not be informed or to open up to ideas.</p>
<p>And so I think that none of this can really be solved</p>
<p>in a single practice, it sounds like,</p>
<p>but it does seem to me,</p>
<p>based on what you&rsquo;ve told us today,</p>
<p>is that only through a deep understanding of the self</p>
<p>as it really is,</p>
<p>as opposed to this illusion that you framed up,</p>
<p>could we actually arrive at some answers</p>
<p>about like what&rsquo;s actually right</p>
<p>for each and every one of us?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s one generic answer</p>
<p>that I think can be extracted</p>
<p>both from psychedelics and from meditation,</p>
<p>and just from just thinking more clearly</p>
<p>about the nature of our lives.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s to become more process-oriented</p>
<p>and to be more and more sensitive</p>
<p>to the mirage-like character of achieving our goals.</p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m not against achieving goals,</p>
<p>I have a lot of goals, I&rsquo;m very busy,</p>
<p>there are lots of things I want to get done</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m as satisfied as anyone to finish a project.</p>
<p>But if you look at the time course</p>
<p>of all of that fulfillment,</p>
<p>and there are a few lessons everyone I think has to draw.</p>
<p>One is most of your life is spent in the process, right?</p>
<p>Like the moment at which the goal is fully conquered,</p>
<p>that is just, I mean, that has a tiny duration</p>
<p>and it has a very short half-life.</p>
<p>And the moment you arrive at it,</p>
<p>it begins to recede because in the meantime,</p>
<p>you have all these other goals</p>
<p>that have appeared on the horizon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got people asking what you&rsquo;re gonna do next.</p>
<p>And in some sense, if you&rsquo;re focused on goals,</p>
<p>you really can never arrive, right?</p>
<p>And I think what we&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all looking for in life,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re ever thinking about taking psychedelics</p>
<p>or practicing something like meditation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking for good enough reasons</p>
<p>to let our attention fully rest in the present, right?</p>
<p>Now, like, I mean, that is the logic of success.</p>
<p>Like the sense, like I&rsquo;ve got all these things I wanna do,</p>
<p>if I could just get rich enough or fit enough</p>
<p>or dial in my sleep well enough</p>
<p>or improve my life in all these ways,</p>
<p>get the right relationship,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to be married?</p>
<p>I wanna start a family.</p>
<p>I want all of these things.</p>
<p>Why do I want these things, right?</p>
<p>I want these things because I&rsquo;m telling myself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that all of those things are wonderful, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not discounting those relative forms of happiness</p>
<p>or sources of happiness</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all completely valid,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely valid to want those things.</p>
<p>But in the present, one thing is absolutely clear,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to be miserable</p>
<p>in the presence of all of those things, right?</p>
<p>And you can add great wealth and fame</p>
<p>and everything on top of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to be absolutely miserable</p>
<p>having everything anyone could seemingly want, right?</p>
<p>You just have to open a newspaper</p>
<p>to see people living out that predicament, right?</p>
<p>You know, spectacularly wealthy, famous,</p>
<p>healthy, successful people</p>
<p>who could do anything they want in life apparently,</p>
<p>and yet they&rsquo;re doing this thing</p>
<p>that is completely dysfunctional</p>
<p>and making them needlessly miserable.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t name names.</p>
<p>But some people come to mind at the moment.</p>
<p>So there is a clear dissociation</p>
<p>between having everything and happiness that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also possible to have very little, you know,</p>
<p>and almost nothing and to be quite happy.</p>
<p>I mean, you might not have met these people,</p>
<p>but you know, I have met people who have spent,</p>
<p>you know, 10 years alone in a cave, right?</p>
<p>You know, and they come out of that cave</p>
<p>not floridly neurotic or psychotic.</p>
<p>They come out of that cave beaming with compassion and joy.</p>
<p>And I mean, it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;ve been taking MDMA</p>
<p>for 10 years essentially, and they come out of the cave</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re gonna talk about it, right?</p>
<p>So, and I&rsquo;m not necessarily recommending</p>
<p>that project to anyone, but I&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>that is a psychological possibility.</p>
<p>So you have a double dissociation here,</p>
<p>whether you can have everything and be miserable,</p>
<p>you can have nothing and be beaming with happiness.</p>
<p>So what is it that we actually want</p>
<p>in all of our seeking to arrange the props in our lives</p>
<p>and the story to have a convincing enough story</p>
<p>to tell about ourselves that we&rsquo;re doing the right thing?</p>
<p>What is all of that effort predicated on?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s predicated on this desire and this expectation</p>
<p>that if we could get all of this stuff in the right place</p>
<p>and not have anything terrifying to worry about, right?</p>
<p>Everyone we love is healthy for the moment, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re healthy and we&rsquo;ve got something</p>
<p>to look forward to on the weekend.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not a plumbing leak in the house</p>
<p>that we have to immediately respond to.</p>
<p>And we like our house and our career is going fine.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something good to watch on Netflix</p>
<p>and we have all of it, right?</p>
<p>Now, can we just actually give up the war, right?</p>
<p>Can we fully locate our sense of wellbeing</p>
<p>in the present moment?</p>
<p>Is it, can we relax the impulse to brood about the past</p>
<p>or think anxiously about the future for long enough</p>
<p>to discover that all of this here is enough, right?</p>
<p>Because our life is, we have this finite resource of,</p>
<p>I mean, we absolutely have the finite resource of time,</p>
<p>but within this, the finite resource, the continuum of time</p>
<p>we have the even more precious resource of free attention</p>
<p>that can find our fulfillment in the present, right?</p>
<p>And because even if we&rsquo;re guarding our time</p>
<p>to do the things that are most important to us,</p>
<p>we can spend all of that time regretting the past</p>
<p>or anxiously expecting the future</p>
<p>and telling it to just bouncing between past and future</p>
<p>in our thinking about ourselves and our lives</p>
<p>and basically just dancing over the present</p>
<p>and never making contact with it, right?</p>
<p>So I think what we want is a circumstance</p>
<p>where attention can be located in the present</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s truly fulfilling.</p>
<p>And unless you have had some kind of radical insight</p>
<p>that allows you to do that on demand,</p>
<p>you are in some sense hostage</p>
<p>to the circumstances of your life to do that for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re constantly trying to engineer a state of the world</p>
<p>that will propagate back on a state of self</p>
<p>that will make the present moment good enough.</p>
<p>And what meditation does,</p>
<p>and psychedelics to some degree does this,</p>
<p>but meditation very directly does this,</p>
<p>it reverses the causality</p>
<p>and lets you actually change states</p>
<p>such that you can be fulfilled before anything happens,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Nothing, your happiness is no longer predicated</p>
<p>on the next good thing happening.</p>
<p>You can be in the presence of the next good or bad thing</p>
<p>already being fulfilled and already being at peace.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re misleading nouns.</p>
<p>We can throw it at what is left there,</p>
<p>but it is, you know, tranquility, peace, freedom,</p>
<p>lack of contraction, lack of conflict.</p>
<p>I mean, like all of that can be more and more of a default.</p>
<p>And all of that is also compatible with deciding,</p>
<p>you know, yeah, why not get in shape?</p>
<p>Why not engage this project?</p>
<p>Why not, you know, change your career?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not that you need to be somebody who accepts,</p>
<p>to your point, you can notice all of these</p>
<p>non-optimal things because no matter how much you meditate,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re very likely going to spend</p>
<p>a lot of your time still lost in thought,</p>
<p>still identified with it and still wanting,</p>
<p>still caring about the difference between dysfunction</p>
<p>and normativity in your life, right?</p>
<p>And the question is, what can you locate when,</p>
<p>the question, it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>how much can you puncture that seeking happiness project</p>
<p>with the recognition that you&rsquo;re already free, right?</p>
<p>That is, that&rsquo;s what meditation makes possible.</p>
<p>You can keep just a thousand times a day</p>
<p>letting some daylight into this search space.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, but it is still compatible.</p>
<p>Like you can, I mean, working out is a great</p>
<p>frame in which to look at this because,</p>
<p>I mean, in working out, when you really work out,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m thinking, you know, mostly,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s anything,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, you know, resistance training or cardio</p>
<p>or something like jujitsu.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re intentionally putting yourself</p>
<p>in classically unpleasant circumstances physiologically.</p>
<p>I mean, so if you, if you were, you know,</p>
<p>imagine what it&rsquo;s like to do anything to failure, right?</p>
<p>Well, if you just check in on what the,</p>
<p>on what that is like at the level of sensation,</p>
<p>I mean, that is, it&rsquo;s basically a medic,</p>
<p>it feels like a medical emergency, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like that, if you were having that experience</p>
<p>for some other reason, like if you woke up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night and felt what it feels like</p>
<p>to be deadlifting, you know, on your 10th rep on a set</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna, you know, you would fail at 11, right?</p>
<p>Like that is just, you know, that&rsquo;s an emergency,</p>
<p>but because you understand what you&rsquo;re doing in the gym</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve sought it out and like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually something you like doing, right?</p>
<p>And you can get a real dopamine, you know,</p>
<p>hit from doing it.</p>
<p>That, what you&rsquo;re doing when you&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re owning a kind of a,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re actually transforming</p>
<p>a classically negative experience</p>
<p>into something that&rsquo;s almost intrinsically positive, right?</p>
<p>Certainly the net on it is positive.</p>
<p>You can do that.</p>
<p>And being able to do that is more and more</p>
<p>the experience of being actually at peace,</p>
<p>even while exerting a really intense effort</p>
<p>in one direction.</p>
<p>So you can be straining and I&rsquo;m sure physiologically</p>
<p>showing a lot of stress.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure that, you know, cortisol is up</p>
<p>and like, you know, blood pressure&rsquo;s up,</p>
<p>heart rate is certainly up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, as far as the body is concerned,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s stress as far as the eye can see,</p>
<p>but you really can be deeply a quantumist and at peace</p>
<p>because again, because of the frame around it,</p>
<p>because of the concepts attached to it,</p>
<p>because you know what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you know why it&rsquo;s happening and you want it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an attitude you can bring</p>
<p>into other stressful things that take effort to accomplish.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not that you just need to be a pushover</p>
<p>when you learn how to meditate or when you take MDMA</p>
<p>or you work on yourself in any of these ways.</p>
<p>But what I think you want to find</p>
<p>is you want to find your point of rest</p>
<p>in the midst of any struggle.</p>
<p>I would say that the, certainly MDMA,</p>
<p>and again, I have less experience with meditation,</p>
<p>but they really, I think, put us ultimately in positions</p>
<p>of what can only refer to as real strength.</p>
<p>These can make what before seemed like impossible decisions</p>
<p>or even concepts or emotional states</p>
<p>to even think about for any period of time</p>
<p>without deliberately distracting</p>
<p>or avoiding in some other way</p>
<p>and be able to lean into those with open eyes.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, to me, that&rsquo;s my definition of strength.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what other people consider,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s definitely something real there in each case.</p>
<p>This may seem like a divergence,</p>
<p>but I and many other people are very curious</p>
<p>about a recent decision that you made,</p>
<p>which was to close your account on Twitter.</p>
<p>You still have an Instagram account, I noticed.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Although I never, I mean, my team manages that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot friendlier over at Instagram.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there a lot longer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never even seen it, so.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s pretty good, actually,</p>
<p>considering, imagine what would happen if you did deepfake.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing a good job with it.</p>
<p>But your decision to close your account on Twitter,</p>
<p>I think, grabbed a lot of eyes and ears,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of questions about why.</p>
<p>It was a very large account.</p>
<p>It correlated with a number of things</p>
<p>that for the outsider, people might be wondering</p>
<p>about new leadership, new people who had been booted off,</p>
<p>brought back on, or at least invited back on, and so on.</p>
<p>You are certainly not obligated to explain your behavior</p>
<p>to me or anybody else for that matter,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m curious if you might share with us</p>
<p>what the motivation was for taking the account down</p>
<p>and how you feel in the absence of,</p>
<p>I mean, your thumbs presumably are freed up</p>
<p>to do other things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was getting like an arthritic right thumb,</p>
<p>I think, and I think it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind sharing,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of curiosity</p>
<p>about you and your routines.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been very generous in sharing that, your knowledge,</p>
<p>but also kind of like what makes you tick,</p>
<p>what motivates pretty big decisions like that.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a major platform for you.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>It was the only social media platform I&rsquo;ve ever engaged.</p>
<p>I mean, like you said, I have an Instagram,</p>
<p>I have a Facebook account,</p>
<p>but I never used those as platforms, right?</p>
<p>I was never on them, I&rsquo;ve never followed people,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never, and all the posting has just come from,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just marketing from my team.</p>
<p>But Twitter was me, I mean, for better or worse,</p>
<p>and I began to feel more and more for worse.</p>
<p>And it was interesting because it was very,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about it a lot on my podcast</p>
<p>about just my love-hate relationship</p>
<p>with Twitter over the years.</p>
<p>Many good things came to me from Twitter,</p>
<p>and I was following a lot of smart people,</p>
<p>and it had become my newsfeed</p>
<p>and my first point of contact with information each day.</p>
<p>And I was really attached to it just for that reason,</p>
<p>just as a consumer of content.</p>
<p>And then it was also a place where I was,</p>
<p>I genuinely wanted to communicate with people</p>
<p>and react to things, and I would see some article</p>
<p>that I thought was great, and I would signal boost it</p>
<p>to the people following me on Twitter,</p>
<p>and that was rewarding,</p>
<p>and I could literally help people on Twitter.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, there were people</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ve raised lots of money for on Twitter</p>
<p>just by signal boosting their GoFundMes.</p>
<p>And so I was engaged in a way that seemed productive,</p>
<p>but I was always worried that it was</p>
<p>producing needless conflict for me</p>
<p>and was giving me a signal in my life</p>
<p>that I was being lured into responding to</p>
<p>and taken seriously that was out of proportion</p>
<p>to its representation of any opinion</p>
<p>or set of opinions that I should be taking seriously.</p>
<p>So I was noticing that, and again, this evolved over years.</p>
<p>I mean, this long before,</p>
<p>long predated recent changes to Twitter.</p>
<p>But I was noticing that many of the worst things</p>
<p>that had happened for me professionally</p>
<p>were first born on Twitter.</p>
<p>I mean, just like some conflict I got into with somebody</p>
<p>or something that I felt like I needed to podcast about</p>
<p>in response to on Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much of it, it&rsquo;s either it&rsquo;s Genesis was Twitter</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the further spin of it</p>
<p>that became truly unpleasant and dysfunctional</p>
<p>happened on Twitter.</p>
<p>Like it was just Twitter was part of the story</p>
<p>when it got really bad.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had, you know, vacations that have gone sideways</p>
<p>just because I got on Twitter and said something</p>
<p>and then I had to produce a controversy</p>
<p>that I had to respond to.</p>
<p>And then I had to do a podcast about that and blah.</p>
<p>And it was just, okay, this is a mess, right?</p>
<p>And so at that point, you know, I have friends</p>
<p>who also had big Twitter platforms who would say,</p>
<p>you know, why are you responding to anything on Twitter?</p>
<p>Just tweet and ghost.</p>
<p>You know, just due to having Joe Rogan sat me down</p>
<p>and tried to get me talking to Bill Maher.</p>
<p>And both of them engaged Twitter in that way.</p>
<p>I mean, I think they basically never look</p>
<p>at their at mentions.</p>
<p>They never see what&rsquo;s coming back at them.</p>
<p>They just, you know, they use it effectively</p>
<p>the way I use or don&rsquo;t even use Instagram or Facebook.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t even see what&rsquo;s going out there in my name.</p>
<p>And so I could essentially do that for myself</p>
<p>on Twitter, presumably.</p>
<p>And I did that for some periods of time</p>
<p>but then I would continually decide, okay,</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s all balanced again.</p>
<p>Maybe I can just communicate here.</p>
<p>Cause it was very tempting for me to communicate with people</p>
<p>because I would see somebody clearly misunderstanding</p>
<p>something I had said on my podcast.</p>
<p>And I think like, why not clarify this misunderstanding?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And my efforts to do that almost invariably produced a,</p>
<p>sometimes it was a kind of a meandering process of discovery</p>
<p>but often it was just kind of a stark confrontation</p>
<p>with what appeared to me to be just lunacy</p>
<p>and malevolence on a scale that I never encounter elsewhere</p>
<p>in my life.</p>
<p>Like I never meet these people in life, right?</p>
<p>And yet I was meeting these people</p>
<p>by the tens of thousands on Twitter.</p>
<p>And so the thing that began to worry me about it,</p>
<p>and again, this, I understand that people have</p>
<p>the opposite experience.</p>
<p>I mean, depending on what you&rsquo;re putting out</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re, you know, the kinds of topics</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re touching, you could have just nothing</p>
<p>but love coming back at you on Twitter, right?</p>
<p>But because I&rsquo;m very essentially in the center politically</p>
<p>and because I&rsquo;m on my, this is now on my podcast.</p>
<p>This is not in the waking up app.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often criticizing the far left</p>
<p>and criticizing the far right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically pissing off everyone some of the time, right?</p>
<p>So, and it&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re only criticizing the left,</p>
<p>you hate, no doubt you get hate from the left,</p>
<p>but you have all the people on the right</p>
<p>who just reflexively and tribally</p>
<p>are expressing their solidarity for you, right?</p>
<p>And who are dunking on your enemies for you.</p>
<p>And, you know, when your enemies come out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re only criticizing the right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you get a lot of pain from the right,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve got the people on the left</p>
<p>who are tribally identified with the left,</p>
<p>who are just going to reflexively defend you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the center criticizing the left</p>
<p>as hard as anyone on the right ever criticizes the left,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re also criticizing the right</p>
<p>as hard as anyone on the left criticizes the right,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting hate from both sides all the time.</p>
<p>And no one is reflexively and tribally defending you</p>
<p>because you pissed them off last time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, you might be getting hate from the left now</p>
<p>and the people on the right agree with you,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t forget the thing you said about Trump</p>
<p>on that podcast, you know, two podcasts ago.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not going to defend you.</p>
<p>And so what I, I basically created hell for myself</p>
<p>on Twitter because it was, I just, you know,</p>
<p>it was just a theater of,</p>
<p>it was just pure cacophony most of the time.</p>
<p>And what I was seeing was, I mean,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s no way there&rsquo;s this many psychopaths</p>
<p>in the world, but I was seeing psychopaths everywhere.</p>
<p>I was seeing like the most malicious dishonesty</p>
<p>and, you know, just goalposts moving and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>And, I mean, it was just, I mean, some of it&rsquo;s trolling</p>
<p>and some of it&rsquo;s real confusion</p>
<p>and some of it is psychopathy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, it was so dark that I worried</p>
<p>that he was actually giving me a very negative</p>
<p>and sticky view of humanity</p>
<p>that was, I mean, one, it was, you know,</p>
<p>I think it is an inaccurate,</p>
<p>but two, it was something I was returning to so much</p>
<p>because again, I was checking Twitter, you know,</p>
<p>at least a dozen times a day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there were some days</p>
<p>where I checked it a hundred times a day.</p>
<p>I mean, it was, again,</p>
<p>it was my main source of information.</p>
<p>I was constantly reading articles</p>
<p>and then putting my own stuff out.</p>
<p>That it became this kind of fun house mirror</p>
<p>in which I was looking at the most grotesque side</p>
<p>of humanity and feeling, you know,</p>
<p>implicated in ways that were important</p>
<p>because it was just, it was reputationally important</p>
<p>or seemed to be important.</p>
<p>I know a lot of these people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, these weren&rsquo;t just faceless trolls.</p>
<p>These are people with whom I have had relationships</p>
<p>and in some cases, friendships who,</p>
<p>because of what, you know, largely Trump and COVID did</p>
<p>to our political landscape in the last, you know,</p>
<p>half a dozen years,</p>
<p>were beginning to act in ways that seemed, you know,</p>
<p>starkly dishonest and, you know, crazy making to me.</p>
<p>So I was just noticing that I was forming a view</p>
<p>of people who I actually have had dinner with</p>
<p>that was way more negative based on their Twitter behavior</p>
<p>than I think would ever be justified</p>
<p>by any way they would behave in life with me.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I was never gonna have a face-to-face encounter</p>
<p>with any of these people that was this malicious</p>
<p>and dishonest and gaslighting and weird, right?</p>
<p>As was what was happening hourly on Twitter, right?</p>
<p>And so I just began to become more sensitive</p>
<p>to what this was, you know,</p>
<p>just the residue of all of this in my life</p>
<p>and just how often the worst thing about me</p>
<p>in my relationship with the people in my life,</p>
<p>you know, they just talking to my wife or my kids</p>
<p>was just the fact that I had been on Twitter</p>
<p>at some point previously in the previous hour</p>
<p>and there was some residue of that, you know,</p>
<p>in my interaction with them.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, what are you stressed out about?</p>
<p>What are you annoyed about?</p>
<p>What are you pissed off about?</p>
<p>You know, what can&rsquo;t you get out of your head?</p>
<p>What is the thing that you now feel like you need</p>
<p>to spend the next week of your life focused on?</p>
<p>Because it went so sideways for you.</p>
<p>All of that was Twitter, you know,</p>
<p>a little, I mean, literally a hundred percent</p>
<p>of that was Twitter.</p>
<p>And so I just, at one point it was actually</p>
<p>on Thanksgiving day, I just looked at this</p>
<p>and I just, I mean, there was very little thought</p>
<p>went into it.</p>
<p>I mean, literally, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>it was more thought involved in you, you know,</p>
<p>whether I wanted coffee when you asked me</p>
<p>when I showed up here.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just like at a certain point,</p>
<p>I just saw it and I just ripped the Band-Aid off</p>
<p>and yeah.</p>
<p>So, and to answer your other question,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been almost wholly positive as you might expect</p>
<p>given the litany of pain and discomfort I just ran through.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s also, it&rsquo;s surprising to recognize</p>
<p>how much of a presence it was in my life</p>
<p>given the sense of what is now missing.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s no question</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of an addictive component to it.</p>
<p>I mean, like when I look at what Elon&rsquo;s doing on Twitter,</p>
<p>forget about his ownership of it.</p>
<p>And I mean, I&rsquo;m not, you know, I&rsquo;ve got a lot to say</p>
<p>about the choices he&rsquo;s making for the platform,</p>
<p>but just his personal use of it</p>
<p>is just so obviously an expression of,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if addiction is the, you know,</p>
<p>clinically appropriate term, but, you know,</p>
<p>his dysfunctional attachment to tweet</p>
<p>to using the platform.</p>
<p>Forget it, again, forget about changing it and owning it,</p>
<p>but just the degree to which it is pointlessly disrupting</p>
<p>the life of one of the most productive people</p>
<p>in any generation.</p>
<p>That was also instructive to me</p>
<p>because I know Elon and I just, you know, he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>from, you know, kind of a friend&rsquo;s eye view of the situation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so obviously not good for him</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s spending this much time on Twitter.</p>
<p>That I just brought that back to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, if it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>if this is what it&rsquo;s doing to Elon</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got all these other things</p>
<p>he could be doing with his attention,</p>
<p>how much of my use of Twitter is actually, you know,</p>
<p>a good idea and, you know, optimized to my wellbeing</p>
<p>and the wellbeing of the people around me.</p>
<p>So anyway, it was,</p>
<p>there was an addictive component to it, I think.</p>
<p>And so when that got stripped off,</p>
<p>I, you know, I do notice that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some, there are times I pick up my phone</p>
<p>and I realized that this is like the old me</p>
<p>picking up my phone for a reason that no longer exists.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s not that much, you know, I, you know,</p>
<p>I have a Slack channel with my team</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve got email obviously,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, that is not much of what I was doing</p>
<p>with my phone really in the end.</p>
<p>And so like, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>my phone is much less of a presence in my life.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s almost wholly good,</p>
<p>but yeah, it&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think there is some danger in,</p>
<p>or some possible danger in losing touch</p>
<p>with certain aspects of culture, which again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure, I mean, there&rsquo;s this question of,</p>
<p>you know, how much is Twitter real life</p>
<p>and how much is it just a mass delusion?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but insofar as it actually matters</p>
<p>what happens on Twitter,</p>
<p>or insofar as I was actually getting a news diet,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not going to be able to recapitulate for myself,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m just not in fact going to recapitulate for myself,</p>
<p>even if I could,</p>
<p>if any of that matters, I haven&rsquo;t discovered that yet,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it was taking up an immense amount of bandwidth</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s impressive.</p>
<p>I mean, I think I said, I, you know,</p>
<p>it was like I amputated a phantom limb, right?</p>
<p>Like it was not a real limb,</p>
<p>but it was this continuous presence in my life</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It actually relates to the concept of self</p>
<p>in surprising ways, because I felt</p>
<p>there was a part of myself that existed on Twitter.</p>
<p>And I, you know, I just performed a suicide of that self,</p>
<p>rather like that&rsquo;s, this is ending right now.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s no residue.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing to go back and check.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t even, I didn&rsquo;t go back and look at my,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s interesting to consider is that, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been on Twitter for 12 years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t keep a journal.</p>
<p>I mean, Twitter, my timeline would have been</p>
<p>a kind of journal.</p>
<p>I could have gone back to a specific hour</p>
<p>and a specific day and looked at what I was</p>
<p>paying attention to.</p>
<p>I mean, that could have been an interesting record</p>
<p>of just who I&rsquo;ve been for a decade.</p>
<p>And probably a pretty humbling record</p>
<p>of who I&rsquo;ve been for a decade</p>
<p>in terms of the kinds of things</p>
<p>that captivated my attention.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t even, you know,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even think to go, you know,</p>
<p>nostalgically just look at any of that</p>
<p>or see if any of it was worth saving or archiving</p>
<p>or thinking, I just delete, you know,</p>
<p>and it was,</p>
<p>and so my actual sense of who I am</p>
<p>and my engagement with my audience,</p>
<p>my, you know, the world of people</p>
<p>who could potentially know me,</p>
<p>like what does it mean to be, to have a platform?</p>
<p>You know, where do I exist digitally?</p>
<p>My sense of all of that got truncated</p>
<p>in a way that</p>
<p>is much less noisy.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s amazing how much</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get fucked up now in my life.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like with Twitter,</p>
<p>almost anything could happen, right?</p>
<p>Like the next tweet was always an opportunity</p>
<p>to massively complicate my life.</p>
<p>There is no analogous space for me now.</p>
<p>And, you know, so what I&rsquo;m going to say on your podcast,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m going to say on my own podcast,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m going to write next,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more,</p>
<p>you know, deliberative</p>
<p>and the opportunities to take my foot out of my mouth</p>
<p>or to reconsider all, you know,</p>
<p>whether any of this is worth it.</p>
<p>Is it worth, is this the hill I really want to die on now?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more, can be much more considered.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think all of that&rsquo;s to the good,</p>
<p>but even more important than that is that there&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not getting this continuous signal</p>
<p>that is always inviting a response,</p>
<p>whether on Twitter or on my own podcast or, you know,</p>
<p>anywhere else.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just much less noisy.</p>
<p>I mean, life is much less noisy and cluttered.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, that is definitely feels better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a hundred percent better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to hear that.</p>
<p>I know a number of people miss you there,</p>
<p>but you sound happy.</p>
<p>I sense the genuine happiness in it.</p>
<p>Several things come to mind.</p>
<p>First of all, thank you for sharing your rationale there</p>
<p>and how it went.</p>
<p>I think for a lot of people, they think,</p>
<p>oh, you must&rsquo;ve like walked around in circles for hours</p>
<p>talking about it.</p>
<p>It was as many good decisions are executed, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a big fan of Cal Newport&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>In many ways, Cal&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve never met him,</p>
<p>but we know each other through the internet space.</p>
<p>Really ahead of his time with this notion of deep work</p>
<p>and limiting distractions.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s even got a book about a world without email</p>
<p>or something really extreme.</p>
<p>So he had, I mean, he deserves some credit</p>
<p>because he had been somewhat approximate cause to this.</p>
<p>He had been on my podcast and he had encouraged me</p>
<p>to delete Twitter because I had been,</p>
<p>I had been sort of in reaching some kind of crisis point</p>
<p>with it prior to that podcast.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve talked about it.</p>
<p>And I had recorded that podcast, but hadn&rsquo;t released.</p>
<p>I actually recorded the podcast the day before</p>
<p>I wound up deleting Twitter, but hadn&rsquo;t yet released it.</p>
<p>So in my podcast with him, in the intro to it,</p>
<p>I then give a post-mortem on my deleting it.</p>
<p>But he was one of the last people who was in my head</p>
<p>around these issues.</p>
<p>And I, you know, that was not by accident.</p>
<p>I had invited him on the podcast</p>
<p>because I increasingly wanted to think about, you know,</p>
<p>whether this was totally dysfunctional.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a big fan of Cal Newport&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and I am on social media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on Twitter.</p>
<p>I had some, you know, high friction interactions there.</p>
<p>And I have a process for dealing with those.</p>
<p>I tend to avoid high friction confrontations online,</p>
<p>but Instagram is a much friendlier place, by the way,</p>
<p>if you want to come over to where like the nice kids,</p>
<p>the cool kids actually hang out.</p>
<p>Strangely, I&rsquo;m not looking for a substitute.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I didn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t let me entice you</p>
<p>over there, you do.</p>
<p>But I think that this notion of really being able to access</p>
<p>what Cal calls deep work, what Rick Rubin talks about,</p>
<p>you know, being able to touch the source of creativity</p>
<p>and focus on a regular basis does require</p>
<p>that one have certain types of, and in some cases,</p>
<p>zero interaction with certain platforms</p>
<p>that merely being on a platform</p>
<p>and blocking people that would just won&rsquo;t provide.</p>
<p>I think a lot of energy opens up.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fascinated by this concept of energy.</p>
<p>I mean, we only have so much energy,</p>
<p>neural energy to devote.</p>
<p>And in many ways, what you described,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really, I think, striking parallels</p>
<p>to what I&rsquo;m talking about all along these last hours,</p>
<p>which is that sometimes the thing that feels so powerful</p>
<p>that has such a gravitational pull</p>
<p>and that we think this is experience, this is life,</p>
<p>this is just the way it is, actually is an illusion.</p>
<p>And when you step away from it,</p>
<p>you realize that there&rsquo;s this whole other dimension</p>
<p>of interactions that was available all along,</p>
<p>but that we, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re intervening in by way of our reflexive,</p>
<p>distracted behavior.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a poetry there.</p>
<p>I was a hard case, but yeah, I got religion on this point.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a good change.</p>
<p>Well, Sam, I want to say a couple of things.</p>
<p>First of all, every time you talk, I learn so much.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in the dimensions of neuroscience,</p>
<p>even hardcore neural circuitry type stuff,</p>
<p>which is sort of my home.</p>
<p>When you talk about philosophy or meditation or psychedelics</p>
<p>and even politics, a topic that I&rsquo;m woefully</p>
<p>undereducated in, but you have this amazing ability</p>
<p>to blend and synergize across things.</p>
<p>And I think today what occurs to me is that</p>
<p>not only is that no accident because of your training</p>
<p>and the rigor and the depth</p>
<p>at which you&rsquo;ve explored these different topics,</p>
<p>but also your openness to it.</p>
<p>But I think, at least for me above all,</p>
<p>is because I think you are able to encapsulate</p>
<p>this idea of the self and the different ways</p>
<p>in which we each and all can potentially interact</p>
<p>with the environment and our inner landscape.</p>
<p>Your description of meditation, I have to say,</p>
<p>now has forever changed the way I think about meditation.</p>
<p>I would no longer just think of it as a perceptual exercise.</p>
<p>On the podcast, I&rsquo;ve been talking about it</p>
<p>as something to do for these various benefits,</p>
<p>the benefit set of more focus, more stress, et cetera,</p>
<p>of which certainly exists.</p>
<p>But what you described today has such an allure</p>
<p>and holds such a promise that, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly going to change my behavior.</p>
<p>And I know I&rsquo;m speaking on behalf of many, many people.</p>
<p>And I just want to extend my thanks</p>
<p>for your coming here today to teach us even more,</p>
<p>because of course you have your podcast</p>
<p>and the app, the Waking Up app.</p>
<p>And the fact that regardless of the political landscapes,</p>
<p>regardless of what neuroscience feels about psychedelics</p>
<p>or where things are at any point in time,</p>
<p>you strike me as somebody who is very committed</p>
<p>to sharing knowledge and thoughtful, deep discourse</p>
<p>so that people can benefit.</p>
<p>And there are very few people like you.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s probably only just one.</p>
<p>And so I feel very grateful to be sitting</p>
<p>across the table from him for these last hours.</p>
<p>Oh, nice, nice.</p>
<p>Well, I really enjoyed this.</p>
<p>And I want to congratulate you on what you&rsquo;ve built here,</p>
<p>because your podcast is everywhere.</p>
<p>And I just, you know, I&rsquo;m a fan.</p>
<p>And even more than that, I&rsquo;m continually seeing the evidence</p>
<p>of you reaching people and benefiting people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s really, I mean, like,</p>
<p>this is the, one of the best examples of, you know,</p>
<p>new media just carving out a space</p>
<p>that people didn&rsquo;t really know existed, you know,</p>
<p>because like, this is not television, it&rsquo;s not radio,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden people have time to hear a conversation</p>
<p>of great length that goes into, you know,</p>
<p>nitty gritty scientific detail on, you know, hormones.</p>
<p>I mean, like who would have thought that was even possible?</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I mean, just congratulations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic to see, and I&rsquo;m just very happy</p>
<p>for the opportunity to talk to you and your people.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very gratifying to hear, and I feel very blessed</p>
<p>in no small part because of our conversation today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
