    <p>The following is a conversation with Harry Cliff,</p>
<p>a particle physicist at the University of Cambridge,</p>
<p>working on the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment</p>
<p>that specializes in investigating the slight differences</p>
<p>between matter and antimatter</p>
<p>by studying a type of particle called the beauty quark</p>
<p>or b quark.</p>
<p>In this way, he&rsquo;s part of the group of physicists</p>
<p>who are searching for the evidence of new particles</p>
<p>that can answer some of the biggest questions</p>
<p>in modern physics.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also an exceptional communicator of science</p>
<p>with some of the clearest and most captivating explanations</p>
<p>of basic concepts in particle physicists</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>So when I visited London, I knew I had to talk to him.</p>
<p>And we did this conversation</p>
<p>at the Royal Institute Lecture Theatre,</p>
<p>which has hosted lectures for over two centuries</p>
<p>from some of the greatest scientists</p>
<p>and science communicators in history,</p>
<p>from Michael Faraday to Carl Sagan.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded</p>
<p>before the outbreak of the pandemic.</p>
<p>For everyone feeling the medical and psychological</p>
<p>and financial burden of this crisis,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sending love your way.</p>
<p>Stay strong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll beat this thing.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of ads now</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the ads.</p>
<p>Two sponsors, ExpressVPN and Cash App.</p>
<p>Please consider supporting the podcast</p>
<p>by getting ExpressVPN at expressvpn.com slash lexpod</p>
<p>and downloading Cash App and using code lexpodcast.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code lexpodcast.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.</p>
<p>Since Cash App does fractional share trading,</p>
<p>let me mention that the order execution algorithm</p>
<p>that works behind the scenes</p>
<p>to create the abstraction of the fractional orders</p>
<p>is an algorithmic marvel.</p>
<p>So big props to the Cash App engineers</p>
<p>for solving a hard problem that in the end</p>
<p>provides an easy interface that takes a step up</p>
<p>to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,</p>
<p>making trading more accessible for new investors</p>
<p>and diversification much easier.</p>
<p>So again, you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play</p>
<p>and use the code lexpodcast, you get $10</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,</p>
<p>an organization that is helping advance robotics</p>
<p>and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>This show is sponsored by ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>Get it at expressvpn.com slash lexpod</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using ExpressVPN for many years, I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to use, press the big power on button</p>
<p>and your privacy is protected.</p>
<p>And if you like, you can make it look</p>
<p>like your location is anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>I might be in Boston now, but I can make it look</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m in New York, London, Paris, or anywhere else.</p>
<p>This has a large number of obvious benefits.</p>
<p>Certainly, it allows you to access international versions</p>
<p>of streaming websites like the Japanese Netflix</p>
<p>or the UK Hulu.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.</p>
<p>I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu, Windows, Android,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s available everywhere else too.</p>
<p>Once again, get it at expressvpn.com slash lexpod</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Harry Kliff.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with probably one of the coolest things</p>
<p>that human beings have ever created,</p>
<p>the Large Hadron Collider, OHC.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s essentially this gigantic</p>
<p>27 kilometer circumference particle accelerator.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this big ring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s buried about 100 meters underneath the surface</p>
<p>in the countryside just outside Geneva in Switzerland.</p>
<p>And really what it&rsquo;s for, ultimately,</p>
<p>is to try to understand what are the basic building blocks</p>
<p>of the universe.</p>
<p>So you can think of it in a way</p>
<p>as like a gigantic microscope,</p>
<p>and the analogy is actually fairly precise, so.</p>
<p>Gigantic microscope.</p>
<p>Effectively, except it&rsquo;s a microscope</p>
<p>that looks at the structure of the vacuum.</p>
<p>In order for this kind of thing to study particles,</p>
<p>which are the microscopic entities, it has to be huge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gigantic microscope.</p>
<p>So what do you mean by studying vacuum?</p>
<p>Okay, so I mean, so particle physics as a field</p>
<p>is kind of badly named in a way,</p>
<p>because particles are not the fundamental ingredients</p>
<p>of the universe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not fundamental at all.</p>
<p>So the things that we believe</p>
<p>are the real building blocks of the universe</p>
<p>are objects, invisible fluid like objects</p>
<p>called quantum fields.</p>
<p>So these are fields like the magnetic field</p>
<p>around a magnet that exists everywhere in space.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always there.</p>
<p>In fact, actually, it&rsquo;s funny that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the Royal Institution,</p>
<p>because this is where the idea of the field</p>
<p>was effectively invented by Michael Faraday</p>
<p>doing experiments with magnets and coils of wire.</p>
<p>So he noticed that, you know,</p>
<p>it was a very famous experiment that he did</p>
<p>where he got a magnet and put on top of it a piece of paper</p>
<p>and then sprinkled iron filings.</p>
<p>And he found the iron filings arranged themselves</p>
<p>into these kind of loops,</p>
<p>which was actually mapping out the invisible influence</p>
<p>of this magnetic field, which is a thing, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all experienced, we&rsquo;ve all felt, held a magnet</p>
<p>or two poles of magnet and pushed them together</p>
<p>and felt this thing, this force pushing back.</p>
<p>So these are real physical objects.</p>
<p>And the way we think of particles in modern physics</p>
<p>is that they are essentially little vibrations,</p>
<p>little ripples in these otherwise invisible fields</p>
<p>that are everywhere.</p>
<p>They fill the whole universe.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t, I apologize perhaps</p>
<p>for the ridiculous question.</p>
<p>Are you comfortable with the idea</p>
<p>of the fundamental nature of our reality being fields?</p>
<p>Because to me, particles, you know,</p>
<p>a bunch of different building blocks makes more sense</p>
<p>sort of intellectually, sort of visually,</p>
<p>like it seems to, I seem to be able to visualize</p>
<p>that kind of idea easier.</p>
<p>Are you comfortable psychologically with the idea</p>
<p>that the basic building block is not a block, but a field?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s quite a magical idea.</p>
<p>I find it quite appealing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, well, it comes from a misunderstanding</p>
<p>of what particles are.</p>
<p>So like when you, when we do science at school</p>
<p>and we draw a picture of an atom,</p>
<p>you draw like, you know, a nucleus with some protons</p>
<p>and neutrons, these little spheres in the middle,</p>
<p>and then you have some electrons that are like little flies</p>
<p>flying around the atom.</p>
<p>And that is a completely misleading picture</p>
<p>of what an atom is like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing like that.</p>
<p>The electron is not like a little planet orbiting the atom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this spread out, wibbly wobbly wave like thing.</p>
<p>And we know we&rsquo;ve known that since, you know,</p>
<p>the early 20th century, thanks to quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>So when we, we, we carry on using this word particle</p>
<p>because sometimes when we do experiments,</p>
<p>particles do behave like they&rsquo;re little marbles</p>
<p>or little bullets, you know.</p>
<p>So in the LHC, when we collide particles together,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get, you know, you&rsquo;ll get like hundreds of particles</p>
<p>all flying out through the detector</p>
<p>and they all take a trajectory and you can see</p>
<p>from the detector where they&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>and they look like they&rsquo;re little bullets.</p>
<p>So they behave that way, you know, a lot of the time.</p>
<p>When you really study them carefully,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that they are not little spheres.</p>
<p>They are these ethereal disturbances</p>
<p>in these underlying fields.</p>
<p>So this is really how we think nature is,</p>
<p>which is surprising, but also I think kind of magic.</p>
<p>So, you know, we are, our bodies are basically made up</p>
<p>of like little knots of energy</p>
<p>in these invisible objects that are all around us.</p>
<p>And what is the story of the vacuum when it comes to LHC?</p>
<p>So why did you mention the word vacuum?</p>
<p>Okay, so if we just, if we go back to like the physics,</p>
<p>we do know.</p>
<p>So atoms are made of electrons,</p>
<p>which were discovered a hundred or so years ago.</p>
<p>And then in the nucleus of the atom,</p>
<p>you have two other types of particles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an up, something called an up quark</p>
<p>and a down quark.</p>
<p>And those three particles make up every atom in the universe.</p>
<p>So we think of these as ripples in fields.</p>
<p>So there is something called the electron field</p>
<p>and every electron in the universe is a ripple moving</p>
<p>about in this electron field.</p>
<p>So the electron field is all around us, we can&rsquo;t see it,</p>
<p>but every electron in our body is a little ripple</p>
<p>in this thing that&rsquo;s there all the time.</p>
<p>And the quark fields are the same.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an up quark field and an up quark</p>
<p>is a little ripple in the up quark field.</p>
<p>And the down quark is a little ripple</p>
<p>in something else called the down quark field.</p>
<p>So these fields are always there.</p>
<p>Now there are potentially, we know about a certain number</p>
<p>of fields in what we call the standard model</p>
<p>of particle physics.</p>
<p>And the most recent one we discovered was the Higgs field.</p>
<p>And the way we discovered the Higgs field</p>
<p>was to make a little ripple in it.</p>
<p>So what the LHC did, it fired two protons into each other,</p>
<p>very, very hard with enough energy</p>
<p>that you could create a disturbance in this Higgs field.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what shows up as what we call the Higgs boson.</p>
<p>So this particle that everyone was going on about</p>
<p>eight or so years ago is proof really,</p>
<p>the particle in itself is, I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>but the thing that&rsquo;s really interesting is the field.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s the Higgs field that we believe</p>
<p>is the reason that electrons and quarks have mass.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that invisible field that&rsquo;s always there</p>
<p>that gives mass to the particles.</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is just our way</p>
<p>of checking it&rsquo;s there basically.</p>
<p>And so the Large Hadron Collider,</p>
<p>in order to get that ripple in the Higgs field,</p>
<p>it requires a huge amount of energy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I suppose.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you need this huge,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why size matters here.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s a million questions here,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s backtrack.</p>
<p>Why does size matter in the context of a particle collider?</p>
<p>So why does bigger allow you for higher energy collisions?</p>
<p>Right, so the reason, well, it&rsquo;s kind of simple really,</p>
<p>which is that there are two types of particle accelerator</p>
<p>that you can build.</p>
<p>One is circular, which is like the LHC,</p>
<p>the other is a great long line.</p>
<p>So the advantage of a circular machine</p>
<p>is that you can send particles around a ring</p>
<p>and you can give them a kick every time they go around.</p>
<p>So imagine you have a, there&rsquo;s actually a bit of the LHC,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about only 30 meters long,</p>
<p>where you have a bunch of metal boxes,</p>
<p>which have oscillating 2 million volt electric fields</p>
<p>inside them, which are timed so that when a proton</p>
<p>goes through one of these boxes,</p>
<p>the field it sees as it approaches is attractive.</p>
<p>And then as it leaves the box,</p>
<p>it flips and becomes repulsive</p>
<p>and the proton gets attracted</p>
<p>and kicked out the other side, so it gets a bit faster.</p>
<p>So you send it, and then you send it back round again.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s incredible, like the timing of that,</p>
<p>the synchronization, wait, really?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to be a multiplicative effect</p>
<p>on the questions I have.</p>
<p>Is, okay, let me just take that attention for a second.</p>
<p>The orchestration of that, is that fundamentally</p>
<p>a hardware problem or a software problem?</p>
<p>Like what, how do you get that?</p>
<p>I mean, I should first of all say, I&rsquo;m not an engineer.</p>
<p>So the guys, I did not build the LHC,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re people much, much better at this stuff than I.</p>
<p>For sure, but maybe.</p>
<p>But from your sort of intuition,</p>
<p>from the echoes of what you understand,</p>
<p>what you heard of how it&rsquo;s designed, what&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the engineering aspects of it?</p>
<p>The acceleration bit is not challenging.</p>
<p>Okay, I mean, okay, there&rsquo;s always challenges</p>
<p>with everything, but basically you have these,</p>
<p>the beams that go around the LHC, the beams of particles</p>
<p>are divided into little bunches.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re called, they&rsquo;re a bit like swarms of bees,</p>
<p>if you like, and there are around,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s something of the order 2000 bunches</p>
<p>spaced around the ring.</p>
<p>And they, if you&rsquo;re at a given point on the ring,</p>
<p>counting bunches, you get 40 million bunches</p>
<p>passing you every second.</p>
<p>So they come in like cars going past</p>
<p>on a very fast motorway.</p>
<p>So you need to have, if you&rsquo;re an electric field</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re using to accelerate the particles,</p>
<p>that needs to be timed so that as a bunch of protons arrives,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got the right sign to attract them</p>
<p>and then flips at the right moment.</p>
<p>But I think the voltage in those boxes</p>
<p>oscillates at hundreds of megahertz.</p>
<p>So the beams are like 40 megahertz,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s oscillating much more quickly than the beam.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s difficult engineering,</p>
<p>but in principle, it&rsquo;s not a really serious challenge.</p>
<p>The bigger problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably engineers like screaming at you right now.</p>
<p>Probably, but I mean, okay.</p>
<p>So in terms of coming back to this thing,</p>
<p>why is it so big?</p>
<p>Well, the reason is you wanna get the particles</p>
<p>through that accelerating element over and over again.</p>
<p>So you wanna bring them back round.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s round.</p>
<p>The question is why couldn&rsquo;t you make it smaller?</p>
<p>Well, the basic answer is that these particles</p>
<p>are going unbelievably quickly.</p>
<p>So they travel at 99.9999991% of the speed of light</p>
<p>in the LHC.</p>
<p>And if you think about, say,</p>
<p>driving your car around a corner at high speed,</p>
<p>if you go fast, you need a lot of friction in the tires</p>
<p>to make sure you don&rsquo;t slide off the road.</p>
<p>So the limiting factor is how powerful a magnet can you make</p>
<p>because what we do is magnets are used</p>
<p>to bend the particles around the ring.</p>
<p>And essentially the LHC, when it was designed,</p>
<p>was designed with the most powerful magnets</p>
<p>that could conceivably be built at the time.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s your kind of limiting factor.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to make the machine smaller,</p>
<p>that means a tighter bend,</p>
<p>you need to have a more powerful magnet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this toss up between how strong are your magnets</p>
<p>versus how big a tunnel can you afford.</p>
<p>The bigger the tunnel, the weaker the magnets can be.</p>
<p>The smaller the tunnel, the stronger they&rsquo;ve gotta be.</p>
<p>Okay, so maybe can we backtrack to the Standard Model</p>
<p>and say what kind of particles there are, period,</p>
<p>and maybe the history of kind of assembling</p>
<p>that the Standard Model of physics</p>
<p>and then how that leads up to the hopes and dreams</p>
<p>and the accomplishments of the Large Hadron Collider.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, okay.</p>
<p>So all of 20th century physics in like five minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah, please.</p>
<p>Okay, so, okay, the story really begins properly.</p>
<p>End of the 19th century, the basic view of matter</p>
<p>is that matter is made of atoms</p>
<p>and the atoms are indestructible, immutable little spheres</p>
<p>like the things we were talking about</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t really exist.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one atom for every chemical element.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an atom for hydrogen, for helium,</p>
<p>for carbon, for iron, et cetera, and they&rsquo;re all different.</p>
<p>Then in 1897, experiments done</p>
<p>at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge,</p>
<p>which is where I&rsquo;m still, where I&rsquo;m based,</p>
<p>showed that there are actually smaller particles</p>
<p>inside the atom, which eventually became known as electrons.</p>
<p>So these are these negatively charged things</p>
<p>that go around the outside.</p>
<p>A few years later, Ernest Rutherford,</p>
<p>very famous nuclear physicist,</p>
<p>one of the pioneers of nuclear physics</p>
<p>shows that the atom has a tiny nugget in the center,</p>
<p>which we call the nucleus,</p>
<p>which is a positively charged object.</p>
<p>So then by like 1910, 11, we have this model of the atom</p>
<p>that we learn in school,</p>
<p>which is you&rsquo;ve got a nucleus, electrons go around it.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, the nucleus,</p>
<p>people start doing experiments with radioactivity</p>
<p>where they use alpha particles</p>
<p>that are spat out of radioactive elements as bullets,</p>
<p>and they fire them at other atoms.</p>
<p>And by banging things into each other,</p>
<p>they see that they can knock bits out of the nucleus.</p>
<p>So these things come out called protons, first of all,</p>
<p>which are positively charged particles</p>
<p>about 2000 times heavier than the electron.</p>
<p>And then 10 years later, more or less,</p>
<p>a neutral particle is discovered called the neutron.</p>
<p>So those are the three basic building blocks of atoms.</p>
<p>You have protons and neutrons in the nucleus</p>
<p>that are stuck together by something called the strong force,</p>
<p>the strong nuclear force,</p>
<p>and you have electrons in orbit around that,</p>
<p>held in by the electromagnetic force,</p>
<p>which is one of the forces of nature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of where we get to by like 1932, more or less.</p>
<p>Then what happens is physics is nice and neat.</p>
<p>In 1932, everything looks great, got three particles</p>
<p>and all the atoms are made of, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But then cloud chamber experiments.</p>
<p>These are devices that can be used to,</p>
<p>the first device is capable of imaging subatomic particles</p>
<p>so you can see their tracks.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re used to study cosmic rays,</p>
<p>particles that come from outer space</p>
<p>and bang into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>And in these experiments,</p>
<p>people start to see a whole load of new particles.</p>
<p>So they discover for one thing antimatter,</p>
<p>which is the sort of a mirror image of the particles.</p>
<p>So we discovered that there&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>as well as a negatively charged electron,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called a positron,</p>
<p>which is a positively charged version of the electron.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an antiproton, which is negatively charged.</p>
<p>And then a whole load of other weird particles</p>
<p>start to get discovered.</p>
<p>And no one really knows what they are.</p>
<p>This is known as the zoo of particles.</p>
<p>Are these discoveries from the first theoretical discoveries</p>
<p>or are they discoveries in an experiment?</p>
<p>So like, yeah, what&rsquo;s the process of discovery</p>
<p>for these early sets of particles?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mixture.</p>
<p>The early stuff around the atom is really</p>
<p>experimentally driven.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not based on some theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exploration in the lab using equipment.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really people just figuring out,</p>
<p>getting hands on with the phenomena,</p>
<p>figuring out what these things are.</p>
<p>And the theory comes a bit later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
<p>So in the discovery of the anti electron, the positron,</p>
<p>that was predicted from quantum mechanics and relativity</p>
<p>by a very clever theoretical physicist called Paul Dirac,</p>
<p>who was probably the second brightest physicist</p>
<p>of the 20th century, apart from Einstein,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t anywhere near as well known.</p>
<p>So he predicted the existence of the anti electron</p>
<p>from basically a combination of the theories</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics and relativity.</p>
<p>And it was discovered about a year after</p>
<p>he made the prediction.</p>
<p>What happens when an electron meets a positron?</p>
<p>They annihilate each other.</p>
<p>So when you bring a particle and its antiparticle together,</p>
<p>they react, well, they don&rsquo;t react,</p>
<p>they just wipe each other out and they turn,</p>
<p>their mass is turned into energy,</p>
<p>usually in the form of photons, so you get light produced.</p>
<p>So when you have that kind of situation,</p>
<p>why does the universe exist at all</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s matter in any matter?</p>
<p>Oh God, now we&rsquo;re getting into the really big questions.</p>
<p>So, do you wanna go there now?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, maybe let&rsquo;s go there later.</p>
<p>Cause that, I mean, that is a very big question.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s take it slow with the standard model.</p>
<p>So, okay, so there&rsquo;s matter and antimatter in the 30s.</p>
<p>So what else?</p>
<p>So matter and antimatter,</p>
<p>and then a load of new particles start turning up</p>
<p>in these cosmic ray experiments, first of all.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t seem to be particles that make up atoms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re something else.</p>
<p>They all mostly interact with a strong nuclear force.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re a bit like protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>And by, in the 1960s in America, particularly,</p>
<p>but also in Europe and Russia,</p>
<p>scientists started to build particle accelerators.</p>
<p>So these are the forerunners of the LHC.</p>
<p>So big ring shaped machines that were, you know,</p>
<p>hundreds of meters long, which in those days was enormous.</p>
<p>You never, you know, most physics up until that point</p>
<p>had been done in labs, in universities, you know,</p>
<p>with small bits of kit.</p>
<p>So this is a big change.</p>
<p>And when these accelerators are built,</p>
<p>they start to find they can produce</p>
<p>even more of these particles.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know the exact numbers, but by around 1960,</p>
<p>there are of order a hundred of these things</p>
<p>that have been discovered.</p>
<p>And physicists are kind of tearing their hair out</p>
<p>because physics is all about simplification.</p>
<p>And suddenly what was simple has become messy</p>
<p>and complicated and everyone sort of wants</p>
<p>to understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>As a quick kind of aside and probably really dumb question,</p>
<p>but how is it possible to take something like a,</p>
<p>like a photon or electron and be able to control it enough,</p>
<p>like to be able to do a controlled experiment</p>
<p>where you collide it against something else?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that, is that, that seems like an exceptionally difficult</p>
<p>engineering challenge because you mentioned vacuum too.</p>
<p>So you basically want to remove every other distraction</p>
<p>and really focus on this collision.</p>
<p>How difficult of an engineering challenge is that?</p>
<p>Just to get a sense.</p>
<p>And it is very hard.</p>
<p>I mean, in the early days,</p>
<p>particularly when the first accelerators are being built</p>
<p>in like 1932, Ernest Lawrence builds the first,</p>
<p>what we call a cyclotron,</p>
<p>which is like a little accelerator, this big or so.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>Is it really that big?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tiny little thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So most of the first accelerators</p>
<p>were what we call fixed target experiments.</p>
<p>So you had a ring, you accelerate particles around the ring</p>
<p>and then you fire them out the side into some target.</p>
<p>So that makes the kind of,</p>
<p>the colliding bit is relatively straightforward</p>
<p>because you just fire it,</p>
<p>whatever it is you want to fire it at.</p>
<p>The hard bit is the steering the beams</p>
<p>with the magnetic fields, getting, you know,</p>
<p>strong enough electric fields to accelerate them,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>The first colliders where you have two beams</p>
<p>colliding head on, that comes later.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s done until maybe the 1980s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure, but it&rsquo;s a much harder problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Cause you have to like perfectly get them to hit each other.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about, I mean, what scale it takes,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the, I mean, the temporal thing is a giant mess,</p>
<p>but the spatially, like the size is tiny.</p>
<p>Well, to give you a sense of the LHC beams,</p>
<p>the cross sectional diameter is I think around a dozen</p>
<p>or so microns.</p>
<p>So, you know, 10 millionths of a meter.</p>
<p>And a beam, sorry, just to clarify,</p>
<p>a beam contains how many,</p>
<p>is it the bunches that you mentioned?</p>
<p>Is it multiple particles or is it just one particle?</p>
<p>Oh no, no.</p>
<p>The bunches contains say a hundred billion protons each.</p>
<p>So a bunch is, it&rsquo;s not really bunch shaped.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually quite long.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like 30 centimeters long,</p>
<p>but thinner than a human hair.</p>
<p>So like very, very narrow, long sort of objects.</p>
<p>Those are the things.</p>
<p>So what happens in the LHC is you steer the beams</p>
<p>so that they cross in the middle of the detector.</p>
<p>So they basically have these swarms of protons</p>
<p>that are flying through each other.</p>
<p>And most of the, you have to have a hundred billion</p>
<p>coming one way, a hundred billion another way,</p>
<p>maybe 10 of them will hit each other.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So this, okay, that makes a lot more sense.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re trying to use sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like probabilistically, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make a single particle collide</p>
<p>with a single other particle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an efficient way to do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be waiting a very long time to get anything.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically, right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re relying on probability to be that some fraction</p>
<p>of them are gonna collide.</p>
<p>And then you know which,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a swarm of the same kind of particle.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter which ones hit each other exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s not hard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to, one of the challenges</p>
<p>to make the collisions work is you have to squash</p>
<p>these beams to very, very,</p>
<p>basically the narrower they are the better</p>
<p>cause the higher chances of them colliding.</p>
<p>If you think about two flocks of birds</p>
<p>flying through each other,</p>
<p>the birds are all far apart in the flocks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much chance that they&rsquo;ll collide.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re all flying densely together,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re much more likely to collide with each other.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the sort of problem.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s tuning those magnetic fields,</p>
<p>getting the magnetic fields powerful enough</p>
<p>that you squash the beams and focus them</p>
<p>so that you get enough collisions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s super cool.</p>
<p>Do you know how much software is involved here?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s sort of,</p>
<p>I come from the software world and it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>This seems like software is buggy and messy.</p>
<p>And so like, you almost don&rsquo;t want to rely</p>
<p>on software too much.</p>
<p>Like if you do, it has to be like low level,</p>
<p>like Fortran style programming.</p>
<p>Do you know how much software</p>
<p>is in a large Hadron Collider?</p>
<p>I mean, it depends at which level a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole thing is obviously computer controlled.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know a huge amount</p>
<p>about how the software for the actual accelerator works,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been in the control center.</p>
<p>So at CERN, there&rsquo;s this big control room,</p>
<p>which is like a bit like a NASA mission control</p>
<p>with big banks of desks where the engineers sit</p>
<p>and they monitor the LHC.</p>
<p>Cause you obviously can&rsquo;t be in the tunnel</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s running.</p>
<p>So everything&rsquo;s remote.</p>
<p>I mean, one sort of anecdote about the software side,</p>
<p>in 2008, when the LHC first switched on,</p>
<p>they had this big launch event</p>
<p>and then big press conference party</p>
<p>to inaugurate the machine.</p>
<p>And about 10 days after that,</p>
<p>they were doing some tests</p>
<p>and this dramatic event happened</p>
<p>where a huge explosion basically took place</p>
<p>in the tunnel that destroyed or damaged, badly damaged</p>
<p>about half a kilometer of the machine.</p>
<p>But the stories, the engineers</p>
<p>are in the control room that day.</p>
<p>One guy told me this story about,</p>
<p>basically all these screens they have in the control room</p>
<p>started going red.</p>
<p>So these alarms like kind of in software going off</p>
<p>and then they assume that there&rsquo;s something wrong</p>
<p>with the software, cause there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>something this catastrophic could have happened.</p>
<p>But I mean, when I worked on, when I was a PhD student,</p>
<p>one of my jobs was to help to maintain the software</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s used to control the detector that we work on.</p>
<p>And that was, it&rsquo;s relatively robust,</p>
<p>not such, you don&rsquo;t want it to be too fancy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want it to sort of fall over too easily.</p>
<p>The more clever stuff comes</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about analyzing the data</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where the sort of, you know.</p>
<p>Are we jumping around too much?</p>
<p>Do we finish with a standard model?</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t, no.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t, so have we even started talking about quarks?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked to them yet.</p>
<p>No, we got to the messy zoo of particles.</p>
<p>Let me, let&rsquo;s go back there if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Can you take us to the rest of the history of physics</p>
<p>in the 20th century?</p>
<p>Okay, sure.</p>
<p>Okay, so circa 1960, you have this,</p>
<p>you have these a hundred or so particles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like the periodic table all over again.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got like having a hundred elements,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of a bit like that.</p>
<p>And people start to try to impose some order.</p>
<p>So Murray Gellman, he&rsquo;s a theoretical physicist,</p>
<p>American from New York.</p>
<p>He realizes that there are these symmetries</p>
<p>in these particles that if you arrange them in certain ways,</p>
<p>they relate to each other.</p>
<p>And he uses these symmetry principles</p>
<p>to predict the existence of particles</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t been discovered,</p>
<p>which are then discovered in accelerators.</p>
<p>So this starts to suggest</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not just random collections of crap.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, you know, actually some order</p>
<p>to this underlying it.</p>
<p>A little bit later in 1960, again, around the 1960s,</p>
<p>he proposes along with another physicist called George Zweig</p>
<p>that these symmetries arise because</p>
<p>just like the patterns in the periodic table arise</p>
<p>because atoms are made of electrons and protons,</p>
<p>that these patterns are due to the fact</p>
<p>that these particles are made of smaller things.</p>
<p>And they are called quarks.</p>
<p>So these are the particles they&rsquo;re predicted from theory.</p>
<p>For a long time, no one really believes they&rsquo;re real.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that they&rsquo;re a kind of theoretical</p>
<p>convenience that happened to fit the data,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no evidence.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s ever seen a quark in any experiment.</p>
<p>And lots of experiments are done to try to find quarks,</p>
<p>to try to knock a quark out of a&hellip;</p>
<p>So the idea, if protons and neutrons are made of quarks,</p>
<p>you should be able to knock a quark out and see the quark.</p>
<p>That never happens.</p>
<p>And we still have never actually managed to do that.</p>
<p>Wait, really?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So the way that it&rsquo;s done in the end</p>
<p>is this machine that&rsquo;s built in California</p>
<p>at the Stanford Lab, Stanford Linear Accelerator,</p>
<p>which is essentially a gigantic,</p>
<p>three kilometer long electron gun.</p>
<p>It fires electrons, almost the speed of light, at protons.</p>
<p>And when you do these experiments,</p>
<p>what you find is at very high energy,</p>
<p>the electrons bounce off small, hard objects</p>
<p>inside the proton.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit like taking an X ray of the proton.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re firing these very light, high energy particles,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re pinging off little things inside the proton</p>
<p>that are like ball bearings, if you like.</p>
<p>So you actually, that way,</p>
<p>they resolve that there are three things</p>
<p>inside the proton, which are quarks,</p>
<p>the quarks that Gellman and Zweig had predicted.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really the evidence that convinces people</p>
<p>that these things are real.</p>
<p>The fact that we&rsquo;ve never seen one</p>
<p>in an experiment directly,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always stuck inside other particles.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is essentially</p>
<p>to do with a strong force.</p>
<p>The strong force is the force that holds quarks together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so strong that it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>to actually liberate a quark.</p>
<p>So if you try and pull a quark out of a proton,</p>
<p>what actually ends up happening</p>
<p>is that you kind of create this spring like bond</p>
<p>in the strong force.</p>
<p>You imagine two quarks that are held together</p>
<p>by a very powerful spring.</p>
<p>You pull and pull and pull,</p>
<p>more and more energy gets stored in that bond,</p>
<p>like stretching a spring,</p>
<p>and eventually the tension gets so great,</p>
<p>the spring snaps, and the energy in that bond</p>
<p>gets turned into two new quarks</p>
<p>that go on the broken ends.</p>
<p>So you started with two quarks,</p>
<p>you end up with four quarks.</p>
<p>So you never actually get to take a quark out.</p>
<p>You just end up making loads more quarks in the process.</p>
<p>So how do we, again, forgive the dumb question,</p>
<p>how do we know quarks are real then?</p>
<p>Well, A, from these experiments where we can scatter,</p>
<p>you fire electrons into the protons.</p>
<p>They can burrow into the proton and knock off,</p>
<p>and they can bounce off these quarks.</p>
<p>So you can see from the angles,</p>
<p>the electrons come out.</p>
<p>I see, you can infer.</p>
<p>You can infer that these things are there.</p>
<p>The quark model can also be used.</p>
<p>It has a lot of successes that you can use it</p>
<p>to predict the existence of new particles</p>
<p>that hadn&rsquo;t been seen.</p>
<p>So, and it basically, there&rsquo;s lots of data</p>
<p>basically showing from, you know,</p>
<p>when we fire protons at each other at the LHC,</p>
<p>a lot of quarks get knocked all over the place.</p>
<p>And every time they try and escape from,</p>
<p>say, one of their protons,</p>
<p>they make a whole jet of quarks that go flying off,</p>
<p>bound up in other sorts of particles made of quarks.</p>
<p>So all the sort of the theoretical predictions</p>
<p>from the basic theory of the strong force and the quarks</p>
<p>all agrees with what we are seeing in experiments.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just never seen an actual quark on its own</p>
<p>because unfortunately it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>to get them out on their own.</p>
<p>So quarks, these crazy smaller things</p>
<p>that are hard to imagine are real.</p>
<p>So what else?</p>
<p>What else is part of the story here?</p>
<p>So the other thing that&rsquo;s going on at the time,</p>
<p>around the 60s, is an attempt to understand the forces</p>
<p>that make these particles interact with each other.</p>
<p>So you have the electromagnetic force,</p>
<p>which is the force that was sort of discovered</p>
<p>to some extent in this room, or at least in this building.</p>
<p>So the first, what we call quantum field theory</p>
<p>of the electromagnetic force is developed</p>
<p>in the 1940s and 50s by Feynman,</p>
<p>Richard Feynman amongst other people,</p>
<p>Julian Schrodinger, Tom Onaga,</p>
<p>who come up with the first,</p>
<p>what we call a quantum field theory</p>
<p>of the electromagnetic force.</p>
<p>And this is where this description of,</p>
<p>which I gave you at the beginning,</p>
<p>that particles are ripples in fields.</p>
<p>Well, in this theory, the photon, the particle of light</p>
<p>is described as a ripple in this quantum field</p>
<p>called the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>And the attempt then is made to try,</p>
<p>well, can we come up with a quantum field theory</p>
<p>of the other forces, of the strong force and the weak,</p>
<p>the third force, which we haven&rsquo;t discussed,</p>
<p>which is the weak force, which is a nuclear force.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really experience it in our everyday lives,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s responsible for radioactive decay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the force that allows, you know,</p>
<p>on a radioactive atom to turn</p>
<p>into a different element, for example.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve explicitly mentioned,</p>
<p>but so there&rsquo;s technically four forces.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I guess three of them would be in the standard model,</p>
<p>like the weak, the strong, and the electromagnetic,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s gravity.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s gravity, which we don&rsquo;t worry about that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too hard.</p>
<p>Well, no, maybe we bring that up at the end, but yeah.</p>
<p>Gravity, so far, we don&rsquo;t have a quantum theory of,</p>
<p>and if you can solve that problem,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll win a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re gonna have to bring up</p>
<p>the graviton at some point, I&rsquo;m gonna ask you,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s leave that to the side for now.</p>
<p>So those three, okay, Feynman, electromagnetic force,</p>
<p>the quantum field, and where does the weak force come in?</p>
<p>So yeah, well, first of all,</p>
<p>I mean, the strong force is the easiest.</p>
<p>The strong force is a little bit</p>
<p>like the electromagnetic force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a force that binds things together.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the force that holds quarks together</p>
<p>inside the proton, for example.</p>
<p>So a quantum field theory of that force</p>
<p>is discovered in the, I think it&rsquo;s in the 60s,</p>
<p>and it predicts the existence</p>
<p>of new force particles called gluons.</p>
<p>So gluons are a bit like the photon.</p>
<p>The photon is the particle of electromagnetism.</p>
<p>Gluons are the particles of the strong force.</p>
<p>So just like there&rsquo;s an electromagnetic field,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called a gluon field,</p>
<p>which is also all around us.</p>
<p>So some of these particles, I guess,</p>
<p>are the force carriers or whatever.</p>
<p>They carry the force.</p>
<p>It depends how you want to think about it.</p>
<p>I mean, really the field, the strong force field,</p>
<p>the gluon field is the thing that binds the quarks together.</p>
<p>The gluons are the little ripples in that field.</p>
<p>So that like, in the same way that the photon is a ripple</p>
<p>in the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>But the thing that really does the binding is the field.</p>
<p>I mean, you may have heard people talk about things</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve heard the phrase virtual particle.</p>
<p>So sometimes in some, if you hear people describing</p>
<p>how forces are exchanged between particles,</p>
<p>they quite often talk about the idea</p>
<p>that if you have an electron and another electron, say,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re repelling each other</p>
<p>through the electromagnetic force,</p>
<p>you can think of that as if they&rsquo;re exchanging photons.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re kind of firing photons</p>
<p>backwards and forwards between each other.</p>
<p>And that causes them to repel.</p>
<p>That photon is then a virtual particle.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what we call a virtual particle.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s not a real thing,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t actually exist.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an artifact of the way theorists do calculations.</p>
<p>So when they do calculations in quantum field theory,</p>
<p>rather than, no one&rsquo;s discovered a way</p>
<p>of just treating the whole field.</p>
<p>You have to break the field down into simpler things.</p>
<p>So you can basically treat the field</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s made up of lots of these virtual photons,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no experiment that you can do</p>
<p>that can detect these particles being exchanged.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really happening in reality</p>
<p>is that the electromagnetic field is warped</p>
<p>by the charge of the electron and that causes the force.</p>
<p>But the way we do calculations involves particles.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit confusing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really a mathematical technique.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that corresponds to reality.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part, I guess, of the Feynman diagrams.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is this these virtual particles, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, yeah.</p>
<p>Some of these have mass, some of them don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What does that even mean, not to have mass?</p>
<p>And maybe you can say which one of them have mass</p>
<p>and which don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>And why is mass important or relevant</p>
<p>in this field view of the universe?</p>
<p>Well, there are actually only two particles</p>
<p>in the standard model that don&rsquo;t have mass,</p>
<p>which are the photon and the gluons.</p>
<p>So they are massless particles,</p>
<p>but the electron, the quarks,</p>
<p>and there are a bunch of other particles</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t discussed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called a muon and a tau,</p>
<p>which are basically heavy versions of the electron</p>
<p>that are unstable.</p>
<p>You can make them in accelerators,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t form atoms or anything.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t exist for long enough.</p>
<p>But all the matter particles, there are 12 of them,</p>
<p>six quarks and six, what we call leptons,</p>
<p>which includes the electron and its two heavy versions</p>
<p>and three neutrinos, all of them have mass.</p>
<p>And so do, this is the critical bit.</p>
<p>So the weak force, which is the third of these</p>
<p>quantum forces, which is one of the hardest to understand,</p>
<p>the force particles of that force have very large masses.</p>
<p>And there are three of them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called the W plus, the W minus, and the Z boson.</p>
<p>And they have masses of between 80 and 90 times</p>
<p>that of the protons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very heavy.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very heavy things.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re what, the heaviest, I guess?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the heaviest.</p>
<p>The heaviest particle is the top quark,</p>
<p>which has a mass of about 175 ish protons.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really massive.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s so massive,</p>
<p>but coming back to the weak force,</p>
<p>so the problem in the 60s and 70s was that</p>
<p>the reason that the electromagnetic force</p>
<p>is a force that we can experience in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>So if we have a magnet and a piece of metal,</p>
<p>you can hold it, you know, a meter apart</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s powerful enough and you&rsquo;ll feel a force.</p>
<p>Whereas the weak force only becomes apparent</p>
<p>when you basically have two particles touching</p>
<p>at the scale of a nucleus.</p>
<p>So we just get to very short distances</p>
<p>before this force becomes manifest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, we don&rsquo;t get weak forces going on in this room.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t notice them.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that the particle,</p>
<p>well, the field that transmits the weak force,</p>
<p>the particle that&rsquo;s associated with that field</p>
<p>has a very large mass,</p>
<p>which means that the field dies off very quickly.</p>
<p>So as you, whereas an electric charge,</p>
<p>if you were to look at the shape of the electromagnetic field,</p>
<p>it would fall off with this,</p>
<p>you have this thing called the inverse square law,</p>
<p>which is the idea that the force halves</p>
<p>every time you double the distance.</p>
<p>No, sorry, it doesn&rsquo;t half.</p>
<p>It quarters every time you double the distance</p>
<p>between say the two particles.</p>
<p>Whereas the weak force kind of,</p>
<p>you move a little bit away from the nucleus</p>
<p>and just disappears.</p>
<p>The reason for that is because these fields,</p>
<p>the particles that go with them have a very large mass.</p>
<p>But the problem that theorists faced in the 60s</p>
<p>was that if you tried to introduce massive force fields,</p>
<p>the theory gave you nonsensical answers.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d end up with infinite results</p>
<p>for a lot of the calculations you tried to do.</p>
<p>So the basically, it seemed that quantum field theory</p>
<p>was incompatible with having massive particles,</p>
<p>not just the force particles actually,</p>
<p>but even the electron was a problem.</p>
<p>So this is where the Higgs</p>
<p>that we sort of alluded to comes in.</p>
<p>And the solution was to say, okay, well,</p>
<p>actually all the particles in the Standard Model are mass.</p>
<p>They have no mass.</p>
<p>So the quarks, the electron, they don&rsquo;t have a mass.</p>
<p>Neither do these weak particles.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have mass either.</p>
<p>What happens is they actually acquire mass</p>
<p>through another process.</p>
<p>They get it from somewhere else.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually have it intrinsically.</p>
<p>So this idea that was introduced by,</p>
<p>well, Peter Higgs is the most famous,</p>
<p>but actually there are about six people</p>
<p>that came up with the idea more or less at the same time,</p>
<p>is that you introduce a new quantum field,</p>
<p>which is another one of these invisible things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s everywhere.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s through the interaction with this field</p>
<p>that particles get mass.</p>
<p>So you can think of say an electron in the Higgs field,</p>
<p>the Higgs field kind of bunches around the electron.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of drawn towards the electron.</p>
<p>And that energy that&rsquo;s stored in that field</p>
<p>around the electron is what we see</p>
<p>as the mass of the electron.</p>
<p>But if you could somehow turn off the Higgs field,</p>
<p>then all the particles in nature would become massless</p>
<p>and fly around at the speed of light.</p>
<p>So this idea of the Higgs field allowed other people,</p>
<p>other theorists to come up with a, well,</p>
<p>it was another, basically a unified theory</p>
<p>of the electromagnetic force and the weak force.</p>
<p>So once you bring in the Higgs field,</p>
<p>you can combine two of the forces into one.</p>
<p>So it turns out the electromagnetic force</p>
<p>and the weak force are just two aspects</p>
<p>of the same fundamental force.</p>
<p>And at the LHC, we go to high enough energies</p>
<p>that you see these two forces unifying effectively.</p>
<p>So first of all, it started as a theoretical notion,</p>
<p>like this is some, and then, I mean,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t the Higgs called the God particle at some point?</p>
<p>It was by a guy trying to sell popular science books, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, I remember because when I was hearing it,</p>
<p>I thought it would, I mean, that would solve a lot of,</p>
<p>that unify a lot of our ideas of physics was my notion.</p>
<p>But maybe you can speak to that.</p>
<p>Is it as big of a leap as a God particle</p>
<p>or is it a Jesus particle, which, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the big contribution of Higgs</p>
<p>in terms of this unification power?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, to understand that,</p>
<p>it maybe helps know the history a little bit.</p>
<p>So when the, what we call electroweak theory</p>
<p>was put together, which is where you unify electromagnetism</p>
<p>with the weak force and Higgs is involved in all of that.</p>
<p>So that theory, which was written in the mid 70s,</p>
<p>predicted the existence of four new particles,</p>
<p>the W plus boson, the W minus boson,</p>
<p>the Z boson and the Higgs boson.</p>
<p>So there were these four particles</p>
<p>that came with the theory,</p>
<p>that were predicted by the theory.</p>
<p>In 1983, 84, the W&rsquo;s and the Z particles</p>
<p>were discovered at an accelerator at CERN</p>
<p>called the super proton synchrotron,</p>
<p>which was a seven kilometer particle collider.</p>
<p>So three of the bits of this theory had already been found.</p>
<p>So people were pretty confident from the 80s</p>
<p>that the Higgs must exist</p>
<p>because it was a part of this family of particles</p>
<p>that this theoretical structure only works</p>
<p>if the Higgs is there.</p>
<p>So what then happens,</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;ve got this question about</p>
<p>why is the LHC the size it is?</p>
<p>Well, actually the tunnel that the LHC is in</p>
<p>was not built for the LHC.</p>
<p>It was built for a previous accelerator</p>
<p>called the large electron positron collider.</p>
<p>So that began operation in the late 80s, early 90s.</p>
<p>They basically, that&rsquo;s when they dug</p>
<p>the 27 kilometer tunnel.</p>
<p>They put this accelerator into it,</p>
<p>the collider that fires electrons</p>
<p>and anti electrons at each other, electrons and positrons.</p>
<p>So the purpose of that machine was,</p>
<p>well, it was actually to look for the Higgs.</p>
<p>That was one of the things it was trying to do.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have enough energy to do it in the end.</p>
<p>But the main thing it achieved was it studied</p>
<p>the W and the Z particles at very high precision.</p>
<p>So it made loads of these things.</p>
<p>Previously, you can only make a few of them</p>
<p>at the previous accelerator.</p>
<p>So you could study these really, really precisely.</p>
<p>And by studying their properties,</p>
<p>you could really test this electroweak theory</p>
<p>that had been invented in the 70s</p>
<p>and really make sure that it worked.</p>
<p>So actually by 1999, when this machine turned off,</p>
<p>people knew, well, okay, you never know</p>
<p>until you find the thing.</p>
<p>But people were really confident</p>
<p>this electroweak theory was right.</p>
<p>And that the Higgs almost,</p>
<p>the Higgs or something very like the Higgs had to exist</p>
<p>because otherwise the whole thing doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be really weird if you could discover</p>
<p>and these particles, they all behave exactly</p>
<p>as your theory tells you they should.</p>
<p>But somehow this key piece of the picture is not there.</p>
<p>So in a way, it depends how you look at it.</p>
<p>The discovery of the Higgs on its own</p>
<p>is obviously a huge achievement in many,</p>
<p>both experimentally and theoretically.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s like having a jigsaw puzzle</p>
<p>where every piece has been filled in.</p>
<p>You have this beautiful image, there&rsquo;s one gap</p>
<p>and you kind of know that piece must be there somewhere.</p>
<p>So the discovery in itself, although it&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>is not so interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a confirmation of the obvious at that point.</p>
<p>But what makes it interesting</p>
<p>is not that it just completes the standard model,</p>
<p>which is a theory that we&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>had the basic layout offs for 40 years or more now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that the Higgs actually is a unique particle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different to any of the other particles</p>
<p>in the standard model.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a theoretically very troublesome particle.</p>
<p>There are a lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs,</p>
<p>but also opportunities.</p>
<p>So that we basically, we don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>how such an object can exist in the form that it does.</p>
<p>So there are lots of reasons for thinking</p>
<p>that the Higgs must come with a bunch of other particles</p>
<p>or that it&rsquo;s perhaps made of other things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a fundamental particle,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s made of smaller things.</p>
<p>I can talk about that if you like a bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still a notion, so the Higgs</p>
<p>might not be a fundamental particle,</p>
<p>that there might be some, it might, oh man.</p>
<p>So that is an idea, it&rsquo;s not been demonstrated to be true.</p>
<p>But I mean, all of these ideas basically come</p>
<p>from the fact that this is a problem</p>
<p>that motivated a lot of development in physics</p>
<p>in the last 30 years or so.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this basic fact that the Higgs field,</p>
<p>which is this field that&rsquo;s everywhere in the universe,</p>
<p>this is the thing that gives mass to the particles.</p>
<p>And the Higgs field is different from all the other fields</p>
<p>in that, let&rsquo;s say you take the electromagnetic field,</p>
<p>which is, if we actually were to measure</p>
<p>the electromagnetic field in this room,</p>
<p>we would measure all kinds of stuff going on</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s light, there&rsquo;s gonna be microwaves</p>
<p>and radio waves and stuff.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say we could go to a really, really remote part</p>
<p>of empty space and shield it and put a big box around it</p>
<p>and then measure the electromagnetic field in that box.</p>
<p>The field would be almost zero,</p>
<p>apart from some little quantum fluctuations,</p>
<p>but basically it goes to naught.</p>
<p>The Higgs field has a value everywhere.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit like the whole,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the entire space has got this energy</p>
<p>stored in the Higgs field, which is not zero,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s finite, it&rsquo;s a bit like having the temperature</p>
<p>of space raised to some background temperature.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that energy that gives mass to the particles.</p>
<p>So the reason that electrons and quarks have mass</p>
<p>is through the interaction with this energy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s stored in the Higgs field.</p>
<p>Now, it turns out that the precise value this energy has</p>
<p>has to be very carefully tuned if you want a universe</p>
<p>where interesting stuff can happen.</p>
<p>So if you push the Higgs field down,</p>
<p>it has a tendency to collapse to,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s a tendency,</p>
<p>if you do your sort of naive calculations,</p>
<p>there are basically two possible likely configurations</p>
<p>for the Higgs field, which is either it&rsquo;s zero everywhere,</p>
<p>in which case you have a universe</p>
<p>which is just particles with no mass that can&rsquo;t form atoms</p>
<p>and just fly about at the speed of light,</p>
<p>or it explodes to an enormous value,</p>
<p>what we call the Planck scale,</p>
<p>which is the scale of quantum gravity.</p>
<p>And at that point, if the Higgs field was that strong,</p>
<p>even an electron would become so massive</p>
<p>that it would collapse into a black hole.</p>
<p>And then you have a universe made of black holes</p>
<p>and nothing like us.</p>
<p>So it seems that the strength of the Higgs field</p>
<p>is to achieve the value that we see</p>
<p>requires what we call fine tuning of the laws of physics.</p>
<p>You have to fiddle around with the other fields</p>
<p>in the Standard Model and their properties</p>
<p>to just get it to this right sort of Goldilocks value</p>
<p>that allows atoms to exist.</p>
<p>This is deeply fishy.</p>
<p>People really dislike this.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I guess, so what would be,</p>
<p>so two explanations.</p>
<p>One, there&rsquo;s a god that designed this perfectly,</p>
<p>and two is there&rsquo;s an infinite number</p>
<p>of alternate universes,</p>
<p>and we just happen to be in the one in which life</p>
<p>is possible, complexity.</p>
<p>So when you say, I mean, life, any kind of complexity,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not either complete chaos or black holes.</p>
<p>I mean, how does that make you feel?</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a fascinating notion</p>
<p>that this perfectly tuned field</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the same everywhere is there.</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you make of that?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, so you laid out</p>
<p>two of the possible explanations.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Some, well, yeah, I mean, well,</p>
<p>someone, some cosmic creator went,</p>
<p>yeah, let&rsquo;s fix that to be at the right level.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one possibility, I guess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a scientifically testable one,</p>
<p>but theoretically, I guess, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt, but there could also be</p>
<p>not a designer, but couldn&rsquo;t there be just,</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m not sure what that would be,</p>
<p>but some kind of force that,</p>
<p>that some kind of mechanism</p>
<p>by which this kind of field is enforced</p>
<p>in order to create complexity,</p>
<p>basically forces that pull the universe</p>
<p>towards an interesting complexity.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, I mean, there are people</p>
<p>who have those ideas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really subscribe to them.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m saying, it sounds really stupid.</p>
<p>No, I mean, there are definitely people</p>
<p>that make those kind of arguments.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ideas that, I think it&rsquo;s Lee Smolin&rsquo;s idea,</p>
<p>or one, I think, that universes are born inside black holes.</p>
<p>And so, universes, they basically have</p>
<p>like Darwinian evolution of the universe,</p>
<p>where universes give birth to other universes.</p>
<p>And if universes where black holes can form</p>
<p>are more likely to give birth to more universes,</p>
<p>so you end up with universes which have similar laws.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, whatever.</p>
<p>Well, I talked to Lee recently on this podcast,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a reminder to me that the physics community</p>
<p>has like so many interesting characters in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry, so.</p>
<p>I mean, as an experimentalist, I tend to sort of think,</p>
<p>these are interesting ideas, but they&rsquo;re not really testable,</p>
<p>so I tend not to think about them very much.</p>
<p>So, I mean, going back to the science of this,</p>
<p>there is an explanation.</p>
<p>There is a possible solution to this problem of the Higgs,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t involve multiverses or creators fiddling about</p>
<p>with the laws of physics.</p>
<p>If the most popular solution</p>
<p>was something called supersymmetry,</p>
<p>which is a theory which involves a new type of symmetry</p>
<p>of the universe.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s one of the last types of symmetries</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s possible to have</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t already seen in nature,</p>
<p>which is a symmetry between force particles</p>
<p>and matter particles.</p>
<p>So what we call fermions, which are the matter particles</p>
<p>and bosons, which are force particles.</p>
<p>And if you have supersymmetry, then there is a super partner</p>
<p>for every particle in the standard model.</p>
<p>And without going into the details,</p>
<p>the effect of this basically is that you have</p>
<p>a whole bunch of other fields,</p>
<p>and these fields cancel out the effect</p>
<p>of the standard model fields,</p>
<p>and they stabilize the Higgs field at a nice sensible value.</p>
<p>So in supersymmetry, you naturally,</p>
<p>without any tinkering about with the constants of nature</p>
<p>or anything, you get a Higgs field with a nice value,</p>
<p>which is the one we see.</p>
<p>So this is one of the,</p>
<p>and supersymmetry&rsquo;s also got lots of other things</p>
<p>going for it.</p>
<p>It predicts the existence of a dark matter particle,</p>
<p>which would be great.</p>
<p>It potentially suggests that the strong force</p>
<p>and the electroweak force unify at high energy.</p>
<p>So lots of reasons people thought this was a productive idea.</p>
<p>And when the LHC was, just before it was turned on,</p>
<p>there was a lot of hype, I guess,</p>
<p>a lot of an expectation that we would discover</p>
<p>these super partners because,</p>
<p>and particularly the main reason was</p>
<p>that if supersymmetry stabilizes the Higgs field</p>
<p>at this nice Goldilocks value,</p>
<p>these super particles should have a mass</p>
<p>around the energy that we&rsquo;re probing at the LHC,</p>
<p>around the energy of the Higgs.</p>
<p>So it was kind of thought, you discover the Higgs,</p>
<p>you probably discover super partners as well.</p>
<p>So once you start creating ripples in this Higgs field,</p>
<p>you should be able to see these kinds of,</p>
<p>you should be, yeah.</p>
<p>So the super fields would be there.</p>
<p>When I, at the very beginning I said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re probing the vacuum.</p>
<p>What I mean is really that, you know,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s say these super fields exist.</p>
<p>The vacuum contains super fields.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there, these supersymmetric fields.</p>
<p>If we hit them hard enough, we can make them vibrate.</p>
<p>We see super particles come flying out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sort of, that&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>But we haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So, so far at least, I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had now a decade of data taking at the LHC.</p>
<p>No signs of super partners have,</p>
<p>supersymmetric particles have been found.</p>
<p>In fact, no signs of any physics, any new particles</p>
<p>beyond the Standard Model have been found.</p>
<p>So supersymmetry is not the only thing that can do this.</p>
<p>There are other theories that involve</p>
<p>additional dimensions of space</p>
<p>or potentially involve the Higgs boson</p>
<p>being made of smaller things,</p>
<p>being made of other particles.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s an interesting, you know,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard that before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, that&rsquo;s an interesting,</p>
<p>but can you maybe linger on that?</p>
<p>Like what, what could be,</p>
<p>what could the Higgs particle be made of?</p>
<p>Well, so the oldest, I think the original ideas about this</p>
<p>was these theories called technicolor,</p>
<p>which were basically like an analogy with the strong force.</p>
<p>So the idea was the Higgs boson was a bound state</p>
<p>of two very strongly interacting particles</p>
<p>that were a bit like quarks.</p>
<p>So like quarks, but I guess higher energy things</p>
<p>with a super strong force.</p>
<p>So not the strong force, but a new force</p>
<p>that was very strong.</p>
<p>And the Higgs was a bound state of these, these objects.</p>
<p>And the Higgs would in principle, if that was right,</p>
<p>would be the first in a series of technicolor particles.</p>
<p>Technicolor, I think not being a theorist,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s basically not done very well,</p>
<p>particularly since the LHC found the Higgs,</p>
<p>that kind of, it rules out, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of these technicolor theories,</p>
<p>but there are other things that are a bit like technicolor.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a theory called partial composite,</p>
<p>which is an idea that some of my colleagues</p>
<p>at Cambridge have worked on,</p>
<p>which is a similar sort of idea that the Higgs</p>
<p>is a bound state of some strongly interacting particles,</p>
<p>and that the standard model particles themselves,</p>
<p>the more exotic ones like the top quark</p>
<p>are also sort of mixtures of these composite particles.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a kind of an extension to the standard model,</p>
<p>which explains this problem</p>
<p>with the Higgs bosons, Goldilocks value,</p>
<p>but also helps us understand we have,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a situation now, again,</p>
<p>a bit like the periodic table,</p>
<p>where we have six quarks, six leptons in this kind of,</p>
<p>you can arrange in this nice table</p>
<p>and you can see these columns where the patterns repeat</p>
<p>and you go, okay, maybe there&rsquo;s something deeper</p>
<p>going on here, you know,</p>
<p>and so this would potentially be something,</p>
<p>this partial composite theory could explain,</p>
<p>a sort of enlarge this picture</p>
<p>that allows us to see the whole symmetrical pattern</p>
<p>and understand what the ingredients, why do we have,</p>
<p>so one of the big questions in particle physics is,</p>
<p>why are there three copies of the matter particles?</p>
<p>So in what we call the first generation,</p>
<p>which is what we&rsquo;re made of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the electron, the electron neutrino,</p>
<p>the up quark and the down quark,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the most common matter particles in the universe,</p>
<p>but then there are copies of these four particles</p>
<p>in the second and the third generations,</p>
<p>so things like nuons and top quarks and other stuff,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know why, we see these patterns,</p>
<p>we have no idea where it comes from,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s another big question, you know,</p>
<p>can we find out the deeper order that explains</p>
<p>this particular periodic table of particles that we see?</p>
<p>Is it possible that the deeper order includes</p>
<p>like almost a single entity,</p>
<p>so like something that I guess like string theory</p>
<p>dreams about, is this essentially the dream,</p>
<p>is to discover something simple, beautiful and unifying?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that is the dream,</p>
<p>and I think for some people, for a lot of people,</p>
<p>it still is the dream,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a great book by Steven Weinberg,</p>
<p>who is one of the theoretical physicists</p>
<p>who was instrumental in building the Standard Model,</p>
<p>so he came up with some others with the electroweak theory,</p>
<p>the theory that unified electromagnetism and the weak force,</p>
<p>and he wrote this book,</p>
<p>I think it was towards the end of the 80s, early 90s,</p>
<p>called Dreams of a Final Theory,</p>
<p>which is a very lovely, quite short book</p>
<p>about this idea of a final unifying theory</p>
<p>that brings everything together,</p>
<p>and I think you get a sense reading his book</p>
<p>written at the end of the 80s, early 90s,</p>
<p>that there was this feeling that such a theory was coming,</p>
<p>and that was the time when string theory</p>
<p>was very exciting, so string theory,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been this thing called the superstring revolution,</p>
<p>and theoretical physicists were very excited,</p>
<p>they discovered these theoretical objects,</p>
<p>these little vibrating loops of string</p>
<p>that in principle not only was a quantum theory of gravity</p>
<p>but could explain all the particles in the Standard Model</p>
<p>and bring it all together,</p>
<p>and as you say, you have one object, the string,</p>
<p>and you can pluck it, and the way it vibrates</p>
<p>gives you these different notes,</p>
<p>each of which is a different particle,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a very lovely idea,</p>
<p>but the problem is that, well, there&rsquo;s a few,</p>
<p>people discover that mathematics is very difficult,</p>
<p>so people have spent three decades or more</p>
<p>trying to understand string theory,</p>
<p>and I think if you spoke to most string theorists,</p>
<p>they would probably freely admit</p>
<p>that no one really knows what string theory is yet,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s been a lot of work,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really understood,</p>
<p>and the other problem is that string theory</p>
<p>mostly makes predictions about physics</p>
<p>that occurs at energies far beyond</p>
<p>what we will ever be able to probe in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Yeah, probably ever.</p>
<p>By the way, so sorry to take a million tangents,</p>
<p>but is there room for complete innovation</p>
<p>of how to build a particle collider</p>
<p>that could give us an order of magnitude increase</p>
<p>in the kind of energies,</p>
<p>or do we need to keep just increasing the size of things?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe, yeah, I mean, there are ideas,</p>
<p>to give you a sense of the gulf that has to be bridged.</p>
<p>So the LHC collides particles at an energy</p>
<p>of what we call 14 tera electron volts,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s basically the equivalent</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve accelerated a proton through 14 trillion volts.</p>
<p>That gets us to the energies</p>
<p>where the Higgs and these weak particles live.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very massive.</p>
<p>The scale where strings become manifest</p>
<p>is something called the Planck scale,</p>
<p>which I think is of the order 10 to the,</p>
<p>hang on, get this right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 10 to the 18 giga electron volts,</p>
<p>so about 10 to the 15 tera electron volts.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking trillions of times more energy.</p>
<p>Yeah, 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 14th larger, I don&rsquo;t even.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s of that order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very big number.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking just an order</p>
<p>of magnitude increase in energy,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking 14 orders of magnitude energy increase.</p>
<p>So to give you a sense of what that would look like,</p>
<p>were you to build a particle accelerator</p>
<p>with today&rsquo;s technology.</p>
<p>Bigger or smaller than our solar system?</p>
<p>The size of the galaxy.</p>
<p>The galaxy.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d need to put a particle accelerator</p>
<p>that circled the Milky Way to get to the energies</p>
<p>where you would see strings if they exist.</p>
<p>So that is a fundamental problem,</p>
<p>which is that most of the predictions</p>
<p>of these unified theories, quantum theories of gravity,</p>
<p>only make statements that are testable at energies</p>
<p>that we will not be able to probe,</p>
<p>and barring some unbelievable,</p>
<p>completely unexpected technological</p>
<p>or scientific breakthrough,</p>
<p>which is almost impossible to imagine.</p>
<p>You never say never, but it seems very unlikely.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can just see the news story.</p>
<p>Elon Musk decides to build a particle collider</p>
<p>the size of our galaxy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d have to get together</p>
<p>with all our galactic neighbors to pay for it, I think.</p>
<p>What is the exciting possibilities</p>
<p>of the Large Hadron Collider?</p>
<p>What is there to be discovered</p>
<p>in this order of magnitude of scale?</p>
<p>Is there other bigger efforts on the horizon in this space?</p>
<p>What are the open problems, the exciting possibilities?</p>
<p>You mentioned supersymmetry.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, well, there are lots of new ideas.</p>
<p>Well, there are lots of problems that we&rsquo;re facing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a problem with the Higgs field,</p>
<p>which supersymmetry was supposed to solve.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the fact that 95% of the universe</p>
<p>we know from cosmology, astrophysics, is invisible,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s made of dark matter and dark energy,</p>
<p>which are really just words</p>
<p>for things that we don&rsquo;t know what they are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what Donald Rumsfeld called a known unknown.</p>
<p>So we know we don&rsquo;t know what they are.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s better than unknown unknown.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, there may be some unknown unknowns,</p>
<p>but by definition we don&rsquo;t know what those are, so, yeah.</p>
<p>But the hope is a particle accelerator</p>
<p>could help us make sense of dark energy, dark matter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still, there&rsquo;s some hope for that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s hope for that, yeah.</p>
<p>So one of the hopes is the LHC could produce</p>
<p>a dark matter particle in its collisions.</p>
<p>And it may be that the LHC</p>
<p>will still discover new particles,</p>
<p>that it might still, supersymmetry could still be there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just maybe more difficult to find</p>
<p>than we thought originally.</p>
<p>And dark matter particles might be being produced,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re just not looking in the right part of the data</p>
<p>for them, that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It might be that we need more data,</p>
<p>that these processes are very rare</p>
<p>and we need to collect lots and lots of data</p>
<p>before we see them.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of people would say now</p>
<p>that the chances of the LHC</p>
<p>directly discovering new particles</p>
<p>in the near future is quite slim.</p>
<p>It may be that we need a decade more data</p>
<p>before we can see something, or we may not see anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>So, I mean, the physics, the experiments that I work on,</p>
<p>so I work on a detector called LHCb,</p>
<p>which is one of these four big detectors</p>
<p>that are spaced around the ring.</p>
<p>And we do slightly different stuff to the big guys.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two big experiments called Atlas and CMS,</p>
<p>3000 physicists and scientists</p>
<p>and computer scientists on them each.</p>
<p>They are the ones that discovered the Higgs</p>
<p>and they look for supersymmetry and dark matter and so on.</p>
<p>What we look at are standard model particles</p>
<p>called bequarks, which depending on your preferences,</p>
<p>either bottom or beauty,</p>
<p>we tend to say beauty because it sounds sexier.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>But these particles are interesting</p>
<p>because they have, we can make lots of them.</p>
<p>We make billions or hundreds of billions of these things.</p>
<p>You can therefore measure their properties very precisely.</p>
<p>So you can make these really lovely precision measurements.</p>
<p>And what we are doing really is a sort of complimentary thing</p>
<p>to the other big experiments, which is they,</p>
<p>if you think of the sort of analogy they often use is,</p>
<p>if you imagine you&rsquo;re looking in, you&rsquo;re in the jungle</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking for an elephant, say,</p>
<p>and you are a hunter and you&rsquo;re kind of like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s the relevance, very rare.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know where in the jungle, the jungle&rsquo;s big.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two ways you go about this.</p>
<p>Either you can go wandering around the jungle</p>
<p>and try and find the elephant.</p>
<p>The problem is if the elephant,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s only one elephant and the jungle&rsquo;s big,</p>
<p>the chances of running into it are very small.</p>
<p>Or you could look on the ground</p>
<p>and see if you see footprints left by the elephant.</p>
<p>And if the elephant&rsquo;s moving around, you&rsquo;ve got a chance,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re better chance maybe</p>
<p>of seeing the elephant&rsquo;s footprints.</p>
<p>If you see the footprints, you go, okay, there&rsquo;s an elephant.</p>
<p>I maybe don&rsquo;t know what kind of elephant it is,</p>
<p>but I got a sense there&rsquo;s something out there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of what we do.</p>
<p>We are the footprint people.</p>
<p>We are, we&rsquo;re looking for the footprints,</p>
<p>the impressions that quantum fields</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t managed to directly create the particle of,</p>
<p>the effects these quantum fields have</p>
<p>on the ordinary standard model fields</p>
<p>that we already know about.</p>
<p>So these B particles, the way they behave</p>
<p>can be influenced by the presence of say,</p>
<p>super fields or dark matter fields or whatever you like.</p>
<p>And the way they decay and behave can be altered slightly</p>
<p>from what our theory tells us they ought to behave.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easier to collect huge amounts of data</p>
<p>on B quarks.</p>
<p>We get billions and billions of these things.</p>
<p>You can make very precise measurements.</p>
<p>And the only place really at the LHC</p>
<p>or really in high energy physics at the moment</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s fairly compelling evidence</p>
<p>that there might be something beyond the standard model</p>
<p>is in these B, these beauty quarks decays.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, which is the difference</p>
<p>between the different, the four experiments,</p>
<p>for example, that you mentioned,</p>
<p>is it the kind of particles that are being collided?</p>
<p>Is it the energies which they&rsquo;re collided?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the fundamental difference</p>
<p>between the different experiments?</p>
<p>The collisions are the same.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s different is the design of the detectors.</p>
<p>So Atlas and CMS are called,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called what are called general purpose detectors.</p>
<p>And they are basically barrel shaped machines</p>
<p>and the collisions happen in the middle of the barrel</p>
<p>and the barrel captures all the particles</p>
<p>that go flying out in every direction.</p>
<p>So in a sphere effectively that can fly out</p>
<p>and it can record all of those particles.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the, sorry to be interrupting,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s the mechanism of the recording?</p>
<p>Oh, so these detectors, if you&rsquo;ve seen pictures of them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re huge, like Atlas is 25 meters high</p>
<p>and 45 meters long, they&rsquo;re vast machines,</p>
<p>instruments, I guess you should call them really.</p>
<p>They are, they&rsquo;re kind of like onions.</p>
<p>So they have layers, concentric layers of detectors,</p>
<p>different sorts of detectors.</p>
<p>So close into the beam pipe,</p>
<p>you have what are called usually made of silicon,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re tracking detectors.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re little made of strips of silicon</p>
<p>or pixels of silicon.</p>
<p>And when a particle goes through the silicon,</p>
<p>it gives a little electrical signal</p>
<p>and you get these dots, electrical dots</p>
<p>through your detector, which allows you</p>
<p>to reconstruct the trajectory of the particle.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the middle</p>
<p>and then the outsides of these detectors,</p>
<p>you have things called calorimeters,</p>
<p>which measure the energies of the particles</p>
<p>and the very edge you have things called muon chambers,</p>
<p>which basically these muon particles,</p>
<p>which are the heavy version of the electron,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like high velocity bullets</p>
<p>and they can get right to the edge of the detectors.</p>
<p>If you see something at the edge, that&rsquo;s a muon.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s broadly how they work.</p>
<p>And all of that is being recorded.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all being fed out to, you know, computers.</p>
<p>Data must be awesome, okay.</p>
<p>So LHCb is different.</p>
<p>So we, because we&rsquo;re looking for these be quarks,</p>
<p>be quarks tend to be produced along the beam line.</p>
<p>So in a collision, the be quark tend to fly</p>
<p>sort of close to the beam pipe.</p>
<p>So we built a detector that sort of pyramid cone shaped</p>
<p>basically, that just looks in one direction.</p>
<p>So we ignore, if you have your collision,</p>
<p>stuff goes everywhere.</p>
<p>We ignore all the stuff over here and going off sideways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just looking in this little region</p>
<p>close to the beam pipe</p>
<p>where most of these be quarks are made.</p>
<p>So is there a different aspect of the sensors involved</p>
<p>in the collection of the be quark trajectories?</p>
<p>There are some differences.</p>
<p>So one of the differences is that,</p>
<p>one of the ways you know you&rsquo;ve seen a be quark</p>
<p>is that be quarks are actually quite long lived</p>
<p>by particle standards.</p>
<p>So they live for 1.5 trillionths of a second,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re a fundamental particle</p>
<p>is a very long time.</p>
<p>Cause the Higgs boson, I think lives for about</p>
<p>a trillionth of a trillionth of a second,</p>
<p>or maybe even less than that.</p>
<p>So these are quite long lived things</p>
<p>and they will actually fly a little distance</p>
<p>before they decay.</p>
<p>So they will fly a few centimeters maybe if you&rsquo;re lucky,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll decay into other stuff.</p>
<p>So what we need to do in the middle of the detector,</p>
<p>you wanna be able to see,</p>
<p>you have your place where the protons crash into each other</p>
<p>and that produces loads of particles that come flying out.</p>
<p>So you have loads of lines, loads of tracks</p>
<p>that point back to that proton collision.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re looking for a couple of other tracks,</p>
<p>maybe two or three that point back to a different place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s maybe a few centimeters away</p>
<p>from the proton collision.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the sign that a little B particle has flown</p>
<p>a few centimeters and decayed somewhere else.</p>
<p>So we need to be able to very accurately resolve</p>
<p>the proton collision from the B particle decay.</p>
<p>So the middle of our detector is very sensitive</p>
<p>and it gets very close to the collision.</p>
<p>So you have this really beautiful delicate</p>
<p>silicon detector that sits,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s seven millimeters from the beam.</p>
<p>And the LHC beam has as much energy</p>
<p>as a jumbo jet at takeoff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s enough to melt a ton of copper.</p>
<p>So you have this furiously powerful thing sitting next</p>
<p>to this tiny delicate silicon sensor.</p>
<p>So those aspects of our detector that are specialized</p>
<p>to measure these particular B quarks</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>And is there, I mean, I remember seeing somewhere</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some mention of matter and antimatter</p>
<p>connected to the B, these beautiful quarks.</p>
<p>Is that, what&rsquo;s the connection?</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s the connection there?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there is a connection, which is that</p>
<p>when you produce these B particles,</p>
<p>these particles, because you don&rsquo;t see the B quark,</p>
<p>you see the thing that B quark is inside.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re bound up inside what we call beauty particles,</p>
<p>where the B quark is joined together with another quark</p>
<p>or two, maybe two other quarks, depending on what it is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a particular set of these B particles</p>
<p>that exhibit this property called oscillation.</p>
<p>So if you make a, for the sake of argument,</p>
<p>a matter version of one of these B particles,</p>
<p>as it travels, because of the magic of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>it oscillates backwards and forwards</p>
<p>between its matter and antimatter versions.</p>
<p>So it does this weird flipping about backwards and forwards.</p>
<p>And what we can use this for is a laboratory</p>
<p>for testing the symmetry between matter and antimatter.</p>
<p>So if the symmetry between antimatter is precise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exact, then we should see these B particles decaying</p>
<p>as often as matter, as they do as antimatter,</p>
<p>because this oscillation should be even.</p>
<p>It should spend as much time in each state.</p>
<p>But what we actually see is that one of the states,</p>
<p>it spends more time and it&rsquo;s more likely to decay</p>
<p>in one state than the other.</p>
<p>So this gives us a way of testing this fundamental symmetry</p>
<p>between matter and antimatter.</p>
<p>So what can you, sort of returning to the question</p>
<p>before about this fundamental symmetry,</p>
<p>it seems like if there&rsquo;s perfect symmetry</p>
<p>between matter and antimatter,</p>
<p>if we have the equal amount of each in our universe,</p>
<p>it would just destroy itself.</p>
<p>And just like you mentioned,</p>
<p>we seem to live in a very unlikely universe</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t destroy itself.</p>
<p>So do you have some intuition about why that is?</p>
<p>I mean, well, I&rsquo;m not a theorist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any particular ideas myself.</p>
<p>I mean, I sort of do measurements</p>
<p>to try and test these things,</p>
<p>but I mean, so the terms of the basic problem</p>
<p>is that in the Big Bang,</p>
<p>if you use the standard model to figure out</p>
<p>what ought to have happened,</p>
<p>you should have got equal amounts of matter</p>
<p>and antimatter made,</p>
<p>because whenever you make a particle</p>
<p>in our collisions, for example,</p>
<p>when we collide stuff together,</p>
<p>you make a particle, you make an antiparticle.</p>
<p>They always come together.</p>
<p>They always annihilate together.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no way of making more matter than antimatter</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve discovered so far.</p>
<p>So that means in the Big Bang,</p>
<p>you get equal amounts of matter and antimatter.</p>
<p>As the universe expands and cools down during the Big Bang,</p>
<p>not very long after the Big Bang,</p>
<p>I think a few seconds after the Big Bang,</p>
<p>you have this event called the Great Annihilation,</p>
<p>which is where all the particles and antiparticles</p>
<p>smack into each other, annihilate, turn into light mostly,</p>
<p>and you end up with a universe later on.</p>
<p>If that was what happened,</p>
<p>then the universe we live in today would be black and empty,</p>
<p>apart from some photons, that would be it.</p>
<p>So there is stuff in the universe.</p>
<p>It appears to be just made of matter.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this big mystery as to how did this happen?</p>
<p>And there are various ideas,</p>
<p>which all involve sort of physics going on</p>
<p>in the first trillionth of a second or so of the Big Bang.</p>
<p>So it could be that one possibility</p>
<p>is that the Higgs field is somehow implicated in this,</p>
<p>that there was this event that took place</p>
<p>in the early universe where the Higgs field</p>
<p>basically switched on, it acquired its modern value.</p>
<p>And when that happened,</p>
<p>this caused all the particles to acquire mass</p>
<p>and the universe basically went through a phase transition</p>
<p>where you had a hot plasma of massless particles.</p>
<p>And then in that plasma,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a gas turning into droplets of water.</p>
<p>You get kind of these little bubbles forming in the universe</p>
<p>where the Higgs field has acquired its modern value,</p>
<p>the particles have got mass.</p>
<p>And this phase transition in some models</p>
<p>can cause more matter than antimatter to be produced,</p>
<p>depending on how matter bounces off these bubbles</p>
<p>in the early universe.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one idea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other ideas to do with neutrinos,</p>
<p>that there are exotic types of neutrinos</p>
<p>that can decay in a biased way to just matter</p>
<p>and not to antimatter.</p>
<p>So, and people are trying to test these ideas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to do at LHCb.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s neutrino experiments planned</p>
<p>that are trying to do these sorts of things as well.</p>
<p>So yeah, there are ideas, but at the moment,</p>
<p>no clear evidence for which of these ideas might be right.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about some incredible ideas.</p>
<p>By the way, never heard anyone be so eloquent</p>
<p>about describing even just the standard model.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in awe just listening.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, just having fun enjoying it.</p>
<p>So the, yes, the theoretical,</p>
<p>the particle physics is fascinating here.</p>
<p>To me, one of the most fascinating things</p>
<p>about the Large Hadron Collider is the human side of it.</p>
<p>That a bunch of sort of brilliant people</p>
<p>that probably have egos got together</p>
<p>and were collaborate together and countries,</p>
<p>I guess, collaborate together for the funds</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s just collaboration everywhere.</p>
<p>Cause you may be, I don&rsquo;t know what the right question here</p>
<p>to ask, but almost what&rsquo;s your intuition</p>
<p>about how it was possible to make this happen</p>
<p>and what are the lessons we should learn</p>
<p>for the future of human civilization</p>
<p>in terms of our scientific progress?</p>
<p>Cause it seems like this is a great, great illustration</p>
<p>of us working together to do something big.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s possibly the best example.</p>
<p>Maybe I can think of international collaboration</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t for some unpleasant purpose, basically.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, so when I started out in the field</p>
<p>in 2008 as a new PhD student,</p>
<p>the LHC was basically finished.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t have to go around asking for money for it</p>
<p>or trying to make the case.</p>
<p>So I have huge admiration for the people who managed that.</p>
<p>Cause this was a project that was first imagined</p>
<p>in the 1970s, in the late 70s</p>
<p>was when the first conversations about the LHC were mooted</p>
<p>and it took two and a half decades of campaigning</p>
<p>and fundraising and persuasion</p>
<p>until they started breaking ground</p>
<p>and building the thing in the early noughties in 2000.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think the reason just from a sort of,</p>
<p>from the point of view of the sort of science,</p>
<p>the scientists there,</p>
<p>I think the reason it works ultimately</p>
<p>is that everywhere, everyone there is there</p>
<p>for the same reason, which is, well, in principle, at least</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re there because they&rsquo;re interested in the world.</p>
<p>They want to find out, you know,</p>
<p>what are the basic ingredients of our universe?</p>
<p>What are the laws of nature?</p>
<p>And so everyone is pulling in the same direction.</p>
<p>Now, of course, everyone has their own</p>
<p>things they&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own careers to consider.</p>
<p>And, you know, I wouldn&rsquo;t pretend that</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t also a lot of competition.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this funny thing in these experiments</p>
<p>where your collaborators,</p>
<p>your 800 collaborators in LHCb,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also competitors</p>
<p>because your academics in your various universities</p>
<p>and you want to be the one that gets the paper out</p>
<p>on the most exciting, you know, new measurements.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this funny thing where you&rsquo;re kind of trying</p>
<p>to stake out your territory while also collaborating</p>
<p>and having to work together to make the experiments work.</p>
<p>And it does work amazingly well,</p>
<p>actually considering all of that.</p>
<p>And I think there was actually,</p>
<p>I think McKinsey or one of these big management</p>
<p>consultancy firms went into CERN maybe a decade or so ago</p>
<p>to try to understand how these organizations function.</p>
<p>Did they figure it out?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they could.</p>
<p>I mean, I think one of the things that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>one of the other interesting things</p>
<p>about these experiments is, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re big operations like say Atlas has 3000 people.</p>
<p>Now there was a person nominally</p>
<p>who was the head of Atlas, they&rsquo;re called the spokesperson.</p>
<p>And the spokesperson is elected by,</p>
<p>usually by the collaboration,</p>
<p>but they have no actual power really.</p>
<p>I mean, they can&rsquo;t fire anyone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not anyone&rsquo;s boss.</p>
<p>So, you know, my boss is a professor at Cambridge,</p>
<p>not the head of my experiments.</p>
<p>The head of my experiment can&rsquo;t tell me what to do really.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all these independent academics</p>
<p>who are their own bosses who, you know,</p>
<p>so that somehow it, nonetheless,</p>
<p>by kind of consensus and discussion and lots of meetings,</p>
<p>these things do happen and it does get done, but.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the queen here in the UK is the spokesperson.</p>
<p>I guess so.</p>
<p>No actual power. Except we don&rsquo;t elect her, no.</p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t elect her.</p>
<p>But everybody seems to love her.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, from my outside perspective.</p>
<p>But yeah, giant egos, brilliant people.</p>
<p>And moving forward, do you think there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Actually, I would pick up one thing you said just there,</p>
<p>just the brilliant people thing.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m not saying that people aren&rsquo;t great.</p>
<p>But I think there is this sort of impression</p>
<p>that physicists all have to be brilliant or geniuses,</p>
<p>which is not true actually.</p>
<p>And you know, you have to be relatively bright for sure.</p>
<p>But you know, a lot of people,</p>
<p>a lot of the most successful experimental physicists</p>
<p>are not necessarily the people with the biggest brains.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the people who, you know,</p>
<p>particularly one of the skills that&rsquo;s most important</p>
<p>in particle physics is the ability to work</p>
<p>with others and to collaborate and exchange ideas</p>
<p>and also to work hard.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a sort of, often it&rsquo;s more a determination</p>
<p>or a sort of other set of skills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just being, you know, kind of some great brain.</p>
<p>Very true.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s parallels to that</p>
<p>in the machine learning world.</p>
<p>If you wanna solve any real world problems,</p>
<p>which I see as the particle accelerators,</p>
<p>essentially a real world instantiation</p>
<p>of theoretical physics.</p>
<p>And for that, you have to not necessarily be brilliant,</p>
<p>but be sort of obsessed, systematic, rigorous,</p>
<p>sort of unborable, stubborn, all those kind of qualities</p>
<p>that make for a great engineer.</p>
<p>So, scientists purely speaking,</p>
<p>that practitioner of the scientific method.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, to me that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>My dad&rsquo;s a physicist.</p>
<p>I argue with him all the time.</p>
<p>To me, engineering is the highest form of science.</p>
<p>And he thinks that&rsquo;s all nonsense,</p>
<p>that the real work is done by the theoretician.</p>
<p>So, in fact, we have arguments about like people</p>
<p>like Elon Musk, for example,</p>
<p>because I think his work is quite brilliant,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s fundamentally not coming up</p>
<p>with any serious breakthroughs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just creating in this world, implementing,</p>
<p>like making ideas happen that have a huge impact.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s the Edison.</p>
<p>That to me is a brilliant work,</p>
<p>but to him, it&rsquo;s messy details</p>
<p>that somebody will figure out anyway.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know whether you think</p>
<p>there is a actual difference in temperament</p>
<p>between say a physicist and an engineer,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s just what you got interested in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of what experimental physicists do</p>
<p>is to some extent engineering.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not what I do.</p>
<p>I mostly do data stuff,</p>
<p>but a lot of people would be called electrical engineers,</p>
<p>but they trained as physicists,</p>
<p>but they learned electrical engineering, for example,</p>
<p>because they were building detectors.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s not such a clear divide, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, but there does seem to be,</p>
<p>like you work with data.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a certain,</p>
<p>like I love data collection.</p>
<p>There might be an OCD element or something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re more naturally predisposed to</p>
<p>as opposed to theory.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not afraid of data.</p>
<p>I love data.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of people in machine learning</p>
<p>who are more like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically afraid of data collection,</p>
<p>afraid of data sets, afraid of all of that.</p>
<p>They just want to stay in more than theoretical</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really good at it, space.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the genetic,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your upbringing, the way you go to school,</p>
<p>but looking into the future of LHC and other colliders.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s in America,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s whatever it was called, the super,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of super.</p>
<p>Superconducting super colliders.</p>
<p>Yeah, superconducting.</p>
<p>The desertron, yeah.</p>
<p>Desertron, yeah.</p>
<p>So, that was canceled, the construction of that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is a sad thing,</p>
<p>but what do you think is the future of these efforts?</p>
<p>Will a bigger collider be built?</p>
<p>Will LHC be expanded?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Well, in the near future, the LHC is gonna get an upgrade.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s pretty much confirmed.</p>
<p>I think it is confirmed, which is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an energy upgrade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we call a luminosity upgrade.</p>
<p>So, it basically means increasing</p>
<p>the data collection rates.</p>
<p>So, more collisions per second, basically,</p>
<p>because after a few years of data taking,</p>
<p>you get this law of diminishing returns</p>
<p>where each year&rsquo;s worth of data</p>
<p>is a smaller and smaller fraction</p>
<p>of the lot you&rsquo;ve already got.</p>
<p>So, to get a real improvement in sensitivity,</p>
<p>you need to increase the data rate</p>
<p>by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s what this upgrade is gonna do.</p>
<p>LHCb, at the moment, the whole detector</p>
<p>is basically being rebuilt to allow it to record data</p>
<p>at a much larger rate than we could before.</p>
<p>So, that will make us sensitive</p>
<p>to whole loads of new processes</p>
<p>that we weren&rsquo;t able to study before.</p>
<p>And I mentioned briefly these anomalies that we&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve seen a bunch of very intriguing anomalies</p>
<p>in these b quark decays,</p>
<p>which may be hinting at the first signs</p>
<p>of this kind of the elephant,</p>
<p>the signs of some new quantum field</p>
<p>or fields maybe beyond the standard model.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not yet at the statistical threshold</p>
<p>where you can say that you&rsquo;ve observed something,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s lots of anomalies in many measurements</p>
<p>that all seem to be consistent with each other.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s quite interesting.</p>
<p>So, the upgrade will allow us</p>
<p>to really home in on these things</p>
<p>and see whether these anomalies are real,</p>
<p>because if they are real,</p>
<p>and this kind of connects to your point</p>
<p>about the next generation of machines,</p>
<p>what we would have seen then is,</p>
<p>we would have seen the tail end of some quantum field</p>
<p>in influencing these b quarks.</p>
<p>What we then need to do is to build a bigger collider</p>
<p>to actually make the particle of that field.</p>
<p>So, if these things really do exist.</p>
<p>So, that would be one argument.</p>
<p>I mean, so at the moment,</p>
<p>Europe is going through this process</p>
<p>of thinking about the strategy for the future.</p>
<p>So, there are a number of different proposals on the table.</p>
<p>One is for a sort of higher energy upgrade of the LHC,</p>
<p>where you just build more powerful magnets</p>
<p>and put them in the same tunnel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sort of cheaper, less ambitious possibility.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t really like it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s sort of a bit of a dead end,</p>
<p>because once you&rsquo;ve done that, there&rsquo;s nowhere to go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a machine called Click,</p>
<p>which is a compact linear collider,</p>
<p>which is a electron positron collider</p>
<p>that uses a novel type of acceleration technology</p>
<p>to accelerate at shorter distances.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still talking kilometers long,</p>
<p>but not like 100 kilometers long.</p>
<p>And then probably the project that is,</p>
<p>I think getting the most support,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be interesting to see what happens,</p>
<p>something called the Future Circular Collider,</p>
<p>which is a really ambitious longterm multi decade project</p>
<p>to build a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel</p>
<p>under the Geneva region.</p>
<p>The LHC would become a kind of feeding machine.</p>
<p>It would just feed.</p>
<p>So the same area, so it would be a feeder for the.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it would kind of, the edge of this machine</p>
<p>would be where the LHC is,</p>
<p>but it would sort of go under Lake Geneva</p>
<p>and round to the Alps, basically,</p>
<p>up to the edge of the Geneva basin.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically the biggest tunnel you can fit</p>
<p>in the region based on the geology.</p>
<p>100 kilometers.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a long drive if your experiment&rsquo;s on one side.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to go back to CERN for lunch,</p>
<p>so that would be a pain.</p>
<p>But you know, so this project is,</p>
<p>in principle, it&rsquo;s actually two accelerators.</p>
<p>The first thing you would do</p>
<p>is put an electron positron machine</p>
<p>in the 100 kilometer tunnel to study the Higgs.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d make lots of Higgs bows</p>
<p>and study it really precisely</p>
<p>in the hope that you see it misbehaving</p>
<p>and doing something it&rsquo;s not supposed to.</p>
<p>And then in the much longer term,</p>
<p>100, that machine gets taken out,</p>
<p>you put in a proton proton machine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the LHC, but much bigger.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way you start going</p>
<p>and looking for dark matter,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re trying to recreate this phase transition</p>
<p>that I talked about in the early universe,</p>
<p>where you can see matter anti matter being made,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of things you can do with these machines.</p>
<p>The problem is that they will take,</p>
<p>you know, the most optimistic,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna have any data</p>
<p>from any of these machines until 2040,</p>
<p>or, you know, because they take such a long time to build</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re so expensive.</p>
<p>So you have, there&rsquo;ll be a process of R&amp;D design,</p>
<p>but also the political case being made.</p>
<p>So LHC, what costs a few billion?</p>
<p>Depends how you count it.</p>
<p>I think most of the sort of more reasonable estimates</p>
<p>that take everything into account properly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s around the sort of 10, 11, 12 billion euro mark.</p>
<p>What would be the future, sorry,</p>
<p>I forgot the name already.</p>
<p>Future Circular Collider.</p>
<p>Presumably they won&rsquo;t call it that when it&rsquo;s built,</p>
<p>cause it won&rsquo;t be the future anymore.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ll call it then.</p>
<p>The very big Hadron Collider, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But that will, now I should know the numbers,</p>
<p>but I think the whole project is estimated</p>
<p>at about 30 billion euros,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s money spent over between now and 2070 probably,</p>
<p>which is when the last bit of it</p>
<p>would be sort of finishing up, I guess.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking a half a century of science</p>
<p>coming out of this thing, shared by many countries.</p>
<p>So the actual cost, the arguments that are made</p>
<p>is that you could make this project fit</p>
<p>within the existing budget of CERN,</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t do anything else.</p>
<p>And CERN, by the way, we didn&rsquo;t mention, what is CERN?</p>
<p>CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an international organization</p>
<p>that was established in the 1950s</p>
<p>in the wake of the second world war as a kind of,</p>
<p>it was sort of like a scientific Marshall plan for Europe.</p>
<p>The idea was that you bring European science back together</p>
<p>for peaceful purposes,</p>
<p>because what happened in the forties was,</p>
<p>a lot of particular Jewish scientists,</p>
<p>but a lot of scientists from central Europe</p>
<p>had fled to the United States</p>
<p>and Europe had sort of seen this brain drain.</p>
<p>So there was a desire to bring the community back together</p>
<p>for a project that wasn&rsquo;t building nasty bombs,</p>
<p>but was doing something that was curiosity driven.</p>
<p>So, and that has continued since then.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a unique organization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you, to be a member as a country,</p>
<p>you sort of sign up as a member</p>
<p>and then you have to pay a fraction of your GDP</p>
<p>each year as a subscription.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a very small fraction, relatively speaking.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like, I think the UK&rsquo;s contribution</p>
<p>is a hundred or 200 million quid or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is quite a lot, but not so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, just the whole thing that is possible,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful idea,</p>
<p>especially when there&rsquo;s no wars on the line,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re freaking out,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re actually legitimately collaborating</p>
<p>to do good science.</p>
<p>One of the things I don&rsquo;t think we really mentioned</p>
<p>is on the final side, that sort of the data analysis side,</p>
<p>is there breakthroughs possible there</p>
<p>and the machine learning side,</p>
<p>like is there a lot more signal to be mined</p>
<p>in more effective ways from the actual raw data?</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of people are looking into that.</p>
<p>I mean, so I use machine learning in my data analysis,</p>
<p>but pretty naughty, basic stuff,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m not a machine learning expert.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a physicist who had to learn to do this stuff</p>
<p>for my day job.</p>
<p>So what a lot of people do is they use</p>
<p>kind of off the shelf packages</p>
<p>that you can train to do signal noise.</p>
<p>Just clean up all the data.</p>
<p>But one of the big challenges,</p>
<p>the big challenge of the data is A, it&rsquo;s volume,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s huge amounts of data.</p>
<p>So the LHC generates, now, okay,</p>
<p>I try to remember what the actual numbers are,</p>
<p>but if you, we don&rsquo;t record all our data,</p>
<p>we record a tiny fraction of the data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like of order one 10,000th or something, I think.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Around that.</p>
<p>So most of it gets thrown away.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t record all the LHC data</p>
<p>cause it would fill up every computer in the world</p>
<p>in a matter of days, basically.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this process that happens on live,</p>
<p>on the detector, something called a trigger,</p>
<p>which in real time, 40 million times every second</p>
<p>has to make a decision about whether this collision</p>
<p>is likely to contain an interesting object,</p>
<p>like a Higgs boson or a dark matter particle.</p>
<p>And it has to do that very fast.</p>
<p>And the software algorithms in the past</p>
<p>were quite relatively basic.</p>
<p>They did things like measure mementos</p>
<p>and energies of particles and put some requirements.</p>
<p>So you would say, if there&rsquo;s a particle</p>
<p>with an energy above some threshold,</p>
<p>then record this collision.</p>
<p>But if there isn&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Whereas now the attempt is get more and more</p>
<p>machine learning in at the earliest possible stage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool, at the stage of deciding</p>
<p>whether we want to keep this data or not.</p>
<p>But also maybe even lower down than that,</p>
<p>which is the point where there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>so generally how the data is reconstructed</p>
<p>is you start off with a set of digital hits</p>
<p>in your detector.</p>
<p>So channels saying, did you see something?</p>
<p>Did you not see something?</p>
<p>That has to be then turned into tracks,</p>
<p>particles going in different directions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s done by using fits</p>
<p>that fit through the data points.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s passed to the algorithms</p>
<p>that then go, is this interesting or not?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;d be better is you could train machine learning</p>
<p>to just look at the raw hits,</p>
<p>the basic real base level information,</p>
<p>not have any of the reconstruction done.</p>
<p>And it just goes, and it can learn to do pattern recognition</p>
<p>on this strange three dimensional image that you get.</p>
<p>And potentially that&rsquo;s where you could get really big gains</p>
<p>because our triggers tend to be quite inefficient</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have time to do</p>
<p>the full whiz bang processing</p>
<p>to get all the information out that we would like,</p>
<p>because you have to do the decision very quickly.</p>
<p>So if you can come up with some clever</p>
<p>machine learning technique,</p>
<p>then potentially you can massively increase</p>
<p>the amount of useful data you record</p>
<p>and get rid of more of the background</p>
<p>earlier in the process.</p>
<p>Yeah, to me, that&rsquo;s an exciting possibility</p>
<p>because then you don&rsquo;t have to build a sort of,</p>
<p>you can get a gain without having to.</p>
<p>Without having to build any hardware, I suppose.</p>
<p>Hardware, yeah.</p>
<p>Although you need lots of new GPU farms, I guess.</p>
<p>So hardware still helps.</p>
<p>But I got to talk to you,</p>
<p>sort of I&rsquo;m not sure how to ask,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re clearly an incredible science communicator.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the right term,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re basically a younger Neil deGrasse Tyson</p>
<p>with a British accent.</p>
<p>So, and you&rsquo;ve, I mean,</p>
<p>can you say where we are today, actually?</p>
<p>Yeah, so today we&rsquo;re in the Royal Institution in London,</p>
<p>which is a very old organization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been around for about 200 years now, I think.</p>
<p>Maybe even I should know when it was founded.</p>
<p>Sort of early 19th century,</p>
<p>it was set up to basically communicate science to the public.</p>
<p>So it was one of the first places in the world</p>
<p>where famous scientists would come and give talks.</p>
<p>So very famously Humphrey Davy, who you may know of,</p>
<p>who was the person who discovered nitrous oxide.</p>
<p>He was a very famous chemist and scientist.</p>
<p>Also discovered electrolysis.</p>
<p>So he used to do these fantastic,</p>
<p>he was a very charismatic speaker.</p>
<p>So he used to appear here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big desk that they usually have in the theater</p>
<p>and he would do demonstrations to the sort of the,</p>
<p>the folk of London back in the early 19th century.</p>
<p>And Michael Faraday, who I talked about,</p>
<p>who is the person who did so much work on electromagnetism,</p>
<p>he used, he lectured here.</p>
<p>He also did experiments in the basement.</p>
<p>So this place has got a long history</p>
<p>of both scientific research,</p>
<p>but also communication of scientific research.</p>
<p>So you gave a few lectures here.</p>
<p>How many, two?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given, yeah, I&rsquo;ve given a couple of lectures</p>
<p>in this theater before, so.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, so people should definitely go watch online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the explanation of particle physics.</p>
<p>So all the, I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Like your lectures are just incredible.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t sing it enough praise.</p>
<p>So it was awesome.</p>
<p>But maybe can you say, what did that feel like?</p>
<p>What does it feel like to lecture here, to talk about that?</p>
<p>And maybe from a different perspective,</p>
<p>more kind of like how the sausage is made is,</p>
<p>how do you prepare for that kind of thing?</p>
<p>How do you think about communication,</p>
<p>the process of communicating these ideas</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s inspiring to,</p>
<p>what I would say your talks are inspiring</p>
<p>to like the general audience.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually have to be a scientist.</p>
<p>You can still be inspired without really knowing much of the,</p>
<p>you start from the very basics.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the preparation process?</p>
<p>And then the romantic question is,</p>
<p>what did that feel like to perform here?</p>
<p>I mean, profession, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, the process, I mean, the talk,</p>
<p>my favorite talk that I gave here</p>
<p>was one called Beyond the Higgs,</p>
<p>which you can find on the Royal Institute&rsquo;s YouTube channel,</p>
<p>which you should go and check out.</p>
<p>I mean, and their channel&rsquo;s got loads of great talks</p>
<p>with loads of great people as well.</p>
<p>I mean, that one, I&rsquo;d sort of given a version of it</p>
<p>many times, so part of it is just practice, right?</p>
<p>And actually, I don&rsquo;t have some great theory</p>
<p>of how to communicate with people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more just that I&rsquo;m really interested</p>
<p>and excited by those ideas and I like talking about them.</p>
<p>And through the process of doing that,</p>
<p>I guess I figured out stories that work</p>
<p>and explanations that work.</p>
<p>When you say practice, you mean legitimately</p>
<p>just giving talks? Just giving talks, yeah.</p>
<p>I started off when I was a PhD student</p>
<p>doing talks in schools and I still do that as well</p>
<p>some of the time and doing things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve even done a bit of standup comedy,</p>
<p>which sort of went reasonably well,</p>
<p>even if it was terrifying.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s on YouTube as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also on, I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily recommend</p>
<p>you check that out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna post the links several places</p>
<p>to make sure people click on it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s basically, I kind of have a story in my head</p>
<p>and I kind of, I have to think about what I wanna say.</p>
<p>I usually have some images to support what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>and I get up and do it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not really, I wish there was some kind of,</p>
<p>I probably should have some proper process.</p>
<p>This is very sounds like I&rsquo;m just making up as I go along</p>
<p>and I sort of am.</p>
<p>Well, I think the fundamental thing that you said,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know if you know</p>
<p>who a guy named Joe Rogan is.</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s also kind of sounds like you in a sense</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s not very introspective about his process,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s an incredibly engaging conversationalist.</p>
<p>And I think one of the things that you and him share</p>
<p>that I could see is like a genuine curiosity</p>
<p>and passion for the topic.</p>
<p>I think that could be systematically cultivated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a process to it,</p>
<p>but you come to it naturally somehow.</p>
<p>I think maybe there&rsquo;s something else as well,</p>
<p>which is to understand something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this quote by Feynman, which I really like,</p>
<p>which is what I cannot create, I do not understand.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not particularly super bright.</p>
<p>So for me to understand something,</p>
<p>I have to break it down into its simplest elements.</p>
<p>And if I can then tell people about that,</p>
<p>that helps me understand it as well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve learned to understand physics a lot more</p>
<p>from the process of communicating,</p>
<p>because it forces you to really scrutinize the ideas</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re communicating and it often makes you realize</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really understand the ideas you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m writing a book at the moment,</p>
<p>and I had this experience yesterday where I realized</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really understand a pretty fundamental</p>
<p>theoretical aspect of my own subject.</p>
<p>And I had to go and I had to sort of spend</p>
<p>a couple of days reading textbooks and thinking about it</p>
<p>in order to make sure that the explanation I gave</p>
<p>captured the, got as close to what is actually happening</p>
<p>in the theory.</p>
<p>And to do that, you have to really understand it properly.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s layers to understanding.</p>
<p>It seems like the more,</p>
<p>there must be some kind of Feynman law.</p>
<p>I mean, the more you understand sort of the simpler</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to really convey the essence of the idea, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like this reverse effect that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the more you understand, the simpler the final thing</p>
<p>that you actually convey.</p>
<p>And so the more accessible somehow it becomes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Feynman&rsquo;s lectures are really accessible.</p>
<p>It was just counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Yeah, although there are some ideas</p>
<p>that are very difficult to explain</p>
<p>no matter how well or badly you understand them.</p>
<p>Like I still can&rsquo;t really properly explain</p>
<p>the Higgs mechanism.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because some of these ideas only exist</p>
<p>in mathematics really.</p>
<p>And the only way to really develop an understanding</p>
<p>is to go unfortunately to a graduate degree in physics.</p>
<p>But you can get kind of a flavor of what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>I think, and it&rsquo;s trying to do that in a way</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t misleading, but always also intelligible.</p>
<p>So let me ask them the romantic question of</p>
<p>what to you is the most, perhaps an unfair question,</p>
<p>what is the most beautiful idea in physics?</p>
<p>One that fills you with awe is the most surprising,</p>
<p>the strangest, the weirdest.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different definitions of beauty.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s several for you,</p>
<p>but is there something that just jumps to mind</p>
<p>that you think is just especially beautiful?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a specific thing and a more general thing.</p>
<p>So maybe the specific thing first,</p>
<p>which I can now first came across as an undergraduate.</p>
<p>I found this amazing.</p>
<p>So this idea that the forces of nature,</p>
<p>electromagnetism, strong force, the weak force,</p>
<p>they arise in our theories as a consequence of symmetries.</p>
<p>So symmetries in the laws of nature,</p>
<p>in the equations essentially</p>
<p>that used to describe these ideas,</p>
<p>the process whereby theories come up</p>
<p>with these sorts of models is they say,</p>
<p>imagine the universe obeys this particular type of symmetry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a symmetry that isn&rsquo;t so far removed</p>
<p>from a geometrical symmetry, like the rotations of a cube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you can&rsquo;t think of it quite that way,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of a similar sort of idea.</p>
<p>And you say, okay, if the universe respects the symmetry,</p>
<p>you find that you have to introduce a force</p>
<p>which has the properties of electromagnetism</p>
<p>or a different symmetry, you get the strong force</p>
<p>or a different symmetry, you get the weak force.</p>
<p>So these interactions seem to come from some deeper,</p>
<p>it suggests that they come</p>
<p>from some deeper symmetry principle.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends a bit how you look at it</p>
<p>because it could be that we&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>just recognizing symmetries in the things that we see,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something rather lovely about that.</p>
<p>But I mean, I suppose a bigger thing that makes me wonder</p>
<p>is actually, if you look at the laws of nature,</p>
<p>how particles interact when you get really close down,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically pretty simple things.</p>
<p>They bounce off each other by exchanging</p>
<p>through force fields and they move around</p>
<p>in very simple ways.</p>
<p>And somehow these basic ingredients,</p>
<p>these few particles that we know about in the forces</p>
<p>creates this universe, which is unbelievably complicated</p>
<p>and has things like you and me in it,</p>
<p>and the earth and stars that make matter in their cores</p>
<p>from the gravitational energy of their own bulk</p>
<p>that then gets sprayed into the universe</p>
<p>that forms other things.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that there&rsquo;s this incredibly long story</p>
<p>that goes right back to the beginning,</p>
<p>and we can take this story right back to a trillionth</p>
<p>of a second after the Big Bang,</p>
<p>and we can trace the origins of the stuff</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re made from.</p>
<p>And it all ultimately comes from these simple ingredients</p>
<p>with these simple rules.</p>
<p>And the fact you can generate such complexity from that</p>
<p>is really mysterious, I think, and strange.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even a question that physicists</p>
<p>can really tackle because we are sort of trying</p>
<p>to find these really elementary laws.</p>
<p>But it turns out that going from elementary laws</p>
<p>and a few particles to something even as complicated</p>
<p>as a molecule becomes very difficult.</p>
<p>So going from a molecule to a human being</p>
<p>is a problem that just can&rsquo;t be tackled,</p>
<p>at least not at the moment, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, the emergence of complexity from simple rules</p>
<p>is so beautiful and so mysterious.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have good mathematics</p>
<p>to even try to approach that emergent phenomena.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have chemistry and biology</p>
<p>and all the other subjects, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it, Harry.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I mean, I think I speak for a lot of people</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t wait to see what happens</p>
<p>in the next five, 10, 20 years with you.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re one of the great communicators of our time.</p>
<p>So I hope you continue that and I hope that grows.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m definitely a huge fan.</p>
<p>So it was an honor to talk to you today.</p>
<p>Thanks so much, man.</p>
<p>It was really fun, thanks very much.</p>

<p>You and I are leftovers.</p>
<p>Every particle in our bodies is a survivor</p>
<p>from an almighty shootout between matter and antimatter</p>
<p>that happened a little after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>In fact, only one in a billion particles created</p>
<p>at the beginning of time have survived to the present day.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
