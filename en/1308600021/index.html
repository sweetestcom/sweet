    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>This month on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking all about physical performance.</p>
<p>So that means athletic performance, recreational exercise,</p>
<p>weightlifting, running, swimming, yoga,</p>
<p>skills and skill learning.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>and focus on skill learning.</p>
<p>We are going to focus on how to learn skills more quickly,</p>
<p>in particular motor skills.</p>
<p>This will also translate to things like musical skills</p>
<p>and playing instruments,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re mainly going to focus on physical movements</p>
<p>of the body that extend beyond the hands,</p>
<p>like just playing the piano,</p>
<p>or the fingers like playing the guitar.</p>
<p>But everything we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>will also serve the formation and the consolidation</p>
<p>and the performance of other types of skills.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in how to perform better,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s dance or yoga,</p>
<p>or even something that&rsquo;s just very repetitive</p>
<p>like running or swimming,</p>
<p>this podcast episode is for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go deep into the science of skill learning,</p>
<p>and we are going to talk about very specific protocols</p>
<p>that the science points to and has verified</p>
<p>allow you to learn more quickly,</p>
<p>to embed that learning so that you remember it,</p>
<p>and to be able to build up skills more quickly</p>
<p>than you would otherwise.</p>
<p>We are also going to touch on a few things</p>
<p>that I get asked about a lot,</p>
<p>but fortunately recently,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the time to go deep into the literature,</p>
<p>extract the data for you,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s mental visualization.</p>
<p>How does visualizing a particular skill or practice</p>
<p>serve the learning and or the consolidation</p>
<p>of that practice?</p>
<p>It turns out there are some absolutely striking protocols</p>
<p>that one can use,</p>
<p>striking meaning they allow you to learn faster,</p>
<p>and they allow you to remember how to do things</p>
<p>more quickly and better</p>
<p>than if you were not doing this mental rehearsal,</p>
<p>but the pattern of mental rehearsal,</p>
<p>and when you do that mental rehearsal</p>
<p>turns out to be vitally important.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited for today&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to share a lot of information with you,</p>
<p>and there are going to be a lot of very simple takeaways.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>Before we get into the topic of skill learning</p>
<p>and tools for accelerating skill learning,</p>
<p>I want to briefly revisit the topic of temperature,</p>
<p>which was covered in the last episode</p>
<p>and just highlight a few things</p>
<p>and clear up some misunderstandings.</p>
<p>So last episode talked about these incredible data</p>
<p>from my colleague, Craig Heller&rsquo;s lab at Stanford.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in the department of biology</p>
<p>showing that cooling the palms in particular ways</p>
<p>and at particular times can allow athletes</p>
<p>or just recreational exercisers</p>
<p>to do more pull-ups, dips, bench presses per unit time,</p>
<p>to run further, to cycle further,</p>
<p>and to feel better doing it.</p>
<p>There really are incredible data</p>
<p>that are anchored in the biology of the vascular system,</p>
<p>the blood supply and how it&rsquo;s involved in cooling us.</p>
<p>Many of you, dozens of you in fact,</p>
<p>said, wait a second, you gave us a protocol in this episode</p>
<p>which says that we should cool our palms periodically</p>
<p>throughout exercise in order to be able to do more work.</p>
<p>But on the episode before that</p>
<p>on growth hormone and thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>you said that heating up the body</p>
<p>is good for release of growth hormone.</p>
<p>And I just want to clarify that both things are true.</p>
<p>These are two separate protocols.</p>
<p>You should always warm up before you exercise.</p>
<p>That warmup will not increase your body temperature</p>
<p>or the muscle temperature to the point</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s going to diminish your work capacity,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to harm your performance.</p>
<p>The cooling of the palms,</p>
<p>which is really just a route to cool your core</p>
<p>in an efficient way, the most efficient way in fact,</p>
<p>is about improving performance.</p>
<p>Heating up the body with exercise</p>
<p>and focusing on heat increases</p>
<p>or using sauna for heat increases</p>
<p>is geared toward growth hormone release,</p>
<p>which is a separate matter.</p>
<p>So you can do both of these protocols</p>
<p>but you would want to do them at separate times.</p>
<p>So just to make this very concrete</p>
<p>before I move on to today&rsquo;s topic,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in doing more work,</p>
<p>being able to do more sets and reps per unit time</p>
<p>and feel better doing it or to run further</p>
<p>or to cycle further, then cooling the palms periodically</p>
<p>as I described in the previous episode</p>
<p>is going to be the way to go.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in getting growth hormone release,</p>
<p>well then hot sauna, and I offered some other tools</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have a sauna in the episode</p>
<p>on growth hormone and thyroid hormone</p>
<p>is going to be the way to go.</p>
<p>Okay, so those are separate protocols.</p>
<p>You can include them in your fitness regime</p>
<p>and your training regime,</p>
<p>but you do want to do them at separate times.</p>
<p>And as a last point about this,</p>
<p>I also mentioned that caffeine can either help</p>
<p>or hinder performance</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you&rsquo;re caffeine adapted</p>
<p>because of the ways that caffeine impacts body temperature</p>
<p>and all sorts of things like vasodilation and constriction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>If you enjoy caffeine before your workouts</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re accustomed to caffeine,</p>
<p>meaning you drink it three or five times or more a week,</p>
<p>100 to 300 milligrams is a typical daily dose of caffeine.</p>
<p>Some of you are ingesting more, some less.</p>
<p>If you do that regularly,</p>
<p>well then it&rsquo;s going to be just fine</p>
<p>to ingest caffeine before you train.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to impact your body temperature</p>
<p>and your vasodilation or constriction</p>
<p>in ways that will hinder you.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re not a regular caffeine user</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking, oh, I&rsquo;m going to drink a cup of coffee</p>
<p>and get this huge performance enhancing effect,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>Chances are it&rsquo;s going to lead to increases</p>
<p>in body temperature and changes in the way</p>
<p>that blood flow is happening in your body</p>
<p>and in particular on these palmar surfaces and in your face</p>
<p>that is going to likely diminish performance.</p>
<p>So if you enjoy caffeine and you&rsquo;re accustomed to it,</p>
<p>so-called caffeine adapted, enjoy it before your training.</p>
<p>If you regularly, excuse me,</p>
<p>if you do not regularly use caffeine,</p>
<p>then you probably do not want to view caffeine</p>
<p>as a performance enhancing tool.</p>
<p>And while we&rsquo;re on the topic of tools,</p>
<p>and because this is a month on athletic performance</p>
<p>and exercise and physical skill learning,</p>
<p>I want to offer an additional tool</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve certainly found useful,</p>
<p>which is how to relieve the so-called side stitch</p>
<p>or side cramp when running or swimming.</p>
<p>This actually relates to respiration</p>
<p>and to the nervous system.</p>
<p>And it is not a cramp.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been out running</p>
<p>and you felt like you had a pain on your side,</p>
<p>that pain could be any number of things,</p>
<p>but that what feels like cramping of your side</p>
<p>is actually due to what&rsquo;s called collateralization</p>
<p>of the phrenic nerve, which is a lot harder to say</p>
<p>than a side cramp or a side stitch.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the situation.</p>
<p>You have a set of nerves,</p>
<p>which is called the phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C,</p>
<p>the phrenic nerve, which extends down</p>
<p>from your brainstem, essentially, this region,</p>
<p>to your diaphragm to control your breathing.</p>
<p>It has a collateral, meaning it has a branch,</p>
<p>just like the branch on a tree,</p>
<p>that innervates your liver.</p>
<p>And if you are not breathing deeply enough,</p>
<p>what can happen is you can get</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called sometimes a referenced pain.</p>
<p>Referenced pain is probably going to be familiar</p>
<p>to any of you who have ever read</p>
<p>about how to recognize heart attack.</p>
<p>You know, people who have heart attacks</p>
<p>will sometimes have pain on one side of their body,</p>
<p>the left arm.</p>
<p>Sometimes people that have pain in a part of their back</p>
<p>will suddenly also get pain in their shoulder</p>
<p>or part of their face.</p>
<p>This has to do with the fact</p>
<p>that many of our nerves branch,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re collateralized</p>
<p>to different organs and areas of the body.</p>
<p>And the way those nerves are woven together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often the case that if we disrupt the pattern</p>
<p>of firing of electrical activity</p>
<p>in one of those nerve branches</p>
<p>that the other ones are affected too.</p>
<p>The side stitch, the pain in your side,</p>
<p>is often because of the contractions of the diaphragm</p>
<p>because of the way you&rsquo;re breathing</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re exercising, running or swimming or biking.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, you feel pain in your side,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not a cramp.</p>
<p>The way to relieve it is very simple.</p>
<p>You do the physiological sigh that I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>in previous episodes of the podcast and elsewhere,</p>
<p>which is a double inhale through the nose,</p>
<p>very deep, and then a long exhale.</p>
<p>And you might want to repeat that two or three times.</p>
<p>Typically, that will relieve the side stitch</p>
<p>because of the way that it changes the firing patterns</p>
<p>of the phrenic nerve.</p>
<p>So the side stitch is annoying, it&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you think we&rsquo;re dehydrated</p>
<p>and you might be dehydrated,</p>
<p>but oftentimes it&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re breathing in a way</p>
<p>that causes some referenced pain of the liver.</p>
<p>We call it a side stitch or a side cramp,</p>
<p>and you can relieve it very easily</p>
<p>through the double inhale, long exhale.</p>
<p>That pattern done two or three times.</p>
<p>Often you can continue to engage in the exercise</p>
<p>while you do the double inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>and it will just relieve itself that way.</p>
<p>So give it a try if you experienced the side stitch.</p>
<p>Some people I know are also doing the double inhale,</p>
<p>long exhale during long continuous bouts of exercise.</p>
<p>I actually do this when I run.</p>
<p>We have decent data,</p>
<p>although these are still unpublished data</p>
<p>that can engage a kind of regular cadence</p>
<p>of heart rate variability.</p>
<p>So there are a number of reasons</p>
<p>why this physiological side can be useful,</p>
<p>but it certainly can be useful for relieving the side stitch</p>
<p>or so-called side cramp.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the acquisition of new skills.</p>
<p>These could be skills such as a golf swing</p>
<p>or a tennis swing, or you&rsquo;re shooting free throws,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re learning to dance,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re learning an instrument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mainly going to focus on athletic performance.</p>
<p>There are basically two types of skills,</p>
<p>open loop and closed loop.</p>
<p>Open loop skills are skills</p>
<p>where you perform some sort of motor action,</p>
<p>and then you wait and you get immediate feedback</p>
<p>as to whether or not it was done correctly or not.</p>
<p>A good example would be throwing darts at a dart board.</p>
<p>So if you throw the dart,</p>
<p>you get feedback about whether or not you hit the bullseye,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re off the dart board,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re some other location on the dart board.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s open loop.</p>
<p>Closed loop would be something that&rsquo;s more continuous.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a runner</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re starting to do some speed work and some sprints,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re running and you can kind of feel</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re running correctly</p>
<p>or maybe you even have a coach</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re correcting your stride</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re trying to do some sort of skill</p>
<p>like a hopscotch skill,</p>
<p>which maybe you&rsquo;re doing the ladder work</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re stepping between designated spaces</p>
<p>on the ground.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s closed loop because as you go,</p>
<p>you can adjust your behavior</p>
<p>and you can adjust the distance of your steps,</p>
<p>or you can adjust your speed,</p>
<p>or you can adjust your posture.</p>
<p>And you are able to essentially do more practice</p>
<p>per unit time,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re getting feedback on a moment to moment basis.</p>
<p>Okay, so you have open loop and closed loop.</p>
<p>And just to make this very, very clear,</p>
<p>open loop would be practicing your tennis serve.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that you set a target</p>
<p>on the other side of the net,</p>
<p>you throw the ball up and you hit the ball, it goes over,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s open loop.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll know whether or not you were in the court,</p>
<p>you were on the location you wanted to hit</p>
<p>or close to it or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s open loop.</p>
<p>Closed loop would be if you&rsquo;re in a regular case,</p>
<p>so maybe you&rsquo;re learning a swim stroke,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re trying to learn a particular rhythm</p>
<p>on the drum.</p>
<p>So maybe you&rsquo;re trying to learn a particular beat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very musical,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not going to embarrass myself</p>
<p>by giving an example of this,</p>
<p>although later I will,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to get a particular rhythm down.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not getting it,</p>
<p>you can adjust in real time</p>
<p>and try and catch up or slow down or speed up, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay, so hopefully you&rsquo;ll understand open loop</p>
<p>and closed loop.</p>
<p>You should always know before you try and learn a skill,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s open loop or closed loop.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll return to why that&rsquo;s important shortly.</p>
<p>But if you want to learn something,</p>
<p>ask is it open loop or closed loop?</p>
<p>There are essentially three components of any skill</p>
<p>that involves motor movement.</p>
<p>And those are sensory perception,</p>
<p>actually perceiving what you are doing</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s happening around you.</p>
<p>So what you see, what you hear,</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;re paying attention</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re doing specifically,</p>
<p>like the trajectory of your arm</p>
<p>or how you&rsquo;re moving your feet if you&rsquo;re learning to dance.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re more focused</p>
<p>on something that&rsquo;s happening outside of you,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re listening for something in music</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re paying attention</p>
<p>to the way your partner is moving, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s sensory input.</p>
<p>Then there are the actual movements.</p>
<p>Okay, so there are the movements of your limbs and body.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s something called proprioception.</p>
<p>And proprioception is often discussed</p>
<p>as kind of a sixth sense of knowing where your limbs are</p>
<p>in relation to your body.</p>
<p>So proprioception is vitally important.</p>
<p>If I reach down and pick up this pen and pick it up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about where the pen in my hand</p>
<p>is relative to my body,</p>
<p>but proprioceptively I&rsquo;m aware of it</p>
<p>at kind of a sixth sense deeper subconscious level.</p>
<p>I can also make myself aware of where my limbs are.</p>
<p>And typically when we learn,</p>
<p>we are placing more focus on proprioception</p>
<p>than we do ordinarily.</p>
<p>So if I get up from this chair</p>
<p>and I happen to walk out of the room,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about where my feet are landing</p>
<p>relative to one another.</p>
<p>But if my leg had fallen asleep</p>
<p>because I had been leaning on one of the nerves of my leg</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>and my leg feels all tingly or numb,</p>
<p>I and you, if this were to happen to you,</p>
<p>would immediately notice a shift in gait.</p>
<p>It would feel strange.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to pay attention to how I&rsquo;m stepping.</p>
<p>And the reason is I&rsquo;m not getting</p>
<p>any proprioceptive feedback.</p>
<p>Now, skill learning has a lot of other dimensions too,</p>
<p>but those are the main ones that we&rsquo;re going to focus on.</p>
<p>So just to remind you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you need to know open loop or closed loop,</p>
<p>and you need to know whether or not, excuse me,</p>
<p>you need to know that there&rsquo;s sensory perception,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re paying attention to,</p>
<p>movements themselves, and proprioception.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one other important thing that you need to know,</p>
<p>which is that movement of any kind is generated</p>
<p>from one, two, or three sources within your nervous system,</p>
<p>within your brain and body.</p>
<p>These are central pattern generators,</p>
<p>which are sometimes called CSPGs, excuse me, CPGSs.</p>
<p>CSPGs are something entirely different in biology.</p>
<p>CPGSs, this just goes to show that I have a module.</p>
<p>CSPGs are chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans.</p>
<p>They have nothing to do with this topic.</p>
<p>CPGSs are central pattern generators,</p>
<p>or CPGs they&rsquo;re sometimes called.</p>
<p>These CPGs are in your spinal cord, mine and yours,</p>
<p>different ones, and they generate repetitive movements.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re walking, if you&rsquo;re running, if you&rsquo;re cycling,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re breathing, which presumably you are,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing that in a regular rhythmic cadence,</p>
<p>central pattern generators are controlling that movement.</p>
<p>After you learn how to walk, run, swim, cycle,</p>
<p>do anything really, much of the work is handed off</p>
<p>to these central pattern generators.</p>
<p>And there were experiments that were done</p>
<p>in the 60s, 70s, and 80s</p>
<p>that actually looked at decerebrate animals</p>
<p>and even decerebrate humans.</p>
<p>These are humans and animals that lack a cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>They lack much of the brain,</p>
<p>and yet they can engage in what&rsquo;s called a fictive movement.</p>
<p>So it sounds like a kind of barbaric experiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I wasn&rsquo;t the one to have to do them,</p>
<p>but this is the stuff of neuroscience textbooks</p>
<p>that cats or dogs or mice</p>
<p>that have their neocortex removed,</p>
<p>put them on a treadmill, they&rsquo;ll walk just fine.</p>
<p>And they will adjust their speed of walking just fine,</p>
<p>even though they basically lack</p>
<p>all their thinking, decision-making brain.</p>
<p>And it turns out humans that have,</p>
<p>unfortunately, massive strokes to their cortex</p>
<p>and lack any neocortex,</p>
<p>but preserve the central pattern generators,</p>
<p>will also walk just fine,</p>
<p>even though they lack any of the other stuff in the brain.</p>
<p>So these CPGs or CPGSs are amazing,</p>
<p>and they control a lot of our already learned behavior.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re really good at something,</p>
<p>CPGs are controlling a lot of that behavior.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true also for a golf swing,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not really repetitive.</p>
<p>Somebody who&rsquo;s really good at golf is going to,</p>
<p>I guess you call it a tee, you put the ball on the tee.</p>
<p>I show my knowledge of golf.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only done mini golf, frankly,</p>
<p>but someday maybe I&rsquo;ll learn how to golf,</p>
<p>but you set the golf ball down and swing,</p>
<p>set the golf ball down, swing.</p>
<p>Central pattern generators are going to handle</p>
<p>a lot of that.</p>
<p>If I were to go to the golf course,</p>
<p>Stanford has a beautiful golf course.</p>
<p>If I were to go out there, put a ball on the tee,</p>
<p>my central pattern generators would not be involved</p>
<p>in that at all.</p>
<p>The moment I get, you know, bringing the club back to swing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to engage other things.</p>
<p>And the other things it&rsquo;s going to engage,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know that behavior now or then,</p>
<p>is upper motor neurons.</p>
<p>We have motor neurons in our cortex, in our neocortex,</p>
<p>that control deliberate action.</p>
<p>And those are the ones that you&rsquo;re engaging</p>
<p>when you are learning.</p>
<p>Those are the ones that you have to pay attention</p>
<p>in order to engage.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening, for instance,</p>
<p>if I decide I&rsquo;m going to reach down and pick up my pen,</p>
<p>which I rarely think about, but now I&rsquo;m thinking about it,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to do this in a very deliberate way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to grab with these two fingers and lift.</p>
<p>My upper motor neurons are now involved, okay?</p>
<p>So upper motor neurons are very important</p>
<p>because a little bit later in the episode,</p>
<p>when we talk about how to use visualization</p>
<p>in order to accelerate skill learning,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to leverage these upper motor neurons</p>
<p>in very particular ways, okay?</p>
<p>So we have CPGs for rhythmic movement,</p>
<p>upper motor neurons for deliberate unlearned movements</p>
<p>or movements that we are in the process of learning.</p>
<p>And then we have what are called lower motor neurons.</p>
<p>Lower motor neurons are the ones in our spinal cord</p>
<p>that send little wires out to our muscles,</p>
<p>which actually cause the firing of those muscle fibers, okay?</p>
<p>So the way to think about this</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve got upper motor neurons,</p>
<p>which talk to CPGs and to lower motor neurons.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really simple.</p>
<p>And now you know most everything there is to know</p>
<p>about the neural pathways controlling movement,</p>
<p>at least for sake of this discussion.</p>
<p>So anytime we learn something,</p>
<p>we have to decide what to place our sensory perception on,</p>
<p>meaning what are we going to focus on?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s critical.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening to this</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the type of person who likes taking notes,</p>
<p>this should be the second question you ask.</p>
<p>Remember, the first question is,</p>
<p>is it open loop or closed loop?</p>
<p>The second question should be,</p>
<p>what should I focus my attention on?</p>
<p>Auditory attention, visual attention, or proprioception.</p>
<p>Should I focus on where my limbs are relative to my body,</p>
<p>or should I focus on the outcome?</p>
<p>Okay, this is a critical distinction.</p>
<p>You can decide to learn how to do a golf swing</p>
<p>or learn how to shoot free throws</p>
<p>or learn how to dance tango</p>
<p>and decide that you are going to focus on</p>
<p>the movements of your partner or the positions of your feet.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re going to look at them.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re going to sense them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to actually feel where they are.</p>
<p>Or maybe you&rsquo;re going to sense the position</p>
<p>and posture of your body, which is more proprioceptive, okay?</p>
<p>So you have to allocate your attention,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to tell you how to allocate your attention</p>
<p>best in order to learn faster.</p>
<p>So these are the sorts of decisions that you have to make.</p>
<p>Fortunately for you, you don&rsquo;t have to think about</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re going to use your upper motor neurons</p>
<p>and your lower motor neurons or not,</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t know how to do something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re automatically going to engage</p>
<p>your upper motor neurons.</p>
<p>And if you do, then you&rsquo;re not going to use</p>
<p>your upper motor neurons.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re mainly going to rely on central pattern generators.</p>
<p>You are always using your lower motor neurons to move muscle.</p>
<p>So we can really simplify things now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given you a lot of information, but we can simplify it.</p>
<p>Basically, open loop or closed loop, that&rsquo;s one question.</p>
<p>And what am I going to focus on?</p>
<p>And then your neurology will take care of the rest.</p>
<p>So now I want to talk about realistic expectations.</p>
<p>Somewhere in Hollywood, presumably,</p>
<p>it got embedded in somebody&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>that instant skill acquisition was possible,</p>
<p>that you could take a particular pill</p>
<p>or you could touch a particular object</p>
<p>or you could have a wand wave over you</p>
<p>and you would suddenly have a skill.</p>
<p>And so that is the result of Hollywood at all.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t exist, at least not in reality.</p>
<p>And I love movies, but it simply doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Then the self-help literature created another rule</p>
<p>called the 10,000 hours rule.</p>
<p>And frankly, that doesn&rsquo;t really match the literature,</p>
<p>at least the scientific literature, either.</p>
<p>I like it because it implies that learning takes time,</p>
<p>which is more accurate than the Hollywood at all</p>
<p>instant skill acquisition rule, which isn&rsquo;t really a rule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a myth.</p>
<p>But the 10,000 hours rule overlooks something crucial,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s not about hours, it&rsquo;s about repetitions.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there&rsquo;s a relationship</p>
<p>between time and repetitions,</p>
<p>but there are some beautiful experiments</p>
<p>that point to the fact that by simple adjustment</p>
<p>of what you are focused on</p>
<p>as you attempt to learn a new skill,</p>
<p>you can adjust the number of repetitions that you do,</p>
<p>you adjust your motivation for learning,</p>
<p>and you can vastly accelerate learning.</p>
<p>Some of you may recognize this by its internet name,</p>
<p>which is not a scientific term,</p>
<p>which is the Super Mario effect.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a quite good video on YouTube</p>
<p>describing the Super Mario effect.</p>
<p>I think it was a YouTuber who has,</p>
<p>I think a background in science,</p>
<p>and he did an interesting experiment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll talk about his experiment first,</p>
<p>and then I will talk about the neurobiology</p>
<p>that supports the result that he got.</p>
<p>The Super Mario effect relates</p>
<p>to the game Super Mario Brothers,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll see why at the end.</p>
<p>But basically what they did was they had 50,000 subjects,</p>
<p>which is a enormous number of subjects,</p>
<p>learn a program, essentially taking words</p>
<p>from a computer program or the commands</p>
<p>for a computer program that were kind of clustered</p>
<p>in a column on the right.</p>
<p>So these are the sorts of things</p>
<p>that computer programmers will be familiar with,</p>
<p>but other people won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And those commands are essentially,</p>
<p>they essentially translate to things like,</p>
<p>go forward, and then if it&rsquo;s a right-hand turn in the maze,</p>
<p>then go right and continue</p>
<p>until you hit a choice point, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bunch of instructions,</p>
<p>but the job of the subjects in these experiments</p>
<p>were to organize those instructions in a particular way</p>
<p>that would allow a little cursor</p>
<p>to move through the maze successfully, okay?</p>
<p>So basically the goal was,</p>
<p>or at least what the subjects were told,</p>
<p>is that anyone can learn to computer program,</p>
<p>and if somebody can just organize the instructions</p>
<p>in the right way, then they can program</p>
<p>this little cursor to move through a maze, very simple.</p>
<p>And yet, if you don&rsquo;t have any background</p>
<p>in computer programming, or even if you do,</p>
<p>it takes some skill.</p>
<p>You have to know what commands to give</p>
<p>in what particular order, and they made that very easy.</p>
<p>You could just assemble them in a list</p>
<p>over onto the right.</p>
<p>So people started doing this.</p>
<p>Now, there were two groups,</p>
<p>and one half of the subjects,</p>
<p>if they got it wrong,</p>
<p>meaning they entered a command and the cursor would move,</p>
<p>and it was the wrong command</p>
<p>for this little cursor to move through the maze,</p>
<p>they saw a signal jump up on their screen</p>
<p>that said, that did not work, please try again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>If they put in the wrong command</p>
<p>or it was in the wrong sequence,</p>
<p>it would say, that did not work, please try again.</p>
<p>And then the subjects would reorganize the instructions,</p>
<p>and then the little cursor would continue.</p>
<p>And if they got it wrong again,</p>
<p>it would say, that did not work, please try again, okay?</p>
<p>The other half of the subjects,</p>
<p>if they got something wrong,</p>
<p>were told, you just lost five points, please continue.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the only difference in the feedback that they got.</p>
<p>Now, I have to confess,</p>
<p>I would have predicted based on my knowledge</p>
<p>of dopamine circuitry and reward contingency</p>
<p>and epinephrine and stress and motivated learning,</p>
<p>and this other thing that we&rsquo;ve been told</p>
<p>in many, many books on behavioral economics</p>
<p>and in the self-help literature,</p>
<p>which is that people will work much harder</p>
<p>to prevent losing something</p>
<p>than they will to gain something.</p>
<p>That you hear all the time.</p>
<p>And it turns out that that&rsquo;s not at all what happened.</p>
<p>If they looked at the success rate of the subjects,</p>
<p>what they found was that the subjects that were told,</p>
<p>that did not work, please try again,</p>
<p>had a 68% success rate.</p>
<p>68% of them went on to successfully program</p>
<p>this cursor moving through the maze.</p>
<p>Whereas the ones that were told you lost five points</p>
<p>had a 52% success rate,</p>
<p>which is a significant difference.</p>
<p>But the source of the success</p>
<p>or the lack of success is really interesting.</p>
<p>The subjects that were told,</p>
<p>that did not work, please try again,</p>
<p>tried many, many more times per unit time.</p>
<p>In other words, they made more attempts</p>
<p>at programming this thing</p>
<p>to allow this cursor to move through the maze.</p>
<p>Whereas the people that were told you lost five points</p>
<p>gave up earlier or gave up entirely.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s just step back from this</p>
<p>because to me, this was very surprising.</p>
<p>It violates a lot of things that I had heard</p>
<p>in the kind of popular culture or the self-help literature</p>
<p>that people will work much harder</p>
<p>to avoid losing something than they will to gain something.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t really fit with what I understood</p>
<p>about reward contingencies and dopamine.</p>
<p>But it did fit well with another set of experiments</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m very familiar with</p>
<p>from the neuroscience literature.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you the punchline first.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to take what these data mean</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about a learning protocol</p>
<p>that you can use that will allow you to learn skills faster</p>
<p>by willingly participating in more repetitions</p>
<p>of the skill learning.</p>
<p>Meaning you will want to do more repetitions</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re getting it wrong some or most of the time.</p>
<p>So the experiment that I want to tell you about</p>
<p>is called the tube test.</p>
<p>And this is generally done in mice</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s sometimes been done in rats</p>
<p>and it has a lot of parallels to some things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve probably seen and experienced</p>
<p>even in human life, in regular life,</p>
<p>maybe even in your life.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the experiment.</p>
<p>You take two rats, you put them in a tube</p>
<p>or two mice, you put them in a tube</p>
<p>and mice and rats, they don&rsquo;t like to share the same tube.</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;ll do is they&rsquo;ll start pushing each other</p>
<p>back and forth, back and forth.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, one of the rats or mice</p>
<p>pushes the other one out.</p>
<p>The one that got pushed out is the loser.</p>
<p>The one that gets the tube is the winner.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Now you take the winner, you give it a new competitor.</p>
<p>And what you find is that the mouse or rat</p>
<p>that won previously has a much higher</p>
<p>than chance probability of winning the second time.</p>
<p>In other words, winning before leads to winning again.</p>
<p>And the reverse is also true.</p>
<p>If you take the loser and you put that loser</p>
<p>in with another mouse, fresh mouse, new mouse,</p>
<p>the loser typically will lose</p>
<p>at much greater probability than chance.</p>
<p>And this is not related to differences in strength</p>
<p>or size or testosterone or any other of the things</p>
<p>that might leap to mind as explanations for this</p>
<p>because those were all controlled for.</p>
<p>Now, that result had been known about for decades,</p>
<p>but three years ago, there was a paper published</p>
<p>in the journal Science, phenomenal journal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the three apex journals</p>
<p>that examined the brain area that&rsquo;s involved in this.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s a particular area of the frontal cortex</p>
<p>for those of you that want to know.</p>
<p>And they did a simple experiment</p>
<p>where the experimenters increased or decreased</p>
<p>the activity of this brain area in the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>a little sub-region of the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And what they found is if they stimulated this brain area,</p>
<p>a mouse or rat, regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>it had been a winner or loser before,</p>
<p>became a winner every single time.</p>
<p>And they showed that if they blocked the activity</p>
<p>of this brain area, regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>the mouse or rat had been a winner or a loser,</p>
<p>it became a loser every single time.</p>
<p>And this translated to other scenarios,</p>
<p>other competitive scenarios where they&rsquo;d put a bunch</p>
<p>of mice or rats in a kind of cool chamber.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d have a little heat lamp in the corner</p>
<p>and mice like heat.</p>
<p>And there was only enough space for one mouse</p>
<p>to be under the heat.</p>
<p>And the one that had won in the tube test</p>
<p>or that had the brain area stimulated</p>
<p>always got the nice warm spot.</p>
<p>Okay, so what is this magic brain area?</p>
<p>What is it doing?</p>
<p>Well, the reason I&rsquo;m bringing this up today</p>
<p>and the reason I&rsquo;m bringing it up on the heels</p>
<p>of the Super Mario effect is that stimulation</p>
<p>of this brain area had a very simple</p>
<p>and very important effect,</p>
<p>which was it led to more forward steps,</p>
<p>more repetitions, more effort,</p>
<p>but not in terms of sheer might and will,</p>
<p>not digging deeper, just more repetitions per unit time.</p>
<p>And the losers had fewer repetitions per unit time.</p>
<p>So the Super Mario effect, this online experiment</p>
<p>and the tube test, which has been done by various labs</p>
<p>and repeated again and again,</p>
<p>point to a simple but very important rule,</p>
<p>which is neither the 10,000 hours rule</p>
<p>nor the magic wand Hollywood version of learning,</p>
<p>but rather the neurobiological explanation</p>
<p>for learning a skill is you want to perform</p>
<p>as many repetitions per unit time as you possibly can,</p>
<p>at least when you&rsquo;re first trying to learn a skill.</p>
<p>I want to repeat that.</p>
<p>You want to perform as many repetitions as you possibly can,</p>
<p>at least when you&rsquo;re first trying to learn a skill.</p>
<p>Now that might sound like a duh, it&rsquo;s just more reps,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not so obvious.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why more repetitions</p>
<p>should necessarily lead to faster learning</p>
<p>because you could also say, well, more repetitions,</p>
<p>you can make more errors.</p>
<p>And those errors would lead to poor performance</p>
<p>like misstepping a number of times.</p>
<p>And in these cases, there&rsquo;s very little feedback, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like every time the rat pushes forward</p>
<p>or moves back that it is sensing, oh, I&rsquo;m winning,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing, I&rsquo;m winning, I&rsquo;m losing on a micro level.</p>
<p>It probably does that as it starts to push the other one out</p>
<p>the rat or mouse probably thinks, I&rsquo;m winning.</p>
<p>And as it&rsquo;s backing up, it probably thinks I&rsquo;m losing.</p>
<p>As you play the game, the Super Mario game,</p>
<p>you are told, nope, that didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Nope, that didn&rsquo;t work, please try again.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that the winners</p>
<p>are always generating more repetitions per unit time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a repeat of performance, repeat of performance,</p>
<p>even if there are errors.</p>
<p>And that points to something vitally important,</p>
<p>which is reps are important,</p>
<p>but making error reps is also important.</p>
<p>In fact, it might be the most important factor.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about errors</p>
<p>and why those solve the problem of what to focus on.</p>
<p>Because as I said earlier,</p>
<p>if you want to learn something,</p>
<p>you need to know if it&rsquo;s open loop or closed loop,</p>
<p>and you need to know what to focus on,</p>
<p>where to place your perception.</p>
<p>And that seems like a tough task,</p>
<p>but errors will tell you exactly what to focus on.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about errors and why you can leverage errors</p>
<p>to accelerate skill learning.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve established that performing</p>
<p>the maximum number of repetitions per training session</p>
<p>is going to be advantageous.</p>
<p>And that might seem obvious,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a shadowy side to that, which is,</p>
<p>well, why would I want to just repeat the same thing</p>
<p>over and over again if I&rsquo;m getting it wrong 90% of the time?</p>
<p>And the reason is that the errors</p>
<p>actually cue your nervous system to two things.</p>
<p>One, to error correction,</p>
<p>and the other is it opens the door</p>
<p>or the window for neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous system&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to change in response to experience,</p>
<p>essentially to custom modify itself</p>
<p>in order to perform anything better.</p>
<p>We did an entire month on neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>and I talked a little bit about errors</p>
<p>and why they&rsquo;re important.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to make this very concrete</p>
<p>and operationalize it, make it very actionable.</p>
<p>There was a paper that was published in 2021</p>
<p>from Norman et al.</p>
<p>This is a very important paper.</p>
<p>It was published in the journal Neuron,</p>
<p>which is a cell press journal, excellent journal.</p>
<p>The title of the paper gives it away essentially,</p>
<p>which is, post-error recruitment</p>
<p>of frontal sensory cortical projections promotes attention.</p>
<p>Now, what that says is that when you make an error,</p>
<p>it causes an activation of the brain areas</p>
<p>that anchor your attention.</p>
<p>Remember, we need perception, attention,</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>We need proprioception,</p>
<p>and we need the upper and lower motor neurons</p>
<p>to communicate in the proper ways.</p>
<p>And this vital question is what to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Errors tell your nervous system</p>
<p>that something needs to change.</p>
<p>So if you are performing a task or a skill,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re learning how to dance</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re stepping on the other person&rsquo;s toes</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re fumbling or you&rsquo;re not getting it right,</p>
<p>those errors are opening the possibility for plasticity.</p>
<p>If you walk away at that point,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve made the exact wrong choice, okay?</p>
<p>Unless the errors are somehow hazardous to your health</p>
<p>or somebody else&rsquo;s wellbeing,</p>
<p>you want to continue to engage at a high repetition rate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really where the learning is possible.</p>
<p>Without errors, the brain is not in a position</p>
<p>to change itself.</p>
<p>Errors actually cue the frontal cortex networks,</p>
<p>what we call top-down processing,</p>
<p>and the neuromodulators,</p>
<p>things like dopamine and acetylcholine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>that will allow for plasticity.</p>
<p>So while the Super Mario experiment, the maze experiment,</p>
<p>was only focused on generating errors,</p>
<p>telling people that wasn&rsquo;t right, please try again,</p>
<p>or that wasn&rsquo;t right, you lost five points,</p>
<p>the key distinction is that the errors themselves</p>
<p>cued people to the fact</p>
<p>that they needed to change something.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trying to learn a new skill</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re screwing up and you&rsquo;re making mistakes,</p>
<p>the more mistakes you make,</p>
<p>the more plastic your brain becomes,</p>
<p>such that when you get it right,</p>
<p>that correct pattern will be rewarded and consolidated.</p>
<p>And you can trust that it will</p>
<p>because the performance of something correctly</p>
<p>is associated with the release</p>
<p>of this neuromodulator dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is involved in craving and motivation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in a lot of things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also involved in learning.</p>
<p>We will do an entire episode on dopamine and learning,</p>
<p>but because some of you are probably wondering,</p>
<p>this does not mean that just increasing your dopamine levels</p>
<p>before learning will allow you to learn faster.</p>
<p>In fact, increasing your dopamine levels</p>
<p>before learning using pharmacology</p>
<p>will actually reduce what&rsquo;s called the signal to noise.</p>
<p>It will make these increases in dopamine</p>
<p>that pop up in your brain</p>
<p>that suddenly make you realize, ah, I got that one right.</p>
<p>It will make those smaller</p>
<p>relative to the background levels of dopamine, okay?</p>
<p>You want a big spike in dopamine</p>
<p>when you perform a motor pattern correctly,</p>
<p>and you want to make lots of errors,</p>
<p>many, many repetitions of errors</p>
<p>in order to get to that correct performance.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re like most people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do this in a way that&rsquo;s somewhat random,</p>
<p>meaning, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a tennis serve.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t play tennis.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve probably played tennis twice.</p>
<p>So if I throw the ball up in the air and hit it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get it wrong and probably hit the net.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m going to hit the net.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll probably go too long.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll probably go over the fence.</p>
<p>At some point, I like to think I&rsquo;ll get it correct.</p>
<p>The dopamine signal for that is going to be quite big.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll think, okay, what did I do there?</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention.</p>
<p>What I was paying attention to is whether or not</p>
<p>the ball went to the correct location</p>
<p>on the opposite side of the net.</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s an open loop move.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t actually know what I did correctly,</p>
<p>but your nervous system will take care of that</p>
<p>provided I, in this case,</p>
<p>complete more and more and more repetitions.</p>
<p>Now, if I were to just elevate my basal level of dopamine</p>
<p>by taking, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>1500 milligrams of L-tyrosine or something,</p>
<p>that would be bad because the increase in dopamine</p>
<p>would actually be much lower, right?</p>
<p>We would say the delta is smaller.</p>
<p>The signal to noise is smaller</p>
<p>if my overall levels of dopamine are very, very high.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually going to learn less well.</p>
<p>So for skill learning, motor skill learning,</p>
<p>increasing your dopamine levels prior is not a good idea.</p>
<p>It might help with motivation to get to the learning,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not going to improve the plasticity process itself</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s likely to hinder it, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>So these errors cue the brain that something was wrong</p>
<p>and they open up the possibility for plasticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s sometimes called the framing effect.</p>
<p>It frames what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And so I think this is a shift.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard about, you know, growth mindset,</p>
<p>which is the incredible discovery and theory and practice</p>
<p>of my colleague, Carol Dweck at Stanford.</p>
<p>This is distinct from that, right?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about motivation to learn.</p>
<p>This is about how you actually learn.</p>
<p>So the key is designate a particular block of time</p>
<p>that you are going to perform repetitions.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s 30 minutes, maybe that&rsquo;s an hour.</p>
<p>Work for time and then try and perform</p>
<p>the maximum number of repetitions that you can do safely</p>
<p>for you and others per unit time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be the best way</p>
<p>to approach learning for most sessions.</p>
<p>I will talk about other things that one can do,</p>
<p>but making errors is key.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t a motivational speech.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying, oh, go make errors.</p>
<p>Errors are good for you.</p>
<p>You have to fail in order to win.</p>
<p>No, you have to fail in order to open up</p>
<p>the possibility of plasticity,</p>
<p>but you have to fail many times within the same session.</p>
<p>And those failures will cue your attention</p>
<p>to the appropriate sensory events.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes we&rsquo;re working with a coach.</p>
<p>And so this is a shout out to all the coaches.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing what you do.</p>
<p>However, there needs to be,</p>
<p>at least what the scientific literature say,</p>
<p>there needs to be a period of each training session</p>
<p>whereby the athlete or the person of any kind</p>
<p>can simply pay attention to their errors</p>
<p>without their attention being cued to something else.</p>
<p>A really well-trained coach will say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, your elbow is swinging too high</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not gripping the racket</p>
<p>in the appropriate way, et cetera.</p>
<p>They can see things that the practitioner can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>And of course that&rsquo;s vitally important.</p>
<p>But the practitioner also needs</p>
<p>to use this error recognition signal.</p>
<p>They need to basically focus on something</p>
<p>and the errors are going to tell them what to focus on.</p>
<p>So put simply, there needs to be a period of time</p>
<p>in which it&rsquo;s just repetition</p>
<p>after repetition, after repetition.</p>
<p>I think many people, including coaches,</p>
<p>are afraid that bad habits will get ingrained.</p>
<p>And while indeed that&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important that these errors occur</p>
<p>in order to cue the attentional systems</p>
<p>and to open the door for plasticity.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m told, look, you know, I&rsquo;m standing a little wide,</p>
<p>I need to tighten up my stance a little bit, great.</p>
<p>But then I need to generate many repetitions</p>
<p>from that tightened stance, okay?</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m constantly being cued from the outside</p>
<p>about what I&rsquo;m doing incorrectly,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to be as efficient, okay?</p>
<p>So for some people,</p>
<p>these learning sessions might be 10 minutes.</p>
<p>For some people, it might be an hour.</p>
<p>Whatever you can allocate,</p>
<p>because your lifestyles will vary</p>
<p>and whether or not you&rsquo;re a professional athlete,</p>
<p>et cetera, will vary.</p>
<p>You want to get the maximum number of repetitions in</p>
<p>and you want to make errors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s allowing for plasticity.</p>
<p>So science points to the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a particular sequencing of learning sessions</p>
<p>that will allow you to learn faster</p>
<p>and to retain the skill learning.</p>
<p>And it involves doing exactly as I just described,</p>
<p>which is getting as many repetitions as you can</p>
<p>in the learning session,</p>
<p>paying attention to the errors that you make,</p>
<p>and then the rewards that will be generated,</p>
<p>again, these are neurochemical rewards,</p>
<p>from the successful performance of a movement</p>
<p>or the approximate successful performance.</p>
<p>So maybe you get the golf swing better, but not perfect,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s still going to be rewarded</p>
<p>with this neurochemical mechanism.</p>
<p>And then after the session,</p>
<p>you need to do something very specific, which is nothing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There are beautiful data describing neurons</p>
<p>in our hippocampus, this area of our brain involved</p>
<p>in the consolidation of new memories.</p>
<p>Those data point to the fact that in sleep,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a replay of the sequence of neurons</p>
<p>that were involved in certain behaviors the previous day,</p>
<p>and sometimes the previous day before that.</p>
<p>However, there are also data that show</p>
<p>that after a skill learning session,</p>
<p>any kind of motor movement,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re not bringing in</p>
<p>a lot more additional new sensory stimuli,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a replay of the motor sequence</p>
<p>that you performed correctly,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an elimination of the motor sequences</p>
<p>that you performed incorrectly,</p>
<p>and they are run backward in time.</p>
<p>Okay, so to be very clear about this,</p>
<p>if I were to learn a new skill or navigate a new city,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s just stay with the motor skill,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the free throw or a golf swing or a tennis serve,</p>
<p>dance move, novice, so I&rsquo;m still going to make</p>
<p>a lot of errors, don&rsquo;t get it perfectly,</p>
<p>but maybe I get a little bit better</p>
<p>or I perform it correctly three times out of 1,000,</p>
<p>that sounds like something I might do,</p>
<p>and there I&rsquo;m probably being generous to myself.</p>
<p>After I finished the training session,</p>
<p>if I do nothing, I&rsquo;m not focused on some additional learning,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not bringing a lot of sensory information in,</p>
<p>if I just sit there and close my eyes</p>
<p>for five to 10 minutes, even one minute,</p>
<p>the brain starts to replay the motor sequence</p>
<p>corresponding to the correct pattern of movement,</p>
<p>but it plays that sequence backward.</p>
<p>Now, why it plays it backward, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If I were to wait until sleep or regardless,</p>
<p>when I sleep later that night,</p>
<p>the sequence will be replayed forwards</p>
<p>in the proper sequence.</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, it&rsquo;s played backward</p>
<p>for reasons that are still unclear,</p>
<p>but the replay of that sequence backwards</p>
<p>appears to be important for the consolidation</p>
<p>of the skill learning.</p>
<p>Now, this is important because many people</p>
<p>are finishing their jujitsu class</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re finishing their yoga class</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re finishing their dance class</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re finishing some skill learning,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re immediately devoting their attention</p>
<p>to something else.</p>
<p>You hear a lot about visualization</p>
<p>and we are going to talk about visualization,</p>
<p>but in the kind of obsession with the idea</p>
<p>that we can learn things just sitting there</p>
<p>with our eyes closed without having to perform a movement,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve overlooked something perhaps even more important</p>
<p>or at least equally important,</p>
<p>which is after skill learning,</p>
<p>after putting effort into something,</p>
<p>sitting quietly with the eyes closed</p>
<p>for one to five to 10 minutes</p>
<p>allows the brain to replay the sequence</p>
<p>in a way that appears important</p>
<p>for the more rapid consolidation</p>
<p>of the motor sequence of the pattern</p>
<p>and to accelerated learning.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about this,</p>
<p>this is not work that I was involved in,</p>
<p>I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an excellent paper that covers this and much more</p>
<p>for those of you that really want to dive deep on this,</p>
<p>and we will dive deeper in a moment.</p>
<p>This is a review that was published in the journal Neuron,</p>
<p>excellent journal.</p>
<p>Many of the papers that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>were covered in this review,</p>
<p>which is titled,</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity Subserving Motor Skill Learning</p>
<p>by Dayan, D-A-Y-A-N,</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;m not butchering the pronunciation,</p>
<p>and Cohen by Leonard Cohen,</p>
<p>but not the Leonard Cohen most of us are familiar with,</p>
<p>the musician Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p>Dayan and Cohen,</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity Subserving Motor Skill Learning.</p>
<p>And this was published in 2011,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ve been a number of updates</p>
<p>and the literature that I&rsquo;ve described</p>
<p>in other portions of today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>come from the more recent literature,</p>
<p>such as the more recent 2021 paper, okay?</p>
<p>So you have this basic learning session</p>
<p>and then a period of time afterwards</p>
<p>in which the brain can rehearse what it just did.</p>
<p>We hear so much about mental rehearsal,</p>
<p>and we always think about mental rehearsal</p>
<p>as the thing you do before you train or instead of training,</p>
<p>but this is rehearsal that&rsquo;s done afterward</p>
<p>where the brain is just automatically scripting</p>
<p>through the sequence,</p>
<p>and for some reason that&rsquo;s still not clear</p>
<p>as to why this would be the case, it runs backward.</p>
<p>Then in sleep, it runs forwards,</p>
<p>and certainly, absolutely, sleep and quality sleep</p>
<p>of the appropriate duration, et cetera,</p>
<p>is going to be important for learning of all kinds,</p>
<p>including skill learning.</p>
<p>We did an entire four episodes on sleep</p>
<p>and how to get better at sleeping.</p>
<p>Those are the episodes back in January,</p>
<p>episodes essentially one, two, three, and four,</p>
<p>and maybe even episode five, I don&rsquo;t recall,</p>
<p>but you can go there to find out</p>
<p>all about how to get better at sleeping.</p>
<p>Now, there are other training sessions involved, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to learn the perfect golf swing</p>
<p>or the tennis serve or how to dance in one session,</p>
<p>and I doubt you will either.</p>
<p>So the question is when to come back</p>
<p>and what to do when you come back to the training session.</p>
<p>Now, first of all,</p>
<p>this principle of errors cuing attention</p>
<p>and opening the opportunity for plasticity,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s never going to change.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be true for somebody who is hyperskilled,</p>
<p>who has mastery or even virtuosity in a given skill, right?</p>
<p>Remember, when you&rsquo;re unskilled at something,</p>
<p>uncertainty is very high.</p>
<p>As you become more skilled, certainty goes up, right?</p>
<p>Then eventually you achieve levels of mastery</p>
<p>where certainty is very, very high</p>
<p>about your ability to perform,</p>
<p>yours, certainty, and that of other people.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this fourth category of virtuosity</p>
<p>where somebody, maybe you,</p>
<p>invites uncertainty back into the practice</p>
<p>because only with that uncertainty</p>
<p>can you express your full range of abilities,</p>
<p>which you aren&rsquo;t even aware of</p>
<p>until uncertainty comes into the picture, right?</p>
<p>I happen to have the great privilege</p>
<p>of being friends with Laird Hamilton,</p>
<p>the big wave surfer who&rsquo;s phenomenal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t surf.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t surf with Laird,</p>
<p>but he and another guy that he surfs with, Luka Padua,</p>
<p>these guys are, they&rsquo;re virtuosos at surfing.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t just want the wave that they can master,</p>
<p>they want uncertainty.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re at the point in their practice</p>
<p>where when uncertainty shows up,</p>
<p>like a wave that&rsquo;s either so big</p>
<p>or is moving in a particular way</p>
<p>that it brings an element of uncertainty for them</p>
<p>about what they&rsquo;re going to do,</p>
<p>they recognize that as the opportunity</p>
<p>to perform better than they would otherwise, okay?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re actually trying to eliminate uncertainty.</p>
<p>At the beginning of learning any skill</p>
<p>and as we approach from uncertain to skilled to mastery,</p>
<p>we want to reduce uncertainty.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what the nervous system is doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to eliminate errors</p>
<p>and hone in on the correct trajectories.</p>
<p>If you perform a lot of repetitions</p>
<p>and then you use a period immediately after,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really have a name for this.</p>
<p>Maybe someone will come up with it</p>
<p>and put it in the comment section if you&rsquo;re on YouTube,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re watching this on YouTube,</p>
<p>a name for this post-learning kind of idle time</p>
<p>for the brain.</p>
<p>The brain isn&rsquo;t idle at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually scripting all these things in reverse</p>
<p>that allow for deeper learning and more quick learning.</p>
<p>But if we fill that time with other things,</p>
<p>if we are focused on our phones</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re focused on learning something else,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re focusing on our performance,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to serve us well.</p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s not going to serve the skill learning well.</p>
<p>So please, if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in more rapid skill learning,</p>
<p>try introducing these sessions.</p>
<p>They can be quite powerful.</p>
<p>And then on subsequent sessions,</p>
<p>presumably after a night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re doing two sessions a day,</p>
<p>although two sessions a day is going to be a lot</p>
<p>for most people, unless you&rsquo;re a professional</p>
<p>or a high-level athlete.</p>
<p>The subsequent sessions are where you get to express</p>
<p>the gains of the previous session, right?</p>
<p>Where you get to perform well,</p>
<p>presumably more often, even if it&rsquo;s just subtle,</p>
<p>sometimes there&rsquo;ll be a decrease in performance,</p>
<p>but most often you&rsquo;re going to perform better</p>
<p>on subsequent and subsequent training sessions.</p>
<p>And there is the opportunity to devote attention</p>
<p>in very specific ways, right?</p>
<p>Not just let the errors inform you</p>
<p>where to place your attention,</p>
<p>but rather to direct your perception</p>
<p>to particular elements of the movement</p>
<p>in order to accelerate learning further, okay?</p>
<p>So to be very clear,</p>
<p>because I know many of you are interested</p>
<p>in concrete protocols,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just that you would only let errors</p>
<p>cue your attention on the first session.</p>
<p>You might do that for one session or five sessions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;re familiar with something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re performing it well every once in a while,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re accomplishing it better every once in a while,</p>
<p>then you can start to cue your attention</p>
<p>in very deliberate ways.</p>
<p>And the question therefore becomes</p>
<p>what to cue your attention to.</p>
<p>And the good news is it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful set of experiments that have been done</p>
<p>looking at sequences of keys being played on a piano.</p>
<p>This is work that was published just a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>There are actually several papers now</p>
<p>that are focused on this.</p>
<p>One of them was published in 2018.</p>
<p>This is from Claudia Lappe and colleagues, L-A-P-P-E.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s done some really nice work,</p>
<p>which talks about the influence of pitch feedback</p>
<p>on learning of motor timing and sequencing.</p>
<p>And this was done with piano,</p>
<p>but it carries over to athletic performance as well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to describe this study to you.</p>
<p>But before I describe it,</p>
<p>what is so interesting about this study</p>
<p>that I want you to know about</p>
<p>is that it turns out it doesn&rsquo;t matter so much</p>
<p>what you pay attention to during the learning sequence,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s something related to the motor behavior</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re performing, right?</p>
<p>That seems incredible, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good at a tennis serve.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;ve done, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a thousand repetitions of the tennis serve,</p>
<p>maybe I got it right three to 10 times.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m being even more generous with myself.</p>
<p>And I do this post-training session</p>
<p>where I let my brain idle and I get some good sleep</p>
<p>and then I come back</p>
<p>and now I start generating errors again,</p>
<p>presumably or hopefully fewer errors,</p>
<p>but I decide I&rsquo;m going to cue my attention</p>
<p>to something very specific,</p>
<p>like maybe how tightly I&rsquo;m holding the racket,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s my stance,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s whether or not I rotate my right shoulder in</p>
<p>as I hit the ball across,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m making this up again, I don&rsquo;t play tennis.</p>
<p>Turns out that as long as it&rsquo;s the same thing</p>
<p>throughout the session, learning is accelerated.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll explain why this makes sense in a moment,</p>
<p>but just to be really clear,</p>
<p>you can and one should use your powers of attention</p>
<p>to direct your attention</p>
<p>to particular aspects of a motor movement</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re familiar with the general theme of the movement,</p>
<p>but what you pay attention to exactly is not important.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important is that you pay attention</p>
<p>to one specific thing.</p>
<p>So what Claudia Lape in college showed was that</p>
<p>if people are trying to learn a sequence of keys</p>
<p>on the piano, there are multiple forms of feedback.</p>
<p>There are error signals,</p>
<p>if for instance, they hear a piece of music</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re told to press the keys</p>
<p>in a particular sequence,</p>
<p>and the noise that comes out,</p>
<p>the sound that comes out of the piano</p>
<p>does not sound like the song they just heard, right?</p>
<p>So instead of, and here forgive me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m neither musical nor can I sing,</p>
<p>but instead of da-da-da-da-da-da,</p>
<p>they hear that da-da-da-da-da-da-da,</p>
<p>and then instead when they play,</p>
<p>or for me it would sound something like da-da-da-da-da-da,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t sound right, okay?</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t sound right</p>
<p>because I likely got the sequence wrong</p>
<p>or I was pressing too hard on the keys</p>
<p>or too lightly on the keys, et cetera.</p>
<p>What they showed was if they just instruct people</p>
<p>about the correct sequence to press on the keys,</p>
<p>it actually doesn&rsquo;t matter what sound comes back</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s the correct sound or it&rsquo;s the same sound.</p>
<p>All right, so here&rsquo;s the experiment.</p>
<p>They had people press on these keys</p>
<p>and it was a typical piano</p>
<p>and it generated the particular sequence of sounds</p>
<p>that would be generated by pressing the keys on the piano.</p>
<p>Or they modified the keyboard in this case or piano</p>
<p>such that when people pressed on the keys,</p>
<p>a random tone, different tones were played</p>
<p>each time they pressed on the keys.</p>
<p>So it sounded crazy, it sounded like noise,</p>
<p>but the motor sequence was the same.</p>
<p>Or they had a single tone</p>
<p>that was played every time they pressed a key</p>
<p>and the job or the task of the subject</p>
<p>was just to press the sequence,</p>
<p>press the keys in the proper sequence.</p>
<p>So instead of dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun,</p>
<p>it was just dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.</p>
<p>Instead of da-da-da-da-da-da-da,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s da-da-da-da-da-da-da.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even hard for me to say it in an even tone,</p>
<p>but you get the idea.</p>
<p>So a singular tone, just think a doorbell being rung</p>
<p>with each press of the key would be really annoying, okay?</p>
<p>But it turns out that the rate to motor learning</p>
<p>was the same whether or not they were getting feedback</p>
<p>that was accurate to the keys of the piano</p>
<p>or whether or not it was a constant tone.</p>
<p>Performance was terrible</p>
<p>and the rates of learning were terrible</p>
<p>if they were getting random tones back.</p>
<p>So what this means is that learning to play the piano,</p>
<p>at least at these early stages,</p>
<p>is really just about generating the motor commands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about paying attention to the sound</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming out of the piano.</p>
<p>And this makes sense because when we are beginners,</p>
<p>we are trying to focus our attention</p>
<p>on the things that we can control.</p>
<p>And if you think about this, if you conceptualize this,</p>
<p>pressing the keys on the piano</p>
<p>and paying attention to the sounds</p>
<p>that are coming out are two things.</p>
<p>So what this means is that as you get deeper</p>
<p>and deeper into a practice,</p>
<p>focusing purely on the motor execution can be beneficial.</p>
<p>Now, this is going to be harder to do</p>
<p>with open loop type things where you&rsquo;re getting feedback.</p>
<p>I guess a good example of open loop</p>
<p>would be the attempt at a backflip, right?</p>
<p>If you get it wrong, you will immediately know.</p>
<p>If you get it right, you&rsquo;ll immediately know.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t go out and try and do a backflip</p>
<p>on the solid ground or even on a trampoline</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>because very likely you&rsquo;ll get it wrong</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get injured.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s something that is closed loop</p>
<p>where you can repeat again and again and again and again,</p>
<p>that is advantageous</p>
<p>because you can perform many, many repetitions</p>
<p>and you can start to focus</p>
<p>or learn to focus your attention</p>
<p>just on the pattern of movement.</p>
<p>In other words, you can learn to play the piano</p>
<p>just as fast or maybe even faster</p>
<p>by just focusing on the sequence</p>
<p>that you are moving your digits,</p>
<p>your fingers and not the feedback.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure there are music teachers out there</p>
<p>and piano teachers that are screaming,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;re going to ruin the practice</p>
<p>that all of us have embedded in our minds</p>
<p>and in our students.</p>
<p>And I agree, at some point,</p>
<p>you need to start including feedback</p>
<p>about whether or not things sound correct.</p>
<p>But one of the beauties of skill learning</p>
<p>is that you can choose to parameterize it,</p>
<p>meaning you can choose to just focus on the motor sequence</p>
<p>or just focus on the sounds that are coming back</p>
<p>and then integrate those.</p>
<p>And so we hear a lot about chunking,</p>
<p>about breaking things down into their component parts.</p>
<p>But one of the biggest challenges for skill learning</p>
<p>is knowing where to place your attention.</p>
<p>So to dial out again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re building a protocol across this episode,</p>
<p>early sessions, maybe it&rsquo;s the first one,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s the first 10, maybe it&rsquo;s the first 100.</p>
<p>It depends on how many repetitions you&rsquo;re packing in.</p>
<p>But during those initial sessions,</p>
<p>the key is to make many errors,</p>
<p>to let the reward process govern the plasticity,</p>
<p>let the errors open the plasticity.</p>
<p>And then after the learning sessions,</p>
<p>to let the brain go idle,</p>
<p>at least for a short period of time.</p>
<p>And of course, to maximize sleep.</p>
<p>As you start incorporating more sessions,</p>
<p>you start to gain some skill level.</p>
<p>Learning to harness and focus your attention</p>
<p>on particular features of the movement,</p>
<p>independent of the rewards and the feedback, right?</p>
<p>So the reward is no longer in the tone</p>
<p>coming from the piano,</p>
<p>or whether or not you struck the target correctly,</p>
<p>but simply the motor movement.</p>
<p>Focusing your, for instance, in a dart throw</p>
<p>on the action of your arm,</p>
<p>that is embedding the plasticity</p>
<p>in the motor pattern most deeply.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been shown by the scientific literature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are coaches and teachers out there</p>
<p>that will entirely disagree with me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you prefer.</p>
<p>Let me know where you think this is wrong.</p>
<p>And it rarely happens,</p>
<p>but let me know where you think</p>
<p>this might be right as well.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re breaking the learning process</p>
<p>down into its component parts.</p>
<p>As we get more and more skilled,</p>
<p>meaning as we make fewer and fewer errors</p>
<p>per a given session per unit time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when attention can start to migrate</p>
<p>from one feature, such as the motor sequence,</p>
<p>to another feature, which is perhaps one&rsquo;s stance.</p>
<p>And another component of the sequence,</p>
<p>which would be the result that&rsquo;s one getting</p>
<p>on a trial to trial basis, right?</p>
<p>So changing it up each time.</p>
<p>So maybe I serve the tennis ball</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m focusing on where the ball lands.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m focusing on the speed.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m focusing on my grip.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m focusing on my stance from trial to trial.</p>
<p>But until we&rsquo;ve mastered the core motor movements,</p>
<p>which is done session to session,</p>
<p>that, at least according to the literature</p>
<p>that I have access to here, seems to be suboptimal.</p>
<p>So hopefully this is starting to make sense,</p>
<p>which is that these connections between upper motor neurons,</p>
<p>lower motor neurons, and central pattern generators,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t attack them all at once.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t try and change them all at once.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re breaking things down</p>
<p>into their component parts.</p>
<p>Some of you may be wondering about speed of movement.</p>
<p>There are some data, meaning some decent papers out there,</p>
<p>showing that ultra slow movements,</p>
<p>performing a movement essentially in slow motion,</p>
<p>can be beneficial for enhancing the rate of skill learning.</p>
<p>However, at least from my read of the literature,</p>
<p>it appears that ultra slow movements should be performed</p>
<p>after some degree of proficiency has already been gained</p>
<p>in that particular movement.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not the way I would have thought about it.</p>
<p>I would have thought, well, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re learning how to do a proper kick</p>
<p>or a punch in martial arts</p>
<p>or something that ultra slow movements at first</p>
<p>are going to be the way that one can, you know,</p>
<p>best learn how to perform a movement.</p>
<p>And then you just gradually increase the speed.</p>
<p>And it turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>And I probably should have known that.</p>
<p>And you should probably know that</p>
<p>because it turns out that when you do ultra slow movements,</p>
<p>two things aren&rsquo;t available to you.</p>
<p>One is the proprioceptive feedback is not accurate</p>
<p>because fast movements of limbs are very different</p>
<p>than slow movements of limbs.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t get the opportunity</p>
<p>to build in the proprioceptive feedback.</p>
<p>But the other reason why it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s too accurate.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t generate errors.</p>
<p>And so the data that I was able to find</p>
<p>showed that very slow movements can be beneficial</p>
<p>if one is already proficient in a practice,</p>
<p>but very slow movements at the beginning</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t allow you to learn more quickly</p>
<p>because you never generate errors.</p>
<p>And therefore the brain doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not open for change.</p>
<p>The window for plasticity is never swung open, so to speak.</p>
<p>So brings us back to this theme</p>
<p>that errors allow for plasticity,</p>
<p>correct performance of movements</p>
<p>or semi-correct performance of movements</p>
<p>cues the synapses in the brain areas</p>
<p>and spinal circuits that need to change.</p>
<p>And then those changes occur in the period</p>
<p>immediately after skill learning and in sleep.</p>
<p>So super slow movements can be beneficial</p>
<p>once you already have some proficiency.</p>
<p>So this might be standing in your living room</p>
<p>and just in ultra slow motion,</p>
<p>performing your tennis serve,</p>
<p>learning to or thinking about how you&rsquo;re adjusting</p>
<p>your elbow and your arm and the trajectory</p>
<p>exactly how you were taught by your tennis coach.</p>
<p>But trying to learn it that way from the outset</p>
<p>does not appear to be the best way to learn a skill.</p>
<p>When should you start to introduce slow learning?</p>
<p>Well, obviously talk to your coaches about this,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re doing this recreationally</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t have a coach,</p>
<p>I realize many of you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a coach for anything that I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just navigating it</p>
<p>by using the scientific literature.</p>
<p>It appears that once you&rsquo;re hitting success rates</p>
<p>of about 25 or 30%,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the super slow movements</p>
<p>can start to be beneficial.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re still performing things at a rate of,</p>
<p>you know, five or 10% correct and the rest are errors,</p>
<p>then the super slow movements</p>
<p>are probably not going to benefit you that much.</p>
<p>Also, super slow movements are not really applicable</p>
<p>to a lot of things.</p>
<p>For instance, you could imagine throwing a dart</p>
<p>super slow motion,</p>
<p>but if you actually try and throw an actual dart,</p>
<p>the dart&rsquo;s just going to fall to the floor, obviously.</p>
<p>So there are a number of things like, you know,</p>
<p>baseball bat swing,</p>
<p>which you can practice in super slow motion.</p>
<p>But if you try and do that with an actual baseball</p>
<p>or softball or something like that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to give you any kind of feedback</p>
<p>about how effective it was.</p>
<p>So super slow movements or a decelerated movement</p>
<p>has its place,</p>
<p>but once you&rsquo;re already performing things reasonably well,</p>
<p>like maybe 25 to 30% success rate.</p>
<p>You know, and I&rsquo;ve tried this.</p>
<p>I actually, I struggle with basketball for whatever reason,</p>
<p>and my free throw is terrible.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve practiced free throws in super slow motion</p>
<p>and I nail them every time.</p>
<p>The problem is there&rsquo;s no ball.</p>
<p>Some of you already have a fair degree of proficiency</p>
<p>of skill in a given practice or sport or instrument.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re in this sort of advanced intermediate</p>
<p>or advanced levels of proficiency for something,</p>
<p>there is a practice that you can find interesting data for</p>
<p>in the literature, which involves metronoming.</p>
<p>So this you&rsquo;ll realize relates to generating repetitions</p>
<p>and it relates to the tone experiment</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>what your attention is cued to,</p>
<p>as long as you are performing many, many reps</p>
<p>of the motor sequence.</p>
<p>You can use a metronome and obviously musicians do this,</p>
<p>but athletes can do this too.</p>
<p>You can use a metronome to set the cadence</p>
<p>of your repetitions.</p>
<p>Now for swimmers, there&rsquo;s actually a device</p>
<p>I was able to find online.</p>
<p>I forget what the brand name was</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not what this is about,</p>
<p>but that actually goes in the swim cap</p>
<p>that can cue you to when you need</p>
<p>to perform another stroke.</p>
<p>And for runners, there are other metronome type devices</p>
<p>that through headphones or through a tone in the room,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re running indoors or on a treadmill,</p>
<p>will cue you to when you basically</p>
<p>you need to lift your heels.</p>
<p>And if you do that, what athletes find</p>
<p>is they can perform more repetitions,</p>
<p>they can generate more output, you can increase speed.</p>
<p>A number of really interesting things are being done</p>
<p>with auditory metronoming.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m involved in a little bit of work now</p>
<p>that hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to report back to you</p>
<p>about using stroboscopic metronoming.</p>
<p>So actually changing the speed of the visual environment.</p>
<p>These are fun experiments,</p>
<p>basically changing one&rsquo;s perception</p>
<p>of how fast they&rsquo;re moving through space</p>
<p>by playing with the visual system,</p>
<p>something for a future discussion.</p>
<p>But you can start to use auditory metronoming</p>
<p>for generating more movements per unit time</p>
<p>and generating more errors and therefore more successes</p>
<p>and more neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>There are a number of different apps out there.</p>
<p>I found several free apps</p>
<p>where you can set in a metronome pace.</p>
<p>So it might be tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little fast for most things,</p>
<p>but you can imagine if this were darts</p>
<p>or this were golf swings,</p>
<p>that it might be tick, tick, tick, tick,</p>
<p>or something more like tick, tick.</p>
<p>And every time the metronome goes, you swing.</p>
<p>Every time the metronome goes, you throw a dart.</p>
<p>There are actually some wild experiments out there.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a world championship of cup stacking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a young lady who I saw could take</p>
<p>all these cups spread out on a table</p>
<p>and basically just stack them into the perfect pyramid</p>
<p>and the least amount of times all the kids go wild.</p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;d never thought to pursue</p>
<p>and frankly never will pursue</p>
<p>unless my life depends on it for some reason,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really impressive.</p>
<p>And if you look at the sequence,</p>
<p>because these have been recorded,</p>
<p>you can look this up on YouTube.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll find is that these expert cup stackers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just all about error elimination.</p>
<p>But there too, metronoming and auditory cues</p>
<p>can actually cue them to pick up the cups</p>
<p>faster than they would ordinarily and to learn to do that.</p>
<p>You can do this for anything.</p>
<p>I think cup stacking is probably not a skill</p>
<p>most of you are interested in doing,</p>
<p>but for any skill, if you figure out</p>
<p>at what rate you are performing repetitions per unit time</p>
<p>and you want to increase that slightly,</p>
<p>you set a metronome,</p>
<p>which is slightly faster than your current rate</p>
<p>and you just start generating more repetitions.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about this and is cool</p>
<p>is it relates back to the experiment</p>
<p>from Lappe and colleagues,</p>
<p>which is your attention is now harnessed to the tone,</p>
<p>to the metronome,</p>
<p>not necessarily to what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>in terms of the motor movement.</p>
<p>And so really you need a bit of proficiency.</p>
<p>Again, this is for people who are intermediate</p>
<p>or advanced, intermediate or advanced.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re essentially doing</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re creating an outside pressure, a contingency,</p>
<p>so that you generate again, more errors.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all about the errors that you get.</p>
<p>Now, these aren&rsquo;t errors where all the cups tumble</p>
<p>or you have to stop or you can&rsquo;t keep up.</p>
<p>You have to set the pace just a little bit</p>
<p>beyond what you currently can do.</p>
<p>And when you do that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially forcing the nervous system</p>
<p>to make errors and correct the errors</p>
<p>inside of the session.</p>
<p>I find this really interesting</p>
<p>because what it means is again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got sensory perception,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re paying attention to,</p>
<p>proprioception, where your limbs are</p>
<p>and the motor neurons in your upper,</p>
<p>lower motor neurons and central pattern generators.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re my upper motor neurons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re my lower motor neurons.</p>
<p>Forget that, you&rsquo;re not going to do that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t pay attention to your proprioception too much.</p>
<p>That would be the super slow motion</p>
<p>would be the proprioception.</p>
<p>But you have to harness your attention to something.</p>
<p>And if you harness your attention</p>
<p>to this outside contingency,</p>
<p>this metronome that&rsquo;s firing off and saying,</p>
<p>now, go, now, go, now, go.</p>
<p>Not only can you increase the number of repetitions,</p>
<p>errors and successes, but for some reason,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>but the regular cadence of the tone of the metronome</p>
<p>and the fact that you are anchoring your movements</p>
<p>to some external force, to some external pressure or cue</p>
<p>seems to accelerate the plasticity</p>
<p>and the changes and the acquisition of skills</p>
<p>beyond what it would be</p>
<p>if you just did the same number of repetitions</p>
<p>without that outside pressure.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly what the mechanism is.</p>
<p>Presumably it&rsquo;s neurochemical.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something about keeping up with a timer</p>
<p>or with a pace that presumably, and I&rsquo;m speculating here,</p>
<p>causes the release of particular chemicals.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>Metronomes, they&rsquo;re totally inexpensive.</p>
<p>At least the ones that you use outside of water</p>
<p>are very inexpensive.</p>
<p>You can find these free apps.</p>
<p>You can use a musical metronome.</p>
<p>So metronomes are a powerful tool as well,</p>
<p>in particular for speed work.</p>
<p>So for sprinting or swimming or running</p>
<p>where the goal is to generate more strokes</p>
<p>or more efficient strokes or more steps, et cetera,</p>
<p>the rate of the metronome, obviously,</p>
<p>is going to be very important.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re trying to lengthen your stride.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re trying to take fewer strokes</p>
<p>but glide further in the pool, for instance.</p>
<p>But the value of occasionally</p>
<p>just increasing the number of repetitions,</p>
<p>the number of strokes or steps, et cetera, per unit time</p>
<p>is also that you&rsquo;re training the central pattern generators</p>
<p>to operate at that higher speed.</p>
<p>One of the sports that&rsquo;s kind of interesting to me</p>
<p>is speed walking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not one I engage in or ever plan to engage in.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve ever tried to really speed walk,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually difficult to walk very, very fast</p>
<p>without breaking into a run.</p>
<p>All animals have these kind of crossover points</p>
<p>where you go, you know, I think of horses,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, what is it?</p>
<p>They trot, then they gallop.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the next thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about horses</p>
<p>except that they&rsquo;re beautiful and I like them very much.</p>
<p>But they break into a different kind of stride.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because you shift over</p>
<p>to different central pattern generators.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re walking or a horse is moving very slowly</p>
<p>and then it breaks into a jog and then into a full sprint</p>
<p>or I got to get gallop for the horse,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually engaging</p>
<p>different central pattern generators.</p>
<p>And those central pattern generators</p>
<p>always have a range of speeds</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re happiest to function at.</p>
<p>So with the metronoming for speed purposes,</p>
<p>what you do is you can basically bring the activity</p>
<p>of those central pattern generators</p>
<p>into their upper, upper range</p>
<p>and maybe even extend their range.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a fascinating biology</p>
<p>of how central pattern generators work together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s coupling of central pattern generators, et cetera,</p>
<p>in order to achieve maximal speeds and et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a topic for kind of an advanced session.</p>
<p>Costello loves this topic.</p>
<p>He just barked and he loves it so much he barked again.</p>
<p>In any event, the metronome is a powerful tool,</p>
<p>again, for more advanced practitioners</p>
<p>or for advanced intermediate practitioners.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting because it brings back the point</p>
<p>that what we put our attention to</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re skill learning is important</p>
<p>to the extent that it&rsquo;s on one thing,</p>
<p>at least for the moment or trial to trial,</p>
<p>but that what we focus our attention on can be external,</p>
<p>it can be internal,</p>
<p>and ultimately the skill learning</p>
<p>is where all that is brought together.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about where skill learning occurs</p>
<p>in the nervous system.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to give you a really,</p>
<p>what I think is a really cool tool</p>
<p>that can increase flexibility and a range of motion</p>
<p>based on this particular brain area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tool that I used.</p>
<p>And when I first heard about it,</p>
<p>I did not believe would work.</p>
<p>This is not a hack.</p>
<p>This is actually anchored deeply in the biology</p>
<p>of a particular brain region that we all have,</p>
<p>whose meaning is mini brain.</p>
<p>And that mini brain that we all have</p>
<p>is called your cerebellum.</p>
<p>The cerebellum is called the mini brain</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in the back of your brain.</p>
<p>It looks like a little mini version</p>
<p>of the rest of your brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolutely incredible structure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in movement.</p>
<p>It also has a lot of non-movement associated functions.</p>
<p>In brief, the cerebellum gets input from your senses,</p>
<p>in particular your eyes,</p>
<p>and pays attention to where your eyes are in space,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>It basically takes information about three aspects</p>
<p>of your eyes and eye movements,</p>
<p>which are occurring when your head goes like this,</p>
<p>which is called pitch.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is pitch.</p>
<p>For those of you that are listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just nodding up and down.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s yaw, which is like shaking your head no</p>
<p>from side to side.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s roll,</p>
<p>which is like sometimes if you see a primate,</p>
<p>like a marmoset or something,</p>
<p>they will roll their head when they look at you.</p>
<p>Actually, the reason they do that</p>
<p>is it helps generate depth perception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of form of motion parallax</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re curious why they do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to look cute.</p>
<p>They do it because when they do that,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re stationary and they&rsquo;re stationary,</p>
<p>they get better depth perception</p>
<p>as to how far away from them you are.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got pitch, yaw, and roll.</p>
<p>And as you move your head and as you move your body</p>
<p>and you move through space,</p>
<p>the image on your retina moves,</p>
<p>pitch, yaw, and roll in some combination.</p>
<p>That information is relayed to your cerebellum.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s rich with visual information.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a map of your body surface</p>
<p>and your movements and timing in the cerebellum.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an incredible structure</p>
<p>that brings together timing of movements,</p>
<p>which limbs are moving,</p>
<p>and has proprioceptive information.</p>
<p>It really is a mini brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the coolest little structure back there.</p>
<p>And in humans, it&rsquo;s actually not that little.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an incredible structure.</p>
<p>Now, all this information is integrated there,</p>
<p>but what most people don&rsquo;t tell us</p>
<p>is that a lot of learning of motor sequences,</p>
<p>of skill learning that involve timing</p>
<p>occurs in the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Now, you can&rsquo;t really use that information</p>
<p>except to know that after you learn something pretty well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s handed off or kind of handled by your cerebellum.</p>
<p>But there is something that you can do with your cerebellum</p>
<p>to increase range of motion and flexibility.</p>
<p>Much of our flexibility, believe it or not,</p>
<p>is not because our tendons are a particular length</p>
<p>or elasticity, although that plays some role.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because our muscles are short.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that would even mean.</p>
<p>Some people have longer muscle bellies</p>
<p>or shorter muscle bellies,</p>
<p>but your muscles always essentially span the entire length</p>
<p>of the bone or limb or close to it,</p>
<p>along with your tendons.</p>
<p>But it has to do with the neural innervation of muscle</p>
<p>and the fact that when muscles are elongated,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a point at which they won&rsquo;t stretch out any longer</p>
<p>and the nerves fire and they shut down.</p>
<p>You actually have inhibitory pathways</p>
<p>that prevent you from contracting the muscles</p>
<p>or from extending them, from stretching them out anymore.</p>
<p>So you can do this right now.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re driving, don&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>because unless you have a self-driving car,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll need to take your hands off the steering wheel.</p>
<p>But because of the way that vision</p>
<p>and your muscles are represented in your cerebellum,</p>
<p>it turns out that your range of visual motion</p>
<p>and your range of vision,</p>
<p>literally how wide a field of view you take,</p>
<p>impacts how far you can extend your limbs.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ll talk about this in a second,</p>
<p>about exactly how to do this and explore this.</p>
<p>But as you move through space, as you walk forward,</p>
<p>or you walk backward, or you tilt your head,</p>
<p>or you learn a skill,</p>
<p>or you just operate in the normal ways throughout your day,</p>
<p>driving, biking, et cetera,</p>
<p>your eyes are generating spontaneous movements</p>
<p>to offset visual slip.</p>
<p>In other words, you don&rsquo;t see the world as blurry</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>because your eyes are generating</p>
<p>low compensatory eye movements to offset your motion.</p>
<p>So if I spin, we could do this experiment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fun experiment we do with medical students</p>
<p>where you spin them around in a chair</p>
<p>with their eyes closed,</p>
<p>and then you stop and you have them open their eyes</p>
<p>and their eyes are going like this,</p>
<p>doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, a nice stagmas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suggest you do this experiment.</p>
<p>When we were kids, we did a different experiment,</p>
<p>which was to take a stick</p>
<p>and to look at the top of the stick</p>
<p>and to spin around on the lawn,</p>
<p>looking at the top of the stick,</p>
<p>then put it down on the ground and try and jump over it.</p>
<p>And you end up like jumping to the side,</p>
<p>you miss the thing entirely.</p>
<p>The reason those two quote unquote experiments,</p>
<p>which I hope you don&rsquo;t do or force somebody else to do,</p>
<p>the reason they work is because normally your eye movements</p>
<p>and your balance and your limb movements are coordinated.</p>
<p>But when you spin around looking up at the stick,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re fixating your eyes</p>
<p>on one location while you&rsquo;re moving.</p>
<p>And then when you stop,</p>
<p>those two mechanisms are completely uncoupled</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like being thrown into outer space.</p>
<p>Never been to outer space,</p>
<p>but probably something like that,</p>
<p>low gravity, zero gravity.</p>
<p>If you spin around in your chair with your eyes closed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not giving the visual input that you&rsquo;re spinning.</p>
<p>And then you open the eyes</p>
<p>and then the eyes only have the,</p>
<p>what we call the vestibular signal,</p>
<p>your eyes jolting back and forth, back and forth.</p>
<p>Again, these aren&rsquo;t experiments you need to do</p>
<p>because I just told you the result.</p>
<p>However, if you want to extend your range of motion,</p>
<p>you can do that by, these things always look goofy,</p>
<p>but at this point,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kind of used to doing these things.</p>
<p>If I want to extend my range of movement,</p>
<p>first, I want to measure my range of motion.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to, if you&rsquo;re listening,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing is I&rsquo;m stretching out my arms</p>
<p>from like a T on either side,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to push them as far back as I can,</p>
<p>which for me is, feels like it&rsquo;s in line with my shoulders</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t get much further.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really super flexible,</p>
<p>nor am I particularly inflexible, at least physically.</p>
<p>So what I would then do is stop.</p>
<p>I would move my eyes to the far periphery, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m moving my eyes all the way to the left</p>
<p>while keeping my head and body stationary.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to look over my left shoulder as far as I can,</p>
<p>then off to the right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little awkward to do this.</p>
<p>Then up, then down,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m mostly going to just focus on left and then right.</p>
<p>Now, what that&rsquo;s doing is it&rsquo;s sending a signal</p>
<p>to my cerebellum that my field of view</p>
<p>is way over to there and way over to there.</p>
<p>Remember, your visual attention has an aperture.</p>
<p>It can be narrow or it can be broad.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about some of the benefits</p>
<p>of taking a broad visual aperture</p>
<p>in order to relax the nervous system.</p>
<p>This is just moving my eyes, not my head,</p>
<p>like I just did for a second, from side to side.</p>
<p>Now I can retest, and actually you get about</p>
<p>a five to 15 degree increase in your range of motion.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m doing this for you.</p>
<p>You can say, well, you know, he gamed it</p>
<p>because he knew the result that he was hoping for,</p>
<p>but you can try this, okay?</p>
<p>So, and you can do this for legs too, right?</p>
<p>You can do this for any limb essentially.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s purely cerebellar.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because the proprioceptive visual</p>
<p>and limb movement feedback converge in their,</p>
<p>in the ways that we control our muscle spindles</p>
<p>and the way we control the muscle fibers and the tendons.</p>
<p>And essentially you can get bigger range of motion.</p>
<p>So I actually will warm up before exercise</p>
<p>or for before skill learning</p>
<p>by both doing movements for my body,</p>
<p>but also moving my eyes from side to side</p>
<p>in order to generate larger range of motion.</p>
<p>If range of motion is something that I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a fun one that you can play with a little bit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s purely cerebellar.</p>
<p>Some other time we&rsquo;ll get back into cerebellar function.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of just incredible stuff</p>
<p>that you can do with cerebellum.</p>
<p>I talked in an earlier episode on neuroplasticity</p>
<p>about how you can disrupt your vestibular world.</p>
<p>In other words, by getting into modes of acceleration,</p>
<p>moving through space where you&rsquo;re tilted in certain ways,</p>
<p>it can open up the windows for plasticity</p>
<p>and yet other ways.</p>
<p>So you can check that out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the earlier episodes on neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s timestamped.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, if you want to expand your range of motion</p>
<p>before doing skill learning or afterward,</p>
<p>this is a fun one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also kind of neat</p>
<p>because I have this kind of aversion to stretching work.</p>
<p>It never seems like something I want to do.</p>
<p>And so I always put it off.</p>
<p>So if I start with the visual practice</p>
<p>of expanding my field of view</p>
<p>off to one side or the other side or up or down,</p>
<p>then what I find is I&rsquo;m naturally more flexible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not naturally more flexible.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happened is I&rsquo;ve expanded my range of motion.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about visualization and mental rehearsal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked about this a lot.</p>
<p>And I think it relates back to that kind of a matrix</p>
<p>Hollywood idea that we can just be embedded with a skill.</p>
<p>Although in this case, in fairness,</p>
<p>visualization involves some work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about this on an earlier episode</p>
<p>that some people find it very hard</p>
<p>to mentally visualize things.</p>
<p>And some people find it very easy.</p>
<p>There was great work that was done in the 1960s</p>
<p>by Roger Shepard at Stanford and by others,</p>
<p>looking at people&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to rotate three-dimensional objects in their mind.</p>
<p>And some people are really good at this</p>
<p>and some people are less good at this.</p>
<p>And one can get better at it by repeating it.</p>
<p>But the question we&rsquo;re going to deal with today is,</p>
<p>does it help?</p>
<p>Does it let you learn things faster?</p>
<p>And indeed the answer appears to be yes, it can.</p>
<p>However, despite what you&rsquo;ve heard, it is not as good.</p>
<p>It is not a total replacement</p>
<p>for physical performance itself.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m going to be really concrete about this.</p>
<p>I hear all the time that just imagining contracting a muscle</p>
<p>can lead to the same gains</p>
<p>as actually contracting that muscle.</p>
<p>Just imagining a skill can lead to the same increases</p>
<p>in performance as actually executing that skill.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>However, it can supplement or support physical training</p>
<p>and skill learning in ways that are quite powerful.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting studies on this</p>
<p>was from Ranganathan et al.</p>
<p>Forgive me for the pronunciation.</p>
<p>This was a slightly older paper, 2004,</p>
<p>but nonetheless was one that I thought</p>
<p>had particularly impressive results</p>
<p>and included all the appropriate controls, et cetera.</p>
<p>And what they did is they looked at 30 subjects.</p>
<p>They divide them into different groups.</p>
<p>They had one group perform essentially finger flexion.</p>
<p>So it was actually just sort of the,</p>
<p>imagine if you&rsquo;re just listening to this,</p>
<p>the, you know, come here, finger movement.</p>
<p>They also had elbow flexion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bicep curl type movement.</p>
<p>And they either had subjects</p>
<p>do a actual physical movement against resistance</p>
<p>or to imagine moving their finger</p>
<p>or their wrist towards the shoulder,</p>
<p>meaning at the bending at the elbow</p>
<p>towards actual resistance.</p>
<p>Just to make a long story short,</p>
<p>what they found was that there were increases</p>
<p>in this finger adduction strength,</p>
<p>abduction, excuse me, strength of about 35%</p>
<p>and the elbow flexion strength by about 13.5%,</p>
<p>which are pretty impressive</p>
<p>considering that it was just done mentally.</p>
<p>So they had people imagine moving against a weight,</p>
<p>a very heavy weight,</p>
<p>or had imagined people moving their wrist</p>
<p>towards their shoulder against a very heavy weight.</p>
<p>But again, they weren&rsquo;t doing it.</p>
<p>They were just imagining it.</p>
<p>Other experiments looked at the brain</p>
<p>and what was happening in the brain during this time.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about that in a moment.</p>
<p>But essentially what they found were</p>
<p>improvements in strength of anywhere from 13.5 to 35%.</p>
<p>However, the actual physical training group,</p>
<p>the groups that actually moved their wrist</p>
<p>or move their finger against an actual physical weight</p>
<p>had improvements of about 53%.</p>
<p>So this repeats over and over throughout the literature.</p>
<p>Mental rehearsal can cause increases in strength.</p>
<p>It can create increases in skill acquisition and learning,</p>
<p>but they are never as great</p>
<p>if done alone as compared</p>
<p>to the actual physical execution of those movements</p>
<p>or the physical movement of those weights,</p>
<p>which shouldn&rsquo;t come as so surprising.</p>
<p>However, if we step back and we say,</p>
<p>well, what is the source of this improvement?</p>
<p>You might not care what the source is</p>
<p>because I could tell you it&rsquo;s one brain area</p>
<p>or another brain area, what difference would it make?</p>
<p>But again, if you can understand mechanism a little bit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a position to create newer</p>
<p>and even better protocols.</p>
<p>What mental rehearsal appears to do</p>
<p>is engage the activity of those upper motor neurons</p>
<p>that we talked about way back</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>Remember, you have upper motor neurons</p>
<p>that control deliberate action.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got lower motor neurons</p>
<p>that actually connect to the muscles</p>
<p>and move those muscles</p>
<p>and you have central pattern generators.</p>
<p>Mental rehearsal, closing one&rsquo;s eyes typically</p>
<p>and thinking about a particular sequence of movement</p>
<p>and visualizing it in one&rsquo;s quote unquote mind&rsquo;s eye</p>
<p>creates activation of the upper motor neurons</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very similar if not the same as the actual movement.</p>
<p>And that makes sense because the upper motor neurons</p>
<p>are all about the command for movement.</p>
<p>They are not the ones that actually execute the movement.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Remember, upper motor neurons are the ones</p>
<p>that generate the command for movement,</p>
<p>not the actual movement.</p>
<p>The ones that generate the actual movement</p>
<p>are the lower motor neurons</p>
<p>and the central pattern generators.</p>
<p>So visualization is a powerful tool.</p>
<p>How can you use visualization?</p>
<p>Well, in this study,</p>
<p>they had people perform this five days a week.</p>
<p>I believe that it was 15, yes,</p>
<p>it was 15 minutes per day, five days a week for 12 weeks.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of mental rehearsal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a ton of time each day, 15 minutes per day,</p>
<p>but sitting down, closing your eyes</p>
<p>and imagining going through a particular skill practice</p>
<p>or moving a weight.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s playing keys on a piano,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your thing, or strings on a guitar.</p>
<p>For 15 minutes a day, five days per week for 12 weeks</p>
<p>is considerable.</p>
<p>I think most people,</p>
<p>given the fact that the actual practice,</p>
<p>the physical practice is going to lead</p>
<p>to larger improvements, greater improvements</p>
<p>than would the mental training</p>
<p>would opt for the actual physical training.</p>
<p>But of course, if you&rsquo;re on a plane</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have access to your guitar</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re certainly not going to be sprinting</p>
<p>up and down the aisle,</p>
<p>or you are very serious about your craft</p>
<p>and you want to accelerate performance of your craft</p>
<p>or strength increases or something of that sort,</p>
<p>then augmenting or adding in the visualization training</p>
<p>very likely will compound the effects</p>
<p>of the actual physical training.</p>
<p>There are not a lot of studies looking at how visualization</p>
<p>on top of pure physical training</p>
<p>can increase the rates of learning</p>
<p>and consolidation of learning, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a hard study to do</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to control for,</p>
<p>because what would you do in its place?</p>
<p>You would probably add actual physical training</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s always going to lead to greater effects.</p>
<p>So the point is,</p>
<p>if you want to use visualization training, great,</p>
<p>but forget the idea that visualization training</p>
<p>is as good as the actual behavior.</p>
<p>You hear this all the time.</p>
<p>People say, do you know that if you imagine an experience</p>
<p>to your brain and to your body,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exactly the same as the actual experience.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>This is not the way the nervous system works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t mean to burst anybody&rsquo;s bubble,</p>
<p>but your bubble is made of myths.</p>
<p>And the fact of the matter is that the brain,</p>
<p>when it executes movement,</p>
<p>is generating proprioceptive feedback.</p>
<p>And that proprioceptive feedback is critically involved</p>
<p>in generating our sense of the experience</p>
<p>and in things like learning.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t say this because I don&rsquo;t like the idea</p>
<p>that visualization couldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>In fact, visualization does work,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t work as well.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t create the same milieu,</p>
<p>the same chemical milieu, the same environment</p>
<p>as actual physically engaging in the behavior,</p>
<p>the skill, the resistance training, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be willing to wager that the same is true</p>
<p>for experiences of all kinds.</p>
<p>PTSD is this incredibly unfortunate circumstance</p>
<p>in which there&rsquo;s a replay often of the traumatic event</p>
<p>that feels very real.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not to say that the replay itself</p>
<p>is the same as the actual event.</p>
<p>And of course, PTSD needs to be dealt with</p>
<p>with the utmost level of seriousness.</p>
<p>It should be treated.</p>
<p>In fact, my lab works on these sorts of things.</p>
<p>But my point about visualization and imagining something</p>
<p>not being the same as the actual experience</p>
<p>is grounded in this idea of proprioception</p>
<p>and the fact that feedback to the cerebellum,</p>
<p>the cerebellum talking to other areas of the brain</p>
<p>are critically involved in communicating</p>
<p>to the rest of our nervous system</p>
<p>that not just that we believe something is happening,</p>
<p>but something is actually happening.</p>
<p>And in the case of muscle loads,</p>
<p>muscles actually feeling tension,</p>
<p>the actual feeling of tension in the muscle,</p>
<p>the contracting of the muscle under that tension</p>
<p>is part of the important adaptation process.</p>
<p>In a future episode, we&rsquo;ll talk about hypertrophy</p>
<p>and how that works at the level of upper motor neurons,</p>
<p>lower motor neurons, and muscle itself.</p>
<p>But for now, just know that visualization can work.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work as well as real physical training</p>
<p>and practice, but these effects of 35% or 13.5% increases</p>
<p>are pretty considerable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not as great as the 53% increases</p>
<p>that come from actual physical training.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in some of the skill learning</p>
<p>that more relates to musical training,</p>
<p>but also how cadence and metronoming and tones, et cetera,</p>
<p>can support physical learning.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in that, you aficionados,</p>
<p>there is a wonderful review</p>
<p>also published in the journal, Neuron.</p>
<p>Again, excellent journal by Herholtz and Zatore.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s H-E-R-H-O-L-Z and Zatore, Z-A-T-O-R-E-T-O-R-E.</p>
<p>That really describes in detail how musical training</p>
<p>can impact all sorts of different things</p>
<p>and how cadence training, whether or not with tones</p>
<p>or auditory feedback and things of that sort,</p>
<p>carries over to not just instrumental music training,</p>
<p>but also physical skill learning of various kinds.</p>
<p>So if you want to do the deep dive,</p>
<p>that would be the place.</p>
<p>You can find it easily online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available as a complete article free of charge,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>Many of you are probably asking what can I take</p>
<p>in order to accelerate skill learning?</p>
<p>Well, the conditions are going to vary,</p>
<p>but motivation is key.</p>
<p>You have to show up to the training session</p>
<p>motivated enough to focus your attention</p>
<p>and to perform a lot of repetitions</p>
<p>in the training sequence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a prerequisite, all right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no pill that&rsquo;s going to allow you</p>
<p>to do fewer repetitions</p>
<p>and extract more learning out of fewer repetitions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually more a question of what are the conditions</p>
<p>that you can create for yourself</p>
<p>such that you can generate more repetitions per unit time?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the right way to think about it.</p>
<p>What are the conditions that you can create for yourself</p>
<p>in your mind and in your body</p>
<p>that are going to allow you to focus?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about focus and plasticity and motivation</p>
<p>in previous episodes.</p>
<p>Please see those episodes if you have questions about that.</p>
<p>I detail a lot of tools and the underlying science.</p>
<p>So for some people, it might be drinking a cup or two</p>
<p>of coffee and getting hydrated before the training session.</p>
<p>For some of you, it might be avoiding coffee</p>
<p>because it makes you too jittery</p>
<p>and your attention jumps all over the place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to vary tremendously.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real, there is no magic pill</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to allow you to get more out of less.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not going to happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply not going to happen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get more learning</p>
<p>out of fewer repetitions or less time.</p>
<p>However, there are a few compounds</p>
<p>that I think are worth mentioning</p>
<p>because of their ability to improve</p>
<p>the actual physical performance,</p>
<p>the actual execution of certain types of movements.</p>
<p>And some of these have also been shown</p>
<p>to improve cognitive function,</p>
<p>especially in older populations.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t at least mention them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only going to mention one today.</p>
<p>In fact, the one that&rsquo;s particularly interesting</p>
<p>and for which there really are a lot of data is alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to attempt to pronounce</p>
<p>what alpha-GPC actually is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s alpha-glycerophospho-choline, right?</p>
<p>Alpha-GPC, alpha-glycerophospho-choline.</p>
<p>See, if I keep doing it over and over repetitions,</p>
<p>alpha-glycerophospho-choline.</p>
<p>There, I made an error.</p>
<p>Okay, so the point is that alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>which is at least in the United States</p>
<p>is sold over the counter,</p>
<p>typically is taken in dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a single dose or have been shown</p>
<p>to do a number of things that for some of you</p>
<p>might be beneficial.</p>
<p>One is to enhance power output.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re engaging in something like shot put throwing</p>
<p>or resistance training or sprinting</p>
<p>or something where you have to generate a lot of power,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re doing rock climbing,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re working on a particular aspect</p>
<p>of your rock climbing that involves</p>
<p>generating a lot of force, a lot of power.</p>
<p>Well then, in theory, alpha-GPC could be beneficial to you.</p>
<p>For the cognitive effects, the dosages are much higher,</p>
<p>up to 1200 milligrams daily divided into three doses</p>
<p>of 400 milligrams is what the studies</p>
<p>that I was able to find show or used.</p>
<p>The effects on cognitive decline are described as notable.</p>
<p>Notable meaning several studies showed a significant</p>
<p>but modest effect in offsetting cognitive decline,</p>
<p>in particular in older populations and some populations</p>
<p>even with some reported neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>Power output was notable.</p>
<p>How notable?</p>
<p>What does that mean, notable?</p>
<p>A study noted a 14% increase in power output.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty substantial, 14% if you think about it,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t like a doubling or something of that sort.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the symptoms of Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>have been shown at least among the nutraceuticals</p>
<p>of which alpha-GPC is to significantly improve cognition</p>
<p>in people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Now, this episode isn&rsquo;t about cognitive decline</p>
<p>and longevity, we will talk about that,</p>
<p>but this is a so-called another effect of alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>Fat oxidation is increased by alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>growth hormone release is promoted by alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>although to a small degree.</p>
<p>So as you can see, things like alpha-GPC in particular</p>
<p>when they are combined with low levels of caffeine</p>
<p>can have these effects of improving power output,</p>
<p>can improve growth hormone release,</p>
<p>can improve fat oxidation.</p>
<p>All these things in theory can support skill learning,</p>
<p>but what they&rsquo;re really doing</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re adjusting the foundation</p>
<p>upon which you are going to execute</p>
<p>these many, many repetitions, okay?</p>
<p>The same thing would be said for caffeine itself.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s something that motivates you</p>
<p>and gets you out of a chair</p>
<p>to actually do the physical training,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s something that can perhaps improve</p>
<p>or enhance the rate of skill learning</p>
<p>and how well you retain those skills.</p>
<p>Now, on a previous episode, I talked about,</p>
<p>and this was the episode on epinephrine, on adrenaline,</p>
<p>I talked about how for mental, for cognitive learning,</p>
<p>it makes sense to spike epinephrine,</p>
<p>to bump epinephrine levels up,</p>
<p>adrenaline levels up after cognitive learning.</p>
<p>For physical learning, it appears to be the opposite,</p>
<p>that if you are, if caffeine is in your practice</p>
<p>or if you decide to try alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>that you would want to do that before the training,</p>
<p>take it before the training, use it,</p>
<p>its effects should extend into the training,</p>
<p>presumably throughout,</p>
<p>and then afterward, if you&rsquo;re thinking about following</p>
<p>some of the protocols that we discussed today,</p>
<p>that you would use some sort of idle time</p>
<p>where the brain can replay these motor sequences in reverse,</p>
<p>and then of course, you want to do things</p>
<p>to optimize your sleep.</p>
<p>A lot of the questions I get are about</p>
<p>how different protocols and things that I describe</p>
<p>start to collide with one another.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say, for instance, you go to bed at 10.30</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to do your skill training at 9.30,</p>
<p>well, taking a lot of caffeine then</p>
<p>is not going to be a good idea</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to compromise your sleep.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not here to design the perfect schedule for you</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s situations vary.</p>
<p>So the things to optimize are repetitions, failures,</p>
<p>more repetitions, more failures,</p>
<p>at the offset of training, having some idle time</p>
<p>that could be straight into sleep,</p>
<p>or it could be simply letting the brain just go idle</p>
<p>for five to 10 minutes,</p>
<p>me not focusing on anything, not scrolling social media,</p>
<p>not emailing, ideally not even talking to somebody,</p>
<p>just lying down or sitting quietly with your eyes closed,</p>
<p>letting those motor sequences replay.</p>
<p>Then we talked about how one can come back</p>
<p>for additional training sessions,</p>
<p>use things like metronoming,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re cueing your attention to some external cue,</p>
<p>some stimulus, in this case,</p>
<p>an auditory stimulus most likely,</p>
<p>and trying to generate more repetitions per unit time.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s repetitions and errors, that&rsquo;s key.</p>
<p>And then we also talked about some things that you can do</p>
<p>involving cerebellar neurophysiology</p>
<p>to extend range of motion,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s limiting for you,</p>
<p>or to use visualization to augment the practice,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say your particular skill involves nice weather</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s raining or snowing outside</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t get outside, a thunderstorm,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s where visualization training</p>
<p>might be a good replacement under those conditions,</p>
<p>or in most cases is going to be the kind of thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to want to do</p>
<p>in addition to the actual physical skill</p>
<p>or strength training session done,</p>
<p>at least in the study that we described,</p>
<p>for 15 minutes a day, five days a week,</p>
<p>over a period of 10 to 12 weeks or so.</p>
<p>So hopefully that makes it clear.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of mechanism.</p>
<p>We talked so much about the different motor pathways,</p>
<p>central pattern generators.</p>
<p>So you now are armed with a lot of information</p>
<p>about how you generate movement.</p>
<p>And I like to think that you&rsquo;re also armed</p>
<p>with a lot of information about how to design protocols</p>
<p>that are optimized for you,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re a coach for your trainees</p>
<p>in order to optimize their learning</p>
<p>of skills of various kinds.</p>
<p>Today, we focused almost entirely on motor skills,</p>
<p>things like musical skills or physical skills.</p>
<p>These have some overlap.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re partially overlapping with neuroplasticity</p>
<p>for learning things like languages, or math,</p>
<p>or engineering, or neuroscience for that matter.</p>
<p>Before we depart,</p>
<p>I just want to make sure that I return to a concept,</p>
<p>which is the ultradian cycle.</p>
<p>Ultradian cycles are these 90-minute cycles</p>
<p>that we go through throughout sleep and wakefulness</p>
<p>that are optimal for learning and attention</p>
<p>in the waking state.</p>
<p>They are the stages of sleep</p>
<p>in which we have either predominantly slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>or REM sleep.</p>
<p>Some of you who have been following this podcast</p>
<p>for a while might be asking,</p>
<p>well, should a physical practice be 90 minutes?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to depend because with physical practices,</p>
<p>oftentimes, for instance, with strength training,</p>
<p>that might be too long.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be able to generate enough force output</p>
<p>for it to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>For golfing, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never played golf,</p>
<p>although my friends that play golf,</p>
<p>they disappear onto the golf course for many hours.</p>
<p>So I know there&rsquo;s a lot of walking and driving</p>
<p>and other stuff.</p>
<p>I even hear that somebody carries your stuff around for you.</p>
<p>Sometimes, not always, but it&rsquo;s going to differ.</p>
<p>A four-hour golf game,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not swinging the golf club for four hours.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to depend.</p>
<p>I would say that the ultradian cycle</p>
<p>is not necessarily a good constraint</p>
<p>for skill learning in most cases.</p>
<p>And I should say that for those of you</p>
<p>that are short on time or have limited amounts of time,</p>
<p>10 minutes of maximum repetitions,</p>
<p>maximum focus skill learning work</p>
<p>is going to be very beneficial.</p>
<p>Whereas two hours of kind of haphazard,</p>
<p>not really focused work</p>
<p>or where you&rsquo;re not generating very many repetitions</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing a few repetitions,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re texting on your phone</p>
<p>or paying attention to something else,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to be beneficial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about the density of training</p>
<p>inside of a session.</p>
<p>So I think you should let the,</p>
<p>work toward maximal or near maximal density of repetitions</p>
<p>and failures, provided they&rsquo;re failures</p>
<p>you can perform safely</p>
<p>in order to accelerate skill learning.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t let some arbitrary,</p>
<p>or in this case, the ultradian constraint</p>
<p>prevent you from engaging in that practice.</p>
<p>In other words, get the work in,</p>
<p>get as much work done as you can per unit time.</p>
<p>And based on the science,</p>
<p>based on things that I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>based on things that I&rsquo;m now involved in</p>
<p>with various communities,</p>
<p>you will see the skill improve vastly at various stages.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a little bit stutter start.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always a linear improvement,</p>
<p>but you will see incredible improvement in skill.</p>
