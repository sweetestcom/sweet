<p>so what did you say they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>thumb in the nose at every what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thumbing their nose at every victim and hero</p>
<p>victim in here they&rsquo;re thumbing their nose</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>before we were rudely cut off</p>
<p>rudely cut off</p>
<p>we started earlier but we didn&rsquo;t have any sound</p>
<p>something was going on with the you</p>
<p>stream feed so we decided to redo everything and</p>
<p>you know saying this is a very strange song</p>
<p>well i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>strange that anybody would actually record it</p>
<p>i think that there&rsquo;s something sad</p>
<p>about it i mean there&rsquo;s something kind of pathetic</p>
<p>about the passion in the guy&rsquo;s voice</p>
<p>you know what i mean like he</p>
<p>sounds like it&rsquo;s like a baby</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like an infant</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s believes</p>
<p>everything that guy believes</p>
<p>everything and he&rsquo;s like you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do my part i&rsquo;m</p>

<p>wrong with brian but then</p>
<p>brian told me the</p>
<p>story about how he was living in this apartment</p>
<p>and they were pumping</p>
<p>carbon dioxide from the furnace into his bedroom</p>
<p>for like two years</p>
<p>and it made him half retarded</p>
<p>totally for real</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s totally true it&rsquo;s totally true</p>
<p>wait you really</p>
<p>think you have like</p>
<p>something happened to his</p>
<p>brain in there</p>
<p>yeah they cooked his brain</p>
<p>with carbon monoxide i</p>
<p>think it made him a</p>
<p>superhero dioc</p>
<p>dioxide or monoxide</p>
<p>no he&rsquo;s a superhero it&rsquo;s like that when the spider bit</p>
<p>uh spider man it&rsquo;s carbon</p>
<p>is it carbon monoxide why do you</p>
<p>think i can make retarded</p>
<p>videos the nice</p>
<p>carbon monoxide</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been poisoned he got is it monoxide</p>
<p>or dioxide dioxide is what you breathe out right</p>
<p>dioxide you breathe out monoxide is what makes you make</p>
<p>great viral videos</p>
<p>right you could</p>
<p>dress cats up</p>
<p>do you ever look back to the days before you</p>
<p>lived in that place and</p>
<p>what would i have been like no because i was my</p>
<p>i was tripping and stuff</p>
<p>you know before that so</p>
<p>so you just cooked your brain</p>
<p>right from the get go</p>
<p>totally but i take</p>
<p>a lot of resveratrol now so i should be fine</p>
<p>right do you think that resveratrol is really the shit</p>
<p>oh i totally love it</p>
<p>i believe in it so much do you think</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s partly placebo effect probably probably</p>
<p>duncan you taking any vitamins these days</p>
<p>yeah can you tell</p>
<p>yes i can no i haven&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>i took i was telling you i took</p>
<p>this reishi infused</p>
<p>yeah yeah tell me about that</p>
<p>these are marijuana drops right yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never a fucking lack of creativity in these</p>
<p>crazy weed chops</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always coming up with new things so</p>
<p>tell what exactly is this</p>
<p>this is a this is</p>
<p>ratios and i&rsquo;m probably</p>
<p>mispronouncing it but how do you spell it</p>
<p>r e i s h i</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s apparently the super healthy fungus</p>
<p>that when i read on wikipedia what it does</p>
<p>it somehow helps you if you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>chest problems or chest pains i</p>
<p>guess it supposedly helps you this</p>
<p>is chinese herbs who the fuck knows if it&rsquo;s real but</p>
<p>tastes like</p>
<p>shit tastes like echinacea</p>
<p>but the infused part of it is awesome</p>
<p>so they infuse it with thc yes</p>
<p>so you get is it what is the difference between that</p>
<p>effect and the regular</p>
<p>thc drops effect that when</p>
<p>you take it you&rsquo;re like ugh this is fucking awful but</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;ve earned it</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re like suffering through it like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a mini</p>
<p>ayahuasca trip</p>
<p>yeah exactly like but</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know i mean it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>placebo by the way</p>
<p>the placebo</p>
<p>effect is underrated</p>
<p>because fuck yeah it</p>
<p>is the placebo effect is</p>
<p>powerful man it really is</p>
<p>so when you&rsquo;re you know normal so</p>
<p>when you eat pot</p>
<p>as anyone who&rsquo;s eating pot knows it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>strong and there&rsquo;s like a chance</p>
<p>somewhere in that trip that</p>
<p>you can go a little dark or get a little paranoid or</p>
<p>things can seem weird</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;ve been taking</p>
<p>an herbal chinese</p>
<p>super medicine with the drop</p>
<p>then when shit</p>
<p>starts getting</p>
<p>weird you can think no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m on rishi</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m on a chinese herb that&rsquo;s healthy</p>
<p>and then it kind of banishes the</p>
<p>demons a little bit</p>
<p>really no it&rsquo;s not true that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t work with me didn&rsquo;t help at all i</p>
<p>was kind of making out because i took it</p>
<p>and went snorkeling</p>
<p>on a reef oh my god</p>
<p>yeah it was fucking how deep did you go how deep</p>
<p>like say if</p>
<p>we at the bottom of the pool like how high were you</p>
<p>high i was fucking high i was</p>
<p>i was bottom of the pool</p>
<p>bottom of the pool</p>
<p>chartered boat</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sitting</p>
<p>there because we were like you know what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going snorkeling</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go hunter</p>
<p>s thompson style</p>
<p>just and i was</p>
<p>drinking it i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dropping i was like</p>
<p>i remember like it was</p>
<p>streaming down my face into my beard i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>drinking it</p>
<p>and so like</p>
<p>you know that thing</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re eating pot and you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>jolly and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>underestimating its</p>
<p>power you&rsquo;re like yo</p>
<p>fuck it let&rsquo;s just eat it let&rsquo;s go nuts</p>
<p>and then like</p>
<p>45 minutes in son</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>oh why did i</p>
<p>do that i was on a chartered boat</p>
<p>and i started</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happy and there&rsquo;s kids wandering around it&rsquo;s in hawaii</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like oh</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be the</p>
<p>first person who goes insane on this boat</p>
<p>the first time anyone just</p>
<p>started raving</p>
<p>and ranting on a boat and there&rsquo;s kids around i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking you&rsquo;re gonna ruin these kids vacations oh</p>
<p>my god i look they were like</p>
<p>you know hawaii is beautiful</p>
<p>and these fucking red cliffs and i</p>
<p>swear to god i looked up</p>
<p>and i thought i saw like you know raiden from</p>
<p>mortal kombat</p>
<p>like i thought</p>
<p>i saw like this like person wearing one of</p>
<p>those cone hats and like kind of</p>
<p>blending oh</p>
<p>my god oh my god you&rsquo;re seeing hawaiian gods</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like some hawaiian guardian</p>
<p>spirit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>aware of you and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want you to be there</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re a honky</p>
<p>have you ever</p>
<p>taken mushrooms and seen like</p>
<p>aztec imagery</p>
<p>seen like mexican imagery</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve taken lsd</p>
<p>and have seen</p>
<p>when i was like</p>
<p>i was sanskrit</p>
<p>but never aztec i&rsquo;ve i&rsquo;ve seen i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken mushrooms and seen like</p>
<p>like mayan language and like you know that style of</p>
<p>you know ancient</p>
<p>mexican culture the mayans and</p>
<p>you know all the their</p>
<p>crazy language</p>
<p>it was like little drawings and little images</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve like seen that shit in the sky</p>
<p>sure and when i&rsquo;m on mushrooms yeah i&rsquo;ve seen like</p>
<p>you know all this</p>
<p>crazy mayan imagery</p>
<p>now i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s because i had seen it before</p>
<p>and my imagination was running wild</p>
<p>and i was like you</p>
<p>know just creating</p>
<p>images that i&rsquo;ve already witnessed</p>
<p>and creating them in the sky</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible that&rsquo;s what was going on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also very possible that they made</p>
<p>those images because they got fucked up on mushrooms</p>
<p>and they saw that shit in the sky and they drew it</p>
<p>that seems to be even more likely can i</p>
<p>throw out another possibility sure</p>
<p>whoever out there is smart and listening to this</p>
<p>please correct me but i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chomsky is a linguist noam chomsky is a linguist and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>theories of where language comes from is language</p>
<p>something you</p>
<p>learn or is language something encoded into your brain</p>
<p>because some people think that language is something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already kind of</p>
<p>built into your</p>
<p>brain and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>waiting to flower according to what</p>
<p>culture you get born into and who you&rsquo;re around</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such an incredibly complex thing to learn</p>
<p>people wonder if like</p>
<p>is the brain a blank slate</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re born or there are already</p>
<p>these things sort of in there waiting to come out</p>
<p>so the idea is that when you are hallucinating</p>
<p>these symbols</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t as</p>
<p>though you were projecting something you&rsquo;d already seen</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t as though the</p>
<p>aztecs were hallucinating or like oh we</p>
<p>should use these symbols to</p>
<p>is our language it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s already deep inside your</p>
<p>brain and when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tripping it kind of comes out and you&rsquo;re seeing like</p>
<p>an uber language you know or some kind of like</p>
<p>original primal language like</p>
<p>fucking hebrew look at hebrew that&rsquo;s so psyched</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s such a psych yes</p>
<p>it is isn&rsquo;t it yeah</p>
<p>maybe maybe you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right i mean i don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>one of the things that i&rsquo;ve seen many many times</p>
<p>in psychedelic</p>
<p>states like</p>
<p>especially even just eating pot when i</p>
<p>close my eyes</p>
<p>is cartoon like imagery</p>
<p>like cartoon like strange</p>
<p>morphing type of imagery and</p>
<p>what strikes me</p>
<p>about a lot of the mayan shit</p>
<p>is that all</p>
<p>these you know</p>
<p>is it pictographs is that how you</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>exactly what you&rsquo;d call it but all</p>
<p>these different images they look very cartoon like</p>
<p>yeah you know the dragons look very</p>
<p>silly and cartoon like</p>
<p>everything is almost like</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>so these people were living in real danger</p>
<p>but yet they had the</p>
<p>peace of mind and the</p>
<p>creativity to draw the dangerous</p>
<p>things and almost like</p>
<p>lessened your</p>
<p>worry about them</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing that cultures do</p>
<p>with predators i mean we still do it today with like</p>
<p>polar bears</p>
<p>polar bears are some of the most dangerous bears you</p>
<p>could ever come across</p>
<p>but we have them selling</p>
<p>coca cola and klondike bars and being all silly and</p>
<p>sliding on the snow</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fucking vicious</p>
<p>murderers that live</p>
<p>in the coldest part of the</p>
<p>world you know</p>
<p>we do it because we have a</p>
<p>separation from them they&rsquo;re not a part of our</p>
<p>daily lives they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>infiltrating the cities if they were</p>
<p>we would want to</p>
<p>kill them all and we</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t ever think of them as being a happy thing</p>
<p>but these fucking people were living in the jungle man</p>
<p>they were living in the jungle around jaguars and</p>
<p>snakes and all these</p>
<p>they were doing so much drugs they were drawing</p>
<p>everything in cartoons</p>
<p>right these people were</p>
<p>tripping their fucking balls off</p>
<p>when people say</p>
<p>that the mayans</p>
<p>had this answer and</p>
<p>the mayans had this calendar that can</p>
<p>predict lunar eclipses and</p>
<p>i go you know what so do we</p>
<p>we can predict all that shit too</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know the fucking future</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re telling these people would never invented</p>
<p>shoes these</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>figured out the future they figured out how that the</p>
<p>age is going to end really</p>
<p>you know come on man</p>
<p>more likely</p>
<p>they were stone</p>
<p>age people who did a fuckload</p>
<p>of drugs and came up some really really cool shit what</p>
<p>about the um</p>
<p>cargo cult theory you know that what is that</p>
<p>you know what a</p>
<p>cargo cult is no</p>
<p>so again brilliant person out there correct me</p>
<p>cause like i kind of remember</p>
<p>things and then i fuck them up</p>
<p>in my translation of them but</p>
<p>during one of the wars</p>
<p>maybe it was</p>
<p>world war ii</p>
<p>in the south pacific i</p>
<p>guess they would like parachute</p>
<p>supplies down</p>
<p>right and so the supplies</p>
<p>would come down and they land on</p>
<p>these islands that had primitive people who&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never seen this shit before</p>
<p>and so what would happen is a cult would emerge</p>
<p>based on trying to figure out how to get</p>
<p>those supplies to fall out of the sky again</p>
<p>so this really great shit that you&rsquo;ve never seen</p>
<p>basically from an</p>
<p>alien if you&rsquo;re a south pacific islander</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been slurping coconuts eating fish</p>
<p>eating bananas</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the extent of what you</p>
<p>understand and all of a sudden this giant fucking thing</p>
<p>on a parachute</p>
<p>comes zooming out of the sky filled with</p>
<p>flashlights</p>
<p>maybe a radio</p>
<p>fabric it&rsquo;s roswell</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an alien impact and it changes your culture</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like shit you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen you have no way to explain it fell</p>
<p>out of the sky so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a cargo cult</p>
<p>is something that emerges around that event</p>
<p>where you try to</p>
<p>reenact whatever you were doing at that time when the</p>
<p>thing fell out of the sky so if you were like</p>
<p>cutting fish or doing so</p>
<p>whatever you know having a certain</p>
<p>celebration or if it happened during cutting fish</p>
<p>whatever seriously that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they do that&rsquo;s what they do they cut do all day it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a big part of they were very</p>
<p>smart i mean that the window</p>
<p>of what they do is you know yeah hunting and gathering</p>
<p>so you look at</p>
<p>those fucking pyramids right and</p>
<p>and you look at them you</p>
<p>think like maybe they were</p>
<p>visited by egyptians</p>
<p>i think no no</p>
<p>i think now</p>
<p>this is not something</p>
<p>you know they do believe that africans came to</p>
<p>earth or came to</p>
<p>north america a long long time ago</p>
<p>the olmecs the</p>
<p>olmecs they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand much</p>
<p>about the olmecs at all</p>
<p>they know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>civilization that goes back i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like thousands of years</p>
<p>and they were the oldest</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>they know advanced</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>north america and they know nothing</p>
<p>about their language they know nothing</p>
<p>but they have african features</p>
<p>they have these omac</p>
<p>these carved heads these</p>
<p>giant carved heads</p>
<p>from they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where they drag the fucking</p>
<p>stone from the</p>
<p>stones are gigantic and they&rsquo;re perfectly carved</p>
<p>like really</p>
<p>detailed african faces big</p>
<p>thick lips african features</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s there or</p>
<p>visited i mean</p>
<p>i first thought that is i mean look the olmecs</p>
<p>came from africa</p>
<p>most likely</p>
<p>and came to</p>
<p>north america</p>
<p>i mean they</p>
<p>were there they were there they were in mexico let me</p>
<p>throw my theory</p>
<p>out and it&rsquo;s just a theory</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really believe it but i like</p>
<p>thinking about it</p>
<p>what if ufos</p>
<p>looked like</p>
<p>those pyramids</p>
<p>and fucking ufos landed for a little</p>
<p>while and gave them all</p>
<p>their advanced</p>
<p>technology and gave them all the crazy shit</p>
<p>and then flew off</p>
<p>and so she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going deep into the what if drawer</p>
<p>yeah this is deep</p>
<p>in the what if drawer</p>
<p>this is way</p>
<p>underneath a lot of</p>
<p>other what ifs</p>
<p>but like so</p>
<p>if you think about it</p>
<p>those fucking pyramids</p>
<p>kind of look like they could be</p>
<p>spaceships like whenever i think of</p>
<p>spaceships i think</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t it look like a pyramid it</p>
<p>could be a pyramid so maybe</p>
<p>maybe fucking they were</p>
<p>visited by advanced</p>
<p>intelligence</p>
<p>that looked</p>
<p>like those pyramids but</p>
<p>still the problem with the pyramids is not</p>
<p>that the problem with the pyramids is the incredible</p>
<p>mathematical</p>
<p>equations that are required</p>
<p>to create something so perfect</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 2 million</p>
<p>300 000 stones in the pyramid of</p>
<p>the great giza pyramid</p>
<p>great pyramid of giza</p>
<p>that two think</p>
<p>about how many fucking</p>
<p>stones that is</p>
<p>the last stone they</p>
<p>weighed between</p>
<p>two and 80 tons and some of them the ones from</p>
<p>the king&rsquo;s chamber were cut from a quarry that was like</p>
<p>500 miles away</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s amazing man and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re perfectly put in place</p>
<p>you ever seen the king&rsquo;s chamber</p>
<p>where in the</p>
<p>great pyramid it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have any idea how they built it</p>
<p>they have no idea how they got these</p>
<p>incredibly large</p>
<p>stones cut so perfectly</p>
<p>and so smooth</p>
<p>and they found</p>
<p>literally they</p>
<p>found bore marks</p>
<p>in the sarcophagus</p>
<p>that is from a diamond bit</p>
<p>drill right</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like shit that we have today</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that called i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry to cut you off</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s another fascinating aspect of the</p>
<p>stuff you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about which is</p>
<p>shit there&rsquo;s a name for this kind of archaeology</p>
<p>where people will find cryptos no</p>
<p>crypt it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find batteries</p>
<p>you know what i mean or you&rsquo;ll find yeah i</p>
<p>think of cryptozoology but yeah i know</p>
<p>yeah i know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about you&rsquo;ll find like a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that there&rsquo;s no way that it</p>
<p>should exist back then it almost indicates</p>
<p>time traveler well have you ever</p>
<p>well not time</p>
<p>travel but have you ever looked</p>
<p>into graham hancock have you ever read any of his</p>
<p>stuff no i know that</p>
<p>i want to give you fingerprints of the gods before you</p>
<p>leave it&rsquo;s one of my favorite books</p>
<p>and this guy graham hancock is an archaeologist and</p>
<p>he traveled all over the</p>
<p>world looking in all</p>
<p>these ancient</p>
<p>civilizations and ancient</p>
<p>structures and</p>
<p>studied all the</p>
<p>different cataclysmic event</p>
<p>stories that</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>religion seems to have that are in the area</p>
<p>of gilgamesh</p>
<p>in the bible</p>
<p>and what he believes is that</p>
<p>somewhere around</p>
<p>10 000 years ago there was some event on</p>
<p>earth and there was a</p>
<p>super advanced</p>
<p>civilization that</p>
<p>existed before that</p>
<p>and we have been around a lot longer than we think</p>
<p>and that what the pyramids are</p>
<p>literally is people rediscovering some shit</p>
<p>that a super</p>
<p>super advanced</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>that had been reset</p>
<p>many thousands of years ago</p>
<p>what we see like when you see like the</p>
<p>great pyramid and</p>
<p>the sphinx and all</p>
<p>these things that they can&rsquo;t explain the fink&rsquo;s</p>
<p>enclosure what we see is</p>
<p>the proof that there was some sort of a</p>
<p>super advanced</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>many many many thousands of years before</p>
<p>where the archeologists currently date</p>
<p>to be the time they</p>
<p>built the pyramids</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>named john anthony west that has</p>
<p>dedicated his entire life</p>
<p>to trying to let people</p>
<p>look at egypt in a different way</p>
<p>and he believes that the egyptian</p>
<p>the drawings the</p>
<p>depictions of pharaohs they go back over 34 000 years</p>
<p>but for whatever reason conventional</p>
<p>egyptologists</p>
<p>are unwilling to look at that kind of evidence</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to look at anything that makes it seem like</p>
<p>everything is all fucked up and there was</p>
<p>some sort of an event that hasn&rsquo;t been documented and</p>
<p>the people that we</p>
<p>think of as egyptians</p>
<p>maybe never even</p>
<p>built this in the</p>
<p>first place they</p>
<p>might have been like the people that</p>
<p>moved into all this shit and</p>
<p>like this conversation we&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>about the pyramid</p>
<p>the egyptians were having it too</p>
<p>sure what the fuck is that</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>where the shit come from</p>
<p>exactly people been saying that for a</p>
<p>while exactly</p>
<p>exactly we found it like</p>
<p>second hand they</p>
<p>found it first and</p>
<p>well this guy graham hancock has</p>
<p>traveled all over the</p>
<p>world taking all</p>
<p>this footage of</p>
<p>these incredible</p>
<p>structures that</p>
<p>people have made that map out the cosmos that</p>
<p>match constellations and</p>
<p>all these different societies</p>
<p>yeah like machu you know machu picchu</p>
<p>that fucking thing</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even know how anybody got anything up there</p>
<p>these guys got these</p>
<p>giant fucking</p>
<p>stones up there</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no air</p>
<p>and they built</p>
<p>these incredible structures</p>
<p>many many many thousands of years ago</p>
<p>they have no idea when and they</p>
<p>think that it</p>
<p>might have even been at a time where</p>
<p>water was up there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking nutty man</p>
<p>when you really find out how much</p>
<p>of these ancient</p>
<p>structures and</p>
<p>ancient civilizations how much evidence there is for it</p>
<p>but when they</p>
<p>start bringing this</p>
<p>stuff up to conventional archeologists</p>
<p>they always say well</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the evidence for these</p>
<p>cultures like that&rsquo;s what they said</p>
<p>about john anthony west when they brought up the</p>
<p>water erosion marks on the</p>
<p>sphinx are you familiar with all that</p>
<p>the water erosion on the</p>
<p>sphinx is due to thousands of years of rainfall</p>
<p>the problem with that is the last</p>
<p>time there was rainfall in the nile valley it was like</p>
<p>7 000 bc yeah</p>
<p>so that puts it like way way</p>
<p>way out dates it way past what we</p>
<p>think of as</p>
<p>egyptian civilization</p>
<p>egyptian civilization we</p>
<p>think of around like 2</p>
<p>000 3 000 bc</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking like 7 000</p>
<p>4 000 years</p>
<p>earlier than that</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>i mean this is a pretty incredible shit so</p>
<p>these guys have discovered all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>point to the fact that it&rsquo;s much more likely</p>
<p>that there was a far</p>
<p>older civilization that disappeared</p>
<p>and so the archeologists are all like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the evidence for the</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>what else is</p>
<p>going to be left</p>
<p>what else is</p>
<p>gonna be left</p>
<p>after 10 000 years man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get some</p>
<p>stone that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>a car would dissolve into the</p>
<p>earth a building</p>
<p>would fall apart and crumble</p>
<p>everything has to be made out of stone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to survive have you seen</p>
<p>the and you know</p>
<p>about wanting to rub you but</p>
<p>you know when they</p>
<p>first found</p>
<p>these sphinx in</p>
<p>the forget which fucking pharaoh they attributed to</p>
<p>the guy who</p>
<p>supposedly they think</p>
<p>built the sphinx</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the hieroglyphs it</p>
<p>literally says that</p>
<p>he was told in a dream</p>
<p>that if he uncovered the sphinx</p>
<p>he would go on to rule</p>
<p>egypt he had to uncover it you know why</p>
<p>because it was</p>
<p>covered in fucking sand</p>
<p>they had to actively dig it out of the sand</p>
<p>it was up to its head in sand</p>
<p>not only that the head has been altered</p>
<p>like they know that the head used to be far larger</p>
<p>and was much more likely the head of a lion</p>
<p>and then some fair i was like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like that lion i&rsquo;m on my face up there bitch</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s when they put his face up there</p>
<p>and more likely it was one of the african</p>
<p>pharaohs because he has a face of a nubian</p>
<p>the nubians conquered egypt</p>
<p>in the end of the</p>
<p>egyptian empire when</p>
<p>everything fell to shit yeah</p>
<p>the nubians conquered and</p>
<p>their pharaohs were much more african looking</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the point is</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re both saying is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s older than</p>
<p>the way older</p>
<p>this graham hancock guy&rsquo;s a fucking genius man</p>
<p>and his his books are brilliant on this shit and he has</p>
<p>his wife&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>photographer so he has</p>
<p>these incredible</p>
<p>photographs</p>
<p>of all these different</p>
<p>things from all over the</p>
<p>world and it will</p>
<p>absolutely convince you that</p>
<p>at least this</p>
<p>should be considered as an option and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>right now right now everybody wants to</p>
<p>think that everything they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>taught in school</p>
<p>and everything they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>teaching their students</p>
<p>right now is the information</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very difficult to get them to re look at shit</p>
<p>these motherfuckers that won&rsquo;t look at the</p>
<p>sphinx i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s water erosion</p>
<p>every single geologist who looks at that says</p>
<p>this is water</p>
<p>erosion from thousands of years of rainfall</p>
<p>and then they have all</p>
<p>these other</p>
<p>guys that are like no can&rsquo;t be it&rsquo;s impossible that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been a problem</p>
<p>for me imagining that we&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>super right</p>
<p>but for them they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>teaching this shit</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>teaching tutmosis</p>
<p>iii did this at this time and he</p>
<p>built this pyramid and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know though</p>
<p>that the fucking</p>
<p>they really don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s guesswork there&rsquo;s a shitload of</p>
<p>guesswork yeah that&rsquo;s always really</p>
<p>amazing to me when</p>
<p>archaeologists get very specific</p>
<p>about something that was</p>
<p>a really long time ago and then he said to his troops</p>
<p>how the fuck do you know what he</p>
<p>said i can barely remember what i</p>
<p>ate yesterday after</p>
<p>lunch exactly</p>
<p>how are you fucking</p>
<p>how are you</p>
<p>diagnosing this shit it&rsquo;s impossible i talk</p>
<p>about this when i talk</p>
<p>about on stage when i talk</p>
<p>about how little we know</p>
<p>about human beings if i&rsquo;m in a club</p>
<p>that it has like</p>
<p>two hundred people in it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll say you know there&rsquo;s two hundred of us right here</p>
<p>what we represent if we</p>
<p>lived our entire lives birth to</p>
<p>death and we</p>
<p>added them all together</p>
<p>we represent</p>
<p>twenty thousand years</p>
<p>just us right just the lives</p>
<p>of 200 people if you add them all together birth to</p>
<p>death that&rsquo;s 20</p>
<p>fucking thousand years yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s way more than we know</p>
<p>about human history way way way more</p>
<p>according to like conventional</p>
<p>teaching or conventional thought</p>
<p>like 20 000 years ago we were</p>
<p>basically cavemen</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>we wore animal skins and shit like</p>
<p>when they find</p>
<p>those frozen dudes</p>
<p>how old are</p>
<p>those dudes i have no idea it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>30 000 years ago</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like wearing skins and shit and throwing</p>
<p>spears with</p>
<p>rock tips like that&rsquo;s as good as it got back then</p>
<p>20 000 years just 200 people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible man well</p>
<p>do you buy into the</p>
<p>stuff that we came from mars</p>
<p>no no i don&rsquo;t buy into</p>
<p>any of the mars imagery</p>
<p>i see all that richard hoglen documentary</p>
<p>i see all these guys</p>
<p>talking about it and you know what i see</p>
<p>i see a bunch of guys who are trying to find a</p>
<p>bunch of shit that&rsquo;s not necessarily there</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>connections with this rock to that rock and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using this fucking</p>
<p>really fuzzy geometry</p>
<p>to describe the regions</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some interesting</p>
<p>structures there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some interesting</p>
<p>structures that may</p>
<p>or may not have at one</p>
<p>point in time been a building</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s up for debate</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up for debate</p>
<p>it started off as the</p>
<p>lightning bolt hitting the plasma</p>
<p>it is storks</p>
<p>look it&rsquo;s very possible of course it was a storks</p>
<p>brian we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>before the storks</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible that life</p>
<p>existed on mars</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible it&rsquo;s very possible that if you think</p>
<p>about the fact that life</p>
<p>has existed on earth</p>
<p>for billions of years right</p>
<p>okay and we know that at one</p>
<p>point in time you know there was lizards running shit</p>
<p>and it was a tropical jungle and there was dinosaurs</p>
<p>everywhere and we didn&rsquo;t evolve</p>
<p>until all those were</p>
<p>wiped off the face of the planet</p>
<p>right according to</p>
<p>eddie griffin</p>
<p>they were not</p>
<p>wiped off the planet they went</p>
<p>underground and learned to</p>
<p>shape shift please tell me he didn&rsquo;t say that on</p>
<p>stage he didn&rsquo;t say it on</p>
<p>stage he told it to me buying the comedy</p>
<p>store has he ever told you that how bruce lee died</p>
<p>story no bruce lee fought a thousand niggas</p>
<p>this crazy thing</p>
<p>like he was</p>
<p>standing there and he took</p>
<p>about nine hundred of them out</p>
<p>until one finally got the death touch on his ass</p>
<p>fucking death he</p>
<p>will he will he will tell a fucking tail</p>
<p>eddie griffin would be the perfect guy to hang out with</p>
<p>drunk in a pool hall</p>
<p>yeah like a friday night and he&rsquo;s talking shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s his best kind of humor man this</p>
<p>crazy story is fucking hilarious anything he says</p>

<p>but what was funny very talented</p>
<p>guy man he told me that was the</p>
<p>first time i&rsquo;d heard the reptilian theory</p>

<p>truth of it that it was like an eerie moment</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s so crazy it was really</p>
<p>hypnot he hypnotized crowds man</p>

<p>great man so did you leave lil hobo in the lobby</p>
<p>and then somebody stole it or</p>
<p>what happened well it&rsquo;s an interesting story</p>
<p>the weird thing is i&rsquo;d been up in nevada city at</p>
<p>a little film comedy festival you&rsquo;re saying you</p>
<p>loved it up there</p>
<p>nevada city&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>where is it exactly it&rsquo;s north of sacramento</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not really sure about how the pot</p>
<p>manufacture</p>
<p>and distribution</p>
<p>works but i know that nevada city plays</p>
<p>a pretty important role in that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there it&rsquo;s like a big it&rsquo;s like a big part of</p>
<p>their economy and</p>
<p>how do i know this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you i was buying a burrito from a hippie</p>
<p>and he was commenting on how he likes the festival</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s almost the business picks up to almost the</p>
<p>level is when the cutters are in town</p>
<p>and it was like whoa holy shit you guys have a</p>
<p>cycle based on</p>
<p>harvesting the crops and stuff</p>
<p>and nevada city is also</p>
<p>the yuba river runs through nevada i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna live there though man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too many</p>
<p>creeps i would i</p>
<p>would say especially</p>
<p>right now with the climate it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>legitimate marijuana factory that&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>everybody gets dental insurance</p>
<p>and shit and they all work there the communities</p>
<p>happy that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>most these guys are selling illegal shit</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing this is this was the really fascinating</p>
<p>thing that that someone there said to me they said</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>in november they don&rsquo;t want pot to get legal</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna crash</p>
<p>their economy yeah that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy cuz that&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m more important than</p>
<p>the cause yeah let&rsquo;s just put</p>
<p>people i can&rsquo;t adjust</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t adjust no it&rsquo;s saying i&rsquo;m okay with</p>
<p>people going to jail</p>

<p>would have said something but yeah it was really yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve heard the argument</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve heard the argument</p>
<p>from a few people but there&rsquo;s some people that are just</p>
<p>contrarians</p>
<p>and they just want to argue</p>
<p>about anything no matter what you</p>
<p>bring up if they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of it</p>

<p>about nikola tesla yeah</p>
<p>first of all i loved it because</p>
<p>you and i are both huge</p>
<p>tesla fans and we&rsquo;ve talked so many times</p>
<p>about how fascinating that guy was</p>
<p>with the fact that you did that video where you got</p>
<p>super duper fucking drunk</p>
<p>or just going off about</p>

<p>cause i was looking</p>
<p>i was like wow that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;d look like if i could act</p>
<p>you can act dude i</p>
<p>know acting is just</p>
<p>about getting comfortable you</p>
<p>are very good at committing to</p>
<p>weird shit yeah</p>
<p>you remember that one time that we did this</p>
<p>weird backstage</p>
<p>thing where</p>
<p>brian was filming it we were pretending like we were</p>
<p>gonna film a documentary i</p>
<p>do remember that</p>
<p>yeah that was fun man but i&rsquo;ll tell you this acting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not is this it</p>
<p>right here yeah</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s drunk history with duncan truffle</p>
<p>and how drunk were you when you did this blacked out</p>
<p>blacked out drunk what did you drink</p>
<p>absinthe in</p>
<p>a six pack of beer</p>
<p>oh my god how much absent half a bottle of oh my god</p>
<p>yeah that stuff gets you so weird i</p>
<p>could have died</p>
<p>really nikola</p>
<p>tesla oh my god</p>
<p>nikola tesla</p>
<p>was the father</p>
<p>of western technology oh my</p>
<p>everything we know is like</p>
<p>modern electricity tesla</p>
<p>invented that</p>
<p>he also invented wireless</p>
<p>technology he invented the radio</p>
<p>supposedly one day he was taking a walk in a park</p>
<p>and he suddenly experienced this tremendous flash</p>
<p>and he saw in</p>
<p>his mind the perfect blueprint of an engine</p>
<p>that would create something called</p>
<p>alternating current</p>
<p>and that was in his like</p>
<p>i have to go the united</p>
<p>states to meet edison</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll meet edison</p>
<p>so tesla sailed across the ocean</p>
<p>found edison</p>
<p>who at the time was like the king of electricity</p>
<p>edison it was like oh all right</p>
<p>well i guess you</p>
<p>you can work for me</p>
<p>and his job was</p>
<p>like his job was digging like ditches for edison</p>
<p>and from this guy westinghouse gave him money</p>
<p>to start working on his idea of alternating current</p>
<p>so edison didn&rsquo;t like the idea of</p>
<p>alternating current because he owned all the patents on</p>
<p>direct current</p>
<p>alternating current was the</p>
<p>only too drunk</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do it yes you can look at you dude</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna start puking</p>
<p>did you get all the details</p>
<p>right even though you&rsquo;re so hammered i</p>
<p>think tesla</p>
<p>won the contract to supply all the electricity to the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s fair</p>
<p>and this pissed edison off he was like fuck this</p>
<p>alternating current is bad</p>
<p>alternating current will only cause massive deaths</p>
<p>and so he started this campaign to prove</p>
<p>that alternating current was like the</p>
<p>worst current he could use what he did is he</p>
<p>began to like publicly</p>
<p>electrocute animals</p>
<p>edison was an asshole he was like</p>
<p>taking like</p>
<p>sheep and being like look what happens when the</p>
<p>sheep touches the</p>
<p>alternating current</p>
<p>oh it blow it</p>
<p>gets electrocuted</p>
<p>look what happens when a cow</p>
<p>comes in contact with the alternating current it dies</p>
<p>tesla was horrified</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be like this is</p>
<p>awful i am inventing electricity</p>
<p>and you look like an asshole</p>
<p>you look like a fucking idiot</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna throw up</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do it good good night thank you everyone</p>
<p>tesla i discovered</p>
<p>the energy to run the world&rsquo;s failure</p>
<p>and at that moment tesla</p>
<p>became an international figure</p>
<p>worshipped by everyone</p>
<p>so tesla had like a laboratory like</p>
<p>mark twain and like everybody who is</p>
<p>famous in the world come to the laboratory</p>
<p>do it like do things like make electricity</p>
<p>shoot around his body</p>
<p>people will be watching like look at him he&rsquo;s on fire</p>
<p>mark twain will be there crying</p>
<p>the new idea was that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think you necessarily need</p>
<p>to have like power plants for there to be electricity</p>
<p>i think that you can take electricity from the air</p>
<p>this was directly opposed to</p>
<p>all of capitalist society</p>
<p>so he was basically ostracized from society</p>
<p>how did this come out of my body</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pieces there&rsquo;s pineapple pieces</p>
<p>like i know i chewed it</p>
<p>he went crazy</p>
<p>you know but his</p>
<p>greatest pleasure</p>
<p>as he was getting old was feeding pigeons</p>
<p>and he fell in love with a specific pigeon</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on brian internet just stopped</p>
<p>did it yeah it&rsquo;s not loading up the whole video</p>
<p>oh okay well they can watch yeah you know</p>
<p>all right just go on youtube anyway yeah</p>
<p>well i think that was pretty much the gist of it but</p>
<p>did you have to</p>
<p>study for that</p>
<p>yeah i read a book on</p>
<p>tesla and i watched a documentary on tesla</p>
<p>so i had all my facts straight but you knew the whole</p>
<p>story beforehand because we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>it many times</p>
<p>we both i didn&rsquo;t know the extent of it</p>
<p>until because i knew enough</p>
<p>about it to know it would be a cool drunk history</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m friends with a guy who does that</p>
<p>derek waters and i was like you</p>
<p>gotta let me do tesla you know</p>
<p>tesla was another</p>
<p>one who believed he was in communication with the</p>
<p>with the aliens yeah</p>
<p>but see this is a</p>
<p>he believed he was receiving signals</p>
<p>right here&rsquo;s an interesting point</p>
<p>that i think we</p>
<p>should talk about</p>
<p>cause you know you can use the term</p>
<p>aliens or whatever but</p>
<p>where do your jokes come from</p>
<p>yeah sure the ether</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always said</p>
<p>that at my most creative i&rsquo;m merely a passenger i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching it all come out and i just</p>
<p>keep my own bullshit</p>
<p>from getting in the way of myself</p>
<p>from getting in the way of the idea like last</p>
<p>night like i was</p>
<p>in the middle of the writing and this is you know</p>
<p>you know when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>especially like late at</p>
<p>night i always find like</p>
<p>reasons to get distracted sometimes when i&rsquo;m writing</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m in the middle of writing</p>
<p>and while i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about something i</p>
<p>think wow look at all this</p>
<p>crazy shit i wrote</p>
<p>where is this all coming from</p>
<p>like all of a</p>
<p>sudden it&rsquo;s me you know</p>
<p>thinking like in like this list ego way</p>
<p>like look at all the work you&rsquo;ve done look at all this</p>
<p>and then the idea whatever i had</p>
<p>whoop slipped out of my head my head</p>
<p>it was just like hey</p>
<p>stupid you know it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about you dummy it&rsquo;s not about you</p>
<p>like getting any accolades are</p>
<p>you patting yourself on the back for fucking sitting in</p>
<p>front of a computer</p>
<p>punching keyboard</p>
<p>for five minutes</p>
<p>or five hours it</p>
<p>would it what it&rsquo;s about is</p>
<p>what comes out that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s about the</p>
<p>final result the</p>
<p>final product</p>
<p>and when that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really not even you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just coming out of the air</p>
<p>yeah in fact</p>
<p>yeah the less</p>
<p>you that&rsquo;s involved the better it&rsquo;s better to</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the hardest</p>
<p>thing because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>trying to catch</p>
<p>those thoughts are trying to put yourself in the</p>
<p>right position</p>
<p>where those thought</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>catching them and the</p>
<p>static&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking hard man in</p>
<p>fact is you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t force it and that&rsquo;s the zen thing</p>
<p>if you try to catch it</p>
<p>it runs away from you</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t try to catch it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when the thoughts</p>
<p>start popping into your head and usually</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like happening at times when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not expecting it</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t make it happen do you ever read the war of art</p>
<p>uh yeah as a</p>
<p>matter of fact yes yes i have yeah i love that</p>
<p>book i give it to people do you have a copy of it i do</p>
<p>thank you yeah</p>
<p>i give it to people they don&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s such</p>
<p>a fucking amazing book when it comes to writing</p>
<p>but that dude stephen</p>
<p>pressfield he talks</p>
<p>a lot very openly</p>
<p>about the idea of a muse</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>like he shows up and does his work and the mew</p>
<p>shows up and</p>
<p>gives him the ideas i mean that&rsquo;s like this ancient</p>
<p>idea and ancient thought but</p>
<p>it really does feel</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s something else besides you well you know the</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about this earlier</p>
<p>so john lily</p>
<p>the father of the flotation tank</p>
<p>um he sort of</p>
<p>breaking he openly says he had contact with</p>
<p>extra dimensional beings he used to</p>
<p>shoot ketamine and</p>
<p>climb into the tank yeah</p>
<p>he used to jab himself in the leg intramuscularly</p>
<p>with ketamine</p>
<p>a fucking cat tranquilizer</p>
<p>is that what it&rsquo;s for cats</p>
<p>what does this</p>
<p>mean i thought</p>
<p>horses it&rsquo;s for cats</p>
<p>i thought it was</p>
<p>horses i always</p>
<p>heard it was cats and he would</p>
<p>fucking go for a trip</p>
<p>they say ketamine is supposed to be one of the</p>
<p>weirdest psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>mckenna had a very interesting way of describing it</p>
<p>he said ketamine is fairly recent as far as</p>
<p>like fairly new as far as like</p>
<p>human use and</p>
<p>mushrooms are around for</p>
<p>thousands and thousands of years document to human use</p>
<p>he said when you take a mushroom trip one of the</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;re taking in the trip is the idea that</p>
<p>you are embedding yourself and all the</p>
<p>other trips that happened</p>
<p>with all the</p>
<p>other mushrooms before</p>
<p>you engage in one big</p>
<p>joyous you know</p>
<p>interconnected experience</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why mushrooms you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s such this</p>
<p>powerful incredible</p>
<p>experience like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having the</p>
<p>experience of everyone who&rsquo;s ever had mushrooms</p>
<p>right whereas with ketamine he said ketamine is like</p>
<p>like an empty</p>
<p>office building</p>
<p>i must have not did</p>
<p>enough cause</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what it was for me when i</p>
<p>had dream yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about special k</p>
<p>right yeah you have to</p>
<p>shoot it oh well</p>
<p>you can snort</p>
<p>it but if you want to</p>
<p>see the aliens</p>
<p>see the aliens</p>
<p>to me it was the</p>
<p>exact opposite it wasn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>loosen it it was just like oh i can&rsquo;t walk up</p>
<p>these stairs</p>
<p>you know you can</p>
<p>watch youtube</p>
<p>videos of people on it</p>
<p>ketamine and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a bad good</p>
<p>yeah ketamine is not one that i would</p>
<p>be really down with i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t really be down with trying anything i have to</p>
<p>shoot in my fucking leg with a</p>
<p>horse needle</p>
<p>yeah duncan</p>
<p>trussell&rsquo;s gonna go for a piss</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>duncan weak</p>
<p>bladder trussell</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be right back right after it urinates</p>
<p>lucky it&rsquo;s in the same room</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to miss him for long</p>
<p>yes i&rsquo;ve never tried ketamine man i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never tried anything that you can get addicted to and i</p>
<p>heard you can get addicted to ketamine</p>
<p>except alcohol</p>
<p>obviously caffeine</p>
<p>caffeine yeah</p>
<p>but vitamins</p>
<p>are healthy so you know you&rsquo;re pretty addicted to them</p>
<p>i do know that</p>
<p>if i don&rsquo;t take them i don&rsquo;t feel as good</p>
<p>alright that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>addicted to him</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re addicted</p>
<p>to it makes you healthy maybe</p>
<p>are you addicted to sleep</p>
<p>shut the fuck up</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look at that over sleeping</p>
<p>definitely yeah</p>
<p>so what have you done if you&rsquo;ve done ketamine</p>
<p>you snorted it</p>
<p>yeah how much</p>
<p>did you do do you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>quite a lot</p>
<p>a couple lines</p>
<p>along with the lines</p>
<p>like an instrument</p>
<p>line you don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>how much you&rsquo;re doing finger size just taking a shot</p>
<p>like a cd size</p>
<p>you know how</p>
<p>crazy are people in drugs they just go snorting</p>
<p>something they&rsquo;re not measuring it i don&rsquo;t know the do</p>
<p>stupid young kid</p>
<p>the only reason</p>
<p>i did it because i was on acid and i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>thinking right</p>
<p>oh you kidding</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re already on</p>
<p>no you kidding</p>
<p>okay so you&rsquo;ve done that and what other like</p>
<p>harsh stuff you tried crack right nah</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t i know this guy looks like me allegedly</p>
<p>might have done</p>
<p>it this guy that looks</p>
<p>like you that allegedly might have smoked crack</p>
<p>right what did he say about it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like doing cocaine</p>
<p>kind of it makes you feel kind of</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it has such a gross</p>
<p>smell that to me it was just kind of like i&rsquo;ve focused</p>
<p>focused my all my shit on that</p>
<p>smell and just like being like</p>
<p>gross like really</p>
<p>gross feeling dmt has a funky</p>
<p>smell to dmt sounds like it</p>
<p>smells like something you should not be smoking</p>
<p>right but then the aliens come</p>
<p>right and take you away</p>
<p>yeah i think the coolest shit was definitely ecstasy</p>
<p>and that was</p>
<p>candy flipping where you do acid and</p>
<p>ecstasy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dangerous man when you fucking mind drugs</p>
<p>like that you don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>exact results of the</p>
<p>the two of them together</p>
<p>that can be</p>
<p>funky man some</p>
<p>weird shit can happen</p>
<p>yeah mckenna told a</p>
<p>story about doing</p>
<p>i think he did</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry a lot of whippets</p>
<p>have you done whippets</p>
<p>joe have you done</p>
<p>whippets before</p>
<p>yes i did whippets when i worked at newport</p>
<p>creamery but i</p>
<p>did you really i</p>
<p>found them to be quite weak</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>it did you have like silver around your lips and they</p>
<p>found you in the freezer</p>
<p>no we worked at a</p>
<p>creamery and they had</p>
<p>those big whipped</p>
<p>cream things</p>
<p>get high off</p>
<p>those yeah used</p>
<p>to buy and buy the case get the</p>
<p>crackers with the balloons</p>
<p>you know and just sit there i only did it once</p>
<p>i did it once it gave me like a head rush</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>it i love it</p>
<p>duncan you love it don&rsquo;t you how do you not like</p>
<p>whippets i know you</p>
<p>gotta love whippets hippie</p>
<p>crack man didn&rsquo;t i was unicorn</p>
<p>gas brother</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>unicorn gas</p>
<p>unicorn gas they superheat unicorns turn into nitrous</p>
<p>oxide i remember</p>
<p>there was a way to do a whip it</p>
<p>where you attached it</p>
<p>to a bong somehow so the whip it was taking a bong hit</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s like you pull it you</p>
<p>put it in and</p>
<p>then you put it on the end what i was saying</p>
<p>about combining</p>
<p>drugs before i forgot was that mckenna told the</p>
<p>story once of taking he took</p>
<p>ayahuasca and he took mushrooms at the same time</p>
<p>i think he took</p>
<p>or he took an</p>
<p>m a o inhibitor in mushrooms it might have been that</p>
<p>it might have been that he took an m a</p>
<p>o inhibitor like he took harmony</p>
<p>and he took mushrooms at the same time</p>
<p>and he said it just</p>
<p>fucked him up to the</p>
<p>point where he was</p>
<p>watching his memory dissolve inside of his</p>
<p>brain and getting</p>
<p>chewed up like in the gears of a machine</p>
<p>like irreplaceably he knew he</p>
<p>would never get</p>
<p>these thoughts and ideas back</p>
<p>that just took him like the longest time to feel safe</p>
<p>that he was really at one</p>
<p>point in time of trip convinced that this is it</p>
<p>you are never</p>
<p>coming back from this like you&rsquo;ve gone so deep you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never coming home that you know what that reminds me of</p>
<p>this is fascinating because i thought of this recently</p>
<p>so the inventor of lsd</p>
<p>albert hoffman</p>
<p>he was the first person to take lsd</p>
<p>took it in the</p>
<p>laboratory and when he took it</p>
<p>you know they call it bicycle day</p>
<p>right you know the whole</p>
<p>story did you call it bicycle day yeah no</p>
<p>the day lsd was invented oh</p>
<p>really bicycle day because</p>
<p>he took and he went for riding his bike and</p>
<p>he looked down as flying over the mountains and that</p>
<p>started the 60s well it was the 40s so it was a little</p>
<p>while but so anyway he</p>
<p>when he took that lsd</p>
<p>he took a huge dose</p>
<p>and he did not know that it would stop</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;ve ever taken lsd</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re having like</p>
<p>maybe not the best trip</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a friend nearby to be like don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>fine a couple</p>
<p>hours relax</p>
<p>hoffman he didn&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t put on any pink floyd</p>
<p>there was no tie dyes to stare at</p>
<p>there was just him in bed</p>
<p>with his wife giving him milk</p>
<p>they were giving</p>
<p>him milk and he said he was being attacked by</p>
<p>demons in his bed</p>
<p>the first person that ever did anything</p>
<p>psychedelic like that or a first</p>
<p>experience like that when there&rsquo;s no information the</p>
<p>worst must have been so terrifying the</p>
<p>worst trip every time</p>
<p>cause someone will find a new one</p>
<p>cause this is the</p>
<p>thing i was thinking</p>
<p>you know the amazing</p>
<p>story of how</p>
<p>dmt or iowasca comes from like you&rsquo;ve told me this a</p>
<p>zillion different herbs in the</p>
<p>jungle and how the fuck did someone figure that out no</p>
<p>no this is what i think</p>
<p>you know most of the planet is ocean</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s gotta be</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>plants under the</p>
<p>ocean there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be some kind of</p>
<p>crazy mix of shit that someone&rsquo;s gonna find</p>
<p>and take and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a new</p>
<p>psychedelic drug i&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come from the sea but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a new</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a new drug that comes out</p>
<p>eventually that has the same impact that ls snorting</p>
<p>you really think so</p>
<p>i hope so give</p>
<p>her snort stimulus</p>
<p>well the thing is</p>
<p>everything that comes up they throw the</p>
<p>water on it</p>
<p>everything you know</p>
<p>salvia there&rsquo;s no reason</p>
<p>to make salvia illegal no one&rsquo;s died of salvia ever</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pulling it off the</p>
<p>shelf i have a reason to make salvia</p>
<p>illegal why yeah</p>
<p>because the retarded</p>
<p>internet videos it produces</p>
<p>brian did one</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just two men</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not yours your yourself your</p>
<p>videos are great</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about all the</p>
<p>other ones i just can&rsquo;t stand</p>
<p>watching someone turn themselves into someone with</p>
<p>ms it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>exciting it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>watching britney</p>
<p>spears videos</p>
<p>like tmz you</p>
<p>still like car accident</p>
<p>wanna watch</p>
<p>this yeah well</p>
<p>sort of but</p>
<p>for someone okay let&rsquo;s just say this is we are you know</p>
<p>men who have</p>
<p>lived longer than</p>
<p>others and we have</p>
<p>experienced more than others</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>living in fucking indiana and you&rsquo;re 17 years old and</p>
<p>your friend just did salvia and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna watch a</p>
<p>video and he told you it</p>
<p>changed his fucking life and he&rsquo;s re examining the way</p>
<p>he looks at the world</p>
<p>and you watch that</p>
<p>video i mean that can</p>
<p>be kind of a trip</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re looking at it like saying all these</p>
<p>morons are doing this but</p>
<p>you know from your</p>
<p>point of view they&rsquo;re morons</p>
<p>let me just say i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think a lot of them are</p>
<p>morons let&rsquo;s be real okay they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>morons but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing though</p>
<p>i was a moron</p>
<p>at god thank</p>
<p>god there was no youtube when i was doing drugs for the</p>
<p>first time you know but</p>
<p>fuck yeah but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>the problem with when i see</p>
<p>those videos</p>
<p>inevitably here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll see in the</p>
<p>background outside of viewers</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll see in the</p>
<p>background is</p>
<p>a baby crib or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll hear</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re listening</p>
<p>the xbox is on full</p>
<p>blast or like</p>
<p>the opposite</p>
<p>things that you would</p>
<p>wanna have in the</p>
<p>background as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to access a</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>state are happening</p>
<p>cause these kids</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know how to take the</p>
<p>psychedelics</p>
<p>you gotta heat the oils</p>
<p>i just hate because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such shaman</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s really a fucking a</p>
<p>travesty that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have people that have experienced</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>that are like</p>
<p>like reputable</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;d be some</p>
<p>sleazy shaman that are just trying to get</p>

<p>okay so i&rsquo;ve never done the cigarettes</p>
<p>tell me what is the pull why is it so difficult to quit</p>
<p>what is it well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the most addictive substances on the planet</p>
<p>according to scientists</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking horrible</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hooked on here that&rsquo;s what they say that&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>thing they always say</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re an ex heroin addict</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in the program you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to na and you&rsquo;re working on your life</p>
<p>heroin&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>right so every time you go out in public</p>
<p>and walk to go get your groceries</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a chance that when you go into the grocery</p>
<p>store there&rsquo;s a guy with a belt around his arm</p>
<p>shooting up before he goes to get milk</p>
<p>going deep so just</p>
<p>everywhere you go yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>triggered with you</p>
<p>with cigarettes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like with</p>
<p>cigarettes you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hooked on the most addictive substance</p>
<p>but everywhere you go there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a couple of people smoking</p>
<p>triggering that addiction</p>
<p>and forcing you back into the cycle and</p>
<p>the reaction is you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to die for having that one</p>
<p>cigarette you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to actually feel relaxed</p>
<p>and exactly what you</p>
<p>want you know you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be like</p>
<p>i had a cigarette and i had a</p>
<p>heart attack and died you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible it&rsquo;s incredible how widespread it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mostly</p>
<p>for stress you know it&rsquo;s mostly for relaxation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like any drug but very mild compared to</p>
<p>every other drug i was very</p>
<p>lucky that i had friends</p>
<p>when i was in high</p>
<p>school that had</p>
<p>already started smoking</p>
<p>cigarettes that already were hooked</p>
<p>i was like this is incredible they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seventeen years old and hooked on</p>
<p>cigarettes this is just fucking insane</p>
<p>and so i made sure that i</p>
<p>never did it i</p>
<p>tried i think i</p>
<p>tried it once i</p>
<p>tried a cigarette at a</p>
<p>party when i was like fifteen</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t like it was discussed but here&rsquo;s the but my</p>
<p>point is like if you see somebody smoking</p>
<p>cigarettes man</p>
<p>the smoking</p>
<p>cigarettes is</p>
<p>gross you ever see someone that that&rsquo;s heroin guy</p>
<p>you ever know anybody that&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>heroin problems i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never known</p>
<p>well i guess i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known a heroin</p>
<p>junkie here and there but i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been close with them</p>
<p>have you ever been around someone</p>
<p>right after they did it</p>
<p>no there&rsquo;s this guy</p>
<p>named buffalo bill when i used to play pool in</p>
<p>white plains at</p>
<p>executive billiards in</p>
<p>white plains new york</p>
<p>there was a lot of action there a lot of gambling that</p>
<p>place used to</p>
<p>stay up till like four or five o&rsquo;clock in the</p>
<p>morning the guy who owned it his name was guy hamilton</p>
<p>his cool motherfucker his actual name was guy azaridi</p>
<p>but he was a professional</p>
<p>piano player and he thought azaridi</p>
<p>sounded too guinea</p>
<p>so i went with guy hamilton</p>
<p>i think it sounds more professional</p>
<p>anyway they used to have</p>
<p>these tremendous</p>
<p>pool matches that</p>
<p>would go on dudes</p>
<p>would bet thousands and thousands of dollars and people</p>
<p>would bet in the</p>
<p>stands i mean it was</p>
<p>some of the most fun times of my life</p>
<p>watching people gamble</p>
<p>and there was this one</p>
<p>guy he used to come into play there was a dude named</p>
<p>george the greek</p>
<p>there was this</p>
<p>local house guy that had a ton of</p>
<p>money and he&rsquo;d like to bet high he</p>
<p>would always fuck come on you cocksucker</p>
<p>you got no hot</p>
<p>you bet 5 000</p>
<p>and he always wanted to bet guys and so guys</p>
<p>would come in from out of</p>
<p>state to play</p>
<p>him and this dude buffalo bill</p>
<p>otherwise known as</p>
<p>water dog that was his</p>
<p>other nickname</p>
<p>and he was a heroin</p>
<p>junkie and what</p>
<p>would happen was he</p>
<p>would shoot heroin</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would come out of the bathroom and sit in a seat</p>
<p>like this for a half an hour</p>
<p>i mean like this like a star</p>
<p>like his paws limp</p>
<p>like the double gay limp thing</p>
<p>and just sit there and his head</p>
<p>would like half</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would get up</p>
<p>after like 25 minutes of that</p>
<p>he would get up and</p>
<p>start fucking</p>
<p>firing balls into the hole</p>
<p>with no fear really he</p>
<p>could not miss</p>
<p>he could not miss he was</p>
<p>one of the best players i&rsquo;ve ever seen play and he was</p>
<p>blasted out of his fucking mind on heroin wow</p>
<p>i watched him run</p>
<p>100 balls he was playing straight pool</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember the number but it was always</p>
<p>several thousands of dollars</p>
<p>he was playing a game of straight pool</p>
<p>the dude ran</p>
<p>100 balls and out on a</p>
<p>table with these</p>
<p>tiny ass pockets</p>
<p>the pockets were not even four inches it was like</p>
<p>three and three</p>
<p>quarter inches</p>
<p>standard is</p>
<p>five inches the pros play on four and a half</p>
<p>these are like</p>
<p>three and three</p>
<p>quarter they were tiny ass</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t hit the ball perfect</p>
<p>it would jar in the pocket and</p>
<p>drive you fucking</p>
<p>crazy this dude</p>
<p>would fire them through</p>
<p>the fucking meat of the pocket like the pocket was a</p>
<p>swimming pool</p>
<p>and he was rolling</p>
<p>a golf ball into it he was a fucking master</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>babies walking</p>
<p>around on heroin</p>
<p>black dead rattlesnake eyes</p>
<p>he might as well have been a fucking shark</p>
<p>his eyes were dead he was just heroin</p>
<p>to the gills</p>
<p>to the gills you&rsquo;d look at him you saw no one in there</p>
<p>you saw no one in there</p>
<p>but he knew the rules of straight pool</p>
<p>and he would</p>
<p>fucking set up that</p>
<p>break shot and</p>
<p>smash that rock and be perfect on every ball</p>
<p>it was infuriating</p>
<p>and georgia</p>
<p>greek would get</p>
<p>crazy because he knew the guy was on the island</p>
<p>he goes he&rsquo;s on the fucking shit</p>
<p>i wanna win this</p>
<p>money i gotta get this cock suck off the shit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m starting</p>
<p>up playing these fucking junkies anymore and he get</p>
<p>crazy and he</p>
<p>starts yelling he&rsquo;s smoking</p>
<p>cigarettes i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna fucking</p>
<p>these fucking junkies</p>
<p>these fuck you didn&rsquo;t hear a</p>
<p>word that guy was saying just firing balls on the whole</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even look up</p>
<p>george is like you</p>
<p>literally yelling and</p>
<p>screaming because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about to lose his</p>
<p>money and the guy didn&rsquo;t miss a ball just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even pay attention</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just something that you know like with heroin</p>
<p>you know obviously it seems to</p>
<p>engender some kind of creative state</p>
<p>for music it certainly</p>
<p>works but i</p>
<p>never thought there was like</p>
<p>eye hand coordination associated with it</p>
<p>you know what it is no his eye and</p>
<p>coordination is already he&rsquo;s been playing pool for his</p>
<p>whole life this guy is a i mean</p>
<p>water dog was</p>
<p>this guy that had played all over the fucking</p>
<p>world i mean</p>
<p>he was a killer</p>
<p>he was one of</p>
<p>those dudes</p>
<p>would come into a pool hall</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of pool halls all across america</p>
<p>where people are begging</p>
<p>for some guy to come in and challenge the</p>
<p>local player</p>
<p>cause they think fucking</p>
<p>danny&rsquo;s playing good</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got some</p>
<p>money we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna mince</p>
<p>money if any fucking road guys</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take the</p>
<p>money off danny</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys that</p>
<p>would slip into</p>
<p>these towns</p>
<p>where they would</p>
<p>still do to this day pool halls</p>
<p>a real action pool hall</p>
<p>those are fun fucking</p>
<p>places if you like pool</p>
<p>and the fun</p>
<p>part is when someone comes in and wants a gamble</p>
<p>so this guy</p>
<p>would come in all</p>
<p>dirty hair looking big fucking bald head</p>
<p>big stupid fat face</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t look healthy at all looked all fucked up and</p>
<p>you guys want to play</p>
<p>does anybody want to play</p>
<p>and people would look at him</p>
<p>going this guy had a fucking hustler he can&rsquo;t even walk</p>
<p>he had this terrible limp</p>
<p>because he was in a bad car accident</p>
<p>always heroin</p>
<p>down always heroin</p>
<p>down and he</p>
<p>would just get in and just</p>
<p>fire on people</p>
<p>just when he was</p>
<p>if he had his mixture</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;d seen</p>
<p>him fucked up before when he didn&rsquo;t have his heroin</p>
<p>there was one time</p>
<p>where he wanted me to</p>
<p>sponsor him this is all back in</p>
<p>california when i</p>
<p>first moved here</p>
<p>i ran into him at hard times</p>
<p>billiards and he wanted me to put him in the tournament</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ll put you in the tournament</p>
<p>goes i gotta get my shit to be</p>
<p>right i go you</p>
<p>gotta get your shit okay</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go get your shit he goes i need a ride i go where</p>
<p>compton get the fuck out of here</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m not driving a compton</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m on a sitcom dude</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not trying to</p>
<p>driving a compton so you can cop heroin</p>
<p>so you can play pool petter</p>
<p>so he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get his heroin that day and he played like shit</p>
<p>he would have to get his heroin</p>
<p>perfect get his mixture right</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a very talented player though man he just</p>
<p>unfortunately got</p>
<p>under the grips of that shit but when he was on it man</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t care how&rsquo;s he</p>
<p>doing now he&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>about heroin dudes they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really last that long no that&rsquo;s not a healthy drug</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not one that you know</p>
<p>but when they&rsquo;re on it man they can yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not one that</p>
<p>you come out</p>
<p>great i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always the question</p>
<p>would jimi hendrix would have</p>
<p>he been jimi hendrix if it wasn&rsquo;t for acid</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>for mushrooms</p>
<p>for you probably a lot better</p>
<p>can you imagine</p>
<p>if he was off it he was just like</p>
<p>jimi hitriks times 20</p>
<p>no way could</p>
<p>you imagine by the way</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing man i&rsquo;ve got a friend who</p>
<p>argues that</p>
<p>that retarded argument that you another</p>
<p>contrarian you</p>
<p>would be better</p>
<p>if you weren&rsquo;t on</p>
<p>whoever it is if they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t on air and if they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t on the mushrooms</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t on acid</p>
<p>they would be better and that is crap</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s that coming from</p>
<p>has he never done anything</p>
<p>no he has but he&rsquo;s like a jazz person and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pointing out that like</p>
<p>miles davis was great</p>
<p>before he got in heroin</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look yeah but</p>
<p>miles davis was always smoking weed</p>
<p>elvis presley</p>
<p>never did drugs all</p>
<p>those guys smoked weed</p>
<p>i guarantee</p>
<p>miles davis smoked weed too</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking jazz musicians</p>
<p>man it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>comics i mean there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>comics don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke weed there&rsquo;s a few of us</p>
<p>but for the most part</p>
<p>unless they have health problems why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you like you know</p>
<p>philip k dick</p>
<p>dedicated one of his books to all</p>
<p>these people who had gone insane from</p>
<p>uh psychedelics wow</p>
<p>and he had a</p>
<p>he had i can&rsquo;t remember how he described it</p>
<p>but the way he described it was like</p>
<p>he described them as like i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember the brilliant person out there knows it was</p>
<p>at the end of that awesome animated waking lifestyle</p>
<p>movie they did</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>what was that</p>
<p>scanner dark yeah</p>
<p>scanner dark but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like kind of like</p>
<p>the risk involved in</p>
<p>deciding to do</p>
<p>psychedelics or do whatever it is to enhance</p>
<p>your art there&rsquo;s a certain risk involved because</p>
<p>sometimes you aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna come back</p>
<p>sometimes like when</p>
<p>mckenna makes the</p>
<p>mao inhibitor</p>
<p>and the whatever and his</p>
<p>mind is getting ground up</p>
<p>he there&rsquo;s a chance he</p>
<p>might not have got</p>
<p>some people don&rsquo;t make it out</p>
<p>like some people you run into him they at some</p>
<p>point in their life they&rsquo;re probably brilliant</p>
<p>they had it together they</p>
<p>were there but now they&rsquo;re like borderline personality</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s also i</p>
<p>think how you handle the trip and what direction</p>
<p>you decide to let your consciousness go into yeah</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s parts in a trip</p>
<p>where you can let go and</p>
<p>everything could be okay or you can</p>
<p>fight it and you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>but i think that&rsquo;s also the case in real life i</p>
<p>think after the</p>
<p>experience is over</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s an adjustment</p>
<p>period when you have a really intense experience</p>
<p>where you come back to reality in regular</p>
<p>everyday life and it seems pretty</p>
<p>lame and it seems fake and it seems</p>
<p>slippery you</p>
<p>know one of the last time i did dmt was a few years ago</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>again because</p>
<p>the for like a couple of weeks</p>
<p>after the experience like life in my</p>
<p>inept way of describing it became slippery</p>
<p>i felt that reality was very</p>
<p>slippery the idea that this</p>
<p>insanely intense much more powerful</p>
<p>experience than everyday life was available that easily</p>
<p>that it was just three puffs away and</p>
<p>boom you&rsquo;re in this new dimension</p>
<p>that was too crazy to me it was really hard to go</p>
<p>and apply anything that i might have got from that</p>
<p>experience positively into regular everyday life</p>
<p>because it made regular</p>
<p>everyday life seem so transparent</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tricky it&rsquo;s tricky because it&rsquo;s not useful</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t enjoy this life</p>
<p>like the last thing you want to do is</p>
<p>enjoy only the psychedelic world</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>fucked up on a new thing</p>
<p>every single day and</p>
<p>never you never interact with people here and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t enhance here it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t enhance this consciousness this</p>
<p>state of consciousness also</p>
<p>any cause there</p>
<p>people who are advocates of psychedelics</p>
<p>some of them</p>
<p>i think take</p>
<p>a bit of a delusional approach by making it seem like</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>are always gonna be safe you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>gonna be fine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like any</p>
<p>great thing</p>
<p>has an inherent risk</p>
<p>the ones you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be fine</p>
<p>for the most part though are the natural ones</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hear about people</p>
<p>dying from peyote</p>
<p>or mushrooms or dmt</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna die and i even even go</p>
<p>crazy you hear the</p>
<p>great crazy from acid</p>
<p>crazy you hear from acid you hear you hear</p>
<p>brain damage from</p>
<p>mdma i&rsquo;ve heard that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard dudes i</p>
<p>think you can</p>
<p>get brain damage from</p>
<p>mdma as far as</p>
<p>going crazy from</p>
<p>lsd it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the bottom line is your</p>
<p>brain is the</p>
<p>organic computer</p>
<p>right and whenever you&rsquo;re putting some kind of external</p>
<p>thing in it that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shifting the way the operating</p>
<p>system works</p>
<p>and then rebooting it and</p>
<p>bringing it back online</p>
<p>just like any computer there&rsquo;s some chance</p>
<p>that when that you</p>
<p>lose a program yeah too</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big question mark in your dock yeah exactly</p>
<p>there was microsoft word what the fuck</p>
<p>yeah because you know i</p>
<p>laptop loses</p>
<p>sound yeah yeah</p>
<p>i wish that it wasn&rsquo;t that way but if</p>
<p>you know sometimes if you</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>go look at a</p>
<p>video of timothy leary</p>
<p>late in his life</p>
<p>you know what was he like</p>
<p>pull up like a timothy</p>
<p>leary well no we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to just describe what he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s lucid</p>
<p>no he&rsquo;s no he&rsquo;s not losing</p>
<p>he fucked up he&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>little fucked up man</p>
<p>maybe he was always like that but it seems</p>
<p>that there is some sort of</p>
<p>neurological impact the</p>
<p>vast amount of</p>
<p>psychedelics he&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a negative</p>
<p>neurological impact well mckenna is the you know the</p>
<p>great bard of the</p>
<p>psychedelic movement</p>
<p>right yeah and you know he died of a</p>
<p>brain tumor</p>
<p>yeah i mean and he did say</p>
<p>no the doctor said there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been a case of mushrooms causing that</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not just mushrooms he was doing he was doing</p>
<p>well not only that the doctor</p>
<p>might not have ever</p>
<p>known anyone to take as much mushrooms as mckenna</p>
<p>yeah i mean you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about a really special case</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s a guy who took a lot of fucking</p>
<p>psychedelics</p>
<p>all over his life</p>
<p>the guy died of</p>
<p>a mushroom shaped</p>
<p>tumor i mean</p>
<p>literally had a</p>
<p>tumor that shaped like a mushroom in</p>
<p>his head he that must have been so embarrassing for him</p>
<p>do you really</p>
<p>think so why did it have to be shaped like a</p>
<p>mushroom no</p>
<p>he actually</p>
<p>he actually was fairly open</p>
<p>about it and he said</p>
<p>that a shorter</p>
<p>intense life worth living</p>
<p>if that is the cost of the experiences that he&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>worth it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if you are a masturbation advocate</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>fine it&rsquo;s healthy you can jerk off all the time it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>and you went</p>
<p>got a brain scan</p>
<p>and it looked like there was</p>
<p>a tumor shaped like a jar of vaseline in your</p>
<p>brain and a</p>
<p>huge dick yeah</p>
<p>it would suck</p>
<p>why would it be a jar of vaseline</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it</p>
<p>would be a dick</p>
<p>tumor you tried to get</p>
<p>obscure there</p>
<p>she said like a dick a dick</p>
<p>so many other</p>
<p>things it was just</p>
<p>too obvious</p>
<p>was vaseline ever really a way to masturbate</p>
<p>because i tried to use it the other day and was like</p>
<p>kidding me it&rsquo;s not the right way</p>
<p>i did it once when i was in high</p>
<p>school and i was like that</p>
<p>definitely feels better than you just using my hand</p>
<p>but not worth the effort so i did it once</p>
<p>vaseline and ben gay is</p>
<p>awful master and also</p>
<p>i still have frozen in my memory</p>
<p>i went to this really lonely guys</p>
<p>apartment once</p>
<p>he was editing something and like</p>
<p>on his fucking</p>
<p>desk was an open jar of vaseline with puma</p>
<p>oh no it wasn&rsquo;t yeah you like forgot to clean oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not funny</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like ugh</p>
<p>or he just didn&rsquo;t care he&rsquo;s like yeah it&rsquo;s my vaseline</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my dipping jug</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gross</p>
<p>i watched this incredible documentary</p>
<p>with it was a show in the uk with eddie izzard</p>
<p>did you hear about it marathon man</p>
<p>no the reason why i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>about vaseline is</p>
<p>he ran these marathons</p>
<p>and one of the things he had to do was put like</p>
<p>vaseline or some</p>
<p>lubrication all over his</p>
<p>sack and his balls and his</p>
<p>dick and his nipples he ran</p>
<p>some insane number</p>
<p>of marathons in a row like over 40 in a row to raise</p>
<p>money for this</p>
<p>thing and he&rsquo;s not in</p>
<p>shape and he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t have a history of running</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>started running</p>
<p>marathons he was running them like he ran a thousand</p>
<p>miles he ran all around the uk did it in like a</p>
<p>month it&rsquo;s fucking incredible man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible because he&rsquo;s not even in</p>
<p>shape he just did it</p>
<p>for sheer willpower</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t imagine if i had to run</p>
<p>26 fucking miles a day over and over and over again</p>
<p>i mean he was having all</p>
<p>these problems like</p>
<p>today is my 11th marathon</p>
<p>he gets to the fucking finish</p>
<p>11th in a row</p>
<p>dude in 10 days he ran 11 fucking marathons</p>
<p>or in 11 days rather he ran 10 marathons</p>
<p>and he kept</p>
<p>going he kept</p>
<p>going he would take a day off</p>
<p>every now and then when they</p>
<p>literally told him you can&rsquo;t walk</p>
<p>today your feet are so fucked up</p>
<p>you got blisters</p>
<p>i mean they were cutting</p>
<p>blisters off and</p>
<p>draining them with needles and he&rsquo;s wincing</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would just run</p>
<p>another marathon the next day it&rsquo;s fucking incredible</p>
<p>incredible i</p>
<p>never would have</p>
<p>expected it</p>
<p>you know i always saw that guy on tv</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>he had some pretty clever material and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wearing a dress and i was like okay i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s his shtick</p>
<p>whatever i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>i never really paid attention</p>
<p>but after watching this documentary i&rsquo;m like wow</p>
<p>like that guy&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>powerful motherfucker</p>
<p>that was a brilliant thing</p>
<p>i mean the the</p>
<p>the fact that he was able to push himself to run</p>
<p>some like forty something fucking marathons</p>
<p>over a thousand</p>
<p>miles he ran</p>
<p>i think was a thousand one hundred</p>
<p>miles or something</p>
<p>crazy like that</p>
<p>he ran all around the uk</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking amazing and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fat guy who&rsquo;s 47 years old</p>
<p>he just willed himself to do it he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been a competitive athlete he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never done anything</p>
<p>like that in his life yeah it really shows you</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re setting</p>
<p>the bar in your life because like</p>
<p>yesterday i was like willed myself to</p>
<p>carry my groceries up my steps</p>
<p>i was like this</p>
<p>is pretty good he didn&rsquo;t take the elevator</p>
<p>by his house</p>
<p>somebody had</p>
<p>glued pubic hair to the</p>
<p>just the crossing button</p>
<p>you know where you push to</p>
<p>cross i had to</p>
<p>press it and you</p>
<p>get pubic hair</p>
<p>no i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a that is a</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how it applies</p>
<p>but yeah somebody</p>
<p>in my neighborhood</p>
<p>in my neighborhood is</p>
<p>filled it&rsquo;s a hipster hive</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>filthy hipsters</p>
<p>someone had the brilliant idea of clipping</p>
<p>their pubic hair</p>
<p>and using rubber cement to glue it</p>
<p>on the button you have to</p>
<p>press across the</p>
<p>street now how does the hipster</p>
<p>community get started</p>
<p>how do hipsters</p>
<p>take over a neighborhood</p>
<p>i know how puerto ricans do it</p>
<p>i know how chinese people do it</p>
<p>it starts with disagreeing with</p>
<p>their country</p>
<p>and then they only say</p>
<p>that goes one language</p>
<p>they meet together</p>
<p>they form a community hipster</p>
<p>high town the word hipster is like a new word for like</p>
<p>the subculture and the subculture gets pushed</p>
<p>basically it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>but is it really the subculture it is</p>
<p>monstrously huge</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the idea of alternative</p>
<p>music it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>alternative when it&rsquo;s selling millions of copies</p>
<p>it goes like this here&rsquo;s the way it works there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>on the very fringes of society</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the artists</p>
<p>like the real artists the people who are getting like</p>
<p>alien transmissions or whatever you want to call it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting super</p>
<p>inspiration and they&rsquo;re creating amazing</p>
<p>things and usually</p>
<p>these people are not</p>
<p>like the mainstream</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re way different they&rsquo;re usually</p>
<p>crazy or off or they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>in the same dimension that</p>
<p>most people are</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>dude if you put this up to your</p>
<p>mouth it&rsquo;ll be better</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re varying a lot</p>
<p>because you keep turning away from the microphone</p>
<p>is that better yeah it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>directional</p>
<p>people get annoyed at this shit</p>
<p>sorry guys we</p>
<p>could put condenser</p>
<p>microphones up but then you&rsquo;d hear my</p>
<p>dogs barking and you&rsquo;d hear the fucking</p>
<p>water running</p>
<p>so so hipster</p>
<p>theory hipster</p>
<p>theory so you get the artist</p>
<p>and the artist&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>group of friends right</p>
<p>the group of friends are really</p>
<p>annoying and</p>
<p>everyone cool moves away they&rsquo;re kind of artists no</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of artists</p>
<p>and they start imitating</p>
<p>whoever this charismatic figure so you get that</p>
<p>group of friends right</p>
<p>and so that</p>
<p>group of friends there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the first group of people that goes and moves in</p>
<p>the shittiest</p>
<p>neighborhood</p>
<p>where the rent&rsquo;s low</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re all artists they don&rsquo;t have a lot of</p>
<p>money now you&rsquo;ve got a pretty cool</p>
<p>group of people</p>
<p>cause you got the guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>using the weird</p>
<p>stencils at the</p>
<p>baby holding</p>
<p>the bomb and the flowers and he lives downtown</p>
<p>and everyone knows he&rsquo;s a genius and</p>
<p>his friends</p>
<p>live there too so let&rsquo;s go move downtown so what</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll get beaten up or mugged</p>
<p>a couple of times but we&rsquo;ll be around banksy the</p>
<p>super artistic i was living down a shitty part of town</p>
<p>so then what</p>
<p>ends up happening is you get</p>
<p>following the</p>
<p>group of friends another</p>
<p>group of people who are friends with the friends</p>
<p>and these are the</p>
<p>posers and then</p>
<p>those are the people who</p>
<p>start filling up the neighborhood</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you get a hipster neighborhood because</p>
<p>you get one really</p>
<p>crazy guy who&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>today i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>dress like the</p>
<p>front of sergeant pepper out</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna curl my mustache out and wear bell bottoms</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it feel</p>
<p>like to live in the center of the hive though</p>
<p>is there anything</p>
<p>cause i know you watch em</p>
<p>through binoculars at night and</p>
<p>study them so</p>
<p>is there like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of parties with the depeche</p>
<p>mode but like backwards</p>
<p>or something you like it do you like living with all</p>
<p>these hipsters</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d rather live there than west hollywood or live there</p>
<p>with like people who are</p>
<p>who are you know</p>
<p>taking authentic pleasure in riding the bullet</p>
<p>saddle ranch you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d rather live there than like</p>
<p>around a group of people who love karaoke</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t like to be i like to live around</p>
<p>know people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we</p>
<p>were thought to be suburban at all</p>
<p>have you ever thought to move to like</p>
<p>a burbank or is like a more suburban neighborhood or</p>
<p>you kind of</p>
<p>like being in no i&rsquo;m we&rsquo;re looking for a</p>
<p>place right now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to get the fuck out of there we&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>place well we</p>
<p>wanna move near me man we</p>
<p>wanna live in that area</p>
<p>right here this is mars</p>
<p>i was telling you</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know what mars is you</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>lived with me</p>
<p>or come to visit me when i was living in colorado</p>
<p>when i was living in</p>
<p>colorado i was living on the top of a mountain</p>
<p>3 000 feet above boulder</p>
<p>150 acres eight</p>
<p>miles up a dirt road into the woods that was mars</p>
<p>that was literally you</p>
<p>would see the sky at night</p>
<p>just filled with stars too</p>
<p>soon too soon</p>
<p>too soon too soon</p>
<p>move up there after</p>
<p>move up there</p>
<p>after the israelis</p>
<p>start bombing ira</p>
<p>no listen man</p>
<p>the only problem up there is having</p>
<p>babies having little kids up there and having a wife</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>driving the snow if it wasn&rsquo;t for all that shit i would</p>
<p>still be up there</p>
<p>right it was incredible</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re living around the most incredible artwork that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever been created by anything and it&rsquo;s natural artwork</p>
<p>these mountains it&rsquo;s not a painting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a natural</p>
<p>three dimensional gigantic</p>
<p>super beautiful</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right in front of you all the time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s humbling and majestic and i</p>
<p>would drive up this fucking road</p>
<p>to the mountain</p>
<p>and as you&rsquo;re turning</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re seeing the snow cap peaks in july there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>snow on them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>staggeringly beautiful and the sky is</p>
<p>just crisp and</p>
<p>clean there&rsquo;s not a hint of smog</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible incredible</p>
<p>if you can live in a</p>
<p>place like that why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s we have</p>
<p>babies and your dog gets</p>
<p>eaten by a fucking mountain lion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that the plot of the shining no</p>
<p>well it kind of is yeah</p>
<p>dude was already nuts man i&rsquo;m not nuts that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>point no no fuck</p>
<p>by the yeah he is joey</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>are you talking about</p>
<p>i am trying the</p>
<p>truth is joe</p>
<p>ate the dog</p>
<p>here this means i am driving</p>
<p>joe ate the dog actually there was no mountain lion</p>
<p>dogs talking shit if you read</p>
<p>the book the shot</p>
<p>the dog was</p>
<p>talking shit</p>
<p>too many barks</p>
<p>while i was writing i got crazy</p>
<p>joe what are you doing out there i have to</p>
<p>write when everyone&rsquo;s asleep man don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>when do you</p>
<p>write can you</p>
<p>write during the day</p>
<p>i just have to be alone</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t feel like i get the same</p>
<p>transmission</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t feel like i get the same</p>
<p>connection to the universe it</p>
<p>sounds completely retarded</p>
<p>but when more</p>
<p>people are asleep i feel like there&rsquo;s less interference</p>
<p>you know oh</p>
<p>i seriously i really</p>
<p>one of the reasons why and it</p>
<p>sounds totally hippie</p>
<p>you know go wear a crystal you faggot it</p>
<p>sounds like that but</p>
<p>one of the reasons</p>
<p>why i like living way far away from people</p>
<p>is that i&rsquo;m very sensitive</p>
<p>to people&rsquo;s energy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very sensitive to people&rsquo;s intent</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very sensitive to what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on and i</p>
<p>think even if i don&rsquo;t want to tune that in i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain amount of really like low</p>
<p>low frequency</p>
<p>interference</p>
<p>that you get from people</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>around them all the time like if you&rsquo;re around a</p>
<p>bunch of negative douchebags</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not interacting with them i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re affecting the</p>
<p>frequency of the environment yeah</p>
<p>sounds silly</p>
<p>no it doesn&rsquo;t but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t if you go to new york city man</p>
<p>you feel the energy of the city</p>
<p>what exactly are</p>
<p>you feeling you&rsquo;re feeling all the fucking people man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>intangible and also you know it&rsquo;s like if you think</p>
<p>about it we</p>
<p>to survive when</p>
<p>back in the days</p>
<p>when it was common to get</p>
<p>eaten by a tiger and</p>
<p>stuff you had to be</p>
<p>completely in tune with</p>
<p>the tribe that you were living and the</p>
<p>tribe wasn&rsquo;t in tune with each other</p>
<p>you were dead and</p>
<p>your tribe is</p>
<p>gluing pubic</p>
<p>hair to stop</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>tribe that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>tribe that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re around that&rsquo;s our tradition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>around them well i know what you&rsquo;re saying i feel less</p>
<p>influenced by</p>
<p>that level of</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s that far away but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like</p>
<p>the group of people that you</p>
<p>really hang around with like the person you live with</p>
<p>the people that you</p>
<p>drive around with</p>
<p>those are the people who are really shaping you</p>
<p>what if your wife</p>
<p>or your girlfriend</p>
<p>was the one that did that though</p>
<p>if you found out that she was the one that</p>
<p>glued the pubic</p>
<p>hairs to that&rsquo;d be one of the happiest days of my life</p>
<p>my bitch is a</p>
<p>freak every fucking crazy</p>

<p>that bad like unbreakable wasn&rsquo;t that bad i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>enjoy it i mean i</p>
<p>enjoyed it but i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it was the</p>
<p>greatest thing in the world</p>
<p>but and then the village was kind of</p>
<p>goofy but it wasn&rsquo;t atrocious</p>
<p>but i heard the one with marky mark the</p>
<p>plant one when the</p>
<p>plants come</p>
<p>alive and kill everybody</p>
<p>that was awful i&rsquo;ve read it so bad</p>

<p>no one was fool</p>
<p>like everyone knew that he this is a</p>
<p>that means nothing to me</p>

<p>yeah you wasted two years of your time</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t care</p>

<p>great actor he was</p>
<p>great and johnny cash</p>
<p>yeah but would you care about him</p>
<p>i mean it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good premise</p>
<p>for most people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for a dude to do johnny cash in my eyes</p>
<p>and pull it off oh my</p>
<p>god you&rsquo;re gonna do johnny cash</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not johnny cash</p>
<p>yeah why are you pretending you&rsquo;re johnny cash</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do johnny you got to be a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>johnny cash</p>
<p>and he did it</p>
<p>pulled it off perfectly</p>
<p>i bought it hook line is a</p>
<p>great actor it&rsquo;s brilliant</p>
<p>it was great and gladiator too he&rsquo;s fucking fantastic</p>
<p>but i know creepy</p>
<p>relationship with his</p>
<p>sister that dude</p>
<p>that idea for that the prank</p>
<p>i know what it came from</p>
<p>it came from cocaine</p>
<p>really that&rsquo;s a cocaine</p>
<p>idea he was doing blow with what&rsquo;s his name um the guy</p>
<p>calling just</p>
<p>answer talking</p>
<p>he was doing blow</p>
<p>he was he was doing cocaine with a</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the guy did the</p>
<p>who produce the</p>
<p>movie colin</p>

<p>casey affleck</p>
<p>casey affleck</p>
<p>and joaquim</p>
<p>were doing blow you</p>
<p>think so and they that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>strong statement you just you just outed them</p>
<p>well i mean is that a surprise</p>
<p>it just feels like a coke idea it feels like an</p>
<p>idea okay this is just</p>
<p>purely your opinion</p>
<p>this in no way reflects the</p>
<p>opinion of the joe rogan this is not my opinion either</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re saying it though so</p>
<p>what happens now i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think a lawsuit</p>
<p>i feel like a lawsuit&rsquo;s happening that</p>
<p>would be funny</p>
<p>you said allegedly</p>
<p>no you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my theory i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if it&rsquo;s true the mic just same</p>
<p>picture so why did you why did you</p>
<p>think that why do you</p>
<p>think that because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an ego idea it&rsquo;s like an idea that like</p>
<p>you think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do this new brilliant</p>
<p>innovative cutting edge thing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>diverge away from what you&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>great at and</p>
<p>and then you just end up putting out this</p>
<p>thing where no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tricked and everyone&rsquo;s mildly annoyed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it is so stupid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so poignant</p>
<p>you nailed it just do what you&rsquo;re good at</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>this always happens it always happens for a really</p>
<p>great actor</p>
<p>or someone so you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s an ego</p>
<p>thing yeah it&rsquo;s an ego</p>
<p>thing why is it an ego</p>
<p>thing because he wants to see that</p>
<p>if he can pull it off</p>
<p>yeah because</p>
<p>he wants to see if he can pull it off and he</p>
<p>thinks he&rsquo;s important enough</p>
<p>where the entire country</p>
<p>is going to oh my god</p>
<p>joaquim what&rsquo;s happened to our dear</p>
<p>wife no one cares</p>
<p>three months down the road you forgotten</p>
<p>about the guy</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like a bit</p>
<p>disappointing because he was a good actor</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s still a good actor he&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>a good actor</p>
<p>mickey rourke went nutty and</p>
<p>stuffed some shit into his face remember when he had</p>
<p>fake cheekbones what was that he went nutty</p>
<p>it went nutty</p>
<p>but they took him back</p>
<p>they took him back well</p>
<p>i hope they take joaquin</p>
<p>back do you</p>
<p>yeah you don&rsquo;t want him to lose his position</p>
<p>no i love his</p>
<p>movies he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great actor</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great actor what</p>
<p>about his hip hop</p>
<p>not impressed love it</p>

<p>thing about that</p>
<p>movie is the music he&rsquo;s</p>

<p>searching late last</p>
<p>night you should make a movie</p>
<p>about that song</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several people that i know in my life that i</p>
<p>would love to</p>
<p>do one of those</p>
<p>windy city heat things</p>
<p>just have them convinced that we&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>shooting yes a</p>
<p>movie with them</p>

<p>awesome i still</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen it i</p>
<p>still don&rsquo;t watch</p>
<p>check it out so good</p>
<p>the idea for people don&rsquo;t know is they convinced this</p>
<p>crazy guy that he was famous</p>
<p>allegedly allegedly crazy he&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>yeah oh yeah allegedly</p>
<p>is that you really have to say that you have</p>
<p>to legally say that</p>
<p>i keep flesh like you get in trouble okay allegedly</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to hurt the</p>
<p>flesh no i can get in trouble</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not to do what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be you know i&rsquo;m just very</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just very concerned my</p>
<p>legal advisor</p>
<p>shut up wait</p>
<p>wait hold on hold on wait you&rsquo;re not my legal advisor</p>
<p>wait you&rsquo;re saying that because joe</p>
<p>said that the main character</p>
<p>scary perry</p>
<p>in wendy city heat was crazy now</p>
<p>that place could not have</p>
<p>existed or that guy could not have existed</p>
<p>without the comedy</p>
<p>store the comedy</p>
<p>store is like</p>
<p>the magnet for the craziest fucking people</p>
<p>from all over the</p>
<p>world would be</p>
<p>drawn to that</p>
<p>place do you remember some</p>
<p>of the nutty</p>
<p>fucking people that we met at that place</p>
<p>how about that fucking hooker the</p>
<p>crazy hooker that was on camera just telling me about</p>
<p>she puts an ad in</p>
<p>craigslist and just shows up at guys</p>
<p>houses and fucks em and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the old</p>
<p>way to do it nowadays you just become a porn star</p>
<p>is that what they do yeah</p>
<p>pornstar hookers it seems like everyone&rsquo;s a pornstar</p>
<p>well it kind of makes</p>
<p>sense it&rsquo;d be like good</p>
<p>advertising if you really wanted to be a hooker you</p>
<p>would do porn</p>
<p>and say you know you</p>
<p>could be used</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be fucking this right now</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>put an ad out you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy is that there&rsquo;s this one porn star that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>well known i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna say who it is</p>
<p>and i searched her and</p>
<p>found her on</p>
<p>one of those hooker</p>
<p>review websites have you seen these</p>
<p>where they review hookers</p>
<p>and they it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like amazon</p>
<p>where like that you know the girls</p>
<p>pussy smell</p>
<p>but like she did put out you know and was good and</p>
<p>you know anyways i</p>
<p>found her on there</p>
<p>and you could like it gives her rates and reviews</p>
<p>and it also gives her mobile cell</p>
<p>phone number so you can just call her up oh</p>
<p>i was like this is</p>
<p>ridiculous what is this website</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the name of</p>
<p>fuck i can&rsquo;t remember that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing for people to know</p>
<p>that is insane i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t remember i&rsquo;m sure people are gonna start i</p>
<p>think reviews are always hilarious when you go on yelp</p>
<p>and someone&rsquo;s taking the time to write a serious</p>
<p>free paragraph review</p>
<p>about a cafe</p>
<p>thoughtful thoughtful review like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s siskel and ebert and they&rsquo;re reviewing like the</p>
<p>sherman oaks starbucks</p>
<p>i think some folks have like</p>
<p>they have aspirations like</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;ll start out reviewing shit on yelp and then i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start a blog because</p>
<p>people enjoy my yelp reviews</p>
<p>and next thing you know gq will hire me to be their</p>
<p>resident critic</p>
<p>because of my</p>
<p>snarky reviews</p>
<p>sad sad pass i&rsquo;m so snarky</p>
<p>i really know how to</p>
<p>cut you down</p>
<p>yeah cut you down to size no you know the</p>
<p>snarky reviews suck</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s even more unnerving</p>
<p>is when someone gives</p>
<p>a passionate</p>
<p>positive review for a shoney&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or you know what i mean or someone like shoney&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like denny&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know what i mean or for like</p>
<p>if you go on yelp you can look at reviews for like</p>
<p>office depot</p>
<p>or staples i yelp</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a yelp elite</p>
<p>are you a yelp</p>
<p>elite yeah how many times</p>
<p>they actually you did two things</p>
<p>today you made fun of him this is</p>
<p>the second one the salvia videos and the yellow</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a salvia</p>
<p>video and he&rsquo;s a yelp retard i&rsquo;m sorry i don&rsquo;t mean to</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not talking about you</p>
<p>his reviews are great</p>
<p>i see your reviews are hilarious</p>
<p>look sometimes you get</p>
<p>you know something that you hate and</p>
<p>you want to make sure that if people are driving around</p>
<p>going let&rsquo;s go to a restaurant</p>
<p>bam oh this is something</p>
<p>you know for the most part this is four stars you know</p>
<p>your reviews are different</p>
<p>i like access of information</p>
<p>you have to come off the ledge come off the ledge</p>
<p>yeah but would you take your</p>
<p>sweetie to a restaurant</p>
<p>if you looked at the reviews and it says</p>
<p>chef farts on every</p>
<p>plate before giving it to him</p>
<p>maybe it was</p>
<p>one review that said that yes i would be tempted</p>
<p>and if there was a restaurant</p>
<p>where a chef farted on the</p>
<p>plates i might go the best is when you go to people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>if you follow that</p>
<p>stuff if you go to their review site where</p>
<p>you look at all their reviews and they&rsquo;re all negative</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>a rotten cunt</p>
<p>going everywhere</p>
<p>angry at everything they see</p>
<p>everywhere they go i like it</p>
<p>especially for dentists and everything</p>
<p>dentists and doctors so</p>
<p>if this doctor has</p>
<p>9 000 reviews all positive and except one negative i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to go to that doctor you know</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s people that would complain</p>
<p>about it so duncan when you take these</p>
<p>harsh hits to</p>
<p>me it really hurts because you&rsquo;re not really</p>
<p>thinking it out</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t think that he&rsquo;s helping man you&rsquo;re helping the</p>
<p>world thank you how many reviews</p>

<p>i mean i read the reviews but i do not review things</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>selfish for me i&rsquo;m a fucking one way</p>
<p>street man yeah you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>downloading</p>
<p>torrance and</p>
<p>not sharing</p>
<p>i enjoy your reviews on yelp</p>
<p>but outside of red band</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just to me</p>
<p>like when you read some of the impassioned yelp review</p>
<p>where someone&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>that pissed off that they&rsquo;re like writing an angry</p>
<p>yelp review it&rsquo;s always some of them are so dumb</p>
<p>you know what bothers me when they</p>
<p>start complaining</p>
<p>about the prices</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so overpriced</p>
<p>and this and that and that and this and i don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>how good the food is 39</p>
<p>for a steak is ridiculous</p>
<p>well no it&rsquo;s not if the guy goes to the butcher mart</p>
<p>himself and make sure he&rsquo;s only getting</p>
<p>grass fed beef from very specific</p>
<p>organic cows</p>
<p>and he brings it to his restaurant this is the whole</p>
<p>point of what</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s serving you he&rsquo;s like the very best shit</p>
<p>from all over the world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re complaining that it costs a few dollars</p>
<p>more like do you not</p>
<p>understand what he&rsquo;s doing here how</p>
<p>about the old</p>
<p>the reason i gave this</p>
<p>three stars instead of</p>
<p>four stars is because when we came into the restaurant</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>the hostess was eating</p>
<p>you know her own meal</p>
<p>and had to finish her</p>
<p>mouthful before she could</p>
<p>speak to us</p>
<p>i got in trouble for one review because i</p>
<p>was so pissed off that i went home and did one of these</p>
<p>really bad reviews that you guys are talking</p>
<p>about gave it one star posted the</p>
<p>photo as being a kid with like hair missing</p>
<p>from his head for some reason you know like a</p>
<p>patch of hair</p>
<p>and i got in</p>
<p>trouble for it</p>
<p>why did you get in trouble</p>
<p>just because of the what i wrote</p>
<p>who did you get in</p>
<p>trouble from what did you write</p>
<p>what you want me to read a little bit no i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i wrote well it was a</p>
<p>seven dollar haircut</p>
<p>and the guy fucked up your hair in the</p>
<p>picture that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really you with fucked up hair and said it was you</p>
<p>yeah so you did a douchey</p>
<p>thing no no no no she just acted like she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never like cut hair in her life</p>
<p>like i was telling her</p>
<p>things and she</p>
<p>would like cut</p>
<p>start cutting the</p>
<p>maybe she was</p>
<p>hypnotized by your beauty</p>
<p>but anyways</p>
<p>maybe you should have busted a move</p>
<p>the worst thing ever</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s what it was man</p>
<p>maybe you just put the</p>
<p>spell on that</p>
<p>bitch she was</p>
<p>maybe it was your pheromone</p>
<p>like i really thought that she got her like</p>
<p>barbershop license</p>
<p>from like she thought the warranty card for the</p>
<p>clippers was like her you know that&rsquo;s all she needed or</p>
<p>something it was that bad like she</p>
<p>never cut hair she</p>
<p>a frowns pun you see him</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>brian frowns</p>
<p>frowns upon the prime</p>
<p>shiva is not happy the</p>
<p>dance of destruction not</p>
<p>happy isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shiva supposed to be the god of cannabis</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that like the yes yeah</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a city in india</p>
<p>called varanasi</p>
<p>where they cremate</p>
<p>this is the city on the ganges</p>
<p>river where they cremate</p>
<p>all the bodies</p>
<p>and i went there</p>
<p>and marijuana&rsquo;s</p>
<p>legal there because apparently</p>
<p>at the end of the</p>
<p>age of kaleuga</p>
<p>as shiva is beginning to destroy the universe</p>
<p>which is now this is khaliyu&rsquo;s</p>
<p>age explain that before you get into anything because</p>
<p>a lot of people don&rsquo;t know what the fuck we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about but the hindus</p>
<p>believe that there are these ages</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>cycles of time</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know the names of all the ages but the one we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically based on</p>
<p>the idea that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>based on like devo&rsquo;s premise</p>
<p>which is that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>de evolving and not</p>
<p>evolving so</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s devo&rsquo;s premise</p>
<p>yeah devo de</p>
<p>evolution that&rsquo;s what they stood for</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s hilarious i did not know that</p>
<p>until right now yeah so</p>
<p>i thought they had cool music</p>
<p>no man they&rsquo;re the de</p>
<p>evolution people</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>but gates of</p>
<p>steel man so kalyuga</p>
<p>is what we&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>basically the idea is this</p>
<p>when you have</p>
<p>fresh fruit</p>
<p>over time it</p>
<p>kind of rots when you have a flower it wilts</p>
<p>humanity&rsquo;s the same way there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cycle there&rsquo;s a golden</p>
<p>age when that started</p>
<p>humans were</p>
<p>super intelligent</p>
<p>supertuna of the universe</p>
<p>and were just wilting and rotting</p>
<p>as we reproduce at massive</p>
<p>rates we&rsquo;re diluting the gene lines and we&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>apparently in the middle of the</p>
<p>age of kaleuga</p>
<p>or at the very beginning of the middle of the</p>
<p>age of kaleuga</p>
<p>and the symptoms of the</p>
<p>age of kaleuga are</p>
<p>forgetfulness</p>
<p>like people are lazy</p>
<p>and so technology</p>
<p>what we consider to be a sign of</p>
<p>things advancing</p>
<p>is actually a sign of</p>
<p>things collapsing the fact that we need</p>
<p>technology and that our focus has turned towards</p>
<p>all the different things that people</p>
<p>think are important now</p>
<p>only shows that we&rsquo;ve gotten really really</p>
<p>stupid when</p>
<p>in the beginning</p>
<p>of time when there wasn&rsquo;t that many people</p>
<p>um language wasn&rsquo;t necessary it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an anarchist what the fuck is that guy&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>i shouldn&rsquo;t have said his name</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really intense</p>
<p>and he shares a similar viewpoint</p>
<p>someone out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s got to know this guy&rsquo;s an anti technologist</p>
<p>and he believes that um</p>
<p>language and</p>
<p>symbols and</p>
<p>paintings and drawings and all of</p>
<p>these things are</p>
<p>aberrations</p>
<p>and that before</p>
<p>the very act</p>
<p>of translating the universe into a</p>
<p>symbol is a lie</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>translate the universe into a</p>
<p>symbol and so</p>
<p>when people</p>
<p>started doing cave drawings to depict the universe</p>
<p>this was the beginning of the</p>
<p>collapse of society because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re interpreting</p>
<p>reality in a way that isn&rsquo;t really reality</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>thing when you&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>conversation with somebody and you know you both agree</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t find the language to express it</p>
<p>and so you just stay in a fight</p>
<p>even though you know</p>
<p>underneath it all is</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you both are on the same page somehow right so</p>
<p>anyway the whole</p>
<p>point is as</p>
<p>in the golden</p>
<p>age people didn&rsquo;t have language they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a written form</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t need it</p>
<p>and then as</p>
<p>things began to collapse the written form</p>
<p>evolved and all the variants of it and</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>age of kali ugaware</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>you know forgotten</p>
<p>everything so how many times did they the hindus</p>
<p>think that these</p>
<p>cycles have repeated themselves over</p>
<p>that question</p>
<p>because the way they</p>
<p>the way they explain it</p>
<p>is they say to know how many times this</p>
<p>cycle has happened</p>
<p>again and again</p>
<p>which is the idea is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the creator</p>
<p>of breathes the universe out</p>
<p>and then sucks it back in it&rsquo;s the pattern of breath so</p>
<p>the number of times that this has happened imagine</p>
<p>the himalayas</p>
<p>and imagine that once</p>
<p>some people say a year some people say</p>
<p>every hundred years a dove</p>
<p>flies over the very top peak of the himalayas</p>
<p>with a scarf</p>
<p>a silk scarf and the silk scarf</p>
<p>touches the very top peak</p>
<p>imagine the number of times</p>
<p>imagine that</p>
<p>that the himalayas had been ground down into a valley</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how many times the universe</p>
<p>has been born and destroyed that number of times</p>
<p>the amount of times it would take</p>
<p>a dove carrying a</p>
<p>scarf to erode it</p>
<p>of course this is not</p>
<p>precise math ideas</p>
<p>the idea is it&rsquo;s infinite</p>
<p>literally it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally possible</p>
<p>to put a number yeah it&rsquo;s impossible to</p>
<p>understand so that this is</p>
<p>these ages have been anticipated over and over and over</p>
<p>again yeah and so do they believe</p>
<p>how long do they believe that</p>
<p>human beings have been here</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know they do have a number for</p>
<p>it so they don&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>human beings are</p>
<p>a few hundred thousand years old</p>
<p>or a million years old</p>
<p>they think we&rsquo;re way way</p>
<p>older than that and they think that</p>
<p>this is the millionth version of</p>
<p>human beings and</p>
<p>that the universe is teeming with life</p>
<p>wow now what about the</p>
<p>vedas did you read</p>
<p>about that did</p>
<p>you read those</p>
<p>explain what that is so</p>
<p>the vedas are the</p>
<p>the collected</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>the collected works of</p>
<p>hinduism which are</p>
<p>which is filled with like</p>
<p>references to flying</p>
<p>saucers and</p>
<p>space people</p>
<p>yeah yeah well i mean you know</p>
<p>yeah exactly it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they use the</p>
<p>term gods or demigods and they believe that</p>
<p>when there was flying</p>
<p>things through the sky what did they call</p>
<p>those things i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that i want to say vishnuz no</p>
<p>well they had no there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>the name there are like flying chariots and stuff</p>
<p>like that yeah</p>
<p>but i mean that&rsquo;s in that&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>every that&rsquo;s in almost</p>
<p>every religion there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>reports of flying</p>
<p>weird flying</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>the book of ezekiel the prophet</p>
<p>is obviously</p>
<p>a ufo if it&rsquo;s anything it&rsquo;s someone talking</p>
<p>about a ufo is that the</p>
<p>wheel within a</p>
<p>wheel yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>but yeah we&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>age of kali yuga</p>
<p>and this is the</p>
<p>age of disintegration and everyone&rsquo;s dumb and everybody</p>
<p>thinks the most important thing is</p>
<p>like fucking and reproducing and what happens next</p>
<p>i suppose what happens next is the apocalypse where</p>
<p>you meet your what is</p>
<p>supposedly in according to the hindus</p>
<p>what is the next state like we go through this this</p>
<p>you know current</p>
<p>age so there&rsquo;s the depiction if you look up kali</p>
<p>who is sheevah&rsquo;s consort</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll see this image of this like</p>
<p>crazy wild haired woman</p>
<p>crazy bitch we&rsquo;re in the year of the crazy</p>
<p>bitch yeah and behind</p>
<p>i would never call callie that but</p>
<p>just out of pure superstition but behind callie</p>
<p>is humanity</p>
<p>so you see fire in all of humanity and there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>apocalypse happening</p>
<p>and colleagues wearing</p>
<p>around her neck a garland of heads and</p>
<p>those heads represent the gods</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s literally decapitated all of the</p>
<p>gods and carries</p>
<p>their heads around and is wearing</p>
<p>their heads</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s holding weapons in her hands but in one hand</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s holding a flower</p>
<p>and that flower represents the next phase wow</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like the idea is like</p>
<p>kind of what&rsquo;s happening right now</p>
<p>which is holy shit that&rsquo;s cool we&rsquo;ve gotten so</p>
<p>smart that now we know of course</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a god with a beard</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>blue skinned god with forearms and there&rsquo;s not i mean</p>
<p>there could be</p>
<p>super intelligent life but by now we know that the</p>
<p>symbol systems that</p>
<p>you know ancient people are</p>
<p>using to describe divinity</p>
<p>or just that</p>
<p>symbol systems</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve deconstructed it now to the</p>
<p>point where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>the way that they were described that&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>a fairy tale</p>
<p>do you subscribe to the idea that most of</p>
<p>these people that have described all</p>
<p>these incredible</p>
<p>experiences really</p>
<p>stumbled upon</p>
<p>psychedelics</p>
<p>do you think that a lot of</p>
<p>these people were</p>
<p>tripping and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where all these</p>
<p>things came from or do you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like ufos</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think is the basis</p>
<p>for all these different religions</p>
<p>especially like the hindus</p>
<p>when you get to</p>
<p>stuff that gets really</p>
<p>really like</p>
<p>a science fiction e almost</p>
<p>i get into the multiple</p>
<p>histories of the universe theory and the idea that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re existing</p>
<p>right now there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>infinite number</p>
<p>of parallel universes that are all happening</p>
<p>around us and i</p>
<p>think that this</p>
<p>would create some kind of like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like an actual</p>
<p>this sounds</p>
<p>crazy but i</p>
<p>think if you were</p>
<p>smart enough you</p>
<p>could map it out with coordinates</p>
<p>like all the different alternate realities</p>
<p>is it possible though if they&rsquo;re infinite though how</p>
<p>could you map them all i</p>
<p>think you could to some certain degree</p>
<p>i think that there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>levels of experience that have been</p>
<p>mapped out and</p>
<p>have been encoded in the form of religion</p>
<p>and those levels of</p>
<p>experience are encounters with divinity</p>
<p>and so when and i</p>
<p>think mckenna said this you know when you get into the</p>
<p>whole ufo thing and the</p>
<p>alien thing and the higher intelligence thing</p>
<p>the extraterrestrial</p>
<p>and the inter</p>
<p>dimensional being kind of become the same thing</p>
<p>so to me it&rsquo;s very easy to believe that there&rsquo;s life on</p>
<p>other planets and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a very high</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible to not believe that in fact</p>
<p>based on what people</p>
<p>say about the expansiveness of the universe</p>
<p>but i also think that</p>
<p>outside of that</p>
<p>existing around us at all times</p>
<p>are other levels of</p>
<p>experience and we know this because we know</p>
<p>about the spectrum of light</p>
<p>you hear it over and over again</p>
<p>radio waves that if you</p>
<p>could tune in you could listen to</p>
<p>rush limbaugh</p>
<p>right now but</p>
<p>i think just in that way</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t see in</p>
<p>touch but they&rsquo;re there there&rsquo;s higher</p>
<p>levels of experience</p>
<p>other than that now</p>
<p>you have talked about</p>
<p>your dimethyltryptaman</p>
<p>experience and</p>
<p>other people have reported this experience and</p>
<p>when they talk</p>
<p>about it there&rsquo;s two possibilities</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two basic possibilities one</p>
<p>the human mind is so fucking powerful</p>
<p>that somehow</p>
<p>under the influence of this drug</p>
<p>it can actually construct an alternate dimension</p>
<p>with super mathematical geometries that</p>
<p>are almost impossible to describe and so potent that it</p>
<p>apparently makes people feel like they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to die from astonishment</p>
<p>as terrence mckinnon</p>
<p>says and i believe you&rsquo;ve said the same thing</p>
<p>that tells you</p>
<p>they literally tell you to relax</p>
<p>they tell you to</p>
<p>relax and try to take it all in and do you</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s your subconscious</p>
<p>trying to tell you that you can find an</p>
<p>experience here that you could take something from this</p>
<p>and you should learn how to</p>
<p>let it happen or</p>
<p>do you think</p>
<p>that something&rsquo;s actually communicating with you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it gets</p>
<p>like really who the fuck knows well see that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>funny thing</p>
<p>about it is it&rsquo;s like this whole</p>
<p>that people</p>
<p>have said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry to interrupt</p>
<p>people have said</p>
<p>about that experience that</p>
<p>they could never have thought that up on</p>
<p>their own so they know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>communicating with them</p>
<p>but i say that&rsquo;s bullshit</p>
<p>like you could know</p>
<p>if you were</p>
<p>under the influence of a drug like</p>
<p>maybe your brain becomes</p>
<p>superpowered and your</p>
<p>creativity becomes</p>
<p>so powerful that you manifest</p>
<p>something that you actually believe is a real thing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s only because something in your</p>
<p>brain is getting jabbed with some new chemical</p>
<p>i mean nobody</p>
<p>wants that possibility to be real</p>
<p>everybody wants</p>
<p>the idea of the more romantic vision is that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tuning into another dimension</p>
<p>and communicating with</p>
<p>aliens but it&rsquo;s also just as possible that</p>
<p>your imagination is fucking insanely</p>
<p>powerful because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to be able to create all sorts of</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>allow people to</p>
<p>change the world it&rsquo;s the iceberg theory of the</p>
<p>human mind we</p>
<p>the very tip we only use 10</p>
<p>of our that&rsquo;s all bullshit</p>
<p>though that&rsquo;s all been proven to be just ignorant</p>
<p>sure you can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>we only use a certain percentage of our</p>
<p>brain but you know there are percentages of our brain</p>
<p>that get used for different things</p>
<p>you can certainly make the</p>
<p>brain work better and do different</p>
<p>things if you add</p>
<p>electrical charges</p>
<p>to it if you add chemicals to it you can</p>
<p>get it to do</p>
<p>weird things</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m more of a theist than you are and i do</p>
<p>think that there are</p>
<p>i think there are higher</p>
<p>levels of intelligence that have their own</p>
<p>consciousness that you continue to i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>open to that idea</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m open to it but i also see no evidence of it</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m open</p>
<p>to it i&rsquo;m a hundred percent open to it but i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna commit to it i</p>
<p>would never say that that is what i</p>
<p>think is real</p>
<p>my problem is i think</p>
<p>when you start</p>
<p>thinking like that when there&rsquo;s no evidence it gets</p>
<p>silly it gets</p>
<p>slippery but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not looking for shit it&rsquo;s not that yes i</p>
<p>agree you could be very</p>
<p>sloppy with this kind of stuff</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>sloppy i know you you you you</p>
<p>do come from</p>
<p>a very real</p>
<p>place it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>logic man it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the logic the</p>
<p>logic is okay</p>
<p>the first question is</p>
<p>do you believe</p>
<p>that we are</p>
<p>the only intelligent beings in</p>
<p>an infinite universe</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>group of people</p>
<p>who believe that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re foolish</p>
<p>right off the bat</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to be foolish</p>
<p>to believe that you&rsquo;d have to be foolish to know why</p>
<p>would you say that you</p>
<p>could ever have</p>
<p>the knowledge</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible at this current</p>
<p>stage of the game</p>
<p>that is an open answer</p>
<p>you cannot answer it</p>
<p>you should never say do you believe there is</p>
<p>intelligent life in the universe i have no information</p>
<p>i have nothing but it&rsquo;s all just speculation yeah but</p>
<p>for me logically</p>
<p>just because the universe is</p>
<p>apparently infinite</p>
<p>in space whatever that means it&rsquo;s a very big place</p>
<p>and just because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know every day they come back with like</p>
<p>we just found another</p>
<p>we just found another</p>
<p>planet that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a planet around a sun</p>
<p>and they have the idea</p>
<p>the goldilocks region</p>
<p>which they call the</p>
<p>perfect place next to the sun</p>
<p>where you need to be for life to exist and</p>
<p>based on just the few that they found</p>
<p>that implication is that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obviously and you know this backwards and forwards</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s millions of planets</p>
<p>surrounding suns and</p>
<p>based on that</p>
<p>there is an extremely high probability</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other life out there</p>
<p>right but it</p>
<p>could be other life that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>alien to us</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t even recognize it we don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>senses to depict it</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be carbon based they</p>
<p>could be beans made of</p>
<p>light they could</p>
<p>be intelligent life made of air</p>
<p>made of a gas we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know super</p>
<p>gigantic beings that are</p>
<p>the size of our galaxy</p>
<p>i mean we might be experiencing that</p>
<p>right now i mean</p>
<p>what i always use is what i call the fart theory</p>
<p>that if you didn&rsquo;t have a nose and someone farted you</p>
<p>have no idea you&rsquo;re sitting there in someone&rsquo;s stench</p>
<p>how do we not</p>
<p>know that there are not an infinite number of</p>
<p>senses that we don&rsquo;t possess</p>
<p>to detect an infinite amount of</p>
<p>things that around us all the time we just don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any senses for</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the ability to tune into it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>the only thing that</p>
<p>limits that is our own</p>
<p>imagination</p>
<p>if space can be infinite</p>
<p>so can possibilities</p>
<p>if the universe</p>
<p>literally is an infinite</p>
<p>place or as</p>
<p>close to infinite as is possible</p>
<p>then so are the possibilities</p>
<p>so are the possibilities of all sorts of different</p>
<p>things you know</p>
<p>about the hitchhiker&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guide of the galaxy the improbability</p>
<p>drive no what is that have you read the hitchhiker&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guide of the galaxy no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very funny is it</p>
<p>good yeah it&rsquo;s pretty good i mean</p>
<p>to be honest i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t read it since</p>
<p>i was in high</p>
<p>school so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably a little cheesy now if i read it but</p>
<p>i still think</p>
<p>about it from time to time</p>
<p>the device that</p>
<p>drives the spaceships</p>
<p>or one of their</p>
<p>spaceships is called an improbability</p>
<p>drive and it</p>
<p>basically came into</p>
<p>existence on</p>
<p>its own because it was so improbable that it</p>
<p>would come into</p>
<p>existence so it sort of manifested itself</p>
<p>which is funny because</p>
<p>in the idea of in the idea of time machines</p>
<p>one of the ways that they think it</p>
<p>might happen is it</p>
<p>might just sort of come into</p>
<p>existence on its own if you just create the</p>
<p>right circumstance for it anyway the</p>
<p>well it makes</p>
<p>sense all you</p>
<p>have to do is you don&rsquo;t have to really have to</p>
<p>create a time machine you just have to create a portal</p>
<p>for a time machine to use well you know the mit</p>
<p>and the time</p>
<p>machine will show up from the future you know the mit</p>
<p>experiment that they did no</p>
<p>so mit had this idea</p>
<p>which is like okay</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>travel why haven&rsquo;t we seen time</p>
<p>travelers yet and so</p>
<p>what they did is</p>
<p>the theory was</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll create a</p>
<p>press conference</p>
<p>with shitloads of scientists almost like a party</p>
<p>where a time traveler</p>
<p>can come to this</p>
<p>moment and communicate whatever he needs to communicate</p>
<p>to the world</p>
<p>and so they</p>
<p>threw this big</p>
<p>thing where they had cameras and scientists and</p>
<p>all this shit</p>
<p>because the idea being that at whatever</p>
<p>point in the future that time</p>
<p>travel was invented they</p>
<p>would know about this they</p>
<p>would know enough that back to</p>
<p>this year what</p>
<p>year was this they did this</p>
<p>i think it was like the 80s</p>
<p>the 80s nobody showed up they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>shit back then</p>
<p>nobody showed up no scientist showed up either no time</p>
<p>travel no time</p>
<p>travel but the</p>
<p>science also showed up i</p>
<p>guess we know</p>
<p>that yeah the scientists showed up</p>
<p>well what they believe</p>
<p>is that none of this is</p>
<p>you know they is</p>
<p>might as well be talking</p>
<p>about fucking the x men</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t really know who the</p>
<p>fuck they are</p>
<p>using that word</p>
<p>but what scientists believe is that when the</p>
<p>first time machine is invented</p>
<p>that will be the moment that all</p>
<p>other time travelers from now</p>
<p>until eternity</p>
<p>get to come back to that</p>
<p>point at any</p>
<p>point in between they&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>flow freely through time</p>
<p>once the door has been open</p>
<p>and until that door is open there will be no time</p>
<p>travelers when we</p>
<p>first started hanging out</p>
<p>you gave me</p>
<p>a marijuana lollipop this is like</p>
<p>right at the beginning of our friendship</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about eating pot or how</p>
<p>strong it was or whatever</p>
<p>and i i still remember this eating it</p>
<p>and then i you would just</p>
<p>started let</p>
<p>let me open up for you on the road</p>
<p>and i think it was</p>
<p>after so we&rsquo;re driving back</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d eat one of</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d never</p>
<p>heard you say</p>
<p>that idea before and i remember you saying that</p>
<p>and right at that moment the pot</p>
<p>started kicking in</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>oh jesus christ</p>
<p>it was so intense man i thought i saw</p>
<p>alien heads</p>
<p>floating in the sky i was just so</p>
<p>freaked out</p>
<p>the idea is so</p>
<p>crazy but what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>crazy is look</p>
<p>just like the atomic bomb</p>
<p>the time machine</p>
<p>is not just possible it&rsquo;s inevitable</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re going to keep</p>
<p>searching if</p>
<p>technology keeps increasing at the exponential rate</p>
<p>that it always has been increasing at</p>
<p>with its complexity with</p>
<p>innovation they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get more and more information</p>
<p>about matter and the</p>
<p>universe and time and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get more and more power</p>
<p>more and more</p>
<p>ability to process</p>
<p>things i mean they just figured out a new</p>
<p>some sort of</p>
<p>a new chip that operates on</p>
<p>lights some quantum</p>
<p>leap in chip</p>
<p>technology and that</p>
<p>computers are</p>
<p>going to be infinitely more</p>
<p>powerful soon than they are now i</p>
<p>think time machines the</p>
<p>first time machine is actually</p>
<p>going to be invented in your head meaning they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to program your head</p>
<p>to go back into the 1940s you</p>
<p>know before they actually will go back and forth dave</p>
<p>i think if you can</p>
<p>think of it it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s a cool</p>
<p>idea though you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna open up your mind</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna open up your</p>
<p>like a hubble</p>
<p>telescope for time</p>
<p>you can peer back in</p>
<p>time or something and</p>
<p>watch it maybe</p>
<p>no you feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re in it you feel like you&rsquo;re back in 1940</p>
<p>you know but your</p>
<p>brain&rsquo;s just making you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re in 1940 i&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about time machines a lot on</p>
<p>stage lately</p>
<p>man i&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of time machine material</p>
<p>now i just think the idea of the concept</p>
<p>is so fascinating and the grandfather paradox is so</p>
<p>fascinating</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>stupid reason</p>
<p>for people to believe that a time machine can</p>
<p>never exist</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a true</p>
<p>story that i tell on</p>
<p>stage that actually really did happen</p>
<p>where a guy came up to me and said that</p>
<p>your time machine joke is</p>
<p>funny but time machine is impossible</p>
<p>the guy wanted to</p>
<p>argue that time machines could</p>
<p>never be impossible because of the grandfathers oh</p>
<p>great you know the grandfather</p>
<p>paradox sure</p>
<p>the paradox says</p>
<p>if a time machine was real</p>
<p>you could go back in time and kill your grandfather</p>
<p>before your father was ever born thus</p>
<p>you could never been born to make a time machine</p>
<p>just like the most</p>
<p>ridiculous logic ever</p>
<p>like just because</p>
<p>first of all just because you</p>
<p>could go back in time and kill your grandfather and you</p>
<p>would cease to exist</p>
<p>just because you</p>
<p>could do that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>it means you</p>
<p>could and maybe people</p>
<p>would and yeah they</p>
<p>would cease to</p>
<p>exist and yeah it</p>
<p>would break time</p>
<p>i mean yeah it&rsquo;s possible that if people</p>
<p>could really go back in time they</p>
<p>could break time you know</p>
<p>about john teedor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nonsense but no</p>
<p>it is nonsense of course but</p>
<p>the way that he dealt with that</p>
<p>paradox which i</p>
<p>think is really</p>
<p>smart is that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>traveling back in time you&rsquo;re not really</p>
<p>traveling back in time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re traveling into an</p>
<p>alternate like</p>
<p>multiple universe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s similar to ours</p>
<p>and the further back you go</p>
<p>which is a really smart</p>
<p>thing that he</p>
<p>added to the hoax because</p>
<p>it made it so that his</p>
<p>predictions</p>
<p>could be off</p>
<p>a lot because they&rsquo;re not in this</p>
<p>dimension because they&rsquo;re not in this dimension but</p>
<p>the further back you go the more the timelines kind of</p>
<p>start splitting</p>
<p>apart and diverging so events</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t line up exactly the same way</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>idea of infinite universes saddened</p>
<p>people you know</p>
<p>when something looks that big it makes people depressed</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>you tell people like</p>
<p>maybe there are infinite lives that we are all living</p>
<p>you know all consecutively all</p>
<p>right next to each</p>
<p>other and they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>completely different</p>
<p>the idea that was like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i am just barely getting through the pack</p>
<p>the fact that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>living here in america</p>
<p>on earth in</p>
<p>2010 i&rsquo;m barely</p>
<p>barely wrapping my</p>
<p>head around that</p>
<p>the idea that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s billions and billions and then that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna redo this</p>
<p>every 15 billion years is</p>
<p>gonna be a new big bang</p>
<p>and people are gonna</p>
<p>eventually evolve</p>
<p>out of amoebas and fish and fucking lizards and</p>
<p>rabbits and</p>
<p>monkeys and and humans</p>
<p>really it just keeps</p>
<p>going over and over and over and over and over and over</p>
<p>again can i tell you my new theory of reincarnation yes</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>intense because i thought of this and it</p>
<p>freaked me out it&rsquo;s pretty horrible</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the common idea</p>
<p>of reincarnation if you subscribe to the theory</p>
<p>is that you die</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>again you go through your childhood</p>
<p>you grow up</p>
<p>and then you die</p>
<p>maybe you get born as a cat</p>
<p>maybe a butterfly</p>
<p>maybe an amoeba</p>
<p>this is what i was thinking</p>
<p>cause i had a dream once</p>
<p>and in this dream</p>
<p>i was a kid</p>
<p>a little girl</p>
<p>and my mom was rubbing my head</p>
<p>and i knew i was dying</p>
<p>but i didn&rsquo;t know what that meant</p>
<p>except i knew it was bad</p>
<p>and i could kind of feel myself fading out</p>
<p>there was this</p>
<p>white sort of</p>
<p>thing happening and then i woke up</p>
<p>out of the dream like fuck what a shitty</p>
<p>dream so i was</p>
<p>thinking like oh fuck</p>
<p>what if that&rsquo;s what reincarnation is</p>
<p>what if when you die</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re driving home one night</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve had too many pot lollipops</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re listening to</p>
<p>coast to coast someone says something</p>
<p>shocking that makes you look away from the road</p>
<p>you swerve off you slam into a tree</p>
<p>you wake up</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re here back in your</p>
<p>house like ah fuck what a shitty dream</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve really died you just reincarnated</p>
<p>again into an</p>
<p>alternate reality in an alternate reality so you</p>
<p>literally can&rsquo;t die</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no break</p>
<p>this just goes on forever and ever and ever and ever</p>
<p>no break no stopping no new age</p>
<p>going into the</p>
<p>light and seeing</p>
<p>your parents and your family and taking a</p>
<p>going to some new</p>
<p>age cosmic spa</p>
<p>where you get to</p>
<p>shake off all your shitty karma</p>
<p>it never stops</p>
<p>it just keeps happening</p>
<p>again and again</p>
<p>maybe like right now there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>earthquake and the ceiling collapses</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;re just some daydreaming</p>
<p>cabby in boston like wow that was fucking weird</p>
<p>just imagining i was a comedian in la but</p>
<p>you know what i mean well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bizarre you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna change lives you</p>
<p>just snap into</p>
<p>another alternate life you</p>
<p>become the guy who rides this body out yeah you snap</p>
<p>into an alternate life with all your memories embedded</p>
<p>everything already embedded in there because it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>infinite it goes</p>
<p>on forever what if your consciousness is living a</p>
<p>bunch of different lives simultaneously</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t see them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an</p>
<p>office filled with cubicles and no one&rsquo;s poking</p>
<p>their head over the top of the cubicle yeah</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>rolling at the same time yeah or like the way i thought</p>
<p>about it is like</p>
<p>if there was like something this</p>
<p>sounds really crazy but</p>
<p>imagine that each of your fingers this</p>
<p>sounds insane</p>
<p>but imagine like each of your fingers had</p>
<p>their own personality and their own</p>
<p>consciousness or something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like and you</p>
<p>could stick them</p>
<p>through some kind of hole where they</p>
<p>would forget they were attached to your hand and they</p>
<p>would just think that they were</p>
<p>their own individual</p>
<p>selves you know what i mean</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s what we are we&rsquo;re just like little fingers</p>
<p>protruding into this dimension from some infinite thing</p>
<p>but the product of protruding</p>
<p>into this dimension is we get instantaneous amnesia</p>
<p>and part of like dealing with the</p>
<p>shock of coming into this dimension</p>
<p>is we forget our true</p>
<p>identity and replace it with our ego</p>
<p>structures wow</p>
<p>well one of the</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>yeah son one of the</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>you did quite a</p>
<p>bunch when you were my roommate</p>
<p>duncan lived with me a few years back for</p>
<p>a few months happy</p>
<p>happy it wasn&rsquo;t a few</p>
<p>months it was like</p>
<p>three weeks</p>
<p>two or three weeks it was</p>
<p>you were so awesome</p>
<p>anyway duncan</p>
<p>one of my best friends</p>
<p>great guy and</p>
<p>came over and was</p>
<p>getting the tank all the time</p>
<p>so for me it was fascinating because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve offered the tank</p>
<p>to so many of my friends i&rsquo;ve offered to so many people</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about it that</p>
<p>weirds people the fuck out you</p>
<p>know very few of them</p>
<p>when tate lived here he barely got in that thing</p>
<p>and i was like how are you not in that</p>
<p>thing every day</p>
<p>we have the opportunity</p>
<p>to literally that is a</p>
<p>gateway to the center of the universe that&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>spaceship right there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a spaceship to</p>
<p>inner space</p>
<p>you climb in that</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get rocketed into interspace it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there it&rsquo;s in the basement you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna use that shit</p>
<p>but for whatever</p>
<p>reason most dudes are scared of it you jumped in that</p>
<p>thing man you were in that</p>
<p>thing a lot</p>
<p>well because</p>
<p>at like for a very long time i wanted to go in</p>
<p>one of those</p>
<p>things because i was</p>
<p>you know i knew</p>
<p>about john lilly and also of course the altered</p>
<p>states the movie</p>
<p>where the guy turns into a monkey</p>
<p>always wanted to want to go</p>
<p>i want to go on that one now</p>
<p>that fucking</p>
<p>thing if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>his tank it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>evolved when i was</p>
<p>when i was here</p>
<p>you used to pee in his old tank didn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>when you used to go in it you said you did</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t pee</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an asshole i</p>
<p>never i&rsquo;ve met brunch</p>
<p>but the old tank was like it was cool looking</p>
<p>but this fucking</p>
<p>thing looks like a holodeck down there some steel</p>
<p>giant weird</p>
<p>things like a refrigerator</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s this that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>mothership man</p>
<p>that thing puts you into</p>
<p>right shoots you into</p>
<p>inner space</p>
<p>i mean really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really what it is i mean</p>
<p>what is space</p>
<p>space is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to be flying out into the infinite</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>space like the fucking</p>
<p>space in your head because that</p>
<p>truly is infinite</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about</p>
<p>running into asteroids or there&rsquo;s nothing out there</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s just free open energy and no</p>
<p>your body is not connected it&rsquo;s just the line</p>
<p>well when i was staying with</p>
<p>you it was because i&rsquo;d been living with a girl and the</p>
<p>whole thing collapsed i don&rsquo;t want to talk</p>
<p>about that but</p>
<p>it was really cool to go into the so</p>
<p>when i moved into</p>
<p>burt with joe</p>
<p>he was very</p>
<p>kind and he&rsquo;s like you have unlimited access</p>
<p>to my weed my flotation tank</p>
<p>which was a super</p>
<p>i mean if you&rsquo;ve ever been out</p>
<p>just gotten out of a shitty relationship</p>
<p>that is like an incredible gift to give someone</p>
<p>but the combination of the weed</p>
<p>and the flotation tank and just</p>
<p>just everything collapsing around you when you go</p>
<p>into when i went to the tank the first time</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s like a period</p>
<p>where nothing&rsquo;s really happening you</p>
<p>gotta learn to</p>
<p>relax you gotta</p>
<p>relax but all of a</p>
<p>sudden the big</p>
<p>experience i had was</p>
<p>all these like</p>
<p>memories of the relationship</p>
<p>started appearing in</p>
<p>front of me like</p>
<p>and this sounds so like a seminar</p>
<p>like when you know when you do a</p>
<p>multi chat on apple</p>
<p>you know what i mean i</p>
<p>swear to god it was like</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s when we were at the beach</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s when we first met</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all playing out in this like</p>
<p>with such great detail that uh</p>
<p>i my normal memories</p>
<p>never works like that but it was you</p>
<p>could just see these</p>
<p>things happening</p>
<p>that you never noticed before</p>
<p>and you would just come out of the tank</p>
<p>after having</p>
<p>these vivid memories</p>
<p>completely depressed like great</p>
<p>thanks tank</p>
<p>thanks for walking</p>
<p>me through my miserable relationship that was</p>
<p>you know if i had more</p>
<p>time machine</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure better</p>
<p>things well you know what it is is</p>
<p>those are the</p>
<p>things that are bothering you</p>
<p>those are the memories</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re suppressing</p>
<p>those that&rsquo;s the pain the fact that</p>
<p>you were deeply in love and you were in this beautiful</p>
<p>a place and now you&rsquo;re without it</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>taken away from you</p>
<p>like a limb</p>
<p>like a limb that you miss like a part of</p>
<p>one of your</p>
<p>organs or something</p>
<p>a part of your soul</p>
<p>and the tank wants you to be</p>
<p>aware of that the tank wants</p>
<p>all the things that fuck with you like i can&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>secrets in my head and go in the tank</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no secrets</p>
<p>anything you don&rsquo;t want to talk about</p>
<p>tanks like hey</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get this out in the</p>
<p>front let&rsquo;s pull this out in the</p>
<p>front and get a spotlight on it</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s fucking with your head it&rsquo;s the key to</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to say enlightenment but the key to peace</p>
<p>the key to peace</p>
<p>with the human mind</p>
<p>is dealing with all your issues</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bothering you anything that&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>right anything</p>
<p>the tank exposes all that shit very</p>
<p>psychedelic in that respect</p>
<p>whereas it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>introspective like</p>
<p>deep and sort of</p>
<p>somewhat kind of abrasive and disturbing you know it</p>
<p>forces you to</p>
<p>look at yourself well it always is i mean that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing it always</p>
<p>anything you&rsquo;re trying to ignore is always</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always disturbing it&rsquo;s like puking</p>
<p>right but a</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experience drags that</p>
<p>stuff out always and that&rsquo;s why people are always like</p>
<p>no i would never</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>smoking pot because it makes me nervous it makes me</p>
<p>anxious and it&rsquo;s like well yeah</p>
<p>yeah really it&rsquo;s not making you anxious it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deeply in debt or your</p>
<p>whatever the millions of</p>
<p>things you&rsquo;re trying to pretend</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t happening in your what you&rsquo;re an alcoholic</p>
<p>whatever all the</p>
<p>things are trying to deny that</p>
<p>right under the surface</p>
<p>when you get</p>
<p>stone that comes</p>
<p>it comes up</p>
<p>and you have to deal with it</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>secrets you can&rsquo;t hide your</p>
<p>secrets from weed</p>
<p>weeds too smart</p>
<p>and the end</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
