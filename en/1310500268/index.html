    <p>If you read a half hour a night,</p>
<p>the calculation I came to is that you can read</p>
<p>a thousand books in 50 years.</p>
<p>All of the components are there</p>
<p>to engineer intimate experiences.</p>
<p>Extraterrestrial life is a true mystery,</p>
<p>the most tantalizing mystery of all.</p>
<p>How many humans need to disappear</p>
<p>for us to be completely lost?</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Tim Urban,</p>
<p>author and illustrator of the amazing blog</p>
<p>called Wait, But Why?</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Tim Urban.</p>
<p>You wrote a Wait, But Why blog post</p>
<p>about the big and the small,</p>
<p>from the observable universe to the atom.</p>
<p>What world do you find most mysterious or beautiful,</p>
<p>the very big or the very small?</p>
<p>The very small seems a lot more mysterious.</p>
<p>And I mean, the very big I feel like we kind of understand.</p>
<p>I mean, not the very, very big.</p>
<p>Not the multiverse, if there is a multiverse,</p>
<p>not anything outside of the observable universe.</p>
<p>But the very small,</p>
<p>I think we really have no idea what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>or very much less idea.</p>
<p>But I find that,</p>
<p>so I think the small is more mysterious,</p>
<p>but I think the big is sexier.</p>
<p>I just cannot get enough of the bigness of space</p>
<p>and the farness of stars.</p>
<p>And it just continually blows my mind.</p>
<p>I mean, we still,</p>
<p>the vastness of the observable universe</p>
<p>has the mystery that we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>We know how it works, perhaps.</p>
<p>Like, general relativity can tell us</p>
<p>how the movement of bodies works,</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re born, all that kind of things.</p>
<p>But like, how many civilizations are out there?</p>
<p>How many, like, what are the weird things that are out there?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, life.</p>
<p>Well, extraterrestrial life is a true mystery.</p>
<p>The most tantalizing mystery of all.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like our size.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s maybe it&rsquo;s that the actual,</p>
<p>the big and the small are really cool,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually the things that are potentially our size</p>
<p>that are the most tantalizing.</p>
<p>Potentially our size is probably the key word.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>I wonder how small intelligent life could get.</p>
<p>Probably not that small.</p>
<p>And I assume that there&rsquo;s a limit that you&rsquo;re not gonna,</p>
<p>I mean, you might have like a whale,</p>
<p>blue whale size intelligent being,</p>
<p>that would be kind of cool.</p>
<p>But I feel like we&rsquo;re in the range of order of magnitude</p>
<p>smaller and bigger than us for life.</p>
<p>But maybe not.</p>
<p>Maybe you could have some giant life form.</p>
<p>Just seems like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be some reason that anything intelligent</p>
<p>between kind of like a little tiny rodent</p>
<p>or finger monkey up to a blue whale on this planet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe when you change the gravity and other things.</p>
<p>Well, you could think of life</p>
<p>as a thing of self assembling organisms</p>
<p>and they just get bigger and bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no such thing as a human being.</p>
<p>A human being is made up of a bunch of tiny organisms</p>
<p>working together.</p>
<p>And we somehow envision that as one entity</p>
<p>because it has consciousness.</p>
<p>But maybe it&rsquo;s just organisms on top of organisms.</p>
<p>Organisms all the way down, turtles all the way down.</p>
<p>So like earth can be seen as an organism</p>
<p>for people, for alien species that&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>Like why is the human the fundamental entity</p>
<p>that is living and then everything else</p>
<p>is just either a collection of humans</p>
<p>or components of humans?</p>
<p>I think if it kind of is, if you think about,</p>
<p>I think of like an emergence elevator.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve got an ant is on one floor</p>
<p>and then the ant colony is a floor above.</p>
<p>Or maybe there&rsquo;s even units within the colony</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one floor above and the full colony</p>
<p>is two floors above.</p>
<p>And to me, I think that it&rsquo;s the colony</p>
<p>that is closest to being the animal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the individual thing that competes with others</p>
<p>while the individual ants are like cells</p>
<p>in the animal&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>We are more like a colony in that regard.</p>
<p>But the humans are weird because we kind of,</p>
<p>I think of it, if emergence happens in an emergence tower,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got kind of, as I said,</p>
<p>cells and then humans and communities and societies.</p>
<p>Ants are very specific.</p>
<p>The individual ants are always cooperating</p>
<p>with each other for the sake of the colony.</p>
<p>So the colony is this unit that is the competitive unit.</p>
<p>Humans can kind of go,</p>
<p>we take the elevator up and down</p>
<p>emergence tower psychologically.</p>
<p>Sometimes we are individuals</p>
<p>that are competing with other individuals</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where our mindset is.</p>
<p>And then other times we get in this crazy zone,</p>
<p>you know, a protest or a sporting event</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just chanting and screaming</p>
<p>and doing the same hand motions</p>
<p>with all these other people and you feel like one.</p>
<p>You feel like one, you know, and you&rsquo;d sacrifice yourself.</p>
<p>And now that&rsquo;s what, you know, soldiers.</p>
<p>And so our brains can kind of psychologically</p>
<p>go up and down this elevator in an interesting way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder how much of that</p>
<p>is just the narrative we tell ourselves.</p>
<p>Maybe we are just like an ant colony.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just collaborating always,</p>
<p>even in our stories of individualism,</p>
<p>of like the freedom of the individual,</p>
<p>like this kind of isolation,</p>
<p>lone man on an island kind of thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually all part of this giant network</p>
<p>of maybe one of the things that makes humans who we are</p>
<p>is probably deeply social,</p>
<p>the ability to maintain</p>
<p>not just the single human intelligence,</p>
<p>but like a collective intelligence.</p>
<p>And so this feeling like individual</p>
<p>is just because we woke up at this level of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>So we make it special,</p>
<p>but we very well could be just part of the ant colony.</p>
<p>This whole conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m either going to be doing a Shakespearean analysis</p>
<p>of your Twitter, your writing,</p>
<p>or very specific statements that you&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve written answers to a mailbag of questions.</p>
<p>The questions were amazing, the ones you&rsquo;ve chosen,</p>
<p>and your answers were amazing.</p>
<p>So on this topic of the big and the small,</p>
<p>somebody asked, are we bigger than we are small?</p>
<p>Or smaller than we are big?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s asking these questions?</p>
<p>This is really good.</p>
<p>You have amazing fans.</p>
<p>Okay, so where do we sit at this level</p>
<p>of the very small to the very big?</p>
<p>So are we bigger or are we small?</p>
<p>Are we bigger than we are small?</p>
<p>I think it depends on what we&rsquo;re asking here.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re talking about the biggest thing</p>
<p>that we kind of can talk about without just imagining</p>
<p>is the observable universe, the Hubble sphere.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about 10 to the 26th meters in diameter.</p>
<p>The smallest thing we talk about is a plank length,</p>
<p>but you could argue that that&rsquo;s kind of an imaginary thing.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s 10 to the negative 35.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re about, conveniently, about 10 to the one.</p>
<p>Not quite, 10 to the zero.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about 10 to the zero meters long.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easy because you can just look and say,</p>
<p>okay, well, for example, atoms are like 10</p>
<p>to the negative 15th or 10 to the negative 16th meters</p>
<p>across, right?</p>
<p>If you go 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 16th,</p>
<p>which is right, that&rsquo;s now.</p>
<p>So an atom to us is us to this.</p>
<p>You get to like nebulas, smaller than a galaxy</p>
<p>and bigger than the biggest star.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re right in between nebula and an atom.</p>
<p>Now, if you wanna go down to quark level,</p>
<p>you might be able to get up to galaxy level.</p>
<p>When you go up to the observable universe,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting down on the small side</p>
<p>to things that we, I think, are mostly theoretically</p>
<p>imagining are there and hypothesizing are there.</p>
<p>So I think as far as real world objects</p>
<p>that we really know a lot about,</p>
<p>I would say we are smaller than we are big.</p>
<p>But if you wanna go down to the Planck length,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re very quickly, we&rsquo;re bigger than we are small.</p>
<p>If you think about strings.</p>
<p>Yeah, strings, exactly, string theory and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But I think like you answered,</p>
<p>no matter what, we&rsquo;re kind of middleish.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, here&rsquo;s something cool.</p>
<p>If a human is a neutrino, and again, neutrino,</p>
<p>the size doesn&rsquo;t really make sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really a size.</p>
<p>But when we talk about some of these neutrinos,</p>
<p>I mean, if a neutrino is a human, a proton is the sun.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like, I mean, a proton is real small,</p>
<p>like really small.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, the small gets like crazy small very quickly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about aliens.</p>
<p>We already mentioned it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start just by with the basic,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your intuition as of today?</p>
<p>This is a thing that could change day by day.</p>
<p>But how many alien civilizations out there?</p>
<p>Is it zero?</p>
<p>Is it a handful?</p>
<p>Is it almost endless, like the observable universe</p>
<p>or the universe is teeming with life?</p>
<p>If I had gun to my head, I have to take a guess.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s teeming with life.</p>
<p>I would say there is.</p>
<p>I think running a Monte Carlo simulation,</p>
<p>this paper by Andrew Sandberg and Drexler</p>
<p>and a few others a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>I think you probably know about it.</p>
<p>I think the mean,</p>
<p>using different,</p>
<p>running through randomized rake equation multiplication,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ended up with 27 million as the mean</p>
<p>of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy,</p>
<p>in the Milky Way alone.</p>
<p>And so then if you go outside the Milky Way,</p>
<p>that would turn into trillions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the mean.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting is that there&rsquo;s a long tail</p>
<p>because they believe some of these multipliers</p>
<p>in the Drake equation.</p>
<p>So for example, the probability that life starts</p>
<p>in the first place,</p>
<p>they think that the kind of range that we use</p>
<p>is for that variable or is way too small.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s constraining our possibilities.</p>
<p>And if you actually extend it to some crazy number</p>
<p>of orders of magnitude, like 200,</p>
<p>they think that that variable should be,</p>
<p>you get this long tail where,</p>
<p>I forget the exact number,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a third or a quarter</p>
<p>of the total outcomes have us alone.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a sizable percentage has us</p>
<p>as the only intelligent life in the galaxy,</p>
<p>but you can keep going.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s like a non zero,</p>
<p>like legitimate amount of outcomes there</p>
<p>that have us as the only life</p>
<p>in the observable universe at all is on earth.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems incredibly counterintuitive.</p>
<p>It seems like, you mentioned that people think</p>
<p>you must be an idiot because if you picked up one grain</p>
<p>of sand on a beach and examined it</p>
<p>and you found all these little things on it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like saying, well, maybe this is the only one</p>
<p>that has that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, probably not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably most of the sand probably</p>
<p>or a lot of the sand, right?</p>
<p>So, and then the other hand, we don&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see any evidence, which of course,</p>
<p>people would say that the people who stuff scoff</p>
<p>at the concept that we&rsquo;re potentially alone,</p>
<p>they say, well, of course, there&rsquo;s lots of reasons</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have seen anything.</p>
<p>And they can go list them and they&rsquo;re very compelling,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And the truth is if there were,</p>
<p>if this were a freak thing, I mean, we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if this were a completely freak thing that happened here,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s life at all or just getting</p>
<p>to this level of intelligence,</p>
<p>that species, whoever it was, would think</p>
<p>there must be lots of us out there and they&rsquo;d be wrong.</p>
<p>So just being, again, using the same intuition</p>
<p>that most people would use, I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s probably lots</p>
<p>of other things out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you wrote a great blog post about it.</p>
<p>But to me, the two interesting reasons</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t been in contact, I too have an intuition</p>
<p>that the universe is teeming with life.</p>
<p>So one interesting is around the great filter.</p>
<p>So we either, the great filter&rsquo;s either behind us</p>
<p>or in front of us.</p>
<p>So the reason that&rsquo;s interesting is you get to think</p>
<p>about what kind of things ensure</p>
<p>or ensure the survival of an intelligent civilization</p>
<p>or lead to the destruction of intelligent civilization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very pragmatic, very important question</p>
<p>to always be asking.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about some of those.</p>
<p>And then the other one is I&rsquo;m saddened by the possibility</p>
<p>that there could be aliens communicating</p>
<p>with us all the time.</p>
<p>In fact, they may have visited.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just too dumb to hear it, to see it.</p>
<p>Like the idea that the kind of life that can evolve</p>
<p>is just the range of life that can evolve is so large</p>
<p>that our narrow view of what is life</p>
<p>and what is intelligent life is preventing us</p>
<p>from having communication with them.</p>
<p>But then they don&rsquo;t seem very smart</p>
<p>because if they were trying to communicate with us,</p>
<p>they would surely, if they were super intelligent,</p>
<p>they would be very, I&rsquo;m sure if there&rsquo;s lots of life,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not that rare, we&rsquo;re not some crazy weird species</p>
<p>that hears and has different kinds of ways</p>
<p>of perceiving signals.</p>
<p>So they would probably be able to,</p>
<p>if you really wanted to communicate</p>
<p>with an earth like species, with a human like species,</p>
<p>you would send out all kinds of things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d send out radio waves and you send out gravity waves</p>
<p>and lots of things.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re communicating in a way,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to communicate with us</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;re too dumb to perceive the signals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, they&rsquo;re not doing a great job</p>
<p>of considering the primitive species we might be.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, I think if a super intelligent species</p>
<p>wanted to get in touch with us and had the capability of,</p>
<p>I think probably they would.</p>
<p>Well, they may be getting in touch with us,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just getting in touch with the thing</p>
<p>that we humans are not understanding</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re getting in touch with us with.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what I was trying to say is</p>
<p>there could be something about earth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more special than us humans.</p>
<p>Like the nature of the intelligence that&rsquo;s on earth</p>
<p>or the thing that&rsquo;s of value and that&rsquo;s curious</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s complicated and fascinating and beautiful</p>
<p>might be something that&rsquo;s not just like tweets, okay?</p>
<p>Like English language that&rsquo;s interpretable</p>
<p>or any kind of language or any kind of signal,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s gravity or radio signal</p>
<p>that humans seem to appreciate.</p>
<p>Why not the actual, it could be the process</p>
<p>of evolution itself.</p>
<p>There could be something about the way</p>
<p>that earth is breathing essentially</p>
<p>through the creation of life</p>
<p>and this complex growth of life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a whole different way</p>
<p>to view organisms and view life</p>
<p>that could be getting communicated with.</p>
<p>And we humans are just a tiny fingertip</p>
<p>on top of that intelligence.</p>
<p>And the communication is happening</p>
<p>with the main mothership of earth</p>
<p>versus us humans that seem to treat ourselves</p>
<p>as super important and we&rsquo;re missing the big picture.</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds crazy, but our understanding</p>
<p>of what is intelligent, of what is life,</p>
<p>what is consciousness is very limited.</p>
<p>And it seems to be, and just being very suspicious,</p>
<p>it seems to be awfully human centric.</p>
<p>Like this story, it seems like the progress of science</p>
<p>is constantly putting humans down on the importance,</p>
<p>humans down on the cosmic importance,</p>
<p>the ranking of how big we are, how important we are.</p>
<p>That seems to be the more we discover</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And I think science is very young.</p>
<p>And so I think eventually we might figure out</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something much, much bigger going on,</p>
<p>that humans are just a curious little side effect</p>
<p>of the much bigger thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, I mean, that, as I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>it just sounds insane, but.</p>
<p>Well, it just, it sounds a little like religious.</p>
<p>It sounds like a spiritual, it gets to that realm</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s something that more than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but not, so religious and spiritual,</p>
<p>often have this kind of whoo whoo characteristic,</p>
<p>like when people write books about them,</p>
<p>then go to wars over whatever the heck</p>
<p>is written in those books.</p>
<p>I mean, more like it&rsquo;s possible that collective intelligence</p>
<p>is more important than individual intelligence, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ant colony.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the primal organism?</p>
<p>Is it the ant colony or is it the ant?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, humans, just like any individual ant</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do shit, but the colony can do,</p>
<p>make this incredible structures and has this intelligence.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re exactly the same.</p>
<p>I mean, you know the famous thing that no one,</p>
<p>no human knows how to make a pencil.</p>
<p>Have you heard this?</p>
<p>No. Basically, I mean.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not, a single human out there</p>
<p>has absolutely no idea how to make a pencil.</p>
<p>So you have to think about, you have to get the wood,</p>
<p>the paint, the different chemicals</p>
<p>that make up the yellow paint.</p>
<p>The eraser is a whole other thing.</p>
<p>The metal has to be mined from somewhere</p>
<p>and then the graphite, whatever that is.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not one person on earth</p>
<p>who knows how to kind of collect all those materials</p>
<p>and create a pencil, but together,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the, that&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s play.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of the easiest things.</p>
<p>So, you know, the other thing I like to think about,</p>
<p>I actually put this as a question on the blog once.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thought experiment</p>
<p>and I actually wanna hear what you think.</p>
<p>So if a witch, kind of a dickish witch comes around</p>
<p>and she says, I&rsquo;m gonna cast a spell on all of humanity</p>
<p>and all material things that you&rsquo;ve invented</p>
<p>are gonna disappear all at once.</p>
<p>So suddenly we&rsquo;re all standing there naked.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no buildings.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no cars and boats and ships and no mines,</p>
<p>nothing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the stone age earth and a bunch of naked humans,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re all the same, we have the same brain.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And we all got a note from her, so we understand the deal.</p>
<p>And she says, she communicated to every human,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the deal, you lost all your stuff.</p>
<p>You guys need to make one working iPhone 13</p>
<p>and you make one working iPhone 13</p>
<p>that could pass in the Apple store today,</p>
<p>you know, in your previous world</p>
<p>for an iPhone 13, then I will restore everything.</p>
<p>How long do you think?</p>
<p>And so everyone knows this is the mission.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all aware of the mission, everyone, all humans.</p>
<p>How long would it take us?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting question.</p>
<p>So obviously if you do a random selection</p>
<p>of 100 or a thousand humans within the population,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re screwed to make that iPhone.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that there&rsquo;s fascinating specialization</p>
<p>among the human civilization.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a few hackers out there</p>
<p>that can like solo build an iPhone.</p>
<p>But with what materials?</p>
<p>So no materials whatsoever.</p>
<p>It has to, I mean, it&rsquo;s virtually, I mean, okay.</p>
<p>You have to build factories.</p>
<p>I mean, to fabricate.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And how are you gonna mine them?</p>
<p>You know, you gotta mine the materials</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have any cranes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have any, you know.</p>
<p>Okay, you 100% have to have the, everybody&rsquo;s naked.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s naked and everyone&rsquo;s where they are.</p>
<p>So you and I would currently be naked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the ground in what used to be Manhattan.</p>
<p>So no building.</p>
<p>No, grassy island.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you need a naked Elon Musk type character</p>
<p>to then start building a company.</p>
<p>You have to have a large company then.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t even know where he, you know,</p>
<p>where is everyone?</p>
<p>You know, oh shit, how am I gonna find</p>
<p>other people I need to talk to?</p>
<p>But we have all the knowledge of.</p>
<p>Yeah, everyone has the knowledge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in their current brains.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met some legit engineers.</p>
<p>Crazy polymath people.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the actual labor of,</p>
<p>cause you said, cause like the original Mac,</p>
<p>like the Apple II, that can be built.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Even that, you know.</p>
<p>Even that&rsquo;s gonna be tough.</p>
<p>Well, I think part of it is a communication problem.</p>
<p>If you could suddenly have, you know, someone,</p>
<p>if everyone had a walkie talkie</p>
<p>and there was, you know, a couple, you know,</p>
<p>10 really smart people were designated the leaders,</p>
<p>they could say, okay, I want, you know,</p>
<p>everyone who can do this to walk west, you know,</p>
<p>until you get to this little hub and everyone else,</p>
<p>you know, and they could actually coordinate,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like people just, you know,</p>
<p>and then what I think about is,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ve got some people that are like trying to organize</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have a little community</p>
<p>where a couple hundred people have come together</p>
<p>and maybe a couple thousand have organized</p>
<p>and they designated one person, you know, as the leader</p>
<p>and then they have sub leaders and okay,</p>
<p>we have a start here.</p>
<p>We have some organization.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also gonna have some people that say, good,</p>
<p>humans were scourged upon the earth and this is good.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna try to sabotage.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna try to murder the people with the,</p>
<p>and who know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The elite that possessed the knowledge.</p>
<p>Well, and so everyone, maybe everyone&rsquo;s hopeful</p>
<p>for the, you know, we&rsquo;re all civilized and hopeful</p>
<p>for the first 30 days or something.</p>
<p>And then things start to fall off.</p>
<p>They, you know, people get, start to lose hope</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s new kinds of, you know,</p>
<p>new kinds of governments popping up, you know,</p>
<p>new kinds of societies and they&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t play nicely with the other ones.</p>
<p>And I think very quickly,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people would just give up and say,</p>
<p>you know what, this is it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back in the stone age.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just create, you know, agrarian.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t also don&rsquo;t know how to farm.</p>
<p>No one knows how to farm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, even the farmers, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of them are relying on their machines.</p>
<p>And so we also, you know, mass starvation.</p>
<p>And that, you know, when you&rsquo;re trying to organize,</p>
<p>a lot of people are, you know, coming in with, you know,</p>
<p>spears they&rsquo;ve fashioned and trying to murder everyone</p>
<p>who has food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>Given today&rsquo;s society, how much violence would that be?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten softer, less violent.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have weapons.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something. We don&rsquo;t have weapons.</p>
<p>We have really primitive weapons now.</p>
<p>But we have, and also we have a kind of ethics</p>
<p>where murder is bad.</p>
<p>We used to be less, like human life was less valued</p>
<p>in the past.</p>
<p>So murder was more okay, like ethically.</p>
<p>But in the past, they also were really good</p>
<p>at figuring out how to have sustenance.</p>
<p>They knew how to get food and water because they,</p>
<p>so we have no idea.</p>
<p>Like the ancient hunter gatherer societies would laugh</p>
<p>at what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d say, you guys, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>none of you know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also the amount of people feeding this amount of people</p>
<p>in a very, in a stone age, you know, civilization,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>So New York and San Francisco are screwed.</p>
<p>Well, whoever&rsquo;s not near water is really screwed.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re near a river or freshwater river.</p>
<p>And you know, anyway, it&rsquo;s a very interesting question.</p>
<p>And what it does, this and the pencil,</p>
<p>it makes me feel so grateful and like excited about like,</p>
<p>man, our civilization is so cool.</p>
<p>And this is, talk about collective intelligence.</p>
<p>Humans did not build any of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s collective human super,</p>
<p>collective humans is a super intelligent,</p>
<p>you know, being that is, that can do absolutely,</p>
<p>especially over a long period of time,</p>
<p>can do such magical things.</p>
<p>And we just get to be born, when I go out,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m working and I&rsquo;m hungry,</p>
<p>I just go click, click, click, and like a salad&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>The salad arrives.</p>
<p>If you think about the incredible infrastructure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in place for that, for that quickly,</p>
<p>or just the internet to, you know, the electricity,</p>
<p>first of all, that&rsquo;s just powering the things, you know,</p>
<p>how the, where the, the amount of structures</p>
<p>that have to be created and for that electricity to be there.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got the, you&rsquo;ve of course the internet,</p>
<p>and then you have this system where delivery drivers</p>
<p>and they have, they&rsquo;re riding bikes</p>
<p>that were made by someone else.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to get the salad</p>
<p>and all those ingredients came from all over the place.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, so I think it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I like thinking about these things</p>
<p>because it makes me feel like just so grateful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, man, it would be so awful if we didn&rsquo;t have this.</p>
<p>And people who didn&rsquo;t have it would think</p>
<p>this was such magic we live in and we do.</p>
<p>And like, cool, that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the most amazing things when I showed up,</p>
<p>I came here at 13 from the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and the supermarket was, people don&rsquo;t really realize that,</p>
<p>but the abundance of food, it&rsquo;s not even,</p>
<p>so bananas was the thing I was obsessed about.</p>
<p>I just ate bananas every day for many, many months</p>
<p>because they haven&rsquo;t had bananas in Russia.</p>
<p>And the fact that you can have as many bananas as you want,</p>
<p>plus they were like somewhat inexpensive</p>
<p>relative to the other food.</p>
<p>The fact that you can somehow have a system</p>
<p>that brings bananas to you without having to wait</p>
<p>in a long line, all of those things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>I mean, also imagine, so first of all,</p>
<p>the ancient hunter gatherers,</p>
<p>you picture the mother gathering and eating</p>
<p>for all this fresh food, no.</p>
<p>So do you know what an avocado used to look like?</p>
<p>It was a little like a sphere and the fruit of it,</p>
<p>the actual avocado part was like a little tiny layer</p>
<p>around this big pit that took up almost the whole volume.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made crazy robot avocados today</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with like what they,</p>
<p>so same with bananas, these big, sweet, you know,</p>
<p>and not infested with bugs and, you know,</p>
<p>they used to eat the shittiest food</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re eating uncooked meat</p>
<p>or maybe they cook it and they&rsquo;re just, it&rsquo;s gross</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s things rot.</p>
<p>So you go to the supermarket and it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>A, it&rsquo;s like crazy super engineered cartoon food,</p>
<p>fruit and food.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s all this processed food,</p>
<p>which, you know, we complain about in our setting.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, we complain about, you know,</p>
<p>we need too much process.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, this is a good problem.</p>
<p>I mean, if you imagine what they would think,</p>
<p>oh my God, a cracker.</p>
<p>You know how delicious a cracker would taste to them?</p>
<p>You know, candy, you know, pasta and spaghetti.</p>
<p>They never had anything like this.</p>
<p>And then you have from all over the world,</p>
<p>I mean, things that are grown all over the place,</p>
<p>all here in nice little racks organized</p>
<p>and on a middle class salary,</p>
<p>you can afford anything you want.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s again, just like incredible gratitude.</p>
<p>Like, ah, yeah.</p>
<p>And the question is how resilient is this whole thing?</p>
<p>I mean, this is another darker version of your question is</p>
<p>if we keep all the material possessions we have,</p>
<p>but we start knocking out some percent of the population,</p>
<p>how resilient is the system that we built up</p>
<p>where we rely on other humans</p>
<p>and the knowledge that built up on the past,</p>
<p>the distributed nature of knowledge,</p>
<p>how much does it take?</p>
<p>How many humans need to disappear</p>
<p>for us to be completely lost?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m trying to go off one thing,</p>
<p>which is Elon Musk says that he has this number,</p>
<p>a million in mind as the order of magnitude of people</p>
<p>you need to be on Mars to truly be multi planetary.</p>
<p>Multi planetary doesn&rsquo;t mean, you know,</p>
<p>like when Neil Armstrong, you know, goes to the moon,</p>
<p>they call it a great leap for mankind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a great leap for anything.</p>
<p>It is a great achievement for mankind.</p>
<p>And I always like think about if the first fish</p>
<p>to kind of go on land just kind of went up</p>
<p>and gave the shore a high five</p>
<p>and goes back into the water,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a great leap for life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great achievement for that fish.</p>
<p>And there should be a little statue of that fish</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, you know, in the water</p>
<p>and everyone should celebrate the fish.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, but when we talk about a great leap for life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s permanent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that now from now on, this is how things are.</p>
<p>So this is part of why I get so excited about Mars,</p>
<p>by the way, is because you can count on one hand,</p>
<p>like the number of great leaps that we&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>you know, like no life to life and single cell</p>
<p>or simple cell to complex cell</p>
<p>and single cell organisms to animals to come,</p>
<p>you know, multi cell animals and then ocean to land</p>
<p>and then one planet to two planets, anyway, diversion.</p>
<p>But the point is that we are officially that leap</p>
<p>for all of life, you know, has happened</p>
<p>once the ships could stop coming from Earth</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some horrible catastrophic World War III</p>
<p>and everyone dies on Earth and they&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>and they can turn that certain X number of people</p>
<p>into 7 billion, you know, population</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s thriving just like Earth.</p>
<p>They can build ships, they can come back</p>
<p>and recolonize Earth</p>
<p>because now we are officially multi planetary</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a self sustaining.</p>
<p>He says a million people is about what he thinks.</p>
<p>Now that might be a specialized group.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very specifically, you know,</p>
<p>selected million that has very, very skilled million people,</p>
<p>not just maybe the average million on Earth,</p>
<p>but I think it depends what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think, you know, so one million is one 7,000th,</p>
<p>one 8,000th of the current population.</p>
<p>I think you need a very, very, very small fraction</p>
<p>of humans on Earth to get by.</p>
<p>Obviously you&rsquo;re not gonna have</p>
<p>the same thriving civilization</p>
<p>if you get to a too small a number,</p>
<p>but it depends who you&rsquo;re killing off, I guess,</p>
<p>is part of the question.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you killed off half of the people</p>
<p>just randomly right now, I think we&rsquo;d be fine.</p>
<p>It would be obviously a great awful tragedy.</p>
<p>I think if you killed off three quarters</p>
<p>of all people randomly,</p>
<p>just three out of every four people drops dead.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;d have, obviously the stock market would crash.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d have a rough patch,</p>
<p>but I almost can assure you that the species would be fine.</p>
<p>Well, cause the million number,</p>
<p>like you said, it is specialized.</p>
<p>So I think, cause you have to do this,</p>
<p>you have to basically do the iPhone experiment.</p>
<p>Like literally you have to be able to manufacture computers.</p>
<p>Yeah, everything.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna have the self sustaining means</p>
<p>you can, any major important skill,</p>
<p>any important piece of kind of infrastructure on earth</p>
<p>can be built there just as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to list out</p>
<p>what are the important things,</p>
<p>what are the important skills?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, if you have to feed everyone,</p>
<p>so mass farming, things like that,</p>
<p>you have to, you have to, you have mining,</p>
<p>these questions, it&rsquo;s like the materials might be,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, five mile, two miles underground,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the actual, but like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing to me just that these things</p>
<p>got built in the first place.</p>
<p>And they never got, no one built the first,</p>
<p>the mine that we&rsquo;re getting stuff for the iPhone for</p>
<p>probably wasn&rsquo;t built for the iPhone.</p>
<p>Or in general, early mining was for,</p>
<p>I think obviously I assume the industrial revolution</p>
<p>when we realized, oh, fossil fuels,</p>
<p>we wanna extract this magical energy source.</p>
<p>I assume that like mining took a huge leap</p>
<p>without knowing very much about this.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna need mining,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need like a lot of electrical engineers.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna have a civilization like ours,</p>
<p>and of course you could have oil and lanterns,</p>
<p>we could go way back,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re trying to build our today thing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need energy and electricity</p>
<p>and then mines that can bring materials,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re gonna need a ton of plumbing</p>
<p>and everything that entails.</p>
<p>And like you said, food, but also the manufacturer,</p>
<p>so like turning raw materials into something useful,</p>
<p>that whole thing, like factories,</p>
<p>some supply chain, transportation.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, you think about,</p>
<p>when we talk about like world hunger,</p>
<p>one of the major problems is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s plenty of food and by the time it arrives,</p>
<p>most of it&rsquo;s gone bad in the truck,</p>
<p>in a kind of an impoverished place.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, again, we take it so for granted,</p>
<p>all the food in the supermarket is fresh, it&rsquo;s all there.</p>
<p>And which always stresses me,</p>
<p>if I were running a supermarket,</p>
<p>I would always be so like miserable</p>
<p>about like things going bad on the shelves,</p>
<p>or if you don&rsquo;t have enough, that&rsquo;s not good,</p>
<p>but if you have too much, it goes bad anyway.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;ll be entertainers too.</p>
<p>Like somebody would have a YouTube channel</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s running on Mars.</p>
<p>There is something different about a civilization on Mars</p>
<p>and Earth existing versus like a civilization</p>
<p>in the United States versus Russia and China.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a different,</p>
<p>fundamentally different distance, like philosophically.</p>
<p>Will it be like fuzzy?</p>
<p>We know there&rsquo;ll be like a reality show on Mars</p>
<p>that everyone on Earth is obsessed with.</p>
<p>And I think if people are going back and forth enough,</p>
<p>then it becomes fuzzy.</p>
<p>It becomes like, oh, our friends on Mars.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like this Mars versus Earth,</p>
<p>and it become like fun tribalism.</p>
<p>I think if people don&rsquo;t rarely go back and forth</p>
<p>and it really, they&rsquo;re there for,</p>
<p>I think if you get kind of like, oh, we hate,</p>
<p>a lot of like us versus them stuff going on.</p>
<p>There could be also war in space for territory.</p>
<p>As a first colony happens, China, Russia,</p>
<p>or whoever the European, different European nations,</p>
<p>Switzerland finally gets their act together</p>
<p>and starts wars as opposed to staying out of all of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s all kinds of crazy geopolitical things</p>
<p>that like we have not even,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s really even thought about too much yet</p>
<p>that like, it could get weird.</p>
<p>Think about the 1500s when it was suddenly like a race</p>
<p>to like colonize or capture land</p>
<p>or discover new land that hasn&rsquo;t been,</p>
<p>so it was like this new frontiers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not really, the land is not,</p>
<p>the thing about Crimea was like this huge thing</p>
<p>because this tiny peninsula switched.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how like optimized everything has become.</p>
<p>Everything is just like really stuck.</p>
<p>Mars is a whole new world of like,</p>
<p>territory, naming things and you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a chance for new kind of governments maybe,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s just the colonies of these governments</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t get that opportunity.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be cool if there&rsquo;s new countries</p>
<p>being totally new experiments.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fascinating because Elon talks exactly</p>
<p>about that and I believe that very much.</p>
<p>Like that should be, like from the start,</p>
<p>they should determine their own sovereignty.</p>
<p>Like they should determine their own thing.</p>
<p>There was one modern democracy in late 1700s, the US.</p>
<p>I mean, it was the only modern democracy.</p>
<p>And now of course, there&rsquo;s hundreds or dozen, many dozens.</p>
<p>But I think part of the reason that was able to start,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not that people didn&rsquo;t have the idea,</p>
<p>people had the idea, it was that they had a clean slate,</p>
<p>new place, and they suddenly were,</p>
<p>so I think it would be a great opportunity to have,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who have done that,</p>
<p>oh, if I had my own government on an island,</p>
<p>my own country, what would I do?</p>
<p>And the US founders actually had the opportunity,</p>
<p>that fantasy, they were like, we can do it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make, okay, what&rsquo;s the perfect country?</p>
<p>And they tried to make something.</p>
<p>Sometimes progress is, it&rsquo;s not held up by our imagination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s held up by just, there&rsquo;s no blank canvas</p>
<p>to try something on.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an opportunity for a fresh start.</p>
<p>The funny thing about the conversation we&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>is not often had, I mean, even by Elon,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so focused on Starship</p>
<p>and actually putting the first human on Mars.</p>
<p>I think thinking about this kind of stuff is inspiring.</p>
<p>It makes us dream, it makes us hope for the future.</p>
<p>And it makes us somehow thinking about civilization on Mars</p>
<p>is helping us think about the civilization here on Earth.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally. And how we should run it.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think are, like in our lifetime,</p>
<p>are we gonna, I think any effort that goes to Mars,</p>
<p>the goal is in this decade.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s actually gonna be achieved?</p>
<p>I have a big bet, $10,000 with a friend</p>
<p>when I was drunk in an argument.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>That the Neil Armstrong of Mars,</p>
<p>whoever he or she may be, will set foot by the end of 2030.</p>
<p>Now, this was probably in 2018 when I had this argument.</p>
<p>So, like what if it?</p>
<p>So, a human has to touch Mars by the end of 2030.</p>
<p>Oh, by the year 30.</p>
<p>Yeah, by January 1st, 2031.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you agree on the time zone or what?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s coming on that exact day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be really stressful.</p>
<p>But anyway, I think that there will be.</p>
<p>That was 2018.</p>
<p>I was more confident then.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be around this time.</p>
<p>I mean, I still won the general bet</p>
<p>because his point was, you are crazy.</p>
<p>This is not gonna happen in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been offered many, many decades.</p>
<p>And I said, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on in SpaceX.</p>
<p>I think if the world depended on it,</p>
<p>I think probably SpaceX could probably.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but I think the tech is almost there.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think, of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s delayed many years by safety.</p>
<p>So, they first wanna send a ship around Mars</p>
<p>and they wanna land a cargo ship on Mars.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the moon on the way to.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>But I think the moon, a decade before,</p>
<p>seemed like magical tech that humans didn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>This is like, no, we can,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally conceivable that this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen Starship,</p>
<p>like it is a interplanetary colonial</p>
<p>or interplanetary transport like system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they used to call it.</p>
<p>The SpaceX, the way they do it is,</p>
<p>every time they do a launch,</p>
<p>something fails usually, when they&rsquo;re testing</p>
<p>and they learn a thousand things.</p>
<p>The amount of data they get and they improve so,</p>
<p>each one has, it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;ve moved up</p>
<p>like eight generations in each one.</p>
<p>Anyway, so it&rsquo;s not inconceivable that pretty soon</p>
<p>they could send a Starship to Mars and land it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no good reason</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that they couldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And so, if they could do that,</p>
<p>they could in theory send a person to Mars pretty soon.</p>
<p>Now, taking off from Mars and coming back,</p>
<p>again, I think, I don&rsquo;t think anyone want</p>
<p>to be on that voyage today because there&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re still in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still amateur hour here and getting that perfect.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re too far away now.</p>
<p>The question is, so every 26 months,</p>
<p>Earth laps Mars, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a sinusoidal, soil orbit</p>
<p>or whatever it&rsquo;s called, the period, 26 months.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s right now, like in the evens,</p>
<p>like 2022 is gonna have one of these, late 2024.</p>
<p>So people could, this was the earliest estimate I heard.</p>
<p>Elon said, maybe we can send people to Mars in 2024,</p>
<p>you know, to land in early 2025.</p>
<p>That is not gonna happen because that included 2022</p>
<p>sending a cargo ship to Mars, maybe even a one in 2020.</p>
<p>And so I think they&rsquo;re not quite on that schedule,</p>
<p>but to win my bet, 2027, I have a chance</p>
<p>and 2029, I have another chance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not very good at like backing up</p>
<p>and seeing the big picture.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very distracted by what&rsquo;s going on today</p>
<p>and what we can believe</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s happening in front of our face.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that humans gonna be landing on Mars</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna be the only thing</p>
<p>everyone is talking about, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be the moon landing,</p>
<p>but even bigger deal, going to another planet, right?</p>
<p>And for it to start a colony,</p>
<p>not just to, again, high five and come back.</p>
<p>So this is like the 2020s, maybe the 2030s</p>
<p>is gonna be the new 1960s.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have a space decade.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited about it.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s one of the great leaps for all of life</p>
<p>happening in our lifetimes, like that&rsquo;s wild.</p>
<p>To paint a slightly cynical possibility,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t see happening,</p>
<p>but I just wanna put sort of value into leadership.</p>
<p>I think it wasn&rsquo;t obvious that the moon landing</p>
<p>would be so exciting for all of human civilization.</p>
<p>Some of that have to do with the right speeches,</p>
<p>with the space race.</p>
<p>Like space, depending on how it&rsquo;s presented,</p>
<p>can be boring.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been that so far, but I&rsquo;ve actually.</p>
<p>I think space is quite boring right now.</p>
<p>No, SpaceX is super, but like 10 years ago, space.</p>
<p>Some writer, I forget who wrote,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the best magic trick in the show</p>
<p>happened at the beginning.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re starting to do this like easy hazard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can&rsquo;t go in that direction.</p>
<p>And the line that this writer said is like,</p>
<p>watching astronauts go up to the space station</p>
<p>after watching the moon is like</p>
<p>watching Columbus sail to Ibiza.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, everything is so practical.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going up to the space station, not to explore,</p>
<p>but to do science experiments in microgravity.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re sending rockets up,</p>
<p>mostly here and there there&rsquo;s a probe,</p>
<p>but mostly you&rsquo;re sending them up to put satellites</p>
<p>for DirecTV or whatever it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like lame earth industry usage.</p>
<p>So I agree with you, space is boring there.</p>
<p>The first human setting foot on Mars,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gotta be a crazy global event.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine it not being.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m taking for granted the speeches</p>
<p>and the space race and that.</p>
<p>I think the value of, I guess what I&rsquo;m pushing</p>
<p>is the value of people like Elon Musk</p>
<p>and potentially other leaders that hopefully step up</p>
<p>is extremely important here.</p>
<p>Like I would argue without the publicity of SpaceX,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the ingenuity of SpaceX,</p>
<p>but like what they&rsquo;ve done publicly</p>
<p>by having a figure that tweets</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff like that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a source of inspiration.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>NASA wasn&rsquo;t able to quite pull off with a shuttle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of his two reasons for doing this.</p>
<p>SpaceX exists for two reasons.</p>
<p>One, life insurance for the species.</p>
<p>I always think about this way.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an alien on some far away planet</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re rooting against humanity</p>
<p>and you win the bet if humanity goes extinct,</p>
<p>you do not like SpaceX.</p>
<p>You do not want them to have their eggs</p>
<p>in two baskets now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s like obviously you could have something</p>
<p>that kills everyone on both planets,</p>
<p>some AI war or something.</p>
<p>But the point is obviously it&rsquo;s good for our chances,</p>
<p>our longterm chances to be having</p>
<p>two self sustaining civilizations going on.</p>
<p>The second reason, he values this I think just as high</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s the greatest adventure in history</p>
<p>going multi planetary and that people need some reason</p>
<p>to wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll just be this hopefully great uniting event too.</p>
<p>I mean, today&rsquo;s nasty, awful political environment,</p>
<p>which is like a whirlpool that sucks everything into it.</p>
<p>So you name a thing and it&rsquo;s become a nasty political topic.</p>
<p>So I hope that space can,</p>
<p>Mars can just bring everyone together,</p>
<p>but it could become this hideous thing</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a billionaire,</p>
<p>some annoying storyline gets built.</p>
<p>So half the people think that anyone who&rsquo;s excited about Mars</p>
<p>is an evil something.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope it is super exciting.</p>
<p>So far space has been a uniting, inspiring thing.</p>
<p>And in fact, especially during this time of a pandemic</p>
<p>has been just a commercial entity</p>
<p>putting out humans into space for the first time</p>
<p>was just one of the only big sources of hope.</p>
<p>Totally in awe, just like watching this huge skyscraper</p>
<p>go up in the air, flip over, go back down and land.</p>
<p>I mean, it just makes everyone just wanna sit back</p>
<p>and clap and kinda like,</p>
<p>the way I look at something like SpaceX</p>
<p>is it makes me proud to be a human.</p>
<p>And I think it makes a lot of people feel that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like good for our self esteem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know what?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty, we have a lot of problems,</p>
<p>but like we&rsquo;re kind of awesome.</p>
<p>And if we can put people on Mars,</p>
<p>sticking up an earth flag on Mars,</p>
<p>like damn, we should be so proud</p>
<p>of our like little family here.</p>
<p>Like we did something cool.</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;ve made it clear to SpaceX people,</p>
<p>including Elon, many times,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like once a year reminder</p>
<p>that if they want to make this more exciting,</p>
<p>they send the writer to Mars on the thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll blog about it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just continuing to throw this out there.</p>
<p>On which trip?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get them to send me to Mars.</p>
<p>No, I understand that.</p>
<p>So I just wanna clarify</p>
<p>on which trip does the writer wanna go?</p>
<p>I think my dream one, to be honest,</p>
<p>would be like the Apollo eight,</p>
<p>where they just looped around the moon and came back.</p>
<p>Cause landing on Mars.</p>
<p>Give you a lot of good content to write about.</p>
<p>Great content, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the amount of kind of high minded,</p>
<p>and so I would go into the thing</p>
<p>and I would blog about it and I&rsquo;d be in microgravity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d be bouncing around my little space.</p>
<p>I get a little, they can just send me in a dragon.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to do a whole starship.</p>
<p>And I would bounce around and I would get to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a dream of going</p>
<p>to like one of those nice jails for a year.</p>
<p>Because I just have nothing to do besides like read books</p>
<p>and no responsibilities and no social plans.</p>
<p>So this is the ultimate version of that.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s a side topic, but I think it would be.</p>
<p>But also if you, I mean, to be honest,</p>
<p>if you land on Mars, it&rsquo;s epic.</p>
<p>And then if you die there of like finishing your writing,</p>
<p>it will be just even that much more powerful</p>
<p>for the impact.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then I&rsquo;m gone.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even get to like experience the publication</p>
<p>of it, which is the whole point of some of the greatest</p>
<p>writers in history didn&rsquo;t get a chance to experience</p>
<p>the publication of their.</p>
<p>I know, I don&rsquo;t really think that I think like,</p>
<p>I think back to Jesus and I&rsquo;m like, oh man,</p>
<p>that guy really like crushed it, you know?</p>
<p>But then if you think about it,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t like you could literally die today</p>
<p>and then become the next Jesus, like 2000 years from now</p>
<p>in this civilization that&rsquo;s like, there are, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like in magical in the clouds</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re worshiping you, they&rsquo;re worshiping Lex.</p>
<p>And like, that sounds like your ego probably would be like,</p>
<p>wow, that&rsquo;s pretty cool, except irrelevant to you</p>
<p>because you never even knew it happened.</p>
<p>This feels like a Rick and Morty episode.</p>
<p>It does, it does.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;ve talked to Elon quite a bit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written about him quite a bit.</p>
<p>Just, it&rsquo;d be cool to hear you talk about</p>
<p>what are your ideas of what, you know,</p>
<p>the magic sauces you&rsquo;ve written about with Elon.</p>
<p>What makes him so successful?</p>
<p>His style of thinking, his ambition, his dreams,</p>
<p>his, the people he connects with,</p>
<p>the kind of problems he tackles.</p>
<p>Is there a kind of comments you can make</p>
<p>about what makes him special?</p>
<p>I think that obviously there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s very good at.</p>
<p>He has, he&rsquo;s obviously super intelligent.</p>
<p>His heart is very much in like, I think the right place.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I really, really believe that like,</p>
<p>and I think people can sense that, you know,</p>
<p>he just doesn&rsquo;t seem like a grifter of any kind.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s truly trying to do these big things</p>
<p>for the right reasons.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s obviously crazy ambitious and hardworking, right?</p>
<p>Not everyone is.</p>
<p>Some people are as talented and have cool visions,</p>
<p>but they just don&rsquo;t wanna spend their life that way.</p>
<p>So, but that&rsquo;s, none of those alone</p>
<p>is what makes Elon, Elon.</p>
<p>I mean, if it were, there&rsquo;d be more of him</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are very smart</p>
<p>and smart enough to accumulate a lot of money and influence</p>
<p>and they have great ambition and they have, you know,</p>
<p>their hearts in the right place.</p>
<p>To me, it is the very unusual quality he has</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s sane in a way</p>
<p>that almost every human is crazy.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is we are programmed</p>
<p>to trust conventional wisdom over our own reasoning</p>
<p>for good reason.</p>
<p>If you go back 50,000 years and conventional wisdom says,</p>
<p>you know, don&rsquo;t eat that berry, you know,</p>
<p>or this is the way you tie a spearhead to a spear.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re thinking, I&rsquo;m smarter than that.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You know, that comes from the accumulation</p>
<p>of life experience, accumulation of observation</p>
<p>and experience over many generations.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a little mini version</p>
<p>of the collective super intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s equivalent</p>
<p>of like making a pencil today.</p>
<p>Like people back then, like the conventional wisdom,</p>
<p>like had this super, this knowledge</p>
<p>that no human could ever accumulate.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re very wired to trust it.</p>
<p>Plus the secondary thing is that the people who, you know,</p>
<p>just say that they believe the mountain is,</p>
<p>they worship the mountain as their God, right?</p>
<p>And the mountain determines their fate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true, right?</p>
<p>And the conventional wisdom is wrong there,</p>
<p>but believing it was helpful to survival</p>
<p>because you were part of the crowd</p>
<p>and you stayed in the tribe.</p>
<p>And if you started to, you know, insult the mountain God</p>
<p>and say, that&rsquo;s just a mountain, it&rsquo;s not, you know,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t fare very well, right?</p>
<p>So for a lot of reasons, it was a great survival trait</p>
<p>to just trust what other people said and believe it.</p>
<p>And truly, you know, obviously, you know,</p>
<p>the more you really believed it, the better.</p>
<p>Today, conventional wisdom in a rapidly changing world</p>
<p>and a huge giant society,</p>
<p>our brains are not built to understand that.</p>
<p>They have a few settings, you know,</p>
<p>and none of them is, you know,</p>
<p>300 million person society.</p>
<p>So your brain is basically,</p>
<p>is treating a lot of things like a small tribe,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re treating conventional wisdom as, you know,</p>
<p>very wise in a way that it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>If you think about it this way, it&rsquo;s like, picture a,</p>
<p>like a bucket that&rsquo;s not moving very much,</p>
<p>moving like a millimeter a year.</p>
<p>And so it has time to collect a lot of water in it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like conventional wisdom in the old days</p>
<p>when very few things changed.</p>
<p>Like your 10, you know, great, great, great grandmother</p>
<p>probably lived a similar life to you,</p>
<p>maybe on the same piece of land.</p>
<p>And so old people really knew what they were talking about.</p>
<p>Today, the bucket&rsquo;s moving really quickly.</p>
<p>And so, you know, the wisdom doesn&rsquo;t accumulate,</p>
<p>but we think it does because our brain settings</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the, oh, move, you know,</p>
<p>quickly moving bucket setting on it.</p>
<p>So my grandmother gives me advice all the time,</p>
<p>and I have to decide, is this,</p>
<p>so there are certain things that are not changing,</p>
<p>like relationships and love and loyalty</p>
<p>and things like this.</p>
<p>Her advice on those things, I&rsquo;ll listen to it all day.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s one of the people who said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to live near your people you love,</p>
<p>live near your family, right?</p>
<p>I think that is like tremendous wisdom, right?</p>
<p>That is wisdom, because that&rsquo;s happens to be something</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t, doesn&rsquo;t change from generation to generation.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>Right, she all, right, for now.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also telling, right, so I&rsquo;ll be the idiot</p>
<p>telling my brain that they&rsquo;ll actually be in the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a metaverse, like being like, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you have to, it&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not in person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna say, it&rsquo;s exactly the same, grandpa.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll also be thinking to me with their near link,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna be like, slow down.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>You just talk like a normal person.</p>
<p>Anyway, so my grandmother then, but then she says,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know about this writing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing, you should go to law school,</p>
<p>and you know, you want to be secure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not good advice for me.</p>
<p>You know, given the world I&rsquo;m in,</p>
<p>and what I like to do, and what I&rsquo;m good at,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the right advice.</p>
<p>But because the world is totally,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s in a different world.</p>
<p>So she became wise for a world that&rsquo;s no longer here, right?</p>
<p>Now, if you think about that,</p>
<p>so then when we think about conventional wisdom,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little like my grandmother,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of, no, it&rsquo;s not maybe, you know,</p>
<p>60 years outdated like her software.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maybe 10 years outdated conventional wisdom,</p>
<p>sometimes 20.</p>
<p>So anyway, I think that we all continually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the confidence in our own reasoning</p>
<p>when it conflicts with what everyone else thinks,</p>
<p>when with what seems right.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the guts to act on that reasoning</p>
<p>for that reason, right?</p>
<p>You know, we, and so there&rsquo;s so many Elon examples.</p>
<p>I mean, just from the beginning,</p>
<p>building Zip2 was his first company.</p>
<p>And it was internet advertising at the time</p>
<p>when people said, you know, this internet was brand new,</p>
<p>like kind of thinking of like the metaverse,</p>
<p>VR metaverse today.</p>
<p>And people would be like, oh, we, you know,</p>
<p>we facilitate internet advertising.</p>
<p>People were saying, yeah, people are gonna advertise</p>
<p>on the internet, yeah, right.</p>
<p>Actually, it wasn&rsquo;t that he&rsquo;s magical and saw the future,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that he looked at the present,</p>
<p>looked at what the internet was,</p>
<p>thought about, you know, the obvious</p>
<p>like advertising opportunity this was gonna be.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t rocket science.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t genius, I don&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>I think it was just seeing the truth.</p>
<p>And when everyone else is laughing,</p>
<p>saying, well, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, I did the math and here it is, right?</p>
<p>Next company, you know, x.com,</p>
<p>which became eventually PayPal.</p>
<p>People said, oh yeah, people are gonna put</p>
<p>their financial information on the internet.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>To us, it seems so obvious.</p>
<p>If you went back then, you would probably feel the same.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think this is, that is a fake company that no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just obviously not a good idea.</p>
<p>He looked around and said, you know, I see where this is.</p>
<p>And so again, he could see where it was going</p>
<p>because he could see what it was that day</p>
<p>and not what it, you know, not people, conventional wisdom</p>
<p>was still a bunch of years earlier.</p>
<p>SpaceX is the ultimate example.</p>
<p>A friend of his apparently bought,</p>
<p>actually compiled a montage, video montage</p>
<p>of rockets blowing up to show him this is not a good idea.</p>
<p>And if, but just even the bigger picture,</p>
<p>the amount of billionaires who have like thought</p>
<p>this was, I&rsquo;m gonna start launching rockets</p>
<p>and you know, the amount that failed.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not, conventional wisdom said</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t a bad endeavor.</p>
<p>He was putting all of his money into it.</p>
<p>Yeah, landing rockets was another thing.</p>
<p>You know, well, if you know,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the classic kind of way we reason,</p>
<p>which is if this could be done,</p>
<p>NASA would have done it a long time ago</p>
<p>because of the money it would save.</p>
<p>This could be done, the Soviet Union</p>
<p>would have done it back in the sixties.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously something that can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>And the math on his envelope said,</p>
<p>well, I think it can be done.</p>
<p>And so he just did it.</p>
<p>So in each of these cases, I think actually in some ways,</p>
<p>Elon gets too much credit as, you know,</p>
<p>people think it&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that his Einstein intelligence</p>
<p>or he can see the future.</p>
<p>He has incredible, he has incredible guts.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so, you know, courageous.</p>
<p>I think if you actually are looking at reality</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just assessing probabilities</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re ignoring all the noise, which is wrong,</p>
<p>so wrong, right?</p>
<p>And you just, then you just have to be, you know,</p>
<p>pretty smart and pretty courageous.</p>
<p>And you have to have this magical ability to be seen</p>
<p>and trust your reasoning over conventional wisdom</p>
<p>because your individual reasoning, you know,</p>
<p>part of it is that we see that we can&rsquo;t build a pencil.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t build, you know,</p>
<p>this civilization on our own, right?</p>
<p>So we kind of count, you know,</p>
<p>count to the collective for good reasons.</p>
<p>But this is different when it comes to kind of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s possible, you know,</p>
<p>the Beatles were doing their kind of Motowny chord patterns</p>
<p>in the early sixties.</p>
<p>And they were doing what was normal.</p>
<p>They were doing what was clearly this kind of sound is a hit.</p>
<p>Then they started getting weird</p>
<p>because they were so popular.</p>
<p>They had this confidence to say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just, we&rsquo;re gonna start just experimenting.</p>
<p>And it turns out that like,</p>
<p>if you just, all these people are in this,</p>
<p>like one groove together doing music,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like, there&rsquo;s a lot of land over there.</p>
<p>And it seems like, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the managers would say,</p>
<p>and that the, all the record execs would say,</p>
<p>no, you have to be here.</p>
<p>This is what sells.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>So I think that Elon is why,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why the term for this</p>
<p>that actually Elon likes to use</p>
<p>is reasoning from first principles, the physics term.</p>
<p>First principles are your axioms.</p>
<p>And physicists, they don&rsquo;t say, well, what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, what do people think?</p>
<p>No, they say, what are the axioms?</p>
<p>Those are the puzzle pieces.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use those to build a conclusion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our hypothesis.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s test it, right?</p>
<p>And they come up with all kinds of new things</p>
<p>constantly by doing that.</p>
<p>If Einstein was assuming conventional wisdom was right,</p>
<p>he never would have even tried to create something</p>
<p>that really disproved Newton&rsquo;s laws.</p>
<p>And the other way to reason is reasoning by analogy,</p>
<p>which is a great shortcut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when we look at other people&rsquo;s reasoning</p>
<p>and we kind of photocopy it into our head, we steal it.</p>
<p>So reasoning by analogy, we do all the time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s usually a good thing.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t, it takes a lot of mental energy and time</p>
<p>to reason from first principles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna reinvent the wheel every time, right?</p>
<p>You want to often copy other people&rsquo;s reasoning</p>
<p>most of the time.</p>
<p>And I, you know, most of us do it most of the time</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s good, but there&rsquo;s certain moments</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re, forget just for a second,</p>
<p>like succeeding in like the world of like Elon,</p>
<p>just who you&rsquo;re gonna marry,</p>
<p>where are you gonna settle down?</p>
<p>How are you gonna raise your kids?</p>
<p>How are you gonna educate your kids?</p>
<p>How you should educate yourself?</p>
<p>What kind of career paths in terms,</p>
<p>these moments, this is what on your death bed,</p>
<p>like you look back on and that&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>these are the few number of choices</p>
<p>that really define your life.</p>
<p>Those should not be reasoned by analogy.</p>
<p>You should absolutely try to reason from first principles.</p>
<p>And Elon, not just by the way in his work,</p>
<p>but in his personal life.</p>
<p>I mean, if you just look at the way he&rsquo;s on Twitter,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not how you&rsquo;re supposed to be</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a super famous, you know, industry titan.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to just be silly on Twitter</p>
<p>and do memes and getting little quibbles with you.</p>
<p>He just does things his own way,</p>
<p>regardless of what you&rsquo;re supposed to do,</p>
<p>which sometimes serves him and sometimes doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but I think it has taken him where it has taken him.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t describe</p>
<p>his approach to Twitter as first principles,</p>
<p>but I guess it has the same element.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I will say that a lot of tweets,</p>
<p>people think, oh, like he&rsquo;s gonna be done after that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fine, he&rsquo;s just one man, time man of the year.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s something, it&rsquo;s not sinking him,</p>
<p>and I think, you know, it&rsquo;s not that I think</p>
<p>this is like super reasoned out.</p>
<p>I think that, you know, Twitter is his silly side,</p>
<p>but I think that he saw,</p>
<p>his reasoning did not feel like there was a giant risk</p>
<p>in just being his silly self on Twitter,</p>
<p>when a lot of billionaires would say,</p>
<p>well, no one else is doing that.</p>
<p>So it must be a good reason, right?</p>
<p>Well, I gotta say that he inspires me to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay to be silly.</p>
<p>Totally. On Twitter.</p>
<p>And, but yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The big inspiration is the willingness to do that</p>
<p>when nobody else is doing it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think about all the great artists,</p>
<p>you know, all the great inventors and entrepreneurs,</p>
<p>almost all of them,</p>
<p>they had a moment when they trusted their reasoning.</p>
<p>I mean, Airbnb was over 60 with VCs.</p>
<p>A lot of people would say,</p>
<p>obviously they know something we don&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t, they said, eh, I think they&rsquo;re all wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, that takes some kind of different wiring</p>
<p>in your brain.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s both for big picture</p>
<p>and detailed like engineering problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to talk to him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to talk to Jim Keller,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a good example of this kind of thinking</p>
<p>about like manufacturing, how to get costs down.</p>
<p>They always talk about like,</p>
<p>they talk about SpaceX rockets this way.</p>
<p>They talk about manufacturing this way,</p>
<p>like cost per pound or per ton to get to orbit</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>This is all the reason we need to get the cost down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very kind of raw materials.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like just very basic way of thinking.</p>
<p>First principles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, yeah.</p>
<p>And the first principles of a rocket</p>
<p>are like the price of raw materials</p>
<p>and gravity, you know, and wind.</p>
<p>I mean, these are your first principles and fuel.</p>
<p>Henry Ford, you know, what made Henry Ford blow up</p>
<p>as an entrepreneur?</p>
<p>The assembly line, right?</p>
<p>I mean, he thought for a second and said,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t how manufacturing is normally done this way,</p>
<p>but I think this is a different kind of product.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what changed it.</p>
<p>And then what happened is when someone reasons</p>
<p>from first principles, they often fail.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re going out into the fog</p>
<p>with no conventional wisdom to guide you.</p>
<p>But when you succeed, what you notice is that</p>
<p>everyone else turns and says, wait, what, what?</p>
<p>What are they doing?</p>
<p>And they all, they flock over.</p>
<p>Look at the iPhone.</p>
<p>iPhone, you know, Steve Jobs was obviously famously good</p>
<p>at reasoning from first principles</p>
<p>because that guy had crazy self confidence.</p>
<p>He just said, you know, if I think this is right,</p>
<p>like everyone, and that, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how he does that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think Apple can do that anymore.</p>
<p>I mean, they lost that.</p>
<p>That one brain, his ability to do that was made</p>
<p>that in a totally different company,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s tens of thousands of people there.</p>
<p>He said, he didn&rsquo;t say, and I&rsquo;m giving a lot of credit</p>
<p>to Steve Jobs, but of course it was a team at Apple</p>
<p>who said they didn&rsquo;t look at the flip phones and say,</p>
<p>okay, well kind of, you know, let&rsquo;s make a keyboard</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like clicky and, you know, really cool Apple.</p>
<p>A keyboard, they said, what should a mobile device be?</p>
<p>You know, what the axioms, what are the axioms here?</p>
<p>And none of them involved a keyboard necessarily.</p>
<p>And by the time they piece it up, there was no keyboards.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Everyone suddenly is going, wait, what, what are they doing?</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>And now every phone looks like the iPhone.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>
<p>You tweeted, what&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve changed your mind about?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question you&rsquo;ve tweeted.</p>
<p>Elon replied, brain transplants,</p>
<p>Sam Harris responded, nuclear power.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of people with cool responses there.</p>
<p>In general, what are your thoughts</p>
<p>about some of the responses</p>
<p>and what have you changed your mind about big or small,</p>
<p>perhaps in doing the research for some of your writing?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m writing right now, just finishing a book</p>
<p>on kind of why our society is such a shit place at the moment</p>
<p>just polarized.</p>
<p>And, you know, we have all these gifts</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re talking about, just the supermarket, you know,</p>
<p>we have these, it&rsquo;s exploding technology.</p>
<p>Fewer and fewer people are in poverty.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, Louis CK, you know, likes to say,</p>
<p>you know, everything&rsquo;s amazing and no one&rsquo;s happy, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really extreme moment right now</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, hate is on the rise,</p>
<p>like crazy things, right?</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>If I could interrupt briefly,</p>
<p>you did tweet that you just wrote the last word.</p>
<p>I sure did.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s some hilarious asshole who said,</p>
<p>now you just have to work on all the ones in the middle.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard that.</p>
<p>I mean, when you, when you earned a reputation</p>
<p>as a tried and true procrastinator,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna get shit forever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I accept my fate there.</p>
<p>So do you mind sharing a little bit more</p>
<p>about the details of what you&rsquo;re writing?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, how do you approach this question</p>
<p>about the state of society?</p>
<p>I wanted to figure out what was going on</p>
<p>because what I noticed was a bad trend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that, you know, things are bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that things are getting worse in certain ways.</p>
<p>Not in every way.</p>
<p>Look at Max Roser&rsquo;s stuff, you know,</p>
<p>he comes up with all these amazing graphs.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s weird is that things are getting better</p>
<p>in almost every important metric you can think of,</p>
<p>except the amount of people who hate other people</p>
<p>in their own country.</p>
<p>And the amount of people that hate their own country,</p>
<p>the amount of Americans that hate America&rsquo;s on the rise,</p>
<p>right, the amount of Americans</p>
<p>that hate other Americans is on the rise.</p>
<p>The amount of Americans that hate the president</p>
<p>is on the rise, all these things,</p>
<p>like on a very steep rise.</p>
<p>So what the hell?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something causing that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that, you know, a bunch of new people were born</p>
<p>who were just dicks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that something is going on.</p>
<p>So I think of it as a very simple,</p>
<p>oversimplified equation, human behavior.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the output.</p>
<p>That I think the two inputs are human nature</p>
<p>and environment, right?</p>
<p>And this is basic, you know,</p>
<p>super kindergarten level like, you know, animal behavior.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s worth thinking about.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got human nature,</p>
<p>which is not changing very much, right?</p>
<p>And then you got, you throw that nature</p>
<p>into a certain environment</p>
<p>and it reacts to the environment, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shaped by the environment.</p>
<p>And then eventually what comes out is behavior, right?</p>
<p>Human nature is not changing very much,</p>
<p>but suddenly we&rsquo;re behaving differently, right?</p>
<p>We are, again, you know, look at the polls.</p>
<p>Like it used to be that the president, you know,</p>
<p>was liked by, I don&rsquo;t remember the exact numbers,</p>
<p>but, you know, 80% or 70% of their own party</p>
<p>and, you know, 50% of the other party.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s like 40% of their own party</p>
<p>and 10% of the other party, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s not that the presidents are getting worse.</p>
<p>Maybe some people would argue that they are,</p>
<p>but more so, and there&rsquo;s a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>idiot presidents throughout the,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on is something in the environment is changing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re seeing is a change in behavior.</p>
<p>A easy example here is that, you know,</p>
<p>by a lot of metrics,</p>
<p>racism is getting, is becoming less and less of a problem.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s hard to measure, but there&rsquo;s metrics like,</p>
<p>you know, how upset would you be</p>
<p>if your kid married someone of another race?</p>
<p>And that number is plummeting,</p>
<p>but racial grievance is skyrocketing, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of examples like this.</p>
<p>So I wanted to look around and say,</p>
<p>and the reason I took it on,</p>
<p>the reason I don&rsquo;t think this is just an unfortunate trend,</p>
<p>unpleasant trend that hopefully we come out of,</p>
<p>is that all this other stuff I like to write about,</p>
<p>all this future stuff, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this magical, I always think of this,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m very optimistic in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>And I think that our world would be a utopia,</p>
<p>would seem like actual heaven.</p>
<p>Like whatever Thomas Jefferson was picturing as heaven,</p>
<p>other than maybe the eternal life aspect,</p>
<p>I think that if he came to 2021 US, it would be better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cooler than heaven.</p>
<p>But we live in a place that&rsquo;s cooler than 1700s heaven.</p>
<p>Again, other than the fact that we still die.</p>
<p>Now, I think the future world</p>
<p>actually probably would have, quote, eternal life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone wants eternal life actually,</p>
<p>if people think they do.</p>
<p>Eternal is a long time.</p>
<p>But I think the choice to die when you want,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;re uploaded, maybe we can refresh our bodies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>But the point is, I think about that utopia.</p>
<p>And I do believe that like, if we don&rsquo;t botch this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be heading towards somewhere</p>
<p>that would seem like heaven, maybe in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>Of course, if things go wrong,</p>
<p>now think about the trends here.</p>
<p>Just like the 20th century would seem like</p>
<p>some magical utopia to someone from the 16th century.</p>
<p>But the bad things in the 20th century</p>
<p>were kind of the worst things ever</p>
<p>in terms of just absolute magnitude.</p>
<p>World War II, the biggest genocides ever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got maybe climate change,</p>
<p>if it is the existential threat that many people think it is.</p>
<p>We never had an existential threat on that level before.</p>
<p>So the good is getting better and the bad is getting worse.</p>
<p>And so what I think about the future,</p>
<p>I think of us as some kind of big, long canoe as a species.</p>
<p>5 million mile long canoe, each of us sitting in a row.</p>
<p>And we each have one oar,</p>
<p>and we can paddle on the left side or the right side.</p>
<p>And what we know is there&rsquo;s a fork up there somewhere.</p>
<p>And the river forks, and there&rsquo;s a utopia on one side</p>
<p>and a dystopia on the other side.</p>
<p>And I really believe that that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re probably not headed for just an okay future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way tech is exploding,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s probably gonna be really good or really bad.</p>
<p>The question is which side should we be rowing on?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t see up there, right?</p>
<p>But it really matters.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m writing about all this future stuff</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m saying none of this matters</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re squabbling our way into kind of like</p>
<p>a civil war right now.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really important problem to solve.</p>
<p>What are your sources of hope in this?</p>
<p>So like how do you steer the canoe?</p>
<p>One of my big sources of hope,</p>
<p>and this is I think my answer to what I changed my mind on,</p>
<p>is I think I always knew this, but it&rsquo;s easy to forget it.</p>
<p>Our primitive brain does not remember this fact,</p>
<p>which is that I don&rsquo;t think there are very many bad people.</p>
<p>Now, you say bad, are there selfish people?</p>
<p>Most of us, I think that if you think of people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s digital languages, ones and zeros.</p>
<p>And our primitive brain very quickly can get into the land</p>
<p>where everyone&rsquo;s a one or a zero.</p>
<p>Our tribe, we&rsquo;re all ones, we&rsquo;re perfect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m perfect, my family is that other family,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that other tribe.</p>
<p>There are zeros and then you dehumanize them, right?</p>
<p>These people are awful.</p>
<p>So zero is not a human place.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s a zero and no one&rsquo;s a one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dehumanizing yourself.</p>
<p>So when we get into this land,</p>
<p>I call it political Disney world,</p>
<p>because the Disney movies have good guys.</p>
<p>Scar is totally bad and Mufasa is totally good, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see Mufasa&rsquo;s character flaws.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see Scar&rsquo;s upbringing that made him like that,</p>
<p>that humanizes him.</p>
<p>No, lionizes him, whatever.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>Well done.</p>
<p>Mufasa&rsquo;s a one and Scar&rsquo;s a zero, very simple.</p>
<p>So political Disney world is a place,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a psychological place that all of us have been in.</p>
<p>And it can be religious Disney world,</p>
<p>it can be national Disney world and the war, whatever it is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a place where we fall into this delusion</p>
<p>that there are protagonists and antagonists</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it, right?</p>
<p>That is not true.</p>
<p>We are all 0.5s or maybe 0.6s to 0.4s in that.</p>
<p>We are also, on one hand,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s that many really great people,</p>
<p>frankly, I think if you get into it,</p>
<p>people are kind of, a lot of people,</p>
<p>most of us have, if you get really</p>
<p>into our most shameful memories,</p>
<p>the things we&rsquo;ve done that are worse,</p>
<p>the most shameful thoughts,</p>
<p>the deep selfishness that some of us have</p>
<p>in areas we wouldn&rsquo;t want to admit, right?</p>
<p>Most of us have a lot of unadmirable stuff, right?</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you actually got into,</p>
<p>really got into someone else&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>and you looked at their upbringing,</p>
<p>you looked at the trauma that they&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>and then you looked at the insecurities they have</p>
<p>and you look at all their,</p>
<p>if you assemble the highlight reel of your worst moments,</p>
<p>the meanest things you&rsquo;ve ever done,</p>
<p>the worst, the most selfish,</p>
<p>the times you stole something, whatever,</p>
<p>and you just, people are like,</p>
<p>wow, Lex is an awful person.</p>
<p>If you highlighted your,</p>
<p>if you did a montage of your best moments,</p>
<p>people would say, oh, he&rsquo;s a god, right?</p>
<p>But of course, we all have both of those.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve started to really try to remind myself</p>
<p>that everyone&rsquo;s a 0.5, right?</p>
<p>And 0.5s are all worthy of criticism</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all worthy of compassion.</p>
<p>And the thing that makes me hopeful</p>
<p>is that I really think that there&rsquo;s a bunch of 0.5s</p>
<p>and 0.5s are good enough</p>
<p>that we should be able to create a good society together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of love in every human.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s more love in humans than hate.</p>
<p>I always remember this moment,</p>
<p>this is a weird anecdote,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a Red Sox fan, Boston Red Sox baseball,</p>
<p>and Derek Jeter is who we hate the most.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on the Yankees.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And hate, right?</p>
<p>Jeter, right?</p>
<p>He was his last game in Fenway, he&rsquo;s retiring.</p>
<p>And he got this rousing standing ovation</p>
<p>and I almost cried.</p>
<p>And it was like, what is going on?</p>
<p>We hate this guy,</p>
<p>but actually there&rsquo;s so much love in all humans.</p>
<p>It felt so good to just give a huge cheer</p>
<p>to this guy we hate because it&rsquo;s like this moment</p>
<p>of like a little fist pound being like,</p>
<p>of course we all actually love each other.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s so much of that.</p>
<p>And so the thing that I think I&rsquo;ve come around on</p>
<p>is I think that we are in an environment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bringing out really bad stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s, if I thought it was the people,</p>
<p>I would be more hopeful.</p>
<p>Like if I thought it was human nature,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be more upset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the two independent variables here,</p>
<p>or that there&rsquo;s a fixed variable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a constant, which is human nature.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the independent variable environment</p>
<p>and that it behaviors the dependent variable.</p>
<p>I like that the thing that I think is bad</p>
<p>is the independent variable, the environment,</p>
<p>which means I think we can,</p>
<p>the environment can get better.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of things I can go into</p>
<p>about why the environment I think is bad,</p>
<p>but I have hope because I think the thing that&rsquo;s bad for us</p>
<p>is something that can change.</p>
<p>The first principles idea here is that most people</p>
<p>have the capacity to be a 0.7 to 0.9.</p>
<p>If the environment is properly calibrated</p>
<p>with the right incentives.</p>
<p>I think that, well, I think that maybe if we&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>yeah, if we&rsquo;re all 0.5s,</p>
<p>I think that environments can bring out our good side.</p>
<p>Yeah, so maybe we&rsquo;re all on some kind of distribution</p>
<p>and the right environment can, yes,</p>
<p>can bring out our higher sides.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of, in a lot of ways you could say it has.</p>
<p>I mean, the U.S. environment,</p>
<p>we take for granted how the liberal laws</p>
<p>and liberal environment that we live in.</p>
<p>I mean, like in New York City, right?</p>
<p>If you walk down the street and you like assault someone,</p>
<p>hey, if anyone sees you, they&rsquo;re probably gonna yell at you.</p>
<p>You might get your ass kicked by someone for doing that.</p>
<p>You also might end up in jail, you know,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s security cameras and there&rsquo;s just norms,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re all trained.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what awful people do, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not the human nature</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have it in it to be like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that this environment we&rsquo;re in has made that a much,</p>
<p>much, much smaller experience for people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many examples like that where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>man, you don&rsquo;t realize how much of the worst human nature</p>
<p>is contained by our environment.</p>
<p>And, but I think that, you know,</p>
<p>rapidly changing environment,</p>
<p>which is what we have right now, social media starts.</p>
<p>I mean, what a seismic change to the environment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of examples like that,</p>
<p>rapidly changing environment</p>
<p>can create rapidly changing behavior</p>
<p>and wisdom sometimes can&rsquo;t keep up.</p>
<p>And so we, you know, we can really kind of lose our grip</p>
<p>on some of the good behavior.</p>
<p>Were you surprised by Elon&rsquo;s answer about brain transplants</p>
<p>or Sam&rsquo;s about nuclear power or anything else?</p>
<p>Just&hellip;</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s I think is, I have a friend,</p>
<p>Isabel Boumeke who has a,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a nuclear power, you know, influencer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become very convinced</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve not done my deep dive on this.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s, in this case, this is,</p>
<p>this is reasoning by analogy here.</p>
<p>The amount of really smart people I respect</p>
<p>who all, who seem to have dug in,</p>
<p>who all say nuclear power is clearly a good option.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously emission free, but you know,</p>
<p>the concerns about meltdowns and waste,</p>
<p>they see that they&rsquo;re completely overblown.</p>
<p>So judging from those people, secondary knowledge here,</p>
<p>I will say I&rsquo;m a strong advocate.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done my own deep dive yet,</p>
<p>but it does seem like a little bit odd</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got people</p>
<p>who are so concerned about climate change,</p>
<p>who have, it seems like it&rsquo;s kind of an ideology</p>
<p>where nuclear power doesn&rsquo;t fit</p>
<p>rather than rational, you know, fear of climate change</p>
<p>that somehow is anti nuclear power.</p>
<p>It just, yeah.</p>
<p>I personally am uncomfortably reasoning by analogy</p>
<p>with climate change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually have not done a deep dive myself.</p>
<p>Me neither, because it&rsquo;s so,</p>
<p>man, it seems like a deep dive.</p>
<p>And my reasoning by analogy there</p>
<p>currently has me thinking it&rsquo;s a truly existential thing,</p>
<p>but feeling hopeful.</p>
<p>So let me, this is me speaking</p>
<p>and this is speaking from a person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not done the deep dive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little suspicious</p>
<p>of the amount of fear mongering going on.</p>
<p>Especially over the past couple of years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten uncomfortable with fear mongering</p>
<p>in all walks of life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s way too many people interested</p>
<p>in manipulating the populace with fear.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>I should probably do a deep dive</p>
<p>because to me it&rsquo;s, well, the big problem</p>
<p>with the opposition to climate change</p>
<p>or whatever the fear mongering is</p>
<p>that it also grows the skepticism in science broadly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, and that,</p>
<p>so I need to make sure I do that deep dive.</p>
<p>I have listened to a few folks</p>
<p>who kind of criticize the fear mongering</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re few and far between.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, all right, what is the truth here?</p>
<p>And it feels lazy, but it also feels like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to get to the,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of activists talking about idea,</p>
<p>versus like sources of objective,</p>
<p>like calm first principles type reasoning.</p>
<p>Like one of the things,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s supposed to be a very big problem,</p>
<p>but when people talk about catastrophic effects</p>
<p>of climate change,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to like see really great deep analysis</p>
<p>of what that looks like in 10, 20, 30 years,</p>
<p>raising rising sea levels.</p>
<p>What are the models of how that changes human behavior,</p>
<p>society, what are the things that happen?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be constraints on the resources</p>
<p>and people are gonna have to move around.</p>
<p>This is happening gradually.</p>
<p>Are we gonna be able to respond to this?</p>
<p>How would we respond to this?</p>
<p>What are the best,</p>
<p>like, what are the best models</p>
<p>for how everything goes wrong?</p>
<p>Again, I was, this is a question I keep starting</p>
<p>to ask myself without doing any research,</p>
<p>like motivating myself to get up to this deep dive</p>
<p>that I feel is deep,</p>
<p>just watching people not do a great job</p>
<p>with that kind of modeling with the pandemic</p>
<p>and sort of being caught off guard and wondering,</p>
<p>okay, if we&rsquo;re not good with this pandemic,</p>
<p>how are we going to respond to other kinds of tragedies?</p>
<p>Well, this is part of why I wrote the book.</p>
<p>Cause I said, we&rsquo;re going to have more and more of these,</p>
<p>like big collective, what should we do here situations?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s, how about when, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re probably not that far away</p>
<p>from people being able to go and decide the IQ of their kid</p>
<p>or like, you know, make a bunch of embryos</p>
<p>and actually pick the highest IQ.</p>
<p>Can possibly go wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also like, imagine the political sides of that</p>
<p>and like something that only wealthy people can afford at</p>
<p>first and just the nightmare, right?</p>
<p>We need to be able to have our wits about us as a species</p>
<p>where we can actually get into a topic like that</p>
<p>and come up with where the collective brain can be smart.</p>
<p>I think that there are certain topics</p>
<p>where I think of this and this is again,</p>
<p>another simplistic model, but I think it works</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a higher mind and a primitive mind, right?</p>
<p>You can, you know, in your head</p>
<p>and these team up with others.</p>
<p>So when the higher minds are in a higher mind</p>
<p>is more rational and puts out ideas</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not attached to.</p>
<p>And so it can change its mind easily</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s just an idea and the higher mind</p>
<p>can get criticized.</p>
<p>Their ideas can get criticized and it&rsquo;s no big deal.</p>
<p>And so when the higher minds team up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like all these people in the room,</p>
<p>like throwing out ideas and kicking them</p>
<p>and one idea goes out and everyone criticizes it,</p>
<p>which is like, you know, shooting bows and arrows at it.</p>
<p>And the truth, the true idea is, you know,</p>
<p>the bow, the arrows bounce off and it&rsquo;s so, okay,</p>
<p>it rises up and the other ones get shot down.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this incredible system.</p>
<p>This is what, you know,</p>
<p>this is what good science institution is,</p>
<p>is, you know, someone puts out a thing,</p>
<p>criticism arrows come at it and, you know,</p>
<p>most of them fall and the needle is in the haystack</p>
<p>end up rising up, right?</p>
<p>Incredible mechanism.</p>
<p>So what that&rsquo;s happening is a bunch of people,</p>
<p>a bunch of flawed medium scientists</p>
<p>are creating super intelligence.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the primitive mind,</p>
<p>which, you know, is the more limbic system part of our brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the part of us that is very much not living in 2021.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s living many tens of thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>And it does not treat ideas like this separate thing.</p>
<p>It identifies with its ideas.</p>
<p>It only gets involved when it finds an idea sacred.</p>
<p>It starts holding an idea sacred and it starts identifying.</p>
<p>So what happens is they team up too.</p>
<p>And so when you have a topic that a bunch of primitive,</p>
<p>that really rouses a bunch of primitive minds,</p>
<p>it quickly, the primitive minds team up</p>
<p>and they create an echo chamber</p>
<p>where suddenly no one can criticize this.</p>
<p>And in fact, if it&rsquo;s powerful enough,</p>
<p>people outside the community, you can,</p>
<p>no one can criticize it.</p>
<p>We will get your paper retracted.</p>
<p>We will get you fired, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not higher mind behavior.</p>
<p>That is crazy primitive mind.</p>
<p>And so now what happens is the collective</p>
<p>becomes dumber than an individual,</p>
<p>a dumber than a reason, a single reasoning individual.</p>
<p>You have this collective is suddenly attached</p>
<p>to this sacred scripture with the idea</p>
<p>and they will not change their mind</p>
<p>and they get dumber and dumber.</p>
<p>And so climate change, what&rsquo;s worrisome</p>
<p>is that climate change has in many ways</p>
<p>become a sacred topic,</p>
<p>where if you come up with a nuanced thing,</p>
<p>you might get called branded a denier.</p>
<p>So there goes the super intelligence,</p>
<p>all the arrows, no arrows can be fired.</p>
<p>But if you get called a denier,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a social penalty for firing an arrow</p>
<p>at a certain orthodoxy, right?</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s happening is the big brain</p>
<p>gets like frozen, right?</p>
<p>And it becomes very stupid.</p>
<p>Now, you can also say that</p>
<p>about a lot of other topics right now.</p>
<p>You just mentioned another one, I forget what it was,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s also kind of like this.</p>
<p>The world of vaccine.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, COVID, okay.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s my point earlier is that</p>
<p>what I see is that the political divide</p>
<p>has like a whirlpool that&rsquo;s pulling everything into it.</p>
<p>And in that whirlpool, thinking is done</p>
<p>with the primitive mind tribes.</p>
<p>And so I get, okay, obviously something like race,</p>
<p>that makes sense, that also right now,</p>
<p>the topic of race, for example, or gender,</p>
<p>these things are in the whirlpool.</p>
<p>But that at least is like, okay,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that the primitive mind</p>
<p>would always get really worked up about.</p>
<p>It taps into like our deepest kind of like primal selves.</p>
<p>COVID, maybe it&rsquo;s COVID in a way too,</p>
<p>but climate change, that should just be something</p>
<p>that our rational brains are like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s solve this complex problem.</p>
<p>But the problem is that it&rsquo;s all gotten sucked</p>
<p>into the red versus blue whirlpool.</p>
<p>And once that happens,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the hands of the primitive minds.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re losing our ability to be wise together,</p>
<p>to make decisions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the big species brain is like,</p>
<p>or the big American brain is like,</p>
<p>drunk at the wheel right now.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re about to go into our future</p>
<p>with more and more big technologies,</p>
<p>scary things, we have to make big right decisions.</p>
<p>And not, we&rsquo;re getting dumber as a collective.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of this environmental problem.</p>
<p>So within the space of technologists</p>
<p>and the space of scientists, we should allow the arrows.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the saddest things to me about,</p>
<p>is like the scientists, like I&rsquo;ve seen arrogance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of mechanisms that maintain the tribe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the arrogance, it&rsquo;s how you built up this mechanism</p>
<p>that defends, this wall that defends against the arrows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s arrogance, credentialism,</p>
<p>like just ego, really.</p>
<p>And then just, it protects you</p>
<p>from actually challenging your own ideas.</p>
<p>This ideal of science that makes science beautiful.</p>
<p>In a time of fear, and in a time of division</p>
<p>created by perhaps politicians that leverage the fear,</p>
<p>it, like you said, makes the whole system dumber.</p>
<p>The science system dumber,</p>
<p>the tech developer system dumber,</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t allow the challenging of ideas.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really bad is that like,</p>
<p>in a normal environment,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always gonna have echo chambers.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the opposite of an echo chamber?</p>
<p>I created a term for it, because I think we need it,</p>
<p>which is called an idea lab, an idea lab, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people treat, it&rsquo;s like people act like scientists,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not doing science,</p>
<p>they just treat their ideas like science experiments</p>
<p>and they toss them out there and everyone disagrees.</p>
<p>And disagreement is like the game.</p>
<p>Everyone likes to disagree.</p>
<p>Certain texts thread where everyone is just saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like someone throws something out</p>
<p>and just it&rsquo;s an impulse for the rest of the group to say,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re being like overly general there.</p>
<p>Or I think like, aren&rsquo;t you kind of being,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s like your bias showing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no one&rsquo;s getting offended</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re all just messing,</p>
<p>we all of course respect each other, obviously.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, you know, trashing each other&rsquo;s ideas</p>
<p>and that the whole group becomes smarter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always gonna have idea labs and echo chambers,</p>
<p>right, in different communities.</p>
<p>And most of us participate in both of them.</p>
<p>You know, maybe in your marriage is a great idea lab,</p>
<p>you love to disagree with your spouse and maybe in,</p>
<p>but this group of friends or your family at home,</p>
<p>you know, in front of that sister,</p>
<p>you do not bring up politics</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s now enforced when that happens,</p>
<p>her bullying is forcing the whole room</p>
<p>to be an echo chamber to appease her.</p>
<p>Now, what scares me is that usually have these things</p>
<p>existing kind of in bubbles.</p>
<p>And usually there&rsquo;s like an age</p>
<p>have their natural defenses against each other.</p>
<p>So an echo chamber person stays in their echo chamber.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like, they will cut you out.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like to be friends with people</p>
<p>who disagree with them.</p>
<p>You notice that they will cut you out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll cut out their parents</p>
<p>if they voted for Trump or whatever, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how they do it.</p>
<p>They will say, I&rsquo;m going to stay inside</p>
<p>of an echo chamber safely.</p>
<p>So my ideas, which I identify with</p>
<p>because my primitive mind is doing the thinking</p>
<p>are not going to ever have to get challenged</p>
<p>because it feels so scary and awful for that to happen.</p>
<p>But if they leave and they go into an idea lab environment,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to, people are going to say, what?</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re going to disagree.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to say,</p>
<p>and the person&rsquo;s going to try to bully them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to say, that&rsquo;s really offensive.</p>
<p>And people are going to say, no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to immediately say</p>
<p>these people are assholes, right?</p>
<p>So the echo chamber person,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have much power once they leave the echo chamber.</p>
<p>Likewise, the idea lab person,</p>
<p>they have this great environment,</p>
<p>but if they go into an echo chamber</p>
<p>where everyone else is, and they do that,</p>
<p>they will get kicked out of the group.</p>
<p>They will get branded as something,</p>
<p>a denier, a racist, a right winger, a radical,</p>
<p>these nasty words.</p>
<p>The thing that I don&rsquo;t like right now</p>
<p>is that the echo chambers have found ways</p>
<p>to forcefully expand into places</p>
<p>that normally have a pretty good immune system</p>
<p>against echo chambers, like universities,</p>
<p>like science journals,</p>
<p>places where usually it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a strong idea lab culture there, veritas.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s an idea lab slogan.</p>
<p>You have is that these people have found a way to,</p>
<p>a lot of people have found a way</p>
<p>to actually go out of their thing</p>
<p>and keep their echo chamber</p>
<p>by making sure that everyone is scared</p>
<p>because they can punish anyone,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re in their community or not.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all brilliantly put.</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the book coming out?</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>
<p>June, July, we&rsquo;re not quite sure yet.</p>
<p>Okay, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Thanks. It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Do you have a title yet or you can&rsquo;t talk about that?</p>
<p>Still working on it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s okay, just a couple of questions from Mailbag.</p>
<p>I just love these.</p>
<p>I would love to hear you riff on these.</p>
<p>So one is about film and music.</p>
<p>Why do we prefer to watch, the question goes,</p>
<p>why do we prefer to watch a film</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t watched before,</p>
<p>but we want to listen to songs</p>
<p>that we have heard hundreds of times?</p>
<p>This question and your answer</p>
<p>really started to make me think like,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Like we draw that line somehow.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the answer?</p>
<p>So I think, let&rsquo;s use these two minds again.</p>
<p>I think that when your higher mind</p>
<p>is the one who&rsquo;s taking something in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really interested in,</p>
<p>what are the lyrics or I&rsquo;m gonna learn something</p>
<p>or reading a book or whatever.</p>
<p>And the higher mind is trying to get information.</p>
<p>And once it has it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no point in listening to it again.</p>
<p>It has the information.</p>
<p>Your rational brain is like, I got it.</p>
<p>But when you eat a good meal or have sex or whatever,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something you can do again and again,</p>
<p>because it actually, your primitive brain loves it.</p>
<p>And it never gets bored of things that it loves.</p>
<p>So I think music is a very primal thing.</p>
<p>I think music goes right into our primitive brain.</p>
<p>A lot, I think it&rsquo;s of course, it&rsquo;s a collaboration.</p>
<p>Your rational brain is absorbing the actual message.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s all about emotions</p>
<p>and even more than emotions,</p>
<p>it literally like the music taps into like some very,</p>
<p>very deep, primal part of us.</p>
<p>And so when you hear a song once,</p>
<p>even some of your favorite songs,</p>
<p>the first time you heard it,</p>
<p>you were like, I guess that&rsquo;s kind of catchy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you end up loving it on the 10th listen.</p>
<p>But sometimes you even don&rsquo;t even like a song.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, this song sucks.</p>
<p>But suddenly you find yourself on the 40th time</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s on the radio all the time,</p>
<p>just kind of being like, oh, I love this song.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, wait, I hated the song.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s happening is that the sound is actually,</p>
<p>the music&rsquo;s actually carving a pathway in your brain</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a dance.</p>
<p>And when your brain knows what&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>it can dance, it knows the steps.</p>
<p>So your brain is your internal kind of,</p>
<p>your brain is actually dancing with the music</p>
<p>and it knows the steps and it can anticipate.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s something about knowing,</p>
<p>having memorized the song</p>
<p>that makes it incredibly enjoyable to us.</p>
<p>But when we hear it for the first time,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s gonna go.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like an awkward dancer.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the steps and your primitive brain</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really have that much fun yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I feel.</p>
<p>And in the movies, that&rsquo;s less primitive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the story you&rsquo;re taking in.</p>
<p>But a really good movie that we really love,</p>
<p>often we will watch it like 12 times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still like it, not that many,</p>
<p>but versus if you&rsquo;re watching a talk show, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening to one of your podcasts,</p>
<p>as a perfect example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not many people that will listen</p>
<p>to one of your podcasts,</p>
<p>no matter how good it is, 12 times.</p>
<p>Because once you&rsquo;ve got it, you&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of information that&rsquo;s very higher mind focused.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I read it.</p>
<p>Well, the funny thing is there is people</p>
<p>that listen to a podcast episode many, many times.</p>
<p>And often I think the reason for that</p>
<p>is not because of the information, is the chemistry,</p>
<p>is the music of the conversation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the actual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the art of it they like.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;ll fall in love with some kind of person,</p>
<p>some weird personality, and they&rsquo;ll just be listening to,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be captivated by the beat of that kind of person.</p>
<p>Or like a standup comic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched like certain things,</p>
<p>like episodes like 20 times, even though I, you know.</p>
<p>I have to ask you about the wizard hat.</p>
<p>You had a blog about Neuralink.</p>
<p>I got a chance to visit Neuralink a couple of times,</p>
<p>hanging out with those folks, that was one of the pieces</p>
<p>of writing you did that like changes culture</p>
<p>and changes the way people think about a thing.</p>
<p>The ridiculousness of your stick figure drawings</p>
<p>are somehow, it&rsquo;s like calling the origin</p>
<p>of the universe the Big Bang.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a silly title, but it somehow sticks</p>
<p>to be the representative of that.</p>
<p>And the same way the wizard hat for the Neuralink</p>
<p>is somehow it was a really powerful way to explain that.</p>
<p>You actually proposed that the man of the year</p>
<p>cover of Time should be.</p>
<p>One of my drawings.</p>
<p>One of your drawings.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an outrage that it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Okay, so what are your thoughts about like all those years</p>
<p>later about Neuralink?</p>
<p>Do you find this idea, like what excites you about it?</p>
<p>Is it the big long term philosophical things?</p>
<p>Is it the practical things?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s super difficult to do</p>
<p>on the neurosurgery side</p>
<p>and the material engineering, the robotics side?</p>
<p>Or do you think the machine learning side</p>
<p>for the brain computer interfaces</p>
<p>where they get to learn about each other,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I would just love to get your thoughts</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re one of the people</p>
<p>that really considered this problem,</p>
<p>really studied it, brain computer interfaces.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m super excited about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, I really think it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s most ambitious thing.</p>
<p>More than colonizing Mars</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just a bunch of people going somewhere,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s somewhere far.</p>
<p>Neuralink is changing what a person is eventually.</p>
<p>Now, I think that Neuralink engineers and Elon himself</p>
<p>would all be the first to admit that it is a maybe</p>
<p>that whether they can do their goals here.</p>
<p>I mean, it is so crazy ambitious to try to,</p>
<p>even their eventual goals are,</p>
<p>of course in the interim,</p>
<p>they have a higher probability</p>
<p>of accomplishing smaller things,</p>
<p>which are still huge, like basically solving paralysis,</p>
<p>strokes, Parkinson, things like that.</p>
<p>I mean, it can be unbelievable.</p>
<p>And anyone who doesn&rsquo;t have one of these things,</p>
<p>like we might, everyone should be very happy</p>
<p>about this kind of helping with different disabilities.</p>
<p>But the thing that is like,</p>
<p>so the grand goal is this augmentation</p>
<p>where you take someone who&rsquo;s totally healthy</p>
<p>and you put a brain machine interface in any way</p>
<p>to give them superpowers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the possibilities if they can do this,</p>
<p>if they can really,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ve already shown that they are for real,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve created this robot.</p>
<p>Elon talks about like, it should be like LASIK,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t be something that needs a surgeon.</p>
<p>This shouldn&rsquo;t just be for rich people</p>
<p>who have waited in line for six months.</p>
<p>It should be for anyone who can afford LASIK</p>
<p>and eventually, hopefully something that isn&rsquo;t covered by</p>
<p>insurance or something that anyone can do.</p>
<p>Something this big a deal should be something</p>
<p>that anyone can afford eventually.</p>
<p>And when we have this, again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about a very advanced phase down the road.</p>
<p>So maybe a less advanced phase,</p>
<p>just maybe right now,</p>
<p>if you think about when you listen to a song,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening, is you actually hear the sound?</p>
<p>Well, not really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that the sound is coming out of the speaker.</p>
<p>The speaker is vibrating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vibrating air molecules.</p>
<p>Those air molecules, you know,</p>
<p>get vibrated all the way to your head pressure wave.</p>
<p>And then it vibrates your eardrum.</p>
<p>Your eardrum is really the speaker now in your head</p>
<p>that then vibrates bones and fluid,</p>
<p>which then stimulates neurons in your auditory cortex,</p>
<p>which give you the perception that you&rsquo;re hearing sound.</p>
<p>Now, if you think about that,</p>
<p>do we really need to have a speaker to do that?</p>
<p>You could just somehow,</p>
<p>if you had a little tiny thing</p>
<p>that could vibrate eardrums,</p>
<p>you could do it that way.</p>
<p>That seems very hard.</p>
<p>But really what you need,</p>
<p>if you go to the very end</p>
<p>with a thing that really needs to happen,</p>
<p>is your auditory cortex neurons</p>
<p>need to be stimulated in a certain way.</p>
<p>If you have a ton of Neuralink things in there,</p>
<p>Neuralink electrodes,</p>
<p>and they get really good at stimulating things,</p>
<p>you could play a song in your head</p>
<p>that you hear that is not playing anywhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no sound in the room,</p>
<p>but you hear and no one else could.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they can get close to your head and hear it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no sound.</p>
<p>They could not hear anything,</p>
<p>but you hear sound.</p>
<p>You can turn up.</p>
<p>So you open your phone,</p>
<p>you have the Neuralink app.</p>
<p>You open the Neuralink app,</p>
<p>and or just Neuralink.</p>
<p>So basically you can open your Spotify</p>
<p>and you can play to your speaker,</p>
<p>you can play to your computer,</p>
<p>you can play right out of your phone to your headphones,</p>
<p>or you can have a new one.</p>
<p>You can play into your brain.</p>
<p>And this is one of the earlier things.</p>
<p>This is something that seems like really doable.</p>
<p>So no more headphones.</p>
<p>I always think it&rsquo;s so annoying</p>
<p>because I can leave the house with just my phone</p>
<p>and nothing else,</p>
<p>or even just an Apple watch.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always this one thing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, and headphones.</p>
<p>You do need your headphones, right?</p>
<p>So I feel like that&rsquo;ll be the end of that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so many things that you,</p>
<p>and you keep going,</p>
<p>the ability to think together.</p>
<p>You can talk about like super brains.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the examples Elon uses</p>
<p>is that the low bandwidth of speech.</p>
<p>If I go to a movie and I come out of a scary movie</p>
<p>and you say, how was it?</p>
<p>I said, oh, it was terrifying.</p>
<p>Well, what did I just do?</p>
<p>I just gave you,</p>
<p>I had five buckets I could have given you.</p>
<p>One was horrifying, terrifying, scary, eerie, creepy,</p>
<p>whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>And I had a much more nuanced experience than that.</p>
<p>And all I have is these words, right?</p>
<p>And so instead I just hand you the bucket.</p>
<p>I put the stuff in the bucket and give it to you,</p>
<p>but all you have is the bucket.</p>
<p>You just have to guess what I put into that bucket.</p>
<p>All you can do is look at the label of the bucket and say,</p>
<p>when I say terrifying, here&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>So the point is it&rsquo;s very lossy.</p>
<p>I had all this nuanced information</p>
<p>of what I thought of the movie.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sending you a very low res package</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna now guess</p>
<p>what the high res thing looked like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s language in general.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are much more nuanced.</p>
<p>We can think to each other.</p>
<p>We can do amazing things.</p>
<p>We could A, have a brainstorm that doesn&rsquo;t feel like,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re not talking in each other&rsquo;s heads.</p>
<p>Not just that I hear your voice.</p>
<p>No, no, no, we are just thinking.</p>
<p>No words are being said internally or externally.</p>
<p>The two brains are literally collaborating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something, it&rsquo;s a skill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d have to get good at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure young kids will be great at it</p>
<p>and old people will be bad.</p>
<p>But you think together and together you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, had the joint epiphany.</p>
<p>And now how about eight people in a room doing it, right?</p>
<p>So it gets, you know, there&rsquo;s other examples.</p>
<p>How about when you&rsquo;re a dress designer or a bridge designer</p>
<p>and you want to show people what your dress looks like.</p>
<p>Well, right now you gotta sketch it for a long time.</p>
<p>Here, just beam it onto the screen from your head.</p>
<p>So you can picture it.</p>
<p>If, you know, if you can picture a tree in your head,</p>
<p>well, you can just suddenly,</p>
<p>whatever&rsquo;s in your head, you can be pictured.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have to get very good at it, right?</p>
<p>And take a skill, right?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re gonna have to,</p>
<p>but the possibilities, my God.</p>
<p>Talk about like, I feel like if that works,</p>
<p>if we really do have that as something,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll almost be like a new ADBC line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a big change that the idea of like anyone living</p>
<p>before everyone had brain machine interfaces</p>
<p>is living in like before the common era.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that level of like big change if it can work.</p>
<p>Yeah, and like a replay of memories,</p>
<p>just replaying stuff in your head.</p>
<p>Oh my God, yeah.</p>
<p>And copying, you know, you can hopefully copy memories</p>
<p>onto other things and you don&rsquo;t have to just rely on your,</p>
<p>you know, your wet circuitry.</p>
<p>It does make me sad because you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The brain is incredibly neuroplastic</p>
<p>and so it can adjust, it can learn how to do this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be a skill.</p>
<p>Or probably you and I will be too old to truly learn.</p>
<p>Well, maybe we can get, there&rsquo;ll be great trainings.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m spending the next three months</p>
<p>in like a, you know, one of the Neuralink trainings.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;ll still be a bit of like grandpa, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>This is, you know, I was thinking,</p>
<p>how am I gonna be old?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, I&rsquo;m gonna be great at the new phones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how can it be the phones?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be that, you know,</p>
<p>the kid&rsquo;s gonna be thinking to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be like, I just, can you just talk please?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna be like, okay, I&rsquo;ll just talk.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna, so that&rsquo;ll be the equivalent of,</p>
<p>you know, yelling to your grandparents today.</p>
<p>I really suspect, I don&rsquo;t know what your thoughts are,</p>
<p>but I grew up in a time when physical contact interaction</p>
<p>was valuable.</p>
<p>I just feel like that&rsquo;s going to go the way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna disappear.</p>
<p>What, why?</p>
<p>I mean, is there anything more intimate</p>
<p>than thinking with each other?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, you talk about, you know,</p>
<p>once we were all doing that, it might feel like, man,</p>
<p>everyone was so isolated from each other so far.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t say that intimacy disappears.</p>
<p>I just meant physical, having to be in the same,</p>
<p>having to touch each other.</p>
<p>If people like that, if it is important,</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t there be whole waves of people start to say,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s all these articles that come out</p>
<p>about how, you know, in our metaverse,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve lost something important and then now there&rsquo;s a huge,</p>
<p>all first the hippies start doing it</p>
<p>and then eventually it becomes this big wave</p>
<p>and now everyone, won&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>if something truly is lost, won&rsquo;t we recover it?</p>
<p>Well, I think from first principles,</p>
<p>all of the components are there to engineer</p>
<p>intimate experiences in the metaverse or in the cyberspace.</p>
<p>And so to me, I don&rsquo;t see anything profoundly unique</p>
<p>to the physical experience.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>But then why are you saying there&rsquo;s a loss there?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just sad because I won&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s a loss for me personally, because the world.</p>
<p>So then you do think there&rsquo;s something unique</p>
<p>in the physical experience.</p>
<p>For me, because I was raised with it.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So whatever, so anything you&rsquo;re raised with,</p>
<p>you fall in love with.</p>
<p>Like people in this country came up with baseball.</p>
<p>I was raised in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand baseball.</p>
<p>I get, I like it, but I don&rsquo;t love it</p>
<p>the way Americans love it.</p>
<p>Because a lot of times they went to baseball games</p>
<p>with their father and then there&rsquo;s that family connection.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a young kid dreaming about, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>becoming an MLB player himself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, something like that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re raised with,</p>
<p>obviously is really important.</p>
<p>But I mean, fundamentally to the human experience,</p>
<p>listen, we&rsquo;re doing this podcast in person.</p>
<p>So clearly I still value it, but.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>If this were, obviously through a screen,</p>
<p>we all agree that&rsquo;s not the same.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not the same.</p>
<p>But if this were some, we had contact lenses on</p>
<p>and maybe Neuralink, maybe again, forget,</p>
<p>again, this is all the devices,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just cool as a contact lens,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all old school.</p>
<p>Once you have the brain machine interface,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll just be projection of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll take over my visual cortex.</p>
<p>My visual cortex will get put into a virtual room</p>
<p>and so will yours.</p>
<p>So we will see, we will hear, really hear and see</p>
<p>as if where you won&rsquo;t have any masks, no VR mask needed.</p>
<p>And at that point, it really will feel like you&rsquo;ll forget.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll say, will we together and physically or not?</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be so unimportant you won&rsquo;t even remember.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>This is one of those shifts in society</p>
<p>that changes everything.</p>
<p>Romantically, people still need to be together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole set of like physical things</p>
<p>with a relationship that are needed.</p>
<p>You know, like.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Like sex?</p>
<p>Sex, but also just like there&rsquo;s pheromones.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s the physical touch is such a,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like music.</p>
<p>It goes to such a deeply primitive part of us</p>
<p>that what physical touch with a romantic partner does,</p>
<p>that I think that,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be a whole wave of people who,</p>
<p>their new thing is that, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re romantically involved people</p>
<p>you never actually are in person with,</p>
<p>but, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be things</p>
<p>where you can actually smell what&rsquo;s in the room</p>
<p>and you can.</p>
<p>Yeah, and touch.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think that&rsquo;ll be one of the last things to go.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;ll be, there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>that to me seems like something that&rsquo;ll be a while</p>
<p>before people feel like there&rsquo;s nothing lost</p>
<p>by not being in the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to replicate the human interaction.</p>
<p>Although sex also, again,</p>
<p>you could not to get too like weird,</p>
<p>but you could have a thing where you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically, you know, or, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just do a massage because it&rsquo;s less like awkward,</p>
<p>but like someone, you know,</p>
<p>everyone is still imagining sex.</p>
<p>So go on.</p>
<p>A masseuse could massage a fake body</p>
<p>and you could feel whatever&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re lying down in your apartment alone,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re feeling a full.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be the new like YouTube or like streaming</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s one masseuse massaging one body,</p>
<p>but like a thousand people are experiencing.</p>
<p>Exactly right now.</p>
<p>Think about it right now.</p>
<p>You know what, Taylor Swift doesn&rsquo;t play for one person</p>
<p>and has to go around and every one of her fans</p>
<p>she has to go play for or a book, right?</p>
<p>You do it and it goes everywhere.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be the same idea.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written and thought a lot about AI.</p>
<p>So AI safety specifically,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve mentioned you&rsquo;re actually starting a podcast,</p>
<p>which is awesome.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so good at talking, so good at thinking,</p>
<p>so good at being weird in the most beautiful of ways,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve been thinking about this AI safety question.</p>
<p>Where today does your concern lie</p>
<p>for the near future, for the longterm future?</p>
<p>Like quite a bit of stuff happened,</p>
<p>including with Elon&rsquo;s work with Tesla Autopilot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of amazing robots with Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s favorite vacuum robot, iRobot, Roomba.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s obviously the applications</p>
<p>of machine learning for recommender systems</p>
<p>in Twitter, Facebook, and so on.</p>
<p>And face recognition for surveillance,</p>
<p>all these kinds of things are happening.</p>
<p>Just a lot of incredible use of not the face recognition,</p>
<p>but the incredible use of deep learning,</p>
<p>machine learning to capture information about people</p>
<p>and try to recommend to them what they wanna consume next.</p>
<p>Some of that can be abused,</p>
<p>some of that can be used for good,</p>
<p>like for Netflix or something like that.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about all this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I really don&rsquo;t think humans are very smart,</p>
<p>all things considered, I think we&rsquo;re like limited.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re dumb enough that we&rsquo;re very easily manipulable.</p>
<p>Not just like, oh, like our emotions,</p>
<p>people can, our emotions can be pulled like puppet strings.</p>
<p>I mean, again, I look at like,</p>
<p>I do look at what&rsquo;s going on in political polarization now</p>
<p>and I see a lot of puppet string emotions happening.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot to be scared of for sure,</p>
<p>like very scared of.</p>
<p>I get excited about a lot of very specific things.</p>
<p>Like one of the things I get excited about is I like,</p>
<p>so the future of wearables, right?</p>
<p>Again, I think that it would be like,</p>
<p>oh, the wrist, the Fitbit around my wrist</p>
<p>is gonna seem, you know, the whoop</p>
<p>is gonna seem really hilariously old school in 20 years.</p>
<p>Back with Neuralink.</p>
<p>Like a big bracelet, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna turn into little sensors in our blood probably,</p>
<p>or, you know, even, you know, infrared,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re, you know, just things that are gonna be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be collecting a hundred times more data</p>
<p>than it collects now, more nuanced data,</p>
<p>more specific to our body.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be, you know, super reliable,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the hardware side.</p>
<p>And then the software is gonna be,</p>
<p>this is, I&rsquo;ve not done my deep dive.</p>
<p>This is all speculation,</p>
<p>but the software is gonna get really good.</p>
<p>And this is the AI component.</p>
<p>And so I get excited about specific things like that.</p>
<p>Like think about if hardware were able to collect,</p>
<p>first of all, the hardware knows your whole genome</p>
<p>and we know a lot more about what a genome sequence means.</p>
<p>Cause you can collect your genome now</p>
<p>and we just don&rsquo;t know much.</p>
<p>We, okay, we don&rsquo;t have much to do with that information.</p>
<p>As AI gets, so now you have your genome,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got what&rsquo;s in your blood at any given moment,</p>
<p>all the levels of everything, right?</p>
<p>You have the exact width of your heart arteries</p>
<p>at any given moment, you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>All the, all the virons,</p>
<p>all the viruses that ever visited your body</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s a trace of it.</p>
<p>So you have all the pathogens,</p>
<p>all the things that like,</p>
<p>you should be concerned about health wise</p>
<p>and might have threatened you,</p>
<p>you might be immune from all of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>They also, of course it knows</p>
<p>how fast your heart is beating</p>
<p>and it knows how much you know,</p>
<p>exactly the amount of exercise,</p>
<p>knows your muscle mass and your weight and all that,</p>
<p>but it also maybe can even know your emotions.</p>
<p>I mean, make, if emotions, you know, what are they,</p>
<p>you know, where do they come from?</p>
<p>Probably pretty obvious chemicals once we get in there.</p>
<p>So again, Neuralink can be involved here maybe</p>
<p>in collecting information, you know,</p>
<p>cause right now you have to do the thing,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your mood right now?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to even assess, you know,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a bad mood, it&rsquo;s hard to even, but.</p>
<p>By the way, just as a shout out,</p>
<p>Lisa Feldman Barrett, who&rsquo;s a neuroscientist</p>
<p>at Northeastern just wrote a,</p>
<p>I mean, not just, like a few years ago,</p>
<p>wrote a whole book saying our expression of emotions</p>
<p>has nothing to do with the experience of emotions.</p>
<p>So you really actually want to be measuring.</p>
<p>That, that&rsquo;s exactly.</p>
<p>I, you can tell because one of these apps pops up</p>
<p>and says, you know, what, how do you feel right now?</p>
<p>Good, bad?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like I feel bad right now because the thing popping up</p>
<p>reminded me that I&rsquo;m procrastinating.</p>
<p>So I was on my phone, I should have been more,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s not my, you know.</p>
<p>So I think it will probably be able to very,</p>
<p>get all this info, right?</p>
<p>Now the AI can go to town.</p>
<p>Think about when the AI gets really good at this</p>
<p>and it knows your genome and it knows it can just,</p>
<p>I want the AI to just tell me what to do when it turns up.</p>
<p>Okay, so how about this?</p>
<p>Now imagine attaching that to a meal service, right?</p>
<p>And the meal service has everything, you know,</p>
<p>all the million ingredients and supplements and vitamins</p>
<p>and everything.</p>
<p>And I give the, I tell the AI my broad goals.</p>
<p>I want to gain muscle or I want to, you know,</p>
<p>maintain my weight, but I want to have more energy</p>
<p>or whatever, I just want, or I want to, you know,</p>
<p>I just want to be very healthy and I want to,</p>
<p>obviously everyone wants the same, like 10 basic things.</p>
<p>Like you want to avoid cancer, you want to, you know,</p>
<p>various things, you want to age slower.</p>
<p>So now the AI has my goals and a drone comes at,</p>
<p>you know, a little thing pops up and it says like,</p>
<p>you know, beep, beep, like, you know, 15 minutes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to eat because it knows that&rsquo;s a great,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the right time for my body to eat.</p>
<p>15 minutes later, a little slot opens in my wall</p>
<p>where a drone has come from the factory,</p>
<p>the eating, the food factory and dropped the perfect meal</p>
<p>for my, that moment for me, for my mood, for my genome,</p>
<p>for my blood contents.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s because it knows my goals.</p>
<p>So, you know, it knows I want to feel energy at this time</p>
<p>and then I want to wind down here.</p>
<p>So those things you have to tell it.</p>
<p>Well, plus the pleasure thing, like it knows what kind</p>
<p>of components of a meal you&rsquo;ve enjoyed in the past</p>
<p>so you can assemble the perfect meal.</p>
<p>Exactly, it knows you way better than you know yourself,</p>
<p>better than any human could ever know you.</p>
<p>And a little thing pops up,</p>
<p>you still have some choice, right?</p>
<p>Still, it pops up and it says like, you know, coffee,</p>
<p>because it knows that, you know, my cutoff,</p>
<p>they says, you know, I can have coffee</p>
<p>for the next 15 minutes only because at that point</p>
<p>it knows how long it stays in my system.</p>
<p>It knows what my sleep is like when I have it too late.</p>
<p>It knows I have to wake up at this time tomorrow</p>
<p>because that was my calendar.</p>
<p>And so I think a lot of people&rsquo;s, this is,</p>
<p>I think something that humans are wrong about</p>
<p>is that most people will hear this and be like,</p>
<p>that sounds awful, that sounds dystopian.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t, it sounds incredible.</p>
<p>And if we all had this, we would not look back and be like,</p>
<p>I wish I was like making awful choices every day</p>
<p>like I was in the past.</p>
<p>And then this isn&rsquo;t, these aren&rsquo;t important decisions.</p>
<p>Your important decision making energy,</p>
<p>your important focus and your attention can go</p>
<p>onto your kids and on your work and on, you know,</p>
<p>helping other people and things that matter.</p>
<p>And so I think AI, when I think about like personal</p>
<p>lifestyle and stuff like that, I really love,</p>
<p>like I love thinking about that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be very, and I think we&rsquo;ll all be</p>
<p>so much healthier that when we look back today,</p>
<p>one of the things that&rsquo;s gonna look so primitive</p>
<p>is the one size fits all thing,</p>
<p>getting like reading advice about keto.</p>
<p>Each genome is gonna have very specific,</p>
<p>one, you know, unique advice coming from AI.</p>
<p>And so, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, the customization that&rsquo;s enabled by collection</p>
<p>of data and the use of AI, a lot of people think</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the, like they think of the worst case scenario</p>
<p>that data being used by authoritarian governments</p>
<p>to control you, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think about most likely,</p>
<p>especially in a capitalist society,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s most likely going to be used as part of a competition</p>
<p>to get you the most delicious and healthy meal possible</p>
<p>as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the world will definitely be much better</p>
<p>with the integration of data.</p>
<p>But of course, you wanna be able to be transparent</p>
<p>and honest about how that data is misused.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to have free speech</p>
<p>and people to speak out, like when some bullshit</p>
<p>is being done by companies.</p>
<p>That we need to have our wits about us as a society.</p>
<p>Like this is free speech is the mechanism</p>
<p>by which the big brain can think, can think for itself,</p>
<p>can think straight, can see straight.</p>
<p>When you take away free speech, when you start saying</p>
<p>that in every topic, when any topic&rsquo;s political,</p>
<p>it becomes treacherous to talk about.</p>
<p>So forget the government taking away free speech.</p>
<p>If the culture penalizes nuanced conversation</p>
<p>about any topic that&rsquo;s political</p>
<p>and the politics is so all consuming</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s such a incredible market to polarize people,</p>
<p>for media to polarize people and to bring any topic it can</p>
<p>into that and get people hooked on it as a political topic,</p>
<p>we become a very dumb society.</p>
<p>So free speech goes away as far as it matters.</p>
<p>People say, oh, people like to say outside,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know what free speech is.</p>
<p>Free speech is, your free speech is not being violated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>My first amendment rights are not being violated.</p>
<p>But the culture of free speech,</p>
<p>which is the second ingredient of two,</p>
<p>you need the first amendment</p>
<p>and you need the culture of free speech.</p>
<p>And now you have free speech</p>
<p>and the culture is much more specific.</p>
<p>You obviously can have a culture that believes people</p>
<p>right now take any topic again, that has to do with like,</p>
<p>some very sensitive topics, police shootings,</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s going on in K through 12 schools</p>
<p>or even climate change, take any of these.</p>
<p>And the first amendment&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get arrested no matter what you say.</p>
<p>The culture of free speech is gone</p>
<p>because you will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Your life can be over as far as it matters</p>
<p>if you say the wrong thing.</p>
<p>But a really vigorous culture of free speech,</p>
<p>you get no penalty at all</p>
<p>for even saying something super dumb.</p>
<p>People will say, like, people will laugh and be like,</p>
<p>well, that was like kind of hilariously offensive</p>
<p>and like, not at all correct.</p>
<p>Like, you know, you&rsquo;re wrong and here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>But no one&rsquo;s like mad at you.</p>
<p>Now the brain is thinking at its best.</p>
<p>The IQ of the big brain is like,</p>
<p>as high as it can be in that culture.</p>
<p>And the culture where, and you say something wrong</p>
<p>and people say, oh, wow, you&rsquo;ve changed.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, like, look, this is his real colors.</p>
<p>He knows the big brain is dumb.</p>
<p>You still have mutual respect for each other.</p>
<p>So like, you don&rsquo;t think lesser of others</p>
<p>when they say a bunch of dumb things.</p>
<p>You know it&rsquo;s just the play of ideas.</p>
<p>But you still have respect, you still have love for them.</p>
<p>Because I think the worst case is</p>
<p>when you have a complete free like anarchy of ideas</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like everybody lost hope</p>
<p>that something like a truth can even be converged towards.</p>
<p>Like, everybody has their own truth.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s just chaos.</p>
<p>Like, if you have mutual respect</p>
<p>and a mutual goal of arriving at the truth</p>
<p>and the humility that you want to listen</p>
<p>to other people&rsquo;s ideas,</p>
<p>and a forgiveness that other people&rsquo;s ideas</p>
<p>might be dumb as hell,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re lesser beings,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like a weird balance to strike.</p>
<p>Right now people are being trained, little kids,</p>
<p>college students, being trained</p>
<p>to think the exact opposite way.</p>
<p>To think that there&rsquo;s no such thing as objective truth,</p>
<p>which is, you know, the objective truth</p>
<p>is the end on the compass for every thinker.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re necessarily on our way or we&rsquo;re finding,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re all aiming in the same direction.</p>
<p>We all believe that there&rsquo;s a place</p>
<p>we can eventually get closer to.</p>
<p>Not objective truth, you know,</p>
<p>teaching them that disagreement is bad, violence.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, you know, you quickly sound like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going on like a political rant with this topic,</p>
<p>but like, it&rsquo;s really bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like genuinely the worst.</p>
<p>If I had my own country,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like I would teach kids</p>
<p>some very specific things</p>
<p>that this is doing the exact opposite of,</p>
<p>and it sucks, it sucks.</p>
<p>Speaking of a way to escape this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve tweeted 30 minutes of reading a day equals,</p>
<p>yeah, this whole video,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s cool to think about reading,</p>
<p>like as a habit and something that accumulates.</p>
<p>You said 30 minutes of reading a day</p>
<p>equals 1000 books in 50 years.</p>
<p>I love like thinking about this,</p>
<p>like chipping away at the mountain.</p>
<p>Can you expand on that sort of the habit of reading?</p>
<p>How do you recommend people read?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>If you do something, a little of something every day,</p>
<p>it compiles, it compiles.</p>
<p>You know, I always think about like the people</p>
<p>who achieve these incredible things in life,</p>
<p>these great, like famous, legendary people,</p>
<p>they have the same number of days that you do,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not like they were doing magical days.</p>
<p>They just, they got a little done every day,</p>
<p>and that adds up to a monument,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re putting one brick in a day,</p>
<p>eventually they have this building,</p>
<p>this legendary building.</p>
<p>So you can take writing,</p>
<p>someone who, you know, there&rsquo;s two aspiring writers,</p>
<p>and one doesn&rsquo;t ever write,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t, you know, manages to never zero write,</p>
<p>zero pages a day,</p>
<p>and the other one manages to do two pages a week, right?</p>
<p>Not very much.</p>
<p>The other one does zero pages a week,</p>
<p>two pages a week, 98% of both of their time is the same.</p>
<p>The other person, just 2%, they&rsquo;re doing one other thing.</p>
<p>One year later, they have written,</p>
<p>they write two books a year.</p>
<p>This prolific person, you know, in 20 years,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve written 40 books,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re one of the most prolific writers of all time.</p>
<p>They write two pages a week.</p>
<p>Sorry, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>That was two pages a day.</p>
<p>Okay, two pages a week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still writing about a book every two years.</p>
<p>So in 20 years, you&rsquo;ve still written 10 books,</p>
<p>also prolific writer, right?</p>
<p>Huge, massive writing career.</p>
<p>You write two pages every Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The other person has the same exact week,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t do that Sunday morning thing.</p>
<p>They are a wannabe writer.</p>
<p>They always said they could write.</p>
<p>They talk about how they used to be,</p>
<p>and nothing happens, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s inspiring, I think,</p>
<p>for a lot of people who feel frustrated</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not doing anything.</p>
<p>So reading is another example</p>
<p>where someone who reads very, you know, doesn&rsquo;t read,</p>
<p>and someone who&rsquo;s a prolific reader,</p>
<p>you know, I always think about like the Tyler Cowen types.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how the hell do you read so much?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s infuriating, you know?</p>
<p>Or like James Clear puts out his like,</p>
<p>his 10 favorite books of the year,</p>
<p>his 20 favorite books of the year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, your 20 favorites?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m trying to just read 20 books,</p>
<p>like that would be an amazing year.</p>
<p>So, but the thing is,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not doing something crazy and magical.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just reading a half hour a night, you know?</p>
<p>If you read a half hour a night,</p>
<p>the calculation I came to is that</p>
<p>you can read a thousand books in 50 years.</p>
<p>So as someone who&rsquo;s 80 and they&rsquo;ve read a thousand books,</p>
<p>you know, between 30 and 80,</p>
<p>they are extremely well read.</p>
<p>They can delve deep into many nonfiction areas.</p>
<p>They can be, you know, an amazing fiction reader,</p>
<p>avid fiction reader.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s a half hour a day.</p>
<p>Some people can do an hour,</p>
<p>a half hour in the morning audio book,</p>
<p>half hour at night in bed.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;ve read 2000 books.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s motivating.</p>
<p>And you realize that a lot of times you think</p>
<p>that the people who are doing amazing things</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not, you think that there&rsquo;s a bigger gap</p>
<p>between you and them than there really is.</p>
<p>I, on the reading front, I&rsquo;m a very slow reader,</p>
<p>which is just a very frustrating fact about me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m faster with audio books.</p>
<p>And also I just, you know, I&rsquo;ll just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just hard to get myself to read,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve started doing audio books</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll wake up, throw it on, do it in the shower,</p>
<p>brushing my teeth, you know, making breakfast,</p>
<p>dealing with the dogs, things like that, whatever,</p>
<p>until I sit down.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I can read, I can read a book a week,</p>
<p>a book every 10 days at that clip.</p>
<p>And suddenly I&rsquo;m this big reader</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just, while doing my morning stuff,</p>
<p>I have it on and also it&rsquo;s this fun,</p>
<p>it makes the morning so fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like having a great time the whole morning.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, oh, I&rsquo;m so into this book.</p>
<p>So I think that, you know, audio books</p>
<p>is another amazing gift to people</p>
<p>who have a hard time reading.</p>
<p>I find that that&rsquo;s actually an interesting skill.</p>
<p>I do audio books quite a bit.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a skill to maintain, at least for me,</p>
<p>probably the kind of books I read,</p>
<p>which is often like history or like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of content.</p>
<p>And if you miss parts of it, you miss out on stuff.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a skill to maintain focus.</p>
<p>At least for me.</p>
<p>Well, the 10 second back button is very valuable.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So I just, if I get lost,</p>
<p>sometimes the book is so good</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m thinking about what the person just said.</p>
<p>And I just get, the skill for me is just remembering to pause.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t, no problem, just back, back, back, back.</p>
<p>Just three quick backs.</p>
<p>So of course it&rsquo;s not that efficient,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, I do the same thing when I&rsquo;m reading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll read a whole paragraph</p>
<p>and realize I was tuning out.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know?</p>
<p>You know, I haven&rsquo;t actually even considered to try that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been so hard on myself maintaining focus</p>
<p>because you do get lost in thought.</p>
<p>Maybe I should try that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and when you get lost in thought, by the way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re processing the book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not wasted time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your brain really categorizing</p>
<p>and cataloging what you just read and like.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s several kinds of thoughts, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s thoughts related to the book</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a thought that it could take you elsewhere.</p>
<p>Well, I find that if I am continually thinking</p>
<p>about something else, I just say, I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I just pause the book.</p>
<p>Yeah, especially in the shower or something</p>
<p>when like, that&rsquo;s sometimes</p>
<p>when really great thoughts come up.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m having all these thoughts about other stuff,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying clearly my mind wants to work on something else.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just pause it.</p>
<p>Yeah, quiet, Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about something else right now.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Also you can, things like you have to head out to the store.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna read 20 pages on that trip.</p>
<p>Just walking back and forth, going to the airport.</p>
<p>I mean, flights, you know, the Uber,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re walking to the,</p>
<p>walking through the airport,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sharing the security line.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading the whole time, like,</p>
<p>I know this is not groundbreaking.</p>
<p>People know what audio books are,</p>
<p>but I think that more people</p>
<p>should probably get into them than do.</p>
<p>Cause I know a lot of people,</p>
<p>they have this stubborn kind of things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like, I like to have the paper book and sure,</p>
<p>but like, it&rsquo;s pretty fun to be able to read.</p>
<p>I still, I listen to a huge number of audio books</p>
<p>and podcasts, but I still,</p>
<p>the most impactful experiences for me are still reading.</p>
<p>And I read very, very slow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very frustrating when like,</p>
<p>you go to these websites like that estimate</p>
<p>how long a book takes on average,</p>
<p>that those are always annoying.</p>
<p>They do like a page a minute when I read like best,</p>
<p>a page every two minutes, at best.</p>
<p>At best, when you&rsquo;re like really like,</p>
<p>actually not pausing.</p>
<p>I just, my ADD, it&rsquo;s like, I just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to keep focusing.</p>
<p>And I also like to really absorb.</p>
<p>So on the other side of things,</p>
<p>when I finish a book, 10 years later, I&rsquo;ll be like,</p>
<p>you know that scene when this happens</p>
<p>and another friend read it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be like, what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember any like details.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, I can tell you like the entire.</p>
<p>So I absorbed the shit out of it,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth it to like have to read</p>
<p>so less, so much less in my life.</p>
<p>I actually, so in terms of going to the airport,</p>
<p>you know, in these like filler moments of life,</p>
<p>I do a lot of, it&rsquo;s an app called Anki.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a space repetition app.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all of these facts I have when I read,</p>
<p>I write it down if I want to remember it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s these, you review it.</p>
<p>And the one, the things you remember,</p>
<p>it takes longer and longer to bring back up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like flashcards, but a digital app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Anki.</p>
<p>I recommend it to a lot of people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge community of people</p>
<p>that are just like obsessed with it.</p>
<p>Anki?</p>
<p>A N K I.</p>
<p>So this is extremely well known app and idea,</p>
<p>like among students who are like medical students,</p>
<p>like people that really have to study.</p>
<p>Like this is not like fun stuff.</p>
<p>They really have to memorize a lot of things.</p>
<p>They have to remember them well.</p>
<p>They have to be able to integrate them</p>
<p>with a bunch of ideas.</p>
<p>And I find it to be really useful for like,</p>
<p>when you read history,</p>
<p>if you think this particular factoid,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d probably be extremely useful for you.</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;re, that&rsquo;d be interesting actually thought.</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;re doing, you talked about like opening up</p>
<p>a trillion tabs and reading things.</p>
<p>You know, you probably want to remember some facts</p>
<p>you read along the way.</p>
<p>Like you might remember, okay,</p>
<p>this thing I can&rsquo;t directly put into the writing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a cool little factoid.</p>
<p>I want to.</p>
<p>Oh, all the time.</p>
<p>Store that in there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I go Anki, drop it in.</p>
<p>Oh, you can just drop it in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You drop it in a line of a podcast or like a video?</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>I guess I can type it though.</p>
<p>So yes.</p>
<p>So Anki, there&rsquo;s a bunch of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called Space Repetitions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of apps that are much nicer than Anki.</p>
<p>Anki is the ghetto, like Craigslist version,</p>
<p>but it has a giant community because people are like,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want features.</p>
<p>We want a text box.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s very basic, very stripped down.</p>
<p>So you can drop in stuff.</p>
<p>You can drop it.</p>
<p>That sounds really,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I have not come across this.</p>
<p>You actually, once you look into it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll realize that how have I not come,</p>
<p>you are the person,</p>
<p>I guarantee you&rsquo;ll probably write a blog about it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you actually have it.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s also just like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your people too.</p>
<p>And my people say, what do you write about?</p>
<p>Literally anything I find interesting.</p>
<p>And so for me, once you start a blog,</p>
<p>like your entire worldview becomes,</p>
<p>would this be a good blog post?</p>
<p>Would this be, I mean, that&rsquo;s the lens</p>
<p>I see everything through,</p>
<p>but I constantly coming across something</p>
<p>or just a tweet, something that I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>ooh, I need to like share this with my readers.</p>
<p>My readers to me are like my friends who I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna, oh, I need to show,</p>
<p>I need to tell them about this.</p>
<p>And so I feel like just a place to,</p>
<p>I mean, I collect things in a document right now,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s like really good,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the little factoids and stuff like that.</p>
<p>I think, especially if I&rsquo;m learning something,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m like.</p>
<p>So the problem is when you say stuff,</p>
<p>when you look at it, like tweet and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>is you also need to couple that with a system for review.</p>
<p>Cause what Anki does is like literally,</p>
<p>it determines for me, I don&rsquo;t have to do anything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this giant pile of things I&rsquo;ve saved</p>
<p>and it brings up to me, okay, here&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>When Churchill did something, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading about World War II a lot now,</p>
<p>like a particular event, here&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Do you remember when, what year that happened?</p>
<p>And you say yes or no, or like you get to pick,</p>
<p>you get to see the answer and you get to self evaluate</p>
<p>how well you remember that fact.</p>
<p>And if you remember well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be another month before you see it again.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t remember, it&rsquo;ll bring it up again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a way to review tweets, to review concepts.</p>
<p>And it offloads the kind of,</p>
<p>the process of selecting which parts</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to review or not.</p>
<p>And you can grow that library.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously medical students use it</p>
<p>for like tens of thousands of facts and it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It just gamifies it too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you can passively sit back and just,</p>
<p>and the thing will like make sure</p>
<p>you eventually learn it all.</p>
<p>This is, you know, you don&rsquo;t have to be the executive</p>
<p>calling that like the program,</p>
<p>the memorization program someone else is handling.</p>
<p>I would love to hear about like you trying it out</p>
<p>or space repetition as an idea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few other apps, but Anki&rsquo;s the big master.</p>
<p>I totally want to try.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written and spoken quite a bit about procrastination.</p>
<p>I like you suffer from procrastination</p>
<p>like many other people, suffering quotes.</p>
<p>How do we avoid procrastination?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the suffer is in quotes.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a huge part of the problem</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s treated like a silly problem.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t take it seriously as a dire problem,</p>
<p>but it can be.</p>
<p>It can ruin your life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, we talked about the compiling concept</p>
<p>with, you know, if you read a little,</p>
<p>you know, if you write, if you write two pages a week,</p>
<p>you write a book every two years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a prolific writer, right?</p>
<p>And the difference between, you know,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s not that that person&rsquo;s working so hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that they have the ability to,</p>
<p>when they commit to something like on Sunday mornings,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna write two pages.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>They respect, they have enough,</p>
<p>they respect the part of them that made that decision</p>
<p>is a respected character in their brain.</p>
<p>And they say, well, that&rsquo;s, I decided it,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna do it.</p>
<p>The procrastinator won&rsquo;t do those two pages.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just exactly the kind of thing</p>
<p>the procrastinator will keep on their list</p>
<p>and they will not do.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re any less talented</p>
<p>than the writer who does the two pages.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean they want it any less.</p>
<p>Maybe they want it even more.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t mean that they wouldn&rsquo;t be just as happy</p>
<p>having done it as the writer who does it.</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;re missing out on,</p>
<p>picture a writer who writes 10 books, you know,</p>
<p>bestsellers, and they go on these book tours</p>
<p>and, you know, they, and they just are so gratified</p>
<p>with their career and, you know,</p>
<p>and they think about what the other person is missing</p>
<p>who does none of that, right?</p>
<p>So that is a massive loss, a massive loss.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because the internal mechanism in their brain</p>
<p>is not doing what the other person&rsquo;s is.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t have the respect for the part of them</p>
<p>that made the choice.</p>
<p>They feel like it&rsquo;s someone they can disregard.</p>
<p>And so to me, it&rsquo;s in the same boat</p>
<p>as someone who is obese because their eating habits</p>
<p>make them obese over time or their exercise habits.</p>
<p>So that, you know, that&rsquo;s a huge loss for that person.</p>
<p>That person is, you know, the health problems</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just probably making them miserable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s self inflicted, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s self defeating, but that doesn&rsquo;t make an easy problem</p>
<p>to fix just because you&rsquo;re doing it to yourself.</p>
<p>So to me, procrastination is another one of these</p>
<p>where you are the only person in your own way.</p>
<p>You are, you know, you are failing at something</p>
<p>or not doing something that you really want to do.</p>
<p>You know, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be work.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re, you want to get out of that marriage</p>
<p>that you know, you realize it hits you.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be in this marriage.</p>
<p>You should get divorced and you wait 20 extra years</p>
<p>before you do it or you don&rsquo;t do it at all.</p>
<p>That is, you know, you&rsquo;re not living the life</p>
<p>that you know you should be living, right?</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is it&rsquo;s also a funny problem</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s short term procrastination,</p>
<p>which I talk about as, you know,</p>
<p>the kind that has a deadline.</p>
<p>Now, some people, you know,</p>
<p>this is when I bring in, there&rsquo;s different characters.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the panic monster comes in the room</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you actually, you know,</p>
<p>the procrastinator can, there&rsquo;s different levels.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the kind that even when there&rsquo;s a deadline,</p>
<p>they stop panicking.</p>
<p>They just, they&rsquo;ve given up</p>
<p>and they really have a problem.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the kind that when there&rsquo;s a deadline,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll do it, but they&rsquo;ll wait till the last second.</p>
<p>Both of those people, I think have a huge problem</p>
<p>once there&rsquo;s no deadline because,</p>
<p>and most of the important things in life,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no deadline, which is, you know,</p>
<p>changing your career, you know,</p>
<p>becoming a writer when you never have been before,</p>
<p>getting out of your relationship,</p>
<p>you know, be doing whatever you need to,</p>
<p>the changes you need to make</p>
<p>in order to get into a relation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thing after it.</p>
<p>Launching a startup.</p>
<p>Launching a startup, right?</p>
<p>Or once you&rsquo;ve launched a startup,</p>
<p>firing is the right, someone that needs to be fired, right?</p>
<p>I mean, going out for fundraising</p>
<p>instead of just trying to, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many moments when the big change</p>
<p>that you know you should be making</p>
<p>that would completely change your life</p>
<p>if you just did it has no deadline.</p>
<p>It just has to be coming from yourself.</p>
<p>And I think that a ton of people have a problem</p>
<p>where they will, they think this delusion</p>
<p>that, you know, I&rsquo;m gonna do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely gonna do that, you know,</p>
<p>but not this week, not this month,</p>
<p>not today, because whatever.</p>
<p>And they make this excuse again and again,</p>
<p>and it just sits there on their list collecting dust.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, to me, it is a very real suffering.</p>
<p>And the fix isn&rsquo;t fixing the habits.</p>
<p>Just like not working on the fix, first of all.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, okay, there is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, just that you have a boat that sucks</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s leaking and it&rsquo;s gonna sink.</p>
<p>You can fix it with duct tape for a couple of,</p>
<p>you know, for one ride or whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really fixing the boat,</p>
<p>but you can get you by.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s duct tape solutions.</p>
<p>To me, so the panic monster is the character</p>
<p>that rushes into the room once the deadline gets too close</p>
<p>or once there&rsquo;s some scary external pressure,</p>
<p>not just from yourself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a huge aid to a lot of procrastinators.</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s a lot of people who won&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, do that thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been writing that book they wanted to write,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s way fewer people</p>
<p>who will not show up to the exam.</p>
<p>You know, most people show up to the exam.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s because the panic monster</p>
<p>is gonna freak out if they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you can create a panic monster.</p>
<p>If you wanna, you know, you really wanna write music,</p>
<p>you really wanna become a singer, songwriter,</p>
<p>well, book a venue, tell 40 people about it</p>
<p>and say, hey, on, you know, this day, two months from now,</p>
<p>come and see, I&rsquo;m gonna play you some of my songs.</p>
<p>You now have a panic monster, you&rsquo;re gonna write songs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s duct tape things.</p>
<p>You know, you can do things, you know, people do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a lot of this with a friend and I say,</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t get X done by a week from now,</p>
<p>I have to donate a lot of money</p>
<p>somewhere I don&rsquo;t wanna donate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you would put that</p>
<p>in the category of duct tape solutions.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s not, why do I need that, right?</p>
<p>If I really had solved this,</p>
<p>this is something I want to do for me, it&rsquo;s selfish.</p>
<p>This is, I just literally just want to be selfish here</p>
<p>and do the work I need to do</p>
<p>to get the goals I wanna get, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a much, all the incentives</p>
<p>should be in the right place.</p>
<p>And yet, if I don&rsquo;t say that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be a week from now and I won&rsquo;t have done it.</p>
<p>Something weird is going on, there&rsquo;s some resistance,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some force that is prevent,</p>
<p>that is in my own way, right?</p>
<p>And so doing something where I have to pay all this money,</p>
<p>okay, now I&rsquo;ll panic and I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s duct tape.</p>
<p>Fixing the boat is something where I don&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>I just will do the things that I,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;m talking about super crazy work ethic.</p>
<p>Just like, for example, okay, I have a lot of examples</p>
<p>because I have a serious problem that I&rsquo;ve been working on.</p>
<p>And in some ways I&rsquo;ve gotten really successful</p>
<p>at solving it and in other ways I&rsquo;m still floundering.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah, the world&rsquo;s greatest duct taper.</p>
<p>Yes, well, I&rsquo;m pretty good at duct taping.</p>
<p>I probably could be even better and I&rsquo;m like, and I&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re procrastinating and becoming a better duct taper.</p>
<p>Literally, like, yes, there&rsquo;s nothing, I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I know what I should do as a writer, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very obvious to me is that I should wake up.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have to be crazy,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna 6 a.m. or anything insane</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not gonna be one of those crazy people at 5.30 jogs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna wake up at whatever, you know, 7.30, 8, 8.30</p>
<p>and I should have a block, like, just say nine to noon</p>
<p>where I get up and I just really quick make some coffee</p>
<p>and write.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious because all the great writers in history</p>
<p>did exactly that, some.</p>
<p>Some of them have done that, that&rsquo;s common.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some that I like these writers,</p>
<p>they do the late night sessions,</p>
<p>but most of them they do wake up.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a session, but there&rsquo;s a session that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Most writers write in the morning and there&rsquo;s a reason.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m different than those people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great time to write, you&rsquo;re fresh, right?</p>
<p>Your ideas from dreaming have kind of collected,</p>
<p>you have all, you know, new answers</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t have yesterday and you can just go.</p>
<p>But more importantly, if I just had a routine</p>
<p>where I wrote from nine to noon, weekdays.</p>
<p>Every week would have a minimum of 15 focused hours</p>
<p>of writing, which doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>A 15, 15, no, this is no joke.</p>
<p>This is, you know, you&rsquo;re not, your phone&rsquo;s away,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not talking to anyone, you&rsquo;re not opening your email,</p>
<p>you are focused writing for three hours, five.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big week for most writers, right?</p>
<p>So now what&rsquo;s happening is that every weekday</p>
<p>is a minimum of a B, I&rsquo;ll give myself.</p>
<p>You know, an A might be, you know, wow,</p>
<p>I really just got into a flow and wrote for six hours</p>
<p>and had, you know, great.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a minimum of a B, I can keep going if I want.</p>
<p>And every week is a minimum of a B with those 15 hours.</p>
<p>Right, and if I just had, talk about compiling,</p>
<p>if I, this is the two pages a week.</p>
<p>If I just did that every week,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d achieve all my writing goals in my life.</p>
<p>And yet I wake up and most days I just,</p>
<p>either I&rsquo;ll revenge procrastination late at night</p>
<p>and go to bed way too late and then wake up later</p>
<p>and get on a bad schedule and I just fall</p>
<p>into these bad schedules.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;ll wake up and there&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say I was gonna do a few emails and I&rsquo;ll open it up</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m suddenly on text and I&rsquo;m texting.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;ll just go and, you know, I&rsquo;ll make a phone call</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be on phone calls for three hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always something.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;ll start writing and then I hit a little bit of a wall,</p>
<p>but because there&rsquo;s no sacred,</p>
<p>this is a sacred writing block,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just hit the wall and say, well, this is icky</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll go do something else.</p>
<p>So duct tape, what I&rsquo;ve done is,</p>
<p>White But Why has one employee, Alisha.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the manager of lots of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s her role.</p>
<p>She truly does lots of things.</p>
<p>And one of the things we started doing is,</p>
<p>either she comes over and sits next to me</p>
<p>where she can see my screen from nine to noon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it takes.</p>
<p>The thing about procrastination is there&rsquo;s usually,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not kicking and screaming.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the feeling of, you know, in the old days</p>
<p>when you had to go to class,</p>
<p>you know, your lunch block is over and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, shit, I have class in five minutes.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s Monday morning, you go, oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you said, you know what?</p>
<p>But you go, you say, okay.</p>
<p>And then you get to class and it&rsquo;s not that bad</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re there, right?</p>
<p>You know, you have a trainer and he says, okay, next set.</p>
<p>And you go, oh, okay.</p>
<p>And you do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s someone, some external thing being like,</p>
<p>okay, I have to do this.</p>
<p>And then you have that moment of like, it sucks,</p>
<p>but I guess I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>If no one&rsquo;s there though, the problem with the procrastinator</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t have that person in their head.</p>
<p>Other people I think were raised with a sense of shame</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t do stuff.</p>
<p>And that stick in their head is hugely helpful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have that.</p>
<p>And so anyway, Alicia is sitting there next to me.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s doing her own work, but she can see my screen</p>
<p>and she of all people knows exactly what I should be doing,</p>
<p>what I shouldn&rsquo;t be doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it takes.</p>
<p>The shame of just having her see me</p>
<p>while she&rsquo;s sitting there not working</p>
<p>would just be too, it&rsquo;s too weird and too embarrassing.</p>
<p>So I get it done and it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a game changer for me.</p>
<p>So duct tape can solve, sometimes duct tape is enough,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m curious to, I&rsquo;m still trying to, what is going on?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think part of it is that we are actually wired.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m being very sane human actually</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Or not sane is not the right word.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being like, I&rsquo;m being a natural human</p>
<p>that we are not programmed to sit there and do homework</p>
<p>of a certain kind that we get the results like</p>
<p>six months later.</p>
<p>Like that is not, so we&rsquo;re supposed to conserve energy</p>
<p>and fulfill our needs as we need them</p>
<p>and do immediate things.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re overriding our natural ways</p>
<p>when we wake up and get to it.</p>
<p>And I think sometimes it&rsquo;s because the pain,</p>
<p>I think a lot of times we&rsquo;re just avoiding suffering</p>
<p>and for a lot of people, the pain of not doing it</p>
<p>is actually worse because they feel shame.</p>
<p>So if they don&rsquo;t get up and take a jog</p>
<p>and get up early and get to work,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll feel like a bad person.</p>
<p>And that is worse than doing those things.</p>
<p>And then it becomes a habit eventually</p>
<p>and it becomes just easy automatic.</p>
<p>It becomes I do it because that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>But I think that if you don&rsquo;t have a lot of shame</p>
<p>necessarily, the pain of doing those things</p>
<p>is worse in the immediate moment than not doing it.</p>
<p>But I think that there&rsquo;s this feeling</p>
<p>that you capture with your body language</p>
<p>and so on, like I don&rsquo;t want to do another set.</p>
<p>That feeling, the people I&rsquo;ve seen that are good</p>
<p>at not procrastinating are the ones</p>
<p>that have trained themselves to like the moment</p>
<p>they would be having that feeling.</p>
<p>They just, it&rsquo;s like Zen, like Sam Harris style Zen.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t experience that feeling.</p>
<p>You just march forward.</p>
<p>Like I talked to Elon about this a lot actually offline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, he doesn&rsquo;t have this.</p>
<p>No, clearly not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way I think, at least he talks about it</p>
<p>and the way I think about it is it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you just pretend you&rsquo;re like a machine running an algorithm.</p>
<p>Like you know this, you should be doing this.</p>
<p>Not because somebody told you so on.</p>
<p>This is probably the thing you want to do.</p>
<p>Like look at the big picture of your life</p>
<p>and just run the algorithm.</p>
<p>Like ignore your feelings, just run as if.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s framing, frame it differently.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, yeah, you can frame it as like,</p>
<p>it can feel like homework or it can feel like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re living your best life</p>
<p>or something when you&rsquo;re doing your work.</p>
<p>Yeah, and maybe reframe it.</p>
<p>But I think ultimately is whatever reframing</p>
<p>you need to do, you just need to do it for a few weeks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the habit is formed and you stick with it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m now on a kick where I exercise every day.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what that exercise is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not serious.</p>
<p>It could be 200 pushups, but it&rsquo;s the thing that like</p>
<p>I make sure I exercise every day</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s become way, way easier because of the habit.</p>
<p>And I just, and I don&rsquo;t like, at least with exercise</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easier to replicate that feeling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t allow myself to go like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like doing this.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, I think about that, even just like little things,</p>
<p>like I brush my teeth before I go to bed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a habit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it is effort.</p>
<p>Like if it were something else, I would be like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m gonna go to the bathroom and go do that.</p>
<p>And I just want to like, I&rsquo;m just gonna lie down right now.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t even cross my mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like that I just robotically go and do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it almost has become like a nice routine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, this part of the night, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a morning routine for me stuff is like,</p>
<p>you know, that stuff is kind of just like automated.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny because you don&rsquo;t like go,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve skipped many days.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I skipped any days brushing my teeth.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like unless I didn&rsquo;t have a toothbrush,</p>
<p>like I was in the woods or something.</p>
<p>And what is that?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s annoying.</p>
<p>Well, so to me, there is,</p>
<p>so the character that makes me procrastinate</p>
<p>is the instant gratification monkey.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve labeled him, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the rational decision maker</p>
<p>and the instant gratification monkey</p>
<p>and these battle with each other.</p>
<p>But for procrastinator, the monkey wins.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the monkey is, you know,</p>
<p>you read about this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think that this kind of more primitive brain</p>
<p>is always winning.</p>
<p>And in the non procrastinators,</p>
<p>that primitive brain is on board for some reason</p>
<p>and isn&rsquo;t resisting.</p>
<p>So, but when I think about brushing my teeth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the monkey doesn&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an option to not do it.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t even like get, there&rsquo;s no hope.</p>
<p>Monkey has no hope there.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t even like get involved.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, yeah, you know, we have to,</p>
<p>just like kind of like robotically, just like, you know,</p>
<p>it was kind of like Stockholm syndrome,</p>
<p>just like, oh no, no, I have to do this.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even like wake up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, we&rsquo;re doing this now.</p>
<p>For other things, the monkey&rsquo;s like, ooh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Most days I can win this one.</p>
<p>And so the monkey puts up that like fierce resistance</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a lot of it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the initial transition.</p>
<p>So I think of it as like jumping in a cold pool</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, I will spend the whole day</p>
<p>pacing around the side of the pool in my bathing suit,</p>
<p>just being like, I don&rsquo;t want to have that one second</p>
<p>when you first jump in and it sucks.</p>
<p>And then once you&rsquo;re, once I&rsquo;m in,</p>
<p>once I jump in, I&rsquo;m usually, you know,</p>
<p>once I start writing, I&rsquo;m suddenly I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, this isn&rsquo;t so bad.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m kind of into it.</p>
<p>And then I, then sometimes you can&rsquo;t tear me away.</p>
<p>You know, then I suddenly I&rsquo;m like, I get into a flow.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, once I get into cold water, I don&rsquo;t mind it,</p>
<p>but I will spend hours standing around the side of the pool.</p>
<p>And by the way, I do this in a more literal sense.</p>
<p>When I go to the gym with a trainer in 45 minutes,</p>
<p>I do a full full ass workout.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m having a good time,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s that,</p>
<p>oh, okay, I have to go to class feeling, right?</p>
<p>But when I go to the gym alone,</p>
<p>I will literally do a set and then dick around my phone</p>
<p>for 10 minutes before the next set.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll spend an over an hour there and do way less.</p>
<p>So it is the transition.</p>
<p>Once I&rsquo;m actually doing the set,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never like, I don&rsquo;t want to stop in the middle.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s just like, I&rsquo;m going to do this.</p>
<p>And I felt happy, I just did it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about transitions that is very,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why procrastinators are late a lot of places.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I will procrastinate getting ready</p>
<p>to go to the airport,</p>
<p>even though I know I should leave at three,</p>
<p>so I can not be stressed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave at 3.36 and I&rsquo;ll be super stressed.</p>
<p>Once I&rsquo;m on the way to the airport,</p>
<p>immediately I&rsquo;m like, why didn&rsquo;t I do this earlier?</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m back on my phone doing what I was doing.</p>
<p>I just had to get in the damn car or whatever.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s some very, very odd irrational.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I was waiting for you to come</p>
<p>and you said that you&rsquo;re running a few minutes late.</p>
<p>And I was like, I was like, I&rsquo;ll go get you a coffee</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t possibly be the one who&rsquo;s early.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always late to stuff.</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s disrespectful</p>
<p>in the eyes of a lot of people.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help, you know what I&rsquo;m doing ahead of it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t care about the people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often like, you know, for like this conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be preparing more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I obviously care about the person,</p>
<p>but for some.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s misinterpreted as like,</p>
<p>there are some people that like show up late</p>
<p>because they kind of like that quality in themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a dick, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of those people,</p>
<p>but more often it&rsquo;s someone who shows up frazzled</p>
<p>and they feel awful and they&rsquo;re furious at themselves.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so regretful.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>And I mean, all you have to do is look at those people alone</p>
<p>running through the airport, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not being disrespectful to anyone there.</p>
<p>They just inflicted this on themselves.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>This is hilarious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You tweeted a quote by James Baldwin saying, quote,</p>
<p>I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates</p>
<p>so stubbornly is because they sense once hate is gone,</p>
<p>they will be forced to deal with the pain.</p>
<p>What has been a painful but formative experience</p>
<p>in your life?</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s the flavor, the shape of your pain</p>
<p>that fuels you?</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, the first thing that jumped to mind</p>
<p>is my own like battles against myself to get my work done</p>
<p>because it affects everything.</p>
<p>When I, I just took five years in this book</p>
<p>and granted it&rsquo;s a beast.</p>
<p>Like I probably would have taken two or three years,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t need to take five.</p>
<p>And that was a lot of, not just, you know,</p>
<p>not just that I&rsquo;m not working,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;m over researching.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making it, I&rsquo;m adding in things I shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m perfectionist, you know,</p>
<p>being a perfectionist about like, oh, well I learned that.</p>
<p>Now I want to get it in there.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m going to end up cutting it later.</p>
<p>Just, you know, or I over outline, you know,</p>
<p>something until, you know, trying to get it perfect</p>
<p>when I know that&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>So making a lot of immature kind of,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m not actually that much of a writing amateur.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written, including my old blog,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a writer for 15 years.</p>
<p>I know what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I could advise other writers really well.</p>
<p>And yet I do a bunch of amateur things</p>
<p>that I know while I&rsquo;m doing them is an,</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m being an amateur.</p>
<p>So that A, it hurts the actual product.</p>
<p>It makes, you know, B, it&rsquo;s waste your precious time.</p>
<p>C, when you&rsquo;re mad at yourself,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in a negative, you know,</p>
<p>self defeating spiral, it almost inevitably will,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be less good to others.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I&rsquo;ll just, just, I used to, you know,</p>
<p>early on in my now marriage,</p>
<p>one of the things we always used to do</p>
<p>is I used to plan mystery dates.</p>
<p>You know, New York city, great, great place for this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d find some weird little adventure for us.</p>
<p>You know, it could be anything.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t tell her what it was.</p>
<p>I said, I reserving you for Thursday night,</p>
<p>you know, at seven, okay?</p>
<p>And it was such a fun part of our relationship.</p>
<p>Started writing this book and got into a really bad,</p>
<p>you know, personal space where I was like, in my head,</p>
<p>I was like, I can&rsquo;t do anything until this is done.</p>
<p>You know, like, no.</p>
<p>And I just stopped like ever valuing,</p>
<p>like, like joy of any kind.</p>
<p>Like I was like, no, any, no, that&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a trap or very quickly, you know,</p>
<p>cause I always think, you know,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be a six months away,</p>
<p>but actually five years later, I&rsquo;m like, wow,</p>
<p>I really wasn&rsquo;t living fully.</p>
<p>And for five years is not, we don&rsquo;t live very long.</p>
<p>Like talking about your prime decades,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s like a sixth of my prime years.</p>
<p>Like, wow, like that&rsquo;s a huge loss.</p>
<p>So to me, that was excruciating.</p>
<p>And, you know, and it was a bad pattern,</p>
<p>a very unproductive, unhelpful pattern for me,</p>
<p>which is I&rsquo;d wake up in the morning in this great mood,</p>
<p>great mood every morning, wake up thrilled to be awake.</p>
<p>I have the whole day ahead of me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get so much work done today.</p>
<p>And, but you know, first I&rsquo;m going to do all these other</p>
<p>things and it&rsquo;s all going to be great.</p>
<p>And then I ended up kind of failing for the day</p>
<p>with those goals, sometimes miserably,</p>
<p>sometimes only partially.</p>
<p>And then I get in bed probably a couple hours later</p>
<p>than I want to.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when all of the real reality hits me.</p>
<p>Suddenly so much regret, so much anxiety,</p>
<p>furious at myself, wishing I could take a time machine back</p>
<p>three months, six months a year,</p>
<p>or just even to the beginning of that day.</p>
<p>And just tossing and turning now.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a very bad place.</p>
<p>This is what I said, suffering,</p>
<p>procrastinators suffer in a very serious way.</p>
<p>So look, I, you know,</p>
<p>I know this probably sounds like a lot of like first world</p>
<p>problems and it is, but it&rsquo;s real suffering as well.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, so to me, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s painful because you&rsquo;re not being,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not being as good a friend or a spouse or whatever,</p>
<p>as you could be.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also not treating yourself very well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re usually not being very healthy in these moments.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re often, and you&rsquo;re not being,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being good to my readers.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a lot of this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it feels like it&rsquo;s one small tweak away.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s what I said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you just suddenly are just doing that nine to 12</p>
<p>and you get in that habit.</p>
<p>Everything else falls into place.</p>
<p>All of this reverses.</p>
<p>So I feel hopeful, but it&rsquo;s like, it is a,</p>
<p>I have not figured, I haven&rsquo;t fixed the boat yet.</p>
<p>I have some good duct tape though.</p>
<p>And you also don&rsquo;t want to romanticize it</p>
<p>because it is true that some of the greats in history,</p>
<p>especially writers suffer from all the same stuff.</p>
<p>Like they weren&rsquo;t quite able.</p>
<p>I mean, you might only write for two or three hours a day,</p>
<p>but the rest of the day is often spent kind of tortured.</p>
<p>Well, right.</p>
<p>This is the irrational thing is if I,</p>
<p>and this goes for a lot of people&rsquo;s jobs,</p>
<p>people especially who work for themselves,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be shocked how much you could wake up at nine</p>
<p>or eight or seven or whatever.</p>
<p>Get to work and stop at one,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re really focused in those hours.</p>
<p>One or two and do 25 really focused hours of stuff,</p>
<p>product stuff a week, and then there&rsquo;s 112 waking hours</p>
<p>in the week, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about 80 something hours of free time.</p>
<p>You can live, you know, if you&rsquo;re just really focused</p>
<p>in your, you know, yin and yang of your time,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what, that&rsquo;s my goal is black and white time.</p>
<p>I really focused time and then totally like</p>
<p>clean conscience free time.</p>
<p>Right now I have neither, it&rsquo;s a lot of gray.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of, I should be working, but I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m wasting this time.</p>
<p>This is bad.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just as massive.</p>
<p>So if you can just get really good at the black</p>
<p>and the white, so you just wake up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like full work.</p>
<p>And then I think a lot of people could have</p>
<p>like all this free time,</p>
<p>but instead I&rsquo;ll do those same three hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you said, I&rsquo;ll do them really late at night</p>
<p>or whatever after having tortured myself the whole day</p>
<p>and not had any fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m having fun.</p>
<p>I call it the dark playground, by the way,</p>
<p>which is where you are when you know you should be working,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re doing something else.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing something fun on paper,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s never, it feels awful.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I spend a lot of time in the dark.</p>
<p>And you know you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing it</p>
<p>and you still do it and yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clean conscience fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad, it&rsquo;s toxic.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s something about,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re draining yourself all the time.</p>
<p>And if you just did your focused hours</p>
<p>and then if you actually have good, clean fun,</p>
<p>fun can be anything.</p>
<p>Reading a book can be hanging out with someone</p>
<p>who can be really fun.</p>
<p>You can go and do something cool in the city.</p>
<p>You know, that is critical.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re recharging some part of your psyche there.</p>
<p>And I think it makes it easier</p>
<p>to actually work the next day.</p>
<p>And I say this from the experiences</p>
<p>when I have had good stretches.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know what it is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you feel like you&rsquo;re fist pounding.</p>
<p>One part of your brain is fist pounding the other part.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re like, we got this.</p>
<p>Like, we treat ourselves well.</p>
<p>Like, this is how you internally feel.</p>
<p>Like, I treat myself.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, no, it&rsquo;s work time.</p>
<p>And then later you&rsquo;re like, now it&rsquo;s play time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, okay, back to work.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re in this very healthy,</p>
<p>like parent child relationship in your head</p>
<p>versus like this constant conflict.</p>
<p>And like the kid doesn&rsquo;t respect the parent</p>
<p>and the parent hates the kid.</p>
<p>And like, yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It always feels like it&rsquo;s like one fix away.</p>
<p>So that there&rsquo;s hope.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess, I mean,</p>
<p>so much of what you said just rings so true.</p>
<p>I guess I have the same kind of hope.</p>
<p>But you know, this podcast is very regular.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m impressed.</p>
<p>Like, and I think partially what,</p>
<p>there is a bit of a duct tape solution here,</p>
<p>which is you just, the,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s always easy to schedule stuff</p>
<p>for the future for myself, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s future Tim</p>
<p>and future Tim is not my problem.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll schedule all kinds of shit for future Tim.</p>
<p>And I will then not do it.</p>
<p>But in this case,</p>
<p>you can schedule podcasts and you have to show up.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to show up.</p>
<p>Right, it seems like a good medium for procrastinating.</p>
<p>This is not my, this is what I do for fun.</p>
<p>I know, but at least this is the kind of thing,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s not your main thing.</p>
<p>Especially if it&rsquo;s not your main thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that you would dream of doing</p>
<p>and want to do and never do.</p>
<p>And I feel like your regular production here</p>
<p>is a sign that something is working,</p>
<p>at least in this regard.</p>
<p>Yeah, in this regard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m sure you have this same kind of thing</p>
<p>with the podcast.</p>
<p>In fact, because you&rsquo;re going to be doing the podcast,</p>
<p>as possible, the podcast becomes what the podcast is for me.</p>
<p>This is you procrastinating.</p>
<p>If you think about being 80</p>
<p>and if you can get into that person&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>and look back and be like, and just deep regret,</p>
<p>you just, you know, yearning,</p>
<p>you could do anything to just go back</p>
<p>and have done this differently.</p>
<p>That is desperation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you don&rsquo;t feel it yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in you yet.</p>
<p>The other thing you could do is if you have a partner,</p>
<p>if you want to partner with someone,</p>
<p>now you could say, we meet.</p>
<p>These 15 hours every week.</p>
<p>And that point you&rsquo;re going to get it done.</p>
<p>So working with someone can help.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why they say like a co founder</p>
<p>is really powerful for many reasons,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of one of them.</p>
<p>Because to actually, for the startup case,</p>
<p>you, unlike writing perhaps,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really like a hundred hour plus thing.</p>
<p>Like once you really launch, you go all in.</p>
<p>Like everything else just disappears.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t even have a hope of a balanced life</p>
<p>for a little bit.</p>
<p>So, and there co founder really helps.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>When you, you&rsquo;re one of the most interesting people</p>
<p>on the internet.</p>
<p>So as a writer, you look out into the future.</p>
<p>Do you dream about certain things you want to still create?</p>
<p>Is there projects that you want to write?</p>
<p>Is there movies you want to write or direct or?</p>
<p>Endless.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just endless sea of ideas.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s specific list of things that really excite me,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a big list that I know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never get through them all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of why the last five years really like,</p>
<p>when I feel like I&rsquo;m not moving as quickly as I could,</p>
<p>it bothers me because I have so much genuine excitement</p>
<p>to try so many different things.</p>
<p>And I get so much joy from finishing things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like doing things, but a lot of writers are like that.</p>
<p>Publishing something is hugely joyful</p>
<p>and makes it all worth it.</p>
<p>Or just finishing something you&rsquo;re proud of,</p>
<p>putting it out there and have people appreciate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the best thing in the world, right?</p>
<p>Every kid makes some little bargain with themselves,</p>
<p>has a little, a dream or something.</p>
<p>And I feel like when I do something that I make something</p>
<p>in this, for me, it&rsquo;s been mostly writing</p>
<p>and I feel proud of it and I put it out there.</p>
<p>I feel like I like, again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like fist pounding my seven year old self.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a little, like I owe it to myself</p>
<p>to do certain things.</p>
<p>And I just did one of the things I owe.</p>
<p>I just paid off some debt to myself.</p>
<p>I owed it and I paid it and it feels great.</p>
<p>It feels like very like you just feel very,</p>
<p>a lot of inner peace when you do it.</p>
<p>So the more things I can do,</p>
<p>and I just have fun doing it, right?</p>
<p>And so I just, for me that includes a lot more writing.</p>
<p>I just, short blog posts, I write very long blog posts,</p>
<p>but basically short writing</p>
<p>in the form of long blog posts is a great,</p>
<p>I love that medium.</p>
<p>I wanna do a lot more of that.</p>
<p>Books yet to be seen, I&rsquo;m gonna do this</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna have another book I&rsquo;m gonna do right after.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see if I like those two.</p>
<p>And if I do, I&rsquo;ll do more, otherwise I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I also wanna try other mediums.</p>
<p>I wanna make more videos.</p>
<p>I want to, I did a little travel series once.</p>
<p>I love doing that.</p>
<p>I wanna do more of that.</p>
<p>Almost like a vlog.</p>
<p>No, it was, I let readers in a survey</p>
<p>pick five countries they wanted me to go to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And they picked, they sent me to weird places.</p>
<p>They sent me, I went to Siberia, I went to Japan.</p>
<p>I went from there to, this is all in a row,</p>
<p>into Nigeria, from there to Iraq.</p>
<p>And from there to Greenland.</p>
<p>And then I went back to New York,</p>
<p>like two weeks in each place.</p>
<p>And I got to, each one I got to have some weird experiences.</p>
<p>I tried to like really dig in</p>
<p>and have like some interesting experiences.</p>
<p>And then I wrote about it.</p>
<p>And I taught readers a little bit</p>
<p>about the history of these places.</p>
<p>And it was just, I love doing that.</p>
<p>I love, so, and I&rsquo;m like, oh man,</p>
<p>like I haven&rsquo;t done one of those in so long.</p>
<p>And then I have a big like desire to do fictional stuff.</p>
<p>Like I want to write a sci fi at some point.</p>
<p>And I would love to write a musical.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what I was doing before Wait But Why.</p>
<p>I was with a partner, Ryan Langer.</p>
<p>We were halfway through a musical</p>
<p>and he got tied up with his other musical</p>
<p>and Wait But Why started taking off.</p>
<p>And we just haven&rsquo;t gotten back to it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s such a fun medium.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s such a silly medium, but it&rsquo;s so fun.</p>
<p>So you think about all of these mediums</p>
<p>on which you can be creative and create something</p>
<p>and you like the variety of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just that if there&rsquo;s a chance on a new medium,</p>
<p>I could do something good.</p>
<p>I want to do it.</p>
<p>I want to try it.</p>
<p>It sounds like so gratifying and so fun.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fun to just watch you actually sample these.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t wait for your podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be listening to all of them.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a cool medium to see like where it goes.</p>
<p>The cool thing about podcasting and making videos,</p>
<p>especially with a super creative mind like yours,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re going to make of it</p>
<p>until you try it.</p>
<p>Yeah, podcasts I&rsquo;m really excited about,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m like, I like going on other people&rsquo;s podcasts.</p>
<p>And I never try to have my own.</p>
<p>So with every medium,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the challenges of how the sausage is made.</p>
<p>So like the challenges of action.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s also, I like to like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go on like, as you know, long ass monologues</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the interviewer,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not supposed to do that as much.</p>
<p>So I have to like rein it in and that might be hard,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>You could also do solo type stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe I&rsquo;ll do a little of each.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s funny?</p>
<p>I mean, some of my favorite is more like solo,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s like a sidekick.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re having a conversation, but you&rsquo;re like friends,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really you ranting,</p>
<p>which I think you&rsquo;d be extremely good at.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny, yeah.</p>
<p>Or even if it&rsquo;s 50 50, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s just a friend who I want to like really riff</p>
<p>with, I just don&rsquo;t like interviewing someone,</p>
<p>which I won&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s not what the podcast will be,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried moderating panels before</p>
<p>and I cannot help myself.</p>
<p>I have to get involved and no one likes a moderator</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s too involved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unappealing.</p>
<p>So I, you know, interviewing someone and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t even, I don&rsquo;t, I just, it&rsquo;s not my,</p>
<p>I can grill someone, but that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my curiosity being like, wait, how about this?</p>
<p>And I interrupt them and I&rsquo;m trying to.</p>
<p>I see the way your brain works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like lights up with fire and excitement.</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually, I love listening.</p>
<p>I like watching people, I like listening to people.</p>
<p>So this is like me right now,</p>
<p>having just listening to a podcast.</p>
<p>This is me listening to your podcast right now.</p>
<p>I love listening to a podcast</p>
<p>because then it&rsquo;s not even like,</p>
<p>but once I&rsquo;m in the room, I suddenly can&rsquo;t help myself.</p>
<p>I jump again.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Big last ridiculous question.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>The meaning of like an individual life?</p>
<p>Your existence here on earth,</p>
<p>or maybe broadly this whole thing we&rsquo;ve got going on,</p>
<p>descendants of apes,</p>
<p>busily creating.</p>
<p>Yeah, well there&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>For me, I feel like I want to be around as long as I can.</p>
<p>If I can, if I can do some kind of crazy life extension</p>
<p>or upload myself, I&rsquo;m gonna,</p>
<p>because who doesn&rsquo;t want to see how cool</p>
<p>the year 3000 is?</p>
<p>Imagine.</p>
<p>You did say mortality was not appealing.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not appealing at all to me.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s ultimately appealing.</p>
<p>As I said, no one wants eternal life, I believe,</p>
<p>if they understood what eternity really was.</p>
<p>And I did Graham&rsquo;s number as a post,</p>
<p>and I was like, okay, no one wants to live that many years.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to choose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to say, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m truly over it now, and I&rsquo;m going to have,</p>
<p>you know, at that point we&rsquo;d have,</p>
<p>our whole society would have like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have a ceremony.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d have a whole process of someone signing off,</p>
<p>and you know, it would be beautiful,</p>
<p>and it wouldn&rsquo;t be sad.</p>
<p>Well, I think you&rsquo;d be super depressed by that point.</p>
<p>Like, who&rsquo;s gonna sign off when they&rsquo;re doing pretty good?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe, yes.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe it&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>But at least, but the point is,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m happy, I can stay around for five, you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking 50 century sounds great.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know if I want more than that.</p>
<p>50 sounds like a right number.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re thinking, if you would sign up for 50,</p>
<p>if you had a choice, one is what I get, that is bullshit.</p>
<p>Like, if you&rsquo;re somebody who wants 50,</p>
<p>one is a hideous number, right?</p>
<p>You know, anyway.</p>
<p>So for me personally, I want to be around as long as I can.</p>
<p>And then honestly, the reason I love writing,</p>
<p>the thing that I love most is like,</p>
<p>is like a warm fuzzy connection with other people, right?</p>
<p>And that can be my friends, and it can be readers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I would never want to be like a journalist</p>
<p>where their personality is like hidden behind the writing,</p>
<p>or like even a biographer, you know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people who are great writers,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, I like to personally connect.</p>
<p>And if I can take something that&rsquo;s in my head</p>
<p>and other people can say, oh my God, I think that too,</p>
<p>and this made me feel so much better,</p>
<p>it made me feel seen, like that feels amazing.</p>
<p>And I just feel like we&rsquo;re all having</p>
<p>such a weird common experience on this one little rock,</p>
<p>in this one little moment of time,</p>
<p>where this weird, these weird four limb beings,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all the same.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re all, we all, the human experience,</p>
<p>so I feel like so many of us suffer in the same ways,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all going through a lot of the same things.</p>
<p>And to me, it is very, if I lived,</p>
<p>if I was on my deathbed and I feel like I had,</p>
<p>like I had a ton of human connection,</p>
<p>and like shared a lot of common experience,</p>
<p>and made a lot of other people feel like,</p>
<p>like not alone.</p>
<p>Do you feel that as a writer?</p>
<p>Do you like hear and feel like the inspiration,</p>
<p>like all the people that you make smile,</p>
<p>and all the people you inspire?</p>
<p>Honestly, not, sometimes, you know,</p>
<p>when we did an in person event,</p>
<p>and I, you know, meet a bunch of people,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s incredibly gratifying,</p>
<p>or, you know, you just, you know, you get emails,</p>
<p>but I think it is easy to forget that how many people,</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;re just sitting there alone,</p>
<p>typing, dealing with your procrastination.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why publishing is so gratifying,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the moment when all this connection happens.</p>
<p>And especially if I had to put my finger on it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s having a bunch of people who feel lonely,</p>
<p>and their like existence is all realized,</p>
<p>like all, you know, connect, right?</p>
<p>So that, if I do a lot of that,</p>
<p>and that includes, of course, my actual spending,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of really high quality time</p>
<p>with friends and family, and like,</p>
<p>and making the whole thing as heartbreaking</p>
<p>as like mortality and life can be,</p>
<p>make the whole thing like fun,</p>
<p>and at least we can like laugh at ourselves together</p>
<p>while going through it.</p>
<p>And that to me is the, yeah.</p>
<p>And then your last blog post will be written from Mars</p>
<p>as you get the bad news that you&rsquo;re not able to return</p>
<p>because of the malfunction in the rocket.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would like to go to Mars,</p>
<p>and like go there for a week,</p>
<p>and be like, yeah, here we are, and then come back.</p>
<p>No, I know that&rsquo;s what you want.</p>
<p>Staying there, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine, by the way.</p>
<p>If I, yeah, if, so you think,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re picturing me alone on Mars as the first person there,</p>
<p>and then it malfunctions.</p>
<p>Right, no, you were supposed to return,</p>
<p>but it malfunctions, and then there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s both the hope, the awe that you experience,</p>
<p>which is how the blog starts,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s the overwhelming,</p>
<p>like feeling of existential dread,</p>
<p>but then it returns to like the love of humanity.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the thing, is if I could be writing,</p>
<p>and actually like writing something</p>
<p>that people would read back on Earth,</p>
<p>it would make it feel so much better.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, if I were just alone,</p>
<p>and no one was gonna realize what happened.</p>
<p>No, no, no, you get to write.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, it&rsquo;s perfectly safe.</p>
<p>Also, that would bring out great writing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have your deathbed on Mars alone.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s exactly the future I hope for you, Tim.</p>
<p>All right, this was an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a really special human being, Tim.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for spending</p>
<p>your really valuable time with me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to hear your podcast.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to read your next blog post,</p>
<p>which you said in a Twitter reply.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get more.</p>
<p>Yeah, soon enough, I&rsquo;ll be back.</p>
<p>After the book, which add that to the long list of ideas</p>
<p>to procrastinate about.</p>
<p>Tim, thanks so much for talking to me, man.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tim Urban.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Tim Urban himself.</p>
<p>Be humbler about what you know,</p>
<p>more confident about what&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>and less afraid of things that don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
