    <p>I&rsquo;m now recording.</p>
<p>Jesus, you look terrible.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on? Did you sleep last night?</p>
<p>Do I look tired?</p>
<p>You do look a little tired.</p>
<p>You look unshaven.</p>
<p>Yeah, what happened last night?</p>
<p>I had a holiday party at my house last night from my office and-</p>
<p>You look destroyed.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s going- I mean, did you drink?</p>
<p>I did drink, yeah.</p>
<p>What does vodka and oat milk taste like?</p>
<p>Does it taste good?</p>
<p>He had a White Russian-</p>
<p>A White Russian Big Lebowski style with oat milk.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I want a White Russian with oat milk.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Actually, my White Russian is made with oatmeal.</p>
<p>And please compliment that with a huge punch in the face.</p>
<p>Give me five minutes. I&rsquo;m gonna go shave and-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the hair of the dog.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You got a little Bloody Mary.</p>
<p>You banana bug.</p>
<p>Banana man.</p>
<p>Can I go get a beer? I might get a beer just to beat this hangover.</p>
<p>Go do it. Yeah, go get a beer.</p>
<p>Hang on, I&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>All right, listen.</p>
<p>We have to start with scam, bank run, fraud.</p>
<p>I mean, Sam.</p>
<p>Freed.</p>
<p>I get that wrong sometimes.</p>
<p>He was interviewed by Andrew Orr-Sorkin, the suit, at DealBook,</p>
<p>who gave him softball after softball.</p>
<p>Then, the next day, he was on Good Morning America.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being really passive-aggressive right now.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>We got a little chip over here.</p>
<p>We got our friend Andrew Orr-Sorkin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sticking the knife in.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sticking the knife in.</p>
<p>But J. Cal&rsquo;s got a point.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a point.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>Anyway, the New York Times continues to embarrass themselves</p>
<p>by handling Sam Bankman fraud with kid gloves.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>George Stephanopoulos, my Greek brother Stephanopoulos the Spartan,</p>
<p>came in and absolutely fricasseed and filleted Sam Bankman Freed</p>
<p>on Good Morning America.</p>
<p>Very important to note that Good Morning America,</p>
<p>the segment was between holiday cocktails and the cast of</p>
<p>The White Lotus.</p>
<p>Andrew Orr-Sorkin was at the DealBook finance conference.</p>
<p>But you know that Stephanopoulos interview was two hours,</p>
<p>but they reduced it down to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There were probably a lot of cordial conversation, banter,</p>
<p>and then softball questions.</p>
<p>Then, he does stick the knife in and does the fricassee,</p>
<p>but he cuts out all the other stuff,</p>
<p>so he just gets it down to the 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>What Stephanopoulos did to him was extraordinary in that he said over</p>
<p>and over again, in the FTX terms of service,</p>
<p>you cannot touch the user accounts,</p>
<p>but you at Alameda were taking them and you were loaning them out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who is advising Sam Bankman Freed at this point,</p>
<p>but why he is talking so much.</p>
<p>He was also on a two-hour Twitter spaces after all this.</p>
<p>At this point, Sax,</p>
<p>what do you think is going on here in the mind of Sam Bankman Freed</p>
<p>and also the media,</p>
<p>which seems to have a very variable way of dealing with this obvious</p>
<p>fraud and crime?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I can speculate about SPF.</p>
<p>I think if there is a strategy here,</p>
<p>it is this.</p>
<p>He is basically copying to criminal negligence in order to avoid the more</p>
<p>serious charges of fraud.</p>
<p>And I think, again,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a strategy here,</p>
<p>it is he saw himself being defined as Bernie Madoff 2.0 in the press.</p>
<p>And if that image,</p>
<p>which may well be true,</p>
<p>cemented around him,</p>
<p>then prosecutors would never stop.</p>
<p>They would never accept a plea that basically gave him anything less than a</p>
<p>Madoff-like sentence,</p>
<p>which would be decades in prison,</p>
<p>maybe a life sentence.</p>
<p>So he is out there doing what lawyers would tell you never to do,</p>
<p>which is basically incriminate yourself,</p>
<p>create more of a record.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s doing it to change the public perception,</p>
<p>maybe muddy up the public perception,</p>
<p>get people thinking that,</p>
<p>okay,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s admitting he did something wrong,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t deliberate.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t fraudulent.</p>
<p>It was just basically carelessness or sloppiness.</p>
<p>And if he succeeds in muddying the waters enough,</p>
<p>then maybe the prosecutors will give him a plea deal that allows him to have</p>
<p>his life back at some point.</p>
<p>I think that would be the crazy,</p>
<p>like a fox explanation of what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>there is,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>an alternative explanation as well,</p>
<p>which is,</p>
<p>I just think that these types of guys,</p>
<p>you could call it,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>a narcissistic fraudster.</p>
<p>They think they can talk their way out of anything,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>because they have,</p>
<p>they have,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve talked their way into getting hundreds of millions of dollars of</p>
<p>investment,</p>
<p>billions,</p>
<p>billions in some cases.</p>
<p>And so they just feel,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been trained by employees,</p>
<p>partners,</p>
<p>investors,</p>
<p>the press that they can talk their way out of any of this stuff.</p>
<p>I think,</p>
<p>yeah,</p>
<p>the average person is not really used to dealing with one of these</p>
<p>personality types who is,</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>they clearly are smart and their articulate articulate,</p>
<p>and they know what to say and they&rsquo;re crafting their words.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;ve learned through their life is that if they use the precise</p>
<p>magic words with a person,</p>
<p>they can pretty much,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>convince them of anything,</p>
<p>get them to do anything.</p>
<p>And in particular,</p>
<p>I would say investors tend to fall for this,</p>
<p>not because investors are dumb,</p>
<p>but because investors are so clear about what they&rsquo;re looking for and what</p>
<p>they want.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re predictable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>VCs,</p>
<p>especially we&rsquo;re looking for the a hundred X outcome or whatever.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easy for this type of personality to construct a story,</p>
<p>to essentially stroke the erogenous zones of a VC.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>and sort of trick them.</p>
<p>And so there is probably a positive reinforcement loop that gets created</p>
<p>in the minds of one of these people who,</p>
<p>and they start to think that they can basically talk their way out of any</p>
<p>situation.</p>
<p>So I think that would be part of what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>if you look at sort of the tactics that he&rsquo;s using to do this,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>all of a sudden,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to portray himself,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>before this,</p>
<p>he was portraying himself as the smartest guy in the room.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>all of a sudden there&rsquo;s this babe in the woods impression where I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know it was my subordinates.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really in control.</p>
<p>That was somebody else.</p>
<p>Each individual decision.</p>
<p>He says,</p>
<p>look sensible to him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>it all added up to something he didn&rsquo;t anticipate.</p>
<p>Like really,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>loaning yourself a billion dollars of,</p>
<p>of basically the company&rsquo;s money,</p>
<p>which was basically customer money.</p>
<p>That seemed reasonable to you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you defend that individual decision.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s many like that,</p>
<p>but,</p>
<p>but this is sort of the narrative that he&rsquo;s trying to construct.</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>um,</p>
<p>let me stop there,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s a lot more that can be said to dismantle the</p>
<p>narrative he&rsquo;s trying to create,</p>
<p>but I want to let other people get in here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your take on this?</p>
<p>And then free bird,</p>
<p>can I make a comparison to SBF and Trump through the lens of the</p>
<p>media?</p>
<p>So if you go back to 2016,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>Donald Trump violated every single establishment bias that these</p>
<p>left progressive journalist elites had.</p>
<p>And so they basically just attacked,</p>
<p>attacked,</p>
<p>attacked,</p>
<p>attacked,</p>
<p>but then you went into the election and there was a very clear</p>
<p>data point that said,</p>
<p>whatever you thought was that was at best limited.</p>
<p>And you missed the tone of the country because 50 plus percent of</p>
<p>the country held a very different view about this person.</p>
<p>And instead of taking a step back and,</p>
<p>and then the left media,</p>
<p>the mainstream media re underwriting and learning,</p>
<p>and then saying,</p>
<p>you know what,</p>
<p>mea culpa,</p>
<p>I got this wrong.</p>
<p>They just double down.</p>
<p>And they said,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>it still doesn&rsquo;t meet our priors.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re just going to ring fence this problem.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to just try to destroy this issue because,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>we want to control the narrative and,</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>and by result,</p>
<p>we want to control power.</p>
<p>Now you look at SBF,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the exact opposite.</p>
<p>He went to the perfect elite private high school.</p>
<p>Then he went to one of the most prestigious elite private</p>
<p>universities,</p>
<p>MIT,</p>
<p>his parents teach governance of all things at one of the most elite</p>
<p>liberal institutions in America,</p>
<p>Stanford,</p>
<p>they are in the establishment of the progressive left.</p>
<p>And what happened was he took customer funds and all of this money.</p>
<p>He made tens of millions of dollars of political donations.</p>
<p>He wrapped himself in this blanket of a progressive left-leaning cause</p>
<p>called effective altruism.</p>
<p>And all of the mainstream media fell for it and embraced him as well</p>
<p>as some politicians,</p>
<p>because it met everything that they themselves also bought into.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And now you have this cataclysmic event,</p>
<p>a multi-deck a billion dollar fraud or bankruptcy,</p>
<p>millions of customer accounts who are frozen,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>tens of millions to hundreds of millions to billions of dollars lost and</p>
<p>stolen from them.</p>
<p>And they refuse to re underwrite this kid.</p>
<p>And the reason is because in order to do so,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like eating your own tail and that&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p>
<p>And so this is why you have the media basically allowing him to do an apology</p>
<p>tour.</p>
<p>Now this is his second time at manipulating them.</p>
<p>The first time he was able to manipulate them by basically being one of them.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s allowing them and their desire to basically protect themselves</p>
<p>so that he can create some kind of a defense for himself.</p>
<p>And I just think the whole thing is gross because it misses the entire mood</p>
<p>of the nation.</p>
<p>This is an enormous financial fraud that was perpetrated on tens of millions of</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no accountability because in order to do so,</p>
<p>the media would effectively have to admit that they missed it and they got it</p>
<p>wrong and they refuse to do it.</p>
<p>And I think that that is the really big problem that nobody is really speaking</p>
<p>out about is like,</p>
<p>well,</p>
<p>if these folks are meant to be the last stop to make sure that there&rsquo;s truth</p>
<p>and honesty and transparency in society,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t count on them.</p>
<p>And in fact,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just going to reflect their own narrative.</p>
<p>What is one supposed to do to learn the truth?</p>
<p>In a way,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll go to your free bird is this fraud was encased in all the</p>
<p>gilded facade that America hates right now reflects the institutional rot of</p>
<p>America.</p>
<p>It reflects every single aspect of institutional rot that every non elite</p>
<p>talks about all the time.</p>
<p>But elites,</p>
<p>when they have those labels will refuse to give up.</p>
<p>And just to add to that,</p>
<p>the,</p>
<p>the,</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s missing the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say one of the big issues with the institutional rot in our country is</p>
<p>the lack of accountability.</p>
<p>When somebody gets it wrong,</p>
<p>we saw this with COVID,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>The health establishment is saying that they want amnesty and Atlantic</p>
<p>magazine was willing to give it to them.</p>
<p>So the point is that this,</p>
<p>this class of people think that when they get it wrong,</p>
<p>that there are the experts,</p>
<p>but when they get it wrong,</p>
<p>there should be no accountability.</p>
<p>And so Jamal,</p>
<p>to your point,</p>
<p>the media and these institutions are not willing to re underwrite SBF when</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so clearly as a fraudster,</p>
<p>a free bird.</p>
<p>What do you think the,</p>
<p>of this theory,</p>
<p>you had a large amount of donations to politicians.</p>
<p>Obviously you have coming from Stanford,</p>
<p>MIT,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>And then you have these investments,</p>
<p>gifts slash advertising slash donations to ProPublica,</p>
<p>Vox,</p>
<p>this new publication,</p>
<p>semaphore,</p>
<p>the intercept that have all been uncovered.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>did he do this paying off of all the elites,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>splashy cashy,</p>
<p>giving money to everybody because he knew he was doing a fraud and that this</p>
<p>is evidence of this is a premeditated fraud.</p>
<p>Or do you think this is a deranged individual who just was seeking status?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The,</p>
<p>the motivation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a video you can watch of this guy.</p>
<p>For some reason,</p>
<p>FTX has left up all of their videos on YouTube from three years ago called</p>
<p>quantitative trading seven and a half thousand cell wall of Bitcoin on</p>
<p>Binance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 17 and a half minute YouTube video of SBF trading arbitrage across</p>
<p>markets.</p>
<p>I think it provides probably the best,</p>
<p>like natural non scripted insight into this guy&rsquo;s behavior that you could see,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not like him being interviewed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just him living in his world and he&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>a mouth trying to get a piece of cheese.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like out there,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>scrambling around in the markets.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s finding edges,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s finding advantages and he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s clearly just taking advantage of them all day,</p>
<p>every day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who he is.</p>
<p>Now you put a person like that in an unregulated environment and there was</p>
<p>this clustering demand for an unregulated environment because of a lot of what</p>
<p>you guys are saying,</p>
<p>which is people have this disdain for the elitism and the,</p>
<p>and the institutional rot and all these things.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin emerged as a solution out of 2008 to the,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>the,</p>
<p>what felt like institutional rot that,</p>
<p>that governments have a key role in.</p>
<p>But when you have no regulation and you have no trusted central authority</p>
<p>involved,</p>
<p>mice that are trying to find cheese will rule the day.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what happened here.</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t this guy,</p>
<p>it was someone else.</p>
<p>It was going to be someone else.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden everyone&rsquo;s clamoring and saying,</p>
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>we needed the government to protect us.</p>
<p>No one protected us.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s got to save us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the regulators.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re people that are supposed to keep an eye on this stuff.</p>
<p>When the whole premise of so much of what was being sold was non-regulatory</p>
<p>regimes was openness was peer to peer trust protocols.</p>
<p>And it turns out that in that sort of an environment,</p>
<p>the mouse that is hungriest for the cheese will get the cheese.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much of it was,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with him saying I&rsquo;m creating intentional fraud,</p>
<p>which certainly seems to be the case versus him saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pay these guys.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much of it was even that intelligent,</p>
<p>but the guy was clearly like trying to get a piece of cheese.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this cheese eater,</p>
<p>this rat is a league of legends,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>expert playing on eight different monitors at a time,</p>
<p>the cryptocurrency game while hopped up on speed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that to be cruel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that because they admitted it.</p>
<p>They talked about it in their staff meetings,</p>
<p>instructing their traders and team members of how to take speed.</p>
<p>He admitted to it in an interview this week.</p>
<p>He said that it was all legal prescription drugs,</p>
<p>but they were taking them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Literally in the same videos you&rsquo;re referencing,</p>
<p>people see speed patches,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t even understand this,</p>
<p>but there are patches you can put on your body to deliver speed to you at</p>
<p>some,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>dose or whatever sacks you buy this theory.</p>
<p>No care that this isn&rsquo;t about the elite side of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the non elite,</p>
<p>the anarchy side of it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And this cheese eating rat was just wanting to eat more cheese.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy this narrative because I see too much design intentionality,</p>
<p>but behind what happened.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just a series of individual decisions that didn&rsquo;t add up.</p>
<p>Many of those individual decisions by themselves were totally unjustifiable.</p>
<p>And moreover,</p>
<p>there were too many,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much evidence of sophisticated behavior here.</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>he overnight went from portraying himself as a smart guy in the room to the,</p>
<p>to the babe in the woods.</p>
<p>And so,</p>
<p>for example,</p>
<p>when you look at the construction of all these entities and the corporate</p>
<p>org chart,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>of all the related entities,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very sophisticated attempt to obscure and construct certain,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>protections.</p>
<p>When you look at the way that Alameda was exempted from the normal margin</p>
<p>requirements and FTX,</p>
<p>there was the so-called back doors.</p>
<p>There was intentionality there.</p>
<p>There was intentionality in terms of who was hired to staff these</p>
<p>organizations.</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>they wasn&rsquo;t hired.</p>
<p>No board,</p>
<p>no CFO.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the guy,</p>
<p>the guy who was in charge of compliance,</p>
<p>what,</p>
<p>like Tomas talked about in a previous episode was the guy who was involved</p>
<p>in the ultimate bet,</p>
<p>a poker cheating scandal,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>not exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<p>exactly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or look at this goofy goofball,</p>
<p>Caroline Ellison,</p>
<p>who was put in charge of Alameda,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>His girlfriend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being done for a reason,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s setting it up in a certain way.</p>
<p>And you know,</p>
<p>the one time I interacted with him at this tech conference,</p>
<p>he was sitting there holding court.</p>
<p>And he had all of his minions around him who were following his orders.</p>
<p>This was a guy who was controlling his business.</p>
<p>He was making the decisions at,</p>
<p>I think a task level.</p>
<p>And he knew exactly what was going on here.</p>
<p>So look,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t buy.</p>
<p>I do not buy this idea that,</p>
<p>that he was like a blind mouse.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s just stimulus response,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>in the moment.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t my point.</p>
<p>Sacks.</p>
<p>My point was whether it was him or it was going to be someone else,</p>
<p>it was bound to happen.</p>
<p>No,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with that.</p>
<p>The idea that we want to have completely free,</p>
<p>unregulated Bahamian based trading,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>environments that we can supposedly trust because someone puts on a good</p>
<p>face when there is no real regulatory body and regulatory authority</p>
<p>overseeing it.</p>
<p>At some point it was going to happen.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>hold on.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re regulated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not set up in the Bahamas and they&rsquo;re not unregulated.</p>
<p>And he set up and he had no oversight.</p>
<p>He had no board.</p>
<p>There was no regulatory regime.</p>
<p>There was nothing.</p>
<p>How was he able to.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So first of all,</p>
<p>look,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this had to happen.</p>
<p>I think that again,</p>
<p>I think that excuses too much because it implies that if it wasn&rsquo;t SPF,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be somebody else.</p>
<p>I actually think that this was a highly concerted effort.</p>
<p>Listen,</p>
<p>he courted regulators.</p>
<p>He donated to politicians.</p>
<p>He courted the media and donated to them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He was really good at it.</p>
<p>He was really good at it.</p>
<p>He was unusually good at it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And I totally agree on that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Super smart,</p>
<p>super connected,</p>
<p>really thoughtful design on how he committed this.</p>
<p>I only think an insider could have pulled off something at this scale.</p>
<p>I think I agree.</p>
<p>I think this is where Chamath,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>I think you needed to be an insider.</p>
<p>The level of cynicism here is he knew the playbook and he admitted it.</p>
<p>You pointed this out with the chats that were released where he said,</p>
<p>he,</p>
<p>he,</p>
<p>he,</p>
<p>he.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look,</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>just like he,</p>
<p>he chat,</p>
<p>he was always intertwined with the parents.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Parents apparently bundled a bunch of money to Elizabeth Warren.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>he was dating the CEO of the business that he owned 90% in there.</p>
<p>All these other random shell companies that he owned a 100% of where they</p>
<p>were lending back and forth hundreds of millions to billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To David&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>that is a sophisticated con that you have to architect.</p>
<p>And the way that he was able to get away with it is that not a single</p>
<p>reporter or regulator thought to dig in.</p>
<p>And the reason I think is because he said all of the right things that</p>
<p>wanted them to embrace him.</p>
<p>And the reason is he admitted it.</p>
<p>This is a dumb game that we woke Westerners have to play.</p>
<p>We say the right shibboleths and then everyone thinks we&rsquo;re a good person.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Imagine.</p>
<p>Pull that quote up on what he said,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually a good quote.</p>
<p>It was what I just said.</p>
<p>Is that exactly what he said?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He said it&rsquo;s the game that we woke Westerners have to play.</p>
<p>We say the right shibboleths or everyone likes us.</p>
<p>He actually said the most uncomfortable thing out loud,</p>
<p>which is look,</p>
<p>by having gone to Crystal Springs High School,</p>
<p>by having professors,</p>
<p>by parents that went to Stanford,</p>
<p>by having gone to MIT,</p>
<p>I can pull this off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he said,</p>
<p>because he can go with those things because I&rsquo;m a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a champion of effective altruism that I can justify any of these</p>
<p>decisions,</p>
<p>how amoral or immoral that they be,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to help,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>my brother stand up a multimillion dollar pandemic response business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to do this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to do that.</p>
<p>And all of these regulators and all of these reporters said,</p>
<p>okay,</p>
<p>you get the hall pass.</p>
<p>Now imagine if you replaced him with some random kid in some developing</p>
<p>country,</p>
<p>or even from the United States who did went to public high school,</p>
<p>who went to some random state school.</p>
<p>Do you think that they could have pulled any of this stuff off?</p>
<p>No,</p>
<p>you need the patina of the privileged class.</p>
<p>The New York Times,</p>
<p>what he had,</p>
<p>the patina of the privileged class,</p>
<p>even after this fraud,</p>
<p>the New York times wrote more of a puff piece on him than the hit piece.</p>
<p>They wrote on Brian Armstrong last year when Brian Armstrong wouldn&rsquo;t tow</p>
<p>the line on allowing politics at work.</p>
<p>Remember that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the big,</p>
<p>I think what Chamath is kind of saying here is that the big enabler here</p>
<p>is not crypto per se.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of these institutional biases and elite biases that he was able</p>
<p>to play into partly because he was a big insider.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>in a way he monetized his parents&rsquo; life work.</p>
<p>The problem that I think this allows us to put a fine point on is the</p>
<p>following,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>in society we&rsquo;ve confused a lot of people to think that the opposite of</p>
<p>liberal is conservative or Republican.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the cycle that drives the mind virus inside the</p>
<p>mainstream media.</p>
<p>The problem is the opposite of liberal is illiberal.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And what illiberal means is to be narrow minded and unenlightened.</p>
<p>It means to be puritanical.</p>
<p>It means to be fundamentalist.</p>
<p>And this is really what it allows us to see.</p>
<p>Now we have now had six years of data case after case after case where</p>
<p>if you are woke,</p>
<p>if you are a social justice warrior,</p>
<p>if you have the right credentials that justify your upbringing,</p>
<p>if you have institutional,</p>
<p>uh,</p>
<p>bona fides that come from your parents,</p>
<p>you get to create the narrative and you get a hall pass.</p>
<p>And everybody else basically is at the subject and the mercy of the</p>
<p>mainstream media.</p>
<p>And so if you don&rsquo;t kiss the ring and bow down to them,</p>
<p>they will try to destroy you or run you out of town.</p>
<p>But if you are one of them,</p>
<p>they will give you a hall pass.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s time for them to change their mind in order to tell the truth,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And so these types of grifts will continue as Friedberg said,</p>
<p>because there is no check and balance without a healthy independent media.</p>
<p>There is no way for all of us to actually know what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p>Guys,</p>
<p>some person in the media could have asked the question and dug in deeper</p>
<p>around the connections between Alameda and FTX for the last 24 months.</p>
<p>I had no diligence at a venture firm.</p>
<p>At no point could any person have asked these questions and found ex-employees</p>
<p>and said,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>are there any unseemly connections here between FTX and Alameda?</p>
<p>There was no disgruntled employee.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>every company has disgruntled employee whistleblowers,</p>
<p>but here where there was billions of dollars being made by tens of people,</p>
<p>not a single person who felt on the outs said anything.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>he was also giving millions of dollars to press outlets in donations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because the questions weren&rsquo;t asked.</p>
<p>And then this kid paid hush money to the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question of you guys.</p>
<p>Do you think that it&rsquo;s the media&rsquo;s responsibility in this context?</p>
<p>Or do you think that there should have been a regulatory authority that had</p>
<p>oversight of this business?</p>
<p>Like there is for every bank and every trading operation in the United States.</p>
<p>And every one of those businesses has a compliance officer chicken and has</p>
<p>regulators up the wazoo,</p>
<p>making sure that customers are kept safe and protected.</p>
<p>Or do we think that that should,</p>
<p>should offshore vehicles be allowed like this?</p>
<p>That allow people to operate?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reasonable question,</p>
<p>but there was a chicken and egg question.</p>
<p>We were all standing around holding our hands while the CFTC and the SEC were</p>
<p>fighting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something that consumers can be expected to adjudicate.</p>
<p>So yes,</p>
<p>we should have legislation that clearly defines all of this,</p>
<p>but there were enough parameters that created regulatory frameworks where a</p>
<p>bunch of good actors did operate in them and are continuing to do so like</p>
<p>Coinbase.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think this is a regulatory issue.</p>
<p>I think that if you believe there are people who are supposed to forensically</p>
<p>examine things and get to the bottom of things and ask hard questions,</p>
<p>those people did none of that here.</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s even more worrisome is what they&rsquo;re showing is now with an massive</p>
<p>amount of data that shows that you could ask hard questions they don&rsquo;t care to</p>
<p>because it makes them look bad.</p>
<p>I disagree with this.</p>
<p>I think regulators failed here because they have been reactive to crypto.</p>
<p>They have not been proactive and they have not been clear with the crypto</p>
<p>community that what they were doing was illegal and they should have put the</p>
<p>regulations in quicker and they&rsquo;re playing catch up.</p>
<p>But all three groups failed.</p>
<p>The media failed,</p>
<p>the regulators failed and VCs failed.</p>
<p>Capital allocators failed.</p>
<p>I apparently to do diligence here and install proper governance.</p>
<p>You cannot put a company like this,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>in business with billions of dollars and have no board of directors or he,</p>
<p>or he lied to them.</p>
<p>My point is that while regulators are basically fighting a territorial turf</p>
<p>war,</p>
<p>okay,</p>
<p>the media could have still done their job.</p>
<p>They chose not to.</p>
<p>Guys,</p>
<p>it was worse than that because not only,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a case where the sec failed to exercise any oversight of him or</p>
<p>dig into any of these questions.</p>
<p>He was in the room with them crafting the next set of regulations.</p>
<p>He was working on the regulations that you&rsquo;re talking about that are</p>
<p>supposedly needed,</p>
<p>breaking them.</p>
<p>They let the Fox in the hen house.</p>
<p>He was going to craft a,</p>
<p>a new type of regulatory license for these types of exchanges with the result</p>
<p>that he was going to get one.</p>
<p>And some of his competitors weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>this was one of the things that triggered CZ to basically,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>do what he did,</p>
<p>which is basically that SPF was trying to get a Binance and,</p>
<p>and competitors like that band while SPF would be one of the sole people to</p>
<p>get the license.</p>
<p>By the way,</p>
<p>he was working with the regulators.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jason,</p>
<p>you just said something derogatory towards CZ.</p>
<p>He rug pulled them.</p>
<p>Did he do that?</p>
<p>Or did he actually expose the fraud?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean by rug pulling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He was partners with him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what rug pull means,</p>
<p>Jason.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>he was partners with him and then he realized he was weak and that he was</p>
<p>doing some stuff that was shady and he decided he would eliminate a partner</p>
<p>who was creating regulation.</p>
<p>As Zach said,</p>
<p>whatever you want to say,</p>
<p>he knifed him.</p>
<p>All he did was indicate a desire to liquidate his position in a token that</p>
<p>was supposedly perfectly liquid.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically,</p>
<p>that caused the,</p>
<p>everything to unravel.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But these were partners,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>these were deep business partners.</p>
<p>And they were partners.</p>
<p>They were collaborating on these tokens together.</p>
<p>So they weren&rsquo;t competitors.</p>
<p>No,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Jason,</p>
<p>like part of the big loan that,</p>
<p>that initiated all of this stuff like a year and a half ago was to buy FTX</p>
<p>off the cap table.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>this,</p>
<p>all I&rsquo;m saying is like you used words and your framing of a guy,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s built a business is like,</p>
<p>he is this nefarious bad actor.</p>
<p>Binance was the first investor.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>but,</p>
<p>but David&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>All the guy did,</p>
<p>as far as we can tell right now is tweet,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m selling this token because I don&rsquo;t believe in the capital structure of</p>
<p>this entity.</p>
<p>And he got those tokens by being bought out of the cap table.</p>
<p>I know he was partners with them.</p>
<p>So if,</p>
<p>if you,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t like rug pulled,</p>
<p>how about backstage business partners?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not partners.</p>
<p>You still don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>They,</p>
<p>he was the first investor.</p>
<p>So to do this to a company,</p>
<p>you were,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>no.</p>
<p>And part of the consideration,</p>
<p>hold on.</p>
<p>Part of the consideration were these tokens,</p>
<p>these FT tokens.</p>
<p>Jason,</p>
<p>when you,</p>
<p>when Uber went public.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you got distributed stock.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you distribute and sell Uber at any point?</p>
<p>Previous to that?</p>
<p>I had,</p>
<p>I sold some Tomas.</p>
<p>No,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking you a question when Uber went public and you got distributed from Uber,</p>
<p>your stock.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve never sold a single share of Uber.</p>
<p>Not since it&rsquo;s public.</p>
<p>No,</p>
<p>I sold it before.</p>
<p>I tried markets.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t make Jason a partner of Uber.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just a stockholder.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is slightly different,</p>
<p>I think,</p>
<p>but okay,</p>
<p>fine.</p>
<p>You guys,</p>
<p>if you guys want to consider,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>he was the first investor in the company.</p>
<p>That might&rsquo;ve been a historical situation,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They were competitors.</p>
<p>Okay,</p>
<p>fine.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>they became competitors.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>to Tomas point about this rug pulling language,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re getting kind of down a rabbit hole here,</p>
<p>but CZ,</p>
<p>CZ did perform a service in this sense.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>SBF claims that 4 billion more was about to come in.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t believe that sounds like bullshit to me,</p>
<p>but if it is true,</p>
<p>that would have been a bad thing.</p>
<p>The more money that came in to that operation,</p>
<p>SBF proved that he was a very poor custodian of customer funds.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defending SBF,</p>
<p>but the longer this went on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just highlighting the language that you use is sort of like,</p>
<p>again,</p>
<p>part of that establishment elite narrative.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just questioning,</p>
<p>you should maybe steal man.</p>
<p>Take a second to just steal man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A more dispassionate view,</p>
<p>which is here&rsquo;s a counterparty.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who,</p>
<p>when he left the cap table was given half cash,</p>
<p>half tokens.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And he decided to sell his tokens.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And tweet it publicly and cause a run on the bank.</p>
<p>So it was not a run on the bank.</p>
<p>There was no bank.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the bank.</p>
<p>This run on the bank language.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is something,</p>
<p>this was in the semaphore coverage.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>He did it publicly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll steal man.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>no.</p>
<p>These tokens are worthless.</p>
<p>I need to liquidate them as fast as possible,</p>
<p>but why would you do that publicly?</p>
<p>Why would you do it privately?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re about to move the market.</p>
<p>He wanted to move the market to zero.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s letting people know why,</p>
<p>why he wanted to kill his competitor.</p>
<p>As Chamath was just saying,</p>
<p>he wanted to kill his competitor.</p>
<p>He was trying to kill him.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say he was trying to do that.</p>
<p>We got,</p>
<p>we got to back up here because I think we&rsquo;ve done a lot of like 30,000 foot</p>
<p>like lessons and like takeaways from this whole thing,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t really established what it is that SBF did wrong.</p>
<p>So I think we need to sort of take a second to unmodify the waters.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And part of that,</p>
<p>I think we should start with this idea of a run on the bank because the</p>
<p>favorite,</p>
<p>the press you&rsquo;ve been writing puff pieces about SBF,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say mainly semaphore,</p>
<p>which he was a big donor to.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been trying to frame it as a run on the bank.</p>
<p>And then that implies that it&rsquo;s not really his fault.</p>
<p>It could happen to anybody.</p>
<p>Lots of banks have had this problem.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not a bank banks actually have the legal right under certain</p>
<p>conditions to take customer deposits and loan them out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They did not,</p>
<p>their terms of use did not allow that as Stephanopoulos pointed out.</p>
<p>SBF&rsquo;s answer to that was,</p>
<p>well,</p>
<p>we had this like margin account program.</p>
<p>There were other provisions,</p>
<p>other terms of use,</p>
<p>but most of the customers who lost money,</p>
<p>the vast majority did not opt into that program.</p>
<p>They never agreed to that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s point number one point.</p>
<p>Number two is I think we need to,</p>
<p>to look at this language of margin account.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>SBFs explanation of how customer money was siphoned off for his own</p>
<p>personal use.</p>
<p>I eat to Alameda is that Alameda had a margin account.</p>
<p>So I think we could perform a service here for the customer.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>and you guys understand this really well,</p>
<p>the way that a margin account works is the following.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Cause I think some of us have them set up with investment banks.</p>
<p>You go to an investment bank,</p>
<p>say Morgan Stanley and you over you post collateral.</p>
<p>You actually over collateralized.</p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<p>you might take a hundred million dollars and put into your bank account.</p>
<p>And you say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna put $100,000 into your bank account.</p>
<p>So you could go to a bank and say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put $100,000 into my bank account.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>you might take a hundred million dollars of stock posted at the investment bank.</p>
<p>And then they will let you loan a certain percentage,</p>
<p>nowhere near a hundred percent,</p>
<p>maybe 50%.</p>
<p>If you have a very,</p>
<p>very liquid security,</p>
<p>you may get 50% coverage,</p>
<p>which means if you posted a hundred million dollars,</p>
<p>you could get a $50 million loan.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you have a hundred million in Amazon stock.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re some Amazon VP,</p>
<p>you can get 50 million loans.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a private asset,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s anywhere as high as 30%,</p>
<p>35%.</p>
<p>But typically it&rsquo;s about 25%.</p>
<p>My expectation is in a liquid token like this,</p>
<p>would have basically gotten five or 10% coverage ratio at the best of it.</p>
<p>And then what happens is you have these maintenance values.</p>
<p>So if all of a sudden the value of these entities multiplied by that</p>
<p>percentage that you&rsquo;re allowed to loan falls below,</p>
<p>you have to post money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how a margin account works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>there is no free lunch in that.</p>
<p>Yes,</p>
<p>exactly.</p>
<p>Let me say quite simply,</p>
<p>very simply what I,</p>
<p>it appears this guy did.</p>
<p>He took customer deposits in us dollars.</p>
<p>He then converted those dollars into some other asset.</p>
<p>And he had a mark on that asset.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it a dollar,</p>
<p>a token.</p>
<p>And then those dollars were moved to somewhere else.</p>
<p>No,</p>
<p>this is someone transferred in some other token.</p>
<p>Listen,</p>
<p>we need to finish the explainer around the margin account.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because what SPF did is this,</p>
<p>he took customer deposits,</p>
<p>gave them to himself.</p>
<p>Just be clear.</p>
<p>No,</p>
<p>he gave up.</p>
<p>He took customer deposits in us dollars.</p>
<p>They were wired in.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>He took those dollars out and he put a fake token in and he called it</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>therefore he said the balance sheet is good,</p>
<p>but the value of that token,</p>
<p>it turns out isn&rsquo;t a dollar it&rsquo;s 10 cents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It was his,</p>
<p>it was sort of his made up token that,</p>
<p>that he,</p>
<p>that he tightly controlled the trading of and,</p>
<p>and artificially prompted the price.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>but,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just the fact that his collateral was no good.</p>
<p>It was also the fact that,</p>
<p>and this is from the bankruptcy filing by the,</p>
<p>the new,</p>
<p>the Enron trustee guy.</p>
<p>He specifically said that Alameda,</p>
<p>unlike every other margin account on the platform had the auto</p>
<p>liquidation provisions turned off.</p>
<p>So wait,</p>
<p>we have to finish the thought around how margin works.</p>
<p>So like Tomas said,</p>
<p>you over post collateral.</p>
<p>And if the value of that collateral goes down or the,</p>
<p>the,</p>
<p>the,</p>
<p>the position,</p>
<p>your trading account,</p>
<p>the value of that goes down,</p>
<p>you either have to post more collateral or they will actually liquidate</p>
<p>your collateral to pay off the loan.</p>
<p>So Morgan Stanley will never lose money on a margin account.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Like the whole point is because they don&rsquo;t make money on it.</p>
<p>They loan you the money at like,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>a few percent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like very cheap.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Loan LIBOR plus.</p>
<p>So yeah,</p>
<p>exactly.</p>
<p>That is not a risk account to them.</p>
<p>And so in the,</p>
<p>in the example,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s use an example.</p>
<p>In the,</p>
<p>in the case of the VP at Amazon,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got a hundred million in Amazon,</p>
<p>they have a $50 million loan.</p>
<p>If Amazon loses half its value,</p>
<p>then that triggers the automatic selling of Amazon shares to get it</p>
<p>back down to 50% coverage.</p>
<p>So now you have to sell 25 million of Amazon shares.</p>
<p>If the full 50 million was pulled down to get back down to 25 to 50%</p>
<p>leverage.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t wait until like Amazon stock is at the exact level where</p>
<p>now the collateral equals a hundred percent of the loan.</p>
<p>They will keep that 50% loan to value and they will liquidate you,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>and by the way,</p>
<p>you can lose your entire amount,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>this is why I&rsquo;m trading a margin is so risky is that you can get wiped</p>
<p>out,</p>
<p>quickly with a small move down because they are the custodians of that</p>
<p>Amazon stock.</p>
<p>They are holding it for you now,</p>
<p>and they have the right to sell it to cover your margin.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that governor,</p>
<p>that basic tenant,</p>
<p>that basic safety control was turned off by Alameda and it&rsquo;s even more</p>
<p>sinister.</p>
<p>Alameda controlled like 90 or 95% of these FTT tokens and was owned by</p>
<p>Sam Bankman fraud.</p>
<p>So he owned that company.</p>
<p>Then he claims he had no operating position in it.</p>
<p>What should have happened is with that collateral is that as the value of</p>
<p>their position was going down and,</p>
<p>or as the value of the collateral was going down,</p>
<p>it should have been liquidated to pay off the margin loan.</p>
<p>And that did not happen.</p>
<p>And the reason it didn&rsquo;t happen is that Alameda got a special exception on</p>
<p>the platform to turn off auto liquidation.</p>
<p>Therefore it was never a margin account.</p>
<p>If even if it was a margin account,</p>
<p>okay.</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>and FTX somehow misadministered the margin account.</p>
<p>It should never have taken other customers deposits and use them to pay back</p>
<p>that money.</p>
<p>What should have happened is if FTX was going to lose money on a margin</p>
<p>account,</p>
<p>that would hit the FTX corporate treasury.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And when the FTX corporate treasury ran out,</p>
<p>the company files for bankruptcy then,</p>
<p>and then all the other customers hold on,</p>
<p>their account is still there.</p>
<p>Their money is there in segregated accounts and in bankruptcy,</p>
<p>they get their money back.</p>
<p>The idea that a margin account could ever cause another customer to lose money</p>
<p>that like,</p>
<p>whatever that is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a margin.</p>
<p>There was a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great article.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great article.</p>
<p>This one was a journalist that did his job properly.</p>
<p>His name is David Z.</p>
<p>Morris.</p>
<p>He wrote an article in coin desk that summed up for anybody that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interested,</p>
<p>all of the actual fraud and all of the crimes that were committed in</p>
<p>excruciating detail.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s so sad about all these interviews in this press tour is if</p>
<p>anybody would just read this article,</p>
<p>you can construct the right questions to ask this guy just based on this</p>
<p>one article.</p>
<p>But the point I wanted to make is that one of the most interesting</p>
<p>insights was these guys had lost an enormous amount of money already in</p>
<p>calendar year 21.</p>
<p>And so this is what&rsquo;s so crazy,</p>
<p>Jason,</p>
<p>about,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>you using language like rug pulling and like,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>actually,</p>
<p>actually trying to like be clear,</p>
<p>like you guys are giving this guy a hall pass.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not getting any,</p>
<p>any industrious reporter could have found an employee who said,</p>
<p>wait a minute,</p>
<p>we just blew a $3 billion hole in our balance sheet and calendar year</p>
<p>21,</p>
<p>20.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re sitting here at the end of 22.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>I need to respond.</p>
<p>I am not giving him a pass.</p>
<p>And for you to blame journalists who are reflecting the crime and not</p>
<p>putting any light on VCs and the capital allocators who made this</p>
<p>investment and who did no diligence and now put governance in it is the</p>
<p>height of arrogance.</p>
<p>Shama.</p>
<p>This is not the presses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not doing that.</p>
<p>This is the VCs.</p>
<p>This is the capital allocators fault.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re blaming the people who are telling the story after the crime.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re covering the story.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t handle the truth.</p>
<p>Jason,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re covering the story.</p>
<p>Can I get in here?</p>
<p>Can I get in here?</p>
<p>All right,</p>
<p>listen,</p>
<p>Jason,</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re just saying that somehow you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re letting SBF off the hook.</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t want to let SBF.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>you are letting the press off the hook.</p>
<p>And the reason why,</p>
<p>hold on a second.</p>
<p>The reason why you&rsquo;re using this inaccurate language like rug pulling and</p>
<p>run on the bank when there was no run and there was no bank is because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been infected by this language that the media has inserted into the</p>
<p>discourse.</p>
<p>The media,</p>
<p>listen,</p>
<p>hold on a second.</p>
<p>Investors may have got it wrong last year.</p>
<p>Investors may have got it wrong when they did that last round,</p>
<p>but I think investors now understand what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>but the media is still covering for SBF by miss explaining what</p>
<p>happened.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Give me a percentage tax of who&rsquo;s to blame here.</p>
<p>VCs who invested and didn&rsquo;t set up any governance regulators who did not</p>
<p>set rules around crypto.</p>
<p>And then three,</p>
<p>the media,</p>
<p>what percentage out of a hundred percent is the investors,</p>
<p>the regulators and the press go three numbers.</p>
<p>I would say that before the fraud got exposed,</p>
<p>one third,</p>
<p>one third,</p>
<p>one third,</p>
<p>one third each before the fraud got exposed,</p>
<p>but they were all jointly and severally liable.</p>
<p>But after the fraud has been exposed,</p>
<p>no investor is still defending SBF.</p>
<p>But I think that the investors who were swindled by him,</p>
<p>they feel bad about it.</p>
<p>So 30,</p>
<p>30,</p>
<p>30 is absurd.</p>
<p>The press had no way to know the fraud was going on.</p>
<p>Just like the VCs with the money.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Jason,</p>
<p>are you stupid?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not your stupid journalist that exposed the fraud at Theranos.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the guy that went and did all the work.</p>
<p>John Kerry,</p>
<p>you should be celebrated.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>John Kerry,</p>
<p>you went and found this thing when nobody,</p>
<p>when everybody else was like,</p>
<p>this is perfect.</p>
<p>It meets all of our priors.</p>
<p>Let me finish,</p>
<p>please.</p>
<p>It meets all of our priors.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>And so John Kerry was like,</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t pass the smell test to me.</p>
<p>Let me go do some work.</p>
<p>And he pulled one little string.</p>
<p>And over the course of 18 months,</p>
<p>he exposed the whole bloody thing.</p>
<p>So hold on a second.</p>
<p>So what is incredible to me is that it was possible to expose this thing before.</p>
<p>Nobody did.</p>
<p>I agree with David.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about equal responsibility before,</p>
<p>but afterwards,</p>
<p>the bulk of the responsibilities now sits with regulators to clean it up and</p>
<p>journalists to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And now may I respond to that?</p>
<p>Since you call me stupid,</p>
<p>you are delusional.</p>
<p>Number one,</p>
<p>every one of those investors in Theranos could have taken a fucking blood test</p>
<p>at two different places like Jean-Louis Garcia did and write a blog post and</p>
<p>prove that Theranos didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And they withheld disbelief investors putting in a hundred million dollars,</p>
<p>including Rupert Murdoch,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even take a fucking blood test or tell one of their diligence teams to</p>
<p>do it.</p>
<p>The same thing happened here with the investors in FTX.</p>
<p>They did zero diligence.</p>
<p>They set up zero governance.</p>
<p>This was a failure of the investors and the governance for 99% of the problem.</p>
<p>And then regulators should have caught it.</p>
<p>And the regulators,</p>
<p>in fact,</p>
<p>did catch Theranos.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re completely wrong,</p>
<p>Chamath.</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>the journalists come in after the fraud is happening.</p>
<p>The investors and governance is responsible for stopping these things.</p>
<p>FTX was a failure of governance and investors.</p>
<p>And so was Theranos.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re completely wrong.</p>
<p>The question is post,</p>
<p>post exposure.</p>
<p>Why are you guys obsessed with post?</p>
<p>How about avoiding these things?</p>
<p>You guys are blaming.</p>
<p>Because the story is ongoing.</p>
<p>Because the story is ongoing.</p>
<p>Journalists for something that is capital allocators responsibility.</p>
<p>It is our responsibility to do diligence.</p>
<p>It is our responsibility to create a board of directors that checks on</p>
<p>Elizabeth Holmes and Sam.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t disagree.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I disagree with that.</p>
<p>Just call me stupid.</p>
<p>You just call me stupid for pointing out something that you refuse to</p>
<p>accept.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the biggest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the older brother.</p>
<p>You guys are giving a pass to the investors.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing your impression again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing Fredo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing Fredo.</p>
<p>You guys are being absurd.</p>
<p>This is why people say that we&rsquo;re delusional on this podcast.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t call him dumb.</p>
<p>The reason people say we&rsquo;re delusional is that we won&rsquo;t take acceptance of</p>
<p>this issue.</p>
<p>Like the guy you can&rsquo;t call dumb.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>He loses it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going berserk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going berserk.</p>
<p>You guys have a blind spot.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t call me dumb.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to defend any single one of those investors.</p>
<p>I think that they did a horrible job too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great episode.</p>
<p>But the reality is I think that if you think that you can,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your decision to defend the mainstream media.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defending them.</p>
<p>No, you are.</p>
<p>You said they have no responsibility.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m blaming the VCs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>The culpability is with the investor class that has not had proper</p>
<p>governance and diligence.</p>
<p>Jason, how many articles have been written excoriating them?</p>
<p>Yeah, some.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>They look like fools.</p>
<p>Show me the Washington Post New York Times that&rsquo;s like digging in to</p>
<p>that malfeasance or that lack of oversight and holding them</p>
<p>accountable in a way that you feel exposes this problem to create</p>
<p>change.</p>
<p>Well, if we look at Theranos, those people who invested,</p>
<p>including Draper and&hellip;</p>
<p>Just show me the examples.</p>
<p>&hellip;Rupert Murdoch, they really went after them for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about here?</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal, one day ago,</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital apologizes to its fund investors for FTX loss.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Venture capital firm tells fund investors that&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard hitting.</p>
<p>&hellip;it will improve due diligence on future investments after a</p>
<p>hundred million loss.</p>
<p>They really got them.</p>
<p>They really got them.</p>
<p>Let me read you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cover story in the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to read you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to read you a sentence from the New York Times coverage of</p>
<p>SBF.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m not defending that.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Sam Banquet-Freed is neither a visionary nor a criminal mastermind.</p>
<p>He is a human who made the same poor choice that generations of money</p>
<p>managers have made before him.</p>
<p>Are you effing kidding me?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defending them.</p>
<p>That was the New York Times coverage.</p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p>I am not defending them.</p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p>I just called Andrew Orton in a suit.</p>
<p>And then Semaphore, who was on the take,</p>
<p>who received millions of dollars worth of money&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re on the payroll.</p>
<p>Yes, they&rsquo;re on the payroll.</p>
<p>&hellip;said it was a run on the bank.</p>
<p>How much did they get?</p>
<p>Five million?</p>
<p>Now, where is their apology?</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Where is their apology?</p>
<p>Sequoia has apologized.</p>
<p>Where is their apology?</p>
<p>Oh, it has to come.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defending the press.</p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p>No, you are.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>No, I am not.</p>
<p>I am literally telling you that the New York Times has been asleep at the</p>
<p>wheel and throwing&hellip;</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the New York Times apology?</p>
<p>The press is always demanding an apology from everybody else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m agreeing with you.</p>
<p>The press has done a shit job.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>The press is always demanding&hellip;</p>
<p>The press is so incompetent on this.</p>
<p>The Twitter spaces yesterday did a better job of trying to ask questions</p>
<p>and getting to the truth than a single journalist has done or the</p>
<p>collective body of all of journalists.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Literally, randos on Twitter spaces did a better job than Sorkin.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why no one trusts the press, Jason.</p>
<p>First of all, they have an agenda.</p>
<p>I am in agreement.</p>
<p>But second of all, when they make a mistake, they never admit it.</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the last time they did an apology or retraction?</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the last time they did what Sequoia did?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And they need to apologize about New York Times.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even point to it.</p>
<p>I am in agreement with you on that.</p>
<p>But I think we have to first say, and this is where you guys have a</p>
<p>blind spot, is what is the responsibility of capital allocators and</p>
<p>governance and regulators?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one, two, three.</p>
<p>Our industry is responsible for setting up proper governance.</p>
<p>The regulators are responsible for making sure that scientific claims</p>
<p>are backed up.</p>
<p>And then press is a distant third.</p>
<p>You know who I think is responsible?</p>
<p>SVF.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>One, two, and three.</p>
<p>And then we can talk about four, five, and six.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Four, five, and six.</p>
<p>Capital allocators, regulators, the press, a distant sixth.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go on to China.</p>
<p>God, it&rsquo;s so spicy today in here.</p>
<p>God, it&rsquo;s so hot.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think when we attack the mainstream media, Jason feels a</p>
<p>little tinge of like insecurity and illegitimacy because he were a</p>
<p>journalist.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I think that you have an incredibly romantic view of the craft as you</p>
<p>practiced it back then, which I think was full of integrity.</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I think that you don&rsquo;t adequately realize how massively the industry</p>
<p>has changed in the last 20 years since you&rsquo;ve become an investor.</p>
<p>I realize it more than you do.</p>
<p>I fully realize that the media has absolutely become biased.</p>
<p>Are they corrupt?</p>
<p>And they have lost, in some cases, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re taking money from SVF and then giving him-</p>
<p>Are they blinded?</p>
<p>Are they biased?</p>
<p>They are corrupt if they are taking money from SVF and then giving</p>
<p>him Kigalov coverage.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>That is the definition of corruption in my mind.</p>
<p>What is it called when you don&rsquo;t take money necessarily like the</p>
<p>New York Times and still treat them with kid gloves?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>It is extreme bias.</p>
<p>And the New York Times became extremely biased.</p>
<p>Why do you think that bias exists?</p>
<p>They were always left-leaning, but I can tell you why.</p>
<p>They, when Trump came in, a generation of new journalists became</p>
<p>activist journalists.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want to tell stories and take it straight down the middle</p>
<p>and let the facts tell the story and let the audience make their own</p>
<p>decision.</p>
<p>They felt an existential risk when Trump came into office.</p>
<p>They got Trump derangement syndrome.</p>
<p>They picked a side like MSNBC and Fox did.</p>
<p>And the business model became, for the New York Times, pick a side</p>
<p>and get the subscribers.</p>
<p>It was a deliberate, cynical choice on the New York Times part to go</p>
<p>full MSNBC or full Fox, the two extremes in mainstream media, in</p>
<p>order to get the subs.</p>
<p>And they literally rallied the troops there to do anti-tech, anti-Trump</p>
<p>coverage.</p>
<p>And they became activists.</p>
<p>And when journalists become activists, they are no longer journalists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re activists or commentators.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being presented as journalism when in fact it&rsquo;s activism.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So just shout out to Matt Taibbi, who just did a monk debate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s well said by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, on this very topic.</p>
<p>And he has a great, great sub stack, basically saying what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying, Jason.</p>
<p>And the best quote is the story is no longer the boss.</p>
<p>Instead, we sell narrative.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a lifelong journalist.</p>
<p>His father was a lifelong journalist, and he understands the way the</p>
<p>business has changed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And this is why independent media, whether it&rsquo;s sub stacks, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s call-in shows, whether it&rsquo;s all-in podcasts or other podcasts,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, whoever it is, independent voices are now</p>
<p>what consumers are seeking out because they can sense the bias.</p>
<p>They know Rachel Maddow and Tucker have an axe to grind, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>left and right.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t expect the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall</p>
<p>Street Journal to, you know, they knew they were leaning.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t expect them to pick a side.</p>
<p>Do you think we should cancel if folks, do you think folks are better</p>
<p>off keeping their New York Times subscription or replacing that New</p>
<p>York Times subscription with a basket of sub stacks?</p>
<p>Yeah, you answered your own question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the latter.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re on your own as a consumer now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to, and I think this podcast and the nuance we</p>
<p>have, shout out to Freeberg for nuance.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve done on this podcast is to explain to people.</p>
<p>Freeberg&rsquo;s not the only one with nuance, Jake.</p>
<p>Nobody would describe David Sachs with the word nuance.</p>
<p>What, he&rsquo;s the nuance department on this podcast?</p>
<p>What am I?</p>
<p>100% he is, but you would know that because you leave when science</p>
<p>quarter starts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the truth department, okay?</p>
<p>Sometimes nuance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re truth bombs.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the truth department.</p>
<p>You can take the both sides department.</p>
<p>The point is, consumers need to become extremely literate, and they</p>
<p>have to do their own search for truth in today&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, they shouldn&rsquo;t trust New York Times.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t trust us.</p>
<p>They should trust themselves.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t trust necessarily the CDC or, you know, the world</p>
<p>health organization.</p>
<p>They should trust themselves and come up with their own process for</p>
<p>figuring out the truth in the middle of this mess.</p>
<p>By the way, this is a good reflection on what&rsquo;s happened with the rest</p>
<p>of media with respect to the creator class where, right.</p>
<p>It used to be the movie studios and, you know, a handful of kind of</p>
<p>aggregated creators that made all of the content of the record labels.</p>
<p>And now, you know, independent artists, independent producers,</p>
<p>independent creators, and now independent journalists are going to</p>
<p>become the bulk of volume that&rsquo;s going to be consumed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a different consumption model, but we&rsquo;ve already seen it</p>
<p>happen.</p>
<p>We saw it happen with movies, and we&rsquo;ve seen this disruption happen</p>
<p>across all of these other media classes, journalism, and what we call</p>
<p>the press is very likely going to be kind of that next layer of</p>
<p>disruption.</p>
<p>I would trust having a conversation with you about science topics over</p>
<p>reading a science article.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>You know, in the New York Times or Wall Street Journal, if I&rsquo;m being</p>
<p>honest, I would much prefer to talk to you about it.</p>
<p>And if it was markets, I&rsquo;d rather talk to Chamath.</p>
<p>And if it was SaaS, I would talk to Sachs or operating a company.</p>
<p>Speaking of operating a company.</p>
<p>Or politics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s about having unique inside insight, right?</p>
<p>Like, that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is that the people who are the professionals that</p>
<p>have the knowledge and the touch points are also becoming journalists in</p>
<p>the sense that they&rsquo;re also becoming speakers of their truth.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think Twitter is a good enabling platform for this.</p>
<p>We see it on YouTube where like scientists are putting out their own</p>
<p>videos.</p>
<p>Or market actors like people that are traders in the market go out and</p>
<p>they put out their own videos.</p>
<p>And they put out their own podcast.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re probably a good reflection of that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In the sense that like we are the actors in the market.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not just the independent observer that has kind of a surface</p>
<p>level view.</p>
<p>We have the depth to be able to talk about the things that we choose to</p>
<p>talk about.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where consumers find value and will continue to find</p>
<p>value in terms of who the journalist or speaker is that they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>start to trust for their information.</p>
<p>I had.</p>
<p>I saw that interview you did with newcomer.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I saw that coverage.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He speaks a lot about the this phenomenon of going direct.</p>
<p>And of course he&rsquo;s against it.</p>
<p>Now he interprets going to direct as an attempt by newsmakers to avoid</p>
<p>answering tough questions or take tough questions.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s ridiculous because for example,</p>
<p>I go on CNBC all the time.</p>
<p>I go on Emily Ching and Bloomberg all the time.</p>
<p>I submit to like really tough questions.</p>
<p>I actually liked those sort of sparring sessions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I did hard talk this week.</p>
<p>Have you ever done that?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s going on is we have expertise.</p>
<p>We want to communicate them.</p>
<p>And we do feel like the media has become a very unreliable narrator.</p>
<p>There is too much bias and sloppiness.</p>
<p>Not all of it is agenda.</p>
<p>Some of it&rsquo;s just pure sloppiness.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t go direct.</p>
<p>And people want to hear from us.</p>
<p>The audience wants to hear from us.</p>
<p>Look at Draymond.</p>
<p>Look at Draymond and the success he&rsquo;s had with his podcast.</p>
<p>No basketball player has ever gone direct and created content like</p>
<p>Draymond&rsquo;s created.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s totally changed the game.</p>
<p>And he was so clear.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, we are, I am the media now.</p>
<p>JJ read it.</p>
<p>You know, Old Man and the Three.</p>
<p>Amazing, amazing podcast.</p>
<p>I was going to tell you guys a story.</p>
<p>So I was in the Middle East last week, or this week, sorry.</p>
<p>And I had this crazy experience where I was trying to understand what</p>
<p>was going on in China.</p>
<p>And so I started on CNN.</p>
<p>And the whole thing was the propaganda machine around a democratic revolt,</p>
<p>you know, pushing for democracy and trying to depose Xi.</p>
<p>Then I moved to Al Arabiya.</p>
<p>So one channel up, I went from channel 10 to channel 11.</p>
<p>And instead, what they were actually doing was interviewing people on the</p>
<p>ground.</p>
<p>And what they were talking about was literally how these PCR tests have</p>
<p>become far too burdensome.</p>
<p>And they just wanted it to end and more reasonable restrictions to get in</p>
<p>and out of quarantine.</p>
<p>Then I went from there to BBC.</p>
<p>And in BBC, they had a China scholar who was talking about how for decades</p>
<p>actually the Communist Party supports local level protests and</p>
<p>demonstrations because they&rsquo;ve realized that it is a part of their</p>
<p>political system to make sure that people feel like they have a say.</p>
<p>And I was, like, taking a step back.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m, like, if you listen to the U.S. narrative and even Jason, like,</p>
<p>in our group chat, people fomenting for, like, revolution.</p>
<p>And this is Tiananmen 2.0.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m, like, well, I&rsquo;m reading two other channels that tell us a</p>
<p>completely different set of things.</p>
<p>And I just thought, man, people just really fit the data to fit their bias.</p>
<p>Yeah, we are projecting.</p>
<p>We want to see a revolution in China.</p>
<p>The people in China want to have their lives back.</p>
<p>Well, I would love to see more democracy in the world.</p>
<p>Yes, guilty as charged.</p>
<p>I would like to see people be more free in the world.</p>
<p>Dictator.</p>
<p>I think most people just want to improve their condition.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think people are as tied up on the philosophy of the government</p>
<p>as they are about improving their condition.</p>
<p>And as long as their condition is improving, they&rsquo;re willing to put up</p>
<p>with any form of government.</p>
<p>History shows that.</p>
<p>By the way, the conditions in China have improved better than everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the last.</p>
<p>Better than anyone.</p>
<p>500 million people out of abject poverty.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the great success of engagement.</p>
<p>Isolationism would not have created that amazing outcome.</p>
<p>500 million people going out of abject.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>To Apple building factories.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Apple building factories is what I&rsquo;m referring to.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, fine.</p>
<p>If they want to build something over there, I guess that&rsquo;s better than</p>
<p>us throwing out open our markets and giving China MFN status to destroy</p>
<p>American manufacturing and build up their economy so they can become a</p>
<p>peer competitor to the United States.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the balance of engagement, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>If you engage too much, you give everything up.</p>
<p>Which of the current Republican agenda do you disagree with most strongly?</p>
<p>Just as an aside.</p>
<p>Well, most Republicans are in favor of our Ukraine policy.</p>
<p>This sort of unlimited appropriation of weapons and aid to them.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you disagree with immigration policy of Republicans and Democrats?</p>
<p>Well, I have a more nuanced position on immigration, which is I think we need</p>
<p>to have a border and it can&rsquo;t be just like an open border, which is the</p>
<p>de facto policy we have now.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I do think that we should have H1B visas and we want</p>
<p>to, like Jamal said, we want to be an all-star team for the world.</p>
<p>We want to have the best people want to come here.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>And then, you know, look, I think that I was happy to see the marriage</p>
<p>equality bill finally passed the Senate.</p>
<p>Yes, they did get about a dozen Republicans voted for it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the majority, unfortunately.</p>
<p>You know, look on what I would categorize as the old social issues, you</p>
<p>know, like a marriage, like cannabis legalization.</p>
<p>I was on the liberal side.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, you know, banning abortion.</p>
<p>Entirely a total abolition is going to work for this country.</p>
<p>I think Republicans will lose elections if they insist on that.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re getting that message.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, look, I, I think that I&rsquo;ve always considered myself to</p>
<p>be pretty centrist.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re not a globalist.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t believe in open global markets.</p>
<p>But the US in general, I understand the benefits of free trade, and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think we should be isolationist with respect to trade.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we can be a successful country if we are we isolate</p>
<p>our economy.</p>
<p>So I do want to trade.</p>
<p>However, with China in particular, I think we made a mistake in throwing</p>
<p>open our markets to their products, giving them MFN status while most</p>
<p>favored nation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Enriching them to the point where they became a pure competitor of the</p>
<p>United States.</p>
<p>Now, look, I understand why we made that mistake 20 years ago, because</p>
<p>everybody thought the theory was that if we help China become rich, that</p>
<p>China would inevitably become more democratic and they&rsquo;d be filled with</p>
<p>gratitude towards the United States and they&rsquo;d actually become more, more</p>
<p>hospitable towards us more westernized.</p>
<p>And I think that theory is just proven to be wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, they have not or it&rsquo;s going very slowly.</p>
<p>One or the other.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s own our clips here.</p>
<p>Here is Schmott&rsquo;s prediction from episode 61.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see you on the other side of this quick clip.</p>
<p>My worldwide biggest political winner for 2022 is Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>I think this guy is he&rsquo;s firing on all cylinders, and he is basically</p>
<p>ascendant.</p>
<p>So 2022 marks the first year where he&rsquo;s essentially really ruler for life.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think we really know what he&rsquo;s capable of and what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to do.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just going to play out.</p>
<p>You think he&rsquo;s the biggest political winner, really?</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I think I think it&rsquo;s going to be a he&rsquo;s going to run rough</p>
<p>shot, not just domestically, but also internationally, because you have</p>
<p>to remember, he controls so much of the critical supply chain that the</p>
<p>Western world needs to be.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re completely right.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re completely wrong.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s losing his power.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s scared.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he took out all these CEOs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s consolidating power because he fears that they&rsquo;re going to win too</p>
<p>big and then displace him.</p>
<p>And he has massive real estate problems over there that could blow up at</p>
<p>any moment in time.</p>
<p>He could face a civil war there.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s totally isolated himself.</p>
<p>Civil War.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even have a major country is removing their factories and</p>
<p>removing this dependency there.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>What do they get?</p>
<p>What do they get a riot with?</p>
<p>Did you not see Tiananmen Square?</p>
<p>Did you not see the riots in Hong Kong?</p>
<p>Are you not paying attention to math?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been many riots in China.</p>
<p>They just happen to kill.</p>
<p>Those were crushed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it will be crushed, but he still will have massive amounts</p>
<p>of, I believe, protests.</p>
<p>And yeah, he&rsquo;ll have to kill people.</p>
<p>I think the bigger risk is that China gets better for Xi Jinping, but</p>
<p>worse for everybody else in China.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already worse for all the billionaires over there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse for the tech industry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve now got Evergrande, that whole gigantic debt implosion.</p>
<p>I think there could be contagion from China next year.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Xi&rsquo;s going to lose his grip in any way, but I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s going to have a good year next year.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>
<p>I think all three of us kind of got this right.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You got none of it right.</p>
<p>I said there were going to be riots and they&rsquo;re going to have a recession.</p>
<p>Jason, let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>You said that they would be squashed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>Both things happened.</p>
<p>I actually think I have a pretty decent ability to steel man pretty</p>
<p>concretely the details.</p>
<p>I think that at best, when it comes to things like democracy and your</p>
<p>belief in U.S. exceptionalism in a specific political worldview, at best</p>
<p>you straw man.</p>
<p>And I think that you get very biased without seeing the forest from the</p>
<p>trees.</p>
<p>The reason I said that is not because I&rsquo;m like some huge Xi supporter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to steel man what happens when one individual person</p>
<p>gets anointed leader for life of 1.3 billion people that then controls 20%</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s GDP.</p>
<p>There is no other single human being as powerful as him as of this month.</p>
<p>Can I just say that this show is going to become insufferable if every</p>
<p>time you sort of said something in the past that was sort of correct,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have to replay it.</p>
<p>I was actually playing that one for you.</p>
<p>Sacks.</p>
<p>I think you nailed it.</p>
<p>I was giving that was a softball to you.</p>
<p>I know it every week.</p>
<p>J Cal.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to slow down.</p>
<p>If we play every clip that I got, right.</p>
<p>You guys are asking to pull clips all the time.</p>
<p>I just pulled one clip about China where you nailed it.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Look, I think like, and also look what he did.</p>
<p>King of pull a clip.</p>
<p>The, the Evergrande thing.</p>
<p>Look what he did this week.</p>
<p>They said, okay, you know what?</p>
<p>The real estate industry can now issue secondary stock sales,</p>
<p>raise equity and equitize themselves.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to find a soft landing for the equity part of,</p>
<p>for the real estate industry in China.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re reopening.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, like, I&rsquo;m not sure what we&rsquo;re supposed to comment, but I,</p>
<p>what I will stand by is what I said, which is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have a very clear view about what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>what the substance of these protests are and what people actually want.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re only consuming us media.</p>
<p>And so if you find a way to get a diet from a bunch of different sources</p>
<p>all around the world, you may get a better sense.</p>
<p>I had an accidental window into that by being in a completely different</p>
<p>part of the world this past week,</p>
<p>Freeberg any final thoughts on China and what&rsquo;s going on there before we</p>
<p>move on to chat GPT, your favorite story.</p>
<p>I think one of the things we often miss is that China,</p>
<p>the CCP does have their hand on the</p>
<p>throttle. Like they throttle up and down.</p>
<p>We always think that it&rsquo;s a linear line and that it&rsquo;s super dogmatic and</p>
<p>fixed, but there&rsquo;s certainly responsiveness.</p>
<p>And the release of the lockdowns in Guangzhou and Beijing this week seems to</p>
<p>have been a pretty good indication that when things do get, when,</p>
<p>when things, when the tides do do change leadership,</p>
<p>leadership there seems to respond not always,</p>
<p>but enough to kind of keep things going. So</p>
<p>should they reopen?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 60% of the population or so is vaccinated with obviously</p>
<p>vaccines that maybe aren&rsquo;t as don&rsquo;t have the same efficacy as the ones here</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>Do you think they should open up and just let it rip?</p>
<p>Or do you think they should still try to maintain the zero COVID policy?</p>
<p>Cause that is the debate right now.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the objective?</p>
<p>Cause obviously from the objective of economic growth,</p>
<p>they need to open up and they need to keep their economy working and they need</p>
<p>to keep their labor force engaged or else they&rsquo;re going to continue to suffer.</p>
<p>So if economic growth is the objective,</p>
<p>they need to open up, right?</p>
<p>If the longterm health cost of the nation balanced again,</p>
<p>against that is the calculus that they&rsquo;re kind of weighing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably some more nuance to that. And certainly</p>
<p>my understanding is there may be a precedent setting,</p>
<p>which is, Hey, we&rsquo;ve said that it&rsquo;s a zero COVID policy.</p>
<p>Therefore we have to hold strict to it, hold toe the line.</p>
<p>Else it looks like we&rsquo;re weak. And so there&rsquo;s also this, you know,</p>
<p>maintaining the authority of the CCP objective.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of maybe competing objectives right now.</p>
<p>Certainly don&rsquo;t have a sense of how they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re weighing them all.</p>
<p>But, but I think that once, once all those videos came out this week,</p>
<p>you guys saw them, but people were screaming.</p>
<p>There was an apartment on fire where the doors were locked with steel beams on</p>
<p>the, on the base of the building. At least that&rsquo;s what the video said.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much truth there is to that, but that&rsquo;s what was said.</p>
<p>And clearly people are extremely distraught and unhappy with the conditions of</p>
<p>the lockdown. At some point, enough people with enough loud voices,</p>
<p>you know, something&rsquo;s going to change. I mean,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just remember like the bargain that struck in that country and with all</p>
<p>countries is that, you know,</p>
<p>the citizenry to some extent are willing to tolerate their government so long</p>
<p>as their conditions continue to improve. And there&rsquo;s a bargain,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some bargain that struck.</p>
<p>And as soon as that bargain starts to go south for, for, for the citizenry,</p>
<p>then that, that, that governing entity is at risk.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s what we sort of started to see this week was the</p>
<p>conditions are getting far,</p>
<p>far worse and far less livable for so many people in that country that the</p>
<p>government had to shift.</p>
<p>Do you think Chamath, this COVID strategy,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll move on was basically Xi Jinping wanting to get to that</p>
<p>Congress, his coronation. And now that that&rsquo;s over,</p>
<p>maybe he can change gears and then like I said, I,</p>
<p>my belief is that I have a very poor access to enough data to have a,</p>
<p>to steel man what is actually going on there.</p>
<p>But one explanation could actually be that in the absence of enough hospital</p>
<p>infrastructure and ventilators and a bunch of these other things,</p>
<p>they had to take a pretty severe approach to this disease.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they know or didn&rsquo;t know. Maybe they understood,</p>
<p>you know, the virulence of it.</p>
<p>Maybe that they have a slightly different aging characteristics of their</p>
<p>population. Maybe they genetically responded to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know any of these things enough to tell you, Jason.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the reality is what Freebird says is right,</p>
<p>which is that you cannot grow an economy if people are inside locked in their</p>
<p>apartments.</p>
<p>And it looks like they have decided that that&rsquo;s coming to an end and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to, you know, deconstruct all of these things.</p>
<p>So, you know, the, the, the Chinese growth engine is coming back.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s going to be an important factor economically that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to figure out because it&rsquo;s going to have a huge implication to</p>
<p>American growth and American inflation.</p>
<p>Saks, if, in fact, the China, if the lab league theory is correct,</p>
<p>China might have some insights into this disease that maybe the West didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>maybe that plays into their policy a bit. Any final thoughts here?</p>
<p>Jake,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just surprised to hear that you have a problem with their lockdown policy</p>
<p>over there because aren&rsquo;t they just implementing democratic party orthodoxy?</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t this the policy that Tony Fauci and Barbara Ferrer that, you know,</p>
<p>that all the health experts.</p>
<p>I was not in favor of lockdowns. What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one who had all your mask and had ventilators day one.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the lockdown policy?</p>
<p>Why am I getting this? I&rsquo;m just asking a question as the moderator.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this basically, why am I getting a stray?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this what got into the question? Yes.</p>
<p>I was in favor of if people wanted to stay home, stay home.</p>
<p>And then if people wanted to go out and take the risk, take the risk.</p>
<p>I was always in personal choice.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this what Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan and Gavin Newsom in California</p>
<p>had subscribed to the idea that the way to fight COVID was through lockdowns.</p>
<p>Now, yes,</p>
<p>Newsom had 10 pages of exceptions for his political donors and he didn&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>the police to lock people in apartment buildings.</p>
<p>He may have wanted to, but they didn&rsquo;t actually do that.</p>
<p>But can you really tell me that this lockdown policy has been disavowed by</p>
<p>people like Fauci or by the health authorities like the Barbara Ferrer&rsquo;s of</p>
<p>this world? They still subscribe to this view.</p>
<p>Do they really? Is there anybody doing a lot?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re not able to do it because no one agrees anymore.</p>
<p>But tell me, tell me where anybody,</p>
<p>tell me where any of the health experts who said that lockdowns were the</p>
<p>correct response have repented and disavowed that view.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t been, I haven&rsquo;t been tracking their mea copas,</p>
<p>but you yourself were in favor of lockdowns for a period of time.</p>
<p>Yes, you were. No, you absolutely were. I&rsquo;ll pull the tape.</p>
<p>Mass mandate. No, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I was in favor of a mass mandate.</p>
<p>And I said the mass mandate was the alternative to lockdowns.</p>
<p>Okay. I was saying that by May of 2020.</p>
<p>All right, listen, let&rsquo;s move on to the next thing. I don&rsquo;t represent,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an independent. I don&rsquo;t represent the democratic party.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t represent Fauci. No, you represent mainstream media.</p>
<p>I do not represent mainstream media.</p>
<p>You just said I was an old school journalist who&rsquo;s mortified with where it</p>
<p>is today. I&rsquo;m giving you a hard time. I thought your,</p>
<p>I thought your explanation was fabulous. Oh, thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Obviously, Jake, I&rsquo;m giving you a hard time too.</p>
<p>I know that you were not a big lockdown proponent,</p>
<p>but you understand the point I was making.</p>
<p>There were a lot of proponents in the US.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop making me the democratic spokesperson.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling a lot better after my beer. Let&rsquo;s talk about open AI.</p>
<p>Come on. Let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s talk about open AI.</p>
<p>All right. Open AI is a, a company that builds</p>
<p>artificial intelligence software and platforms.</p>
<p>They have one platform called G P T.</p>
<p>It is on its third version as part of GPT three,</p>
<p>they created chat GPT,</p>
<p>which is a chat interface where you can ask questions to AI.</p>
<p>The results are nothing short of stunning when they hit.</p>
<p>Some of them are a little bit mixed,</p>
<p>but Freeberg has spent the last 48 hours drinking white Russians with Oatly</p>
<p>milk and playing with chat GPT,</p>
<p>including his question to the chat GPT,</p>
<p>which was write a script of Chamath Sachs and Jay Cal talking about the</p>
<p>future of AI in the style of a Quentin Tarantino movie.</p>
<p>And I have to say it was pretty great. The results go ahead.</p>
<p>Freeberg tell us what you discovered.</p>
<p>I think you guys should read this real quick.</p>
<p>We can cut it out if it&rsquo;s stupid, but actually read the script.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I got the Quentin Tarantino part, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it was like impressive, but there&rsquo;s no F bombs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no like Tarantino S dialogue.</p>
<p>They took, they took out all cursing and violent,</p>
<p>cussing and violence from open AI.</p>
<p>That explains it because if this was a Tarantino script,</p>
<p>there would be some choice language.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting. It&rsquo;s like the PG Tarantino script.</p>
<p>No cussing, no violence, no.</p>
<p>Yeah. You do the narrative.</p>
<p>The scene opens on Chamath Palihapitiya, David Sachs,</p>
<p>and Jason Calacanis sitting at a dimly lit table in a smoky bar.</p>
<p>A bottle of whiskey sits in the center of the table, half empty.</p>
<p>Chamath leaning forward, his eyes intense.</p>
<p>So what do you guys think about this chat GPT thing?</p>
<p>David Sachs takes a sip of his drink.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impressive. No doubt about it.</p>
<p>A large language model trained by open AI that can generate human</p>
<p>like texts in a variety of styles and formats. It&rsquo;s a game changer.</p>
<p>Jason nods. Definitely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most advanced AI systems we&rsquo;ve seen to date.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to have a huge impact on the way we use and interact with AI.</p>
<p>Chamath frowns.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m worried about.</p>
<p>With a technology like this, the possibilities are endless,</p>
<p>but so are the potential dangers.</p>
<p>Sachs leans back in his chair.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Chamath. You&rsquo;re not still stuck on that whole</p>
<p>AI is going to kill us all thing, are you?</p>
<p>Chamath leans forward again, his voice low and serious.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m not saying that chat GPT is going to turn into Skynet overnight,</p>
<p>but we need to be careful about the way we develop and deploy AI.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that we&rsquo;re using it for good</p>
<p>and not just for our own gain.</p>
<p>Jkal nods.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that we&rsquo;re responsible in the way we use AI,</p>
<p>and that includes making sure it&rsquo;s accessible and affordable to everyone,</p>
<p>not just a select few.</p>
<p>Chamath with a dirty smirk.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget about the importance of regulation.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that we have the right laws in place</p>
<p>to prevent the misuse of AI.</p>
<p>The director&rsquo;s calling cut.</p>
<p>Cut. That&rsquo;s it, scene.</p>
<p>Exit scene. We&rsquo;re not going to finish it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that far off. I mean, it&rsquo;s 60% of the way there.</p>
<p>All you have to do is put in a Biden for Sachs.</p>
<p>If you blame Biden, it would have been perfect.</p>
<p>Let me tell you guys something stunning about this platform.</p>
<p>So this is GPT 3.5, which is an interim model</p>
<p>to what people are saying is the long awaited GPT 4.0 model,</p>
<p>which I think they announced in 2020</p>
<p>and has been in development for some time.</p>
<p>So this GPT 3.5 model was trained in three steps.</p>
<p>They do a great job explaining it on the OpenAI blog site</p>
<p>where they collect some data.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a supervised model,</p>
<p>meaning that there are humans that are involved in tagging.</p>
<p>And then the model kind of, you know, learns from that system.</p>
<p>Then you ask the model questions, you get output.</p>
<p>And then humans rank the output.</p>
<p>And so the model learns through that ranking system.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s kind of this third optimization thing,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s fine tuned.</p>
<p>So the model itself has several steps of kind of human involvement</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of it sources its own data and builds it.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s incredible about this model?</p>
<p>The total size of the software package that runs the model is about 100 gigabytes.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that amazing?</p>
<p>Like, you could fit this model on probably what, 20% of the storage space on your iPhone.</p>
<p>And you could run this thing and you could probably just talk to it for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really kind of an incredible milestone.</p>
<p>But I think what was so stunning to me about this,</p>
<p>I know you guys are probably expecting something to be said like this,</p>
<p>but you could see so many human knowledge worker roles and functions being replaced by this extraordinary interface.</p>
<p>So kids can do homework, that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>Software engineers can get their code optimized and can get their code written for them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s great examples of how software code has been written by this interface.</p>
<p>You could see real estate, insurance, salespeople being replaced by some sort of software-like interface.</p>
<p>Copywriters.</p>
<p>Copywriters, you know, make me 100 versions of a commercial or an ad that I can then use.</p>
<p>Customer support.</p>
<p>Customer support completely replaced, right?</p>
<p>If you guys remember, there were these automated customer support companies that started, you know, two decades ago.</p>
<p>Never worked.</p>
<p>And there was this great flurry.</p>
<p>All BPO businesses were all about lower cost human labor.</p>
<p>Now the cost of human labor goes to zero.</p>
<p>My prediction, which is, so everyone&rsquo;s got the obvious prediction,</p>
<p>which is there&rsquo;s going to be 100,000 startups that are going to emerge.</p>
<p>I mean, this is kind of like this moment where the internet came along and everyone&rsquo;s like, this changes everything.</p>
<p>I do think everyone thinks and feels that.</p>
<p>So the obvious next step is a bubble will form.</p>
<p>Can I ask a technical question though, Freeberg?</p>
<p>And then Chamath, you&rsquo;re probably thinking the same thing here.</p>
<p>Let me just finish my market prediction and then we&rsquo;ll do the,</p>
<p>but I think because everyone&rsquo;s so hyped about this and we all know this,</p>
<p>all the VC attention, all the investor attention is shifting to this capability.</p>
<p>And how do you apply this sort of capability across all of these different industries and all these different applications?</p>
<p>And as a result, my guess is the next hype cycle, the next bubble cycle in Silicon Valley will absolutely be this generative AI business.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is a little technical, but how would it know the difference between like,</p>
<p>Y-O-U-R and U-R when it is processing natural language, if you were to do like your anus or your anus?</p>
<p>How would that, Freeberg, how would it know the difference between your anus and your space anus?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll, it&rsquo;ll learn that, you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t land.</p>
<p>It was a joke about your anus, it didn&rsquo;t land.</p>
<p>Try again.</p>
<p>The AI probably would have made a better joke than that.</p>
<p>It would have made a better joke for sure.</p>
<p>Somebody did it in our group chat and said, do intros like J-Cal, and they were terrible.</p>
<p>So at least I have a job for another year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only asked the AI to pretend you&rsquo;re the all-in-pod besties telling Uranus jokes.</p>
<p>That would be pretty hilarious.</p>
<p>Sorry, let me just say one more thing about this OpenAI thing.</p>
<p>I do think that the biggest and most interesting thing to think about is how this will disrupt the search box.</p>
<p>The search, you know, the way search works at Google, you know, and the internet search,</p>
<p>is there are these kind of servers, these web crawlers that go out and gather data.</p>
<p>Some are structured data feeds, and some of them are just crawlers.</p>
<p>And then that data is indexed, or in the structured way, it&rsquo;s kind of made available for serving directly on the search page.</p>
<p>And so much of that is indexing.</p>
<p>So I search for a bunch of keywords, those keywords, and perhaps some natural language context are matched to a result page,</p>
<p>and I click on that, and it&rsquo;s linked out.</p>
<p>Years ago, Google started a product called the OneBox, where they could take structured data,</p>
<p>like what is the weather in San Francisco today,</p>
<p>and that top of the search result page just presented that data,</p>
<p>because it knows with high certainty the question you&rsquo;re asking,</p>
<p>and it knows with high certainty the answer it can give you.</p>
<p>Yeah, clipped it from somebody&rsquo;s website, right.</p>
<p>So if that starts to become everything, then that OneBox interface,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just Google&rsquo;s ability to access all this data and index it and serve it and store it,</p>
<p>there could be a lot of competitors to the OneBox and a lot of competitors ultimately to search.</p>
<p>And ultimately, you know, Google&rsquo;s core product, their search engine,</p>
<p>could be radically disrupted by an alternative set system or set of systems</p>
<p>that have more of a natural language chat interface.</p>
<p>Which is literally why Google bought DeepMind,</p>
<p>and there were a collection of human-powered search engines, Mahalo included,</p>
<p>ChaCha, Answers.com, who were trying to do the human-based version of this.</p>
<p>It just didn&rsquo;t scale.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to get ahead of ourselves, because one of the things we don&rsquo;t know is how much is going on in DeepMind.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not very open like OpenAI is.</p>
<p>They talk about some of the advanced frontier stuff like AlphaFold and so on,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been public about that,</p>
<p>but a lot of that is really to generate interest and hype in what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>But my understanding is DeepMind&rsquo;s been applied to everything from</p>
<p>Ads.</p>
<p>Ad optimization, but also the ranking on YouTube videos to get people more engagement on YouTube, etc.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all these ways that DeepMind&rsquo;s been applied within Google services.</p>
<p>That we don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>And certainly within search.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the question is, is there an entirely new interface for search</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>that risks Google&rsquo;s core search business?</p>
<p>And I think that there certainly will be a lot of money thrown at this.</p>
<p>And if anyone has any interesting ideas, send me an email.</p>
<p>Saks and then Shamath.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a really interesting point.</p>
<p>I saw a thread on this where somebody was asking GPT a bunch of questions.</p>
<p>They were generally coding questions, and they were actually comparing the result in Google versus GPT.</p>
<p>And Google would just give you a reference, like a link to some page.</p>
<p>Whereas GPT-3 would actually construct the answer, like a multi-paragraph answer.</p>
<p>That was far more detailed and, in a way, user-friendly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whereas the Google page would kick you over to a reference where it was like this one, two, three,</p>
<p>maybe someone had created a checklist, but it just wasn&rsquo;t that detailed.</p>
<p>It really is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>I thought Andreessen tweeted a really interesting example as well,</p>
<p>where he asked GPT to create a scene from a play starring a New York Times journalist and a Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur.</p>
<p>They were arguing about free speech, and each person asserts the view associated with his profession and social circle.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to read the whole thing, but I thought this was spot on,</p>
<p>where I was actually like both sides are making their best arguments,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like to each other in a conversation that seems intelligible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making their points at the right time in the conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re playing off each other.</p>
<p>In other words, it actually reads like a conversation.</p>
<p>I actually thought this one was more impressive than the one with the Bestie impersonation.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I actually thought that the one about all-in didn&rsquo;t really capture our personalities per se,</p>
<p>but this one actually does a pretty good job capturing the arguments in this debate.</p>
<p>Chamath?</p>
<p>Pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Any thoughts here?</p>
<p>Yeah, lots.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time learning about this area.</p>
<p>Six years ago, a team that I partnered with who was at Google that built TPU,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been building silicon for this space,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve been kind of going from the ground up for the last six years.</p>
<p>A couple of things that I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>The first is that I think we&rsquo;re going to replace SAS with what I call MAS,</p>
<p>which is Models as a Service.</p>
<p>A lot of what software will be, particularly in the enterprise,</p>
<p>will get replaced with a single-use model that allows you to solve a function.</p>
<p>These chat examples are one,</p>
<p>and you can name a bunch of SAS companies that were purveyors of SAS</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll get replaced by essentially GPT-3 or some other language model.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;ll be a whole bunch of other things like that.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s an expense management company,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have a model that&rsquo;ll allow them to actually do expense management</p>
<p>or blah, blah, blah, forecasting better.</p>
<p>So I think SAS will get replaced over time with these models incrementally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s phase one.</p>
<p>But the problem with all of these models, in my opinion,</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re still largely brittle.</p>
<p>They are good at one thing.</p>
<p>They are a single-mode way of interfacing with data.</p>
<p>The next big leap,</p>
<p>and I think it will come from one of the big tech companies or from OpenAI,</p>
<p>is, and we talked about this, I talked about this a few episodes ago,</p>
<p>a multimodal model,</p>
<p>which then allows you to actually bring together and join</p>
<p>video voice data in a unique way</p>
<p>to answer real substantive problems.</p>
<p>So if I had to steel man the opposite side reaction,</p>
<p>so I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people gushing over the novelty of GPT-3,</p>
<p>if I had to, or chat GPT,</p>
<p>if I had to steel man the opposite, what I would say is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to get somewhere between 95% to 99%</p>
<p>of all of these very simple questions right</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re kind of cute and simple.</p>
<p>There is no consequence of saying,</p>
<p>write a play because there is no wrong answer.</p>
<p>You either kind of, it tickles your fancy or it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it kind of entertains you or it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When this stuff becomes very valuable</p>
<p>is that when you really need a precise answer</p>
<p>and you can guarantee that to be overwhelmingly right,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the last 1% to 2% that is exceptionally hard.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re at a place yet</p>
<p>where these models can do that.</p>
<p>But when we get there,</p>
<p>all of these models as a service</p>
<p>will be very much commoditized.</p>
<p>And I think the real value is finding</p>
<p>non-obvious sources of data that feed it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all about training.</p>
<p>So meaning you can break down machine learning</p>
<p>and AI into two simple things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s training, which is what you do asynchronously.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s inference,</p>
<p>which is what you&rsquo;re doing in real time.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re typing something into chat API</p>
<p>or a chat GPT, that&rsquo;s an inference that&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re generating an output.</p>
<p>But the real key is where do you find</p>
<p>proprietary sources of data</p>
<p>that you can learn on top of?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real arms race.</p>
<p>So one example would be,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you build a model to detect tumors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people doing that.</p>
<p>Well, the company that will win</p>
<p>may be the company that actually then</p>
<p>vertically integrates, buys a hospital system</p>
<p>and get access to patient data</p>
<p>that is completely proprietary to them</p>
<p>and covers the most number of women</p>
<p>of all age groups and of all ethnic categories.</p>
<p>Those are the kinds of moves in business</p>
<p>that we will see in the next five to 10 years</p>
<p>that I find much more exciting</p>
<p>and trying to figure out how to play in that space.</p>
<p>But I do think that chat GPT is a wonderful example</p>
<p>to point us in that direction.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sort of more of that case,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s a cute toy,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t yet cracked the one to 2% of use cases</p>
<p>that makes it super useful.</p>
<p>But I think the first step,</p>
<p>but the first step will be</p>
<p>the transformation of SaaS to mass.</p>
<p>And then from there,</p>
<p>we think we can try to figure this out.</p>
<p>It reminds me of in a way when you give that description</p>
<p>of like, hey, this is really interesting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not complete.</p>
<p>Is remember when GPS came out</p>
<p>and like people are like doing turn by turn navigation,</p>
<p>they drive off the road</p>
<p>because they were trusting it too much.</p>
<p>And then, you know, over 20 years of GPS,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of like, yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty bulletproof,</p>
<p>but keep your eyes on the road.</p>
<p>Same thing that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And these changes tend to be slow.</p>
<p>These last 100 or 200 basis points</p>
<p>literally takes decades.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So the last 15% of self-driving</p>
<p>is like the decade long, you know, slog.</p>
<p>That may take a century.</p>
<p>15% may take a century,</p>
<p>but the last 2% will take a few decades.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the change happens very slowly</p>
<p>and then all at once.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know what a TPU is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tensor processing unit.</p>
<p>This is Google&rsquo;s application specific circuits, right?</p>
<p>And custom Silicon</p>
<p>that they invented for TensorFlow at the time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you want to try to&hellip;</p>
<p>Although now the modality of AI,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve changed that as well.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re totally in the world of transformers.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not even using,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not letting the tensors flow</p>
<p>the way they used to.</p>
<p>All right, there&rsquo;s been a slowdown in SaaS.</p>
<p>Sax, what is happening</p>
<p>in the software as a service world?</p>
<p>There was a good update by Jamin Ball</p>
<p>who works for Altimeter,</p>
<p>our friend, Brad Gerstner.</p>
<p>He does these really great updates</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s happening in the SaaS world.</p>
<p>The big thing this week</p>
<p>is that Salesforce had its quarter</p>
<p>and I would consider Salesforce</p>
<p>to be the bellwether</p>
<p>for the whole SaaS category.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re the largest pure SaaS company.</p>
<p>They were the first multi-tenant SaaS</p>
<p>like company at scale.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;ve shown</p>
<p>is a huge slowdown.</p>
<p>Basically, their net new ARR</p>
<p>that they just added in the previous quarter</p>
<p>dropped two thirds</p>
<p>compared to the previous quarter.</p>
<p>But because their sales and marketing spend</p>
<p>was the same as the previous quarter,</p>
<p>it exploded their CAC payback,</p>
<p>which means the amount of time</p>
<p>it takes to pay back</p>
<p>your customer acquisition costs</p>
<p>for a given customer.</p>
<p>So you see there are 155 months.</p>
<p>It would take now</p>
<p>to pay back the customer acquisition costs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s over 10 years.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I mean, I think before this quarter,</p>
<p>it was more like two and a half years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that you can afford.</p>
<p>A company can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re spending 10 years</p>
<p>of gross profit on a customer</p>
<p>to acquire them,</p>
<p>the business doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m not saying any of this</p>
<p>to pick on Salesforce.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exceptionally run company,</p>
<p>one of the absolute best.</p>
<p>Marc Benioff, fantastic CEO, founder,</p>
<p>great human being.</p>
<p>But I think the point here is</p>
<p>that what you&rsquo;re seeing is</p>
<p>the whole SaaS industry</p>
<p>is really slowing down here.</p>
<p>In the first half of the year,</p>
<p>you saw SaaS valuations correct.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re actually seeing</p>
<p>SaaS top line correct.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an interesting question here.</p>
<p>If your CAC payback</p>
<p>goes from two and a half years to 10 years,</p>
<p>you have to bring your CAC down.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>You can either reduce marketing</p>
<p>or you can reduce sales.</p>
<p>So in other words, you can reduce&hellip;</p>
<p>You mean cut the sales team.</p>
<p>You can either cut people</p>
<p>and headcount from your own team</p>
<p>or you can cut spending you do</p>
<p>on advertising or events</p>
<p>or money that you spend on other companies.</p>
<p>Either way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a big contraction</p>
<p>in jobs basically around this industry.</p>
<p>And I think that what that could do</p>
<p>is cause a vicious cycle</p>
<p>where we start seeing&hellip;</p>
<p>Death spiral?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say death spiral.</p>
<p>I think this vicious cycle</p>
<p>for the next year or so</p>
<p>where seat contraction becomes the norm</p>
<p>instead of seat expansion.</p>
<p>So if you go back over the last 10 years,</p>
<p>a major tailwind</p>
<p>at the backs of SaaS startups</p>
<p>has been that every year,</p>
<p>you start with 120%,</p>
<p>130, 150% of last year&rsquo;s revenue</p>
<p>just from your existing customers.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they were hiring more and more people</p>
<p>and they needed to buy more and more seats.</p>
<p>But now headcount growth is frozen</p>
<p>and in fact,</p>
<p>companies are doing major layoffs.</p>
<p>So the baseline for next year</p>
<p>could be seat contraction.</p>
<p>So instead of starting with 120%</p>
<p>of last year&rsquo;s revenue,</p>
<p>you might start with 80% or 90%</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s going to be so much churn.</p>
<p>So I think that SaaS companies</p>
<p>need to take this into account.</p>
<p>This idea that growth is on autopilot,</p>
<p>that could start to go in reverse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think permanently,</p>
<p>but I think for the next year or so.</p>
<p>This is why also I tweeted,</p>
<p>2X is the new 3X.</p>
<p>If you can grow 2X year over year</p>
<p>in this environment,</p>
<p>that is as good as or better</p>
<p>than growing 3X last year.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>Clearly it&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>Like a lot of companies</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t that great</p>
<p>could grow 3X last year</p>
<p>because times were so frothy,</p>
<p>everyone was buying everything.</p>
<p>But now it is going to be really hard</p>
<p>to even double year over year.</p>
<p>Companies need to take that into account</p>
<p>into their financial planning.</p>
<p>You need to restrain your burn</p>
<p>because a lot of the revenue</p>
<p>that you predict is going to be there</p>
<p>may not be there.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thanks so much to the Secretary of SAS.</p>
<p>I think you got a board meeting.</p>
<p>I do. I got to run.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things I saw</p>
<p>in terms of use cases</p>
<p>is somebody used the chat GPT</p>
<p>to describe rooms.</p>
<p>Then they took the descriptions</p>
<p>of those rooms</p>
<p>and then they put them into like</p>
<p>DALI or Stable Diffusion,</p>
<p>one of those,</p>
<p>and it created the visual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious if you think,</p>
<p>you know, the self-driving APIs</p>
<p>and machine learning that&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>then you got images,</p>
<p>then you got chat.</p>
<p>Maybe you have proteins going on</p>
<p>with the alpha fold stuff.</p>
<p>When these things start talking</p>
<p>to each other,</p>
<p>is that going to be</p>
<p>the emergent behavior</p>
<p>that we see of general AI</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll interpret it</p>
<p>in our world</p>
<p>is these hundred different</p>
<p>vertical AIs</p>
<p>hitting some level</p>
<p>of reasonableness</p>
<p>to Chamath&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>on data sets</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>the self-driving AI</p>
<p>is talking to the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s looking at cancer</p>
<p>and tumor diagnosis</p>
<p>in the chat</p>
<p>and the image ones</p>
<p>and maybe Stable Diffusion,</p>
<p>the protein AI</p>
<p>and the one that&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>at cancer cells</p>
<p>start talking to each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s as likely</p>
<p>as the&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of solutions</p>
<p>that will emerge</p>
<p>within verticals</p>
<p>and I think you can</p>
<p>distinguish them.</p>
<p>So, I kind of gave this example</p>
<p>a few months ago.</p>
<p>If you remember</p>
<p>Kai&rsquo;s Power Tools</p>
<p>was a plug-in</p>
<p>for Adobe Photoshop</p>
<p>came out in 1993,</p>
<p>I believe.</p>
<p>And Kai&rsquo;s Power Tools</p>
<p>completely transformed</p>
<p>the potential</p>
<p>of Adobe Photoshop</p>
<p>because Photoshop</p>
<p>had all the basic</p>
<p>brushing and editing</p>
<p>capabilities within it.</p>
<p>Kai&rsquo;s Power Tools</p>
<p>was statistical models</p>
<p>that basically took</p>
<p>the matrix of the pixels</p>
<p>and, you know,</p>
<p>created some evolution</p>
<p>of them into some</p>
<p>visual output</p>
<p>like a blur</p>
<p>and so you could blur</p>
<p>motion blur or something</p>
<p>and you could change</p>
<p>the parameters</p>
<p>and now your photo</p>
<p>looked like it was going</p>
<p>through a motion blur.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Photoshop</p>
<p>bought and implemented</p>
<p>those tools</p>
<p>but those were similar.</p>
<p>They were statistical</p>
<p>models that made</p>
<p>some representation</p>
<p>of the input</p>
<p>which was the image</p>
<p>and then created an output</p>
<p>which was an adjusted image.</p>
<p>I would argue that</p>
<p>that is very similar</p>
<p>although the models</p>
<p>behind it are very different</p>
<p>in terms of the</p>
<p>contextual application</p>
<p>of statistical models</p>
<p>in software</p>
<p>and you could see</p>
<p>stuff like, for example,</p>
<p>a chatbot that</p>
<p>replaces</p>
<p>help me figure out</p>
<p>whether my credit card</p>
<p>charges are correct</p>
<p>or not</p>
<p>instead of having</p>
<p>a customer service agent</p>
<p>an offshore customer</p>
<p>service agent</p>
<p>helping you</p>
<p>resolve that</p>
<p>or help me return</p>
<p>my item</p>
<p>or there are very</p>
<p>specific kind of</p>
<p>verticalized applications</p>
<p>that can plug in</p>
<p>that ultimately</p>
<p>replace what was</p>
<p>manual and human</p>
<p>driven before</p>
<p>because humans used to</p>
<p>manually make the</p>
<p>motion blur in Photoshop</p>
<p>and then it was</p>
<p>automated with these</p>
<p>software packages</p>
<p>and I think you can</p>
<p>kind of think about it</p>
<p>in that same way</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>unknowns they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>require necessarily</p>
<p>human physical labor</p>
<p>or some</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>human responsiveness</p>
<p>that if 95% of the</p>
<p>work can be handled</p>
<p>it will get handled</p>
<p>by some</p>
<p>verticalized solution</p>
<p>so I think</p>
<p>the physical labor</p>
<p>versus the non physical</p>
<p>labor is one way to</p>
<p>think about the</p>
<p>distinction meaning</p>
<p>is there some change</p>
<p>in the physical world</p>
<p>driving is absolutely</p>
<p>a change in the</p>
<p>physical world</p>
<p>you have to move</p>
<p>physically through space</p>
<p>so that one is a</p>
<p>very distinct class</p>
<p>all the stuff that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like communication</p>
<p>imagery</p>
<p>static imagery</p>
<p>audio</p>
<p>and then visual</p>
<p>video</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some stacking</p>
<p>that happens there</p>
<p>and some of those</p>
<p>will be kind of</p>
<p>siloed and then</p>
<p>some of them will merge</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have these</p>
<p>kind of unique kind of</p>
<p>combo models</p>
<p>and so look as they</p>
<p>start to work together</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll see them</p>
<p>you know completely</p>
<p>rewrite some of these</p>
<p>verticals like</p>
<p>movie production</p>
<p>or music production</p>
<p>right or advertising</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re seeing it</p>
<p>now with</p>
<p>with video and</p>
<p>creative arts</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>some of the</p>
<p>visual stuff on</p>
<p>to be honest</p>
<p>a lot of journalism</p>
<p>a lot of creative arts</p>
<p>have become the wisdom</p>
<p>of the crowds over the</p>
<p>last two decades</p>
<p>where you know</p>
<p>artists were looking</p>
<p>at the collective</p>
<p>works of the</p>
<p>internet</p>
<p>interpreting it</p>
<p>and then coming up</p>
<p>with content</p>
<p>which is kind of what</p>
<p>these AIs are doing</p>
<p>and then who</p>
<p>legally owns</p>
<p>the collective content</p>
<p>is going to be a big</p>
<p>question Chamath</p>
<p>you talked about</p>
<p>data sets</p>
<p>and Microsoft is being</p>
<p>sued right now</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>used open source</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>create tools</p>
<p>in AI</p>
<p>to help</p>
<p>augment programmers</p>
<p>like while they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>programming and writing</p>
<p>code it gives them</p>
<p>suggestions and now</p>
<p>the open source</p>
<p>community is suing them</p>
<p>for using their data</p>
<p>sets so what do you</p>
<p>think about the</p>
<p>legality of data sets</p>
<p>Chamath and</p>
<p>should they get</p>
<p>some kind of</p>
<p>protection if you</p>
<p>make a GPT-3</p>
<p>based on Quora</p>
<p>or based on</p>
<p>Wikipedia</p>
<p>should you have to</p>
<p>get approval</p>
<p>to use that data</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the opposite</p>
<p>they say that</p>
<p>this is actually</p>
<p>your work</p>
<p>and I think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the right</p>
<p>legal framework</p>
<p>but the answer</p>
<p>to your other</p>
<p>question is</p>
<p>this is why</p>
<p>I think the</p>
<p>hunt for</p>
<p>proprietary data</p>
<p>actually becomes</p>
<p>the hunt that</p>
<p>matters</p>
<p>all of this</p>
<p>other stuff I</p>
<p>think is a lot</p>
<p>less important</p>
<p>because I think</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>assume that all</p>
<p>of these models</p>
<p>will eventually</p>
<p>just get</p>
<p>commoditized</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>on top of the</p>
<p>same substrate</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>convergence</p>
<p>right everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chat model will</p>
<p>eventually look and</p>
<p>sound and feel like</p>
<p>the same thing</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving it a few</p>
<p>special ingredients</p>
<p>that other people</p>
<p>are not and so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the hunt for</p>
<p>those ingredients</p>
<p>that will make</p>
<p>this next</p>
<p>generation of</p>
<p>of models really</p>
<p>valuable so to</p>
<p>give it an example</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>Wikipedia which</p>
<p>is creative</p>
<p>commons anybody</p>
<p>can use but</p>
<p>Quora as a</p>
<p>data set not</p>
<p>advantage take an</p>
<p>extreme example</p>
<p>if Quora</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t allow</p>
<p>themselves to</p>
<p>be crawled</p>
<p>right okay</p>
<p>which they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>but then they</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>develop their own</p>
<p>language model</p>
<p>which used the</p>
<p>best of the</p>
<p>internet so</p>
<p>call it you</p>
<p>know GPT</p>
<p>and Quora</p>
<p>maybe they are</p>
<p>slightly better in</p>
<p>certain domains</p>
<p>and others the</p>
<p>the other extreme</p>
<p>example is the</p>
<p>one that I used</p>
<p>in health care</p>
<p>which is you</p>
<p>know the</p>
<p>ethyl</p>
<p>that you</p>
<p>will not</p>
<p>license to</p>
<p>anybody else</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>stands to</p>
<p>reason that</p>
<p>that model</p>
<p>actually then</p>
<p>has much</p>
<p>better chances</p>
<p>of highly</p>
<p>effective clinical</p>
<p>outcomes versus</p>
<p>any other</p>
<p>model</p>
<p>apple watch</p>
<p>comes to</p>
<p>mind right</p>
<p>apple has</p>
<p>all that</p>
<p>watch data</p>
<p>if they could</p>
<p>pair that</p>
<p>with epics</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>data set</p>
<p>the other</p>
<p>thing is they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotten so</p>
<p>methodically they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never touted the</p>
<p>ai you know</p>
<p>they introduce</p>
<p>one or two</p>
<p>distinguishing</p>
<p>features every</p>
<p>year right</p>
<p>so like the</p>
<p>the the ecg</p>
<p>which was</p>
<p>introduced many</p>
<p>many years</p>
<p>ago is has</p>
<p>only gotten</p>
<p>slightly more</p>
<p>usable like</p>
<p>five or six</p>
<p>years later</p>
<p>but in the</p>
<p>meantime</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know tens</p>
<p>of millions</p>
<p>of watches</p>
<p>collecting this</p>
<p>oil uber</p>
<p>and tesla</p>
<p>have all this</p>
<p>data of the</p>
<p>data being</p>
<p>collected by</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>well hold on</p>
<p>so phone yet</p>
<p>or the cameras</p>
<p>in the cars</p>
<p>the other</p>
<p>difference though is</p>
<p>that you have to</p>
<p>be in a realm</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need regulators</p>
<p>to go the last</p>
<p>mile so the</p>
<p>problem with</p>
<p>adas i think</p>
<p>or level five</p>
<p>autonomy is</p>
<p>that eventually</p>
<p>you get to a</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>even if the</p>
<p>model becomes</p>
<p>quote-unquote</p>
<p>and what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>is i think you</p>
<p>have to focus on</p>
<p>areas of the</p>
<p>economy that are</p>
<p>not subject to</p>
<p>that or where</p>
<p>the regulatory</p>
<p>pathways already</p>
<p>defined so for</p>
<p>example if you</p>
<p>use that health</p>
<p>care example</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that</p>
<p>you had the</p>
<p>largest corpus of</p>
<p>breast cancer</p>
<p>image data and</p>
<p>you could actually</p>
<p>build an ai that</p>
<p>was a much better</p>
<p>classifier for</p>
<p>tumors versus</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>the fda</p>
<p>actually has a</p>
<p>pathway to get</p>
<p>that approved</p>
<p>so for example</p>
<p>a crypto example</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>know who will</p>
<p>govern that</p>
<p>decision and we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>that will be</p>
<p>governed so i</p>
<p>think the the</p>
<p>thing that</p>
<p>investors have to</p>
<p>do and</p>
<p>entrepreneurs</p>
<p>entrepreneurs have</p>
<p>to pick their end</p>
<p>market very</p>
<p>carefully and</p>
<p>investors have to</p>
<p>realize that this</p>
<p>dynamic exists as</p>
<p>well if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do</p>
<p>this right</p>
<p>imagine the</p>
<p>robin hood</p>
<p>trading you</p>
<p>know trader</p>
<p>data set watching</p>
<p>the other big but</p>
<p>not ai right so</p>
<p>then who knows</p>
<p>maybe they are using</p>
<p>on their side</p>
<p>they are i can tell</p>
<p>you as somebody who</p>
<p>sells we sell a</p>
<p>lot of machine</p>
<p>learning hardware</p>
<p>into this market</p>
<p>the biggest buyers</p>
<p>are the u.s.</p>
<p>government and</p>
<p>these ultra high</p>
<p>frequency trading</p>
<p>organizations</p>
<p>any final thoughts</p>
<p>here i&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>the final word</p>
<p>how could this</p>
<p>affect astronomy</p>
<p>how could this</p>
<p>affect you know</p>
<p>our search of the</p>
<p>galaxies you know</p>
<p>going out past</p>
<p>pluto saturn</p>
<p>uranus any of</p>
<p>any of those things</p>
<p>how could it</p>
<p>impact</p>
<p>any</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying to get a</p>
<p>uranus joke to land</p>
<p>help me out there</p>
<p>truman</p>
<p>you got</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that i</p>
<p>think you need to</p>
<p>have more</p>
<p>uh space</p>
<p>related</p>
<p>um yeah</p>
<p>workshop this one</p>
<p>with me or</p>
<p>gut or gut</p>
<p>biome related</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll come by him</p>
<p>yeah so how</p>
<p>would this affect</p>
<p>super good</p>
<p>use the promo</p>
<p>code twist</p>
<p>you have to trick</p>
<p>friedberg into</p>
<p>using super good</p>
<p>and then rug</p>
<p>pull him now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>proper rug pull</p>
<p>exactly let&rsquo;s do it</p>
<p>here we go let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>workshop that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>rug so uh tell us</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing like super</p>
<p>gut use promo code</p>
<p>twist to get 25%</p>
<p>off when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing super good</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re analyzing</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s guts</p>
<p>how would you then</p>
<p>have machine</p>
<p>learning in this</p>
<p>you know api</p>
<p>uh this chat</p>
<p>api and gpt3</p>
<p>how could that</p>
<p>help with</p>
<p>processing all of</p>
<p>that especially</p>
<p>when it passes</p>
<p>through uranus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what friends</p>
<p>would do</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re free</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hung over</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m hung over but i</p>
