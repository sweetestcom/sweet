<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>hello everyone I have another special</p>
<p>guest dr. Eric Westman is here I did an</p>
<p>interview before so welcome back thank</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s great to be back and listen I</p>
<p>wanted to bring you on because for a</p>
<p>couple reasons I&rsquo;m what&rsquo;s unique about</p>
<p>you is you&rsquo;re in a clinical setting you</p>
<p>actually are medical doctor you practice</p>
<p>on a regular full-time and you your mode</p>
<p>of therapy is like food therapy like you</p>
<p>do keto I mean this is like so rare so I</p>
<p>wanted to get a chance to pick your</p>
<p>brain and just dive in here because a</p>
<p>lot of times if you look at the videos</p>
<p>out there they&rsquo;re from people who have</p>
<p>never actually worked one-on-one with a</p>
<p>patient and that is a huge advantage</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re dealing with just experience</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t always get the same</p>
<p>type of person so I think probably being</p>
<p>a practice expanding your view point of</p>
<p>you know you can&rsquo;t just put everyone</p>
<p>into one little hole right absolutely</p>
<p>and well as you know as a clinician</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s different so people have</p>
<p>different stories different actually</p>
<p>different metabolism different bodies so</p>
<p>having a clinical base for me now and</p>
<p>and in the past I&rsquo;ve been doing this now</p>
<p>about 12 years in a private practice at</p>
<p>a university at Duke University and that</p>
<p>was after eight years of clinical</p>
<p>research doing clinical studies and</p>
<p>publishing them in peer-reviewed</p>
<p>journals so I know the difference also</p>
<p>between doing a study and doing</p>
<p>something in clinical practice you have</p>
<p>much more flexibility when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with someone one-on-one in the</p>
<p>clinical practice exactly so that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I wanted it I want to try have some very</p>
<p>interesting questions the first question</p>
<p>is when you have people that come in to</p>
<p>see you are they looking for</p>
<p>Kito or are they looking for losing</p>
<p>weight do they know anything about keto</p>
<p>the whole gamut excuse me I&rsquo;m in a</p>
<p>unique setting where well some people</p>
<p>walk into my office and they</p>
<p>I watched every video of mine they they</p>
<p>know exactly what to do in fact money</p>
<p>because they have to wait have already</p>
<p>started that that&rsquo;s a whole gamut from</p>
<p>also I have individuals who are referred</p>
<p>by other doctors in the area here in</p>
<p>Durham in North Carolina and they are</p>
<p>not so up on the they may not even have</p>
<p>Google to do a little research on what</p>
<p>the clinic does and then and the third</p>
<p>set of folks have no idea what I do they</p>
<p>there they just come in the my doctor</p>
<p>sent me I guess in that middle group</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s people who have asked their doctors</p>
<p>for help with obesity with you know</p>
<p>treating with weight loss or diabetes</p>
<p>control but it I think a unique nature</p>
<p>of the clinical setting I&rsquo;m in because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a insurance and Medicare Medicaid</p>
<p>based so the other types of health care</p>
<p>providers I get a wide range of folks</p>
<p>actually very rarely did someone come in</p>
<p>and pay out of pocket to my Wow Duke so</p>
<p>yeah some people have no idea why</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re there most people come for</p>
<p>obesity and diabetes treatment although</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m comfortable now treating most</p>
<p>diseases with monitoring because I&rsquo;m an</p>
<p>internal medicine specialist by training</p>
<p>but answer your question</p>
<p>most people come for obesity and</p>
<p>diabetes but not everyone interesting</p>
<p>now I get I get this a lot so people</p>
<p>always ask me well do I have a referral</p>
<p>from new medical doctor just just</p>
<p>because you know in my area min Virginia</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>medical doctors that even know about</p>
<p>keto they&rsquo;re not taught that so people</p>
<p>are trying to go to the medical doctor</p>
<p>and try to like they want to be on this</p>
<p>eating plan but they also need the</p>
<p>medical doctor so there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re doing this this conflict</p>
<p>so do you</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your you know your quick answer</p>
<p>on dealing with their doctors and that</p>
<p>are kind of anti they&rsquo;re kind of like oh</p>
<p>no you shouldn&rsquo;t do that that&rsquo;s number</p>
<p>one it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s dangerous it&rsquo;s gonna put</p>
<p>you at risk so you know that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>the things I mean if they live close to</p>
<p>you of course you would come to see you</p>
<p>but what if they&rsquo;re Nebraska and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like on that what am I going to do</p>
<p>yeah of course we&rsquo;re trying to fix that</p>
<p>within our new company which I will talk</p>
<p>about later I hope but in actually</p>
<p>making available doctors and training</p>
<p>them ourselves but yeah the current</p>
<p>situation is kind of sad you know if a</p>
<p>doctor says it&rsquo;s unsafe or it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>kill you they&rsquo;re clearly out of touch so</p>
<p>you know more than your doctor does</p>
<p>there was a recent article in the news</p>
<p>that said you know here are diets that</p>
<p>are deadly and keto was one of them is</p>
<p>right now I do kind of roll my eyes</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s so out of date and you</p>
<p>know you can&rsquo;t police every media report</p>
<p>but so for doctors well I guess I have</p>
<p>two responses one is if you&rsquo;re otherwise</p>
<p>healthy if you&rsquo;re not on any medications</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have any really serious</p>
<p>medical problems ongoing I mean you had</p>
<p>your appendix out and and maybe your</p>
<p>tonsils and and something you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>your doctor to do this I mean there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>enough information now that you can do</p>
<p>this with proper teaching and coaching</p>
<p>without your doctors support and so or</p>
<p>one thing you can say is well can we</p>
<p>agree to disagree on the diet I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to do this can you monitor</p>
<p>everything else right that you would</p>
<p>normally measure that so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>strategy but but I do caution that if</p>
<p>someone is taking medications and I</p>
<p>think if the diet is unsafe it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that medications can become too strong</p>
<p>right so if you&rsquo;re handling the district</p>
<p>cause the blood pressure coming down</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on medication now it&rsquo;s gonna come</p>
<p>really low or another point you bring up</p>
<p>about if you&rsquo;re on insulin which I want</p>
<p>us to spend a little minute on this</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re a diabetic type two</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on insulin</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t monitor that and you go on</p>
<p>keto your your blood sugars are coming</p>
<p>down and you&rsquo;re still taking the same</p>
<p>insulin you&rsquo;re gonna end up with a</p>
<p>serious hypoglycemia reaction we see the</p>
<p>blood sugar can go down fifty to a</p>
<p>hundred units in one day or that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>milligrams per deciliter but I mean 50</p>
<p>to 100 points so if you don&rsquo;t produce</p>
<p>the insulin you will get a hypo now a</p>
<p>lot of people get hypose they think</p>
<p>nothing of it I I don&rsquo;t want a hypo man</p>
<p>I it can be life-threatening</p>
<p>so another strategy that we use is we</p>
<p>would rather have the blood sugar be a</p>
<p>little higher than to be too low and a</p>
<p>lot of doctors don&rsquo;t understand that</p>
<p>they they want really tight control as</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s changing the diet losing</p>
<p>weight so that so actually there&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of a training that&rsquo;s important for</p>
<p>doctors to go through that might not be</p>
<p>totally apparent to the doctor who&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>to this so even let&rsquo;s say you went to</p>
<p>your doctor if said I&rsquo;m gonna start this</p>
<p>keto diet what should I do with my</p>
<p>insulin the doctor might say well you</p>
<p>know diets aren&rsquo;t very powerful you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not very strong just go ahead</p>
<p>and try this oh no no no no so that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>caution I have I mean insulin is being</p>
<p>pushed so much now by medical doctors</p>
<p>and I Batala gist and and in fact most</p>
<p>of my patients think they can never come</p>
<p>off the insulin because they yeah yeah</p>
<p>and just for those of the that are new</p>
<p>watching dr. Westman you just study I</p>
<p>think I think this is based on your own</p>
<p>clinics that you were able to drop the</p>
<p>use of insulin like 98% is that give me</p>
<p>the actual figures on that because this</p>
<p>is like mind-blowing data right here</p>
<p>well so this in several papers that are</p>
<p>published in the literature in fact our</p>
<p>first one was published in 2008 so that</p>
<p>most people have forgotten about it</p>
<p>sadly so yes you know in there and you</p>
<p>know we made the kind of policy decision</p>
<p>to never say that one died it&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>than another</p>
<p>another diet can&rsquo;t work and so in that</p>
<p>paper we showed that the low glycemic</p>
<p>diet worked for diabetes but the</p>
<p>low-carb keto or keto diet worked better</p>
<p>and we got to take people off of insulin</p>
<p>more frequently a big study that came</p>
<p>out this year</p>
<p>Sarah Hallberg dr. Hallberg at Purdue</p>
<p>was the first author they were able to</p>
<p>take most people off or at least reduce</p>
<p>insulin in a year and over 200 people</p>
<p>now in our own clinic analysis with</p>
<p>about 50 people that&rsquo;s where this data</p>
<p>comes from we were able to take people</p>
<p>off ninety percent of people off insulin</p>
<p>in seven weeks and it says I just want</p>
<p>to stop there because that&rsquo;s like not</p>
<p>trivial yeah you come it&rsquo;s amazing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unbelievable</p>
<p>it is unbelievable because they we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking like 90 over 90 plus percent of</p>
<p>the people within seven weeks yeah this</p>
<p>should be on every newspaper I mean this</p>
<p>is like huge because the because the</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the problem yes they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>regulate their sugars but the damage of</p>
<p>having high levels of insulin people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize that you have a lot of</p>
<p>problems with that even like someone&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>diabetic type 2 and they&rsquo;re on insulin</p>
<p>and there are normal blood sugars with</p>
<p>Jake and a lot of insulin they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily decrease the risk from heart</p>
<p>disease do they right no no and it</p>
<p>really just creates a chronic meaning a</p>
<p>a long term problem that you&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>fix but you know the insulin field and</p>
<p>insulin makers just makes stronger</p>
<p>insulin whether now 500 which is five</p>
<p>star five times stronger than the 100</p>
<p>units and so people are coming to me and</p>
<p>stronger and stronger insulin of course</p>
<p>what your body does is just like turning</p>
<p>the volume down when the noise gets</p>
<p>louder you just turn it down and so that</p>
<p>you actually don&rsquo;t fix the problem you</p>
<p>just get more and more insulin in your</p>
<p>body says no no no I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>listen so I guess the but the way I say</p>
<p>that and one reason it&rsquo;s not on the</p>
<p>headlines I guess is that the dominant</p>
<p>medical field of</p>
<p>pushes insolence so I it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re outliers we still small number of</p>
<p>people and depend so I&rsquo;m kind of given</p>
<p>up on trying to change the mindset of</p>
<p>the mainstream folks even the general</p>
<p>doctors in my area because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taught oh you have diabetes you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have it forever</p>
<p>you have to take medicines and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never fix it and that that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>case I mean so it&rsquo;s like as you said</p>
<p>right at the start we understand that</p>
<p>food is more important than any</p>
<p>medication yeah fortunately just not a</p>
<p>lot of money and food is a practitioner</p>
<p>you he start recommending food and in</p>
<p>consulting and education was there&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s not a money-making activity</p>
<p>question I have you were a past</p>
<p>I think the rector or I don&rsquo;t know if it</p>
<p>was the president of the American</p>
<p>Diabetes Association right</p>
<p>yeah no it&rsquo;ll be medicine obesity</p>
<p>medicine Association now president and</p>
<p>past chairman the board</p>
<p>you get to go through all of those okay</p>
<p>so so that was an organization that had</p>
<p>nothing to do with keto right well</p>
<p>interestingly the reason I got into the</p>
<p>obesity medicine Association it was to</p>
<p>teach the keto diet and so actually</p>
<p>there are a number and I would say I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know 5 percent 10 percent of folks</p>
<p>who use the keto diet in that</p>
<p>Association house the Association has</p>
<p>about 2100 individuals so it&rsquo;s growing I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s small but it&rsquo;s growing you can</p>
<p>actually sit for a board for obesity</p>
<p>medicine now called the hey B om</p>
<p>American Board of obesity medicine so</p>
<p>but in the guideline of the OMA will be</p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s physician Association there is a</p>
<p>a approval of using a keto diet as an a</p>
<p>safe and effective way to treat obesity</p>
<p>so there is a national organization that</p>
<p>approves of sanctions or however you</p>
<p>want to say it endorses the use of a</p>
<p>keto diet well that is increasing great</p>
<p>data because I did</p>
<p>idea yeah I probably could use that and</p>
<p>just quotes for people that are like oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dangerous well it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>recognizing it well typically your email</p>
<p>by the end of the day yeah good</p>
<p>now when you when you were running this</p>
<p>organization or being a part of it</p>
<p>obviously there&rsquo;s a lot of different</p>
<p>fixed ideas or other theories that</p>
<p>people have a hard time unfixing like</p>
<p>you guys probably would do symposiums</p>
<p>and think conventions right yes into</p>
<p>meetings every year and you would pose</p>
<p>that you would probably speak on Quito</p>
<p>imagine now what was the response did</p>
<p>they all go yeah this makes sense I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>board or what did you get people rolling</p>
<p>their eyes or what what happened well so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been teaching there for about ten</p>
<p>years so in fact the the people who</p>
<p>taught me there</p>
<p>you know this obesity medicine</p>
<p>Association has been around seventy</p>
<p>years and so there are people who now</p>
<p>retired the people who created the</p>
<p>organization and help to teach me as</p>
<p>well and they all knew going back to</p>
<p>when dr. Atkins was practicing and other</p>
<p>doctors who were using different</p>
<p>techniques that the low-carb worked and</p>
<p>it was just a matter of what people do</p>
<p>it is it mainstream enough you know the</p>
<p>doctors push back and say you can&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>all that fat and so it&rsquo;s changing now</p>
<p>fortunately the pop culture is aware</p>
<p>that eating fat is not a big a deal as</p>
<p>people thought it was but so the obesity</p>
<p>medicine Association most of those</p>
<p>doctors will use some sort of medication</p>
<p>first and then use a low carb or or</p>
<p>lower calorie diet in addition to it we</p>
<p>now use Lokar yeah yeah they just well</p>
<p>so you know the diet is less important</p>
<p>is the drugs and that organization as a</p>
<p>whole but there is a subset of folks who</p>
<p>use a keto diet and only like me so I</p>
<p>rarely use medications sometimes I will</p>
<p>especially if individual has gone to my</p>
<p>you know compadre down the street who</p>
<p>uses medication and they don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>pay for</p>
<p>out of pocket there they might come to</p>
<p>my practice which is insurance pay and</p>
<p>then ask for the medication that was</p>
<p>prescribed somewhere else</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m philosophically or</p>
<p>morally opposed and that is I mean I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>an internist I used to prescribe</p>
<p>medicine all the time now it is I can</p>
<p>take it away and I would say 95% of my</p>
<p>patients are strictly or just uniquely</p>
<p>keto without medication I mean this is</p>
<p>the trend this is what people want</p>
<p>people want Doc&rsquo;s that actually involve</p>
<p>food they want Doc&rsquo;s that actually</p>
<p>emphasize the food and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>missing yeah what about there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>organization it&rsquo;s called the obesity</p>
<p>society what is that what is that all</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>yeah the obesity society is the research</p>
<p>group in the u.s. so I think of the the</p>
<p>obesity medicine Association as the</p>
<p>medical clinical doctors obesity society</p>
<p>is the researchers and then the third</p>
<p>group is the surgical group American</p>
<p>Society of metabolic and bariatric</p>
<p>surgeons and the surgeons and the the</p>
<p>research group get together once a year</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called obesity week that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually in the fall and the obesity</p>
<p>medicine Association the clinical group</p>
<p>meets on that on its own twice a year</p>
<p>usually on one side of the country in</p>
<p>the u.s. going back and forth but those</p>
<p>are the three major organizations in the</p>
<p>US that address obesity</p>
<p>what kind of trend tied into research</p>
<p>one yeah what kind of trend are we</p>
<p>seeing with the medical new medical</p>
<p>doctors coming on board using using some</p>
<p>of these techniques food therapy</p>
<p>whatever what&rsquo;s happening who is there</p>
<p>any training training program is there</p>
<p>any type of ongoing seminars with</p>
<p>doctors can start to learn these the</p>
<p>basics well these are there are a few</p>
<p>few and far between the programs that</p>
<p>are are starting to me the nutrition</p>
<p>part is the old paradigm so you might</p>
<p>get into a</p>
<p>a program that&rsquo;s supported in your area</p>
<p>by the local hospital even learn from</p>
<p>that group but they&rsquo;ll pull in the old</p>
<p>you know food guide pyramid and all that</p>
<p>which you know should be kind of erased</p>
<p>from history so sadly the groups that</p>
<p>are well-intentioned in it and</p>
<p>addressing obesity are still teaching</p>
<p>doctors the old nutrition or they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>teaching the new medications that are</p>
<p>for new fda-approved medications and you</p>
<p>know really it&rsquo;s easy for a doctor just</p>
<p>to prescribe a pill or a shot than to go</p>
<p>into all the details about the food and</p>
<p>make sure they&rsquo;re oh you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having you know one soda a we could you</p>
<p>know with sugar no you can&rsquo;t do it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>simpler in this big system to just</p>
<p>prescribe medicines there&rsquo;s a third</p>
<p>element that we obesity medicine doctors</p>
<p>have or a third approach and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>very low calorie diets where people just</p>
<p>buy the products it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re designed</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t eat any food you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take any medicine you just buy the</p>
<p>products now the problem with that is</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;ve lost your weight with</p>
<p>the product what do you do and so if the</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t been taught what to do after</p>
<p>you use the products people just go back</p>
<p>to that weight and you know two years</p>
<p>later they&rsquo;re on the products I mean so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a great long-term answer and</p>
<p>so you you have an interview in your</p>
<p>clinic you part of it it&rsquo;s education</p>
<p>right oh yeah so yeah so do if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna just teach lifestyle or and really</p>
<p>I just it&rsquo;s 100 percent diet at first</p>
<p>and my clinic there are lots of ways to</p>
<p>do it I mean people can read a book</p>
<p>again if you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not on any</p>
<p>medications and don&rsquo;t have any serious</p>
<p>medical problems go out and get one of</p>
<p>the great resources now available or you</p>
<p>come to a clinic I take an hour in a</p>
<p>teaching class format so it&rsquo;s a group</p>
<p>group session so you know all the new</p>
<p>people come in get a full 30 to 45</p>
<p>minutes with me or my colleague dr. will</p>
<p>Yancey and so it&rsquo;s like a the model of</p>
<p>the clinic that we have is like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>referral</p>
<p>specialty clinic so other doctors will</p>
<p>send patients and I&rsquo;ll say their doctors</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get any training in weight loss</p>
<p>and I went out to eat special training</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all I do so I take a history</p>
<p>about the diet about the weight and</p>
<p>things that people have tried use a</p>
<p>one-hour class and you know one of the</p>
<p>aspects of the class that you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>from canned teaching out there or</p>
<p>reading a book is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>individualized so someone sits down for</p>
<p>an hour with me or with another teacher</p>
<p>they can ask questions that in their</p>
<p>mind you know everyone has a little</p>
<p>different way of looking at nutrition</p>
<p>for example you know you said I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have you know diet soda but can I have</p>
<p>carbonated water with flavor you know or</p>
<p>you know everyone has a unique way of</p>
<p>looking at the world and the nutrition</p>
<p>and so a class like that it&rsquo;s helpful in</p>
<p>that regard but it&rsquo;s not necessary I</p>
<p>mean now after the class I usually now</p>
<p>allow people to go about four weeks</p>
<p>without touching base with me I give</p>
<p>them you know email consult if they need</p>
<p>it in that time but so there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>initial evaluation the teaching and then</p>
<p>at one month a four-week follow-up visit</p>
<p>which works pretty well I like that I am</p>
<p>in practice I did seminars some three</p>
<p>times a week it was a mandatory</p>
<p>orientation and I basically didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>take them on unless they went through it</p>
<p>so I screened out a lot of people that</p>
<p>you know aren&rsquo;t gonna follow up anyway</p>
<p>so I wanted to really get the only the</p>
<p>people that were wanting to know about</p>
<p>it and they just became great clients</p>
<p>and better follow through so I think the</p>
<p>you know and they have to get this basic</p>
<p>data because you&rsquo;re basically stripping</p>
<p>off all the bad information and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting rid of these myths and one by</p>
<p>one but the people don&rsquo;t even know what</p>
<p>they what they have in their mind that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>false until you bring it up and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like right what you mean that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like no drinking orange juice every</p>
<p>morning is has a lot of sugar you know</p>
<p>even when you you know give the whole</p>
<p>spiel it&rsquo;s a lot of information and they</p>
<p>go out and there</p>
<p>you know life nutritionist dr. grocery</p>
<p>store clerk who ever you know church</p>
<p>friends at synagogue knit you know they</p>
<p>they get the information there you know</p>
<p>what are you doing this doesn&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>right and so the follow-up visits are</p>
<p>really important to focus people on this</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m pretty careful to say other ways</p>
<p>can work but that&rsquo;s just not the way</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing it and I like teaching</p>
<p>someone to drive on the left-hand side</p>
<p>of the road in a car it&rsquo;s a process you</p>
<p>learn to get in the car on the other</p>
<p>side and you you actually keep to the</p>
<p>left of the line they&rsquo;re not the right</p>
<p>of the line anyway so you don&rsquo;t need the</p>
<p>low fat foods out there you can have</p>
<p>full fat things anyway so that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an initial teaching and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that practical ok you&rsquo;ve tried it out to</p>
<p>it you come back and let&rsquo;s keep</p>
<p>adjusting it&rsquo;s another metaphor I use is</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like teaching someone to ride</p>
<p>a bike you know it after a while you</p>
<p>just did you get it and then you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need your parent or someone behind you</p>
<p>making sure you don&rsquo;t fall but you know</p>
<p>you might fall and you know you might</p>
<p>skinned your knee when you&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>to or bruise your ego in the keto world</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t do it quite right and a</p>
<p>good practitioner will help just kind of</p>
<p>in a supportive way through all of those</p>
<p>different things because we know that</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re gonna fall down if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna learn to ride a bike you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s right well you know I think</p>
<p>that one of things I was loved is</p>
<p>checking on your website and I really</p>
<p>find it interesting what you&rsquo;re evolving</p>
<p>into and you&rsquo;re going to be spreading</p>
<p>because you because here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a certain percentage very</p>
<p>high percentage of people that are on</p>
<p>medications and they&rsquo;re like ok I want</p>
<p>to do keto but then they have to work</p>
<p>with the medical doctor altum Utley the</p>
<p>ideal situation would be having places</p>
<p>at least one in every city a place where</p>
<p>you can go that someone&rsquo;s keto friendly</p>
<p>someone that actually educates you</p>
<p>someone you can bounce questions someone</p>
<p>that can help handle your medications</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not hardly anyone that I</p>
<p>know other</p>
<p>doing this except you you think right</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s four clinics but you sprint</p>
<p>you have these plans of expanding to</p>
<p>other clinics around the country and</p>
<p>plugging in doctors that are educated I</p>
<p>think that is going to be the way of the</p>
<p>future and I want to definitely support</p>
<p>you on that I think that also I want you</p>
<p>to before you explain it what what it is</p>
<p>I want people to I&rsquo;m gonna put a link</p>
<p>down below you can check out what dr.</p>
<p>Westman is up to and what&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>happening but you can actually even</p>
<p>invest in its clinics you can actually</p>
<p>support its clinics and you can donate</p>
<p>to expanding clinics around the country</p>
<p>and guys I had a comment before like oh</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a money-making thing</p>
<p>actually no it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s more like a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a on purpose thing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually because you believe it it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a new service yeah and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that is uh it&rsquo;s ultimately</p>
<p>gonna happen but it&rsquo;s gonna take someone</p>
<p>like you to just go out there and start</p>
<p>pushing it because it&rsquo;s a boulder you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going up against all these fixed ideas</p>
<p>however I know a lot of people watching</p>
<p>donate to various causes this would be a</p>
<p>very very good thing to donate on</p>
<p>something that actually is going to help</p>
<p>people for real and get results so maybe</p>
<p>you can summarize kind of what your plan</p>
<p>is to gonna put clinics or get doctors</p>
<p>educated and spread it yeah well it just</p>
<p>to be clear it&rsquo;s not a donation it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually owning part of the company okay</p>
<p>and this is kind of new to me I&rsquo;d never</p>
<p>been involved in a crowdsourcing equity</p>
<p>campaign so you&rsquo;re not just buying a</p>
<p>product early and then when the company</p>
<p>makes the product you get it that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>Kickstarter kind of thing this is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually the owning part of the company</p>
<p>but if the company gets profitable you</p>
<p>gain from that investment so but if you</p>
<p>think of it another way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>purchasing the ability to get a clinic</p>
<p>in your area for example so it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like you are buying something</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a it&rsquo;s actually equity and</p>
<p>stock in the company and you know part</p>
<p>of the I&rsquo;ve been doing this now 20 years</p>
<p>in research and twelve years in a</p>
<p>clinical setting in a university and</p>
<p>universities are not listening in fact</p>
<p>there was a paper published this year in</p>
<p>Pediatrics where individuals who were</p>
<p>doing a keto diet with type 1 diabetes</p>
<p>were surveyed and showed that they could</p>
<p>get off all this insulin they still</p>
<p>needed some but but it was a Facebook</p>
<p>survey that&rsquo;s going to be changing</p>
<p>academia and this is a anyway long story</p>
<p>short it it&rsquo;s the people changing the</p>
<p>academics so all of the work I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>the published papers didn&rsquo;t change</p>
<p>anything Wow and I want change what do I</p>
<p>do it well so I&rsquo;ve been going around</p>
<p>talking with people that the grassroots</p>
<p>and the grassroots can have to change us</p>
<p>which leads to it crowd sourcing equity</p>
<p>kind of campaign where individuals with</p>
<p>as little as four hundred and eighty</p>
<p>dollars can actually change the world</p>
<p>and well I finally stepped back and</p>
<p>realized with entrepreneurial minded</p>
<p>people coming to me that and and you</p>
<p>understand this with YouTube&rsquo;s internet</p>
<p>platform but to get to the millions of</p>
<p>people who need this we have to do</p>
<p>something beyond just an individual</p>
<p>doctors clinic all right so now the</p>
<p>strategy here is if you can&rsquo;t lead from</p>
<p>the top what you do is you get footholds</p>
<p>in all the different clinics so the</p>
<p>business model at which you can get to</p>
<p>at the heel clinics slash offering site</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all all in there at your leisure</p>
<p>you can look through your your</p>
<p>satisfaction but the business model is</p>
<p>we go in and get little footholds and</p>
<p>clinics we rent space and we do the</p>
<p>practice within a clinic that wants it</p>
<p>for their patients so there it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to be clinic policy change and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to go against the guidelines</p>
<p>and all this is so it&rsquo;s kind of like the</p>
<p>metaphor is like putting a Starbucks or</p>
<p>a coffee shop within a target shopping</p>
<p>center so established practice already</p>
<p>as you plug into a stylish practice and</p>
<p>then they want it for their patients and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>raining the doctor no well so no we we</p>
<p>trained our own people and we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>right at the moment we&rsquo;re using nurse</p>
<p>practitioners and pas the different</p>
<p>states allow it less expensive yeah and</p>
<p>they can be trained very well in a very</p>
<p>focused practice I believe and do a very</p>
<p>safe job I&rsquo;ve worked with lots of pas</p>
<p>and nurse practitioners over the years</p>
<p>so actually we don&rsquo;t train the doctor in</p>
<p>the clinic the doctor just wants it for</p>
<p>their patients they realize that they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do it themselves so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Target or a big store of benefits they</p>
<p>have a coffee shop there because more</p>
<p>people will come in they want coffee</p>
<p>they get the benefit and yet they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to make the coffee so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>friendly at least they&rsquo;re introduced to</p>
<p>it and I think as a first step this is</p>
<p>gonna be the desk because they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to see the results they&rsquo;re gonna go wow</p>
<p>I need to know more about I need to get</p>
<p>involved well then that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened in my area most doctors turn or</p>
<p>become interested when we share patients</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s almost like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>intellectual lazy like people are numb</p>
<p>doctors are numb to the science that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>presented right and what they but they</p>
<p>do value what happens right in front of</p>
<p>them yes so the more and more that we</p>
<p>share patients and show what kedo can do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how the grassroots can change the</p>
<p>system and so I&rsquo;ve given up on going in</p>
<p>change the system from above and then</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the policy gonna be you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>help you believe that which is against</p>
<p>the guideline no you don&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>any of that so it&rsquo;s like establishing a</p>
<p>little little beach Aikido friendly beat</p>
<p>heads if you will I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>brilliant I think that is I see that as</p>
<p>being and the wave of the future is</p>
<p>gonna happen and I&rsquo;m glad someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing that I just seem it&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>work and I so I&rsquo;d appreciate you</p>
<p>investing more energy in that can&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>it now with the mission so yeah right</p>
<p>and you you have a lot of credibility</p>
<p>and research so that&rsquo;s gonna be exciting</p>
<p>you also I think in your fourth clinic</p>
<p>or I was reading the website there was a</p>
<p>large</p>
<p>group of Doc&rsquo;s that are gonna be</p>
<p>involved in this in one of your clinics</p>
<p>or was it a university or what was it</p>
<p>you know so our optimal place to go is a</p>
<p>multi-specialty clinic where there might</p>
<p>be 50 doctors 50 a hundred doctors you</p>
<p>know 50 of them are internal medicine</p>
<p>diabetes the bread and butter medical</p>
<p>issues today</p>
<p>well not bread and cheese and butter</p>
<p>the conditions are diabetes and obesity</p>
<p>so an internist can&rsquo;t fix that they just</p>
<p>give drugs and so a multi-specialty</p>
<p>clinic will send all of their patients</p>
<p>to the healed clinic that would call it</p>
<p>the heal clinics a chi al for healthier</p>
<p>eating and living coming out and healing</p>
<p>but so they they&rsquo;ll send all other</p>
<p>patients so that for the heal clinic if</p>
<p>you put it in the right spot there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually no need for marketing because</p>
<p>all of the doctors want the clinic there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna send their patients</p>
<p>there because they want it for their</p>
<p>patients so we don&rsquo;t actually teach all</p>
<p>the doctors in the multi-specialty</p>
<p>clinic but that becomes the referral</p>
<p>source to populate the business for the</p>
<p>business model I think it would be great</p>
<p>because I would like to even post on the</p>
<p>website like just a list of all the</p>
<p>different class you can go to if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in that area but we need someone in</p>
<p>Virginia yeah I think you also have a</p>
<p>lot of connections to other medical</p>
<p>doctors like even cardiologists and</p>
<p>people that are doing keto and different</p>
<p>specialties I mean yeah you&rsquo;re I think I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know where I saw it that I was I</p>
<p>was kind of Wow there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>cardiologist oh that was on your um your</p>
<p>facebook on there&rsquo;s different videos</p>
<p>there was cardiologists using keynote as</p>
<p>fasiqun Aachen that was you know and I</p>
<p>have to just also credit you for putting</p>
<p>together the doctor birth keto Health</p>
<p>Summit in October just like the last</p>
<p>October because you brought Dave Feldman</p>
<p>and Ivor Cummins who speak a lot about</p>
<p>the cholesterol and so the cardiologists</p>
<p>are all up in arms the old cardiologists</p>
<p>because the total cholesterol and the</p>
<p>LDL can look worse</p>
<p>but the new way to look at a lipid</p>
<p>profile looking at the triglyceride and</p>
<p>the good HDL cholesterol actually just</p>
<p>about all the time someone on a keto</p>
<p>diet it looks better so yeah but there</p>
<p>are some established cardiologists who</p>
<p>are speaking out about this now you know</p>
<p>how Iver Cummins and dave pelman are not</p>
<p>medically established folks they&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of critics from the outside critiquing</p>
<p>what the medical world has done and so</p>
<p>dr. Eric thorne in Northern Virginia is</p>
<p>a cardiologist who uses this in his</p>
<p>practice and talks about it and dr.</p>
<p>nadir Ali is in Houston at the</p>
<p>University of Houston</p>
<p>then Brent sure SH er is a cardiologist</p>
<p>in Southern California but you know</p>
<p>these are individuals who are just</p>
<p>speaking out you know it&rsquo;s showing data</p>
<p>but having the ability to get beyond the</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s almost been like a taboo</p>
<p>for cardiologists to say anything other</p>
<p>than do a low-fat diet and and so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve broken out of the mold and I</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t see any academics in the u.s.</p>
<p>there was a conference that I went to in</p>
<p>Toronto put on by a Canadian cardiology</p>
<p>Association and we had a workshop there</p>
<p>dr. Blair O&rsquo;Neill is the past president</p>
<p>of that Association had all those</p>
<p>tremendous success on his own which is</p>
<p>usually what happens the story behind</p>
<p>this and then he asked me to come give a</p>
<p>workshop at the cardiology meeting in</p>
<p>Toronto and this just happened you know</p>
<p>six weeks ago and you know standing room</p>
<p>only</p>
<p>the doctors are the young doctors are on</p>
<p>to this I mean they don&rsquo;t have that old</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of the fat what am I going to</p>
<p>do they want to do what works but</p>
<p>cardiology as that&rsquo;s not like the last</p>
<p>vestige of you know when what about that</p>
<p>LDL you know now two-thirds of the time</p>
<p>it gets better but one 2/3 of the time</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing that well you need to do the</p>
<p>small LDL large LDL and even now I just</p>
<p>look at the triglyceride and HDL as the</p>
<p>main factors and the lipid profile</p>
<p>but so cardio they&rsquo;ll come around but um</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re there again they&rsquo;re drug focused</p>
<p>and like most medical doctors today it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s medication focused right well this</p>
<p>has been very enlightening guys if you</p>
<p>would like to spread a good message if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d like to learn more about this</p>
<p>these heal clinics I put a link down</p>
<p>below check it out</p>
<p>look at it read it and get involved it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a worthy cause and thank you so</p>
<p>much doc for being out here and uh my</p>
<p>pleasure</p>
<p>yep okay but keep up with dude doing</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>alright have a great great day</p>
