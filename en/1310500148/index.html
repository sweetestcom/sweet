    <p>The following is a conversation with Matthew Johnson,</p>
<p>a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science</p>
<p>at John Hopkins, and is one of the top scientists</p>
<p>in the world conducting seminal research on psychedelics.</p>
<p>This was one of the most eye opening</p>
<p>and fascinating conversations I&rsquo;ve ever had on this podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll talk with Matt many more times.</p>
<p>Quick mention of a sponsor followed by some thoughts</p>
<p>related to the episode.</p>
<p>Thank you to a new sponsor, Brave,</p>
<p>a fast browser that feels like Chrome</p>
<p>but has more privacy preserving features.</p>
<p>Neuro, the maker of functional sugar free gum and mints</p>
<p>that I use to give my brain a quick caffeine boost.</p>
<p>Four Sigmatic, the maker of delicious mushroom coffee,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just now realizing how ironic the set of sponsors are.</p>
<p>And Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that psychedelics</p>
<p>is an area of study that is fascinating to me</p>
<p>in that it gives hints that much of the magic</p>
<p>of our experience arises from just a few</p>
<p>chemical interactions in the brain</p>
<p>and that the nature of that experience can be expanded</p>
<p>through the tools of biology, chemistry, physics,</p>
<p>neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The fact that a world class scientist and researcher</p>
<p>like Matt can apply rigor to our study</p>
<p>of this mysterious and fascinating topic</p>
<p>is exciting to me beyond words.</p>
<p>As is the case with any of my colleagues</p>
<p>who dare to venture out into the darkness</p>
<p>of all that is unknown about the human mind</p>
<p>with both an openness of first principle thinking</p>
<p>and the rigor of the scientific method.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Matthew Johnson.</p>
<p>Can you give an introduction to psychedelics,</p>
<p>like a whirlwind overview?</p>
<p>Maybe what are psychedelics</p>
<p>and what are the kinds of psychedelics out there</p>
<p>and in whatever way you find meaningful to categorize?</p>
<p>Yeah, you can categorize them by their chemical structure.</p>
<p>So, phenethylamines, tryptamines, ergolines,</p>
<p>that is less of a meaningful way to classify them.</p>
<p>I think that their pharmacological activity,</p>
<p>their receptor activities are the best way.</p>
<p>Well, let me start even broader than that</p>
<p>because there I&rsquo;m talking about the classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>So, broadly speaking, when we say psychedelic,</p>
<p>that refers to, for most people,</p>
<p>a broad number of compounds</p>
<p>that work in different pharmacological ways.</p>
<p>So, it includes the so called classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>That includes psilocybin and psilocin,</p>
<p>which are in mushrooms, LSD, dimethyltryptamine or DMT,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in ayahuasca, people can smoke it too,</p>
<p>mescaline, which is in peyote in San Pedro, cactus.</p>
<p>And those all work by hitting a certain</p>
<p>subtype of serotonin receptor, the serotonin 2A receptor.</p>
<p>They act as agonists at that receptor.</p>
<p>Other compounds like PCP, ketamine, MDMA, ibogaine,</p>
<p>they all are more broadly speaking called psychedelics,</p>
<p>but they work by very different ways pharmacologically.</p>
<p>And they have some different effects,</p>
<p>including some subjective effects,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s enough of an overlap</p>
<p>in the subjective effects that, you know,</p>
<p>people informally refer to them as psychedelic.</p>
<p>And I think what that overlap is, you know,</p>
<p>compared to say, you know, caffeine and cocaine</p>
<p>and, you know, Ambien, et cetera, other psychoactive drugs</p>
<p>is that they have strong effects</p>
<p>in altering one&rsquo;s sense of reality</p>
<p>and including the sense of self.</p>
<p>And I should throw in there that cannabis,</p>
<p>more historically, like in the 70s,</p>
<p>has been called a minor psychedelic.</p>
<p>And I think with that latter definition,</p>
<p>it does fit that definition,</p>
<p>particularly if one doesn&rsquo;t have a tolerance.</p>
<p>So you mentioned serotonin, so most of the effect</p>
<p>comes from something around like the chemistry</p>
<p>around neurotransmitters and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s chemical interactions in the brain,</p>
<p>or is there other kinds of interactions</p>
<p>that have this kind of perception</p>
<p>and self awareness altering effects?</p>
<p>Well, as far as we know, all of the psychedelics</p>
<p>of all the different classes we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>their major activity is caused by receptor level events.</p>
<p>So either acting at the post receptor side of the synapse.</p>
<p>So in other words, neurotransmission operates</p>
<p>by, you know, one neuron releasing neurotransmitter</p>
<p>into a synapse, a gap between the two neurons.</p>
<p>And then the other neuron receives,</p>
<p>it has receptors that receives,</p>
<p>and then there can be an activation caused by that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a pitcher and a catcher.</p>
<p>So all of the major psychedelics work</p>
<p>by either acting as a pitcher,</p>
<p>mimicking a pitcher or a catcher.</p>
<p>So for example, the classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>they fit into the same catcher&rsquo;s mitt</p>
<p>on the post receptor, post synaptic receptor side</p>
<p>as serotonin itself.</p>
<p>But they do a slightly different thing to the cell,</p>
<p>to the neuron than serotonin does.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different signaling pathway</p>
<p>after that initial activation.</p>
<p>Something like MDMA works at the presynaptic side,</p>
<p>the pitcher side.</p>
<p>And basically it floods the synapse or the gap</p>
<p>between the cells with a bunch of serotonin,</p>
<p>the natural neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the pitcher in a baseball game</p>
<p>all of a sudden just starts throwing balls</p>
<p>like every second.</p>
<p>Everything we&rsquo;re talking about is it often more natural,</p>
<p>meaning found in the natural world.</p>
<p>You mentioned cacti, cactus,</p>
<p>or is it chemically manufactured,</p>
<p>like artificially in the lab?</p>
<p>So the classic psychedelics, there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>What are the classics?</p>
<p>So using terminology that&rsquo;s not chemical terminology,</p>
<p>not like the terminology you see in titles of papers,</p>
<p>academic papers, but more sort of common parlance.</p>
<p>Right, it would be good to kind of define their effects,</p>
<p>like how they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>And so it includes LSD, psilocybin,</p>
<p>which is in mushrooms, mescaline, DMT.</p>
<p>Which one is mescaline?</p>
<p>Mescaline is in the different cacti.</p>
<p>So the one most people will know is peyote,</p>
<p>but it also shows up in San Pedro or Peruvian torch.</p>
<p>And all of these classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>they have, at the right dose,</p>
<p>and typically they have very strong effects</p>
<p>on one sense of reality and one sense of self.</p>
<p>Some of the things that makes them different</p>
<p>than other more broadly speaking psychedelics,</p>
<p>like MDMA and others,</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re, at least the major examples,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some exotic ones that differ,</p>
<p>but the ones I&rsquo;ve talked about are extremely safe</p>
<p>at the physiological level.</p>
<p>Like LSD and psilocybin, there&rsquo;s no known lethal overdose,</p>
<p>unless you have like really severe heart disease,</p>
<p>because it modestly raises your blood pressure.</p>
<p>So same person that might be hurt traveling snow</p>
<p>or going up the stairs, that could have a cardiac event</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve taken one of these drugs.</p>
<p>But for most people, someone could take a thousand times</p>
<p>what the effective dose is,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna cause any organ damage,</p>
<p>affect the brainstem, make them stop breathing.</p>
<p>So in that sense, they&rsquo;re freakishly safe at the physiolo&hellip;</p>
<p>I would never call any compounds safe,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s always a risk.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re freakishly safe at the physiological level.</p>
<p>I mean, you can hardly find anything over the counter</p>
<p>like that, I mean, aspirin&rsquo;s not like that.</p>
<p>Caffeine is not like that.</p>
<p>Most drugs, you take five, 10, 20, maybe it takes 100,</p>
<p>but you get to some times the effective dose,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna kill you or cause some serious damage.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s remarkable</p>
<p>about most of these classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible, by the way,</p>
<p>that you can go on a hell of a journey in the mind,</p>
<p>like probably transformative,</p>
<p>potentially in a deeply transformative way,</p>
<p>and yet there&rsquo;s no dose</p>
<p>that in most people would have a lethal effect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this duality between the mind and the body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, sorry if I bring them up way too much,</p>
<p>but David Goggins is like,</p>
<p>the kind of things you go on in the long run,</p>
<p>like the hell you might go through in your mind.</p>
<p>Your mind can take a lot,</p>
<p>and you can go through a lot with the mind,</p>
<p>and the body will just be its own thing.</p>
<p>You can go through hell,</p>
<p>but after a good night&rsquo;s sleep, be back to normal,</p>
<p>and the body&rsquo;s always there.</p>
<p>So bringing it back to Goggins,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you can do that</p>
<p>without even destroying your knee or whatever,</p>
<p>or coming close and riding that line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So the unfortunate thing about the running,</p>
<p>which he uses running to test the mind,</p>
<p>so the aspect of running that is negative,</p>
<p>in order to test the mind,</p>
<p>you really have to push the body,</p>
<p>take the body through a journey.</p>
<p>I wish there was another way of doing that</p>
<p>in the physical exercise space.</p>
<p>I think there are exercises</p>
<p>that are easier on the body than others,</p>
<p>but running sure is a hell of an effective way to do it.</p>
<p>And one of the ways that where it differs</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re unlike exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially, most exercise,</p>
<p>to really get to those intense levels,</p>
<p>you really need to be persistent about it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;ll be intense if you&rsquo;re really out of shape,</p>
<p>just jogging for five minutes,</p>
<p>but to really get to those intense levels,</p>
<p>you need to have the dedication.</p>
<p>And so some of the other ways</p>
<p>of altering subjective effects or states of consciousness,</p>
<p>take that type of dedication.</p>
<p>Psychedelics though, I mean, someone takes the right dose.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re strapped into the rollercoaster</p>
<p>and something interesting is gonna happen.</p>
<p>And I really like what you said about that distinction</p>
<p>between the mind or the contrast between the mind effects</p>
<p>and the body effects,</p>
<p>because I think of this,</p>
<p>I do research with all the drugs,</p>
<p>caffeine, alcohol, methamphetamine, cocaine,</p>
<p>alcohol, legal, illegal.</p>
<p>Most of these drugs, thinking about say cocaine</p>
<p>and methamphetamine, you can&rsquo;t give to a regular user,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t safely give a dose where the regular cocaine user</p>
<p>is gonna say, oh man, that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the strongest coke I&rsquo;ve ever had, you know,</p>
<p>because you get it past the ethics committee</p>
<p>and you need approval.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna give someone something that&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>So to go to those levels where they would say that,</p>
<p>you would have to give something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s physiologically riskier, you know.</p>
<p>Psilocybin or LSD, you can give a dose</p>
<p>at the physiological level that is like very good chance</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be the most intense psychological experience</p>
<p>of that person&rsquo;s life and have zero chance</p>
<p>for most people if you screen them of killing them.</p>
<p>The big risk is behavioral toxicity,</p>
<p>which is a fancy way of saying doing something stupid.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re really intoxicated,</p>
<p>like if you wander into traffic or you fall from a height,</p>
<p>just like plenty of people do on high doses of alcohol.</p>
<p>And the other kind of unique thing</p>
<p>about classic psychedelics is that they&rsquo;re not addictive,</p>
<p>which is pretty much unheard of when it comes</p>
<p>to so called drugs of abuse or drugs that people,</p>
<p>at least at some frequency choose to take, you know,</p>
<p>most of what we think of as drugs, you know,</p>
<p>even caffeine, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis,</p>
<p>most of these you can get into alcohol,</p>
<p>you can get into a daily use pattern.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just extreme, so unheard of with psychedelics.</p>
<p>Most people have taken these things on a daily basis,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of like they&rsquo;re building up the courage to do it</p>
<p>and then they build up a tolerance or yeah,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in college and they do it on a dare,</p>
<p>can you take take acid seven days in a row</p>
<p>and that type of thing rather than a self control issue</p>
<p>where you have and say, oh God, I gotta stop taking this,</p>
<p>I gotta stop drinking every night,</p>
<p>I gotta cut down on the coke, whatever.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>What are the, what&rsquo;s a good term, modern psychedelics</p>
<p>or more maybe psychedelics that are created in the lab?</p>
<p>What else is there?</p>
<p>Right, so MDMA is the big one.</p>
<p>And I should say that with the classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>that LSD is sort of, you can call it a semi synthetic</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s natural from both ergot</p>
<p>and in certain seeds, morning glory seeds as one example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very close,</p>
<p>there are some very close chemical relatives of LSD.</p>
<p>So LSD is close to what occurs in nature, but not quite.</p>
<p>But then when we get into the other non classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>probably the most prominent one is MDMA,</p>
<p>people call it ecstasy, people call it Molly.</p>
<p>And it is, it differs from classic psychedelics</p>
<p>in a number of ways, it can be addictive, but not so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can have cocaine on this end</p>
<p>of the continuum and classic psychedelics here.</p>
<p>Continuum of addiction.</p>
<p>Continuum of addiction, you know,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s certainly no cocaine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty rare for people to get into daily use patterns,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s possible and they can get into more like,</p>
<p>you know, using once a week pattern</p>
<p>where they can find it hard to stop,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s somewhere in between mostly towards the,</p>
<p>to the classic psychedelic side in terms of</p>
<p>like relatively little addiction potential.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also more physiologically dangerous.</p>
<p>I think that the, certainly the therapeutic use,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s showing really promising effects for treating PTSD</p>
<p>and the models that are used,</p>
<p>I think those are extremely acceptable</p>
<p>when it comes to the risk benefit ratio</p>
<p>that you see all throughout medicine.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, we do know that at a certain dose</p>
<p>and a certain frequency that MDMA can cause longterm damage</p>
<p>to the serotonin system in the brain.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have that level of kind of freakish</p>
<p>bodily safety that the classic psychedelics do.</p>
<p>And it has more of a heart load, a cardiovascular,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean kind of emotion, I mean, in this sense,</p>
<p>although it is very emotional</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something unique about its subjective effects,</p>
<p>subjective effects, but it&rsquo;s more of a oppressor.</p>
<p>And the terminology you use instead of</p>
<p>like a freakish capacities,</p>
<p>allowing you from a researcher perspective,</p>
<p>but a personal perspective too,</p>
<p>of taking a journey with some of these psychedelics</p>
<p>that is the heroic dose, as they say.</p>
<p>So like these are tools that allow you</p>
<p>to take a serious mental journey, whatever that is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you mean.</p>
<p>And with MDMA, there&rsquo;s a little bit,</p>
<p>it starts entering this territory</p>
<p>where you gotta be careful about the risks</p>
<p>to the body potentially.</p>
<p>So yes, that in the sense that you can&rsquo;t kind of</p>
<p>push the dose up as high as you safely as one can,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re in the right setting, like in our research</p>
<p>as they can with the classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>But probably more importantly,</p>
<p>just the nature of the effects with MDMA</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t the full on psychedelic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the full journey.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of a psychedelic with rose colored glasses on.</p>
<p>A psychedelic that&rsquo;s more of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been called more of a heart trip than a head trip.</p>
<p>The nature of reality doesn&rsquo;t unravel</p>
<p>as frequently as it does with classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re able to more directly sense your environment.</p>
<p>So your perception system still works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not completely detached from reality with MDMA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, relatively speaking.</p>
<p>That said at most doses of classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>you still have a tether to reality.</p>
<p>Changes a little bit when you&rsquo;re talking about smoking DMT</p>
<p>or smoking 5 methoxy DMT,</p>
<p>which are some interesting examples</p>
<p>we could talk more about.</p>
<p>But with MDMA, for example,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very rare to have what&rsquo;s called an ego loss experience</p>
<p>or a sense of transcendental unity,</p>
<p>where one really seemingly loses</p>
<p>the psychological construct of the self.</p>
<p>But MDMA, it&rsquo;s very common for people to have this,</p>
<p>they still are perceiving themselves as a self,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s common for them to have this warmth,</p>
<p>this empathy for humanity</p>
<p>and for their friends and loved ones.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more, and you see those effects</p>
<p>under the classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a subset of what the classic psychedelics do.</p>
<p>So I see MDMA in terms of its subjective effects</p>
<p>is if you think about Venn diagrams,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of MDMA is all within the classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>So everything that you see on a particular MDMA session,</p>
<p>sometimes a psilocybin session looks just like that,</p>
<p>but then sometimes it&rsquo;s completely different with psilocybin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little more narrowed</p>
<p>in terms of the variability with MDMA.</p>
<p>Is there something general to say about what the psychedelics</p>
<p>do to the human mind?</p>
<p>You mentioned kind of an ego loss experience</p>
<p>in the space of Venn diagrams.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re to like draw a big circle,</p>
<p>what can we say about that big circle?</p>
<p>In terms of people&rsquo;s report of subjective experience,</p>
<p>probably one of the most general things we can say</p>
<p>is that it expands that range.</p>
<p>So many people come out of these sessions</p>
<p>saying that they didn&rsquo;t know it was possible</p>
<p>to have an experience like that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an emphasis on the subjective experience</p>
<p>that is there words that people put to it</p>
<p>that capture that experience</p>
<p>or is it something that just has to be experienced?</p>
<p>Yeah, people like&hellip;</p>
<p>As a researcher, that&rsquo;s an interesting question</p>
<p>because you have to kind of measure the effects of this</p>
<p>and how do you convert that into numbers?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ultimate challenge.</p>
<p>So is that possible to one, convert it into words</p>
<p>and the second, convert the words into numbers somehow?</p>
<p>So we do a lot of that with questionnaires,</p>
<p>some of which are very psychometrically validated.</p>
<p>So lots of numbers have been crunched on them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always a limitation with questionnaires.</p>
<p>I mean, subjective effects are subjective effects.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s what the person is reporting</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily point towards a ground truth.</p>
<p>So for example, if someone says</p>
<p>that they felt like they touched another dimension</p>
<p>or they felt like they sensed the reality of God</p>
<p>or if they, I mean, just you name it,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s ontological views can sometimes shift.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s more about where they&rsquo;re coming from</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the quintessential way</p>
<p>in which they work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of people that hold</p>
<p>onto a completely naturalistic viewpoint</p>
<p>and have profound and helpful experiences</p>
<p>with these compounds.</p>
<p>But the subjective effects can be so broad</p>
<p>that for some people, it shifts their philosophical</p>
<p>viewpoint more towards idealism,</p>
<p>more towards thinking that the nature of reality</p>
<p>might be more about consciousness than about material.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a domain I&rsquo;m very interested in.</p>
<p>Right now, we have essentially zero to say about that</p>
<p>in terms of validating those types of claims,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s even interesting just to see</p>
<p>what people say along those lines.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re interested in saying like,</p>
<p>can we more rigorously study this process of expansion?</p>
<p>Like, what do we mean by this expansion</p>
<p>of your sense of what is possible</p>
<p>in the experiences in this world?</p>
<p>Right, as much as what we can say about that</p>
<p>through naturalistic psychology,</p>
<p>especially as much as we can root it</p>
<p>to solid psychological constructs</p>
<p>and solid neuroscientific constructs.</p>
<p>And I wonder what the impact is of the language</p>
<p>that you bring to the table.</p>
<p>So you mentioned about God or speaking of God,</p>
<p>a lot of people are really into sort of</p>
<p>theoretical physics these days at a very surface level</p>
<p>and you can bring the language of physics, right?</p>
<p>You can talk about quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>you can talk about general relativity</p>
<p>and curvature of space time and using just that language</p>
<p>without a deep technical understanding of it</p>
<p>to somehow start thinking like,</p>
<p>sort of visualizing atoms in your head</p>
<p>and somehow through that process</p>
<p>because you have the language,</p>
<p>using that language to kind of dissolve the ego,</p>
<p>like realize like that we&rsquo;re just all little bits</p>
<p>of physical objects that behave in mysterious ways.</p>
<p>And so that has to do with the language.</p>
<p>Like if you read a Sean Carroll book or something recently,</p>
<p>it seems like it has a huge influence</p>
<p>on the way you might experience,</p>
<p>might perceive the world and might experience</p>
<p>the alteration that psychedelics brings</p>
<p>to your perception system.</p>
<p>So I wonder like the language you bring to the table,</p>
<p>how that affects the journey you go on with the psychedelics.</p>
<p>I think very much so.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m a little concerned</p>
<p>some of the science is going a little too far</p>
<p>in the direction of around the edges,</p>
<p>speaking about it changing beliefs in this sense</p>
<p>or that sense about particular, in particular domains.</p>
<p>And I think what really what a lot of what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>is what you just discussed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the priors coming into it.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of physics,</p>
<p>then you might bring up like space time</p>
<p>and interpret the experience in that sense.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for people come out</p>
<p>talking about visions of the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the most typical thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s come up in sessions I&rsquo;ve guided,</p>
<p>the Big Bang and this sort of nature of reality.</p>
<p>I think probably that the best way to think</p>
<p>about these experiences is that,</p>
<p>and the best evidence,</p>
<p>even though we&rsquo;re in our infancy and understanding it,</p>
<p>they really tap into more general psychological mechanisms.</p>
<p>I think one of the best arguments</p>
<p>is they reduce the influence of our priors,</p>
<p>of what we bring into all of the assumptions</p>
<p>that we all that we&rsquo;re essentially,</p>
<p>especially as adults, we&rsquo;re riding on top of heuristic</p>
<p>after heuristic to get through life.</p>
<p>And you need to do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s extremely efficient</p>
<p>and evolution has shaped that,</p>
<p>but that comes at an expense.</p>
<p>And it seems that these experiences</p>
<p>will allow someone greater mental flexibility and openness.</p>
<p>And so one can be both less influenced</p>
<p>by their prior assumptions,</p>
<p>but still nonetheless the nature of the experience</p>
<p>can be influenced by what they&rsquo;ve been exposed to</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>And sometimes they can get it in a deeper way.</p>
<p>Like maybe they&rsquo;ve read,</p>
<p>I mean, I had a philosophy professor one time</p>
<p>as a participant in a high dose psilocybin study.</p>
<p>And I remember him saying, my God,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like Hegel&rsquo;s opposites defining each other.</p>
<p>Like, I get it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taught this thing for years and years and years.</p>
<p>Like, I get it now.</p>
<p>And so like that, you know,</p>
<p>and even at the psychological, emotional level,</p>
<p>like the cancer patients we worked with,</p>
<p>you know, they told themselves a million times</p>
<p>over this people trying to quit smoking,</p>
<p>I need to quit smoking.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m ruining my life with this cancer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still healthy.</p>
<p>I should be getting out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m letting this thing defeat me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, you told yourself that in your head,</p>
<p>but sometimes they had these experiences</p>
<p>and they kind of feel it in their heart.</p>
<p>Like they really get it.</p>
<p>So in some sense that you bring some prize to the table,</p>
<p>but psychedelics allow you to acknowledge them</p>
<p>and then throw them away.</p>
<p>So like one popular terminology around this</p>
<p>in the engineering space is first principles thinking</p>
<p>that Elon Musk, for example, espouses a lot.</p>
<p>Let me ask a fun question</p>
<p>before we return to a more serious discussion.</p>
<p>With Elon Musk as an example,</p>
<p>but it could be just engineers in general,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s a use for psychedelics</p>
<p>to take a journey of rigorous first principles thinking?</p>
<p>So like throwing away,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking about throwing away assumptions</p>
<p>about the nature of reality in terms of like our philosophy</p>
<p>of the way we live day to day life,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re talking about like how to build a better rocket</p>
<p>or how to build a better car</p>
<p>or how to build a better social network</p>
<p>or all those kinds of things, engineering questions.</p>
<p>I absolutely think there&rsquo;s huge potential there.</p>
<p>And there was some research in the late 60s, early 70s</p>
<p>that were, it was very early and not very rigorous</p>
<p>in terms of methodology, but it was consistent with the,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just countless anecdotes of folks.</p>
<p>I mean, people have argued that just,</p>
<p>Silicon Valley was largely influenced</p>
<p>by psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>I remember the, I think the person that came up</p>
<p>with the concept of freeware or shareware,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it kind of was generated out of</p>
<p>or influenced by psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>So to this, I think there&rsquo;s incredible potential there</p>
<p>and we know really next,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no rigorous research on that, but.</p>
<p>Is there anecdotal stuff like with Steve Jobs?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s stories, right?</p>
<p>In your exploration of that,</p>
<p>is there something a little bit more than just stories?</p>
<p>Is there like a little bit more of a solid data points,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re just experiential like anecdotes?</p>
<p>Is there something that you draw inspiration from</p>
<p>like in your intuition?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ll talk about,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to construct studies</p>
<p>that are more rigorous around these questions.</p>
<p>But is there something you draw inspiration from,</p>
<p>from the past, from the 80s and the 90s</p>
<p>and Silicon Valley, that kind of space?</p>
<p>Or is it just like you have a sense</p>
<p>based on everything you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>and these kind of loose stories</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something worth digging at?</p>
<p>I am influenced by the, gosh,</p>
<p>the just incredible number of anecdotes surrounding these.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>Carey Mullis, he invented PCR.</p>
<p>I mean, absolutely revolutionized biological sciences.</p>
<p>He says he wouldn&rsquo;t have won the Nobel Prize for him.</p>
<p>He said he wouldn&rsquo;t have come up with that</p>
<p>had he not had psychedelic experiences.</p>
<p>Now, he&rsquo;s an interesting character.</p>
<p>People should read his autobiography</p>
<p>because you could point to other things he was into.</p>
<p>But I think that speaks to the casting your nets wide</p>
<p>and this mental flex,</p>
<p>more of these general mechanisms</p>
<p>where sometimes if you cast your nets really wide</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna depend on the person</p>
<p>and their influences,</p>
<p>but sometimes you come up with false positives.</p>
<p>You connect the dots</p>
<p>where maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t have connected those dots,</p>
<p>but I think that can be constrained.</p>
<p>And so much of our,</p>
<p>not only our personal psychological suffering,</p>
<p>but our limitations academically</p>
<p>and in terms of technology</p>
<p>are because of the self imposed limitations</p>
<p>and heuristics, these entrenched ways of thinking.</p>
<p>Like those examples throughout the history of science</p>
<p>where someone has come up with the paradigm,</p>
<p>Kuhn&rsquo;s paradigm shifts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s something completely different.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t make sense by any of the previous models.</p>
<p>And like, we need more of those.</p>
<p>And then you need the right balance between that</p>
<p>because so many of the novel crazy ideas are just bunk</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what science is about separating them</p>
<p>from the valid paradigm shifting ideas.</p>
<p>But we need more paradigm shifting ideas like in a big way.</p>
<p>And I think we could,</p>
<p>I think you could argue that we&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>because of the structure of academia and science</p>
<p>in modern times, it heavily biases against those.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s all kinds of mechanisms in our human nature</p>
<p>that resist paradigm shift quite sort of obviously.</p>
<p>So, and psychedelics, there could be a lot of other tools</p>
<p>but it seems like psychedelics could be one set of tools</p>
<p>that encourage paradigm shifting thinking.</p>
<p>So like the first principles kind of thinking.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a kind of, you&rsquo;re at the forefront of research here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just kind of anecdotal stories.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s early studies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense that we don&rsquo;t understand very much</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of depth here.</p>
<p>How do we get from there to where Elon and I can regularly,</p>
<p>like I wake up every morning, I have deep work sessions</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s well understood like what dose to take.</p>
<p>Like if I want to explore something where it&rsquo;s all legal,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s all understood and safe, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>How do we get from where we are today to there?</p>
<p>Not speaking in terms of legality in the sense like</p>
<p>policy making all that like laws and stuff,</p>
<p>meaning like how do we scientifically understand this stuff</p>
<p>well enough to get to a place where I can just take it safely</p>
<p>in order to expand my thinking,</p>
<p>like this kind of first principles thinking,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m in my personal life currently doing.</p>
<p>Like how do I revolutionize particular several things?</p>
<p>Like it seems like the only tools I have right now</p>
<p>is just, just, but my mind going, doing the first principles</p>
<p>like, wait, wait, wait, okay.</p>
<p>Why has this been done this way?</p>
<p>Can we do it completely differently?</p>
<p>It seems like I&rsquo;m still tethered to the priors</p>
<p>that I bring to the table</p>
<p>and I keep trying to untether myself.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s tools that can systematically</p>
<p>help me untether.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we need experiments and that&rsquo;s tied to</p>
<p>kind of the policy level stuff.</p>
<p>And I should be clear,</p>
<p>I would never encourage anyone to do anything illicitly.</p>
<p>But yeah, in the future, we could see these compounds</p>
<p>used for technical and scientific innovation.</p>
<p>What we need are studies that are digging into that.</p>
<p>Right now, most of what the funding,</p>
<p>which is largely from philanthropy, not from the government,</p>
<p>largely what it&rsquo;s for is treatment of mental disorders</p>
<p>like addiction and depression, et cetera.</p>
<p>But we need studies.</p>
<p>One of the early initial stabs on this question decades ago</p>
<p>was they took some architects and engineers</p>
<p>and said, what problems have you been working on?</p>
<p>Where have you been stuck for months</p>
<p>like working on this damn thing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not getting anywhere,</p>
<p>like your head&rsquo;s butting up against the wall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, come in here, take,</p>
<p>and I think it was 100 micrograms of LSD.</p>
<p>So not a big session.</p>
<p>And a little bit different model</p>
<p>where they were actually working.</p>
<p>It was a moderate enough dose</p>
<p>where they could work on the problem during the session.</p>
<p>I think probably, I&rsquo;m an empiricist,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;d like to see all the studies done.</p>
<p>But the first thing I would do is like</p>
<p>a really high dose session where you&rsquo;re not necessarily</p>
<p>in front of your computer,</p>
<p>which you can&rsquo;t really do on a really high dose.</p>
<p>And then the work has been talked about,</p>
<p>like you take a really high dose, you take a journey,</p>
<p>and then the breakthroughs come</p>
<p>from when you return from the journey</p>
<p>and like integrate, quote unquote, that experience.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where all the,</p>
<p>again, we&rsquo;re babies at this point,</p>
<p>but my gut tells me that it&rsquo;s the so called integration,</p>
<p>the aftermath.</p>
<p>We know that there&rsquo;s some different forms of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>that are unfolding in the days following a psychedelics,</p>
<p>at least in animals, probably going on humans.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s related to the therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>My gut tells me it is,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s only part of the story,</p>
<p>but we need big studies where we compare people,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s get a hundred people like that,</p>
<p>scientists that are working on a problem,</p>
<p>and then randomize them too.</p>
<p>And then I think you need even more credible,</p>
<p>active controls or active placebo conditions</p>
<p>to kind of tease this out.</p>
<p>And then also in conjunction with that,</p>
<p>and you can do this in the same study,</p>
<p>you wanna combine that with more rigorous</p>
<p>sort of experimental models</p>
<p>where we actually give there a problem solving tasks</p>
<p>that we know, for example, that you tend to do better on</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;ve gotten a good night&rsquo;s sleep versus not.</p>
<p>And my sense is there&rsquo;s a relationship there.</p>
<p>People go back to first principles,</p>
<p>questioning those first principles they&rsquo;re operating under</p>
<p>and getting away from their priors</p>
<p>in terms of creative problem solving.</p>
<p>And so I think wrap those things</p>
<p>and you could speak a little more rigorously about those</p>
<p>because ultimately, if everyone&rsquo;s bringing their own problem,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more in the face valid side,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t dig in as much</p>
<p>and get as much experimental power</p>
<p>and speak to the mechanisms as you can</p>
<p>with having everyone do the same sort of canned</p>
<p>problem solving task.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been speaking about psychedelics generally.</p>
<p>Is there one you find from the scientific perspective</p>
<p>or maybe even philosophical perspective</p>
<p>most fascinating to study?</p>
<p>Therapeutically, I&rsquo;m most interested in psilocybin and LSD</p>
<p>and I think we need to do a lot more with LSD</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s mainly been psilocybin in the modern era.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently gotten a grant</p>
<p>from the Heftar Research Institute to do an LSD study.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t started it yet,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going through the paperwork and everything.</p>
<p>Therapeutic meaning there&rsquo;s some issue</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to treat that issue.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>In terms of just like, what&rsquo;s the most fascinating,</p>
<p>understanding the nature of these experiences,</p>
<p>if you really wanna like wrap your head around</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on when someone has a completely altered sense</p>
<p>of reality and sense of self,</p>
<p>there I think you&rsquo;re talking about the high dose,</p>
<p>either smoked vaporized or intravenous injection,</p>
<p>which all kind of, they&rsquo;re very similar pharmacologically,</p>
<p>of DMT and 5 methoxy DMT.</p>
<p>This is like when people, this is what,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with Terrence McKenna,</p>
<p>he would talk a lot about smoking DMT,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan has talked a lot about that.</p>
<p>People will say that,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a close relative called 5 methoxy DMT.</p>
<p>Most people who know the terrain will say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an order of magnitude or orders of magnitude beyond,</p>
<p>I mean, anything one could get from even a high dose</p>
<p>of psilocybin or LSD.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a question about whether, you know,</p>
<p>how therapeutic,</p>
<p>I think there is a therapeutic potential there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably not as sure of a bet</p>
<p>because one goes so far out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re not contemplating</p>
<p>their relationship and their direction in life.</p>
<p>They are like reality is ripping apart at the seams</p>
<p>and the very nature of the self and of the sense of reality.</p>
<p>And the amazing thing about these compounds</p>
<p>and same to a less degree with oral psilocybin and LSD</p>
<p>is that unlike some other drugs</p>
<p>that really throw you far out there,</p>
<p>you know, anesthetics and even alcohol,</p>
<p>like as reality starts to become different</p>
<p>at higher and higher doses, there&rsquo;s this numbing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this sort of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this ability for the sense of being the center,</p>
<p>having a conscious experience that&rsquo;s memorable,</p>
<p>that is maintained</p>
<p>throughout these classic psychedelic experiences.</p>
<p>Like one can go as far, so far out while still</p>
<p>being aware of the experience</p>
<p>and remembering the experience.</p>
<p>Interesting, so being able to carry something back.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Can you dig in a little deeper, like what is DMT,</p>
<p>how long is the trip usually,</p>
<p>like how much do we understand about it?</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to say</p>
<p>about just the nature of the experience</p>
<p>and what we understand about it?</p>
<p>One of the common methods for people to use it</p>
<p>is to smoke it or vaporize it.</p>
<p>And it usually takes,</p>
<p>this is a pretty good kind of description</p>
<p>of what it might feel like on the ground.</p>
<p>The caveat is it&rsquo;s a completely insufficient description</p>
<p>that someone&rsquo;s gonna be listening to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like nothing you could say is gonna come close.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;ll take about three big hits, inhalations,</p>
<p>in order to have what people call a breakthrough dose.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no great definition of that,</p>
<p>but basically meaning moving away from,</p>
<p>not just having the typical psilocybin or LSD experience</p>
<p>where like things are radically different,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still basically a person in this reality</p>
<p>to go in somewhere else.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;ll typically take like three hits.</p>
<p>And this stuff comes on like a freight train.</p>
<p>So one takes a hit</p>
<p>and around the time of the first exhalation,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re talking about a few seconds in,</p>
<p>or maybe just sometime between the first and the second hit,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;ll start to come on.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re already up to, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>what they might get from a 30 milligram</p>
<p>or 300 microgram LSD trip, a big trip.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already there at the second hit,</p>
<p>but their consciousness is geared,</p>
<p>this is like acceleration, not speed, to speak of physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like those receptors are getting filled like that</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going from zero to 60 in like Tesla time.</p>
<p>And at the second hit, again,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re at maybe the strongest psychedelic experience</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>And then if they can take that third hit,</p>
<p>and some people can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re propelled into this other reality.</p>
<p>And the nature of that other reality will differ</p>
<p>depending on who you ask,</p>
<p>but folks will often talk about it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done some survey research on this.</p>
<p>Entities of different types, elves tend to pop up.</p>
<p>The caveat is that I strongly presume</p>
<p>all of this is culturally influenced,</p>
<p>but thinking more about the psychology and the neuroscience,</p>
<p>there is probably something fundamental,</p>
<p>like for someone that might be colored as elves,</p>
<p>others that might be colored as,</p>
<p>Terrence McKenna called them self dribbling basketballs.</p>
<p>For someone else, it might be little animals</p>
<p>or someone else, it might be aliens.</p>
<p>I think that probably is dependent on who they are</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;ve been exposed to.</p>
<p>But just the fact that one has this sense</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re surrounded by autonomous entities.</p>
<p>Right, intelligent autonomous entities.</p>
<p>Right, and people come back with stories</p>
<p>that are just astonishing.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s communication between these,</p>
<p>communication between these entities</p>
<p>and often they&rsquo;re telling them things</p>
<p>that the person says are self validating,</p>
<p>but it seems like it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>Like it really seems like, and again,</p>
<p>this is what people say oftentimes,</p>
<p>that it really is like downloading some intelligence</p>
<p>from a higher dimension or some whatever metaphor</p>
<p>you wanna use.</p>
<p>Sometimes these things come up in dreams</p>
<p>like someone is exposed to something that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this in a dream,</p>
<p>where it seems like what they are being exposed to</p>
<p>is physically impossible,</p>
<p>but yet at the same time self validating, it seems true.</p>
<p>Like they really are figuring something out.</p>
<p>Of course, the challenge is to say something</p>
<p>in concrete terms after the experience</p>
<p>where you could verify that in any way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not familiar of any examples of that.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a sense in which I suppose the experience</p>
<p>is like you&rsquo;re a limited cognitive creature</p>
<p>that knows very little about the world</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s a chance to communicate</p>
<p>with much wiser entities that in a way</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t possibly understand</p>
<p>are trying to give you hints of deeper truths.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s that kind of sense</p>
<p>that you can take something back,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t where our cognition is not capable</p>
<p>to fully grasp the truth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just get a kind of sense of it</p>
<p>and somehow that process is mind expanding</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a greater truth out there.</p>
<p>That seems like what from the people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard talk about that seems to be what it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so fascinating that there&rsquo;s fundamentally</p>
<p>to this whole thing is a communication</p>
<p>between an entity that is other than yourself, entities.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just like a visual experience</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re like floating through the world</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s other beings there,</p>
<p>which is kind of, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to sort of,</p>
<p>from a person who likes Freud and Carl Jung,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to think about that.</p>
<p>That being of course from one perspective</p>
<p>is just you looking in the mirror.</p>
<p>But it could also be from another perspective</p>
<p>like actually talking to other beings.</p>
<p>Yeah, you mentioned Jung</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s particularly interesting</p>
<p>and it kind of points to something</p>
<p>I was thinking about saying is that,</p>
<p>I think what might be going on</p>
<p>from a naturalistic perspective.</p>
<p>So regardless, whether or not there are,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t depend on autonomous entities out there.</p>
<p>What might be happening is that just the associative net,</p>
<p>the level of learning,</p>
<p>the comprehension might be so beyond what someone is used to</p>
<p>that the only way for the nervous system,</p>
<p>for the aware sense of self to orient towards it</p>
<p>is all by metaphor.</p>
<p>And so I do think,</p>
<p>when we get into these realms as a strong empiricist,</p>
<p>I think we always gotta be careful</p>
<p>and be as grounded as possible,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also willing to speculate</p>
<p>and sort of cast the nets wide with caveat.</p>
<p>But I think of things like archetypes</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s plausible that there are certain stories,</p>
<p>there are certain,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve gone through millions of years of evolution.</p>
<p>It may be that we have certain characters and stories</p>
<p>that our central nervous system is sort of wired</p>
<p>to tend to.</p>
<p>Yeah, those stories, we carry those stories in us.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And this unlocks them in a certain kind of way.</p>
<p>And we think about stories.</p>
<p>Like our sense of self is basically,</p>
<p>narrative self is a story.</p>
<p>And we think about the world of stories.</p>
<p>This is why metaphors are always more powerful</p>
<p>than sort of laying out all the details all the time,</p>
<p>speaking in parables.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if you really get some,</p>
<p>this is why, as much as I hate it,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re presenting to Congress or something</p>
<p>and you have all the best data in the world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as powerful as that one anecdote</p>
<p>as the mom dying of cancer that had the psilocybin session</p>
<p>and it transformed her life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a story, that&rsquo;s meaningful.</p>
<p>And so when this kind of unimaginable kind of change</p>
<p>and experience happens with a DMT ingestion,</p>
<p>these stories of entities, they might be that,</p>
<p>stories that are constructed that is the closest,</p>
<p>which is not to say the stories aren&rsquo;t real.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re getting to layers where</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s the closest we can come</p>
<p>to making sense out of it.</p>
<p>Because what we do know about these psychedelics,</p>
<p>one of the levels beyond the receptor</p>
<p>is that the brain is communicating it with itself</p>
<p>in a massively different way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s massive communication with areas</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t normally communicate.</p>
<p>And so I think that comes with both,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s casting the nets wide.</p>
<p>I think that comes with the insights</p>
<p>and helpful novel ways of thinking.</p>
<p>I do think it comes with false positives,</p>
<p>that could be some of the delusion.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re so far out there,</p>
<p>like with the DMT experience,</p>
<p>like maybe alien is the best way</p>
<p>that the mind can wrap some arms around that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how much you&rsquo;re familiar with Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>but he does bring up DMT quite a bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost a meme, it is a meme.</p>
<p>Have you ever, what is it, have you ever tried DMT?</p>
<p>I mean, I think he talks about this experience</p>
<p>of having met other entities</p>
<p>and they were mocking him, I think,</p>
<p>if I remember the experience correctly,</p>
<p>like laughing at him and saying F you, F you,</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I may be misremembering this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a general mockery.</p>
<p>And what he learned from that experience</p>
<p>is that he shouldn&rsquo;t take himself too seriously.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the dissolution of the ego and so on.</p>
<p>Like what do you think about that experience?</p>
<p>And maybe if you have more general things</p>
<p>about Joe&rsquo;s infatuation with DMT</p>
<p>and if DMT has that important role to play</p>
<p>in popular culture in general.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely familiar with it.</p>
<p>I remember telling you offline</p>
<p>that when I first, the first time I learned</p>
<p>who Joe Rogan was, it was probably 15 years ago.</p>
<p>And I came upon a clip and I realized</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another person in the world</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s into both DMT and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>And I think both those worlds have grown dramatically since</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably not such a special club these days.</p>
<p>So he definitely got onto my radar screen quickly.</p>
<p>You were into both before it was cool.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, this is all relative</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s people that were before the late 90s</p>
<p>and early 2000s who were into it</p>
<p>to say you&rsquo;re a Johnny come lately.</p>
<p>But yeah, compared to where we&rsquo;re at now.</p>
<p>But yet one of the things I always found fascinating</p>
<p>by Joe&rsquo;s telling of his experiences I think</p>
<p>is that they resemble very much</p>
<p>Terrence McKenna&rsquo;s experiences with DMT</p>
<p>and Joe has talked very much about Terrence McKenna</p>
<p>and his experiences.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I would guess</p>
<p>that probably just having heard Terrence McKenna</p>
<p>talk about his experiences that that influenced</p>
<p>the coloring of Joe&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how that works</p>
<p>because I mean, that&rsquo;s why McKenna hasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, poets and great orators give us the words</p>
<p>to then like start to describe our experiences</p>
<p>because our words are limited, our language is limited.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always nice to get some kind of nice poetry</p>
<p>into the mix to allow us to put words to it.</p>
<p>Right, but I also see some elements</p>
<p>that seem to relate to Joe&rsquo;s psychology</p>
<p>just from what I&rsquo;ve seen from hours</p>
<p>of watching him on his podcast</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s a self critical guy.</p>
<p>And I think with always his positive been,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always struck being a behavioral pharmacologist</p>
<p>and no one else really says it about cannabis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get back to the DMT thing about</p>
<p>he likes the kind of the paranoid side of things.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s you radically examining yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s not just a bad thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s you need to like look hard at yourself</p>
<p>and something&rsquo;s making you uncomfortable,</p>
<p>like dig into that.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s his,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of along the lines of Goggins with exercise.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, like things,</p>
<p>learning experiences aren&rsquo;t supposed to be easy.</p>
<p>Like take advantage of these uncomfortable experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why we call in our research</p>
<p>in a safe context with psychedelics,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not bad trips, they&rsquo;re challenging experiences.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Just that&rsquo;s the tiny tangent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always cool for me to hear him talk about marijuana,</p>
<p>like weed as the paranoia, the anxiety or whatever</p>
<p>that you experience as actually the fuel for the experience.</p>
<p>Like I think he talks about smoking weed when he&rsquo;s writing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s inspiring to me because</p>
<p>then you can&rsquo;t possibly have a bad experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of that.</p>
<p>Like every experience is good.</p>
<p>Right, which is very Goggins.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, is it bad?</p>
<p>Okay, all right, great, you know.</p>
<p>Well, see Goggins is one side of that.</p>
<p>He wants it bad.</p>
<p>Like he wants the experience to be challenging always.</p>
<p>But I mean like both are good.</p>
<p>Like the few times of taking mushrooms,</p>
<p>the experience was like everything was beautiful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s zero challenging aspect to it.</p>
<p>It was just like the world is beautiful</p>
<p>and it gave me this deep appreciation of the world.</p>
<p>I would say, so like that&rsquo;s amazing,</p>
<p>but also ones that challenge you are also amazing.</p>
<p>Like all the times I drink vodka,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s another, let&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So back to DMT.</p>
<p>Yeah, Joe&rsquo;s treating cannabis as a psychedelic,</p>
<p>which is something that I&rsquo;d say like a lot of people</p>
<p>treat it more like Xanax or like beer or vodka.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s really trying to delve into those minor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been called a minor psychedelic.</p>
<p>So with DMT, as you brought up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the entity&rsquo;s mocking him.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re not, I mean, this reminds me of him,</p>
<p>him describing his, like writing his,</p>
<p>or just his entire method of comedy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, watch the tape of yourself.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just ignore it.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s where I screwed up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I need to do better.</p>
<p>This like sort of radical self examination,</p>
<p>which I think our society is kind of getting away from</p>
<p>because like, all the children win trophies type of thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, no, don&rsquo;t go overboard,</p>
<p>but like recognize when you&rsquo;ve messed up.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a big part of the psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>Like people come out sometimes saying,</p>
<p>my God, I need to say sorry to my mom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so obvious, or whatever interpersonal issue</p>
<p>or like, my God, I&rsquo;m not pulling enough weight</p>
<p>around the house and helping my wife.</p>
<p>And these things that are just obvious to them,</p>
<p>the self criticism that can be a very positive thing</p>
<p>if you act on it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned addiction.</p>
<p>Maybe we could take a little bit detour</p>
<p>into a darker aspect of things,</p>
<p>or not even darker, it&rsquo;s just an important aspect of things.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the nature of addiction?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned some things within the big umbrella</p>
<p>of psychedelics may be usually not addictive,</p>
<p>but maybe MDMA, I think you said</p>
<p>might have some addictive properties,</p>
<p>but the point is stuff outside of the psychedelics umbrella</p>
<p>can often be highly addictive.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve studied addiction from several angles,</p>
<p>one of which is behavioral economics.</p>
<p>What have you understood about addiction?</p>
<p>What is addiction from the biological physiological level</p>
<p>to the psychological to whatever is the interesting way</p>
<p>to talk about addiction?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the lenses that I view addiction through</p>
<p>very much are behavioral economic,</p>
<p>but I also think they converge on,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s beautiful at the other end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>sort of just a completely humanistic psychology perspective.</p>
<p>It converges on what people come out of,</p>
<p>12 step meetings talking about.</p>
<p>Can you say what is behavioral economics</p>
<p>and what is humanistic psychology?</p>
<p>Like, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p>And more importantly, behavioral economics lens,</p>
<p>what is that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so behavioral economics,</p>
<p>my definition of it is the application</p>
<p>of economic principles, mostly microeconomic principles.</p>
<p>So understanding the behavior of individual agents</p>
<p>surrounding commodities in the marketplace,</p>
<p>applying microeconomic types of analyses</p>
<p>to non economic behavior.</p>
<p>So basically at one point,</p>
<p>like psychologists figured out</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this whole other discipline</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been studying behavior,</p>
<p>it just happened to be all focused on monetary behavior,</p>
<p>spending and saving money, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it comes with all of these like principles</p>
<p>that can be wildly and fruitfully applied</p>
<p>to understanding behavior.</p>
<p>So for example, I&rsquo;ve studied things like</p>
<p>demand curve analysis of drug consumption.</p>
<p>So I look at, for example, tobacco, cigarettes</p>
<p>and nicotine products through the lens of demand curves.</p>
<p>And in other words, at different prices,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s different work requirements</p>
<p>for being able to smoke cigarettes, sort of modeling price.</p>
<p>Within that price data,</p>
<p>there is some indication of addiction,</p>
<p>how much the habits that you form</p>
<p>around these particular drugs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one important dimension.</p>
<p>So I think a particularly important one there</p>
<p>is elasticity or inelasticity, two ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the price sensitivity.</p>
<p>So for example, you could have something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty price inelastic, like gasoline.</p>
<p>So the price of gas at times can keep going up</p>
<p>and Americans are just gonna pretty much</p>
<p>buy the same amount of gas.</p>
<p>Or maybe the price of gas doubles,</p>
<p>but their consumption only decreases by 10%.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a sub proportional reduction.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an inelastic.</p>
<p>And that changes, like you push the price up high enough.</p>
<p>I mean, if it was $100 a gallon, it would eventually turn,</p>
<p>the curve would turn and go downward more drastically</p>
<p>and it would be elastic.</p>
<p>But you can apply that to someone who,</p>
<p>a regular cigarette smoker who was working</p>
<p>for cigarette puffs, who&rsquo;s gone six hours without smoking.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re asking questions like,</p>
<p>how many times are they willing to pull this knob</p>
<p>in the lab during this three hour session?</p>
<p>I do a lot of work like this in order to earn a cigarette.</p>
<p>How does the content of nicotine in that affect?</p>
<p>It has the availability of nicotine replacement products</p>
<p>like nicotine gum or eCigarettes affect those decisions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a certain lens of, it&rsquo;s sort of a way to take</p>
<p>the kind of the classic behavioral psychology definition</p>
<p>of reinforcement, which is just basically reward.</p>
<p>How much is this a good thing?</p>
<p>And it kind of breaks that apart</p>
<p>into a multi dimensional space.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the ideas reward or reinforcement</p>
<p>is not unit dimensional.</p>
<p>So for example, you can unpack that with demand curves.</p>
<p>At a cheap price, you might prefer one good to another.</p>
<p>So the classic example is luxury versus necessity.</p>
<p>So diamonds versus toilet paper.</p>
<p>So at those cheap prices,</p>
<p>you can look at something called intensity of demand.</p>
<p>If it was basically as cheap as possible,</p>
<p>or essentially zero, how much would you buy of this good?</p>
<p>But then you keep jacking up the price and you&rsquo;ll see,</p>
<p>so diamonds will look like the better reward</p>
<p>at that low price sort of intensity of demand side of things.</p>
<p>But as you keep jacking up the price,</p>
<p>you gotta have some toilet paper.</p>
<p>And again, we can get into the whole bidet thing,</p>
<p>but forget that, I know Joe&rsquo;s been pushing that too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna hang on and keep buying the toilet paper</p>
<p>to a greater degree than you will the diamonds.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll see a crossing of demand curves.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the better reinforcer?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the better reward?</p>
<p>Depends on your price.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an example of one way to look at addiction.</p>
<p>So specifically drug consumption,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t all of addiction,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like in order for something to be addictive,</p>
<p>it has to be a reward.</p>
<p>And it has to compete with other rewards in your life.</p>
<p>And one of the two main aspects of addiction in my view,</p>
<p>and this doesn&rsquo;t map onto how the DSM,</p>
<p>the psychiatry Bible defines addiction,</p>
<p>which I think is largely bunk,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some value to have some common description,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s how rewarding is it</p>
<p>from this multi dimensional lens?</p>
<p>And specifically, how does that rewarding value compete</p>
<p>with other rewards, other consequences in your life?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a problem if the use of that substance</p>
<p>is rewarding.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, you like to have a couple of beers</p>
<p>every once in a while, and it&rsquo;s like not a problem.</p>
<p>But then you have the alcoholic who is drinking so much</p>
<p>that it tanks their career, it ruins their marriage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in competition with these pro social aspects</p>
<p>to their life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about comparing to the other choices you&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>the other activities in your life.</p>
<p>And if you evaluate it as a much higher reward</p>
<p>than anything else, that becomes an addiction.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not just the rewarding value,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the relative rewarding value.</p>
<p>And the other major aspect, again, from behavioral economics,</p>
<p>that the thing that makes addiction</p>
<p>is something called delayed discounting.</p>
<p>So in economics, sometimes it&rsquo;s called time preference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what compound interest rates are based upon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the idea that delaying a good access to a good</p>
<p>or a reward comes with a certain decrement to its value.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d all rather have things now than later.</p>
<p>And we can study this at the individual level of,</p>
<p>would you rather have $9 today or $10 tomorrow?</p>
<p>And when you do that, you get huge differences</p>
<p>between addicted populations and non addicted,</p>
<p>not just heroin and cocaine, but like just cigarette smokers,</p>
<p>like normal everyday cigarette smokers.</p>
<p>And even when you look at something like monetary rewards.</p>
<p>And so you can go into the rabbit hole</p>
<p>with this delayed discounting model.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not only those huge differences</p>
<p>that seem to have a face valid aspect to it.</p>
<p>Like the cigarette smoker is choosing this thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rewarding today,</p>
<p>but I know it comes with increased risk</p>
<p>of having these horrible consequences down the line.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this competition between what&rsquo;s good for me now</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s good for me later.</p>
<p>And the other aspect about delayed discounting</p>
<p>is that if you quantitatively map out</p>
<p>that discounting curve over time,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t just do that $10 tomorrow,</p>
<p>how much is it worth to you today?</p>
<p>So you can say, what about nine?</p>
<p>What about eight?</p>
<p>What about $7?</p>
<p>And you can titrate it to find that indifference point.</p>
<p>And so we can say, aha, $10 tomorrow is worth $6 today.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s by the one day it&rsquo;s decreased by 40%.</p>
<p>We can do that also at one week and one month</p>
<p>and one year and 10 years and map out that curve,</p>
<p>get a shape of that curve.</p>
<p>And one of the fascinating things about this</p>
<p>is that whether you&rsquo;re talking about pigeons,</p>
<p>making these types of choices</p>
<p>between a little bit of food now</p>
<p>or a little bit of food a minute from now or rats,</p>
<p>or like dozens of species of animals tested,</p>
<p>including humans,</p>
<p>the tendency is pretty consistently</p>
<p>that we discount hyperbolically rather than exponentially.</p>
<p>And what exponentially means is that every unit of time</p>
<p>is associated with the same proportional reduction.</p>
<p>Every unit of delay is associated with the same,</p>
<p>causes the same proportional reduction in value.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way the compound interest rate works.</p>
<p>Every day you get this sort of out of whatever values</p>
<p>in there at the beginning of that day,</p>
<p>you get this, we&rsquo;ll give you this amount of extra money</p>
<p>to compensate you for that delay.</p>
<p>But then the way that all animals tend to function</p>
<p>is of this very different way where the reductions,</p>
<p>the initial, that initial delay,</p>
<p>so like one day&rsquo;s worth of delay,</p>
<p>you see a much stronger discounting rate</p>
<p>or reduction in value than you do over those.</p>
<p>So you see the super proportional,</p>
<p>then it changes to these lesser rates.</p>
<p>And so the implication of that,</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ve gone like really into the weeds quantitatively,</p>
<p>but what that means is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these preference reversals.</p>
<p>When you have curves of that nature,</p>
<p>the decay that&rsquo;s hyperbolic,</p>
<p>it maps onto this phenomenon we see</p>
<p>both in terms of how people deal with future rewards,</p>
<p>but also how perception works.</p>
<p>When two things are far away,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s physical distance</p>
<p>or whether in terms of perception</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s in terms of time,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re really far away,</p>
<p>the value, the subjective value for that further,</p>
<p>that delayed reward is larger.</p>
<p>So for example, like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re talking about 360,</p>
<p>364 days from now, you can get $9 or 365 days a year.</p>
<p>Now you get $10 and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>dude, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a year, like no difference.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll take, why not get one more dollar?</p>
<p>You bring that same exact set of choices closer.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s changed other than the time to both rewards.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, would you rather have $9 today</p>
<p>or $10 tomorrow and plenty of people would say,</p>
<p>eh, just about the same, let&rsquo;s go ahead and take it today.</p>
<p>So you see this preference reversal.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a model of addiction</p>
<p>in the sense that consistently with true addiction,</p>
<p>I would argue, you see this competition</p>
<p>between molar and molecular utility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like interpersonal,</p>
<p>like within the person competing agents.</p>
<p>Someone sometimes has control of the bus</p>
<p>that wants to do what&rsquo;s good for you in the short term.</p>
<p>And someone at other times is in control of driving the bus</p>
<p>and they want to do what&rsquo;s good for you in the long term.</p>
<p>So you tell the, you&rsquo;re trying to quit</p>
<p>and you see a doctor, you see your 12 step therapist</p>
<p>and say, God, I know this stuff is killing me.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m really, I&rsquo;m on the path, like I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re kind of in their office</p>
<p>or wherever you&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s not around you.</p>
<p>And then later on that day, your buddy says that,</p>
<p>hey man, I just scored.</p>
<p>I got it right here.</p>
<p>Do you want it?</p>
<p>And that reward is right in front of you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like bringing those two choices right in front of you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, hell yeah, I want to use.</p>
<p>And then you can go through that cycle for like years</p>
<p>of the person telling themselves, I want to quit.</p>
<p>But then other times that same person is saying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to, you know, functionally,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying, I don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re saying, yeah, like, yeah, give me some.</p>
<p>So in the moment, it&rsquo;s very difficult to quit.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t just something,</p>
<p>this is something that has huge clinical ramifications</p>
<p>with addiction, but it&rsquo;s like all humans do it.</p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s hit the snooze alarm in the morning,</p>
<p>like the night before they realize,</p>
<p>oh, I got to get up extra early tomorrow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s ultimately better for me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to set the alarm for, you know, 5 a.m.</p>
<p>And it goes off at 5 a.m., you know,</p>
<p>and then, so now those two consequences have come sooner</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, what the hell?</p>
<p>And they hit the snooze alarm.</p>
<p>And sometimes not just once,</p>
<p>but then five minutes later and five minutes later,</p>
<p>you know, and so, and it&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s easier</p>
<p>to exercise self control at the grocery store</p>
<p>compared to in your fridge.</p>
<p>Like if that snack is like 30 seconds away in your fridge,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to more likely yield to temptation</p>
<p>than if it is further away.</p>
<p>So then just take a step back to something</p>
<p>you brought up earlier, the inelasticity of pricing.</p>
<p>Is it from a perspective of the dealers,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re talking about cigarettes</p>
<p>or maybe venturing slightly into the illegal realm,</p>
<p>you know, of people who sell drugs illegally,</p>
<p>they also have an economics to them</p>
<p>that they set prices and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Does addiction allow you to mess with the nature of pricing?</p>
<p>Like, so I kind of assume that you meant</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a correlation between things you&rsquo;re addicted to</p>
<p>and the inelasticity of the price.</p>
<p>So you can jack up the price.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to be said</p>
<p>both for legal drugs and illegal drugs</p>
<p>about the kind of price games you can play</p>
<p>because the consumers of the product are addicted?</p>
<p>Right, I mean, I think you just described it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can jack up the price</p>
<p>and you know, some people are going to drop off,</p>
<p>but the people, you know, and it&rsquo;s not dichotomous</p>
<p>because you could just consume less,</p>
<p>but some people are going to consume less</p>
<p>and the people that are most addicted are going to keep,</p>
<p>you know, I mean, you see this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to keep purchasing.</p>
<p>So you see this with cigarettes.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting when you interface this with policy,</p>
<p>like in one respect, heavily taxing cigarettes</p>
<p>is a good thing.</p>
<p>We know it keeps adolescents particularly price sensitive.</p>
<p>So you definitely, people smoke less</p>
<p>and especially kids smoke less when you keep</p>
<p>cigarette prices high and you tax the hell out of them.</p>
<p>But one of the downsides you&rsquo;ve got to balance</p>
<p>and keep in mind is that you disproportionately</p>
<p>have working class, poor people.</p>
<p>And then you get into a point where someone&rsquo;s spending,</p>
<p>you know, a quarter of their paycheck on cigarettes.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to smoke no matter what.</p>
<p>And basically because they&rsquo;re addicted,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to smoke no matter what.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just, yeah, you&rsquo;re taxing their existence.</p>
<p>Right, so you&rsquo;re making it worse for them.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t, if they are completely inelastic,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually making that person&rsquo;s life worse.</p>
<p>Because we know that by interfering with the amount</p>
<p>of money they have, you&rsquo;re interfering with the other</p>
<p>pro social, the potential competitors to smoking, you know.</p>
<p>And we know that when someone&rsquo;s in more impoverished</p>
<p>environments and they have less sort of non drug alternatives,</p>
<p>you know, the more likely they&rsquo;re going to stay addicted.</p>
<p>So, you know.</p>
<p>Is there data, this is interesting,</p>
<p>from a scientific perspective of those same kind of games</p>
<p>in illegal drugs?</p>
<p>Sort of, because that&rsquo;s where most drug,</p>
<p>I was, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but it seems like most drugs are currently illegal.</p>
<p>And so, but there&rsquo;s still an economics to them, obviously.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the drug war and so on.</p>
<p>Is there data on the setting of prices</p>
<p>or like how good are the business people running</p>
<p>the selling of drugs that are illegal?</p>
<p>Are they all the same kind of rules apply</p>
<p>from a behavioral economics perspective?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re basically, whether they&rsquo;re crunching</p>
<p>the numbers or not, they&rsquo;re basically sensitive</p>
<p>to that demand curve and they&rsquo;re doing the same thing</p>
<p>that businesses do in a legal market.</p>
<p>And, you know, you want to sell as much of a product</p>
<p>to get as much money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking more at the total income.</p>
<p>So if you jack the price a little bit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get some reduction in consumption,</p>
<p>but it may be that the total amount of money</p>
<p>that you rake in is going to be more than,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to overcompensate for that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re willing to take,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m going to lose 10% of my customers,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m getting more than enough to compensate</p>
<p>from that, from the extra money</p>
<p>from the people who still are buying.</p>
<p>So I think they&rsquo;re more, you know,</p>
<p>and especially when we get to the lower,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if people are crunching those numbers</p>
<p>and looking at demand curves, maybe at the, you know,</p>
<p>at the really high levels of the, you know,</p>
<p>up the chain with the cartels and whatnot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me at all,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s probably more implicit</p>
<p>at the lower levels where something,</p>
<p>you brought up drug policy.</p>
<p>I will say that for years now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been this kind of unquestioned goal by, for example,</p>
<p>the drug czar&rsquo;s office in the US</p>
<p>to make the price of illegal drugs as high as possible</p>
<p>without this kind of nuanced approach that,</p>
<p>yeah, if you make, you know,</p>
<p>for some people, if you make the price so high,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually making things worse.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m all about reducing the problems associated</p>
<p>with drugs and drug addictions.</p>
<p>And part of that is the,</p>
<p>are more direct consequences of those drugs themselves,</p>
<p>but a whole lot is what you get from indirectly</p>
<p>and, you know, sort of the,</p>
<p>both for the individual and for society.</p>
<p>So like making a poor person</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have enough money for their kids,</p>
<p>making them even poorer.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve made their children&rsquo;s future worse</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re growing up in deeper poverty</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve essentially levied a tax</p>
<p>onto this person who&rsquo;s heavily addicted.</p>
<p>But then at the societal level, you know,</p>
<p>so everything we know about the drug war</p>
<p>in terms of the heavy criminalization</p>
<p>and filling up prisons and reducing employment</p>
<p>and educational opportunities,</p>
<p>which in the big picture,</p>
<p>we know are the things that in a free market</p>
<p>compete against some of the worst problems of addiction</p>
<p>is actually having educational</p>
<p>and employment opportunities.</p>
<p>But when you give someone a felony, for example,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pretty much guaranteeing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re never gonna go very high on the economic ladder.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re making drugs a better reward</p>
<p>for that person&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>So this is a quick step into the policy realm.</p>
<p>And I think for both you and I,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure you can correct me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m more comfortable into studying the effects of drugs</p>
<p>on the human behavior and human psychology</p>
<p>versus like policy.</p>
<p>It seems like a whole giant mess,</p>
<p>but yeah, there&rsquo;s some libertarian candidates for president</p>
<p>and just libertarian thinkers</p>
<p>that had a nice thought experiment</p>
<p>of possibly legalizing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken about possibly legalizing basically all drugs.</p>
<p>In your intuition,</p>
<p>do you think a world where all drugs are legal</p>
<p>is a safer world or a less safe world</p>
<p>for the users of those drugs?</p>
<p>It really depends on what we mean by legalization.</p>
<p>So this is one of my beefs with this,</p>
<p>how these things are talked about.</p>
<p>I mean, we have very few completely laissez faire,</p>
<p>you know, legal drugs.</p>
<p>So even caffeine is one of the few examples.</p>
<p>So for example, caffeine and tea and coffee is in that realm.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no limits, no one&rsquo;s testing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no laws, regulation at any level</p>
<p>of how much caffeine you&rsquo;re allowed to buy</p>
<p>or how much is in the product.</p>
<p>But even like with this Starbucks, like nitro,</p>
<p>there are rules with soda and with canned products,</p>
<p>you can only put so much.</p>
<p>In there, yeah.</p>
<p>So this is FDA regulated.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of weird because there&rsquo;s a limit to sodas</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not there for energy drinks and other things.</p>
<p>But, you know, so even caffeine,</p>
<p>it depends on what product we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re like no dose</p>
<p>and other caffeine products over the counter,</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t just put 800 milligrams in there.</p>
<p>The pills are like one or 200 milligrams.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s FDA regulated as an over counter drug.</p>
<p>Some of the most dangerous drugs in society,</p>
<p>I would say arguably one of the most dangerous classes</p>
<p>of drugs is the volatile anesthetics, huffing.</p>
<p>People huffing gasoline and, you know, airplane glue,</p>
<p>toluene, whatnot, severely damaging to the nervous system.</p>
<p>Pretty much legal, but there&rsquo;s some regulation</p>
<p>in the sense that there&rsquo;s a warning label,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s illegal to do it for,</p>
<p>not that they&rsquo;re busting people for this,</p>
<p>but, you know, it&rsquo;s against federal law</p>
<p>to use this in a way other than intended type of,</p>
<p>basically saying like, yeah, don&rsquo;t huff this, you know,</p>
<p>your paint thinner or whatnot.</p>
<p>It at least keeps people from selling it for that.</p>
<p>Like, no, because they&rsquo;re gonna go after that person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna be able to find</p>
<p>the 12 year old who&rsquo;s huffing.</p>
<p>So anyway, just as some extreme examples at the end.</p>
<p>And then, you know, even the so called illegal,</p>
<p>like schedule one drugs, psilocybin,</p>
<p>we do plenty in terms of schedule two,</p>
<p>which is ironically less restrictive than psilocybin,</p>
<p>but methamphetamine and cocaine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done human research with.</p>
<p>My research has been legal.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re scheduled compounds,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not completely illegal.</p>
<p>Like you can do research with them</p>
<p>with the appropriate licenses and approval.</p>
<p>So there really is no such thing.</p>
<p>And like alcohol, well, it&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re 12 years old or 18 years old or 20 years old.</p>
<p>And for anyone, it&rsquo;s illegal to be drinking it</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re driving.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always a nuance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not dichotomy.</p>
<p>And I actually should admit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been on my to do list for a while</p>
<p>to buy in Massachusetts, some like edible,</p>
<p>or buy weed legally.</p>
<p>Yeah, haven&rsquo;t done that in Massachusetts,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>And I wonder what that experience is like,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s fully legal in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>And so I wonder what legal drugs look like to me.</p>
<p>You know, I grew up with even weed being like,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s like this forbidden thing,</p>
<p>you know, not forbidden, but it&rsquo;s illegal.</p>
<p>You know, most people, of course, I never partook,</p>
<p>but most people I knew would attain it illegally.</p>
<p>And so that big switch that&rsquo;s been happening</p>
<p>across the country, there&rsquo;s like federal stuff going on</p>
<p>to make marijuana legal federally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m half paying attention.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some movement there.</p>
<p>I mean, the House passed a bill</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna be passed by the Senate,</p>
<p>but yeah, it&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s clearly a change.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s moving in a trend.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the example of a drug that used to be illegal</p>
<p>is now becoming more and more and more legal.</p>
<p>So like, I wonder what like cocaine being legal looks like,</p>
<p>what a society with cocaine being legal looks like,</p>
<p>the rules around it, you know, the processes</p>
<p>in which you can consume it in a safer way</p>
<p>and be more educated about its consequences,</p>
<p>be able to control dose and like purity much better,</p>
<p>be able to get help for overdose.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It does in a utopian sense feel like legalizing drugs</p>
<p>at least should be talked about and considered</p>
<p>versus keeping them in the dark.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But yeah, so that in your sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that in 50 years we legalize all drugs</p>
<p>and it makes for a better world.</p>
<p>The way I like to talk about it is that I would say</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s possible and it would probably be a good thing</p>
<p>if we regulate all drugs.</p>
<p>How would you regulate like cocaine, for example?</p>
<p>Is there ideas there?</p>
<p>So yeah, and you were already, you know, going, you know,</p>
<p>where I was going with that kind of first I described</p>
<p>how there&rsquo;s always a new ones.</p>
<p>And even like the cannabis in Massachusetts,</p>
<p>federally illegal.</p>
<p>So for example, if I was like, and I, you know,</p>
<p>colleagues that do cannabis research</p>
<p>where they get people high in the lab,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re a federal funded researcher with NIH funds,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get that stuff from the dispensary</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re breaking a federal law.</p>
<p>Even though the feds don&rsquo;t have the resources to go after,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want the controversy at this point</p>
<p>to go after the individual users</p>
<p>or even the sellers in those legal states.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always this nuance,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about the right regulation.</p>
<p>So I think we already know enough that, for example,</p>
<p>like I think safe injection sites for hard drugs</p>
<p>makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Like I wouldn&rsquo;t want heroin and cocaine</p>
<p>at the convenience stores.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think, maybe there&rsquo;s some extreme libertarians</p>
<p>that want that.</p>
<p>I think even the folks that identify as libertarians,</p>
<p>probably most of them don&rsquo;t, well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like not all of them want that, you know?</p>
<p>I think, you know, that as a form of regulation,</p>
<p>like, look, if you&rsquo;re using these hard drugs</p>
<p>on a regular basis, you&rsquo;re putting yourself at risk</p>
<p>for lethal overdose.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re putting yourself at risk for catching HIV</p>
<p>and hepatitis.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna do it, if you&rsquo;re doing it anyway,</p>
<p>come to this place where at least you&rsquo;re not like,</p>
<p>you know, like pulling the water out of like,</p>
<p>you know, the puddle on the side of the street.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s done by professionals</p>
<p>and those professionals are able to educate you also.</p>
<p>So like a 711 clerk may not be both capable</p>
<p>of helping you to inject the drug properly,</p>
<p>but also won&rsquo;t be equipped to educate you</p>
<p>at the negative consequences, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge part of it, the education.</p>
<p>But then I think with the opioids,</p>
<p>like the big part of it is just like with naloxone,</p>
<p>which is an antagonist, it goes into the receptor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called Narcan, that&rsquo;s the trade name,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s what they revive people on an opioid overdose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost completely effective.</p>
<p>Like if there&rsquo;s a medical professional there</p>
<p>and someone&rsquo;s ODing on an opioid,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re virtually guaranteed to live.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s remarkable that if 100% at the opioid crisis,</p>
<p>you know, if all of those people right now that are dying</p>
<p>were doing that in the presence of a medical professional,</p>
<p>like even like a nurse with Narcan,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be basically almost no deaths.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always some exceptions, but you know,</p>
<p>almost no deaths, like that&rsquo;s staggering to me.</p>
<p>So the idea that people are doing this,</p>
<p>that we could have that level of positive effect</p>
<p>without encouraging the drug.</p>
<p>And this is where like you get into this like terrain</p>
<p>of like sending the wrong message.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, you can do that.</p>
<p>You can say like, we&rsquo;re not encouraging this.</p>
<p>In fact, probably one of the greatest advertisements</p>
<p>for not getting hooked on heroin</p>
<p>is like visiting a methadone clinic,</p>
<p>visiting a safe injection site.</p>
<p>Like this is not like an advertisement</p>
<p>for getting hooked on this drug,</p>
<p>but knowing that we can save people.</p>
<p>Now you have a landscape here</p>
<p>because a lot of times it&rsquo;s just like supervised injection,</p>
<p>but you bring your own stuff, you know,</p>
<p>you bring your own heroin, which could still be, you know,</p>
<p>dirty and filled with fentanyl and fentanyl derivatives,</p>
<p>which because of the incredible potency</p>
<p>and the more difficulty measuring it,</p>
<p>and some differences at the receptor,</p>
<p>like you may be more likely,</p>
<p>you are more likely on average to lethally overdose on it.</p>
<p>You know, so you could,</p>
<p>the level that&rsquo;s been more explored in Switzerland</p>
<p>is in some places is you actually provide the drug itself</p>
<p>and you supervise the injection.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>Do you like that idea?</p>
<p>Yeah, the public health data are completely on the side of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really no credible evidence to this.</p>
<p>If we allow that, we&rsquo;re sending the wrong message</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s gonna, I mean, I&rsquo;m not showing up.</p>
<p>Like, you know, and it&rsquo;s different by drug.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, you legalize, you set up cannabis shops</p>
<p>and some people are gonna say,</p>
<p>so you go, I&rsquo;m gonna go there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a whole lot of people</p>
<p>are gonna go to one of these places</p>
<p>and say, I&rsquo;m gonna shoot up heroin for the first time.</p>
<p>And even if like, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a country of 300 million people,</p>
<p>like even if someone does that,</p>
<p>you have to compare this to the every day</p>
<p>people are dying from opioid overdoses.</p>
<p>Like people&rsquo;s kids, people&rsquo;s uncles,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s like, these are real lives</p>
<p>that are being shattered.</p>
<p>So you just look at that.</p>
<p>And then the other thing,</p>
<p>and I know this from having done residential,</p>
<p>even like non treatment research,</p>
<p>where we just have a cocaine user or something,</p>
<p>stay on our inpatient ward for a month</p>
<p>and you really get to know them.</p>
<p>And sometimes you see like, oftentimes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first time this person has had a discussion</p>
<p>with a medical professional, any type of professional</p>
<p>in their entire life around their drug use.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re not looking to quit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know, you could imagine that</p>
<p>in the safe injection settings where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it might be a year into treatment and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you know, doc, I know you&rsquo;re not the cops.</p>
<p>Like you really care for me.</p>
<p>Like, I think I&rsquo;m ready to try that methadone thing.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m really, I think I wanna be done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really patient about it, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, they get to trust the people</p>
<p>and realize that they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>cause they truly like, they have a compassion,</p>
<p>a love for this community, like as human beings,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want people to die.</p>
<p>And you get real human connections and that,</p>
<p>and again, like those are the conditions</p>
<p>where people are gonna ultimately seek treatment</p>
<p>and not everyone always will, but you&rsquo;re gonna get that.</p>
<p>And then, you know, you&rsquo;re gonna get people</p>
<p>like looking into treatment options sometimes,</p>
<p>you know, maybe it&rsquo;s years into the treatment.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re just all of these indirect benefits</p>
<p>that I think at that level,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d call that legalizing,</p>
<p>you know, I think again, at least well regulated.</p>
<p>Right, whatever that word is.</p>
<p>Yeah, well regulated, but out in the open.</p>
<p>Right, minimizing as many harms as we can</p>
<p>while not encouraging.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t encourage people to drink all the,</p>
<p>I mean, people die every year from caffeine overdose.</p>
<p>Like, you know, there&rsquo;s different ways to like, you know,</p>
<p>just by allowing something doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sending the message that, you know,</p>
<p>by saying we&rsquo;re not gonna give you a felony,</p>
<p>which is actually often the penalty for psychedelics.</p>
<p>I just actually testified for the Judiciary Committee</p>
<p>of the Senate, the Assembly in New Jersey.</p>
<p>And just to move psilocybin from a felony to misdemeanor,</p>
<p>they use different language in New Jersey, it&rsquo;s weird,</p>
<p>but like the equivalent of felony and misdemeanor.</p>
<p>And that was like, two people didn&rsquo;t vote for that</p>
<p>on this committee because it was might,</p>
<p>one of them said it might be sending the wrong message.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, a felony, I mean, there&rsquo;s real harms.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s the scarlet letter the rest of your life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stuck at the lower ends of the employment ladder.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get, you know, loans for education,</p>
<p>all of this, maybe because of a stupid mistake</p>
<p>you made once as a 19 year old.</p>
<p>Doing something that like, you know,</p>
<p>a presidential candidate could have done and admitted to</p>
<p>and had no problem, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, what drug is the most addictive,</p>
<p>the most dangerous in your view?</p>
<p>Not maybe, like not technically,</p>
<p>like specifically which drug,</p>
<p>but more like in our society today,</p>
<p>what is a highly problematic drug?</p>
<p>We talked about psychedelics not being that addictive</p>
<p>on the other flip side of that.</p>
<p>You mentioned cocaine, is that the top one?</p>
<p>Is there something else?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a concern to you?</p>
<p>It depends, and you&rsquo;ve already alluded to this nuance.</p>
<p>It depends on how you define it.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about on the ground today,</p>
<p>in, you know, a modern society,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say nicotine, tobacco.</p>
<p>Oh shit.</p>
<p>I mean, in terms of mortality,</p>
<p>it kills far more than any other drug known to humankind.</p>
<p>Four times more than alcohol,</p>
<p>like a half million deaths in the US every year</p>
<p>and about five to six million worldwide due to tobacco.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s four times more in the US than alcohol.</p>
<p>And if you graph all of the drugs, legal and illegal,</p>
<p>like, you know, put all of the illegal drugs</p>
<p>in like one category on that figure,</p>
<p>and you put alcohol and tobacco on that figure,</p>
<p>all the illegal drugs combined,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a barely visible blip to this incredible,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s no, even all of the opioid epidemic rolled up</p>
<p>along with cocaine and everything else,</p>
<p>the meth barely shows up compared to tobacco.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of those uncomfortable truths</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know what to do with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like where everybody&rsquo;s freaking out</p>
<p>about coronavirus, right?</p>
<p>And nobody&rsquo;s&hellip; The relative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all relative.</p>
<p>If you look at the relative thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, why aren&rsquo;t we freaking out</p>
<p>about cigarettes, which we are increasingly so</p>
<p>over the, historically speaking, right?</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s like terrorism versus swimming pools.</p>
<p>I remember that being back in the,</p>
<p>after the war on terror started.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, there&rsquo;s not even comparison.</p>
<p>Okay. So, you know, that&rsquo;s a little sobering truth there.</p>
<p>Cause I was thinking like cocaine,</p>
<p>I was thinking about all of these hard drugs,</p>
<p>but the reality is relatively nicotine is the big one.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t ask about mortality or deaths.</p>
<p>You asked about addiction,</p>
<p>but that really is hard to evaluate.</p>
<p>It gets into those nuances I spoke of before</p>
<p>about there&rsquo;s not a unidimensional way</p>
<p>to measure reinforcement.</p>
<p>It kind of depends on the situation</p>
<p>and what measure we&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>But you know, more people have access to tobacco</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not advocating that we make it an illegal drug.</p>
<p>I think that would be a horrible mistake.</p>
<p>Although there is a very credible push</p>
<p>to mandate the reduction of nicotine in cigarettes,</p>
<p>which I have most scientists that study it are for it.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some real dangers there</p>
<p>cause I see that in the broader history of drug use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when has drug prohibition worked broadly speaking?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s to me that path would only make sense</p>
<p>in very good conjunction with eCigarettes,</p>
<p>which once they&rsquo;re fully regulated can be a safer,</p>
<p>not safe, but much safer alternative.</p>
<p>And if we tax the hell out of eCigarettes</p>
<p>and ban every attractive feature</p>
<p>like flavors and everything,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s gonna push people to a black market</p>
<p>if they can&rsquo;t get the real thing from real cigarette.</p>
<p>Like some people will just quit straight out.</p>
<p>But I think with the regulators</p>
<p>and what a lot of scientists that study tobacco,</p>
<p>like myself, it&rsquo;s a big part still of what I study.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not used to thinking about the like tobacco really</p>
<p>as a drug largely speaking in terms of,</p>
<p>for example, the history of prohibition.</p>
<p>And I think of like,</p>
<p>we already know there&rsquo;s an illicit market,</p>
<p>a black market for tobacco to get around taxes.</p>
<p>I mean, and for selling even loose cigarettes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what initially caused in Staten Island</p>
<p>the police to approach Eric Garland</p>
<p>who was selling loose cigarettes and he got choked out.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing that caused that police contact</p>
<p>was he was selling, well, I think reported</p>
<p>to sell individual cigarettes for like,</p>
<p>he gets home for court, it happens in Baltimore.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s technically illegal.</p>
<p>But are you not gonna have massive boats</p>
<p>of supplies coming over from China and elsewhere</p>
<p>of real deal cigarettes if you ban the sale of nicotine?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s obviously gonna happen.</p>
<p>And you have to weigh that against,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna create a black market to one size or another.</p>
<p>And your intuition that really hasn&rsquo;t worked</p>
<p>throughout the history when we&rsquo;ve tried it.</p>
<p>Right, but I see a potential path forward,</p>
<p>but only if it&rsquo;s well,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not in conjunction with eCigarettes.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a clear alternative,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a positive alternative</p>
<p>that it kind of stares the population towards an alternative.</p>
<p>The difference here, the unique thing</p>
<p>that could be taken advantage of here</p>
<p>is nicotine is by and large, not what causes the harm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the aromatic hydrocarbons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the carcinogens and tobacco,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s burning tobacco smoke, it&rsquo;s not the nicotine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like alcohol prohibition</p>
<p>where like you couldn&rsquo;t create the O&rsquo;Douls,</p>
<p>the near beer is not gonna have the alcohol.</p>
<p>And so people like, here you do have the possibility</p>
<p>of giving another medium the ability to deliver the drug,</p>
<p>which still aren&rsquo;t to a lot of people</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t preferred to the tobacco, but nonetheless,</p>
<p>again, if you overregulate those</p>
<p>and make them less attractive,</p>
<p>like if you aren&rsquo;t thoughtful about the nicotine limits</p>
<p>and thoughtful about whether you&rsquo;re allowing flavors</p>
<p>and everything, and if you overtax them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually decreasing the ability to compete</p>
<p>with the more dangerous products.</p>
<p>So I feel like there is a potential path forward,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have a lot of confidence</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s gonna be done in a thoughtful analytical way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m afraid that it could decrease the increase</p>
<p>of black market calls all of the harms.</p>
<p>Like every other drug we&rsquo;re moving away from the prohibition</p>
<p>model slowly, but the big barge ship</p>
<p>is like making a very slow turn.</p>
<p>And like, okay, we really had to step back</p>
<p>and question if we went with nicotine, tobacco,</p>
<p>are we moving into that direction?</p>
<p>Like big picture.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t quite make sense.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done a study on cocaine and sexual decision making.</p>
<p>Can you explain?</p>
<p>Can you explain the findings?</p>
<p>I mean, in a broad sense, how do you do a study</p>
<p>that involves cocaine and the other,</p>
<p>how do you do a study involving sexual decision making?</p>
<p>And then how do you do a study that combines both?</p>
<p>Yeah, sex and drugs too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just missing the rock and roll.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the two controversial,</p>
<p>rock and roll isn&rsquo;t very controversial anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the cocaine, lots of hoops to jump through.</p>
<p>You gotta have a lot of medical support.</p>
<p>You gotta be at a basically an institution,</p>
<p>a research unit like I&rsquo;m at that has a long history</p>
<p>and the ability to do that and get ethics approval,</p>
<p>get FDA approval, but it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And whenever you&rsquo;re dealing with something like cocaine,</p>
<p>you would never wanna give that to someone</p>
<p>who hasn&rsquo;t already used cocaine.</p>
<p>And you wanna make sure you&rsquo;re not giving it to someone</p>
<p>who is an active user who wants to quit.</p>
<p>So the idea is like, okay,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re using this type of drug anyway,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re really sure you&rsquo;re not looking to quit,</p>
<p>hey, use a couple of times in the lab with us</p>
<p>so we can at least learn something.</p>
<p>And part of what we learn is maybe to help people not use</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll reduce the harms of cocaine.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s hoops to jump through.</p>
<p>With the sexual decision making,</p>
<p>I looked at the main thing I looked at was this model</p>
<p>of I applied delayed discounting</p>
<p>to what we talked about earlier, the now versus later,</p>
<p>that kind of decision making that goes along with addiction.</p>
<p>I applied that to condom use decisions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done probably published about 20 or so papers</p>
<p>with this and different drugs.</p>
<p>So the primary metric is whether you do</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t use a condom?</p>
<p>Right, and so this is using hypothetical decision making,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve published some studies looking at,</p>
<p>showing a tight correspondence to self report it</p>
<p>in correlational studies to self reported behavior.</p>
<p>So this is like, so like how do you,</p>
<p>did you do a questionnaire kind of thing?</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s not quite a questionnaire,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a behavioral task requiring them to respond to.</p>
<p>So you show pictures of a bunch of individuals</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of like one of these fun behavioral,</p>
<p>like a lot of them you get like numbers are boring,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, okay, hot or not,</p>
<p>like which of these 60 people</p>
<p>would you have a one night stand with?</p>
<p>Men, women, so pick whatever you like,</p>
<p>a little bit of this, a little bit of that,</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re into, it&rsquo;s all variety there.</p>
<p>Out of that group, you pick some subsets of people.</p>
<p>Who do you think is the one you most want to have sex</p>
<p>with the least, he thinks most likely to have an STI</p>
<p>or least likely a sexually transmitted disease by STI.</p>
<p>And then you could do certain decision making questions.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve done is asked,</p>
<p>say this person you read a vignette,</p>
<p>this person wants to have sex with you now you&rsquo;ve met them,</p>
<p>you get along casual sex scenario,</p>
<p>like a one night stand with a condoms available,</p>
<p>just rate your likelihood from one to 100</p>
<p>on this kind of scale, would you use it?</p>
<p>But then you can change your scenario to say,</p>
<p>okay, now imagine you have to wait five minutes</p>
<p>to use a condom.</p>
<p>So the choice is now instead of using condom</p>
<p>versus not in terms of your likelihood scale,</p>
<p>it now what ranges from have sex now without a condom</p>
<p>versus on the other end of the scale</p>
<p>is wait five minutes to have sex with a condom.</p>
<p>So you rate your likelihood of where your behavior</p>
<p>would be along that continuum.</p>
<p>And then you could say, okay, well, what about an hour?</p>
<p>What about three hours?</p>
<p>What about 24 hours?</p>
<p>Misunderstanding, now without a condom</p>
<p>or five minutes later with a condom?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s supposed to be the preference for the person?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of factors coming into play, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like pleasure, a personal preference</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s also the safety.</p>
<p>Those are two like, are those competing objectives?</p>
<p>Right, and so we do get at that</p>
<p>through some individual measures</p>
<p>and this task is more of a face valid task</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot underneath the hood.</p>
<p>So for most people, sex with the condom is the better reward</p>
<p>but underneath the hood of that</p>
<p>is just at the purely physical level,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d rather have sex without the condom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna feel better.</p>
<p>What do you mean by reward?</p>
<p>Like when they calculate their trajectory through life</p>
<p>and try to optimize it,</p>
<p>then sex with the condom is a good idea?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s really based on, I mean, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Presumably that&rsquo;s the case that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s measured by like what would you,</p>
<p>really that first question where there is no delay.</p>
<p>Most people say they would be at the higher end scale</p>
<p>a lot of times 100% they would say</p>
<p>they would definitely use a condom.</p>
<p>Not everybody and that we know that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>See, it&rsquo;s like that some people don&rsquo;t like condoms,</p>
<p>some people say, yeah, I wanna use a condom</p>
<p>but quarter of the time ended up not</p>
<p>because I just getting lost in the passion of the moment.</p>
<p>So for the people, I mean, the only reason that people,</p>
<p>so behaviorally speaking,</p>
<p>at least for a large number of people</p>
<p>in many circumstances condom use as a reinforcer</p>
<p>just because people do it.</p>
<p>Like, why are they doing it?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not because it makes the sex feel better</p>
<p>but because it makes that it allows</p>
<p>for at least the same general reward.</p>
<p>Even if actually, even if it feels a little bit</p>
<p>not as good with the condom, nonetheless,</p>
<p>they get most of the benefit without the concurrent,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, there&rsquo;s this risk of either unwanted pregnancy</p>
<p>or getting HIV or way more likely than HIV,</p>
<p>herpes in general awards, et cetera, all the lovely ones.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve actually done research saying like</p>
<p>where we gauge the probability</p>
<p>of these individual different SDIs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s the heavy hitter</p>
<p>in terms of what people are using to judge</p>
<p>and to evaluate whether they&rsquo;re gonna use a condom.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why the condom use is the delayed thing,</p>
<p>five minutes or more.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, because that&rsquo;s the prefer.</p>
<p>Which would normally be the larger later reward</p>
<p>like the $10 versus the nine, it&rsquo;s like the $10,</p>
<p>which is counterintuitive</p>
<p>if you just think about the physical pleasure.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good thing to measure.</p>
<p>So condom use is a really good concrete,</p>
<p>quantifiable thing that you can use in a study.</p>
<p>And then you can add a lot of different elements</p>
<p>like the presence of cocaine and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can get people loaded on like any number of drugs</p>
<p>like cocaine, alcohol and methamphetamine</p>
<p>are the three that I&rsquo;ve done and published on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting that.</p>
<p>These are fun studies, man.</p>
<p>Right, I love to get people loaded in a safe context</p>
<p>and like, but to really, it started,</p>
<p>like there was some early research with alcohol.</p>
<p>I mean, the psychedelics are the most interesting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like all of these drugs are fascinating.</p>
<p>The fact that all of these are keys</p>
<p>that unlock a certain like psychological experience</p>
<p>in the head.</p>
<p>And so there was this work with alcohol</p>
<p>that showed that it didn&rsquo;t affect those monetary</p>
<p>delay discounting decisions,</p>
<p>$9 now versus $10 later.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like getting people drunk.</p>
<p>And I thought to myself, are you telling me</p>
<p>that getting someone,</p>
<p>that people being drunk does not cause people</p>
<p>at least sometimes to make,</p>
<p>to choose what&rsquo;s good for them in the short term</p>
<p>at the expense of what&rsquo;s good for them in the long term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, bullshit, like we see like,</p>
<p>but in what context does that happen?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that inspired me to go</p>
<p>in this direction of like, aha, risky sexual decisions</p>
<p>is something they do when they&rsquo;re drunk.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t necessarily go home.</p>
<p>And even though some people have gambling problems</p>
<p>and alcohol interacts with that,</p>
<p>the most typical thing is not for people to go home,</p>
<p>log on and change their allocation</p>
<p>in their retirement account or something like that.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re more likely, risky sexual decisions,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more likely to not wait the five minutes</p>
<p>for the condom and instead go no condom now.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s a big effect.</p>
<p>And we see that.</p>
<p>And interestingly, we do not see,</p>
<p>with those different drugs, we don&rsquo;t see an effect</p>
<p>if we just look at that zero delay condition.</p>
<p>In other words, the condoms right there waiting to be used,</p>
<p>how likely are to use it?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>I mean, people are by and large gonna use the condom.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s the way most of this research</p>
<p>outside of behavioral economics</p>
<p>that just looked at condom use decisions,</p>
<p>very little of which has ever actually administered</p>
<p>the drugs, which is another unique aspect.</p>
<p>But they usually just look at like assuming</p>
<p>the condom is there.</p>
<p>But this is more using behavioral economics</p>
<p>to delve in and model something that,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done survey research on this,</p>
<p>modeling what actually happens.</p>
<p>Like you meet someone at a laundromat,</p>
<p>like you weren&rsquo;t planning on like,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like one thing leads to another,</p>
<p>they live around the corner, these things.</p>
<p>And like we did one survey with men who have sex with men</p>
<p>and found that 25% of them, 24%, about a quarter,</p>
<p>reported in the last six months</p>
<p>that they had unprotected anal intercourse,</p>
<p>which is the most risky</p>
<p>in terms of sexually transmitted infection.</p>
<p>In the last six months, in a situation</p>
<p>where they would have used a condom,</p>
<p>but they simply didn&rsquo;t use one</p>
<p>just because they didn&rsquo;t have one on them.</p>
<p>So this to me, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if unless we delve into this and understand this,</p>
<p>these suboptimal conditions,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna fully address the problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of people that say,</p>
<p>yep, condom use is good.</p>
<p>I use it a lot of the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, where is that failing?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s under these suboptimal conditions,</p>
<p>which in Frank, if you think about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like most of the case.</p>
<p>Action is unfolding, things are getting hot and heavy.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s like, do you got a condom?</p>
<p>Eh, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, do they break the action</p>
<p>and take 10 minutes to go to the convenience store</p>
<p>or whatever?</p>
<p>Maybe everything&rsquo;s closed.</p>
<p>Maybe they gotta wait till tomorrow.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something to be studied there on the,</p>
<p>that just seems like an unfortunate set of circumstances.</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the solution to that is,</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the psychology</p>
<p>that needs to be taken apart there?</p>
<p>Because it just seems like that&rsquo;s the way of life.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t expect the things to happen.</p>
<p>Are we supposed to expect them better</p>
<p>to be self aware enough about our calculations?</p>
<p>Or you see the 10 minute detour to a convenience store</p>
<p>as a kind of thing that we need to understand</p>
<p>how we humans evaluate the cost of that.</p>
<p>I think in terms of like how we use this to help people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mostly on the environment side,</p>
<p>rather than on the individual side.</p>
<p>Yeah, although those interact.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, in one sense, if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re gonna be drinking</p>
<p>or using another substance that is associated</p>
<p>with a stimulant, alcohol and stimulants</p>
<p>go along with risky sex.</p>
<p>Good to be aware that you might make decisions</p>
<p>just to tell yourself you might make a decision</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t have made in your sober state.</p>
<p>And so, hey, throwing a condom in the purse,</p>
<p>in the pocket, might be a good idea.</p>
<p>I think at the environmental level,</p>
<p>just more condom, I mean, it highlights what we know</p>
<p>about just making condoms widely available.</p>
<p>Something that I&rsquo;d like to do</p>
<p>is like reinforcing condom use.</p>
<p>So just getting people used to carrying a condom</p>
<p>everywhere they go.</p>
<p>Because once it&rsquo;s in someone&rsquo;s habit,</p>
<p>if they are, say, like a young, single person,</p>
<p>and they occasionally have unprotected sex,</p>
<p>like training those people,</p>
<p>like what if you got a text message</p>
<p>once every few days saying,</p>
<p>ah, if you send back a photo of a condom,</p>
<p>within a minute you get a reward of $5.</p>
<p>You could shape that up like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a process called contingency management.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically just straight up operant reinforcement.</p>
<p>You could shape that up with no problem.</p>
<p>And I mean, those procedures of contingency management,</p>
<p>giving people systematic rewards is like,</p>
<p>for example, the most powerful way</p>
<p>to reduce cocaine use in addicted people.</p>
<p>And by saying, if you show me a negative urine for cocaine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you a monetary reward.</p>
<p>And like that has huge effects</p>
<p>in terms of decreasing cocaine use.</p>
<p>If that can be that powerful</p>
<p>for something like stopping cocaine use,</p>
<p>how powerful could that be for shaping up</p>
<p>just carrying a condom?</p>
<p>Because the primary, unlike cocaine use,</p>
<p>here, we&rsquo;re not saying you can&rsquo;t have the main reward,</p>
<p>like you could still have sex,</p>
<p>and you can even have sex in the way</p>
<p>that you tell yourself you&rsquo;d rather do it</p>
<p>if the condom is available.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, it&rsquo;s way easier</p>
<p>than like not using cocaine if you like using cocaine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just basically getting in the habit</p>
<p>of carrying a condom.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just one idea of like why.</p>
<p>There could be also the capitalistic solutions</p>
<p>of like, there could be a business opportunity</p>
<p>for like a door dash for condoms.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Like delivery.</p>
<p>I thought about this.</p>
<p>Within five minute delivery of a condom at any location,</p>
<p>like Uber for condoms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about it, not with condoms,</p>
<p>but a very similar line of thinking,</p>
<p>a line that you&rsquo;re going into in terms of Uber</p>
<p>and people getting drunk when they enter the bar</p>
<p>playing to have one or two,</p>
<p>they ended up having five or six,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, okay, yeah, you can take the cab home,</p>
<p>the Uber home, but you&rsquo;ve left your car there.</p>
<p>It might get towed.</p>
<p>You might like, there&rsquo;s also the hassle of just,</p>
<p>you wanna wake up tomorrow with your hangover</p>
<p>and forget about it and move on.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people in their situation,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, screw it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take the risk, just get it.</p>
<p>What if you had an Uber service where two,</p>
<p>you have a car come out with two drivers</p>
<p>and one of them, two sober drivers, obviously,</p>
<p>and the person, the one driver drops off the other</p>
<p>that then drives you home in their car, in your car,</p>
<p>so that you can, I mean,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people would pay 50 bucks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be more than a regular Uber,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s gonna be done.</p>
<p>I got the money.</p>
<p>I already spent 60 bucks at the bar tonight.</p>
<p>Like, just get the damn thing done tomorrow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>
<p>I wake up, my car&rsquo;s in front of my house.</p>
<p>I think that would be, I think someone could,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna open that business,</p>
<p>so if anyone hears this and wants to take off with that,</p>
<p>I think it could help a lot of people.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>And Uber itself, I would say,</p>
<p>helped a huge amount of people,</p>
<p>just making it easy to make the decision</p>
<p>of going home, not driving yourself.</p>
<p>I read about in Austin where they,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s at now,</p>
<p>where they outlawed Uber for a while.</p>
<p>You know, because of the whole taxicab union type thing</p>
<p>and how just, yeah, there were like hordes of drunk people</p>
<p>that were used to Uber</p>
<p>that now didn&rsquo;t have a cheap alternative.</p>
<p>So just, we didn&rsquo;t exactly mention,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done a lot of studies in sexual decision making</p>
<p>with different drugs.</p>
<p>Is there some interesting insights or findings</p>
<p>on the difference between the different drugs?</p>
<p>So I think you said meth as well.</p>
<p>So cocaine, is there some interesting characteristics</p>
<p>about decision making that these drugs alter</p>
<p>versus like alcohol, all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>I think, and there&rsquo;s much more to study with this,</p>
<p>but I think the biggie there is that the stimulants,</p>
<p>they create risky sex by really increasing</p>
<p>the rewarding value of sex.</p>
<p>Like if you talk to people that are really,</p>
<p>especially that are hooked on stimulants,</p>
<p>one of the biggies is like sex on coke or meth</p>
<p>is like so much better than sex without.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big part of why they have trouble quitting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so tied to their sex life.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that your decision making is broken,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that you, well, you allocate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different aspect of their decision.</p>
<p>Yeah, on the reward side.</p>
<p>I think on the alcohol, it works more through disinhibition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, alcohol is really good at reducing the ability</p>
<p>of a delayed punisher to have an effect on current behavior.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s this bad thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna happen tomorrow or a week from now</p>
<p>or 20 years from now.</p>
<p>Being drunk is a really good way,</p>
<p>and you see this in like rats making decisions.</p>
<p>A high dose of alcohol makes someone less sensitive</p>
<p>to those consequences.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the lever that&rsquo;s being hit with alcohol</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the more, just the increasing the rewarding value</p>
<p>of sex by the psycho stimulants on that side.</p>
<p>We actually found that it, and it was amazing</p>
<p>because like hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent</p>
<p>by NIH to study the connection between cocaine and HIV.</p>
<p>Like we ran the first study on my grant</p>
<p>that like actually just gave people cocaine</p>
<p>under double blind conditions and showed that like,</p>
<p>yeah, when people are on coke,</p>
<p>like their ratings of sexual desire,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re not in a sexual situation,</p>
<p>yeah, you&rsquo;ve shown them some pictures,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just saying they&rsquo;re horny.</p>
<p>Like you get subjective ratings</p>
<p>of like how much sexual desire are you feeling right now.</p>
<p>People get horny when they&rsquo;re on stimulants.</p>
<p>And a lot of people say, duh,</p>
<p>if they really know these drugs.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a rigorous study that&rsquo;s in the lab</p>
<p>that shows like there&rsquo;s a plot.</p>
<p>Right, the dose effects of that, the time course of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not just.</p>
<p>Can you please tell me there&rsquo;s a paper with a plot</p>
<p>that shows dose versus evaluation of like horniness.</p>
<p>Yeah, we didn&rsquo;t say horniness.</p>
<p>We said sexual arousal, yeah, basically, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a plot, I&rsquo;m gonna find this plot.</p>
<p>Right, I&rsquo;ll send it to you.</p>
<p>There was one headline from some publicity on the work</p>
<p>that said, horny cocaine users don&rsquo;t use condoms</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>You gotta love journalism.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have put it that way, but like, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what it finds.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve published a bunch of studies on psychedelics.</p>
<p>Is there some especially favorite insightful findings</p>
<p>from some of these that you could talk about?</p>
<p>So maybe favorite studies or just something</p>
<p>that pops to mind in terms of both the goals</p>
<p>and like the major insights gained</p>
<p>and maybe the side little curiosities</p>
<p>that you discovered along the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think of the work with like using psilocybin</p>
<p>to help people quit smoking.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve talked about smoking being such a serious addiction</p>
<p>and so that what inspired me to get into that</p>
<p>was just kind of having like behavioral psychology</p>
<p>as my primary lens, sort of this sort of like,</p>
<p>you know, kind of radical empirical basis of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really interested in the mystical experience</p>
<p>and all of these reports, very interested.</p>
<p>And, but at the same time, I&rsquo;m like, okay,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get down to some behavior change</p>
<p>and something that we can record,</p>
<p>like quantitatively verify biologically.</p>
<p>So find all kinds of negative behaviors</p>
<p>that people practice and see if we can turn those</p>
<p>into positive or change their behavior.</p>
<p>Right, like really change it, not just people saying,</p>
<p>which again is interesting, I&rsquo;m not dismissing it,</p>
<p>but folks that say my life has turned around,</p>
<p>I feel this has completely changed me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yep, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s see if we can harness that and test that.</p>
<p>And just something that&rsquo;s real behavior change.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quantifiable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, you&rsquo;ve been smoking for 30 years,</p>
<p>you know, like that&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve tried a dozen times, like seriously to quit</p>
<p>and you haven&rsquo;t been able to long term, like, okay.</p>
<p>And if you quit, like we&rsquo;ll ask you and I&rsquo;ll believe you,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t trust everyone reading the paper to believe you.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna have you pee in a cup and we&rsquo;ll test that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll have you blow into this little machine</p>
<p>that measures carbon monoxide and we&rsquo;ll test that.</p>
<p>So multiple levels of biological verification.</p>
<p>Like now we&rsquo;re getting like,</p>
<p>to me that&rsquo;s where the rubber meets the road</p>
<p>in terms of like therapeutics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, can we really shift behavior?</p>
<p>And since, and so much as we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>my other scientific work outside of psychedelics</p>
<p>is about understanding addiction and drug use.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you know, looking at addiction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a no brainer and smoking is just a great example.</p>
<p>And so back to your question,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve had really high success rates.</p>
<p>I mean, it really, it rivals anything that&rsquo;s been published</p>
<p>in the scientific literature.</p>
<p>The caveat is that, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s based on our initial trial of only 15 people,</p>
<p>but extremely high longterm success rates,</p>
<p>80% at six months per smoke free.</p>
<p>So can we discuss the details of this?</p>
<p>So first of all, which psychedelic are we talking about?</p>
<p>And maybe can you talk about the 15 people</p>
<p>and how the study ran and what you found?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So the drug we&rsquo;re using is psilocybin</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re using moderately high and high doses of psilocybin.</p>
<p>And I should say this about most of our work,</p>
<p>these are not kind of museum level doses.</p>
<p>In other words, nothing,</p>
<p>even big fans of psychedelics wanna take</p>
<p>and go to a concert or go to the museum.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s at Burning Man on this type of dose,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re probably gonna wanna find their way back</p>
<p>to their tent and zip up and hunker down</p>
<p>for, you know, not be around strangers.</p>
<p>By the way, the delivery method,</p>
<p>so psilocybin is mushrooms, I guess.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the usual, is it edible?</p>
<p>Is there some other way?</p>
<p>Like, how is people supposed to think</p>
<p>about the correct dosing of these things?</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;ve heard that it&rsquo;s hard to dose correctly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So in our studies, we use the pure compound psilocybin.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a single molecule, you know, a bunch of molecules.</p>
<p>And we give them a capsule with that in it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just, you know, a little capsule, they swallow.</p>
<p>What people, when psilocybin is used outside of research,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always in the context of mushrooms</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re so easy to grow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no market for synthetic psilocybin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason for that to pop up.</p>
<p>The high dose that we use in research is 30 milligrams,</p>
<p>body weight adjusted.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a heavier person,</p>
<p>it might be like 40 or even 50 milligrams.</p>
<p>We have some data that, based on that data,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually moving into like getting away</p>
<p>from the body weight adjusting of the dose</p>
<p>and just giving an absolute dose.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s no justification</p>
<p>for the body weight based dosing, but I digress.</p>
<p>Generally 30, 40 milligrams, it&rsquo;s a high dose.</p>
<p>And based on average, even though, as you alluded to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s variability, which gets people into some trouble</p>
<p>in terms of mushrooms, like psilocybe cubensis,</p>
<p>which is the most common species</p>
<p>in the illicit market in the US.</p>
<p>This is about equivalent to five dried grams,</p>
<p>which is right at about where McKenna and others,</p>
<p>they call it a heroic dose.</p>
<p>This is not hanging out with your friends,</p>
<p>going to the concert again.</p>
<p>So this is a real deal dose, even to people that really,</p>
<p>just even to psychonauts.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve even had a number of studies.</p>
<p>Psychonauts?</p>
<p>Yeah, people that, yeah, astronaut or cosmonaut,</p>
<p>like for psychedelics.</p>
<p>Yeah, going as far out as possible.</p>
<p>But even for them, even for those</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve flown to space before.</p>
<p>Right, right, they&rsquo;re like, holy shit,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the orbit would be that far out.</p>
<p>Or I escaped the orbit, I was in interplanetary space there.</p>
<p>So these folks, the 15 folks in the study,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a question of dose being too low</p>
<p>to truly have an impact.</p>
<p>Right, right, out of hundreds of volunteers over the years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve only seen a couple of people</p>
<p>where there was a mild effect of the 30 milligrams.</p>
<p>And who knows, that person&rsquo;s, their serotonins,</p>
<p>they might have lesser density</p>
<p>of serotonin 2A receptors or something, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s extremely rare.</p>
<p>For most people, this is like something interesting</p>
<p>is gonna happen, put it that way.</p>
<p>Speaking of Joe Rogan, I think that Jamie,</p>
<p>his producer, is immune to psychedelics.</p>
<p>So maybe he&rsquo;s a good recruit for the study to test.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not, the caveat is I&rsquo;m not encouraging</p>
<p>anything illicit, but just theoretically,</p>
<p>my first question as a behavioral pharmacologist</p>
<p>is like, you know, increase the dose.</p>
<p>You know, like really, let&rsquo;s see the full dose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not telling him, Jamie, to do that,</p>
<p>but like, okay, like, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking the same amount</p>
<p>that friends might be taking, but yeah.</p>
<p>But he was also referring to the psychedelic effects</p>
<p>of edible marijuana, which is,</p>
<p>is there rules on dosage for like marijuana?</p>
<p>Is there limits?</p>
<p>Like what place where it&rsquo;s, this is, this all goes,</p>
<p>it probably is state by state, right?</p>
<p>It is, but most, they&rsquo;ve gone that direction</p>
<p>in states that didn&rsquo;t initially have these rules</p>
<p>have now have them.</p>
<p>So it was like, you&rsquo;ll get, I think, you know,</p>
<p>five, 10 mil, I think 10, five or 10 milligrams of THC</p>
<p>being a common, and like, and this is an important thing,</p>
<p>like where they&rsquo;ve moved from not being allowed to say,</p>
<p>like have a whole candy bar</p>
<p>and have each of the eight or 10 squares</p>
<p>on the candy bar being 10 milligrams,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, no, the whole thing,</p>
<p>because like, you know, someone gets a candy bar,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eating the freaking candy bar.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, unless you&rsquo;re a daily cannabis user,</p>
<p>if you take, you know, a hundred milligrams,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s what could lead to a bad trip for someone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know, a lot of these people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, you used to smoke a little weed in college,</p>
<p>they might say they&rsquo;re visiting Denver</p>
<p>for a business trip and they&rsquo;re like, why not?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give it a shot, you know?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh, I don&rsquo;t want to smoke something</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to, so I&rsquo;m going to be safer</p>
<p>with this edible, they might consume this massive,</p>
<p>you know, but there&rsquo;s huge tolerance.</p>
<p>So a regular, like for someone who&rsquo;s smoking weed every day,</p>
<p>they might take five milligrams</p>
<p>and kind of hardly feel anything.</p>
<p>And they may really need something like 30, 40, 50 milligrams</p>
<p>to have a strong effect.</p>
<p>But yeah, so they&rsquo;ve evolved in terms of the rules</p>
<p>about like, okay, what constitutes a dose, you know?</p>
<p>Which is why you see less big candy bars and more,</p>
<p>or if it is a whole candy bar,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only getting a smaller dose like 10 milligrams or,</p>
<p>yeah, because that&rsquo;s where people get in trouble</p>
<p>more often with edibles.</p>
<p>Yeah, except Joey Diaz, which I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s definitely somebody I want to talk to</p>
<p>out of the crazy comedians I want to talk to as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, so yeah, the study of the 15</p>
<p>and the dose not being a question.</p>
<p>So like, what was the recruitment based on?</p>
<p>What was the, like, how did the study get conducted?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the recruitment, and I really liked this fact,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t people that, you know, largely were, you know,</p>
<p>we were honest about what we were studying,</p>
<p>but for most people, it was,</p>
<p>they were in the category of like, you know,</p>
<p>not particularly interested in psychedelics,</p>
<p>but more of like, they want to quit smoking.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve tried everything but the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>And this sounds like the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>You know, and it&rsquo;s like, well, it&rsquo;s Hopkins.</p>
<p>So, you know, thinking that sounds like it&rsquo;s safe enough.</p>
<p>So like, what the hell, let&rsquo;s give it a shot.</p>
<p>Like most of them were in that category,</p>
<p>which I really, you know, I appreciate</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more of a test, you know, of, yeah,</p>
<p>just like a better model of what,</p>
<p>if these are approved as medicines,</p>
<p>like what you&rsquo;re going to have the average participant,</p>
<p>you know, be like.</p>
<p>And so the therapy involves a good amount</p>
<p>of non psilocybin sessions, of preparatory sessions,</p>
<p>like eight hours of getting to know the person,</p>
<p>like the two people who are going to be their guides</p>
<p>or the person in the room with them during the experience,</p>
<p>having these discussions with them</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re both kind of rapport building,</p>
<p>just kind of discussing their life, getting to know them,</p>
<p>but then also telling them, preparing them</p>
<p>about the psilocybin experience.</p>
<p>Oh, it could be scary in this sense,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s how to handle it, trust, let go, be open.</p>
<p>And also during that preparation time,</p>
<p>preparing them to quit smoking,</p>
<p>using really standard bread and butter techniques</p>
<p>that can all fall under the label typically</p>
<p>of the cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>just stuff like before you quit,</p>
<p>we assign a target quit date ahead of time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just quitting on the fly.</p>
<p>And that happens to be the target quit date</p>
<p>in our study was the day</p>
<p>where they got the first psilocybin dose,</p>
<p>but doing things like keeping a smoking diary,</p>
<p>like, okay, during the three weeks until you quit,</p>
<p>every time you smoke a cigarette,</p>
<p>just like jot down what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re feeling, what situation, that type of thing.</p>
<p>And then having some discussion around that</p>
<p>and then going over the pluses and minuses in their life</p>
<p>that smoking kind of comes with</p>
<p>and being honest about the, this is what it does for me,</p>
<p>this is why I like it, this is why I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Preparing for like, what if you do slip, how to handle it,</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t dwell on guilt</p>
<p>because that leads to more full on relapse,</p>
<p>just kind of treat it as a learning experience,</p>
<p>that type of thing.</p>
<p>Then you have the session day where they come in,</p>
<p>five minutes of questionnaires,</p>
<p>but pretty much they jump into the,</p>
<p>we touch base with them and we give them the capsule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a serious setting, but a comfortable one.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in a room that looks more like a living room</p>
<p>than like a research lab.</p>
<p>We measure their blood pressure, their experience,</p>
<p>but kind of minimal kind of medical vibe to it.</p>
<p>And they lay down on a couch</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a purposefully an introspective experience.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re laying on a couch</p>
<p>during most of the five to six hour experience</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re wearing eye shades,</p>
<p>which is a better connotation as a name than blindfold.</p>
<p>But like, yeah, so they&rsquo;re wearing eye shades,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s, and they&rsquo;re wearing headphones</p>
<p>through which music is played, mostly classical,</p>
<p>although we&rsquo;ve done some variation of that.</p>
<p>I have a paper that was recently accepted</p>
<p>kind of comparing it to more like gongs</p>
<p>and harmonic bowls and that type of thing,</p>
<p>kind of like sound, you know, kind of.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also added this to the science</p>
<p>and have a paper on the musical accompaniment</p>
<p>to the psychedelic experience, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Right, and we found basically that about the same effect,</p>
<p>even by a trend, not significant,</p>
<p>but a little bit better of an effect,</p>
<p>both in terms of subjective experience and longterm,</p>
<p>whether it helped people quit smoking,</p>
<p>just a little tiny non significant trend</p>
<p>even favoring the novel playlist</p>
<p>with the Tibetan singing bowls and the gongs</p>
<p>and didgeridoo and all of that.</p>
<p>And so anyway, just saying, okay,</p>
<p>we can deviate a little bit from this,</p>
<p>like what goes back to the 1950s of this method</p>
<p>of using classical music as part of this psychedelic therapy,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re listening to the music</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not playing DJ in real time.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, you know, they&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>be the baby, you&rsquo;re not the decision maker for today,</p>
<p>go inward, trust, let go, be open.</p>
<p>And pretty much the only interaction,</p>
<p>like that we&rsquo;re there for is to deal</p>
<p>with any anxiety that comes up.</p>
<p>So guide is kind of a misnomer in a sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re more of a safety net.</p>
<p>And so like, tell us if you feel some butterflies</p>
<p>that we can provide reassurance,</p>
<p>a hold of their hand can be very powerful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had people tell me that that was like the thing</p>
<p>that really just grounded them.</p>
<p>Can you break apart trust, let go, be open?</p>
<p>What, so in a sense,</p>
<p>how would you describe the experience,</p>
<p>the intellectual and the emotional approach</p>
<p>that people are supposed to take</p>
<p>to really let go into the experience?</p>
<p>Yeah, so trust is, trust the context,</p>
<p>you know, trust the guides,</p>
<p>trust the overall institutional context.</p>
<p>I see it as layers of like safety,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s everything I told you</p>
<p>about the relative bodily safety of psilocybin.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we&rsquo;re still getting blood pressure</p>
<p>throughout the session, just in case.</p>
<p>We have a physician on hand who can respond just in case.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re literally across the street</p>
<p>from the emergency department, just in case.</p>
<p>You know, all of that, you know.</p>
<p>Privacy is another thing you&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>is just trusting that you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>and whatever happens is just between you</p>
<p>and the people in the study.</p>
<p>Right, and hopefully they&rsquo;ve really gotten that</p>
<p>by that point deep into the study</p>
<p>that like they realize where do we take that seriously</p>
<p>and everything else, you know.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really kind of like a very special role</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re playing as a researcher or a guide</p>
<p>and hopefully they have your trust.</p>
<p>And so, you know, and trust that they could be as emotional,</p>
<p>everything from laughter to tears,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s gonna be welcomed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not judging them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a therapeutic relationship</p>
<p>where, you know, this is a safe container.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a safe space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of baggage to that term,</p>
<p>but it truly is, it&rsquo;s a safe space for that,</p>
<p>for this type of experience and to let go.</p>
<p>So trust, let&rsquo;s see, let go.</p>
<p>So that relates to the emotional, like,</p>
<p>you feel like crying, cry.</p>
<p>You feel like laughing your ass off, laugh your ass off.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like all the things actually</p>
<p>that sometimes it&rsquo;s more challenging</p>
<p>with someone has a large recreational use,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s harder for them</p>
<p>because people in that context, and understandably so,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more about holding your shit.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s had a bunch of mushrooms at a party.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t wanna go into the back room</p>
<p>and start crying about these thoughts</p>
<p>about the relationship with their mother.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t wanna be the drama queen or king</p>
<p>that bring their friends down</p>
<p>because their friends are having an experience too.</p>
<p>And so they wanna like compose, you know.</p>
<p>And also just the appearance in social settings</p>
<p>versus the, so like prioritizing how you appear to others</p>
<p>versus the prioritizing the depth of the experience.</p>
<p>And here in the study, you can prioritize the experience.</p>
<p>Right, and it&rsquo;s all about, like you&rsquo;re the astronaut</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only one astronaut.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re ground control.</p>
<p>And I use this often with,</p>
<p>I have a photo of the space shuttle on a plaque</p>
<p>in my office and I kind of often use that as an example.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re here for you.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re a team, but we have different roles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, you don&rsquo;t have to like compose yourself.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have to like be concerned about our safety.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re playing these roles today.</p>
<p>And like, yeah, your job is to go as deep as possible</p>
<p>or as far out, whatever your analogy is, like as possible.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re keeping you safe.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, and the emotional side is a hard one</p>
<p>because you really want people to,</p>
<p>like if they go into realms of subjectively</p>
<p>of despair and sorrow, like, yeah, like cry, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And especially if someone&rsquo;s more macho</p>
<p>and you want this to be the place where they can let go.</p>
<p>And again, something that they wouldn&rsquo;t or shouldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>if someone were to theoretically use it</p>
<p>in a social setting.</p>
<p>And like, and also these other things,</p>
<p>like even that you get in those social settings of like,</p>
<p>yeah, you don&rsquo;t have to like worry about your wallet</p>
<p>for being taken advantage or especially for a woman</p>
<p>sexually assaulted by some creep at a concert or something.</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re, you know, they&rsquo;re laying down,</p>
<p>being far out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a million sources of anxiety</p>
<p>that are external versus internal.</p>
<p>So you can just focus on your own,</p>
<p>like the beautiful thing that&rsquo;s going on in your mind.</p>
<p>And even the cops at that layer,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely for most people</p>
<p>that cops would come in and bust them right when,</p>
<p>like even at that theoretical,</p>
<p>like that one in a billion chance,</p>
<p>like that might be a real thing psychologically.</p>
<p>In this context, we even got that covered.</p>
<p>This is, we&rsquo;ve got DEA approval.</p>
<p>Like you are, this is okay by every level of society</p>
<p>that counts, you know, that has the authority.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, so go deep, trust the, you know, trust the setting,</p>
<p>trust yourself, you know, let go and be open.</p>
<p>So in the experience, and this is all subjective</p>
<p>and by analogy, but like, if there&rsquo;s a door, open it,</p>
<p>go into it.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a stairwell, go down it or a stairway, go up it.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a monster in the mind&rsquo;s eye, you know,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t run, approach it, look in the eye and say, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s up, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk Turkey, you know?</p>
<p>And I thought.</p>
<p>Dave Goggins entered the chat, okay.</p>
<p>Right, right, it really is that,</p>
<p>that really is a heart of it, this radical courage.</p>
<p>Like it. Courage.</p>
<p>People are often struck by that coming out.</p>
<p>Like this is heavy lifting, this is a hard work.</p>
<p>People come out of this exhausted and it can be extremely,</p>
<p>some people say it&rsquo;s the most difficult thing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done in their life.</p>
<p>Like choosing to let go on a moment,</p>
<p>a microsecond by microsecond basis.</p>
<p>Everything in their inclination is to say stop,</p>
<p>sometimes stop this, I don&rsquo;t like this,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know it was gonna be like this, this is too much.</p>
<p>And Terrence McKenna put it this way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like comparing to meditation and other techniques,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like spending years trying to press the accelerator</p>
<p>to make something happen.</p>
<p>High dose psychedelics is like you&rsquo;re speeding down</p>
<p>the mountain in a fully loaded semi truck</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re charged with not slamming the brake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, let it happen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very difficult and to engage,</p>
<p>always go further into it and take that radical,</p>
<p>radical courage throughout.</p>
<p>What do they say in self report?</p>
<p>If you can put general words to it,</p>
<p>what is their experience like?</p>
<p>What do they say it&rsquo;s like?</p>
<p>Because these are many people, like you said,</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t probably read much about psychedelics</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t have like with Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>like language or stories to put on it.</p>
<p>So this is very raw self report of experiences.</p>
<p>What do they say the experience is like?</p>
<p>Yeah, and some more so than others,</p>
<p>cause everyone has been exposed at some level or another,</p>
<p>but some it is pretty superficial as you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of psychedelics</p>
<p>is just their variability.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m more stressed, it&rsquo;s like not the mean,</p>
<p>but the standard deviation is so wide that it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it could be like hellish experiences</p>
<p>and just absolutely beautiful and loving experiences,</p>
<p>everything in between and both of those,</p>
<p>like those could be two minutes apart from each other.</p>
<p>And sometimes kind of at the same time concurrently.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see, there&rsquo;s different ways to,</p>
<p>there were some Jungian psychologists back in the 60s,</p>
<p>masters in Houston that wrote a really good book,</p>
<p>The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience,</p>
<p>which is a play on varieties of religious experience</p>
<p>by William James, that they described this,</p>
<p>a perceptual level.</p>
<p>So most people have that when,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re looking at the room without the eyeshades on</p>
<p>or inside their mind&rsquo;s eye with the eyeshades on,</p>
<p>colors, sounds like this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a much richer sensorium,</p>
<p>which can be very interesting.</p>
<p>And then at another level, a master&rsquo;s in Houston</p>
<p>called it the psychodynamic level.</p>
<p>And I think you could think about it more broadly than,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of Jungian,</p>
<p>but just the personal psychological levels,</p>
<p>how I think of it, like this is about your life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole life review.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people have thoughts about their childhood,</p>
<p>about their relationships, their spouse or partner,</p>
<p>their children, their parents, their family of origin,</p>
<p>their current family, that stuff comes up a lot,</p>
<p>including people just pouring with tears</p>
<p>about how much, it hits them so hard</p>
<p>how much they love people.</p>
<p>Like in a way, for people that they&rsquo;d love their family,</p>
<p>but it just hits them so hard that how important this is</p>
<p>and the magnitude of that love</p>
<p>and what that means in their life.</p>
<p>So those are some of the most moving experiences</p>
<p>to be present for is where people like it hits home,</p>
<p>like what really matters in their life.</p>
<p>And then you have this sort of what masters in Houston</p>
<p>called the archetypal realm,</p>
<p>which again is sort of Jungian with the focus on archetypes,</p>
<p>which is interesting,</p>
<p>but I think of that more generally as like symbolic level.</p>
<p>So just really deep experiences where you have,</p>
<p>you do have experiences that seem symbolic of,</p>
<p>very much in like what we know about dreaming</p>
<p>and what most people think about dreaming,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s this randomness of things,</p>
<p>but sometimes it&rsquo;s pretty clear in retrospect,</p>
<p>oh, like this came up</p>
<p>because this thing has been on my mind recently.</p>
<p>So it seems to be, there seems to be this symbolic level.</p>
<p>And then they have this,</p>
<p>the last level that they describe</p>
<p>is the mystical integral level,</p>
<p>which this is where there&rsquo;s lots of terms for it,</p>
<p>but transcendental experiences, experiences of unity,</p>
<p>mystical type effects we often measure.</p>
<p>Europeans use a scale</p>
<p>that will refer to oceanic boundlessness.</p>
<p>This is all pretty much the same thing.</p>
<p>This is like at some sense,</p>
<p>the deepest level of the very sense of self</p>
<p>seems to be dissolved, minimize, or expanded,</p>
<p>such that the boundaries of the self go into in here.</p>
<p>I think some of this is just semantics,</p>
<p>but whether the self is expanding</p>
<p>such that there&rsquo;s no boundary between the self</p>
<p>and the rest of the universe,</p>
<p>or whether there&rsquo;s no sense of self,</p>
<p>again, might be just semantics,</p>
<p>but this radical shift or sense of loss</p>
<p>of sense of self or self boundaries.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the most,</p>
<p>typically when people have that experience,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll often report that as being the most remarkable thing.</p>
<p>And this is what you don&rsquo;t typically get with MDMA,</p>
<p>these deepest levels of the nature of reality itself,</p>
<p>the subjectivity and objectivity,</p>
<p>just like the seer and the seen become one,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a process, and yeah.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re able to bring that experience back</p>
<p>and be able to describe it?</p>
<p>Yeah, but one of the, to a degree,</p>
<p>but one of the hallmarks going back to William James</p>
<p>of describing a mystical experience is the ineffability.</p>
<p>And so even though it&rsquo;s ineffable,</p>
<p>people try as far as they can to describe it,</p>
<p>but when you get the real deal, they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>and even though they say a lot of helpful things</p>
<p>to help you describe the landscape,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say, no matter what I say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not even coming anywhere close to what this was.</p>
<p>Like the language is completely failing.</p>
<p>And I like to joke that even though it&rsquo;s ineffable,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re researchers,</p>
<p>so we try to eff it up</p>
<p>by asking them to describe the experience.</p>
<p>I love it, it&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>But to bring it back a little bit,</p>
<p>so for that particular study on tobacco,</p>
<p>what was the results, what was the conclusions</p>
<p>in terms of the impact of psilocybin on their addiction?</p>
<p>So in that pilot study, it was very small</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t a randomized study, so it was limited.</p>
<p>The only question we could really answer was,</p>
<p>is this worthy enough of followup?</p>
<p>And the answer to that was absolutely,</p>
<p>because the success rates were so high,</p>
<p>80% biologically confirmed successful at six months,</p>
<p>that held up to 60% biologically confirmed abstinent</p>
<p>at an average of two and a half years, a very long fall.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so, I mean, the best that&rsquo;s been reported</p>
<p>in the literature for smoking cessation</p>
<p>is in the upper 50%, and that&rsquo;s with not one,</p>
<p>but two medications for a couple of months,</p>
<p>followed by regular cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re coming in once a week or once every few weeks</p>
<p>for an entire year.</p>
<p>And so it was very heavy.</p>
<p>This is just like a few uses of psilocybin?</p>
<p>So this was three doses of psilocybin</p>
<p>over a total course, including preparation, everything,</p>
<p>a 15 week period, where there&rsquo;s mainly like,</p>
<p>for most part, one meeting a week,</p>
<p>and then the three sessions are within that.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, and we scaled that back</p>
<p>in the more, the study we&rsquo;re doing right now,</p>
<p>which I can tell you about,</p>
<p>which is a randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, yeah, the original pilot study</p>
<p>was these 15 people.</p>
<p>So given the positive signal from the first study</p>
<p>telling us that it was a worthy pursuit,</p>
<p>we hustled up some money</p>
<p>to actually be able to afford a larger trial.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s randomizing 80 people</p>
<p>to get either one psilocybin session,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve scaled that down from three to one,</p>
<p>mainly because we&rsquo;re doing fMRI neuroimaging</p>
<p>before and after,</p>
<p>and it made it more experimentally complex</p>
<p>to have multiple sessions.</p>
<p>But one psilocybin session versus the nicotine patch</p>
<p>using the FDA approved label,</p>
<p>like standard use of the nicotine patch.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s randomized, 40 people get randomized to psilocybin,</p>
<p>one session, 40 people get nicotine patch.</p>
<p>And they all get the same cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>sort of the standard talk therapy.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve scaled it down somewhat,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s less weekly meetings,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s within the same ballpark.</p>
<p>And right now we&rsquo;re still,</p>
<p>the study&rsquo;s still ongoing.</p>
<p>And in fact, we just recently started recruiting again,</p>
<p>we paused for COVID.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re starting back up with some protections</p>
<p>like masks and whatnot.</p>
<p>But right now for the 44 people</p>
<p>who have gotten through the one year followup,</p>
<p>and so that includes 22 from each of the two groups,</p>
<p>the success rates are extremely high.</p>
<p>For the psilocybin group,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 59% have been biologically confirmed as smoke free</p>
<p>at one year after their quit date.</p>
<p>And that compares to 27% for the nicotine patch,</p>
<p>which by the way is extremely good for the nicotine patch</p>
<p>compared to previous research.</p>
<p>So the results could change because it&rsquo;s ongoing,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re mostly done</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still looking extremely positive.</p>
<p>So if anyone&rsquo;s interested,</p>
<p>they have to be sort of be in commuting distance</p>
<p>to the Baltimore area, but you know.</p>
<p>To participate.</p>
<p>Right, right, to participate.</p>
<p>This is a good moment to bring up something.</p>
<p>I think a lot of what you talked about is super interesting.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people listening to this,</p>
<p>so now it&rsquo;s anywhere from 300 to 600,000 people</p>
<p>for just a regular podcast.</p>
<p>I know a lot of them will be very interested</p>
<p>in what you&rsquo;re saying and they&rsquo;re going to look you up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to find your email</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to write you a long email</p>
<p>about some of the interesting things they&rsquo;ve found</p>
<p>in any of your papers.</p>
<p>How should people contact you?</p>
<p>What is the best way for that?</p>
<p>Would you recommend?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a super busy guy.</p>
<p>You have a million things going on.</p>
<p>How should people communicate with you?</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this up.</p>
<p>This is a, I&rsquo;m glad to get the opportunity to address this.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s interested in participating in a study,</p>
<p>the best thing to do is go to the website.</p>
<p>Of the study or of like, yeah, which website?</p>
<p>So we have all of our psilocybin studies.</p>
<p>So everything we have is up on one website</p>
<p>and then we link to the different study websites,</p>
<p>but hopkinspsychedelic.org.</p>
<p>So everything we do, or if you don&rsquo;t remember that,</p>
<p>just go to your favorite search engine</p>
<p>and look up Johns Hopkins Psychedelic</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to find one of the first hits</p>
<p>is going to be our, is this website.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to be links to the smoking study</p>
<p>and all of our other studies.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s no link to it there,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have a study on it now.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in psychedelic research more broadly,</p>
<p>you can look up, like at another university</p>
<p>that might be closer to you.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a handful of them now across the country.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some in Europe that have studies going on,</p>
<p>but you can, at least in the US,</p>
<p>you can look at clinicaltrials.gov</p>
<p>and look up the term psilocybin.</p>
<p>And in fact, optionally people even in Europe</p>
<p>can register their trial on there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good way to find studies.</p>
<p>But for our research, rather than emailing me,</p>
<p>like a more efficient way is to go straight</p>
<p>and you can do that first, the first phase of screening.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some questions online</p>
<p>and then someone will get back in touch with you.</p>
<p>But I do already, you know,</p>
<p>and I expect it&rsquo;s like going to increase,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m already at the level where my simple limited mind</p>
<p>and limited capacity is already,</p>
<p>I sometimes fail to get back to emails.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m trying to respond to my colleagues,</p>
<p>my mentees, all these things, my responsibilities.</p>
<p>And as many of the people just inquiring</p>
<p>about I wanna go to graduate school,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in this, I had this,</p>
<p>I have a daughter that took a psychedelic</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s having trouble.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I try to respond to those,</p>
<p>but sometimes I just simply can&rsquo;t get to all of it already.</p>
<p>To be honest, like from my perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been quite heartbreaking</p>
<p>because I basically don&rsquo;t respond to any emails anymore.</p>
<p>And especially as you mentioned mentees and so on,</p>
<p>like outside of that circle,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s heartbreaking to me how many brilliant people</p>
<p>there are, thoughtful people, like loving people.</p>
<p>And they write long emails that are really,</p>
<p>by the way, I do read them very often.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the response is then you&rsquo;re starting a conversation.</p>
<p>And the heartbreaking aspect is you only have</p>
<p>so many hours in the day to have deep,</p>
<p>meaningful conversations with human beings on this earth.</p>
<p>And so you have to select who they are.</p>
<p>And usually it&rsquo;s your family,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s people like you&rsquo;re directly working with.</p>
<p>And even I guarantee you with this conversation,</p>
<p>people will write you long, really thoughtful emails.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;ll be brilliant people,</p>
<p>faculty from all over, PhD students from all over.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s heartbreaking</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t really get back to them.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying like many of them,</p>
<p>if you do respond, it&rsquo;s more like here,</p>
<p>go to this website when you&rsquo;re interested into the study,</p>
<p>just it makes sense to directly go to the site</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s applications open, just apply for the study.</p>
<p>Right, right, right, as either a volunteer</p>
<p>or if we&rsquo;re looking for somebody,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be posting,</p>
<p>including on the Hopkins University website,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be posting if we&rsquo;re looking for a position.</p>
<p>I am right now actually looking through</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s mainly been through email and contacts,</p>
<p>but should I say it?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d rather cast my nets wide,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m looking for a postdoc right now.</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve mentored postdocs for, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like a dozen years or so.</p>
<p>And more and more of their time</p>
<p>is being spent on psychedelics.</p>
<p>So someone&rsquo;s free to contact me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more of a, that&rsquo;s sort of so close to home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a personal, you know,</p>
<p>that like emailing me about that.</p>
<p>But I come to appreciate more the advice</p>
<p>that folks like Tim Ferriss have of like,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s him, like five cents emails,</p>
<p>you know, like a subject that gets to the point</p>
<p>that tells you what it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>so that like you break through the signal to the noise.</p>
<p>But I really appreciate what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>because part of the equation for me is like,</p>
<p>I have a three year old,</p>
<p>and like my time on the ground, on the floor,</p>
<p>playing blocks or cars with him is part of that equation.</p>
<p>And even if the day is ending</p>
<p>and I know some of those emails are slipping by</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll never get back to them.</p>
<p>And I have, I&rsquo;m struggling with it already.</p>
<p>And I get what you&rsquo;re saying is like,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen anything yet</p>
<p>if with the type of exposure that like your podcast gets.</p>
<p>This will bring in exposure.</p>
<p>And then I think in terms of postdocs,</p>
<p>this is a really good podcast</p>
<p>in the sense that there&rsquo;s a lot of brilliant PhD students</p>
<p>out there that are looking for a poster</p>
<p>from all over, from MIT, probably from Hopkins,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just all over the place.</p>
<p>So this is, and I, we have different preferences,</p>
<p>but my preference would also be to have like a form</p>
<p>that they could fill out for posts.</p>
<p>Because, you know, it&rsquo;s very difficult through email</p>
<p>to tell who&rsquo;s really going to be a strong collaborator</p>
<p>for you, like a strong postdoc, strong student,</p>
<p>because you want a bunch of details,</p>
<p>but at the same time,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want a million pages worth of email.</p>
<p>So you want a little bit of application process.</p>
<p>So usually you set up a form that helps me indicate</p>
<p>how passionate the person is,</p>
<p>how willing they are to do hard work.</p>
<p>Like I often ask a question,</p>
<p>people of what do you think is more important</p>
<p>to work hard or to work smart?</p>
<p>And I use that, those types of questions</p>
<p>to indicate who I would like to work with.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s counterintuitive.</p>
<p>But anyway, I&rsquo;ll leave that question unanswered</p>
<p>for people to figure out themselves.</p>
<p>But maybe if you know my love for David Goggins,</p>
<p>you will understand.</p>
<p>So anyway.</p>
<p>Those are good thoughts about the forms and everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that evolves.</p>
<p>Email is such a messy thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, speaking of Baltimore, Cal Newport,</p>
<p>if you know who that is,</p>
<p>he wrote a book called Deep Work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a computer science professor</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s currently working on a book about email,</p>
<p>about all the ways that email is broken.</p>
<p>So this is gonna be a fascinating read.</p>
<p>This is a little bit of a general question,</p>
<p>but almost a bigger picture question</p>
<p>that we touched on a little bit,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just touch it in a full way,</p>
<p>which is what have all the psychedelic studies</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve conducted taught you about the human mind,</p>
<p>about the human brain and the human mind?</p>
<p>Is there something,</p>
<p>if you look at the human scientists you were before</p>
<p>this work and the scientists you are now,</p>
<p>how has your understanding of the human mind changed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of that in two categories.</p>
<p>One kind of more scientific,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both scientific,</p>
<p>but one more about the brain and behavior</p>
<p>and the mind, so to speak.</p>
<p>And as a behaviorist,</p>
<p>all we see sort of the mind as a metaphor for behaviors,</p>
<p>but anyway, that gets philosophical.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really increasing the,</p>
<p>so the one category is increasing the appreciation</p>
<p>for the magnitude of depth.</p>
<p>I mean, so these are all metaphors of human experience.</p>
<p>That might be a good way to,</p>
<p>because you use certain words like consciousness</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re using constructs</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t well defined unless we kind of dig in,</p>
<p>but human experience like that,</p>
<p>the experiences on these compounds</p>
<p>can be so far out there or so deep.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing that by tinkering</p>
<p>with the same machinery that&rsquo;s going on up there.</p>
<p>I mean, my assumption,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s a good assumption is that all experiences,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a biological side to all phenomenal experience.</p>
<p>So there is not,</p>
<p>the divide between biology and experience or psychology</p>
<p>is, it&rsquo;s not one or the other.</p>
<p>These are just two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re avoiding the use</p>
<p>of the word consciousness, for example,</p>
<p>but the experience is referring</p>
<p>to the subjective experience.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the actual technical use</p>
<p>of the word consciousness of subjective experience.</p>
<p>And even that word, there are certain ways that like,</p>
<p>sort of like if we&rsquo;re talking about access consciousness</p>
<p>or narrative self awareness, which is an aspect of,</p>
<p>like you can wrap a definition around that</p>
<p>and we can talk meaningfully about it,</p>
<p>but so often around psychedelics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s used in this much more,</p>
<p>in terms of ultimately explaining</p>
<p>phenomenal consciousness itself,</p>
<p>the so called hard problem,</p>
<p>and relating to that question</p>
<p>and psychedelics really haven&rsquo;t spoken to that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>because like it&rsquo;s hard to imagine anything.</p>
<p>But I think what I was getting is that psychedelics</p>
<p>have done this by,</p>
<p>the reason I was getting into the biology versus mind,</p>
<p>psychology divide is that just to kind of set up the fact</p>
<p>that I think all of our experience is related</p>
<p>to these biological events.</p>
<p>So whether they be naturally occurring neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>like serotonin and dopamine and norepinephrine, et cetera,</p>
<p>and a whole other sort of biological activity</p>
<p>and kind of another layer up</p>
<p>that we could talk about as network activity,</p>
<p>communication amongst brain areas,</p>
<p>like this is always going on,</p>
<p>even if I just prompt you to think about a loved one,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s something happening biologically.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s always another side of the coin.</p>
<p>So another way to put that</p>
<p>is all of our subjective experience outside of drugs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all a controlled hallucination in a sense.</p>
<p>Like this is completely constructed.</p>
<p>Our experience of reality is completely a simulation.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re on solid ground to say</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s our best guess</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a pretty reasonable thing to say scientifically.</p>
<p>Like all the rich complexity of the world emerges</p>
<p>from just some biology and some chemicals.</p>
<p>So in that definition implied a causation, it comes from.</p>
<p>And so we know at least there&rsquo;s a solid correlation there.</p>
<p>And so then we delve deep into the philosophy</p>
<p>of like idealism or materialism and things like this,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not an expert in,</p>
<p>but I know we&rsquo;re getting into that territory.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even necessarily have to go there.</p>
<p>Like you at least go to the level of like,</p>
<p>okay, we know there seems to be this one on one</p>
<p>correspondence and that seems pretty solid.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t prove a negative and you can&rsquo;t prove,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s in that category of like,</p>
<p>you could come up with an experience</p>
<p>that maybe doesn&rsquo;t have a biological correlate,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also the limits of the science.</p>
<p>Is it a false negative?</p>
<p>But I think our best guess and a very decent assumption</p>
<p>is that every psychological event has a biological correlate.</p>
<p>So with that said, you know, the idea that you can throw,</p>
<p>alter that biology in a pretty trivial manner.</p>
<p>I mean, you could take like a relatively small number</p>
<p>of these molecules, throw them into the nervous system</p>
<p>and then have a 60 year old person who has,</p>
<p>you name it, I mean, that has hiked to the top of Everest</p>
<p>and that speaks five languages and that has been married</p>
<p>and has kids and grandkids and has,</p>
<p>you name it, you know, like been at the top and say,</p>
<p>this fundamentally changed who I am as a person</p>
<p>and what I think life is about.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the thing about psychedelics</p>
<p>that just floors me and it never fails.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes you get bogged down by the paperwork</p>
<p>and running studies and all the, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>all of the BS that can come with being in academia</p>
<p>and everything and then you,</p>
<p>and sometimes you get some dud sessions</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not the full, all the magic isn&rsquo;t happening</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, you know, more or less it&rsquo;s either a dud</p>
<p>or somewhere and I don&rsquo;t mean to dismiss them,</p>
<p>but you know, it&rsquo;s not like these magnificent</p>
<p>sort of reports, but sometimes you get the full Monty report</p>
<p>from one of these people and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s like therapeutically</p>
<p>or just to understand the mind and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re still floored, like how is that possible?</p>
<p>How did we slightly alter serotonergic neurotransmission</p>
<p>and say, and this person is now saying</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re making fundamental differences</p>
<p>in the priorities of their life after 60 years.</p>
<p>It also just fills you with awe of the possibility</p>
<p>of experiences we&rsquo;re yet to have uncovered.</p>
<p>If just a few chemicals can change so much,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, man, what if this could be up?</p>
<p>I mean, like how, cause we&rsquo;re just like took a little,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like lighting a match or something in the darkness</p>
<p>and you could see there&rsquo;s a lot more there,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know how much more.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And then like, where&rsquo;s that gonna go with like,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m always like aware of the fact</p>
<p>that like we always as humans and as scientists</p>
<p>think that we figured out 99%</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re working on that first 1%.</p>
<p>And we gotta keep reminding ourselves, it&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>Like we figured out like not even 1%, like we know nothing.</p>
<p>And so like, I can speculate and I might sound like a fool,</p>
<p>but like what are drugs, even the concept of drugs,</p>
<p>like 10 years, 50 years, 100 years, 1,000 years,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re surviving, like molecules that go</p>
<p>to a specific area of the brain</p>
<p>in combination with technology,</p>
<p>in combination with the magnetic stimulation,</p>
<p>in combination with the, like targeted pharmacology</p>
<p>of like, oh, like this subset of serotonin 2A receptors</p>
<p>in the claustrum, at this time, in this particular sequence</p>
<p>in combination with this other thing,</p>
<p>like this baseball cap you wear that like has,</p>
<p>has one of the, is doing some of these things</p>
<p>that we can only do with these like giant</p>
<p>like pieces of equipment now,</p>
<p>like where it&rsquo;s gonna go is gonna be endless.</p>
<p>And it becomes easy to combine within virtual reality</p>
<p>where the virtual reality is gonna move</p>
<p>from being something out here to being more in there.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re getting, like we talked about before,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re already in a virtual reality</p>
<p>in terms of human perception and cognition models</p>
<p>of the universe being all representations</p>
<p>and sort of color not existing and just our representations</p>
<p>of EM wavelengths, et cetera, sound,</p>
<p>being vibrations and all of this.</p>
<p>And so as the external VR and the internal VR</p>
<p>come closer to each other,</p>
<p>like this is what I think about</p>
<p>in terms of the future of drugs.</p>
<p>Like all of this stuff sort of combines</p>
<p>and like where that goes is just, it&rsquo;s unthinkable.</p>
<p>Like we were probably gonna, you know,</p>
<p>again, I might sound like a fool and this may not happen,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s possible, you know,</p>
<p>to go completely offline,</p>
<p>like where most of people&rsquo;s experiences maybe</p>
<p>going into these internal worlds.</p>
<p>And I mean, maybe you through some,</p>
<p>through a combination of these techniques,</p>
<p>you create experiences</p>
<p>where someone could live a thousand years</p>
<p>in terms of maybe they&rsquo;re living a regular lifespan,</p>
<p>but in over the next two seconds,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re living a thousand years worth of experience.</p>
<p>Inside your mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, through this manipulation of them.</p>
<p>Like, is that possible?</p>
<p>Like just based on like first principles and like.</p>
<p>Yeah, first principles, yes.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Like give us another 50, 100, 500, like who knows,</p>
<p>but like how could it not go there?</p>
<p>In a small tangent, what are your thoughts</p>
<p>in this broader definition of drugs,</p>
<p>of psychedelics, of mind altering things?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Neuralink</p>
<p>and brain computer interfaces,</p>
<p>sort of being able to electrically stimulate</p>
<p>and read neuronal activity in the brain</p>
<p>and then connect that to the computer,</p>
<p>which is another way from a computational perspective</p>
<p>for me is kind of appealing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s another way of altering subtly</p>
<p>the behavior of the brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of, if you zoom out, reminiscent</p>
<p>of the way psychedelics do as well.</p>
<p>So what do you have?</p>
<p>Like what are your thoughts about Neuralink?</p>
<p>What are your hopes as a researcher</p>
<p>of mind altering devices, systems, chemicals?</p>
<p>I guess broadly speaking, I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>
<p>I mean, for the same reason I am with psychedelics,</p>
<p>but it comes with all the caveats.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re going into a brave new world</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like all of a sudden</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a dark side.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be serious ethical considerations,</p>
<p>but that should not stop us from moving there.</p>
<p>I mean, particularly the stuff from, and I&rsquo;m no expert,</p>
<p>but on the short list in the short term, it&rsquo;s like, yeah,</p>
<p>can we help these serious neurological disorders?</p>
<p>Like, hell yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also sensitive to something being someone</p>
<p>that has lots of neuroscience colleagues with some</p>
<p>of this stuff, and I can&rsquo;t talk about particulars,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recalling, but in terms of stuff getting out there</p>
<p>and then kind of a mocking of, oh gosh,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying this is unique, we know this,</p>
<p>or sort of like this belittling of like, oh,</p>
<p>this sounds like it&rsquo;s just a, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a commercialization or like an oversimplification.</p>
<p>I forget what the example was, but something like,</p>
<p>something that came off to some of my neuroscientific</p>
<p>colleagues as an oversimplification,</p>
<p>or at least the way they said it.</p>
<p>Oh, from a Neuralink perspective.</p>
<p>Right, oh, we&rsquo;ve known that for years and like,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very sympathetic to like,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s because of my very limited,</p>
<p>but relatively speaking, the amount of exposure</p>
<p>the psychedelic work has had to my limited experience</p>
<p>of being out there, and then you think about someone</p>
<p>like Mike Musk, who&rsquo;s like really, really out there,</p>
<p>and you just get all these arrows that like,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to be like when you&rsquo;re plowing new ground,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re gonna get, you&rsquo;re gonna get criticized</p>
<p>like every little word that you,</p>
<p>this balance between speaking to like people</p>
<p>to make it meaningful, something scientists</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t very good at, having people understand</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying, and then being belittled</p>
<p>by oversimplifying something in terms of the public message.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m extremely sympathetic, and I&rsquo;m a big fan</p>
<p>of like what that, you know, what Elon Musk does,</p>
<p>like tunnels through the ground, and SpaceX,</p>
<p>and all this, just like, hell yeah,</p>
<p>like this guy has some, he has some great ideas.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something to be said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the communication to the public.</p>
<p>I think his first principles thinking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, because I get this</p>
<p>in the artificial intelligence world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably similar to neuroscience world,</p>
<p>where Elon will say something like,</p>
<p>or I worked at MIT, I worked on autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s sort of, I could sense how much he pisses off</p>
<p>like every roboticist at MIT, and everybody who works</p>
<p>on like the human factor side of safety</p>
<p>of autonomous vehicles, and saying like,</p>
<p>nah, we don&rsquo;t need to consider human beings in the car,</p>
<p>like the car will drive itself, it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>that neural networks is all you need.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s obvious that like we should be able</p>
<p>to systems that should be able to learn constantly.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t really need LIDAR,</p>
<p>they just need cameras, because we humans just use our eyes,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the same as cameras.</p>
<p>So like it doesn&rsquo;t, why would we need anything else?</p>
<p>You just have to make a system that learns faster,</p>
<p>and faster, and faster, and neural networks can do that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s pissing off every single community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pissing off human factors community,</p>
<p>saying you don&rsquo;t need to consider the human driver</p>
<p>in the picture, you can just focus on the robotics problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pissing off every robotics person</p>
<p>for saying LIDAR can be just ignored, it can be camera.</p>
<p>Every robotics person knows that camera is really noisy,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s, and then every AI person who says,</p>
<p>who hears neural networks, and says like,</p>
<p>neural networks can learn everything,</p>
<p>like almost presuming that it&rsquo;s kind of going</p>
<p>to achieve general intelligence.</p>
<p>The problem with all those haters in the three communities</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re looking one year ahead, five years ahead.</p>
<p>The hilarious thing about the, quote unquote,</p>
<p>ridiculous things that Elon Musk is saying,</p>
<p>is they have a pretty good shot at being true in 20 years.</p>
<p>And so like, when you just look at the, you know,</p>
<p>when you look at the progression</p>
<p>of these kinds of predictions,</p>
<p>and sometimes first principles thinking can allow you</p>
<p>to do that, is you see that it&rsquo;s kind of obvious</p>
<p>that things are going to progress this way.</p>
<p>And if you just remove the prejudice you hold</p>
<p>about the particular battles</p>
<p>of the current academic environment,</p>
<p>and just look at the big picture,</p>
<p>the progression of the technology,</p>
<p>you can usually see the world in the same kind of way.</p>
<p>And so in that same way, looking at psychedelics,</p>
<p>you can see like, there is so many exciting possibilities</p>
<p>here if we fully engage in the research.</p>
<p>Same thing with Neuralink.</p>
<p>If we fully engage, so we go from a thousand channels</p>
<p>of communication to the brain,</p>
<p>to billions of channels of communication to the brain,</p>
<p>and we figure out many of the details</p>
<p>of how to do that safely with neurosurgery and so on,</p>
<p>that the world would just change completely</p>
<p>in the same kind of way that Elon is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so ridiculous to hear him talk</p>
<p>about a symbiotic relationship between AI</p>
<p>and the human brain.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, is it though?</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Because I can see in 50 years,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be an obvious,</p>
<p>like everyone will have, like obviously you have,</p>
<p>like why are we typing stuff in the computer?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>People used to type on a keyboard with a mouse?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>And it seems pretty clear, like we&rsquo;re going to be there.</p>
<p>Like, and the only question is like, what&rsquo;s the timeframe?</p>
<p>Is that going to be 20 or is it 50 or a hundred?</p>
<p>Like, how could we not?</p>
<p>And the thing that I guess upsets with Elon and others</p>
<p>is the timeline he tends to do.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people tend to do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I definitely do it, which is like, it&rsquo;ll be done this year</p>
<p>versus like, it&rsquo;ll be done in 10 years.</p>
<p>The timeline is a little bit too rushed,</p>
<p>but from our leadership perspective,</p>
<p>it inspires the engineers to do the best work</p>
<p>of their life to really kind of believe,</p>
<p>because to do the impossible, you have to first believe it,</p>
<p>which is a really important aspect of innovation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the delay discounting aspect</p>
<p>I talked about before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying, oh, this is going to be a thing</p>
<p>20, 50 years from now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what motivates anybody?</p>
<p>And even if you&rsquo;re fudging it</p>
<p>or like wishful thinking a little bit,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s just say airing on one side</p>
<p>of the probability distribution,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s value in saying like, yeah,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a chance we could get this done in a year.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>And if you set a goal for a year and you&rsquo;re not successful,</p>
<p>hey, you might get it done in three years.</p>
<p>Whereas if you had aimed at 20 years,</p>
<p>well, you either would have never done it at all,</p>
<p>or you would have aimed at 20 years</p>
<p>and then it would have taken you 10.</p>
<p>So the other thing I think about this,</p>
<p>like in terms of his work</p>
<p>and I guess we&rsquo;ve seen with psychedelics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a lack of appreciation</p>
<p>for like sort of the variability</p>
<p>you need a natural selection,</p>
<p>sort of extrapolating from biological,</p>
<p>from evolution like,</p>
<p>hey, maybe he&rsquo;s wrong about focusing only on the cameras</p>
<p>and not these other things.</p>
<p>Be empirically driven.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, you need to like when he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>when you need to get the regulation,</p>
<p>is it safe enough to get this thing on the road?</p>
<p>Those are real questions and be empirically driven.</p>
<p>And if he can meet the whatever standard is relevant,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the standard and be driven by that.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t let it affect your ethics.</p>
<p>But if he&rsquo;s on the wrong path,</p>
<p>how wonderful someone&rsquo;s exploring that wrong path.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna figure out it&rsquo;s a wrong path.</p>
<p>And like other people, he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>damn it, he&rsquo;s doing something.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s, and appreciating that variability,</p>
<p>that like it&rsquo;s valuable even if he&rsquo;s not on,</p>
<p>I mean, this is all over the place in science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a good theory.</p>
<p>One standard definition</p>
<p>is that it generates testable hypotheses.</p>
<p>And like the ultimate model</p>
<p>is never gonna be the same as reality.</p>
<p>Some models are gonna work better than others.</p>
<p>Newtonian physics got us a long ways,</p>
<p>even if there was a better model like waiting.</p>
<p>And some models weren&rsquo;t as good as,</p>
<p>were never that successful,</p>
<p>but just even like putting them out there and test it.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t know something is a bad model</p>
<p>until someone puts it out anyway, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, diversity of ideas is essential for progress, yeah.</p>
<p>So we brought up consciousness a few times.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several things I wanna kind of disentangle there.</p>
<p>So one, you&rsquo;ve recently wrote a paper titled</p>
<p>Consciousness, Religion, and Gurus,</p>
<p>Pitfalls of Psychedelic Medicine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one side of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve kind of already mentioned</p>
<p>that these terms can be a little bit misused</p>
<p>or used in a variety of ways</p>
<p>that they can be confusing.</p>
<p>But in a specific way,</p>
<p>as much as we can be specific about these things,</p>
<p>about the actual heart problem of consciousness</p>
<p>or understanding what is consciousness,</p>
<p>this weird thing that it feels like,</p>
<p>it feels like something to experience things.</p>
<p>Have psychedelics given you some kind of insight</p>
<p>on what is consciousness?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned that it feels like psychedelics</p>
<p>allows you to kind of dismantle your sense of self,</p>
<p>like step outside of yourself.</p>
<p>So that feels like somehow playing</p>
<p>with this mechanism of consciousness.</p>
<p>And if it is in fact playing</p>
<p>with the mechanism of consciousness</p>
<p>using just a few chemicals,</p>
<p>it feels like we&rsquo;re very much in the neighborhood</p>
<p>of being able to maybe understand</p>
<p>the actual biological mechanisms</p>
<p>of how consciousness can emerge from the brain.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s a bunch there.</p>
<p>I think my preface is that I certainly have opinions</p>
<p>that I can say, here are my best speculations</p>
<p>as just a person and an armchair philosopher.</p>
<p>And that philosophy is certainly not my training</p>
<p>and my expertise.</p>
<p>So I have thoughts there,</p>
<p>but that I recognize are completely</p>
<p>in the realm of speculation</p>
<p>that are like things that I would love to wrap</p>
<p>empirical science around,</p>
<p>but that there&rsquo;s no data</p>
<p>and getting to the hard problem,</p>
<p>like no conceivable way,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m very open,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m hoping that that problem can be cracked.</p>
<p>And as an armchair philosopher,</p>
<p>I do think that is a problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it can be dismissed as some people argue</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even really a problem.</p>
<p>It strikes me that explaining just the existence</p>
<p>of phenomenal consciousness is a problem.</p>
<p>So anyway, I very much keep that divide in mind</p>
<p>when I talk about these things,</p>
<p>what we can really say about what we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>through science, including by psychedelics</p>
<p>versus like what I can speculate on</p>
<p>in terms of the nature of reality and consciousness.</p>
<p>But in terms of, by and large,</p>
<p>skeptically, I have to say psychedelics</p>
<p>have not really taught us anything</p>
<p>about the nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful that they will.</p>
<p>They have been used around certain,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if features is the right term,</p>
<p>but things that are called consciousness.</p>
<p>So consciousness can refer to not only</p>
<p>just phenomenal consciousness,</p>
<p>which is like the source of the hard problem</p>
<p>and what it is to be like Nagel&rsquo;s description,</p>
<p>but the sense of self,</p>
<p>which can be sort of like the experiential self</p>
<p>moment to moment, or it can be like the narrative self,</p>
<p>the stringing together of stories.</p>
<p>So those are things that I think can be,</p>
<p>and a little bit&rsquo;s been done with psychedelics</p>
<p>regarding that, but I think there&rsquo;s far more potential.</p>
<p>So like one story that unfolded</p>
<p>is that psychedelics acutely having effects</p>
<p>on the default mode network,</p>
<p>a certain pattern of activation</p>
<p>amongst a subset of brain areas</p>
<p>that is associated with self referential processing,</p>
<p>seems to be more active,</p>
<p>more communication between these areas,</p>
<p>like the posterior cingulate cortex</p>
<p>and the medial prefrontal cortex, for example,</p>
<p>being parts of this and others that are tied</p>
<p>with sort of thinking about yourself,</p>
<p>remembering yourself in the past,</p>
<p>projecting yourself into the future.</p>
<p>And so an interesting story emerged</p>
<p>when it was found that when psilocybin is on board</p>
<p>in the person&rsquo;s system,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s less communication amongst these areas.</p>
<p>So with resting state fMRI imaging,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s less synchronization</p>
<p>or presumably communication between these areas.</p>
<p>And so I think it has been overstated</p>
<p>in terms of, ah, we see this is like,</p>
<p>this is the dissolving of the ego.</p>
<p>The story made a whole lot of sense,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s several,</p>
<p>I think that story is really being challenged.</p>
<p>Like one, we see increasing number of drugs</p>
<p>that decouple that network,</p>
<p>including ones like that aren&rsquo;t psychedelic.</p>
<p>So this may just be a property, frankly,</p>
<p>of being like, you know, screwed up, you know,</p>
<p>like, you know, being out of your head,</p>
<p>being like, like, you know.</p>
<p>Anytime you mess with the perception system,</p>
<p>maybe it screws up some,</p>
<p>just our ability to just function in the holistically</p>
<p>like we do in order,</p>
<p>yeah, for the brain to perceive stuff,</p>
<p>to be able to map it to memory,</p>
<p>to connect things together,</p>
<p>the whole recur mechanism</p>
<p>that that could just be messed with.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it could, and I&rsquo;m speculating,</p>
<p>it could be tied to more</p>
<p>if you had to download into the language,</p>
<p>everyday language, like not feeling like yourself.</p>
<p>Like, so whether that be like really drunk</p>
<p>or really hopped up on amphetamine or, you know,</p>
<p>like we found it like decoupling of the default mode network</p>
<p>on salvinorin A, which is a smokable psychedelic,</p>
<p>which is a non classic psychedelic,</p>
<p>but another one where like DMT,</p>
<p>where people are often talking to entities</p>
<p>and that type of thing.</p>
<p>That was a really fun study to run.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, most people say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a classic psychedelic</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t have some of those phenomenal features</p>
<p>that people report from classic psychedelics</p>
<p>and not sort of the clear sort of ego loss type,</p>
<p>at least not in the way that people report it</p>
<p>with classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>So you get it with all these different drugs.</p>
<p>And so, and then you also see just broad,</p>
<p>broad changes in network activity with other networks.</p>
<p>And so I think that story took off a little too soon,</p>
<p>although, so I think, and the story that the DMN,</p>
<p>the default mode network relating to the self,</p>
<p>and I know some neuroscientists, it drives them crazy</p>
<p>if you say that it&rsquo;s the ego and that just like,</p>
<p>but self referential processing, if you go that far,</p>
<p>like that was already known before psychedelics.</p>
<p>Psychedelics didn&rsquo;t really contribute to that.</p>
<p>The idea that this type of brain network activity</p>
<p>was related to a sense of self.</p>
<p>But it is absolutely striking that psychedelics</p>
<p>that people report with pretty high reliability,</p>
<p>these unity experiences that where people subjectively,</p>
<p>like they report losing or again, like the boundaries,</p>
<p>however you wanna say it, like these unity experiences,</p>
<p>I think we can do a lot with that</p>
<p>in terms of figuring out the nature of the sense of self.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the same as the hard problem</p>
<p>or the existence of phenomenal consciousness,</p>
<p>because you can build an AI system,</p>
<p>and you correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>that will pass a Turing test</p>
<p>in terms of demonstrating the qualities</p>
<p>of like a sense of self.</p>
<p>It will talk as if there&rsquo;s a self</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s probably a certain like algorithm</p>
<p>or whatever, like computational,</p>
<p>like scaling up of computations that results in somehow,</p>
<p>and I think this is the argument with humans,</p>
<p>but some have speculated this,</p>
<p>why do we have this illusion of the self that&rsquo;s evolved?</p>
<p>And we might find this with AI that like it works,</p>
<p>having a sense of self, and that&rsquo;s stated incorrectly,</p>
<p>like acting as if there is an agent at play</p>
<p>and behaviorally acting like there is a self,</p>
<p>that might kind of work.</p>
<p>And so you can program a computer or a robot</p>
<p>to basically demonstrate, have an algorithm like that</p>
<p>and demonstrate that type of behavior.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s completely silent</p>
<p>on whether there&rsquo;s an actual experience inside there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling to find the right words</p>
<p>in how I feel about that whole thing,</p>
<p>but because I&rsquo;ve said it poorly before,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve before said that there&rsquo;s no difference</p>
<p>between the appearance and the actual existence</p>
<p>of consciousness or intelligence or any of that.</p>
<p>What I really mean is the more the appearance</p>
<p>starts to look like the thing,</p>
<p>the more there&rsquo;s this area where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, our whole idea of what is real</p>
<p>and what is just an illusion</p>
<p>is not the right way to think about it.</p>
<p>So the whole idea is like, if you create a system</p>
<p>that looks like it&rsquo;s having fun,</p>
<p>the more it&rsquo;s realistically able to portray itself</p>
<p>as having fun, like there&rsquo;s a certain gray area</p>
<p>which the system is having fun.</p>
<p>And same with intelligence, same with consciousness.</p>
<p>And we humans wanna simplify,</p>
<p>like it feels like the way we simplify the existence</p>
<p>and the illusion of something is missing the whole truth</p>
<p>of the nature of reality,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re not yet able to understand.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the 1%, we only understand 1% currently.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have the right physics to talk about things,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the right science to talk about things.</p>
<p>But to me, like the faking it and actually it being true</p>
<p>is the difference is much smaller</p>
<p>than what humans would like to imagine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my intuition, but the philosophers hate that</p>
<p>because, and guess what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s philosophers, what have you actually built?</p>
<p>So like to me is that&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>in philosophy and engineering.</p>
<p>It feels like if we push the creation, the engineering,</p>
<p>like fake it until you make it all the way,</p>
<p>which is like fake consciousness</p>
<p>until you realize, holy crap, this thing is conscious.</p>
<p>Fake intelligence until you realize,</p>
<p>holy crap, this is intelligence.</p>
<p>And from my curiosity with psychedelics</p>
<p>and just neurobiology and neuroscience</p>
<p>is like it feels, I love the armchair.</p>
<p>I love sitting in that armchair</p>
<p>because it feels like at a certain point</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to think about this problem</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s going to be an aha moment.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what the armchair does.</p>
<p>Sometimes science prevents you from really thinking,</p>
<p>wait, like it&rsquo;s really simple.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something really simple.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s some, there could be some dance of chemicals</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re totally unaware of,</p>
<p>not from aspects of like which chemicals to combine</p>
<p>with which biological architectures,</p>
<p>but more like we were thinking of it completely wrong</p>
<p>that just out of the blue,</p>
<p>like maybe the human mind is just like a radio</p>
<p>that tunes into some other medium</p>
<p>where consciousness actually exists.</p>
<p>Like those weird sort of hypothetically,</p>
<p>like maybe we&rsquo;re just thinking about the human mind</p>
<p>totally wrong.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s no such thing as individual intelligence.</p>
<p>Maybe it is all collective intelligence between humans.</p>
<p>Like maybe the intelligence is possessed</p>
<p>in the communication of language between minds.</p>
<p>And then in fact, consciousness is a property</p>
<p>of that language versus a property of the individual minds.</p>
<p>And somehow the neurotransmitters</p>
<p>will be able to connect to that.</p>
<p>So then AI systems can join</p>
<p>that common collective intelligence, that common language,</p>
<p>like just thinking completely outside of the box.</p>
<p>I just said a bunch of crazy things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but thinking outside the box</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something about subtle manipulation</p>
<p>of the chemicals of the brain,</p>
<p>which feels like the best or one of the great chances</p>
<p>of the scientific process leading us</p>
<p>to an actual understanding of the hard problem.</p>
<p>So I am very hopeful that,</p>
<p>and so I mean, I&rsquo;m a radical empiricist,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m very strong with that.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what, you know,</p>
<p>so, you know, science isn&rsquo;t about</p>
<p>ultimately being a materialist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s about being an empiricist in my view.</p>
<p>And so, for example, I&rsquo;m very fascinated</p>
<p>by the so called Psi phenomenon,</p>
<p>you know, like stuff that people just kind of reject</p>
<p>out of hand.</p>
<p>You know, I kind of orient towards that stuff</p>
<p>with an idea of, you know, hey, look,</p>
<p>you know, what we consider,</p>
<p>like anything exists as natural.</p>
<p>And so, but the boundary of what we observe in nature,</p>
<p>like what we recognize as in nature moves,</p>
<p>like what we do today and what we know today</p>
<p>would only be described as magic 500 years ago,</p>
<p>or even a hundred years ago, some of it.</p>
<p>So there will surely be things that,</p>
<p>like you explained these phenomenon</p>
<p>that just sound like completely,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re supernatural now,</p>
<p>where there may be, for some of it,</p>
<p>like some of it might turn out to be a complete bunk</p>
<p>and some of it might turn out to be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just another layer of nature,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re talking about multiple dimensions</p>
<p>that are invoked or something,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even have the language towards.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re saying about the moving together</p>
<p>of the model and the real thing of conscious,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m very sympathetic to that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s that part of like, on the armchair side,</p>
<p>where I want to be clear, I can&rsquo;t say this as a scientist,</p>
<p>but just in terms of speculating,</p>
<p>I find myself attracted to these,</p>
<p>more of the sort of the panpsychism ideas.</p>
<p>And that kind of makes sense to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s what you meant there,</p>
<p>but it seemed like related,</p>
<p>the sense that ultimately if you were completely modeling,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like, if you completely modeling,</p>
<p>unless you dismiss like the idea</p>
<p>that there is a phenomenal consciousness,</p>
<p>which I think is hard,</p>
<p>given that we all, I seem like I have one,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really all I know.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s so compelling, I can&rsquo;t just dismiss that.</p>
<p>Like if you take that as a given,</p>
<p>then the only way for the model and the real thing to merge</p>
<p>is if there is something baked into the nature of reality,</p>
<p>sort of like in the history of like,</p>
<p>there are certain just like fundamental forces</p>
<p>or fundamental, like, and that&rsquo;s been useful for us.</p>
<p>And sometimes we find out</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s pointing towards something else,</p>
<p>or sometimes it&rsquo;s still, seems like it&rsquo;s a fundamental,</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s a placeholder for someone to figure out,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something like, this is just a given.</p>
<p>This is just, and sometimes something like gravity</p>
<p>seems like a very good placeholder,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s something better that comes to replace it.</p>
<p>So, I kind of think about like consciousness</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t, I kind of had this inclination</p>
<p>before I knew there was a term for it,</p>
<p>Rosalian monism, the idea that, which is a form of,</p>
<p>again, I&rsquo;m an armchair philosopher, not a very good one.</p>
<p>Broadly panpsychism, by the way,</p>
<p>is the idea that sort of consciousness permeates all matter</p>
<p>and, or it&rsquo;s a fundamental part of physics</p>
<p>of the universe kind of thing.</p>
<p>So, and there&rsquo;s a lot of different flavors of it</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re alluding to.</p>
<p>And something that struck me as like consistent</p>
<p>with some just, you know, inclinations of mine,</p>
<p>just total speculation is this idea of everything we know</p>
<p>in science and with most of the stuff we think of physics,</p>
<p>you know, really describes, it&rsquo;s all interactions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the thing itself.</p>
<p>Like there is something to, and this sounds very new agey,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>and I have a high bullshit like meter and everything,</p>
<p>but like an isness, I mean, think about like Huxley,</p>
<p>all this Huxley with his mescaline experience</p>
<p>and doors of procession, like there&rsquo;s an isness there</p>
<p>in Alan Watson, like there is a nature of being,</p>
<p>again, very new agey sounding,</p>
<p>but maybe there is something to,</p>
<p>and when we say consciousness,</p>
<p>we think of like this human experience,</p>
<p>but maybe that&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s so processed</p>
<p>and so, that&rsquo;s so far, so derivative of this kind</p>
<p>of basic thing that we wouldn&rsquo;t even recognize</p>
<p>the basic thing, but the basic thing might just be,</p>
<p>this is not about the interaction between particles.</p>
<p>This is what it is like to exist as a particle.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s not even particles.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s like space time itself.</p>
<p>I mean, again, totally in the speculation area.</p>
<p>And something else based on, so it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have this, neither the science</p>
<p>nor the proper language to talk about it.</p>
<p>All we have is kind of a little intuitions</p>
<p>about there might be something in that direction</p>
<p>of the darkness to pursue.</p>
<p>And in that sense, I find panpsychism interesting</p>
<p>in that like, it does feel like there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>fundamental here, that consciousness is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just like, okay, so the flip side,</p>
<p>consciousness could be just a very basic</p>
<p>and trivial symptom, like a little hack of nature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s useful for like survival of an organism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something fundamental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this very basic, boring chemical thing</p>
<p>that somehow has convinced us humans,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re very human centric, we&rsquo;re very self centric,</p>
<p>that this is somehow really important,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually pretty obvious.</p>
<p>But, or it could be something really fundamental</p>
<p>to the nature of the universe.</p>
<p>So both of those are to me pretty compelling.</p>
<p>And I think eventually scientifically testable.</p>
<p>It is so frustrating that it&rsquo;s hard to design</p>
<p>a scientific experiment currently,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s how Nobel Prizes are won,</p>
<p>is nobody did it until they do it.</p>
<p>The reason I lean towards, and again, armchair spec,</p>
<p>if I had to bet like $1,000 on which one of these</p>
<p>ultimately be proved, I would lean towards,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d put my bets on something like panpsychism</p>
<p>rather than the emergence of phenomenal consciousness</p>
<p>through complexity or computational complexity,</p>
<p>because, although certainly if there is</p>
<p>some underlying fundamental consciousness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clearly being processed in this way through computation</p>
<p>in terms of resulting in our experience</p>
<p>and the experience presumably of other animals.</p>
<p>But the reason I would bet on panpsychism is to me,</p>
<p>Occam&rsquo;s razor, in terms of truly the hard problem,</p>
<p>at some point you have an inside looking out.</p>
<p>And even looking refers to vision and it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just an example, but just,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an inside experiencing something.</p>
<p>At some point of complexity, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>you start from this objective universe</p>
<p>and all we know about is interactions between things</p>
<p>and things happen.</p>
<p>And at this certain level of complexity,</p>
<p>magically there&rsquo;s an inside.</p>
<p>That to me doesn&rsquo;t pass Occam&rsquo;s razor as easily</p>
<p>as maybe there is a fundamental property of the universe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s both subjective and objective.</p>
<p>There is both interactions amongst things</p>
<p>and there is the thing itself.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But, yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m of two minds.</p>
<p>I agree with you totally on half my mind.</p>
<p>And the other half is I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>looking at cellular automata a lot,</p>
<p>which is, it sure does seem that we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>anything about complexity.</p>
<p>Like the emergence, just the property.</p>
<p>In fact, that could be a fundamental property of reality</p>
<p>is something within the emergence</p>
<p>from simple things interacting,</p>
<p>somehow miraculous things happen.</p>
<p>And like that, I don&rsquo;t understand that.</p>
<p>That could be fundamental.</p>
<p>That like something about the layers of abstraction,</p>
<p>like layers of reality,</p>
<p>like really small things interacting</p>
<p>and then on another layer emerges actual complicated behavior</p>
<p>even on the underlying thing is super simple.</p>
<p>Like that process, we don&rsquo;t really don&rsquo;t understand either.</p>
<p>And that could be bigger than any of the things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic force behind everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in the universe</p>
<p>is from simple things, complex phenomena can happen.</p>
<p>Phenomena can happen.</p>
<p>And the thing that gives me pause</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m concerned about a threshold there.</p>
<p>Like how is it likely that,</p>
<p>now there may be, and there may be some qualitative shift</p>
<p>that in the realm of like,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even understand complexity yet,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Like, so maybe there is,</p>
<p>but I do think like if it is a result of the complexity,</p>
<p>well, just having helium versus hydrogen</p>
<p>is a form of complexity.</p>
<p>Having the existence of stars versus clouds of gas</p>
<p>is a complexity.</p>
<p>The entire universe has been this increasing complexity.</p>
<p>And so that kind of brings me back to then the other</p>
<p>of like, okay, if there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s about complexity, then we should,</p>
<p>then it exists at a certain level</p>
<p>in these simple systems like a star</p>
<p>or a more complex atom.</p>
<p>Hence the panpsychism, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But we humans, the qualitative shift,</p>
<p>we might have evolved to appreciate certain kinds</p>
<p>of thresholds.</p>
<p>Right. Yeah.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s likely that this idea that,</p>
<p>whether or not there&rsquo;s an inner experience,</p>
<p>which is phenomenal, it&rsquo;s the hard problem,</p>
<p>that acting like an agent, like having an algorithm</p>
<p>that basically like operates as if there is an agent,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s clearly a thing that I think has worked</p>
<p>and that there is a whole lot to figure out there that,</p>
<p>and I think psychedelics will be extremely helpful</p>
<p>in figuring more out about that because they do seem</p>
<p>to a lot of times eliminate that or whatever,</p>
<p>radically shift that sense of self.</p>
<p>Let me ask the craziest question.</p>
<p>Indulge me for a second.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll, this is a joke.</p>
<p>Compared to what we&rsquo;ve been talking about?</p>
<p>Like, okay.</p>
<p>No, all of this is assigned,</p>
<p>all of that, despite the caveats about armchair,</p>
<p>I think is within the reach of science.</p>
<p>Let me ask one that&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>also within the reach of science,</p>
<p>but as Joe likes to say, it&rsquo;s entirely possible, right?</p>
<p>Is it possible that with these DMT trips,</p>
<p>when you meet entities, is it possible</p>
<p>that these entities are extraterrestrial life forms?</p>
<p>Like our understanding of little green men</p>
<p>with aliens that show up is totally off.</p>
<p>I often think about this,</p>
<p>like what would actual extraterrestrial intelligence</p>
<p>look like?</p>
<p>And my sense is it will look like very different</p>
<p>from anything we can even begin to comprehend.</p>
<p>And how would it communicate?</p>
<p>Would it be necessarily spaceships</p>
<p>within your civil travel or?</p>
<p>Could it be communicating through chemicals,</p>
<p>through if there&rsquo;s the panpsychism situation,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s something, not if.</p>
<p>I almost for sure know we don&rsquo;t understand a lot</p>
<p>about the function of our mind in connection</p>
<p>to the fabric of the physics in the universe.</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to think</p>
<p>we have theoretical physics pretty figured out.</p>
<p>I have my doubts because I&rsquo;m pretty sure</p>
<p>it always feels like we have everything figured out</p>
<p>until we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, there&rsquo;s no grand unifying theory yet, right?</p>
<p>But even then, we could be missing out,</p>
<p>like the concept of the universe</p>
<p>just can be completely off.</p>
<p>Like how many other universes are there?</p>
<p>All those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, just the basic nature of information,</p>
<p>the time, time, all of those things.</p>
<p>Yeah, whether that&rsquo;s just like a thing we assign value to</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s fundamental or not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s whole, I could talk to Shankar forever</p>
<p>about whether time is emergent</p>
<p>or fundamental to the reality.</p>
<p>But is it possible that the entities we meet</p>
<p>are actual alien life forms?</p>
<p>Do you ever think about that?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve, to some degree, laid my cards out</p>
<p>by identifying as a radical empiricist, you know?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, so the answer, is it possible?</p>
<p>And I think, you know, ultimately,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a good scientist, you gotta say,</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s at the extremes, it&rsquo;s a like, yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It might get more interesting when you&rsquo;re asked to guess</p>
<p>about the probability of that.</p>
<p>Is that a one in a million, one in a trillion,</p>
<p>one in more than the number of atoms</p>
<p>in the universe probability?</p>
<p>And as an empiricist, it&rsquo;s like, what is a good testable?</p>
<p>Like, how would you know the answer to that question?</p>
<p>Or how would you be able to validate?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Well, can you get some information that&rsquo;s verifiable,</p>
<p>like information about some other planet or some aspect?</p>
<p>And gosh, it would be an interesting range,</p>
<p>but what range of discovery that we can anticipate</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna know within, you know, whatever,</p>
<p>a few years, next five, 10, 20 years,</p>
<p>and seeing if you can get that information now,</p>
<p>and then over time, it might be verified.</p>
<p>You know, the type of thing like, you know, part of Einstein&rsquo;s</p>
<p>work was ultimately verified,</p>
<p>not until decades and decades later,</p>
<p>at least certain aspects through empirical observations.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also possible that the alien beings</p>
<p>have a very different value system</p>
<p>and perception of the world,</p>
<p>where all of this little capitalistic improvements</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all after, like predicting,</p>
<p>the concept of predicting the future too,</p>
<p>is like totally useless to other life forms</p>
<p>that perhaps think in a much different way,</p>
<p>maybe a more transcendent way, I don&rsquo;t know, but.</p>
<p>So they wouldn&rsquo;t even sign the consent form</p>
<p>to be a participant in our experiment?</p>
<p>They would not, they would not.</p>
<p>And they wouldn&rsquo;t even understand</p>
<p>the nature of these experiments.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s purely in the realm</p>
<p>of the consciousness thing that we talked about.</p>
<p>So communicating in a way that is totally different</p>
<p>than the kinds of communication that we think of</p>
<p>as on Earth.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the purpose of communication for us?</p>
<p>For us humans, the purpose of communication</p>
<p>is sharing ideas, it feels like.</p>
<p>Like converging, like it&rsquo;s the Dawkins like memes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re sharing ideas in order to figure out</p>
<p>how to collaborate together, to get food into our systems</p>
<p>and procreate and then like murder everybody</p>
<p>in the neighboring tribe because they&rsquo;ll steal our food.</p>
<p>Like we are all about sharing ideas.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s possible to have another alien life form</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more about sharing experiences.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s less about ideas, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;ll be us in a few years.</p>
<p>How could it not?</p>
<p>Like instead of explaining something laboriously to you,</p>
<p>like having people describe the ineffable</p>
<p>psychedelic experience, like if we could record that</p>
<p>and then get the neural link of 50 years from now,</p>
<p>like, oh, just plug this into your&hellip;</p>
<p>Just transferring the experiences.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, oh, now you feel what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>And like, in one sense, like how could we not go there?</p>
<p>And then you get into the realm,</p>
<p>especially when you throw time into it,</p>
<p>are the aliens us in the future?</p>
<p>Or even like a transcendental, temporal,</p>
<p>like the us beyond time.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know, like you get into this realm</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of possibilities, yeah.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, there&rsquo;s one psychedelic researcher</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s who did high dose DMT research in the 90s</p>
<p>who speculated that,</p>
<p>that there was a lot of alien encounter experiences.</p>
<p>Like maybe these are like entities</p>
<p>from some other dimension or&hellip;</p>
<p>He labeled it as speculation, but you know.</p>
<p>Do you remember the name?</p>
<p>Oh, Rick Strassman.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, the DMT work.</p>
<p>He labeled it as speculation, but you know,</p>
<p>I think that, yeah, I think we&rsquo;d be wise to kind of,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s always that balance</p>
<p>between being empirically grounded and skeptical,</p>
<p>but also not being, and I think in science,</p>
<p>well, often we are too closed,</p>
<p>which relates to like, you&rsquo;re talking about Elon,</p>
<p>like in academia, it&rsquo;s like often like,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re punished for thinking</p>
<p>or even talking about 20 years from now</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just so far removed from your next grant</p>
<p>or for your next paper that it&rsquo;s easy pickings</p>
<p>and you know, that you&rsquo;re not allowed to speculate, so.</p>
<p>I think though, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of,</p>
<p>I think the best way to me at least to practice like science</p>
<p>or to practice good engineering is to like do two things</p>
<p>and just bounce off, like spend most of the time</p>
<p>doing the rigor of the day to day</p>
<p>of what can be accomplished now in the engineering space</p>
<p>or in the science, like what can actually,</p>
<p>what can you construct an experiment around,</p>
<p>do like that, the usual rigor of the scientific process,</p>
<p>but then every once in a while on a regular basis,</p>
<p>to step outside and talk about aliens and consciousness</p>
<p>and we just walk along the line of things</p>
<p>that are outside the reach of science currently.</p>
<p>Free will, the illusion or the perception</p>
<p>or the experience of free will of anything,</p>
<p>just the entirety of it, being able to travel in time</p>
<p>through wormholes, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s really useful to do that,</p>
<p>especially as a scientist, like if that&rsquo;s all you do,</p>
<p>you go into a land where you&rsquo;re not actually able</p>
<p>to think rigorously, there&rsquo;s something at least to me</p>
<p>that if you just hop back and forth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to, I think do exactly the kind of injection</p>
<p>of out of the box thinking</p>
<p>to your regular day to day science</p>
<p>that will ultimately lead to breakthroughs.</p>
<p>But you have to be the good scientist most of the time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s consistent with what I think</p>
<p>the great scientists of history,</p>
<p>like in most of the history, the greats,</p>
<p>the Newtons and Einsteins, I mean, they were,</p>
<p>there was less of, and this change I think</p>
<p>is time marched on, but less of a separation</p>
<p>between those realms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s the inclination alpha,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, as a scientist, and this is science,</p>
<p>this is my work, and then this, it&rsquo;s like my inclination</p>
<p>to say, oh, Lex, don&rsquo;t take me too seriously</p>
<p>because this is my armchair,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not speaking as a scientist,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bending over backwards to say, to divide that self,</p>
<p>and maybe there&rsquo;s been less of, there&rsquo;s been that evolution</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s, and like the greats didn&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>I mean, Newton, and you go back in time,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like that obviously connects to then religion,</p>
<p>especially if that is the predominant world,</p>
<p>where Newton, like how much time did he spend</p>
<p>trying to decode the Bible and whatnot?</p>
<p>Maybe that was a dead end.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, if you really believe in that,</p>
<p>in that particular religion, and you&rsquo;re this mastermind,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to figure things out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like, oh, this is what my job description is</p>
<p>and this is what the grant wants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, I&rsquo;ve got this limited time on the planet,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna figure out as much stuff as possible.</p>
<p>Nothing is off the table</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just putting it all together.</p>
<p>So this is kind of this trajectory</p>
<p>is really related to this, the siloing in science.</p>
<p>Like, again, related to my like, oh, I&rsquo;m not a philosopher,</p>
<p>whether you consider that a science or not,</p>
<p>not empirical science,</p>
<p>but like going to these different disciplines,</p>
<p>like the greats didn&rsquo;t observe the boundaries,</p>
<p>the boundaries didn&rsquo;t exist, they didn&rsquo;t observe them.</p>
<p>So speaking of the finiteness</p>
<p>of our existence in this world,</p>
<p>so on the front of psychedelics and teaching you lessons</p>
<p>as a researcher, as a human being,</p>
<p>what have you learned about death, about mortality,</p>
<p>about the finiteness of our existence?</p>
<p>Are you yourself afraid of death?</p>
<p>And how has your view, do you ponder it?</p>
<p>And has your view of your mortality changed</p>
<p>with the research you&rsquo;ve done?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so I do ponder it and&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>Probably on a daily basis, I ponder it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to pick it apart more and say,</p>
<p>yeah, I am afraid of dying, like the process of dying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid of being dead.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not afraid of,</p>
<p>I think it was Penn Jillette that said,</p>
<p>and he may have gotten it from someone else,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not afraid of the year 1862 before I existed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid of the year 2262 after I&rsquo;m gone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be fine.</p>
<p>But yeah, dying, I&rsquo;d be lying</p>
<p>if I said I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of dying.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s both the process of dying,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s usually not good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice if it was after many, many years</p>
<p>and just sort of, I&rsquo;d rather not die in my sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather kind of be conscious,</p>
<p>but sort of just die, fade out with old age maybe.</p>
<p>But just being in an accident and horrible diseases,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen enough loved ones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, this is not good.</p>
<p>This is enough to be, I&rsquo;d like to say</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m peaceful and sort of balanced enough</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not concerned at all,</p>
<p>but no, like, yeah, I&rsquo;m afraid of dying.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also concerned about, I think about family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really, I&rsquo;m afraid or at least concerned</p>
<p>about like not being there,</p>
<p>like with a three year old, not being there,</p>
<p>not being there for him and my wife</p>
<p>and my mom the rest of her life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned about not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned more about like the harm</p>
<p>that it would cause if I left prematurely.</p>
<p>And then kind of even bigger along the lines</p>
<p>of some of the stuff that forward thinking</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>I think maybe way too much about just like,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll never know the answer.</p>
<p>So even if I lived to 120,</p>
<p>but like, I wanna know as much as I can,</p>
<p>but like, how is this gonna work out like as humans?</p>
<p>Are we, and a big one, I think is are we gonna,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think unfortunately I&rsquo;m gonna learn it</p>
<p>in my lifetime, even if I live to a ripe old age,</p>
<p>but well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is this gonna work out?</p>
<p>Like, are we gonna escape the planet?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the biggies.</p>
<p>Like, are we gonna, like the survival of the speed,</p>
<p>like I think the next, like the time we&rsquo;re in now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like with the nuclear weapons, with pandemics</p>
<p>and with, I mean, we&rsquo;re gonna get to the point</p>
<p>where anyone can build a hydrogen bomb.</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s like, you just like the,</p>
<p>or engineer like the, you know,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s a million times worse than COVID</p>
<p>and then just spread it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re getting to this period of,</p>
<p>and then not to mention climate change, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, although I think that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably gonna be surviving humans</p>
<p>with that regard, you know, but it could be really bad.</p>
<p>But these existential threats, I think the only real</p>
<p>guarantee that we&rsquo;re gonna get another, you name it,</p>
<p>thousand million, whatever years is like diversity,</p>
<p>diversify our portfolio, get off the planet, you know,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t leave this one, hopefully we keep, you know,</p>
<p>but like, and I, you know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>either we&rsquo;re gonna get snuffed out like really quickly</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re gonna like, if we reach that point</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be over the next like 100, 200 years,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re probably gonna survive like until like,</p>
<p>I mean, you know, like our sun, like, and even beyond that,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re probably gonna be talking about millions</p>
<p>and millions of years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, and we&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>in terms of the planet, 4 billion years into this.</p>
<p>And depending on how you count our species, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re, you know, we&rsquo;re millions of years into this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, this is like the point of the relay race</p>
<p>where we can really screw up.</p>
<p>So that would make you feel pretty good</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on your deathbed at 120 years old</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something hopeful about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a colony starting up on Mars and it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Yeah, Titan, like whatever, you know, like, yeah,</p>
<p>like that we have these colonies out there</p>
<p>that would tell me like, yeah, then at least we&rsquo;d be good</p>
<p>until like the, you know, hopefully, probably</p>
<p>until the sun goes red giant, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Rather than, oh, like 20 years from now</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s someone with their finger on the nuclear button</p>
<p>that just, you know, misperceives, you know, the radar,</p>
<p>you know, like the signal they think Russia&rsquo;s attacking,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really not or China.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s probably how a nuclear accident,</p>
<p>war is gonna start rather than, you know,</p>
<p>or the, like I said, these other horrible things.</p>
<p>Does it not make you sad that you won&rsquo;t be there</p>
<p>if we are successful at proliferating</p>
<p>throughout the observable universe</p>
<p>that you won&rsquo;t be there to experience any of it?</p>
<p>Just the ego death, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the death, because you&rsquo;re still gonna die</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still gonna be over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you know, Ernest Becker and those folks</p>
<p>really emphasize the terror of death that if we&rsquo;re honest,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll discover if we search within ourselves,</p>
<p>which is like, this thing is gonna be over.</p>
<p>Most of our existence is based on the illusion</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna go forever.</p>
<p>And when you sort of realize it&rsquo;s actually gonna be over,</p>
<p>like today, like I might murder you</p>
<p>at the end of this conversation.</p>
<p>And it might be over today, or like on going home,</p>
<p>this might be your last day on this earth.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I mean, like pondering that,</p>
<p>I suppose one thing to be me,</p>
<p>I, if I were to push back, it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>is you actually, I think you see comfort in the sadness</p>
<p>of how unfortunate it will be for your family</p>
<p>to not have you, because the really,</p>
<p>even the deeper, yes, but that&rsquo;s the simple fear.</p>
<p>Even the deeper terror is like this thing</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t last forever.</p>
<p>Like I think, I don&rsquo;t know, like it&rsquo;s hard to put</p>
<p>the right words to it, but it feels like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not truly acknowledged by us, by each of us.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think this is the, I mean,</p>
<p>getting back to the psychedelics in terms of the people</p>
<p>and our work with cancer patients who,</p>
<p>we had psilocybin sessions to help them,</p>
<p>and it did substantially help them, the vast majority,</p>
<p>in terms of dealing with these existential issues.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, it&rsquo;s something we,</p>
<p>I could say that I really feel that I&rsquo;ve come along</p>
<p>in that both like being with folks who have died</p>
<p>that are close to me, and then also that work,</p>
<p>I think are the two biggies in sort of,</p>
<p>you know, I think I&rsquo;ve come along in that,</p>
<p>that sort of acceptance of this, like it&rsquo;s not gonna last.</p>
<p>And whether at the personal level</p>
<p>or even at the species level, like at some point,</p>
<p>all the stars are gonna fade out,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be the realm of,</p>
<p>which is gonna be the vast majority,</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s a big crunch,</p>
<p>which apparently doesn&rsquo;t seem likely.</p>
<p>Like most of the universe, there&rsquo;s this blink of an eye</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening right now that life is even possible,</p>
<p>like the era of stars.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re gonna fade out at some point.</p>
<p>Like, you know, and you know,</p>
<p>then we get at this level of consciousness and like, okay,</p>
<p>maybe there is life after death.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s, maybe time&rsquo;s an illusion.</p>
<p>Like that part I&rsquo;m ready for.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m like, you know, like that,</p>
<p>that would be really great.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking, I&rsquo;m not afraid of that at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, even if it&rsquo;s just strange,</p>
<p>like if I could push a button to enter that door,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not gonna, you know, die,</p>
<p>you know, I can kill myself, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if I could take a peek at what that reality is</p>
<p>or choose at the end of my life,</p>
<p>if I could choose of entering into a universe</p>
<p>where there is an afterlife of something completely unknown</p>
<p>versus one where there&rsquo;s none,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d say, well, let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s behind that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a true scientist way of thinking.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a door, you&rsquo;re excited about opening it</p>
<p>and going in.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>When I am attracted to this idea, like, you know,</p>
<p>and I recognize it&rsquo;s easier said than done</p>
<p>to say I&rsquo;m okay with not existing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the real test is like, okay, check me on my deathbed.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, oh, I&rsquo;ll be all right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing and the humility of surrendering.</p>
<p>And I really hope, and I think I&rsquo;d probably be more likely</p>
<p>to be in that realm right now than I would,</p>
<p>or check me when I get a terminal cancer diagnosis,</p>
<p>and I really hope I&rsquo;m more in that realm.</p>
<p>But I know enough about human nature to know that, like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really speak to that</p>
<p>because I haven&rsquo;t been in that situation.</p>
<p>And I think there can be a beauty to that</p>
<p>and the transcendence of like, yeah,</p>
<p>and, you know, it was beautiful,</p>
<p>not just despite all that, but because of that,</p>
<p>because ultimately there&rsquo;s going to be nothing</p>
<p>and because we came from nothing</p>
<p>and we dealt with all this shit,</p>
<p>the fact that there was still beauty and truth</p>
<p>and connection, like, that, you know,</p>
<p>like it just, it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>But I hope I&rsquo;m in that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to say that now.</p>
<p>Like, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a meaning to this thing</p>
<p>we got going on, life, existence on earth to us individuals</p>
<p>from a psychedelics researcher perspective</p>
<p>or from just a human perspective?</p>
<p>Those merged together for me, like, because it&rsquo;s just hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this research for almost 17 years</p>
<p>and like, not just the cancer study,</p>
<p>but so many times people like,</p>
<p>I remember a session in one of our studies,</p>
<p>someone who wasn&rsquo;t getting any treatment for anything,</p>
<p>but one of our healthy normal studies</p>
<p>where he was contemplating the suicide of his son</p>
<p>and just these, I mean,</p>
<p>just like the most intense human experiences</p>
<p>that you can have in the most vulnerable situations.</p>
<p>Sometimes like people like, you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like, you have to have a,</p>
<p>and you just feel lucky to be part of that process</p>
<p>that people trust you to let their guards down like that.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know, the meaning,</p>
<p>I think the meaning of life is to find meaning.</p>
<p>And I think, actually, I think I just described it a minute ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that transcendence of everything.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s the beauty despite the absolute ugliness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, and as a species, and I think more about this,</p>
<p>like, I think about this a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that we are, I mean, we come from filth.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re, you know, we&rsquo;re animals.</p>
<p>We come from, like, we&rsquo;re all descendant</p>
<p>from murderers and rapists.</p>
<p>Like, we, despite that background,</p>
<p>we are capable of the self sacrifice and the connection</p>
<p>and figuring things out, you know, science</p>
<p>and other forms of truth, you know, seeking,</p>
<p>and an artwork, just the beauty of music</p>
<p>and other forms of art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the fact that that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>is the meaning of life.</p>
<p>I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>And ultimately, that feels to be creating</p>
<p>more and richer experiences.</p>
<p>The, from a Russian perspective, both the dark,</p>
<p>you mentioned the cancer diagnosis</p>
<p>or losing a child to suicide or all those dark things</p>
<p>is still rich experiences.</p>
<p>And also the beautiful creations, the art,</p>
<p>the music, the science, that&rsquo;s also rich experience.</p>
<p>So somehow we&rsquo;re figuring out from just like psychedelics</p>
<p>expand our mind to the possibility of experiences.</p>
<p>Somehow we&rsquo;re able to figure out different ways</p>
<p>as a society to expand the realm of experiences.</p>
<p>And from that we gain meaning somehow.</p>
<p>Right. And that&rsquo;s part of like this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going across different levels here,</p>
<p>but like the idea that so called bad trips</p>
<p>or challenging experiences are so common</p>
<p>in psychedelic experiences, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a part of that.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>And most of the important things in life</p>
<p>are really, really tough and scary.</p>
<p>And most of the things like the death of a loved one,</p>
<p>like the greatest learning experiences</p>
<p>and things that make you who you are are the horrors.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, we try to minimize them.</p>
<p>We try to avoid them, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think we all need to get into the mode</p>
<p>of like giving ourselves a break,</p>
<p>both personally and societally.</p>
<p>I mean, I went through like the,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people do these days in my twenties,</p>
<p>like, oh, the humans are just kind of a disease</p>
<p>on the planet.</p>
<p>And then in terms of our country,</p>
<p>in terms of the United States, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, we have all these horrible sins in our past.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I think about that like the,</p>
<p>I think about it like my three year old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, you can construct a story</p>
<p>where this is all just horrible.</p>
<p>You can look at that stuff and say,</p>
<p>this is all just horror.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no logical answer to our rational answer</p>
<p>to say we&rsquo;re not a disease on the planet.</p>
<p>From one lens we are.</p>
<p>And you could just look at humanity as that,</p>
<p>like nothing but this horrible thing.</p>
<p>You can look at, and you name the system,</p>
<p>modern medicine, Western medicine,</p>
<p>the university system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you could dismiss everything.</p>
<p>So, big pharma, like hopefully these vaccines work.</p>
<p>And then like, yeah, I&rsquo;d like to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of glad the big pharma was a part of that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like the United States,</p>
<p>you can like point to the horrors,</p>
<p>like any other country that&rsquo;s been around a long time</p>
<p>that has these legitimate horrors</p>
<p>and kind of dismiss like these beautiful things.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, we have this like modifiable constitutional republic</p>
<p>that just like I still think is the best thing going.</p>
<p>That as a model system of like how humans have to figure out</p>
<p>how to work together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s no better system that I&rsquo;ve come across.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, if we&rsquo;re willing to look for it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a beautiful core to a lot of things we&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>Yeah, this country is a great example of that.</p>
<p>But most of the human experience has a beauty to it,</p>
<p>even the suffering.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, the meaning is choosing to focus on that positivity</p>
<p>and not forget it.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>Speaking of experiences,</p>

<p>Nature loves courage.</p>
<p>You make the commitment and nature will respond</p>
<p>to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles.</p>
<p>Dream the impossible dream</p>
<p>and the world will not grind you under.</p>
<p>It will lift you up.</p>
<p>This is the trick.</p>
<p>This is what all these teachers and philosophers</p>
<p>who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold.</p>
<p>This is what they understood.</p>
<p>This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.</p>
<p>This is how magic is done</p>
<p>by hurling yourself into the abyss</p>
<p>and discovering it&rsquo;s a feather bed.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
