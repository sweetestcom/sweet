    <p>hi my name is Bailey Sarian</p>
<p>and every Monday I sit down</p>
<p>I talk about a true crime story</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been heavy on my</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true crime and you like makeup</p>
<p>I would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here for you</p>
<p>every Monday</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get into it</p>
<p>I thought today we could talk about the candyman</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s story takes place in Deer Park Texas</p>
<p>a man by the name of Ronald o&rsquo;brien</p>
<p>lived with his wife Diane</p>
<p>and their 2 children</p>
<p>a son named Timothy and their daughter named Elizabeth</p>
<p>Ronald worked as an optician at Texas State Optical</p>
<p>in Sharpstown Houston</p>
<p>Ronald also was a Deacon at the Second Baptist Church</p>
<p>where he also sang in the choir</p>
<p>and he was in charge of the local bus program</p>
<p>seems like a great man in the community</p>
<p>but you know what they say</p>
<p>the great ones are the most suspicious</p>
<p>so then Halloween night comes around</p>
<p>October 31st 1974</p>
<p>Ronald decided to take his 2 children trick or treating</p>
<p>in Pasadena Texas</p>
<p>to this different neighborhood</p>
<p>I mean it wasn&rsquo;t too far from where he lived</p>
<p>you know how you go to the more expensive neighborhoods</p>
<p>because they usually give out the good candy</p>
<p>the full Snickers bars</p>
<p>not the minis</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they were doing</p>
<p>so Ronald and his 2 children right</p>
<p>they go trick or treating</p>
<p>they also take their neighbor and his 2 children</p>
<p>little hang out time with the neighbor</p>
<p>so the kids are all excited</p>
<p>and they run up to their next home</p>
<p>so they go running up to the door</p>
<p>and they knock</p>
<p>trick or treat</p>
<p>oh my God but the house looked empty</p>
<p>there was no one inside</p>
<p>the lights were all off</p>
<p>it was kind of dark in this home</p>
<p>so the kids are just waiting though</p>
<p>because you know</p>
<p>sometimes just because the lights are off</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that nobody&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re just waiting</p>
<p>wind blowing little bit of drizzles coming down</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s raining a little bit</p>
<p>they realize that nobody&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>so of course</p>
<p>the kids get all antsy</p>
<p>and they run off</p>
<p>they head to their next home</p>
<p>now Ronald decides to stay behind</p>
<p>so then a few minutes later</p>
<p>Ronald caught up with the group</p>
<p>and showed off 5</p>
<p>21 inch pixie stick</p>
<p>which he said</p>
<p>someone at the house</p>
<p>actually answered</p>
<p>ronald&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you guys should have waited a little longer</p>
<p>cause this guy&rsquo;s giving out 21 inch pixie sticks</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s making it rain pixie sticks</p>
<p>so of course</p>
<p>the kids are all excited</p>
<p>because I mean hey</p>
<p>those are some big ass</p>
<p>pixie sticks cool sugar</p>
<p>at the end of the night</p>
<p>Ronald gave his neighbors children</p>
<p>there was 2 of them</p>
<p>he gave them each a pixie stick</p>
<p>and then he gave one to his son Timothy</p>
<p>and one to Elizabeth</p>
<p>his daughter</p>
<p>so once they were home</p>
<p>someone came to the door</p>
<p>and they were you</p>
<p>know knocking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still a Halloween night</p>
<p>it was some kids</p>
<p>they were trick or treating</p>
<p>and it was a 10 year old boy</p>
<p>who went to the church Ronald worked at</p>
<p>so once he recognizes little boy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like oh</p>
<p>I have some candy to give you</p>
<p>some pixie sticks</p>
<p>I got these from the neighbor</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re left over</p>
<p>I can give them to these kids</p>
<p>so he gives the kid</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s only one kid</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I apologize</p>
<p>he gives the kid a pixie stick</p>
<p>and then sends him on his way</p>
<p>so once they got all settled in</p>
<p>and at home</p>
<p>you know the kids</p>
<p>naturally they want to eat their candy right away</p>
<p>and they ask their dad</p>
<p>Ronald can we eat the candy</p>
<p>please and Ronald</p>
<p>being the great parent that he is</p>
<p>was like sure</p>
<p>you can have a piece of candy</p>
<p>but only one</p>
<p>and then tomorrow</p>
<p>you can go ham and eat 3 pieces</p>
<p>you know but tonight</p>
<p>you can only eat one piece of candy</p>
<p>okay we were looking inside of my makeup bag right now</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d find</p>
<p>I have this cute little eyeshadow palette from Smashbox</p>
<p>ooh I got this cute blush you know</p>
<p>orgasm from NARS</p>
<p>and the mascara from Tarte love it</p>

<p>if I would have tried these products on my own</p>
<p>but luckily Ipsy had my back</p>

<p>ipsy the best kept secret in beauty</p>
<p>so Ronald actually picked out the pixie stick</p>
<p>for Timothy to eat</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what his daughter picked</p>
<p>cause she didn&rsquo;t have a pixie stick</p>
<p>it was just Timothy</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like here eat this pixie stick</p>
<p>which by the way I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why you would pick a pixie stick for your child</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just straight sugar</p>
<p>and your kids gonna be wired and up all night</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a terrible idea</p>
<p>so little old Timothy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s excited</p>
<p>he rips open that pixie stick</p>
<p>he tries to pour it into his mouth</p>
<p>but you know how pixie sticks are</p>
<p>they kind of stick</p>
<p>they get stuck</p>
<p>all the powder</p>
<p>Timothy is trying to pour it into his mouth</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s stuck</p>
<p>so Ronald comes over and helps out Timothy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s kind of like wiggling the packaging</p>
<p>so he could get it into his mouth so finally</p>
<p>they wiggle that candy right out into timothy&rsquo;s mouth</p>
<p>and then Timothy right away</p>
<p>he complained that candy tasted really gross</p>
<p>bitter and kind of just nasty</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>but he still ate it because kids will be kids</p>
<p>and they like candy</p>
<p>so Ronald was like</p>
<p>here have some of my Kool Aid</p>
<p>to wash that bitter taste out of your mouth</p>
<p>so this kid is just having a lot of sugar now</p>
<p>a couple minutes later Coral</p>
<p>Timothy starts complaining that he has a tummy ache</p>
<p>so his stomach&rsquo;s hurting</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s feeling really sick</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like daddy</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel so hot</p>
<p>and then not long after</p>
<p>Timothy runs to the bathroom</p>
<p>and he just starts throwing up all over the place</p>
<p>then Timothy falls to the ground</p>
<p>and he starts convulsing on the ground</p>
<p>the hell&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>so Ronald comes running in</p>
<p>because he hears that Timothy is just throwing up</p>
<p>he hears like a loud noise</p>
<p>because Timothy just like fell on the ground</p>
<p>so Ronald comes there to try and comfort him</p>
<p>Ronald said that Timothy just went limp in his arms</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear who called 911</p>
<p>but 911 was called</p>
<p>paramedics arrive</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna take Timothy to the hospital</p>
<p>but sadly poor little Timothy died</p>
<p>before he reached the hospital</p>
<p>so of course because like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a small town</p>
<p>news got out that poor little Timothy had died</p>
<p>from what they believed was poisoned</p>
<p>Halloween candy</p>
<p>and naturally</p>
<p>all the parents panicked</p>
<p>any of us would</p>
<p>parents took all of their kids</p>
<p>Halloween candy</p>
<p>but all the kids were pissed</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s Halloween</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t even get to eat my candy</p>
<p>uh why did Timothy have to die</p>
<p>and ruin it for all of us</p>
<p>is what they&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>I mean they&rsquo;re children</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very full of themselves</p>
<p>and police were accepting all of the candy</p>
<p>because they wanted to see how much candy out there</p>
<p>was poisoned</p>
<p>and hopefully</p>
<p>kind of put the pieces together</p>
<p>and figure out</p>
<p>was it just Pixy Stix was it</p>
<p>in all of the candy</p>
<p>please give us all of your candy</p>
<p>so the parents just took everything</p>
<p>and dropped it off at the police station</p>
<p>now luckily</p>
<p>all of the candy was taken</p>
<p>and brought to the police officers</p>
<p>and they were able to prevent anybody else from dying</p>
<p>because all the candy was taken quickly</p>
<p>and plus with kids</p>
<p>I mean when you get a bag of candy</p>
<p>a pixie stick isn&rsquo;t gonna be your first choice</p>
<p>you know I mean</p>
<p>thank God the police officers did notice</p>
<p>that whoever was responsible for this was very</p>
<p>just kind of sloppy</p>
<p>they opened up the pixie stick</p>
<p>they put whatever it was inside of it</p>
<p>and then they stapled it closed</p>
<p>so they were looking for any candy</p>
<p>that had like</p>
<p>a staple on it</p>
<p>and it was only the pixie sticks</p>
<p>they found 6 of them</p>
<p>that had this staple on them</p>
<p>so naturally</p>
<p>police go to Ronald</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like okay</p>
<p>show us the house</p>
<p>take us to the neighborhood</p>
<p>take us to the house</p>
<p>that gave you this goddamn pixie stick</p>
<p>but Ronald was stumped</p>
<p>he just couldn&rsquo;t seem to find the house</p>
<p>like and point it out to police officers</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t exactly remember where it was</p>
<p>and he also said that he</p>
<p>never saw the face of the person responsible</p>
<p>he said that a hand just emerged from the doorway</p>
<p>handed him the candy</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t see who it was</p>
<p>Ronald went on to say that the homeowner</p>
<p>did not turn on the lights</p>
<p>but cracked the door</p>
<p>and handed them the 5 pixie sticks</p>
<p>and he claimed that he only saw a man&rsquo;s arm</p>
<p>which he described as harry</p>
<p>really given police the dirty details</p>
<p>you know wow</p>
<p>but he was confident that it was a man</p>
<p>so police are kind of like</p>
<p>okay sure Ron</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re growing a little suspicious</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know where the house is at</p>
<p>come on so a few days go by</p>
<p>and it was just becoming very frustrating for</p>
<p>investigators</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t getting any answers</p>
<p>and they knew</p>
<p>Ronald had the answers</p>
<p>I mean he just need to remember</p>
<p>which house was it</p>
<p>so they could make an arrest</p>
<p>I mean hello</p>
<p>who killed your son</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you remember the house</p>
<p>most of you have probably heard me talk about how much</p>
<p>I love Prose</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s most personalized hair care</p>
<p>and for those that haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I want to tell you about the incredible results</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing Prose products</p>
<p>have my hair feeling more soft</p>
<p>moisturized</p>
<p>plus way shinier</p>
<p>ooh but my favorite part</p>
<p>is that it does not weigh my hair down in any way</p>
<p>I mean I have very fine hair</p>
<p>many products can make it look very flat and greasy</p>
<p>I have been using the pre shampoo scalp mask</p>
<p>and the shampoo from pros</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really enjoying the mask</p>
<p>because it helps to revive my scalp</p>
<p>and like the shampoo makes my hair feel soft</p>
<p>but not heavy</p>
<p>and the eucalyptus smell is amazing I love it</p>
<p>prose knows there is more to you than just your hair</p>
<p>type prose in depth quiz</p>
<p>only took a few minutes</p>
<p>and asked all about the aspects of my hair</p>
<p>but Prose also asked me really unexpected things like</p>
<p>hey what kind of foods do you like to eat in your diet</p>
<p>also are you drinking water</p>
<p>you know and I was like</p>
<p>what that affects my hair</p>
<p>and by analyzing over 85 personal factors</p>
<p>pros can determine a unique blend of ingredients</p>
<p>to treat your exact concerns</p>
<p>they wrote back like girl</p>
<p>drink some water</p>
<p>step one step 2</p>
<p>use this statement</p>
<p>and I was like okay</p>
<p>pros also has a review and refined feature</p>
<p>that lets me tweak formulas</p>
<p>for any reason</p>
<p>so when I tried the review and refined feature</p>
<p>I left my review of the current pros products</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using</p>
<p>and since the current products are still working for me</p>
<p>my products have stayed the same</p>
<p>but I switched up the fragrance to Melanie</p>
<p>a fruity and tropical scent</p>
<p>you know just to try something new</p>
<p>as a carbon neutral certified Bee Corp</p>
<p>prose is an industry leader</p>
<p>in clean and responsible beauty</p>
<p>all of their ingredients are sustainably sourced</p>
<p>ethically gathered and cruelty free</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not 100 positive</p>
<p>Prose is the best hair care</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve had they&rsquo;ll take the products back</p>
<p>no questions asked</p>
<p>prose is the healthy hair regimen</p>
<p>with your name all over it</p>

<p>so then police officers meet up with Ronald again</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like okay</p>
<p>Ronald you need to show us where this house is at</p>
<p>and they were being pretty firm with him</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t show us where this house is at</p>
<p>we think something is kind of fishy around here</p>
<p>so this kind of freaks Ronald out</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>so I just need to figure this out</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t want them to think it&rsquo;s me</p>
<p>and taking Ronald out again seemed to actually work</p>
<p>because Ronald all of a sudden was like oh my God</p>
<p>wait I think I remember</p>
<p>let me take you there</p>
<p>so Ronald and the investigators go to the home</p>
<p>which gave them the candy</p>
<p>he pointed towards the house</p>
<p>and was like it&rsquo;s that one</p>
<p>I remember it was that one</p>
<p>so investigators go up to the home</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re knocking</p>
<p>and the man who lived there wasn&rsquo;t home</p>
<p>so they go and they look up</p>
<p>okay who owns the home</p>
<p>try and find all the information that they can get</p>
<p>so they can make an arrest for this guy</p>
<p>who killed the kid</p>
<p>so they find this man who owns the home</p>
<p>he works at an airport</p>
<p>police go to where his work is at</p>
<p>and they arrest the man in front of his colleagues</p>
<p>in front of everyone</p>
<p>the mystery was over</p>
<p>case closed ta da</p>
<p>thank you for coming to my show</p>
<p>psych so they bring the man in for questioning right</p>
<p>and he had a pretty strong alibi</p>
<p>I mean it was a solid alibi</p>
<p>he said that he was working that night</p>
<p>the only people that were home</p>
<p>was his wife and his daughter</p>
<p>and they had turned out the lights early</p>
<p>because they ran out of candy</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna make kids believe that they had candy</p>
<p>leave us alone</p>
<p>turned out the lights</p>
<p>police fact check</p>
<p>this they see time sheets</p>
<p>they see everything</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t this guy</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t have hairy arms</p>
<p>police weren&rsquo;t believing it</p>
<p>was the wife and daughter</p>
<p>and they had no reason to believe it</p>
<p>was the wife and daughter</p>
<p>because Ronald stood by the fact that it was a man</p>
<p>so police did run an autopsy report</p>
<p>on poor little Timothy</p>
<p>it revealed that Timothy had consumed enough cyanide</p>
<p>to kill 2 people</p>
<p>so police are thinking well shit</p>
<p>this is real fishy</p>
<p>so word got back to investigators</p>
<p>that Ronald was angry at his relatives</p>
<p>he was angry at his relatives</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t stay up</p>
<p>the night of timothy&rsquo;s funeral</p>
<p>which was odd</p>
<p>you see Ronald had written a song</p>
<p>about Jesus and Timothy joining the Lord in heaven</p>
<p>and Ronald he had grown agitated</p>
<p>when his grieving family didn&rsquo;t stay up late</p>
<p>to watch a recording of the performance</p>
<p>being broadcasted on television</p>
<p>this made investigators kind of like mmm</p>
<p>why is he acting all mad</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t seem sad</p>
<p>he just wasn&rsquo;t reacting like you should</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re supposed to be</p>
<p>grieving over the loss of your son</p>
<p>a little bit of time goes on</p>
<p>and Ronald was not giving any clues</p>
<p>or answers to investigators</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna just dig around ourselves and see like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s ronald&rsquo;s deal</p>
<p>who is this Ronald guy</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s find out</p>
<p>so they do some research</p>
<p>and they find some very interesting information</p>
<p>so they find out that little Ronald over here</p>
<p>over the last 10 years</p>
<p>this dude he held over 21 jobs</p>
<p>21 jobs in 10 years</p>
<p>do you understand that so okay</p>
<p>seems like he has a really hard time holding a job</p>
<p>they also found that Ronald was 100 000 in debt</p>
<p>also he was a suspect of theft at his job</p>
<p>at the Texas State Optical Place</p>
<p>his car was about to be repossessed</p>
<p>he had also defaulted on several bank loans</p>
<p>and had the family home foreclosed on</p>
<p>so police were looking at this</p>
<p>thinking well</p>
<p>looks like Ronald was in some real shit</p>
<p>hmm then they look a little bit deeper</p>
<p>and guess what they find</p>
<p>they realize that Ronald</p>
<p>his dumbass</p>
<p>Ronald had recently taken out</p>
<p>life insurance policies on both of his children</p>
<p>now it was only $10,000 per child</p>
<p>in January of that year</p>
<p>but then in September</p>
<p>he opted to $20,000 per child</p>
<p>just one month before Halloween</p>
<p>hmm so what are you gonna do Ronald</p>
<p>kill your children</p>
<p>and get 40 000</p>
<p>get this because this is like</p>
<p>the cherry on top of the cake ice cream</p>
<p>this guy is so stupid</p>
<p>I kid you not</p>
<p>Ronald called his insurers</p>
<p>to ask about the payout at 9 a m</p>
<p>the morning</p>
<p>like the morning following timothy&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t even wait that long</p>
<p>like he his son just died</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>hey yeah so um</p>
<p>how am I gonna get that money</p>
<p>Ronald what are you doing</p>
<p>so investigators are like okay</p>
<p>we actually have a pretty good case</p>
<p>against this Ronald guy right</p>
<p>like all signs are pointing to him</p>
<p>so police then get a warrant</p>
<p>and they search ronald&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>where they find a pair of scissors</p>
<p>oh my God scissors</p>
<p>on these scissors</p>
<p>there was plastic residue attached</p>
<p>which was similar to the one that was</p>
<p>found on the cyanide laced sweets</p>
<p>so of course</p>
<p>Ronald was arrested and taken in for questioning</p>
<p>at this time</p>
<p>Ronald was attending community college</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what he was like</p>
<p>getting a degree in</p>
<p>or anything like that</p>
<p>but he was attending community college</p>
<p>and one of ronald&rsquo;s professors</p>
<p>came forward</p>
<p>and said yeah</p>
<p>does Ronald</p>
<p>would ask the weirdest questions in class</p>
<p>like quote what is more</p>
<p>lethal cyanide</p>
<p>or another type of poison</p>
<p>ronald&rsquo;s Ronald dear</p>
<p>what in the butt are you doing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like he wasn&rsquo;t even trying to hide the fact</p>
<p>that he was doing something</p>
<p>another witness came forward</p>
<p>and this person worked at a chemical company</p>
<p>and they told police</p>
<p>that a man had</p>
<p>come in to buy some cyanide</p>
<p>the man from the store said he couldn&rsquo;t identify Ronald</p>
<p>but he remembered that</p>
<p>this customer was wearing a blue smock</p>
<p>like a doctor</p>
<p>Ronald again</p>
<p>was an optician</p>
<p>and that was the exact uniform he wore to work</p>
<p>this was years before DNA testing</p>
<p>and the contact list</p>
<p>debit cards</p>
<p>so police couldn&rsquo;t exactly</p>
<p>pin the pixie sticks on</p>
<p>ronald&rsquo;s hands</p>
<p>or prove that he bought any cyanide</p>
<p>but these seem like pretty</p>
<p>strong leads right</p>
<p>ronald&rsquo;s maintained his innocence</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>nope wasn&rsquo;t me</p>
<p>it was a person</p>
<p>at that house</p>
<p>and technically</p>
<p>there was no proof</p>
<p>so the press</p>
<p>ended up dubbing ronald&rsquo;s the Candyman</p>
<p>the Candyman</p>
<p>On June 3 1975</p>
<p>the jury took 46 minutes</p>
<p>to find Ronald o&rsquo;brien</p>
<p>guilty of capital murder</p>
<p>and 4 counts of attempted murder</p>
<p>the jury took 71 minutes</p>
<p>to sentence him to death</p>
<p>sorry Ronald</p>
<p>but like you try to kill your kid</p>
<p>for $20,000</p>
<p>I mean come on</p>
<p>get it together</p>
<p>shortly after he was convicted</p>
<p>his wife filed for divorce</p>
<p>there really wasn&rsquo;t much said about her</p>
<p>I think she um</p>
<p>was pissed off</p>
<p>as she should be</p>
<p>Ronald o&rsquo;brien was confined to the Huntsville unit</p>
<p>in Huntsville Texas</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s said that Ronald was shunned and despised</p>
<p>by his fellow</p>
<p>death row inmates</p>
<p>for killing a child</p>
<p>the inmates</p>
<p>reportedly petitioned</p>
<p>to hold an organized demonstration</p>
<p>on ronald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>execution date</p>
<p>to express their hatred of him</p>
<p>then finally</p>
<p>on March 31st 1984</p>
<p>shortly after midnight</p>
<p>Ronald was executed by lethal injection</p>
<p>at the Huntsville unit</p>
<p>in his final statement</p>
<p>Ronald maintained his innocence</p>
<p>stating that he felt the</p>
<p>death penalty was wrong</p>
<p>and then he died</p>
<p>during the execution</p>
<p>a crowd of 300 demonstrators</p>
<p>gathered outside the prison</p>
<p>and they cheered</p>
<p>while some yelled</p>
<p>trick or treat</p>
<p>yeah they yelled that</p>
<p>well Ronald was being executed</p>
<p>to the day Ronald was executed</p>
<p>he maintained his innocence</p>
<p>he said I did not do this</p>
<p>God damn it</p>
<p>but what do you believe</p>
<p>you think Ronald was responsible anyways</p>
<p>let me know</p>
<p>your thoughts</p>
<p>of Ronald down below</p>
<p>do you believe</p>
<p>he should have got the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>well a lot of people say</p>
<p>that it was</p>
<p>a little much like</p>
<p>he shouldn&rsquo;t have gotten the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>luckily though</p>
<p>his daughter did not eat the candy</p>
<p>and the other kids</p>
<p>who got the pixie sticks</p>
<p>did not eat the</p>
<p>candy as well</p>
<p>so Timothy sadly</p>
<p>was the only one</p>
<p>who passed away</p>
<p>from this awful</p>
<p>awful disgusting crime</p>
<p>how do you kill your own kid</p>
<p>for $20,000</p>
<p>like I mean no</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>but other than that</p>
<p>I hope you have a wonderful day today</p>
<p>you make good choices</p>
<p>and make sure to</p>
<p>check your candy</p>
<p>because Daddy</p>
<p>might try to kill you</p>
<p>alrighty until next time</p>
