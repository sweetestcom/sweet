    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to Episode 2 of the History of English podcast.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to look at the oldest known ancestor of English, the</p>
<p>ancient language known as Indo-European, or technically speaking, the Proto-Indo-European</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is the story of the discovery of that language, and the man who is credited for</p>
<p>that discovery, Sir William Jones.</p>
<p>In presenting a history of English, I believe that it&rsquo;s important to begin at this point.</p>
<p>Many histories of English begin with the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain in the 5th</p>
<p>century.</p>
<p>But modern English is a combination and blend of several languages, Anglo-Saxon English,</p>
<p>Norman French, Latin, Greek, Old Norse languages of Scandinavia, and even some Celtic influences.</p>
<p>But all of those languages have at least one thing in common, they all evolved from the</p>
<p>same ancient source, the language of the so-called Indo-Europeans, which was spoken several thousand</p>
<p>years ago.</p>
<p>This is very significant in modern English.</p>
<p>For example, in English, unlike many other languages, we have multiple words for almost</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>Take the word father.</p>
<p>We can use the word father and we can make a lot of other words with it, like fatherland,</p>
<p>father-in-law, stepfather, fatherhood, founding father, and so on.</p>
<p>We can even make it into a verb, as in he fathered three children.</p>
<p>The word father is a Germanic, Anglo-Saxon word, which comes to us from the Old English</p>
<p>word father.</p>
<p>But we also have other words that mean father.</p>
<p>For example, the words paternal, paternity, paternalistic, and patriarch.</p>
<p>All of those words also mean father or relate to some aspect of fatherness.</p>
<p>Those words come to us via French from Latin.</p>
<p>More specifically, the Latin word pater, which meant father in Latin.</p>
<p>And this is an example of why English has such a large vocabulary and how it pulls from</p>
<p>multiple sources in creating words.</p>
<p>In fact, as we&rsquo;ll see in this podcast, that&rsquo;s a recurring theme.</p>
<p>For many basic words in English, we have a Germanic root word and an alternate Latin</p>
<p>word.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing that may surprise you.</p>
<p>The English word father from Old English and the Latin word pater are both derived</p>
<p>from the same original word spoken by a tribe of nomads living on the Eurasian steppes about</p>
<p>5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>That original word was likely very close to the pater used by Latin.</p>
<p>For reasons that we will discuss in the next episode of the podcast, the P sound shifted</p>
<p>to an F sound in the Germanic languages and ultimately became father in modern English.</p>
<p>So all of the words I mentioned earlier, father, fatherland, fatherhood, paternal, paternity,</p>
<p>paternalistic, and patriarch, all of those words are interconnected and come from the</p>
<p>same single root word.</p>
<p>Linguists say that all of these words are cognates.</p>
<p>For another example, consider the English word foot.</p>
<p>This again is a Germanic word from Old English.</p>
<p>From it, we get lots of other words, football, foothill, foothold, footing, footnote, footprint,</p>
<p>footpath, footstep, and footstool, just to name a few.</p>
<p>But we also have another group of words which relate to feet.</p>
<p>Consider these, pedestrian, pedicure, pedal, pedometer.</p>
<p>Even the word pedigree, which comes from the fact that a genealogical family tree resembles</p>
<p>a crane&rsquo;s foot.</p>
<p>Do you notice a common theme?</p>
<p>All of these words begin with ped, which was the Latin word for foot.</p>
<p>Again, the English word foot and the Latin word ped were once the same word in this ancient</p>
<p>common language.</p>
<p>The same shift from the P sound to the F sound, which distinguishes English father from Latin</p>
<p>potter, is also at work here.</p>
<p>In Latin, the word retains its original P sound and becomes ped, while in the Germanic</p>
<p>languages like English, it shifts to an F sound and becomes foot.</p>
<p>Again, we will explore these sound changes in greater detail in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>But the point here is that English did not just borrow words from Latin and other languages.</p>
<p>It often borrowed words that were ultimately just another version of the words that English</p>
<p>already had.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to begin the history of English at the point of this ancient</p>
<p>common language, known as Proto-Indo-European, rather than with the arrival of Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>in Britain.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s important to understand that the history of English begins before the Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>and before we have a language or dialect that we actually call English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to understand that all of the languages which have come together</p>
<p>to create modern English are not completely separate languages, but are in fact part</p>
<p>of a larger interconnected language family.</p>
<p>To put it another way, English, Latin, Greek, and the Celtic languages are ultimately all</p>
<p>cousins within the same language family, and similarities between the languages can be</p>
<p>found throughout all of them.</p>
<p>But the realization that there was an ancient language, which was the ancestor of all of</p>
<p>these European languages, did not occur until the late 1700s.</p>
<p>Before that, the actual history of the languages was a mystery.</p>
<p>The biblical explanation of the different languages was set forth in Genesis in the</p>
<p>story of the Tower of Babel.</p>
<p>Men tried to build a tower to heaven and God destroyed the tower and dispersed the people</p>
<p>and gave them different languages so they could not communicate freely and attempt to</p>
<p>challenge the power and authority of God.</p>
<p>Beyond the biblical explanation, there was an understanding that the so-called Romance</p>
<p>languages like French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian had evolved from the Latin spoken</p>
<p>by the Romans, and it was obvious that there were similarities between those languages</p>
<p>and the Germanic languages of northern and central Europe, as well as the Slavic languages</p>
<p>of eastern Europe.</p>
<p>But those similarities were largely explained through borrowing.</p>
<p>All of those peoples lived in relatively close proximity, so over time they borrowed</p>
<p>words from each other and that was why the languages sometimes appeared to resemble each</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>And certainly that process of borrowing did happen.</p>
<p>But the idea that all of those languages evolved from a common ancestral language didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>come into play until the late 1700s.</p>
<p>And when the discovery was made, it wasn&rsquo;t made in Europe.</p>
<p>It was actually made in India, a continent away.</p>
<p>The story of how this discovery was made involves European imperialism, private armies, and</p>
<p>attacks on tea which led to the loss of Britain&rsquo;s colonies in America and the unintentional</p>
<p>acquisition of a new colony in India.</p>
<p>The story begins with the arrival of European traders in India in the 1600s.</p>
<p>Initially, the Europeans arrived in India not as colonizers but as traders.</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s silks, spices, dyes, and tea were irresistible to Europeans.</p>
<p>And all of the major powers of Europe established private trading companies to trade European</p>
<p>money and goods for those Indian products.</p>
<p>The British East India Company was chartered in 1600 and it soon established trading ports</p>
<p>with the Mughal Empire which ruled India at the time.</p>
<p>One of those British trading ports was Calcutta in the territory of Bengal in northeastern</p>
<p>India.</p>
<p>The British East India Company and its rival companies established by other European powers</p>
<p>made vast amounts of money during this period.</p>
<p>But the Mughal Empire began to fall apart in the 1700s and India fell into a state of</p>
<p>unrest and civil conflict.</p>
<p>Now this was not good for business.</p>
<p>In fact, the unrest was enough to cause the Dutch and Portuguese to leave town altogether.</p>
<p>And that left the French and British and neither wanted to abandon India and thereby leave</p>
<p>the Indian market to the other.</p>
<p>This was the height of the Franco-British rivalry in Europe and both extended their</p>
<p>competition to control the Indian trade.</p>
<p>But in order to stick it out in India, the trading companies were going to have to find</p>
<p>a way to survive the unrest and protect their own interests.</p>
<p>And the best way to do that is to have your own private army.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>By the mid-1700s, the British East India Company was operating with a private army, staffed</p>
<p>largely with native Indians and led by British officers.</p>
<p>The French were doing the same.</p>
<p>And it was probably inevitable that the French and the British companies would come into</p>
<p>direct conflict.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>In the 1750s, the French and the British East India Companies fought for control of parts</p>
<p>of India.</p>
<p>Now this was actually part of a larger conflict between the French and British known as the</p>
<p>Seven Years War, which is considered by many to be the First World War.</p>
<p>The North American theater of that war between the French and British is known in America</p>
<p>as the French and Indian War.</p>
<p>But the Indian here refers to Native Americans.</p>
<p>So it was, in fact, a global war spread over multiple continents.</p>
<p>Now to make a very long story just a little bit shorter, the British ultimately won out.</p>
<p>In Europe, in North America, which opened the Ohio Valley to British settlement, and</p>
<p>in India, which left the British East India Company as the dominant power in the region,</p>
<p>including vast portions of southern India and the entire territory of Bengal.</p>
<p>The company now found itself with vast sections of India under its control.</p>
<p>But it was a company, not a government.</p>
<p>The wars had been expensive, and the prospect of establishing a bureaucracy and actually</p>
<p>governing these areas would prove to be even more expensive.</p>
<p>By the late 1700s, the East India Company was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>And the British government itself wasn&rsquo;t doing a whole lot better.</p>
<p>The government had racked up a massive debt as a result of the Seven Years&rsquo; War.</p>
<p>And this is where the story of English intersects with the story of colonialism in India, and</p>
<p>even intersects with the beginning of the American Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>Because in order to help pay for the British debt incurred during the Seven Years&rsquo; War,</p>
<p>and to help bolster the finances of the East India Company, the British government passed</p>
<p>the Tea Act in May of 1773.</p>
<p>And the Tea Act provided a way to unload 17 million pounds of excess tea sitting in Britain</p>
<p>with no one to buy it.</p>
<p>The Act removed the tariffs which the company had to pay to the British government for tea</p>
<p>imports to the American colonies.</p>
<p>So now the East India Company could undersell the Dutch tea smugglers who were providing</p>
<p>most of the tea to the colonies.</p>
<p>But it also meant the colonists had to pay a three pence per pound duty on the new British</p>
<p>tea coming in.</p>
<p>So even though the tea would be cheaper, it would also require the payment of a tax to</p>
<p>the British government.</p>
<p>Well all of this tea and tax business ended pretty poorly for the East India Company in</p>
<p>North America.</p>
<p>You probably already know about the Boston Tea Party, which ultimately culminated in</p>
<p>an American War for Independence.</p>
<p>And while the result of all of this was the loss of 13 British colonies in North America,</p>
<p>it also left the British with a new colony in India, one which the British government</p>
<p>never really intended to acquire.</p>
<p>And it was the British involvement in India which paved the way for the discovery of the</p>
<p>ancient links between the languages of Europe and India.</p>
<p>In 1773, the same year that the Tea Act was passed by Parliament, additional laws were</p>
<p>enacted which gave the British government more oversight in the East India Company&rsquo;s</p>
<p>involvement in India.</p>
<p>This was the first step in what would eventually lead to the British government formally taking</p>
<p>over governance of India as a colony a few years later.</p>
<p>But for now, the Company was still in charge of the day-to-day government responsibilities</p>
<p>of its Indian territories.</p>
<p>It was into this complicated political-commercial mixture that Warren Hastings arrived as the</p>
<p>first formally appointed Governor General of Bengal.</p>
<p>Hastings had an appreciation of the ancient native Indian culture.</p>
<p>He also realized the limitations that were inherent in a commercial enterprise trying</p>
<p>to govern a vast territory like India.</p>
<p>He believed that the British Company governments should be based on traditional Indian models</p>
<p>and that most of the administrative work should be done by Indians.</p>
<p>As far as the administration of the courts was concerned, British judges were to supervise</p>
<p>the courts, but Hindu law would be applied as a general rule, except in predominantly</p>
<p>Muslim areas where Islamic law would be applied.</p>
<p>The Company government would try to work within the existing culture, rather than impose a</p>
<p>new and foreign culture upon it.</p>
<p>At least this was the idea at first, of course all of this changed over time.</p>
<p>But for the British judges, all of this posed another problem.</p>
<p>How exactly were the British supposed to supervise the courts and apply Hindu law when they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what those laws were?</p>
<p>Most of the Hindu legal traditions were written in ancient Sanskrit.</p>
<p>There were no Western-style legal codes which could be easily consulted for answers.</p>
<p>Sanskrit was the ancient language of northern India and the ultimate ancestor of Hindi and</p>
<p>many other modern Indian languages.</p>
<p>Its position within Indian culture was similar to that of Latin in Europe in the late Middle</p>
<p>Ages.</p>
<p>During that time, Latin was no longer spoken as a primary language in Europe, but it was</p>
<p>still in very active use as the language of the Church, which was the dominant institution</p>
<p>in Europe at the time.</p>
<p>It was also used by academics and scholars, and was still being used as a common language</p>
<p>for communication throughout Europe in ways which are similar to the way English is used</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>In India, Sanskrit held a similar status.</p>
<p>The language was no longer spoken as a first or native language, but many ancient texts</p>
<p>were written in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>So Sanskrit was still utilized as the primary language for interpreting those religious</p>
<p>and legal texts.</p>
<p>Since the British judges were not fluent in the language, they were forced to rely upon</p>
<p>local experts in Sanskrit and Hindu legal traditions.</p>
<p>The experts were called pundits, which is the root of the modern English word pundits.</p>
<p>The pundits were well-versed in Sanskrit, as well as the legal, religious, and philosophical</p>
<p>traditions expressed in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>But there was always a concern among the British judges about the reliability of the translations</p>
<p>offered by the pundits.</p>
<p>In a country in which bribery was a way of life, how would the judges know if the pundit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>translation was accurate, or if it was bought and paid for?</p>
<p>Into this judicial dilemma arrived the key figure of this episode.</p>
<p>His name was William Jones.</p>
<p>Jones was not only a jurist and a scholar, he was also an expert in languages, including</p>
<p>the Persian language, which was related to Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Jones had been born in London in 1746 to a Welsh father.</p>
<p>As a student at Oxford, he had studied a wide variety of languages, including Greek, Latin,</p>
<p>Hebrew, and Arabic, and many others.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s difficult to know how many languages Jones actually mastered.</p>
<p>Some accounts suggest he knew as many as twenty-eight languages.</p>
<p>But studying a language and speaking it fluently are not the same thing.</p>
<p>Regardless, he was very proficient in the study of languages.</p>
<p>While at Oxford, he also became fascinated with Near Eastern and Far Eastern cultures.</p>
<p>The term used during that period to describe those who studied Asian cultures was Orientalist,</p>
<p>and Jones quickly amassed a reputation as one of the leading Orientalists in Britain.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-two, Jones accepted a commission from the King of Denmark to translate</p>
<p>a Persian manuscript into French, which Jones accomplished and published in 1770.</p>
<p>The publication earned Jones an election to the prestigious Royal Society of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The following year, he published A Grammar of the Persian Language, which was the first</p>
<p>English guide to that language.</p>
<p>He published other works during this period, and he became known as a highly respected</p>
<p>academic.</p>
<p>Jones also studied law and became a barrister, and he befriended other influential scholars</p>
<p>and thinkers of the day, one of whom was Benjamin Franklin, who resided in London for many years</p>
<p>before the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>Speaking of that war, which I&rsquo;ve mentioned a couple of times, Jones wrote a series of</p>
<p>pamphlets after the outbreak of the war, which were sympathetic to the colonists&rsquo; cause.</p>
<p>And when Benjamin Franklin traveled to Paris to obtain French support for the war, Jones</p>
<p>traveled from Britain to Paris to meet with Franklin to discuss a possible resolution</p>
<p>of the conflict.</p>
<p>Ultimately, nothing came of the meeting, and by this point, Jones&rsquo; attention was more</p>
<p>focused on India than the American colonies.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in Calcutta had a vacancy, and Jones was more than qualified given his</p>
<p>interest in Asia and his vast knowledge of languages, including Persian.</p>
<p>Remember that the Governor General of Bengal, Warren Hastings, wanted British judges and</p>
<p>other administrative personnel who would take an interest in Indian language and culture,</p>
<p>and Jones seemed perfectly suited for the job.</p>
<p>In reality, it took some time for Jones to secure the appointment from the British government,</p>
<p>probably in part due to his open sympathies for the colonial rebellion in America.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, Jones ultimately received the appointment to the court on March 4, 1783.</p>
<p>He was also knighted a couple of weeks later and thereafter acquired the title of Sir.</p>
<p>On board the ship that took him to India in that same year, 1783, Jones envisioned the</p>
<p>creation of an Asiatic society to investigate and promote Indian culture and society.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in India, he met other European linguists and Orientalists, who had also been</p>
<p>recruited and encouraged to come to India by Warren Hastings.</p>
<p>Together with these other similar-minded Europeans, Jones founded the Asiatic society the following</p>
<p>year, 1784.</p>
<p>Jones initially served as vice-president of the society under Warren Hastings, but Hastings</p>
<p>soon resigned and Jones became the president of the society.</p>
<p>He would remain the president until his death.</p>
<p>Now part of Jones&rsquo;s mission in India, which he inherited from Warren Hastings, was to</p>
<p>translate the ancient Hindu legal codes from Sanskrit to English.</p>
<p>This would eliminate the need for British judges to rely upon the pundits.</p>
<p>But Jones didn&rsquo;t actually speak or know Sanskrit.</p>
<p>So soon after arriving in Bengal, he embarked on the study of the language so he could translate</p>
<p>traditional Hindu laws and customs.</p>
<p>What he quickly discovered is that Sanskrit, this ancient Indian language, shared many</p>
<p>similarities with Greek and Latin.</p>
<p>And these similarities were much the same as those found in other European languages,</p>
<p>as well as Persian.</p>
<p>But here is the key.</p>
<p>Similarities among European languages could be explained as being the result of long-term</p>
<p>borrowing between neighboring peoples.</p>
<p>I mean, the Latin-speaking Romans interacted with the Germanic tribes east of the Rhine</p>
<p>for centuries before the Roman Empire collapsed and the Germanic tribes poured into the Roman</p>
<p>territory.</p>
<p>So linguistic borrowing was an accepted fact within the various European languages.</p>
<p>But that couldn&rsquo;t explain the similarities with Sanskrit.</p>
<p>How could the Germanic speakers from the icy climes of Scandinavia borrow such a large</p>
<p>number of words from the ancient residents of India?</p>
<p>I mean, there had to be another explanation.</p>
<p>In 1786, Jones gave a lecture to the newly formed Asiatic Society, which he had helped</p>
<p>to establish.</p>
<p>In the lecture, he highlighted the close similarities between three apparently dead languages, ancient</p>
<p>Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit.</p>
<p>He announced that Sanskrit derived from the same source as Greek and Latin.</p>
<p>He also believed that the three were related to Gothic, a Germanic language spoken in Europe</p>
<p>at a time before the Anglo-Saxons had found their way to Britain.</p>
<p>He also concluded that Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek were all related to Persian as well.</p>
<p>The following quote from Jones&rsquo;s lecture is often cited as the first formal statement</p>
<p>that there was an ancient Indo-European language.</p>
<p>Quote,</p>
<p>The Sanskrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure, more perfect</p>
<p>than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either.</p>
<p>Yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity both in the roots of the verbs and in the</p>
<p>forms of grammar than could possibly have been produced by accident.</p>
<p>So strong, indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three without believing them</p>
<p>to have sprung from some common source, which perhaps no longer exists.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>By the way, he uses the word philologer, which is a fancy term for someone who studies the</p>
<p>history of languages and the relationships between them.</p>
<p>So basically what we&rsquo;re doing here.</p>
<p>Now Jones also asserted that Persian, Celtic, and German probably belonged to the same family,</p>
<p>family of languages as Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit.</p>
<p>And years of subsequent research has confirmed that he was correct in all of those assertions.</p>
<p>Now to be completely fair, I should note at this point that there were others who were</p>
<p>reaching the same conclusions as William Jones around the same time.</p>
<p>In fact, about 20 years earlier, a French Jesuit named Gaston Laurent Cordoux had identified</p>
<p>similarities between Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, German, and Russian.</p>
<p>For example, brotar in Sanskrit and brother in English.</p>
<p>But his work was not as fully realized as Jones&rsquo;s work, and he didn&rsquo;t have the same</p>
<p>profile as Jones.</p>
<p>So Cordoux&rsquo;s work went largely unnoticed at the time.</p>
<p>Sometimes the person who gets the credit for a discovery is the person who brings it to</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s attention, not necessarily the first person to actually discover it.</p>
<p>I mean, Christopher Columbus still gets most of the credit for being the first European</p>
<p>to discover America, even though he arrived almost 500 years after the Viking Leif Erikson.</p>
<p>But it was Columbus&rsquo;s discovery that sparked an age of exploration in the New World.</p>
<p>So he gets a lot of cities named after him, and poor Leif&rsquo;s discovery gets relegated</p>
<p>to a footnote.</p>
<p>So it was with William Jones as well.</p>
<p>Jones&rsquo;s discovery sparked a dramatic increase in the study of ancient languages throughout</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>Connections between ancient Sanskrit and European languages may have been noticed before Jones,</p>
<p>but it was only after Jones that people began to take the connections seriously and began</p>
<p>to study it in detail.</p>
<p>In fact, the entire discipline of linguistics was developed in the 1800s, in large part</p>
<p>to determine which languages belong to the Indo-European family and which do not.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at that research in more detail in the next episode.</p>
<p>So in case you&rsquo;re curious, what type of similarities was Jones seeing as he compared</p>
<p>these various languages?</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>You will recall that earlier I mentioned that English has the word father and Latin has</p>
<p>the word pater, and both words came from the same original source word.</p>
<p>The Greek version of the word is very similar to Latin and is also pronounced pater.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit version of the word is pitar, so pitar, pater, pater, and father.</p>
<p>You can start to see how linguists realized that the p sound shifted to an f sound in</p>
<p>the Germanic languages, but let&rsquo;s hold off on that until a future episode.</p>
<p>In addition to having a very similar word for father in all of these languages, they</p>
<p>also shared a compound word for God, which also used the word father.</p>
<p>The term was literally sky-father.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit it was dhyaspitar, in Greek it was zupater, and in Latin it was iupater.</p>
<p>And that Greek version of the word, zupater, later became simply zeus after the pater part</p>
<p>was dropped.</p>
<p>And the Latin version of the word, iupater, later became jupiter after another sound shift</p>
<p>changed the y sound to a j sound.</p>
<p>By the way, this also sometimes happens in English.</p>
<p>For example, when we say, did you really fast, we sometimes convert the y sound to a j sound</p>
<p>so it becomes did you as in did you go to the store.</p>
<p>So the later Romans and early French made this same sound change and iupater became</p>
<p>jupiter.</p>
<p>So all of that means that jupiter and zeus were both connected.</p>
<p>Both words came from the same original root word in the original Indo-European language,</p>
<p>which meant sky-father.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another aspect of this same original Indo-European word which is of interest to</p>
<p>English speakers.</p>
<p>The early Germanic tribes, whose languages would evolve into the Germanic languages we</p>
<p>have today, including English, also had a god whose name came from the same root word.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll see in an upcoming episode, just as the p sound shifted to an f sound in a</p>
<p>lot of Germanic words, the d sound often shifted to a t sound.</p>
<p>We can see that change today in a word like duo, which comes from Latin and Greek, and</p>
<p>the English word to.</p>
<p>Duo has the original d sound and to has the later Germanic t sound.</p>
<p>Both came from the same original Indo-European root word.</p>
<p>We also see it in the Latin word decum, meaning ten, as in the word decade, and the English</p>
<p>word ten with the t sound.</p>
<p>So we often see the t sound in English where we have a d sound in Latin or Greek.</p>
<p>Well that same sound change within the early Germanic languages affected the name of the</p>
<p>original Indo-European sky father, Diu.</p>
<p>The Old Norse language had a god named Tir, and the same god came into Old English as</p>
<p>Tiu.</p>
<p>This god&rsquo;s name derives from the same root as Zeus in Greek and Jupiter in Latin.</p>
<p>And the reason why the Germanic god Tiu might be of interest to you is because one of our</p>
<p>seven days of the week is named after him.</p>
<p>Tiu&rsquo;s day became Tuesday.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go back to Sir William Jones for a minute.</p>
<p>He had announced an original source language, but he pretty much left it at that.</p>
<p>He identified the languages which he thought were part of this larger family of languages,</p>
<p>but it would be left to others to sort out how the languages fit together and which ones</p>
<p>evolved from the others.</p>
<p>In other words, further research would provide us with a family tree of languages which we</p>
<p>still use today.</p>
<p>So that just left the name.</p>
<p>So far, I have referred to the language as the Indo-European language, technically the</p>
<p>Proto-Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And just to be clear in that regard, Indo-European is sort of the family name or surname of the</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>Proto-Indo-European is the technical name for the original language.</p>
<p>If you imagine a family tree which begins with an ancestor named John Smith, all of</p>
<p>the members of the family might be called Smith, but the original ancestor was John</p>
<p>Smith.</p>
<p>Well, the same thing applies for the Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>All of the languages within the family are called Indo-European languages, but the full</p>
<p>name of the original source language is Proto-Indo-European, meaning the first Indo-European language.</p>
<p>The basis of the name Indo-European should be self-explanatory at this point.</p>
<p>The languages spoken in the family are located throughout Europe and all the way into India,</p>
<p>but the term Indo-European was introduced later.</p>
<p>Jones developed his own term for the language.</p>
<p>He noticed within Sanskrit and Persian literature that there were persons who spoke those languages</p>
<p>and called themselves Aryans.</p>
<p>The term Aryan meant noble in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>So, since these were the earliest documented speakers of this family of languages, he called</p>
<p>the original speakers the Aryans, and the language became known as the Aryan language.</p>
<p>And I bring this to your attention because the term is still used in some of the older</p>
<p>literature, and I think you can probably see why the term Indo-European is preferred today</p>
<p>instead of the term Aryan.</p>
<p>At the time Jones coined the term, it was not meant to refer to blonde-haired, blue-eyed</p>
<p>northern Europeans.</p>
<p>In fact, it was presumed that these Aryans, whoever they were, lived in Asia in the vicinity</p>
<p>of ancient Persia, which is modern-day Iran.</p>
<p>In fact, the name Iran comes from the Persian word meaning home of the Aryans.</p>
<p>It was much later that the term came to be used in Europe by Nazis and other racists</p>
<p>to refer to a supposedly ideal race of Europeans.</p>
<p>But for now, it was a more or less innocent term used to describe a specific ancient linguistic</p>
<p>group of Central Asia.</p>
<p>During the 20th century, when the term came to be used as a racist term, it was largely</p>
<p>discarded by linguists, and the term Indo-European became the standard term which is still used</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to conclude this episode on that note.</p>
<p>In this episode, we looked at how the oldest known ancestor of English, the ancient Indo-European</p>
<p>language, was discovered.</p>
<p>We also looked at how connections were made between a large number of the languages of</p>
<p>Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>In the next episode, we&rsquo;re going to look at the family tree of Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>And then we will also look at how a famous fairy-tale collector, one of the famous Brothers</p>
<p>Grimm, opened the door to our knowledge and understanding of the Germanic languages, and</p>
<p>how his work helps us to determine how English fits into that family tree of languages.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
