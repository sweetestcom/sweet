    <p>Hi friends I&rsquo;m gonna start this episode off real calm and real sweet because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>basically gonna tell you why you aren&rsquo;t achieving shit and I&rsquo;m gonna attack you</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna give you a lot of honest truths that I needed to hear a long time</p>
<p>ago and then I&rsquo;m gonna tell you how to fix it and how to actually achieve</p>
<p>things so all the little lessons I&rsquo;ve learned about achieving things and</p>
<p>meeting certain desires and goals here we are I&rsquo;m gonna give it to you straight</p>
<p>so put on your big girl panties you might shit them but I&rsquo;m about to throw a</p>
<p>lot of new perspectives at you a lot of truths and then I&rsquo;m gonna tell you a</p>
<p>couple of ways it&rsquo;s like my three assessments that I use to kind of check</p>
<p>myself and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you the three ways you can assess if you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>achieve something and why you&rsquo;re not achieving it if you aren&rsquo;t yet so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jump into it and first we&rsquo;re gonna start talking about desires so if you have a</p>
<p>desire for something you want something you want to achieve something you want</p>
<p>to have something there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it desire is not bad and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of reasons a lot of people think having a desire is bad you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>rid of it you can&rsquo;t not want something that you want so go ahead and accept</p>
<p>that and then what are we gonna do about it so if I can&rsquo;t not want this</p>
<p>thing how can I manifest it how can I actualize it and we&rsquo;re gonna break down</p>
<p>the whole manifestation bullshit a little bit in this episode but the main</p>
<p>thing I want to get across about desires is you might be a little discouraged</p>
<p>when you think of something that you want so like a goal for my life has</p>
<p>always been to make a million dollars a month where the fuck am I supposed to</p>
<p>start with that I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m gonna do it I have no clue but the thing</p>
<p>you need to get about desires is you can&rsquo;t have a desire unless there is a</p>
<p>way to get to it like it&rsquo;s not some twisted fucked up game of the universe</p>
<p>or God is playing with you whoever you want to believe in like believe who you</p>
<p>need to believe in and use that but you&rsquo;re not being punished you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>like being sent a desire and that you just can&rsquo;t have it like there&rsquo;s no joy</p>
<p>that comes out of the universe or God from like you wanting something and then</p>
<p>them holding it from you no one&rsquo;s holding shit from you and a lot of</p>
<p>people get discouraged and I used to get very discouraged when I would have a</p>
<p>desire for something like oh a million dollars a month that seems ungodly to me</p>
<p>but I could not have this desire unless there was a possibility for it so for me</p>
<p>feeling discouraged is because I don&rsquo;t see a way to get there yet but there</p>
<p>absolutely is a way to get there there&rsquo;s so many ways to get there so go ahead</p>
<p>and knock that fucking discouragement right out of your head if you think that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something too big for you you&rsquo;re just not aware of the way to get there</p>
<p>yet or a way to get there you have to commit to finding that you have to</p>
<p>commit to finding the way to get to what you want and as soon as you do that</p>
<p>shit&rsquo;s gonna start unfolding but my biggest point here comes grab your</p>
<p>britches you can&rsquo;t just ask for shit and think it&rsquo;s gonna happen like this whole</p>
<p>spirituality and all this talk about manifestation use your thoughts and think</p>
<p>things into reality how the fuck good has that worked out for you it probably</p>
<p>fucking hasn&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re frustrated and landed on this video</p>
<p>thinking thoughts and thinking that&rsquo;s gonna somehow manifest shit in your</p>
<p>physical reality is bullshit it&rsquo;s not all of it like that&rsquo;s such a small</p>
<p>fucking like 1% of what it takes to manifest something it doesn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>fucking matter it literally doesn&rsquo;t matter because there&rsquo;s not much energy</p>
<p>in that the energy is in action and what you&rsquo;re doing to actualize it before I</p>
<p>get ahead of myself if you have a desire for something do not sit back and ask</p>
<p>God for it or the universe and like declare it and get a crystal and get a</p>
<p>candle and be like oh my god I want this thing okay do it you know how fucking</p>
<p>delusional that is I used to try it I used to fucking try it all the time and</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what everybody preaches all these manifestation motherfuckers</p>
<p>are always preaching this bullshit and I got to a point where I was asking for so</p>
<p>much and none of it was happening I was like fucking what the fuck the universe</p>
<p>would love me like I know I&rsquo;m gay but God what the fuck but do not sit back</p>
<p>and just ask for shit to happen to you that is throwing all of your power away</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re throwing every potential for your life out of your own hands oh I</p>
<p>said I wanted it and now I&rsquo;m gonna think about it and I&rsquo;m gonna visualize it and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the journal and I&rsquo;m gonna buy crystals and it&rsquo;s just gonna poof</p>
<p>happen babe it&rsquo;s not I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry to say it but that&rsquo;s not how life works</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not how shit goes and to put all of your power into some being that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know if it exists or not like the universe or God like who the</p>
<p>fuck knows if it&rsquo;s even real there is a possibility we&rsquo;re all full of shit I</p>
<p>prefer to believe in it because goddamn but you&rsquo;re not here in this life to just</p>
<p>passively live it and to passively manifest things you&rsquo;re here to actively</p>
<p>manifest things and create things so we got a BFF are for a second be fucking</p>
<p>for real you&rsquo;re in this life with a functioning body you have a mind that</p>
<p>thinks you have a body that works you think that you were equipped with</p>
<p>something like this to just go into a life and just like ah passively just sit</p>
<p>back and just ask and pray for things you weren&rsquo;t you were sent in with energy</p>
<p>inside of you and that is creative energy you are allowed to put that into</p>
<p>whatever the fuck you want to put into you can really manifest anything you</p>
<p>want but you have to put your ass behind it you have energy to create so use it</p>
<p>like your little depression your little sadness okay girl cool but are you gonna</p>
<p>do what it takes to do shit like I get there&rsquo;s so many things that come into it</p>
<p>and come into play and are factors of it but if you have a functioning body you</p>
<p>have no fucking excuse and before somebody tries to come at me be like oh</p>
<p>I am handicapped I don&rsquo;t have an arm I took care of a patient who was</p>
<p>quadriplegic paralyzed from the neck fucking down could not move his body and</p>
<p>he was a very very successful software engineer when he was born he had full</p>
<p>function like and control over his body he could move he could walk and then he</p>
<p>had an accident happen a situation where he was shot at a gas station in the back</p>
<p>of the neck and it paralyzed him for the rest of his life but that creative</p>
<p>energy does not die you can block it from coming out of you but it does not</p>
<p>go away because this patient of mine went through a lot of shit but he chose</p>
<p>to continue forward and when there&rsquo;s a will there&rsquo;s a goddamn way he literally</p>
<p>would sit at his computer with like you know those little like iPad things where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a pen and you can like touch on it he would have a long stick and a</p>
<p>mouthpiece and it was attached to it so that he could use his computer it was a</p>
<p>touchscreen computer and he would bite the piece I would have to put it into</p>
<p>his mouth and he would like type things on the computer screen he would book</p>
<p>trips for nurses and take them on cruises he would go on trips himself he</p>
<p>would have clients he would fucking coach people he could use his mouth and</p>
<p>talk and he could use his mouth to like poke the letters he needed and like the</p>
<p>things he needed on the computer bitch if that ain&rsquo;t fucking inspiration for</p>
<p>you to get off your fucking ass and do something I don&rsquo;t know what is I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s gonna have to knock you upside your fucking head for you to get</p>
<p>up okay and I&rsquo;m speaking like at myself my old self when I speak so intensely</p>
<p>like this I&rsquo;m not yelling at you you need to hear it but I&rsquo;m yelling at my</p>
<p>old self because I convinced myself I was so just like unable to do shit and</p>
<p>then I had that experience where I took care of him and I was like I have zero</p>
<p>fucking excuse my body works I have ten legs up on this I&rsquo;m so much out of an</p>
<p>advantage who cares if you&rsquo;re fucking depressed you can still get your ass up</p>
<p>and I was diagnosed as clinically depressed twice chronically chronically</p>
<p>depressed bitch I know what it&rsquo;s like I know exactly what it&rsquo;s like and before</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to attack me literally just listen to the people who have</p>
<p>gotten out of the place you feel so stuck in okay my whole podcast is me</p>
<p>sharing everything that&rsquo;s got me out of the worst shit of my life and got me</p>
<p>through it and what I&rsquo;ve learned so just take your little fucking beliefs</p>
<p>and put them aside for a second and try on the shit that I&rsquo;m telling you and</p>
<p>just watch what changes if you want to fight me and hold on to your beliefs</p>
<p>that hurt you have it you can lead a donkey to water I know the analogy is</p>
<p>like you can lead a horse to water but you being a goddamn donkey you can lead</p>
<p>a donkey to water but you can&rsquo;t make a fucking drink I can drown you in it but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still not gonna drink it so if you want to have your beliefs that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work for you and that hurt you have them I&rsquo;m gonna share what the fuck has worked</p>
<p>for me but my whole point with this is you are able to create and manifest so</p>
<p>much more than you even give yourself credit for this man with a body that</p>
<p>does not work is doing more than you he&rsquo;s figured it the fuck out he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>committed to it he&rsquo;s driven he&rsquo;s doing what it takes like girl oh my god that</p>
<p>is the most inspiring experience I&rsquo;ve ever had and I had that situation line</p>
<p>up with me when I needed it most they woke me the fuck up but moving on to my</p>
<p>next point stop being such an entitled little shit just cuz you ask for</p>
<p>something doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re gonna get it you have the full capacity and the</p>
<p>full ability to create something why the fuck would God just give it to you use</p>
<p>your own ass to do it he&rsquo;s got enough on his plate he got enough people asking</p>
<p>for shit literally put your own ass behind what you want you need to</p>
<p>recognize the power you have recognize the energy you have to put into things</p>
<p>and make it manifest and literally it&rsquo;s there like it&rsquo;s in all of us we all have</p>
<p>it you think I just had all this shit happen to me that&rsquo;s happened to me no</p>
<p>girl I had to create it every single person you see has had to put energy</p>
<p>into everything that they have and do it might look like oh it was just handed to</p>
<p>them a lot of people paint that image a lot of people are fucking suffering and</p>
<p>you have no idea but I&rsquo;m gonna take it down a notch on the aggressive side</p>
<p>because now I have like some really serious things I want you to get and if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m screaming you&rsquo;re gonna be a little bit on the defense and not as receptive</p>
<p>but instead of trying to passively just like will things into existence and ask</p>
<p>for them and throw all your power away I want you a lot of people do that</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t see that they&rsquo;re capable or don&rsquo;t feel capable like</p>
<p>people turn to a higher power when they have absolutely nothing and they feel</p>
<p>incapable and they feel hopeless so I get it but what I want you to start</p>
<p>doing is flipping your focus from how you can&rsquo;t do something or how you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>achieve something and manifest something and start seeing how you can see what</p>
<p>advantages you do have see the ability you do have see what you can put into</p>
<p>actualizing whatever it is that you want and I have a lot of personal examples</p>
<p>and a lot of shit I&rsquo;m gonna run you through but this is just like my first</p>
<p>little hot take so let&rsquo;s visit the idea of having a desire like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that you want whether it&rsquo;s money fame to look a certain way to like</p>
<p>be muscular or be skinny like whatever your desire is for anything a boyfriend</p>
<p>a girlfriend literally anything you want in this life I want you to start</p>
<p>focusing on the actions you can take to having that happen and to creating that</p>
<p>what the fuck actions can you take that will get you any step closer to what it</p>
<p>is you want so every time you have a desire from now on sit down and make an</p>
<p>action plan what are all of the things that I can do and literally break it</p>
<p>down into daily things make it very real make it something that you work toward</p>
<p>if you want it bad enough consistently and daily like even if you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the exact actions to take you don&rsquo;t need to there are certain things that you</p>
<p>know to do that will propel you forward and as you keep going forward you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna learn more shit so where you are vibrationally when you&rsquo;re standing at</p>
<p>the beginning you start taking a few steps even if they&rsquo;re not like the right</p>
<p>steps or the best steps you&rsquo;re already moving forward you can&rsquo;t go back so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already moving forward your perspective from this new standpoint is</p>
<p>gonna be completely different you are a match to new shit that you were not a</p>
<p>match to back here so as you take any step forward you&rsquo;re a match to new</p>
<p>ideas new experiences and new awareness that will get you closer to what you</p>
<p>want but you have to start walking toward it you have to start doing</p>
<p>anything that you can to start getting in that direction and now we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>get into my three assessments so the three ways that I assess my actions to</p>
<p>check myself and get myself in line to make sure I&rsquo;m gonna actualize what it is</p>
<p>that I want assessment number one are you just saying that you want something</p>
<p>or are you actually doing something to get it like look at your life whatever</p>
<p>it is so my example I used to always say I wanted money I wanted financial</p>
<p>freedom I wanted abundance I wanted to just be able to go buy whatever the fuck</p>
<p>I wanted to buy who doesn&rsquo;t want that right but when I looked back at my life</p>
<p>when I was sitting down and just like saying I want financial freedom when I</p>
<p>assessed my actions what the fuck was I actually doing to get there nothing I was</p>
<p>not doing shit to actually make me more money I was trying certain things here</p>
<p>and there but nothing at the scale I needed to to get to where I wanted to go</p>
<p>like working a job is not abundance that&rsquo;s a fucking paycheck that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>salary that&rsquo;s gonna help you live what can you do to get out of that what can</p>
<p>you do to surpass that waking up going to the gym going to your job what part</p>
<p>of your day was actually focused on abundance none of it fucking none of it</p>
<p>so you really have to take inventory I was like Leo you&rsquo;re saying you want this</p>
<p>thing but do your actions match that do your actions match your desire no bitch</p>
<p>if you keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;re never gonna get there so how the</p>
<p>fuck do you expect to get there so after I kind of realized all this and took</p>
<p>inventory of like my life and I was like okay you&rsquo;re actually not putting your</p>
<p>ass behind anything that you say that you want I started to do that so I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know where to start with making money and like having financial</p>
<p>abundance so I just started reading about it I started reading everything I</p>
<p>could about money I started researching money the flow of money the energy of</p>
<p>money the transfer of money I started reading as many books as you can fucking</p>
<p>find on money I&rsquo;ve probably read all of them out there like the psychology of</p>
<p>money I&rsquo;ve looked up and researched and consumed everything about money that I</p>
<p>knew I could at the time and that brought me so many more perspectives</p>
<p>knowledge and guidance for trying to make it how&rsquo;d I just sat back and kept</p>
<p>saying Oh universe oh my god I want money I wouldn&rsquo;t be any closer even just</p>
<p>reading the fucking 20 books that I found I was so much closer and so much</p>
<p>more ahead and I was actually doing something to actualize it and then guess</p>
<p>what happened ideas started visiting me that would make me money I started</p>
<p>trying things I started doing a lot of shit different my whole perspective and</p>
<p>attitude and relationship to money flipped and it completely changed and it</p>
<p>allowed me to start being in circumstances and situations that feel</p>
<p>prepared for them and ready for them and a match to them to make money I also</p>
<p>researched how to manage money and what to do with it like how money is</p>
<p>transferred what you do with it literally I learned everything you could</p>
<p>about it and then like I say in my other podcast episodes like my one about</p>
<p>productivity just because you learn something doesn&rsquo;t mean shit now you need</p>
<p>to apply it this is where the action step comes in so at the beginning the</p>
<p>action step to get toward my goal was to learn about it okay I learned about it</p>
<p>now what learning about it don&rsquo;t do shit a lot of people get caught up in the</p>
<p>whole education side like I need to learn more no bitch there comes a point</p>
<p>where you just need to act like there&rsquo;s nothing left for me to learn about money</p>
<p>I just had to start acting and as soon as I started doing shit sure I failed</p>
<p>sure things fucked up but I started making money and now I&rsquo;m starting to</p>
<p>make money at a level that I&rsquo;m like I am financially free so it just stacks on</p>
<p>itself but you need to assess your actions what the fuck are you doing for</p>
<p>it what you don&rsquo;t get to sit here and just claim that you want money if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not doing jack shit for it and I know people are gonna get pissy like oh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people who are born into it we were you no you can&rsquo;t deal with the</p>
<p>cards in someone else&rsquo;s hand you can only deal with the cards that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been dealt so make the fucking best of it a lot of people don&rsquo;t have to learn</p>
<p>about money a lot of people are born into it or a lot of people do have</p>
<p>success on their first little venture and they become a fucking billionaire</p>
<p>overnight cool is that your hand of cards no you can sit here and cry and</p>
<p>complain like oh it&rsquo;s not fair what is that gonna do how is sitting here and</p>
<p>complaining and looking at how shit is not fair going to get you closer to your</p>
<p>goals it&rsquo;s not shut the fuck up and deal with what your situation is put blinders</p>
<p>on pretend like nothing else exists deal with your personal reality and what you</p>
<p>need to do to get to where you need to go that&rsquo;s what you need to focus on and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking it and I want to harp on that point one more time you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to know what to do literally take any step and it will just start to unfold</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna make sense because then when I look back on my life and my whole</p>
<p>journey a lot of things don&rsquo;t make sense for when I would go for something that I</p>
<p>wanted it would come in a way that I didn&rsquo;t expect or certain things would</p>
<p>happen and when I was going through it I was like what the fuck how does this</p>
<p>relate how is this even like what but if you just continue following it down that</p>
<p>path it&rsquo;s not gonna make sense for the first five steps but once you make 20</p>
<p>steps you&rsquo;re gonna be able to look back and be like okay those first five now I</p>
<p>get it now they make sense certain things can only be realized in</p>
<p>retrospect you can only realize and understand shit when you look back on it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get it while you&rsquo;re in it so just stay focused stay moving</p>
<p>forward keep taking steps even if they don&rsquo;t really make that much sense just</p>
<p>follow the shit just do it something is better than nothing okay just remember</p>
<p>me saying do not stop and always put your ass behind your words if you say</p>
<p>you want something okay now what am I gonna do for it and then start doing it</p>
<p>okay so assessment number two for your actions is how much you actually doing</p>
<p>like get really real with yourself and look at how much you&rsquo;re actually doing</p>
<p>toward your goal so when I was reading books on money and all this I was</p>
<p>reading like two to three a week and a lot of people would be like oh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>reading a book a month how fast you think that&rsquo;s gonna fucking come how fast</p>
<p>do you think you&rsquo;re gonna manifest that shit like get fucking for real like</p>
<p>again BFFR be fucking for real and look at how much you&rsquo;re actually doing like</p>
<p>when I started my app positive focus and I was trying to get it out there and</p>
<p>gain like awareness of it I was messaging therapists it was like an idea</p>
<p>that I had like Google all the therapists in the United States and</p>
<p>reach out to all the counselors and therapists I could find over email and</p>
<p>let them know about my app because I figured it would help me get awareness</p>
<p>of it and they could recommend it to clients I was okay it&rsquo;s probably gonna</p>
<p>be like a slow thing but like word-of-mouth it&rsquo;ll get out so like I</p>
<p>was like my main thing is just awareness of the app I need people to know it</p>
<p>exists so I would take an hour every day when I woke up and I would message 50</p>
<p>therapists and counselors like I would just go on type up an email and copy and</p>
<p>paste it and send it to 50 different fucking people 50 people looking back</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m like huh bitch like 50 people a day and you thought you was gonna get</p>
<p>some kind of return off of that please I literally learned this after like a</p>
<p>week I was like okay 50 a day like for real like look at your actions well how</p>
<p>much are you actually doing because you feel like you&rsquo;re doing a lot I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>convinced myself I was doing so much oh my god just 50 people oh my god it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just so much work I bumped that shit up to 300 I started doing 300 a day and</p>
<p>then I started seeing results because I wasn&rsquo;t seeing shit with 50 and I was</p>
<p>frustrated and I&rsquo;m like convincing myself I&rsquo;m doing so much work I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>doing so many 50 girl half the people ain&rsquo;t gonna fucking read the shit and</p>
<p>half the people ain&rsquo;t even gonna see it so like what one out of 50 is gonna say</p>
<p>something about it and you might get a download from that will be shit I</p>
<p>literally had to look at how much I was doing and get real with myself so I</p>
<p>started doing 300 a day and then I got to what I was doing 500 a day and I was</p>
<p>then I was actually like girl I&rsquo;m tired I&rsquo;m doing a lot of fucking work then I</p>
<p>felt like I was working and that&rsquo;s when I started seeing a little bit of return</p>
<p>on it and some more downloads but that&rsquo;s my biggest thing with assessment</p>
<p>number two how much are you actually doing and can you be doing more and if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re okay with only doing 50 a day you also need to sit down and shut the fuck</p>
<p>up and not be like oh my god why is it not happening faster what can you do to</p>
<p>make it happen faster like I said look for what&rsquo;s in your control look for what</p>
<p>you can do not oh my god universe why is it not happening faster girl you only</p>
<p>listen to 50 fucking emails a day bump that shit up asking the universe for</p>
<p>more is not gonna do anything you need to do things that are going to bring you</p>
<p>more downloads is what I was telling myself like take it out of the fucking</p>
<p>universe&rsquo;s hands what can I do that shit saved me and it saves me to this day with</p>
<p>everything that I do okay so assessment number three are you contradicting</p>
<p>yourself with your actions so if you say you want something are your actions in</p>
<p>line with it or are they contradicting it and if they&rsquo;re contradicting it you</p>
<p>need to clear that shit the fuck up quick so like when I used to say oh my</p>
<p>god I want to save money I&rsquo;d be over here spending a bunch of money where the</p>
<p>fuck does that make logical sense like clearly you have this goal of saving</p>
<p>money but you&rsquo;re doing things that are countering that it&rsquo;s like trying to lose</p>
<p>weight if you&rsquo;re trying to lose weight and you declare I want to lose weight I</p>
<p>have a desire to lose weight I&rsquo;m fat and then you go eat bad it&rsquo;s obvious the</p>
<p>disconnect it&rsquo;s obvious the reason you&rsquo;re not gonna fucking get there your</p>
<p>actions are what&rsquo;s fucking you up it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re not meditating enough</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re not revisiting childhood trauma correctly that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>you are holding on to weight no bitch is as simple as your fucking actions</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re contradicting your goddamn self no no wonder there&rsquo;s no progress and my</p>
<p>biggest thing with this is like you really need to take a look at your</p>
<p>actions and what&rsquo;s holding you back and what you can be doing instead because a</p>
<p>lot of this is in your control you sabotage yourself so much more than you</p>
<p>realize with a lot of things that you do like when I was trying to save money and</p>
<p>I was spending it literally everything was in my control it wasn&rsquo;t that the</p>
<p>universe hated me and I was just like doomed and fucked up like oh I just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t save money yes you can stop spending it or make more</p>
<p>whoa what a crazy idea but I didn&rsquo;t see it at the time I was just like oh my god</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just so many things that keep coming up that I have to buy do we</p>
<p>really have to buy them I understand unexpected expenses that&rsquo;s valid but</p>
<p>stop buying shit bitch like put your actions in line with what you say that</p>
<p>you want like stop eating if you want to lose weight no not stop eating entirely</p>
<p>but like stop eating bad shit stop eating so much literally how to do that</p>
<p>with myself too like I did all this at once and it was a fucking fever dream</p>
<p>from hell trying to like revamp my life in every aspect but look at me now you</p>
<p>got money and I&rsquo;m in shape okay so my next point is like a little tidbit I</p>
<p>just want to throw in about sacrifice because I have a bad relationship with</p>
<p>sacrifice and I do not believe in sacrificing things but at the end of the</p>
<p>day you are gonna have to make sacrifices but it is your decision for</p>
<p>how you feel about a certain sacrifice so sacrifices can feel good or they can</p>
<p>feel like shit and the way you look at them is it will make them feel good or</p>
<p>bad so you can negatively sacrifice I&rsquo;m gonna be like fuck and be like upset</p>
<p>about it and depressed about it and disappointed I just say disappointed and</p>
<p>less about depressed shut up y&rsquo;all fucking get it or you can feel really</p>
<p>good about a sacrifice and be like I&rsquo;m glad I did this so one thing that I do</p>
<p>is look at sacrifices like a trade-off so when I wanted to get my life on track</p>
<p>and I really wanted to pursue making money and like being successful I had to</p>
<p>stop doing a lot of the partying I was doing and hanging out with a lot of the</p>
<p>people that I was around so I had to make a trade-off and I was going into a</p>
<p>life where I was alone and not spending money not having fun not going out not</p>
<p>drinking not doing all this shit I was still smoking cigarettes because I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>getting rid of everything but I had to make that trade-off and a lot of people</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do it a lot of people can&rsquo;t make the trade-off and they can make it for a</p>
<p>minute and then they can&rsquo;t stick to it and that&rsquo;s a lot of people&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>problem but it&rsquo;s very very difficult to trade something off for something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the future so for me to trade off all of my current fun and my current</p>
<p>life with all my friends and like drugs and partying and drinking it&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>fun for me to trade all that off for the potential of success was very hard but</p>
<p>if you commit to figuring out a way to do it it will happen whether it takes</p>
<p>one year or ten years if you commit to figuring it the fuck out you will do it</p>
<p>but you will never get there if you don&rsquo;t make that trade-off so even if it</p>
<p>does take ten years you&rsquo;re gonna do it or not are you willing to sacrifice for</p>
<p>it or not if you&rsquo;re not that&rsquo;s totally okay there&rsquo;s certain sacrifices I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>willing to fucking make and if financial freedom and like securing yourself</p>
<p>financially is not something you&rsquo;re willing to sacrifice your social life</p>
<p>for then don&rsquo;t you can go after both it will just slow down the progress and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s totally okay you&rsquo;re allowed to set boundaries around what you will</p>
<p>sacrifice that&rsquo;s totally healthy that&rsquo;s totally fine I encourage you to so when</p>
<p>you ask the universe for something set a fucking boundary around it make shit</p>
<p>fall into your boundaries like you&rsquo;re not willing to give certain things up or</p>
<p>you are willing to give certain things up so that&rsquo;s one thing to get clear on</p>
<p>is what you&rsquo;re willing to trade off and what you&rsquo;re not willing to trade off but</p>
<p>my biggest thing with sacrifices is focusing on what I&rsquo;m choosing because if</p>
<p>you just focus on what you&rsquo;re losing all the time and what you no longer get to</p>
<p>have it&rsquo;s gonna feel negative but if you focus on what you&rsquo;re gaining and what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re choosing by making a certain trade-off or sacrifice it&rsquo;s gonna feel a</p>
<p>lot better you&rsquo;re not gonna feel like you&rsquo;re losing things all the time you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel like you&rsquo;re gaining things and you also have to keep yourself</p>
<p>accountable with what&rsquo;s in line with your goals so when I was cutting off my</p>
<p>friends and stopped partying and stopped drinking to start working on my</p>
<p>businesses and getting my fucking shit together I was spending money on alcohol</p>
<p>and going out to eat and drugs and all this shit and then when I switched I was</p>
<p>like okay I&rsquo;m gonna make the trade-off of not eating out not spending money on</p>
<p>shit and just saving the money so that I can invest it into the businesses that</p>
<p>I want to start and the things that I want to try so when I had the money in</p>
<p>my hand I got to make the trade-off of like do I want to go out to eat with it</p>
<p>or do I want to put it in my savings that&rsquo;s gonna help me actualize my desire</p>
<p>which one do you want to do which option is in line with your goals if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ever confused about which decision to make which action is gonna get me closer</p>
<p>to my goals and then do that one because putting it in my savings got me closer</p>
<p>to where I want it going and blowing it on a fucking bag or stop you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>speak so freely can I am I allowed to go speak freely or not like YouTube</p>
<p>demonetizes me I make nothing off YouTube but like am I allowed to speak</p>
<p>this freely I don&rsquo;t fucking know girl arrest me I don&rsquo;t give a shit I&rsquo;ll still</p>
<p>make my podcast from jail I&rsquo;ll just have to do it in like a written form so I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>like put an article out every week but anyway my whole point with that was just</p>
<p>focus on what you&rsquo;re choosing and what you&rsquo;re gaining over what you&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>sacrifices do not have to feel bad they can feel really good if you just focus</p>
<p>on what you&rsquo;re gaining and what you&rsquo;re getting but what I say what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>choosing you are choosing it it&rsquo;s not like oh I just have to give up on my</p>
<p>friends oh you&rsquo;re choosing it you can choose to go hang out with them but you</p>
<p>know where that path leads does it get you to where you want to go no okay so</p>
<p>my next little thing I want to hit on is about when shit goes wrong and when</p>
<p>things get difficult and things start fucking up because that&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>would stop me a lot in the past like I was like oh my god it&rsquo;s a sign I should</p>
<p>stop no what you need to do is recommit every time something fucks up or goes</p>
<p>wrong literally reassess the situation if you&rsquo;ve tried something and it hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worked how much are you willing to recommit to it the universe is kind of</p>
<p>gonna test you I don&rsquo;t really know if it&rsquo;s a test but it&rsquo;s like everything</p>
<p>that goes wrong and you recommit it&rsquo;s like the more energy you&rsquo;re putting into</p>
<p>this thing being manifest so if nothing can stop you from shoving your energy</p>
<p>into it it&rsquo;s gonna come if you just hurdle every single thing that fucking</p>
<p>comes up and you keep recommitting to it you keep recommitting your energy to it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna fucking manifest but if you have hurdles happen you don&rsquo;t jump</p>
<p>them and you just stop putting your energy into it you&rsquo;re never gonna get it</p>
<p>but I have noticed the more that I recommit to things the more things line</p>
<p>up like it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ll recommit like five or six times and I&rsquo;m like enough</p>
<p>bitch and then all of a sudden it&rsquo;s like a streak of things just lining up weird</p>
<p>like the universe is there to help you and will guide you but the universe is</p>
<p>there to co-create you have universal energy inside of you God energy whatever</p>
<p>you want to fucking say like the ability to create is inside of all of us but the</p>
<p>universe at large is going to co-create with you it&rsquo;s not gonna sit here and</p>
<p>give you anything if you&rsquo;re just sitting on your ass you chose into this life to</p>
<p>go about manifesting things and through your actions and having that energy and</p>
<p>expressing that and creating the things that you want so do it like the universe</p>
<p>is not gonna fucking do it for you and what I mean by recommit oh my god girl</p>
<p>when I had the desire to make my podcast a video podcast on YouTube and start</p>
<p>filming this every fucking thing you can imagine would go wrong went wrong</p>
<p>every single thing went wrong when I ordered my camera it was an absolute</p>
<p>shitshow absolute shitshow with everything that happened with it my mic</p>
<p>I ordered two pieces of it I didn&rsquo;t realize you needed like all this other</p>
<p>shit to go with it so I had to like push off like starting to record on YouTube</p>
<p>for a week and that&rsquo;s what happened in the beginning like the guy you guys</p>
<p>that have been here like since me like transitioning from like audio to video</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t know episode 1 through 39 of my podcast is just audio it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>Apple podcasts and Spotify but all my video episodes like switching and</p>
<p>starting to record it also bro every single thing that went wrong could go</p>
<p>wrong and it did and I recommitted every single time every single time something</p>
<p>went wrong with the microphone I bought more shit with the camera I sent it back</p>
<p>and returned it and exchange it and got the right one cuz like they sent me a</p>
<p>broken one and then the other one wasn&rsquo;t gonna get here in time before I</p>
<p>still wanted to start filming so I ordered a different one used it for two</p>
<p>weeks and then returned it while the other one was coming that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>video shit looks so different but I made it fucking work I made it happen I had</p>
<p>to keep recommitting I had to fucking buy lighting there was so many things</p>
<p>like my software for my computer learning how to fucking use it a pain in</p>
<p>the ass but I committed to figuring it out when I recorded my first episode I</p>
<p>had a stain on my shirt and I had to rerecord the whole fucking thing the</p>
<p>second episode I did I recorded it all the audio didn&rsquo;t save had to record it</p>
<p>again I kept having these hurdles happen and I kept recommitting and look at me</p>
<p>now on fucking YouTube and I&rsquo;ve been doing it consistently but shit&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>come up shit&rsquo;s gonna go wrong but the more you recommit the more energy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting into it and the more confident you&rsquo;ll feel that you will make shit</p>
<p>happen like you snatch the fucking power out of the universe and you find</p>
<p>it in yourself and you&rsquo;re no longer like oh my god please help it&rsquo;s like nah Leo</p>
<p>you got this it&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t need help I don&rsquo;t need you to fucking assist</p>
<p>me I&rsquo;ll do it I don&rsquo;t care what comes up I&rsquo;m gonna make it happen that is when</p>
<p>you feel happy and fulfilled and that life is worth living is when you feel</p>
<p>like you fucking control it so that&rsquo;s the way to get there also with moving to</p>
<p>Houston girl when I tell you everything went wrong about the podcast switching</p>
<p>it every fucking thing went wrong when I moved to Houston but I was committed to</p>
<p>moving here and living here and making it happen I did a whole podcast episode</p>
<p>I did too about all the headache and all the bullshit I was going through they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>both on the audio version of my podcast but I vented about like everything going</p>
<p>wrong and I kept having to recommit there was no option to opt out I did not</p>
<p>give myself the option of like going back home or not moving here motherfucker</p>
<p>once I decided I wanted it them actions were in line with it and I kept</p>
<p>hurtling everything that came up and I kept recommitting and it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>decision I ever fucking made so if you&rsquo;re facing something where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like everything&rsquo;s just going wrong at the beginning maybe it&rsquo;s a sign maybe</p>
<p>the fuck it&rsquo;s not maybe you&rsquo;re not being punished you&rsquo;re being prepared for what</p>
<p>the fuck you need to go through to be strong enough to handle when you get</p>
<p>this desire because a lot of the things that went wrong when I moved to Houston</p>
<p>prepared me for everything I&rsquo;ve had to handle and who I&rsquo;ve had to grow into to</p>
<p>handle all the situations that I&rsquo;m in now it was all a key part of it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not being punished you&rsquo;re being prepared but it&rsquo;s gonna feel like you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>punished while you&rsquo;re going through it like I kept looking up at the universe</p>
<p>like you fucking rat bitch what the fuck is the point I literally am so like I</p>
<p>get it I get why everything has had to happen this way I get that it&rsquo;s built me</p>
<p>into who I am but when I die when I get to the gates of heaven I&rsquo;m not saying a</p>
<p>word God put your fucking hands up I&rsquo;m walking in that bitch and I&rsquo;m swinging</p>
<p>on site I&rsquo;m just going to town you motherfucker wanted to sit up there my</p>
<p>whole life and throw shit at me my whole life and just think it was funny I think</p>
<p>there was no consequence for my actions I know it was here to help me but you</p>
<p>punk bitch you&rsquo;re gonna get my fucking lick back I don&rsquo;t care if you beat my</p>
<p>ass I&rsquo;m going to hell anyway cuz I&rsquo;m gay but I&rsquo;m gonna throw hands with you bitch</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying shit when I walk into the gates of heaven I&rsquo;m just swinging my</p>
<p>soul is so pissed off oh my god like I get it I understand everything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened I get how it was for me but fuck you for making me go through that</p>
<p>shit you could have found a different way like you just had to make so many</p>
<p>minor inconveniences happened for me like what the fuck every single thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever tried I&rsquo;ve always felt is so prevented because the amount of</p>
<p>ironic shit that goes wrong I&rsquo;ve handled it all and I&rsquo;ve hurtled it all</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna get my fucking lick back bitch watch me live to like 120 years</p>
<p>old cuz God don&rsquo;t want me to die he&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t want that one coming up</p>
<p>here but my point behind that little tangent is shit&rsquo;s gonna feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being punished and like it&rsquo;s going wrong keep hurtling keep recommitting trust me</p>
<p>from someone who&rsquo;s been there keep recommitting just do it it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>happen okay so now I want to talk about a couple of little things that you</p>
<p>require action because a lot of people like to get into the delusional thinking</p>
<p>of like oh you can just manifest shit so I&rsquo;m gonna pop that bubble real quick so</p>
<p>if you want to build muscle you can&rsquo;t just sit in your bed and just imagine it</p>
<p>and meditate and rub a crystal on your fucking clit and fucking like sit there</p>
<p>and think it into existence you have to go pick up a weight you have to go eat</p>
<p>protein and eat shit that&rsquo;s gonna rebuild your body you have to go break</p>
<p>down the muscles and then fuel your body to rebuild them bigger that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>it goes you cannot get big muscle wise without taking action I don&rsquo;t care how</p>
<p>long you lay in your fucking bed and visualize it good luck bitch that hold</p>
<p>the secret everybody loves mm-hmm bunch of horse shit there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>miscommunication and things that are not clarified girl the same thing with</p>
<p>growing on social media like when I had the desire to grow on social media you</p>
<p>have to post fucker you have to do shit you can&rsquo;t just sit here and oh my god I</p>
<p>posted one video hope it blows up for real a lot of people think like that and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like I need to wake you up sure a lot of people can make one video and</p>
<p>blow up like the wizard Liz like that bucking bitch is like a weird case or</p>
<p>she just made one video and it popped off but would she have gotten as big as</p>
<p>she is if she only ever made that one video no can you only bank on that one</p>
<p>video doing well no what can you bank on you can bank on the numbers game of</p>
<p>how many videos you will post so if you only give one video for the universe to</p>
<p>have go viral if you want to play it like that give the universe a thousand</p>
<p>videos to make go viral and see what the fuck happens raise your likelihood raise</p>
<p>your fucking likelihood and put your actions behind it and create it like</p>
<p>literally the ones bound to pop off if you do a thousand if you make one</p>
<p>probability is like this probability is like so itty-bitty like an ant but now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna kind of get into things like the podcast that I&rsquo;m gonna be on I had a</p>
<p>desire that I wanted to go on some big podcasts and like go be a guest cuz I</p>
<p>just I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do that like go on podcasts and just like share some</p>
<p>shit that I know or like help you guys get to know me like getting interviewed</p>
<p>is different from me being here so you&rsquo;ll see me in a whole different light</p>
<p>when I go on Drew&rsquo;s podcast and I&rsquo;m also going on spin spots I&rsquo;m actually leaving</p>
<p>tomorrow to go to LA but you&rsquo;ll be seeing this on Sunday so happy Sunday</p>
<p>but I had a desire to get on bigger podcasts now I can sit here and just</p>
<p>grow my social media and keep posting and just wait for someone to stumble</p>
<p>across my page and maybe ask me to be on their podcast or I can take it the more</p>
<p>active and empowered approach and reach out to people what&rsquo;s the higher</p>
<p>likelihood bitch what&rsquo;s actually gonna help me actualize that and manifest that</p>
<p>desire and have those opportunities I&rsquo;m gonna take the active approach I started</p>
<p>messaging people and it fucking worked like I messaged drew she was like the</p>
<p>first one I messaged and it fucking worked and now I&rsquo;m gonna be on the</p>
<p>podcast but I had to take the active approach of reaching out you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>sit back and be like universe send me podcasts to be on girly pop get your</p>
<p>fucking fingers moving type you some shit reach out make your own podcast</p>
<p>make a name for yourself that someone would want to have you on their podcast</p>
<p>as a guest and then it will increase the likelihood you see what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>take the empowered approach with everything stop doing the powerless</p>
<p>shit my last little example I want to give you is like when I created my app I</p>
<p>talk about this a lot but it&rsquo;s such a good learning experience for everyone</p>
<p>even myself but when I talk about taking actions even though you don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>to do I had an idea to make this app okay so I started researching it to see</p>
<p>if something else existed nothing on like the quality level that I wanted</p>
<p>existed like the quality of the messages coming through those other notification</p>
<p>apps that will send you positive notifications but they&rsquo;re like little</p>
<p>horse shit like they&rsquo;re like fucking stupid I wanted things that would</p>
<p>actually make you think and would shift your focus so I was like okay there was</p>
<p>a hole in the market I&rsquo;ll do it how do you create an app I don&rsquo;t fucking know I</p>
<p>literally didn&rsquo;t know so first thing I did was go to a trademark attorney and</p>
<p>have the name trademarked and then I asked him how do I have an app created</p>
<p>and then he guided me to where to start looking for an app developer and then I</p>
<p>had the app developed but there was so many things that went wrong with me</p>
<p>trying to start this fucking app but I do want to say there are gonna be</p>
<p>messages and signs that you are being guided and I don&rsquo;t know if you believe</p>
<p>in numerology or not but repeating numbers are gonna pop up when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going down the right path and you&rsquo;re doing something you&rsquo;re gonna start</p>
<p>seeing synchronicities and things are gonna pop up and it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>universe&rsquo;s way of communicating with you that you&rsquo;re supported so a lot of</p>
<p>things were going wrong with me just meeting with this fucking attorney to</p>
<p>even just get to know where I&rsquo;m supposed to go next but before I went to go see</p>
<p>an attorney I convinced myself I can just be an app developer and for 30 days</p>
<p>I was like trying to learn how to code and create an app and it just was too</p>
<p>much and I couldn&rsquo;t figure it the fuck out I could have had I kept doing it but</p>
<p>I was just not willing to keep putting in that work I&rsquo;ll just fucking pay for</p>
<p>someone for it like I was like dealing cars at the time I had some money so I</p>
<p>literally was like okay I want this app out quick I don&rsquo;t have another fucking</p>
<p>year to sit here and fucking teach myself how to code so I&rsquo;ll just go pay</p>
<p>someone to do it and then when I met up with the attorney so many things were</p>
<p>going wrong and I was like am I making the right decision is this attorney</p>
<p>gonna be able to help me am I gonna get the name positive focus because I had to</p>
<p>request it like I it was very hard to get that trademarked but when I went to</p>
<p>the attorney I was a little doubtful and I was a little like all right</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been too many hurdles already like is this shit even like like goddamn</p>
<p>is it worth it like how many hoops do I have to jump through like I&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>fucking circus animal I was one for this app jump through all kind of hoops but</p>
<p>one of the synchronicities that I had happen was the lawyer brought up like</p>
<p>some kind of mock-up paperwork and there was like a screenshot of a certain app</p>
<p>and it was like one of the apps that I had look up to like create the concept</p>
<p>off of and then put my own quotes and like change the design and all that sure</p>
<p>but like the concept I had the attorney I didn&rsquo;t tell him anything about this he</p>
<p>was like oh I just printed this out in case you wanted it and to like help you</p>
<p>because I really liked the idea behind your app because I had like been on the</p>
<p>phone with them before I went to see him to tell him what the meeting was about</p>
<p>and then when I saw him it was like to draft everything up and like get the</p>
<p>trademark submitted he printed out ideas for me it was the exact same app</p>
<p>that I was like inspired by and on the top of the screenshot on his phone he</p>
<p>screenshotted the like App Store and the time on his phone was 4 4 4 and it was</p>
<p>printed said I still have the paper I don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s at but I still</p>
<p>have that paper of the mock-up he printed and he just printed that for me</p>
<p>to have it was like here I want to like help you however I can but that was the</p>
<p>universe&rsquo;s way of talking to me in that moment because I was second-guessing</p>
<p>shit and I didn&rsquo;t know if it was worth it but like how do you fucking explain</p>
<p>that you know like you got to watch out for those synchronicities look for</p>
<p>repeating numbers 4 4 4 7 7 7 anything that there is I actually have 7 7 7</p>
<p>tattooed on my foot right here me and my sister have it matching but that little</p>
<p>synchronicity brought me so much comfort in that moment because I was like like</p>
<p>all my questioning went away and I fully was like I&rsquo;m doing this like I</p>
<p>felt supported to recommit so I fucking did there was a whole shit show of new</p>
<p>obstacles that came up after that but there was also synchronicities that like</p>
<p>helped me along and even when there was periods where there was no</p>
<p>synchronicities I still was just driving through it and then more would pop up</p>
<p>but my point with that is to say you are being guided whether you want to believe</p>
<p>in a higher power or the universe or anything you&rsquo;re being guided and you</p>
<p>will be tested but the more you recommit I swear to God it just lines up</p>
<p>like the more you can recommit no matter how bad it gets the more you recommit</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s a relationship give that shit the fuck up but the more you</p>
<p>commit to a goal I swear to God it&rsquo;s gonna get bad it&rsquo;s gonna get dark but</p>
<p>just keep moving keep recommitting if you really really want it if something</p>
<p>can stop you from recommitting you don&rsquo;t want it bad enough try something else</p>
<p>but if you know you fucking want this thing and you&rsquo;re committed to it nothing</p>
<p>will be able to stop you and that level of forward-moving creative energy coming</p>
<p>out of any being that shit&rsquo;s gonna manifest and that is where I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>leave this podcast episode off I hope this was helpful I&rsquo;m sorry if you got</p>
<p>offended but you needed to hear all this you can&rsquo;t fight me and say that it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t good information love you it was all coming from the heart it was all</p>
<p>things I wish someone would have told me I&rsquo;m just like the person that will say</p>
<p>it everybody else wants a sugarcoat shit because they&rsquo;re trying to sell you</p>
<p>courses about how to manifest but if you enjoyed this video leave it a</p>
<p>thumbs up and if you&rsquo;re new to YouTube hit the subscribe button check out my</p>
