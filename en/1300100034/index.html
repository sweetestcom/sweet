    <p>tada it came</p>
<p>out twice yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very oh did it yeah this thing&rsquo;s very clunky</p>
<p>this you stream thing</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>thank you very much for tuning in</p>
<p>my guest this week</p>
<p>the lovely and talented Mr Doug Benson</p>
<p>hey everybody Doug</p>
<p>Benson everybody hey before we get</p>
<p>started we have</p>
<p>to mention that this show is being sponsored by The</p>
<p>Flashlight Doug Benson have you ever fucked one of</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>I have not I</p>
<p>heard you and Dane Cook talking</p>
<p>about it last week they&rsquo;re awesome man it&rsquo;s really like</p>
<p>takes masturbation to a</p>
<p>whole new level</p>
<p>it seems you know it&rsquo;s a very embarrassing</p>
<p>thing to purchase</p>
<p>it seems has that one been used or</p>
<p>is that just</p>
<p>for I would</p>
<p>never do that too is that just the</p>
<p>jokes recently</p>
<p>well not that you would</p>
<p>you know necessarily</p>
<p>mess it up just by holding it or whatever no</p>
<p>cause you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>touch anything I mean no one&rsquo;s fucked it</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t give you one at someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fault that&rsquo;s good yeah yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong right</p>
<p>have you ever fucked a non taste</p>
<p>flashlight one no like I just fucked one the</p>
<p>other day completely different</p>
<p>it fucks it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t feel anything like better</p>
<p>worse oh way</p>
<p>worse way worse way</p>
<p>worse yeah somebody else told me that I</p>
<p>think it was Hephron said that he fucked</p>
<p>a knockoff fake</p>
<p>flashlight you said it wasn&rsquo;t very good yeah</p>
<p>but these are outstanding</p>
<p>a lot of research it</p>
<p>seems like it&rsquo;d be awesome but</p>
<p>now I totally get</p>
<p>what you were saying last week</p>
<p>about how it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>right in terms of</p>
<p>you feel bad</p>
<p>about yourself</p>
<p>embarrassing</p>
<p>yeah is it that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s so heavy</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing like I</p>
<p>guess you&rsquo;d get a little bit of a</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had other</p>
<p>light arm workout but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it back</p>
<p>right turn my volume up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had other people</p>
<p>talk to me about this thing and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an embarrassing</p>
<p>thing they&rsquo;re like why</p>
<p>would you you know want to be</p>
<p>represented</p>
<p>by this rubber vagina</p>
<p>like he keeps</p>
<p>coming up he came up with like another person that was</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>sponsoring the show</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to be connected with the</p>
<p>flashlight really that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird to me it&rsquo;s childish</p>
<p>it really it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>childish but now you just get that company and</p>
<p>flashlight to outbid each</p>
<p>other until</p>
<p>yeah you would have</p>
<p>something like that</p>
<p>but then you would</p>
<p>never know I mean</p>
<p>then you show no loyalty</p>
<p>to something that you actually believe</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>wrong with fucking this thing</p>
<p>and you want to pretend</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where people don&rsquo;t want to talk</p>
<p>about sexual</p>
<p>things because somehow or another talking</p>
<p>about sexual things</p>
<p>makes people uncomfortable</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s creepy</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a natural part of life</p>
<p>and like most rational people at a certain</p>
<p>point in time just kind of accept that</p>
<p>and then you can joke</p>
<p>about it and go hey I fuck this rubber pussy haha</p>
<p>is it good yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great you should try it</p>
<p>and then everything&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>but for some people it</p>
<p>never gets to that</p>
<p>place never gets</p>
<p>that comfortable yeah well</p>
<p>I think it depends on how comfortable you are with</p>
<p>other men like who</p>
<p>you kind of came up with and if you all talk to each</p>
<p>other that way or not you know like</p>
<p>I had a lot of fairly prudish friends like we&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>dirty things but we wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>admit to any of our own personal</p>
<p>activities the way that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>other groups of friends do it</p>
<p>you see these</p>
<p>packs of people that all just have a different code</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>whether they fucked a prostitute or not is</p>
<p>gonna come up in one</p>
<p>group but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna come up in another totally that&rsquo;s so important</p>
<p>so important</p>
<p>hanging around the dudes are</p>
<p>gonna tell you everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so huge embarrassing</p>
<p>ridiculous retarded all of it I</p>
<p>wanna hear it come on</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you must get some good stuff from</p>
<p>everyone I know from</p>
<p>yeah but also like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like really kind of almost a code of</p>
<p>stand up these days is</p>
<p>just be super honest and</p>
<p>and it ends up</p>
<p>just to be original you kind of have to talk</p>
<p>about some stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>brutal and out there you know</p>
<p>yeah you can&rsquo;t really do I mean it&rsquo;s almost like the</p>
<p>Jerry Seinfeld</p>
<p>route has been</p>
<p>said so many times and gone</p>
<p>down so many roads it&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t see anything there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if you want to do</p>
<p>stand up today</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>Jerry Seinfeld as</p>
<p>Jerry Seinfeld you know that</p>
<p>style is hilarious</p>
<p>at it but I don&rsquo;t want to see a new one of those</p>
<p>well also he sort of</p>
<p>teach sort of turned it into another</p>
<p>thing like he made it popular</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more fun now to</p>
<p>watch actors on a show like The Office</p>
<p>recreating awkward situations that happen every day</p>
<p>that it is your one guy just describing it</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>the Seinfeld</p>
<p>show just sort of brought to life his comedy</p>
<p>and that made him a funnier guy to me because</p>
<p>prior to that he was a pack of</p>
<p>part of a pack of guys that all just did</p>
<p>clean cut observational humor</p>
<p>and I love them all I thought they were really</p>
<p>funny like guys like him and</p>
<p>Larry Miller and</p>
<p>and you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of them yeah I was a</p>
<p>big fan of the evening at the improv</p>
<p>yeah yeah and</p>
<p>those guys were on</p>
<p>those things all the time</p>
<p>I totally grew up on</p>
<p>watching that</p>
<p>stuff but then immediately embraced</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>you know like you can</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to just observe</p>
<p>things you can</p>
<p>yeah experience them yeah I want to hear like</p>
<p>I really tell me</p>
<p>what you did not what everybody does</p>
<p>I want to hear a dangerous thought to</p>
<p>admit I want to hear</p>
<p>you know I want to hear some some</p>
<p>truth that we can all agree with</p>
<p>I want to hear something fucked up to</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hear the regular shit I get</p>
<p>bored with it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of it</p>
<p>I wanna hear something you know</p>
<p>I like look forward to Joey</p>
<p>diaz&rsquo;s sets more than anybody I like</p>
<p>strong joke writing though</p>
<p>you know I do too</p>
<p>that can get me through</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re right it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>as soon as he</p>
<p>starts to be too much</p>
<p>about the best is both right</p>
<p>yeah of course</p>
<p>yeah I love</p>
<p>anyone is a</p>
<p>great joke writer and</p>
<p>a good performer that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s unbeatable that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Louis CK yeah but you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>about Seinfeld</p>
<p>like he was he was</p>
<p>such a brilliant joke writer and deliverer like in his</p>
<p>style and then to have that show</p>
<p>and then you really see where</p>
<p>Kirby enthusiasm really got to see</p>
<p>where Larry</p>
<p>David had a big hands in it too</p>
<p>once I started</p>
<p>started seeing that show was like oh</p>
<p>okay this guy is like the king</p>
<p>of creating like really awkward situations that like</p>
<p>literally you</p>
<p>watch like some</p>
<p>of the shows you find yourself contorting</p>
<p>cause you like</p>
<p>what you fucking saying you know it&rsquo;s so good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s he does such a good job of weaving</p>
<p>that web you know he&rsquo;s one of my masters is he yeah</p>
<p>and it takes it up a notch too</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like on HBO</p>
<p>so that the language in</p>
<p>those situations can be</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s part of it is he</p>
<p>often says you know he</p>
<p>often says some</p>
<p>he swears inappropriately in</p>
<p>front of people sometimes yeah</p>
<p>and subject you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do that shit on Seinfeld because it had to be all TV</p>
<p>appropriate</p>
<p>you remember when there was the</p>
<p>water bottle in his</p>
<p>pants and there was a little girl</p>
<p>and you know there was like some implication like</p>
<p>people thought that he had a hard on because a little</p>
<p>girl was there I forget how he set it up but I was like</p>
<p>wow yeah if you listed</p>
<p>everything that he was guilty of in the</p>
<p>7 seasons of that show he&rsquo;s done some pretty horrible</p>
<p>things you know</p>
<p>like he does</p>
<p>the worst thing in</p>
<p>every situation you know like</p>
<p>I forget what he did to some</p>
<p>Holocaust survivors but it was I&rsquo;m sure it was awful oh</p>
<p>shows like that are so important</p>
<p>show you that there&rsquo;s like another</p>
<p>level out there</p>
<p>know like I think that&rsquo;s important for</p>
<p>stand up still</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think like it&rsquo;s good sometimes to</p>
<p>watch somebody else</p>
<p>you know somebody really good you know</p>
<p>watch like a Bill Cosby in his</p>
<p>prime or something like that just to</p>
<p>really get inspired</p>
<p>or get you know just really kick it up to another</p>
<p>another gear</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s always good to</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a huge part of</p>
<p>I hate to give advice to people</p>
<p>starting out but one of the</p>
<p>things I say to them if they insist on having some is</p>
<p>watch as much</p>
<p>stand up comedy as you can</p>
<p>and unfortunately we get kind of</p>
<p>tired of watching it as</p>
<p>after we&rsquo;ve done it for years and years</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still important to kind of</p>
<p>check into it</p>
<p>every once in a</p>
<p>while because it just</p>
<p>ups your game and you know what everybody else is doing</p>
<p>yeah it inspires</p>
<p>you know it does something to you makes you</p>
<p>excited about performing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m most</p>
<p>excited about writing</p>
<p>after I see like you know I&rsquo;ll see Chappelle perform</p>
<p>I go fuck I just wanna go</p>
<p>right you know it just makes me want to create new shit</p>
<p>you know well that&rsquo;s the other</p>
<p>great thing</p>
<p>about being a</p>
<p>stand up is when you have that impulse you</p>
<p>could just come up with one</p>
<p>great joke and be satisfied</p>
<p>like I hate it when I see a</p>
<p>great movie</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m driving home like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna write a goddamn screenplay</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just too big of a task to really</p>
<p>commit to in that moment of excitement</p>
<p>but writing a joke</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>excited about writing jokes and you</p>
<p>write a good one it&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>I did that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>10 20 minutes work</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and sometimes they come in full form</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>come to you out of the air it&rsquo;s like a little gift</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing you were talking</p>
<p>about that with Dane Cook</p>
<p>about when you</p>
<p>say something</p>
<p>when the crowd is so great</p>
<p>the next sentence</p>
<p>after the joke</p>
<p>is probably</p>
<p>gonna get a</p>
<p>laugh anyway</p>
<p>but when it gets a</p>
<p>huge laugh then you</p>
<p>suddenly got a new end of the joke yeah out</p>
<p>of nowhere I</p>
<p>write out of the ether</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how most of my I you know I do most of my writing</p>
<p>on stage just in the sense that</p>
<p>you know sometimes I have a joke that&rsquo;s worked out</p>
<p>you know perfectly beginning</p>
<p>middle and end but for the most part it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>like this is sort of something I want to try to address</p>
<p>and then just see</p>
<p>where it goes and</p>
<p>have a good joke</p>
<p>ready to go</p>
<p>right after it if it ends up yeah</p>
<p>not ending up getting anywhere</p>
<p>yeah I agree with you I do I do both</p>
<p>how high do you get before you go on stage</p>
<p>well now people</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m high whether I&rsquo;m high or I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>like they just accuse me of it regardless so</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>I can be as high as I want to be</p>
<p>which is just you know it just all comes down</p>
<p>to timing you know if you have to race from the airport</p>
<p>you have to race from the airport to the gig you</p>
<p>might not be very high</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re chilling that day</p>
<p>you know and you got</p>
<p>a show at 8 o&rsquo;clock and not much to do in the afternoon</p>
<p>other than you know</p>
<p>work on your computer and interviews and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>like I get really high for interviews now like</p>
<p>phoners yeah me too</p>
<p>I love that I love that too just being</p>
<p>super big cause then</p>
<p>when they do</p>
<p>throw to you you will talk</p>
<p>until they stop you</p>
<p>and sometimes</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t jump in so you can really get a lot of</p>
<p>stuff in I know</p>
<p>I find myself</p>
<p>almost like feeling bad</p>
<p>for what I&rsquo;m subjecting to interview or to sometimes</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start on some</p>
<p>like really innocent question and I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>start going on about</p>
<p>what is the</p>
<p>cause of humanity what are we here for like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally nothing to do with anything we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>but in my mind what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about is</p>
<p>the whole vision of the</p>
<p>world and where it&rsquo;s headed and</p>
<p>it might have been a really simple question</p>
<p>yeah and they needed to wrap it up so they</p>
<p>could play some more kesha</p>
<p>yeah and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>super banked going on</p>
<p>about the universe it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s all coming to me in</p>
<p>these big waves</p>
<p>I just need to get it out</p>
<p>you know it is fun to get high and then</p>
<p>write you know or sometimes have you ever done this</p>
<p>have you ever gotten high and then went oh crap now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>starting to have ideas and I&rsquo;m not in the mood to</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>ready to write down ideas</p>
<p>right now I want to just get high and watch TV</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;ve got it</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;ve actually got to go to work for</p>
<p>a little bit because the ideas are too good to ignore</p>
<p>I got way too high the</p>
<p>other day and went on</p>
<p>stage and went</p>
<p>to the I was at the John lovett&rsquo;s Comedy Club</p>
<p>so you think this dude I think</p>
<p>I was on a plane with Lovitz the</p>
<p>other day yeah</p>
<p>I got in his eyeline a couple times to</p>
<p>see if he knew who I was and he had no idea that&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>but if he was like holy shit you&rsquo;re Doug Benson</p>
<p>would that give you</p>
<p>am I well no I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>well I did grow</p>
<p>up on love it&rsquo;s I mean</p>
<p>he has been in a lot of</p>
<p>great things and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought he was a</p>
<p>funny guy but</p>
<p>he was so sad sack acting that it</p>
<p>would be hard to be</p>
<p>excited about he&rsquo;s a nice guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a really nice guy but he was just kind of like</p>
<p>traveling by himself you know how that is just like</p>
<p>humping through the airport like you</p>
<p>know just want</p>
<p>to get it over with just don&rsquo;t want too many people to</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m sure like</p>
<p>he must have gone through a period of time</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>catchphrases</p>
<p>that people yell at him or they&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re a liar</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>ticket that&rsquo;s the ticket</p>
<p>guy yeah yeah</p>
<p>he must have used to got that a lot</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m sure he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get it so much but</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you use</p>
<p>technology to help with your ideas though</p>
<p>cause I know that you</p>
<p>instead of writing it down just like talk make a</p>
<p>movie do audio because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there in your pocket well I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>starting to get there</p>
<p>like I finally got the most recent iPhone oh you did</p>
<p>I made the first</p>
<p>video that I ever</p>
<p>uploaded on the Internet</p>
<p>where I just filmed</p>
<p>myself doing something and then sent it out there</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m definitely</p>
<p>gonna do more of that</p>
<p>you should it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smart way to</p>
<p>go fast it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super fast super</p>
<p>smart and fast and it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>people love content they want you to keep doing</p>
<p>stuff but were you saying</p>
<p>about being at the Love Its Club</p>
<p>comedy club oh I got way too baked</p>
<p>this guy gave me a cookie in between the stage Joey</p>
<p>there were like</p>
<p>these little</p>
<p>what are those little</p>
<p>long banana shaped</p>
<p>things called</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>Scotty Scotty</p>
<p>not really banana but that&rsquo;s the closest thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it is I</p>
<p>could see the banana how do you describe that shape</p>
<p>heart shape cookie</p>
<p>hard coffee hard</p>
<p>cookie canoe</p>
<p>coffee cookie</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best what a cookie can do cookie canoe</p>
<p>this guy I didn&rsquo;t even eat 1/4 of one man I didn&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>he goes they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>strong okay just I took a bite one bite</p>
<p>45 minutes later I was on stage and I was aboard an</p>
<p>alien spacecraft while I was talking to these people</p>
<p>I mean I was barely there</p>
<p>barely there enough to communicate I was so high</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way I should have been talking in public</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a surreal</p>
<p>space when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>stage there too because of the way they have</p>
<p>those balconies</p>
<p>3 floors like</p>
<p>and the balconies are rather close to you but just</p>
<p>up high very shallow but really high and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of exciting but also</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different than what we&rsquo;re used to</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s cool I mean it was a fun club you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird about that club is how the bars open and so</p>
<p>halfway through the show you&rsquo;re just hearing clinking</p>
<p>and clunking and people that happens in a lot of</p>
<p>places I know I</p>
<p>think put a curtain</p>
<p>right up they</p>
<p>could but you know what it ain&rsquo;t that bad</p>
<p>like San Francisco</p>
<p>punchline doesn&rsquo;t have a career</p>
<p>and that works out okay yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s far somehow it adds to the ambiance though</p>
<p>all that noise</p>
<p>as long as people aren&rsquo;t douchey</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter but you are</p>
<p>right it does give an opportunity for</p>
<p>things to get annoying</p>
<p>anytime you have 1bar</p>
<p>where people can</p>
<p>stand and order a</p>
<p>drink you&rsquo;re fucked or</p>
<p>divert attention</p>
<p>to from the</p>
<p>crowd or get</p>
<p>through it quick</p>
<p>quietly cause people</p>
<p>yeah people</p>
<p>start hitting</p>
<p>on people and talking the last show I did like</p>
<p>where it was a</p>
<p>standing room show</p>
<p>me and Joey</p>
<p>did the show in Memphis and was like this last</p>
<p>minute booking and it was</p>
<p>a rock club</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;re like oh yeah they have bands there</p>
<p>fuck it well you know I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be set up fine</p>
<p>and the guys like he wants to do</p>
<p>standing room</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t I said okay</p>
<p>fine fuck it the</p>
<p>whole half the room was standing</p>
<p>half the room was seated and was really strange</p>
<p>it was like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing on</p>
<p>a stage and to your right</p>
<p>everyone seated</p>
<p>and to your left is 1bar</p>
<p>so literally like</p>
<p>everything to your left is like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like 200 people just standing</p>
<p>and talking yeah of course it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>stand up in 1bar and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re barely paying</p>
<p>attention yeah they&rsquo;re acting like a band is on stage</p>
<p>I used to do that at the</p>
<p>House of Blues too but now</p>
<p>after we went to see Stanhope</p>
<p>and we had a stand</p>
<p>and it was horrible it was like</p>
<p>after an hour like your fucking back hurts your neck</p>
<p>starts to kink up</p>
<p>and so I said I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to subject anybody this anymore yeah</p>
<p>it is I feel bad for people when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing during the show</p>
<p>do you ever say no</p>
<p>that you won&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>those shows and just I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really gotten to that position where like</p>
<p>you know if that&rsquo;s an option and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get more</p>
<p>bodies in the</p>
<p>venue you know</p>
<p>gets less bodies in the</p>
<p>venue you lose money</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s to me it&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>oh to let him sit you mean</p>
<p>to let him sit yeah yeah yeah that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing is so I&rsquo;m not as big a</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not such a draw that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like coming to me begging me to let everybody stand</p>
<p>right you know I&rsquo;ve been on comedians</p>
<p>of comedy tours with with Pat and Oswalt where</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>standing and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing how much they&rsquo;ll put up with like</p>
<p>David Cross the</p>
<p>standing shows all the time</p>
<p>and his shows go on forever and his bands come out and</p>
<p>that crowd is okay with it but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think my crowd I</p>
<p>think stoners</p>
<p>would rather sit down</p>
<p>I mean I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fine and okay with it I</p>
<p>mean if there was</p>
<p>only an opportunity to go see a</p>
<p>great comic you</p>
<p>know even if I wasn&rsquo;t even doing</p>
<p>stand up it was</p>
<p>Chappelle or something like that I</p>
<p>would stand I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>stand for 2</p>
<p>hours I mean how</p>
<p>often does this guy come to town</p>
<p>once a year</p>
<p>shit I can stand for 2</p>
<p>hours for once a year but it&rsquo;s not the best feeling</p>
<p>the best way is to</p>
<p>sit down and chill</p>
<p>you sit down and</p>
<p>chill then you</p>
<p>could really</p>
<p>enjoy the jokes when you&rsquo;re sitting down relaxing</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s more fun</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the worst is when they have couches in a comedy</p>
<p>club yeah like oh here&rsquo;s the VIP seats and it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>couch in the back where they</p>
<p>not only can get loud but they also</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>their lounging around it&rsquo;s not the right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>right posture to</p>
<p>watch comedy</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re like I like</p>
<p>stoned or something yeah you were totally</p>
<p>right I like it when</p>
<p>the seats are</p>
<p>fixed fixed seats into</p>
<p>the so they can&rsquo;t even move them like at the</p>
<p>Commie Works in Denver</p>
<p>I was just gonna say that</p>
<p>that place is</p>
<p>crazy they got</p>
<p>those little tiny trays that are</p>
<p>smaller than a square</p>
<p>desk or an airline tray and</p>
<p>they just put</p>
<p>their nachos and</p>
<p>their drinks on it and</p>
<p>the people are in there so tight</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s underground it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>that place is almost perfect the only</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>about it is just the</p>
<p>you know it gets a little rowdy sometimes it gets rowdy</p>
<p>the crowd noise is like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a win when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>cheering for you and applauding</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s so loud</p>
<p>but then when they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>amongst themselves when they&rsquo;re like you know losing</p>
<p>focus that&rsquo;s really loud too</p>
<p>Denver is pretty</p>
<p>they get wild man yeah</p>
<p>Colorado people get wild yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of wild cowboy</p>
<p>in Colorado</p>
<p>and I think</p>
<p>the alcohol and the weed both</p>
<p>hit you harder because of the altitude</p>
<p>fuck yeah it does you&rsquo;re a mile up in the air man</p>
<p>you ever tried working out up there</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>tried doing a lot of</p>
<p>things there that I you know regret</p>
<p>it I went to amusement park there one day oh my God and</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s just like it was fun but</p>
<p>you know much more exhausting than</p>
<p>going to amusement park should be</p>
<p>yeah I can only imagine</p>
<p>yeah walking up hills is</p>
<p>tough up there I went hiking once</p>
<p>and it was like a full on workout like I was breathing</p>
<p>heavy and sweating it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this is crazy</p>
<p>this is not</p>
<p>where you want the mountain line to catch you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll heave in and out of breath and shit</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even make it up the hill</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way Joe Rogan</p>
<p>thinks that there</p>
<p>might be a mountain lion well my dog got</p>
<p>eaten by a mountain lion oh God</p>
<p>when I lived in</p>
<p>Colorado my dog got</p>
<p>eaten by a mountain</p>
<p>lion oh crap</p>
<p>yeah we saw the mountain lion</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve hid weed in Colorado</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve hidden it yeah at a comedy club</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>waiting for the day to go back to this comedy club to</p>
<p>see if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still there</p>
<p>wow kind of like</p>
<p>me and Ari were talking</p>
<p>about the other day we</p>
<p>started hiding weed at</p>
<p>comedy club instead of</p>
<p>throwing it away and</p>
<p>stuff does weed ever go bad that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smart no it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t I mean it loses its potency</p>
<p>a little bit but you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about 6 months to a year it&rsquo;s fine it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be dry and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna hit you harder you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get stoned</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>Joey likes drying his weed out he takes his weeds out</p>
<p>like a radiator me too</p>
<p>try that shit out cocksucker</p>
<p>I used to keep it in the freezer</p>
<p>really yeah I used to</p>
<p>it gets moisture</p>
<p>in it that way I like it dry I like it to burn</p>
<p>and make it look good</p>
<p>supposedly you put anything in a</p>
<p>freezer it lasts longer be</p>
<p>it like batteries</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m asking</p>
<p>you that but meanwhile I put my coffee in the</p>
<p>freezer I don&rsquo;t know why I do that yeah exactly</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a weird parents did it</p>
<p>right I just</p>
<p>really did it</p>
<p>because people</p>
<p>suggested it or somebody said it somewhere</p>
<p>and then after a</p>
<p>while I was like why am I doing this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>through this weed fast enough that I don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>I freeze it for another generation</p>
<p>this edible</p>
<p>thing taught me a lesson</p>
<p>man I will not eat anybody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shit and then go on</p>
<p>stage it was a dude that I had known</p>
<p>and I he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those professionals nobody can ever know though</p>
<p>yeah but you buy a nice</p>
<p>story buying</p>
<p>it from somebody you don&rsquo;t know oh no totally</p>
<p>no you&rsquo;re totally true</p>
<p>everybody to me is always like just eat</p>
<p>half of this and</p>
<p>every time I take them up on it it&rsquo;s either much</p>
<p>stronger than that implied or weaker than that implied</p>
<p>like people are</p>
<p>never really that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I like</p>
<p>about smoking is</p>
<p>the people behind the</p>
<p>counter and the dispensary</p>
<p>can give you a little bit more specific guidance</p>
<p>than you can&rsquo;t with</p>
<p>edibles it&rsquo;s always just like yeah</p>
<p>dude so you won&rsquo;t in</p>
<p>about an hour some of</p>
<p>these assholes put too much in</p>
<p>they need to get Amazon rates you</p>
<p>bet you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>you know they need Amazon reviews</p>
<p>every time you take a</p>
<p>you know purple</p>
<p>erect from this store</p>
<p>this is what happened this is how much it took well you</p>
<p>know you know and there was a job in</p>
<p>Colorado one of the</p>
<p>local newspapers to be</p>
<p>a marijuana critic</p>
<p>right and I got the job I signed up for it</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>like are you serious I&rsquo;m like fuck yeah I want to</p>
<p>write it was</p>
<p>right before we had to move</p>
<p>but when I was there</p>
<p>I was gonna go to different weed</p>
<p>stores and and</p>
<p>grade them like</p>
<p>somebody else</p>
<p>is doing that now they</p>
<p>should like I think</p>
<p>they gave that job to somebody yeah I remember reading</p>
<p>about it somewhere that</p>
<p>that yeah that&rsquo;s something they wanted to do</p>
<p>you know I read it on some like</p>
<p>Celeb Stone</p>
<p>or something some website</p>
<p>was was talking about it</p>
<p>I thought of</p>
<p>earlier when you mentioned Doug Stanhope</p>
<p>it was funny a couple days ago</p>
<p>I worked at a club and the guy</p>
<p>wrote me a check and I went home I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really look at it and I went home and the next morning</p>
<p>I looked at it and he&rsquo;d written the</p>
<p>check out to Doug Stanhove</p>
<p>like it was late and he was</p>
<p>tired and Doug plays that club too so it was</p>
<p>funny that he wow</p>
<p>wrote down the wrong name</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like degenerate number 2</p>
<p>have you ever</p>
<p>gotten no you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never gotten a</p>
<p>check that says Joe Piscopo on</p>
<p>no Tony dam&rsquo;s a junior</p>
<p>I sign credit card well that&rsquo;s just a flat</p>
<p>kit and stuff</p>
<p>like that like anytime I sign</p>
<p>a credit card or any kind of credit card slip I always</p>
<p>write something like</p>
<p>tacos let me ask</p>
<p>you this why such a</p>
<p>are you free to change the way you sign</p>
<p>your shift yes</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say that your tea is not a B</p>
<p>No but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a person that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m saying like say if you have a signature</p>
<p>right your signature</p>
<p>is supposed to represent how you</p>
<p>write it your own</p>
<p>very unique way of doing it</p>
<p>right is it</p>
<p>can you just decide</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it that way now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do this with a star in the middle of it and well</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just helping them out because then you could get</p>
<p>every letter of</p>
<p>the alphabet so they know exactly what your handwriting</p>
<p>style looks like</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>signature you</p>
<p>still writing the same word every time</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>could you just</p>
<p>totally change it up yeah that&rsquo;s what I do</p>
<p>every time I change my</p>
<p>sign a credit card</p>
<p>I do Brad Pitt or I hate tacos so what&rsquo;s the point if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re totally</p>
<p>changing it</p>
<p>up and if that&rsquo;s cool if you&rsquo;re allowed to do that</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the point in having a signature then</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>have to say did you sign this is it&rsquo;s your signature</p>
<p>go yes I did sign that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it but you know</p>
<p>then they say</p>
<p>what about the one where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re signing that</p>
<p>screen thingy isn&rsquo;t that kind of at</p>
<p>least capturing the image and</p>
<p>checking to see if it matches how you know no no</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s just writing</p>
<p>it just printing it on</p>
<p>it so you could just on</p>
<p>those things you could just</p>
<p>yeah you could</p>
<p>type stars in anything well when I was a kid I</p>
<p>could imitate Gene Simmons signature</p>
<p>I could imitate</p>
<p>Ace Freelies because I had</p>
<p>copied over</p>
<p>their signatures</p>
<p>I was like a huge Kiss fan</p>
<p>and someone</p>
<p>could do that with you easy</p>
<p>especially in</p>
<p>those little</p>
<p>stupid things at the credit card</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re signing your name but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look like how you write your</p>
<p>name it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>close and who cares</p>
<p>you know how I</p>
<p>learned it because</p>
<p>I used to date</p>
<p>type her name in</p>
<p>like cursive</p>
<p>letters and</p>
<p>it took fucking like an</p>
<p>extra minute</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it you&rsquo;re not doing this anymore this drives me</p>
<p>crazy this is an extra</p>
<p>minute at the cash register</p>
<p>so I go I just</p>
<p>started signing it for her</p>
<p>and I started saying like farts and fuck</p>
<p>face and talk</p>
<p>I usually just do tacos and</p>
<p>stuff off with</p>
<p>interesting obsessions they got the new taco shaped</p>
<p>Brad Pitt flashlight if you&rsquo;d like to try it yep</p>
<p>that reminded me of</p>
<p>something though oh what</p>
<p>I do is I have a signature that I sign for stuff with</p>
<p>and then when people ask me to sign</p>
<p>stuff I just</p>
<p>print my name</p>
<p>oh but I always</p>
<p>try to say something nice to them so it&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>least personalized</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not really getting my</p>
<p>signature they&rsquo;re just getting my name written out hmm</p>
<p>that church</p>
<p>how do you use</p>
<p>paranoid about this</p>
<p>whole identity</p>
<p>theft so you won&rsquo;t sign</p>
<p>things because of that yeah</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>I mean why let someone</p>
<p>like a Gene Simmons</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want somebody to be able to do a</p>
<p>great job with his</p>
<p>signature I</p>
<p>would imagine</p>
<p>yeah well you know you should</p>
<p>definitely be paranoid</p>
<p>about identity</p>
<p>theft when it comes to credit cards but I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think you should worry</p>
<p>about your signature it&rsquo;s too easy to duplicate just</p>
<p>carry around a stamp</p>
<p>I mean you&rsquo;d have to I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I mean</p>
<p>who has the kind of</p>
<p>technology is it</p>
<p>also you can&rsquo;t read my</p>
<p>signature and I</p>
<p>think when you signing</p>
<p>something for somebody when they show it to people</p>
<p>right you know if it has your name on it that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing but if you&rsquo;re just signing</p>
<p>anything then</p>
<p>when somebody looks at it I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s nice to go oh</p>
<p>Doug Benson</p>
<p>wrote that my signature you can&rsquo;t read I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that it is handwriting I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re that good at that at recognizing</p>
<p>you know shit I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>I think you</p>
<p>could imitate it</p>
<p>you could figure out how to</p>
<p>write so many signature</p>
<p>and you could probably pull it off</p>
<p>close enough</p>
<p>yeah you just</p>
<p>have to find it somewhere so you just have</p>
<p>to watch their</p>
<p>motion if you</p>
<p>watch them if you film them do it</p>
<p>you saw like how they do it</p>
<p>he could just imitate it well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where my paranoia sets in is when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the ATM</p>
<p>the beeping</p>
<p>noises that the</p>
<p>numbers make that takes the privacy out of the number</p>
<p>someone was just</p>
<p>watching the site and recording it right</p>
<p>they could figure out the numbers easy and then like</p>
<p>you know Jack you up</p>
<p>around the corner and then use your card and take out</p>
<p>whatever the maximum is</p>
<p>what did you see the new</p>
<p>thing there&rsquo;s a new app for</p>
<p>Chase Bank that you</p>
<p>could actually scan a check</p>
<p>front and back and</p>
<p>with your iPhone and send it and it deposits the</p>
<p>check and then you just rip up the check</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too easy</p>
<p>what about the</p>
<p>using your iPhone to</p>
<p>check in on a</p>
<p>plane like the barcode</p>
<p>ticket can be on your</p>
<p>iPhone and I just run that yeah my fear is you know</p>
<p>your iphone&rsquo;s dead then you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>ticket yeah</p>
<p>and your iPhones die man</p>
<p>especially if you fuck around</p>
<p>the new one dies so fast</p>
<p>you know you make a</p>
<p>video and it&rsquo;s your powers half gone yeah</p>
<p>yeah you got to think</p>
<p>about that if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using the camera for sure</p>
<p>but it came it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>great thing to have a good camera the</p>
<p>other day we were in San Francisco we</p>
<p>ate some Chinese food</p>
<p>after the show</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>2 o&rsquo;clock in</p>
<p>the morning we&rsquo;re outside and this I saw it I</p>
<p>watched the</p>
<p>whole truck you</p>
<p>tweeted it I watched it</p>
<p>and I was like he must be so high</p>
<p>cause you kept saying is the craziest shit you ever saw</p>
<p>and I know you&rsquo;re at UOC</p>
<p>fights every</p>
<p>other week so</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve seen some crazier shit than a bunch of</p>
<p>strippers in the back of a</p>
<p>some sort of</p>
<p>weird plastic</p>
<p>car I probably have seen some crazier shit</p>
<p>definitely but it was</p>
<p>crazy and I was so high yeah yeah I</p>
<p>was like it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t believe it and now to be able to just</p>
<p>share it with everybody</p>
<p>you were like double rainbow but</p>
<p>with the fucking</p>
<p>van full of strippers</p>
<p>you were so excited</p>
<p>about it it was so</p>
<p>ridiculous to me it was such a sign of the time</p>
<p>to me it was like a</p>
<p>scene in a movie</p>
<p>right before the meteor hit</p>
<p>right before the</p>
<p>aliens landed</p>
<p>and somebody audio tune</p>
<p>that joe&rsquo;s video</p>
<p>audio tune joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>video there&rsquo;s this big oh yes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this big</p>
<p>clear box that pulls up</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s girls dancing it&rsquo;s a fish tank of skanks</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re dancing</p>
<p>I mean it was the most</p>
<p>ridiculous thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life it&rsquo;s for the Hustler Club</p>
<p>we had a rewind the</p>
<p>video to find out but the cop</p>
<p>pulled them</p>
<p>over because they</p>
<p>should be sitting</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s in motion</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be dancing</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re driving</p>
<p>but they just</p>
<p>did like a quick</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t really like</p>
<p>because that was what</p>
<p>I was waiting for is like them having to get out and</p>
<p>get cuffed we</p>
<p>thought that</p>
<p>might have happened we thought they</p>
<p>might be going to jail like</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s illegal to do that because it seems so</p>
<p>ridiculous but</p>
<p>apparently it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>one of the things that was</p>
<p>funny is when we&rsquo;re filming the girl and I didn&rsquo;t film</p>
<p>their faces I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I did specifically</p>
<p>did it say it</p>
<p>was already in</p>
<p>a plastic car I know</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>put it online you don&rsquo;t need to see your face online</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>stripping for a week</p>
<p>that shit&rsquo;s on the Internet forever so I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>use their face</p>
<p>but anyway while I&rsquo;m filming it</p>
<p>the girl goes no filming</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re in the club like</p>
<p>bitch you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>front of a Chinese restaurant</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re not at the club</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>the club and I&rsquo;m filming you yeah that&rsquo;s a dick move</p>
<p>but you just can&rsquo;t come out into the real</p>
<p>world in your underwear</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t take a</p>
<p>picture of that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>the sexy top and the you know keep your eyes up here</p>
<p>mister it&rsquo;s like well come on</p>
<p>Jesus Christ I know you know what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>right you know how</p>
<p>the game works yeah they only want you to look if they</p>
<p>want you to look but you know it&rsquo;s there for everybody</p>
<p>my eyes are here</p>
<p>god damn it yeah let&rsquo;s do this here I</p>
<p>wonder if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a pope mobile for</p>
<p>strippers and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want us to look at you it&rsquo;s awesome though</p>
<p>it was awesome it was just like such a such of</p>
<p>just 1/1 of all just a perfect representation of</p>
<p>how nutty San Francisco is I wonder</p>
<p>if that just</p>
<p>goes such a nutty day but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just that yeah that like probably no one will complain</p>
<p>about that no one no</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure some kids saw it</p>
<p>oh a lot it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>liberal there so open minded it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird town man</p>
<p>I wonder if that law with</p>
<p>sitting down</p>
<p>while you turning the corner</p>
<p>if it came from the back in the old days</p>
<p>where it was like a pickup</p>
<p>truck and girls</p>
<p>would just fly off the side</p>
<p>well no I think you have</p>
<p>to have your seatbelt on</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re in a car you have to wear a seatbelt</p>
<p>right I mean that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot if you get pulled over for something else I</p>
<p>think I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>they can just</p>
<p>pull you over</p>
<p>no they can</p>
<p>pull you up for</p>
<p>seatbelt oh</p>
<p>I had no idea I thought it was an add on charge no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>I was in a cab in San Francisco and the crusty</p>
<p>older lady cab driver told me</p>
<p>she goes If you ever want to</p>
<p>drive around without a seat belt on because</p>
<p>she goes I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like how seat belts feel I don&rsquo;t like to have it on</p>
<p>especially if you got big</p>
<p>boobs it must be an</p>
<p>annoying thing</p>
<p>so she fastens it behind her back</p>
<p>so that it is</p>
<p>so that because because</p>
<p>the what the cops look for is the glint of the buckle</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t got</p>
<p>it pulled down you have you don&rsquo;t have the buckle</p>
<p>so they see that and then they</p>
<p>put they can pull you over for that and then get you up</p>
<p>for other shit pull you over</p>
<p>dude yeah they got</p>
<p>you over for that and then they go</p>
<p>we thought you had your seatbelt off and then they can</p>
<p>you know oh we</p>
<p>smell marijuana or whatever if you get</p>
<p>pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt you&rsquo;re a douche</p>
<p>any cop just pulls you home just</p>
<p>gonna pull this person over for</p>
<p>I like wearing it to be honest with you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been pulled over for that I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>a guy tell me to do it really</p>
<p>and he said he said you</p>
<p>would drive away</p>
