    <p>Our card today is Darlene Hulse, the Four of Hearts from Indiana.</p>
<p>In 1984, mother of three Darlene was brutally attacked in her own home.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 years later, her daughters are still seeking answers,</p>
<p>and there are still new details to uncover.</p>
<p>So, we took our normal reporting one step further.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see what I mean.</p>
<p>A little over two years ago, I came across an old news article.</p>
<p>It was about an old unsolved murder that I had never heard of</p>
<p>in a tiny Indiana town that I had only ever passed on my way to somewhere else.</p>
<p>When I reached out to the victim&rsquo;s daughter on Facebook,</p>
<p>I had no idea that I would spend the next two years of my life</p>
<p>living and breathing this case,</p>
<p>dumping every resource I had into solving it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s precisely what happened.</p>
<p>I pulled in one of our reporters, Emily, and basically made this her full-time job.</p>
<p>But even in the early days, I didn&rsquo;t know what this was.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t set out to make a whole series about this case.</p>
<p>But the more we dug in, the more secrets we uncovered.</p>
<p>And the more secrets we uncovered, the more holy shit moments we had.</p>
<p>Because not only does this 38-year-old cold case</p>
<p>have what it needs to get solved literally tomorrow,</p>
<p>but the person responsible may have been hiding in plain sight all along.</p>
<p>Over the course of this series, I&rsquo;m going to take you along</p>
<p>as we hit the backroads of Argus, Indiana, looking for evil truths,</p>
<p>the kind that you never expect to find in small Midwestern towns.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll take you along as we uncover facts</p>
<p>that have never been reported until now.</p>
<p>This is the untold story of Darlene Hulse, the Four of Hearts from Indiana.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck Investigates.</p>
<p>This is Episode 1, Take a Bath.</p>
<p>On August 17th, 1984, in a small, middle-of-nowhere Indiana town called Argus,</p>
<p>eight-year-old Marie Hulse was found dead in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Her body was found on the floor of her apartment,</p>
<p>and her body was found on the floor of her bedroom.</p>
<p>On August 17th, 1984, in a small, middle-of-nowhere Indiana town called Argus,</p>
<p>eight-year-old Marie Hulse was at home with her mom and two little sisters.</p>
<p>It was a Friday morning at the tail end of their summer break,</p>
<p>and since Dad was at work, Marie and her six-year-old sister Melissa</p>
<p>were going to have to tag along to their baby sister&rsquo;s doctor&rsquo;s appointment</p>
<p>in the nearby town of Plymouth.</p>
<p>Their mom, Darlene, told them to take a quick bath</p>
<p>and get washed up before they left,</p>
<p>The two girls were waist-deep in water</p>
<p>when all of a sudden there was a knock at the front door.</p>
<p>Marie thought she heard their mom say something like</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t expecting a package or delivery or she didn&rsquo;t order anything.</p>
<p>They tried to listen closer for more, but there weren&rsquo;t words.</p>
<p>Instead, there was weird noises coming from the front room of the house.</p>
<p>It was a sound Marie has never forgotten.</p>
<p>He was grunting and growling. I thought it was a puppy.</p>
<p>I thought my parents had literally got us a puppy.</p>
<p>I told Melissa that in the tub. I was like, do you hear that? It&rsquo;s a dog.</p>
<p>And it was like growling and grunting.</p>
<p>Marie hopped out of the tub and she was so excited about the idea of a new puppy</p>
<p>that she didn&rsquo;t even stop to dry off or put on clothes before running down the hallway.</p>
<p>Their dad Ron had surprised them before with a new dog,</p>
<p>so this idea wasn&rsquo;t out of left field.</p>
<p>In fact, that exact week, their dog Ling was at a breeder&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>for a consultation about puppy making.</p>
<p>The Holses lived in a long one-story ranch-style house,</p>
<p>so when Marie got out of the tub,</p>
<p>she ran down the hallway toward the den where the front door was.</p>
<p>But when she rounded the corner, she froze.</p>
<p>Because there was no puppy.</p>
<p>Just a man pushing her mom down on the floor.</p>
<p>He was on his knees straddling her mom Darlene,</p>
<p>trying to put duct tape over her eyes and mouth.</p>
<p>In that moment, at eight years old, Marie didn&rsquo;t know what was going on.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t know this man and he wasn&rsquo;t saying anything.</p>
<p>He just continued grunting and growling.</p>
<p>Her baby sister, who was last in her mother&rsquo;s arms, was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Through all the confusion, she knew something was wrong.</p>
<p>My mom was yelling, you know, don&rsquo;t hurt my babies,</p>
<p>or something to that effect.</p>
<p>She was, I mean, screaming.</p>
<p>She was, you know, she was flailing.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m talking like, I know she scratched him,</p>
<p>I know that she got pieces of him,</p>
<p>and he was dragging her by her hair.</p>
<p>Completely terrified, little Marie started screaming</p>
<p>and she ran towards the kitchen phone.</p>
<p>This was 1984, so not only was there no 911 system yet</p>
<p>in Marshall County, Indiana, the Holses had a rotary phone.</p>
<p>But Marie knew she needed to call for help,</p>
<p>so she started that slow circle dial of one of the only phone numbers</p>
<p>she had memorized, her Aunt Nancy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He was already coming around the corner.</p>
<p>But I did get through, I got a busy signal.</p>
<p>As the busy tone beeped in her ear, Marie looked up,</p>
<p>just as the man came around the corner,</p>
<p>dragging her mom by the hair behind him.</p>
<p>I just remember him coming towards me and ripping the phone out,</p>
<p>and me thinking, he&rsquo;s going to get me now, he&rsquo;s going to get me.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s when she said to run, run.</p>
<p>But it was so jarbled, you know, it was just chaos.</p>
<p>And he never spoke a word.</p>
<p>I do remember that, he never spoke.</p>
<p>In that moment, she got a really good look at the guy.</p>
<p>He was skinny, but not scrawny, and clean cut,</p>
<p>with blondish two-toned hair combed over to one side.</p>
<p>The guy was wearing normal clothes, like a brown shirt with stripes</p>
<p>and tan-colored pants and brown shoes.</p>
<p>Marie remembers in that moment thinking that this guy</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t look like a super scary person,</p>
<p>but because he was hurting her mom, he must have been a bad guy.</p>
<p>Just when he tried to grab Marie, Darlene screamed for Marie to run.</p>
<p>I remember her saying, don&rsquo;t hurt my babies.</p>
<p>And she was screaming, blood-curdling screams while she was fighting.</p>
<p>So there were grunts, and it was just like surreal.</p>
<p>It was completely surreal.</p>
<p>By that point, Marie knew they were in serious danger,</p>
<p>and she had to get her sister before running for help.</p>
<p>Now this all went down in just a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>So six-year-old Melissa was just getting out of the bathtub</p>
<p>when she heard Marie come back down the hallway.</p>
<p>But instead of announcing or introducing a new puppy, Marie was frantic.</p>
<p>She came back, and she was like, no, get out now, get out now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one that told me something wasn&rsquo;t right, and I had to leave.</p>
<p>After alerting her sister, Marie took off back down the hallway</p>
<p>and ran through the kitchen and out the back door that led outside.</p>
<p>And Melissa, not knowing what was the matter, ran toward the front door.</p>
<p>When she rounded the corner, she saw the man pinning her mom down on the carpet,</p>
<p>and he was hovered over Darlene in a way that put his back towards Melissa.</p>
<p>But Darlene started screaming at Melissa to get out,</p>
<p>and the man turned around and spotted her.</p>
<p>I just remember him looking at me as I ran out the door,</p>
<p>like never lunged for me, never nothing.</p>
<p>But he was on his knees.</p>
<p>So when I first looked down the hall,</p>
<p>I want to say I saw just the top of his head.</p>
<p>And then when I came out, then he looked up.</p>
<p>The man didn&rsquo;t say anything to Melissa either.</p>
<p>She remembered his face being totally expressionless.</p>
<p>The only one speaking any words was Darlene.</p>
<p>She just kept saying, Melissa, get out.</p>
<p>And then just let the children go. That&rsquo;s all she said.</p>
<p>Still completely naked and soaking wet,</p>
<p>the girls ran from their house to the dirt and gravel road,</p>
<p>passing a car that they didn&rsquo;t recognize parked in their driveway.</p>
<p>I remember turning around and looking at the car.</p>
<p>I looked at it because I was looking to see if Melissa was following me or the guy.</p>
<p>I remember turning around, looking, thinking, is he going to follow me?</p>
<p>So I did. I remember looking at it.</p>
<p>It was a huge clunker of a car, dirty and green with rust all across the bottom.</p>
<p>And it was pulled right up into the driveway.</p>
<p>Marie noticed that it had big round taillights and a big, long body with a big trunk.</p>
<p>And she remembers thinking that it looked old.</p>
<p>Like, you know how in the mid-80s cars were pretty boxy,</p>
<p>but their bodies were smaller than cars that were made in the 70s</p>
<p>that were basically just massive boats on wheels?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what Marie saw, a massive, rusty, ugly boat of a car that was chalky green.</p>
<p>Like, not just in color, but the paint job itself was bad.</p>
<p>To Marie&rsquo;s relief, as she was running and looking back at the car,</p>
<p>she spotted her sister coming out the front door.</p>
<p>I do remember seeing Melissa run behind me.</p>
<p>I saw her, and I thought, I&rsquo;m going to get there faster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to get there faster.</p>
<p>And Melissa was screaming, crying, but I could see her.</p>
<p>And see, we weren&rsquo;t allowed to cross the road.</p>
<p>And I do remember thinking, I don&rsquo;t have any clothes on, and this is not even hurting my feet.</p>
<p>I had a—because I always tried to walk without shoes or whatever.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking, this isn&rsquo;t even hurting.</p>
<p>I can run faster than I&rsquo;ve ever ran before.</p>
<p>I remember thinking that.</p>
<p>They had turned right out of the house, running down the road toward the next crossing,</p>
<p>which was this busy highway.</p>
<p>They were headed to their grandparents&rsquo; house, who lived just on the other side.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re eight and six.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten spanked before for going across the road.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking, I&rsquo;m going to get in trouble. Nope, I&rsquo;ve got to go.</p>
<p>And I just took off across the road.</p>
<p>They knew that&rsquo;s where they needed to go for help.</p>
<p>Marie says that as she&rsquo;s running to her grandparents, she felt like she was flying.</p>
<p>We were fast as lightning, okay?</p>
<p>And, you know, the distance between there does not take but just, like, two, three minutes if you&rsquo;re running fast.</p>
<p>Marie got to her grandparents&rsquo; house first,</p>
<p>and relief flooded her when she spotted her grandma Doris.</p>
<p>Grandma was in the window.</p>
<p>They have, like, those wind chimes because they didn&rsquo;t have air.</p>
<p>And I remember the wind chimes, and she was standing at the sink.</p>
<p>And I said, someone&rsquo;s hurting, Mom. You need to call.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, what? She didn&rsquo;t even—I was talking too fast.</p>
<p>And she just couldn&rsquo;t—she couldn&rsquo;t understand. I was like, someone has Mom.</p>
<p>And she just couldn&rsquo;t process what I was saying.</p>
<p>I was like, call the police.</p>
<p>She goes, I don&rsquo;t understand. I was like, call the police.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Melissa had almost caught up to Marie.</p>
<p>But when she got to the edge of Highway 31, there was a car coming, so she had to stop and let them pass.</p>
<p>And I wonder about this person a lot, if they&rsquo;re still out there.</p>
<p>If they even knew what they saw that day.</p>
<p>A six-year-old girl, wet, naked, crying, barefoot, standing on a dirt road at the edge of a highway.</p>
<p>Would things have been different if they would have stopped?</p>
<p>Would we still be asking the questions that we are today?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unless they come forward, we may never know.</p>
<p>That car went by, and Melissa darted across the highway to meet Marie and her grandma,</p>
<p>just as Doris was dialing the number for the Marshall County Police Department.</p>
<p>Doris relayed to police what her granddaughters told her.</p>
<p>And the police dispatched the closest unit to get to the Holsholm as soon as possible for an armed robbery in progress.</p>
<p>Doris stayed on the phone with them while Marie and Melissa propped themselves in their grandparents&rsquo; front window</p>
<p>to watch for police to go save their mother.</p>
<p>And then I remember her being on the phone with the police, and because it was a dirt road,</p>
<p>we heard the police cars come, and we were watching out the window,</p>
<p>and they went past the road, and she went nuts.</p>
<p>I do remember that. She&rsquo;s like, no, and she&rsquo;s on the phone, she&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;ve missed it, you&rsquo;ve missed it.</p>
<p>Go back, you&rsquo;ve just passed the road.</p>
<p>Then do you remember seeing them come, like circle back and go back down the correct road?</p>
<p>I do, but then my grandmother pulled me away from the window.</p>
<p>Do you think she was coming to the realization of what was happening, or how serious it was?</p>
<p>She asked me where Kristen was, and I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I got really scared that I was in trouble, because I didn&rsquo;t know where you were.</p>
<p>I just remember the primary concern is, where is Kristen?</p>
<p>And then I think Melissa knew more about that because she was the last one to run out.</p>
<p>Kristen, who is almost in her 40s today, doesn&rsquo;t remember anything about that day because she was still in diapers.</p>
<p>But her sisters have struggled with the fact that they couldn&rsquo;t find her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget one time Melissa said the one thing that she regrets was not getting me,</p>
<p>not grabbing me when we were all running out.</p>
<p>With Darlene and baby Kristen at the house with a crazed man, Doris didn&rsquo;t know what to think.</p>
<p>She knew something was wrong based on what her granddaughters were able to relay through sobs,</p>
<p>but she couldn&rsquo;t have known the horror that awaited.</p>
<p>Marie was hopeful that she had run so damn fast that her mom and baby sister would be okay.</p>
<p>I mean, it happened so fast.</p>
<p>And so all of a sudden just a million people were at my grandparents&rsquo; house.</p>
<p>And cops were there.</p>
<p>And I just remember them saying,</p>
<p>The baby&rsquo;s been found, but the mom is not there.</p>
