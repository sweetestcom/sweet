<p>for four days with</p>
<p>eddie with your</p>
<p>teacher eddie</p>
<p>bob yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rick schroeder&rsquo;s</p>
<p>learning how</p>
<p>to strangle</p>
<p>bitch have you had that ringworm yet how</p>
<p>about that definitely</p>
<p>tell him yeah</p>
<p>listen i got some soap for you i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna give it to you before we</p>
<p>leave i wanted</p>
<p>to have it out for the podcast but i forgot</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>defense soap</p>
<p>and you can go to defense soap com</p>
<p>i have no affiliation with them</p>
<p>the guy who owns it guy sakos just this really cool guy</p>
<p>who made this</p>
<p>great product</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about keeping your skin healthy</p>
<p>when you do</p>
<p>jiu jitsu because when you do</p>
<p>jiu jitsu you&rsquo;re getting scratched</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re rolling around there&rsquo;s a lot of abrasions</p>
<p>all over your body</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t wash with like a good healthy soap</p>
<p>you can have like you get infections you</p>
<p>have like ringworm</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s fucking really annoying</p>
<p>you have to find out like from</p>
<p>other people that do jujitsu</p>
<p>like my friend already had a</p>
<p>staph infection on his knee and his knee had swollen up</p>
<p>we were playing pool</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s walking around the pool</p>
<p>table with this like weird limp</p>
<p>so i go what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on man</p>
<p>and he goes i got a spider bite</p>
<p>and i go oh shit let me see it</p>
<p>so he pulls his</p>
<p>pants up i go dude that&rsquo;s a staph infection well</p>
<p>he thought it was a spider bite because it was this big</p>
<p>pus filled red mark it looked like he had gotten poison</p>
<p>with something he looked like there was like you know</p>
<p>venom in there or something</p>
<p>so if i hadn&rsquo;t noticed that it probably</p>
<p>could have got</p>
<p>systemic and he</p>
<p>would have had to have been in the hospital with iv and</p>
<p>intravenous</p>
<p>antibiotics it&rsquo;s really really dangerous</p>
<p>stuff what&rsquo;s the ringworm</p>
<p>thing is that</p>
<p>not real it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the funniest</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing as athlete&rsquo;s foot it&rsquo;s really the same</p>
<p>exact fungus it&rsquo;s just different parts of your body</p>
<p>and what ringworm is it&rsquo;s like it grows and</p>
<p>it looks like a ring</p>
<p>you know when it</p>
<p>starts to infect</p>
<p>you like a big circle on your body</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how you crop circle your skin</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s usually in circles yeah there&rsquo;s some gnarly</p>
<p>dudes at the gym</p>
<p>that you really i mean</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna</p>
<p>sweaty guys on top of you</p>
<p>it was weird to get</p>
<p>it was weird at first</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird as fuck man i do</p>
<p>but i do it i</p>
<p>think of it</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think of it really as a dude you</p>
<p>think of it as like a problem you</p>
<p>think of it as</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this thing that&rsquo;s moving around that i have to dissect</p>
<p>you know i have to dissect this guy</p>

<p>you got tapped by your own son though that&rsquo;s sad</p>
<p>really i could</p>
<p>come on could have got him i</p>
<p>could have got him all</p>
<p>right should have</p>
<p>got him then</p>
<p>i did next time i will tell you something</p>
<p>you have kids you can&rsquo;t let them tap you</p>
<p>my other son though</p>
<p>my 18 year old son holden</p>
<p>he actually did get me</p>
<p>well holden seems like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a big strong strapping fella</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>starting to come into that</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>really into it you know when i talked to him</p>
<p>about jujitsu</p>
<p>i was like dude you</p>
<p>would love it</p>
<p>he would love it and</p>
<p>he needs that gym in salt lake yeah</p>
<p>jeremy horne has a gym in salt lake he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going there for college</p>
<p>right yeah he just went there last week</p>
<p>he needs to go well</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get him set up with jeremy because jeremy&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>a killer gem and jeremy&rsquo;s like a really good</p>
<p>coach he&rsquo;s one of the best guys you could ever</p>
<p>learn from because</p>
<p>jeremy has always been</p>
<p>not like a physically talented guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not like a natural athlete not like</p>
<p>super strong or explosive</p>
<p>just really</p>
<p>smart and really technical</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>been like he&rsquo;s always been real clever on the ground so</p>
<p>just a great guy to learn from</p>
<p>those are the best guys to</p>
<p>learn from the guys are really strong</p>
<p>sometimes they&rsquo;re getting away with like</p>
<p>a lot of it is just through athleticism and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>quite as technical as the guys who are like</p>
<p>naturally not that strong</p>
<p>those are the best guys to</p>
<p>learn from jeremy</p>
<p>horn is one of the nicest guys in the world</p>
<p>cool so he&rsquo;ll love it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be a killer he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come back he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna oh he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>beast already</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna get you he&rsquo;s already a beast so</p>
<p>what did he tap you with</p>
<p>it was an arm it was an arm bar</p>
<p>you got me arm got me arm well</p>
<p>and and luke got me in a region</p>
<p>think about not tapping</p>
<p>yeah but i know my son and i could feel the emote</p>
<p>like the boys and their dads have this thing</p>
<p>like especially when boys turns like 18 19 20</p>
<p>they have to go through this thing where they like</p>
<p>have to push their dads away</p>
<p>like for some reason it&rsquo;s part of the natural</p>
<p>transition into manhood yeah really</p>
<p>yeah and he was going he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going through there now because he&rsquo;s eighteen</p>
<p>and i could tell he wanted to hurt me</p>
<p>so i knew i needed to</p>
<p>i know i needed to just that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy yeah and</p>
<p>i said i tapped and he goes you can&rsquo;t tap</p>
<p>i said no i said hold and i tapped</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like oh</p>
<p>he just wanted to just wow</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t want you to tap you didn&rsquo;t want me</p>
<p>to tap that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous why</p>
<p>would he not want you to tap</p>
<p>if he got you</p>
<p>you want to</p>
<p>break your arm</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he want to</p>
<p>break my arm</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what happens when you don&rsquo;t get to tap</p>
<p>you just want to give me a little more pain</p>
<p>before i tapped out</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>weird man i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how i&rsquo;d handle that i have to beat the fuck out of him</p>
<p>i think i might have to beat the fuck out of him you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lucky of girls nothing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how to deal with that i</p>
<p>might have to</p>
<p>choke that dude</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m mad to be like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna figure some shit out here</p>
<p>you know damn</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to go through that</p>
<p>some fucking</p>
<p>young buck run around your</p>
<p>house was chest puffed out i&rsquo;m not listening to you</p>
<p>uh well you know what you</p>
<p>gotta put the hooks in son i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotta let him listen</p>
<p>another way i gotta get</p>
<p>through him</p>
<p>just squeeze him out</p>
<p>you gotta be able to consistently squeeze them out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s most important</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just squeeze them out</p>
<p>every third time</p>
<p>you gotta be able to squeeze them out</p>
<p>every time you guys grab my goal my goal is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna beat the fuck out i&rsquo;m gonna get eddie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mondays and wednesdays for the next six</p>
<p>months yeah and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna learn some serious technique you can</p>
<p>and he and i are gonna we&rsquo;re gonna go at it again</p>
<p>eventually well this is what you need to do all you</p>
<p>need to do is be consistent</p>
<p>be consistent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most important thing be consistent and</p>
<p>spar a lot and get on some sort of a strength program</p>
<p>get on like</p>
<p>lifting kettlebells are the best</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re really lightweight</p>
<p>you can do it with like a 30 pound kettlebell 35</p>
<p>pound kettlebell you get a</p>
<p>tremendous workout i have one workout that i do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one 35</p>
<p>pound kettlebell you call</p>
<p>it farmer strength yeah you get you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>your whole body</p>
<p>and it just forces you</p>
<p>to use everything</p>
<p>like athletically as opposed to like like just</p>
<p>bench pressing</p>
<p>just isolating your</p>
<p>yeah that stuff</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really enhance your your ability to move things</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when you have</p>
<p>something that you have to control</p>
<p>and you have to balance it</p>
<p>then you develop</p>
<p>a different kind of a strength the strength that</p>
<p>has stability and balance and the strength that the</p>
<p>muscle groups</p>
<p>use and muscles adjust when</p>
<p>things are going</p>
<p>wrong and when you&rsquo;re getting tired</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>you do that you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>choke the fuck out of that kid just what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about get that little</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>shut up you</p>
<p>gotta be able to get them all the time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important man you have to</p>
<p>let him know</p>
<p>that every time you roll</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>choke the fuck out</p>
<p>of him this is a foregone conclusion</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain dudes that</p>
<p>you just own</p>
<p>like when i</p>
<p>first started doing jiu jitsu</p>
<p>there was this</p>
<p>kid who was this purple belt who was really good</p>
<p>and this dude owned me</p>
<p>every time we rolled he owned me it was a foregone</p>
<p>conclusion that i was</p>
<p>gonna tap i sucked i was a</p>
<p>white belt i didn&rsquo;t know what i was doing</p>
<p>and he was a really good purple belt he was</p>
<p>strong as fuck and he used to like</p>
<p>to run through me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he</p>
<p>would like to do just fucking</p>
<p>squash me as</p>
<p>quick as he could</p>
<p>and it was like god damn but</p>
<p>you kept there was an</p>
<p>order yeah well you know</p>
<p>he left and i went to another</p>
<p>school the school that we were at close now</p>
<p>but the important</p>
<p>thing was i knew</p>
<p>every time i roll with that guy</p>
<p>unless i get way way way better</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get way better than i was</p>
<p>that guy was</p>
<p>gonna fuck me up</p>
<p>every time so there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t want to roll with them</p>
<p>cause he owned me</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>you gotta own your kid</p>
<p>own that little</p>
<p>motherfucker this</p>
<p>is what you</p>

<p>great safari with my son</p>
<p>wow fly airplane taking me we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go pig hunting</p>
<p>we just have</p>
<p>to figure out well it&rsquo;s more than pigs actually we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do some</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do a buffalo i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>doing anything i can&rsquo;t eat bison you can eat bison</p>

<p>think like coyotes that kill cats and shit i</p>
<p>could kill a coyote</p>
<p>you know like i&rsquo;ve had cats fuck coyote</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>you know my dog got killed by mountain line in colorado</p>
<p>when are we</p>
<p>going hunting when are you</p>
<p>gonna when do you have time we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna figure it out</p>
<p>right after my book</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m supposed to be done with my book by</p>
<p>october fifteenth</p>
<p>because november will</p>
<p>be time yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be cooler</p>
<p>and we can hunt deer</p>
<p>right we can hunt deer pig deer</p>
<p>dude i like the way deer taste</p>
<p>i want to do</p>
<p>it because i&rsquo;ve been a meat eater my entire life</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve taken</p>
<p>no responsibility for my desire</p>
<p>to consume meat you know i&rsquo;ve not felt any remorse</p>
<p>you know from pulling a</p>
<p>trigger and seeing an animal die i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t made a</p>
<p>connection a real</p>
<p>connection between</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing when you&rsquo;re eating meat</p>
<p>and i think as a person who thinks</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s actually probably important to try out</p>
<p>well you know what very</p>
<p>important you know hunting gathering was our past</p>
<p>you know with some men</p>
<p>especially hunting gathering</p>
<p>and like the further we get away</p>
<p>from that vibe of hunting and gathering and providing</p>
<p>and testing ourselves like that</p>
<p>i think the more out of</p>
<p>touch we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>becoming with who we are</p>
<p>do you know why i</p>
<p>think that is</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>world and technology have</p>
<p>evolved faster than people and i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s certain reward</p>
<p>systems that are set up</p>
<p>in the human mind to</p>
<p>ensure that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna continue to do certain things</p>
<p>like that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna continue to wanna fuck</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>continue to</p>
<p>want to hunt like you get like a response from hunting</p>
<p>i know i do from fishing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never been hunting but i&rsquo;ve been fishing</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some primal</p>
<p>thing about pulling a big fish out of the</p>
<p>water like yeah</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s fucking good</p>
<p>knowing that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna eat this</p>
<p>thing like you just went out into the wild another</p>
<p>world okay floating around in a fucking</p>
<p>ocean and you pulled something out of that world</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna eat it that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna give you life yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>energy that&rsquo;s attached to that like you feel good</p>
<p>about it well you know if the</p>
<p>truth is if hunting gathering societies had succeeded</p>
<p>they were they</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>succeeded because they were placed by mass farm</p>
<p>production societies</p>
<p>will us surplus</p>
<p>changed everything what</p>
<p>changed everything was the ability to stay in one place</p>
<p>people have like this sort of a nomadic</p>
<p>genetic connection there&rsquo;s a guy who lives in alaska</p>
<p>and they chronicled him on you ever see vbs</p>
<p>tv you ever go to that website no</p>
<p>fucking phenomenal website</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a series called the vice</p>
<p>squad or the</p>
<p>vice guide and</p>
<p>they do all kinds of</p>
<p>weird shit like they go to like</p>
<p>africa and they go all over the</p>
<p>world north korea</p>
<p>but one of the</p>
<p>really coolest ones they went to this guy who lives</p>
<p>by himself and his wife in a cabin</p>
<p>out in the middle of nowhere</p>
<p>in alaska yeah i mean he lives around bears and he</p>
<p>all he does all day</p>
<p>is hunt and</p>
<p>bring food back</p>
<p>catch fish and</p>
<p>smoke catch fish bring</p>
<p>it back yeah i don&rsquo;t know what he does for vegetables</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s like you know it&rsquo;s frozen up there i mean</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s eating</p>
<p>fucking pine cones i don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s eating</p>
<p>i mean i know he gets some supplies</p>
<p>dropped to him</p>
<p>yeah this guy</p>
<p>he never saw 9 11</p>
<p>huh he hasn&rsquo;t even seen a</p>
<p>photo of it off the grid these are</p>
<p>guys totally off the grid</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s guys that are doing that out there and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just but he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>so off the grid</p>
<p>and he says</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s extremely</p>
<p>happy and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very articulate</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not like a crazy guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>articulate guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been doing this for a long time and he says that</p>
<p>as man gets further</p>
<p>away from his nature like this hunter gatherer nature</p>
<p>you lose your</p>
<p>connection with the</p>
<p>earth you lose your happiness</p>
<p>and he thought that that&rsquo;s the reason why people</p>
<p>you know like so many people</p>
<p>are depressed and so many people hate what they do</p>
<p>hunter and get hunter and gathering like that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna love that you get it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a visceral response like your genes get it</p>
<p>yeah yeah and it</p>
<p>clears your mind i mean when you&rsquo;re out</p>
<p>trying to provide</p>
<p>food for yourself your family your friends</p>
<p>and if that&rsquo;s really all you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>focused on then it&rsquo;s all this</p>
<p>other stuff and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sort of add up anymore</p>
<p>you know doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>count doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>and so hunting gathering i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>where we came from but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a dying</p>
<p>breed hunting gathering people so do you</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the reasons why society i mean it really does make</p>
<p>sense right that that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the reasons why people in society are so depressed</p>
<p>is that we are living a life like</p>
<p>technology and society</p>
<p>has gotten so far past</p>
<p>where our genetics are</p>
<p>and our genetics</p>
<p>still require some acts</p>
<p>for us to feel good</p>
<p>you know that they have like there&rsquo;s a set in</p>
<p>you know a reward</p>
<p>system in place for doing</p>
<p>things like sex feels good so that you make babies</p>
<p>food feels good so that you keep eating and you survive</p>
<p>yeah all these reward</p>
<p>systems are set up and if you take a few of them out</p>
<p>without correcting the body</p>
<p>yeah like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have like</p>
<p>these holes you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have these problems yeah</p>
<p>these voids are over there and then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re filled with</p>
<p>other things that</p>
<p>are probably not nearly as healthy or good</p>
<p>um is that a fascinating idea though that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it really is like you&rsquo;re looking at evolution</p>
<p>i mean you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at it you can you can tune back into it</p>
<p>like if you</p>
<p>look if you look at like the way it&rsquo;s set up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s set up to make sure</p>
<p>that we do certain</p>
<p>things and if you take</p>
<p>these certain</p>
<p>things away</p>
<p>you the body gets fucked up</p>
<p>like it gets like we there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>things were missing like people don&rsquo;t have sex</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always said this like</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>how religious you are if you&rsquo;re not having sex</p>
<p>you have sexual</p>
<p>organs and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>using like do not</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>experience any pleasure you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>like exchange</p>
<p>love with somebody</p>
<p>like that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna break</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not good at all no sex is good</p>
<p>then we can</p>
<p>agree all the natural</p>
<p>things food is good</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these reward</p>
<p>systems that are set up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s really fascinating</p>
<p>that so few of us are</p>
<p>tuned in to the hunter gatherer</p>
<p>thing that you are</p>
<p>yeah man i mean i grew</p>
<p>hunting is like breathing for me</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just part of my life and i bow hunt and</p>
<p>i hunt with shotguns i hunt with</p>
<p>rifles i hunt with blow guns</p>
<p>i hunt with spear guns</p>
<p>i just hunt i just have to and you know</p>
<p>one of the one of the</p>
<p>geronimo i think was the</p>
<p>great indian warrior</p>
<p>when he was finally caught</p>
<p>and put on the reservation they said to him so now</p>
<p>geronimo what are you</p>
<p>going to do now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no more hunting for you and he goes no</p>
<p>we will hunt mice because we are hunters</p>
<p>and we have to hunt</p>
<p>and and that&rsquo;s just sort of it&rsquo;s in your blood</p>
<p>hunter that&rsquo;s a dude that needs a</p>
<p>hobby that shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous you</p>
<p>gotta go hunting mice how</p>
<p>about you play</p>
<p>chess son alright</p>
<p>settle down</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go hunt mice what</p>
<p>leave the fucking mice alone man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>always the kill though it&rsquo;s like the pursuit of</p>
<p>something so do you feel</p>
<p>like when you do it when you when you kill something</p>
<p>and then get to eat it do you feel like did is it</p>
<p>trigger some sort of like a primitive reward system</p>
<p>that you feel</p>
<p>you feel it you know</p>
<p>funny enough i actually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like to eat a lot of what i kill</p>
<p>what which is</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s right we have this conversation you like beef</p>
<p>i eat for dinner</p>
<p>i like beef</p>
<p>but none of my meat that i&rsquo;ve ever killed goes to</p>
<p>waste i always give</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>particularly like deer or venison</p>
<p>meat because it&rsquo;s so lean</p>
<p>right i like fat i like</p>
<p>i like ribeye</p>
<p>steaks that are just</p>
<p>full of marbling so</p>
<p>when i hunt</p>
<p>i mean i do</p>
<p>clean the meat and take care of it and</p>
<p>i always donate it to somebody a friend or family or</p>
<p>somebody that needs it</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really the pursuit</p>
<p>and the capture of the game</p>
<p>that i get the the</p>
<p>reward from not the actual taking a bite of it really</p>
<p>you know i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see i get that too but i</p>
<p>think i think there&rsquo;s something in deer meat</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s something in deer and elk and this is</p>
<p>hear me out that</p>
<p>sounds totally crazy</p>
<p>but i think the</p>
<p>things that are hard to catch</p>
<p>are better for you</p>
<p>i think that if you got a cow that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just hanging around being a fat fuck and you walk</p>
<p>right up to him</p>
<p>shoot him in the head</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t see how that&rsquo;s good for you</p>
<p>i mean i mean it is good it</p>
<p>tastes delicious and</p>
<p>everything and i eat</p>
<p>steak like anybody but</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s better to eat deer because they&rsquo;re hard to</p>
<p>catch yeah the</p>
<p>effort involved when it flees be really</p>
<p>you know when you</p>
<p>want to kill fleas all day then for the same reasoning</p>
<p>oh my god no</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>them they&rsquo;re not animals that are prey you psycho</p>
<p>these they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hard to catch</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hard to</p>
<p>catch what are you saying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not hard you could</p>
<p>squash them you</p>
<p>never try to</p>
<p>catch a flea it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve ever seen a friend</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thing called free</p>
<p>split free spray</p>
<p>please pray</p>
<p>i can say it</p>
<p>you can fucking kill billions of them with a</p>
<p>stroke of a hand when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ready to go hunting let me know yeah</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re gonna go i</p>
<p>definitely want to go hunting</p>
<p>for we&rsquo;ll do another podcast when we get back when i</p>
<p>lived in colorado deer were</p>
<p>everywhere it was</p>
<p>crazy and all</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>liberals and hippies and boulder nobody</p>
<p>shooting any of</p>
<p>these deer so they&rsquo;re so relaxed</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>standing there big fucking ten</p>
<p>point bucks</p>
<p>just standing on the side of the road looking at you</p>
<p>and i stopped the car and i&rsquo;m like really</p>
<p>i roll down</p>
<p>the window and i&rsquo;m talking to the i go really</p>
<p>really he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>scared of me at all just looking at me like what</p>
<p>bitch that&rsquo;s awesome what</p>
<p>the fucking huge man and they have elk</p>
<p>when we went we looked</p>
<p>at some property in evergreen because i was convinced</p>
<p>that that was my move i needed to move to the mountains</p>
<p>yeah that was my i&rsquo;m trying to get you</p>
<p>to freaking i longer</p>
<p>if i well let&rsquo;s not talk</p>
<p>about that on the internet or</p>
<p>fucking psycho</p>
<p>stalkers are listening</p>
<p>to pay go wisconsin</p>
<p>yeah what anyway</p>
<p>evergreen oh when we were looking</p>
<p>at property in evergreen there&rsquo;s a fucking herd of elk</p>
<p>that wandered in</p>
<p>photos they wandered down</p>
<p>this certain path they walk through the fucking main</p>
<p>street in town every year</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>hundreds of them and they&rsquo;re fucking huge</p>
<p>like how badass is that like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing there and as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing there a herd of elk</p>
<p>just walk through</p>
<p>the fucking town it&rsquo;s totally not natural though</p>
<p>i mean really i mean</p>
<p>where i hunt elk and deer and</p>
<p>stuff man they&rsquo;re just wild so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not natural it&rsquo;s not natural</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not natural if not have a fear man</p>
<p>oh yeah of course it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>natural it&rsquo;s not natural yeah well the problem is</p>
<p>somehow or another this town was</p>
<p>built on a path that they always take the</p>
<p>migration thing yeah</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>guess maybe there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more fear of mountain</p>
<p>lions than there are of people so they figure look at</p>
<p>least we&rsquo;re around these</p>
<p>crazy assholes</p>
<p>one of us is getting shot</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not all</p>
<p>gonna get picked</p>
<p>apart by a fucking flock of mountain lions</p>
<p>is that what mountain lions packs packs no</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even they</p>
<p>travel solo anyway packs</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>like spider</p>
<p>spider they found the amazon you ever seen that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a spider they</p>
<p>found the amazon that attacks in packs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the only spider in the world</p>
<p>they attack</p>
<p>thousands of them at once</p>
<p>so they make these gigantic nests</p>
<p>huge spider webs</p>
<p>where like a deer could get stuck and</p>
<p>they kill much larger</p>
<p>things they kill rats and all kinds of</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s cool it&rsquo;s the amazon the amazon is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bbc documentary about the amazon a two part</p>
<p>series that i watched once i still have it on vhs</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t find it on dvd like they don&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>fucking phenomenal</p>
<p>they go into the amazon yeah and that&rsquo;s where they show</p>
<p>these these spiders like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s shit that&rsquo;s evolving in the amazon</p>
<p>right now what the amazon was</p>
<p>is it used to be like</p>
<p>fields and then it became a rainforest like overnight</p>
<p>not overnight but really</p>
<p>quickly yeah so a lot of animals got</p>
<p>stuck inside this rainforest</p>
<p>and they evolved</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s an antelope that swims</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got little</p>
<p>short legs and it swims like up to a hundred yards</p>
<p>underwater and it eats fish</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fucking antelope that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy why did do that because it gets</p>
<p>stuck there in the</p>
<p>water and they had to figure out another way to eat oh</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a fish that fucking</p>
<p>climbs out of the</p>
<p>water walks</p>
<p>till it finds the next pond and jumps in</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty sick dude</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>crazy shit there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all these animals that are</p>
<p>adapting to this</p>
<p>fucked up change in the environment</p>
<p>badass it&rsquo;s so awesome</p>
<p>but the spider anyway</p>
<p>they found one spider they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never thought spiders did this before</p>
<p>but they found this one spider that acts as a pack</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sick like so killer</p>
<p>bees but killer</p>
<p>enormous spider webs</p>
<p>and these little fucking mice get</p>
<p>stuck in them and shit</p>
<p>they just swarm on thousands of spiders you like fuck</p>
<p>you just think what if that was me</p>
<p>what if it&rsquo;s the middle of the night i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to take a piss</p>

<p>running over this log</p>
<p>and as i&rsquo;m running over the log it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>giant rattlesnake</p>
<p>i realized as</p>
<p>my feet were running over it i was like oh my god</p>

<p>venom going into your</p>
<p>bloodstream immediately you</p>
<p>know that those that cult out in um</p>
<p>virginia that actually holds snakes and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of</p>
<p>their religion</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>bit by the rattlesnake</p>
<p>then that means they&rsquo;re like pure and</p>
<p>stuff oh my god</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s this preacher guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in prison</p>
<p>right now because</p>
<p>he wanted to kill his wife</p>
<p>so he stuffed her mailbox full of</p>
<p>rattlesnakes</p>
<p>and she opened it up and put her hand in and got bit oh</p>
<p>for attempted murder oh</p>
<p>damn that&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>fire and brimstone type shit that&rsquo;s like a preacher</p>
<p>would think</p>
<p>uncle barry fin</p>
<p>shit yeah but</p>
<p>some fucking evil snakes</p>
<p>like some tom</p>
<p>killed her by putting a moon full of rattlesnakes</p>
<p>she reached in to get the mail</p>
<p>and they snap the hold of her and suck the life out</p>
<p>angela and lansbury</p>
<p>somehow involved with this</p>
<p>whole thing there&rsquo;s some primal</p>
<p>about doing that getting some evil animal do your</p>
<p>dirty work setting somebody up that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like way cooler than just</p>
<p>shooting somebody</p>
<p>you know he said the fucking rattlesnake</p>
<p>wow jackson</p>
<p>when people it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always a fucking husband and his wife man god damn i</p>
<p>would like to know</p>
<p>about the percentage</p>
<p>of people that kill themselves or kill each</p>
<p>other rather</p>
<p>what percentage of</p>
<p>husband and wife</p>
<p>you mean just</p>
<p>like that where the</p>
<p>husband kills the wife or the wife kills the husband</p>
<p>is it more that like</p>
<p>what is the percentage</p>
<p>as far as like people getting killed like how</p>
<p>many of them are husband and wife how many of them are</p>
<p>just here&rsquo;s the guy that works at the post</p>
<p>office that always fucking piss me off so i shot him</p>
<p>and how many of his husband and</p>
<p>wives i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it would be</p>
<p>as much as you</p>
<p>think i think domestic violence be huge</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it goes all the way i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve all seen</p>
<p>couples that are just fucking violent to each</p>
<p>other right</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary shit dude</p>
<p>that must be so</p>
<p>scary for a cop</p>
<p>you know they always say that</p>
<p>those are the</p>
<p>most dangerous calls to take domestic violence cases</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem so like if you</p>
<p>watch the show cops it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s that big of a deal to you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true brother in law that was</p>
<p>abused by his ex really</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t go into details but</p>
<p>she came out with a knife</p>
<p>she came out with a knife</p>
<p>a few times</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t fucking her correctly</p>
<p>let me tell you something no</p>
<p>chick i&rsquo;m fucking is ever coming to me with a</p>
<p>knife you gotta</p>
<p>keep him in check</p>
<p>that would suck</p>
<p>you gotta have control</p>
<p>do you not get</p>
<p>involved in any sort of relationship</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not the man if you&rsquo;re actually a man</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get involved in a relationship</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not the man</p>
<p>if you feel like well somehow</p>
<p>with her i don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m the man and just i don&rsquo;t know what to do get out</p>
<p>get out you get your souls getting</p>
<p>stolen from you in the</p>
<p>night while you</p>
<p>sleep but you don&rsquo;t realize you&rsquo;re with</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>alpha like you</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it then whatever</p>
<p>the role is make sure it&rsquo;s a harmonious one</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying don&rsquo;t let someone</p>
<p>all of a sudden be like</p>
<p>the dominant one and you figure you&rsquo;re not dominant</p>
<p>anymore like men who get in situations like that</p>
<p>where their wife gets to yell at them and the father</p>
<p>the husband&rsquo;s always gone okay okay</p>
<p>okay okay that&rsquo;s just nature&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s their nature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not healthy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a girl out there somewhere</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably nice</p>
<p>and if they</p>
<p>found that girl instead of the one they&rsquo;re with they</p>
<p>found some chick who just likes to</p>
<p>look at the positive side of</p>
<p>things and she likes</p>
<p>going to cool</p>
<p>movies and eating in fun</p>
<p>places and she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t require a lot</p>
<p>you know you that goes out there</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to listen to this fuck yeah but</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s probably dead inside for that</p>
<p>those very good qualities you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why she&rsquo;s giving up on life and she&rsquo;s like are you</p>
<p>giving up on</p>
<p>life she&rsquo;s enjoying</p>
<p>things is that what it is when the</p>
<p>chick isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>crazy she&rsquo;s giving up on</p>
<p>life is just</p>
<p>interesting sit down on the</p>
<p>couch just like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m dead that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>so you think that any</p>
<p>chick that&rsquo;s like no i don&rsquo;t really i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really shake this out</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just throwing something on the</p>
<p>table there</p>
<p>i thought you were committed to this man</p>
<p>no you sure you&rsquo;re not committed to this argument</p>
<p>rick doesn&rsquo;t even know what we&rsquo;re talking about that</p>
<p>kinda went over my head</p>
<p>staring at us like i took rick</p>
<p>schroeder to his very first ufc recently how was it</p>
<p>it was good but to be honest with</p>
<p>you i wanted to be inside</p>
<p>where you guys were</p>
<p>i was like on the outside</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>too far i was looking up</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t have a great view</p>
<p>well you guys were on the floor like</p>
<p>floor seats are not my favorite</p>
<p>my favorite is one or two up</p>
<p>yeah on the side</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re right i think the first risers</p>
<p>right first rise is the best spot because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still close enough to see the action</p>
<p>yeah you know but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re not looking up</p>
<p>sometimes life sucks when they go to the ground on the</p>
<p>other side of the cage</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on the ground you know like in tv and</p>
<p>hd because i buy it all the time on pay per view</p>
<p>like i get like the</p>
<p>close ups i hear the sounds more</p>
<p>i was more in the fight commentary where</p>
<p>yeah i i didn&rsquo;t hear any commentary</p>
<p>right you can get these little they have these little</p>
<p>radio things and</p>
<p>they sell them</p>
<p>ufc fight link i believe it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>and you listen</p>
<p>to it and you get to listen to the commentary</p>
<p>they broadcast it unlike a wireless signal like a</p>
<p>radio station</p>
<p>iphone app for that they</p>
<p>should totally right</p>
<p>totally charlie</p>
<p>what the fuck dana</p>
<p>dana get on this shit son</p>
<p>it was cool though man</p>
<p>you have seen a huge ufc fan</p>
<p>just wrote a</p>
<p>movie about it</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll see what happens but yeah i mean</p>
<p>rick schroeder go</p>
<p>chuck norris</p>
<p>talk to me once like 15 years ago</p>
<p>chuck norris hug me is the</p>
<p>greatest moment of my life</p>
<p>chuck norris man was was like</p>
<p>did he try to</p>
<p>start some mma</p>
<p>league well he did</p>
<p>he had a kickboxing league</p>
<p>i think it was called the</p>
<p>world combat league i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not sure i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not sure if that&rsquo;s the right name</p>
<p>like 15 years</p>
<p>ago i apologize if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wrong because i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>huge chuck norris fan</p>
<p>and he tried to</p>
<p>get me in on that way back in the beginning like really</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s build a team in</p>
<p>la yeah that&rsquo;s exactly what</p>
<p>he was doing he was doing kickboxing teams and they</p>
<p>tried to do that with the ifl</p>
<p>the ifls the international</p>
<p>fight league and they had some really good</p>
<p>fighters but they</p>
<p>tried to do that team</p>
<p>thing too they had</p>
<p>tried to have them</p>
<p>fight in teams</p>
<p>the only two</p>
<p>things will be fun is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all at once</p>
<p>well you know i thought it was free i</p>
<p>thought you know hey look you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>right way to go but at</p>
<p>least it&rsquo;s something different and people are talking</p>
<p>about it like it makes for</p>
<p>subject of debate you like this do you not like this</p>
<p>you know it makes it a little</p>
<p>novel but yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the way to do it teams aren&rsquo;t the way to do it</p>
<p>i would you</p>
<p>know when all</p>
<p>those things were</p>
<p>coming around i was like what are you doing it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>individual sport</p>
<p>why try to team</p>
<p>i guess what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re just trying to</p>
<p>get in on some unique way</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>everybody else is doing it this way so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have teams the denver douchebags and the fucking</p>
<p>the montreal</p>
<p>monsters you</p>
<p>know folding</p>
<p>chairs into it let&rsquo;s really get going</p>
<p>i was just gonna</p>
<p>say it seemed very roller derby</p>
<p>i was gonna say that you went pro</p>
<p>wrestling around the same way</p>
<p>wave like there</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s i don&rsquo;t know man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting the only way to do it is just do it</p>
<p>you know just have to</p>
<p>stop trying to</p>
<p>dress it up</p>
<p>i do like some</p>
<p>strike force rules</p>
<p>strike forces put rules in when they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>elbows i know</p>
<p>a lot of people like</p>
<p>elbows but fuck</p>
<p>elbows cut people up man</p>
<p>and i know you</p>
<p>should just protect yourself from that</p>
<p>and elbows can stop</p>
<p>fights too they&rsquo;re very dangerous weapons but</p>
<p>i kind of like</p>
<p>strike force how they just do</p>
<p>punches they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>elbow each other on the ground</p>
<p>i think i think</p>
<p>it might make</p>
<p>fighters careers longer i mean</p>
<p>people like</p>
<p>it though and it&rsquo;s a very effective technique</p>
<p>maybe they need some sort of a pad on the</p>
<p>elbow if that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>might not be a bad idea that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t cut yeah because it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>short movement</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on top of a guy in such a fucking</p>
<p>short distance to stop and so much</p>
<p>power you can generate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just bone on bone just</p>
<p>smashing your fucking face</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a goddamn dangerous technique man</p>
<p>make it have like a</p>
<p>sound like a dog toy though</p>
<p>every time they do it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you feel gay doing it</p>
<p>making a squishy toy noise</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>wrong with elbows i mean don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong i wouldn&rsquo;t take them</p>
<p>out i wouldn&rsquo;t take them out either but</p>
<p>i look at the</p>
<p>strike force</p>
<p>rule and i go</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s the way to go</p>
<p>sometimes i look at it and go i like that that&rsquo;s around</p>
<p>know what i do like i like that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>comparison we can look at the</p>
<p>strike force</p>
<p>and see see what happens with them with the</p>
<p>punches in the ground like we&rsquo;ve already done that with</p>
<p>pride the old</p>
<p>pride days they used to be able to</p>
<p>do whatever they wanted man they got soccer kick dudes</p>
<p>while their heads were on the ground headbutts</p>
<p>stomp on them</p>
<p>they did i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they allow</p>
<p>headbutts and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they allow</p>
<p>groin groin</p>
<p>kicks i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the allowed</p>
<p>fish hooking or any of the</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s always illegal</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>allow it but they added</p>
<p>the stomps and</p>
<p>the soccer kicks and the knees to the head to a downed</p>
<p>opponent it&rsquo;s all really fucking</p>
<p>violent dangerous shit you know</p>
<p>when you see a guy get soccer</p>
<p>kicked in the head that&rsquo;s when you know you like whoa</p>
<p>like shit this is not</p>
<p>fucking playing around this is a real fight</p>
<p>that guy just</p>
<p>soccer kicked that guy in the face when he&rsquo;s down</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the best</p>
<p>thing to have in</p>
<p>mma but pocket adds this</p>
<p>crazy element to it</p>
<p>you know when a guy goes down the</p>
<p>other guy&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>stomp him like</p>
<p>literally like whoa</p>
<p>vandele silva</p>
<p>knocked out</p>
<p>i think it was timora</p>
<p>no it wasn&rsquo;t timora</p>
<p>damn i forget who it was yuki kondo</p>
<p>yes i believe it was</p>
<p>he knocked him out and then he started</p>
<p>stomping his fucking head</p>
<p>while he was down but didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>early ufcs and</p>
<p>like have biting and stuff</p>
<p>maybe it wasn&rsquo;t easy</p>
<p>condo i should i</p>
<p>should find out exactly who it was and</p>
<p>randomly do that before i said</p>
<p>it but whoever it was he was holding onto the ropes</p>
<p>with one hand then kicking the guy in the face</p>
<p>stomping on his head</p>
<p>while he was down it was so violent</p>
<p>i was like fuck</p>
<p>like that took it to another</p>
<p>level yeah that&rsquo;s the refs</p>
<p>fault though for no no no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>legal it&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>huh in japan it&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>well in japan and</p>
<p>pride it was</p>
<p>legal you were i</p>
<p>think you can</p>
<p>still do it i know you can</p>
<p>definitely still kick</p>
<p>or knee a downed</p>
<p>opponent i think you can soccer kick him</p>
<p>still to and you can stomp them</p>
<p>still too i</p>
<p>think i think</p>
<p>dream the way they do it i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different organizations like</p>
<p>one of the things that the</p>
<p>ufc has always been pushing for is a unified</p>
<p>system of rules so the rules we use</p>
<p>everybody uses so that we all practice</p>
<p>the same sport that makes complete</p>
<p>sense totally complete</p>
<p>sense it&rsquo;s totally the</p>
<p>right way to go but</p>
<p>japan doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like no</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t like five</p>
<p>minute rounds we want a ten</p>
<p>minute round</p>
<p>ten minute round</p>
<p>and they have</p>
<p>crazy shit where they&rsquo;ll come and they&rsquo;ll take your</p>
<p>money away if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting hard enough really yeah dude they get</p>
<p>crazy laws over there</p>
<p>so like say if</p>
<p>and sometimes man dudes</p>
<p>are just taking a fucking breather like it&rsquo;s a war</p>
<p>or they neutralize each other</p>
<p>nobody can get anything done</p>
<p>and they go stop stop</p>
<p>and they pull</p>
<p>out a yellow card and what a yellow card is</p>
<p>is they take 10</p>
<p>of your fucking purse</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re getting paid</p>
<p>100 grand you just lost 10 000</p>
<p>because some fucking douchebag referee</p>
<p>decided you needed a yellow card</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>fighting hard enough at</p>
<p>least it&rsquo;s just that in</p>
<p>japan a yellow card can mean a lot of</p>
<p>things yeah</p>
<p>they could be</p>
<p>get the eels</p>
<p>and the women</p>
<p>they cut your finger off</p>
<p>right could mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a p card that&rsquo;s the craziest</p>
<p>thing ever the yakuza</p>
<p>will they chop fingers off</p>
<p>why like you fuck up you do something</p>
<p>wrong you have to cut your own finger off</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>punishment yeah yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the punishments did you hear</p>
<p>about the saudis</p>
<p>trying to paralyze some guy yeah</p>
<p>did they go through</p>
<p>with it yeah i don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;ve gone through</p>
<p>with it i know they&rsquo;re inquiring on whether or not it</p>
<p>could be done one hospital said they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be if you don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>story this uh</p>
<p>a guy hit a guy with a</p>
<p>shovel is that</p>
<p>what he hit him with i don&rsquo;t know any details</p>
<p>he assaulted this guy in some way and paralyzed him</p>
<p>and under islamic law</p>
<p>eye for an eye</p>
<p>they literally want to impose the exact same</p>
<p>injury to this guy and do it in a hospital</p>
<p>you know one hospital</p>
<p>is like you can&rsquo;t paralyze somebody like we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just do that another hospital said it was possible but</p>
<p>they did not have the</p>
<p>conditions available they</p>
<p>would have to go to a much larger hospital</p>
<p>so they probably went to some fucking</p>
<p>goat and donkey infested hospital</p>
<p>with chickens running through the fucking lobby</p>
<p>like would you be willing</p>
<p>to paralyze</p>
<p>someone and they&rsquo;re like well</p>
<p>maybe we can do it here though do this</p>
<p>again south</p>
<p>central to do it for 100 bucks</p>
<p>would you guys</p>
<p>agree with that though eye for an eye</p>
<p>judgment um</p>
<p>man you know what i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s just a certain amount of</p>
<p>cruelty to that it&rsquo;s not necessary i</p>
<p>think if you want to show people</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s wrong kill the guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think i think</p>
<p>death penalty is a good thing</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>i mean you have to know the circumstances who knows</p>
<p>maybe the other guy&rsquo;s a dickhead</p>
<p>maybe the other guy</p>
<p>threw a rock</p>
<p>first and then he hit him with a</p>
<p>shovel and paralyzed them yeah we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough information yeah</p>
<p>maybe that guy was fucking</p>
<p>tormenting them</p>
<p>you know wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leave his kids</p>
<p>alone it was</p>
<p>an asshole kicked his dog and you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>building up over ten fucking years</p>
<p>and finally homeboy had enough and he just</p>
<p>did what he&rsquo;s supposed to have done a long time ago</p>
<p>crack that motherfucker over the head with a shovel</p>
<p>but unfortunately</p>
<p>his little faggot</p>
<p>ass has to go and get paralyzed</p>
<p>and now my man&rsquo;s in the pokey and they talking</p>
<p>about paralyzing him too</p>
<p>meanwhile all he was doing</p>
<p>just trying to hold his ground just trying to get by</p>
<p>in this world</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>trying to they</p>
<p>should have the three</p>
<p>strike rule like the</p>
<p>first time you do something really really bad they come</p>
<p>they take away your hearing then the</p>
<p>second time they take away your eyesight they</p>
<p>shut off your tongue dude you you</p>
<p>might have just</p>
<p>invented that and that there&rsquo;s people in iran</p>

<p>write it down</p>
<p>before the idea</p>
<p>escapes us into the ether</p>

<p>okay joe what can i tell</p>
<p>you man without telling me what do you want to know</p>
<p>about back in the day dude</p>
<p>i want to know</p>
<p>everything you know i&rsquo;ve been friends with rick for</p>
<p>well a few years</p>
<p>for five years now we&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>more friendly lately</p>
<p>since he got back from spain yeah</p>
<p>since our kids our</p>
<p>bodies yeah</p>
<p>just really</p>
<p>changed since he</p>
<p>said i became a</p>
<p>pussy settled</p>
<p>in like all the</p>
<p>other pussies out there in the world</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m you know for sure</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think you can</p>
<p>understand what it&rsquo;s like to have children</p>
<p>until you have children</p>
<p>and you know louis</p>
<p>ck said something once</p>
<p>about kids i thought was really interesting</p>
<p>said just let it change you</p>
<p>and i had already like</p>
<p>kind of let it change me before i</p>
<p>heard that but</p>
<p>i was like wow that&rsquo;s like the best way to describe it</p>
<p>let it change you</p>
<p>you know and when you have kids that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that really is what happens like you you all the sudden</p>
<p>first of all the immediately what i</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>is looking at people as babies</p>
<p>i looked at everybody</p>
<p>i used to just you</p>
<p>know see a guy</p>
<p>who was 30 and i was like oh here&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>hey buddy what&rsquo;s up nothing</p>
<p>you know normal but now you feel like the</p>
<p>inner child</p>
<p>yeah but now i</p>
<p>yeah i see the</p>
<p>inner child</p>
<p>i see how he</p>
<p>developed to be that guy you have much more</p>
<p>compassion for people</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool i try to keep as much</p>
<p>compassion as possible</p>
<p>while still</p>
<p>avoiding douchebags that&rsquo;s my ethic</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>where sometimes</p>
<p>you have to go dude shut the fuck up please</p>
<p>leave me alone i know you were a baby once</p>
<p>no one point in time you innocent little</p>
<p>child somebody fucked your programming up i</p>
<p>understand this</p>
<p>you gotta let me go i got shit i</p>
<p>gotta do you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>right i get it</p>
<p>but yeah you have a change of time</p>
<p>so i think everybody does</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t change when you have kids you&rsquo;re a fool</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be crazy too</p>
<p>the worst thing in the</p>
<p>world that you</p>
<p>could ever feel is that</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t do your best when you were raising a kid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gotta be the</p>
<p>worst thing</p>
<p>cause i think</p>
<p>your childhood was fucking</p>
<p>completely bizarre i mean my</p>
<p>childhood was</p>
<p>bizarre on paper</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bizarre in front of the</p>
<p>whole world</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>you became a fucking</p>
<p>superstar when you were a little kid</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forty now</p>
<p>right right just</p>
<p>for okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>forty three</p>
<p>so when i saw the</p>
<p>champ i think i was</p>
<p>seven what were you like four no no i was</p>
<p>seven so you were ten</p>
<p>in the champ</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>okay my time run</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re close but</p>
<p>either way either way</p>
<p>whatever i was</p>
<p>seven or ten i was</p>
<p>fucking crying</p>
<p>like a baby and you are even younger than me then</p>
<p>so when i was a little kid</p>
<p>when i was like</p>
<p>going through</p>
<p>live trying to figure out you know what my parents were</p>
<p>breaking up</p>
<p>going trying to figure out like fuck what is life all</p>
<p>about you were fucking</p>
<p>famous in front of the</p>
<p>whole world</p>
<p>like i couldn&rsquo;t imagine that</p>
<p>point in my life being famous</p>
<p>that must have been</p>
<p>so strange to develop in that but you&rsquo;re so normal</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think interesting</p>
<p>about like growing up</p>
<p>famous cause</p>
<p>i became famous when i was like</p>
<p>seven so i don&rsquo;t have any memory</p>
<p>of life before fame wow</p>
<p>so when that happens and you&rsquo;re forming and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting programmed and you&rsquo;re getting created as a</p>
<p>child right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what becomes normal for you</p>
<p>and so i don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>frame of reference like i wasn&rsquo;t thirty</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden bam became</p>
<p>famous and i had</p>
<p>thirty years of history</p>
<p>of normal life</p>
<p>so fame is normal for me</p>
<p>so because it&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>that means kind of it&rsquo;s not special</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>is right is normal</p>
<p>right so that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>i think a different unique thing</p>
<p>about being a</p>
<p>child actor like i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i saw drew barrymore</p>
<p>last night i went</p>
<p>never heard anybody put it that way before</p>
<p>i went to her premiere last</p>
<p>night she&rsquo;s kind of done the same thing</p>
<p>and her new</p>
<p>movie and gave her a big hug and kiss i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen her in 20 years just grab her ass</p>
<p>and no i just</p>
<p>cute girl though give her hug</p>
<p>give her hug in a case</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve known her</p>
<p>since i felt good</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m twelve come on felt good she was</p>
<p>eight as drew</p>
<p>barrymore we</p>
<p>would dance tom</p>
<p>green not got that you</p>
<p>could get that too kid</p>
<p>yeah yeah she picks the</p>
<p>weirdest guys</p>
<p>which is great i love tom</p>
<p>green yeah i</p>
<p>would do his show no i didn&rsquo;t he does a show like is he</p>
<p>canadian far more sophisticated</p>
<p>yes he&rsquo;s canadian</p>
<p>but you can trust him</p>
<p>i saw you trust him he&rsquo;s one of the good</p>
<p>ones did you see the show where he took</p>
<p>animals into his parents</p>
<p>house and had a zoo</p>
<p>he like fucked a moose on the side of the road he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>savage yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucking awesome i love that dude he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really cool guy too he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>a show that he&rsquo;s been doing out of his house</p>
<p>he turned his living room into a</p>
<p>studio where he</p>
<p>broadcasts a live talk show from his living room</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s super popular it&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting you get to see him</p>
<p>changing and of trying different things</p>
<p>when i got to him he was into the secret</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like really that book yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like had a copy of it</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t even know if he was telling the</p>
<p>truth i believe he was but</p>
<p>it seemed like almost it was like it was like it was</p>
<p>trolling he</p>
<p>was just fucking around pretending to be into the</p>
<p>secret thing</p>
<p>yeah but so drew</p>
<p>the same thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a few of us have gone through that</p>
<p>like not many</p>
<p>did you very very few</p>
<p>count on a hand yeah</p>
<p>the percentage</p>
<p>of people who go through that and get lindsay lohan</p>
<p>are like it&rsquo;s like 95 right</p>
<p>yeah more more than 95 it&rsquo;s gotta be</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think was the difference with you</p>
<p>oh what&rsquo;s the difference you know i quit the</p>
<p>partying thing when i was</p>
<p>young and i didn&rsquo;t continue it like i think</p>
<p>some people do</p>
<p>and you know i had my feud wildly</p>
<p>years between 16 and you know 20</p>
<p>but you know i always kept my kind of</p>
<p>stuff quiet and i</p>
<p>kind of kept it</p>
<p>under the radar and</p>
<p>you know wasn&rsquo;t really public</p>
<p>about it and then i met that was</p>
<p>cause there was no</p>
<p>tmz yeah there&rsquo;s no internet</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>tmz no one in there son</p>
<p>and so keep</p>
<p>it on the dl when i</p>
<p>was here making it rain</p>
<p>how you ever wonder</p>
<p>when i was twenty i met andrea</p>
<p>and that just kind of</p>

<p>what&rsquo;s you know how did you make it from a kid actor</p>
<p>to an adult</p>
<p>like this you know how did you survive because</p>
<p>i was kind of in the middle of</p>
<p>transitioning from a kid to an adult and</p>
<p>he said you know the</p>
<p>trick was being</p>
<p>inspired ricky because</p>
<p>i had to be inspired to keep it up</p>
<p>and i had to find</p>
<p>stuff that i wanted to work on and wanted to do</p>
<p>and you know i kind of took that advice to</p>
<p>heart you know</p>
<p>but no nothing ever</p>
<p>inappropriate and he</p>
<p>started kissing her nipples nothing inappropriate</p>
<p>happened with me</p>
<p>or that i know of</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s such an odd</p>
<p>he was such an odd guy just even the way his voice was</p>
<p>and it was very strange that that&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>voice just such an odd character</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>never been a guy who</p>
<p>would so much to get out i mean we talked</p>
<p>about it last week in the podcast like how</p>
<p>crazy was watching him dance</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like nobody</p>
<p>ever did anything like that before like the even though</p>
<p>the way elvis</p>
<p>did but he did in a different way</p>
<p>he took michael</p>
<p>jackson&rsquo;s he had</p>
<p>a weird thing about</p>
<p>sammy davis</p>
<p>he took some from brown</p>

<p>on the podcast a couple weeks ago the opening in zaire</p>
<p>james brown was like manly</p>
<p>the way james</p>
<p>brown was like</p>
<p>it was like more like a</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>the way that</p>
<p>michael jackson</p>
<p>did it is more like this gliding almost like</p>
<p>alien type character</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s moving around in perfect</p>
<p>synchronicity it was like the more of a</p>
<p>there was more of a</p>
<p>perfection to michael jackson&rsquo;s movements</p>
<p>whereas like</p>
<p>james brown was more of</p>
<p>a raw sexuality you know</p>
<p>i had the jet michael jackson jacket do you remember oh</p>
<p>totally the generic</p>
<p>one though i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>my family couldn&rsquo;t afford the real ones we got the</p>

<p>okay and i would say i</p>
<p>would say let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s get rid of the showbiz</p>
<p>aspirations let&rsquo;s just let it go</p>
<p>we got about fifty</p>
<p>grand the bank i think it&rsquo;s time to move thailand</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to go thailand</p>
<p>thailand your celebrity</p>
<p>okay you still got</p>
<p>fifty grand will go a long goddamn way</p>
<p>get you get yourself a nice girl</p>
<p>settle down the jungle</p>
<p>learn some learn some muay thai</p>
<p>go fishing okay america&rsquo;s not for you son you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get some fucking</p>
<p>that the chick that did</p>
<p>marry him did you ever see the chicken married him</p>
<p>yeah she took pictures on his deathbed</p>
<p>when she was like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so rough</p>
<p>like just get like a</p>
<p>self porch and he&rsquo;s fucked up with pipes</p>
<p>tubes coming out of</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s beyond</p>
<p>gross it&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the darkest pictures</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s saying a lot that i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>on the internet it&rsquo;s true one of the darkest pictures</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s such</p>
<p>a lack of love and respect and there&rsquo;s a lack of</p>
<p>remorse and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not sad that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dying or if she is it&rsquo;s not that sad</p>
<p>terrible i don&rsquo;t know i mean who knows how he</p>
<p>treated her you know</p>
<p>of course he</p>
<p>treated like shit</p>
<p>he probably yelled at everybody but you know the guys</p>
<p>again he was born fucked up</p>
<p>yeah could you imagine just</p>
<p>going through life</p>
<p>going there&rsquo;s no way to fix this</p>
<p>and he was so talented though</p>
<p>when he was a kid</p>
<p>i mean he was amazing if you go back and</p>
<p>watch what do you do if you associate</p>
<p>a guy like that that&rsquo;s what the hard part is</p>
<p>you know how do you transition</p>
<p>from being you know i mean it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>i guess if you</p>
<p>could write your own shit if you</p>
<p>could write your own</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>about a guy who&rsquo;s in your situation</p>
<p>you know then you</p>
<p>could come up with some sort of a show as an adult</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>right yeah yeah i mean but you got to adapt and</p>
<p>morph and change and</p>
<p>grow at the times and that&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think what happens to a lot of</p>
<p>child actors they kind of don&rsquo;t and</p>
<p>they also you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re used to</p>
<p>being treated</p>
<p>a certain way and getting certain big paydays and</p>
<p>certain big</p>
<p>checks and when they</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s time to humble</p>
<p>yourself and just sort of</p>
<p>start working</p>
<p>again for less</p>
<p>or you know</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>things that you may not really like</p>
<p>their egos are too big</p>
<p>so you gotta stay humble</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s the one of the</p>
<p>biggest and</p>
<p>aaron gray helps</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t she</p>
<p>aaron grace</p>
<p>how hard is it to be able</p>
<p>to stay humble that is the most hard</p>
<p>thing right to stay</p>
<p>humble the most</p>
<p>confusing thing is when</p>
<p>you know that you&rsquo;re just a normal person but everybody</p>
<p>treats you like you&rsquo;re special</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a star</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on a set if you&rsquo;re on a set like a sitcom</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so easy to lose your head</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s kissing your ass</p>
<p>and all the network</p>
<p>people are all walking on eggshells around you and</p>
<p>they want to be really friendly with you and everybody</p>
<p>wants to be nice to you and everyone&rsquo;s got a big smile</p>
<p>and the show&rsquo;s doing well everyone&rsquo;s got a big smile</p>
<p>when kisses your ass it&rsquo;s like you live in some</p>
<p>weird and then you had a</p>
<p>count and you</p>
<p>got a lawyer that kisses your ass and you publicist</p>
<p>that kisses your ass and</p>
<p>manager and all</p>
<p>these people that you&rsquo;re employing that are</p>
<p>kind of kissing your ass</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>you know just to have real people around it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>hard to pull off for some people it&rsquo;s very hard to get</p>
<p>yourself out of that</p>
<p>that spiral</p>
<p>of confusion</p>
<p>your identity confusion like who the fuck</p>
<p>am i yeah but my friends were always outside hollywood</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important that&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>my friends were</p>
<p>always just</p>

<p>ranchers or hunters or did you just go knock</p>

<p>cleaned his</p>
<p>house in forever</p>

<p>half of one adderall and he</p>
<p>cleaned his</p>
<p>whole entire</p>
<p>place from like</p>
<p>amazing like he</p>
<p>found traffic keepers from</p>
<p>12 years ago with the incredible hulk on it because</p>
<p>you know from</p>
<p>a middle school kid that</p>
<p>he kidnapped or something wow</p>
<p>adderall is supposed to be really</p>
<p>powerful shit</p>
<p>robert etkimo</p>
<p>told me he took it accidentally once</p>
<p>ecstasy have you ever</p>
<p>tried that yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not really a fan of that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never tried it i</p>
<p>learned a lot when i did ecstasy</p>
<p>i had a very</p>
<p>powerful positive</p>
<p>experience i</p>
<p>learned a lot from it</p>
<p>but i wouldn&rsquo;t do it again</p>
<p>i did not like the way it made my</p>
<p>brain feel the next day my</p>
<p>brain was very dull</p>
<p>and it felt like</p>
<p>the way i described it i felt like a</p>
<p>sponge where like most of the</p>
<p>water had been rung out of it it just wasn&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>right i couldn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>connections</p>
<p>right i was in a</p>
<p>like a starbucks</p>
<p>and i was reading a</p>
<p>magazine the next day i was reading a boxing</p>
<p>magazine i couldn&rsquo;t read the</p>
<p>magazine i couldn&rsquo;t read it it was a</p>
<p>story i wanted to hear about</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always been a boxing fan</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m reading this</p>
<p>matchup and</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t read it i couldn&rsquo;t put the words together</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>fuck i can&rsquo;t read</p>
<p>okay whatever i did last</p>
<p>night to have this</p>
<p>fucking loving</p>
<p>you know everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cool let&rsquo;s all be friends in this beautiful positive</p>
<p>enlightening</p>
<p>experience the next day like you pay for that</p>
<p>shit you paid for it</p>
<p>i paid for it</p>
<p>i was like okay i paid once i&rsquo;m not paying again</p>
<p>i know there&rsquo;s some shit that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do that i know that</p>
<p>it was a positive</p>
<p>experience for me i realized</p>
<p>you realize when you do</p>
<p>ecstasy a lot of what is possible if everybody</p>
<p>dropped the bullshit</p>
<p>you realize</p>
<p>how beautiful life</p>
<p>would be if everybody was</p>
<p>super friendly and</p>
<p>happy to see each other</p>
<p>it would be way more</p>
<p>fun and way more</p>
<p>enjoyable than it is right now</p>
<p>and you realize that you can do your part to kind of</p>
<p>make it lean in that direction</p>
<p>so i think in that way it was very positive</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>the elevated</p>
<p>levels of brain hormones</p>
<p>that you give yourself when you take that stuff</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a deficit like you go up so then it</p>
<p>crashes and then you don&rsquo;t have any left</p>
<p>and then your</p>
<p>brain is just like all shitty and fucked up</p>
<p>until it replenishes</p>
<p>everything on its own</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smart i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you should fuck with that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other stuff that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do that mushrooms don&rsquo;t do that yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m scared to take</p>
<p>strums again i want to so bad but the last time i ship</p>
<p>for like six</p>
<p>hours straight on shrooms and it was the most craziest</p>
<p>uncomfortable</p>
<p>worst you know hanging out in the bathroom</p>
<p>should you say shit yeah</p>
<p>sometimes they make you shit because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re eating mushrooms you&rsquo;re eating poison</p>
<p>well you have</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not poison but they do have bacteria</p>
<p>sometimes they do have a lot of them have fungus on</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;ve heard of</p>
<p>throwing up but not yeah</p>
<p>a lot of people throw up</p>
<p>some people trippy</p>
<p>to some people</p>
<p>throw up and that&rsquo;s when it really kicks in</p>
<p>which is really kind of strange</p>
<p>dude you were</p>
<p>shit tripping i</p>
<p>remember looking at the ground was like a</p>
<p>checkered pattern i remember the</p>
<p>checkers are</p>
<p>going up and down kind of like text</p>
<p>tetris or something like that like i saw like the</p>
<p>my heartbeat</p>
<p>in the floor and it was</p>
<p>while i&rsquo;m shitting my</p>
<p>brains out the</p>
<p>crazy thing</p>
<p>about the mushroom</p>
<p>experience is</p>
<p>individuals the</p>
<p>crazy thing is</p>
<p>the feeling that you get like you kind of get it now</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>fleeting feeling</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the mushrooms you like you get it it all seems to make</p>
<p>sense it all seems to fall into place</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>familiar yeah familiar but it&rsquo;s also this like this</p>
<p>enhanced level</p>
<p>of understanding it&rsquo;s like all the bullshit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in your head</p>
<p>all the insecurities all the</p>
<p>false assumptions all the</p>
<p>things that are just like</p>
<p>tripping up the way you think</p>
<p>they all get pushed to the side</p>
<p>and the lights all get turned on you know that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>my experiences have been on mushrooms but no paranoia</p>
<p>no mushrooms</p>
<p>had it all the time paranoia</p>
<p>every six times maybe</p>
<p>mushrooms are</p>
<p>annoyed and anxiety and</p>
<p>fucking bad trips and shitting myself well it&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s when you try to control it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very humbling sometimes i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just too</p>
<p>strong or too</p>
<p>like you said</p>
<p>different molds and</p>
<p>stuff so you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>reacts into</p>
<p>a mold yeah you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know who the fuck&rsquo;s growing your mushrooms too</p>
<p>right or making your lsd</p>
<p>you know some people like you hear stories of like</p>
<p>crazy lsd makers i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the fuck they&rsquo;re doing and you&rsquo;re just pretty much</p>
<p>fucking your</p>
<p>brain up here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>story rick that you</p>
<p>think was fascinating we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this before in the show</p>
<p>the cia used to do</p>
<p>experiments on american</p>
<p>civilians in the 1950s</p>
<p>against their will</p>
<p>we did a thing called operation midnight climax</p>
<p>where the cia</p>
<p>owned a brothel in san francisco and in new york</p>
<p>and they got</p>
<p>these guys are</p>
<p>going to get</p>
<p>laid and they dosed them up with acid and ran</p>
<p>tests on them</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how the cia</p>
<p>totally true</p>
<p>can we make that into a</p>
<p>movie fuck let&rsquo;s do</p>
<p>it son we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to work together seriously</p>
<p>what research</p>
<p>you saw in here</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>this is the beginning</p>
<p>what research do you have</p>
<p>a ricky joey</p>
<p>productions</p>
<p>really no it&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;s operation midnight</p>
<p>climax it&rsquo;s the freedom of information act they release</p>
<p>these documents</p>
<p>to see i a random</p>
<p>yeah let&rsquo;s do it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy i know right</p>
<p>look someone needs to do a documentary</p>
<p>on acid because people don&rsquo;t realize it because it was</p>
<p>squashed out they</p>
<p>threw so much</p>
<p>water in the fire we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>all died out so</p>
<p>quickly we all don&rsquo;t realize people live today</p>
<p>in 2010 what an impact acid had on the culture</p>
<p>of the 1960s</p>
<p>i mean people really were convinced that we&rsquo;re all one</p>
<p>the flower movement of san francisco the flower</p>
<p>power movement</p>
<p>those people are all an acid what</p>
<p>about disney</p>
<p>can he see i don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>about what about i</p>
<p>heard disney did that stuff</p>
<p>oh a lot of people have done acid i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure he probably did it how the fuck do you call that a</p>
<p>crazy mouse</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re doing acid it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>who knows i mean you</p>
<p>might not have but i</p>
<p>think a lot of people did it because</p>
<p>there were so many people doing it so many people</p>
<p>reporting all</p>
<p>these positive</p>
<p>experiences on it that</p>
<p>all these rich</p>
<p>powerful people anyone in a position that</p>
<p>would get in contact with</p>
<p>these people that are doing it</p>
<p>these artists they</p>
<p>would want to try it</p>
<p>you know ken kesey</p>
<p>and timothy</p>
<p>leary and all</p>
<p>those guys and terrence mckenna</p>
<p>all those dudes that are</p>
<p>doing acid back then</p>
<p>they all wanted</p>
<p>other people to do it</p>
<p>mushrooms between</p>
<p>acid and mushrooms what&rsquo;s the difference is</p>
<p>man lsd yeah it&rsquo;s man made i mean it does</p>
<p>exist what&rsquo;s the difference it</p>
<p>exists actually</p>
<p>in seeds of some</p>
<p>plants a hawaiian</p>
<p>baby woodrose i</p>
<p>think has it in it</p>
<p>or it has a similar</p>
<p>compound in it and there&rsquo;s another one in morning</p>
<p>glory seeds</p>
<p>morning glory seeds</p>
<p>has like a natural form of lsd you can buy morning</p>
<p>glory seeds</p>
<p>and you do something to them there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>directions how to do it online you make like pour acid</p>
<p>on it no no</p>
<p>you like cook them or something</p>
<p>and then you eat them and you trip your fucking</p>
<p>balls off terrence mckenna said that his</p>
<p>first psychedelic</p>
<p>experience was morning</p>
<p>glory seeds</p>
<p>and then he had all this</p>
<p>aztec imagery</p>
<p>he was looking at</p>
<p>fucking mayan temples and shit through the</p>
<p>clouds i heard that with</p>
<p>a lot of things like banana peels licking frogs</p>
<p>no no no but this is real</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t the banana peel</p>
<p>thing right no</p>
<p>no banana peel&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>no frogs are real</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain frogs that produce ma5mao</p>
<p>dmt yeah they sell</p>
<p>them on ebay i remember a long time ago i was actually</p>
<p>gonna buy one just</p>

<p>huh yeah there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole website devoted to it show you how to do it yeah</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>what i heard is that you have to like</p>
<p>make you rub them on</p>
<p>glass and then</p>
<p>their excretions are on the</p>
<p>glass and then you dry the excretions in the sun</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>scrape it off and smoke it</p>
<p>is that what you</p>
<p>gotta do probably something like that</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t actually do it oh no no</p>
<p>i talked to the</p>
<p>breeder and he was just like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have a new</p>
<p>batch soon i was</p>

<p>and all that shit</p>
<p>do you think you lost some</p>
<p>brain cells directly</p>
<p>but you know i</p>
<p>think i lost most</p>
<p>brain cells with that one</p>
<p>story i told you</p>
<p>about where i rented this</p>
<p>apartment and then my heat</p>
<p>ended up being carbon dioxide from the gas furnace</p>
<p>blowing on me for two years or a year oh that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>i found out the day i&rsquo;m moving out and</p>
<p>guys like you know</p>
<p>checking over my room make sure i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>destroy it and goes what the fuck why is that uncovered</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like what that&rsquo;s my heat and</p>
<p>it was the gas outtake for the gas furnace</p>
<p>this is carbon dioxide you</p>
<p>could have died oh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many</p>
<p>nights where me and this girl be like</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like okay</p>
<p>luckily it was such an old</p>
<p>house it was</p>
<p>drafty so it wasn&rsquo;t like airtight or something</p>
<p>dude you were getting poisoned</p>
<p>right i think that did the most damage i</p>
<p>total wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that one wasn&rsquo;t that long it was like actually like</p>
<p>eight months or something like that</p>
<p>you open a different person yeah</p>
<p>i totally looking back at that i think i</p>
<p>definitely got some</p>
<p>brain damage mostly with speech</p>
<p>i think you</p>
<p>speech yeah i feel like stuttery</p>
<p>since then oh my</p>
<p>god and i just i</p>
<p>should totally sue this</p>
<p>place but now it&rsquo;s like what 12 years</p>
<p>later dude fucking</p>
<p>sue maybe the guy hit the lottery</p>
<p>since then and now</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you could get paid son i</p>
<p>know who cares go get yours so it made you stutter</p>
<p>yeah kind of i</p>
<p>think from that that&rsquo;s what i remember</p>
<p>the most shit</p>
<p>well that one</p>
<p>famous tennis player died like that</p>
<p>vedas gerulitis</p>
<p>how did he die in the in</p>
<p>his room by carbon monoxide poisoning from the heater</p>
<p>just a couple years ago</p>
<p>not too long</p>
<p>more reason to live somewhere</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no heat bitch</p>
<p>and have electric cars</p>
<p>how often you need to eat in</p>
<p>california down here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so hot it&rsquo;s hot as fuck</p>
<p>but what is better hot as fuck or dry</p>
<p>black ice you know that scares</p>
<p>the shit i like hot as fuck i like</p>
<p>hot as fuck</p>
<p>hot as fuck</p>
<p>to me is better than you can&rsquo;t control your car</p>
<p>cause the fucking the whole</p>
<p>highway becomes</p>
<p>an ice skating</p>
<p>rink that&rsquo;s happened to me many times in boston</p>
<p>i fucking hate this when i grew up in boston</p>
<p>i drove every day</p>
<p>because i delivered newspapers when i was</p>
<p>fighting doing taekwondo to make</p>
<p>money i would deliver newspapers during the day</p>
<p>then i would</p>
<p>teach classes and</p>
<p>train and then i</p>
<p>would go and compete</p>
<p>so when i would get up in the morning</p>
<p>every morning at 5 am a lot of times</p>
<p>nobody had plowed nobody had done shit</p>
<p>and i would just be on just</p>
<p>i learned how to drive on</p>
<p>skating it was like a rink</p>
<p>like i would</p>
<p>slide around corners sideways on purpose</p>
<p>cause nobody was around like i knew how to handle it</p>
<p>after a while</p>
<p>but you boston bruins here</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t really like</p>
<p>sports you didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>sports yeah</p>
<p>i got bored with</p>
<p>sports when i was young</p>
<p>the moment i started</p>
<p>like doing martial arts i thought</p>
<p>sports were</p>
<p>stupid taekwondo what&rsquo;s the difference between that and</p>
<p>jiu jitsu taekwondo</p>
<p>is a striking art it&rsquo;s kicking</p>
<p>kicking kicking and</p>
<p>punching but mostly kicking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>he does throw</p>
<p>most of my life judo is</p>
<p>throwing yeah we talked</p>
<p>about that last</p>
<p>night i told</p>
<p>ricky how to kill somebody with a</p>
<p>leather jacket just</p>
<p>put your hand</p>
<p>under here i&rsquo;m telling him that</p>
<p>if a dude does</p>
<p>not understand jiu jitsu</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>asshole and he has a jacket on that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>learn the gi</p>
<p>learn how to use the gi in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>because you know a lot of times people wearing clothes</p>
<p>and if some guy is attacking you and he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>leather jacket</p>
<p>on all you have to do is get your hand up in there</p>
<p>under get your</p>
<p>hand on that collar</p>
<p>under here deep in</p>
<p>that collar on his neck and he&rsquo;s a dead man you&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>sounding because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna connect on the</p>
<p>other side you</p>
<p>go oh nighty</p>
<p>nighty nighty</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i need to know</p>
<p>i need to know that i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>teach you that environment i&rsquo;ll teach you that room</p>
<p>and then you just fuck with skiers all day bitch</p>
<p>come up here with them big</p>
<p>shoes on bitch</p>
<p>hang out snow lab just</p>
<p>but judo is the scariest</p>
<p>thing if a guy&rsquo;s got clothes on if a</p>
<p>guy you getting there with like some</p>
<p>fucking jimmy pedro type character some you know</p>
<p>olympic judoka</p>
<p>you grab a hold of your</p>
<p>clothes man you&rsquo;re going sailing through the air</p>
<p>and coming down on your fucking head on the concrete</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s no joke man is karate</p>
<p>pretty useless nowadays no</p>
<p>no karate&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely not useless there&rsquo;s a lot of take if you get</p>
<p>blacked out in karate</p>
<p>though no it</p>
<p>depends on who you&rsquo;re getting it from and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>ton of different</p>
<p>styles of karate</p>
<p>and even within those</p>
<p>styles there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s instructors that are much more</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re much more pure with</p>
<p>their technique they&rsquo;re better</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve competed in like international</p>
<p>world tournaments and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>going to get</p>
<p>levels there&rsquo;s karate</p>
<p>guys like machida</p>
<p>cheetah is a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker and his base is karate</p>
<p>and he does the best</p>
<p>things about karate</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a wide</p>
<p>stance he stays back on the outside he</p>
<p>counter attacks</p>
<p>he knows how to leap in and leap out very difficult</p>
<p>the time because of that and very good at like</p>
<p>leaping it almost like a fencer and tagging people he</p>
<p>fucks people up man and that&rsquo;s karate he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>using for real</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s excellent at it that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like karate is not the</p>
<p>best martial art but if you get really good at karate</p>
<p>and then learn the</p>
<p>other shit you</p>
<p>learn muay thai how to</p>
<p>check kicks how to</p>
<p>throw knees how to</p>
<p>take a guy down and</p>
<p>choke him you</p>
<p>learn some jiu</p>
<p>jitsu techniques fireballs</p>
<p>fireball i almost</p>
<p>said fatality</p>
<p>if you learn all that</p>
<p>stuff you can add to it but</p>
<p>the thing about like karate</p>
<p>that makes it interesting is that not</p>
<p>that many people are doing it</p>
<p>so if you get a guy who&rsquo;s a really good like</p>
<p>really good like</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different styles but</p>
<p>kyokoshin is</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s a real good one and shoto khan&rsquo;s another one</p>
<p>the shotokan guys</p>
<p>tend to be more like leap in and like drunken</p>
<p>drunken monkey</p>
<p>style yeah that shit&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>yeah drunken</p>
<p>monkey kung</p>
<p>fu that&rsquo;s real that shit dude well the chinese</p>
<p>tried everything man you know</p>
<p>they tried all kinds of different fucking</p>
<p>animal forms and grasshopper and attack like a praying</p>
<p>mantis and fucking poke you with your fingers and shit</p>
<p>chinese were like the most</p>
<p>innovative coming up with different techniques for</p>
<p>fighting what</p>
<p>about does old</p>
<p>school wrestling like</p>
<p>you know roman greck</p>
<p>and greco greco</p>
<p>roman greco</p>
<p>roman wrestling</p>
<p>that like jiu</p>
<p>jitsu though</p>
<p>well it is in the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s grappling</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it is in the fact that you&rsquo;re you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still controlling a person&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>but the intent is different but there was no end</p>
<p>point it&rsquo;s back</p>
<p>well it is they</p>
<p>beat the fuck out of you once they hold you down the</p>
<p>thing about a</p>
<p>wrestler is</p>
<p>once they get you on your back you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re used to their</p>
<p>whole life has been</p>
<p>dedicated to holding guys down and putting</p>
<p>their shoulders to</p>
<p>getting them yeah</p>
<p>so when they get on top of you and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>punching you they&rsquo;re holding you down and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>punching you and they&rsquo;re beating the fuck out of you</p>
<p>some of the most dangerous</p>
<p>fighters in the world are</p>
<p>wrestlers because of the fact they have the ability to</p>
<p>dictate where</p>
<p>the fight takes place if</p>
<p>they decide to take you down they take you down</p>
<p>and if you want</p>
<p>to take them down you can&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re better at</p>
<p>wrestling than you</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re fucked so you have to do what they want to do</p>
<p>if he wants to</p>
<p>fight on the ground you have to</p>
<p>fight on the ground</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge advantage so wrestling</p>
<p>has a big part</p>
<p>shoot yeah he&rsquo;s a wrestler yes definitely</p>
<p>wrestling&rsquo;s a big part of mma</p>
<p>and brock lesnar</p>
<p>was a wrestler wrestler</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s his number one skill</p>
<p>brock is learning submissions he&rsquo;s getting better at</p>
<p>submissions he&rsquo;s a incredible athlete</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s learning</p>
<p>striking he&rsquo;s getting better at it but his number one</p>
<p>skills wrestling number one for sure</p>
<p>well so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good he&rsquo;s really good at taking guys down so big</p>
<p>powerful fucking athletic guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got excellent</p>
<p>wrestling technique</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s learning all the</p>
<p>other stuff</p>
<p>wrestling is number one that&rsquo;s the base</p>
<p>the base it</p>
<p>sounds like yeah you just gotta</p>
<p>understand jujutsu so you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>trapped you don&rsquo;t get caught in certain techniques</p>
<p>cause some guys are fucking dangerous off</p>
<p>their back like</p>
<p>eddie eddie&rsquo;s very dangerous off his back yeah</p>
<p>whenever i roll with</p>
<p>eddie i only roll with him like</p>
<p>you know not that often but</p>
<p>every time i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m safe</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s on his back</p>
<p>and he catches me with something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like his legs are so dexterous he</p>
<p>really knows the the insides and outsides of each and</p>
<p>every position</p>
<p>but a lot of guys don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have that you know there&rsquo;s only a few like febreci</p>
<p>over doom the guy just tapped out fade or he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>that to even higher</p>
<p>level his guard is nasty</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s guys</p>
<p>that you just you can&rsquo;t get comfortable with you</p>
<p>get if you&rsquo;re on top of them</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get comfortable with</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re always attacking</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always setting you up and they&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>moving one step</p>
<p>ahead of you you zig when you</p>
<p>shoot a zag and all side</p>
<p>bang you got a triangle locked on</p>
<p>motherfucker you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>right then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to battle out of it but he knows</p>
<p>which way you&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>cause if you go that way he&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>counter you by holding your leg and pulling that up</p>
<p>and now he attacks</p>
<p>your arm then he attacks the triangle next</p>
<p>thing you know you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>yeah because he&rsquo;s just got this high</p>
<p>level shit but</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting those guys</p>
<p>the most wrestlers are</p>
<p>gonna be able to pin a guy down and hold him down</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>skill to have</p>
<p>i mean you must outweight</p>
<p>eddie by forty pounds</p>
<p>no not that much</p>
<p>twenty and he&rsquo;s like one</p>
<p>seventy i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>one eighty five i</p>
<p>think eddie&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>one sixty five</p>
<p>i bet she&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>sixty five so what do you one</p>
<p>one eighty five one ninety</p>
<p>for twenty five</p>
<p>pounds yeah it&rsquo;s and i&rsquo;m a lot</p>
<p>stronger than him</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s big and man i can&rsquo;t top them i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never tapped them i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve ever come</p>
<p>close well i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>only made him</p>
<p>stronger i&rsquo;ve made a wing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never made him like</p>
<p>one day will you</p>
<p>who knows is he ticklish most likely he&rsquo;ll tap me</p>
<p>again i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>put nearly as much time into it as he does he</p>
<p>teaches classes</p>
<p>every day and he</p>
<p>trains every day</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>training when he teaches</p>
<p>classes four</p>
<p>nights a week</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a knee injury</p>
<p>right now so he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>training but</p>
<p>when he does he&rsquo;s always rolling he rolls constantly</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m lucky i get</p>
<p>three days a weekend</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m lucky and</p>
<p>teaching too teaching</p>
<p>a lot of guys like there&rsquo;s a dude</p>
<p>named brent at our</p>
<p>school who was really good but then he</p>
<p>started teaching and he became great</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about teaching people when you really</p>
<p>dissect the techniques</p>
<p>they say that one of the best ways to improve your</p>
<p>jiu jitsu game is</p>
<p>to teach it to somebody else is that that tall</p>
<p>light skinned</p>
<p>black guy no brent is a</p>
<p>heavy set white guy</p>
<p>ok big really smart dude</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a brown belt</p>
<p>under eddie and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a high</p>
<p>level brown belt when he</p>
<p>first started out he was just a regular guy</p>
<p>just another dude who was</p>
<p>always good</p>
<p>and talented</p>
<p>but when he</p>
<p>started teaching all of a</p>
<p>sudden he started taking off</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a handful</p>
<p>very dangerous guy</p>
<p>and every time i roll with them i&rsquo;m like whoa</p>
<p>is there certain guys that you roll with</p>
<p>where you just</p>
<p>gotta watch your fucking p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s trying to kill you</p>
<p>one thing i</p>
<p>learned real</p>
<p>quick was you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>either all in or all out two hands in or two hands out</p>
<p>if you got one hand in you know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on top</p>
<p>and you put one hand in</p>
<p>they can somehow</p>
<p>try they can</p>
<p>sure yeah grab your left</p>
<p>grab your arm and trap it yeah you got to be all in</p>
<p>right is that true yes but</p>
<p>even all in you got to be careful if you get a guy like</p>
<p>febreze over doom</p>
<p>and he controls both your</p>
<p>wrists you&rsquo;re fucked you got a lot of problems</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna attack both ways and</p>
<p>as you defend one way he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna attack the other way</p>
<p>if he controls your</p>
<p>wrist at all you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important you get risk control</p>
<p>jiu jitsu is</p>
<p>such a tactical fun</p>
<p>thing to do because</p>
<p>as you do it it&rsquo;s very frustrating it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>remember when you</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>and you said the frustrating</p>
<p>thing is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no end to this it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go on forever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna take forever to get good at it</p>
<p>know yeah it&rsquo;s just a lot of devotion</p>
<p>to something that</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to go on forever doing and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna take</p>
<p>forever and you see a guy you know like joey diaz</p>
<p>how the fuck am i ever</p>
<p>gonna get that</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s gonna take 15 years for me i&rsquo;m too old</p>
<p>for that now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the same feeling with</p>
<p>jiu jitsu when you</p>
<p>first start out you have to enjoy</p>
<p>each little</p>
<p>miniature battle that you win</p>
<p>every new lesson that you learn</p>
<p>but the most humbling thing</p>
<p>about it is</p>
<p>as you do it you realize how little you know</p>
<p>yeah i know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many guys that are so much better</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like decent</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many guys that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all talking</p>
<p>about marcelo garcia last night</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of the best probably the best grappler in the</p>
<p>world really technical</p>
<p>not like this brutish</p>
<p>powerful guy but just all technique and he&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>brazilian dude</p>
<p>super super smart dude</p>
<p>super nice guy too and just fucks everybody up</p>
<p>and his videos of him online just</p>
<p>smashing guys</p>
<p>just taking</p>
<p>these really like high</p>
<p>level wrestlers really</p>
<p>tough guys and just running through them</p>
<p>just choking them choking a little fuck out</p>
<p>no jujitsu guy</p>
<p>okay over and over and over again</p>
<p>you know and you</p>
<p>watch this guy just</p>
<p>running through people like</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m in full guard like</p>
<p>when somebody&rsquo;s got me</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m above someone and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got me</p>
<p>is it called they&rsquo;ve got me in full guard</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got you in the guard they</p>
<p>got me in the guard</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even have a good move yet to</p>
<p>break out of the guard</p>
<p>to get on side control</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know that well you know</p>
<p>i can show you some</p>
<p>stuff there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>techniques you have a few go to moves yeah yeah like</p>
<p>yeah by a gun</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a game man it&rsquo;s a game</p>
<p>if you treat</p>
<p>it look if you</p>
<p>treat it like penn and teller did this</p>
<p>thing on martial arts</p>
<p>where they said that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re better off saving your</p>
<p>money and then giving it to the mugger</p>
<p>saving the money that you would</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about not getting mugged what martial arts are</p>
<p>about is like it&rsquo;s a very difficult</p>
<p>thing that makes your character</p>
<p>stronger when you</p>
<p>learn martial arts</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is you&rsquo;re doing this incredibly difficult</p>
<p>thing and when you do that you learn</p>
<p>about yourself</p>
<p>and other things become easier</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s humbling</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s very humbling it&rsquo;s humbling when some guys</p>
<p>that you know</p>
<p>you look at it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look like much but man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re tapping now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s humbling dude it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>freaky feeling it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>freaky feeling to have guys dominate you and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>freaky feeling to dominate guys too it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a much</p>
<p>better feeling it is better but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird to feel people nervous and</p>
<p>freaking out and</p>
<p>like when they first</p>
<p>start doing it and shit and there&rsquo;s like you know they</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re tough guys</p>
<p>and they they</p>
<p>realize like you&rsquo;re closing in like this is getting</p>
<p>to a position where fuck</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not getting out of this you know you got the dude</p>
<p>mounted and he&rsquo;s bucking and trying to</p>
<p>explode all his energy but</p>
<p>every time you do it you</p>
<p>counter nope not</p>
<p>going anywhere</p>
<p>right not going anywhere stay here</p>
<p>squash you and you</p>
<p>start slowly</p>
<p>squishing them and</p>
<p>squashing them</p>
<p>and you feel them</p>
<p>panicking you feel them start to</p>
<p>freak out with it like</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>admit that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna kill them</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what it is they have to tap out and they have to say</p>
<p>okay i give it you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna kill me right</p>
<p>thank you for not killing me and then you go again</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the craziest game ever</p>
<p>and you guys you get better as you get better at it you</p>
<p>understand that it&rsquo;s really all about</p>
<p>focus and energy</p>
<p>and trying to put all the techniques together</p>
<p>but then once you get them all together like once you</p>
<p>drill them all</p>
<p>and you get them as a part of your repertoire</p>
<p>then it just becomes this</p>
<p>crazy zen thing</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know what you&rsquo;re doing when you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>countering and attacking and</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it all plays itself out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>drill you drill techniques to a certain point</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re rolling</p>
<p>they all just come out natural then it&rsquo;s crazy fun</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s really fun actually</p>
<p>and especially</p>
<p>when you go with another guy who&rsquo;s really good too</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re just battling</p>
<p>back and forth encountering back and forth about</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even have time to think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not thinking</p>
<p>about your bills you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thinking about shit</p>
<p>no you&rsquo;re not thinking</p>
<p>about you know your dog you&rsquo;re not thinking</p>
<p>about you&rsquo;re tired that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re there in that moment</p>
<p>but like in a zen</p>
<p>way we&rsquo;re not even thinking</p>
<p>about yourself</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s so difficult</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the time to the wander on your bullshit you have to</p>
<p>keep your eye on this guy&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>choke the fuck out of you</p>
<p>i get out it&rsquo;s have you been brian</p>
<p>no no i just i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like croquet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not for him</p>
<p>he likes cats</p>
<p>cats and croquet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not for everybody man but i knew it</p>
<p>would be for you i&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re doing i knew it</p>
<p>would be for you totally loving man</p>
<p>loving it because</p>
<p>especially when you tell me stories</p>
<p>we went to dinner over his</p>
<p>house and he tells me stories about</p>
<p>trying to jack dudes and</p>
<p>fucking backing up into him on the highway and getting</p>
<p>crazy on venice</p>
<p>beach is the</p>
<p>story i told you</p>
<p>about yeah you told me that</p>
<p>story too i&rsquo;m with</p>
<p>my wife and kids</p>
<p>going on venice beach and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m on a bike and this</p>
<p>other kid on a</p>
<p>skateboard 20 years old we kind of bumped into each</p>
<p>other by accident nobody&rsquo;s fault</p>
<p>and so we kind of untangled each</p>
<p>other from each</p>
<p>other and i decided to go on my way and</p>
<p>as he&rsquo;s leaving he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know stupid</p>
<p>motherfucker get out of my way next time</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>twenty years old</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like fuck you asshole</p>
<p>and immediately he turns around and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i challenged him i</p>
<p>guess by saying that</p>
<p>and immediately</p>
<p>turns around but he&rsquo;s got like four friends with him</p>
<p>all twenty years old</p>
<p>and my wife is like</p>
<p>rick what you&rsquo;re such a dick for</p>
<p>responding to that</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like well</p>
<p>how can i not i mean the kids</p>
<p>twenty years old i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>forty just you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>treat people like that</p>
<p>you know in</p>
<p>the world but you</p>
<p>gotta you gotta recognize</p>
<p>i understand that but you got to recognize that</p>
<p>these kids a lot of them have nothing to lose</p>
<p>and their reputation means too much totally</p>
<p>the reputation means</p>
<p>anything so if you not around kids like that if you</p>
<p>if you challenge a kid like that like he a lot of in la</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t consciously though do it was</p>
<p>instinctual</p>
<p>just to respond</p>
<p>course man i&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>worst i&rsquo;m captain caveman</p>
<p>when i get any</p>
<p>issue like that i have to fight off</p>
<p>every that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>biggest weakness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my biggest</p>
<p>weakness actually is natural it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not reacting</p>
<p>instead of like</p>
<p>responding yeah</p>
<p>legally it&rsquo;s not an</p>
<p>issue i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think because he&rsquo;s fucking with you</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>starting with you and fucking but that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>issue but the</p>
<p>issue is your health and</p>
<p>safety yeah</p>
<p>they could stab</p>
<p>you or hurt</p>
<p>you in situations</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>for sure for sure really not even</p>
<p>jiu jitsu because you don&rsquo;t want to grapple</p>
<p>with a guy like that</p>
<p>you want to fucking one tomb you want to</p>
<p>put bank yeah put him to</p>
<p>sleep and then charge at the next guy</p>
<p>and just let him know this is how</p>
<p>quick i can put this dude to sleep</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna get you next yeah</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the last</p>
<p>thing anybody wants is one dude</p>
<p>knocking out everybody</p>
<p>so when they when</p>
<p>if you have</p>
<p>to attack somebody you&rsquo;re better off way better off</p>
<p>learning how to</p>
<p>strike you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna like go yeah</p>
<p>watch me pull</p>
<p>guard bitch</p>
<p>on your back the other</p>
<p>three dudes are fucking soccer kicking you in the dick</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not the best</p>
<p>thing to learn</p>
<p>some crap if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of people the best</p>
<p>thing to have is fast fucking hands</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be able to just</p>
<p>light somebody up just pop bank</p>
<p>cause if you want to somebody</p>
<p>especially in the street</p>
<p>especially if they don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>fight when that</p>
<p>punch actually lands pop bam and</p>
<p>their eyes roll back in their head</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>gonna expect a that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to hit them that hard b</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be able to do it that quick</p>
<p>like most dudes have</p>
<p>never really boxed they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never really been punched</p>
<p>know so if you can just find one dude and pop</p>
<p>bank just put</p>
<p>that dude to</p>
<p>sleep the other guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go oh fuck this</p>
<p>right and you</p>
<p>can get him to scatter but if you try to do some</p>
<p>jiu jitsu they</p>
<p>should have a</p>
<p>movie like the karate</p>
<p>kid but for</p>
<p>jiu jitsu like the</p>
<p>jiu jitsu kid</p>
<p>where the guy&rsquo;s just really good at</p>
<p>jiu jitsu like this little kid</p>
<p>could make it more like a</p>
<p>cause jiu jitsu</p>
<p>well jujutsu</p>
<p>and martial art it&rsquo;s kind of weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>the jujutsu is a real</p>
<p>martial art in the</p>
<p>sense that you can</p>
<p>defeat a much bigger</p>
<p>stronger more</p>
<p>athletic person it&rsquo;s very hard to do that with striking</p>
<p>but you can it can be done if a guy&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>elite striker and he&rsquo;s facing a guy who&rsquo;s not an</p>
<p>elite striker that&rsquo;s much like dan henderson</p>
<p>right elite</p>
<p>striker dan henderson is really a</p>
<p>wrestler he&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>powerful striker</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not in the line of saying anderson</p>
<p>silva anderson</p>
<p>silva is like an</p>
<p>elite striker</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a guy who</p>
<p>really knows</p>
<p>the intricacies</p>
<p>of the stand up game</p>
<p>dan henderson does as well</p>
<p>but you know he&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>known as a wrestler because</p>
<p>i saw him take out that british guy with one punch</p>
<p>oh yeah well he can</p>
<p>knock anybody out</p>
<p>with one big</p>
<p>spin yeah he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>super power in his hands</p>
<p>he can knock anybody he</p>
<p>knocked out vandal</p>
<p>silva with one punch</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s knocked out a lot of guys with one punch</p>
<p>you know but he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>known as a striker</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>known as like you know a technical</p>
<p>strike what</p>
<p>about chuck</p>
<p>liddell yes he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a striker he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>striker is he</p>
<p>fighting again</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think he has maybe</p>
<p>you think so yeah yeah maybe</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your time becomes up</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s up it&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>he had one of the</p>
<p>greatest careers of all time</p>
<p>you know i just</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s think at a certain</p>
<p>point in time you have to be concerned</p>
<p>about your health</p>
<p>you know you have to be concerned</p>
<p>about how many</p>
<p>knockouts you take and</p>
<p>concern about your</p>
<p>future you have this fucking incredible amazing career</p>
<p>the problem</p>
<p>is you know you have that kind of fire burning</p>
<p>inside you it&rsquo;s very difficult to turn that shit off</p>
<p>you know very</p>
<p>very very very very difficult to turn that shit off</p>
<p>those guys like you know they&rsquo;re nuts</p>
<p>their whole fucking</p>
<p>system is wired for competition</p>
<p>whole system is</p>
<p>wired for combat</p>
<p>for the moment for getting to that cage</p>
<p>under the bright</p>
<p>lights and performing</p>
<p>you know their whole</p>
<p>self esteem is</p>
<p>based on you know</p>
<p>their ability to rise to a</p>
<p>place that most men can ever get to</p>
<p>you think they</p>
<p>could transfer that easily there like</p>
<p>start playing a</p>
<p>video games or</p>
<p>start doing something else</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>listen man i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think as we</p>
<p>as civilians</p>
<p>could ever possibly</p>
<p>understand the highs</p>
<p>it must be when</p>
<p>chuck liddell</p>
<p>fucking throws his arm back and</p>
<p>pushes his chest out and</p>
<p>screams ah after he</p>
<p>knocks people out</p>
<p>like after he</p>
<p>knocked randy kotor</p>
<p>out i mean randy kotor&rsquo;s one of the baddest</p>
<p>motherfuckers on the planet and he connects</p>
<p>bam and randy goes down and</p>
<p>that high is probably cocaine</p>
<p>times a billion</p>
<p>you know yeah it&rsquo;s probably insane it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>he probably</p>
<p>never feels more</p>
<p>alive he probably</p>
<p>never feels more</p>
<p>energetic more</p>
<p>you know fulfilled</p>
<p>this incredible</p>
<p>eight week training camp</p>
<p>every day waking</p>
<p>up for this one moment and finally it comes</p>
<p>against one of the baddest</p>
<p>motherfuckers on the planet</p>
<p>in front of 16 000 people in a fucking</p>
<p>arena and everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going crazy</p>
<p>and your punch connect yeah</p>
<p>they live for that yeah they live for it the iceman</p>
<p>the cow goes nutty and they</p>
<p>strap the belt on them</p>
<p>and then they ask</p>
<p>them you know so what&rsquo;s next anybody i don&rsquo;t care i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>fight anybody i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>fight anybody in the</p>
<p>world i like to fight</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to step down from that i</p>
<p>think i think that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a high like you have in comedy</p>
<p>no not even</p>
<p>close no comedies</p>
<p>more just fun we&rsquo;re having a good time but aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you as nice as</p>
<p>yes you sure</p>
<p>you have fun it&rsquo;s a different kind of high though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not nearly as</p>
<p>is crazy it&rsquo;s not nearly as primal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more fun</p>
<p>enjoyable everybody having a positive</p>
<p>experience together we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>partying we&rsquo;re all having</p>
<p>a good time you know i&rsquo;m telling you some comedy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>laughing we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>enjoying our time together it&rsquo;s all fun</p>
<p>fighting is much more</p>
<p>you trying to master something</p>
<p>it just so happens there&rsquo;s an audience there</p>
<p>watching it but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a totally different</p>
<p>experience very inward</p>
<p>you trying to overcome some guys physical strengths and</p>
<p>pose your will on them and</p>
<p>pose your conditioning and your preparation on them</p>
<p>way crazy different way crazier</p>
<p>comedy is like</p>
<p>everyday normal bullshit</p>
<p>like to me i can go on</p>
<p>stage right now if there was an open mic</p>
<p>right next door</p>
<p>and then you know</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re doing the podcast someone said hey joe you</p>
<p>wanna do ten minutes like</p>
<p>yeah yeah i&rsquo;ll go up come on i&rsquo;ll go up</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll just go up and</p>
<p>start fucking what&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on i&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>stand up just</p>
<p>going into my act</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>fight you know</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t say hey do you want a cage</p>
<p>fight in ten minutes</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;d be like no i need like ten months and</p>
<p>i got to talk to my mom</p>
<p>fucking get a</p>
<p>nutritionist man i got to make</p>
<p>sure my strength and conditioning programs in order</p>
<p>fuck who am i</p>
<p>fighting is you a striker</p>
<p>wrestler i got to</p>
<p>prepare my you know what am i</p>
<p>strategy i want to fight a</p>
<p>striker how i get fucked up</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>are you way</p>
<p>scarier where you</p>
<p>gonna fight no no why not</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not healthy</p>
<p>yeah because i</p>
<p>you must i love you must want to</p>
<p>fight you must want to</p>
<p>fight to do it</p>
<p>i did a lot of competition martial arts competition was</p>
<p>young where i</p>
<p>enjoyed it but i got out of it without any</p>
<p>complications physically</p>
<p>because of injuries or</p>
<p>knockouts or anything like that</p>
<p>but i knew people who did</p>
<p>i knew people had complications</p>
<p>i knew people who had</p>
<p>brain damage for sure from boxing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s compromised</p>
<p>how they talk it&rsquo;s compromised</p>
<p>how they can</p>
<p>think and make reason</p>
<p>reasonable decisions</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve met people like that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>wrong with fighting i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to live forever and i</p>
<p>think every man</p>
<p>should be allowed to make his own decisions as</p>
<p>to what he wants to do and how long he wants to compete</p>
<p>how many knockouts</p>
<p>he wants to take and how much risk he wants</p>
<p>to put his body it&rsquo;s up to you it&rsquo;s your choice why</p>
<p>is it that you can go and do</p>
<p>motorcycle riding</p>
<p>you can run</p>
<p>between the fucking lanes and traffic and that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>but you know you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a guy can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>knocked out more than</p>
<p>three times you can do whatever the fuck you want</p>
<p>but for me i think</p>
<p>i think if you were</p>
<p>going to put yourself at risk there</p>
<p>should be an end</p>
<p>point to it</p>
<p>and to me it&rsquo;s like what am i</p>
<p>going to do i want to be the best guy in the</p>
<p>world no am i</p>
<p>gonna win a couple of fights</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>gonna prove you know well you know</p>
<p>the thrill of competition yeah</p>
<p>and maybe getting your fucking face broken</p>
<p>again maybe</p>
<p>getting i&rsquo;ve had my nose</p>
<p>fixed recently</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking awesome i love having my nose</p>
<p>again yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great my whole life i have fucked up jammed up nose i</p>
<p>broke my nose</p>
<p>falling down a flight of</p>
<p>stairs when i was five</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;ve been kicked and</p>
<p>punched in the face</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how many times my</p>
<p>whole life so it was all fucked but it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have anything to prove</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>because you are</p>
<p>tough but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>silly there&rsquo;s a lot of that</p>
<p>out there that can kick my ass</p>
<p>the needing to</p>
<p>prove thing it</p>
<p>should all be you know</p>
<p>no one should need to</p>
<p>prove anything and if you do need to</p>
<p>prove something to you</p>
<p>you just find out more</p>
<p>about yourself</p>
<p>you know when you need to</p>
<p>prove something</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s guys out there that are trying to</p>
<p>start fights or guys that are you know</p>
<p>that have a chip on their</p>
<p>shoulder what they need to do is</p>
<p>get more positive</p>
<p>experiences in</p>
<p>their life get more things</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve accomplished</p>
<p>their emotions</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve conquered</p>
<p>their emotions and</p>
<p>accomplished</p>
<p>a goal that seemed really difficult to do and they</p>
<p>understand more</p>
<p>about themselves</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things about like mma</p>
<p>fighters like some of the best guys in the</p>
<p>world they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>super friendly</p>
<p>george st pierre</p>
<p>is one of the nicest people i have ever met in my life</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s one of the baddest</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>pound for pound on the planet insane he&rsquo;s so kind</p>
<p>and so friendly and genuine</p>
<p>and the reason is he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have anything to</p>
<p>prove to anybody he</p>
<p>proves it to himself</p>
<p>in competition he</p>
<p>proves it to himself in</p>
<p>training he</p>
<p>proves it to himself with discipline</p>
<p>forcing himself to do the hard work to become</p>
<p>great and he is</p>
<p>great and recognizes great</p>
<p>so because of that he&rsquo;s like balanced and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>super healthy</p>
<p>super calm person to be around</p>
<p>a couple years ago i</p>
<p>watched him</p>
<p>fight against that brazilian guy</p>
<p>and it was a</p>
<p>great fight</p>
<p>tiago silva</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>it was alves</p>
<p>rather excuse me</p>
<p>yeah and it was a tie</p>
<p>striker yeah and that guy was</p>
<p>strong oh yeah</p>
<p>and he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>send him a monster</p>
<p>saint pierre couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>submit him knows a</p>
<p>yeah went the distance yeah alvez is he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>beast but he has a problem</p>
<p>making weight didn&rsquo;t make way for his last</p>
<p>fight again</p>
<p>rematch with john fitch</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t look that good physically he looked like</p>
<p>he looked like he was a little</p>
<p>hurt by the weight cut because he&rsquo;s so big</p>
<p>in real life he&rsquo;s supposed to</p>
<p>fight at 170</p>
<p>but he walks around over 200</p>
<p>oh my god so</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s cutting he&rsquo;s dehydrating himself like 30 pounds</p>
<p>and then trying to replenish himself</p>
<p>and it just</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a</p>
<p>point of point of</p>
<p>diminishing returns</p>
<p>where you cut</p>
<p>so much weight and you dehydrate yourself so much</p>
<p>that your performance</p>
<p>is gonna suffer yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just so big</p>
<p>he was giant</p>
<p>these guys are</p>
<p>giant for 170</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gigantic</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a fucking bull of a man</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s just got to lose some</p>
<p>weight he&rsquo;s got to lose some muscle she got too much</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s so funny</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a bull of a man that&rsquo;s what he is that&rsquo;s bull</p>
<p>he is a bull</p>
<p>what would you call the raw</p>
<p>power what would you call</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very nice gentleman</p>
<p>a nice gentleman</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a nice gentleman</p>
<p>of flavor of muscles i saw this</p>
<p>picture of a chimp</p>
<p>carrying fruit it was an old female chimp</p>
<p>and she had</p>
<p>fruit in her hands and</p>
<p>fruit in her feet</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>carrying like these</p>
<p>things and she&rsquo;s like flexing</p>
<p>and i looked at him like holy fuck</p>
<p>have you ever seen like a full</p>
<p>grown male chimpanzee or female chimpanzee</p>
<p>full grown how big</p>
<p>their fucking arms are</p>
<p>holy shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary is muscle</p>
<p>gigantic her arms were gigantic</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re that</p>
<p>crazy sinewy</p>
<p>chimp muscle too</p>
<p>which is nothing like</p>
<p>human muscle</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking trippy</p>
<p>photograph when you realize that chimp</p>
<p>could just beat the fuck out of you</p>
<p>remember that anytime she wants it</p>
<p>ate that girl&rsquo;s face off</p>
<p>that was brutal</p>
<p>talk about chimps</p>
<p>every week my friend</p>
<p>went to sturges this</p>
<p>motorcycle rally joe</p>
<p>the whole time she&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>at i think like</p>
<p>four or five people died</p>
<p>within like two days and the guys the people at the</p>
<p>thing say you know this happens</p>
<p>every year people die</p>
<p>like almost every day</p>
<p>and the last day she was there</p>
<p>this guy was</p>
<p>doing where they</p>
<p>rev up the engines really fast or whatever it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>i forget what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called but it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re just revving up</p>
<p>their engines really fast</p>
<p>something happened and his</p>
<p>motorcycle blew up</p>
<p>and he got decapitated something flew out of his engine</p>
<p>oh shit son</p>
<p>and you know what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking this is how dangerous</p>
<p>motorcycles</p>
<p>are fucking how many people die at this like</p>
<p>motorcycle thing but yet there was a car show</p>
<p>for you know</p>
<p>every day for</p>
<p>the last 50 years in burbank and no one&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>had a car well the thing</p>
<p>about those</p>
<p>motorcycle shows is that a lot of</p>
<p>those dudes they get</p>
<p>crazy and they want to show off for each</p>
<p>other right</p>
<p>start they start</p>
<p>standing on</p>
<p>their bikes you ever seen guys surf with</p>
<p>their motorcycle</p>
<p>yeah there was this old dude who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>motorcycle maker</p>
<p>i forget his name he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>famous guy but he was</p>
<p>famous for being able</p>
<p>to ride his</p>
<p>motorcycle like a surfboard</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;d get that</p>
<p>bitch on the highway</p>
<p>leveled out</p>
<p>straight it out and then</p>
<p>stand on top of it and he was fucking</p>
<p>standing it and</p>
<p>his feet fell</p>
<p>oh he fell and that&rsquo;s a wrap son</p>
<p>it was like cod</p>
<p>you deserve what you get when you&rsquo;re doing that well</p>
<p>no helmet too</p>
<p>oh no helmet</p>
<p>excuse me so</p>
<p>stupid so he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>living out there on the edge and he just lost it and</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s the way he wanted to go you know who knows</p>
<p>i mean everybody kind of</p>
<p>recognized it</p>
<p>people didn&rsquo;t make fun of him and say oh you fucking</p>
<p>idiot that&rsquo;s what you deserved</p>
<p>everybody said hey died doing what he loved</p>
<p>i guess okay</p>
<p>i mean what you know really realistically what are you</p>
