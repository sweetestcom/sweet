    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today is an Ask Me Anything, or AMA episode,</p>
<p>which is part of our premium subscriber content.</p>
<p>Our premium channel was launched</p>
<p>in order to raise support</p>
<p>for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,</p>
<p>which still comes out once a week, every Monday,</p>
<p>and of course is zero cost to consumer.</p>
<p>The premium channel is also designed</p>
<p>to support exciting research being done</p>
<p>at major universities like Stanford and elsewhere,</p>
<p>research that&rsquo;s done on humans</p>
<p>that should lead to protocols for mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance in the near future.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to check out</p>
<p>the premium channel subscription model,</p>
<p>you can go to hubermanlab.com slash premium,</p>
<p>and there you can subscribe for $10 a month</p>
<p>or $100 a year.</p>
<p>We also have a lifetime subscriber option.</p>
<p>For those of you that are already</p>
<p>Huberman Lab Podcast premium subscribers</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re watching and or hearing this,</p>
<p>please go to hubermanlab.com slash premium</p>
<p>and download the premium podcast feed.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are not already</p>
<p>Huberman Lab premium podcast subscribers,</p>
<p>you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so</p>
<p>of this episode,</p>
<p>and hopefully that will allow you to discern</p>
<p>whether or not you would like to become</p>
<p>a premium subscriber.</p>
<p>Without further ado,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get to answering your questions.</p>
<p>And as always, I will strive to be as clear as possible,</p>
<p>as succinct as possible, and as thorough as possible,</p>
<p>while still answering as many questions per AMA episode</p>
<p>as I can without these sessions</p>
<p>becoming unreasonably long.</p>
<p>I should also point out that if you asked a question</p>
<p>and it was not answered this AMA,</p>
<p>it may very well be answered in the next AMA.</p>
<p>So the first question, which had a lot of upvotes,</p>
<p>meaning many people wanted the answer to this question,</p>
<p>came from Jackson Lipfort.</p>
<p>And the question was about so-called ultradian rhythms.</p>
<p>For those of you that are not familiar</p>
<p>with ultradian rhythms,</p>
<p>ultradian rhythms are any rhythms</p>
<p>that are shorter than 24 hours.</p>
<p>And typically when people ask about</p>
<p>or talk about ultradian rhythms,</p>
<p>they are referring to 90 minute rhythms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about these on the podcast before.</p>
<p>And Jackson&rsquo;s question was,</p>
<p>how do you use ultradian rhythms in your daily work?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more to the question, but first off,</p>
<p>I do use ultradian rhythms.</p>
<p>That is, I leverage the fact that these do exist</p>
<p>in all of us as a way to engage in focused bouts</p>
<p>of mental work once or twice,</p>
<p>or sometimes three times per day.</p>
<p>However, I use them in a way that&rsquo;s grounded</p>
<p>in the research on ultradian rhythms for learning and memory</p>
<p>in a way that might not be obvious just from their name,</p>
<p>that they are 90 minute rhythms.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll get into the details of how to use ultradian rhythms</p>
<p>to best capture neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>that is the brain&rsquo;s ability to change</p>
<p>in response to experience,</p>
<p>and in a way that should allow you to get one or two,</p>
<p>or maybe even three focused bouts of learning per day,</p>
<p>which can greatly accelerate learning of cognitive material,</p>
<p>languages, mathematics, history for sake of school or work,</p>
<p>or maybe just a hobby or a personal interest of some sort,</p>
<p>and for skill learning in the physical domain as well.</p>
<p>Jackson then went on to ask,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve mentioned before that you try to include</p>
<p>at least one 90 minute focus block per day</p>
<p>as part of your work and overall mission.</p>
<p>And indeed that is true.</p>
<p>I try to get at least one of these</p>
<p>focused ultradian rhythm blocks per day.</p>
<p>That is a period of about 90 minutes</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m focused on learning something</p>
<p>or doing something that&rsquo;s cognitively hard.</p>
<p>Although typically I aim for two of these sessions per day.</p>
<p>He then goes on to ask,</p>
<p>what is the maximum number of blocks</p>
<p>you can perform sustainably?</p>
<p>The answer to that is probably four.</p>
<p>And I say probably because some people have schedules,</p>
<p>lifestyles in which four 90 minute blocks</p>
<p>of focused learning is possible per day,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s highly unusual.</p>
<p>For most people, it&rsquo;s going to be one or two, maybe three,</p>
<p>four I would place in the really extraordinary end of things.</p>
<p>Maybe if you&rsquo;re cramming for exams</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve managed to go on a writing retreat</p>
<p>or a learning retreat of some sort</p>
<p>where you can devote essentially all of your non-sleeping,</p>
<p>non-eating time to learning,</p>
<p>but most people simply can&rsquo;t organize their life that way.</p>
<p>So the short answer is for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one or two per day is the target</p>
<p>and three would be the maximum.</p>
<p>He then went on to ask,</p>
<p>do you take vacations or extended breaks</p>
<p>from these Ultradian Rhythm sessions?</p>
<p>And the short answer is no.</p>
<p>Typically I try and do this every day</p>
<p>and yes, even on the weekends,</p>
<p>but on the weekend,</p>
<p>the Ultradian Rhythm focused learning about</p>
<p>might just be reading a book for about 90 minutes or so,</p>
<p>which might not be as cognitively difficult</p>
<p>as it is for other sorts of work</p>
<p>that I perform during the week.</p>
<p>I occasionally miss a day entirely for whatever reason,</p>
<p>travel, obligations related to family, et cetera.</p>
<p>But in general, I try and do this every day.</p>
<p>I do think that the circuits for focus are,</p>
<p>I guess the non-biological way to put it</p>
<p>would be kept warm,</p>
<p>but essentially that accessing the circuits for focus</p>
<p>is made easier by accessing them regularly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the circuits for focus</p>
<p>are indeed themselves amenable to neuroplasticity</p>
<p>the more you force yourself to focus,</p>
<p>the easier focusing gets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll now answer the last part of the question</p>
<p>and then I will go through and emphasize some tools</p>
<p>that anyone can use in order to leverage Ultradian Rhythms</p>
<p>toward learning about either cognitive learning</p>
<p>or physical skill learning or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>The last part of the question Jackson asked was,</p>
<p>if you knew you needed to drastically increase</p>
<p>the amount of focus you do daily,</p>
<p>how would you schedule that focus and recover from it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent aspect to this question.</p>
<p>And I will now give you the details of how I would use</p>
<p>and schedule Ultradian Rhythms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll offer you a tool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never talked about this tool</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>And I will dispel a common myth about Ultradian Rhythms</p>
<p>that points to a, believe it or not,</p>
<p>an easier way to leverage them for maximum benefit.</p>
<p>Okay, so as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>Ultradian Rhythms are these 90 minute cycles</p>
<p>that we go through from the time that we are born</p>
<p>until the time we die.</p>
<p>Indeed, even during sleep, we are experiencing</p>
<p>and more or less governed by these Ultradian Rhythms.</p>
<p>This question and this answer is not so much about sleep,</p>
<p>but just know that when you go to sleep at night</p>
<p>until you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>every 90 minutes or so your patterns of sleep,</p>
<p>that is the percentage or ratio rather of slow wave sleep</p>
<p>to light sleep to rapid eye movement sleep changes</p>
<p>in a way such that each 90 minute cycle</p>
<p>gates the next cycle.</p>
<p>It sort of flips the on switch</p>
<p>for the next 90 minute cycle,</p>
<p>then that 90 minute cycle ends,</p>
<p>flips the on switch for the next one</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I mention all that because during the daytime,</p>
<p>the same thing is true,</p>
<p>but most people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>when the 90 minute Ultradian cycles begin.</p>
<p>Because if you think about it,</p>
<p>you could wake up on the basis of an alarm clock</p>
<p>or noise in the room,</p>
<p>or simply because you naturally wake up</p>
<p>in the middle of an Ultradian 90 minute cycle.</p>
<p>So does that mean, for instance,</p>
<p>that if you wake up 60 minutes into an Ultradian cycle,</p>
<p>that the next 30 minutes of your waking, right?</p>
<p>Because that 60 minutes needs to continue to 90</p>
<p>to complete an Ultradian cycle,</p>
<p>that the next 30 minutes after waking</p>
<p>are related to the Ultradian cycle</p>
<p>that you were still in during sleep?</p>
<p>Or does it start a new Ultradian cycle?</p>
<p>And the answer is the former.</p>
<p>That Ultradian cycle continues</p>
<p>even if you wake up in the middle of it.</p>
<p>And so a lot of people</p>
<p>who want to leverage Ultradian cycles for learning</p>
<p>will say, well, how do I know when to start?</p>
<p>When does it start?</p>
<p>When I hit my stopwatch?</p>
<p>Can I just set a clock and work for 90 minutes?</p>
<p>And the short answer is no.</p>
<p>And that might seem unfortunate,</p>
<p>but the good news is that you can figure out</p>
<p>when your first proper Ultradian cycle of the day begins</p>
<p>simply by asking yourself,</p>
<p>when are you most alert after waking?</p>
<p>That is if you were say to wake up at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s the end of an Ultradian cycle,</p>
<p>or perhaps you&rsquo;re in the middle of an Ultradian cycle,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What you need to watch for</p>
<p>or pay attention to for a day or so</p>
<p>is when you start to experience</p>
<p>your greatest state of mental alertness in the morning.</p>
<p>And here we can discard with all the issues</p>
<p>and variables around caffeine or no caffeine,</p>
<p>hydrating or no hydrating.</p>
<p>Exercise is one variable that we&rsquo;ll consider in a moment,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>These Ultradian cycles are actually triggered</p>
<p>by fluctuations in the so-called glucocorticoid system,</p>
<p>the system that regulates cortisol release.</p>
<p>And as some of you have probably heard me say before,</p>
<p>cortisol, even though it&rsquo;s often discussed</p>
<p>as a terrible thing, it&rsquo;s chronic stress,</p>
<p>cortisol, cortisol, et cetera,</p>
<p>cortisol is essential for health.</p>
<p>And every day we get a rise in cortisol in the morning</p>
<p>that is associated with enhanced immune function,</p>
<p>enhanced alertness, enhanced ability to focus,</p>
<p>so on and so forth.</p>
<p>In fact, the protocol that I&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>beating the drum about, that people should get</p>
<p>sunlight in their eyes as close to waking as possible,</p>
<p>that actually enhances or increases</p>
<p>the peak level of cortisol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s experienced early in the day.</p>
<p>And that sets in motion a number</p>
<p>of these Ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you wake up at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>and you find that for the first hour after waking,</p>
<p>you tend to be a little bit groggy</p>
<p>or you happen to be groggy on a given day,</p>
<p>but then you notice that your attention</p>
<p>and alertness starts to peak somewhere around 9.30 a.m.</p>
<p>or 10 a.m., you can be pretty sure</p>
<p>that that first Ultradian cycle for learning</p>
<p>is going to be optimal to start at about 9.30 or 10 a.m.</p>
<p>How can I say about if it&rsquo;s indeed a 90-minute cycle?</p>
<p>Well, this is really where the underlying neurobiology</p>
<p>in these Ultradian cycles converge</p>
<p>to give you a specific protocol.</p>
<p>The changes in cortisol that occur throughout the day</p>
<p>involve, yes, a big peak early in the day</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting your sunlight and caffeine</p>
<p>and maybe even some exercise early in the day,</p>
<p>but typically that peak comes early</p>
<p>and then across the day, the baseline jitters a little bit.</p>
<p>It comes down, but it bounces around a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a flat line if we were to measure</p>
<p>your glucocorticoid levels.</p>
<p>Each one of those little bumps corresponds</p>
<p>to a shift in these Ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>So if you find that you are most alert at 9.30</p>
<p>or starting to become alert at 9.30</p>
<p>and then typically you have a peak of focus</p>
<p>and concentration around 10 a.m.,</p>
<p>that is really valuable to know</p>
<p>because the way that the molecules</p>
<p>that control neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>that is the changes in neurons</p>
<p>and other cell types in the brain</p>
<p>that allow your nervous system to learn</p>
<p>and literally for new connections to form between neurons,</p>
<p>which is basically the basis of learning,</p>
<p>those fluctuate according to these Ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>This means if your peak in alertness and focus</p>
<p>and energy could even be experienced as physical energy</p>
<p>occurs at about 9.30 a.m.,</p>
<p>I would start your first Ultradian cycle for learning</p>
<p>somewhere around there.</p>
<p>Certainly 9.30 a.m. would be ideal,</p>
<p>but 10 a.m. would be fine as well.</p>
<p>And then you have about one hour</p>
<p>to get the maximum amount of learning in,</p>
<p>even within that Ultradian cycle.</p>
<p>This is where there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion out there.</p>
<p>People think, oh, Ultradian cycles are 90 minutes,</p>
<p>therefore we should be in our peak level of focus</p>
<p>throughout that 90 minutes.</p>
<p>In reality, most people take about 10 or 15 minutes</p>
<p>to break into a really deep trench of focus,</p>
<p>and then periodically throughout the next hour,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll pop out of that focus</p>
<p>and have to deliberately refocus.</p>
<p>This is why, if possible,</p>
<p>you want to turn off wifi connections</p>
<p>and put your phone in the other room or turn it off.</p>
<p>If you do need your phone or wifi,</p>
<p>just be aware of how distracting those things can be</p>
<p>to getting into a deep trench of focus.</p>
<p>But the point is this,</p>
<p>these 90 minute cycles occur periodically</p>
<p>throughout the day,</p>
<p>but there is going to be one period early in the day,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m referring to this period</p>
<p>as starting at about 9.30 or 10 a.m.,</p>
<p>and then likely another one in the mid to late afternoon</p>
<p>that are going to be ideal for focus learning.</p>
<p>And that focus learning bout should ideally</p>
<p>have you set your clock, a stopwatch or something,</p>
<p>to measure 90 minutes,</p>
<p>but do assume that there&rsquo;s going to be some jitter</p>
<p>at the front end where you&rsquo;re not going to be able to focus</p>
<p>as deeply as you would like.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ll get about an hour of deep focus,</p>
<p>and then you really start to transition</p>
<p>out of these ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>How do you know when the afternoon ultradian cycle occurs?</p>
<p>Well, just as in the morning,</p>
<p>it occurs because there&rsquo;s a brief but significant increase</p>
<p>in the glucocorticoid system in the mid to late afternoon.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you it&rsquo;s going to be 2 p.m.</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s going to be, you know, it&rsquo;s going to be 3 p.m.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really going to depend on the individual</p>
<p>when you ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>some of the other demands of your day,</p>
<p>but you can learn to recognize when these two periods</p>
<p>for optimized learning will occur,</p>
<p>and here are the key principles.</p>
<p>Watch for a day or two,</p>
<p>meaning pay attention to when you have your peak levels</p>
<p>of physical and mental energy in the morning,</p>
<p>that is between waking and noon,</p>
<p>and then again, between noon and about 6 or 7 p.m.,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m sure that there are some late shifted folks</p>
<p>that will experience their peak in focus</p>
<p>somewhere around 6 or 7 p.m.,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re waking up around 10 or 11 a.m.,</p>
<p>as I know some people out there are.</p>
<p>Once you know where those peaks in focus occur</p>
<p>on your schedule,</p>
<p>set a stopwatch for one ultradian cycle</p>
<p>in the early part of the day.</p>
<p>In this example, I was saying 9.30,</p>
<p>but if you can&rsquo;t hop on it until 10, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Set it for 90 minutes.</p>
<p>Consider that block wholly,</p>
<p>meaning rule out all other distractions,</p>
<p>but assume that within that 90-minute block,</p>
<p>you are only going to be able to focus intensely</p>
<p>for about one hour,</p>
<p>and just know that the molecules that control neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and these things have names,</p>
<p>and yes, brain-derived neurotrophic factor,</p>
<p>BDNF is sort of the most famous of those,</p>
<p>but there are others as well.</p>
<p>In fact, the very receptors that control synaptic strength,</p>
<p>the connections between neurons,</p>
<p>some of the neurotransmitters and neuromodulators</p>
<p>involved in synaptic plasticity,</p>
<p>they undergo regulation by these ultradian changes</p>
<p>in glucocorticoid,</p>
<p>and then try and capture a second ultradian learning block</p>
<p>in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Again, just knowing that the first 10 or 15 minutes,</p>
<p>consider it mental warmup,</p>
<p>and then you get about an hour,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not exactly 60 minutes,</p>
<p>but about an hour to maximize learning.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trying to learn something,</p>
<p>really capture it during that phase as well.</p>
<p>Now, is there a third opportunity or a fourth opportunity?</p>
<p>This relates to Jackson&rsquo;s question directly,</p>
<p>and the short answer is not really.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re somebody who requires very little sleep,</p>
<p>within the 12 or 16 hours that one tends to be awake</p>
<p>during the day, or 18 hours that one tends to be awake,</p>
<p>there are really only two of these major peaks</p>
<p>in the glucocorticoid system</p>
<p>that trigger the onset of these circadian cycles.</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s sort of a ramping up and a ramping down</p>
<p>of glucocorticoids throughout the day.</p>
<p>But the real key here is to learn</p>
<p>when you tend to be most focused</p>
<p>based on your regular sleep-wake cycle,</p>
<p>caffeine intake, exercise, et cetera.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s going to vary from person to person.</p>
<p>And you really only have two opportunities,</p>
<p>or two ultradian cycles to capture</p>
<p>in order to get the maximum focus challenging work done,</p>
<p>AKA learning.</p>
<p>So for somebody that wants to learn</p>
<p>an immense amount of material,</p>
<p>or who has the opportunity to capture</p>
<p>another ultradian cycle,</p>
<p>the other time where that tends to occur</p>
<p>is also early days.</p>
<p>So some people, by waking up early</p>
<p>and using stimulants like caffeine and hydration,</p>
<p>or some brief high-intensity exercise,</p>
<p>can trigger that cortisol pulse</p>
<p>to shift a little bit earlier</p>
<p>so that they can capture a morning work block</p>
<p>that occurs somewhere, let&rsquo;s say, between 6 and 7.30 a.m.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about our typical person,</p>
<p>at least in my example, that&rsquo;s waking up around 7.00 a.m.,</p>
<p>and then I said,</p>
<p>has their first ultradian work cycle really flip on</p>
<p>because that bump in cortisol around 9.30 or 10.00 a.m.?</p>
<p>If that person were, say,</p>
<p>to set their alarm clock for 5.30 a.m.,</p>
<p>then get up, get some artificial light</p>
<p>if the sun isn&rsquo;t out,</p>
<p>you know, turn on brighter artificial lights,</p>
<p>or if the sun happens to be up that time of year,</p>
<p>get some sunlight in your eyes.</p>
<p>But irrespective of sunlight,</p>
<p>were to get a little bit of brief high-intensity exercise,</p>
<p>maybe 10 or 15 minutes of skipping rope,</p>
<p>or even just jumping jacks, or go out for a brief jog,</p>
<p>what happens then is the cortisol pulse</p>
<p>starts to shift earlier.</p>
<p>And so the next day and the following day</p>
<p>and so on and so forth,</p>
<p>provided they&rsquo;re still doing that exercise first thing,</p>
<p>and ideally getting some light in their eyes as well,</p>
<p>well, then they have an opportunity</p>
<p>to capture an increase in cortisol</p>
<p>that is now shifted from about 7.00 a.m.</p>
<p>to about 8.30 a.m.</p>
<p>So they can capture an hour of work there,</p>
<p>and then they will also still be</p>
<p>within that rising phase of cortisol</p>
<p>in the 9.30 to 10.00 a.m. block</p>
<p>that lasts until about, you know, 11.30 or so.</p>
<p>They might have lunch,</p>
<p>perhaps after lunch they do a non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>maybe they don&rsquo;t, maybe you&rsquo;re a napper, maybe you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>And then in the afternoon,</p>
<p>and I would suspect it would now be in the earlier afternoon</p>
<p>sometime around 2.00 or 2.30 would be typical,</p>
<p>although again, that exact time will vary person to person,</p>
<p>then they would want to schedule</p>
<p>another 90-minute work block.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how you can capture three.</p>
<p>Now you can start to see also</p>
<p>why capturing four ultradian work blocks</p>
<p>would be exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not typical that people are awake</p>
<p>for that much of the day, you have to sleep at some point.</p>
<p>And I should mention that if you&rsquo;re going to force yourself</p>
<p>to wake up earlier on a consistent basis,</p>
<p>you probably should be trying to get to sleep</p>
<p>a little bit earlier as well,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just the quality,</p>
<p>but the duration of quality sleep</p>
<p>that really matters for learning.</p>
<p>And I should also remind everybody</p>
<p>that the actual rewiring of neurons</p>
<p>does not occur during any focused work block.</p>
<p>It actually occurs during deep sleep,</p>
<p>the following night and the following night,</p>
<p>and during non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>This is why non-sleep deep rest can accelerate learning</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in states of rest</p>
<p>that the actual connections between neurons strengthen</p>
<p>or weaken or new neurons are added</p>
<p>in a way that allows for what we call learning.</p>
<p>Okay, so one or two ultradian work blocks per day</p>
<p>is typical, three would be really exceptional</p>
<p>and four would be extraordinary.</p>
<p>Look for them, meaning look to see</p>
<p>when you are feeling most focused and alert,</p>
<p>typically in the period before waking and noon,</p>
<p>and typically in the period between noon and bedtime,</p>
<p>given your standard intake of caffeine and exercise</p>
<p>and other life events.</p>
<p>Please also remember that even though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an ultradian 90 minute work block,</p>
<p>the neuroplasticity is going to be best triggered</p>
<p>within a 60 minute portion of that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no way to know exactly</p>
<p>when that 60 minutes begins and ends</p>
<p>until you actually begin the work block.</p>
<p>So this is really designed to be empirical.</p>
<p>You need to actually go do this.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll notice again is that it&rsquo;s hard to focus at first</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll drop into a state of focus.</p>
<p>You may get distracted, that&rsquo;s perfectly normal.</p>
<p>You refocus, get back into triggering learning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;re triggering learning.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be some taper</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll be out of the ultradian work block.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s also key to understand that myself</p>
<p>and other people should not expect</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re only working during these 90 minute work blocks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that a lot of the sorts of demands of our day,</p>
<p>including cooking and shopping for groceries</p>
<p>and email and text messaging and social media,</p>
<p>a lot of those things don&rsquo;t require intense focus</p>
<p>of the sort that I believe Jackson is asking</p>
<p>about maximizing and that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>when I talk about these ultradian work blocks.</p>
<p>And then as a final point,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about these ultradian work blocks</p>
<p>and focus, et cetera,</p>
<p>in a context that brings to mind ideas</p>
<p>about cognitive work.</p>
<p>So learning a language, learning math,</p>
<p>writing or creating,</p>
<p>doing something related to music, et cetera.</p>
<p>But these 90 minute ultradian work blocks</p>
<p>also directly relate to physical skill learning as well</p>
<p>and to physical exercise as well.</p>
<p>So if you are somebody who&rsquo;s really interested</p>
<p>in improving your fitness</p>
<p>and your fitness requires a lot of focused attention.</p>
<p>So for instance,</p>
<p>when I go out for a long run on Sundays,</p>
<p>which is part of my fitness routine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deliberately not thinking about much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to cruise along.</p>
<p>I might focus a little bit on my pace and stride,</p>
<p>maybe an audio book I&rsquo;m listening to or a podcast,</p>
<p>but typically I&rsquo;m just kind of cruising along.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s low cognitive demand work.</p>
<p>These ultradian work blocks can really be maximized</p>
<p>for pure cognitive work,</p>
<p>so kind of book type work, et cetera,</p>
<p>music, et cetera,</p>
<p>or they can also be leveraged toward skill learning.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trying to learn how to dance</p>
<p>or how to perform a particular athletic move,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re trying to get better at some skill</p>
<p>that requires a lot of focus</p>
<p>and alignment of muscular movement</p>
<p>and cognitive demands, et cetera,</p>
<p>well then these are also going to be ideal</p>
<p>for triggering neuroplasticity to get better</p>
<p>in the motor skill based domain as it&rsquo;s called, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about ultradian shifts</p>
<p>in neuroplasticity and ultradian work balance,</p>
<p>I will certainly do more on this</p>
<p>in the Standard Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but the keywords to look up</p>
<p>if you want to explore this further online,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not something that a lot of people know about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called iterative metaplasticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vast literature</p>
<p>and one that I&rsquo;d be happy to teach you</p>
<p>in a standard podcast episode.</p>
<p>But in the interest of getting to more questions</p>
<p>from you all,</p>
<p>hopefully the answer I&rsquo;ve given you now</p>
<p>has been complete enough, yet clear enough,</p>
<p>and yet succinct enough</p>
<p>that you can start to leverage these really powerful aspects</p>
<p>of iterative metaplasticity</p>
<p>and ultradian rhythms for learning.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d just like to point out</p>
<p>that these opportunities for focused learning</p>
<p>that occur in these 90 minute ultradian cycles</p>
<p>are really terrific opportunities.</p>
<p>They are offered to you at least twice every day</p>
<p>and you can really learn to detect when they occur</p>
<p>and when they&rsquo;re likely to occur.</p>
<p>You can certainly learn at other times</p>
<p>in the 24 hour cycle,</p>
<p>but for anyone who&rsquo;s tried to stay up late at night</p>
<p>cramming for an exam,</p>
<p>or for somebody who&rsquo;s tried to learn</p>
<p>during the sleepiest time of their afternoon,</p>
<p>we can be very familiar with the fact</p>
<p>that there are times of day in which we are best at learning.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve just described,</p>
<p>there are ways to capture those moments</p>
<p>and they are valuable moments.</p>
<p>So even though it&rsquo;s just about three hours per day</p>
<p>or really only two hours per day</p>
<p>because of the 60, 90 minute thing</p>
<p>that I talked about a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>learn to know when these occur</p>
<p>and really treat them as valuable,</p>
<p>maybe even wholly in the sense</p>
<p>that they are really the times</p>
<p>that are offered up to you each day by your own biology</p>
<p>in ways that will allow you to get better</p>
<p>pretty much at anything.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining for the beginning</p>
<p>of this Ask Me Anything episode.</p>
<p>To hear the full episode</p>
<p>and to hear future episodes</p>
<p>of these Ask Me Anything sessions,</p>
<p>plus to receive transcripts of them</p>
<p>and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>standard channel and premium tools</p>
<p>not released anywhere else,</p>
<p>please go to hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>Just to remind you why we launched</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really twofold.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s to raise support</p>
<p>for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,</p>
<p>which of course will still be continued</p>
<p>to be released every Monday in full length.</p>
<p>We are not going to change the format</p>
<p>or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>and to fund research,</p>
<p>in particular research done on human beings.</p>
<p>So not animal models, but on human beings,</p>
<p>which I think we all agree is a species</p>
<p>that we are most interested in.</p>
<p>And we are going to specifically fund research</p>
<p>that is aimed toward developing further protocols</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>And those protocols will be distributed</p>
<p>through all channels, not just the premium channel,</p>
<p>but through all channels,</p>
<p>Huberman Lab Podcast and other media channels.</p>
<p>So the idea here is to give you information</p>
<p>to your burning questions in depth</p>
<p>and allow you the opportunity</p>
<p>to support the kind of research</p>
<p>that provides those kinds of answers in the first place.</p>
<p>Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel</p>
<p>is that the tiny foundation has generously offered</p>
<p>to do a dollar for dollar match</p>
<p>on all funds raised for research through the premium channel.</p>
<p>So this is a terrific way that they&rsquo;re going to amplify</p>
<p>whatever funds come in through the premium channel</p>
<p>to further support research for science</p>
<p>and science-related tools for mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to sign up</p>
<p>for the Huberman Lab premium channel,</p>
<p>again, there&rsquo;s a cost of $10 per month,</p>
<p>or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.</p>
<p>That will give you access to all the AMAs.</p>
<p>You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll of course get answers</p>
<p>to all the questions that other people ask as well.</p>
<p>There will also be some premium content</p>
<p>such as transcripts of the AMAs</p>
<p>and various transcripts and protocols</p>
<p>of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes not found elsewhere.</p>
<p>And again, you&rsquo;ll be supporting research</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>You can sign up for the premium channel</p>
<p>by going to hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
