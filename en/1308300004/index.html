Thank you so much! Hi! Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to be here. I have to be honest, I stopped filming my show in May,
and I haven&amp;rsquo;t really spoken to anyone or done anything for however many months that is.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to anyone, and my poor show once in a while,
but mostly I&amp;rsquo;m talking to my dogs all day long, so this could get weird.'>

    <p>Higher Ground and Audible Originals present Michelle Obama, The Light Podcast.</p>
<p>Thank you so much! Hi! Hello!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited to be here. I have to be honest, I stopped filming my show in May,</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t really spoken to anyone or done anything for however many months that is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve spoken to anyone, and my poor show once in a while,</p>
<p>but mostly I&rsquo;m talking to my dogs all day long, so this could get weird.</p>
<p>Yes, it could.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to be a good audience? Who&rsquo;s going to be a good audience? Huh?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I haven&rsquo;t spoken to people.</p>
<p>I love this woman so much, and the book is amazing. You&rsquo;re going to love it.</p>
<p>If you read, I don&rsquo;t know who reads anymore, but if you read, you&rsquo;re going to love this book.</p>
<p>Please welcome my friend, Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>Everyone, Ellen DeGeneres.</p>
<p>Hey everyone, this is Michelle Obama, and you&rsquo;re listening to The Light Podcast.</p>
<p>I want to talk to you about fear.</p>
<p>Yes, our fears, those little monsters that all of us have to wrestle with.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re afraid of public speaking, or conflict, or what people think of you.</p>
<p>It can be anything really, but we&rsquo;ve all got them,</p>
<p>and if we don&rsquo;t take the time to understand them, they can really hold us back.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, a fear is not just a fear.</p>
<p>A fear becomes a limit.</p>
<p>Fear might mean that we start shying away from opportunities, or risks, or adventures.</p>
<p>It might mean that we eliminate whole categories of activities, or passions, or people</p>
<p>that might expand our life experience.</p>
<p>And then we have to ask ourselves, is this really how I want to live?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things that I dive into with my good friend, Ellen DeGeneres, in this episode.</p>
<p>Now, Ellen is someone I met when my husband was first running for president.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been so thankful that over the years, we&rsquo;ve built a real durable friendship</p>
<p>that goes beyond our day jobs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always easy to sort out who you can genuinely connect with</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re First Lady of the United States.</p>
<p>But with Ellen, there was never a question.</p>
<p>We text each other, meet up for dinner, visit each other&rsquo;s homes.</p>
<p>And to that point, I fully recognize how much she loves her home time.</p>
<p>So it meant a lot to have her travel across the country to join me for this conversation.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the things I know for certain anytime I&rsquo;m with Ellen</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m in for a good laugh.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly how our conversation started.</p>
<p>With her struggling to sit on that big, beautiful chair I selected for the stage.</p>
<p>I heard the chairs were too big for you.</p>
<p>Listen, Michelle, I came out here to&hellip;</p>
<p>They said, see if the chair&rsquo;s comfortable for you.</p>
<p>Look what she&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my show, my chair size.</p>
<p>So then I had to bring this out.</p>
<p>You got a little booster.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s tall, you guys. She&rsquo;s very tall.</p>
<p>Upsy-daisy.</p>
<p>Yeah, here I am.</p>
<p>We have taller moderators later on in the tour.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>These are like lifeguard chairs.</p>
<p>These are huge. I mean, this is like, whoo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>If I still had my show, the next time you&rsquo;d be on, I&rsquo;d have a tiny, low, low chair for you.</p>
<p>Little nursery school chairs.</p>
<p>I have to say, before I start asking you questions about the book,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so good. It&rsquo;s so beautifully written.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got so many wonderful tools for what we all are needing to have right now.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a beautiful, beautiful book.</p>
<p>Thank you, babe. Thank you.</p>
<p>You talk about, in the book, being comfortably afraid,</p>
<p>which is, I think, such a great way to put it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a way that I think everybody can understand.</p>
<p>So talk about comfortably afraid.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time talking about fear,</p>
<p>because when you look over what&rsquo;s been happening over the course of,</p>
<p>you know, not even just the last years,</p>
<p>we have gotten so used to being engaged by our fear.</p>
<p>It feels like our fear is being used against us.</p>
<p>You look at the headlines every day, every year, every decade.</p>
<p>Each year is worse and worse.</p>
<p>If you just look at the news, you know, if you listen to some of our leaders,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t trust each other, we can&rsquo;t trust anything.</p>
<p>You should be afraid.</p>
<p>When I think about how fear affects the choices that we make</p>
<p>and the choices of how we treat each other,</p>
<p>a lot of times that&rsquo;s usually grounded in some fear,</p>
<p>the fear of you&rsquo;re new, you&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>So I started thinking about fear and the fact that we struggle to properly decode fear.</p>
<p>Fear is an important emotion.</p>
<p>It protects us. It saves us.</p>
<p>I write about my first memories of being afraid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re afraid of the dark. You&rsquo;re afraid of scary movies.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re afraid of people who look dangerous.</p>
<p>I was afraid of a stuffed turtle in my Aunt Robbie&rsquo;s recital when I was four.</p>
<p>The whole notion of a stuffed animal frightened me.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t get on stage.</p>
<p>But I remember clearly overcoming that fear</p>
<p>because I wanted to wear this red velvet dress because I thought I was cute.</p>
<p>I remember telling myself, it&rsquo;s just a turtle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a turtle, girl.</p>
<p>Go on over there. Just pet it.</p>
<p>And then you can just twirl your little butt off.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not going to hurt you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I remember at a young age decoding my fear</p>
<p>to get to some place I wanted to go.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s the fear that keeps us stuck.</p>
<p>The fear of other.</p>
<p>The fear of somebody who&rsquo;s not like you.</p>
<p>The fear of somebody who&rsquo;s got a different skin color than you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an irrational fear.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t learn to decode it</p>
<p>and to know when our fear is keeping us safe</p>
<p>from when it&rsquo;s keeping us limited and narrow and small.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t start thinking about how we process fear.</p>
<p>I know I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to learn how to determine when my fear is rational</p>
<p>and when it&rsquo;s just me not wanting to do something that makes me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And I think the biggest example is when Barack approached me</p>
<p>about running for President of the United States.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>That happened.</p>
<p>But he played a, you know, I wouldn&rsquo;t say played a dirty trick,</p>
<p>but it was sort of like he said, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of people want me to do this.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s going to be hard.</p>
<p>And I know this is going to be a lot on our family.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t want me to do this, then we just won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, really?</p>
<p>You going to put this on me?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, really, really?</p>
<p>So I had to sit with that choice, you know, and think about it.</p>
<p>And for weeks I walked around and I described walking around</p>
<p>with the notion of that in my head.</p>
<p>And my first gut instinct was no, no way, no, heck no.</p>
<p>But then I had to say, well, what is that?</p>
<p>What is that coming from?</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m honest with myself, as I said here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming from the fact that I didn&rsquo;t want change.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want discomfort.</p>
<p>It was all about me.</p>
<p>It was all about not wanting to do something that would put me</p>
<p>in an uncomfortable place.</p>
<p>And then I had to ask myself, was that a reason to impact</p>
<p>what could be a historic thing?</p>
<p>Would I want to live in the legacy of many of my ancestors?</p>
<p>I talk about our grandparents who had legitimate fears</p>
<p>because they grew up in Jim Crow and desegregation.</p>
<p>And men like our grandfathers had limited worlds</p>
<p>because they would be in danger</p>
<p>if they stepped too far outside of their comfort zone.</p>
<p>So I saw in my own time my grandfather&rsquo;s worlds</p>
<p>get smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>You know, one of my grandfathers died of lung cancer</p>
<p>because he just didn&rsquo;t trust doctors.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t trust anybody.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t trust white people.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t go to the dentist because that&rsquo;s all there were</p>
<p>in our community were white dentists.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a tooth in his mouth.</p>
<p>You know, fear, the legacy of some of our grandparents</p>
<p>was small lives because of fear.</p>
<p>Fear that their kids would be harmed.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try this.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go away from home because we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen to you.</p>
<p>Real legitimate fears.</p>
<p>But my mother and father didn&rsquo;t want us to live</p>
<p>with that legacy of fear and let our worlds be narrowed.</p>
<p>And so those thoughts came into my head and I said,</p>
<p>well, if I say no only because of my fear,</p>
<p>then what am I teaching my girls?</p>
<p>What am I saying to them?</p>
<p>How am I going to look back as an old lady and my kids say,</p>
<p>we hear grandpa could have been president.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, girl, he could have been,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with that.</p>
<p>So we still here.</p>
<p>So learning to be comfortably afraid is learning</p>
<p>to rationally deal with your fears</p>
<p>so that you can get to the other side.</p>
<p>And when you get to the other side, nine times out of 10,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of growth and opportunity and possibility</p>
<p>if you can decode it properly.</p>
<p>I grew up with a father that was afraid of everything.</p>
<p>Like he literally lived in fear of everything.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t let me, I never learned to roller skate</p>
<p>because I could have fallen down and hurt myself.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t go to doctors</p>
<p>because we were Christian science.</p>
<p>So I would have a split open knee</p>
<p>and bone would be exposed and he&rsquo;d just pray.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be fine, baby.</p>
<p>Oh, he gave me some cherries and just prayed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had a bowl of cherries.</p>
<p>And then he tied a rag around my knee</p>
<p>and then he tied a rag around my knee</p>
<p>and with a mark, cilantro, a smiley face,</p>
<p>which seems like ink could go into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>But anyway, yeah, he was just, he was scared of everything.</p>
<p>And I just grew up with that kind of,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t realize at the time how much OCD he had.</p>
<p>He was a very fearful person.</p>
<p>And so I really worked hard to try to grow out.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to become that person.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to be that fearful.</p>
<p>He was fearful of not having enough money.</p>
<p>So we didn&rsquo;t have enough money because he made that come true.</p>
<p>He thought about it enough that we didn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So fear to me, and so I&rsquo;ve pushed myself.</p>
<p>The comfortable fear for me is, you know,</p>
<p>I want to host the Oscars.</p>
<p>I want to do something really dangerous</p>
<p>so that I can like feel good about myself, you know?</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>So, and it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to push yourself to do something that&rsquo;s really scary.</p>
<p>And then another thing is that I explore how much fear</p>
<p>affects bigotry and racism and isolation from each other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what people try to feed on.</p>
<p>Be afraid of the other person.</p>
<p>You know, be afraid of them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have to be really careful</p>
<p>when people try to lead us by our fear.</p>
<p>We should be suspicious of that.</p>
<p>Because I live in this country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve traveled around it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to tell you, people disagree with one another, you know?</p>
<p>But the fear is coming from other places.</p>
<p>Noises in people&rsquo;s heads.</p>
<p>Things coming from folks phoned.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I encourage us all</p>
<p>to be mindful of getting out of our comfort zones.</p>
<p>Of reaching out to people who are not like us.</p>
<p>Because, you know, we will not see the truth of each other</p>
<p>if we just sit in our fear and isolation</p>
<p>and assume that what people are telling us about them is true.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re telling them about us, and that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>So it can&rsquo;t just be one way.</p>
<p>So I think decoding fear is a part of us being able to drop our guard</p>
<p>and really learn each other and not be manipulated by power</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to gain more power because of our fear.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think also, I think we have the noise,</p>
<p>the loudest noise is from extremes.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re hearing extreme, extreme right voices</p>
<p>and extreme, extreme left.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just noise.</p>
<p>Most of us aren&rsquo;t feeling or thinking that.</p>
<p>But it just looks like that.</p>
<p>And so the middle part of us, all the smart ones, have to go,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re as loud as you people on each side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s really hard to quiet that noise.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really horrible thing.</p>
<p>Your daughters was scared of Chewbacca,</p>
<p>and yet you brought it to the White House.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>That was a big mommy fail.</p>
<p>We thought we were doing something great.</p>
<p>We invited all the Star Wars characters.</p>
<p>And I forgot that Sasha hates all things big and furry</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t see the face.</p>
<p>That poor child had on the cutest little costume.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see her here because she&rsquo;s crying in her room upstairs.</p>
<p>But I eventually got over my fear of stuffed turtles,</p>
<p>and she is now no longer afraid of big, hairy things.</p>
<p>So we are now comfortably afraid together</p>
<p>and moving through life normally.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s gotten over that.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a physician.</p>
<p>And being a black woman, it&rsquo;s not always easy.</p>
<p>So there have been many times where my voice just seemed very muted.</p>
<p>If I made a suggestion or something like that, it wasn&rsquo;t heard.</p>
<p>Whereas maybe one of my counterparts, who doesn&rsquo;t look like me, it&rsquo;s heard.</p>
<p>And so there have been many times where I&rsquo;ve had to bite my tongue</p>
<p>or kind of pretend like the microaggressions weren&rsquo;t there, you know,</p>
<p>and just keep moving, keep my head down,</p>
<p>and keep doing what I know that I need to do.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s about patient care.</p>
<p>And if I can&rsquo;t take a breath and kind of let that roll off a little bit,</p>
<p>then it comes back on them.</p>
<p>And the other thing is, as a black woman,</p>
<p>I always have to be very cognizant of how I&rsquo;m handling my black patients</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t get to see us all the time.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really good that they see somebody that they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, my God, she looks like me and she sounds like me</p>
<p>and her hair is like mine and things like that.</p>
<p>If I get bogged down with that other stuff,</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t get to show up like I need to for them.</p>
<p>You talk about in the book meeting yourself and others with gladness.</p>
<p>And this is your friend Ron who does this.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a really beautiful thing to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a short chapter in the book called Starting Kind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the tools that I learned.</p>
<p>I describe a friend of mine, Ron Kirk.</p>
<p>Some of you may know him.</p>
<p>He used to be the former mayor of Dallas and was in Barack&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>You know, handsome, charismatic, funny, you know,</p>
<p>southern dude who is confident and poised.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a good friend.</p>
<p>His wife is one of my dear friends.</p>
<p>And she would tell me about a habit that Ron would have in the morning.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s lying in bed and she&rsquo;d hear him getting up.</p>
<p>So he gets up early, you know, start his day.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;d hear him talking to himself in the mirror.</p>
<p>And he would say, hey, buddy.</p>
<p>You know, I was like, he&rsquo;d say that out loud.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, no, no.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s talking full, hey, buddy, how you doing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have a great day.</p>
<p>And so she tells me, and we&rsquo;re just cracking up,</p>
<p>because imagining Ron Kirk giving himself that little morning pep talk.</p>
<p>Now, I asked him before I told him.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m about to write about you in this book.</p>
<p>And he said, go ahead.</p>
<p>And he just wants the, you know, percentage of the mug sales when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the hey, buddy mugs that are going to come out of this.</p>
<p>But I share that story because while we teased him, you know,</p>
<p>because he can stand teasing,</p>
<p>is that it is a simple thing that we do not do,</p>
<p>particularly women, for ourselves.</p>
<p>We do not send ourselves simple, kind messages.</p>
<p>Not even, especially not in the morning.</p>
<p>And it is such a simple tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tool that I know I have to practice more and more.</p>
<p>Because those negative thoughts, I don&rsquo;t care what,</p>
<p>they are sitting comfortably in my head, you know.</p>
<p>Even if I can play it off, that negative thing is like, oh, girl,</p>
<p>your hair didn&rsquo;t look good, or this didn&rsquo;t happen, oh, did you gain weight,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s wrong with that wrinkle come from,</p>
<p>and oh, why does your face look like that, you know.</p>
<p>We all just get used to these negative messages,</p>
<p>and we practice that over anything else.</p>
<p>When Michelle told me I was going to be in the book,</p>
<p>I was at first flattered, surprised,</p>
<p>and then a little anxious how a story about somebody</p>
<p>who talks to themselves in the morning might be received.</p>
<p>Most of my life, I&rsquo;m up at 5.30 in the morning.</p>
<p>My wife is very much not a morning person,</p>
<p>and I just like to think through what I&rsquo;m going to say,</p>
<p>and so it got to be on Wednesdays,</p>
<p>I like to just remind myself, you got this.</p>
<p>Then it sort of evolved.</p>
<p>I would call and leave myself a voice message if I could.</p>
<p>So I called, and I was like, hey, buddy, it&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re going to have a good day.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t know she was listening.</p>
<p>My wife never gets up.</p>
<p>So at some point, I think during one of their trips,</p>
<p>she would take her girlfriends,</p>
<p>and she shared this story with Michelle and the group,</p>
<p>and then the next thing I know, when we&rsquo;re all together</p>
<p>in Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>Michelle, Barack, everybody&rsquo;s, hey, buddy, how you doing?</p>
<p>I was like&hellip;</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I can&rsquo;t believe she remembered that story.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that it resonated like that.</p>
<p>It speaks to her unique talent</p>
<p>to take everyday life stories</p>
<p>and find something of value of them.</p>
<p>I just never dreamed I&rsquo;d be, you know, one of those stories.</p>
<p>You have been attacked in so many ways,</p>
<p>and people have tried to turn off your light.</p>
<p>And I just, the strength that you have,</p>
<p>and it really is, I think, a big part,</p>
<p>like you said, to your parents,</p>
<p>because they were amazing parents</p>
<p>and really gave you the tools.</p>
<p>But to go through what you&rsquo;ve gone through,</p>
<p>and how do you keep that light strong</p>
<p>when you have people saying such horrible negative things?</p>
<p>And a lot of people, it&rsquo;s really interesting,</p>
<p>young people now who know me on this side of it</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even remember how bad the attacks were on me</p>
<p>when, you know, Barack was running</p>
<p>and the country didn&rsquo;t fully know me.</p>
<p>I mean, these are major magazines.</p>
<p>They took the image of a smart, articulate,</p>
<p>outspoken black woman,</p>
<p>and they turned it into a threat.</p>
<p>And so, yes, it definitely hurt.</p>
<p>It was stunning at first,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like when you see yourself</p>
<p>in a way that is not you,</p>
<p>you wonder, well, wow,</p>
<p>how easily your whole persona can be manipulated</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the public eye.</p>
<p>Ellen, you&rsquo;ve experienced as a public figure.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we often treat it like,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s the cost of being a public figure.</p>
<p>And it is sad, but sadly, social media and the press,</p>
<p>again, preying on negativity,</p>
<p>preying on fear, preying on anger,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s become the easy go-to.</p>
<p>You know, what pain and anger and fear</p>
<p>must you be holding on to</p>
<p>that you would do that to anybody,</p>
<p>let alone a woman, a mother?</p>
<p>What prevents you from seeing my humanity?</p>
<p>Something is broken.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re the first lady,</p>
<p>your job isn&rsquo;t to worry about it.</p>
<p>Your job is to figure out how to fix it,</p>
<p>because people are in pain.</p>
<p>People are afraid.</p>
<p>People are afraid of people who aren&rsquo;t like them</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have enough.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem with living in a country</p>
<p>where people don&rsquo;t have enough.</p>
<p>You know, they take their anger and their bitterness</p>
<p>and their loss out on each other.</p>
<p>You know, which is why we should all be promoting</p>
<p>more taxes and more support systems</p>
<p>and better schools for everyone of all races,</p>
<p>because it makes people feel like they have a stake.</p>
<p>And then we don&rsquo;t have to go after each other.</p>
<p>So I get through it because it&rsquo;s an armor that I built.</p>
<p>Another tool is that you learn how to not let that stuff in</p>
<p>and to grasp on to the truth of who you know</p>
<p>and to rise above it to see your own light</p>
<p>and to hopefully help them see theirs</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re not in that place.</p>
<p>I overcame the fear of animals by getting an animal.</p>
<p>I was afraid of dogs and cats.</p>
<p>As a child, dogs especially were seen as something scary,</p>
<p>not necessarily as pets,</p>
<p>but as things that chased you down the street.</p>
<p>And we never had pets in my family.</p>
<p>And so someone said a cat might be an easier thing,</p>
<p>so I got a cat.</p>
<p>Prince the 23-pound cat</p>
<p>that started off as a cute little kitten</p>
<p>and became a 23-pound cat.</p>
<p>My biggest fear was for a long time of saying no.</p>
<p>I felt like a lot of the time I would say yes to everything</p>
<p>because if I said no,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;d maybe lose the person that I&rsquo;m saying no to.</p>
<p>But I found out as I got older</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s important to say no sometimes</p>
<p>because you have to refuel yourself.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say yes to everything</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re giving more than you&rsquo;re receiving</p>
<p>when you say yes to everything.</p>
<p>So you have to learn how to say no</p>
<p>just to kind of keep your own sanity.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re an inspiration in that way,</p>
<p>that you could take all that</p>
<p>and still stand strong</p>
<p>and still put yourself out there</p>
<p>because, you know, and you had to.</p>
<p>You had no choice.</p>
<p>Well, then there was that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s really tough.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I say this all the time,</p>
<p>but, like, people say, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in show business, and you have to have thick skin.</p>
<p>You just have to grow thick skin.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have thick skin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want thick skin.</p>
<p>I like being sensitive.</p>
<p>I like feeling things,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s taught me compassion and empathy</p>
<p>because now I know what it feels like</p>
<p>to be attacked and to be judged</p>
<p>and to be criticized,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t ever want to do that to anybody</p>
<p>because I know what that feels like.</p>
<p>And if I had thick skin,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know what it felt like.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m happy that I feel things</p>
<p>and I feel good, like I feel good, like you said.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why people love you.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, um&hellip;</p>
<p>I think that social media,</p>
<p>though, has, you know,</p>
<p>exponentially just, like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, I think, has created&hellip;</p>
<p>And it seems to prey on</p>
<p>all the negative and all the attacks</p>
<p>versus anything nice</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re saying about somebody.</p>
<p>They love to keep sharing and spreading</p>
<p>nasty&hellip; I mean, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what we do about that, but social media</p>
<p>has really hurt.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s a coincidence</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re seeing, you know,</p>
<p>high rates of anxiety and depression,</p>
<p>especially among our young people.</p>
<p>There are wonderful things</p>
<p>that social media has done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s opened up the world in so many ways.</p>
<p>It has connected us in ways.</p>
<p>It gives you access to information.</p>
<p>My children can now</p>
<p>correct us on point</p>
<p>by going, Mom, you&rsquo;re stupid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the right answer. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, ooh, I hate Google.</p>
<p>I hate Google.</p>
<p>Makes parents look stupid.</p>
<p>They do it to my mom all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, Grandma, that science</p>
<p>experiment didn&rsquo;t work that way, so&hellip;</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where all that is coming from.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s too much information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>opinion doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t need to be heard</p>
<p>and shared. It really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Before, you had a crazy</p>
<p>uncle, and he&rsquo;d just talk crazy</p>
<p>at the kitchen table.</p>
<p>And now, he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>followers.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>nobody was supposed to hear</p>
<p>from Uncle Bubba.</p>
<p>Ever. Ever, ever.</p>
<p>We were just like, you just listen and go,</p>
<p>mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s spreading that stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t yet figured</p>
<p>out how to manage it.</p>
<p>So I think we have to be</p>
<p>wary, and I think, and it&rsquo;s hard as</p>
<p>parents to</p>
<p>set those boundaries</p>
<p>for your kids. And we</p>
<p>just escaped it.</p>
<p>Because Malia wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>old enough where she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hooked on it like a drug.</p>
<p>Sasha is just right</p>
<p>in that cusp. So I know it&rsquo;s easier</p>
<p>said than done. But for the</p>
<p>sake of our young people, our young</p>
<p>adults, we&rsquo;ve got to be, you know,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what this is doing to them.</p>
<p>And I think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just making us all</p>
<p>way more anxious and suspicious.</p>
<p>It is dividing us in ways</p>
<p>that we just have to be careful</p>
<p>of, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to take us some time to really</p>
<p>know these effects. But I</p>
<p>am wary of social</p>
<p>media, even though I&rsquo;m on Instagram</p>
<p>and Twitter and all that stuff.</p>
<p>So follow her.</p>
<p>So follow me on, well, you saw my</p>
<p>community page, so.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>you talk about your mom a lot</p>
<p>in the book. She&rsquo;s amazing, Marion.</p>
<p>But you talk about some</p>
<p>pretty,</p>
<p>her rules. Do you want to talk about</p>
<p>her rules? Well, the chapter is</p>
<p>called Meet My Mom. Because let me tell you,</p>
<p>you want to know what&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>source code, what&rsquo;s my biggest tool</p>
<p>is that I had Marion Robinson as</p>
<p>a mother. She is</p>
<p>common sense, unique</p>
<p>kind of wisdom, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called Meet My Mom. And</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of little Marionisms</p>
<p>in there.</p>
<p>Just to share one, this</p>
<p>notion is you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go to school to be liked. You</p>
<p>come home to be liked. And</p>
<p>this is another thing that helped me get</p>
<p>through some of those tougher times, because</p>
<p>my mother&rsquo;s view</p>
<p>was, you go to school</p>
<p>to learn. You know, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>control whether the teacher likes you.</p>
<p>What you need to do is get the</p>
<p>math that she has from her</p>
<p>head into yours. You come</p>
<p>home to be liked. That&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>an example of just the kind of</p>
<p>steadiness that my mother</p>
<p>provided to me and my brother,</p>
<p>our family, her</p>
<p>entire life, and that she</p>
<p>upended her life</p>
<p>to come and live in the White House, which she</p>
<p>did not want to do.</p>
<p>And the only reason she</p>
<p>did it is that her favorite child,</p>
<p>my brother Craig,</p>
<p>convinced her that it was</p>
<p>the best thing for her to do.</p>
<p>So she reluctantly</p>
<p>came and lived in a couple</p>
<p>of suites in the White House to do me a</p>
<p>favor. But it was a</p>
<p>huge favor, creating a</p>
<p>kind of stability. I talk</p>
<p>about the fact that Grandma</p>
<p>lit up for us all those eight</p>
<p>years in the White House.</p>
<p>She was there seeing us as</p>
<p>ourselves, Barack,</p>
<p>the girls, me.</p>
<p>She was that source for me</p>
<p>to come to when</p>
<p>that stuff would happen. I could go up</p>
<p>to her room and just sit and let</p>
<p>out a breath, and she would remind</p>
<p>me who I was,</p>
<p>who we were. You know, if we were</p>
<p>traveling and we wanted to keep the girls</p>
<p>on a schedule and make sure they were</p>
<p>doing what they were supposed to and they didn&rsquo;t grow</p>
<p>spoiled or pampered or</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t take advantage of the staff</p>
<p>there, Grandma was there to be</p>
<p>like, you know what you&rsquo;re supposed to do. You know</p>
<p>who you are. Don&rsquo;t come in here</p>
<p>acting new.</p>
<p>All of that</p>
<p>kept</p>
<p>us grounded. So a</p>
<p>gift that I‚Äîone of the biggest gifts</p>
<p>in this book is the chapter</p>
<p>on my mom, because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much that she teaches</p>
<p>us and me.</p>
<p>You know, one other important thing is</p>
<p>that you raise the child you</p>
<p>have. I mean, you don&rsquo;t try</p>
<p>to change them into another</p>
<p>version of yourself.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>until‚Äînot after the first child</p>
<p>but the second, right?</p>
<p>Because the first one, you think</p>
<p>even if it works out,</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s you, right?</p>
<p>You think, oh, I&rsquo;m such a good parent.</p>
<p>You know, look how normal</p>
<p>they are and how they think and they listen.</p>
<p>And then the second</p>
<p>one comes, and they&rsquo;re very different.</p>
<p>And I share a story</p>
<p>about when I was about to give up</p>
<p>on parenting, when it was clear</p>
<p>when my children were showing me who they were.</p>
<p>And I share this</p>
<p>story about, you know, it was one of those nights,</p>
<p>Barack is campaigning, kids are</p>
<p>little, it was time for bed, and they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t listening, and I was like, go to bed.</p>
<p>Yee-hee-tee-hee, laughing, laughing.</p>
<p>And I was just, at the end of my rope, I had a long</p>
<p>day, and I had asked too many</p>
<p>times, and I just went upstairs and said, okay,</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t listen to me, I quit.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t need a parent,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>You can just do this all on yourself, since</p>
<p>you know so much, I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>retiring.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m standing there, I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>Malia, the older one,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s empathetic and sweet,</p>
<p>her reaction was, oh, no,</p>
<p>mommy, no, we wouldn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what to do without you, no, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>She walked in her</p>
<p>room, brushed her teeth, hopped in the bed,</p>
<p>and I was like, oh, okay, this works.</p>
<p>And then the little one,</p>
<p>Sasha,</p>
<p>she was about</p>
<p>five, she grabbed her</p>
<p>blankie, and was like, oh, good.</p>
<p>She walked.</p>
<p>And that little</p>
<p>girl was like, I</p>
<p>am so glad you are finally handing</p>
<p>me my life.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;ve been trying to tell you, you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I learned right then</p>
<p>and there, two different people,</p>
<p>you know, and I have to</p>
<p>approach them, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been that way their whole lives.</p>
<p>They are beautiful,</p>
<p>amazing young girls, but they are separate</p>
<p>individuals, and I have to</p>
<p>approach them that way, different kind</p>
<p>of ways to show love, different</p>
<p>ways that they hear it, and that was</p>
<p>something my mother taught me, is like,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t turn your child into a mini-me.</p>
<p>You know, you have to parent the</p>
<p>child you have. So that&rsquo;s just some</p>
<p>of the wisdom. I love that, yeah, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of the reason that people have kids</p>
<p>is because they think they&rsquo;re going to, you know,</p>
<p>mold them into exactly</p>
<p>what they want them to be.</p>
<p>Any final thoughts, anything</p>
<p>else you want to say before we say goodnight?</p>
<p>What a night, what a night.</p>
<p>What a night.</p>
<p>I just want to say, you know,</p>
<p>this woman is light.</p>
<p>Ellen, I love you. I am</p>
<p>grateful that you&rsquo;ve taken time out of</p>
<p>your world to share this stage</p>
<p>with me. Let&rsquo;s give</p>
<p>Ellen DeGeneres a round of applause.</p>
<p>I love you. I love you.</p>
<p>Thank you, guys.</p>
<p>Good night!</p>
<p>Throughout my life,</p>
<p>my mom&rsquo;s wisdom has been the</p>
<p>armor that helped me get through</p>
<p>my toughest moments.</p>
<p>Not just when our girls were little,</p>
<p>but as they grew older</p>
<p>and especially during the White House</p>
<p>years. Honestly,</p>
<p>the topics we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>in this episode all fit together</p>
<p>because my mother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grasp of these smaller truths</p>
<p>gave her a sort of</p>
<p>fearlessness of her own</p>
<p>and she shaped the</p>
<p>way I looked at fear,</p>
<p>the way I see my place in the</p>
<p>world, the way I interact</p>
<p>with all of you.</p>
<p>Because look, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never completely rid ourselves</p>
<p>of fear and uncertainty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a fact.</p>
<p>But when</p>
<p>we fixate too much on our</p>
<p>fears, on the dangers</p>
<p>that might be lurking around the corner,</p>
<p>whether real or perceived,</p>
<p>or when we give too</p>
<p>much power to what other</p>
<p>folks think of us or how</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve mistreated us in the past,</p>
<p>we risk</p>
<p>letting our fears dim</p>
<p>our light.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got to get comfortable with our fears.</p>
<p>Sometimes a fear</p>
<p>is like a hater, that you</p>
<p>just brush off and keep it moving.</p>
<p>Other times,</p>
<p>a fear is a true nemesis</p>
<p>that you have to look dead</p>
<p>in the eye and face down</p>
<p>in order to really let your</p>
<p>light shine. And isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that all we&rsquo;re really here to do?</p>
<p>To kindle our</p>
<p>light, to look in the</p>
<p>mirror and tell ourselves that</p>
<p>we can do this.</p>
<p>And once we do</p>
<p>that, then we</p>
<p>can share our light with</p>
<p>others as well. So I want to thank</p>
<p>Ellen for her friendship,</p>
<p>her perspective,</p>
<p>and for guiding us through such a</p>
<p>wonderful conversation.</p>
<p>And thank you again,</p>
<p>all of you, for listening in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk to you soon.</p>
