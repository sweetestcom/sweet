    <p>The following is a conversation with Roger Reeves,</p>
<p>one of the most prolific drug smugglers in history.</p>
<p>He worked for Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa,</p>
<p>the leaders behind the Medellin Cartel.</p>
<p>Roger was the employer and close friend of Barry Seal,</p>
<p>the infamous drug smuggler who was the main character</p>
<p>in the movie American Maid.</p>
<p>Roger transported countless tons of cocaine and marijuana</p>
<p>covering six continents.</p>
<p>He escaped prison five times,</p>
<p>was shut down in both Mexico and Colombia,</p>
<p>and was tortured nearly to death in a Mexican prison.</p>
<p>Through all of this, his wife Mari, the love of his life,</p>
<p>was there with him, and when he was in prison,</p>
<p>she waited for him.</p>
<p>He recently got out of prison where for many years</p>
<p>he worked on his memoir called Smuggler.</p>
<p>This podcast is an exploration of his story.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors.</p>
<p>Noom, Allform, ExpressVPN, Four Sigmatic, and Aidsleep.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>Let me say a few words about Roger Reeves,</p>
<p>Pablo Escobar, and the war on drugs.</p>
<p>This conversation with Roger is unlike any I&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>
<p>In the eyes of many, including the law,</p>
<p>Roger is a criminal, a bad man who was added</p>
<p>to the suffering in the world.</p>
<p>But he never directly engaged or participated</p>
<p>in the violence.</p>
<p>Unlike his bosses, Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa.</p>
<p>His crime was the transport of drugs.</p>
<p>I thought about this, and about Pablo Escobar,</p>
<p>who was at once both a brutal murderer</p>
<p>and a Robin Hood figure who helped the poor</p>
<p>and was loved by thousands, if not millions.</p>
<p>We sometimes idolize murderers and destroy good, honest men.</p>
<p>We give power and money to corrupt politicians</p>
<p>and dictators that starve and murder their own people.</p>
<p>Given this, I think about what makes for a good man,</p>
<p>and what makes for a bad man, and who decides.</p>
<p>Sitting across from Roger, I saw a complicated man,</p>
<p>but one who has kindness in his heart,</p>
<p>a love for money and adventure, and a disdain for violence.</p>
<p>Again, his crime was the transport of drugs.</p>
<p>Since 1971, the war on drugs has cost U.S. $1 trillion.</p>
<p>Marijuana legalization alone would save</p>
<p>and make $13.7 billion, that could send</p>
<p>more than 650,000 students</p>
<p>to public universities every year.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the human stories of the 500,000 human beings</p>
<p>sitting in prison for drug related offenses,</p>
<p>and the 1.1 million on probation and parole.</p>
<p>Their life is damaged or ruined beyond repair</p>
<p>due to the prohibition of drugs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to be said about the damage done</p>
<p>by the war on drugs, but when reading about Roger&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>and talking to him, I couldn&rsquo;t escape the thought</p>
<p>that while society wants to label him a criminal</p>
<p>and a bad human being, there are much worse men out there</p>
<p>who we give a pass to, even give power to,</p>
<p>even men who hold political office or run companies.</p>
<p>I also think about my role as an interviewer,</p>
<p>sitting across a man like Roger.</p>
<p>In these interviews, in life,</p>
<p>in many ways I continue to be myself,</p>
<p>a person who like Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s The Idiot,</p>
<p>seeks the good in all people,</p>
<p>but is hurt by it on occasion,</p>
<p>and maybe is destroyed by it in the end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not naive, but I&rsquo;m also optimistic</p>
<p>and have hope for humanity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who I am, and that&rsquo;s what these conversations are.</p>
<p>I hope you join me, and I hope you understand</p>
<p>that I come from a place of love.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s my conversation with Roger Reeves.</p>
<p>You are one of the most prolific drug smugglers in history.</p>
<p>What would you say motivated you?</p>
<p>Money, power, the thrill, or was it something else?</p>
<p>Money.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t there a point where you&rsquo;ve had more money</p>
<p>than you can possibly know what to do with,</p>
<p>or is it always more money?</p>
<p>You know, I had plenty of money several times,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s sort of like if you was in Las Vegas</p>
<p>and you had the slot machine handled down,</p>
<p>and the gold coins was tumbling around you,</p>
<p>and you had sweepers bagging them up,</p>
<p>when would you let it go?</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t some part of that the thrill then?</p>
<p>Oh, there was a lot of thrill, sometimes way too much.</p>
<p>You made certainly tens of millions of dollars,</p>
<p>probably much more.</p>
<p>What memorable experience</p>
<p>did having that much money make possible for you?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one thing is the money,</p>
<p>and the other thing is what that money can buy.</p>
<p>Well, I bought everything that I could hide.</p>
<p>I bought seven farms.</p>
<p>I owned the city,</p>
<p>the land where the city of Moreno Valley, California is.</p>
<p>I had an option on that land.</p>
<p>Did the planning and development of that.</p>
<p>The most expensive coin in the world.</p>
<p>Yachts, ships, airplanes galore.</p>
<p>Did that bring you happiness?</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>In fact, I think I&rsquo;m happier now.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m happier now.</p>
<p>So looking back, would you do it the same way all again?</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>Really, even the thrill of it?</p>
<p>Not even thrill of it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t worth 33 years in prison,</p>
<p>being away from my lovely family.</p>
<p>So money, what about the power?</p>
<p>Just being on top of the world where nobody can,</p>
<p>not the governments, the police,</p>
<p>all the big, bad agencies chasing you,</p>
<p>and you could do whatever the heck you wanted.</p>
<p>As far as having to look over your shoulder</p>
<p>everywhere you went and every phone call you made,</p>
<p>make sure that you was naked with somebody in the ocean</p>
<p>before you talked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rather uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like to make phone calls the same way.</p>
<p>What was it like meeting and working with Pablo Escobar,</p>
<p>the leader of the Medellin Cartel?</p>
<p>He was just, just seemed like a gentleman when I met him.</p>
<p>He was just like you and I, sitting here, shook hands,</p>
<p>and I had flown one load for a fellow,</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t work out well.</p>
<p>The fellow that I gave it to got shot,</p>
<p>and it took a while to get my money,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t put as many kilos on the plane</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re supposed to,</p>
<p>and so I wasn&rsquo;t gonna work with him anymore,</p>
<p>and my contact down there introduced me</p>
<p>to Jorge Ochoa, and we went up,</p>
<p>and in Vigado, we went up and the gate opened,</p>
<p>and we was escorted in.</p>
<p>There must have been 50 men out in the yards,</p>
<p>hitching a rail on an old house,</p>
<p>and we was escorted right in,</p>
<p>and there was a beautiful woman in there.</p>
<p>I mean, gore, drop dead beautiful,</p>
<p>and she made us a cup of coffee,</p>
<p>then ushered in to see Jorge Ochoa,</p>
<p>and he had 12 telephones on his desk,</p>
<p>and all of them was a different color,</p>
<p>and he shook hands, was very friendly, spoke English,</p>
<p>and he said that each one of those telephones</p>
<p>represented another city in the United States.</p>
<p>This is Chicago, and this is New York.</p>
<p>If I ring, I knew who was calling,</p>
<p>and so we chatted a while,</p>
<p>and he asked me what type of airplanes I had</p>
<p>and what experience I had flying across the U.S. border,</p>
<p>and I told him he seemed pleased with it,</p>
<p>and he called the lady in, and she went next door,</p>
<p>and in came Pablo Escobar,</p>
<p>and he introduced me to Pablo Escobar,</p>
<p>and he asked the same questions again,</p>
<p>and I answered him, and I asked him how much he paid,</p>
<p>and he paid $5,000 a kilo to haul it,</p>
<p>and so I said, how much you put on the plane?</p>
<p>He said 300, 500, so that&rsquo;s one and a half,</p>
<p>two and a half million dollars for an eight hour trip.</p>
<p>Sounded pretty good to me.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about cocaine.</p>
<p>Cocaine. And we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about Colombia.</p>
<p>Colombia, and cocaine, and Medellin cartel.</p>
<p>And Jorge Ochoa was one of the, what would you say,</p>
<p>founding members of the Medellin?</p>
<p>He was probably the brains behind the whole thing.</p>
<p>The brains, and spoke good English.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And they were nice people.</p>
<p>Really nice people.</p>
<p>Were you scared?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with your mind that you weren&rsquo;t scared?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some of the most dangerous men in this world,</p>
<p>and you weren&rsquo;t scared.</p>
<p>Well, I knew I was gonna do exactly what I said</p>
<p>I was gonna do.</p>
<p>Murray and the children were down there.</p>
<p>They went down and they stayed in the hotel,</p>
<p>five stars, treated royally on my first load.</p>
<p>And they just did ask security to make sure</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t a DEA agent.</p>
<p>So I did the first load,</p>
<p>and they can say they were hostages,</p>
<p>but they really weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It was just insurance.</p>
<p>So there was some integrity to the way they operated.</p>
<p>Completely.</p>
<p>I mean, straight up.</p>
<p>The money was ironed and banded,</p>
<p>banded and just right.</p>
<p>And the numbers were never once anything wrong with it.</p>
<p>What would you attribute that honesty to?</p>
<p>Within their own moral system and their own set of rules,</p>
<p>why weren&rsquo;t people crossing the line</p>
<p>and shaving off the top and injecting chaos</p>
<p>into the system to where it would be unpredictable</p>
<p>and people would be dishonest and greedy</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Most people are, but there&rsquo;s certain people</p>
<p>at the top of the food chain that they don&rsquo;t need that.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re completely honest,</p>
<p>then they don&rsquo;t have to think of,</p>
<p>remember the lie they told.</p>
<p>And plus they&rsquo;re just honest to start with.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making plenty of money.</p>
<p>They was making as much money as I did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you how that came about.</p>
<p>I understand that 10,000 people were killed every year</p>
<p>in Medellin, Colombia, and what they were doing,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have any organization.</p>
<p>And if one fellow had 10 kilos</p>
<p>and he wanted it shipped to New York,</p>
<p>he would tell his friend and his friend says,</p>
<p>sure, I&rsquo;ll ship it.</p>
<p>I have a pilot and I&rsquo;ll ship it up.</p>
<p>And then he would look in the newspapers,</p>
<p>oh, 40 kilos was busted in New Jersey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry, yours got busted.</p>
<p>Bang, bang, he&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>So here comes Jorge Ochoa and the three Ochoa brothers</p>
<p>and Pablo Escobar and Gacho.</p>
<p>And they decided that we will make an insurance company,</p>
<p>that we will charge you $10,000</p>
<p>to take it to your contact in Miami.</p>
<p>If it gets lost anywhere between the time I put it</p>
<p>on the airplane or the time you give it to us</p>
<p>and the time we give it to your man,</p>
<p>we will replace it in Colombia for you.</p>
<p>So there was no way anybody could lose.</p>
<p>And I understand they got a hundred tons piled up</p>
<p>under that insurance program.</p>
<p>And I was right there the first day.</p>
<p>So I had all the work I could do.</p>
<p>I would land and I said, when do you want me to come back?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re waiting on you, Senor.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask a difficult question.</p>
<p>Some see Escobar as a brutal murderer</p>
<p>and some see him as maybe a Robin Hood like figure</p>
<p>who helped the poor.</p>
<p>How do you see the man?</p>
<p>Both of them.</p>
<p>I think he started out to be honest with help the poor.</p>
<p>And then they had a war down there</p>
<p>and they blew up and killed his people.</p>
<p>And the country was divided almost equally three ways.</p>
<p>They had the military.</p>
<p>They were just as much into it as anybody.</p>
<p>And then you had the FARC guerrillas.</p>
<p>They had about a third of the country.</p>
<p>And then you had the Contras.</p>
<p>It was like the white farmers</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the ones that I was dealing with</p>
<p>and they were at war with one another.</p>
<p>And so if one of them started killing their people,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ll kill some of yours too.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how it happened.</p>
<p>And then when I heard about Pablo Escobar</p>
<p>blowing up that airliner</p>
<p>and killing those women and children,</p>
<p>I was sorry I ever shook his hand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brutal murder.</p>
<p>So you would say Escobar is not a good man?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Now, looking back on it, when I met him, he was good.</p>
<p>Did just exactly what he said he would do.</p>
<p>Could he be a bad man and a man you can trust?</p>
<p>Are those the things you&hellip;</p>
<p>Absolutely you could trust him, yes.</p>
<p>So from your perspective, in terms of business,</p>
<p>he was reliable, he was honest, had integrity.</p>
<p>You could work with him and he felt safe.</p>
<p>Completely.</p>
<p>We flew up to his ranch</p>
<p>and we brought out motorcycles to start with.</p>
<p>And can you ride a motorcycle?</p>
<p>Of course I can ride a motorcycle.</p>
<p>So I took off across the grass</p>
<p>and there was a little ditch there</p>
<p>and the front wheel dropped in that thing</p>
<p>and I must have slid across that grass 20 feet</p>
<p>before I got stopped.</p>
<p>He almost fell off of his bike waiting</p>
<p>because they knew what it was gonna do.</p>
<p>And then we got on horses and we went out there</p>
<p>and pretended to round up some cows</p>
<p>and he put a Mac 10 machine gun pistol over my shoulder.</p>
<p>Do you know how to use this?</p>
<p>Well, I never had, but it was all right.</p>
<p>I think it was like, okay, you got 10 bodyguards,</p>
<p>what do you need me for?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of time we laughed and talked</p>
<p>and drove some cows over the stumps.</p>
<p>You said Jorge Ochoa was perhaps the brains</p>
<p>of the Medellin cartel.</p>
<p>What was he like?</p>
<p>And why do you say he was the brains?</p>
<p>Well, he was a gentleman.</p>
<p>And I suppose he shipped,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t tell me how many more times of cocaine</p>
<p>than Pablo did.</p>
<p>Just him and his brothers,</p>
<p>you could tell by the, they had on each load,</p>
<p>they was in duffel bags and his big football shaped</p>
<p>fluffy stuff made with ether.</p>
<p>And they would have three horns on it</p>
<p>or a rattlesnake or four Xs on each bag.</p>
<p>You kind of got to knowing which was which</p>
<p>and they shipped a lot.</p>
<p>So, and he was just a gentleman.</p>
<p>I took the family, we went one weekend to his ranch</p>
<p>or his palatial place out near Barranquilla</p>
<p>and oh, he just treated the family.</p>
<p>His family had, his younger brother made a bull fight</p>
<p>and we had skiing and little airplanes on floats</p>
<p>on the water.</p>
<p>He was really nice and he was really nice.</p>
<p>How do you make sense of the tension</p>
<p>that a man could be a gentleman,</p>
<p>can have integrity, but also be a murderer?</p>
<p>Well, murder is a stronger word than killing.</p>
<p>Can you explain the line,</p>
<p>the gray area we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve just talking with Jocko Willing,</p>
<p>can we talk a lot about killing in the context</p>
<p>of military conflict in the context of war?</p>
<p>So there, there&rsquo;s a line between murder and killing</p>
<p>that you can draw.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the line that you&rsquo;re referring to?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something similar.</p>
<p>If people are shooting at you</p>
<p>and you shoot back and kill him,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not murder whatsoever.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to get away or out of the situation.</p>
<p>But if some woman don&rsquo;t pay you</p>
<p>and you send a hit man over to kill her</p>
<p>and her children, that&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Was Jorge involved in those kinds of things?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so at all.</p>
<p>I mean, he was just such a gentleman.</p>
<p>He had a restaurant before and he was just smart.</p>
<p>I understand that the first 10 kilos he sold,</p>
<p>he was sitting on a motorcycle in the sidelines</p>
<p>in a parking lot and when the DEA come in,</p>
<p>he sped away.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t come back to America.</p>
<p>He was just smart.</p>
<p>Some people just are savvy.</p>
<p>And he was such a gentleman.</p>
<p>And the whole family, the mother and the father,</p>
<p>the two brothers, their sister,</p>
<p>I was there when she was kidnapped.</p>
<p>And finally, he kidnapped our, I guess,</p>
<p>100 leaders of the FARC and said, all right,</p>
<p>when she don&rsquo;t come back,</p>
<p>none of these are gonna come back.</p>
<p>So they made a deal.</p>
<p>Is there something you can say about the power structure,</p>
<p>the hierarchy of the Medellin cartel</p>
<p>that you interacted with?</p>
<p>Was it a dictatorship where Pablo ran everything?</p>
<p>Was there a bunch of power centers?</p>
<p>Was it like a company where you have CEO, CTO kind of thing?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like managers</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>How did it run from a leadership perspective?</p>
<p>I understand that about five of them got together</p>
<p>and made this, I would call it an insurance company.</p>
<p>And now known as the Medellin Cartel.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t see any difference.</p>
<p>Each one of them had their own business.</p>
<p>And their people from the jungle or wherever made the cocaine,</p>
<p>gave it to them and they shipped it.</p>
<p>And so it didn&rsquo;t seem to be any power play</p>
<p>between them at all.</p>
<p>But my main contact was Jorge Ochoa</p>
<p>and Pablo Escobar was right there.</p>
<p>And I saw plenty of stuff for him too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s strange that they didn&rsquo;t betray each other regularly.</p>
<p>You know, greed makes men betray each other.</p>
<p>How do you explain that?</p>
<p>How much betrayal did you see?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see any, absolutely none.</p>
<p>If they shipped his 100 kilos, he got paid for it.</p>
<p>And if the other one shipped his,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they got paid for it.</p>
<p>How do you explain that?</p>
<p>Well, there was no need to.</p>
<p>The money was just unbelievable.</p>
<p>You think about 500 kilos in the plane</p>
<p>at $50,000 a kilo at the time.</p>
<p>And they paid $5,000 to ship it.</p>
<p>And they made 5,000 without even touching it.</p>
<p>They just had somebody to load it on through the airplane.</p>
<p>I gave it to their man in Miami.</p>
<p>They gave it to whoever it belonged to</p>
<p>by the marks on the duffel bags.</p>
<p>So they was making just untold millions.</p>
<p>Just no reason.</p>
<p>But greed can blind men.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still strange to me</p>
<p>that there was not more betrayal.</p>
<p>It speaks to something else perhaps</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bigger than money.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>But it seems like just like in the casino,</p>
<p>like you mentioned, we get accustomed</p>
<p>to whatever level of money we have,</p>
<p>we get accustomed very quickly.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a tension that&rsquo;s natural</p>
<p>between human beings.</p>
<p>And when that tension combined with money,</p>
<p>combined with power,</p>
<p>combined with, like you mentioned, beautiful women</p>
<p>and a bit of violence,</p>
<p>it seems that betrayal should be commonplace.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, not at all.</p>
<p>Carlos later, I don&rsquo;t know if he betrayed anybody,</p>
<p>but he started that.</p>
<p>He was running cocaine through the Bahamas</p>
<p>near the island.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>I was offered to fly with a DC3 with that,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>So I had my route through the old wells in Louisiana.</p>
<p>And so I wasn&rsquo;t gonna change,</p>
<p>but he talked a lot and I don&rsquo;t know if he betrayed,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t like him.</p>
<p>Yeah, so as you expand,</p>
<p>there could be tensions that lead to conflict.</p>
<p>Columbia was, like you said, an ultra violent place.</p>
<p>How did you survive?</p>
<p>Who protected you?</p>
<p>I was a hero.</p>
<p>They liked me.</p>
<p>I mean, I was just treated royally.</p>
<p>All I did, I would come over El Banco.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a radio station at the Forks of the Magdalena River.</p>
<p>I believe it was 720, if I remember right, on the AM.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d fly in at 10,000 feet</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d see below me there&rsquo;d be a Cessna.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d wiggle my wings and he&rsquo;d wiggle his</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d fall in behind him and we might go 100, 200 miles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d land on some jungle strip or some banana plantation.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d fuel me up.</p>
<p>I could eat steak in the night.</p>
<p>It was just like treated royally.</p>
<p>And I mean, take off the next morning whenever I wanted to.</p>
<p>It was just like that was protected.</p>
<p>And I was honored guest.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t anything like in that movie,</p>
<p>putting a gun to your head</p>
<p>and taking your sunglasses and betting.</p>
<p>So one time I complained to Jorge Ochoa</p>
<p>that the runway was pretty short that they were using.</p>
<p>And I went back down and it looked like</p>
<p>Los Angeles International.</p>
<p>They had bulldozers in there.</p>
<p>Had that thing 5,000 feet long.</p>
<p>Just like, just the next week it was all done.</p>
<p>The jungle was gone and clay put up there.</p>
<p>And all the while you were not afraid.</p>
<p>You were treated like royalty.</p>
<p>Yes, there I was.</p>
<p>I was afraid when I landed in the United States.</p>
<p>Well, maybe let&rsquo;s go back to the beginning.</p>
<p>What was the first time you flew an airplane</p>
<p>with drugs on it?</p>
<p>Tell me the story of the first time you smuggled drugs.</p>
<p>All right, I flew down to Jalapa, Veracruz</p>
<p>with a Cessna 182.</p>
<p>And we landed at the town.</p>
<p>It was a lovely town and just an old town.</p>
<p>Looked like Bible times.</p>
<p>People, women were washing your clothes in the streets</p>
<p>and with stone basins and the stream running through.</p>
<p>I just was just dumbstruck.</p>
<p>It was just so pretty.</p>
<p>And I went in a church and a Catholic church</p>
<p>and it had the stations of the cross</p>
<p>all carved magnificent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never seen that.</p>
<p>And I come home and told Mary about that.</p>
<p>That just almost brought tears to my eyes.</p>
<p>It was so beautiful.</p>
<p>And three o clock the next morning</p>
<p>I went out to the airport and taxied down to the taxiway</p>
<p>and there was a guard came out</p>
<p>and wanted to know what I was doing.</p>
<p>And I pulled out, I was on the fire department</p>
<p>at Redondo Beach, California.</p>
<p>So I pulled out my wallet and in it was</p>
<p>the fire department badge.</p>
<p>And oh, he shook my hand and was so glad.</p>
<p>So I taxied on down there and we loaded up</p>
<p>about 400 pounds in the plane.</p>
<p>And came on back and I was running to headwinds</p>
<p>more than I thought and I landed on a little strip.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about on the way back?</p>
<p>On the way back, on the way north</p>
<p>after we loaded up early in the morning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only time I ever got vertigo.</p>
<p>The mountains were coming down at a 30, 40 degree angle</p>
<p>and the Milky Way was overhead.</p>
<p>And somehow I wanted that airplane</p>
<p>to be level with the stars.</p>
<p>And it got me, it&rsquo;s a phenomenal pile of vertigo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only time I ever had it was on that load.</p>
<p>So anyway, the wind was on the nose of that system.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t gonna make it to the dry lake where I had fuel.</p>
<p>So I landed on a little bitty strip</p>
<p>and there was a little house.</p>
<p>It was caved in and it was a little boy named Lazarus,</p>
<p>about six or seven years old.</p>
<p>And he was herding some goats.</p>
<p>So we put the marijuana in that house</p>
<p>and the man stayed with it while I flew into some town</p>
<p>and got fuel and came back and we sat down</p>
<p>with the lunch that I brought back</p>
<p>and little Lazarus sat there and ate with us</p>
<p>and we had a good time.</p>
<p>We loaded on back and came on home.</p>
<p>Oh wow, I wonder where he is now.</p>
<p>So what was it like to fly,</p>
<p>maybe describe the details of, do you have to fly low?</p>
<p>Is there details that are unique to this experience</p>
<p>of flying an airplane with drugs on it, on board?</p>
<p>All right, well, one of the mistakes</p>
<p>that just thousands, hundreds and hundreds</p>
<p>and thousands of pilots make,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t stop at the border,</p>
<p>going down and get their permit.</p>
<p>Once you get a permit to be in Mexico,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got it for six months.</p>
<p>You can go anywhere, any fishing village,</p>
<p>any little town, any little place,</p>
<p>show them this and you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that, you go straight to jail.</p>
<p>So you go down there and you think,</p>
<p>okay, they&rsquo;re gonna have fuel for me to come back</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, Senor, that had a rusty leak in it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>Well, you better be able to go to town and get it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>And when I was coming back for several years,</p>
<p>I would fly up at Mexicali and cross the border</p>
<p>right at Calexico.</p>
<p>I would act like I was landing on the Calexico side</p>
<p>just after dark and then I&rsquo;d zip across the border</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d go over to the Salton Sea</p>
<p>and go below sea level, 100 and something feet,</p>
<p>I believe 170 feet, and come on up</p>
<p>and go out there above Palm Springs</p>
<p>and land at 29 Palms in the desert</p>
<p>and put my stuff under a Joshua tree</p>
<p>and fly into town and get my pickup</p>
<p>and go on back out and get it.</p>
<p>And that was fun.</p>
<p>And then it got really dangerous.</p>
<p>They had Operation Starlight, I believe was the name of it.</p>
<p>And they called a lot of pilots coming across the border.</p>
<p>So I changed it.</p>
<p>And by that time I was flying bigger planes.</p>
<p>I was flying Beach 18s.</p>
<p>And I would refuel in Mulahe halfway down</p>
<p>on the Baja Peninsula.</p>
<p>And then over in the middle,</p>
<p>20 miles from the nearest road was a goat ranch</p>
<p>where they milked goats and made cheese.</p>
<p>And I would go there and unload the load</p>
<p>coming up out of anywhere in Southern Mexico.</p>
<p>And I would land there and a guy named Juan</p>
<p>would put the marijuana under the trees</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d fly into Mulahe and they&rsquo;d wash my plane</p>
<p>and gas it up and I&rsquo;d eat a lunch</p>
<p>and rent a room for a few hours and take a nap and a shower</p>
<p>and then go back in the afternoon and fill up.</p>
<p>And then I would go Northwest out of there</p>
<p>and fly 200 miles off the coast of the island of Guadalupe.</p>
<p>And from there I would fly on a more Northwestern heading</p>
<p>about 300 miles out over the Pacific.</p>
<p>And then I would come in behind the Santa Barbara Islands</p>
<p>down low and then I&rsquo;d come up and go out in the desert land.</p>
<p>And I did that for the rest of their marijuana trips.</p>
<p>What was the hardest part about flying those routes?</p>
<p>The hardest part was getting good in marijuana.</p>
<p>So the hardest part isn&rsquo;t the flying.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the flying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like driving your car down.</p>
<p>But then I had people that would bring me on strips</p>
<p>that were just unworthy of an airplane.</p>
<p>Like when I&rsquo;d land on a highway and in the rainy season,</p>
<p>I would come back to land again</p>
<p>and the guy wouldn&rsquo;t think about it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d have like little hills on both sides</p>
<p>and the wings were out there.</p>
<p>Well, the grass and the weeds would grow up</p>
<p>and it sounded like, I mean,</p>
<p>it sounded like tearing the airplane apart</p>
<p>when those wings hit.</p>
<p>Mowing the grass down both shoulders of the airplane.</p>
<p>The weeds would grow up high in the tropics.</p>
<p>So some of that stuff was bad.</p>
<p>And oh, getting bad gasoline and telling me</p>
<p>that land here in the night</p>
<p>and knock the wheels off when you land.</p>
<p>Oh, you should have landed a little further up here,</p>
<p>Senor, they ditched down, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>What was it like landing on a highway</p>
<p>and when did you have to land on the highway?</p>
<p>I landed on the highway most of my life, most of the times.</p>
<p>In Mexico, first time I went down,</p>
<p>there was a place called Pichalingi</p>
<p>and it had a 900 foot strip.</p>
<p>And I would fly down and I&rsquo;d carry gasoline wing with me</p>
<p>and Maury and I would go to the grocery store</p>
<p>and buy all kinds of little goodies and candies</p>
<p>and toys to bring to the children.</p>
<p>And that sand strip in the bend of a river</p>
<p>was just too short to take off with a load.</p>
<p>So there was a young man there named Pedro,</p>
<p>must not weigh much over 100, maybe 120 pounds.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d get in a plane with me</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d direct me 20, 30, 40 miles away to a highway.</p>
<p>And the people walk in and the people would pull out</p>
<p>in a two ton truck with a machine gun on it</p>
<p>and a bunch of guys with arms with us</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d block the road</p>
<p>and then another one would block it up about a mile away.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d land right over that truck</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d load me up and it looked like a bucket brigade</p>
<p>with the marijuana coming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d shake hands with all of them</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d take off right over the other trucks.</p>
<p>And sometimes maybe 20, 30, 40 cars lined up.</p>
<p>One time I remember a patrol car, a highway patrol car,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have his lights on, took off right over him.</p>
<p>And then when I started flying to Louisiana,</p>
<p>the bridge over the Mississippi River,</p>
<p>there were several contractors that went broke</p>
<p>and that thing was out for years.</p>
<p>And about five miles from the river</p>
<p>was flashing red lights and a detour.</p>
<p>And then they swamp on both sides of it</p>
<p>and the middle of it we&rsquo;re growing up with 20 feet trees</p>
<p>and that was like an international runway</p>
<p>from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>So I landed on that and over and over those red lights</p>
<p>just like the end of a runway.</p>
<p>And then the next morning we&rsquo;d go out there</p>
<p>and scrub the marks off the highway where I&rsquo;d landed</p>
<p>before daylight.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to somebody you&rsquo;ve known well,</p>
<p>somebody who&rsquo;s also a drug smuggler is Barry Seal.</p>
<p>Who is Barry Seal?</p>
<p>How did you meet him?</p>
<p>Barry Seal is a friend of mine.</p>
<p>Murray and I and the children went down in Honduras</p>
<p>and we went up Lake Azul, I believe it was,</p>
<p>and we were looking at a ranch to buy.</p>
<p>I was looking for something in Central America</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;d have a halfway place.</p>
<p>Oh, it was lovely.</p>
<p>We stayed up there for some days and our clothes got muddy</p>
<p>and we went in the river and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>So we got to San Pedro Sula</p>
<p>and we was going back to New Orleans.</p>
<p>So we went to the cleaners to get our clothes</p>
<p>and most all of them was in there.</p>
<p>And they go, oh, Senor, they&rsquo;ll be ready tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not ready now.</p>
<p>Well, the plane leaves at nine o clock or whatever.</p>
<p>So I told Murray for her and the children</p>
<p>to go into the airport because it&rsquo;d be easier</p>
<p>for one just on a standby flight.</p>
<p>So I went to the laundromat for the clothes</p>
<p>and they were ready and there was a pile of them.</p>
<p>And I put them on my back and got in a taxi</p>
<p>and the old taxi would drive him with it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d give him a hundred dollars to go faster</p>
<p>and he just blew his horn more rapid.</p>
<p>So finally we got to the airport</p>
<p>and I jumped out and ran around on the tarmac</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s a brand new 727 taxiing out.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m waving to the pilot and he&rsquo;s a young fella.</p>
<p>He waves back.</p>
<p>Then I see Murray&rsquo;s face in the cockpit</p>
<p>and the nose goes down where he puts on brakes</p>
<p>and he laughs and he puts some stairwell out.</p>
<p>And I run for the stairwell and he pulls it back up</p>
<p>and goes like a hitchhiker going to pick you up</p>
<p>and go again.</p>
<p>Then he put it out and I got on and the whole crowd clapped</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m coming home with that load of clothes.</p>
<p>So I go way down in the middle and the plane&rsquo;s full</p>
<p>and Miriam, my daughter, was about nine years old then</p>
<p>and she was sitting in the middle</p>
<p>and by the window was Barry Seal.</p>
<p>Of course I didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>And I sat in the middle and we took off</p>
<p>and the wheels come up with clunk</p>
<p>and then I got up about 5,000 feet</p>
<p>and we had a little clunk and she said,</p>
<p>what was that, daddy?</p>
<p>And I said, he just turned on his autopilot.</p>
<p>And that fella reached over and I looked at him.</p>
<p>I said, he looks like CIA or FBI, something.</p>
<p>He ain&rsquo;t supposed to be here.</p>
<p>Clear blue eyes, gentleman looking man.</p>
<p>And he said, you fly these things?</p>
<p>I said, I got a few hours, mister.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;ll fly them too or something.</p>
<p>And he said, my name&rsquo;s Barry Seal.</p>
<p>And he reached over Miriam and shook hands</p>
<p>and we got to talking and I thought,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no choice of seats on this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just open seating so I don&rsquo;t believe him one bit.</p>
<p>And he started talking about,</p>
<p>he just got out of jail that morning.</p>
<p>Just got out of prison.</p>
<p>And I said, uh huh.</p>
<p>And he told me that he&rsquo;d been a pilot</p>
<p>with the TWA and this and other.</p>
<p>And told me what he was for.</p>
<p>So we had a nice conversation</p>
<p>for a couple hours to New Orleans.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t believe him.</p>
<p>So he got off in front of us</p>
<p>and what a crowd of people to meet him.</p>
<p>An old mother and a wife and little children</p>
<p>hanging on to him, crying and hugging and kissing him.</p>
<p>I said, he was telling the truth.</p>
<p>So I reached over and gave him a little piece of paper.</p>
<p>I had Murray to write it out with our address.</p>
<p>I said, Barry, I might have some work for you.</p>
<p>Come on out.</p>
<p>What was he in jail for?</p>
<p>He got caught with 100 kilos of cocaine in a small plane.</p>
<p>And so he served a year.</p>
<p>And that was from Colombia?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where it come from.</p>
<p>He got caught in Honduras, probably refueling.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;d been in prison down there before</p>
<p>for bringing explosives to the Cuban Contras.</p>
<p>And he lost his job with the airlines.</p>
<p>And then later on, I found out he was ex CIA</p>
<p>and George Bush Sr.&rsquo;s protege</p>
<p>and had a thousand parachute jumps and was there.</p>
<p>He was a hot shot model.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million questions I wanna ask here.</p>
<p>But maybe can we linger on a little bit longer?</p>
<p>What was your relationship with him like?</p>
<p>You were a drug smuggler.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a drug smuggler.</p>
<p>Your friends, how often do you guys talk?</p>
<p>How often do you work together?</p>
<p>What was the relationship like?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll back up and finish where I started off there.</p>
<p>I gave him the things, Barry,</p>
<p>I may have some work for you.</p>
<p>I know I got some work for you.</p>
<p>And I said, come out to Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know, a week or two later,</p>
<p>he flew out and went to our house</p>
<p>and stayed with us a couple of days.</p>
<p>And I had a almost brand new Aero Commander 690B.</p>
<p>That thing with turbo prop and it was hot.</p>
<p>It was the hottest thing I&rsquo;d ever had.</p>
<p>So I said, let&rsquo;s go Barry, let&rsquo;s see what you can do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sorry I said that.</p>
<p>We got about 10,000 feet.</p>
<p>And he was like one of them blue angel pilots.</p>
<p>He rung that thing out.</p>
<p>And I said, that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>And then he did a falling leaf.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you cut the engines</p>
<p>and the plane falls from side to side.</p>
<p>And I saw Bob Hoover do that in the air show once.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only person I ever saw do it.</p>
<p>And I was, my hands was white knuckle hanging onto the seat.</p>
<p>You shut off the engine?</p>
<p>Yeah, he shut off the engines</p>
<p>and landed flying side by side like this.</p>
<p>How do you explain that?</p>
<p>Was he just a wild man</p>
<p>or was he sufficiently skilled to work?</p>
<p>He was sufficiently skilled.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>He knew what he was doing.</p>
<p>I can get a plane from one spot to another</p>
<p>and I guess I&rsquo;m known as a good pilot,</p>
<p>but that guy, it was an aerobatic.</p>
<p>So anyway, he stayed with us a couple of days.</p>
<p>And then I told him, I said, this plane needs tanking.</p>
<p>And I said, I got some work down in Columbia.</p>
<p>It needs to come back to Louisiana.</p>
<p>And I need 2,500 mile range.</p>
<p>He said, I got somebody in Mena, Arkansas</p>
<p>to do that and keep their mouth shut.</p>
<p>So I gave him $10,000 and he flew away.</p>
<p>And in a few days he called me and says,</p>
<p>come to my house in Baton Rouge.</p>
<p>So I went out to his house in Baton Rouge</p>
<p>and I stayed with him for a few days.</p>
<p>And that plane was tanked.</p>
<p>I mean, beautiful from stem to stern.</p>
<p>I could went from Bolivia to Canada with it.</p>
<p>So then I hired him to fly.</p>
<p>And he was funny.</p>
<p>I paid him a million dollars a trip.</p>
<p>I paid him $2,000 a kilo, so about a million dollar trip.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t get paid until the people received it.</p>
<p>They had to ship it to Chicago and New York</p>
<p>and then the money come back.</p>
<p>So it was a couple of two or three weeks pipeline.</p>
<p>Well, I always had to pay him before he&rsquo;d go again.</p>
<p>I mean, and he barely ache.</p>
<p>I mean, he had moaning room.</p>
<p>So one time I gave him a million dollars</p>
<p>and I put it in a box real nice.</p>
<p>So how big is a box that contains a million dollars?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about a hundred dollar bills?</p>
<p>A hundred dollar bill, it&rsquo;s not very big.</p>
<p>You can put it in a large briefcase.</p>
<p>It weighs exactly 10 kilos.</p>
<p>Each bill weighs a gram, so you can weigh your money</p>
<p>and almost get it exactly right.</p>
<p>20 something pounds is a million dollars.</p>
<p>22 pounds.</p>
<p>A hundred dollar bills.</p>
<p>But in one dollar bills, it&rsquo;s one ton, 2,200 pounds.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even accept them.</p>
<p>Were you the one that introduced Barry Seal</p>
<p>to Pablo Escobar?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t introduce him at all.</p>
<p>And our deal was that you don&rsquo;t meet my people.</p>
<p>I mean, we just kind of crossed your working for me</p>
<p>to fly the airplanes.</p>
<p>So he wanted these Panther conversions</p>
<p>that cost $400,000 each with a storm scope and radar.</p>
<p>I bought anything you want.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>Panther conversions?</p>
<p>Panther conversion was, these people called Panther,</p>
<p>they took everything out from the firewall,</p>
<p>the instruments and all and converted them</p>
<p>and put Q tip propellers on them full bladed</p>
<p>and you very quiet and the CIA developed those</p>
<p>in Southeast Asia for running behind the lines.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where Barry had flown those things</p>
<p>so he knew about them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what he wanted and that&rsquo;s what we got him.</p>
<p>How does that connect to Pablo?</p>
<p>And so he worked for you and you got those upgrades.</p>
<p>I think he flew about 30 loads for me</p>
<p>and then I got arrested and was for everything in the world.</p>
<p>Got 35 years sentence.</p>
<p>But let me back up a little bit.</p>
<p>Barry was our friend.</p>
<p>Mari and I are both friends.</p>
<p>We should pause real quick and say Mari is your wife</p>
<p>and hopefully we&rsquo;ll convince her to join us in a little bit.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the love of your life and sort of she weaves in</p>
<p>and out of many of these stories that you tell.</p>
<p>Yes, she was there.</p>
<p>She was behind the scenes.</p>
<p>But I kept her out of it completely.</p>
<p>And then also you mentioned Mariam as your daughter.</p>
<p>Yes, our son was a baby.</p>
<p>And I remember we went out to a festival,</p>
<p>was my favorite restaurant in Carl Gables.</p>
<p>Oh God, it was good.</p>
<p>And Barry knew about it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, we went out to dinner</p>
<p>and so we came back and there was no rooms.</p>
<p>So Barry will spend the night with us.</p>
<p>So he goes to our hotel room with us</p>
<p>and we got two big beds in the Omni Hotel</p>
<p>and he lays over there and he gets down</p>
<p>to his stripy undershorts and his T shirt</p>
<p>and he puts the baby up on his belly</p>
<p>and gives him the bottle and said,</p>
<p>mm, ain&rsquo;t that good, Red?</p>
<p>Oh my, my.</p>
<p>And he just feeds the baby.</p>
<p>We laugh and talk and that&rsquo;s how close we were</p>
<p>that we could all stay in a hotel room together.</p>
<p>And would you say he&rsquo;s a good man?</p>
<p>Oh, wonderful man.</p>
<p>A gentleman, Southern gentleman.</p>
<p>Just looked after his mother, his family,</p>
<p>everybody around him, everybody loved Barry.</p>
<p>He just had a little smile on his face always.</p>
<p>So you got arrested and then what happened to Barry?</p>
<p>Well, Barry knew the people that unloaded.</p>
<p>Of course he sent the cars down and all that.</p>
<p>So he met the unloader, a guy named Lito,</p>
<p>Luis Carlos Bustamante of Venezuelan.</p>
<p>So he just kept on flying.</p>
<p>But he, I believe he had three of my airplanes</p>
<p>at $400,000 a piece and they owed me some money.</p>
<p>Well, he collected a lot of that and gave Marie the money</p>
<p>and put it in his safe and took her to his house</p>
<p>and all after I got arrested and sent a lawyer in.</p>
<p>He got me the best lawyer in the country, Albert Krieger.</p>
<p>He was head of the defense team for all of America.</p>
<p>Wonderful man.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of the months</p>
<p>that led up to Barry&rsquo;s assassination?</p>
<p>What did you know, what did you sense, what did you think?</p>
<p>Okay, when I got out of prison, I hadn&rsquo;t been out long.</p>
<p>I was eating breakfast and there was Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>right in the television.</p>
<p>We have absolute proof that the communist</p>
<p>Sandinista government is in the cocaine running business.</p>
<p>And there was that fat lady, the C126 on the runway</p>
<p>with the belly down and I thought, oh God, he had done it.</p>
<p>So I had heard that Barry might&rsquo;ve been working with him.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t long before.</p>
<p>Working with?</p>
<p>With the DEA or whoever, he was no longer on our side.</p>
<p>So can you clarify how you got that</p>
<p>from the Reagan making a statement about we&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>Okay, there was his plane.</p>
<p>There was Barry&rsquo;s plane and okay, on the way north,</p>
<p>we could stop in Nicaragua and land on a military base</p>
<p>or on a base that they used as crop dusters and all</p>
<p>and refuel and so that shortened our trip.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d go further into the jungle and come up</p>
<p>and that was what Pablo Escobar and Ochoa and them</p>
<p>and they was associates with the people in Nicaragua.</p>
<p>So Barry was, if that plane was there,</p>
<p>that means Barry was feeding the DEA information.</p>
<p>He was working with them at that time.</p>
<p>But let me back up a little bit.</p>
<p>When I was flying and I told Barry,</p>
<p>we would refuel in Trange Airplane,</p>
<p>the loads in Belize where I had a spot up there</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s when they told me</p>
<p>we can refuel in Nicaragua and then you fly all the way</p>
<p>and Barry couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>He says, all right, but I wanted you to land.</p>
<p>I had a place in Louisiana for $10,000</p>
<p>that I could unload and the sheriff and all them was paid off.</p>
<p>And he said, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get caught in Meena, Arkansas.</p>
<p>I said, what do you mean you can&rsquo;t get caught</p>
<p>in Meena, Arkansas?</p>
<p>You get caught anywhere.</p>
<p>He said, I can&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s gonna cost you $50,000</p>
<p>every time my wheels touch the ground.</p>
<p>Why, can you explain why he can&rsquo;t get caught</p>
<p>in Meena, Arkansas?</p>
<p>He said he was hooked up with him at the very top</p>
<p>and he even said, I&rsquo;m gonna have dinner</p>
<p>with the governor tonight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at that time.</p>
<p>Meena, Arkansas.</p>
<p>Mr. Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, did Bill Clinton,</p>
<p>did you give him any money?</p>
<p>And I said, no, I never gave the man any money,</p>
<p>but it was like the money that I had</p>
<p>that went to Grand Cayman Islands</p>
<p>and I told my lawyer, I said, I never touched that money.</p>
<p>He said, you don&rsquo;t have to fondle it to be guilty.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So what, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of conspiracy theories</p>
<p>around the relationship between Barry Seal and the Clintons.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>What evidence do we have?</p>
<p>What would you say from your best understanding</p>
<p>of what was the relationship</p>
<p>between Bill Clinton and Barry Seal?</p>
<p>Barry said, and he knew that he couldn&rsquo;t get caught</p>
<p>in Meena, Arkansas.</p>
<p>And when that movie was gonna come out,</p>
<p>be called Meena, somebody stopped it.</p>
<p>I mean, they stopped it dead in the tracks</p>
<p>for two or three years and the producer even quit.</p>
<p>You mean the American Made with Tom Cruise movie?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t American.</p>
<p>It was gonna be called Meena?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the name that was written and produced in Meena.</p>
<p>And waiting on Hillary to be elected,</p>
<p>they would not let that movie out.</p>
<p>And that movie was changed drastically.</p>
<p>But to push back on that,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s truth there.</p>
<p>That means they were worried about</p>
<p>the power of the conspiracy theory, which stuck.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, some conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re popular doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re true.</p>
<p>And ones that, but it also doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not true.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s ones that are not very popular</p>
<p>that could be true.</p>
<p>But that one really stuck.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>Well, I paid one and a half million dollars</p>
<p>for Barry to land at Meena, Arkansas.</p>
<p>So I was pretty well assured that he couldn&rsquo;t get caught.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I can&rsquo;t get caught in Columbia.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t get caught in Nicaragua.</p>
<p>I guess we got a license.</p>
<p>So we went for it.</p>
<p>Oh, so when you say I can&rsquo;t get caught,</p>
<p>just to clarify, there&rsquo;s a sense</p>
<p>where this is a safe place to land.</p>
<p>Yes, like completely safe.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think he was referring</p>
<p>to some kind of, you know,</p>
<p>like my grandfather who fought in World War II</p>
<p>would talk about bullets can&rsquo;t hit him.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like believing.</p>
<p>He was taking that $50,000 and giving it to somebody.</p>
<p>And Barry was honest.</p>
<p>So he wasn&rsquo;t just taking it from me</p>
<p>because he was making a million dollars.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t care for the $50,000.</p>
<p>Oh man, taking the story forward,</p>
<p>the months leading up to his assassination,</p>
<p>what would you understand why he was assassinated?</p>
<p>Who were the players involved?</p>
<p>Maybe could you have stopped it?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, after I saw Reagan&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>on the television saying we have the absolute proof,</p>
<p>the phone rang and it was Barry.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t heard from him in a couple of years.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m coming out tonight, Roger.</p>
<p>And I, oh boy.</p>
<p>So he came out and he said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll meet you in this French restaurant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know it in Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>And I walked in, there&rsquo;s about 20 or 30 people in there.</p>
<p>And they was all 30, 40 years old,</p>
<p>women with plastic or leather skirts</p>
<p>and me in the blue jeans.</p>
<p>And I looked around and Barry was at the back.</p>
<p>He was leaned up, he had gained weight.</p>
<p>And I walked up and I said, Barry, you wired.</p>
<p>He said, no.</p>
<p>I said, well, I&rsquo;m not gonna talk to these DE agents.</p>
<p>He said, every one of them.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Oh, with jeans and skirts, I like it.</p>
<p>I said, well, Barry, I&rsquo;m gonna set you</p>
<p>and you just talk to me, buddy,</p>
<p>and tell me what&rsquo;s on your mind.</p>
<p>And he sat there and he just went to talking.</p>
<p>And he told me about, he was left holding a bag.</p>
<p>And it.</p>
<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>Like that nobody&rsquo;s supported him?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s something or another.</p>
<p>He was, and I don&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>I mean, this is just what happened, putting it all together.</p>
<p>He had some CIA buddies that was pretending</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to supply all of our Northwood arms.</p>
<p>And with that, you can land cocaine back here by the ton.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s taking his little planes and putting some AK 47s</p>
<p>and maybe ammunition or whatever,</p>
<p>and takes it down to the Contras</p>
<p>against the Communist Party of Nicaragua,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve been landing.</p>
<p>And Oliver North was involved in this.</p>
<p>So when all that, and so his CIA buddies</p>
<p>was certainly involved, and we know they were.</p>
<p>And Barry had been in the CIA earlier</p>
<p>when he first got out of school.</p>
<p>So when, as I say, the shit hit the fan,</p>
<p>they all fled and left Barry holding the bag.</p>
<p>The CIA and the DEA.</p>
<p>Yeah, not the DEA, the CIA.</p>
<p>The DEA wasn&rsquo;t in on it.</p>
<p>The CIA was selling that cocaine, bringing it in.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, what&rsquo;s Iran Contra scandal?</p>
<p>What was the alleged involvement of the CIA</p>
<p>in using drug trade to fund things?</p>
<p>What do you know?</p>
<p>What do you think is true?</p>
<p>What should we know?</p>
<p>Well, I know what I knew was true,</p>
<p>that Barry was taking a small amount of arms</p>
<p>back to Central America and giving them to</p>
<p>whoever Oliver North group were.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s Oliver North?</p>
<p>Oliver North was a colonel that got implemented</p>
<p>and almost brought the government down.</p>
<p>And so they said, all right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting the guns from Iran</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re taking cocaine to pay for them.</p>
<p>And since Congress won&rsquo;t give us money to fight this war,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna circumvent it.</p>
<p>So that was a whole thing.</p>
<p>So it was a CIA&rsquo;s effort to circumvent</p>
<p>the funding mechanisms of government by selling drugs.</p>
<p>Yes, but it was a handful of renegade CIA agents</p>
<p>that were Barry&rsquo;s friends that was making a load,</p>
<p>a load of money, tons of it come up.</p>
<p>If you would like to read the book,</p>
<p>The Big White Lie, The CIA and the Crack Cocaine Epidemic,</p>
<p>the CIA put, according to this,</p>
<p>the book and Michael Levine,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t remember his name last time I talked,</p>
<p>wrote that book and he was a head CIA agent,</p>
<p>he was a head DEA agent that exposed this.</p>
<p>And the CIA tried to kill him.</p>
<p>And he says, they put crack cocaine, they developed,</p>
<p>their chemists developed crack.</p>
<p>And they put it in every city in the United States</p>
<p>on one weekend.</p>
<p>So they were bringing it up by the tons</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>And Barry was bringing it.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a small tangent question?</p>
<p>Do you think the public should trust the CIA and the DEA?</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;re mostly good people</p>
<p>that are carrying out a good mission?</p>
<p>Because this kind of makes it sound</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s renegade agents that are just doing</p>
<p>whatever the hell they want</p>
<p>and with sometimes no regard for human life.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s certainly true.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not everybody in there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, sometimes you get a few policemen</p>
<p>in the department that do these things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe, I believe that our government is good.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve got some fools running it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we get them there,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think I know.</p>
<p>Okay, so what was Barry&rsquo;s involvement here?</p>
<p>So Barry leaned back in that chair</p>
<p>and he told me that he got caught with one and a half tons</p>
<p>and he bellied it in the runway in Nicaragua</p>
<p>and had cameras flashing inside and out.</p>
<p>And he flew it back to Homestead with an agent there</p>
<p>and he brought the agent over, Jake Jacobson.</p>
<p>Really nice fellow, I think he was a crop duster.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d have got along if we&rsquo;d have been on the right side.</p>
<p>And so we sat there and drank Chevy&rsquo;s Regal</p>
<p>until I got pie eyed and Barry told me about it.</p>
<p>He said that he went to see Edwin Meese.</p>
<p>He flew his, he got out on bail</p>
<p>and he flew his Lear jet up to Washington</p>
<p>and went in to see the Attorney General, Edwin Meese.</p>
<p>And they run him out of the office.</p>
<p>The next day he went back and said,</p>
<p>I have absolute proof that the CIA</p>
<p>is bringing tons of cocaine</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re running tons of cocaine into the United States.</p>
<p>And Edwin Meese put him up with this agent Jacobson.</p>
<p>I believe it was.</p>
<p>And they went down and got one and a half tons.</p>
<p>And on the way back, they bellied it in</p>
<p>and Pablo Escobar and some of the other ones</p>
<p>on general there in Nicaragua,</p>
<p>you can see them toting it from one plane to the other</p>
<p>in the book called The Big Kings of Cocaine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a mention of me too.</p>
<p>And also the other one has a mention of me in it.</p>
<p>Said I&rsquo;m in more files for the DEA than Noriega.</p>
<p>So who was wanting to get rid of Barry?</p>
<p>Is that, who wanted to get rid of Barry more?</p>
<p>The cartels or the CIA?</p>
<p>The cartel.</p>
<p>But so Barry leaned back and he told me the story.</p>
<p>And the tears came down between his fingers</p>
<p>as he put his hands over his eyes.</p>
<p>And he said, I just couldn&rsquo;t do it, Roger.</p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t do three life sentences.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve told him everything.</p>
<p>I went to Congress and I&rsquo;ve testified before Congress.</p>
<p>He testified before Congress</p>
<p>for all these things that he had done.</p>
<p>And he said, I told him all about you,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re under my umbrella.</p>
<p>You got to testify with me before grand jury in Miami.</p>
<p>And so the guy said, you can come down,</p>
<p>the DEA said you can come down tomorrow with Mari,</p>
<p>first class, or I&rsquo;ll take you down in chains.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t testify with Barry,</p>
<p>the only place you&rsquo;ll ever see your wife and family again</p>
<p>is in a federal prison visiting room.</p>
<p>Was that a difficult conversation?</p>
<p>Oh, my guts was just like ice water.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t testify against my friends.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>How am I going to do it?</p>
<p>I just, I can&rsquo;t work with people.</p>
<p>And he was honest with me.</p>
<p>How am I going to testify against them?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t spend the rest of my life in a federal prison.</p>
<p>What on earth, what a mess, Barry, you&rsquo;ve got me into.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Is that a kind of betrayal there?</p>
<p>Yes, but it&rsquo;s still, I wish he left me out of it.</p>
<p>I understand him getting in such a mess that he told,</p>
<p>because if the CIA and whoever else was behind him</p>
<p>betrayed him, then he&rsquo;s going to tell everything.</p>
<p>So I says, all right, I&rsquo;ll be in Miami.</p>
<p>So Mari and I flew down first class.</p>
<p>And I went to a lawyer,</p>
<p>one of the biggest lawyers in Miami.</p>
<p>And I said, man, I am in a mess.</p>
<p>This fellow&rsquo;s told everything and I&rsquo;ve got to say something,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not a snitch, man.</p>
<p>I mean, what can I do?</p>
<p>And he said, well, being a snitch is like being pregnant.</p>
<p>You either are or you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And he says, I don&rsquo;t represent snitches,</p>
<p>but if you want to fight this case,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do it for $600,000.</p>
<p>And boy, my face turned red.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not a snitch.</p>
<p>He said, well, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>He said, let me tell you something.</p>
<p>If you go in there and say one thing and sign that paper</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t tell them everything you know,</p>
<p>then they will convict you of everything you&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>and you tell them.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So I said, Barry, I&rsquo;m having trouble with a lawyer.</p>
<p>Give it, I&rsquo;ll go to Mari, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>He said, all right, use my lawyer.</p>
<p>And he gave me his card, the lawyer&rsquo;s card.</p>
<p>So Mari and I went to the festival restaurant that night</p>
<p>and Barry and Debbie came in.</p>
<p>She was dressed pretty and Barry wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So we was already about finished.</p>
<p>So we had dessert together.</p>
<p>And I said, Barry, they&rsquo;re going to kill you, friend.</p>
<p>He said, no, they ain&rsquo;t going to kill me.</p>
<p>So and so, such and such is gone.</p>
<p>And this and the other.</p>
<p>I said, Barry, they&rsquo;re going to kill you, man.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t deny it.</p>
<p>And I said, I didn&rsquo;t tell him I wasn&rsquo;t going to testify.</p>
<p>So I hugged his neck.</p>
<p>I really, like, and we fled to Brazil.</p>
<p>But I took Mari and the children and went to Brazil.</p>
<p>So you decided there you&rsquo;re not going to stay.</p>
<p>I knew, I didn&rsquo;t know what I could do.</p>
<p>I talked to a lawyer.</p>
<p>I mean, I just didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t know what I could do,</p>
<p>but the best in Miami said what he told me.</p>
<p>So I had to go.</p>
<p>And you went to Brazil.</p>
<p>We went to Brazil.</p>
<p>Did you have a conversation with anybody at the cartel?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s such an interesting moment</p>
<p>that tests the man&rsquo;s character to not snitch.</p>
<p>And did you have a conversation with anybody?</p>
<p>No. Pablo with, about it.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just understood.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t, couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But how many men like you are there?</p>
<p>Not many.</p>
<p>I had all my friends testified against me.</p>
<p>I had 11 friends and every one of them put their finger up.</p>
<p>Roger did it.</p>
<p>And I was facing life,</p>
<p>continuing criminal enterprise care.</p>
<p>And still you couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Did you ever get respect from the cartels for that,</p>
<p>from the people in the cartel?</p>
<p>Oh, there was a whole time I got back and stuff.</p>
<p>They owe me money and I can&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s about money.</p>
<p>I just mean about human beings.</p>
<p>Oh, I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been back down there and I&rsquo;ve been welcomed.</p>
<p>I have my contact.</p>
<p>And when I was in Brazil,</p>
<p>I was trying to get this money.</p>
<p>They owe me three and a half million dollars.</p>
<p>So I called up there and he was going to pay me.</p>
<p>Oh, I got 600,000 today and I&rsquo;ll get you some more tomorrow.</p>
<p>And then the next week I called,</p>
<p>hey, hey, got great news, great news.</p>
<p>Barry Seale has been killed.</p>
<p>So, oh no.</p>
<p>And I went back to the hotel.</p>
<p>We was up in the northern part of Brazil</p>
<p>and where was it, Marty?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been quite a job.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so I went back and I told Mary and Miriam</p>
<p>and they cried and I cried.</p>
<p>I really cried.</p>
<p>How is that great news from the cartel perspective?</p>
<p>Well, now there&rsquo;s no case against me and him and them.</p>
<p>Do you know who killed them?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you about that story.</p>
<p>On the first load I did,</p>
<p>I landed at a banana plantation and it was raining</p>
<p>and it was a muddy strip, clay.</p>
<p>And they put the 300 kilos of cocaine</p>
<p>and then the ugliest man you could imagine,</p>
<p>named Ronaldo got in there with a Mac 10</p>
<p>and he was making sure I took it to Louisiana.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>This is many years before.</p>
<p>Yeah, a couple of years before.</p>
<p>So anyway,</p>
<p>we took off and the mud got up in the wheel well</p>
<p>so thick until the wheels wouldn&rsquo;t come up.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m going 200 miles an hour</p>
<p>instead of 300 miles an hour with wheels coming down.</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t go back there.</p>
<p>If I do, I&rsquo;m gonna be in the same situation</p>
<p>until the sun dries it out in a few days.</p>
<p>And so, but in Belize, I had a runway</p>
<p>that had been used for $10,000 used to refuel.</p>
<p>So I told the guy, listen,</p>
<p>we got to land in Belize to refuel.</p>
<p>No, no, no, we put the Mac 10 and I&rsquo;ll shoot you.</p>
<p>Go ahead, fool, you&rsquo;re gonna die too.</p>
<p>So it was in a term.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t just ugly, he was also angry.</p>
<p>He was a bad, bad killer.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s the one to actually kill Barry.</p>
<p>The one that went up on the first load with me.</p>
<p>And Ronaldo, and he&rsquo;s doing life.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a killer.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s doing life in Louisiana.</p>
<p>I wonder who, is it known who made that decision?</p>
<p>The younger Ochoa brother, I understand, Fabio,</p>
<p>which one paid for the hit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that, but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>and it probably sounds about right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done in Jessup, Georgia, doing a long, long time.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s about to get out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been in 30 years or whatever.</p>
<p>The movie American Made.</p>
<p>What do you think that movie got right?</p>
<p>What did it get wrong?</p>
<p>Almost everything wrong.</p>
<p>It was disgustingly wrong.</p>
<p>Okay, which parts?</p>
<p>Can you maybe elaborate?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about Barry Seal and it just didn&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>it was nothing, whoever wrote it had no idea</p>
<p>who Barry Seal was.</p>
<p>They sat in a rocking chair and just tried to think of</p>
<p>what was some baby bashing drug dealer doing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, God, you just don&rsquo;t have any idea</p>
<p>of the spirit of the man.</p>
<p>So they wanted just to try to tell a fun story</p>
<p>without actually studying the story.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know him, they just had no idea.</p>
<p>And Barry was such a nice person,</p>
<p>such a really nice gentleman person.</p>
<p>They talked to you or no?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The people that made the movie.</p>
<p>And I see all these people telling Barry never met him.</p>
<p>They telling all about him.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just ridiculous.</p>
<p>And for one thing, for his character coming out</p>
<p>of warehouses and all that, that was just like ugly.</p>
<p>And then down in Columbia, putting a gun to his head,</p>
<p>going to take his sunglasses and then he put $25,000</p>
<p>million worth of cocaine on his plane.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re going to bet $100</p>
<p>he don&rsquo;t have enough room to take off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just insane.</p>
<p>I mean, just the whole thing.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s talking to the DEA agents when he&rsquo;s coming up.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what frequency they own,</p>
<p>how he&rsquo;s got five planes and they all split</p>
<p>when the DEA comes out.</p>
<p>These are just somebody just fantasy.</p>
<p>But those are like, those are details of the man,</p>
<p>details of the story.</p>
<p>Is there some big profound things they missed</p>
<p>about just this whole period?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really important to you</p>
<p>that was missed.</p>
<p>Yes, they just tried to sensationalize</p>
<p>on little things that people remember.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>It was just like a business deal and good people</p>
<p>and good airplanes and good flying.</p>
<p>And it was like a good watch that was made.</p>
<p>It just clicked and it just went on.</p>
<p>And they missed all of that.</p>
<p>They tried to make it sound like it&rsquo;s something very ugly.</p>
<p>Do you think it was a story</p>
<p>that could have been told way better</p>
<p>and still be a hell of a good story?</p>
<p>Oh my goodness, yes.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a series called Chernobyl done by HBO.</p>
<p>And because I have sort of family connected to that period,</p>
<p>they did an incredible job of being historically accurate</p>
<p>and only not being historically accurate</p>
<p>when it helped the story, only in those rare cases.</p>
<p>When they on purpose left the story</p>
<p>to make it easier for people to understand.</p>
<p>But it was still somehow accurate.</p>
<p>And even though all the actors were British actors</p>
<p>speaking English with a British accent,</p>
<p>it was still somehow accurate.</p>
<p>Like they captured the spirit.</p>
<p>So it was historically accurate</p>
<p>and the spirit was captured.</p>
<p>That was one of the most incredible like series</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>It convinced me that the movie was made by non Russians.</p>
<p>It convinced me that if you really care about a story,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to have been brought up in it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need to speak the language.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re truly a scholar of it,</p>
<p>if you talk to a lot of people, if you learn,</p>
<p>if you just pour your heart and soul into it,</p>
<p>you can create something really special.</p>
<p>And so your son says you could do that with the story</p>
<p>with this period of time.</p>
<p>Oh yes, it was a story that needs to be told.</p>
<p>It need to be told in the correct way.</p>
<p>Not like we&rsquo;re trying to bash a certain angle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, if Netflix or HBO are watching this,</p>
<p>you need to tell the story of Roger Rees, in my opinion.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>This is a young picture of you.</p>
<p>Yeah. There you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from National Geographic.</p>
<p>Jorge Archoa, Pablo Escobar, it&rsquo;s you, Roger and Barry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the Muggler, a memoir.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really do hope that they make a movie of this one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a movie called Blow that tells the story</p>
<p>of George Young, Boston George.</p>
<p>Did you know George Young?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to ask it.</p>
<p>The other is what do you think of the movie Blow?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know George Young, but it was a wonderful movie.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It captured it.</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>Yes, it did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it should be.</p>
<p>So he was a little bit before your time?</p>
<p>Exactly the same time.</p>
<p>He was using stewardesses to fly the marijuana</p>
<p>out of Manhattan Beach,</p>
<p>and I was on the fire department in Redondo Beach,</p>
<p>10 miles away, flying it up, sending it back.</p>
<p>Somebody was sending it back.</p>
<p>He might&rsquo;ve been sending it back,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t have near the excitement that I did.</p>
<p>I was shot down twice.</p>
<p>I escaped from five different prisons.</p>
<p>I was tortured almost to death in a Mexican prison.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t have all that fun that I had.</p>
<p>Fun in quotes.</p>
<p>Yeah, so yours is a heck of a fun adventure.</p>
<p>Just to linger on a little bit.</p>
<p>So Johnny Depp plays George,</p>
<p>and Ray Liotta plays his father,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this son father kind of scene at the end.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Like that scene paints a picture of a life</p>
<p>that could have been had if none of this wild drug</p>
<p>smuggling happened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t usually, I mean, I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m almost,</p>
<p>I really never get like teary eyed in a movie,</p>
<p>but that got me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like confronting at the end of your life</p>
<p>what your life could have been with your father,</p>
<p>the way he calls him Georgie.</p>
<p>It, like you fucked up, Georgie.</p>
<p>Yes, I did too.</p>
<p>I really, really did.</p>
<p>Mario waited for me all those years</p>
<p>and the children raised them without me,</p>
<p>visiting me in prisons all over the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, nothing&rsquo;s worth that kind of money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of when you were tortured</p>
<p>nearly to death in a Mexican prison?</p>
<p>I sure can and I&rsquo;m smiling,</p>
<p>but it was nothing to smile about, I can tell you.</p>
<p>I was in a pool and a gentleman came over</p>
<p>and shook hands with me and put handcuffs on me.</p>
<p>And I thought, what in the world?</p>
<p>That was at one of the nice hotels.</p>
<p>They put me in a jail cell and I sat there</p>
<p>and all the drunks and thieves and stuff kept coming in</p>
<p>and they had a bucket and it overrun.</p>
<p>And I said, I remember like 18 people in a room</p>
<p>about 12 foot square.</p>
<p>Oh, it was hot and I thought,</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s gotta come get me, this ain&rsquo;t real.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t done anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it was a pilot come to see me up in Hermosillo</p>
<p>and he stopped and he made a mistake</p>
<p>and went to the International Runway</p>
<p>instead of where he was supposed to go.</p>
<p>And he had my phony name in his pocket, so they got me.</p>
<p>So they said I was a drug smuggler.</p>
<p>So after about three days, they put me back into the back</p>
<p>and it was a torture place.</p>
<p>And they put me in a little cell like,</p>
<p>I guess it wasn&rsquo;t hard even, it wasn&rsquo;t six feet,</p>
<p>must&rsquo;ve been about five feet square and about 12 feet high.</p>
<p>And it was June, the end of June, and it was hot.</p>
<p>I mean hot.</p>
<p>And they left me in there for, I guess a few days.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know, so every once in a while</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d come drag me out and first off,</p>
<p>they put my head under water</p>
<p>and it had seltzer in it or some kind.</p>
<p>And I took one whiff of that and three or four of them</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t hold me down.</p>
<p>So then I learned that just before you have to breathe,</p>
<p>tear loose like that and they&rsquo;ll let you up.</p>
<p>And that was the first treatment.</p>
<p>And then they started beating me.</p>
<p>And they beat me with a blackjack and rubber hose</p>
<p>until I was black and blue and yellow</p>
<p>from the bottom of my feet to my head.</p>
<p>What did they want from you?</p>
<p>They wanted me to sign a confession</p>
<p>that I was a drug smuggler.</p>
<p>And they put the papers under your nose.</p>
<p>This is all over if you&rsquo;ll sign.</p>
<p>Well, I knew if you signed, you got six years.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t gonna sign, I wasn&rsquo;t gonna sign.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t want you to snitch on anybody.</p>
<p>They just wanted you to say.</p>
<p>No, they just wanted me to sign that paper.</p>
<p>And you still didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even bow to it.</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t a beat and ate that bad.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So anyhow, it just got them into the good part.</p>
<p>So then they come and they take me out,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bug naked and they bend me over</p>
<p>and they have things to pull you,</p>
<p>like chains click, click, click, click, click.</p>
<p>And they bent me over and they put butter</p>
<p>on my bum and they commenced to put hot chili pepper</p>
<p>up there and that stuff was bad.</p>
<p>I mean, it was red hot and that was, that was awful.</p>
<p>And still.</p>
<p>That was just awful.</p>
<p>Yeah, but still you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think about it.</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t going to, I guess if I&rsquo;d have known</p>
<p>he was gonna kill me, I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t about, you get hurt bad enough</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll pass out, so I didn&rsquo;t pass out.</p>
<p>So I was all right.</p>
<p>So then the last thing they did was</p>
<p>they brought a dead man in there and he was wrapped.</p>
<p>He was frozen.</p>
<p>He was wrapped in newspaper, little strips</p>
<p>about a half inch wide, just like a mummy.</p>
<p>And he was frozen and they hung him on the wall</p>
<p>with a meat hook and you next son of a bitch, you next.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s sitting there like this</p>
<p>and as he starts to throw out, which is pretty quick,</p>
<p>it looks like he&rsquo;s crying and it looks like he&rsquo;s peeing</p>
<p>and the paper starts unraveling on him</p>
<p>and the formaldehyde puddles on the floor.</p>
<p>Ooh, what a smell that rotten insides</p>
<p>and the formaldehyde and there was a little space.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even a half inch high under the door.</p>
<p>And I lay on that filthy floor with my cheek</p>
<p>and put my lips right up under that door</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re sucking that fresh air.</p>
<p>And I went to sleep after some time.</p>
<p>And I know where Walt Disney gets his ideas.</p>
<p>I saw white pink pigs with wings on them,</p>
<p>all kinds of stuff flying around.</p>
<p>So when I woke up, I didn&rsquo;t know which was real</p>
<p>and which was the nightmare.</p>
<p>It took me a minute to figure out where I was</p>
<p>and what was going on.</p>
<p>How did you stay mentally strong through that time?</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I did.</p>
<p>I was, yeah, I was mentally strong.</p>
<p>So I was just like I am now.</p>
<p>Stubborn.</p>
<p>I mean, you could be that man that could have killed you.</p>
<p>Yes, I could have.</p>
<p>So what gave you hope?</p>
<p>Did you have hope?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or you were just a stubborn son of a bitch?</p>
<p>I think some of both of it.</p>
<p>And I think they aren&rsquo;t going to keep you here forever.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re going to get out into the prison</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re going to let you go or something.</p>
<p>If you sign that paper, you ain&rsquo;t going nowhere.</p>
<p>And I want to go home.</p>
<p>I got shot down a few weeks before that.</p>
<p>I got shot from out of the sky.</p>
<p>80 bullet holes through the plane,</p>
<p>killed a fellow on the ground,</p>
<p>shot the leg nearly off the man in the plane.</p>
<p>Where was this?</p>
<p>In that little place of Peachy Lingy.</p>
<p>You want to tell you that story?</p>
<p>And they were shooting you from the ground.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>A little 900 foot strip there at Peachy Lingy,</p>
<p>a poor, poor village with starving donkeys.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d give them $17,000 for the load.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d go over on the highway and load.</p>
<p>Well, on day 13, I did a load every day for 13 days.</p>
<p>They had a bunch of marijuana, pretty good piled up.</p>
<p>And I was going low today.</p>
<p>And on day 13, I had that little warning sign</p>
<p>going off in my stomach.</p>
<p>Uh oh, uh oh, don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But I asked this Joaquin,</p>
<p>oh, we had the federal, all this paid off,</p>
<p>nowhere we were.</p>
<p>So I spent the night in a hammock</p>
<p>and walked down to the airplane,</p>
<p>just as it get in daylight.</p>
<p>And 10 or 12 men walked with me and Pedro got in.</p>
<p>I brushed my teeth in the little stream.</p>
<p>It was about foot deep,</p>
<p>a little river coming through there.</p>
<p>And got in the airplane and I fired her up.</p>
<p>Bam, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And bam, I thought a tire blew out.</p>
<p>I looked over and it still ain&rsquo;t dawned on me.</p>
<p>And Pedro was yelling, police here, police here Roger,</p>
<p>police here.</p>
<p>Well, it dawned on me.</p>
<p>And I shoved it, the throttle to the firewall.</p>
<p>And I only had about.</p>
<p>So that was a bullet.</p>
<p>Yeah, somebody, there&rsquo;s officer sides, they&rsquo;d shot.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d shot just a warning, like get out, stop.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna rob you, whatever it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>They just taking the plane and me</p>
<p>and put me in prison, old thing.</p>
<p>So, but I, even though I had papers.</p>
<p>So I just shoved it to the firewall</p>
<p>and there wasn&rsquo;t enough room to take off on that strip.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s half of it was behind me</p>
<p>or some of it was behind me.</p>
<p>And so just at the end, I&rsquo;m just like,</p>
<p>I think that thing stalls at about 50 miles an hour.</p>
<p>Just turning 50 and I just pulled it right up</p>
<p>and put the flaps on.</p>
<p>And as I pulled off the ground,</p>
<p>they opened up on both sides of me with machine guns</p>
<p>and they riddled that airplane.</p>
<p>I mean, the windshield came out.</p>
<p>I got hit three times.</p>
<p>You, like your body?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know I was hit.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just the gasoline just pouring in.</p>
<p>The world turned yellow.</p>
<p>I must&rsquo;ve went into shock.</p>
<p>So it just stopped in slow motion.</p>
<p>And one bullet hit the strut right by my head.</p>
<p>And it just, parts of that bullet just went all over me.</p>
<p>I just looked like I&rsquo;d been peppered with lead.</p>
<p>And the gasoline was just pouring in.</p>
<p>I mean, just pouring in where they&rsquo;d shot the wing up above</p>
<p>and the windshield&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just like a hail storm.</p>
<p>So I was&hellip;</p>
<p>Airplanes did stall or no?</p>
<p>I was in a stall anyway, and I didn&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
<p>And I guess you wouldn&rsquo;t unless you trained for it.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re in a stall,</p>
<p>the elevator is kind of flappy.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time.</p>
<p>I thought they had shot the elevator cable in too.</p>
<p>So I thought, oh God.</p>
<p>So I just reached over and switched it off,</p>
<p>switched the mixture, pulled everything.</p>
<p>And in the river, there was rocks</p>
<p>about as big as this table.</p>
<p>And they were like the turtle back</p>
<p>all the way up until there was a waterfall.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a pretty place.</p>
<p>And I crashed straight onto it.</p>
<p>I thought if I get those rocks.</p>
<p>And when I did the first time I hit, the wings came off</p>
<p>and then it bounced.</p>
<p>And the next time the nose came up</p>
<p>and came under the plane and I&rsquo;m sitting there,</p>
<p>I must&rsquo;ve been knocked unconscious</p>
<p>called Pedro shaking me.</p>
<p>Come on, Roger, come on, Roger.</p>
<p>So I stepped out into the water</p>
<p>and here comes these four Federalists</p>
<p>still shooting at us.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m bulleted to hit the airplane.</p>
<p>And I kept a nine millimeter Browning high power</p>
<p>taped to the top of the radio in case I ever needed it.</p>
<p>So, cause you didn&rsquo;t want it in the airplane.</p>
<p>So I just, it was just handy just laying there.</p>
<p>So I took and popped a few caps out of them</p>
<p>and they ran into the rocks.</p>
<p>So we took off running.</p>
<p>And then I looked and Pedro&rsquo;s foot nearly shot off.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d shot him on one side of the ankle</p>
<p>and it just blown out the other side.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t even hardly bleeding, the shock of it.</p>
<p>So I took my T shirt off and gripped it</p>
<p>and tied it best I could.</p>
<p>But you had still bullets in you.</p>
<p>So like you could still run.</p>
<p>I shot the top of my toenail off.</p>
<p>I shot it across my head and my kneecap.</p>
<p>So I was just nicked.</p>
<p>Okay, got it.</p>
<p>It was very painful later on,</p>
<p>but right that time I didn&rsquo;t, it was just hot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bullet still in my foot from it,</p>
<p>a piece of a bullet.</p>
<p>Good size slug.</p>
<p>So we went on up the mountain through the cactus</p>
<p>and just running.</p>
<p>Just going, I want to go down.</p>
<p>No, no, the federal is going the easy way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go, this young fella.</p>
<p>And we came to an old donkey.</p>
<p>She must&rsquo;ve been 30 years old, long and way back,</p>
<p>long hair on her, Charlotte, Charlotte.</p>
<p>And he petted the donkey and we jumped on.</p>
<p>And we rode for seven.</p>
<p>Like an actual donkey?</p>
<p>A donkey.</p>
<p>There were donkeys all over the place.</p>
<p>Anyhow, he knew that one from the village.</p>
<p>And so we rode seven miles, two of us,</p>
<p>on a donkey with no bridle, no saddle, nothing.</p>
<p>And we came to a little man plowing a little horse</p>
<p>and a little ox.</p>
<p>Both of them were spotted and the ox was,</p>
<p>the yoke was across their back this way.</p>
<p>And he was plowing with a little plow among stumps.</p>
<p>It was like one of these people clearing</p>
<p>a little piece of land.</p>
<p>And he had a little house there.</p>
<p>And so we went into his house</p>
<p>and his wife and his daughter,</p>
<p>they put like a cloth over my wounds and on Pedro&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It was terrible.</p>
<p>And they poured diesel oil on it to keep the flies off.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m covered in diesel.</p>
<p>So the man left and he was gone all day.</p>
<p>And then about dark, he showed up,</p>
<p>maybe about 15 or 20 horses and mules showed up</p>
<p>in the yard, walking fast.</p>
<p>And a doctor got out, he said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Dr. Benjamin Soso with Red Cross.</p>
<p>And he worked on my foot and he worked on Pedro.</p>
<p>He gave us a shot of morphine and tetanus shots.</p>
<p>And he said, you got to get to hospital.</p>
<p>He said, Pedro will die if he don&rsquo;t get to hospital.</p>
<p>He said, they are looking for American pilots</p>
<p>been shot down and they think he&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>There was a lot of blood in that airplane.</p>
<p>And so they rode, I don&rsquo;t know how far we rode,</p>
<p>but we rode miles and we&rsquo;d come to a road</p>
<p>and there was a big truck</p>
<p>and it was loaded with corn in the ear.</p>
<p>And they dug holes in that corn, put us in it</p>
<p>and covered us up.</p>
<p>And the road was rough.</p>
<p>And every time we&rsquo;d hit a dirt road,</p>
<p>that corn would cover me up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d scratch my face out again.</p>
<p>And when they came to the highway,</p>
<p>we went into a house and they got me some clothes</p>
<p>and mine was messed up and a white basin.</p>
<p>And they must&rsquo;ve brought 20 jugs of water different times.</p>
<p>I kept washing and washing my foot</p>
<p>till all the blood and the crud got off of me</p>
<p>and put on those clothes.</p>
<p>And somebody went to, they said,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t go North, the road&rsquo;s blocked.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking for the pilot.</p>
<p>So you got to go South.</p>
<p>So they found a taxi in Mazatlan.</p>
<p>And it was a rather new taxi.</p>
<p>And the fellow would take me to Guadalajara,</p>
<p>which was, I don&rsquo;t know, seven, eight hours South.</p>
<p>So we got in that taxi and they propped me up</p>
<p>with sheets and blankets and pillows in the back seat</p>
<p>and gave me these great big white pain pills.</p>
<p>And I was quite content.</p>
<p>Then I was shot down in Columbia also.</p>
<p>What, can you tell that story?</p>
<p>I sure can.</p>
<p>All right, I went down for a load of marijuana</p>
<p>and we got to the place and we got there too early.</p>
<p>And the guerrillas screamed,</p>
<p>you got to get out of here, you got to get out of here.</p>
<p>And so we went back to the place where we stayed from</p>
<p>and refueled.</p>
<p>I had a beautiful DC3, carried three tons.</p>
<p>And so while I was waiting,</p>
<p>I ate something for lunch and I went around behind the house.</p>
<p>We refueled a plane up and I had to wait till late afternoon.</p>
<p>They wanted me to come just at dark</p>
<p>so the military planes couldn&rsquo;t see me on their strip.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m leaning in the hammock asleep</p>
<p>and I hear this terrible roar.</p>
<p>And I looked right up through the trees</p>
<p>and at the end of two military jets going straight up.</p>
<p>They do a dive over and they came back down the strip</p>
<p>in front of that airplane and they just tear it up</p>
<p>with 50 caliber machine guns.</p>
<p>They just showing out.</p>
<p>So I run for the airplane, I just give that guy $80,000</p>
<p>and he ran for the truck</p>
<p>and all the rest of them ran for the truck.</p>
<p>I should have ran with my money,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t, I ran for the airplane.</p>
<p>And the copilot got in and his name was Al.</p>
<p>He got in with me and two fellows got in the back.</p>
<p>We had drums of fuel in there to refuel</p>
<p>when we got down to the guerrillas.</p>
<p>So we took off and I couldn&rsquo;t get the gear up</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d taken off in such a hurry.</p>
<p>These pins in the struts of a DC3 and with big flags on them</p>
<p>and you have to take them up</p>
<p>so that the plane won&rsquo;t come up.</p>
<p>So these jets swarmed on me and they tried to get me to go.</p>
<p>They kept telling me which way to go</p>
<p>and the pilot would be just as close</p>
<p>as just right over there.</p>
<p>I could see him.</p>
<p>I just held up the old iffy piece.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think they would shoot.</p>
<p>I really didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Nobody had shot before.</p>
<p>So I kept flying out and I kept getting slower and slower</p>
<p>and they kept slowing down, down, down</p>
<p>and the black smoke rolling.</p>
<p>And then they started shooting up under me.</p>
<p>Boom, boom, boom, boom with them 20 millimeter cannons.</p>
<p>And then the tracers just going up.</p>
<p>They looked like they&rsquo;re curving up from me.</p>
<p>I woo and I pushed the nose over</p>
<p>so they couldn&rsquo;t get under me.</p>
<p>And later on I heard they thought I tried to ram them.</p>
<p>So one of them went for fuel and I kept on going</p>
<p>and the one just tore the left wing tip up</p>
<p>with the 50 caliber.</p>
<p>And then he come back again and shot the tail up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s warning me.</p>
<p>And I tell the feller in there, I says,</p>
<p>you know, if you bring me enough water,</p>
<p>I believe I can fly this thing.</p>
<p>My mouth got quite dry.</p>
<p>So I went on and I landed on a big pasture.</p>
<p>And it was huge pasture and it was rougher than it looked.</p>
<p>And the wings just flapped and I come to a stop</p>
<p>and jumped out and pull those tabs out,</p>
<p>threw them on the ground so I could get my gear up.</p>
<p>And I understand that during the 1980 World Series</p>
<p>baseball game that it says American DC three</p>
<p>has just been shot down by American jets,</p>
<p>by Colombian jets.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the first plane shot down</p>
<p>on Reagan&rsquo;s new war on drugs.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s up, he&rsquo;s up and away, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>We keep you posted.</p>
<p>So I took off again and I went into a thunderstorm</p>
<p>and they came close to the mountains.</p>
<p>So I spiraled up and every time I&rsquo;d come out,</p>
<p>that jet was there, boom, boom, boom.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d go back into that storm and boom, boom, boom</p>
<p>in there and at 20,000 feet, I started icing up.</p>
<p>So I went out one last time and he was right there waiting.</p>
<p>He had me on radar.</p>
<p>So I went back in and I kicked it over</p>
<p>and put it into a spin and went straight down to 2000 feet</p>
<p>and come out under it.</p>
<p>And I was flying along the Guaviera River</p>
<p>and it was 20 feet above the water.</p>
<p>It looked like a pasture, it was just grass.</p>
<p>And I made several runs to tear the grass down</p>
<p>and it looked like, and it felt hard.</p>
<p>That old DC three weighs 30,000 pounds</p>
<p>and I put it down on the fifth run.</p>
<p>I said, all right, now we&rsquo;re gonna land now.</p>
<p>And as I was.</p>
<p>Did you do like close several times?</p>
<p>I put the wheels down.</p>
<p>Oh, you put the wheels down without landing.</p>
<p>And just, so I&rsquo;m making a run for it, you know.</p>
<p>So you, okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re being tracked by a jet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to, well, before that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like retelling this story, how insane it is.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s trying to shoot you down</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a thunderstorm that you&rsquo;re escaping into.</p>
<p>And then you do a spin down to what, 2000 feet?</p>
<p>Whatever you said, like somehow escaping all of this.</p>
<p>And then you try to land on a pasture</p>
<p>on a giant heavy plane that carries three tons</p>
<p>by touching down five or six times</p>
<p>to make a landing strip for yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, the grass is three or four feet high.</p>
<p>So it looked really good after about, after a few times.</p>
<p>So then just before it stopped,</p>
<p>I said, Al, take your feet off the brakes.</p>
<p>He said, I don&rsquo;t have my feet on the brakes.</p>
<p>Well, I knew I had broken through the crust</p>
<p>and I put full power on, but it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That old big plane just come on down</p>
<p>and it just did a head, as it came to a stop,</p>
<p>it did a headstand, 90 degrees to the ground.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>And the engines held it up</p>
<p>and the nose and all just crushed in right on it.</p>
<p>We fell between the two seats to keep from getting killed.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And when it come to a stop,</p>
<p>all that fuel was pouring out on those hot engines</p>
<p>and there was an escape hatch at the top.</p>
<p>I just stepped out, took my suitcase with me.</p>
<p>Was there fire?</p>
<p>No fire, left the plane there</p>
<p>and the two guys that was in the back,</p>
<p>one of them broke his thumb and it was with the barrels</p>
<p>and they had to put a hose,</p>
<p>tie gas hose together to shimmy down to get out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an incredible story.</p>
<p>Well, let me just tell you,</p>
<p>they had a little bit more to it.</p>
<p>I learned to fly with the idea</p>
<p>of being a missionary aviation fellowship pilot,</p>
<p>fly the missionaries in and out of the jungle.</p>
<p>Well, I went 11 days through that jungle.</p>
<p>The rest of them went on down the road and went to prison.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;ll crawl on my belly six months in here a year,</p>
<p>eating snakes before I&rsquo;m going down the road.</p>
<p>So I went in there and I was 11 days in the jungle</p>
<p>and I finally came to this place and it had airplanes.</p>
<p>I kept asking the Indian, dandistai avions.</p>
<p>I want to steal an airplane and get out of there.</p>
<p>And when I came to the place,</p>
<p>I asked, what is this place?</p>
<p>Lovely place.</p>
<p>It looked like Honolulu in World War II.</p>
<p>There was a runway there.</p>
<p>Said, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is Loma Linda headquarters</p>
<p>for Missionary Aviation Fellowship for the Amazon.</p>
<p>And they flew me out.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>You escaped from prison five times?</p>
<p>So what stands out to you as the most difficult</p>
<p>or miraculous escape in the bunch?</p>
<p>The most black miraculous was</p>
<p>when I was in the courtroom in Spain.</p>
<p>I think I was on the third floor of Real High</p>
<p>and I ran across the courtroom, handcuffed,</p>
<p>kicked the window out.</p>
<p>And I looked down and it was above the palm trees.</p>
<p>I thought there might be a power line</p>
<p>or something I could grab on as I went down.</p>
<p>There was nothing.</p>
<p>And there was a car parked, a station wagon on the side.</p>
<p>You just jumped out?</p>
<p>I jumped out from 31 feet and on top of that car.</p>
<p>And it exploded in the street.</p>
<p>The windshield went over three or four cars.</p>
<p>It looked like snow going up.</p>
<p>And I looked like Donald Duck with the thing coming off</p>
<p>and handcuffs and I got out.</p>
<p>And you just kept running?</p>
<p>Yeah, I kept running.</p>
<p>They ran me down and hit me in the back.</p>
<p>I still got a dead spot in my back</p>
<p>where the policeman hit me with a shotgun.</p>
<p>And they brought me back.</p>
<p>Murray was there and they were saying,</p>
<p>your husband is crazy.</p>
<p>That was spectacular.</p>
<p>But I escaped from Lubeck, maximum security prison.</p>
<p>And I cut out of there and got out.</p>
<p>That was a miraculous escape.</p>
<p>And that was where?</p>
<p>In Lubeck, Germany.</p>
<p>What was that escape like?</p>
<p>I was there and they was going to extradite me</p>
<p>back to the United States</p>
<p>where I still had all these charges</p>
<p>and 25 years special parole.</p>
<p>And I was cleaning the lawyer&rsquo;s visiting room</p>
<p>and on it was bars that looked like piano notes</p>
<p>or this way to make it pretty.</p>
<p>But they was a little bit,</p>
<p>so I got a rope from a guy where they made boats in there.</p>
<p>And I had 20 minutes.</p>
<p>So I went in there and I wrapped it around</p>
<p>and I put a broom handle in it</p>
<p>that was cut off and wrapped it around</p>
<p>until they pull the bars together on that side.</p>
<p>And then I pulled them together on the other side.</p>
<p>But that only put me in inside the prison yard</p>
<p>where the soccer equipment was kept.</p>
<p>But they were putting new windows on one side of the prison</p>
<p>and they had it scaffolded up to the fourth floor.</p>
<p>So there was a little recess there</p>
<p>and there was guard towers every 100 feet or so.</p>
<p>I mean, they would shoot and kill you.</p>
<p>So I got behind that and climbed up holding to the bricks</p>
<p>on one hand and the scaffolding on the other</p>
<p>and went to the roof.</p>
<p>I lost my shirt and most of my clothes</p>
<p>going through the window.</p>
<p>I got all the skin off of me.</p>
<p>I thought I was gonna die.</p>
<p>And I was trying to go sideways like this.</p>
<p>And finally I got a grip and the bars let me through</p>
<p>and took all the skin off of me.</p>
<p>So I got up on that roof and I have asthma</p>
<p>and I just lay there trying to catch my breath.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t bring my inhaler.</p>
<p>With blood everywhere.</p>
<p>Oh, I was bloody, yes.</p>
<p>And so I got down to the end</p>
<p>and on the end, the reason I did it,</p>
<p>they would put it, they was putting a new wall again</p>
<p>around the prison to make it larger.</p>
<p>And they had taken all the wire off above the Sally port</p>
<p>where they could join the two walls together.</p>
<p>And I saw that when I came up and there was a guard,</p>
<p>a half of like a dome sticking out of that brick building</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a guard there with a gun and he&rsquo;d kill you.</p>
<p>And I mean, he was made,</p>
<p>he was surely trained to kill you.</p>
<p>And we had some bad people in that place.</p>
<p>So I lay up one floor above it</p>
<p>and I saw a guard and his wife come with a double umbrella.</p>
<p>It was just pouring down the rain.</p>
<p>Here I am without a shirt on, bloody.</p>
<p>And she had a little boy with him under that double umbrella</p>
<p>and I knew him and when he come</p>
<p>and she started back from the Sally port,</p>
<p>I hit the top of that guard tower, bam, with both feet.</p>
<p>And I jumped, I guess it&rsquo;s three more floors.</p>
<p>I jumped, there was a pile of sand,</p>
<p>like a cone where they were digging it there.</p>
<p>And I hit that and my feet buried up to the knees,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t fall.</p>
<p>And I ran straight towards her so he couldn&rsquo;t shoot me.</p>
<p>And then I went around some bushes and went downhill.</p>
<p>And then I heard bam, bam, bam, bam, bam behind me.</p>
<p>And I looked and that fool woman was in a big old car</p>
<p>and she was knocking down the parking meters behind me.</p>
<p>She was trying to run over me.</p>
<p>And I ran behind the car</p>
<p>and she tore the fender off of her car,</p>
<p>trying to yell and yow, yow, yow,</p>
<p>and a terrible evil looking face at me, screaming at me.</p>
<p>And the sirens going off in the prison.</p>
<p>And there was a fence there, a wall.</p>
<p>And I jumped up on it to jump over</p>
<p>and it had glass embedded.</p>
<p>And I cut my hands and my arms all up getting over that.</p>
<p>And I hit the ground on the other side</p>
<p>and it was like, it was that mucked muck</p>
<p>where some farmer had dug it.</p>
<p>I dug in there and Maury had slipped me $200 into prison.</p>
<p>And I had that in my shoe and I lost my shoes in that muck.</p>
<p>But anyway, I got out of there and got to Holland.</p>
<p>Really a heck of a story how I did that.</p>
<p>What was prison like, whether it&rsquo;s Germany</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s Australia?</p>
<p>What were some of the darker moments in prison?</p>
<p>The United States prisons are awful,</p>
<p>awful evil places now.</p>
<p>And just really, there&rsquo;s nothing nice about them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the guards.</p>
<p>In LA?</p>
<p>And everyone I went to.</p>
<p>It seemed like the further east I went to Oklahoma</p>
<p>and it was nicer, but all of them on the West Coast,</p>
<p>they was hatred there.</p>
<p>And they got really stupid people hired, just incredibly.</p>
<p>Oh, hatred by the guards.</p>
<p>And the inmates, like I speak Spanish</p>
<p>and I walked in to the Spanish TV room</p>
<p>and it was saying, you know, no, you can&rsquo;t come in here.</p>
<p>And I walked across to the black,</p>
<p>hey, get out of here, white boy.</p>
<p>It was just like, what?</p>
<p>Man, I like all you people, you know?</p>
<p>And so I walked down to the white people and said,</p>
<p>show us your paperwork.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t come in here until you show your paperwork.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t let snitches and homosexuals</p>
<p>and all this sort of stuff in here.</p>
<p>So they have, so it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>man, I don&rsquo;t wanna be in here.</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds absurd,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying like the basic humanity is gone.</p>
<p>Completely, completely in the guards.</p>
<p>It was just like, come here, Reeves.</p>
<p>And I woke up to him, get the fuck out of my face.</p>
<p>Sticks his chin out, like for me to break his jaw.</p>
<p>Like, what in the world, man?</p>
<p>I love people and it&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>Yeah, you got this joy to you.</p>
<p>You have a joyful nature.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t seem like that broke you.</p>
<p>Not a bit.</p>
<p>How did you persevere?</p>
<p>Did you know, I didn&rsquo;t even think I persevered,</p>
<p>but I try to enjoy my life wherever I am every day.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I ran every day.</p>
<p>And like I told you, why do you run so, Roger?</p>
<p>I said, to help me suffer these fools.</p>
<p>And I played a game of chess every day,</p>
<p>almost of my life in there.</p>
<p>And I read two books a week.</p>
<p>And I talked with people, storytellers,</p>
<p>guys would come in and, tell us another story, Roger.</p>
<p>Give us a poem.</p>
<p>Tell us one you never told us before.</p>
<p>And so it was just nice.</p>
<p>A lot of them have original boys.</p>
<p>They picked their country music and it was all right.</p>
<p>Red, Morgan Freeman&rsquo;s character</p>
<p>in The Shawshank Redemption says the following.</p>
<p>These walls are funny.</p>
<p>First you hate them, then you get used to them.</p>
<p>Enough time passes you get, so you depend on them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s institutionalized.</p>
<p>Is there truth to that?</p>
<p>100%, I didn&rsquo;t even see the walls,</p>
<p>except whenever I was planning on escaping.</p>
<p>In Shawshank Redemption, he spent so many years in prison</p>
<p>that he almost didn&rsquo;t know what to do with himself</p>
<p>once he left, once he was a free man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, you get so used to the system,</p>
<p>the rituals, having to follow orders,</p>
<p>even being treated poorly,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things that you become dependent on.</p>
<p>Well, down in Australia, I spent the first,</p>
<p>a little over a year in the shoe.</p>
<p>It was like, did you see the movie,</p>
<p>The Silence of the Lambs, thank you, Marty.</p>
<p>And he said, I had five or six guards</p>
<p>looking at me with a one way mirror.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s whenever I thought I might never get out,</p>
<p>I got a life sentence.</p>
<p>I had all this time waiting here in Germany.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, they had a computer in there,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t have a program on it.</p>
<p>And I wrote, so I just started writing</p>
<p>these little stories of stuff I did in my life.</p>
<p>And I wrote one line and I wrote over a million words</p>
<p>with them looking at me.</p>
<p>So it was after a year, they let me out.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before they put me</p>
<p>in a place called Self Care.</p>
<p>And particularly, I was in what they call the lifers pod.</p>
<p>There was 268 men in Self Care there.</p>
<p>And it was unbelievably good that we were left alone.</p>
<p>Basically, they was there or the guards</p>
<p>were certainly there, but they had their shack</p>
<p>and we had apartments, four apartments to the building.</p>
<p>And six men to the unit with your own door</p>
<p>and a key to it and a kitchen, dining room,</p>
<p>freezer, refrigerator.</p>
<p>And they gave you, allowed you $360 a week to buy groceries.</p>
<p>And I cooked for about 16 years and learned to cook good.</p>
<p>And the people and other people have their specialties.</p>
<p>And so that was quite, it wasn&rsquo;t so like being in prison.</p>
<p>It was somewhat living with me and it was difficult, man.</p>
<p>I had some good fights and carry on.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get along with everybody.</p>
<p>But then whenever I came back to the United States,</p>
<p>I was laughing and talking.</p>
<p>And when I got off the plane in LA,</p>
<p>I had three marshals with me from Australia.</p>
<p>I was slammed upside the wall.</p>
<p>I mean, hard, put ankle mics on and handcuffed so tight</p>
<p>till they cut my lane off.</p>
<p>Face forward, face forward, lands apart.</p>
<p>Good gracious.</p>
<p>And walked me 50 steps and turned me over to the marshals</p>
<p>and they took part of that off.</p>
<p>That was a border patrol that was there</p>
<p>over my marijuana charge from 1977.</p>
<p>I did 11 years for parole violation.</p>
<p>Now they want me for more violation.</p>
<p>And they put me in, down in Los Angeles,</p>
<p>they put me in, the marshals put me in there</p>
<p>and they put me in isolation.</p>
<p>I thought, what in the world they got me for isolation for?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing anything.</p>
<p>How long did you spend in isolation?</p>
<p>More than six months.</p>
<p>So I, after three or four days</p>
<p>as the little Judas window slide open</p>
<p>and a man, a nice looking man in a suit come there,</p>
<p>hello Reeves, I wanna, just wanna see what you look like.</p>
<p>I saw your National Geographic documentary</p>
<p>and it does me pleasure to keep you in isolation.</p>
<p>And he slammed the thing and I couldn&rsquo;t get out of there.</p>
<p>And by law, the US Parole Commission</p>
<p>is supposed to give you a hearing within 90 days.</p>
<p>So Murray paid a lawyer $7,500</p>
<p>and he never picked up the phone.</p>
<p>Somebody got to him.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that somebody you think?</p>
<p>Christopher Cannon was his name</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know who got to him,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t do anything to get me out of there.</p>
<p>I got one 15 minute phone call a month</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>So then after six months, they put me on Conair,</p>
<p>double shackled and black box on my hands.</p>
<p>And I went to Oklahoma</p>
<p>and they let me out on the floor.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
<p>Then I could call after a couple of days</p>
<p>and they said, there was a man here from Washington</p>
<p>give you a parole hearing and you only got here at 3.30.</p>
<p>So he left, he said he&rsquo;d be back next year.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in now over six months.</p>
<p>So then there was a lovely little lady,</p>
<p>she was a case manager or something.</p>
<p>She said, you can ask for parole on the record.</p>
<p>And I said, please do.</p>
<p>So I sent them an email</p>
<p>and the next day I got my parole.</p>
<p>90 days later, they sent me to Terminal Island</p>
<p>and put me in the place there with the invalid,</p>
<p>I guess since I&rsquo;m as old as I am, 78 years old.</p>
<p>So they put me in the people in there dying</p>
<p>and wheelchairs and legs off and arms off and cancer.</p>
<p>So I was in there and I pushed the fellows around</p>
<p>and I went, come out of the chow hall there</p>
<p>and I went to go to the right to get me a haircut</p>
<p>and the two Mexican guys there, Lieutenant and another one,</p>
<p>walked between us and he went like the boop, boop, boop.</p>
<p>I could outrun you.</p>
<p>And they slammed me, put me on the ground,</p>
<p>handcuffed me and put me in the shoe for a week.</p>
<p>I got out and man, they put me back in the place.</p>
<p>They treated me rough.</p>
<p>So I got in a little more trouble</p>
<p>and they put me back in the shoe and I wouldn&rsquo;t come out.</p>
<p>They had that, the virus was out killing people.</p>
<p>So they killed eight people in that unit I was in.</p>
<p>So I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t even come out to take a shower.</p>
<p>I had a little straw that I put in the sink</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d take a sock that I had and scrub myself with it</p>
<p>with some slope and a glass of water over my head</p>
<p>and then clean the floor up and put it in the toilet.</p>
<p>So that was your time during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>I got out last April, right in the middle of it</p>
<p>and they were dying bad in there.</p>
<p>So I was treated worse for that last year in America</p>
<p>than I was for the whole 20 years in Australia,</p>
<p>the 18 years in Australia.</p>
<p>And then you were a free man at the end of that year.</p>
<p>They put me out and sent me home</p>
<p>and the parole officers couldn&rsquo;t even come.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>They were just doing everything by video.</p>
<p>They said, better not have a drink.</p>
<p>The only constituent thing was</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t even have a drink of wine.</p>
<p>So after a year, I had to take psychiatric treatment.</p>
<p>Every week I had to go talk to the psychiatrist,</p>
<p>psychologist and me and her got along great.</p>
<p>She was a good Christian woman.</p>
<p>We just chatted and talked.</p>
<p>And I think they said,</p>
<p>so I had to pee in the bottle every week.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;ve been in 33 years.</p>
<p>How many piss deaths do you think I&rsquo;ve had?</p>
<p>Never been dirty.</p>
<p>Only thing if you all wanna clean when you come get me.</p>
<p>Before I talk to you about love,</p>
<p>let me ask you a difficult question.</p>
<p>You write in your book,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t consider myself much of a criminal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t lie, cheat or steal.</p>
<p>And I always take up for the underdog.</p>
<p>Violence makes me sick.</p>
<p>Yet I know I&rsquo;m an outlaw</p>
<p>and those that break the law must be punished.</p>
<p>I think many people listening to this</p>
<p>or some people listening to this</p>
<p>will see you as a criminal, as a bad man</p>
<p>who increased the amount of suffering in this world.</p>
<p>What do you have to say to them?</p>
<p>I would like to tell them</p>
<p>that they have been indoctrinated by the spin</p>
<p>of news and politicians</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know the truth of the situation.</p>
<p>You lay the truth out there in an envelope,</p>
<p>let me open it besides something else that is false</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s staggering.</p>
<p>The truth is that I was a tobacco farmer</p>
<p>and tobacco kills 500,000 people a year in America</p>
<p>and 6 million have debilitating diseases because of it.</p>
<p>Drugs, all drugs combined kill</p>
<p>between 10 and 15,000 people a year by overdose</p>
<p>and 60% of those are pharmaceutical.</p>
<p>Now, then when I was a tobacco farmer,</p>
<p>come sit on the front pew, Mr. Reeves,</p>
<p>come on up here, you&rsquo;re a gentleman.</p>
<p>You just joined the Masonic Lodge and you joined our church</p>
<p>and you just come on and sit down with the good people.</p>
<p>You grow two marijuana plants,</p>
<p>get out of here you scumbag</p>
<p>and the marijuana doesn&rsquo;t hurt anybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s the truth of it.</p>
<p>And so in your career,</p>
<p>you walked amidst violence</p>
<p>but you never participated in the violence.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even see it.</p>
<p>Just didn&rsquo;t happen around me, in prison it did.</p>
<p>I sewed people up, they called me doc.</p>
<p>I had dental floss and one time I had to get a blade</p>
<p>and try to help keep from my patient from getting again.</p>
<p>But I was just like, if I shot at those people,</p>
<p>I shot at them to keep them from killing me.</p>
<p>I certainly didn&rsquo;t mean to kill them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just, some people are evil</p>
<p>and they will kill you and hurt you and lie to you.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t do any of that.</p>
<p>It just makes you sick.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>When I was in the shoe, three guys tried to kill a guy</p>
<p>and they stabbed him so many times,</p>
<p>but they stabbed Blake and the blood getting out of the room.</p>
<p>I said, you&rsquo;re gonna kill him.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna kill him and save his life.</p>
<p>Drug him up there where the guards could see him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not of that nature of those people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just evil.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re people born evil, I believe.</p>
<p>It is heartbreaking to hear that the basic humanity</p>
<p>is gone in prison in the United States.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s heartbreaking because that basic humanity</p>
<p>is actually the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that saves us as opposed to,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s absent, it&rsquo;s the thing that destroys us.</p>
<p>The prisons are filled, absolutely filled with people</p>
<p>that have some mental problems.</p>
<p>Now, you see Tent City all the way up and down here.</p>
<p>I guarantee you, every one of those people</p>
<p>have mental problems, some degree.</p>
<p>However little it is, but they are a little bit off.</p>
<p>Now, then you get a DEA agent</p>
<p>that wants to make a name for himself.</p>
<p>He goes down there and gets two of them,</p>
<p>one of them to sell a little two grams of methamphetamine</p>
<p>to the other one, and he gets a conviction.</p>
<p>And a young prosecutor, he gets a conviction.</p>
<p>He wants to make a judge.</p>
<p>And we got the judge in, where was it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give a million, what was his name?</p>
<p>Gilbert.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give him in a million years</p>
<p>before I get off the judge.</p>
<p>You get fools like that in charge.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna fill prisons up with pitiful humanity.</p>
<p>And those are the ones.</p>
<p>And then the other is people over drugs.</p>
<p>And drugs should be a health issue.</p>
<p>You cannot police it enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, they know the only thing</p>
<p>that overdoses is opioids, the heroin.</p>
<p>And if they can give it to him,</p>
<p>it costs about a dollar a day</p>
<p>to give the worst addict his fix.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll give it methadone,</p>
<p>which is from a pharmaceutical company,</p>
<p>which is just as bad.</p>
<p>Why in the world, we tried it all over the world</p>
<p>in Portugal and England.</p>
<p>And when they give the girls cleanup,</p>
<p>no more stolen cars, why?</p>
<p>Who wants to keep this farce going?</p>
<p>They just perpetuating it.</p>
<p>Like, oh, every little police place</p>
<p>is getting all these suits and armor and machine guns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, oh, it&rsquo;s such a spin, it&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>Do you think all drugs should be legalized?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that,</p>
<p>but they certainly should be controlled.</p>
<p>If a person is an addict,</p>
<p>he should be able to go down and get his fix</p>
<p>with somebody there to help him</p>
<p>with a clean needle and a glass of orange juice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much cheaper than prison.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much cheaper than him stealing cars</p>
<p>or a prostitute having to go to work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lived one heck of a life.</p>
<p>Looking back, there&rsquo;s a lot of young people</p>
<p>that listen to this, high school, college students.</p>
<p>What advice would you give them?</p>
<p>How to live, how to have a successful career,</p>
<p>how to have a good life, how to be a good man or woman?</p>
<p>To be a good man or woman,</p>
<p>if I had it to do over with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you what I&rsquo;d have done.</p>
<p>I would have paid attention and studied my lesson</p>
<p>and did the best I could.</p>
<p>In school. In school, yes.</p>
<p>And went as far as I could have.</p>
<p>I would have liked to been a doctor.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t have the stickability</p>
<p>or anybody to tell me, hey, go over there and do that.</p>
<p>And if you can do that at a very young age,</p>
<p>start in a trade, learn to do something.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is.</p>
<p>If you learn to do something good,</p>
<p>there is a great demand for you.</p>
<p>And I would say that in prison,</p>
<p>that the prison system should come in</p>
<p>and you get a thief, young fans of thief,</p>
<p>robber, and you say, all right, we need carpenters.</p>
<p>We need plumbers.</p>
<p>We need electricians.</p>
<p>We need sheep.</p>
<p>Sentence them to that trade.</p>
<p>And when you get an A plus in that,</p>
<p>where you can go out and make you $30 or $50 an hour,</p>
<p>you go home.</p>
<p>Now you can mess around 10 years if you want to,</p>
<p>or you can do this in two.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just for the prison.</p>
<p>But anyway, I would say that they find somebody</p>
<p>and be true to them.</p>
<p>That we have, just be honest and true in your life.</p>
<p>You mean like relationships, friendships?</p>
<p>Relationships, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, so many, so many people,</p>
<p>particularly our children, are from relationships</p>
<p>where they not wanted their divorce.</p>
<p>Their father&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know who their daddy is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just in foster homes.</p>
<p>500,000 children are in foster homes in America today.</p>
<p>And we have, and our government inadvertently</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t encouraging those people.</p>
<p>My daughter is a doctor and she delivered a couple</p>
<p>of years ago a baby from a 10 year old child.</p>
<p>That child, and she said in the visiting room</p>
<p>is four generations, all of them on welfare.</p>
<p>Now we got one more.</p>
<p>And it reminds me of Elvis Presley&rsquo;s song, In the Ghetto.</p>
<p>So for an individual, learn a trade, become a craftsman,</p>
<p>learn a trade, become a craftsman of sorts,</p>
<p>and find somebody to love and who loves you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, have a family and stick with it.</p>
<p>Surely you&rsquo;re gonna get angry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get disappointed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get all kinds of stuff,</p>
<p>but come back and make up before you go to sleep.</p>
<p>Well, I did half of those things.</p>
<p>I got the first one and working on the second one.</p>
<p>So I appreciate the advice.</p>
<p>Well, Mari, thank you so much for joining us.</p>
<p>Can you tell me the story of how you two met?</p>
<p>Well, my parents every summer would go to the lake</p>
<p>in Canada and the place was called Turkey Point,</p>
<p>which is on Lake Erie, and just have a nice summer holiday</p>
<p>there, water skiing, swimming, sunbathing.</p>
<p>This was back in the 60s and I was sitting on the pier</p>
<p>with a few girlfriends and telling them my story.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden I looked up</p>
<p>and I saw this figure in the distance coming onto the pier.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re all dressed in bathing suits and swimwear.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re swimming and this, that, and the other.</p>
<p>And here he comes, dark trousers.</p>
<p>In fact, they were black, white shirt and a tie</p>
<p>and a straw kind of a Panama hat.</p>
<p>And so he stood out.</p>
<p>And so I invited him to come and sit down.</p>
<p>And so he continued to talk and we just talked</p>
<p>and talked and talked and then later moved to the beach.</p>
<p>And I think the next time I saw him,</p>
<p>he was talking to another girl and I thought, yeah,</p>
<p>you know, I know, I was okay, okay, next.</p>
<p>Well, but six months later I receive a letter</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a letter from Roger.</p>
<p>And then we start this lovely correspondence</p>
<p>and we just start writing, you know, in those days,</p>
<p>you just wrote everything.</p>
<p>And then the next summer he was coming up again.</p>
<p>He was on his way to Alaska and he says,</p>
<p>I would like to come by and see you.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I&rsquo;ll be in the same place</p>
<p>that I met you last year.</p>
<p>And so when he came up this time,</p>
<p>for some reason Roger reached for my hand</p>
<p>and I reached for his and man, that was it.</p>
<p>It was like love at first touch.</p>
<p>That was love.</p>
<p>It was just like a silence, you know, and oh my gosh.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t even look at each other.</p>
<p>It was just, oh my goodness, what happened here?</p>
<p>And I was the type of person, I never wanted to get married,</p>
<p>not way, way, way down the road, never have any children.</p>
<p>And I wanted to see the world first and then do all that,</p>
<p>you know, and.</p>
<p>But that was it, that was love</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been together ever since.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the thing is about the love</p>
<p>that the two of you have for each other</p>
<p>is it had to persevere through quite a heck of a journey.</p>
<p>So how did Roger&rsquo;s drug smuggling</p>
<p>change the nature of your love and your relationship?</p>
<p>Well, Lex, that remained steadfast.</p>
<p>It endured and since Roger&rsquo;s been home,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve rekindled the love that we had</p>
<p>when we first met.</p>
<p>Yeah, what?</p>
<p>But I think my faith, you know, my faith,</p>
<p>my steadfast faith and also the fact</p>
<p>that Roger and I communicated.</p>
<p>We wrote letters, you know, he never complained.</p>
<p>I know there were the children there.</p>
<p>He never had mistreated me.</p>
<p>I love this guy and we had a lot of experiences.</p>
<p>It was just, even though I.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s good looking, charismatic, he&rsquo;s pretty, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he was adventurous, you know,</p>
<p>and I, would you say that again?</p>
<p>But yes, it was just, I know, you know,</p>
<p>I missed him physically, but he was just,</p>
<p>we were just so strong in spirit, you know,</p>
<p>and we could talk to one another.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Well, what was it like, Roger, when you&rsquo;re a free man</p>
<p>seeing Mari for the first time in person again?</p>
<p>I cried for three days.</p>
<p>Everything, I had to look at a picture of her.</p>
<p>I came home and there she prepared a meal for me</p>
<p>and it was the old oak table that I&rsquo;d redone</p>
<p>and the chairs, the same one, and the green placemats</p>
<p>and the same china that we had and the same silverware.</p>
<p>And it just, just all of it just brought back</p>
<p>the same paintings on the wall.</p>
<p>It was just like unbelievable.</p>
<p>After 35 years, she had all my clothes cleaned</p>
<p>and my shoes shining and I put the shoes on</p>
<p>and I walked out on the strings on this</p>
<p>and the soles came off, but the shirts</p>
<p>and all fit perfect and everything.</p>
<p>So it was just wonderful.</p>
<p>And just to see her and then just to think about,</p>
<p>see her picture of her 50th birthday</p>
<p>or her 60th birthday or her 70th birthday.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>And the picture of her and with the children,</p>
<p>it just, it was heartbreaking.</p>
<p>And about the third day, I thought,</p>
<p>man up, fella, I mean, you&rsquo;ve got to.</p>
<p>So I got over it and quit the tears.</p>
<p>It was, everything was just pulsating with life.</p>
<p>It was just unbelievable to get out of that place.</p>
<p>It really was.</p>
<p>Is there, do you regret the drug smuggling</p>
<p>that took you away from the woman you love?</p>
<p>Oh yes, 100%.</p>
<p>Just, you know, I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it again</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to get caught.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, no, it&rsquo;s just, I did it for money</p>
<p>and I had everything in the world I wanted</p>
<p>before I did that.</p>
<p>So the adventure, I mean, it was one heck of an adventure</p>
<p>for the two of you, for the both of you.</p>
<p>Were you able to enjoy it or was it always danger?</p>
<p>Was it always something that threatened your relationship,</p>
<p>your love, your family?</p>
<p>Or were you able to enjoy the adventure of it?</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ll all die.</p>
<p>Life is short.</p>
<p>And to live that kind of adventure.</p>
<p>Well, whenever I did the first loot, I got $10,000.</p>
<p>And that was just about, that was just about two years</p>
<p>pay on the fire department take home.</p>
<p>And I brought that home and.</p>
<p>I put my hand over my mouth.</p>
<p>I said, Roger, I can&rsquo;t believe this.</p>
<p>All the money and money like, oh my, what in the world?</p>
<p>Roger said, let&rsquo;s go have dinner.</p>
<p>And so we went to the little restaurant</p>
<p>that we would normally, we would go to, you know,</p>
<p>and he said, and don&rsquo;t you dare look</p>
<p>on the right hand side of the menu.</p>
<p>He said, just order anything you want.</p>
<p>And it was just, as we were in the restaurant, you know,</p>
<p>it was just, we were giddy about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was giddy about it.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Were you afraid that, I mean, did you think about the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s illegal and Roger can end up in prison?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Did you guys talk about it?</p>
<p>Well, I just, I kind of thought I was bulletproof.</p>
<p>I mean, they didn&rsquo;t catch you.</p>
<p>I thought if they didn&rsquo;t catch you, you was all right.</p>
<p>And it was hard to get you.</p>
<p>It was hard to catch you in the air.</p>
<p>So you never thought, hard to catch you in the air.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that if your friend told on you</p>
<p>five years later, you&rsquo;d still go to prison.</p>
<p>That was a problem.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Did you guys ever talk about walking away?</p>
<p>I asked Roger to walk away.</p>
<p>And he says, I can&rsquo;t, Mario, just now, you know.</p>
<p>And then of course, the amount of people</p>
<p>that he began to support, the family and the gifts and the.</p>
<p>The deals.</p>
<p>The deals, yes, the deals.</p>
<p>Big ones.</p>
<p>Yes, and then you always want to do,</p>
<p>what do you do with the money?</p>
<p>So you want to, I guess you clean it up</p>
<p>or you want to invest in an enterprise or in a business.</p>
<p>Well, it just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>They know the source of it and they take it and run.</p>
<p>Every one of them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But he was very generous, extremely generous</p>
<p>and benevolent and.</p>
<p>And when I started, I would ask about,</p>
<p>I went to a lawyer and a good number of people</p>
<p>in California at that time wanted to legalize marijuana</p>
<p>back in 1973.</p>
<p>And I went to a lawyer and I says,</p>
<p>Mr. Lawyer, I put $100 on to say,</p>
<p>what would they do if I caught me</p>
<p>bringing marijuana across the border?</p>
<p>He said, if you have a criminal record, I said, no,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had a speeding ticket, nothing,</p>
<p>not even a traffic ticket.</p>
<p>I said, he said, you work for the fire department?</p>
<p>I said, no sir.</p>
<p>I said, yes, sir.</p>
<p>He said, you&rsquo;ll get probation.</p>
<p>The worst you&rsquo;ll do is you&rsquo;ll get one year</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll spend four months raking leaves</p>
<p>on a military base.</p>
<p>So my mother and my father died some years before</p>
<p>and I brought mother and baby sister came out</p>
<p>and I took them down to Disneyland</p>
<p>and she said, what you doing, boy?</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m hauling pot, mom.</p>
<p>She said, how much you making?</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m making $40,000 any day I want to go.</p>
<p>And she said, what do they do if they catch you?</p>
<p>And I told her, what the lawyer said.</p>
<p>Four months at the most raking leaves,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what do you think?</p>
<p>She said, do you need a copilot, son?</p>
<p>Yeah, money is money, yeah.</p>
<p>So your relationship persevered through some big challenges.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give about what makes</p>
<p>for a successful relationship?</p>
<p>Oh, well, you know, I think the initial igniting,</p>
<p>meeting someone, you know, that&rsquo;s the love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And that little fire, that fire just keeps burning</p>
<p>and burning and burning.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t put it out no matter what.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the love fire.</p>
<p>But it gets difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, the love fire.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying the love fire is all it takes</p>
<p>to persevere through the difficulty.</p>
<p>Well, no, well, that&rsquo;s a huge part of it.</p>
<p>And also I contribute my individual situation</p>
<p>to in order to endure the prison years is my faith.</p>
<p>Faith in God?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And friends who were unconditionally still loved me</p>
<p>no matter what, yes.</p>
<p>So you had love around you in general.</p>
<p>I did, and my children.</p>
<p>They, you know, and that was a real purpose</p>
<p>to guide them and to love them</p>
<p>and to help them become citizens.</p>
<p>What about you, Roger?</p>
<p>What advice would you give?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know how to do it,</p>
<p>but I do know that you have to work on a relationship.</p>
<p>Mara and I&rsquo;s had problems.</p>
<p>I mean, we get really.</p>
<p>You guys get in fights?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty regular, but not,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t let them last long, you know,</p>
<p>but certainly we are so different.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the same, and yet we&rsquo;re so different, yeah.</p>
<p>Like little stuff?</p>
<p>Little stuff, yes.</p>
<p>And it might be big, but I usually win her over, you know?</p>
<p>But anyhow, I just feel like Mara was always there.</p>
<p>It was like she was my anchor.</p>
<p>I was coming home.</p>
<p>I was always coming home to her and the children.</p>
<p>And you can see throughout my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on getting there.</p>
<p>Are you afraid for his life, by the way?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, there are times, yeah.</p>
<p>But you know, I had faith in him.</p>
<p>He was an excellent pilot.</p>
<p>For example, I always said,</p>
<p>Roger, if the ship&rsquo;s going down,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m jumping in the lifeboat with you</p>
<p>because I know we&rsquo;re going to get to shore.</p>
<p>You will save us.</p>
<p>And so I had that faith in him, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a man, but yet he&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>you want to get into the lifeboat with.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>But then there is, you know, Pablo Escobar,</p>
<p>one of the most dangerous humans in history,</p>
<p>plus the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Worst by far.</p>
<p>Very difficult, very difficult to get away.</p>
<p>In terms of your faith, how has your faith helped you</p>
<p>to be the woman you are in this relationship</p>
<p>and seeing love the way you see it?</p>
<p>Well, I think my faith gives me hope.</p>
<p>I have lots of hope.</p>
<p>It helps me to dwell on the good side.</p>
<p>You know, when I ever meet someone</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some negative,</p>
<p>I try to see why they are like that</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s the source of all that.</p>
<p>And I try to pull out the good.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m a goody goody,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what your faith does.</p>
<p>You know, you see them as God sees us.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>How has he changed over the years?</p>
<p>Roger?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still the same.</p>
<p>Actually, I like him better now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a little calmer.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>And happy to be, you know, at home,</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;ll say, Mari, I am just so happy</p>
<p>to be with you here in this condominium.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m content.</p>
<p>Because I used to call him my homing pigeon.</p>
<p>I just have to let him fly.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t, you know, he has to fly,</p>
<p>but he always came home.</p>
<p>Do you think about the end of this ride, our mortality?</p>
<p>Do you think about your death?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Particularly, I&rsquo;m going to have a heart valve replacement</p>
<p>in about seven days where I could not make it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a very serious operation.</p>
<p>And I think about that very much.</p>
<p>And I ask for peace.</p>
<p>I just lost my brother about 10 days ago, so unexpectedly.</p>
<p>And that really put, you know,</p>
<p>makes you think of your mortality.</p>
<p>Are you afraid?</p>
<p>Somewhat, and yet not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I want to live, Lex.</p>
<p>I want to live, you know?</p>
<p>This life is fun.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you think about your death, Roger?</p>
<p>I have visions.</p>
<p>Visions, and they often happen very, very clear,</p>
<p>like what I have seen in the future.</p>
<p>Scientists might call it wormholes,</p>
<p>or in the Old Testament they called it prophets,</p>
<p>but I see sometimes into the future around the corner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear as we&rsquo;re sitting right here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that look like?</p>
<p>I was on a porch,</p>
<p>and I believe I was in like Central America place.</p>
<p>I was an old man with khaki pants and a white shirt.</p>
<p>And it was a chair with a wide arms, and it was straight,</p>
<p>and there was like the beams coming out above my head,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m on a porch.</p>
<p>Bokunbi, yeah.</p>
<p>And I come, I have out of the body experiences also.</p>
<p>And I came out of my body,</p>
<p>just, I just floated out of my body,</p>
<p>and went into a veil, and like into a mist.</p>
<p>And I believe that&rsquo;s probably why it happened.</p>
<p>You talk about like it&rsquo;s in your past.</p>
<p>This is your future.</p>
<p>This is in my future.</p>
<p>But this is something he has seen,</p>
<p>you know, in the past. I&rsquo;ve seen it in a vision.</p>
<p>Yeah, in a vision. No, I know, but it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>just the tense you use, it happened,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s something that will happen.</p>
<p>Yes. Two.</p>
<p>Both are true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just unbelievable that,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how many people have it, but I have it.</p>
<p>I walked out of my body just like,</p>
<p>just where I could come up to you and look,</p>
<p>and set up on the radio.</p>
<p>I used to be at work on the railroad,</p>
<p>and I had them there.</p>
<p>How do you explain that?</p>
<p>What do you think, what the heck is going on</p>
<p>in this universe that&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, but certainly,</p>
<p>certainly a phenomenon which has happened.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a guy, Bill Monroe,</p>
<p>that wrote the book on it, Out of the Body.</p>
<p>He tells about it.</p>
<p>And who was the guy that writes The Alchemist?</p>
<p>Pablo Coelho.</p>
<p>He has them also, just like that.</p>
<p>And he tells about how it happens on him.</p>
<p>Mine happened differently.</p>
<p>But you certainly can come out of your body.</p>
<p>What do you think the meaning of this life is,</p>
<p>maybe from your faith,</p>
<p>but also from just the amazing adventure</p>
<p>that you lived through?</p>
<p>How do you make sense of why the heck we&rsquo;re here?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of like who you are.</p>
<p>Even when I was a child, I was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m different from other people.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And just as a boy, I was, like I had a&hellip;</p>
<p>Could you put into words how you were different</p>
<p>or it was just the feeling?</p>
<p>Yeah, like my brother, I mean,</p>
<p>he kept his hands clean and his shoes shining.</p>
<p>Here I was barefooted catching a wild hog</p>
<p>or a rattle on a horse trying to get it down.</p>
<p>I saw pictures of you climbing a tree recently.</p>
<p>When I first got out of prison,</p>
<p>always something like that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that, and I noticed that something about me</p>
<p>is sometimes in prison, there&rsquo;d be a knife fight.</p>
<p>And people just, you see them rough guys</p>
<p>that turn white from it.</p>
<p>I just kind of almost like smile.</p>
<p>I mean, if they come at me, I turn white and get away.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t bother, those things,</p>
<p>they still didn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>I just, prison didn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t know what the heck the meaning is.</p>
<p>You just know you&rsquo;re a bit different than the others.</p>
<p>Yeah, I might be a little bit kooky.</p>
<p>Well, maybe the whole point is you want to realize,</p>
<p>you want to let that madness flourish,</p>
<p>that uniqueness flourish.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point of life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all different in our,</p>
<p>in very interesting little ways.</p>
<p>And the more different you are, you want to let that,</p>
<p>you want to let that become, you want to let it be its full.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a garden, all the different flowers.</p>
<p>You did mention you weren&rsquo;t sure</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a free will or not.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s all predetermined?</p>
<p>Or do you think we make our choices?</p>
<p>No, we definitely make our decisions.</p>
<p>I just said, if it is, I hope that,</p>
<p>but I know that we make our decisions.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree.</p>
<p>And I know that we are spirits</p>
<p>that are living in this flesh.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beyond a shadow of a doubt for me.</p>
<p>If you walk out of your body</p>
<p>and have out of body experience, you will know it.</p>
<p>So the body is just the temporary container</p>
<p>for something much bigger.</p>
<p>The spirit lives on eternally with no beginning and no end.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hard to fathom.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is just a little,</p>
<p>this is a shell to contain that spirit.</p>
<p>This is the way we work on earth.</p>
<p>But yeah, I know it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an eternal being.</p>
<p>So are you.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a why to it?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a meaning to this life?</p>
<p>Well, I think the why is beyond my capability</p>
<p>of understanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s someone greater than me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I just know that it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And one day we will know the answers.</p>
<p>Once we get to that crossover to the other side,</p>
<p>I think we will understand clearly.</p>
<p>It says, you know, now we see through a glass darkly,</p>
<p>but then when we are face to face with God,</p>
<p>we will understand.</p>
<p>And until we know, let&rsquo;s just enjoy this beautiful life</p>
<p>while we got it.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re meant.</p>
<p>That was my gift.</p>
<p>I love everybody and everything I do.</p>
<p>And it just, and I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>if I put a stumbling block in anybody&rsquo;s way,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>but these are these things that when I just think about,</p>
<p>oh, what a hypocritical world we live in though.</p>
<p>Like most anybody, I&rsquo;d say, listen, okay,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a drug dealer.</p>
<p>And I would say most of them had committed adultery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cardinal sin.</p>
<p>And yet they move, throw rocks at me for moving a marijuana,</p>
<p>cocaine across the road.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, if you saw the two different things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say, what a terrible difference it is.</p>
<p>But we become conditioned with this mad society</p>
<p>that we have.</p>
<p>You mentioned that your daughter, Miriam, wrote you a poem.</p>
<p>Do you mind reading it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be glad to.</p>
<p>I was doing 11 years up in Lombok Penitentiary,</p>
<p>maximum security prison for parole violation</p>
<p>for possession of marijuana in 1977.</p>
<p>They should have given me six months,</p>
<p>but they gave me 11 years because they wanted me</p>
<p>for what they call silent beef.</p>
<p>Anyhow, while I was in that dungeon,</p>
<p>I received a letter from my daughter, Miriam.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Daddy&rsquo;s Poem.</p>
<p>A year ago, I became a poet when I wrote your birthday prose.</p>
<p>And here I am today, ready to give it another go.</p>
<p>First, I would like to wish you a very happy birthday to be</p>
<p>and to thank you so very much</p>
<p>for without you, I would not be me.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to say that your support has been immense.</p>
<p>It has been true, honest, loving, and free of all pretense.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it goes without saying,</p>
<p>your love has surpassed all my wrongs</p>
<p>and you always made me smile</p>
<p>with one of your old country songs.</p>
<p>I can remember on Cuervo, Daddy,</p>
<p>with you holding me in your arms,</p>
<p>as you sang Jim Reeves songs and talked about the farm.</p>
<p>I can see you walking through the door</p>
<p>from one of your travels far and wide</p>
<p>and the thought of you coming home, Daddy,</p>
<p>kept a twinkle in our eyes.</p>
<p>I can smell you as I did when I used to climb into your bed</p>
<p>and you would talk to me again</p>
<p>about one of the adventures that you led.</p>
<p>I can see me and Mario asleep</p>
<p>in one of your airplanes extraordinaire</p>
<p>and remembering wondering to myself</p>
<p>why there wasn&rsquo;t an available chair.</p>
<p>I remember having to meet you</p>
<p>and worrying that you wouldn&rsquo;t be there,</p>
<p>but you would pop from behind some counter</p>
<p>and give us all a happy scare.</p>
<p>You gave us presents in Key Biscayne</p>
<p>and hotels pleasure galore</p>
<p>and three dozen roses that we came through the airport door.</p>
<p>I can see your face in Amsterdam with the luggage carousel</p>
<p>and you look like a boy with a secret</p>
<p>that you were just dying to tell.</p>
<p>You taught me mathematics in the sands of far away places</p>
<p>and taught me to sail and we left without any traces.</p>
<p>We climbed glaciers in Argentina</p>
<p>and saw the blue of the beautiful caves</p>
<p>and witnessed the majestic beauty of such a juggling maze.</p>
<p>I learned how to change gears on the dirt roads of Brazil.</p>
<p>We ate hot dogs in Paraguay, a memory we smile over still.</p>
<p>We talked about lions, elephants and bears</p>
<p>on a Hacienda in Uruguay,</p>
<p>but decided it was better if the Europe we did fly.</p>
<p>Oh, the old world and all its luxury,</p>
<p>what a good time it was.</p>
<p>From South America to the Krosnopolsky,</p>
<p>I think we fell in love.</p>
<p>The European jaunt, well, it is considered a book in itself</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a story about beauty and knowledge,</p>
<p>suspense and worldly wealth.</p>
<p>We went from Holland to Sweden,</p>
<p>we went from France to Spain</p>
<p>and I promise you I have no regrets.</p>
<p>I would definitely do it all again.</p>
<p>I would see the world with you anytime, sir.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind</p>
<p>because being by your side, daddy,</p>
<p>always ensures a wild good time.</p>
<p>So our paths took a turn and we&rsquo;re back in the US of A,</p>
<p>but life here isn&rsquo;t so bad and I&rsquo;m plumb content to stay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to be near you,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m not as close as I was before,</p>
<p>but because of your love and encouragement,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to open new doors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful to be in school</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m genuinely happy where I am.</p>
<p>And I even like when you call and tell me to study</p>
<p>for the next exam.</p>
<p>What a life you&rsquo;ve given me, daddy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tremendous and a magical gift.</p>
<p>We already have so many stories to tell,</p>
<p>there are far too many to list.</p>
<p>But I want to thank you again this day</p>
<p>with a very big happy birthday to you</p>
<p>and to tell you just a few more things</p>
<p>that I knew in my heart to be true.</p>
<p>That I love you, daddy,</p>
<p>with all of your wrongs and your rights.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re ahead of our family</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve kept us all bound tight.</p>
<p>That you have a honest love in your heart</p>
<p>for God and all mankind.</p>
<p>And you truly do believe in yourself</p>
<p>when you say it will all be fine.</p>
<p>I know you will be there to catch me</p>
<p>if ever I waver a slip</p>
<p>and I know I&rsquo;d want you as captain on any sinking ship.</p>
<p>I also know a new chapter is written.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost time to move on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to sail another sea</p>
<p>and to witness a brand new dawn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be good to see you at the helm again</p>
<p>as you point out our destination,</p>
<p>the laugh and dance on the upper deckers</p>
<p>while the boat glides through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be good to see you on the go</p>
<p>as I know you like to be</p>
<p>and to know you can open any door without any key.</p>
<p>But while we revel in our days together,</p>
<p>we will know better than to hurry</p>
<p>because as you told me many times,</p>
<p>life is an incredible journey.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Roger, I&rsquo;m really honored that you would take the time</p>
<p>to visit me in Texas and to sit down and talk with me.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Roger.</p>
<p>Thanks so much, Mary. Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you, it was a pleasure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a real pleasure.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Roger Reeves</p>
<p>and thank you to Noom, Allform, ExpressVPN,</p>
<p>Four Sigmatic and 8sleep.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Pablo Escobar.</p>
<p>All empires are created of blood and fire.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next time.</p>
