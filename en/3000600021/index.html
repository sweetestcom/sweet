    <ul>
<li>Good evening, everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ann Harrison.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the dean at the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>Welcome to today&rsquo;s Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series</p>
<p>co-sponsored by the Haas Healthcare Association,</p>
<p>John E. Martin Mental Healthcare Challenge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honored to introduce and welcome back to campus</p>
<p>a double bear in political science and law, Leigh Steinberg.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>As chairman and founder</p>
<p>of Steinberg Sports and Entertainment,</p>
<p>Leigh is best known for his work building athletes</p>
<p>into stand-alone brands,</p>
<p>and he has represented many of the most successful athletes</p>
<p>and coaches in sport.</p>
<p>With an unrivaled history of record-setting contracts,</p>
<p>Leigh has secured over $4 billion</p>
<p>for his more than 300 pro athlete clients.</p>
<p>Not only is he a leader in his field,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also a leader here at Berkeley.</p>
<p>Leigh served as co-chair</p>
<p>of his 50th reunion campaign last year</p>
<p>and he was a recent participant in Berkeley Changemakers.</p>
<p>He also told me before we got on the stage here,</p>
<p>that he was the president of the ASUC of the student body</p>
<p>when he was an undergraduate here.</p>
<p>Equally as noteworthy, Leigh has distinguished himself</p>
<p>as an exemplary leader of beyond himself.</p>
<p>He has directed more than $800 million</p>
<p>to various charities around the world.</p>
<p>Leigh has received many commendations</p>
<p>for his philanthropic work,</p>
<p>including being named man of the year over a dozen times</p>
<p>by a variety of organizations.</p>
<p>In addition to all this,</p>
<p>Leigh is also a best-selling author,</p>
<p>his most recent book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Agent: My 40-Year Career Making Deals</p>
<p>and Changing the Game&rdquo;</p>
<p>details his decades of dominance in the sports industry</p>
<p>as well, sheds light on his personal struggles</p>
<p>to launch his comeback.</p>
<p>At this point, you guys should all know</p>
<p>that he was also the model</p>
<p>for Jerry McGuire in &ldquo;Jerry Maguire,&rdquo;</p>
<p>just in case you didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Thank you, Leigh, for being here today,</p>
<p>we really are so grateful for both your time</p>
<p>and your willingness</p>
<p>to share your professional and personal journey</p>
<p>with all of us.</p>
<p>I know there is so much that we will learn</p>
<p>from tonight&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>And with that,</p>
<p>I turn it over to Songwen Chen, MBA, MPH 2022,</p>
<p>and co-president of the Haas Healthcare Association</p>
<p>to get us started.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>(audience claps)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you, and just confirming y&rsquo;all can hear?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Audience] Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awesome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Leigh, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be here.</p>
<p>You once said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think all of us in our lives can envision a world</p>
<p>that we would like to have</p>
<p>and then realize it&rsquo;s better to light candles</p>
<p>than to curse the darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with your story,</p>
<p>can you share more about what you meant by that</p>
<p>and a little bit more about your journey,</p>
<p>not only as a sports agent,</p>
<p>but personally as you dealt with the alcoholism</p>
<p>in your path to sobriety?</p>
<ul>
<li>So the question was?</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Long question, just you know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just to talk about that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, just your journey,</p>
<p>how we got to you as a sports agent,</p>
<p>just some of the personal challenges</p>
<p>in this path that you&rsquo;re on now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Got it, so I&rsquo;m thrilled to be here at Haas,</li>
</ul>
<p>which I consider to be the best business school</p>
<p>in my country.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>With the distinguished faculty</p>
<p>and amazing students</p>
<p>and I welcome the students</p>
<p>from equally Augusta institutions</p>
<p>and from Harvard and Wharton and&hellip;</p>
<p>So I grew up in Los Angeles,</p>
<p>came up to Cal Berkeley in the late &rsquo;60s,</p>
<p>and this was the center of rock music and herbal substances</p>
<p>and liberated men and women</p>
<p>and it was the most exciting place in the country to be.</p>
<p>I was a dorm counselor in an undergraduate dormitory</p>
<p>and they moved the freshmen football team into the dorm,</p>
<p>and one of the students was Steve Bartkowski,</p>
<p>and in 1975, he became the very first player picked</p>
<p>in the first round of the National Football League draft.</p>
<p>And he asked me to represent him,</p>
<p>well, there really wasn&rsquo;t any sports agent treason,</p>
<p>teams could just hang up the phone and say,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t deal with agents, click.</p>
<p>And so we got lucky,</p>
<p>Bartkowski was the first picked in the first round.</p>
<p>He got the largest rookie contract in NFL history.</p>
<p>And when we arrived in Atlanta</p>
<p>to sign the contract the next day</p>
<p>there were Klieg lights flashing in the sky,</p>
<p>a huge crowd was pressed up against the police line</p>
<p>and the first thing we heard was,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We interrupt the &ldquo;Johnny Carson Show&rdquo;</p>
<p>to bring you a special news bulletin,</p>
<p>Steve Bartkowski and Leigh Steinberg have arrived.</p>
<p>We switch you live live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d been raised by a father</p>
<p>who raised us with two core values.</p>
<p>One was, treasure relationships, especially family.</p>
<p>And the second</p>
<p>was try to make a meaningful, positive impact in the world</p>
<p>and help people who couldn&rsquo;t help themselves.</p>
<p>And I saw then that the athletes could be role models</p>
<p>and if they retrace their roots to the high school community</p>
<p>and set up a scholarship fund,</p>
<p>boys and girls club, work with inner city kids</p>
<p>or at the university level,</p>
<p>they came back and repaid their scholarship</p>
<p>and bonded with those alums,</p>
<p>they could be mentored</p>
<p>and they could lay the foundation for second career.</p>
<p>And at the pro level we challenge each athlete</p>
<p>to find something in their own life</p>
<p>that they would like to tackle</p>
<p>and then put together a charitable foundation</p>
<p>with the leading business figures,</p>
<p>political figures and community leaders</p>
<p>to help project a program.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s work done</p>
<p>who ran for Tampa and Atlanta</p>
<p>putting the 175th single mother and the family</p>
<p>in the first home they&rsquo;ll ever own.</p>
<p>And by making the down payment and outfitting it.</p>
<p>Or it can be Patrick Mahomes</p>
<p>giving through his 15 and the Mahomies</p>
<p>to a whole variety of children&rsquo;s charities,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s athletes making a difference</p>
<p>and they also can message.</p>
<p>And in messaging,</p>
<p>I had the heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis</p>
<p>cut a public service announcement that said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real men don&rsquo;t hit women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that could do more to trigger behavioral change</p>
<p>in rebellious adolescents in 1,000 authority figures.</p>
<p>So I had a pretty charmed life.</p>
<p>This is, next year will be my 48th draft,</p>
<p>but sometime in the 2000s, a series of things happened.</p>
<p>My two kids were diagnosed</p>
<p>with something called retinitis pigmentosa,</p>
<p>which is an eye disease</p>
<p>that leads to narrowing and ultimately blindness.</p>
<p>My father died a long death of cancer,</p>
<p>we lost a home in a beach side city to mold</p>
<p>and had to raise it to the ground.</p>
<p>And I was okay handling anything in my work life.</p>
<p>I understood there&rsquo;d be adversity</p>
<p>and life will knock you back</p>
<p>and you can do anything you want,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t really always turn out wonderful.</p>
<p>But I felt like Gulliver, sitting on the beach,</p>
<p>tethered down with no ability to solve these problems</p>
<p>with, well, a piercing sticking forks in me</p>
<p>and I turned to the wrong thing.</p>
<p>I turned to alcohol and I eventually devolved to a point</p>
<p>where I gave my practice away</p>
<p>to the younger lawyers, I closed down my home</p>
<p>and I went to live at my parents&rsquo; house at 61 years of age.</p>
<p>And the only thought as I sat on my father&rsquo;s bed</p>
<p>was where and I find more alcohol?</p>
<p>Where can I find more vodka?</p>
<p>And I had an epiphany in that moment</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t a starving peasant in Darfur,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have the last name Steinberg in Nazi Germany</p>
<p>in the late &rsquo;30s.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t crippled, so what excuse did I have</p>
<p>to not live up to that?</p>
<p>And so I went off to sober living,</p>
<p>worked a 12-step program with a unique fellowship.</p>
<p>And if I keep doing what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll, in a couple of months, be 12 years continuously sober.</p>
<p>(audience claps)</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;It is better to light candles that to curse darkness.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>We you thank you for sharing that.</p>
<p>On that journey,</p>
<p>can you share more about some of your major allies?</p>
<p>Can you share about any advice</p>
<p>that you might have for others</p>
<p>going through similar challenges?</p>
<ul>
<li>So I think the key in life,</li>
</ul>
<p>the critical skill is your ability</p>
<p>to hone your listening skills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ability to couple over surface</p>
<p>and understand the deepest anxieties</p>
<p>and fears of another person</p>
<p>and their greatest hopes and dreams,</p>
<p>but it requires creating trust and stillness</p>
<p>around another human being.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll couple over surface</p>
<p>and peel back the layers of the onion</p>
<p>so that they get deeper and deeper</p>
<p>and you actually bond.</p>
<p>You know, we wear masks very often,</p>
<p>not these but emotional masks,</p>
<p>and those masks stop people</p>
<p>from realizing the commonality of their problems.</p>
<p>And so when people don&rsquo;t talk about mental health,</p>
<p>then they assume that they uniquely are having this problem.</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re the only person in the world,</p>
<p>but if we ever shared that and we&rsquo;re open about it,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve always said that mental health is health,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s health, and it&rsquo;s just another form of it.</p>
<p>And if we can take the stigma away from that</p>
<p>and message in a way,</p>
<p>so that I&rsquo;ve had athletes who I encouraged to speak out</p>
<p>on mental health issues</p>
<p>and to talk about the fact that they&rsquo;re hurting</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re depressed or they&rsquo;re bipolar</p>
<p>or whatever they are,</p>
<p>but it takes some courage in a very much world to do that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so important,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been open about my alcoholism</p>
<p>in the hope that someone out there</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s struggling and impacted</p>
<p>is hopeless and desperate,</p>
<p>well, realize that help is available.</p>
<p>And we need to do exactly the same thing with mental health</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s treatable for the most part</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so proud of all the students here</p>
<p>who have come up with different ways to create treatment,</p>
<p>to create awareness.</p>
<p>But one of the things that we talked about earlier today</p>
<p>was could you do a week of television</p>
<p>like they did about smoking</p>
<p>where every single dramatically scripted show</p>
<p>and comedic show that ran for a week</p>
<p>had mental health woven into their plot?</p>
<p>And somehow again, remove the stigma</p>
<p>and talk about the very real challenges that people face.</p>
<ul>
<li>That resonates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leigh, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you for your bravery and transparency</p>
<p>in sharing about that.</p>
<p>What you said about de-stigmatizing and raising awareness,</p>
<p>it lands, and you know, I could have mentioned this earlier,</p>
<p>but grateful for everyone coming here</p>
<p>as part of our Mental Healthcare Challenge</p>
<p>and appreciate all that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>in sharing your stories, being creative, being innovative</p>
<p>and being brave.</p>
<p>Leigh, let&rsquo;s pivot a little bit.</p>
<p>Back to the sports world,</p>
<p>as the global dialogue</p>
<p>on mental health continues to be amplified,</p>
<p>its intersections with athletics and sports,</p>
<p>definitely gaining more traction,</p>
<p>withdrawals from competition</p>
<p>by Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles, right?</p>
<p>To awareness efforts led by Michael Phelps,</p>
<p>and we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>NBA players DeMar DeRozan, Kevin Love,</p>
<p>I think society just has a far better appreciation</p>
<p>of these dynamics, some you just spoke to.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on with this trend?</p>
<p>Can you comment</p>
<p>on what factors made it so challenging previously</p>
<p>and where we&rsquo;re going now with becoming more authentic</p>
<p>and more vulnerable?</p>
<ul>
<li>So you now know that athletes have access to social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re expressing opinions all the time</p>
<p>and they blunt.</p>
<p>So the social currency today for an athlete</p>
<p>is how many followers you have on Twitter, Instagram,</p>
<p>God forbid, TikTok, Snapchat,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t dance,</p>
<p>but at any rate, it&rsquo;s social currency,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re able to define themselves</p>
<p>as they choose in a variety of different ways.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for Naomi Osaka</p>
<p>and thank goodness</p>
<p>for that wonderful, you know, Simone Biles,</p>
<p>because what they did in a worldwide forum</p>
<p>was to talk about the problems they were having</p>
<p>and not be afraid.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s liberating for people</p>
<p>to hear that,</p>
<p>because again, you feel isolated, alone in a world.</p>
<p>I suffered when I was younger,</p>
<p>still suffer from low-level depression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about debilitating,</p>
<p>like I could get out of bed,</p>
<p>but there were times when the world turned dark</p>
<p>and it was hard to see where the hope was</p>
<p>and where the future was.</p>
<p>And so I started using antidepressants, Prozac,</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t had that problem since.</p>
<p>And, oh my God, thank you for my life back</p>
<p>because it was just episodic.</p>
<p>So we can design programs for athletes.</p>
<p>If any of you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there are any football fans here,</p>
<p>but Fox pregame did an interview</p>
<p>with an offensive lineman from the Green Bay Packers,</p>
<p>and Jay Glazer did it.</p>
<p>And he talked about his problems with depression.</p>
<p>And we can do more of that, we can do more of that,</p>
<p>and athletes especially have the ability, as I said before,</p>
<p>to trigger imitative behaviors, especially in young,</p>
<p>they are larger than life.</p>
<p>Whether they should be role models or not is,</p>
<p>I believe they should be role models,</p>
<p>but the point is we can have them do all sorts</p>
<p>of public service announcements</p>
<p>and like I talked about a week on TV,</p>
<p>we can start to be creative in terms of how we model this.</p>
<p>And I want my athletes to lead the way.</p>
<p>(audience claps)</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree, I think the opportunity for these athletes,</li>
</ul>
<p>many of them, as you say, larger than life,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much opportunity for them to champion, to lead.</p>
<p>How do we continue this, right?</p>
<p>How do we ensure that those support systems</p>
<p>are there so that they can continue-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Say the last part again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we continue this?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How do we ensure that athletes grow more comfortable</p>
<p>sharing their experiences, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking support systems, can it be the league,</p>
<p>can it be players associations?</p>
<ul>
<li>So we have to take the structure</li>
</ul>
<p>of pro sports and collegiate sports.</p>
<p>And that means leagues,</p>
<p>individual franchises, players associations,</p>
<p>agents have the same responsibility</p>
<p>and every person that interacts has to be on board.</p>
<p>So we have to get buy-in from all those groups</p>
<p>so that, look, what&rsquo;s an athlete afraid of?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll think he&rsquo;s weak or she&rsquo;s weak.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll start to think of them a different way.</p>
<p>If you have as crazy or demented or not all there,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll lose their place on the team</p>
<p>if they have to miss any time.</p>
<p>And so for an athlete, long-term health is an abstraction.</p>
<p>They live in a world of denial.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been fighting the concussion fight for 30 years now</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause when we first went to doctors</p>
<p>and asked how many are too many, what&rsquo;s the magic number,</p>
<p>they had no answers.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve held 17 concussion conferences.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem,</p>
<p>athletes have been taught</p>
<p>from Little League and Pop Warner to ignore pain,</p>
<p>that real men don&rsquo;t complain,</p>
<p>not to get left out of the unit.</p>
<p>And the only people who share those values</p>
<p>are our people in the service, army people,</p>
<p>you know, Navy, Marines,</p>
<p>so both are young groups of young people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in total denial.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that if in your and my reality,</p>
<p>the key would be long-term health,</p>
<p>and way beneath that as a value</p>
<p>would be playing a pro career</p>
<p>and way below that as a value</p>
<p>would be playing in a given season,</p>
<p>and way below that the ability to play in a given game,</p>
<p>the athlete turns it on their head,</p>
<p>the play is everything, I have to play this play.</p>
<p>So you have young people&rsquo;s denial, right?</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got athletic denial,</p>
<p>so you got young people in an athletic group.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s denial cubed or squared,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very difficult to penetrate</p>
<p>but we can do this through enlisting</p>
<p>at the collegiate level athletic directors,</p>
<p>chancellors, different people,</p>
<p>the medical staff that treats the players,</p>
<p>the trainers that treats the players,</p>
<p>to be very systematic and organized</p>
<p>about the way in which we integrate these concepts</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s okay to talk about mental health problems,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay to seek treatment and you can get better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>That dichotomy between the short-term, that next play,</p>
<p>and long-term health, it&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>
<p>And what you said about rallying all the stakeholders, ADs,</p>
<p>trainers, uphill battle.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, Songwen, think about the fact</li>
</ul>
<p>that I would call an athlete up</p>
<p>who got a concussion in a game,</p>
<p>and I would say the first thing you need to do is rest.</p>
<p>The second thing you need to do is be asymptomatic</p>
<p>on an exercycle.</p>
<p>The third thing is asymptomatic at practice.</p>
<p>And only then can you consider going into a game</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t, if you got one and it took that,</p>
<p>the second one is like that.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d call up whoever, Ben Roethlisberger or someone</p>
<p>and they would play anyway.</p>
<p>So, you know it&rsquo;s a battle, but it&rsquo;s one worth having</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s where you got to keep chipping away at it.</p>
<p>But again, take the structure of high school, collegiate</p>
<p>and professional sports,</p>
<p>and at each level permeate the leadership there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like the way we tackled bullying.</p>
<p>I got college players to talk to high school players</p>
<p>about tolerance and said if you guys lead the way</p>
<p>at this high school,</p>
<p>and instead of, you know, making fun of someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got a harelip or is overweight</p>
<p>or (indistinct) or whatever, you put your arm around them,</p>
<p>you can change the culture</p>
<p>in that high school really quickly</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause athletes sit at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s looking at every level</p>
<p>of how people get information,</p>
<p>what formulation there is in their attitudes.</p>
<p>And we need to teach about mental health</p>
<p>in elementary school, in junior high</p>
<p>and high school and all the way through.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I agree, it is a comprehensive approach, right?</p>
<p>(audience claps)</p>
<p>Uphill battle, worth having those allies as a sports agent,</p>
<p>as an advocate.</p>
<p>I wanna talk a little bit more</p>
<p>about the broader industry, excuse me,</p>
<p>and the job, your job as a sports agent.</p>
<p>I think you answered</p>
<p>one of the questions I had coming up actually</p>
<p>about, you know, requiring the athletes that you represent</p>
<p>to create structure plans to give back to their communities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to share a little bit more about that,</p>
<p>but also comment on how this has benefited those athletes</p>
<p>beyond the realm of just public relations and branding.</p>
<ul>
<li>So I was raised by a father</li>
</ul>
<p>who said that when you see a problem in the world,</p>
<p>and it could be as minor as picking this glass up or trash,</p>
<p>it could be as major as bad police shootings</p>
<p>and inner city circumstances,</p>
<p>it can be the environment or whatever,</p>
<p>and you wait for they or them to solve the problem,</p>
<p>so who are they or them?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all the people, the political figures</p>
<p>or business leaders,</p>
<p>he would say you could wait forever.</p>
<p>The they is you, son, you are the they.</p>
<p>So if you take that sense of individual responsibility,</p>
<p>the enemy for athletes is self-absorption,</p>
<p>being part of a little teeny community of other athletes</p>
<p>where they are disconnected from everything else.</p>
<p>So the key is I&rsquo;ll ask an athlete in the first session,</p>
<p>what skills or aspirations you have</p>
<p>other than athletic ones</p>
<p>so that you can try to design that?</p>
<p>Now self-absorption is like,</p>
<p>well, enough about me,</p>
<p>can we talk about how you feel about me?</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s self-absorption.</p>
<p>So the key</p>
<p>is to get an athlete seeing himself as an active actor,</p>
<p>empowerment, empower them to be, you know, responsible</p>
<p>and develop different things.</p>
<p>So you can get them to be leaders by,</p>
<p>if you sit and talk with the athletes,</p>
<p>some of them had a parent who had mental illness.</p>
<p>Someone had mental illness themselves.</p>
<p>Some of them had someone who&rsquo;s suffered</p>
<p>from sickle cell anemia or Tay-Sachs</p>
<p>or something or inner city kids or single mothers,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s ferreting that out</p>
<p>and then we put, again, a charitable foundation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got leading business figures, political figures</p>
<p>and community leaders to help execute that program.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s making sure</p>
<p>that at least the athletes I work with</p>
<p>understand how they become empowered,</p>
<p>how they can take control of their own lives</p>
<p>so that second career is not a kind of death to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, what you said about empowering them, that resonates,</li>
</ul>
<p>how do they continue to give back and be role models?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stay within the sports industry</p>
<p>but shift more to the job as a sports agent.</p>
<p>Can you comment on some of the diversity challenges</p>
<p>and opportunities within the sports agent industry?</p>
<p>Can you comment a little bit more</p>
<p>about how we get to a place where athletes</p>
<p>are represented more by people who look like them</p>
<p>and come from the same backgrounds?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, (laughs).</li>
</ul>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s really important in sports</p>
<p>that we have minority ownership</p>
<p>and we just don&rsquo;t have enough of it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s basically lily-white ownership.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>because the same way it was important</p>
<p>for President Obama to be president,</p>
<p>because then you get a young kid</p>
<p>not aspiring to be an athlete</p>
<p>but aspiring that you can be president of the United States,</p>
<p>that you can be a business leader,</p>
<p>that you can be this, that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to have that.</p>
<p>We need more executives</p>
<p>and more diversity</p>
<p>where we have our first female general manager</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s from Vietnamese background,</p>
<p>we need more coaches, more head coaches to be that.</p>
<p>Now to do this, you&rsquo;ve got to start the pool much earlier.</p>
<p>So when I was representing Warren Moon</p>
<p>who was a Hall of Fame quarterback</p>
<p>who had to go to Canada for six years</p>
<p>before he could come back into a prejudiced NFL,</p>
<p>the question was, how are we gonna solve this problem</p>
<p>of having these gifted athletes not playing this position</p>
<p>because of prejudice?</p>
<p>So the key</p>
<p>was to get high school African-American quarterbacks</p>
<p>that were 6'4&quot; not to switch to play tight end</p>
<p>or something or another sport,</p>
<p>but to play drop-back passing quarterback.</p>
<p>You have to create the supply enough.</p>
<p>So for trying to create diversity,</p>
<p>we need training programs, whatever it is,</p>
<p>internships, places where we&rsquo;re creating a big enough pool</p>
<p>that we can make this happen.</p>
<p>Because again, everyone in sports is a role model.</p>
<p>And as to the representation of,</p>
<p>I mean, we have African-American agents who work with us.</p>
<p>We have female agents who work with us.</p>
<p>We have an Asian-American who works with us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to create, with a woman I have now,</p>
<p>the first great female sports agent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause I think that&rsquo;s important too.</p>
<p>And when we hit these breakthroughs,</p>
<p>remember when I was growing up,</p>
<p>there were no women in broadcast news.</p>
<p>Can you imagine?</p>
<p>No women in broadcast news.</p>
<p>Forget a sportswriter, forget all of that,</p>
<p>and then this ceiling gets broken</p>
<p>and then we don&rsquo;t even remember</p>
<p>that that was ever true.</p>
<p>And so you have to work consistently on diversity</p>
<p>and you have to remain committed to it</p>
<p>and you have to be clever and creative.</p>
<p>So one of the things we do is we have an agent academy,</p>
<p>but we also have a sports career conference.</p>
<p>And there we bring,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m trying to mentor the next generation</p>
<p>of talented sports professionals</p>
<p>who have ethics and values and don&rsquo;t use,</p>
<p>well, I was talking with the dean</p>
<p>about the concept of situational ethics.</p>
<p>So part of what&rsquo;s wrong with this society</p>
<p>is that people use one set of ethics to be a nice father,</p>
<p>to be a good neighbor, to be nice to cats and dogs,</p>
<p>and then go out in the workplace</p>
<p>and use heinous social Darwin tactics</p>
<p>because after all the end justifies the means, right?</p>
<p>And that leads to a bifurcation</p>
<p>and a type of soul death, right?</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re maintaining these two antithetical values</p>
<p>and operating in different parts of your life,</p>
<p>it creates dissonance</p>
<p>that is very difficult.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, thank you for sharing that, Leigh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking back to the question</p>
<p>about challenges and opportunities,</p>
<p>I agree that it&rsquo;s comprehensive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s systemic, it&rsquo;s upstream.</p>
<p>Further downstream thinking about what you said</p>
<p>about the great sports agents,</p>
<p>staying within the industry here,</p>
<p>can you share more about the biggest differentiator</p>
<p>between successful sports agents today</p>
<p>compared to those when you helped build the industry?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, if Rip Van Winkle had gone to sleep when I started,</p>
<p>and awoke today, he&rsquo;d be in culture shock</p>
<p>because none of you will remember this,</p>
<p>but we lived in a world</p>
<p>where if you called somebody on the phone</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t answer, it rang busy, okay?</p>
<p>And there were no cell phones.</p>
<p>There was no computers.</p>
<p>You had to have a roll of quarters to go to a payphone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a phone that you put money in to pay for.</p>
<p>And it was, you know, totally different.</p>
<p>So teams at that stage in the NFL made $2 million</p>
<p>as their share of the national TV contract.</p>
<p>Last year, they made 200 million per team per season</p>
<p>and they just did a new contract for 10 years.</p>
<p>And some art of him and you could, like art,</p>
<p>you could get one to 50 and buy that,</p>
<p>or you could buy one individual one.</p>
<p>So we put him up for charity for 20 minutes</p>
<p>and he sold $3.2 million worth of this.</p>
<p>Now it doesn&rsquo;t exist except on your computer screen, okay?</p>
<p>So get that,</p>
<p>if you can get that thinking and understand where we are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s now you have NILs on campus,</p>
<p>and since July 1st, the whole world of college athletics</p>
<p>has turned upside down.</p>
<p>And so now where I would talk to a football player</p>
<p>they would have to be three years on campus</p>
<p>to come out in the draft, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d start talking to them right as they go</p>
<p>into that third year.</p>
<p>Today, high school players can sign NILs.</p>
<p>So it moves the whole time frame.</p>
<p>You know, again, pretty soon I&rsquo;ll be going</p>
<p>to, you know, maternity wards trying to sign young kids,</p>
<p>the babies and, you know, the birth twice.</p>
<p>So the key in all this</p>
<p>is a world just revolutionized and changed.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a whole generation,</p>
<p>not that any of you would be part of it,</p>
<p>but a whole generation that is brought up on big screen,</p>
<p>color and sound and fast cutting and multitasking</p>
<p>and stuff swimming over you,</p>
<p>the concept of imagination that you would go out in the yard</p>
<p>and find a box and create a game, no more.</p>
<p>So social media has figured out really cleverly</p>
<p>how to addict young people to likes and to text responses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll go absolutely crazy if not enough people liked them,</p>
<p>oh my God, it&rsquo;s a rejection to me as a human being,</p>
<p>no one liked me in the last 10 seconds.</p>
<p>So it means I gotta get whatever I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>It attenuates attention span,</p>
<p>it subverts the concept of patience.</p>
<p>And so one of the things you gotta do today, Songwen,</p>
<p>is get it out fast.</p>
<p>If you think an athlete sitting there for an hour</p>
<p>listening to this elongated pitch, they&rsquo;re not, you know.</p>
<p>So you better talk fast or you condense.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a different generation of Gen Z.</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely, absolutely different generation,</li>
</ul>
<p>different innovations, revolutions, innovation,</p>
<p>non-fungible tokens, as you say,</p>
<p>and see how the name, image and likeness law</p>
<p>manifests over time.</p>
<p>Leigh, lemme ask you one final planned question for you.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing all that you did,</p>
<p>appreciate that we covered all these important themes</p>
<p>for mental health advocacy.</p>
<p>A lighter question.</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious &ldquo;Jerry Maguire,&rdquo;</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your favorite sports movie?</p>
<ul>
<li>(laughs) My favorite sports movie</li>
</ul>
<p>goes well before your time.</p>
<p>It would be, there&rsquo;s a movie called &ldquo;Pride of the Yanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every sports movie based on a true story</p>
<p>that has an aspirational curve to it</p>
<p>that goes from conflict and failure</p>
<p>to fruition makes money all day long.</p>
<p>And so after I worked on &ldquo;Jerry Maguire&rdquo;</p>
<p>which is loosely based on me,</p>
<p>and then I worked on a movie called &ldquo;Any Given Sunday&rdquo;</p>
<p>and a rap guy</p>
<p>was supposed to play the quarterback in it,</p>
<p>but he couldn&rsquo;t throw the football.</p>
<p>So I was technical advisor.</p>
<p>So he said, &ldquo;What do you think of him throwing a football?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;When I went to Berkeley</p>
<p>there were powder puff quarterbacks</p>
<p>who could throw better than he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t use them unless you wanna double them</p>
<p>in every scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they fired him</p>
<p>and it gave a young comedic actor his first dramatic role</p>
<p>and that was Jamie Foxx, so that was a fun one.</p>
<p>So my favorite, oh, I said I love them,</p>
<p>I thought &ldquo;The Blind Side&rdquo; was great.</p>
<p>I thought &ldquo;Radio&rdquo; was great.</p>
<p>I thought &ldquo;Hoosiers&rdquo; was great.</p>
<p>I thought the Denzel Washington film,</p>
<p>oh my God, he&rsquo;s anything he does, yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>Awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leigh, thank you so much for sharing.</p>
<p>So glad to have you here.</p>
<p>(audience claps)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, thank you so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>We now have an opportunity for some Q and A.</p>
<p>So some of you would like to ask a question,</p>
<p>you can go to the mic in the back</p>
<p>and that way people who are viewing this possibly online</p>
<p>can also hear the question.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>and please identify yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, Leigh, thanks for coming, thanks for the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Muhammad, I&rsquo;m an MBA student here.</p>
<p>I wanted to follow up on doing more for athletes</p>
<p>where you were talking about particularly ex-athletes,</p>
<p>average NFL career, I think, is something like three years,</p>
<p>NBA is something like four years.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s being done for that population,</p>
<p>the ex-athlete population?</p>
<p>And who do you think,</p>
<p>is there any one group that&rsquo;s better positioned, I guess,</p>
<p>to do something more for them than anybody else?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Could you repeat the question, Ann?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, you want me to repeat the question?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mohammad is asking what is being done for athletes</p>
<p>after they terminate their career as an athlete?</p>
<p>Is that the question?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Mohammad] That&rsquo;s right, particularly for mental health</li>
</ul>
<p>and for sort of the financial support.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For mental health?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Mohammad] Right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not enough is the first answer,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all in the preparation of it.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;ve done my job right,</p>
<p>I ought to pick up the fact</p>
<p>that someone&rsquo;s depressed or bipolar</p>
<p>or whatever they are early enough</p>
<p>that we can get them help.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got the same stigma and worry, you know,</p>
<p>to be open and honest about it,</p>
<p>but teams are actually fine</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be pleased for how they are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got access to the best mental health professionals.</p>
<p>People are dying to work for the teams.</p>
<p>So the whole thing is to get them to be open</p>
<p>and not have the thing be discovered</p>
<p>in the course of a bad incident, right?</p>
<p>In other words, the time to discover that</p>
<p>is not when you have someone in domestic violence</p>
<p>or in a fight or in a drunk driving or whatever it is,</p>
<p>the time to discover is early.</p>
<p>So we need to do a better job</p>
<p>of getting our team physicians and trainers</p>
<p>to bring this out.</p>
<p>And the players worry</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;ll be in their health records, right?</p>
<p>And it might be somehow used</p>
<p>as a reason to obviate a guarantee or not pay them,</p>
<p>or, you know, do whatever.</p>
<p>So not enough but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if they can pick it up early enough,</p>
<p>we have pretty effective techniques,</p>
<p>but a lot of times it doesn&rsquo;t come out</p>
<p>until something horrible happens.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Mohammad] Got it, thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Angel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m an MBA student from the East Coast.</p>
<p>I wanna thank you for your time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve spoken a lot about athletes and about agents.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear your perspective on another stakeholder</p>
<p>in the ecosystem, specifically investors and financiers.</p>
<p>Given this as a business atmosphere,</p>
<p>what are the types of structural issues</p>
<p>that have incentivized investors</p>
<p>to make conflicting decisions</p>
<p>that might come at the cost of athlete mental health?</p>
<p>And even agents,</p>
<p>if agent compensation is tied to athlete contract,</p>
<p>do you feel like your role has pushed you to make decisions</p>
<p>that might have encouraged adverse outcomes for athletes?</p>
<ul>
<li>Ann, can you just paraphrase?</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, absolutely delighted to.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the question is, is for investors</p>
<p>as well as for agents,</p>
<p>might they have the wrong incentives</p>
<p>because of the system to support solutions to mental health?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, if they,</li>
</ul>
<p>so look, I mean, for years it was shut up and play.</p>
<p>In other words, the point is that put it under the rug.</p>
<p>You know, you do own a professional sports team,</p>
<p>you know, the Dallas Cowboys are now worth $5 billion.</p>
<p>So if you were to lose a key player</p>
<p>for a mental health issue and he couldn&rsquo;t perform,</p>
<p>we have something called a salary cap now.</p>
<p>So that means it&rsquo;s starters, starting players,</p>
<p>make huge amounts of money</p>
<p>but their backups are very relatively weak</p>
<p>and free agents or people playing for lease.</p>
<p>So the institution wants a player out playing,</p>
<p>the investor wants a player out playing,</p>
<p>and they just assume to not know.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the impediment,</p>
<p>which is the standard is so different</p>
<p>and what a team wants</p>
<p>is productivity on the field.</p>
<p>They, in general as a business,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not in the mental health business.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we have to sensitize them to it.</p>
<p>And for the advantages and then other modalities,</p>
<p>I was talking today about hyperbaric oxygen</p>
<p>and a process called rTMS</p>
<p>that helps people with concussions and other depression,</p>
<p>right stem and all the rest of it.</p>
<p>So we have to be innovative</p>
<p>in the techniques we use with these athletes</p>
<p>because the cutting edge of biomed</p>
<p>is far ahead of the regular standard of medicine.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Angel] Thanks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello, Leigh.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is John, I teach accounting here-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Leigh] He said what?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accounting, he teaches- - Accounting, yeah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>I got a question about,</p>
<p>you mentioned Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka</p>
<p>dealing with their mental health</p>
<p>they did get some pushback from some folks on social media.</p>
<p>How would you counsel athletes to deal with that?</p>
<p>Just stay off social media or how would they cope</p>
<p>with the need to look after the mental health</p>
<p>and without-</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, the first thing is to be really clear</li>
</ul>
<p>about what the state of their mental health is</p>
<p>because by the time Simone Biles</p>
<p>is deciding she can&rsquo;t compete,</p>
<p>people have already judged her.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re not thinking of it in a larger way.</p>
<p>If you could get out in front of that,</p>
<p>having a press statement or either a statement,</p>
<p>a press conference, something that says,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;ve given my whole life to gymnastics</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve given my whole life</p>
<p>to support American gymnastics.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve spent all these years preparing for this.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a crushing blow not to be able to do this</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t wanna be 100 feet high in the air</p>
<p>and discover a can&rsquo;t flip and break my neck.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s trying to unionize that issue</p>
<p>and get it across in palpable ways</p>
<p>that people can relate to in their own lives.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>look, all some people wanna do</p>
<p>is when they beat other countries in the Olympics</p>
<p>so we can brag about it,</p>
<p>but there are larger issues, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just being able to make that case,</p>
<p>which was difficult at first with Simone</p>
<p>because it was just happening</p>
<p>and she didn&rsquo;t know that she&rsquo;d be unable to perform.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have any lead time.</p>
<p>But in the best of all worlds,</p>
<p>you could have started drawing that</p>
<p>out of her ahead of time</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;d have some notice.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[John] Okay, thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greetings, Mr. Steinberg, I am Wycliffe Florizel,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>a one-year professional MBA candidate</p>
<p>currently studying</p>
<p>at the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University.</p>
<p>So, you have a vision of treating mental health</p>
<p>like any other form of health</p>
<p>but I think mental health is a little different</p>
<p>from any other form of health.</p>
<p>Like for example, like if I&rsquo;m bleeding</p>
<p>or if I break a bone,</p>
<p>like I know I have to go to the doctor,</p>
<p>so my question to you is where do we draw the line</p>
<p>between someone who needs help from a mental standpoint</p>
<p>and someone who is actually mentally healthy?</p>
<ul>
<li>So, what&rsquo;s that last distinction?</li>
</ul>
<p>Where do you draw the line what?</p>
<ul>
<li>Between, can you read? - So,</li>
</ul>
<p>where do we draw the line</p>
<p>between someone who actually needs help</p>
<p>from a mental standpoint</p>
<p>versus someone who actually is mentally healthy?</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe the question is,</li>
</ul>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to ask,</p>
<p>and correct me if I&rsquo;m misinterpreting here,</p>
<p>but where&rsquo;s that line drawn</p>
<p>determining when somebody needs help</p>
<p>with their mental health</p>
<p>versus is there even a mentally healthy?</p>
<p>Is that fair?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a fair way to put it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Songwen] Okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So some would argue</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all mentally unhealthy in this society</p>
<p>and especially after last year of the pandemic,</p>
<p>I would leave that up to the professionals.</p>
<p>So I would call into, you know, a psychologist</p>
<p>or someone else and get a second opinion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a lay psychologist but not a real one.</p>
<p>So you really have to go to the experts</p>
<p>to draw the line.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s enough that it&rsquo;s troubling them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re talking about it, then it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>And remember the thing about mental health</p>
<p>is everyone has amazing sympathy</p>
<p>for someone wearing a cast, right?</p>
<p>Oh my God, you broke your arm, oh my God, this,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t see mental illness</p>
<p>except if someone&rsquo;s walking down Telegraph Avenue</p>
<p>talking in tongues or something,</p>
<p>I mean, you can identify</p>
<p>that there are people walking around on streets</p>
<p>that have a problem,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna have to rely on the experts.</p>
<p>And, you know, my point is first don&rsquo;t do any harms.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d ask an expert.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Wyclef] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Leigh, my name is J.P.,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a first year MBA student.</p>
<p>So since you started your career,</p>
<p>the NFL has changed pretty dramatically</p>
<p>but you stuck around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very impressed by your longevity.</p>
<p>Can you talk about some of the principles you&rsquo;ve carried</p>
<p>through your career</p>
<p>that have allowed you to sustain your success?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, the first thing I tell people to do</li>
</ul>
<p>is an internal inventory of what values are most important.</p>
<p>So how does short-term economic gain feature in your life</p>
<p>or long-term economic security or the ability or family</p>
<p>or geographical location or autonomy</p>
<p>or, you know, making a difference in the world or whatever?</p>
<p>So if you have clarity as to what your own values are,</p>
<p>the most consistent theme is helping people.</p>
<p>So it was clear to me I could do that in two ways.</p>
<p>I could stimulate the best values in people</p>
<p>but all I&rsquo;m doing is inheriting usually the parents work</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve done such a great job.</p>
<p>And the second is what together can we do</p>
<p>to make an impact in the world,</p>
<p>like the Sporting Green Alliance</p>
<p>or whatever we&rsquo;ve taken on?</p>
<p>And what has always saved me is resilience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s life will knock you back,</p>
<p>it knocks all of us back.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna succeed in everything,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have untoward circumstances has happened,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s human to get destabilized a little bit,</p>
<p>but, you know, I&rsquo;m the guy who,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a barn filled with horse poop, defecation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a pony in there somewhere,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be there somewhere, you know.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a sense of optimism and not giving up</p>
<p>in the face that the world didn&rsquo;t change totally,</p>
<p>notwithstanding our best efforts</p>
<p>as I couldn&rsquo;t totally do it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s feeling money&rsquo;s not a part of it.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>my father, if I came home and told him</p>
<p>that I did a contract for zillion dollars,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s great, I hope the player&rsquo;s happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if I told him that, you know, we just did a program</p>
<p>that helps inner city kids</p>
<p>or, you know, establish a police-community dialogue</p>
<p>that resulted in people being safer,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d throw his arms around me.</p>
<p>So the consistent principal</p>
<p>has been trying to make a difference in a positive way</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>And so,</p>
<p>I wrote a book on the art of negotiating</p>
<p>called &ldquo;Winning with Integrity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the whole key was when you watch human beings interact,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t establish a paradigm of cooperation,</p>
<p>then people will get locked into positions.</p>
<p>And when they get locked in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to get them out.</p>
<p>So the point is in human interaction</p>
<p>you have to find a way to establish trust</p>
<p>and the rest of it.</p>
<p>So my thing has been not to care about myself</p>
<p>but to care what I can do</p>
<p>to enhance other people&rsquo;s lives, I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[J.P.] All right, thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience claps)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, my name is Michael.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a PhD student in statistics</p>
<p>in the East Coast at Duke University.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more of an NBA junkie myself.</p>
<p>In the past few years</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been a lot of all-star level players</p>
<p>who have spoken out about mental health struggles,</p>
<p>Kevin Love, DeMar DeRozan,</p>
<p>and most recently there&rsquo;s been a lot of media attention</p>
<p>on the Philadelphia 76ers with Ben Simmons</p>
<p>and the recent mental health struggles</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s been going through.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this prevailing sentiment within the media</p>
<p>and maybe popular culture</p>
<p>that maybe he&rsquo;s almost like faking some of his issues</p>
<p>or the Philadelphia 76ers</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t doing enough to support him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two sides of the issue.</p>
<p>My question for you</p>
<p>is how do teams balance providing mental health resources</p>
<p>for athletes and being understanding</p>
<p>of their personal situations</p>
<p>in the backdrop of million dollar contracts,</p>
<p>billion dollar TV deals,</p>
<p>how do they strike the right balance in doing this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I think the key</p>
<p>is introspection at the beginning of a career,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clarity as to who they are and what their goals are,</p>
<p>and just surrounding themselves</p>
<p>with people who will tell them the truth, okay?</p>
<p>So if an athlete</p>
<p>was up on a 90-story building on the ledge</p>
<p>and he was about to jump,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be surrounded by sycophants and toadies and posses</p>
<p>and other people would say,</p>
<p>law of gravity doesn&rsquo;t apply to you.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re the man, go ahead</p>
<p>and, you know, you can fly.</p>
<p>So the harder part in working with athletes</p>
<p>is just telling them the truth,</p>
<p>is being willing to and to pound them over the head</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t let them be oblivious to what they&rsquo;re facing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to have the courage in that relationship</p>
<p>to actually help the person</p>
<p>not just worry about, would they fire you</p>
<p>or would they be angry</p>
<p>if you suggested that they could use some counseling</p>
<p>or some help?</p>
<p>And so,</p>
<p>again, like I said, self-absorption&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>And if you can bring someone out of that,</p>
<p>my players are gonna,</p>
<p>except if your name is Tom Brady,</p>
<p>are gonna have their career over in their 30s,</p>
<p>some of them earlier.</p>
<p>So the question is, what else are your skills?</p>
<p>What else are your talents?</p>
<p>And moreover, if you substitute newspaper clippings</p>
<p>and profile and material things</p>
<p>for any inner spiritual sense or any way of being balanced,</p>
<p>those whole fade, newspaper clippings fade, fame fades.</p>
<p>One of the problems that athletes have in second career</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re used to structure.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re used to being told</p>
<p>this is what you&rsquo;re doing this hour, this hour, this hour,</p>
<p>this is what you&rsquo;re doing in the calendar.</p>
<p>You know, follow your itinerary.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re used to structure</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re surrounded by comradery,</p>
<p>man to brothers and sisters, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And so all of a sudden they get divorced from that.</p>
<p>They have no structure unless you&rsquo;ve preplanned with them.</p>
<p>They have no structure</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not surrounded every day by this group of people</p>
<p>that they believe will cover their derriere, right?</p>
<p>So balance is critical and you have to be willing,</p>
<p>you know when they say speak truth to power,</p>
<p>you have to be willing to speak truth to clients</p>
<p>if you really have a fiduciary responsibility to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Michael] Well said, thank you so much for your answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Ann] I think we have time for one more question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, thank you, Ann.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Leigh, thank you for being here.</p>
<p>My name is Bill, I&rsquo;m a member of the faculty here at Haas.</p>
<p>And you talked about NILs for college athletes</p>
<p>and even high school athletes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious to know your thoughts on overtime elites</p>
<p>and other programs like it</p>
<p>that are basically recruiting high school athletes</p>
<p>and turning them pro.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m interested to know your thoughts</p>
<p>on what it does for your business</p>
<p>but also for you personally,</p>
<p>do you see yourself sitting in the living room</p>
<p>of a 16-year-old athlete</p>
<p>talking to his or her parents in the future?</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you- - The question is,</li>
</ul>
<p>as opportunities come to younger and younger athletes,</p>
<p>will sports agents soon be sitting in the living rooms</p>
<p>of 16-year-olds athletes?</p>
<ul>
<li>So generally that relationship happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see myself doing that.</p>
<p>I mean, the beauty of the clients I have is the, you know,</p>
<p>when you go to college,</p>
<p>you may argue that athletes didn&rsquo;t take the same courses,</p>
<p>they did this, but I am telling you,</p>
<p>your average football player</p>
<p>was on a college campus exposed to different things.</p>
<p>And they are reasonably sophisticated, okay?</p>
<p>Compared to a player who comes out of high school</p>
<p>and goes into the minor leagues.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t see myself being involved with that</p>
<p>except if it was Olympic athlete,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re just competing in the deal.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a hard,</p>
<p>generally the way that the fortunate athletes</p>
<p>have their parents involved as screeners.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not really talking to the athlete,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking to the parents or to a third party</p>
<p>and that to me,</p>
<p>so I may never talk to a college football player</p>
<p>until he&rsquo;s ended this last season</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just talking to the parents.</p>
<p>And so representing Tua Tagovailoa,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to his parents.</p>
<p>So that I&rsquo;m okay to do,</p>
<p>you know, again, if a 16-year-old gymnast came to me</p>
<p>and was gonna be in that profile anywhere, I could see it,</p>
<p>but the rest of it, it&rsquo;s just too young.</p>
<p>And plus I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re great candidates</p>
<p>for role modeling and all the rest of it quite yet.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t lived enough life to be telling other people.</p>
<p>So, NILs are all over the country.</p>
<p>They thought it was gonna be just the stars but it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s whole schools</p>
<p>and alums are using it to use their businesses,</p>
<p>like Phil Knight, to enrich an entire program, right?</p>
<p>So alums own a business,</p>
<p>the business signs a bunch of players to NILs,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden they&rsquo;ve re-energized their program.</p>
<p>And programs are using that in recruiting.</p>
<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d see the day that Nick Saban,</p>
<p>a very conservative University of Alabama football coach,</p>
<p>would say of his unproven, untested freshmen quarterback,</p>
<p>that normally he would keep expectations down for, okay?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna put more pressure on this.</p>
<p>And he came out in a press conference and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bryce Young has signed a million dollars worth of deals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In what alternative did Nick more often dissent?</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s recruiting, is what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying, you come to Alabama</p>
<p>you can make a million dollar.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be part of that.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ll give you an example,</p>
<p>the first two years of Patrick Mahomes career,</p>
<p>we did virtually no marketing deals.</p>
<p>We wanted to prove to the people of Kansas City</p>
<p>that the engine that pulls the train is performance</p>
<p>and allows it&rsquo;s courage to develop.</p>
<p>And so I didn&rsquo;t take Bryce Young as a client.</p>
<p>I thought he was too young.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Bill] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you to Songwen, thank you to Leigh.</p>
<p>(audience claps)</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
<p>If there are any questions,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Leigh will be willing to talk to you afterwards</p>
<p>for a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Leigh, we really appreciate you going beyond yourself</p>
<p>and sharing your experiences with us.</p>
<p>We feel very, very honored today.</p>
<p>Thank you again.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Leigh] Thank you.</li>
