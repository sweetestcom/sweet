<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>this is the dr. Berg show live from the</p>
<p>nation&rsquo;s capital it&rsquo;s time to get</p>
<p>healthy lose weight and feel great call</p>
<p>now to speak with dr. Berg at eight six</p>
<p>six five six one four two nine two and</p>
<p>now dr. Eric Berg</p>
<p>hey guys it&rsquo;s Friday and now it&rsquo;s 11</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock so we can actually catch up with</p>
<p>some of the people in California so you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have to get up too early</p>
<p>hopefully you&rsquo;re good with that but if</p>
<p>you want to call in but I will take your</p>
<p>calls at eight six six five six one four</p>
<p>two nine two and we have Karen here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be checking social media</p>
<p>for your questions so we&rsquo;re gonna take</p>
<p>the first caller from Fort Lauderdale</p>
<p>gilma go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air come on</p>
<p>in dr. bird voice let me tell you how</p>
<p>much I appreciate you I lost about 30</p>
<p>pounds on the ketogenic diet fifty years</p>
<p>old and now I thought I was never gonna</p>
<p>be sized to again so I&rsquo;m doing wonderful</p>
<p>but I ran into a few bumps in the road</p>
<p>and one of them is paradox right I read</p>
<p>somewhere that saturated fat would cause</p>
<p>kara I was wondering if I should get the</p>
<p>surgery or yeah good question so let me</p>
<p>just answer that cataracts are usually</p>
<p>stemming from a severe b1 deficiency and</p>
<p>b1 deficiencies occur when you consume a</p>
<p>lot of carbs if you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance so before you get surgery and</p>
<p>by the way I&rsquo;m not recommending any</p>
<p>medical advice just I&rsquo;m just giving you</p>
<p>information to think listen to your own</p>
<p>research but the point is that you may</p>
<p>want to try consuming a lot more b1</p>
<p>right now to see if that condition</p>
<p>improves I&rsquo;m not saying it will but it</p>
<p>might but give the nutritional yeast</p>
<p>unfortified to do that and see if that</p>
<p>can help you but that&rsquo;s really what I</p>
<p>would do it&rsquo;s vitamin b1 in the complex</p>
<p>nutritional yeast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good question though hate one</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from New York City had a question</p>
<p>about cholesterol yes hi good morning</p>
<p>thank you so much what you do and thank</p>
<p>you for educating us I always had high</p>
<p>cholesterol and the numbers of 240 never</p>
<p>followed</p>
<p>diet I followed your program for four</p>
<p>months I do it in a minute fasting along</p>
<p>with the keto diet I&rsquo;ve been doing it</p>
<p>for four months lost 26 pounds I went to</p>
<p>a cardiologist and had my blood drawn</p>
<p>and my cholesterol went up to 3:18 and</p>
<p>what they want to do is they want to put</p>
<p>me on the cholesterol drug pop up mm-hmm</p>
<p>is that something that happens with diet</p>
<p>where your cholesterol tends to go well</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been far I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following the ketogenic diet exactly how</p>
<p>you have Taurus - right good question</p>
<p>can you tell me what your triglycerides</p>
<p>are and also LDL and HDL is that</p>
<p>out-of-control or just a total</p>
<p>cholesterol that&rsquo;s total cholesterol my</p>
<p>VLDL is 16 my triglycerides is 114 okay</p>
<p>and my H LDL is 45 okay all right so a</p>
<p>couple things the other thing I would go</p>
<p>get measured is your a1c because that if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming down too close to like</p>
<p>five point five five then you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>really good shape because here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing your fat cells have are composed</p>
<p>of triglycerides and cholesterol so when</p>
<p>you are in fat burn and guess what that</p>
<p>has to be mobilized in release from the</p>
<p>fat cell so all that fat has to come out</p>
<p>through the fat cell through your blood</p>
<p>do you liver and of course your your</p>
<p>cholesterol is going to spike</p>
<p>temporarily happens with everyone</p>
<p>because you have to get the cholesterol</p>
<p>out and that&rsquo;s why one of the problems</p>
<p>with going on the keto is that some</p>
<p>people can get a fatty liver because the</p>
<p>mobile ace mobilization of fat and</p>
<p>cholesterol comes out if they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>consuming enough vegetables so as long</p>
<p>as your vegetables are high and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing outside of vinegar and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing any sugars I would give it more</p>
<p>time because it has to come out it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to come</p>
<p>see your body makes a lot of cholesterol</p>
<p>it makes about 3,000 milligrams that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty much 90% of all the cholesterol</p>
<p>your body is made by your body only 10%</p>
<p>comes from the diet so we need</p>
<p>cholesterol throw it for the vision for</p>
<p>the skin for the brain for the nervous</p>
<p>system for your hormones so the real</p>
<p>problem is not the cholesterol it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>arteries that are damaged that then the</p>
<p>cholesterol comes and starts sticking on</p>
<p>the wall that&rsquo;s what the damage is and</p>
<p>that comes from insulin resistance so</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>correcting insulin resistance you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>healing make sure you do intermittent</p>
<p>fasting spike the vegetables and I would</p>
<p>get it reevaluated in a month and then</p>
<p>another month and see if it gets</p>
<p>improved but it will start coming down</p>
<p>this happens just just with everyone and</p>
<p>then watch my videos on cholesterol</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;d be very important</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m glad you brought that up one all</p>
<p>right Karen let&rsquo;s go to you you have any</p>
<p>questions today yes I have a great</p>
<p>question on how keto diet can help</p>
<p>someone with an eating disorder okay</p>
<p>good so let&rsquo;s talk let&rsquo;s answer that</p>
<p>when you have anorexic anorexia bulimia</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bulimic obviously you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>usually you&rsquo;re going to be binging on</p>
<p>carbs and then you&rsquo;re going to be you</p>
<p>know getting rid of the carbs and that</p>
<p>creates a tremendous amount of stress on</p>
<p>the liver it&rsquo;s very damaging and I guess</p>
<p>the the purpose is to lose weight which</p>
<p>never works when you&rsquo;re doing the carbs</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to do this so honestly</p>
<p>I would greatly advise that person to do</p>
<p>the keto in a minute fasting to the</p>
<p>point where you&rsquo;re doing at two meals</p>
<p>because once you actually get into true</p>
<p>fat-burning your brain is going to</p>
<p>function so much better and it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to actually your mood your cognitive and</p>
<p>your mood is going to come up and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help you cope with with those</p>
<p>impulses a lot better than running on</p>
<p>the blood Sugar&rsquo;s which is up and down</p>
<p>so you actually experience a lot less</p>
<p>stress the brain will be under a lot</p>
<p>less stress and you&rsquo;ll actually feel</p>
<p>better overall and also you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll be able to control your</p>
<p>own metabolism</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s gonna happen over time</p>
<p>that condition is going to slow your</p>
<p>metabolism to the point where no matter</p>
<p>what you do you just keep gaining weight</p>
<p>so yes I would highly recommend it but</p>
<p>do it healthily make sure you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>your nutrients and cut the carbs out all</p>
<p>right is that sufficient that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s great you just gave me the</p>
<p>floor so I&rsquo;m gonna give you another one</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna okay what about</p>
<p>vertigo and the keto diet yeah vertigo</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re dizzy it really depends</p>
<p>if you get up fast and you&rsquo;re dizzy</p>
<p>versus you&rsquo;re dizzy all the time if you</p>
<p>get up fast and you&rsquo;re disoriented or</p>
<p>you actually get dizzy that is an</p>
<p>adrenal weakness because the blood</p>
<p>pressure is not adapting to the</p>
<p>positional change like there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>enough blood and oxygen to your brain so</p>
<p>it takes a little bit to reset so if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem you need to support</p>
<p>the adrenal glands I have a lot of</p>
<p>videos on what to do with that but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s adrenal but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dizzy all the time and it has nothing to</p>
<p>do with going or flight of stairs or</p>
<p>standing up quickly that uses the mucus</p>
<p>on the inside of the ear coming from</p>
<p>either something you&rsquo;re eating that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allergic to or some type of sinus</p>
<p>issue in the inner ear I have another</p>
<p>video on that as well two remedies for</p>
<p>that would be oregano oil you can take</p>
<p>it orally and also put a drop with</p>
<p>garlic in the ear itself each day and</p>
<p>that will actually help any type of like</p>
<p>you know extra growth of Micra microbes</p>
<p>that are in there and also in any pot</p>
<p>with salt would be really good as well</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s take a question from our</p>
<p>lien you&rsquo;re from Delaware you had a</p>
<p>question about your test results and the</p>
<p>sleet your sleep aid or sleep aid yes</p>
<p>how are you great</p>
<p>thanks I&rsquo;m talking to you every week</p>
<p>yeah I got my my lab tests from urine</p>
<p>tests and says that my it says keidel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two-plus abnormal what does that mean</p>
<p>well that means that you have you have</p>
<p>ketones in your urine you&rsquo;re doing urine</p>
<p>right or blood that was urine yeah I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing both I have a question on the</p>
<p>blood one too but the urine one says</p>
<ul>
<li>plus abnormal and then my blood work</li>
</ul>
<p>is ast it says eleven which says low and</p>
<p>then it says AG ratio which is 0.9 and</p>
<p>that says low and I don&rsquo;t know what this</p>
<p>is this is neutrophils yeah and that one</p>
<p>is really high seven seventy five point</p>
<p>two and the lymphocyte site is mm-hmm</p>
<p>that fourteen point nine and then they</p>
<p>say that&rsquo;s low and I did have breast</p>
<p>cancer those that have anything to do</p>
<p>with camp well let me let me just answer</p>
<p>that Arlene when we&rsquo;re evaluating your</p>
<p>blood on the air is probably going to be</p>
<p>a more in-depth conversation I need to</p>
<p>get your history and all that but just</p>
<p>in general when you have two two plus</p>
<p>ketones in your urine that means you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in ketosis if you don&rsquo;t have ketones in</p>
<p>your blood that could be near your</p>
<p>utilize them as fuel but I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>you actually had your ketones tester in</p>
<p>your blood I think they checked it other</p>
<p>other things neutrophils could mean</p>
<p>several things number one it could be</p>
<p>weak adrenals it could be an infection</p>
<p>it could be a low immune system if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not experiencing those symptoms</p>
<p>then I think it&rsquo;s probably adrenal</p>
<p>issues that you need to check out and</p>
<p>start to kind of read up on that</p>
<p>neutrophils are white blood cells and so</p>
<p>what happens the adrenal hormone called</p>
<p>cortisol tends to suppress the white</p>
<p>blood cells and neutrophils</p>
<p>the neutrophils go go in there and they</p>
<p>eat up and they dismantle microbes bad</p>
<p>microbes so when actually if it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>high it&rsquo;s overreacting and it could be</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have enough of during</p>
<p>a hormone so it&rsquo;s going high it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>low you can have too much adrenal</p>
<p>hormone so it&rsquo;s a little confusing and I</p>
<p>think for that question might be good</p>
<p>just to get a whole history and maybe</p>
<p>send into my office and so we can</p>
<p>evaluate that but let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s take</p>
<p>another question because we have a lot</p>
<p>of people that are calling in right now</p>
<p>Zoe F you&rsquo;re from Puerto Rico go ahead</p>
<p>you had a question yeah good good</p>
<p>evening dr. Berg I was wondering I&rsquo;m me</p>
<p>and my wife we&rsquo;re professional athletes</p>
<p>and we</p>
<p>are having any mind to compete probably</p>
<p>next year and a bodybuilding competition</p>
<p>and absolutely it&rsquo;s two questions that</p>
<p>was we were wondering if we can use the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet to you know lower our</p>
<p>body fat levels to essential fat you</p>
<p>know competition level and also our my</p>
<p>second question it would be if we can</p>
<p>use the ketogenic diet to help us create</p>
<p>more stamina and hit training exercises</p>
<p>oh good good question</p>
<p>hands down it is the best thing to do</p>
<p>for losing weight becoming lean way</p>
<p>better than the carbo-loading you may</p>
<p>need to adjust your fats a little bit</p>
<p>lower right during the competition but</p>
<p>overall it&rsquo;s the best ways the</p>
<p>healthiest way to do this so many</p>
<p>bodybuilders end up with issues and</p>
<p>problems down the road because they you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very very it&rsquo;s the cyclic</p>
<p>carb loading and then you&rsquo;re working out</p>
<p>in the stress it really can throw off</p>
<p>your hormones especially growth hormone</p>
<p>and affect your muscle density but</p>
<p>intermittent fasting will preserve your</p>
<p>proteins and your muscle so it&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>what you need to do and as far as</p>
<p>performance and endurance and stamina oh</p>
<p>my gosh you&rsquo;re gonna have way more</p>
<p>energy running your body at that feel</p>
<p>gives you way more energy than run your</p>
<p>bio and glucose I mean you have an</p>
<p>average non obese person has about</p>
<p>70,000 calories of that to run on and</p>
<p>you only have about 1,700 calories of</p>
<p>glucose that are stored to run and so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see hmm which one would be better</p>
<p>total ketosis I would jump into that</p>
<p>right away and I think you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have the unfair advantage of dominating</p>
<p>your competition good do we have any</p>
<p>questions Karen coming in yes yes I</p>
<p>reserve the right to ask several here so</p>
<p>one all that we addressed every single</p>
<p>week and I know there are videos on this</p>
<p>you have videos on it but hair loss</p>
<p>during keto okay always get a flurry of</p>
<p>questions on that so you can address</p>
<p>that and come back okay so hair loss if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing keto and all of a sudden</p>
<p>you get your hair is falling out that</p>
<p>usually is a B vitamin if</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t see ok it&rsquo;s B vitamin</p>
<p>deficiency you use more B vitamins when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the ketogenic diet that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I recommend taking nutritional yeast or</p>
<p>nutritional these tablets and so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all you need to do is add the B vitamins</p>
<p>in there and that should stop it like</p>
<p>that ok that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>happen there&rsquo;s no other I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty much gonna work about a hundred</p>
<p>percent of time but yous need more B</p>
<p>vitamins but is there a magic formula is</p>
<p>there another mad a secret you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>telling us oh you mean related you want</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s more for the advanced people</p>
<p>or know that that&rsquo;s more for the</p>
<p>advanced show after we do this the</p>
<p>second show I get into the advanced</p>
<p>things and the secrets the secrets okay</p>
<p>okay good now here&rsquo;s another good</p>
<p>question is what about keto for memory</p>
<p>loss or these other issues like dementia</p>
<p>related I just forgot about that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>yeah keto for memory loss and cognitive</p>
<p>function oh my god it&rsquo;s incredible why</p>
<p>because first of all your brain loves</p>
<p>ketones and secondly when you do in a</p>
<p>minute fasting with that and you cut</p>
<p>your carbs down you actually can improve</p>
<p>dementia and Parkinson&rsquo;s symptoms and</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s symptoms why because this</p>
<p>eating plan is neuroprotective in other</p>
<p>words it protects the loss of brain</p>
<p>cells so you can actually regenerate</p>
<p>brain cells you can get more brain new</p>
<p>brain cells who wouldn&rsquo;t want an extra</p>
<p>brain cell here and there I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beneficial looking for new brain cells</p>
<p>not only that in a minute fasting and</p>
<p>the etaf adji that&rsquo;s the word that talks</p>
<p>about your cells being a self-cleaning</p>
<p>oven they actually can clean up and</p>
<p>recycle and clean itself up and so when</p>
<p>it does that guess what that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>neuro protective as well so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually growing new brain tissue back</p>
<p>so some people could actually benefit</p>
<p>from that more than others good so in</p>
<p>addition to saying I&rsquo;m cleaning my oven</p>
<p>I can say I&rsquo;m cleaning my breath oh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re cleaning your you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>self-cleaning oven of your brain cells</p>
<p>and getting the junk I&rsquo;ll let Ron</p>
<p>okay good good see I want to let no no I</p>
<p>have to let people on Facebook no</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s changed with a keto</p>
<p>course it&rsquo;s changed this week to make it</p>
<p>even easier so anybody that makes a</p>
<p>comment on Facebook if you&rsquo;ve never made</p>
<p>a comment before you will automatically</p>
<p>get an invitation for the keto course</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a free course it&rsquo;s three simple</p>
<p>videos everyone needs to take it and the</p>
<p>reason why I put it out there is so</p>
<p>everyone gets the basics because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you need to start with is the</p>
<p>simple basics just sign up take the</p>
<p>course yeah yeah okay good now can I go</p>
<p>to the next person I wish you would</p>
<p>answer the phone okay so Nancy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from New Jersey you had a question about</p>
<p>several things go ahead hi yes hi dr.</p>
<p>Bergen Karen thank you for taking my</p>
<p>fall I have a 55 year old male here who</p>
<p>happened let me answer jury done it in</p>
<p>quote unquote take it was apparently</p>
<p>removed and then he found another</p>
<p>physician that was willing to do the</p>
<p>bypass</p>
<p>he had the bypass Don he&rsquo;s lost way too</p>
<p>much weight he would like to gain more</p>
<p>weight and seem like he can&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>recently was admitted to the hospital</p>
<p>football obstruction he&rsquo;s got enlarged</p>
<p>prostate and anemia and no muscle tone</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also room for concern that he</p>
<p>may have some abdominal scar tissue</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s number one number two is in</p>
<p>regards to myself I have a theme bar</p>
<p>high pole acting level I&rsquo;m about 40</p>
<p>pounds overweight and it my menstrual</p>
<p>cycle is very intimate and although I</p>
<p>had a very high stress my loss my father</p>
<p>on Sunday will be a year so I get I</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t get my period for maybe three or</p>
<p>four months and then I&rsquo;d get it and then</p>
<p>I get it in two more weeks and then</p>
<p>another week and then I won&rsquo;t get it for</p>
<p>another several months what&rsquo;s your age</p>
<p>Nancy I&rsquo;m 151 and then yeah as far as</p>
<p>your husband goes</p>
<p>he had bariatric surgery right yeah and</p>
<p>did you say that they were tried to</p>
<p>reverse it apparently this is before I</p>
<p>even met him but he has a Batman quote</p>
<p>unquote as in his words it didn&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>no they went back in and was a postive</p>
<p>removed the Lap Band</p>
<p>and then when they moved it and he found</p>
<p>another physician was really to go back</p>
<p>in and do the bypass and when that</p>
<p>physician woman&rsquo;s at the bypass he told</p>
<p>him that they never actually removed a</p>
<p>lap and that it was kind of still</p>
<p>floating in his so here&rsquo;s the question</p>
<p>after you are either one of you doing</p>
<p>kind of some of the recommendations like</p>
<p>keto and intermittent yet yeah I I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>basically am he still eats like the</p>
<p>disease your bread and stuff like that</p>
<p>every so often because I really didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what else to do with him to help</p>
<p>him gain weight but now with this most</p>
<p>recent he was admitted to the hospital</p>
<p>in the on Thanksgiving for bowel</p>
<p>obstruction now I&rsquo;m wondering whether or</p>
<p>not he really should have any type of</p>
<p>carbs at all but he wants to gain weight</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m very confused</p>
<p>what they do with them all right so well</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;m sure in the</p>
<p>hospital he&rsquo;ll be eating some really</p>
<p>good food so that you know we can rule</p>
<p>that out</p>
<p>no just kidding here&rsquo;s the thing with</p>
<p>him I think I would focus a lot on in a</p>
<p>minute fasting with him because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to really heal anything going on</p>
<p>with the digestive system as far as</p>
<p>trying to gain weight with carbs it&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s going to send them backwards</p>
<p>I think what I would do is try to get</p>
<p>him healthy and work on his digestive</p>
<p>system because apparently was one of</p>
<p>trauma in there when you do bariatric</p>
<p>procedures you lose the the surface of</p>
<p>the absorption in your stomach or than a</p>
<p>small intestine so then you you be you</p>
<p>start losing bile and stomach acids and</p>
<p>you become anemic and then you have</p>
<p>problems with trace minerals and</p>
<p>proteins so I would I would I have a</p>
<p>video on that you should just watch that</p>
<p>on bariatric</p>
<p>surgery and Kido I would actually watch</p>
<p>that because that&rsquo;ll give you all the</p>
<p>data but I would put him on in a minute</p>
<p>fasting big time I think that would help</p>
<p>now is far far as your situation with I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a combination of stress and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s affecting your cycles course</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re 51 so you&rsquo;re going right into</p>
<p>that time where your ovaries are going</p>
<p>in retirement right now so doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>surprise me that you&rsquo;re not having your</p>
<p>period it&rsquo;s probably a natural</p>
<p>transition but for you I think what I</p>
<p>would do are the biggest thing is</p>
<p>support the adrenals so watch the videos</p>
<p>on supporting adrenals with certain</p>
<p>tweaks with food</p>
<p>physical acupressure techniques for your</p>
<p>adrenals long walks right now that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you need more than anything because</p>
<p>the adrenals are the back up to the</p>
<p>ovaries so you&rsquo;re right into that</p>
<p>menopausal where you need to support the</p>
<p>adrenals so that&rsquo;s what I would focus on</p>
<p>thanks thanks Nancy hey Brooke you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Tennessee you had a question about</p>
<p>allergies to bee stings yes good morning</p>
<p>I also had two more questions but what</p>
<p>causes people to be allergic to bee</p>
<p>stings and is there a way to stop the</p>
<p>reactions to that without getting some</p>
<p>kind of vaccine and what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>difference in fructose and high fructose</p>
<p>corn syrup and fruit is it just as bad</p>
<p>for you and does it matter what side you</p>
<p>lay on to take your blood pressure</p>
<p>really okay all right so so as far as</p>
<p>checking your blood sugar I&rsquo;m blood</p>
<p>pressure I would do it sitting and I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily on one side or the</p>
<p>other I would just do it sitting so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re neutral I mean you could be</p>
<p>laying down too but not on your side</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna affect the way the</p>
<p>heart is and the way the livers gonna</p>
<p>compress the heart as far as high</p>
<p>fructose corn syrup and fruit I just</p>
<p>released a video I&rsquo;m gonna suggest you</p>
<p>watch that but in thumbnail sketch fruit</p>
<p>has fiber and it has nutrients</p>
<p>high-fructose corn syrup has no fiber</p>
<p>and no nutrients and it&rsquo;s made of a corn</p>
<p>not fruit so I</p>
<p>just corn syrup is by far the worst</p>
<p>thing you can almost the worst thing you</p>
<p>can consume for trying to actually</p>
<p>turning into insulin resistance and</p>
<p>eventually diabetes because it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to go right to the liver create a fatty</p>
<p>liver and create all the issues but</p>
<p>believe it or not there is one thing in</p>
<p>addition to high fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>that I just I&rsquo;m gonna do a video on this</p>
<p>I found that actually will cause more</p>
<p>insulin resistance than hyper dose corn</p>
<p>syrup</p>
<p>can you take a wild guess Karen what</p>
<p>that could be say that it say that again</p>
<p>when I was reading I know what what is</p>
<p>worse than high fructose corn syrup as</p>
<p>far as causing insulin resistance I know</p>
<p>this high fructose corn syrup and</p>
<p>protein know like what what what else</p>
<p>would do would cause insulin resistance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s worse than consuming</p>
<p>high-fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>cotton candy okay well you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right yeah that&rsquo;s actually from</p>
<p>high fructose corn syrup that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>believe I only got one guess yeah you</p>
<p>only get one guess it&rsquo;s actually soy oil</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get the haters now well</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>a whole video and I was like I was like</p>
<p>the maize but then it made a lot of</p>
<p>sense because if you see day coincidence</p>
<p>with obesity and diabetes that goes up</p>
<p>right when they started making this oil</p>
<p>soy oil so is that why I think it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make sense I&rsquo;m thinking about</p>
<p>sugar well first of all no carbs it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not you throw in soy oil it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>genetically modified that means it is</p>
<p>glyphosate it has chemicals those</p>
<p>chemicals are bad for you okay that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one number two in summary those</p>
<p>chemicals are bad for you yeah I know</p>
<p>number two I appreciate that the omega-3</p>
<p>oils it&rsquo;s not omega-3 I&rsquo;m sorry omega-6</p>
<p>oils are very inflammatory so but I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the GMO stuff anyway let me</p>
<p>get back to Brookes question about</p>
<p>allergies bee stings why would you</p>
<p>develop an allergy that has to do with</p>
<p>something that kind of got into the</p>
<p>system and now your body is producing</p>
<p>anybody&rsquo;s what sets you up for allergies</p>
<p>is usually in a dream</p>
<p>weakness and so there had to been some</p>
<p>pre-existing adrenal weakness for you to</p>
<p>set up that allergy so that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s behind allergies now a couple</p>
<p>things that you can do to as it to</p>
<p>improve it as a remedy and this you can</p>
<p>search this out it&rsquo;s a standard</p>
<p>processed product look online it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called cow ammo count see al hey mo Cal</p>
<p>ammo and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a really it&rsquo;s calcium</p>
<p>chloride okay and it actually helps to</p>
<p>drop the pH a little bit and helps to</p>
<p>reduce histamine reaction especially bee</p>
<p>stings I think that was all your</p>
<p>questions but thanks for calling in hey</p>
<p>Kat you&rsquo;re from New York you had a</p>
<p>question about gall bladder formula hi</p>
<p>dr. Berg hi Karen</p>
<p>hi hi I just had a question a quick</p>
<p>question I know you have a lot of calls</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have my gall bladder anymore and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing keto since October 1st</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re at 2 months now and I&rsquo;ve only</p>
<p>lost 7 pounds so I just got your gall</p>
<p>bladder formula and I&rsquo;m just wondering</p>
<p>if your gall bladder formula will help</p>
<p>my body convert t3 to t4 okay good</p>
<p>question so what you need to do is find</p>
<p>out where they took your gall bladder</p>
<p>and get it back and just replace or get</p>
<p>it replaced now you can&rsquo;t do that now</p>
<p>what happens when they remove the</p>
<p>gallbladder that means that now you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a sack to concentrate the</p>
<p>bile as much so now you have a little</p>
<p>tube it goes from your liver down the</p>
<p>small intestine so it trickles down</p>
<p>there so we have a a weaker diluted less</p>
<p>amount of bile bile helps you extract</p>
<p>fat soluble nutrients and essential</p>
<p>fatty acids and a whole bunch of other</p>
<p>things so you&rsquo;re taking the gallbladder</p>
<p>formula which has bile in it which is</p>
<p>great I would take that after the meal</p>
<p>okay and also it&rsquo;ll give you more bile</p>
<p>which is needed to convert thyroid from</p>
<p>inactive t4 to t3 so it should actually</p>
<p>improve the thyroid function and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why when you have a client with hyper</p>
<p>thyroid they have too much thyroid</p>
<p>hormones you don&rsquo;t want to give them the</p>
<p>bio formula because they&rsquo;ll have it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make more hormone okay or more</p>
<p>activation of the hormones that</p>
<p>have alright and thanks for calling all</p>
<p>right Karen yeah I good I have some cool</p>
<p>questions here one is is eating meat</p>
<p>necessary on keto I can&rsquo;t eat cheese or</p>
<p>nuts so how do I get more protein okay</p>
<p>you know let me just get take that one</p>
<p>at a time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to do Kido without</p>
<p>doing animal proteins simply because</p>
<p>trying to get your b12 at about MMA and</p>
<p>most vegetarian proteins come with</p>
<p>carbohydrates that is the problem so</p>
<p>maybe you do eggs maybe you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>dairy and you can&rsquo;t do what what else no</p>
<p>no okay yeah yeah so maybe you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to do a little fish or seafood or</p>
<p>eggs that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna recommend</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t say they can&rsquo;t eat me</p>
<p>they just say is it necessary so I&rsquo;m no</p>
<p>clear it&rsquo;s necessary for the amino acid</p>
<p>what the reason why you need amino acids</p>
<p>or protein is because structurally you</p>
<p>have to replace your hair your nails</p>
<p>your joints your muscles okay so that</p>
<p>has to come somewhere and meat is the is</p>
<p>the most comprehensive source of</p>
<p>high-quality amino acids okay good</p>
<p>alright next question I was a liver</p>
<p>donor is that an issue terrible problem</p>
<p>losing weight no gallbladder okay</p>
<p>sadface exercise every day also been a</p>
<p>healthy eater and just started</p>
<p>intermittent fasting well I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing the right thing yes your liver</p>
<p>should come back it does grow back if</p>
<p>you have a little bit it keeps getting</p>
<p>bigger I don&rsquo;t think you have anything</p>
<p>to worry about but without a gallbladder</p>
<p>you might want to support it with the</p>
<p>gallbladder formula because now you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the bile and so and even if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a full liver then that means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to produce</p>
<p>enough by because this liver cells make</p>
<p>the bile so therefore adding that one</p>
<p>after a meal I think would be helpful</p>
<p>maybe start with just one meal a day as</p>
<p>far as taking that and then but the</p>
<p>intimate of fasting is going to be</p>
<p>awesome to help you get into aa fijian</p>
<p>to get your organs to work more</p>
<p>efficiently get your body as in a health</p>
<p>state</p>
<p>and help stimulate growth hormone which</p>
<p>actually will speed up the growth of</p>
<p>your liver and but she wants to also</p>
<p>know about losing weight</p>
<p>yeah well that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>happen is as your liver gets healthier</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna start losing more weight as</p>
<p>you get better digestion you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>lose more weight so in a minute fasting</p>
<p>in ketosis is the combination that you</p>
<p>need to help yourself lose weight okay</p>
<p>so now we&rsquo;re gonna take a call from</p>
<p>Amanda from Michigan go ahead hi yes I</p>
<p>had a question about my kids are I have</p>
<p>two questions actually one is can my</p>
<p>young kids have the wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>powder and electrolyte powder how old</p>
<p>are they um my daughter is three and my</p>
<p>son is one and I no of course not my</p>
<p>doses that I take right I was just</p>
<p>curious if they can have that Jill well</p>
<p>what I would do because they&rsquo;re because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re uh it&rsquo;s a food based thing and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a concentrate and there&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>trace minerals I would give them if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re that young probably 120 I mean</p>
<p>1/4 of what you would take in some water</p>
<p>and then that that way they&rsquo;re getting a</p>
<p>lot of nutrition so it&rsquo;s not harmful it</p>
<p>can be very beneficial yeah okay my</p>
<p>second question is actually for my</p>
<p>mother um it&rsquo;s kind of lengthy but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fifty years old and she was diagnosed</p>
<p>with 12 years ago with relapsing</p>
<p>remitting ms she also doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>gall bladder</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got 50% coated arteries but all</p>
<p>her cholesterol came back normal</p>
<p>okay and she also has long list but she</p>
<p>also has the arthritis and degenerative</p>
<p>spine and she they told her doctor told</p>
<p>her that&rsquo;s from taking so many of her</p>
<p>steroid treatments yeah and her main</p>
<p>question is she&rsquo;s also on fifty fifty</p>
<p>thousand I use a vitamin d3 she just</p>
<p>bought um your stress kit and your keto</p>
<p>kit gall bladder formula and the vitamin</p>
<p>d3 and cake tool okay then she overdosed</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s kind of at a loss because her</p>
<p>neurologist told her</p>
<p>that she used to recommend the keto diet</p>
<p>but then her patients starting to get</p>
<p>any like strokes so she recommend my mom</p>
<p>go on a very low-fat diet yeah she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of getting tossed back and forth</p>
<p>alright so let me just answer it okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m and this is this brings up several</p>
<p>key points ms is a autoimmune of the</p>
<p>nerve cells the absolute only thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to help her is going into</p>
<p>any a diet that gives neuroprotection or</p>
<p>nerve protection and that would be an</p>
<p>event fasting in ketosis okay that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>number one there is another diet you</p>
<p>should not do carbs for that at all</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to help MS a lot the second</p>
<p>thing is she has artery problems right</p>
<p>you said Harding of the arteries or a</p>
<p>blocked artery or something here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing if you look under insulin</p>
<p>resistance okay or let&rsquo;s just say high</p>
<p>insulin in the body</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called hyperinsulinemia okay high</p>
<p>insulin one of the big side effects is</p>
<p>the first side effect is it goes after</p>
<p>the arteries the circulation and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why it disrupts the wall of the vessels</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what brings in the</p>
<p>cholesterol that brings in to the</p>
<p>collagen to start creating the clot and</p>
<p>the stroking and the heart attack so</p>
<p>really all these things like stroke</p>
<p>heart attack</p>
<p>aneurysms really come from high insulin</p>
<p>which comes from insulin resistance okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it happens so what she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing is going to be very very good to</p>
<p>help reduce the risk of strokes and</p>
<p>heart attacks because it&rsquo;s gonna heal</p>
<p>the inside of that artery okay and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why with diabetics you get other</p>
<p>vascular problems in the eye the retina</p>
<p>the blood vessels in the eye and then</p>
<p>the kidney and the blood vessels to the</p>
<p>nerves and the fingertips and the toes</p>
<p>so absolutely hands down now you as far</p>
<p>as the nutrition you can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>overdose on the stuff that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>recommending because their food</p>
<p>concentrates they&rsquo;re not synthetic</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not high potency stuff I think I</p>
<p>would have a replace her regular d3 with</p>
<p>my k2 and d3 because she needs the k2 to</p>
<p>pull out the calcium out of the harsh</p>
<p>reefs and the joints for arthritis</p>
<p>but also this eating plan will be</p>
<p>wonderful for inflammation and arthritis</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what it does</p>
<p>thanks Amanda Amanda I&rsquo;m sorry all right</p>
<p>Karen you&rsquo;re next</p>
<p>okay good so first of all people love</p>
<p>you and everybody&rsquo;s saying I love them</p>
<p>too okay good so here&rsquo;s a question about</p>
<p>chronic fatigue yeah yeah talk about</p>
<p>that okay well first of all chronic</p>
<p>fatigue is a symptom don&rsquo;t ever treat it</p>
<p>with the remedy I had a chronic fatigue</p>
<p>and I was trying to find a vitamin</p>
<p>increase my energy it&rsquo;s a symptom so the</p>
<p>last thing I do is start treating it you</p>
<p>want to find out what&rsquo;s underneath it</p>
<p>the first thing to look at is sleep are</p>
<p>you sleeping let&rsquo;s say you are sleeping</p>
<p>how was the quality of sleep is that</p>
<p>good or bad</p>
<p>it could suck so that&rsquo;s what you want to</p>
<p>fix so you want to support it sleep</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t mince words dr. Berger just say it</p>
<p>my sleep sucked okay so what happens is</p>
<p>what causes sleep problems is several</p>
<p>things one is your bladder at night</p>
<p>which is instant resistance it could be</p>
<p>stress from the adrenal it could also be</p>
<p>slept sleep apnea because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>breathing at night so all these things</p>
<p>need to be looked at to find the</p>
<p>underlying reason but let&rsquo;s say for</p>
<p>example Karen yeah that your sleep is</p>
<p>okay and you still have chronic fatigue</p>
<p>syndrome Ben what there&rsquo;s two things</p>
<p>that I found it could be epstein-barr</p>
<p>virus which is sitting in the background</p>
<p>hanging out being reactivated during</p>
<p>times of stress what&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s a virus</p>
<p>that happens that it kind of goes into</p>
<p>the tonsils usually you get it from in</p>
<p>high school where your tonsils swell up</p>
<p>like mono and so then years later it</p>
<p>gets reactivated not as an infection it</p>
<p>comes out of remission as a chronic</p>
<p>fatigue syndrome because you&rsquo;re under</p>
<p>stress and stress is the trigger that</p>
<p>brings that out of remission or part of</p>
<p>it anyway now this might sound weird</p>
<p>this might sound like it&rsquo;s hard to make</p>
<p>sense but there&rsquo;s great acupressure</p>
<p>technique that you can do for improving</p>
<p>circulation and immune system function</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s use them in my massage tool I</p>
<p>may have a video on this that sounds</p>
<p>weird I know but it works so you put it</p>
<p>in the back of the neck right underneath</p>
<p>the skull and you lay</p>
<p>back on your couch and I&rsquo;ve used this</p>
<p>technique so many times in the past and</p>
<p>I wish I would have filmed it because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the person goes from fatigue</p>
<p>to all of a sudden they just perk right</p>
<p>up because it increases the circulation</p>
<p>apparently those nerve points that you</p>
<p>trigger are very beneficial so pick down</p>
<p>YouTube you can type epstein-barr virus</p>
<p>or no chronic fatigue syndrome and watch</p>
<p>that video so that that will help you</p>
<p>with that and the other thing believe it</p>
<p>or not is the gall bladder sometimes</p>
<p>kinky can get congested and that can</p>
<p>actually really suck your energy so</p>
<p>watch some videos on that to see if you</p>
<p>can see if that&rsquo;s your problem all right</p>
<p>Deena you&rsquo;re from Arizona you had a</p>
<p>question go ahead hi happy holidays</p>
<p>you too thank you I wanted to know what</p>
<p>your thoughts were on hit training as</p>
<p>far as something like insanity yeah I am</p>
<p>35 years old 150 pounds I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>staying at this weight since this summer</p>
<p>I would say since about July or August</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing great so far as far as</p>
<p>getting on keto actually doing in a</p>
<p>minute fasting I&rsquo;ve been doing actually</p>
<p>the past four days so did terrible ever</p>
<p>since given bone broth bone broth and a</p>
<p>kale shake along with the beet roots</p>
<p>everything kind of explained before and</p>
<p>doing my apple cider vinegar so I wanted</p>
<p>your thoughts on oh here&rsquo;s another thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if my metabolism has</p>
<p>slowed because I was once on tend I met</p>
<p>regime I would say this was on it for</p>
<p>about almost a year and I lost of course</p>
<p>a lot of weight I was at 125 pounds then</p>
<p>once I stopped is obviously didn&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>it anymore</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that now it was easier to</p>
<p>gain weight I went through stressful</p>
<p>times and you know life happened so this</p>
<p>is where I&rsquo;m at yeah I feel like my</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s and the tabal ISM has changed and</p>
<p>it needs a bit of hard core something</p>
<p>right question I have for you as far as</p>
<p>when you work out when you do inclines</p>
<p>you does your legs get heavier</p>
<p>mm not to not to because I feel like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing really good on my I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done a lot of the vitamins that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>talked about like the seek help the</p>
<p>nutritional yeast I&rsquo;ve been doing I</p>
<p>think Oh the potassium good good what</p>
<p>about when you work out does it can you</p>
<p>recover faster as it takes several days</p>
<p>to bounce back hmm I would say I need</p>
<p>like a day a day or two okay</p>
<p>and how was your sleep oh my gosh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotten so much better it was really bad</p>
<p>again over the summer like I mentioned</p>
<p>when I gained my weight it was terrible</p>
<p>stress they&rsquo;ve been taking like an</p>
<p>adrenal support to kind of help calm</p>
<p>down my cortisol yeah I can tell the</p>
<p>difference my sleep is a whole lot</p>
<p>better it&rsquo;s improved right just recently</p>
<p>okay well let&rsquo;s let me just give you a</p>
<p>couple tips then okay number one the hit</p>
<p>programs high-intensity interval</p>
<p>training the insanity I mean I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great workout if you could</p>
<p>recover as you get into your 30s and 40s</p>
<p>I mean you can still do it but you</p>
<p>better give yourself a couple days to</p>
<p>recover from it because it&rsquo;s hard core</p>
<p>so the more intense less recovery so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a balance of of balancing</p>
<p>that out like for example as far as the</p>
<p>frequency per week I had this guy come</p>
<p>in and he was doing a high intense</p>
<p>interval training every other day</p>
<p>okay and now weight loss so I put him at</p>
<p>three times a week and it was a little</p>
<p>bit of weight loss put him at I tried it</p>
<p>to go to two weeks two times per week</p>
<p>and then he lost a little bit more I</p>
<p>said just for the fun of it just workout</p>
<p>once a week and get more sleep that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when he lost the most weight I mean I</p>
<p>was like wow that&rsquo;s interesting so you</p>
<p>may want to experiment and exercise a</p>
<p>little less just get more recovery and</p>
<p>see if that doesn&rsquo;t tweak things</p>
<p>especially with the adrenal being</p>
<p>affected you can walk on the other days</p>
<p>but but if you want to improve weight</p>
<p>loss you want to</p>
<p>focus mainly on making sure that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing it correctly remember to those</p>
<p>nutrients are good with the potassium</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll speed it up in the B vitamins and</p>
<p>then you want to make sure you in a</p>
<p>minute fasting is you&rsquo;re not cheating</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going longer between the the</p>
<p>eating bouts or the eating windows the</p>
<p>magic so called sweet spot for</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is between 18 and</p>
<p>24 hours okay of not eating so that</p>
<p>would be like let&rsquo;s say for example you</p>
<p>ate at 12 and then at 6 that&rsquo;s 6 hours</p>
<p>that gives you 18 hours that&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>start to really get into fat-burning</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s when you start mobilizing</p>
<p>the fat if you push it a little bit more</p>
<p>into 4 hours so now it&rsquo;s a four hour</p>
<p>window you&rsquo;re gonna do better but</p>
<p>ultimately that one meal a day is the is</p>
<p>the most hardcore weight loss so you</p>
<p>would eat once a day and then it gives</p>
<p>you like maybe 23 and a half hours to to</p>
<p>get into serious healing of your</p>
<p>intermittent insulin resistance and fat</p>
<p>burning so that&rsquo;s one thing and then</p>
<p>also episode it vinegar will help</p>
<p>greatly and vitamin D will help and then</p>
<p>as far as the exercise go go so you know</p>
<p>full body high intensity but but make</p>
<p>sure you focus on their recovery and I</p>
<p>think just give it more time and so you</p>
<p>can heal from that time where you</p>
<p>actually did the serious weight loss all</p>
<p>right okay Karen you got to allow you to</p>
<p>ask one one last question okay seven</p>
<p>questions number one so well first of</p>
<p>all I want to say if you have question</p>
<p>about the gallbladder definitely check</p>
<p>out the video blog because he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>lot of videos on gallbladder and the</p>
<p>other thing is if you want the keto</p>
<p>course just commenting on Facebook</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get the keto course and I believe</p>
<p>on YouTube there&rsquo;s a link okay so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to ask and I mean you can ask</p>
<p>but if you comment at all on Facebook</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get an invite for the</p>
<p>keto course I figured that was I was a</p>
<p>little easier if you don&rsquo;t want it you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want it okay</p>
<p>so that what loves my train of thought</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re thinking about let me say</p>

<p>so spread the 1 billion press yeah we</p>
<p>want to spread the word because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just gonna help people so I really</p>
<p>appreciate that now Karen did you</p>
<p>remember okay well I get a lot of</p>
<p>questions about all the mood related</p>
<p>things and I think you touched on that a</p>
<p>little bit yeah but anything else you</p>
<p>want to say for the people who are</p>
<p>asking about what can change kids mood</p>
<p>you know you know in schools sometimes</p>
<p>kids end up in a challenging situation</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll have mood swings or</p>
<p>maybe you know how unusual a</p>
<p>seven-year-old doesn&rsquo;t sit in his chair</p>
<p>without moving for eight hours I mean</p>
<p>some of that&rsquo;s just ridiculous but some</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s the food they&rsquo;re eating yeah let</p>
<p>me just touch on that but I do want to</p>
<p>say this one little thing just one I</p>
<p>want to just mention everything that I</p>
<p>say is not meant to diagnose or give you</p>
<p>medical advice it&rsquo;s just meant for</p>
<p>entertainment and education for you to</p>
<p>do your own research okay yeah so when I</p>
<p>say a remedy or do this do your own</p>
<p>research check with your doctor before</p>
<p>doing this information okay all right</p>
<p>that said here&rsquo;s the cure for cancer</p>
<p>know the mood swings mood swings are</p>
<p>totally a blood sugar thing</p>
<p>hypoglycemia when it goes low person can</p>
<p>even go creative become a psychotic I</p>
<p>mean like lobe lechers can cause people</p>
<p>to do crazy things so you know you</p>
<p>imagine how much how much like soda even</p>
<p>kids I think in even in DC there was an</p>
<p>average child</p>
<p>seventy-five 78% of all the children in</p>
<p>this study could not go for more than</p>
<p>seven days without a soda I was like</p>
<p>what so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s sugar it&rsquo;s the sugar</p>
<p>and of course you load up the kids with</p>
<p>sugar and they&rsquo;re not gonna sit in their</p>
<p>chair they&rsquo;re not going to concentrate</p>
<p>and then of course they&rsquo;re gonna be put</p>
<p>on drugs so it&rsquo;s a blood sugar thing so</p>
<p>yes I&rsquo;m gonna be doing more information</p>
<p>on that for sure yeah definitely do your</p>
<p>homework do your homework on the</p>
<p>problems and do your homework on any</p>
<p>remedy than anybody suggests that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>two cents okay let&rsquo;s take Tom from</p>
<p>Florida you&rsquo;d a question thank you dr.</p>
<p>Berg and Karen they say that tumors</p>
<p>cannot grow in an alkaline environment</p>
<p>and so I was thinking that having a</p>
<p>benign brain tumor that it would be a</p>
<p>good idea to drink lemon juice and</p>
<p>baking soda at night to try to</p>
<p>alkalinize my body a little bit more is</p>
<p>that according to your understanding I I</p>
<p>thought that my diet was was acidifying</p>
<p>my my body probably you know coffee and</p>
<p>Meads and so forth included but I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>keto now 57 years old done a lot of</p>
<p>water only fasting and it&rsquo;s what God</p>
<p>used to really to keep me alive Austin</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had seizures I have had seizures</p>
<p>from this tumor but I refused the the</p>
<p>conventional treatments thank you and I</p>
<p>has been many years but thank you for</p>
<p>the keto advice after listening to you I</p>
<p>I went back on a I had tried the keto</p>
<p>but my wife and I are both on keto and</p>
<p>were very thankful for your advice oh my</p>
<p>pleasure I want to give you a couple</p>
<p>tips Tom okay yes sir okay so here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this this concept that&rsquo;s pushed out</p>
<p>there that we need to alkalize her body</p>
<p>because only cancer and tumors can only</p>
<p>grow in an acidic</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t grow in an alkine environment</p>
<p>well then how do you explain diabetics</p>
<p>that have ketoacidosis they&rsquo;re all acid</p>
<p>okay they get tumors they get cancer I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s actually even spikes some so</p>
<p>basically and someday I&rsquo;m gonna find out</p>
<p>who they is actually I did find out who</p>
<p>that is and I&rsquo;m gonna do a video on that</p>
<p>sometime but not going to tell you who</p>
<p>that is right now but tumors can grow in</p>
<p>an acid environment and they can grow in</p>
<p>an alkaline environment that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>big factor that&rsquo;s not the environment</p>
<p>tumors are triggered by several things</p>
<p>by chemicals in the environment by</p>
<p>basical there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s actually by</p>
<p>estrogen that can grow tumors and</p>
<p>insulin is another trigger for tumors if</p>
<p>I had a tumor what I would do is I would</p>
<p>do exactly what you&rsquo;re doing right now</p>
<p>which is Kido and him in the fasting I</p>
<p>think that would be the best thing but I</p>
<p>also would take seek help for iodine</p>
<p>because iodine actually helps balance</p>
<p>out estrogen which could be connected to</p>
<p>that and be one apparently when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>b1 deficient tumors grow a little faster</p>
<p>so make sure you take a little more on</p>
<p>nutritional yeast or in a tablet to</p>
<p>actually help counter that all right but</p>
<p>and then one last thing I almost forgot</p>
<p>Karen there&rsquo;s this concept that we all</p>
<p>need to alkalize our body</p>
<p>anyone who says that does not or just</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say they have a huge confusion</p>
<p>about pH because your body has about</p>
<p>about 18 different PHS okay going from</p>
<p>severe acid to very alkaline so the</p>
<p>stomach should be acid the large bowel</p>
<p>should be acid the blood should be</p>
<p>Auckland so when people say to alkalize</p>
<p>the body what are they talking about</p>
<p>what part of the body if your whole body</p>
<p>was alkaline you probably be dead now</p>
<p>because you need the pH differences in</p>
<p>the different part of the body to</p>
<p>activate enzymes to create flows of</p>
<p>fluid that go from the stomach to the</p>
<p>small intestine so it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>information that we need to alkalize</p>
<p>their bodies with</p>
<p>pens you know we just need to eat</p>
<p>healthy and then our body will go into</p>
<p>the pH it needs to be that&rsquo;s how you do</p>
<p>it of course you want to consume a lot</p>
<p>of vegetables but not necessarily to</p>
<p>alkalize yourself</p>
<p>now if you&rsquo;re a diabetic you are going</p>
<p>to become more acid but again I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>recommending keto without 7 to 10 cups</p>
<p>of vegetables to offset some of that</p>
<p>acid</p>
<p>so again just I have some videos on that</p>
<p>you can watch thanks Tom okay Karen</p>
<p>question yes so a point on sleep eight</p>
<p>hours is a good amount of sleep what if</p>
<p>a person sleeps six hours and then he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>up and then sleeps two hours or four and</p>
<p>four how did Western okay good good let</p>
<p>me take another question here so when</p>
<p>you when you actually sleep six hours</p>
<p>compared to eight hours and you take</p>
<p>naps it really doesn&rsquo;t make a difference</p>
<p>you can do six hours and a nap to make</p>
<p>up the damage or make up the difference</p>
<p>it is not a problem you will catch up</p>
<p>you can catch up your sleep take naps I</p>
<p>mean sometimes when I have to a lot to</p>
<p>do I&rsquo;ll get up early and I will take a</p>
<p>nap in the middle of the day a power nap</p>
<p>BAM I&rsquo;m out and I come back in I&rsquo;m good</p>
<p>so yeah napping is totally fine well</p>
<p>whatever but what about with you say you</p>
<p>have to sleep yeah in order to burn fat</p>
<p>right and you have to get in the zone</p>
<p>and you and that&rsquo;s when you burn your</p>
<p>fat so how are you gonna do that when</p>
<p>you interrupt your sleep off it you take</p>
<p>a nap I didn&rsquo;t burn my fat when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>napping yeah okay good</p>
<p>yep all right Barbara you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Ontario you have a question yes dr. Berg</p>
<p>thank you for taking my call sure I ate</p>
<p>what I ate by the way of dark mark</p>
<p>hyneman&rsquo;s ten day detox diet for awhile</p>
<p>for six months and then I came on board</p>
<p>with keto and intimate and fasting I</p>
<p>have your book and been reading that I</p>
<p>was on lipitor for a couple of years due</p>
<p>to high cholesterol diagnosis and I</p>
<p>heard just too many crazy things about</p>
<p>lipitor excuse me that I decided I</p>
<p>wanted to get off of it Mike</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t in favor of that but I</p>
<p>personally decided to stop taking the</p>
<p>lipitor on my own I had a recent blood</p>
<p>test and my LDL has gone up should I go</p>
<p>back on the lipitor well staying on the</p>
<p>lipitor until it balances out be the</p>
<p>best move I can give you my life levels</p>
<p>from last year to this year</p>
<p>well let me let me just answer that</p>
<p>because I would I don&rsquo;t even need the</p>
<p>levels I&rsquo;ll just give you the answer of</p>
<p>my opinion of course I of course I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever tell someone to come up medication</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just say you were my sister</p>
<p>okay what I would probably talk to you</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>I would I would educate you on really</p>
<p>what LDL is it&rsquo;s not even cholesterol</p>
<p>its low-density lipoprotein because</p>
<p>cholesterol is type of a fatty thing and</p>
<p>your body is more water so we can&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>without a little shuttle a little truck</p>
<p>so the LDL and HDL are little trucks</p>
<p>that carry the cholesterol to the body</p>
<p>and LDL has some really important</p>
<p>purposes your body makes LDL so the</p>
<p>problem is the artery damage or the</p>
<p>inflammatory damage in the in the</p>
<p>circulation that then will cause the LDL</p>
<p>to stick okay and it&rsquo;s and you should</p>
<p>watch all four of my videos on LDL</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s that would give you the</p>
<p>whole scoop there&rsquo;s so many people to</p>
<p>take lipitor they end up with all these</p>
<p>side effects and and the effectiveness</p>
<p>of that is is not as high as you think</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m gonna say about that</p>
<p>you can research it but when you lipitor</p>
<p>basically cuts down the function or the</p>
<p>the production of cholesterol</p>
<p>systemically well your body makes 3,000</p>
<p>milligrams well now we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>basically cut down the production of the</p>
<p>hormones the nervous system the brain I</p>
<p>mean we have to ask why our body is</p>
<p>making this high cholesterol it&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>for a reason it&rsquo;s trying to heal</p>
<p>something it&rsquo;s acting as a band-aid as</p>
<p>long as you focus on the underlying real</p>
<p>reason for it&rsquo;s sticking and clogging</p>
<p>which is high insulin and focus on that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be in really good shape so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would do I would focus on</p>
<p>lowering insulin there&rsquo;s a whole bunch</p>
<p>of things you can do</p>
<p>because insulin resistance really what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>causing that is high insulin because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s compensating so when the body</p>
<p>then fails to compensate then you become</p>
<p>a diabetic so you just need to lower</p>
<p>insulin and then give it some time and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably see your cholesterol</p>
<p>levels come down real nice and also what</p>
<p>that sing you might be able to get some</p>
<p>natural remedies for the liver and</p>
<p>support delivered directly sometimes</p>
<p>that also helps alright try that Barbara</p>
<p>all right Karen yep</p>
<p>quick question okay take another call</p>
<p>all right good we&rsquo;re gonna take a call</p>
<p>from Tara Los Angeles go ahead you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air</p>
<p>good morning dr. Berg good morning Karen</p>
<p>thank you so much for everything you do</p>
<p>you have saved my life and specifically</p>
<p>my stomach I was scheduled for a gastric</p>
<p>bypass surgery at cedars-sinai in Los</p>
<p>Angeles with I can honestly say the best</p>
<p>surgeon in town and I found you</p>
<p>accidentally on YouTube two weeks before</p>
<p>my surgery I cancelled the surgery even</p>
<p>though I had all the blood tests</p>
<p>everything done</p>
<p>I have lost 54 pounds already and</p>
<p>Counting doing intermittent fasting and</p>
<p>ketogenic diet eating one meal a day and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m following your instructions to the</p>
<p>tee I&rsquo;m a huge fan Mike I have a couple</p>
<p>of quick questions one is I&rsquo;ve blend my</p>
<p>vegetables in apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>because you know you have to add some</p>
<p>kind of liquid to do the blending and</p>
<p>then I freeze a whole bunch of them in</p>
<p>the freezer and then use a good portion</p>
<p>from the refrigerator I&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>concerned that the apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>might kill the enzymes so would that be</p>
<p>a consideration because I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>this a long time because from the</p>
<p>beginning because I really can&rsquo;t go to</p>
<p>the store every day and I go to the</p>
<p>farmers market I&rsquo;ve been eating very</p>
<p>clean</p>
<p>Organic and what about the yellow cheese</p>
<p>because my teeth have turned yellow and</p>
<p>cider vinegar</p>
<p>another thing is dr. Berg is even though</p>
<p>I take a lot of green vegetables because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating one meal a day I supplement</p>
<p>with potassium citrate and magnesium</p>
<p>citrate daily from the beginning and I</p>
<p>was wondering if this may be harmful I</p>
<p>buy the box supplement so there is</p>
<p>nothing added is just a pure potassium</p>
<p>citrate and I just take what the dosage</p>
<p>is instructed on there but I keep</p>
<p>wondering if that may be harmful so</p>
<p>would you please let me know about that</p>
<p>I really appreciate it thank you and God</p>
<p>bless you welcome ok Tara here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple things number one now the</p>
<p>opposite of vinegar will not destroy the</p>
<p>enzymes what destroys enzymes is heating</p>
<p>heating the vegetable okay so as long as</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t heat it you can freeze it it</p>
<p>brings it down a little bit the</p>
<p>nutrition but it&rsquo;s not that much I think</p>
<p>freezing is the best bet for you if you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t preserve the vegetable one thing</p>
<p>that I do I go to Trader Joe&rsquo;s and I buy</p>
<p>this cleaned organic chopped kale and I</p>
<p>bring home stick it in the freezer we</p>
<p>have tons of frozen kale at last month&rsquo;s</p>
<p>okay then we take the kale blend it put</p>
<p>some stevia in their little wheatgrass</p>
<p>juice powder little electrolytes in</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>which is actually the potassium citrate</p>
<p>of the magnesium citrate in my</p>
<p>electrolyte mix and that&rsquo;s totally fine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a problem at all in fact it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually help prevent kidney stones and</p>
<p>drops of uric acid levels so so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally fine so you can blend that drink</p>
<p>and drink it go from a frozen state to a</p>
<p>liquid and you can drink it that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>you can get your vegetables so no I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that at all as far</p>
<p>as outside of vinegar you might want to</p>
<p>start drinking with a straw I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if the acid is would would color the</p>
<p>teeth more than it might a road the</p>
<p>enamel possibly if you let it</p>
<p>swish in your mouth too long so use the</p>
<p>straw but I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s causing</p>
<p>that yellowness but thanks for your</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so glad that you were able to</p>
<p>lose that</p>
<p>well that is amazing awesome all right I</p>
<p>have a question yeah yeah well I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting a lot of questions about</p>
<p>medications now you&rsquo;re not a medical</p>
<p>doctor no and you can&rsquo;t make any medical</p>
<p>recommendations no and you can&rsquo;t state</p>
<p>anything about anybody&rsquo;s medical scene</p>
<p>or the drugs are taking but a lot of</p>
<p>people are asking questions about doing</p>
<p>keto or maybe taking certain supplements</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re taking while they&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>some kind of drug protocol okay and</p>
<p>sometimes you know sometimes we hear</p>
<p>those people say my doctor told me not</p>
<p>to take that vitamin or right you know</p>
<p>can I do keto while I&rsquo;m under this</p>
<p>particular protocol so maybe you can</p>
<p>talk a little bit about keto and what</p>
<p>effect that might create on yes I am NOT</p>
<p>a drug specialist what I specialize in</p>
<p>health so I&rsquo;m trying to get people</p>
<p>healthy so they can avoid taking</p>
<p>excessive medications as far as the</p>
<p>doctors go I mean the the derivation of</p>
<p>doctor means teacher so your doctor</p>
<p>should be teaching you how to be healthy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just my viewpoint Wow I just how</p>
<p>many people didn&rsquo;t know that that isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it raise your hand</p>
<p>know raise your hand okay no you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that your hands aren&rsquo;t raised okay</p>
<p>go on dr. Marie yeah so a teacher so</p>
<p>your doctors should be teaching you tips</p>
<p>and things of how to create your health</p>
<p>versus just managing your diseases with</p>
<p>some medication to suppress your</p>
<p>symptoms which keep the problem there</p>
<p>long term so you never get healthy</p>
<p>because if you teach someone then they</p>
<p>can actually create their own health</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s new concept so that&rsquo;s why we want</p>
<p>to educate people and have you spread</p>
<p>the word in fact you should do that</p>
<p>right now if you&rsquo;re on Facebook and</p>
<p>YouTube because you just want to get</p>
<p>people to know how to fix it themselves</p>
<p>as far as um the doctor gives you advice</p>
<p>in something I mean if it&rsquo;s not true for</p>
<p>you then it doesn&rsquo;t make sense go do</p>
<p>your own research unfortunately there</p>
<p>are a lot of doctors tend to miss</p>
<p>nutrition in school they don&rsquo;t give you</p>
<p>the full study of that so they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the enough data to give you the</p>
<p>right answer sometimes when it comes to</p>
<p>food therapy</p>
<p>and nutrition drugs is a whole different</p>
<p>story so that would be my answer</p>
<p>did I answer that I thought that was</p>
<p>great okay and people are raising their</p>
<p>hands I have a really interesting</p>
<p>question here someone who&rsquo;s Indian I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s from India or just</p>
<p>Indian and they have a staple of rice</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s eating rice on the keto diet</p>
<p>your turn</p>
<p>yeah yeah that the the whole confusion</p>
<p>that people have with the keto diet is</p>
<p>exactly like what is a keto diet is it</p>
<p>like IFAD is it this for that a</p>
<p>ketogenic diet is actually a just a low</p>
<p>carbohydrate diet so if you&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>ketogenic diet with rice you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing a ketogenic diet you&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>rice thing I don&rsquo;t know what that is so</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing ketogenic that means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bringing your carbs down too high</p>
<p>carbo diet right opposite exactly on</p>
<p>keto</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the uncured ayat but if you go low</p>
<p>on carbs between 20 and 50 keep your</p>
<p>carbs low then you go into ketosis so</p>
<p>that would be the ketosis diet so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a I thought it&rsquo;s a low carb just</p>
<p>happens to be adding the fats in there</p>
<p>as the other variable that actually</p>
<p>helps you do this program and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of other benefits which I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to get into as you I forgot with</p>
<p>the the medication that people are on</p>
<p>you know I would get on the keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting there&rsquo;s not any</p>
<p>conflicting information there get on</p>
<p>that get healthy and then get with your</p>
<p>doctors and see if you still need the</p>
<p>medication because if you look at what</p>
<p>insulin resistance creates high blood</p>
<p>pressure heart disease kidney disease</p>
<p>inflammation memory loss mood challenges</p>
<p>anxiety depression like I just go</p>
<p>lowered immune system erectile</p>
<p>dysfunction that&rsquo;s another one I mean</p>
<p>just the list goes on and on and on so</p>
<p>can you imagine if you fix the core of</p>
<p>all those problems what would happen</p>
<p>when you search on the internet what</p>
<p>comes up is like WebMD all these</p>
<p>different you know medical advices and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always saying well insulin</p>
<p>resistance is associated with heart</p>
<p>disease and inflammation no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>associated</p>
<p>I mean that you happen to have something</p>
<p>at the same time it&rsquo;s really sir your</p>
<p>neighbor has it it&rsquo;s misinformation</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re confusing people they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what causes what so and yeah I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if it&rsquo;s an intentional thing or</p>
<p>just a real serious lack of knowledge</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s take a question from Sam Sam</p>
<p>you had a question you&rsquo;re from Florida</p>
<p>go ahead hi dr. Berg where you big fan</p>
<p>of you guys and I love the work you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing great educators in the house and I</p>
<p>wanted to ask a question because I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen a lot of great results with</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and keto however my</p>
<p>girlfriend has gastritis and my mother</p>
<p>does too so I was wondering how can they</p>
<p>apply keto and intermittent fasting when</p>
<p>the recommendation is that they have to</p>
<p>eat frequent meals throughout the day</p>
<p>for their gastritis and also not eating</p>
<p>a lot of high fat meals I&rsquo;m glad you</p>
<p>brought that up Sam</p>
<p>first of all gastritis is inflammation</p>
<p>of the stomach ideally what you want to</p>
<p>do is acidify the stomach but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s inflamed so you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to do kind of a pre healing step</p>
<p>first before you get into acidify in the</p>
<p>stomach so it can actually work right</p>
<p>and and not develop the inflammation in</p>
<p>the first place so the way to do that is</p>
<p>use chlorophyll wheatgrass juice powder</p>
<p>is a really good remedy for that to help</p>
<p>heal the inside of the digestive tract</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I would do and then also</p>
<p>you can do in a minute fasting the</p>
<p>combination of ketosis cinnamon fasting</p>
<p>drops your inflammation so anything that</p>
<p>has itis &ndash;is gastritis bursitis</p>
<p>arthritis tendonitis bursitis all gets</p>
<p>improved so it&rsquo;s the exact thing you</p>
<p>need to do and I think maybe you just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do the the - I mean maybe adjust</p>
<p>the fats but I think that would be the</p>
<p>best solution for your girlfriend thanks</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Wow that was fast yeah Wow</p>
<p>hey guys well thank you so much for your</p>
<p>wonderful questions we&rsquo;re gonna do this</p>
<p>next week Friday at 11 o&rsquo;clock you</p>
<p>morning Eastern Standard Time for those</p>
<p>California people okay have a great</p>
<p>weekend</p>
