    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing fitness.</p>
<p>Fitness, of course, is vitally important</p>
<p>for cardiovascular health, for strength, for endurance,</p>
<p>for lifespan, for healthspan.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of anyone out there</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t want to have healthy hormonal function,</p>
<p>healthy cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>to live a long time and to feel vital,</p>
<p>that is to have a long healthspan</p>
<p>as well as a long lifespan.</p>
<p>Fitness and fitness protocols are tremendously powerful</p>
<p>for developing all of that.</p>
<p>However, despite there being an enormous amount</p>
<p>of information out there on the internet</p>
<p>and in books and elsewhere,</p>
<p>it can be a bit overwhelming.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s episode is really designed</p>
<p>to synthesize science-based tools</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve covered on the podcast,</p>
<p>some with expert guests like Dr. Andy Galpin</p>
<p>or Dr. Peter Attia,</p>
<p>or world-renowned movement specialist, Ido Portal,</p>
<p>or physiotherapist and strength and conditioning coach,</p>
<p>Jeff Cavalier.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had all of them as guests on the podcast,</p>
<p>and each and every one of them provided a wealth of knowledge</p>
<p>in terms of the various things that you can do</p>
<p>to optimize very specific or multiple aspects of fitness.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to do something</p>
<p>a little bit different than usual.</p>
<p>Typically on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>I offer mechanism upfront or first,</p>
<p>and then we talk about protocols</p>
<p>that really lean on those science</p>
<p>and science-based mechanisms.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to describe a specific protocol</p>
<p>that serves as a general template that anyone,</p>
<p>in fact, everyone can use</p>
<p>in order to maximize all aspects of fitness.</p>
<p>So that includes endurance, strength, flexibility,</p>
<p>hypertrophy, aesthetic changes, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, this general framework can also be modified</p>
<p>that is customized to your particular needs.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who really wants to build</p>
<p>more strength or bigger muscles,</p>
<p>you can change the protocol</p>
<p>and the overall program according to that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll talk about very specific ways to do that.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who really just wants to maintain strength,</p>
<p>but you want to build endurance, we&rsquo;ll talk about that.</p>
<p>And of course, we will cover real life issues,</p>
<p>such as should you train if you are sleep deprived?</p>
<p>What about food?</p>
<p>When should you eat?</p>
<p>What if you haven&rsquo;t eaten and you&rsquo;re hungry?</p>
<p>Should you still train, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to cover all of that, again,</p>
<p>in the context of this,</p>
<p>what I would call foundational template of fitness.</p>
<p>And this foundational template of fitness</p>
<p>is something that I personally use.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve used it for over three decades.</p>
<p>Hard to believe that I&rsquo;m that old,</p>
<p>but I just recently turned 47.</p>
<p>And I still use this basic protocol</p>
<p>or template across the week</p>
<p>and modify it according to what my particular goals are</p>
<p>that year, that month, even that day.</p>
<p>Because I, like you, live in the real world.</p>
<p>And sometimes I&rsquo;ve been traveling or I miss a workout.</p>
<p>Yes, it does happen.</p>
<p>Or life isn&rsquo;t organized in exactly the way that I need to</p>
<p>in order to have everything go</p>
<p>according to the protocol that&rsquo;s on paper.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to discuss real world issues</p>
<p>and how to work with the real world issues</p>
<p>in order to get the most out of your fitness program.</p>
<p>And again, by the end of today&rsquo;s program,</p>
<p>I can assure you, you will have a template protocol</p>
<p>that you can build up from, build out, change and modify,</p>
<p>and that will really serve your fitness goals</p>
<p>according to the science and what peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>and the experts that appeared on this podcast</p>
<p>and other podcasts really tell us</p>
<p>is best and optimal for our fitness.</p>
<p>Before we dive into today&rsquo;s content</p>
<p>about fitness and fitness protocols,</p>
<p>I want to tell you about a brand new study</p>
<p>that is very exciting and frankly, very unusual.</p>
<p>This is a study that was published</p>
<p>out of the University of Houston,</p>
<p>examining a, what I would call a micro exercise</p>
<p>or a micro movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very small movement of a very small portion</p>
<p>of your body.</p>
<p>In fact, just 1% of your musculature</p>
<p>that when it&rsquo;s performed continuously</p>
<p>while seated has at least what they report</p>
<p>are very dramatic positive changes</p>
<p>in terms of blood sugar utilization and metabolism.</p>
<p>So the title of this study is a potent physiological method</p>
<p>to magnify and sustain soleus oxidative metabolism</p>
<p>improves glucose and lipid regulation.</p>
<p>This study was published in iScience.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>it is getting a lot of attention and it&rsquo;s very unusual.</p>
<p>Without going into all the details of this study,</p>
<p>let me just briefly give you a little bit of the background.</p>
<p>First of all, you have a muscle called the soleus.</p>
<p>The soleus muscle is a more or less wide flat muscle</p>
<p>that sits beneath what most people think of as their calf,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s part of the calf muscle.</p>
<p>The other portion of the calf is called the gastrocnemius.</p>
<p>The soleus sits below that.</p>
<p>Now the soleus muscle is a unique muscle</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s largely slow twitch muscle fibers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to be used continuously over and over again</p>
<p>for stabilizing your body when you&rsquo;re standing upright,</p>
<p>for walking.</p>
<p>This is a muscle that&rsquo;s designed to contract</p>
<p>over and over and over again.</p>
<p>In fact, you could walk all day on this muscle</p>
<p>and most likely it would not get sore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably done that and it did not get sore.</p>
<p>In contrast, a muscle like your bicep or your tricep,</p>
<p>if I were to have you perform hundreds</p>
<p>or thousands of repetitions, even with a very lightweight,</p>
<p>you know, one pound weight or a two pound weight,</p>
<p>eventually it would fatigue.</p>
<p>You would feel a sort of a burn there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very unusual set of muscles to use repeatedly,</p>
<p>but the soleus is an unusual muscle</p>
<p>in that it really is designed to be used continuously.</p>
<p>Now, this study was focused on how people</p>
<p>who sit a lot of the day and don&rsquo;t have the opportunity</p>
<p>for a lot of physical movement,</p>
<p>or maybe who don&rsquo;t even exercise at all,</p>
<p>can improve their metabolism and glucose utilization.</p>
<p>Without going into a deep dive about glucose utilization,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve done the deep dive on this podcast,</p>
<p>episodes such as metabolism, et cetera,</p>
<p>you can look those up at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all timestamped and available there.</p>
<p>Anytime you eat, your blood sugar goes up to some extent.</p>
<p>So your blood glucose, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>goes up to some extent.</p>
<p>And then insulin is a hormone that&rsquo;s used</p>
<p>to essentially chaperone and sequester</p>
<p>and use that blood glucose.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s basically the idea is you don&rsquo;t want blood glucose</p>
<p>to go too high.</p>
<p>Hyperinsulinemia is something associated</p>
<p>with blood glucose that&rsquo;s too high</p>
<p>because insulin goes up to essentially match</p>
<p>the level of blood glucose.</p>
<p>You also don&rsquo;t want to be hypoglycemic.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to have blood sugar that&rsquo;s too low.</p>
<p>And insulin is involved in both regulating peaks</p>
<p>and troughs in blood sugar, blood glucose.</p>
<p>So we can basically say, and this is very simple,</p>
<p>but we can basically say that you don&rsquo;t want blood glucose</p>
<p>to be elevated too much or for too long.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>In fact, people who have diabetes,</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t make insulin,</p>
<p>people who have type 1 diabetes do not make insulin at all,</p>
<p>their blood glucose is so high</p>
<p>that they actually have to take insulin</p>
<p>in order to regulate it.</p>
<p>Otherwise their blood glucose can go so high</p>
<p>that it can damage cells and damage organs.</p>
<p>It can even kill people.</p>
<p>People who have type 2 diabetes</p>
<p>are so-called insulin insensitive.</p>
<p>They make insulin, but the receptors to insulin</p>
<p>are not sensitive to it.</p>
<p>And so they make more insulin than normally would be made</p>
<p>and blood glucose isn&rsquo;t regulated properly,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>The take-home message about blood glucose</p>
<p>is that you want your blood glucose levels</p>
<p>to go up when you eat, but not too high.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want them to stay elevated for too long.</p>
<p>This study looked at how people who are largely sedentary</p>
<p>or at least sitting can increase the utilization,</p>
<p>the clearance of glucose from the bloodstream after eating.</p>
<p>And they also looked at overall metabolism for people,</p>
<p>get this, that were using just that 1% of muscle,</p>
<p>the soleus, by doing what they call a soleus push-up.</p>
<p>So the soleus push-up can be described very simply</p>
<p>as if you&rsquo;re sitting down with your knee bent</p>
<p>at an approximately right angle, like a square corner,</p>
<p>and pushing up, or I should say,</p>
<p>lifting your heel while pushing down on your toe</p>
<p>and contracting the calf muscle, as it were,</p>
<p>and then lowering the heel</p>
<p>and then lifting that heel again,</p>
<p>lowering the heel, lifting the heel again.</p>
<p>Each one of those is what they call a soleus push-up.</p>
<p>This study had people continuously do soleus push-ups</p>
<p>and they looked at things like blood glucose utilization,</p>
<p>they looked at metabolism and so on.</p>
<p>Now, a couple of important things about this study</p>
<p>before I tell you what they discovered,</p>
<p>which was frankly pretty miraculous,</p>
<p>almost hard to believe, and yet I believe the data,</p>
<p>the data look to be collected quite well.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of statistics</p>
<p>and the study looks to be quite thorough.</p>
<p>First of all, they used an equal number</p>
<p>of male and female subjects.</p>
<p>There were a wide range of body mass indices, okay?</p>
<p>So this wasn&rsquo;t just super fit people</p>
<p>or people that were purely sedentary and not fit.</p>
<p>They used a wide variety of ages, time of day,</p>
<p>people who tended to walk a lot or not walk a lot.</p>
<p>They measured changes in metabolism</p>
<p>and blood glucose utilization</p>
<p>in people that had done these soleus push-ups</p>
<p>while seated in the laboratory.</p>
<p>And I must say they had them do these soleus push-ups</p>
<p>for quite a long while continuously.</p>
<p>So they had them do it for as long as 270 minutes total</p>
<p>throughout the day.</p>
<p>So if you divide that, that&rsquo;s four and a half hours.</p>
<p>You might say, well, four and a half hours</p>
<p>of lifting the heel and putting the heel down,</p>
<p>lifting the heel, putting the heel down, that&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t always do it continuously.</p>
<p>They had some breaks in there.</p>
<p>So this is the sort of thing that you could imagine</p>
<p>you or other people could do while seated,</p>
<p>while doing Zooms or while on calls,</p>
<p>or maybe even while eating, doing that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m not suggesting that you constantly</p>
<p>be focusing on soleus push-ups throughout your life.</p>
<p>The point is that people who did these soleus push-ups</p>
<p>experienced dramatic improvements</p>
<p>in blood sugar regulation and in metabolism,</p>
<p>despite the fact that the soleus is just 1%</p>
<p>of the total musculature.</p>
<p>So here I&rsquo;m going to read from the abstract</p>
<p>about what they found.</p>
<p>People who did these soleus push-ups,</p>
<p>despite being a tiny muscle</p>
<p>and using very little local energy.</p>
<p>In fact, they measured muscle glycogen,</p>
<p>the burn or essentially the utilization of fuel</p>
<p>within the muscle.</p>
<p>And there was very little utilization of fuel</p>
<p>within the soleus itself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the soleus has this unique property</p>
<p>of needing to basically keep you going all day,</p>
<p>walking all day, or moving all day.</p>
<p>What they saw was a large magnitude,</p>
<p>for example, 52% less postprandial,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s after a meal, glucose excursion.</p>
<p>So 52% less increase in blood glucose</p>
<p>and 60%, six zero less hyperinsulinemia.</p>
<p>So reduced levels of insulin.</p>
<p>They also miraculously observed that despite this being,</p>
<p>again, a small muscle, 1% of the total muscle mass.</p>
<p>So very small oxidative use.</p>
<p>They saw big improvements in systemic metabolic regulation.</p>
<p>So this is interesting.</p>
<p>And I think something that we should at least know about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware that anyone&rsquo;s replicated this study yet.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a ton of excitement about this study</p>
<p>in the popular press.</p>
<p>And if the data turn out to hold up,</p>
<p>which I like to imagine they will,</p>
<p>I can understand why there&rsquo;s so much excitement.</p>
<p>What this means is that if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who cares about blood glucose regulation,</p>
<p>you want to keep your metabolism running,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t stop exercising the other ways</p>
<p>that you exercise.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re somebody who wants to maximize your health,</p>
<p>doing these soleus pushups fairly continuously</p>
<p>while seated is going to be beneficial.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>I know that there are going to be people out there who,</p>
<p>for instance, might be injured,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re traveling and you&rsquo;re stuck on a plane,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in the classroom and you&rsquo;re forced</p>
<p>to study all day or take notes all day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not getting enough opportunity</p>
<p>to get those steps that you want to take,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s 10,000 or fewer or more,</p>
<p>getting enough steps or movement.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t have time to get out and do your run,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re also running weightlifting</p>
<p>and doing yoga classes and things of that sort,</p>
<p>but you want to further improve your fitness,</p>
<p>at least in terms of your metabolic health.</p>
<p>This seems like a terrific,</p>
<p>very low investment way to do it, certainly zero cost.</p>
<p>It does take a little bit of attention.</p>
<p>So you have to divert your attention</p>
<p>from other things you&rsquo;re doing to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re still doing these soleus pushups.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that many of you are going to have a lot</p>
<p>of detailed questions such as,</p>
<p>how high did they lift the heel?</p>
<p>And did they contract the muscle very hard or not?</p>
<p>They did not have subjects really contract the muscle hard.</p>
<p>They did measure the angle of heel raise,</p>
<p>and it was anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees.</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t have to go way, way up on their tippy toes</p>
<p>or things of that sort.</p>
<p>In any event, 270 minutes, four and a half hours</p>
<p>of doing these soleus pushups is a lot,</p>
<p>but by my read of the data and the rather significant,</p>
<p>or I should say very significant effects that they observed</p>
<p>on blood glucose regulation and metabolism, et cetera,</p>
<p>seems to me that doing less would still be beneficial</p>
<p>and that you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to do the full 270</p>
<p>minutes in order to get the benefits that they observed.</p>
<p>More about this study includes the fact</p>
<p>that the benefits they observed were very long lasting.</p>
<p>As long as two hours after a meal,</p>
<p>they could still see this improved blood glucose utilization.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know because I wasn&rsquo;t able to find it</p>
<p>in the methods whether or not they were doing</p>
<p>the soleus pushups while they were consuming blood sugar</p>
<p>in this study.</p>
<p>The point being that if you&rsquo;re somebody who cares</p>
<p>about their fitness, this study is interesting</p>
<p>because what it means is that, again,</p>
<p>if you are forced to be immobile or sitting longer</p>
<p>than you would like, if you&rsquo;re stuck in a meeting</p>
<p>or Zooms or class or on a plane, et cetera,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re simply trying to add a bit more fitness</p>
<p>and metabolic health to your overall regimen,</p>
<p>soleus pushups, at least to me,</p>
<p>seem like a very low investment, simple,</p>
<p>zero cost tool to improve your metabolic health.</p>
<p>For those of you that want to peruse the study</p>
<p>in more detail, we will provide a link to this paper</p>
<p>published in iScience in the show note caption.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme, I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors</p>
<p>of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about fitness,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s talk about how you can develop</p>
<p>the optimal fitness protocols for you.</p>
<p>So that includes what to do each day of the week</p>
<p>and your fitness protocol across the week,</p>
<p>and indeed across the month and the year,</p>
<p>and even year to year.</p>
<p>When we had Dr. Andy Galpin on the podcast,</p>
<p>he said something very important</p>
<p>that we want to keep in mind today,</p>
<p>which is concepts are few, methods are many.</p>
<p>That is, there are an infinite number</p>
<p>of different programs and exercises</p>
<p>and set and rep schemes and different runs</p>
<p>and burpees and pushups, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>that one can follow.</p>
<p>However, there are really just a few basic concepts</p>
<p>or principles of muscle physiology,</p>
<p>of cardiovascular function, of connective tissue function</p>
<p>that provide or set the basis for the adaptations</p>
<p>that we call fitness or that lead to fitness.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to list those off now.</p>
<p>We can talk about a fitness protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really aimed mainly toward developing skill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>Or speed, that&rsquo;s another.</p>
<p>Or power, which is speed times strength.</p>
<p>Or specifically strength.</p>
<p>Or hypertrophy, growth of muscles.</p>
<p>Or endurance, such as muscular endurance.</p>
<p>Muscular endurance is, for instance,</p>
<p>your ability to stay in a plank position</p>
<p>or to do a wall sit, you know,</p>
<p>to sit on an invisible chair against a wall.</p>
<p>Or other forms of endurance,</p>
<p>like near pure anaerobic endurance.</p>
<p>So a one-minute sprint or less,</p>
<p>or a one-minute all-out cycling on a stationary bike,</p>
<p>this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Or endurance that occurs in the kind of</p>
<p>three to 12-minute total duration range.</p>
<p>So that might be sprints</p>
<p>or high-intensity interval-type training.</p>
<p>It could be a all-out swim.</p>
<p>It could be all-out row.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another form of endurance.</p>
<p>Taps into different fuel systems,</p>
<p>different aspects of muscle physiology, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then endurance that lasts 30 minutes or more,</p>
<p>which is typically what people think about</p>
<p>when they think about endurance.</p>
<p>But of course, the other forms of endurance matter.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got skill, speed, power,</p>
<p>strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance,</p>
<p>anaerobic endurance,</p>
<p>what I would call three to 12-minute endurance,</p>
<p>although it goes by other names as well.</p>
<p>And 30 minutes or more endurance-type</p>
<p>exercise and adaptations.</p>
<p>Each and every one of these</p>
<p>requires different principles, different concepts,</p>
<p>in order to improve, say, your muscular strength</p>
<p>or your hypertrophy or both.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a general theme</p>
<p>that sits beneath all adaptations leading to fitness.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re really going to set down</p>
<p>as the base layer,</p>
<p>the foundation of everything we talk about today.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that we need to think about</p>
<p>what are the modifiable variables?</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m borrowing directly from the episode</p>
<p>with Dr. Andy Galpin.</p>
<p>He was the one that said modifiable variables</p>
<p>are the key thing to think about.</p>
<p>What are you going to modify?</p>
<p>What are you going to change</p>
<p>in order to increase one or some</p>
<p>of the various things I listed off before,</p>
<p>skill, speed, power, strength,</p>
<p>hypertrophy, endurance, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And some of the key concepts</p>
<p>that emerge from that discussion</p>
<p>are that we need to think about progressive overload.</p>
<p>Normally, when people hear about progressive overload,</p>
<p>they think about adding more weight to a bar</p>
<p>or picking up heavier dumbbells,</p>
<p>but that could also be progressive overload</p>
<p>in the context of running up a hill of steeper incline</p>
<p>or running a little bit faster or a little bit further</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Now, as I promised earlier,</p>
<p>today we are not going to drill</p>
<p>into each and every one of the mechanisms</p>
<p>that underlie the different adaptations</p>
<p>that are going to develop speed and strength</p>
<p>and endurance, et cetera,</p>
<p>because that was covered in the podcast</p>
<p>with Dr. Andy Galpin and the other podcasts</p>
<p>with experts that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>And we, again, we&rsquo;ll provide links to those podcasts</p>
<p>if you want to drill into those mechanisms.</p>
<p>Instead, what we&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re going to start with a program</p>
<p>that essentially is designed for you</p>
<p>to maximize all aspects of fitness</p>
<p>to the extent that you can simultaneously</p>
<p>maximize all aspects of fitness,</p>
<p>but then to change or modify that protocol</p>
<p>so that if you want to build up more, for instance, strength</p>
<p>and you want to just hold on to the endurance you have,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to build endurance,</p>
<p>at least not in that week or that month, you can do that.</p>
<p>Or if you want to improve your endurance</p>
<p>while maintaining your strength, you can do that</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Most people I do believe would like a combination</p>
<p>of strength and endurance and flexibility</p>
<p>and maybe even hypertrophy,</p>
<p>particularly for certain muscle groups</p>
<p>that maybe are not as well developed</p>
<p>as other muscle groups.</p>
<p>They want to bring balance to their physique,</p>
<p>both for sake of aesthetics and for sake of health</p>
<p>and for sake of general functioning,</p>
<p>maybe even to eliminate pain.</p>
<p>The protocol that I&rsquo;m going to describe</p>
<p>really works as a foundational template for that as well.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s drill into that foundational protocol</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll keep referring to it as the foundational protocol,</p>
<p>not because it&rsquo;s the one that I use,</p>
<p>although it is the one that I use</p>
<p>and not because it&rsquo;s the one that we&rsquo;re talking about today,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s the one we&rsquo;re talking about today,</p>
<p>but because we need some general framework</p>
<p>from which to build out the more specific protocols</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll get into in a bit more detail later.</p>
<p>So in this foundational protocol for fitness,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll notice is that on any one given day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to focus on one particular aspect of fitness.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s endurance, maybe it&rsquo;s strength,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s hypertrophy.</p>
<p>In particular, it might be hypertrophy</p>
<p>for a particular muscle group or muscle groups.</p>
<p>That said, across the entire week,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s designed to bring fitness</p>
<p>and different forms of fitness to all aspects of your body.</p>
<p>So this particular protocol begins on Sunday,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s simply the day</p>
<p>that I happen to begin the protocol.</p>
<p>And again, this protocol is not important</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the one that I follow.</p>
<p>I follow it because it is important.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s a protocol that&rsquo;s really gleaned</p>
<p>from the scientific literature and the experts</p>
<p>that is for you.</p>
<p>So this fitness protocol is really about you.</p>
<p>I just may refer to it as the one that I follow</p>
<p>simply for ease of communication.</p>
<p>And for me, my week begins on Sunday.</p>
<p>So I do my very best to get a workout in on Sunday.</p>
<p>And for me, that workout is that of a endurance workout.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to either maintain or increase my endurance.</p>
<p>And the endurance type that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>is endurance of 30 minutes or more.</p>
<p>In fact, for me, the goal is always to get</p>
<p>either 60 to 75 minutes of jogging.</p>
<p>So this would be so-called zone two cardio.</p>
<p>People probably have heard of zone two cardio,</p>
<p>but if you haven&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Zone two cardio is something that you could measure</p>
<p>with a heart rate monitor or other device,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>Zone two cardio is the kind of cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;re pushing yourself to move</p>
<p>such that you&rsquo;re breathing faster than normal.</p>
<p>Your heart is beating faster than normal.</p>
<p>However, you are still able to sustain a conversation.</p>
<p>But if you were to push yourself any harder,</p>
<p>that is move faster or go up a steeper incline</p>
<p>at the same rate you happen to be at any one moment,</p>
<p>you would lose that ability to speak.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to complete sentences.</p>
<p>You would be out of breath</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;d have to pause mid-sentence.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s near impossible, even with a heart rate monitor,</p>
<p>to stay exactly in zone two</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re very, very skilled at that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t obsess over that.</p>
<p>And in fact, I don&rsquo;t wear a heart rate monitor</p>
<p>when I do this exercise.</p>
<p>But for me, the goal is to head out on Sunday</p>
<p>and get 60 to 75 minutes of jogging in zone two.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I like to jog,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to jog.</p>
<p>You could replace jogging with rowing on a rowing machine</p>
<p>or maybe even rowing an actual boat</p>
<p>if you have access to that or cycling or swimming,</p>
<p>something that allows you continuous movement</p>
<p>for 60 to 75 minutes at that zone two threshold</p>
<p>we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>For me, that can include some hills.</p>
<p>And when I say hills, they could be very steep hills,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll simply slow my pace down</p>
<p>in order to stay in that roughly zone two range.</p>
<p>Or it could be that they are more low grade hills</p>
<p>and I might just slow down a little bit</p>
<p>or I might even push myself a tiny bit that day,</p>
<p>but really I&rsquo;m just trying to build that long endurance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to build up my capacity or maintain my capacity</p>
<p>to go a long distance without fatiguing.</p>
<p>Now, some days, meaning some Sundays,</p>
<p>since I tend to do this almost always on Sunday,</p>
<p>although there are exceptions,</p>
<p>instead of doing the 60 to 75 minute jog,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll do is I will head out for a long hike</p>
<p>that could be two and a half hours or three hours</p>
<p>or maybe even a four or five hour hike.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s very long.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll do that sometimes simply to mix up the routine</p>
<p>because sometimes jogging and jogging the same routes</p>
<p>gets boring to me.</p>
<p>I do enjoy running.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been doing for a very long time,</p>
<p>but sometimes it just gets a little bit tedious</p>
<p>and I want to do something different.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes I want to be social on Sundays.</p>
<p>I want to head out on a hike with my partner</p>
<p>or I want to meet up with friends and hike with them.</p>
<p>And so taking a long hike on Sunday</p>
<p>is something that also could be quite social.</p>
<p>And then I don&rsquo;t have to worry about</p>
<p>also getting in my workout</p>
<p>when heading out on a hike with my partner</p>
<p>or going out to meet with friends or things of that sort.</p>
<p>I will say that there&rsquo;s a specific tool</p>
<p>or a specific change that you can make</p>
<p>to this Sunday long endurance,</p>
<p>or at least what I consider long for me.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s by no means a marathon or an Ironman,</p>
<p>but this long endurance training.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the use of a weight vest.</p>
<p>So something that I&rsquo;ve really started utilizing</p>
<p>more recently, and by more recently,</p>
<p>I really mean within the last year or so,</p>
<p>is I purchased one of these weight vests</p>
<p>that can be anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds.</p>
<p>What I use in the weight vest is irrelevant,</p>
<p>but it certainly changes the level of effort required</p>
<p>when taking a hike or even a walk.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s an additional benefit of the weight vest,</p>
<p>which is that if you are going out for a hike</p>
<p>or even for a walk for social reasons,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re with somebody that&rsquo;s not quite</p>
<p>at the same fitness level that you are,</p>
<p>frankly, it&rsquo;s a little bit rude</p>
<p>to just keep walking ahead of them and running back</p>
<p>or running ahead and running back.</p>
<p>You know, oftentimes you really want to spend time</p>
<p>with the person and you don&rsquo;t want them to feel</p>
<p>as if they&rsquo;re holding you up.</p>
<p>And so the weight vest is a terrific way</p>
<p>to get some additional work.</p>
<p>Then as you&rsquo;ll find, if you wear a weight vest,</p>
<p>it is additional work on say a shorter hike.</p>
<p>So maybe the person you&rsquo;re with only has time</p>
<p>for an hour long hike,</p>
<p>or maybe they just don&rsquo;t have the fitness</p>
<p>to do a two hour or three hour hike.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll throw on the weight vest</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll head out for a walk with them or a hike with them.</p>
<p>Or sometimes I&rsquo;ll go out on a long hike</p>
<p>with a weight vest myself.</p>
<p>So again, the point of this for me Sunday,</p>
<p>although it could fall on any day for you,</p>
<p>workout is really to build up that long form endurance.</p>
<p>And this fits well with what Dr. Andy Galpin</p>
<p>and Dr. Peter Attia referred to as the real need</p>
<p>to get in some long endurance type work at some point</p>
<p>or even multiple points throughout the week.</p>
<p>For me, this long Sunday jog of 60 to 75 minutes</p>
<p>or long Sunday hike or weighted walk or weighted hike</p>
<p>really accomplishes that goal.</p>
<p>Sometimes leads to a little bit of soreness,</p>
<p>particularly in my calves,</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;m wearing the weight vest,</p>
<p>sometimes my midsection will get sore</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to remain upright.</p>
<p>So I think it also builds up some muscular endurance,</p>
<p>not just cardiovascular endurance.</p>
<p>But again, throughout the entire time</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m jogging or hiking,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m trying to get to is a place where I can feel</p>
<p>that my pulse rate is definitely elevated,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not so elevated that I have to stop</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m out of breath.</p>
<p>And because I know some people out there</p>
<p>might be really neurotic about this sort of thing.</p>
<p>If you have to stop because you&rsquo;re out of breath,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you blew the workout</p>
<p>that you aren&rsquo;t getting endurance.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re getting benefits from it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not absolutely neurotic about always staying</p>
<p>exactly in that heart rate zone.</p>
<p>I might stop and have a conversation for a moment</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a longer hike,</p>
<p>although I really try and keep moving</p>
<p>and I try and push myself just a little bit further</p>
<p>than where I&rsquo;m exceedingly comfortable.</p>
<p>And so for me, doing this long Sunday hike or jog</p>
<p>really provides a foundation, a base for endurance</p>
<p>that then the other endurance workouts</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll describe later in that type place</p>
<p>later in the week can build on.</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>we will get back to the mechanisms that this taps into</p>
<p>and why this is so useful.</p>
<p>There are multiple benefits to doing these kinds of</p>
<p>endurance type workouts and zone two cardio,</p>
<p>but by putting it at the start of my week,</p>
<p>again, my week starts on Sunday,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that regardless of how the rest of the week goes,</p>
<p>that I got my endurance training in.</p>
<p>And of course I&rsquo;m going to want to,</p>
<p>and I will do endurance training other days during the week,</p>
<p>but if something comes up or I happen to get sick</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m really behind in terms of work</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t get other workouts in,</p>
<p>this Sunday long jog or hike really provides</p>
<p>that fundamental, I can honestly say foundation</p>
<p>for cardiovascular fitness and endurance</p>
<p>that I can hang my hat on and say,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;ve got that one in the bag</p>
<p>and I can then look to other days of the week</p>
<p>to focus on other aspects of fitness.</p>
<p>Now, a really important point to make</p>
<p>about this Sunday endurance workout</p>
<p>is that allows you to check off a box</p>
<p>and that box is 75 or so minutes of zone two cardio</p>
<p>because as you may have heard,</p>
<p>either in this podcast or from others out there,</p>
<p>like Dr. Peter Attia,</p>
<p>getting 180 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week</p>
<p>has enormous positive effects on longevity</p>
<p>and enormous positive effects on general health.</p>
<p>Again, in terms of cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>but also metabolic fuel utilization,</p>
<p>also in terms of your musculature</p>
<p>and your ability to use your body over long distances</p>
<p>for long periods of time.</p>
<p>So while it doesn&rsquo;t complete all 180 to 200 minutes per week</p>
<p>it certainly gets you a good distance,</p>
<p>pun intended, toward that goal.</p>
<p>Now, I want to acknowledge that some people</p>
<p>might be starting a fitness program</p>
<p>and so 60 to 75 minutes of jogging might be too long</p>
<p>or a three hour weighted vested hike</p>
<p>or some people might even do what&rsquo;s called a rock,</p>
<p>like you wear a rucksack, that might be too much.</p>
<p>In which case, certainly start with less</p>
<p>and go on flat ground and go at the rate</p>
<p>that allows you to get into zone two,</p>
<p>but that is not excessively difficult for you.</p>
<p>And then as you build up fitness, you can add time</p>
<p>or you can add weight through a weight vest</p>
<p>or if you don&rsquo;t want to buy a weight vest</p>
<p>or can&rsquo;t afford one, there&rsquo;s a simple solution to that.</p>
<p>I actually have a good anecdote about that.</p>
<p>One time I was heading out for a hike with a friend of mine.</p>
<p>He was a former SEAL team operator.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget this.</p>
<p>And he said, oh yeah, I&rsquo;ll bring you a sack.</p>
<p>And I thought he meant like a sack lunch,</p>
<p>like he was going to bring lunch.</p>
<p>And I showed up and he basically gave me a backpack</p>
<p>that was loaded with a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>and the backpack weighed about 40 pounds.</p>
<p>And then we took a hike.</p>
<p>So I was thinking lunch, he was thinking weighted backpack.</p>
<p>And a weighted backpack, or even just any kind of strong sack</p>
<p>that you can put over your shoulders</p>
<p>or even carry in your arms,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to work exceedingly well</p>
<p>to build in some extra requirement for effort.</p>
<p>So you certainly don&rsquo;t have to purchase a weight vest</p>
<p>in order to get the benefits</p>
<p>of bringing additional weight along with you</p>
<p>on these long cardiovascular events.</p>
<p>But again, build up over time.</p>
<p>You can add time, you can add weight.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also a really nice feature of adding weight,</p>
<p>which is at some point your schedule might be such,</p>
<p>or you just don&rsquo;t really want to keep adding more and more</p>
<p>and more time on this long endurance Sunday,</p>
<p>in this case, workout.</p>
<p>In that case, add weight.</p>
<p>You can also, as you build up fitness,</p>
<p>you can add speed to it.</p>
<p>Your zone two and what zone two is won&rsquo;t shift,</p>
<p>but what work is required from you</p>
<p>in order to get into zone two will shift.</p>
<p>That is, as you get more and more fit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have to move faster and or bring more weight</p>
<p>in order to stay in zone two.</p>
<p>And that will simply tell you</p>
<p>that you are indeed improving your endurance.</p>
<p>Okay, so then Monday rolls around</p>
<p>and I, like most everyone else out there, I work on Monday.</p>
<p>I get right into my emails and preparation for podcasts</p>
<p>and running my laboratory, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, I make sure that at some point on Monday,</p>
<p>and for me, that some point is typically</p>
<p>and ideally early in the morning.</p>
<p>So 7 a.m. or so, I train my legs on Monday.</p>
<p>So that includes quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves.</p>
<p>Why do I do that workout on Monday?</p>
<p>And what is that workout designed to do?</p>
<p>Well, that workout is really designed to make sure</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m either maintaining</p>
<p>or building strength in my legs.</p>
<p>And this is not simply for aesthetic reasons.</p>
<p>This is not simply to grow bigger calves</p>
<p>or grow bigger quadriceps and hamstrings.</p>
<p>Although it can accomplish that as well,</p>
<p>depending on how you train.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about details of training.</p>
<p>The reason for training legs on Monday is several fold.</p>
<p>First of all, they are the largest muscle groups</p>
<p>of the body.</p>
<p>And by training your legs on Monday,</p>
<p>it sets in motion a large number of metabolic processes</p>
<p>that carry you some distance even through the whole week</p>
<p>in terms of elevating metabolism,</p>
<p>in terms of amplifying certain hormonal events</p>
<p>in your body, et cetera, that are really beneficial.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I&rsquo;m of the belief</p>
<p>that the legs are the foundation of the body</p>
<p>and provided you can train legs safely,</p>
<p>that training legs is vitally important,</p>
<p>not just for strength of the legs,</p>
<p>but also for strength of your entire body.</p>
<p>Again, some of that is through systemic hormonal effects,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re going to train the large muscle groups</p>
<p>of your body under substantial loads,</p>
<p>you will get systemic release of hormones,</p>
<p>not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,</p>
<p>but also things like growth hormone.</p>
<p>You get increases in all sorts</p>
<p>of so-called anabolic hormones</p>
<p>that even if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not trying to increase muscle size,</p>
<p>because I realize a lot of people are not trying to do that.</p>
<p>These are hormones that shift your metabolism</p>
<p>and your overall tendon strength and ligament strength</p>
<p>and overall musculature</p>
<p>into what I would call a strong foundation.</p>
<p>So for me, Monday is leg workout.</p>
<p>It also just feels good to get the leg workout</p>
<p>out of the way early in the week.</p>
<p>And it accomplishes another goal,</p>
<p>which is that I sometimes will take one or two days</p>
<p>off of a leg workout because they can be very intense</p>
<p>and they are large muscle groups.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll explain what I do on the off days.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not pure off days.</p>
<p>They actually include some recovery type training</p>
<p>or even some all-out training.</p>
<p>But by training legs on Monday,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to get what I consider the hardest strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy workout out of the way.</p>
<p>And again, set all those positive physiological effects</p>
<p>in motion for the entire week.</p>
<p>The other thing is that no workout exists in isolation.</p>
<p>What you do one day is going to be determined</p>
<p>by what you did the previous day.</p>
<p>And even though the previous day,</p>
<p>I may have taken a three-hour weight-vested hike,</p>
<p>never are my legs so sore</p>
<p>from that long, slow endurance work,</p>
<p>because it is long and slow,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m unable to train legs.</p>
<p>Contrast that with a, say,</p>
<p>high-intensity interval training workout,</p>
<p>which comes later in the week,</p>
<p>and my legs might be sore.</p>
<p>In fact, they might not even be recovered</p>
<p>such that I&rsquo;m able to do a real leg work.</p>
<p>And when I say a real workout,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll describe what that means in a moment.</p>
<p>So legs come on Monday.</p>
<p>And I think that for those of you that are using</p>
<p>or interested in using resistance training,</p>
<p>I suggest getting your leg workout done early in the week.</p>
<p>And for those of you that have heard the phrase,</p>
<p>you know, don&rsquo;t skip leg day,</p>
<p>I will go a step further and say, don&rsquo;t skip leg day.</p>
<p>In fact, make leg day your first day</p>
<p>of strength and hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>Put it on Monday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Okay, so now that we&rsquo;re talking about resistance training,</p>
<p>the question is going to come up about sets and reps</p>
<p>and all of that business.</p>
<p>That was covered in a lot of detail</p>
<p>on the podcast with Dr. Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to get into some of that detail now,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to wait until I describe</p>
<p>the entire set of workouts for the week</p>
<p>before I go into even more detail,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a way of what&rsquo;s called periodizing,</p>
<p>that is changing the sets and reps, et cetera,</p>
<p>across the week and indeed from month to month</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really optimal.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to make it seem as if all of that</p>
<p>just pertains to the leg workout,</p>
<p>it actually pertains to all of the resistance training.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just give you a couple of teasers</p>
<p>about the key principles of resistance training</p>
<p>that I think are almost universally,</p>
<p>if not universally, then generally accepted</p>
<p>in the strength training and physiology community.</p>
<p>And then later I&rsquo;ll get back</p>
<p>to some of the overarching principles</p>
<p>that apply to all strength and hypertrophy workouts</p>
<p>across the week, including the ones for the torso,</p>
<p>the arms, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay, so legs fall on Monday.</p>
<p>I should say that leg workouts,</p>
<p>like all resistance training workouts for me,</p>
<p>consist of about, again, I&rsquo;m not neurotically attached</p>
<p>to this, but about 10 minutes of warming up,</p>
<p>and then about 50, five, zero to 60 minutes of real work.</p>
<p>Now, of course, some of that is going to be rest</p>
<p>between sets, but by real work, I mean really hard work,</p>
<p>not necessarily to failure,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about failure in a little bit,</p>
<p>but hard work where I&rsquo;m struggling</p>
<p>to complete the final repetitions,</p>
<p>if not going to failure</p>
<p>to continue to move the weight repetitions.</p>
<p>And again, the entire work portion of that workout</p>
<p>is about 50 to 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, past 60 minutes,</p>
<p>you start getting increases in cortisol</p>
<p>that really impede recovery.</p>
<p>And I personally am somebody that does not recover very well</p>
<p>from high intensity exercise.</p>
<p>I realized that within the literature,</p>
<p>it is believed, and I think generally accepted,</p>
<p>that when you stimulate muscle hypertrophy</p>
<p>or strength increases, it impacts the nervous system.</p>
<p>It also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.</p>
<p>There are a number of different forms of adaptation</p>
<p>that occur to give you muscle strength and size changes.</p>
<p>And these days people talk a lot</p>
<p>about needing to stimulate muscle growth or muscle strength</p>
<p>at least every 48 hours.</p>
<p>But I can tell you that I recover rather slowly</p>
<p>and I benefit from working the same muscle group</p>
<p>about twice per week with longer,</p>
<p>or I should say more days of rest in between those workouts.</p>
<p>So if I train legs on Monday, believe it or not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only training legs on Monday.</p>
<p>I do not have a second leg workout during the week.</p>
<p>However, on Friday,</p>
<p>I do a high intensity interval training session</p>
<p>that serves two purposes.</p>
<p>One is it serves the purpose</p>
<p>of triggering a certain type of endurance</p>
<p>and getting my heart rate very, very high.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>because of the way I do that workout,</p>
<p>it acts as a sort of supplement</p>
<p>or a more moderate intensity workout</p>
<p>for quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves,</p>
<p>such that I at least never lose strength.</p>
<p>And in fact, generally build strength</p>
<p>from one leg workout to the next,</p>
<p>provided I&rsquo;m doing things correctly.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m not referring to is the kind of classic,</p>
<p>you know, super high intensity training once per week,</p>
<p>and then not actually training that muscle group again.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s really training each muscle group</p>
<p>twice per week, once directly,</p>
<p>and then once indirectly,</p>
<p>either during another weight training workout</p>
<p>or during a cardiovascular,</p>
<p>I should say endurance training workout.</p>
<p>So again, legs on Monday,</p>
<p>the workout is 50 to 60 minutes after a brief warmup.</p>
<p>I generally pick two exercises per muscle group.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m doing calves,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing quadriceps, and I&rsquo;m doing hamstrings.</p>
<p>You should pick the exercises that work for you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m actually not going to share</p>
<p>which exercises I use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of suggestions</p>
<p>about the ones I do use,</p>
<p>but really exercise selection,</p>
<p>as Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,</p>
<p>is a very important variable.</p>
<p>And the key thing to emphasize for that variable</p>
<p>is that you need to be able</p>
<p>to perform the movement safely.</p>
<p>So I know there&rsquo;s a huge debate out there</p>
<p>and people love to argue about whether or not</p>
<p>one can squat or deadlift for long periods of time</p>
<p>or should or should not.</p>
<p>Some people say you absolutely should.</p>
<p>I personally do not squat and do not deadlift.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually never done much squatting or deadlifting.</p>
<p>I know some people out there are probably rolling their eyes</p>
<p>or switching the channel at this point.</p>
<p>But I can say that for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to achieve the strength and hypertrophy goals</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been seeking,</p>
<p>doing things like leg extensions and hack squats,</p>
<p>or for hamstrings,</p>
<p>doing things like leg curls and glute ham raises,</p>
<p>or for calves, doing standing and seated calf raises</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>I think a key principle</p>
<p>that everyone should pay attention to</p>
<p>is one that was taught to me</p>
<p>by an excellent strength coach years ago.</p>
<p>And I still use this and at least it works for me.</p>
<p>For each muscle group,</p>
<p>try and find an exercise in which you get that muscle</p>
<p>into a weighted stretch position.</p>
<p>So this would be, for instance, the standing calf raise,</p>
<p>you know, down at the bottom, it&rsquo;s weighted,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a deep stretch</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re doing the movement correctly.</p>
<p>As well as another exercise</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re getting contraction</p>
<p>in the shortened position of the muscle.</p>
<p>So for the hamstrings, that would be the leg curl.</p>
<p>For the calves, it would be a seated calf raise.</p>
<p>Or for the quadriceps, the leg extension is, you know,</p>
<p>if the machine is designed right</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing it correctly,</p>
<p>the peak contraction is largely going to occur</p>
<p>at the leg&rsquo;s extended position.</p>
<p>But then another exercise for each muscle group</p>
<p>that puts the muscle into more of a stretched</p>
<p>or at least a larger range of motion</p>
<p>or compound type movement,</p>
<p>but ideally where there&rsquo;s some stretch there.</p>
<p>So I guess I will tell you what exercise I do.</p>
<p>For the quadriceps,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be leg extensions and hack squats.</p>
<p>I use hack squats because I don&rsquo;t do free bar squats</p>
<p>for safety reasons.</p>
<p>And I like the hack squat machine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do leg curls and glute ham raises for hamstrings.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll do standing calf raises</p>
<p>and seated calf raises for the calves.</p>
<p>Again, those are the movements that I use</p>
<p>because I can perform them safely in the repetition ranges</p>
<p>and with the weights that are required for me</p>
<p>to either maintain or build leg strength and calf strength.</p>
<p>But you might decide that for you,</p>
<p>deadlifts are absolutely essential and terrific.</p>
<p>Or squats, free bar squats are absolutely terrific.</p>
<p>Or front, you know, front squats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to tell you which exercises to do or not do.</p>
<p>I am telling you that it&rsquo;s probably wise</p>
<p>to at least consider doing</p>
<p>at least two exercises per muscle group,</p>
<p>probably three maximum,</p>
<p>if you ask me,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing your entire legs and calves in one day.</p>
<p>But to think about doing one exercise</p>
<p>where the muscle is brought</p>
<p>into that shortened peak contraction position,</p>
<p>like leg curls or leg extensions or seated calf raise.</p>
<p>And then another exercise for each muscle group</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s more of an elongation</p>
<p>and maybe even a stretch on the muscle group.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s a principle</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll hear me talk about later</p>
<p>when I talk about training other muscle groups</p>
<p>for strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So now you know approximately how long to train.</p>
<p>You might be somebody who can get away with training</p>
<p>for an hour and a half,</p>
<p>and that won&rsquo;t impede your recovery.</p>
<p>For me, that really starts to impede my recovery.</p>
<p>Also, if I&rsquo;m staying on task,</p>
<p>that 60 minute limit really works well for me.</p>
<p>Do I occasionally train for 75 minutes?</p>
<p>Yes, because if I&rsquo;m waiting for a piece of equipment,</p>
<p>sometimes I have to just wait longer.</p>
<p>So that happens,</p>
<p>but I really try and keep the total duration</p>
<p>of the workout shorter.</p>
<p>How many sets and reps and rest intervals?</p>
<p>Well, that was covered by Dr. Andy Galpin as well,</p>
<p>without getting into the total science.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief summary of how to structure that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that if you&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>lower repetitions and heavier weights,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to want to do a bit more volume.</p>
<p>I know that this spits in the face</p>
<p>of what a lot of people think,</p>
<p>but so if you&rsquo;re going to do five sets of five,</p>
<p>I would consider five repetitions,</p>
<p>low repetition range, heavier weight.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to train with higher repetitions,</p>
<p>you can do fewer sets.</p>
<p>That certainly works for me.</p>
<p>I generally follow a program where for about a month,</p>
<p>so three to four weeks,</p>
<p>I will do all my resistance training</p>
<p>in the repetition range of about four to eight repetitions.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s rather heavy.</p>
<p>A few more sets.</p>
<p>So it might be anywhere from three to four sets</p>
<p>per exercise, again, still just two exercises,</p>
<p>and longer rest between sets,</p>
<p>anywhere from two minutes to maybe even four minutes</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s really heavy leg work.</p>
<p>And then for the next month,</p>
<p>switch to repetition range that&rsquo;s closer to eight to 12,</p>
<p>maybe even 15 repetitions per set,</p>
<p>but do fewer sets overall.</p>
<p>So maybe just two to three sets per exercise,</p>
<p>again, just two exercises per muscle group typically,</p>
<p>and shorten the rest between sets</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s more in the 90 second,</p>
<p>maybe even as short as 60 seconds rest between sets,</p>
<p>but typically 90 seconds to about two minutes</p>
<p>or two and a half minutes.</p>
<p>So basically it&rsquo;s one month heavier,</p>
<p>the next month slightly lighter,</p>
<p>although I wouldn&rsquo;t say light,</p>
<p>I would say moderate weight and moderate rep range.</p>
<p>That tends to work well for me.</p>
<p>It also adheres to a principle that came up</p>
<p>during the discussion, again, with Dr. Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>that for hypertrophy, you really can use repetition ranges</p>
<p>anywhere from five to 30, three zero reps.</p>
<p>But he emphasized changing the repetition ranges</p>
<p>in order to offset boredom.</p>
<p>Frankly, I like to train heavier,</p>
<p>I enjoy training in the four to eight rep range.</p>
<p>However, I noticed that if I do that</p>
<p>for more than four weeks in a row,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t switch over to training in the eight to 12,</p>
<p>maybe in 15 repetition range for about a month,</p>
<p>well, then I can&rsquo;t make continuous progress,</p>
<p>I start to actually lose ground.</p>
<p>But by switching back and forth,</p>
<p>I actually can make continuous progress</p>
<p>at least across the year.</p>
<p>So I hope that that principle,</p>
<p>or I should say that protocol was communicated clearly.</p>
<p>It works very well, I assure you.</p>
<p>Does that mean that I never get 10 repetitions on a week</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m supposed to train</p>
<p>in the four to eight repetition range?</p>
<p>No, occasionally I&rsquo;ll venture up</p>
<p>into the 10 repetition range.</p>
<p>But I really try and cluster the low repetition work</p>
<p>for about a month, again, across all workouts</p>
<p>and all exercises, and the slightly higher,</p>
<p>I would even say moderate repetition work</p>
<p>across to the next month.</p>
<p>One thing that you&rsquo;ll notice</p>
<p>since we are talking about total fitness programming</p>
<p>is that during the month</p>
<p>where you are doing moderate repetitions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that your endurance work</p>
<p>will actually be facilitated.</p>
<p>And I do not think that&rsquo;s a coincidence.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s not a coincidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because when you are training very heavy</p>
<p>or in the heavier range, lower repetitions, et cetera,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re tapping into different processes in those muscles.</p>
<p>So when you head out for that long Sunday hike,</p>
<p>or as you&rsquo;ll soon hear,</p>
<p>whereas on Friday you&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>high-intensity interval training,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll notice is during certain months</p>
<p>of weight training, when you&rsquo;re training more heavy,</p>
<p>those workouts will feel, literally,</p>
<p>will feel different than they will during the months</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing moderate repetition work.</p>
<p>I am not a competitive athlete.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not running races or triathlons</p>
<p>like some of my friends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very impressed by them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really just trying to get</p>
<p>overall cardiovascular fitness, overall strength,</p>
<p>overall hypertrophy where I need it,</p>
<p>maintain muscle size, et cetera,</p>
<p>in muscle groups where I&rsquo;m just trying to maintain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really my goal.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not trying to optimize any of these workouts</p>
<p>for any one performance feature,</p>
<p>but in a little bit, we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>how you can change various aspects,</p>
<p>that is variables of this protocols,</p>
<p>in order to say, for instance, really emphasize hypertrophy</p>
<p>or really emphasize endurance.</p>
<p>Okay, so with what I would call</p>
<p>a standard endurance workout done on Sunday,</p>
<p>and I say standard because most people,</p>
<p>when they hear endurance,</p>
<p>they think of the ability to endure,</p>
<p>to continue in a repeated movement or exercise</p>
<p>over some period of time.</p>
<p>With that workout done on Sunday,</p>
<p>and then with the leg workout done on Monday,</p>
<p>you can feel really good about</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re heading into the week.</p>
<p>However, after training legs on Monday,</p>
<p>I experienced that doing cardiovascular workouts</p>
<p>the next day is either inefficient</p>
<p>or at least doesn&rsquo;t really allow me</p>
<p>to completely recover from my leg workout.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that some people</p>
<p>are going to immediately scoff at that.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are really beautiful papers out there</p>
<p>talking about how one can actually do</p>
<p>a fair amount of cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>without interfering with their strength</p>
<p>and speed and hypertrophy improvements and vice versa.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a terrific review that was mentioned</p>
<p>on the podcast with Dr. Andy Galpin.</p>
<p>This is a review that we&rsquo;ll provide a citation to</p>
<p>and a reference and a link to,</p>
<p>which is the review by Murak and Bagley,</p>
<p>which talks about whether or not there&rsquo;s interference</p>
<p>between strength and endurance workouts.</p>
<p>Really interesting review if you want to peruse that.</p>
<p>But with all that said, I like to take Tuesday</p>
<p>as a no endurance, no resistance training day.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m not doing anything</p>
<p>for my overall health and fitness.</p>
<p>On Tuesdays, I do a series of heat cold contrast.</p>
<p>In other words, I get really, really warm,</p>
<p>and then I get really, really cold.</p>
<p>I get really, really warm,</p>
<p>and I get really, really cold repeatedly.</p>
<p>And the way I do that is by getting into a hot sauna.</p>
<p>So for me, that&rsquo;s really hot,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve built up my heat conditioning.</p>
<p>So please don&rsquo;t do this unless you&rsquo;ve built up</p>
<p>your ability to withstand heat.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll get in for about 20 minutes,</p>
<p>sometimes 15, but usually 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Then I get out, and then I will get into an ice bath</p>
<p>or a cold water bath that&rsquo;s about 45 to 50 degrees</p>
<p>Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Again, don&rsquo;t get into water that&rsquo;s so cold</p>
<p>that you go into shock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what a good cold stimulus could be for you</p>
<p>and how to determine that.</p>
<p>Or if I don&rsquo;t have access to my sauna and my ice bath,</p>
<p>what I can do if I&rsquo;m traveling is I will take a hot bath</p>
<p>and then alternate with cold shower, hot bath, cold shower.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to do hot bath, ice bath,</p>
<p>unless you have two baths.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know any hotel rooms.</p>
<p>At least I&rsquo;ve never stayed in one that has two baths,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>But for me, this is heat, cold, contrast.</p>
<p>And really what this day is about is two things.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m trying to accelerate recovery</p>
<p>from the leg workout I did previously.</p>
<p>Also, if you listen to our episode</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast about deliberate heat exposure,</p>
<p>or you listen to our episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>about deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>I talk about some of the benefits of heat and cold,</p>
<p>and I get into a lot of details</p>
<p>about how you can access heat.</p>
<p>You can do baths, you can do saunas,</p>
<p>you can even take hot showers.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have access to any of that,</p>
<p>you could even wrap your body from the neck down</p>
<p>in garbage bag, plastic garbage bags.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, wrestlers used to do this.</p>
<p>Put on some sweats and go running.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll get you warm.</p>
<p>Again, be careful not to overheat.</p>
<p>And then you can get into a cold shower.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of ways, depending on your budget</p>
<p>and what you have access to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use cryo, these cryotherapy chambers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hard to find, they&rsquo;re expensive.</p>
<p>Again, I use sauna and ice bath,</p>
<p>and I will do anywhere from three to five rounds,</p>
<p>which is a lot, anywhere from three to five rounds</p>
<p>of heat for about 20 minutes and cold for about five minutes.</p>
<p>How cold should the cold be?</p>
<p>We covered this in the episode on deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a general rule of thumb.</p>
<p>It should be cold enough that you really want to get out,</p>
<p>but not so cold that it&rsquo;s unsafe.</p>
<p>And that will vary from person to person.</p>
<p>So I cannot give you a simple prescriptive there.</p>
<p>Same thing with the heat,</p>
<p>hot enough that you&rsquo;re sweating</p>
<p>and that you want to get out,</p>
<p>but not so hot that you&rsquo;re running the risk</p>
<p>of injuring yourself or killing yourself.</p>
<p>And again, that will vary from person to person.</p>
<p>So you have to build up slowly,</p>
<p>be careful and build up empirically.</p>
<p>I do that on Tuesdays, again,</p>
<p>as a way to accelerate recovery.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>that there are cardiovascular benefits,</p>
<p>maybe even benefits for the brain</p>
<p>related to the cardiovascular benefits,</p>
<p>because of course the brain needs a lot of blood flow</p>
<p>and needs a lot of nutrients</p>
<p>and other things flowing into and out of there,</p>
<p>debris out and nutrients and other things into the brain.</p>
<p>Heat can help accelerate that or improve that.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m doing that to improve cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>improve brain health.</p>
<p>And then the cold contrast</p>
<p>provides a sort of accelerator on that,</p>
<p>or an amplifier, I think is the better way to phrase it,</p>
<p>on that process.</p>
<p>Because in the cold you get vasoconstriction,</p>
<p>and then in the heat you get vasodilation.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re maximizing that process,</p>
<p>which is actually a neural process.</p>
<p>Nerves actually innervate the blood vessels and capillaries</p>
<p>and even the arteries</p>
<p>in order to allow that constriction</p>
<p>and dilation process to occur.</p>
<p>So Tuesday is really about recovery,</p>
<p>but my recovery day isn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>about just laying around and not doing anything.</p>
<p>I might still also take some walks that day.</p>
<p>Remember, I want to try and get that 200 minutes</p>
<p>of zone two cardio across the week.</p>
<p>And sometimes, not often,</p>
<p>but sometimes I&rsquo;ll get in a few minutes</p>
<p>or more of walking quickly that day.</p>
<p>But generally I&rsquo;m working a lot on Tuesday</p>
<p>as I do on Monday,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a little bit tired</p>
<p>or maybe even a little bit sore from my leg workout</p>
<p>the previous day, Monday.</p>
<p>So I try and get that hot, cold contrast.</p>
<p>There are other benefits to hot and cold contrast.</p>
<p>We have a description of the different protocols</p>
<p>for hot and for cold and their contrast</p>
<p>at our Huberman Lab newsletter.</p>
<p>You can find that by going to hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>go to the newsletter tab under the menu,</p>
<p>and you can sign up.</p>
<p>You can actually download those protocols very easily</p>
<p>without even signing up</p>
<p>if you just want to access it straight off.</p>
<p>So Tuesday is really about recovery</p>
<p>and about getting some additional cardiovascular benefits</p>
<p>from heat, cold contrast.</p>
<p>One other thing that&rsquo;s built into the rationale</p>
<p>for doing a lot of heat and cold on one day</p>
<p>as opposed to doing it every day.</p>
<p>Well, in addition to it being a little bit more convenient</p>
<p>because certainly some people don&rsquo;t have access</p>
<p>to heat and cold, sauna and cold dunks, et cetera, every day.</p>
<p>So maybe getting to do that one day</p>
<p>is more accessible or feasible.</p>
<p>But in addition to that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear that while there are benefits</p>
<p>to doing sauna often,</p>
<p>and we talked about this in the Deliberate Heat episode</p>
<p>and the episode with Dr. Rhonda Patrick</p>
<p>when she was a guest on this podcast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also clear that if you do sauna seldom,</p>
<p>that is once a week, but you do a lot of it on one day.</p>
<p>So in this case, it&rsquo;s an hour.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s, remember it&rsquo;s, or more,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s three to five rounds of 20 minutes of sauna</p>
<p>followed by about five minutes of cold or so.</p>
<p>By doing that all on one day,</p>
<p>the peer-reviewed research that&rsquo;s covered</p>
<p>in the episode on Deliberate Heat</p>
<p>this is a study out of Finland</p>
<p>showed that you get massive,</p>
<p>even 16-fold increases in growth hormone,</p>
<p>which are extremely beneficial for metabolism</p>
<p>and for recovery.</p>
<p>So these massive increases in growth hormone</p>
<p>are seen when you are doing these sessions of sauna</p>
<p>that are repeated on the same day.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re only doing that about once a week.</p>
<p>Whereas if you do sauna more often,</p>
<p>there are certainly benefits to that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s time-consuming and you need access to sauna</p>
<p>more often than one day a week</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing it more than one day a week.</p>
<p>But if you do it one day a week</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing a lot of sessions within that day,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve detailed here,</p>
<p>you see these massive increases in growth hormone</p>
<p>that are not observed if you&rsquo;re doing sauna more often</p>
<p>for the other benefits of sauna.</p>
<p>Now, the effects of cold are many.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just vasoconstriction,</p>
<p>but the effects of cold are also counterbalanced</p>
<p>by some of the problems with deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>that maybe you&rsquo;ve heard about on this podcast</p>
<p>and a lot of other podcasts</p>
<p>and seem to be a kind of a buzz theme</p>
<p>on Twitter and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And the point is this,</p>
<p>there are a number of quality studies</p>
<p>showing that if you do deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>in particular ice baths or getting into very cold water,</p>
<p>immediately after an endurance training session</p>
<p>or a strength and hypertrophy session,</p>
<p>it can indeed, yes, it can disrupt</p>
<p>or prevent some of the adaptations that you are seeking</p>
<p>with strength and hypertrophy and endurance workouts.</p>
<p>Okay, so you heard that right.</p>
<p>And I believe that to be true</p>
<p>based on now several quality peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>So by doing your deliberate cold exposure on Tuesday,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to get those effects.</p>
<p>That is the blocking of hypertrophy</p>
<p>or the blocking of strength improvement</p>
<p>or the blocking or prevention of improvements in endurance</p>
<p>that would occur if you immediately got into the ice bath</p>
<p>after a hypertrophy strength or endurance workout.</p>
<p>Now, the caveat to that is</p>
<p>if you are somebody who likes to do cold showers,</p>
<p>I am not aware of any data</p>
<p>that says that cold showers cannot be performed</p>
<p>after a strength, hypertrophy or endurance workout.</p>
<p>Cold showers are different than submersion up to the neck</p>
<p>in an ice bath or another cold body of water</p>
<p>for a number of different reasons.</p>
<p>In fact, they tap into different aspects</p>
<p>of the nervous system entirely.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have time to go into that now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s covered in the episode on deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>But the simple point is by doing your heat and cold contrast</p>
<p>or, hey, listen,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who doesn&rsquo;t have access to sauna</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t like hot baths</p>
<p>and you just do some deliberate cold exposure on Tuesday,</p>
<p>you are doing that separate from your strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy and endurance workouts</p>
<p>such that it will not impede the benefits of those workouts.</p>
<p>Okay, so long endurance on Sunday,</p>
<p>leg resistance training on Monday,</p>
<p>and on Tuesday, heat, cold contrast.</p>
<p>That brings us to Wednesday.</p>
<p>And on Wednesday,</p>
<p>we get back to a resistance training workout.</p>
<p>And the resistance training workout</p>
<p>that I emphasize on Wednesday</p>
<p>is one in which you train your torso.</p>
<p>Yes, literally your torso.</p>
<p>I know this is counter to the so-called bro science</p>
<p>of bro splits.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who originated that term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible term.</p>
<p>It essentially alienates anyone who&rsquo;s not a bro</p>
<p>or considers themselves a bro.</p>
<p>But in any case,</p>
<p>this is not about training chest or back or shoulders.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s really about strengthening</p>
<p>the muscles of the torso.</p>
<p>And of course includes the chest</p>
<p>and the shoulders and the back.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure as I say this,</p>
<p>a number of people out there</p>
<p>who are obsessed with hypertrophy and muscle growth</p>
<p>and filling out their shirts or whatever it may be,</p>
<p>are thinking, oh no,</p>
<p>this is just kind of all around fitness.</p>
<p>But no, the point is on Wednesday,</p>
<p>you train your torso.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to involve some pushing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s good for you.</p>
<p>It might include some training of things like bench presses</p>
<p>or incline presses,</p>
<p>as well as shoulder presses or lateral raises,</p>
<p>things for the shoulders, as well as for the back.</p>
<p>Some pulling exercises.</p>
<p>These can be bent over rows or chin ups or pull-ups.</p>
<p>Again, there are enormous number of exercise</p>
<p>for each and every one of these muscle groups.</p>
<p>Now, I believe there&rsquo;s a clear benefit</p>
<p>to training all these muscle groups together</p>
<p>on the same day.</p>
<p>Because much in the same way that training legs</p>
<p>all on one day can lead to these systemic effects</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re large muscle groups,</p>
<p>working both the pushing muscles</p>
<p>and the pulling muscles of the torso on one day,</p>
<p>at least in the context of this program,</p>
<p>is very time efficient</p>
<p>and tends to wick out</p>
<p>into a number of different dimensions of health</p>
<p>that at least I&rsquo;m interested in</p>
<p>and I think a lot of other people are interested in.</p>
<p>What are those?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s think again.</p>
<p>I want to be strong in not just my legs, but my upper body.</p>
<p>I also may want to engage some hypertrophy,</p>
<p>to grow certain muscle groups</p>
<p>in order to create a sense of balance.</p>
<p>That could be for aesthetic reasons,</p>
<p>but also for balancing strength and for health</p>
<p>and the integrity of the joints, et cetera.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>by training a bunch of different muscle groups together,</p>
<p>you have the opportunity</p>
<p>to get the more systemic hormonal effects</p>
<p>and metabolic effects that occur</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not just training one muscle group</p>
<p>and isolating that one muscle group,</p>
<p>but rather training a bunch of muscle groups together.</p>
<p>So Wednesday, I train torso</p>
<p>and I do that in push-pull fashion</p>
<p>just for kind of time efficiency.</p>
<p>Sometimes that means doing a pushing exercise</p>
<p>and then a pulling exercise.</p>
<p>Sometimes it might even mean doing a set of pushing</p>
<p>and then a set of pulling and going back and forth.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re in a gym and a particular crowded gym,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t be one of those people</p>
<p>that colonizes multiple pieces of equipment</p>
<p>and says, I&rsquo;m working there, I&rsquo;m working there.</p>
<p>And that can be quite a dance</p>
<p>and it can be hard to orchestrate a workout like that.</p>
<p>So sometimes it will be starting off</p>
<p>with a set of shoulder presses</p>
<p>and then doing all your sets of those</p>
<p>and then moving to your chin-ups</p>
<p>and then moving perhaps back to shoulders</p>
<p>and realizing, ah, someone&rsquo;s on the machine that I wanted</p>
<p>or using the equipment that I wanted.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just finish up the pulling,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll finish up the back work and then going to the push.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t obsess over the alternation</p>
<p>in any kind of strict way.</p>
<p>I really just try and get the muscles of the torso trained.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s two exercises per muscle group.</p>
<p>And one of those exercises is going to be something</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s, I realize this isn&rsquo;t physiologically accurate</p>
<p>but a shortening of the muscle</p>
<p>or where at the end of the movement,</p>
<p>the muscle is under maximal contraction.</p>
<p>I could throw out some names of exercises</p>
<p>just for purpose of understanding.</p>
<p>So this would be, you know,</p>
<p>like cable crossovers for the chest,</p>
<p>the peak contraction is at the end.</p>
<p>Whereas something like an incline press,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more of a stretch provided</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s done over a full range of motion</p>
<p>at the beginning of the movement.</p>
<p>So again, something where there&rsquo;s a stretch</p>
<p>and something where there&rsquo;s a peak contraction</p>
<p>for the shoulders, it&rsquo;s a little bit harder to do</p>
<p>although there are ways to do that.</p>
<p>And Jeff Cavalier has excellent workouts available</p>
<p>zero cost on YouTube.</p>
<p>He also has excellent programs on his athleanx.com site</p>
<p>but certainly has a lot of excellent protocols</p>
<p>on his YouTube and Instagram.</p>
<p>But on YouTube, you can put in his name</p>
<p>and any muscle group that you want to train.</p>
<p>He has some terrific videos describing exercise choice</p>
<p>and other features of exercise parameters.</p>
<p>Again, a peak contraction or shortening of the muscle</p>
<p>peak contraction exercise and a stretching exercise.</p>
<p>And so for the back, one might say, okay,</p>
<p>a seated row or a bent over row or a dumbbell row</p>
<p>where the elbow is brought behind the torso</p>
<p>for a peak contraction movement.</p>
<p>And then for more of a stretching movement</p>
<p>might be something like a chin up or a pull up.</p>
<p>And as I say this, I understand that stretching</p>
<p>and peak contraction aren&rsquo;t the exact terms</p>
<p>that one would use if they were a physiotherapist</p>
<p>or a strength and conditioning coach.</p>
<p>But I think for the typical person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to generate strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>in those muscles or maintain strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>in those muscles, this kind of nomenclature way</p>
<p>of describing it at least should be clear</p>
<p>and even efficient.</p>
<p>And just to remind you, as with the leg workout,</p>
<p>the total duration of the torso workout</p>
<p>is going to be 50 to 60 minutes after a brief warmup.</p>
<p>The sets and repetitions are going to be dictated</p>
<p>in the same way that I described earlier.</p>
<p>So for about a month, it&rsquo;s going to be more sets.</p>
<p>So anywhere from three to five sets</p>
<p>in the lower repetition range, so four to eight repetitions.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to be heavier weights and longer rest</p>
<p>as I described earlier, the rest intervals.</p>
<p>And then for the next month,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be moderate repetitions, fewer sets,</p>
<p>the same way I described earlier.</p>
<p>And if you want more details on all of that,</p>
<p>you can find that in the newsletter related</p>
<p>to the optimal or foundational fitness protocol</p>
<p>that you can access at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>One thing I should note about the Wednesday torso workout</p>
<p>is that I am a big believer in training</p>
<p>the, what I believe is the highly avoided</p>
<p>or at least overlooked, but vitally important aspect</p>
<p>of total body stability, strength and safety,</p>
<p>really safety, which is the neck.</p>
<p>And I realize a lot of people don&rsquo;t want a large neck</p>
<p>and I totally understand for aesthetic reasons</p>
<p>why they don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting, actually, if you think about it,</p>
<p>that people who have a large neck are often told</p>
<p>they have no neck.</p>
<p>People will say that guy has no neck</p>
<p>or they have no neck when in fact,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re referring to the fact</p>
<p>that they have a very large neck.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that came to be.</p>
<p>Somebody put in the comments why that is.</p>
<p>How come when people have a big neck,</p>
<p>they refer to it as no neck?</p>
<p>So why do I train the neck?</p>
<p>I train the neck for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One is years ago, I had an accident</p>
<p>where I actually fell off a roof</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d been training my neck at that time</p>
<p>for a sport that I was involved in.</p>
<p>And I walked away from it with a sore neck,</p>
<p>but not a broken neck.</p>
<p>And I thought, wow, it&rsquo;s really great</p>
<p>that I have been training my neck.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I was once in a car accident</p>
<p>where I was parked, I just bought the car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my first new car purchase.</p>
<p>Parked in that car with my mother</p>
<p>and my grandfather in the back seat at the red light</p>
<p>and someone rammed into us at full speed.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately, none of us were hurt.</p>
<p>We were all rattled.</p>
<p>And once again, I was very sore in my back and in my neck.</p>
<p>But I think one of the reasons why I was able</p>
<p>to essentially walk away from that,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any sustained damage,</p>
<p>was because I trained my neck.</p>
<p>But I started training my neck for sport.</p>
<p>And I continue to train my neck</p>
<p>because I noticed when I don&rsquo;t train my neck,</p>
<p>I start getting shoulder issues.</p>
<p>And if you talk to an excellent physiologist</p>
<p>like Dr. Kelly Starrett of The Ready State,</p>
<p>has an excellent channel.</p>
<p>You can find him on all the social media</p>
<p>and standard channels.</p>
<p>You can talk to anyone out there who really understands</p>
<p>the strength of the torso and the upper body</p>
<p>and even the back.</p>
<p>What you learn is that, of course,</p>
<p>being the upper portion of the spine,</p>
<p>stabilizing your neck is very important.</p>
<p>Now, training the neck can be a little bit detailed</p>
<p>and specific and even dangerous if you do it wrong.</p>
<p>Again, Jeff Cavalier has a terrific set of videos</p>
<p>on training the neck properly.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people out there might think neck bridges.</p>
<p>And I used to do neck bridges.</p>
<p>I occasionally still sneak in a neck bridge here or there,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t recommend it</p>
<p>because in discussions with Jeff,</p>
<p>he will tell you, and it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>that the discs eventually go</p>
<p>and you can run into serious issues from doing bridges.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t happen gradually.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t notice it happening.</p>
<p>It just happens suddenly.</p>
<p>So I might occasionally do a neck bridge,</p>
<p>but in general, I&rsquo;ll train neck by wrapping a plate</p>
<p>in a towel so that I don&rsquo;t end up with an imprint</p>
<p>of the weight value on my head or face,</p>
<p>and then moving the neck from side to side or front or back.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;ll provide a link to those videos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrific set of videos</p>
<p>that describe how to train your neck properly and safely.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re not trying to grow your neck,</p>
<p>you definitely want to make sure</p>
<p>that you use some light weights</p>
<p>to make sure that your neck is stable and upright.</p>
<p>And I say stable and upright because it&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>that for reasons related to texting</p>
<p>and staring down at computers</p>
<p>and related to weak neck relative to the rest</p>
<p>of the muscles that stabilize the spine,</p>
<p>a lot of people, their default stance</p>
<p>or their default posture is with chin forward.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>Not only is it aesthetically not good,</p>
<p>but it also can create all sorts of issues related</p>
<p>to back pain and headaches and things of that sort.</p>
<p>This is a real thing.</p>
<p>Training your neck allows you to stand upright, sit upright.</p>
<p>I even believe that it allows you to do things</p>
<p>like public speaking or have conversations</p>
<p>with people on the street in a way</p>
<p>where you are front-facing as opposed to looking down.</p>
<p>So Wednesday is torso and neck,</p>
<p>and then comes Thursday,</p>
<p>and that means another cardiovascular exercise session.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s a brief one.</p>
<p>Unlike the endurance training on Sunday,</p>
<p>the cardiovascular session on Thursday,</p>
<p>and again, for me, it falls on Thursday,</p>
<p>but for you, it could fall on a different day,</p>
<p>depending on when you started this protocol,</p>
<p>is going to be about, again, about 35 minutes</p>
<p>of, for me, running, although it could be rowing</p>
<p>or it could be cycling, it could be something of that sort.</p>
<p>The goal of this workout is what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>The goal of this workout is to tap into,</p>
<p>remember that long list that we talked about earlier</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got skill and speed and power and strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms of endurance,</p>
<p>is to get into that range of endurance</p>
<p>where your heart rate is elevated</p>
<p>quite a bit more than zone two,</p>
<p>but that you&rsquo;re not really going all out sprint.</p>
<p>So what that means for me is warming up</p>
<p>for about five to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>That could be jogging, a little bit of light calisthenics,</p>
<p>might even be hopping on a stationary bike,</p>
<p>although to be honest, I loathe the stationary bike,</p>
<p>and then setting a timer and doing about 30,</p>
<p>but ideally 35 minutes of what I call 75 to 80% of all out.</p>
<p>Okay, now I realize this spits in the face</p>
<p>of all you heart rate monitor wearing</p>
<p>super techie exercise types,</p>
<p>but when I think of all out sprint, I think of 100%.</p>
<p>And what is that?</p>
<p>In my mind, that&rsquo;s somebody is chasing me</p>
<p>with a needle full of poison</p>
<p>and I am sprinting away at maximal speed.</p>
<p>That for me is 100%.</p>
<p>So after a brief warmup, what I&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>is go out, typically outside,</p>
<p>although sometimes it has to be on a treadmill</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m traveling, and move, run for about 30 to 35 minutes</p>
<p>at about 75 or 80% of that all out.</p>
<p>What that means is that I&rsquo;m striving to keep a steady pace,</p>
<p>but in reality, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I sometimes have to stop at a stoplight.</p>
<p>There are cars, please don&rsquo;t run into traffic</p>
<p>just to maintain that speed and that timing.</p>
<p>That would be terribly antagonistic to fitness</p>
<p>in particular lifespan.</p>
<p>That running tends to be running</p>
<p>in which I&rsquo;m breathing hard.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not able to restrict myself to purely nasal breathing</p>
<p>and I should have mentioned earlier on the Sunday,</p>
<p>long rock or weighted hike or jog.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m alone, I try and do pure nasal breathing.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m with other people or I&rsquo;m talking,</p>
<p>obviously I&rsquo;m not going to do pure nasal breathing</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m talking, although I am sure that sometimes</p>
<p>they wish I was doing pure nasal breathing.</p>
<p>That Thursday workout accomplishes a number of things.</p>
<p>First of all, it really gets my heart rate up</p>
<p>and it improves multiple aspects of endurance</p>
<p>because as you recall earlier,</p>
<p>the different bins of endurance</p>
<p>that include muscular endurance, anaerobic,</p>
<p>that three to 12 minute range,</p>
<p>and then 30 minutes or longer,</p>
<p>none of them really precisely match</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s accomplished in this 35 minute or so</p>
<p>cardiovascular session where I&rsquo;m pushing hard,</p>
<p>but not all out.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly the reason to do it,</p>
<p>which is that it taps into multiple fuel systems</p>
<p>for the muscle and multiple aspects of the heart</p>
<p>and capillaries and arteries and veins</p>
<p>that are involved in generating that movement.</p>
<p>So it really cuts a broad swath</p>
<p>into multiple categories of endurance.</p>
<p>And also just keep in mind what this foundational</p>
<p>or optimal fitness protocol is really designed to do.</p>
<p>In my mind, a foundational fitness protocol</p>
<p>is one that leaves you or has you in a state</p>
<p>where if you need to walk really far</p>
<p>and carry a bunch of weight, you can do it.</p>
<p>If you need to lift a heavy object with your legs,</p>
<p>you can do it.</p>
<p>If you need to run really fast for two minutes,</p>
<p>you can do it.</p>
<p>And if you need to run a little bit further,</p>
<p>like maybe in 10 minutes for whatever reason,</p>
<p>you can do that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really kind of all around fitness program.</p>
<p>And that 35 minute run, again,</p>
<p>could be swapped with a 35 minute ergo</p>
<p>or sometimes if you only have access to a stationary bike,</p>
<p>you could do that.</p>
<p>I suppose if you didn&rsquo;t have access to any equipment</p>
<p>and running is not your thing,</p>
<p>one thing that I have done,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been stuck in a hotel</p>
<p>because I arrived late someplace</p>
<p>and I really want to get this workout in,</p>
<p>you could do the dreaded burpee.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a lot of opinions out there.</p>
<p>Some people think burpees are downright dangerous.</p>
<p>Other people love burpees.</p>
<p>You could do that.</p>
<p>Or you could do really fast, but full jumping jacks.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s a little PE class, right?</p>
<p>Physical education class-ish.</p>
<p>But sometimes if I need to get the workout in,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll do in a hotel if I&rsquo;ve arrived late,</p>
<p>a particular day of travel,</p>
<p>is I will find the stairwell, the fire stairwell.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make sure by the way that I can get back</p>
<p>into the building</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been locked in those stairwells before.</p>
<p>And I will simply walk really fast up the stairwell</p>
<p>as many flights of stairs as there are,</p>
<p>or maybe even jog it.</p>
<p>Not quite sprint,</p>
<p>but maybe run up those stairs over and over and over again</p>
<p>in order to get that 35 minutes of 75 to 80%</p>
<p>of max output cardiovascular work done.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m really just restricted to my hotel room,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just do jumping jacks for 30, 35 minutes,</p>
<p>sometimes while watching something on TV.</p>
<p>And believe me, if you&rsquo;re doing full jumping jacks,</p>
<p>like really extending your legs,</p>
<p>really getting arms overhead</p>
<p>and really doing the full movement,</p>
<p>by the time you hit five or six minutes,</p>
<p>you are going to be sweating</p>
<p>and your heart rate is really going to be up.</p>
<p>I also sometimes will travel with a jump rope.</p>
<p>I always try and travel with a jump rope</p>
<p>and skip rope,</p>
<p>much to the dismay of the people</p>
<p>who are housed below me in the hotel room.</p>
<p>Skipping rope, I should mention,</p>
<p>can be a very effective way</p>
<p>of getting cardiovascular training</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in a hotel room or an apartment</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t really jump high</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re very good at jumping rope,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find is it&rsquo;s not going to get you</p>
<p>into that higher elevated heart rate zone.</p>
<p>Okay, it can be great for zone two type training,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re really good at skipping rope,</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m really good at it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve done enough skipping rope</p>
<p>that I can just kind of cruise and talk</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more zone two-ish,</p>
<p>even feels like walking at times.</p>
<p>Now you can do double unders</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re really jumping</p>
<p>and putting the rope under you twice each time</p>
<p>or crossovers, et cetera,</p>
<p>depending on your skill level.</p>
<p>But again, if you&rsquo;re in an apartment</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in a hotel,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be harder to do.</p>
<p>And because of there&rsquo;s some skill involved,</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;re stopping more often</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;re continuing.</p>
<p>By the way, and I just have to mention this,</p>
<p>a really terrific Instagram channel is Anna Skips.</p>
<p>This is a teacher, a science teacher,</p>
<p>or I believe it&rsquo;s a math, maths,</p>
<p>as they say in the UK,</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s in the UK,</p>
<p>maths teacher.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Anna,</p>
<p>but I know she skips</p>
<p>because she has this amazing Instagram channel</p>
<p>called Anna Skips.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really cool about her Instagram</p>
<p>is she shows you her progression</p>
<p>from not being able to skip rope at all</p>
<p>to the absolutely incredible types of rope skipping</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s doing each morning</p>
<p>while getting sunlight,</p>
<p>which of course is a essential health protocol.</p>
<p>So check out Anna Skips on Instagram,</p>
<p>really inspiring</p>
<p>and made me want to get better at skipping rope.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working at it.</p>
<p>Okay, so with that Thursday cardiovascular,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it endurance,</p>
<p>but cardiovascular training workout done</p>
<p>around rolls Friday.</p>
<p>And on Friday,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do another cardiovascular training session.</p>
<p>And I alluded to this earlier,</p>
<p>but this cardiovascular training session</p>
<p>is also designed</p>
<p>to tap into some of the ability of hard,</p>
<p>I should say high intensity interval training</p>
<p>to tap into strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy increases for the legs.</p>
<p>Because remember we train legs on Monday</p>
<p>and what the science tells us</p>
<p>is that protein synthesis in a muscle group</p>
<p>can be stimulated about every 42 to 72 hours.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve had Tuesday off,</p>
<p>Wednesday off and Thursday off.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want to lose progress</p>
<p>that you made from that terrific Monday leg workout.</p>
<p>But in order to make sure</p>
<p>that you can do the other things</p>
<p>that follow in this program</p>
<p>and pick back up on Monday with another leg workout,</p>
<p>at least for me with my recovery abilities</p>
<p>and my work schedule,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do an entire other leg workout</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to set the whole thing out of whack.</p>
<p>That is I won&rsquo;t be able to consistently</p>
<p>do the same workouts on the same days of each week.</p>
<p>Now, with that said a little bit later,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what happens if you have to miss a workout</p>
<p>and how you can combine days, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I really strive to get certain workouts done</p>
<p>on certain days consistently,</p>
<p>at least as best I can.</p>
<p>So Friday is high intensity interval training</p>
<p>and that can take a variety of different forms.</p>
<p>For me, the ideal thing to do for me,</p>
<p>again, you could do something completely different.</p>
<p>Exercise choice, again, should be governed</p>
<p>by what you can do safely so you don&rsquo;t injure yourself</p>
<p>and that you can perform effectively</p>
<p>and that gets you or provides you the stimulus</p>
<p>that you want.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m trying to do on Friday</p>
<p>is get my heart rate way, way up.</p>
<p>Talked about this in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin.</p>
<p>In addition to the benefits of getting 180 to 200 minutes</p>
<p>of zone two cardio per week minimum,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good idea to get up to that max</p>
<p>or near max heart rate at least once a week.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not going to do that</p>
<p>for very long periods of time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to do that for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t sprint all out for 30 minutes</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re Steve Prefontaine.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen the movies without limits</p>
<p>or Prefontaine, you should absolutely see those.</p>
<p>He was able to, you know, go out and run 12 laps</p>
<p>what seemed to be an all out sprint or close to it.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>But most people are not going to do that</p>
<p>or are going to be carried away on a stretcher if they try.</p>
<p>These high intensity interval training for me</p>
<p>ideally would be on so-called a salt bike or airdyne bike.</p>
<p>So these are bikes that have the fan,</p>
<p>which might seem like, oh, you know, it just cools you off.</p>
<p>But actually there&rsquo;s a lot of resistance there.</p>
<p>So what I will typically do is a 20 to 30 second</p>
<p>all out sprint using arms and legs</p>
<p>and then 10 seconds rest and then repeat.</p>
<p>All out sprint for 20 to 30 seconds,</p>
<p>10 seconds rest, repeat.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll do that for anywhere from eight to 12 rounds,</p>
<p>which trust me, even if you start out a little bit less</p>
<p>or I should say not all out intensity or effort,</p>
<p>by the time you hit the fifth or sixth one,</p>
<p>you will be certainly headed into,</p>
<p>if not near your maximum heart rate.</p>
<p>Now, what is your maximum heart rate?</p>
<p>Do you need a heart rate monitor?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like using that sort of thing, great.</p>
<p>But again, Andy Galpin beautifully supplied us</p>
<p>with the information.</p>
<p>He said, if you take the number 220</p>
<p>and you subtract your age, that for most people,</p>
<p>most is going to be your maximum heart rate.</p>
<p>Although for certain people who are very fit</p>
<p>or certain ages, that&rsquo;s not going to apply.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit too crude to measure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good starting place</p>
<p>and you can look up other information</p>
<p>or see that podcast episode.</p>
<p>We provide a link to it in the show note captions</p>
<p>if you want to get more details on that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use a heart rate monitor.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to do is get to that point</p>
<p>where I quote unquote, feel like I want to die.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t want to die and please don&rsquo;t die, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not in good cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>do not just jump right into this fitness protocol.</p>
<p>But I want to get to the point where I really feel</p>
<p>like I could not pedal any faster</p>
<p>or pull any faster on the assault bike, the airtime bike.</p>
<p>Or if I&rsquo;m doing this workout in a place or at a time</p>
<p>or because I choose to not use a bike or a rower,</p>
<p>because you could also use a rower,</p>
<p>I will simply do sprint jog intervals.</p>
<p>I will sprint for 20 or 30 seconds,</p>
<p>then jog for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Sprint for 20 or 30 seconds and then jog for 10 seconds</p>
<p>and just repeat.</p>
<p>I used to have a big field next to my laboratory,</p>
<p>my old laboratory,</p>
<p>and I used to bring my bulldog Costello out there.</p>
<p>He was really good at the first sprint part</p>
<p>and then he would just lie down and watch.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even do the jog part.</p>
<p>I would just go back and forth, back and forth,</p>
<p>back and forth, panting like a bulldog nonstop,</p>
<p>barely able to recover before sprinting again.</p>
<p>And the basis of this workout, again, is several,</p>
<p>first of all, it&rsquo;s to get the heart rate really high,</p>
<p>up towards maximum heart rate at least once a week.</p>
<p>So you accomplish that this Friday.</p>
<p>Also, if you are sprinting and then jogging,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re really pushing hard on an assault bike</p>
<p>or an airtime bike, or using a, for instance,</p>
<p>a skier or the skier machine,</p>
<p>or any number of different cardiovascular training tools,</p>
<p>you are going to get activation of the legs.</p>
<p>Of course, not to the same degree as you would with squats</p>
<p>or deadlifts or leg extensions and leg curls.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply not the case,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to trigger strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>and other types of adaptations in those muscle groups.</p>
<p>So this for me also represents the second leg workout</p>
<p>of the week where I&rsquo;m not touching any weights.</p>
<p>One important point that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard mentioned</p>
<p>anywhere else, but that I hope to have Dr. Kelly Starrett</p>
<p>on the podcast to discuss,</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;ve discussed with him one-on-one,</p>
<p>which is be careful with all out sprints</p>
<p>or all out anything cardiovascular exercise.</p>
<p>You can get injured doing those.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you go out</p>
<p>and you just sprint across a field all out 20 or 30 seconds</p>
<p>and then walk back and can do it again and again,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be surprised if the next day you have some sciatica</p>
<p>or even some pelvic floor pain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend going all out on any movement</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t perform with perfect form, okay?</p>
<p>So for me, I really try and stay away from all out sprints.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sprint at about 95% of what I can do</p>
<p>because I find if I go all out sprint,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the reason is,</p>
<p>but it might be an overextension of a limb</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a sprinter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a sprinting coach.</p>
<p>I do hope to get Stu McMillan on here or Dan Pfaff.</p>
<p>They were excellent sprinting coaches at some point.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re world-class sprinting coaches,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not a pro sprinter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even a amateur sprinter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fitness sprinter.</p>
<p>So the airdyne or assault bike or the rower</p>
<p>is really a safer option for me.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m running or I&rsquo;m doing some sort of movement</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m unconstrained,</p>
<p>really in terms of how far my stride is,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m obviously constrained by the musculature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really careful to not overextend</p>
<p>or do something like that.</p>
<p>And the only way to do that is to not go all out.</p>
<p>So again, the goal for this Friday workout</p>
<p>is to really get the heart rate high,</p>
<p>do high intensity interval training.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways you could do that.</p>
<p>You can look up HIIT, hit workouts online,</p>
<p>find the one that&rsquo;s best for you</p>
<p>and really pick something that&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>that you can do consistently.</p>
<p>And I believe that ideally will also trigger a bit</p>
<p>of either strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>and speed power maintenance,</p>
<p>or even give you a little bit of a stimulus</p>
<p>so that by the time you roll around to that leg workout</p>
<p>again on Monday,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a little bit of an additional boost</p>
<p>to your leg strength, hypertrophy, speed, and power.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered Sunday through Friday,</p>
<p>and then Saturday rolls around.</p>
<p>And Saturday is when you train arms, calves, and neck.</p>
<p>So this may sound as if you&rsquo;re training</p>
<p>a bunch of small muscle groups,</p>
<p>biceps, triceps, necks, and calves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true, but I should mention</p>
<p>that you are also training your torso a second time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing it indirectly,</p>
<p>or sometimes not indirectly.</p>
<p>Why do I say this?</p>
<p>Well, keep in mind again,</p>
<p>that for strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going for that once about every 48 to 72 hours.</p>
<p>You want to stimulate that.</p>
<p>On Wednesday is when you trained your torso, right?</p>
<p>Chest, shoulders, back, and neck.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had Thursday to rest, Friday to rest.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people are going to want to emphasize</p>
<p>those body parts and they&rsquo;re going to think,</p>
<p>oh, you have to train it twice a week.</p>
<p>But if you have modest recovery ability</p>
<p>or low recovery ability, such as I do,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing these other cardiovascular training</p>
<p>sessions, et cetera,</p>
<p>well then on Saturday is when you will train arms,</p>
<p>calves, and neck directly, but included in that,</p>
<p>remember two exercises per muscle group,</p>
<p>one with a peak contraction,</p>
<p>one with somewhat of a stretch in there,</p>
<p>included in that,</p>
<p>I suggest doing some sort of dip movement,</p>
<p>which I think it was Pavel Satsulin said</p>
<p>the dip is synonymous with,</p>
<p>or at least similar to an upper body squat.</p>
<p>Excuse me, Pavel, if I got that wrong,</p>
<p>maybe it wasn&rsquo;t you that said that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a big admirer of his work.</p>
<p>And certainly the dip is a great exercise</p>
<p>to hit multiple muscle groups,</p>
<p>chest, shoulders, and triceps,</p>
<p>maybe even some back to some extent,</p>
<p>depending on how you do it.</p>
<p>So doing some dipping movement will indirectly</p>
<p>stimulate strength, hypertrophy, et cetera,</p>
<p>in the chest and shoulders,</p>
<p>and including some sort of pulling movement for the bicep,</p>
<p>like a chin up or palms facing movement,</p>
<p>pulling up to the bar,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s a close grip type movement,</p>
<p>but even if it&rsquo;s a wide grip type movement</p>
<p>will of course trigger strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>maintenance or improvements in the biceps,</p>
<p>but will also trigger strength hypertrophy</p>
<p>in the lats, in the back.</p>
<p>Okay, so Saturday is this arm workout</p>
<p>with that I&rsquo;ll just give an example of a potential workout</p>
<p>where you might do a few more exercises,</p>
<p>maybe not just two, but maybe three</p>
<p>to make sure you get the torso indirect stimulation.</p>
<p>So what would this look like?</p>
<p>Well, this might be your sort of classic</p>
<p>dumbbell curls for the bicep</p>
<p>and maybe incline curl for the bicep</p>
<p>because it has more of a stretch.</p>
<p>So on an incline bench,</p>
<p>and then you might finish with two sets of chin-ups.</p>
<p>So palms facing you, chin-ups or three sets of chin-ups,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you&rsquo;re in a heavier load month</p>
<p>or a more moderate weight month.</p>
<p>Again, activating the biceps muscles because it&rsquo;s arms day,</p>
<p>but also activating strength and hypertrophy in the lats</p>
<p>or at least maintaining it.</p>
<p>So that because you&rsquo;re not training those torso muscles</p>
<p>again until Wednesday,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowing the hypertrophy and strength gains</p>
<p>that you generated on Wednesday to atrophy, to disappear.</p>
<p>Then thinking about triceps,</p>
<p>it might be some sort of triceps isolation</p>
<p>or peak contraction movement.</p>
<p>So that could be tricep kickback</p>
<p>or some overhead extension</p>
<p>would be more of a stretch type movement than a kickback,</p>
<p>but then also doing regular old dips.</p>
<p>You might even start with dips,</p>
<p>which again are going to activate those torso muscles</p>
<p>and the triceps.</p>
<p>And then calf work in the same way that you did on Monday</p>
<p>and neck work.</p>
<p>Again, I am a believer in training neck</p>
<p>multiple times per week.</p>
<p>And if you are able to finish all of that</p>
<p>in 45 or 50 minutes, great.</p>
<p>Most people will find</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing a lot of small muscle groups,</p>
<p>it actually takes longer</p>
<p>because you have to go around to more exercises.</p>
<p>But again, just adhere to the same principles</p>
<p>we talked about before.</p>
<p>About 50, five, zero to 60 minutes of real work</p>
<p>after a warmup with an asterisk next to that,</p>
<p>that if someone&rsquo;s on the equipment</p>
<p>or you can&rsquo;t find the dumbbells you need, et cetera,</p>
<p>then maybe 75 minutes max.</p>
<p>But really trying to not extend that workout too long,</p>
<p>making sure that you activate the arms directly,</p>
<p>but also activating the torso muscles indirectly.</p>
<p>And again, I won&rsquo;t repeat it this time again,</p>
<p>but following the same weight and repetition</p>
<p>and rest interval scheme that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>a bit heavier, lower reps, more sets,</p>
<p>and longer rest for about a month.</p>
<p>And then alternating to more repetitions, yet fewer sets.</p>
<p>Shorter rest intervals and do that for about a month.</p>
<p>This carries through</p>
<p>for all the resistance training workouts,</p>
<p>regardless of the day of the week.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve completed the total arc across the week</p>
<p>and we can summarize it as saying Sunday is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say long endurance.</p>
<p>Monday is leg resistance training.</p>
<p>Tuesday, heat, cold contrast.</p>
<p>Wednesday, torso training plus neck.</p>
<p>Thursday, I would call it moderate intensity</p>
<p>cardiovascular exercise.</p>
<p>So that 35 minute moderate intensity</p>
<p>cardiovascular exercise.</p>
<p>Friday, high intensity interval training of sprinting</p>
<p>or some variation thereof.</p>
<p>And Saturday, arms, calves, neck, and torso indirect work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the total structure.</p>
<p>But I want to emphasize again,</p>
<p>you do not need to start this on Sunday.</p>
<p>That is you could make the long endurance work</p>
<p>start on Tuesday and then just fill in the rest</p>
<p>as described before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really up to you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another important point I want to make,</p>
<p>which is that neither I nor anyone</p>
<p>is going to be successful in doing the exact workouts</p>
<p>on the exact same days of every week</p>
<p>because of travel, work, illness, other demands, et cetera.</p>
<p>The thing about the schedule that I like so much</p>
<p>that I do believe that will benefit you as well</p>
<p>is that you have some flexibility there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the flexibility?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say you train</p>
<p>your typical Sunday workout of endurance.</p>
<p>Then you train legs on Monday</p>
<p>and then you don&rsquo;t manage to do your heat cold contrast</p>
<p>on Tuesday for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Well, you can put it on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Just make sure that if you&rsquo;re going to do the cold stimulus</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t do it too close,</p>
<p>not within four, ideally eight hours</p>
<p>after the training of torso, but you could do it before</p>
<p>or you could do it just heat</p>
<p>and skip the cold that particular week, right?</p>
<p>Not ideal, but better than not doing anything.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say for instance,</p>
<p>the leg workout was particularly brutal.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t sleep that well on Monday night or Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Well, then should you do the torso workout on Wednesday?</p>
<p>Well, I would say,</p>
<p>why not move the heat cold contrast to Wednesday</p>
<p>and then push that torso workout to Thursday</p>
<p>and maybe also try and do that 35 minute run on Thursday</p>
<p>every once in a while,</p>
<p>rather than lose the total control of the program</p>
<p>and let everything shuffle forward.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the basic principle.</p>
<p>I do believe that any one of these workouts,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s for endurance or resistance training</p>
<p>can be shifted either one day forward or one day back,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You could delay it by a day</p>
<p>or you could accelerate it by a day</p>
<p>in order to make sure</p>
<p>that you get everything done across the week.</p>
<p>In fact, I would say the best way to think</p>
<p>about this foundational fitness program</p>
<p>is not from the details up, but from the top down,</p>
<p>from the big picture down to the details</p>
<p>and say to yourself, once a week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get some long endurance in.</p>
<p>Another day during the week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to make sure that you get a kind of moderate,</p>
<p>faster endurance workout in.</p>
<p>And then one other day during the week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get an all out sprint,</p>
<p>high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get those three workouts in somehow.</p>
<p>And then in addition to that,</p>
<p>you will also do resistance training</p>
<p>for every muscle group in your body.</p>
<p>And that means doing your legs hard, at least once a week,</p>
<p>your torso hard, at least once a week,</p>
<p>and your arms hard, at least once a week.</p>
<p>And of course you are also paying attention</p>
<p>to train your calves.</p>
<p>And I do, for reasons I described before,</p>
<p>believe that you want to train your neck</p>
<p>at least to keep it strong.</p>
<p>You may not want to generate hypertrophy there.</p>
<p>People vary in terms of how quickly their neck grows.</p>
<p>Some people grows very, very fast.</p>
<p>Other people for the life of them,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t get much hypertrophy in their neck,</p>
<p>but keeping that neck strong,</p>
<p>at least through some very light work</p>
<p>to moderate weight work, very, very important.</p>
<p>For reasons I stated earlier.</p>
<p>If you set out those goals,</p>
<p>then the specific days that you do each workout</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t as critical, but the specific spacing is.</p>
<p>So for instance,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to want to do</p>
<p>your high intensity interval training</p>
<p>the day after you train your legs,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>that high intensity interval training correctly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be taxing your legs</p>
<p>and eating into their recovery.</p>
<p>And so you want to space them out by two or three days.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;ll notice that the point is really</p>
<p>to optimize everything on the whole,</p>
<p>rather than any one specific aspect</p>
<p>of training or adaptation.</p>
<p>Now that said, I do realize that some people</p>
<p>might be hyper-focused on things like</p>
<p>strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>and the aesthetics that come with it.</p>
<p>A key point about strength, hypertrophy and weight training.</p>
<p>And this is something that has been covered</p>
<p>on multiple podcasts,</p>
<p>certainly the one with Jeff Cavaliere</p>
<p>and with Dr. Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>and the one that I did on building muscle strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy, the solo episode.</p>
<p>And that is the following.</p>
<p>It is the rare individual</p>
<p>who has perfectly balanced musculature, right?</p>
<p>Most people can be a bit quad dominant</p>
<p>or hamstring dominant,</p>
<p>or they have trouble activating their glutes,</p>
<p>or somebody has a terrible time</p>
<p>trying to activate their chest muscles,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re very strong in the back, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that we can know that</p>
<p>not just based on aesthetics, right?</p>
<p>But based on deliberate contractibility of those muscles.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to get into this in too much detail</p>
<p>for sake of time,</p>
<p>but this is something that has peer reviewed research</p>
<p>to support it and was also discussed extensively</p>
<p>with Jeff Cavaliere when he was a guest.</p>
<p>And that actually he&rsquo;s really popularized this notion</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s absolutely true,</p>
<p>which is that if you can contract a muscle very hard</p>
<p>to the point where it almost feels like it&rsquo;s cramping,</p>
<p>if you can do that,</p>
<p>even when there&rsquo;s no weight in your hand</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s no resistance against it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just using your mind muscle connection</p>
<p>to contract that muscle hard and isolate it.</p>
<p>Chances are you will be able to generate hypertrophy</p>
<p>and strength gains pretty easily in that muscle</p>
<p>compared to muscles that you have a harder time activating.</p>
<p>So during all resistance training,</p>
<p>that mind muscle link is really important.</p>
<p>So much so that some people will even try and emphasize</p>
<p>contraction of the muscles in between sets, et cetera.</p>
<p>I personally,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not somebody who likes a mirror when I work out,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not somebody who wants to spend time</p>
<p>between sets flexing muscles and et cetera,</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>I want to actually rest between sets.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m more concerned with performance during those sets</p>
<p>and really putting my mind into the muscle during the set.</p>
<p>I really try and emphasize deep relaxation between sets.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s a tool that again is built out of science.</p>
<p>And I should say peer reviewed studies,</p>
<p>some of which are being done in my lab,</p>
<p>but other labs as well,</p>
<p>which is that in between sets,</p>
<p>what I really strive to do is to bring my heart rate down</p>
<p>as much as possible,</p>
<p>calm myself down as much as possible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll do the so-called physiological sigh</p>
<p>in order to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s two inhales through the nose, back to back,</p>
<p>and then long, full exhale through the mouth.</p>
<p>I just did it partially there for sake of time again.</p>
<p>So a big, deep inhale through the nose</p>
<p>and then sneak in a little bit more on a second inhale</p>
<p>to maximally inflate the lungs and the alveoli, the lungs,</p>
<p>and then a full exhale of all your air via the mouth</p>
<p>to empty your lungs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fastest way that we are aware of</p>
<p>to calm your nervous system down.</p>
<p>And really in between sets,</p>
<p>you can use that to calm yourself down and conserve energy.</p>
<p>But then as you move into the weight training set,</p>
<p>you really want to ratchet up your focus and attention</p>
<p>to the muscles that you&rsquo;re going to be using.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d like to acknowledge</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a huge range of parameters</p>
<p>in terms of how to actually perform during the set.</p>
<p>You can focus on a particular muscle</p>
<p>and try and really isolate</p>
<p>from the beginning of the movement.</p>
<p>Some people will really try and isolate it</p>
<p>only during the peak contraction.</p>
<p>Some people will accentuate the negative.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s speed and cadence.</p>
<p>There are, again, remember, concepts are few,</p>
<p>methods are many.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in the various methods</p>
<p>of eccentrics and concentrics</p>
<p>and all the different ways of changing up cadence</p>
<p>and so forth during sets,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an enormous amount of quality information out there,</p>
<p>far too much for us to get into detail now.</p>
<p>But what I describe the general principles</p>
<p>of how to set your mind, if you will, during the set,</p>
<p>you should be focused on the muscles that you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>and or moving the weight.</p>
<p>If movement of the weight is more important,</p>
<p>you can either focus on moving the weight</p>
<p>or challenging muscles, right?</p>
<p>You can either try and isolate muscles</p>
<p>and make specific muscles do the work</p>
<p>or simply moving the weight.</p>
<p>Moving the weight is going to be more geared</p>
<p>towards strength improvements,</p>
<p>but focusing on the muscles,</p>
<p>so-called my muscle link is going to shift</p>
<p>that very same set more toward hypertrophy.</p>
<p>I realize I&rsquo;m painting with a broad brush here,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, this is grounded in the way</p>
<p>that the nervous system governs muscular contraction.</p>
<p>And while I think most people are familiar</p>
<p>with the number of different variables</p>
<p>associated with the resistance training,</p>
<p>you know, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et cetera,</p>
<p>there are also a tremendous number</p>
<p>of very important variables for endurance</p>
<p>and any kind of cardiovascular training.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of excellent resources</p>
<p>out there about that.</p>
<p>I think the most important one,</p>
<p>in fact, I will go on record saying</p>
<p>what I believe to be the most important variable</p>
<p>for any endurance or cardiovascular training</p>
<p>is that because it&rsquo;s a repetitive movement</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re able to complete the movement safely,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re not putting your body</p>
<p>into range of motion or into positions</p>
<p>that can damage joints or put you</p>
<p>in any kind of compromised state.</p>
<p>And some people might think,</p>
<p>well, that seems kind of silly,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;ve ever set the, for instance,</p>
<p>the seat too high on a stationary bike</p>
<p>and then done, you know,</p>
<p>air dyne or assault bike type interval training sprints,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s set too high and you&rsquo;re over striding, as it were,</p>
<p>the next day you can really pay the price</p>
<p>in terms of some back pain or sciatica.</p>
<p>And sometimes that pain can extend for quite a while.</p>
<p>So of course you don&rsquo;t want to approach any exercise</p>
<p>with so much caution that it&rsquo;s neurotic and preventative,</p>
<p>and yet you don&rsquo;t want to approach any exercise</p>
<p>in any way that&rsquo;s so cavalier, forgive the pun, Jeff,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re also going to compromise</p>
<p>the integrity of your joints and musculature</p>
<p>and connective tissue.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about some real world practical variables.</p>
<p>For instance, let&rsquo;s say you get a poor</p>
<p>to terrible night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Should you train the next day or not?</p>
<p>Well, that really depends.</p>
<p>I can honestly say I&rsquo;ve had some</p>
<p>of the best training sessions,</p>
<p>resistance training or endurance training sessions</p>
<p>after a really poor night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the rare event.</p>
<p>More often than not, if I&rsquo;m not sleeping well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a terrible night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>the next day I will just skip training that day.</p>
<p>I know that will shock a number of you out there,</p>
<p>or perhaps you&rsquo;re already calling me names,</p>
<p>weak, et cetera,</p>
<p>but I find that if I&rsquo;ve slept really poorly</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve had a very stressful event the day before</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t sleep well,</p>
<p>training the next day sets me up for getting ill</p>
<p>and getting ill sets me up for not being able to train</p>
<p>for multiple days.</p>
<p>So it is my preference in that case to skip a day</p>
<p>and really focus on recovery.</p>
<p>And then, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>slide that workout to the next day</p>
<p>and rarely double that workout up with another workout,</p>
<p>but then just slide the schedule forward by a day.</p>
<p>But I really try and strive,</p>
<p>I really try to double up at least some workouts</p>
<p>later in the week in that case</p>
<p>so that I can get back on schedule</p>
<p>of starting the seven-day protocol again on the same day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be excessively vague there.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is</p>
<p>I try and adhere to the same schedule,</p>
<p>but if I get a poor night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just simply skip the workout the next day,</p>
<p>slide the workout forward.</p>
<p>There is one exception to that,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an important exception,</p>
<p>which is there are times when I&rsquo;ve not slept well</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve had some particularly stressful event</p>
<p>the day before and haven&rsquo;t slept well,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m able to do so-called NSDR,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest the next day.</p>
<p>So there have been times when I&rsquo;ve only got</p>
<p>three or four hours of sleep the night before,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m feeling really behind the ball the next morning.</p>
<p>I really want to get my workout in,</p>
<p>so instead what I will do is a 10,</p>
<p>but ideally in that case,</p>
<p>a 30 or even 60 minutes non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a 10-minute non-sleep deep rest protocol</p>
<p>read by me,</p>
<p>but it is a non-spiritual, non-mystical,</p>
<p>science-supported non-sleep deep rest protocol</p>
<p>available on YouTube.</p>
<p>You can simply put my name, Huberman,</p>
<p>put NSDR and Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N,</p>
<p>into YouTube and you&rsquo;ll find that script.</p>
<p>There are other NSDR scripts that you can find now</p>
<p>on Spotify and on YouTube.</p>
<p>And if you fall asleep during those</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest scripts, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, you will also find</p>
<p>that it will restore your ability</p>
<p>to perform mental and physical work.</p>
<p>So there are times when I haven&rsquo;t gotten</p>
<p>as much sleep as I would like,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m feeling a bit more stressed for whatever reason,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll do NSDR and then I will go train.</p>
<p>And that often works fabulously well for me.</p>
<p>And then I don&rsquo;t have to skip a workout entirely</p>
<p>just because I didn&rsquo;t get a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask whether or not</p>
<p>you should train fasted or fed.</p>
<p>And this is a very controversial area.</p>
<p>I personally prefer to do my cardiovascular work</p>
<p>not having eaten anything in the previous</p>
<p>three to 10 hours.</p>
<p>And typically that&rsquo;s because I wake up</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll do the cardiovascular training</p>
<p>within about an hour of waking up,</p>
<p>or sometimes later because my first meal generally falls,</p>
<p>generally, not always, falls around 11 a.m.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do any kind of formal intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>but typically my meal schedule somewhere between 11 a.m.</p>
<p>and my last bite of food is around 8 p.m.,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not super strict about that.</p>
<p>I might eat as late as 9 p.m.</p>
<p>and I might eat something at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>If I wake up really hungry,</p>
<p>I might have something before 11 a.m.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not neurotic about it.</p>
<p>But in terms of training, I like to train fasted,</p>
<p>and that includes the resistance training workouts,</p>
<p>and those come early in the day for me.</p>
<p>And typically if I&rsquo;m going to train legs on Monday,</p>
<p>for instance, which is when I train legs,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make sure that the night before</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ingesting some starch, some carbohydrate,</p>
<p>like rice or pasta or something of that sort</p>
<p>to make sure that when I do that morning leg workout,</p>
<p>I have enough glycogen in the muscles, et cetera.</p>
<p>Again, nutrition is a somewhat controversial area.</p>
<p>In fact, it can evoke very strong feelings</p>
<p>because I know we&rsquo;ve got vegans and we&rsquo;ve got omnivores</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got carnivores and people who are keto.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t really the format for us to get into all of that.</p>
<p>I think the rule to follow is figure out</p>
<p>what optimizes your training</p>
<p>for your particular training goals.</p>
<p>For me, that most often means training fasted</p>
<p>and then eating pretty soon after I train.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a high-intensity resistance training workout,</p>
<p>and frankly, all of my resistance training workouts</p>
<p>are pretty high intensity,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to failure on every set,</p>
<p>but at least say about 30% of those sets,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to failure.</p>
<p>And the other sets I&rsquo;m working very hard nonetheless.</p>
<p>Well, then I eat some starches after I train</p>
<p>and I also ingest some protein</p>
<p>in the form of a protein drink or a meal</p>
<p>that includes some protein food.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t like to eat before I do resistance training</p>
<p>or at least not within the hour or two</p>
<p>before I do resistance training.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to that.</p>
<p>And I should say that the same basically applies</p>
<p>to endurance work.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to head out for a run,</p>
<p>typically I don&rsquo;t want my belly full of food</p>
<p>or any food at all.</p>
<p>But there are times where I wake up hungry</p>
<p>and I very much need to eat something</p>
<p>or I have something scheduled socially like a breakfast</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll have that breakfast.</p>
<p>And then an hour or 90 minutes later, I&rsquo;ll do my workout</p>
<p>because I want to make sure that I finish the workout.</p>
<p>I, again, am not neurotically attached</p>
<p>to training fasted or fed.</p>
<p>For me, fasted is preferred,</p>
<p>but if I have to train fed,</p>
<p>better to train than to not train at all.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked so much about flexibility yet,</p>
<p>but we did an entire episode</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast on flexibility.</p>
<p>And I encourage you to check out that episode</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in increasing your flexibility.</p>
<p>But the basic takeaway from that episode</p>
<p>is that if you look at what I like to call</p>
<p>the center of mass of the research,</p>
<p>that is most of the studies and what the conclusions</p>
<p>of most of the quality studies point to.</p>
<p>So not the exceptions, but the kind of general rules</p>
<p>that have been gleaned over time from multiple labs,</p>
<p>over multiple decades, et cetera.</p>
<p>What you find is that static stretching,</p>
<p>that is holding a stretch and in fact,</p>
<p>exhaling and relaxing the midsection and torso</p>
<p>and relaxing into the stretch</p>
<p>as opposed to staying full of air and tense,</p>
<p>but mentally and physically relaxing into the stretch,</p>
<p>but not stretching maximally.</p>
<p>That is not extending as far as you possibly can go,</p>
<p>but more like 60% or even less.</p>
<p>And then holding those static stretches</p>
<p>for anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds and then repeating,</p>
<p>doing that two or three times throughout the week</p>
<p>for multiple muscle groups.</p>
<p>So it could be for your quadriceps,</p>
<p>could be for hamstrings, for your lats.</p>
<p>There are protocols out there.</p>
<p>In fact, we have a newsletter that is focused entirely</p>
<p>on protocols for flexibility and stretching.</p>
<p>You can find that again by going hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need to sign up for the newsletter,</p>
<p>although we invite you to if you like,</p>
<p>but you can simply go there,</p>
<p>scroll down to the flexibility newsletter</p>
<p>and all the protocols are there</p>
<p>for each of the muscle groups, et cetera.</p>
<p>But what I typically try and do is some stretching</p>
<p>in the evening because I train in the morning</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m perhaps getting ready for bed,</p>
<p>or if the TV is on, which in our house</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t typically go on because we don&rsquo;t have a TV,</p>
<p>but of course there are computers</p>
<p>and people are on their computers, et cetera.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll try and do some stretching while I do that.</p>
<p>I also have a standing desk.</p>
<p>So during the day at work,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not I train that morning or not,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to train in the afternoon,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try and do some static stretching for my hamstrings,</p>
<p>my quads, my lats, my shoulders, my back,</p>
<p>really doesn&rsquo;t take much time.</p>
<p>And I really try to space that out throughout the week,</p>
<p>which if you look at the peer reviewed research,</p>
<p>matches well to what&rsquo;s known to be most effective,</p>
<p>which are going to be short repeated sessions,</p>
<p>ideally every day.</p>
<p>But truth told, I fail, I categorically fail.</p>
<p>I was about to think of whether</p>
<p>or not I ever stretch every day.</p>
<p>I fail to do it every day,</p>
<p>but I get about three or so stretching sessions</p>
<p>in per week.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s just static hold,</p>
<p>trying to really relax into the stretch.</p>
<p>Now, the relaxing to the stretch is something</p>
<p>has been talked about in martial arts circles.</p>
<p>And Pavel Satsulin has an excellent book on stretching.</p>
<p>We can provide a link to that.</p>
<p>Talks about this,</p>
<p>has a lot to do with relaxation of the nervous system</p>
<p>and the way that the nerves innervate muscles</p>
<p>and allow for stretch, if you will.</p>
<p>Also the way that the tendons and ligaments</p>
<p>are innervated by nerves.</p>
<p>The converse is also true.</p>
<p>And here, again, this is a principle</p>
<p>that Pavel has put forth.</p>
<p>I believe he calls it irradiation,</p>
<p>meaning irradiating out or emanating out from a source,</p>
<p>which is that while exhaling and relaxing the torso,</p>
<p>the midsection, some people call it the core,</p>
<p>although some people don&rsquo;t like that term,</p>
<p>can facilitate relaxation and stretching</p>
<p>through a larger range of motion.</p>
<p>So too can contracting the core, the midsection,</p>
<p>or gripping very tightly with the fist</p>
<p>can facilitate muscular contraction</p>
<p>because of the way that the nervous system heavily,</p>
<p>we can even say over represents the fists in the brain.</p>
<p>And so how would you apply this</p>
<p>to your overall foundational fitness protocol?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re doing a movement</p>
<p>that involves one limb moving and then the other,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s bicep curls, just for sake of example.</p>
<p>It turns out that you will actually be stronger</p>
<p>in moving that dumbbell</p>
<p>with the arm that happens to be moving</p>
<p>if you grip the handle very tightly,</p>
<p>but also grip the handle</p>
<p>of the opposite dumbbell very tightly.</p>
<p>Now that said, in between sets,</p>
<p>I encourage you to do the opposite,</p>
<p>to try and completely relax in between sets,</p>
<p>combine that with the physiological side.</p>
<p>And then when the next set commences,</p>
<p>employ that very strong grip,</p>
<p>both again of the weight that&rsquo;s moving</p>
<p>and the weight that at that moment might be stationary</p>
<p>or in isometric position.</p>
<p>So the nervous system, of course,</p>
<p>is what controls muscles</p>
<p>and that operates in both directions.</p>
<p>If you want to relax, try and use long exhales,</p>
<p>maybe even physiological size,</p>
<p>and really concentrate on mentally and physically relaxing,</p>
<p>in particular, your core and your fists.</p>
<p>And if you want to generate force,</p>
<p>and you want to move a heavy barbell or dumbbell,</p>
<p>you want to do a chin up with the maximal force,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you can employ the opposite,</p>
<p>which would be to grip the bar or dumbbell, et cetera,</p>
<p>very tightly.</p>
<p>And you want to contract your core</p>
<p>or even fill your body with air</p>
<p>as they say, plug all the leaks, et cetera.</p>
<p>So this gets into kind of form and movement,</p>
<p>which is an extensive near infinite landscape of discussion,</p>
<p>again, that we don&rsquo;t have time to go into.</p>
<p>I just want to mention those two nervous system</p>
<p>related tips, because I suppose as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>they appeal to me because they are grounded</p>
<p>in fundamental principles</p>
<p>of how the nervous system innervates muscle.</p>
<p>And I know that they will benefit you</p>
<p>the first time you use them and every time.</p>
<p>Speaking of grip and nervous system</p>
<p>and fitness and longevity,</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Atiyah, who is a medical doctor,</p>
<p>was a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>and provided an enormous wealth of information</p>
<p>on that podcast episode.</p>
<p>I really encourage you to check it out when you have time.</p>
<p>And of course has his own spectacular podcast,</p>
<p>The Drive with Peter Atiyah.</p>
<p>Peter, Dr. Atiyah, I should say,</p>
<p>often talks about certain movements</p>
<p>or exercises that you should perform,</p>
<p>not just to improve your fitness,</p>
<p>but also to touch into or measure how fit you are</p>
<p>and how well you are progressing</p>
<p>toward a long lifespan and healthspan.</p>
<p>And one of those includes the ability to hang from a bar</p>
<p>for a minute or longer.</p>
<p>And there are a number of different expectations</p>
<p>that one can have of how long they should be able</p>
<p>to hang from a bar, depending on their age</p>
<p>and their fitness level, et cetera.</p>
<p>Please check out Dr. Atiyah&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>and his various social media sites</p>
<p>to get more information on that.</p>
<p>But what I can tell you is that if you&rsquo;re going to hang</p>
<p>from a bar and you want to hang from that bar</p>
<p>as long as possible, which turns out to be a interesting</p>
<p>and important metric of your health,</p>
<p>then gripping the bar very tightly will actually help.</p>
<p>Earlier, we talked about whether or not to train</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re sleep deprived and how to recover</p>
<p>from what I would say is moderate sleep deprivation</p>
<p>by doing NSDR as opposed to total sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>like being up all night or having a truly miserable night,</p>
<p>which case I think you should just skip training</p>
<p>the next day and slide it forward.</p>
<p>Now, a similar issue comes up from time to time</p>
<p>where people wonder whether or not they should train</p>
<p>or not if they are sick.</p>
<p>Here, there&rsquo;s all sorts of crazy gym lore</p>
<p>and sport specific lore.</p>
<p>For instance, I used to hear this.</p>
<p>When I ran cross country, there was this adage</p>
<p>that if the symptoms were from the neck up,</p>
<p>you could still train.</p>
<p>That is, if you were really congested</p>
<p>and you had a headache, you could still run.</p>
<p>Whereas if it was in your chest and in your lungs,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t run.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any data whatsoever to support</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s true or whether it&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>for myself and because my general goal</p>
<p>is to be training and fit over time,</p>
<p>but also to include general health in the fitness equation,</p>
<p>that is to not be sick or chronically sick</p>
<p>and certainly not to get other people sick.</p>
<p>If I have a little tiny sniffle,</p>
<p>like I think I might be getting sick,</p>
<p>even then I&rsquo;m a little cautious in the sense</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not going to do my typical workout.</p>
<p>I might stop it about 15 minutes earlier</p>
<p>and I would do that not by neglecting any body parts</p>
<p>or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a weight training workout,</p>
<p>by simply reducing the total number of sets,</p>
<p>I probably wouldn&rsquo;t do any sets to failure.</p>
<p>If I did, I might reduce the total number</p>
<p>or percentage of sets to failure from about 30% of sets</p>
<p>to maybe closer to 10% of sets, something like that.</p>
<p>And if it was endurance work,</p>
<p>I might throttle back by 10 or 20%.</p>
<p>And I will shorten the total duration of the workout.</p>
<p>And I often find that because of the known,</p>
<p>yes, peer reviewed,</p>
<p>known immune system enhancing effects of exercise,</p>
<p>sometimes that alone will allow me to avoid getting sick.</p>
<p>But of course, I&rsquo;m also careful to get home,</p>
<p>take a hot shower, not stress myself out if I can,</p>
<p>avoid getting myself stressed out and focus on sleep and SDR</p>
<p>other forms of recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.</p>
<p>If however, I have a real sniffle, a cold,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not feeling well,</p>
<p>or I think I might be coming down with a flu,</p>
<p>I absolutely do not train.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t get back into training of any kind</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;m completely recovered.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m basically saying is that,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t believe you should train if you&rsquo;re sick.</p>
<p>And perhaps equally importantly,</p>
<p>when you come back from a layoff of any kind,</p>
<p>whether or not because of illness or for whatever reason,</p>
<p>I do believe that because your body is a bit untrained,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not ideal to jump right back into maximal training</p>
<p>and to take one, maybe two weeks of ramping up</p>
<p>to the full duration and intensity of workouts</p>
<p>that then I would continue on going</p>
<p>for however many cycles I can complete</p>
<p>before I hit another sickness</p>
<p>or I hit another gap in my schedule</p>
<p>due to family obligations or other obligations, et cetera.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of tools and protocols</p>
<p>and variables related to fitness,</p>
<p>but we have by no means covered all the available tools</p>
<p>and protocols and variables.</p>
<p>Before we wrap up, I do want to emphasize one tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very easy, in fact, zero cost,</p>
<p>very low time commitment tool.</p>
<p>And this was one that was provided again by Dr. Andy Galpin</p>
<p>when he was on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a tool that there&rsquo;s excellent research</p>
<p>to support the effectiveness of,</p>
<p>and that I do believe should come at the end</p>
<p>of every training session.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s to do three to five minutes</p>
<p>of deliberately slow breathing.</p>
<p>It sounds so simple,</p>
<p>three to five minutes of deliberately slowed breathing.</p>
<p>So this could be while you&rsquo;re in the shower</p>
<p>or when you arrive at your car,</p>
<p>you might sit in your car quietly and do that</p>
<p>if you have time, or maybe even while you&rsquo;re driving</p>
<p>back to or onto your next destination,</p>
<p>just to really slow down your breathing,</p>
<p>to really look at the recovery period</p>
<p>that has to follow each training session.</p>
<p>And of course, during which the adaptations,</p>
<p>the changes that make you more fit</p>
<p>than you were going into the exercise occur.</p>
<p>And that three to five minutes</p>
<p>of deliberately slowed breathing has been shown</p>
<p>in Andy&rsquo;s group and in related experiments,</p>
<p>not exactly the same, but related experiments</p>
<p>in our laboratory and in other laboratories</p>
<p>to really so-called downshift the nervous system</p>
<p>and really set you up for maximal recovery,</p>
<p>rapid recovery, and allow you to lean</p>
<p>into the next training session with full intensity</p>
<p>when that training session eventually arrives.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very simple tool,</p>
<p>but a very potent tool for your overall fitness.</p>
<p>So thank you for joining me for this discussion</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;m calling a foundational,</p>
<p>or I guess we could even get bold</p>
<p>and call it an optimal fitness protocol.</p>
<p>Although the word optimal is a tricky one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real optimal fitness protocol.</p>
<p>And today, what I&rsquo;ve really tried to focus on</p>
<p>is this foundational protocol,</p>
<p>because it does allow you to check off most,</p>
<p>if not all the boxes related to strength,</p>
<p>endurance, hypertrophy, speed, power, flexibility.</p>
<p>It will also teach you how to regulate your nervous system</p>
<p>up and down, that is to ramp up and focus,</p>
<p>mind muscle link, et cetera,</p>
<p>and then quickly calm down physiological size,</p>
<p>three to five minute decompressed breathing</p>
<p>at the end of training, et cetera.</p>
<p>Really, even though I talked about the protocol</p>
<p>that I follow, and again, that we will provide</p>
<p>as a newsletter at hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>if you want to look at it in more detail.</p>
<p>Even though we talked about it in the context</p>
<p>of what I do, again, I really want to emphasize</p>
<p>that this protocol and the description of this protocol</p>
<p>and all its variables, it&rsquo;s really for you</p>
<p>and for you to tailor to your specific needs.</p>
<p>So please take the protocol into consideration,</p>
<p>but do not treat it as wholly,</p>
<p>treat it as a starting point from which you can adapt it</p>
<p>to your specific fitness needs.</p>

<p>Not so much today, but in many previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talk about supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like enhancing sleep and focus</p>
<p>and hormone optimization.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>

<p>So thank you for joining me today for our discussion</p>
<p>about building your optimal toolkit for fitness.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
