<p>second i mean i know that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>ridiculous notion</p>
<p>but would that be the saddest fucking way to get</p>
<p>did you hear</p>
<p>about that one</p>
<p>woman that got pregnant she blew a guy</p>
<p>and she got stabbed</p>
<p>okay and somehow another in the</p>
<p>knife wound</p>
<p>the fucking sperm</p>
<p>got into her uterus</p>
<p>and fertilized her egg</p>
<p>that is the or her</p>
<p>ovaries right</p>
<p>what kind of kids whatever</p>
<p>wherever the eggs are</p>
<p>what kind of</p>
<p>kid is that</p>
<p>gonna turn into</p>
<p>could you imagine that</p>
<p>well the crazy</p>
<p>thing is i think</p>
<p>there was something</p>
<p>nutty like she was born with no vagina</p>
<p>it was like the</p>
<p>whole thing was a</p>
<p>freak show it was in africa</p>
<p>i think i might be making this up</p>
<p>i think she was born</p>
<p>with no i remember this</p>
<p>she was born</p>
<p>with no vagina and she just run around i just</p>
<p>guess given dudes head the poor</p>
<p>young thing</p>
<p>this sounds like</p>
<p>the birth of a</p>
<p>comic book hero</p>
<p>he was born</p>
<p>in africa to a</p>
<p>woman with no vagina</p>
<p>from a gash in her</p>
<p>ovary at the</p>
<p>bottom on it is that the most like no one can talk shit</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re from that situation when you&rsquo;re at school</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>could you know kids</p>
<p>could be like my dad&rsquo;s a cop</p>
<p>yeah you know guys be like my dad&rsquo;s fireman</p>
<p>yeah and he</p>
<p>be like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know one knows she was just sucking dicks and</p>
<p>some loads survived and someone</p>
<p>stabbed her</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t even have a vagina</p>
<p>there was no exit for that oh</p>
<p>my god what a fucking shitty roll the dice</p>
<p>if you really believe in karma</p>
<p>and you really believe that you are the product of</p>
<p>your past lives and who you are and what you what you</p>
<p>learned in those lives and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>carrying over and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>not everyone is equal</p>
<p>what the fuck did that guy</p>
<p>do well no and also like who is this vaginaless blowjob</p>
<p>woman in africa what is that yeah exactly</p>
<p>the poor girl</p>
<p>what a shit roll the dice man</p>
<p>who is you know who is that girl</p>
<p>what was she in another life</p>
<p>yeah i know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it that&rsquo;s one of the big questions is</p>
<p>cause if you do believe in</p>
<p>karma then you have to like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like people use that as a way to like</p>
<p>not not accept the universe</p>
<p>as being like a really brutal</p>
<p>place i get mad when people pretend that they</p>
<p>think they know how this</p>
<p>thing works</p>
<p>you know someone was trying to talk to me</p>
<p>about karma and he was talking to me</p>
<p>about how he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about crime ever</p>
<p>i go why he goes because</p>
<p>i just feel like if you don&rsquo;t put that out there it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come back at you i go that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous i go</p>
<p>babies and drive bys explain it</p>
<p>all right the baby putting that out there</p>
<p>is that what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>the baby&rsquo;s putting</p>
<p>that out there and the baby gets shot</p>
<p>listen motherfucker there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>random shit that goes down</p>
<p>okay this just because you might</p>
<p>have control over your</p>
<p>you know immediate environment most of the time yeah</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not you know the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s chaos man you can&rsquo;t tell me you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like why the</p>
<p>secret was so offensive to a lot of people</p>
<p>you know how that was</p>
<p>going on like you&rsquo;re telling me that all diseases and</p>
<p>everything that people will</p>
<p>those on themselves really for</p>
<p>real okay someone wills having a foot growing out of</p>
<p>their fucking head</p>
<p>people will you know</p>
<p>twins that are</p>
<p>stuck together with the</p>
<p>brain and share one</p>
<p>skull you know</p>
<p>come on man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a weak</p>
<p>thing because</p>
<p>the end result of that is it&rsquo;s like so</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m at the</p>
<p>beach and i&rsquo;m walking down the</p>
<p>beach and i turn and look at the miserable</p>
<p>woman pushing her</p>
<p>baby who&rsquo;s obviously like severely</p>
<p>mentally retarded and that baby&rsquo;s got tubes in its</p>
<p>mouth and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>drooling like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m supposed to look at that kid and think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting yours</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>what you deserve from the universe because in</p>
<p>a past life yeah what the fuck that&rsquo;s fucked up instead</p>
<p>of having empathy and</p>
<p>compassion for that kid</p>
<p>you can kind of be like no he</p>
<p>he deserved that yes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there appears to be a lot of</p>
<p>randomness man there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>randomness i mean</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t put your finger on it either way i mean we</p>
<p>might be wrong</p>
<p>it might really be that simple it</p>
<p>might really be that person did something incredibly</p>
<p>fucked up in another life i mean we don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>but it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem like that&rsquo;s a nice way to</p>
<p>think no and i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s also kind of a real</p>
<p>you know how</p>
<p>people who say if you talk to someone is</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t believe in god and then you ask them what</p>
<p>their definition of god is</p>
<p>then quite often</p>
<p>the god they don&rsquo;t believe in you shouldn&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like the guy with the beard and the</p>
<p>whatever and the toga but</p>
<p>for people who</p>
<p>they do the same</p>
<p>thing with reincarnation so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they turn it into this like</p>
<p>thing where you</p>
<p>were an animal or a person or whatever there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>the thing we talked about once</p>
<p>about reincarnation that&rsquo;s only one version of it</p>
<p>there could be a million different versions of how</p>
<p>the energy that your consciousness is</p>
<p>travels through the universe you know it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be through reincarnation or through</p>
<p>through the normal</p>
<p>sense maybe you</p>
<p>come from an alternate dimension before this one some</p>
<p>completely different</p>
<p>place something</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>octopuses floating around in some ether</p>
<p>that can communicate telepathically</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you came from why does it have to be from</p>
<p>earth or this planet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s retarded</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;ll tell you one of the</p>
<p>weirdest things</p>
<p>about the biggest dmt experience</p>
<p>that i ever had was</p>
<p>when i did it</p>
<p>when it first popped over to the other side</p>
<p>i said i&rsquo;ve been here before</p>
<p>it was like a very</p>
<p>clear feeling that i&rsquo;ve been there before</p>
<p>so the idea is</p>
<p>like maybe there&rsquo;s like a little waiting room</p>
<p>a waiting room for the universe that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>everything all connected and then</p>
<p>every now and then you just get</p>
<p>stuck into some sort of</p>
<p>a situation some</p>
<p>confined existence</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re working your way through this physical</p>
<p>world trying to make</p>
<p>sense of it</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll end this one and</p>
<p>pop out into the main</p>
<p>lobby area in the</p>
<p>waiting room and let&rsquo;s see what happens next time boom</p>
<p>something totally fucking</p>
<p>completely alien and different beyond your imagination</p>
<p>the confines</p>
<p>of our imagination is</p>
<p>based on what we&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>our whole collective idea what the</p>
<p>world is is</p>
<p>based on what we&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>even photographs and</p>
<p>things that we</p>
<p>have an experience but can see</p>
<p>things that are in the galaxy and planets and shit</p>
<p>we use these and we have this</p>
<p>whole map of our universe but that&rsquo;s just what we see</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>limited by our ability to</p>
<p>think outside what we&rsquo;ve already seen</p>
<p>the universe</p>
<p>could be infinitely</p>
<p>fucking bizarrely</p>
<p>complicated</p>
<p>to the point where</p>
<p>every different</p>
<p>dimension has its own laws and rules and</p>
<p>every different universe</p>
<p>exists in the center of</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>black hole like that</p>
<p>might be all real shit</p>
<p>like it might be so fucking infinite and</p>
<p>crazy and we</p>
<p>maybe can&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>well we shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>able to see it because it&rsquo;s so big there&rsquo;s no way we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>these little</p>
<p>tiny little bits of</p>
<p>neurology down here on this ball</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re supposed to be able to</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way we could</p>
<p>we could reckon with</p>
<p>infinity with</p>
<p>our limited minds but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird that it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>statement that</p>
<p>if you talk</p>
<p>about it people go oh yeah man space man</p>
<p>if you want to talk</p>
<p>about space man</p>
<p>wait shouldn&rsquo;t we be thinking</p>
<p>about that what am i doing i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>piloting this fucking</p>
<p>flesh vehicle</p>
<p>around this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some sort of a dimension filled with other</p>
<p>flesh vehicles</p>
<p>if i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what this was if i came from</p>
<p>no judgment whatsoever</p>
<p>just a total neutral</p>
<p>point and i looked at just</p>
<p>human behavior moving around on the planet</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t be like</p>
<p>this is the most</p>
<p>psychedelic shit ever</p>
<p>like just us</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like the craziest character in a fucking</p>
<p>movie when we landed into la the</p>
<p>other day we flew in from germany</p>
<p>we got in a</p>
<p>metal tube we flew from one side of the fucking planet</p>
<p>where it was 10</p>
<p>hours ahead in time</p>
<p>we flew all the way back to la</p>
<p>landed on the same day to these</p>
<p>lights and shit and</p>
<p>all these other</p>
<p>metal tubes are flying in from</p>
<p>everywhere and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>we are in the future</p>
<p>this is some</p>
<p>crazy fucking science fiction shit it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on right now</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even realize it</p>
<p>this whole world is</p>
<p>psychedelic yeah</p>
<p>it really is man it is yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy the craziest</p>
<p>thing is when you like come across flowers or nature</p>
<p>and you look at it and you&rsquo;re like alright this is a</p>
<p>fucking crazy if i had this</p>
<p>thing painted</p>
<p>right in my living room i</p>
<p>would like have a</p>
<p>panic attack and die yeah and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the most amazing</p>
<p>thing you could ever see ever yeah</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s also funny that</p>
<p>everyone on this planet or</p>
<p>many people on this planet</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re living their own</p>
<p>individual lives and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>completely free</p>
<p>but then when you go and look at the interstate</p>
<p>and you look at the way people like</p>
<p>move through the city you see it&rsquo;s just this like</p>
<p>blood stream of like stop go</p>
<p>right left stop go</p>
<p>right left and they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>person when you look at cars inside that car</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>their girlfriend or going to</p>
<p>their mom just died or they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re all having these</p>
<p>amazingly complex</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>and they all</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re the most important fucking thing</p>
<p>and yet even in the</p>
<p>midst of that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all operating exactly according to this</p>
<p>bizarre technological pulsation</p>
<p>stop go left</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like flying at</p>
<p>night it&rsquo;s like flying at</p>
<p>night looks like a circuit</p>
<p>board and it looks like</p>
<p>just lights</p>
<p>going through circuits and</p>
<p>stuff it looks exactly</p>
<p>like beyond the mind&rsquo;s eye too it really is i mean the</p>
<p>world is fractal</p>
<p>you know what you talked</p>
<p>about when you were talking</p>
<p>about flowers and gorgeous flowers</p>
<p>you know flowers and like beautiful</p>
<p>pine cones and shit they all follow the fibonacci</p>
<p>sequence you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s a mathematical sequence that is like</p>
<p>literally the</p>
<p>order of the earth</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>golden mean i believe</p>
<p>is what they call that i don&rsquo;t know what it is i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand math i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a math retard but this fibonacci</p>
<p>sequence they use to describe all</p>
<p>these fractals</p>
<p>beautiful fractals in nature</p>
<p>like like pine cones like certain flowers and trees and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like just like it&rsquo;s a part of the</p>
<p>structure of of of</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>literally like</p>
<p>i mean if you look at what it is it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a code like oh my god there&rsquo;s a code to this world</p>
<p>and then what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the code to that what&rsquo;s the code to each</p>
<p>individual part of you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the code to the pinecone what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the code to the tree what&rsquo;s the code to the planet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s eventually</p>
<p>gonna come down to we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have the code to</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna stand</p>
<p>understand everything</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna be able to recreate it</p>
<p>you know i read this</p>
<p>thing that ray kurzweil said</p>
<p>about how and</p>
<p>it was really fucking intense he said that</p>
<p>matter itself</p>
<p>is like code</p>
<p>like in the computer</p>
<p>your computer</p>
<p>right now is projecting</p>
<p>us or whatever and it&rsquo;s coming via some sort of code</p>
<p>in the same way like at the atomic level</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s just a code</p>
<p>and once computers</p>
<p>have accelerated to a certain rate</p>
<p>they will be</p>
<p>able to send nanobots out that will deconstruct</p>
<p>atoms and reassemble reality in the same</p>
<p>way computers deconstruct and reassemble pixels and</p>
<p>video and that sort of thing so</p>
<p>matter in reality itself will become</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like a</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what the word for it is</p>
<p>just a raw material</p>
<p>that you can use to</p>
<p>construct things</p>
<p>all you have to do is get like a hydrogen atom and</p>
<p>whatever atom and another atom</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have well we don&rsquo;t have nanobots and even if we did</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have an advanced enough computer that</p>
<p>could run this</p>
<p>swarm in that way</p>
<p>do that sort of</p>
<p>thing you know what i</p>
<p>think the next</p>
<p>thing is going to be</p>
<p>or one of the next</p>
<p>things going to be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be the ability to print</p>
<p>things in your</p>
<p>house that isn&rsquo;t paper</p>
<p>to make things</p>
<p>out of nothing</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have machines at a certain</p>
<p>point in time that are</p>
<p>gonna be able to actually</p>
<p>create something like ipods</p>
<p>right like if you</p>
<p>order an ipod</p>
<p>you turn your machine on and this is</p>
<p>gonna be the shit like look we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make an ipod</p>
<p>right now and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a huge</p>
<p>novelty just like the vhs tape was</p>
<p>when the vhs tape like holy shit we</p>
<p>could record tv shows oh yeah</p>
<p>yeah but nobody ever thought you</p>
<p>could stop it</p>
<p>take a leak</p>
<p>come back and watch it</p>
<p>you remember what a pimp you were</p>
<p>when you first recorded your</p>
<p>first tv show on a vcr with the clock</p>
<p>you used the</p>
<p>clock and you</p>
<p>came home and there was a tape waiting for you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like i&rsquo;m a fucking genius</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a wizard</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m living in the fucking future</p>
<p>dude that was a big deal</p>
<p>oh i remember when my friend got an answering machine</p>
<p>that was a crazy deal</p>
<p>right what&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>crazy is that&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start selling</p>
<p>things like they&rsquo;ll have bigger ones for bigger</p>
<p>things like oh i want a car and</p>
<p>stuff but then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get the hackers</p>
<p>of it they&rsquo;re like what do you want you want 10 camaros</p>
<p>right now 10 camaros</p>
<p>you know can&rsquo;t you imagine if we can just we have</p>
<p>the just unhindered ability to just</p>
<p>start printing shit and making</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s not a possibility that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be what time</p>
<p>travel is somehow</p>
<p>well you know</p>
<p>maybe get printed</p>
<p>dimensional</p>
<p>travel do a</p>
<p>changing of what</p>
<p>matter is if he</p>
<p>could just recreate matter</p>
<p>i mean you have</p>
<p>to have something to recreate it with the</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;d have to have raw materials well</p>
<p>no ink that you</p>
<p>would put into a printer you</p>
<p>would have to have i mean if you&rsquo;re constructing</p>
<p>reality you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>building something it&rsquo;d be dolphin</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be like fuck</p>
<p>so we have to use</p>
<p>bunny rabbits</p>
<p>just wrap your head around that</p>
<p>could you imagine you</p>
<p>would have to have</p>
<p>a certain amount</p>
<p>of minerals and a certain amount of carbon</p>
<p>and all these different</p>
<p>things in your house</p>
<p>and somehow or another you</p>
<p>would turn on this machine and</p>
<p>would just bang</p>
<p>print up this tv for you</p>
<p>unless you could</p>
<p>print the the fuel for it</p>
<p>you know like if it&rsquo;s some kind of mineral</p>
<p>it got so good</p>
<p>you a real pimp you</p>
<p>would have like a room like a big room like a garage</p>
<p>where you just</p>
<p>printed shit all the time</p>
<p>yeah my print me up a jaguar</p>
<p>check this shit out</p>
<p>fuck that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>printing up some ecstasy</p>
<p>i meant a cat i meant the actual cat</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t mean a car</p>
<p>i was saying it</p>
<p>while saying i was like what a poor choice of big pack</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a shitty car god that</p>
<p>could be a bad mistake it&rsquo;s not a shitty car</p>
<p>since i should that&rsquo;s a bad mistake it looked pretty</p>
<p>cool now jaguars actually look pretty dope now</p>
<p>i like how you have grasshoppers in here that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>homeboys been hit with me for</p>
<p>a day now that&rsquo;s cool it&rsquo;s like a little pet for you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna let him out eventually but i don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>freak him out when i&rsquo;m get comfortable he was all</p>
<p>locked up for a</p>
<p>while now it looks like he&rsquo;s moving</p>
<p>you should feed him what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feed him on a</p>
<p>date leaves</p>
<p>i think they have to eat the</p>
<p>leaves of the</p>
<p>you have to eat specific</p>
<p>yeah i think when bugs</p>
<p>start eating</p>
<p>leaves that&rsquo;s what they eat you know if they eat</p>
<p>one type that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they eat i think</p>
<p>might be just making that shit up you know</p>
<p>what i missed and they don&rsquo;t have out here is those</p>
<p>furry caterpillars</p>
<p>you remember the ones like they</p>
<p>look like little mustaches</p>
<p>yeah those things rule i know what they</p>
<p>do have out here a lot though praying mantises man i</p>
<p>see a lot of</p>
<p>those bad motherfuckers</p>
<p>to praying mantises are like</p>
<p>look if they were big we&rsquo;d be fucked yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re small</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it and we</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s cute</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a picture online</p>
<p>of a praying mantis so big that it jacked a hummingbird</p>
<p>i saw it oh yeah i saw the</p>
<p>video of that dude a fucking hummingbird</p>
<p>could you imagine this hummingbird</p>
<p>is cause they</p>

<p>world of warcraft couples</p>
<p>where they just play together</p>
<p>all day and all and that&rsquo;s their</p>
<p>whole life they&rsquo;ve</p>

<p>video games don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they get married and</p>
<p>oh yeah they</p>
<p>get married inside the</p>
<p>video games and then</p>
<p>yeah i mean we&rsquo;ve discussed</p>
<p>video games to</p>
<p>death but it is that is a fascinating</p>
<p>thing this desire to</p>
<p>exist in this two</p>
<p>dimensional online</p>
<p>world instead of the 3d reality</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weird pull</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird pull to wanna</p>
<p>i mean look i&rsquo;m guilty of being online all the time</p>
<p>like a lot of</p>
<p>times even when i&rsquo;m supposed to get work done</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m such a douchebag</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ll just turn on my computer and then i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>check twitter real quick</p>
<p>how is this</p>
<p>crazy link somebody sent me some</p>
<p>crazy science</p>
<p>video and i look at that and i go whoa</p>
<p>they found a new</p>
<p>black hole oh shit</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>hours later and i never even</p>
<p>started writing</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you just get sucked into it man how</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you though i mean it&rsquo;s like you try to get off</p>
<p>me like oh beatles on itunes yeah i mean it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>i can cheat on them</p>
<p>for saying you know why they into the</p>
<p>world of warcraft why am i into my message</p>
<p>board why am i into</p>
<p>going online and reading</p>
<p>cool document or</p>
<p>watching cool documentaries and reading</p>
<p>weird fucking</p>
<p>studies that they</p>
<p>found it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s a drug i got it</p>
<p>i was badly addicted to</p>
<p>world of warcraft</p>
<p>yeah we talked</p>
<p>about that you had um he would</p>
<p>break the games just i can&rsquo;t play them yeah yeah i</p>
<p>would yeah i</p>
<p>would fucking</p>
<p>well then i mean i had already gotten over my quake</p>
<p>thing when you were doing this</p>
<p>right it was</p>
<p>i mean the draw</p>
<p>the pull of that</p>
<p>game is so powerful</p>
<p>i finally um</p>
<p>i had like a</p>
<p>level 70 warlock</p>
<p>and i had to fucking</p>
<p>delete the character why didn&rsquo;t you sell it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what everyone says you</p>
<p>should have sold it but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>how much is that</p>
<p>worth in geek world</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know you get your dick sucked for that</p>
<p>yeah what do</p>
<p>you think there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>crazy goth bitch that</p>
<p>would suck your</p>
<p>dick to be a</p>
<p>level 70 warrior</p>
<p>what are you what is he</p>
<p>got what exactly was your</p>
<p>title again you&rsquo;re a what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called a warlock</p>
<p>a warlock level 70</p>
<p>level 70 that&rsquo;s huge</p>
<p>you could just fuck people</p>
<p>up right well</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>levels are up higher now but back then</p>
<p>it was definitely</p>
<p>fun now if a</p>
<p>chick bought this character</p>
<p>after she sucked your</p>
<p>dick if she sucked your dick and got this character yes</p>
<p>what happens then</p>
<p>does she get to be a warlock does she</p>
<p>get to be a dude can anybody be whatever sex you want</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where it is now i</p>
<p>think you can change the way it looks</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t know if you can change the gender but maybe</p>
<p>so she will</p>
<p>be your character she&rsquo;ll take over your character</p>
<p>you give her like the password</p>
<p>yes yeah and yeah you</p>
<p>would give her all the password and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden she would be infinitely</p>
<p>powerful without having</p>
<p>earned it you probably have to do</p>
<p>with the transfer</p>
<p>of ownership like go to a gamestop and both signed</p>
<p>papers if that&rsquo;s how you do it</p>
<p>no you think</p>
<p>you do it like that</p>
<p>oh my god well there has to be some</p>
<p>kind of transfer of ownership because then that person</p>
<p>would just say</p>
<p>this is my character yeah</p>
<p>now let me ask you this do they</p>
<p>allow that shit though they</p>
<p>allow people to do this i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>but why not</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>get prepared before you got on this podcast</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t believe i&rsquo;m kind of happy</p>
<p>that i don&rsquo;t remember this</p>
<p>why do you think they</p>
<p>would prevent that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve wondered that i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just another fascinating aspect of it i</p>
<p>guess maybe</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>would say that they</p>
<p>should get the</p>
<p>money if somebody got the</p>
<p>money but i</p>
<p>feel like if</p>
<p>a character invests all that time into the game and</p>
<p>they can show something</p>
<p>for it and they can sell that something that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going to make the game more popular i knew</p>
<p>somebody who was a</p>
<p>what do you call it</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t remember what they call them now the people who</p>
<p>the police of the game</p>
<p>that are kind of inside the game mods moderators</p>
<p>yeah not a much</p>
<p>yeah but in the game they call</p>
<p>something they</p>
<p>have characters and they can they go around</p>
<p>and they can appear and do</p>
<p>oh really yeah</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>indestructible</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re kind of like policing the</p>
<p>place they are like moderators yeah they&rsquo;re mods like</p>
<p>medicine message</p>
<p>board moderator</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing and they i actually</p>
<p>before i played</p>
<p>world of warcraft god this is i guess it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fucking the geek</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m a nerd i before i got addicted to</p>
<p>world of warcraft i got addicted to everquest</p>
<p>i got busted</p>
<p>i got busted in that game</p>
<p>by like a game cop</p>
<p>like i cause like</p>
<p>at the time it was</p>
<p>still kind of like</p>
<p>the wild west and they hadn&rsquo;t like really figured out</p>
<p>how to like regulate it as much as they have now and so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how it is an everquest now but</p>
<p>then you could like try on</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stuff they could give you</p>
<p>stuff and you</p>
<p>could try it on and it was like i am</p>
<p>i uh there was a guy who</p>
<p>had a really</p>
<p>everyone knew in this game</p>
<p>about some kind of like very</p>
<p>powerful vest</p>
<p>and so i went to that guy and i&rsquo;m like hey</p>
<p>let me try that vest on to see how i look in it</p>
<p>and he gives me the vest</p>
<p>and i just run into the woods</p>
<p>no yes i did</p>
<p>yes i did i</p>
<p>go racing into the woods i&rsquo;ve got this little care</p>
<p>a little character</p>
<p>halfling named hair pie</p>
<p>his name was hairpie</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m racing into the woods with this</p>
<p>thing and like</p>
<p>the guys like yelling</p>
<p>into the zone is what it&rsquo;s called like announcing</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t trust hairpie</p>
<p>he stole my vest of the thunder god</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a thief</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m running</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m running through the woods i lost him</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden i hear footsteps behind me</p>
<p>like invisible</p>
<p>footsteps and i&rsquo;m running and i&rsquo;m hearing like</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;m frozen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a game moderator he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you gotta give him his vest back</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t steal vests</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>steal like that i&rsquo;m like my character&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thief why not and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>read rule four ninety</p>
<p>eight and the tos</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>thief you should be a thief</p>
<p>you should be able to do whatever you want</p>
<p>i know what i</p>
<p>mean that&rsquo;s why i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>steal as a thief</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>grand theft auto is so good</p>
<p>if you want to be a murderer you can be a murderer yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a goddamn</p>
<p>game you can&rsquo;t i mean you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you like you hear</p>
<p>about it from time to time i just</p>
<p>heard about</p>
<p>somebody claiming that some of</p>
<p>their shit got</p>
<p>stolen on that</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t remember the name of the game</p>
<p>second life</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole economy in</p>
<p>second life</p>
<p>where people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t people</p>
<p>pick people pay rent to have shops there and</p>
<p>stuff i know</p>
<p>but then fuck but the moment they figure out</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s just such a primitive version of it like</p>
<p>do you remember</p>
<p>when you first got an</p>
<p>atari did you ever get an atari yeah</p>
<p>shittiest gaming</p>
<p>system of all time</p>
<p>but you felt like you are</p>
<p>on like in star trek when you were playing that fucking</p>
<p>thing like the kids pong</p>
<p>yeah pong looked</p>
<p>breakout remember</p>
<p>breakout yeah</p>
<p>combat adventure with the key the dragons in the key</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been having so many</p>
<p>holy shit that was only x amount of years ago morris</p>
<p>lately yeah</p>
<p>so now just think okay</p>
<p>what is the next version of this</p>
<p>stuff gonna be if you look at what</p>
<p>atari has turned into</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be</p>
<p>neurological</p>

<p>their next cd they just announced</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna be they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>their whole cd</p>
<p>on the ipad could you</p>
<p>imagine just 30 40 years ago how</p>
<p>about when elvis was on stage</p>
<p>how about one of</p>
<p>these fucking appears out of nowhere</p>
<p>and is dancing around</p>
<p>right next to elvis</p>
<p>right people</p>
<p>would start</p>
<p>shooting it yeah</p>
<p>you know you know i&rsquo;m saying let me just back then they</p>
<p>would be like what the fuck is that right</p>
<p>man we don&rsquo;t even realize how</p>
<p>quick this is all happening</p>
<p>no i mean no i</p>
<p>think that nobody&rsquo;s really prepared for and the</p>
<p>quicker it happens</p>
<p>the more i used to be like</p>
<p>bring it let it happen let the fucking singularity</p>
<p>pop let&rsquo;s go let&rsquo;s do the thing</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>shit i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>kinda like i&rsquo;m cool right here</p>
<p>life is so easy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a comic i&rsquo;m having fun yeah we don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>accelerate that much more listen let&rsquo;s not get</p>
<p>crazy everybody i&rsquo;m having a good time yeah</p>
<p>yeah we don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to zap through</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to all be</p>
<p>one yeah we don&rsquo;t have to merge</p>
<p>come on man but</p>
<p>i guess there&rsquo;s just no way to stop it</p>
<p>so i was flying back from</p>
<p>germany and i had this</p>
<p>crazy epiphany</p>
<p>about civilizations</p>
<p>cause i was you know i was leaving germany i</p>
<p>was like it&rsquo;s so strange when you go to another culture</p>
<p>you know and you don&rsquo;t have any idea</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s like god this is a different</p>
<p>world it&rsquo;s totally alien</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s songs that they had on</p>
<p>their tv shows</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all in german</p>
<p>they have played a lot of american</p>
<p>music though i gotta say</p>
<p>like a good percentage of it like</p>
<p>every now and then you&rsquo;d hear something with a german</p>
<p>voice or a german dialogue</p>
<p>but for the most part the lyrics</p>
<p>but for the most part it was all american shit</p>
<p>but the people</p>
<p>would talk to</p>
<p>you they&rsquo;d look at you and bulchner&rsquo;s not there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like whoa</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t have a fucking clue i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>i just i have no idea</p>
<p>and they would look at you like come on come on come on</p>
<p>like at the</p>
<p>airport when they&rsquo;re telling you to go over here</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re saying whatever crazy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like what where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking strange</p>
<p>thing man and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>about how bizarre</p>
<p>it is that there&rsquo;s so many different languages and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about how</p>
<p>weird it is</p>
<p>that some of</p>
<p>these cultures have been around forever</p>
<p>and then i start</p>
<p>thinking like</p>
<p>what the fuck happens</p>
<p>to all these different</p>
<p>cultures that have</p>
<p>existed before it pretty much is the same thing</p>
<p>they figure out how to create shelters</p>
<p>then they go from having shelters</p>
<p>to creating a surplus to having a</p>
<p>group of shelters</p>
<p>they all protect themselves from the animals</p>
<p>and then once enough to worry</p>
<p>about getting</p>
<p>eaten then they</p>
<p>start figuring</p>
<p>things out then they</p>
<p>start inventing</p>
<p>things and coming up with</p>
<p>things getting curious</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where they make a very complicated society that hums</p>
<p>along they have</p>
<p>immense structures and all</p>
<p>these cool things and then</p>
<p>all the people that did all this</p>
<p>crazy hard work</p>
<p>have kids and the kids are born into this perfect world</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t have to try to discover anything</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>create things because the</p>
<p>things are already existing</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to develop a</p>
<p>civilization out of scratch and figure out how to be</p>
<p>strong in the woods because there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these resources</p>
<p>they figured how to</p>
<p>write things down so they don&rsquo;t have to relearn shit</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like wow just people get soft</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the reason that</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>civilization eventually fell</p>
<p>apart you know</p>
<p>he talked about like</p>
<p>throughout history whenever</p>
<p>they would talk</p>
<p>about the fall of the</p>
<p>roman empire</p>
<p>the whole theme to it was always the decadence</p>
<p>and the depravity</p>
<p>and the crazy</p>
<p>sexual shit that they were doing</p>
<p>and how life</p>
<p>had just gotten insane for them they were all</p>
<p>living and eating insane amounts</p>
<p>of food and fucking little boys and having people</p>
<p>fight animals and shit</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s got to have come from a</p>
<p>place where</p>
<p>those people were weak</p>
<p>those people didn&rsquo;t have to put it all together</p>
<p>well yeah i</p>
<p>think specifically with the</p>
<p>roman empire</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m sure people out there</p>
<p>will correct me on this but</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t rome sacked by the visigoths who are these</p>
<p>brutal barbarians who just</p>
<p>came in and just raped and killed everybody and really</p>
<p>yeah and that brought in the dark ages and</p>
<p>the dark ages</p>
<p>what was bringing</p>
<p>civilization back out of the dark ages was</p>
<p>christianity religion religion was like creating at</p>
<p>least a little bit of order to</p>
<p>kind of like</p>
<p>bring people out of the dark but</p>
<p>all of a sudden the vikings</p>
<p>figured out</p>
<p>that all they had to do was go to a monastery</p>
<p>or a church and they</p>
<p>could just grab all the gold and shit and go off</p>
<p>basically the vikings discovered europe and</p>
<p>they came in and pushed it back into the dark ages</p>
<p>again because they were sacking everything and like</p>
<p>vikings are the most brutal</p>
<p>fucking they were the most brutal</p>
<p>humans ever because like</p>
<p>that one of the stories they told is there was a viking</p>
<p>who had this</p>
<p>funny nickname and i can&rsquo;t read the nickname but the</p>
<p>other vikings</p>
<p>laughed at him</p>
<p>they thought he was funny</p>
<p>because he wouldn&rsquo;t kill kids</p>
<p>they thought it was</p>
<p>funny and they had a nickname for him like you</p>
<p>pussy why are you killing these kids it&rsquo;s fucking fun</p>
<p>and they were just</p>
<p>going in hack</p>
<p>kids and hack</p>
<p>there were these</p>
<p>brutal fucking warriors</p>
<p>and so like you said</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with this kind of well at that time it was</p>
<p>starving people but before that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s these lazy fat</p>
<p>people who&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never really fought before at</p>
<p>least like fought in that brutal</p>
<p>level and they just got</p>
<p>so they just got</p>
<p>hit at the wrong time yeah exactly</p>
<p>had gotten hit back</p>
<p>when rome was</p>
<p>strong and before</p>
<p>everything fell</p>
<p>apart they probably</p>
<p>would have been able to hold</p>
<p>those guys off</p>
<p>is that the idea yeah and</p>
<p>i think i think that is the idea</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about the history</p>
<p>other than the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s connected</p>
<p>to it in popular myths it&rsquo;s always gluttony and</p>
<p>orgies of food and</p>
<p>the talk of feathers in the throat and</p>
<p>vomitoriums</p>
<p>where they would</p>
<p>throw up so they</p>
<p>could eat more yeah</p>
<p>yeah well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>i mean that usually is what happens is people</p>
<p>i mean really that isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that a symptom of people confusing what&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>with the material universe</p>
<p>because people</p>
<p>start trying to gratify</p>
<p>their senses</p>
<p>and really that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a distraction from what&rsquo;s really important and</p>
<p>so when that gets to the extreme</p>
<p>where everyone&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>focused on buying shit or</p>
<p>well i think it&rsquo;s a faulty</p>
<p>system that we have</p>
<p>and once the environment gets</p>
<p>super complicated it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>eventually everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna want to take time off they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna want to</p>
<p>not have to hunt and gather</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna want</p>
<p>things easier and</p>
<p>lighter and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna want more for</p>
<p>their kids i don&rsquo;t want my kids to struggle like me</p>
<p>and so then we want a softer</p>
<p>easier world to develop in but the problem with that is</p>
<p>humans ideas and</p>
<p>our best inventions have</p>
<p>come through hard work and adversity like people who</p>
<p>people who have worked very very hard to</p>
<p>think things through and figure</p>
<p>things out and invent new</p>
<p>things well when</p>
<p>everything is</p>
<p>already there and you don&rsquo;t have to do that</p>
<p>like what what happens then and then you have</p>
<p>kids and they see you then go look at this lazy fat</p>
<p>motherfucker why</p>
<p>should i do anything hard or</p>
<p>try to be anything special or try to</p>
<p>contribute or try to</p>
<p>figure things out or even try to be</p>
<p>happy nobody else is</p>
<p>happy what the fuck makes me</p>
<p>think that i</p>
<p>should be happy</p>
<p>well yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s you know i really</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s a result</p>
<p>of people losing track of</p>
<p>the greater</p>
<p>truth in the universe and so</p>
<p>i think the moment you</p>
<p>start tuning into that that&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>start getting the ideas that lead</p>
<p>to the inventions and lead to the hard work because</p>
<p>fucking hard work like you know</p>
<p>everyone says if you wanna</p>
<p>write a book</p>
<p>you gotta write six</p>
<p>hours a day you have to</p>
<p>treat it like a job you have to fucking</p>
<p>write all the fucking time</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>to really do that you&rsquo;ve got to be passionate</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>want to do it you have to be inspired the inspiration</p>
<p>drives you to work that hard</p>
<p>and so right</p>
<p>now no one&rsquo;s inspired most people have no inspiration</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not connecting to the</p>
<p>thing that brings</p>
<p>those big ideas into your head when</p>
<p>maybe when there isn&rsquo;t the internet and</p>
<p>technology and all that stuff</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more likely that</p>
<p>those ideas come to you or something like that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s also possibly</p>
<p>a situation</p>
<p>where the hardware has</p>
<p>evolved so quickly</p>
<p>that our life has</p>
<p>changed so radically that our</p>
<p>our physical</p>
<p>bodies just are not in tune to the reward</p>
<p>systems that we&rsquo;re getting from this society</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>supplement them with antidepressants and shit</p>
<p>our bodies are</p>
<p>designed for some hunting and gathering and fucking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what our</p>
<p>bodies are designed</p>
<p>for and if you don&rsquo;t exert a certain amount of energy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people get stressed</p>
<p>people who exercise are way more stress free</p>
<p>than people who</p>
<p>never exercise</p>
<p>because your body just accumulates all this</p>
<p>crazy shit that you&rsquo;re supposed to be</p>
<p>getting out of your</p>
<p>system you&rsquo;re supposed to be chasing down elk and shit</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to be</p>
<p>moving bales of</p>
<p>hay and if you&rsquo;re not doing all that</p>
<p>stuff you&rsquo;re like why do you even have muscle</p>
<p>bitch you just sit around the</p>
<p>house and jerk off</p>
<p>why do you even have you</p>
<p>should have enough muscle to get to the refrigerator</p>
<p>and back to the couch</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t need any</p>
<p>other muscle</p>
<p>it also seems</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a lot more calculations in math</p>
<p>going on too because if you think</p>
<p>about even 15 years ago you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thinking about twitter numbers you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>facebook numbers you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thinking about online</p>
<p>stuff and bills and news and</p>
<p>you have so much information pumped that your</p>
<p>brain&rsquo;s constantly</p>
<p>thinking way</p>
<p>more than it was then back in the day was like oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>windy outside</p>
<p>that was ooh</p>
<p>this lemonade it&rsquo;s good i wonder if someone</p>
<p>could buy us beer</p>
<p>right but you know the</p>
<p>weird difference is that what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the numbers you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about red band</p>
<p>these are all illusions</p>
<p>people are spending all their time</p>
<p>calculating</p>
<p>these fitments</p>
<p>you know through</p>
<p>my bank account number how</p>
<p>much i owe how much did i am what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>score zeros are</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not what the fuck</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re imaginary or the</p>
<p>senator the congress</p>
<p>are the president or the government all imaginary</p>
<p>things that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>these ethereal</p>
<p>things out there when it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if you go into your backyard and dig and</p>
<p>plant seeds and grow something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>right you can look out there and see how many seeds or</p>
<p>plants you have growing up and that&rsquo;s fucking real</p>
<p>yeah what is the economy</p>
<p>just imaginary</p>
<p>quantitative easing and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna buy stock</p>
<p>shares and stock</p>
<p>trades and send them over to brochmanboth and</p>
<p>bimbernaki said he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna double the quantity</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what the fuck are you talking</p>
<p>about if land</p>
<p>was completely free though that</p>
<p>would be more of the case now</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know pay bills and live at some</p>
<p>place you get kicked</p>
<p>off land and there&rsquo;s no free land that&rsquo;s how it all</p>
<p>started is the native</p>
<p>the indians being like</p>
<p>you wanted you</p>
<p>wanna buy this land</p>
<p>what the fuck you talking</p>
<p>about yeah seven</p>
<p>bucks you can have manhattan</p>
<p>indiana you stupid</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>well you dumb</p>
<p>motherfucker well</p>
<p>the idea to them was</p>
<p>absolutely completely</p>
<p>ridiculous so now the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>is crisscrossed</p>
<p>all of society is crisscrossed with tiny</p>
<p>weird connections the deed to the</p>
<p>house and the land</p>
<p>under the house and</p>
<p>the certificate</p>
<p>of ownership of the</p>
<p>house and the</p>
<p>property tax you pay and all this it&rsquo;s all imaginary</p>
<p>shit none of it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>we all believe it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>not only to believe</p>
<p>we believe it&rsquo;s real but we&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>focused on it</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve forgotten</p>
<p>about what israel</p>
<p>which is the material universe</p>
<p>which is the</p>
<p>fucking water</p>
<p>and the ground and the environment</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just pumping shit out into it because that</p>
<p>stuff doesn&rsquo;t seem real</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a leisure</p>
<p>thing you go out for a hike in the woods on a sunday</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you go into nature you</p>
<p>maybe on occasion take the lady for a picnic</p>
<p>you know but that&rsquo;s how you go to nature</p>
<p>now you know and it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>novelty well look a tree</p>
<p>look at that tree</p>
<p>dude nobody realized that more than me when i actually</p>
<p>moved to the woods</p>
<p>when i was living in colorado</p>
<p>for those months</p>
<p>almost four months</p>
<p>and when i was living i was</p>
<p>basically living on a dirt road</p>
<p>on the mountain</p>
<p>like in the middle of nowhere like</p>
<p>literally completely</p>
<p>in the middle of nowhere and you see everything man</p>
<p>you see all this shit that&rsquo;s alive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just running</p>
<p>around out there and i see it out here i see a deer</p>
<p>every now and then out here</p>
<p>like coyotes all the time</p>
<p>and every now and then some will</p>
<p>see a mountain lion in this area</p>
<p>but in colorado</p>
<p>was all over the place</p>
<p>it was like you&rsquo;re in there</p>
<p>their area like they walked through town</p>
<p>there was this</p>
<p>place called evergreen</p>
<p>and every year the elk</p>
<p>would migrate through town</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about hundreds of these</p>
<p>giant animals they&rsquo;re like deer on steroids these</p>
<p>big fucking brock</p>
<p>lesnar looking deer</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re walking through the middle of town</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>they walk right on the streets</p>
<p>hundreds of them dude it&rsquo;s insane like this</p>
<p>giant migration of them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>and you know what goes with them mountain lions</p>
<p>right mountain</p>
<p>lions follow them ugh</p>
<p>so when they come around you</p>
<p>gotta worry</p>
<p>about mountain lions being around too fuck that</p>
<p>hell yeah anyways</p>
<p>that used to be life yeah one dude</p>
<p>shot one in his backyard</p>
<p>while i was living there</p>
<p>it it gotten into his chicken coop</p>
<p>and was jacking his chickens</p>
<p>you imagine that fucking terrifying moment</p>
<p>where you go outside and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>monster eating your chickens in a cage</p>
<p>and it clawed its</p>
<p>way into this cage and it&rsquo;s in there now and you gotta</p>
<p>shoot it before it eats you</p>
<p>right cause it</p>
<p>could eat you</p>
<p>it could say oh this is way better than a chicken</p>
<p>let me just eat this old person yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s real yeah if you don&rsquo;t get good with that finger</p>
<p>motherfucker you better</p>
<p>get good with that finger</p>
<p>you better have an aim bitch</p>
<p>but like our version of that is i got a parking</p>
<p>ticket you know</p>
<p>what i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like a negative</p>
<p>force impacting your life sort of but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a much more humbling and beautiful</p>
<p>force that makes you</p>
<p>appreciate your real</p>
<p>place in the circle</p>
<p>you know when i was living up there what i really</p>
<p>loved about it is that i</p>
<p>would go to new york and shit and i was like</p>
<p>when i first started moving there</p>
<p>when i first moved there</p>
<p>i did the open anthony show</p>
<p>and i stayed in this</p>
<p>hotel in new york</p>
<p>at this crazy view</p>
<p>and i looked out the window and i was like how</p>
<p>weird is this that i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>right now i&rsquo;m on the death star</p>
<p>and i live with fucking</p>
<p>grizzly adams up in the woods that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m living right now like this is</p>
<p>my new place</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m going from the wilderness</p>
<p>cities and wilderness</p>
<p>to la a couple times the wilderness to different</p>
<p>places where i did stand up</p>
<p>and i was like this is one of the fucking strangest</p>
<p>ways to look at</p>
<p>things ever</p>
<p>because now i&rsquo;m getting at you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m looking at the whole</p>
<p>world from the outside i live on dirt</p>
<p>i live on dirt</p>
<p>with trees that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s around you</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re like that and you&rsquo;re in this</p>
<p>really tight</p>
<p>little small community up there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very very few people</p>
<p>you get a totally different view of the</p>
<p>whole world</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all going on in</p>
<p>saudi arabia</p>
<p>you know in iraq there&rsquo;s issues</p>
<p>right now with bombs and shit&rsquo;s blowing up and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re starting</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>mecca they&rsquo;re all making</p>
<p>their pilgrimage to mecca</p>
<p>and all this is all</p>
<p>going on the news</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll just look out and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>still a little chipmunks and shit</p>
<p>chipmunks are just</p>
<p>chilling yeah</p>
<p>chipmunks don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about iraq and afghanistan</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nowhere near here</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like what are you</p>
<p>tripping on dude</p>
<p>just relax we&rsquo;re chipmunks</p>
<p>people are trying to eat us and we&rsquo;re cool yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s an experience</p>
<p>with something called health</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it feels like to be healthy</p>
<p>it feels like</p>
<p>it feels like to be we are so connected i</p>
<p>think with our physical hardware our bodies</p>
<p>that are set up for the caveman days</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so connected with what our</p>
<p>bodies need</p>
<p>that if we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>completely plugged into the system</p>
<p>i think our</p>
<p>whole shit is getting</p>
<p>rewired like in this</p>
<p>weird like super</p>
<p>quick way because</p>
<p>we have to keep up with all the bullshit that you have</p>
<p>to be aware of in life</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have this</p>
<p>peaceful time</p>
<p>that people used to have</p>
<p>like you know people were hunters and gathers and shit</p>
<p>when when they were fucking made</p>
<p>houses and they</p>
<p>figured out how to make fireplaces and shit</p>
<p>at the end of the night</p>
<p>after they killed an animal in the center on eating it</p>
<p>they were fucking relaxed</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t owe anybody shit</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re stressing</p>
<p>about things that we didn&rsquo;t stress</p>
<p>about well we&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>sickness and like oh there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>blizzard in our</p>
<p>houses it&rsquo;s way better to be</p>
<p>alive now i&rsquo;m not saying that there&rsquo;s a guy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>definitely right</p>
<p>about that there&rsquo;s a guy there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an anarchist that you can look up and his name is</p>
<p>john zurzan</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a fascinating guy is very intelligent</p>
<p>and he talks</p>
<p>about his premises</p>
<p>actually no</p>
<p>those times were terrible</p>
<p>but before that and the distant past before people</p>
<p>started using language</p>
<p>or symbol systems to represent reality</p>
<p>we were in paradise</p>
<p>when we were</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t buy that man that&rsquo;s so speculative and</p>
<p>the problem i have with that is if we were in paradise</p>
<p>why did it all turn to shit</p>
<p>i think people have this romantic way of looking at the</p>
<p>past and i guarantee you if you fucking go to the zoo</p>
<p>and see how douchey chimps are to each</p>
<p>other you know</p>
<p>watch documentaries</p>
<p>about chimps</p>
<p>sneaking across lines and beating the fuck out of</p>
<p>other chimps and killing them</p>
<p>and then coming back to</p>
<p>their little</p>
<p>look man i&rsquo;m not buying it</p>
<p>we evolved because of competition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for the most part the only reason why</p>
<p>things get better they get better because</p>
<p>they have to because</p>
<p>everything else is getting better around them</p>
<p>so if we were in paradise</p>
<p>why the fuck</p>
<p>would we come up with language and fuck it up i</p>
<p>agree with you i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with zur zan i just</p>
<p>throwing it out</p>
<p>there but things get infinitely</p>
<p>more complex as things go</p>
<p>along it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna happen it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the ethic of the universe</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that at one</p>
<p>point in time when it wasn&rsquo;t as complex it was better</p>
<p>the golden age yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re crazy</p>
<p>mckenna talks</p>
<p>about that a little bit though</p>
<p>his is psychedelically induced though</p>
<p>which is much more plausible theory the idea</p>
<p>his idea is that mckenna thought that at one</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>the monkeys had gone and the climate had</p>
<p>changed and the rainforest had receded to</p>
<p>grasslands so the</p>
<p>monkeys were</p>
<p>climbing out of the trees</p>
<p>and experimenting</p>
<p>with different food sources and one of them was they</p>
<p>would flip over cow patties to find bugs</p>
<p>stoned ape and they</p>
<p>ate mushrooms and they developed</p>
<p>but that one is</p>
<p>based on like an actual</p>
<p>plant that exists</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>and so like an actual time where the</p>
<p>rainforest did receive this is all fact it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>science and they know that</p>
<p>monkeys have</p>
<p>eaten mushrooms man they know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of different</p>
<p>instances of all sorts of animals eating all sorts of</p>
<p>things that affect</p>
<p>their consciousness</p>
<p>like elephants will get used to like fermented</p>
<p>fruit and they get</p>
<p>drunk off of</p>
<p>it i&rsquo;ve seen it</p>
<p>happens with monkeys if</p>
<p>they get used to booze</p>
<p>somebody posted on my facebook</p>
<p>a great video of orangutans</p>
<p>david attenborough</p>
<p>showing orangutans washing</p>
<p>socks in a river</p>
<p>one of them is trying to saw a</p>
<p>piece of wood</p>
<p>one of them&rsquo;s got a hammer and it&rsquo;s hitting a nail</p>
<p>kind of looks like in</p>
<p>dawn of the dead when the zombies</p>
<p>try to do shit you know like they&rsquo;re kind of doing it</p>
<p>wrong but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>definitely like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re imitating</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like look it up</p>
<p>david attenborough</p>
<p>orangutans i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like you look at that</p>
<p>and you see how quickly</p>
<p>the orangutans are adopting</p>
<p>these sort of</p>
<p>behavior patterns from what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching and you can see how</p>
<p>quickly it would all fucking happen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>trick and they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>trained monkeys and that</p>
<p>orangutans and they&rsquo;re like all</p>
<p>right now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be hammering here yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>first thing he said is</p>
<p>these are not</p>
<p>trained monkeys</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just imitating</p>
<p>a liar how do you know</p>
<p>brian i said</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>liar it&rsquo;s good david</p>
<p>no he&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>liar the whole</p>
<p>thing is fascinating man</p>
<p>i think the idea of</p>
<p>evolution happening</p>
<p>right before our eyes is fascinating</p>
<p>there was a lizard that was i fucking forget the</p>
<p>exact story but it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>clear evolution and the change of its</p>
<p>stomach because it was on an island for 20 years</p>
<p>they came from one environment they had to</p>
<p>adapt to a new one but they</p>
<p>adapted like</p>
<p>super quick and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still there</p>
<p>alive with like a very</p>
<p>clear difference between the lizards that had come</p>
<p>from the original origin</p>
<p>original source</p>
<p>you know i mean the congo</p>
<p>is another perfect example of that you know the congo</p>
<p>like 2 000 years ago the congo was</p>
<p>grasslands and</p>
<p>the climate</p>
<p>shifted very</p>
<p>quickly and all</p>
<p>these prairie</p>
<p>or plains animals</p>
<p>like gazelles</p>
<p>and even rhinos they&rsquo;re stuck</p>
<p>in this rainforest it just kind of grew up around them</p>
<p>weird dude the congo</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this before in the documentary and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to get this the documentary is from the bbc</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not available on dvd i</p>
<p>tried to find it i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fucking find it</p>
<p>is it on pirate</p>
<p>pay might be</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that illegal we</p>
<p>would never do that brian</p>
<p>you do that i own it i own it on vhs</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know vhs is just so goddamn clunky not only do i own it</p>
<p>on vhs i own it on vhs that&rsquo;s an english version of vhs</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>like isn&rsquo;t there an english version</p>

<p>yes power exactly yeah so</p>
<p>i only have the english version this i have a fucking</p>
<p>i bought a vcr specifically so i</p>
<p>could watch this documentary</p>
<p>like i wanted to make sure that i</p>
<p>could watch this documentary so my vcr plays</p>
<p>american shit and it plays</p>
<p>but this fucking documentary is insane man</p>
<p>you realize like this</p>
<p>whole ecosystem just</p>
<p>changed in two</p>
<p>thousand years fish</p>
<p>in the congo</p>
<p>climb out of the fucking</p>
<p>water and walk on the ground</p>
<p>until another pond</p>
<p>and he jumps in the</p>
<p>water and then he gets</p>
<p>eaten by this</p>
<p>crazy bird called the shoebill</p>
<p>holy fuck you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even believe this goddamn</p>
<p>thing was real if you didn&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s six feet tall like five six feet tall</p>
<p>giant ass fucking bird</p>
<p>with a huge beak</p>
<p>this big fucking murdering bone</p>
<p>crushing beak that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>and it just</p>
<p>this fish that&rsquo;s trying to walk from one</p>
<p>place to another</p>
<p>jumps into the</p>
<p>water and this bird just jacks it</p>
<p>just a murderous</p>
<p>crushing fucking jaw in</p>
<p>these evil eyes man</p>
<p>birds have some of the nastiest</p>
<p>most evil fucking eyes they do</p>
<p>dude if that fucking</p>
<p>meteor didn&rsquo;t hit</p>
<p>sixty five million years ago we</p>
<p>would have been fucked</p>
<p>we would never become us</p>
<p>would never become us</p>
<p>we would never figured out how to kill all</p>
<p>those lizards</p>
<p>those lizards didn&rsquo;t die brother</p>
<p>what they went</p>
<p>underground no</p>
<p>mckenna fucked my dog</p>
<p>reptilians reptilian</p>
<p>transformation</p>
<p>have you seen the reptilian</p>
<p>transformation</p>
<p>videos on the internet they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so funny real</p>
<p>proof that what&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s that crazy guy does interviews larry like</p>
<p>proof that larry king</p>
<p>is a reptilian</p>
<p>oh my god and it always has this dramatic</p>
<p>music playing kind of techno</p>
<p>music this like</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s slowed down on larry king</p>
<p>and for whatever dumb reason</p>
<p>larry king licks his lips like</p>
<p>and it kind of looks like a lizard but</p>
<p>right when he licks his lip the</p>
<p>music changes and is like</p>
<p>like this is a proof that fucking larry king</p>
<p>is a lizard you sure isn&rsquo;t a joke no oh</p>
<p>people believe in the reptilian</p>
<p>they believe</p>
<p>that sound like a till or</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s yeah or it&rsquo;s just an ongoing</p>
<p>troll on the internet that you&rsquo;re falling for no way</p>
<p>b brian that</p>
<p>could be there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>trolls man there are so many goddamn</p>
<p>trolls so many people that</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s funny to pretend</p>
<p>to be somebody that they&rsquo;re not oh i know a little bit</p>
<p>about that but i</p>
<p>think that the the the the</p>
<p>these are serious and i told you the time i talked to</p>
<p>eddie griffin</p>
<p>he explained the</p>
<p>whole reptilian</p>
<p>explain at all i gave</p>
<p>him my credit card number</p>
<p>what do you think</p>
<p>he just make it up</p>
<p>how long have</p>
<p>human beings been on the planet</p>
<p>how long were the dinosaurs on the planet</p>
<p>look how much we</p>
<p>evolved in the time we were here how much more</p>
<p>did the dinosaurs evolve yeah he</p>
<p>would hit you with some shit like this we like take a</p>
<p>drink of his</p>
<p>like a little champagne bottle yeah have one of</p>
<p>those little paul mooney champagne bottles</p>
<p>think about this dog</p>
<p>if people came from</p>
<p>monkeys and</p>
<p>monkeys are still here</p>
<p>what the fuck are</p>
<p>monkeys doing</p>
<p>why are they still here</p>
<p>how come they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still monkeys if we came from monkeys</p>
<p>shit&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>black joey does</p>
<p>he know like</p>
<p>his own thing when he</p>
<p>talks about you follow</p>
<p>if you follow</p>
<p>joey stories</p>
<p>it makes sense too</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s funny though man very</p>
<p>funny when i saw in the days we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about eddie griffin on the podcast too many times</p>
<p>sorry folks</p>
<p>but just you</p>
<p>gotta let shit go</p>
<p>where it goes</p>
<p>when i first met</p>
<p>eddie griffin was in when he</p>
<p>first just did his hbo special</p>
<p>dude he was so fucking good that hbo</p>
<p>special i don&rsquo;t know if it holds up i said this before</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t seen it</p>
<p>since i saw it back then but when i</p>
<p>saw it back then i was like this is one dynamic fucking</p>
<p>entertainer</p>
<p>like this dude was little and</p>
<p>skinny and he was moving around</p>
<p>quick and i was like wow he is just a fucking star</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an undeniable star i was like boom</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve never met a dude so</p>
<p>crazy i know</p>
<p>so much fun</p>
<p>yeah he is so</p>
<p>crazy he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>much fun he&rsquo;s really cool he&rsquo;s so much fun</p>
<p>he had a cigarette in his hand</p>
<p>and with the backstage of the comedy</p>
<p>store he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i did 12 rounds</p>
<p>today with a kickboxing champion</p>
<p>yeah for the</p>
<p>first six rounds i</p>
<p>admit it he got the best of me</p>
<p>but nigga didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want no more in the last six you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t want no more</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>drinking he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>cigarette home</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a movie star</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s making up a</p>
<p>story about</p>
<p>fighting a kickboxing champion</p>
<p>right like what</p>
<p>i just think he</p>
<p>would just get</p>
<p>drunk and just see if he</p>
<p>could fuck with you</p>
<p>i just think he was</p>
<p>creating stories in his mind i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think he was really</p>
<p>lying to you</p>
<p>i think it was just for him i</p>
<p>might have a good time i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna talk some</p>
<p>crazy shit yeah you know</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>i mean it wasn&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>he was he was</p>
<p>like it wasn&rsquo;t committed to the theory either</p>
<p>you can change him yeah you can change his opinion</p>
<p>you know like we had</p>
<p>a conversation once</p>
<p>about the pyramids</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like the pyramids were created with sound</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the pyramids were created with sound</p>
<p>they use harmonic resonance and magnetos</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s making some shit</p>
<p>up and they</p>
<p>moved those</p>
<p>stones into place</p>
<p>and i said they don&rsquo;t know how they move</p>
<p>those stones into</p>
<p>place but they think they</p>
<p>might have been cement that was poured</p>
<p>so the deal with the</p>
<p>stones is the incredible numbers 2 million</p>
<p>300 000 so i just</p>
<p>start fucking hitting them with all</p>
<p>these facts</p>
<p>kind of being douchey about it</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just one</p>
<p>of my pet subjects and i hate when people talk nonsense</p>
<p>about the pyramids</p>
<p>i go and it</p>
<p>might even been poured limestone it</p>
<p>might not even been cut but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so i tell him all the</p>
<p>schedules but what how many</p>
<p>stones so he goes on stage</p>
<p>ten minutes later</p>
<p>the pyramids</p>
<p>you telling me</p>
<p>two million</p>
<p>three hundred thousand</p>
<p>stones all cut perfectly</p>
<p>he was just absorb</p>
<p>it you just like</p>
<p>you know he just would</p>
<p>change his opinion like</p>
<p>you could tell him that he was</p>
<p>wrong and go okay i&rsquo;m gonna talk</p>
<p>about that now yeah</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got this very</p>
<p>evangelical quality to him he could talk</p>
<p>about anything it</p>
<p>could happen ten minutes before</p>
<p>and he would go on</p>
<p>stage and he</p>
<p>would just fire off</p>
<p>about it you know</p>
<p>that was one of the fun things</p>
<p>about the comedy</p>
<p>store you know</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong what i&rsquo;m saying i mean</p>
<p>like what i&rsquo;m telling that he does this i mean he does</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all most of his own shit</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m not saying that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking anybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ideas or anything what i&rsquo;m saying is that he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>fascinating character who would like</p>
<p>he was like he&rsquo;d move in and out</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>would like be brilliant and then be</p>
<p>crazy yeah but when he was brilliant you&rsquo;re like whoa</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking amazing dude he</p>
<p>would hit some notes</p>
<p>man oh crazy</p>
<p>dude really good i&rsquo;ve seen that guy destroy</p>
<p>in a way where i&rsquo;m like wow this</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s like really special he&rsquo;s got a special talent yep</p>
<p>he had some killer jokes</p>
<p>my favorite one is the one</p>
<p>about cocaine</p>
<p>and cocaine</p>
<p>being involved for the invention of the telephone</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>girl he goes</p>
<p>he goes because you got to be high like a</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>to be sitting around going</p>
<p>i want to talk to someone who&rsquo;s not even here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great fucking joke</p>
<p>i saw him light that fucking comedy</p>
<p>store original room up with that joke</p>
<p>you gotta be high like a</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>with a cigarette in his hand</p>
<p>to be sitting around going i</p>
<p>wanna talk to somebody who ain&rsquo;t even here</p>
<p>and he would just hit them with this perfect facial</p>
<p>expression i&rsquo;d be like god it was humbling</p>
<p>you know it was like</p>
<p>my early days of news</p>
<p>radio in 1994</p>
<p>you know and i was like my act is like weak i</p>
<p>gotta work on my act i</p>
<p>gotta tighten it up</p>
<p>you see a guy like that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d see a few guys that you</p>
<p>would see perform</p>
<p>saw damon wayans</p>
<p>crack some out of the park</p>
<p>damon wayans is one of the most</p>
<p>underrated guys ever</p>
<p>dude when damon wayans did his hbo special</p>
<p>that is a funny fucking special that</p>
<p>still holds up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still pretty</p>
<p>funny yeah his</p>
<p>stuff is always good his</p>
<p>shit talking</p>
<p>about me tommy her</p>
<p>and about meeting mike tyson</p>
<p>mike tyson was mad at him because he was making jokes</p>
<p>about him yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny fucking shit</p>
<p>man it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to fuck it up i don&rsquo;t want to ruin it</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like something i designed</p>
<p>a punch and make you live</p>
<p>a bleed you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>funny he goes he</p>
<p>started biting me</p>
<p>he said biting him</p>
<p>and i think it was before the evander</p>
<p>holyfield incident</p>
<p>i think he might have made this special before</p>
<p>tyson bit holyfield&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ear i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>which is even crazier if he did</p>
<p>but it was a</p>
<p>funny fucking special man this had a</p>
<p>bunch of good shit in it i</p>
<p>watched it the</p>
<p>other day it was on like</p>
<p>is it online</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>if i saw it online or if i saw it on the tv but</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s underrated man he was one of</p>
<p>those guys that for whatever reason got famous for</p>
<p>movies and got</p>
<p>famous for a lot of</p>
<p>stuff but when he was on like as a</p>
<p>stand up he was fucking</p>
<p>great man he was</p>
<p>great like he was really good it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>shocking to me how few people recognize that you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never seen it i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve seen him do</p>
<p>stand up really yeah dude you gotta</p>
<p>watch his i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s called last stand</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>like i said i just saw it the</p>
<p>other day for the</p>
<p>first time in years and it was really good man</p>
<p>i was like this stuff is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just so likable and he&rsquo;s so relaxed on</p>
<p>stage just he&rsquo;s just a real comic man</p>
<p>you know it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>get that credit that he deserves for that i</p>
<p>think i mean</p>
<p>i just you know</p>
<p>contradict myself because i always say</p>
<p>that people get exactly the credit that they deserve</p>
<p>cause you know</p>
<p>no one should you</p>
<p>know people always like you know oh he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>enough credit but he does you know he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>somehow another he&rsquo;s not connecting to people you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s not putting it out there he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not getting it broadcast like he&rsquo;s got to figure it out</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just be good</p>
<p>everybody has to know you&rsquo;re good you have to</p>
<p>let everybody know there&rsquo;s something out there that can</p>
<p>hey i like this</p>
<p>guy here you can see what he does on youtube</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be something out there</p>
<p>to connect to people if you&rsquo;re not doing it you know</p>
<p>right did you see</p>
<p>ll cool j last</p>
<p>night on conan o&rsquo;brien</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird with that guy no</p>
<p>why you gotta find a clip or</p>
<p>watch that episode</p>
<p>well he was just acting very</p>
<p>crazy and then like not</p>
<p>anything insane but like you were just kind of</p>
<p>watching him really something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not right like</p>
<p>maybe he went too far</p>
<p>in some kind of drug or something</p>
<p>but he was talking</p>
<p>about he was at this play recently in la like a</p>
<p>month ago i did not hear about this</p>
<p>and in the play there&rsquo;s this part</p>
<p>where this wall falls down or something like that it</p>
<p>starts wobbling</p>
<p>and he saw this wall</p>
<p>starting to fall down and he runs on stage</p>
<p>grabs this woman</p>
<p>tries to get her to protect her from this wall</p>
<p>and the woman&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re ruining my show</p>
<p>in the middle of a play</p>
<p>and he got kicked out and</p>
<p>everything like that but he&rsquo;s telling this</p>
<p>story and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>this can&rsquo;t be true</p>
<p>i googled it</p>
<p>and sure enough there was like newspaper articles</p>
<p>about oh cool dude it goes</p>
<p>crazy and jumps on</p>
<p>stage of play</p>
<p>he must have been so hot</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like this fucking wall&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna kill the kids oh shit</p>
<p>the lady&rsquo;s gonna die i&rsquo;m fucking hella</p>
<p>cool g i&rsquo;m gonna jump up there and shit</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just seemed very positive</p>
<p>on the cone he was just like i just love</p>
<p>everything i do i like he&rsquo;s like he was</p>
<p>antidepressants yeah that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s saying</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll find it though if i you</p>
<p>think it was maybe it was just you that thought it was</p>
<p>help wait a minute stop</p>
<p>how high were you when this was happening no i was not</p>
<p>i was not i was not high it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>it was like he was acting weird and then he told that</p>
<p>story and then it was like wow something</p>
<p>really weird is going on we</p>
<p>paying full attention or were you semi masturbating</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re watching this</p>
<p>i was laying in</p>
<p>laying in bed</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s if you</p>
<p>leave a man by himself alone</p>
<p>in a room the tv on eighty percent of his time will be</p>
<p>spent semi masturbating</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m just some out hands</p>
<p>can rub my balls</p>
<p>cause it feels good and no one&rsquo;s here</p>
<p>so will you</p>
<p>tell the truth no i was just laying in bed actually</p>
<p>that would be weird as fucks on</p>
<p>watching you got nervous watching el cooljay</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s past</p>
<p>videos you just</p>
<p>created this fucking</p>
<p>dilemma you&rsquo;re laying in bed with your tramp dog</p>
<p>so was it actually an effect</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t recognize</p>
<p>was that what was</p>
<p>going on or did he actually</p>
<p>right it was an</p>
<p>effect that he thought was really</p>
<p>happening like a wall was falling down and he grabbed</p>
<p>the actress</p>
<p>oh boy maybe just wanted to try to fuck her real</p>
<p>quick he apologized and he said you know i feel so</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m really embarrassed</p>
<p>about the whole situation but i&rsquo;m thinking</p>

<p>so in the middle of the play</p>
<p>l how cool j is such a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker and has so much</p>
<p>confidence that he</p>
<p>might have just wanted to fuck that</p>
<p>chick and said well i&rsquo;ll just rescue her real</p>
<p>quick i&rsquo;ll pretend to and then i&rsquo;ll fuck her and then</p>
<p>can you imagine</p>
<p>being at your play and</p>

<p>especially when so poorly researched</p>
<p>you need to</p>
<p>study that shit whilst sober young man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just terrified of anything black</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all my talking about</p>
<p>black dicks on this podcast</p>
<p>while staring in your eyes it&rsquo;s like nom to me</p>
<p>i just see a</p>
<p>black person on the tv and i just</p>
<p>think of you and</p>
<p>black dicks</p>
<p>chasing me down</p>
<p>a hallway with some guy in prison and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ripping its balls off and i can&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>oh you&rsquo;re fucking yeah you&rsquo;re anti rape technique</p>
<p>anti prison rape of ball</p>
<p>grabbing i got an</p>
<p>email from somebody who</p>
<p>asked me to not say rape rape rape rape</p>
<p>rape why not use rape</p>
<p>rape why didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they want you to</p>
<p>say this is an unpleasant thought</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an unpleasant you know</p>
<p>what if somebody</p>
<p>what if one of your</p>
<p>loved ones had been raped</p>
<p>would you still use rape</p>
<p>who the fuck sends that email</p>
<p>well you know</p>
<p>maybe he had somebody that was raped i mean it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>point guess</p>
<p>i mean what is</p>
<p>raping your</p>
<p>eyeballs with that email</p>
<p>is it is it a</p>
<p>point is he send</p>
<p>emails to everyone</p>
<p>who uses that word is he&rsquo;s i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe i mean i didn&rsquo;t ask is he trying to eliminate</p>
<p>emails to ask questions</p>
<p>about i didn&rsquo;t psychia</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know though mean what is that a</p>
<p>valid i the idea that you know saying something that</p>
<p>could hurt someone&rsquo;s feelings when you</p>
<p>could have an alternative word that</p>
<p>maybe wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>ideal for the</p>
<p>expression that you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>if we were doing a show for king rapey</p>
<p>no man for me come on</p>
<p>what percentage of the guy</p>
<p>that sent that email</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the worst king</p>
<p>you know what you get at</p>
<p>least i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you know his name is</p>
<p>king hugs and cuddles</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>barbarian he likes to fuck kids in the ass and chop</p>
<p>their heads off when he comes king</p>
<p>no use the word</p>
<p>yeah i mean better to be called that</p>
<p>right so you know exactly what you&rsquo;re getting yeah</p>
<p>you know what let me go back</p>
<p>to what we were talking</p>
<p>about before when you talk about</p>
<p>this all this pillaging talk</p>
<p>you know when we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the vikings and shit</p>
<p>so you think that&rsquo;s what killed the</p>
<p>roman empire right</p>
<p>yeah well it seems like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different empires that did the</p>
<p>exact same thing</p>
<p>right like the</p>
<p>greeks same</p>
<p>thing they had fantastic</p>
<p>structures they</p>
<p>never repaired</p>
<p>them everything went to shit and then</p>
<p>civilizations sort of stayed in the same area</p>
<p>but became completely vastly different right</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that amazing</p>
<p>they got these incredible</p>
<p>structures like some of the most amazing</p>
<p>things that people have ever</p>
<p>built ever right the acropolis</p>
<p>acropolis and the parthenon</p>
<p>here amazing beautiful artwork</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sculptures and shit</p>
<p>and then they just kind of stopped doing that</p>
<p>and let it all fall to shit</p>
<p>like they forgot how to repair</p>
<p>those buildings yeah</p>
<p>the same people</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying people are</p>
<p>still living there</p>
<p>was never unpopulated</p>
<p>where was like a barren</p>
<p>wasteland a nuclear bomb blew off and people couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>live there for a fucking a hundred thousand years no</p>
<p>people stayed in that same area</p>
<p>but they never figured out how to</p>
<p>fix all that shit they just kind of let it fall apart</p>
<p>and nobody owns it</p>
<p>i mean somebody</p>
<p>owns it obviously mean they have tourism and shit but</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying like nobody owned it to fix it</p>
<p>you know hey this is my shit i</p>
<p>gotta fix this fucking</p>
<p>thing what the</p>
<p>buildings falling</p>
<p>apart you know</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s get some workers to work on the coliseum</p>
<p>no they built the coliseum and then just fucked off</p>
<p>you know i can remember</p>
<p>right when this society we&rsquo;re in right now</p>
<p>started to kind</p>
<p>of go into this collapse and it was like</p>
<p>the root i don&rsquo;t remember how</p>
<p>many years ago it was but i remember like sitting in</p>
<p>a movie theater and looking down and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this rip in the seat and i looked over and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a rip and then another seat and i was like you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different like that</p>
<p>would normally be repaired it was like</p>
<p>things were kind of fraying at the edges a little bit a</p>
<p>while ago and now what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is happening here</p>
<p>much more like</p>
<p>if you look around when you&rsquo;re out</p>
<p>look at how</p>
<p>dirty the cars are i know that</p>
<p>sounds stupid</p>
<p>but people aren&rsquo;t washing</p>
<p>their cars like cars are really</p>
<p>cost money to wash a car yeah</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t have a lot of</p>
<p>money now and</p>
<p>things are really getting dilapidated you</p>
<p>can kind of see this kind of</p>
<p>this paul is setting over</p>
<p>things that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen in my</p>
<p>whole life i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen that ship before well we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been a part of a recession before</p>
<p>right now we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been a part of when the fake</p>
<p>system falls</p>
<p>apart then they have to kind of rebuild</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t really rebuild they rebuilding the same</p>
<p>structure of what i call unfixable bullshit</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>stock market the economy the political</p>
<p>system that we have it&rsquo;s all like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna rebuild the society on this</p>
<p>fucking house of lies</p>
<p>you know we got to figure out a new way to do</p>
<p>things and when i&rsquo;m looking at</p>
<p>these other</p>
<p>civilizations like the</p>
<p>greeks and the romans</p>
<p>the ones that risen and fell</p>
<p>like look at the</p>
<p>egyptians same</p>
<p>thing you know when</p>
<p>they discovered</p>
<p>those ruins</p>
<p>those ruins there&rsquo;s no one living in them</p>
<p>they were just</p>
<p>giant monuments that had been</p>
<p>taken open and they&rsquo;d been you</p>
<p>know people had raided them and</p>
<p>stolen all the artifacts and</p>
<p>stuff and sold them but there was</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no one living in there</p>
<p>those are the most amazing</p>
<p>structures human beings have ever created</p>
<p>and their civilization devolved to the</p>
<p>point where people moved out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a pretty incredible</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty incredible</p>
<p>the most amazing</p>
<p>civilization ever and it fell</p>
<p>apart so much that there was no one living there</p>
<p>right what the mayans too</p>
<p>right the mayans too yeah the mayans too</p>
<p>very very interesting and similar story</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know exactly what happened with the mayans</p>
<p>they you know the mayans</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t like someone said oh</p>
<p>they were killed but no that&rsquo;s not true they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what happened to the mayans it</p>
<p>appears like the mayans just left that&rsquo;s why all these</p>
<p>nutty fucking lizard</p>
<p>reptilian believe in people they were in a</p>
<p>spaceship they came and kukla</p>
<p>khan took them to the</p>
<p>on a fiery serpent yes</p>
<p>serpent with feathers</p>
<p>right the feathered serpent</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quacks a quote</p>
<p>yeah what&rsquo;s a quattle</p>

<p>harsh way of depicting</p>
<p>things where like</p>
<p>it just there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>no judgment to it it&rsquo;s just this is what&rsquo;s happening</p>

<p>watching it on the</p>
<p>plane and i was</p>
<p>enjoying it up into a</p>
<p>point but i was like god damn this</p>
<p>motherfucker was negative</p>
<p>at certain points i was like dude</p>
<p>you bring it on yourself bitch</p>
<p>born into this i know</p>
<p>born into this i</p>
<p>had a recording of him reading his poetry</p>
<p>and somebody was</p>

<p>he was he was like</p>
<p>ready to fight cause he</p>
<p>was a bar brawler yeah he</p>
<p>would brawl with people</p>
<p>and he did it on purpose</p>
<p>his whole idea was that</p>
<p>you gotta live</p>
<p>and you gotta fuck</p>
<p>gotta get drunk</p>
<p>yeah can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>fucking shit this out</p>
<p>this really</p>
<p>crazy way of looking at life that you</p>
<p>had he was willing</p>
<p>to like live a wild life for his writing</p>
<p>well he reminds</p>
<p>me of like a zen master like if you read zen poetry</p>
<p>and like this pure</p>
<p>crisp description of reality that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same kind of</p>
<p>thing but he&rsquo;s just talking about</p>
<p>filthy horrors</p>
<p>and tenements</p>
<p>and people are like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not good yes it is it&rsquo;s just not good for</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>i ate a pot cookie on the plane so</p>
<p>not the best time to be</p>
<p>watching something</p>
<p>like this this guy&rsquo;s all negative and</p>
<p>goddamn he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy but he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna ever get scared of that though that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna eat the wrong</p>
<p>strongest cookie ever at one time</p>
<p>it happens many times i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned some of the</p>
<p>greatest lessons of my life</p>
<p>little surprises</p>
<p>i get scared by</p>
<p>those trips but</p>
<p>those trips</p>
<p>teach me everything</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what i learn</p>
<p>totally because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you listen you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t normally invite that onto yourself</p>
<p>but opposite</p>
<p>for whatever</p>
<p>reason you eat too much and then you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>going into the fucking grid</p>
<p>or into the</p>
<p>others layers upon</p>
<p>layers of denial and</p>
<p>a good pot cookie will wipe out nearly all them bitches</p>
<p>yeah nearly</p>
<p>all and fucking</p>
<p>shine some lights on some shit you forgot about</p>
<p>yeah and he and it&rsquo;s healing too it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>everyone talks about how</p>
<p>marijuana is</p>
<p>medicinal and i</p>
<p>never understood that</p>
<p>until i ate a lot of pot and was was like</p>
<p>laying down and and i really felt as though or like</p>
<p>going through my psyche</p>
<p>and doing a defrag</p>
<p>or something was like put you know it was like um</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>cleaning up stuff</p>
<p>and getting rid of the bullshit</p>
<p>and for weeks</p>
<p>after that i felt a million times happier</p>
<p>it really is like</p>
<p>medicine for the ego</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like ego tablets</p>
<p>you know your ego&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>lying to you here take this and you can see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on oh look</p>
<p>you got all this happening here and now</p>
<p>this is why you won&rsquo;t do that and you know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>clean your office</p>
<p>cause you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to come to the consequences of being a</p>
<p>success and you know from</p>
<p>right together and</p>
<p>you let go what your fucking parents did they were</p>
<p>stupid they were</p>
<p>young too okay fuck yeah it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like a coach</p>
<p>yes it&rsquo;s almost like a</p>
<p>coach standing</p>
<p>right next to you</p>
<p>try that yeah</p>
<p>in the tank</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s at dude that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>we can have a way better</p>
<p>world if people would just</p>
<p>i need to make a document</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a documentary</p>
<p>thing i need to make something</p>
<p>happen where more people get access to</p>
<p>these tanks and like document it</p>
<p>set these tanks up all over the place</p>
<p>get people involved in</p>
<p>them and get them to get high as fuck and go in there</p>
<p>and get them to reevaluate</p>
<p>their life you</p>
<p>should do it as a</p>
<p>it would be awesome as if you</p>
<p>could figure out a way to do that with prisons</p>
<p>see you get</p>
<p>prisons no no</p>
<p>no make the</p>
<p>water dirty</p>
<p>you gotta you know</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s too much work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s work but it&rsquo;s like to me that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always thought that if they need a</p>
<p>bunch of steps before they get</p>
<p>the isolation tanks you can&rsquo;t just let dudes fucking</p>
<p>climb in a tank of</p>
<p>water dudes</p>
<p>would be jumping</p>
<p>in there with them and buttfucking them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to control</p>
<p>water would have way too much salt</p>
<p>in it you have to control it</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m not in</p>
<p>favor of rewarding prisoners</p>
<p>with shit like that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it to figure out a way to</p>
<p>you know counsel them to</p>
<p>to you know</p>
<p>integrate them back in society and i don&rsquo;t think the</p>
<p>system that they have</p>
<p>right now is the</p>
<p>right way to do it but</p>
<p>if i was a fucking</p>
<p>victim or the family of a</p>
<p>victim and there&rsquo;s some dude who&rsquo;s getting an isolation</p>
<p>tank and i can&rsquo;t afford it i&rsquo;ll be like fuck you</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they deserve that shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just you</p>
<p>have to punish people and you have to set an example</p>
<p>for doing shitty</p>
<p>things as long</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s not like drug related non violent crimes</p>
<p>you know like oh he had a bag of pot</p>
<p>on him now he&rsquo;s in jail you know that kind of nonsense</p>
<p>when you watch locked up raw</p>
<p>and you see the way</p>
<p>these guys are being</p>
<p>treated they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>freaking out yeah it&rsquo;s horrible it&rsquo;s like okay i get it</p>
<p>vengeance and i understand</p>
<p>the desire for</p>
<p>vengeance from the family but</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there like a bigger</p>
<p>picture here</p>
<p>which is that</p>
<p>yeah you want</p>
<p>vengeance but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just part of the same problem is that it is part of</p>
<p>the same problem but the problem is this person is not</p>
<p>gonna get any better if you let them out and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learn anything from this they don&rsquo;t suffer</p>
<p>guess what nothing changes</p>
<p>and you leave them in</p>
<p>guess what nothing changes either they</p>
<p>get beat up</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think they</p>
<p>learn anything</p>
<p>from the current way</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>treated but at</p>
<p>least the victims have the</p>
<p>satisfaction of knowing that this person has to pay for</p>
<p>their suffering</p>
<p>which is great</p>
<p>until that fucking person gets let out what if they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ever four</p>
<p>months but a lot of them do most of them do</p>
<p>yeah so suddenly so now you got your fucking</p>
<p>pound of flesh this guy got raped for 10 years</p>
<p>he got addicted to</p>
<p>some weird prison drug</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s out in the streets and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna do it again</p>
<p>and then that</p>
<p>spreads more</p>
<p>that spreads more of</p>
<p>disease okay</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re taking like very</p>
<p>very specific examples</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more important than anything to protect people</p>
<p>from people that want to harm them</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most important thing</p>
<p>so if anybody&rsquo;s violent if anybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dangerous they need to be locked up and if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learn or if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if they have a real</p>
<p>objective assessment they</p>
<p>think this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to go back and get revenge</p>
<p>they should</p>
<p>never be let out well i was reading mckenna talking</p>
<p>about how do you</p>
<p>you know diagnose</p>
<p>that how do you correctly</p>
<p>you know make that call</p>
<p>and not improve</p>
<p>and someone for life because you don&rsquo;t like them but</p>
<p>leary and back in the 60s they were doing</p>
<p>experiments with</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it was lsd or psilocybin</p>
<p>with prisoners</p>
<p>and the effect was</p>
<p>tremendous it was</p>
<p>changing them and</p>
<p>transforming them</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a better option</p>
<p>the tank is too complicated</p>
<p>the tank you need too much control of yourself</p>
<p>you need to be able to be calm and</p>
<p>relax you need</p>
<p>to be able to let go to use it</p>
<p>you need to not piss and jerk off in there you fuckhead</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>leave that we don&rsquo;t want filthy prisoners in a</p>
<p>flotation thing i</p>
<p>think we all</p>
<p>agree on that but giving them mushrooms</p>
<p>would be a way</p>
<p>cheaper and way better solution and a really good one</p>
<p>i mean if you wanted to reintegrate them</p>
<p>you could just create an alternate society</p>
<p>where look you can&rsquo;t ever go free but</p>
<p>how about we only have the mushroom taking</p>
<p>population segmented</p>
<p>off from the rest of everybody else</p>
<p>and we give</p>
<p>you guys a chance to reestablish a community</p>
<p>we have a giant</p>
<p>track of land you have gps trips on don&rsquo;t try to escape</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna put the gps</p>
<p>trip into muscully in your body if you cut it</p>
<p>out it will register in a computer you go back to jail</p>
<p>for the rest of your term</p>
<p>plus parole no questions asked</p>
<p>so take the mushrooms</p>
<p>and you live in this little</p>
<p>place in the village like a fucking m night</p>
<p>shamalama ding dong movie</p>
<p>and everybody goes out there by themselves completely</p>
<p>disconnected from society and let&rsquo;s do this as an</p>
<p>experiment let&rsquo;s take all</p>
<p>these fucked up prisoners</p>
<p>and make them eat mushrooms</p>
<p>take the most violent the most fucked up the craziest</p>
<p>and let them talk to the</p>
<p>spirit world five</p>
<p>grams all the time all day son</p>
<p>all day son</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>watch them evolve</p>
<p>right before our</p>
<p>ebo gain trips</p>
<p>every month</p>
<p>every month they have</p>
<p>scheduled ebo</p>
<p>gain trips these</p>
<p>motherfuckers are</p>
<p>gonna do ayahuasca</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna give them a full</p>
<p>psychedelic re</p>
<p>evaluation but how amazing</p>
<p>would it be</p>
<p>if instead of having to send them to</p>
<p>their plot of land</p>
<p>what if when people came out of prison</p>
<p>cause we were so advanced and we understood</p>
<p>psychology so well</p>
<p>when people came out of prison</p>
<p>they were like</p>
<p>professors they were</p>
<p>a million times</p>
<p>better and then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re helping society the</p>
<p>problem is there&rsquo;s too many</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>money there&rsquo;s too many there&rsquo;s too many fucking people</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too many people that are so far gone you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to do something special</p>
<p>to make them change</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where my mushroom</p>
<p>plantation comes in</p>
<p>i like i like the rogan mushroom</p>
<p>plantation i</p>
<p>think the duncan</p>
<p>trussell lsd egg</p>
<p>is much better</p>
<p>which is an egg</p>
<p>shaped thing that prisoners go in for</p>
<p>many many years</p>
<p>until their ego is</p>
<p>completely erased</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re reprogrammed with only</p>
<p>positive teachings they learn</p>
<p>about buddhism all the</p>
<p>world religions</p>
<p>and that you pop them back out into society</p>
<p>maybe you start with six seven</p>
<p>but you pop</p>
<p>them back out into society and now instead of</p>
<p>putting the poison back into society</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>an antidote</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s a beautiful idea in theory</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s so far away from being able to be done</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re talking science fiction there</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not science fiction i mean it&rsquo;s not yet we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>yet capable of it but</p>
<p>mushrooms are here</p>
<p>right now that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying this</p>
<p>inducing so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying this is a mushroom</p>
<p>i lost your</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>you put prisoners in</p>
<p>some sort of</p>
<p>chamber i don&rsquo;t know what else you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>you inject them with it or something you just have them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exactly the same</p>
<p>thing you said i was just i was</p>
<p>being a little too</p>
<p>weird about it</p>
<p>cause yeah you had created some alternate</p>
<p>reality where you</p>
<p>can erase their memory it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird cause no</p>
<p>i think if you gave someone enough lsd you</p>
<p>would erase</p>
<p>their memory but</p>
<p>in my mind it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>an egg like thing</p>
<p>where you project</p>
<p>this is where you lost</p>
<p>i was like what are you talking</p>
<p>about i don&rsquo;t know why i see like this but i see</p>
<p>this egg like</p>
<p>thing and you project on the walls</p>
<p>just like morkamania</p>
<p>beautiful images</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a mork egg he came out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a mork egg</p>
<p>yeah dude it&rsquo;s a mork egg</p>
<p>just nailed it son</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it my man</p>
<p>pulled out look</p>
<p>the greatest all time</p>
<p>reference is a mork egg</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even remember that a morgue egg was a real</p>
<p>thing until you brought that up well the morgue egg</p>
<p>was i&rsquo;ve always wanted one of</p>
<p>those morgue eggs</p>
<p>or the bill</p>
<p>cos i gotta</p>
<p>get some knuckles on the morgue egg reference</p>
<p>but you guys both need to follow the</p>
<p>brian redband prison idea</p>
<p>because it was way better than the duncan trestle</p>
<p>prison idea</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just make them</p>
<p>bomb sniffer dogs and</p>
<p>use prisoners for things like that</p>
<p>okay we might have a bomb in here oh yeah by the way</p>
<p>we were talking about the the lsd</p>
<p>experiments we were talking about the</p>
<p>mk ultra yeah we were talking</p>
<p>about the shit that they did the cia</p>
<p>that turned ted kaczynski into the unabomber</p>
<p>supposedly allegedly</p>
<p>that the documentary and we talked</p>
<p>about in the podcast before i</p>
<p>think the documentaries called the net</p>
<p>very very fascinating</p>
<p>really interesting shit</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s my problem with the lsd</p>
<p>my problem with lsd is i keep hearing</p>
<p>crazy stories about people losing their marbles</p>
<p>you know and howard stearns talked</p>
<p>about it how he took it once and he took too much of it</p>
<p>and he had this horrifying</p>
<p>scary fucking trip</p>
<p>and where he</p>
<p>was like losing his mind and then the drummer from pink</p>
<p>floyd that joey diaz always talks about</p>
<p>did some fucking</p>
<p>lsd lost his mind i don&rsquo;t remember the dude&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>sid barrett is that his name</p>
<p>yeah i think you know the whole</p>
<p>story i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he was a drummer but yeah</p>
<p>i know that</p>
<p>he was a guitar player what was he no</p>
<p>he was like a singer and i</p>
<p>think he was like one of the</p>
<p>founders of it or</p>
<p>something yeah</p>
<p>the story goes that he just they were all</p>
<p>tripping out so much but he</p>
<p>i think he became a</p>
<p>schizophrenic or a shut in</p>
<p>in london or something and then he died</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s dead but he released some great</p>
<p>sid bear released some and that was</p>
<p>due or they</p>
<p>allegedly believed it was due to an lsd trip</p>
<p>like it was connected oh</p>
<p>yeah they say it was he went</p>
<p>crazy from he did the lsd and just lost</p>
<p>his with see</p>
<p>you know you hear</p>
<p>about that you don&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>about that with mushrooms</p>
<p>right although that&rsquo;s not totally true</p>
<p>cause dennis mckenna</p>
<p>terrence mckenna&rsquo;s brother apparently</p>
<p>lost it for a long time they had some big</p>
<p>crazy mushroom trip down in central america or</p>
<p>south america</p>
<p>and he was gone for like two weeks</p>
<p>where he was like in this</p>
<p>complete like fit of madness it was just a</p>
<p>shit happens a lot</p>
<p>with mushrooms yeah growing up when i used to do</p>
<p>mushrooms a lot a lot of my friends had the same shit</p>
<p>where like what happened to so and so and like oh i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen him for like a week and then</p>
<p>he comes back and he&rsquo;s like dude i had</p>
<p>a really bad</p>
<p>trip i just sat in my</p>
<p>house for a week and thought</p>
<p>about things</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had that a few times do</p>
<p>you think that is</p>
<p>do you think that that is just an overwhelming amount</p>
<p>of psilocybin and they just couldn&rsquo;t process it or</p>
<p>do you think that it was a very bad time in</p>
<p>their life when they took it</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some sort of an internal struggle between</p>
<p>the experience a</p>
<p>psychedelic experience</p>
<p>which requires</p>
<p>absolute truth and honesty</p>
<p>and all the issues that you</p>
<p>might have not resolved in your</p>
<p>own mind they&rsquo;re constantly fucking with your psyche</p>
<p>so then a battle takes</p>
<p>place between the</p>
<p>psychedelic truth and</p>
<p>all the shit that you&rsquo;re trying to keep in the</p>
<p>closet and the dark and all the</p>
<p>douchey behavior and all life and stress and death and</p>
<p>sucking dicks and</p>
<p>airplanes getting hit by missiles</p>
<p>and it all just falls</p>
<p>apart and your mind</p>
<p>literally cannot grab anything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just madness</p>
<p>where just like</p>
<p>defragging before your eyes the information is</p>
<p>crumbling your ability to decode</p>
<p>language it&rsquo;s all dissolving</p>
<p>like you fuck your whole</p>
<p>brain sideways</p>
<p>and apparently</p>
<p>for like two</p>
<p>weeks he was gone but that&rsquo;s when you need a shaman or</p>
<p>somebody somebody could talk</p>
<p>you down i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna lead you through that</p>
<p>cause that means you&rsquo;re at the</p>
<p>right place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when the healing</p>
<p>starts as they&rsquo;ve pulled all the fuck they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>scrubbing the germs of your ego way and all of a</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;re in this open place</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re with someone who knows what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>who really knows what they&rsquo;re doing then you can</p>
<p>evolve at that moment and become</p>
<p>something so much happier and more real than you are</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s the sad</p>
<p>thing about it is</p>
<p>no one knows how to do that and</p>
<p>kids are like</p>
<p>fucking tripping out on</p>
<p>psychedelics and having rotten trips because</p>
<p>no one knows how</p>
<p>to they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to do it and also they&rsquo;re coming from</p>
<p>you know who knows what</p>
<p>their view of the</p>
<p>world is and how far it is off from reality</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing about all</p>
<p>psychedelic trips is they</p>
<p>force you before we go any further</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like to see your ticket</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d like to see your ticket is</p>
<p>here is your real life for real</p>
<p>okay so before we go</p>
<p>and talk to any fucking flying blue</p>
<p>dragons it&rsquo;ll take you into the center of the universe</p>
<p>and show you</p>
<p>the fabric of life that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>under the hood</p>
<p>of the car of the universe</p>
<p>before we do that</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s you i</p>
<p>think sometimes the drugs affect</p>
<p>different people in different ways</p>
<p>other than that though like</p>
<p>i think i&rsquo;ve said this before this girl i knew</p>
<p>she hit one you know</p>
<p>bong once and she just took off running as fast as she</p>
<p>could into my bathroom and hit the tub and fell</p>
<p>against the wall and</p>
<p>stuff but when</p>
<p>she came back to it she was like i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>doing it i have no idea why i did that and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>what one hit from weed made you do this don&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>touch weed ever again</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right man look stanhope</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like weed</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you i don&rsquo;t like what it does to me yeah</p>
<p>stanhope likes everything</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s a mushroom aficionado</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s probably taken</p>
<p>30 times more drugs than</p>
<p>i have he&rsquo;ll help to fucking take anything i heard this</p>
<p>i was reading the</p>
<p>biography of timothy leary</p>
<p>and i can&rsquo;t remember the name of it now there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of them i&rsquo;m sure but the one i was reading</p>
<p>there was a reporter who was at the</p>
<p>house where they were all</p>
<p>tripping out and</p>
<p>who was like</p>
<p>watching them</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>apparently gonna do a negative</p>
<p>story on them or something</p>
<p>because you know as you know leary</p>
<p>was up in this</p>
<p>house with a</p>
<p>bunch of hippies like</p>
<p>alan ginsberg</p>
<p>and richard albert and like a lot of the beat</p>
<p>people from the 60s so</p>
<p>and they were all</p>
<p>experimenting with acid but</p>
<p>this reporter</p>
<p>apparently snuck into timothy</p>
<p>leary&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>where under his office in a drawer in a</p>
<p>decanter he had liquid acid</p>
<p>the reporter</p>
<p>thinking it was</p>
<p>vodka or some kind of alcohol poured himself a</p>
<p>drink and drink</p>
<p>oh yeah wow</p>
<p>and oh my god</p>
<p>ingested this</p>
<p>massive amount of acid not even knowing it</p>
<p>and so he started having this</p>
<p>incredibly terrible trip and they say he took his</p>
<p>clothes off he was running around the grounds naked</p>
<p>but they got him to sit down</p>
<p>and fucking</p>
<p>alan ginsberg and i can&rsquo;t remember who the</p>
<p>other people were they all</p>
<p>started singing hari</p>
<p>krishna to this guy</p>
<p>the hard christian</p>
<p>amaha mantra which is</p>

<p>fast well however you want to do it</p>
<p>i think we&rsquo;re too high</p>
<p>to be doing a podcast</p>
<p>the fact that we were even</p>
<p>considering that that might be</p>
<p>entertaining for all the people listening shows you a</p>
<p>state of consciousness</p>
<p>where no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trippy and mantras are really it is</p>
<p>weird it doesn&rsquo;t it gives you a weird feeling it does</p>
<p>because and mantras are</p>
<p>great because</p>
<p>whatever the one is you decide to do</p>
<p>it gives you a chance to</p>
<p>focus your mind</p>
<p>on something outside your thoughts because i do that</p>
<p>after yoga sometimes i do ohms</p>
<p>i did like a long ohm</p>
<p>session in like the</p>
<p>in a lotus position</p>
<p>i do that it seems so</p>
<p>silly and pretentious</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like what kind of fucking faggot</p>
<p>i am right now</p>
<p>when my friends</p>
<p>walked in on me from high</p>
<p>school like what are you doing stupid</p>
<p>and fucking what are you doing you</p>
<p>gonna suck a couple dicks</p>
<p>after this and eat</p>
<p>some berries you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not pretentious</p>
<p>it just seems like</p>
<p>of course it&rsquo;s not pretentious but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain amount of silliness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s attached to any yoga</p>
<p>spirituality</p>
<p>even if you say you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>vegan or something you&rsquo;re an environmentalist</p>
<p>anytime there&rsquo;s anything caring</p>
<p>in any sort of consideration</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>bunch of weakness attached to it</p>
<p>so if somebody catches you</p>
<p>sitting there in the</p>
<p>low disposition with</p>
<p>your fuck you finger</p>
<p>touching your</p>
<p>thumb going oh</p>
<p>like you silly</p>
<p>bitch what do you do</p>
<p>do you go what do you do do you go om</p>
<p>om or do long i&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you exactly</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>i do long ones i do that sometimes in the tank too</p>
<p>the tank gets even</p>
<p>weirder because it reverberates to the water</p>
<p>you know i do that when i need to</p>
<p>slow my mind down</p>
<p>i need to like</p>
<p>when i get into the tank sometimes it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an adjustment period of like a few minutes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just trying to</p>
<p>relax and settle in and get</p>
<p>loose and just settle into the experience</p>
<p>and then sometimes i just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>this is too much on my mind i got too much fucking</p>
<p>going on too much</p>
<p>real life tm bullshit</p>
<p>you know invading my consciousness</p>
<p>so then i go oh</p>
<p>and i just only think</p>
<p>about my breathing</p>
<p>my breathing and making that noise</p>
<p>and then eventually i stop</p>
<p>thinking about my breathing and the breathing</p>
<p>just comes automatically deep and long and i just</p>
<p>think about hitting the right note</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s like a certain</p>
<p>relaxation to it when you really hit it</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re faking it when you&rsquo;re nervous</p>
<p>about it then you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s like a break in the way you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not relaxed enough to let that</p>
<p>sound come out what about the buddhist one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the craziest shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the craziest shit that shit&rsquo;s insane boy</p>
<p>yeah dude you sound like one of those instruments</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it called an australian thing diggery dude</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking freaking me out man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking freaking me out man</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;ve been chanting lately is uh</p>
<p>for a while now and i love it is</p>
<p>no what is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this whole prayer whoa</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s from the duncans and alien</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen you were right i was wrong</p>
<p>aliens are real we have one here with us he just</p>
<p>spoke to us in the code</p>
<p>he just sent the fucking signal to the motherships</p>
<p>i know an embarrassing amount of prayers and</p>
<p>other languages</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another it&rsquo;s nothing embarrassing</p>
<p>about that at all it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>yeah i love you that was amazing i&rsquo;m obviously</p>
<p>fascinated if you look at this</p>
<p>fucking shiva over here</p>
<p>i have shit like this all over my</p>
<p>house i&rsquo;m fascinated by like hindu artwork</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just something</p>
<p>about it to me</p>
<p>you know when i look at there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about like india and india&rsquo;s ancient artwork all these</p>
<p>women with like extra hands and shit it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>obviously psychedelic dude i had intensely i had</p>
<p>an incredible dream once where</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>those things whatever those things were in this</p>
<p>dream i was like at a restaurant though but</p>
<p>these things that look like</p>
<p>shiva that the</p>
<p>angelic hindu thing right</p>
<p>they came up to me and</p>
<p>they were so beautiful and so perfect and i was like</p>
<p>looking at them and</p>
<p>for some reason i was like i said</p>
<p>you look like me</p>
<p>and they were like no</p>
<p>you look like us</p>
<p>as though to say like</p>
<p>humans were a reflection</p>
<p>of what they are or like</p>
<p>just an expansion of like</p>
<p>whatever that thing is</p>
<p>wow you know another</p>
<p>this awesome</p>
<p>you know of course in</p>
<p>hinduism the universe is called maya</p>
<p>which means illusion</p>
<p>and the way they describe this universe is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the reflection</p>
<p>of a forest on a lake</p>
<p>our universe is the reflection</p>
<p>of the true universe like the true universe is so</p>
<p>powerful that we&rsquo;re this kind of</p>
<p>shimmering weird</p>
<p>reflection of it and we all</p>
<p>think that we&rsquo;re real</p>
<p>and permanent and constant and it lasts</p>
<p>forever when it&rsquo;s just nothing more than just like a</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know just some kind of</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know an illusion maya</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they call reality illusion</p>
<p>damn not real at all how</p>
<p>wack is christianity in</p>
<p>comparison to that right</p>
<p>yeah how fascinating that&rsquo;s like such high level shit</p>
<p>yeah and that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>dj high tech</p>
<p>dj high tech</p>
<p>high level shit full flex</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>ninja would say high</p>
<p>level shit next</p>
<p>level shit next</p>
<p>level shit you know what man it is next</p>
<p>level shit right</p>
<p>well yeah i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t know that i&rsquo;d call it next</p>
<p>level shit i</p>
<p>would it&rsquo;s like high level</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the next</p>
<p>level just it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>level it&rsquo;s people zooming into the</p>
<p>level and you</p>
<p>know what it is</p>
<p>an interesting</p>
<p>thing about the</p>
<p>hindus is they</p>
<p>ate a lot of hash</p>
<p>and mushrooms yes and mushrooms soma</p>
<p>when yes soma they don&rsquo;t even know exactly what it is</p>
<p>soma is referenced in many of the ancient texts</p>
<p>right and they think it</p>
<p>might have been amanita</p>
<p>mescaria and psilocybin</p>
<p>cubensis and a</p>
<p>bunch of other shitlift</p>
<p>mixing together there&rsquo;s a lot of debate on what it is</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>clear that something that they</p>
<p>ate that made them have</p>
<p>experiences i mean they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>we did psychedelics</p>
<p>we called it soma</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what soma is</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very obvious from what they</p>
<p>wrote that it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>plant there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>solid isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>mckenna talks</p>
<p>about the rig</p>
<p>veda and the rig</p>
<p>veda is just</p>
<p>hymns to soma to the</p>
<p>and they have all</p>
<p>these ways of describing it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the oldest known</p>
<p>is that the oldest known</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not the oldest known</p>
<p>written work</p>
<p>that no well no</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>one of the oldest well there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>upon a shot</p>
<p>right and then there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>mahabharat which is what the bhagavad gita comes out of</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the one that has all the what is it called</p>
<p>vimayas what is it called when something</p>
<p>flies to the sky oh yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember the</p>
<p>name of it i don&rsquo;t remember the name of it but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fascinating take on</p>
<p>you know that all the ufo believers</p>
<p>believe that in that book</p>
<p>maha bharata as i say it mahabarat</p>
<p>mahabharata</p>
<p>it means great</p>
<p>india barat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s spelled barada but barat means india</p>
<p>and maha means</p>
<p>great isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>weird how we have names for countries</p>
<p>other than the names they use yeah</p>
<p>like germany is not germany</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s doucheland</p>
<p>really yeah it&rsquo;s not germany</p>
<p>and same with</p>
<p>like greece</p>
<p>greece is like hollis or something like that really</p>
<p>yeah yeah japan is not</p>
<p>japan let&rsquo;s just what nippon</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally different word and i ppo</p>
<p>n well it&rsquo;s obviously in different characters</p>
<p>but phonetically it&rsquo;s nippon</p>
<p>upon wow yeah</p>
<p>i feel dumb now wonder if russia is a different name</p>
<p>what is it now yeah</p>
<p>what was it before</p>
<p>naming something so</p>
<p>weird naming like a name for any geography a</p>
<p>noise you make with your</p>
<p>mouth that describes a spot yeah</p>
<p>so fucking it&rsquo;s such an odd</p>
<p>thing the numbers</p>
<p>thing we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>keeping track of</p>
<p>everything i mean i</p>
<p>guess it helps traveling</p>
<p>yeah helps gps</p>
<p>kind of need it yeah</p>
<p>gotta all agree</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy that we all</p>
<p>agree on red being stop and</p>
<p>green being</p>
<p>go that&rsquo;s everywhere in the</p>
<p>world nowhere that someone stubborn</p>
<p>is like fuck you bitch</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even like red</p>
<p>dude to get back to the</p>
<p>india stuff</p>
<p>i felt like i wanted to tell you this story</p>
<p>but stop me if i already told you</p>
<p>did i ever tell you the</p>
<p>story of when richard alper</p>
<p>gave lsd to his guru in</p>
<p>india that story</p>
<p>i think we did talk</p>
<p>about that but i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>so this guy was like i don&rsquo;t know if we talked</p>
<p>about it on the podcast but i know we talked</p>
<p>about it we</p>
<p>could just go</p>
<p>whatever shit overlaps on this</p>
<p>so richard alpert was this guy who was</p>
<p>a psychologist and he was hanging out timothy</p>
<p>leary blew his mind on acid</p>
<p>or i think it was mushrooms</p>
<p>and basically the</p>
<p>thing you were talking</p>
<p>about happened to him</p>
<p>where he like</p>
<p>cause he was really</p>
<p>like rich at the time and he had a nice car and i think</p>
<p>like things were really like</p>
<p>he was like a career</p>
<p>like he was on the up so to speak</p>
<p>and so he took this</p>
<p>psychedelic and saw his</p>
<p>life kind of just</p>
<p>vanish in front of him and he</p>
<p>realized that western society was obviously</p>
<p>a bit of a sham and</p>
<p>he ended up</p>
<p>going to india because he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>heard these stories</p>
<p>over there richard albert is rom das</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right exactly he</p>
<p>calls himself the</p>
<p>rom das is his name</p>
<p>you can go to romdas com</p>
<p>he wrote be here now</p>
<p>but so he has this guru he goes to india</p>
<p>and basically finds his gurus this little man in a</p>
<p>blanket and</p>
<p>albert has lsd</p>
<p>with him and</p>
<p>according to his</p>
<p>story this little guy is like you have</p>
<p>medicine here you have</p>
<p>medicine here</p>
<p>albert gave him</p>
<p>you know at the time this is acid in the sixties being</p>
<p>carried around</p>
<p>by like someone who is friends with timothy</p>
<p>leary so this is high</p>
<p>powered shit</p>
<p>albert gives him some he eats it</p>
<p>eats one of them</p>
<p>and then he like motions for him to give him more and</p>
<p>basically eats</p>
<p>all of his acid all of it just gobbles it down</p>
<p>and so alper</p>
<p>thinks oh fuck i have</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve killed a little old indian man</p>
<p>right and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go insane</p>
<p>according to the</p>
<p>story no effect</p>
<p>nothing happened</p>
<p>no effect no</p>
<p>effect oh my god and and and and he said one</p>
<p>thing he said to him was this</p>
<p>reminds me of a</p>
<p>this reminds</p>
<p>me of something they had in the something valley</p>
<p>like some it was</p>
<p>just it reminded him of something he&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>but so albert</p>
<p>left went back to the united</p>
<p>states mind</p>
<p>blown by this little man because and he&rsquo;s like he</p>
<p>tricked me right he palmed the</p>
<p>shit didn&rsquo;t really eat it came back</p>
<p>the guy who albert</p>
<p>swears was telepathic was like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t believe i</p>
<p>ate that stuff</p>
<p>because albert had brought more he took it</p>
<p>chewed it up in</p>
<p>front of him chewed it up in his</p>
<p>mouth opened his</p>
<p>mouth so he</p>
<p>could see that it was in his</p>
<p>mouth or whatever pill form and then</p>
<p>after some time went</p>
<p>under his blanket</p>
<p>and started making</p>
<p>moaning noises</p>
<p>and alvar was like oh fuck</p>
<p>he ate it this time and he went insane</p>
<p>and then he came out of his</p>
<p>blanket laughing</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s fucking with him</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t affect him</p>
<p>again no effect</p>
<p>he was just playing into what albert thought</p>
<p>it would have done now</p>
<p>which was driven</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s so enlightened that he</p>
<p>still plays practical jokes yeah no he&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think humor goes away that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>comedians get afraid of like spirituality or</p>
<p>meditating or</p>
<p>whatever because they&rsquo;re like i don&rsquo;t want to not be</p>
<p>funny anymore yes dude i used to</p>
<p>think exactly that</p>
<p>thing yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that i don&rsquo;t think it</p>
<p>money goes away i</p>
<p>think it just gets better you guys better you guys</p>
<p>better the more at</p>
<p>peace you are the more</p>
<p>funny you are if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>the worst i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ever at is when i&rsquo;m in stressful situations or i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>upset at someone or said it myself or whatever</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re in a good</p>
<p>place you&rsquo;re a happy</p>
<p>place and no stress yeah</p>
<p>always better yeah for sure</p>

<p>video totally can i get it on this phone</p>
<p>maybe i have a</p>
<p>video i don&rsquo;t need to show you guys a</p>
<p>video but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna talk about it</p>
<p>while duncan looks for this</p>
<p>when i was in germany there was a station</p>
<p>that had a 24 hour camera</p>
<p>that was on the</p>
<p>pilgrimage at mecca</p>
<p>oh cool and for 24</p>
<p>hours a day it just showed</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>putting on these</p>
<p>white robes</p>
<p>and moving around this square</p>
<p>what is that square man what is the deal with that</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it called the</p>
<p>no the hodge no that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole thing i</p>
<p>think is called the</p>
<p>hodge it&rsquo;s called the hodge is like a</p>
<p>pilgrimage right</p>
<p>yeah version</p>
<p>of a pilgrimage yeah</p>
<p>well anyway this thing</p>
<p>is this big box</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the center of this square and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really beautiful like</p>
<p>incredible architecture i mean it&rsquo;s fucking amazing</p>
<p>and everyone</p>
<p>super well behaved</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s no one getting</p>
<p>in arguments or anything and they&rsquo;re all like in</p>
<p>close proximity to each other</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>touching each</p>
<p>other and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>walking around in a circle around this box 24</p>
<p>hours a day i</p>
<p>watched it for an hour and a half</p>
<p>just sitting there</p>
<p>with my jaw open like what the fuck</p>
<p>and duncan had sent me this</p>
<p>video once of</p>
<p>i sent him a</p>
<p>video of ants</p>
<p>or we both had seen it rather of ants</p>
<p>in a death spiral</p>
<p>yeah what was the reason for it like one of the</p>
<p>queen had died and you tweeted it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s this yeah no the reason is is because like</p>
<p>ants follow each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trail and so</p>
<p>basically they end up</p>
<p>following a</p>
<p>trail in the</p>
<p>wrong they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically just end up</p>
<p>going in a circle following the same trail oh</p>
<p>how does that happen</p>
<p>because one ant fucks up one ant</p>
<p>fucks up or the</p>
<p>queen fucks up or something</p>
<p>and so they follow that so you get the entire nest of</p>
<p>ants all going in this circle</p>
<p>that looks like this beautiful spiral it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s available online</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the ant death</p>
<p>spiral right</p>
<p>well you sent me this video</p>
<p>of them doing that at mecca it was like almost the</p>
<p>exact same thing</p>
<p>yeah it looks exactly the same</p>
<p>except they don&rsquo;t die</p>
<p>but this desire to go around</p>
<p>in a circle they&rsquo;re not just walking up that thing and</p>
<p>touching it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re walking</p>
<p>around it and they&rsquo;re walking around it just</p>
<p>covered in robes i mean they&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>dressed like they were</p>
<p>dressed thousands</p>
<p>of years ago well there actually there was just a</p>
<p>video on cnn</p>
<p>of this guy who went there with like those with</p>
<p>what is it called the</p>
<p>things edison had</p>
<p>those weird silver</p>
<p>discs they used to record</p>
<p>stuff or cone</p>
<p>things i can&rsquo;t remember what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anyway it&rsquo;s like this thing from</p>
<p>a very long time ago of mecca</p>
<p>with the recording</p>
<p>from back then showing like the city around it and</p>
<p>stuff and it was just much more</p>
<p>dilapidated</p>
<p>and less built up but the same fucking</p>
<p>thing man all the</p>
<p>muslims going around that</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it amazing</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve committed to that for so long</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>thing when i was</p>
<p>watching that i was like if this</p>
<p>this is thousands of years old</p>
<p>right islam</p>
<p>is over a thousand years old</p>
<p>right is it</p>
<p>1500 1500 years old something like that</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know anyway whatever it is it&rsquo;s very old okay</p>
<p>if this had happened now if this was a new</p>
<p>thing if we were</p>
<p>watching a new</p>
<p>thing and there was a channel on</p>
<p>television that was</p>
<p>dedicated 24</p>
<p>hours to these new people</p>
<p>that wear robes and walk around in a circle</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a sacred box</p>
<p>that they have to come to from all over the fucking</p>
<p>world and they just</p>
<p>spend hours and</p>
<p>hours walk around the circle</p>
<p>to this box</p>
<p>we would shut that fucking</p>
<p>thing down so</p>
<p>quick there</p>
<p>would be arms</p>
<p>fucking men outside with tanks</p>
<p>and jets ready to drop bombs to be like</p>
<p>what the fuck is in the box you freaks</p>
<p>what do you got a time machine there</p>
<p>stupid what the fuck you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dressing like you</p>
<p>dressed a thousand years ago and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>touching a box</p>
<p>is this fucking</p>
<p>thing gonna</p>
<p>take you back to a thousand years ago tell me why you</p>
<p>dressed like</p>
<p>that and they pray to it don&rsquo;t forget that they bow</p>
<p>to it constantly</p>
<p>and they always</p>
<p>know where it is yep and they</p>
<p>touch it they move around they want to</p>
<p>touch it and people</p>
<p>pile through and eventually get to the center and</p>
<p>touch it they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>touching it all around it and around the people</p>
<p>touching it</p>
<p>is just layer upon</p>
<p>layer upon layer upon</p>
<p>layer of people</p>
<p>thousands and thousands i don&rsquo;t know how many thousands</p>
<p>just moving</p>
<p>around in a circle milling around this thing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really i&rsquo;d like to go to it man i&rsquo;d like to see</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just fascinating that how this is what i wanted to</p>
<p>bring up like how does that happen</p>
<p>how does a meme how does an idea become so</p>
<p>powerful that all of</p>
<p>these people like a billion of them all over the</p>
<p>world i mean what is the numbers of</p>
<p>islam is it a billion</p>
<p>something like that i have no idea probably at least</p>
<p>right yeah i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but i mean let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s not whatever it is</p>
<p>giant numbers of</p>
<p>humans all around the world</p>
<p>all follow this one pattern</p>
<p>and they really do all want to make this</p>
<p>pilgrimage to mecca and they really do say it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incredible spiritual awakening</p>
<p>it symbolizes so much to them</p>
<p>that even if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>placebo effect</p>
<p>going there and being in the presence of this thing and</p>
<p>touching it</p>
<p>and being around all</p>
<p>these people that are like oh my god i&rsquo;m at mecca</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at mecca</p>
<p>today and it</p>
<p>forces everyone to be holy</p>
<p>forces everyone</p>
<p>to try to follow the tenets of this religion and really</p>
<p>believe in the love that</p>
<p>this group brings everybody together</p>
<p>their religion has so much more</p>
<p>power that it full than anybody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nobody else is willing to make that sort of commitment</p>
<p>so because of this intense bond</p>
<p>this intense commitment they have</p>
<p>this is one of the</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>makes them the most dangerous don&rsquo;t they pray</p>
<p>three times a day</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how many times i pray whatever happened to that kid</p>
<p>that everyone thought was like this born</p>
<p>again god that just like</p>
<p>lived next to a tree remember and they were like</p>
<p>he would just sit there quiet</p>
<p>quietly for</p>
<p>days and not eat and everyone no that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>he was living in a tree</p>
<p>that was in</p>
<p>india wasn&rsquo;t it yeah</p>
<p>never having a kid</p>
<p>was it india yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know where i</p>
<p>think it was india yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know for sure but i remember that it was</p>
<p>crazy and then he</p>
<p>went off into</p>
<p>the woods he was getting all this attention</p>
<p>and he said he needed to go where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quieter because he was trying to</p>
<p>do some intense thing</p>
<p>and he was even</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember the</p>
<p>exact words he said but he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i am not buddha but i am</p>
<p>some sort of</p>
<p>incarnation of the something something it was really</p>
<p>weird creepy</p>
<p>and then he just kind of disappeared</p>
<p>maybe he was</p>
<p>a crazy kid in india</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s just over</p>
<p>there eating mushrooms talking shit living in the woods</p>
<p>and then when</p>
<p>people come around interview him he just touched</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so high he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even know what he&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>right he just</p>
<p>starts talking about</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the incarnation of the buddha</p>
<p>in the islam and</p>
<p>sing me some shit i</p>
<p>am this awesome fucking</p>
<p>professor in college and he got me</p>
<p>he basically</p>
<p>taught me into</p>
<p>going to india i went to</p>
<p>india for several weeks because of him wow</p>
<p>because i took a course called introduction to</p>
<p>southeast asia but</p>
<p>he said in india what happens is</p>
<p>hundred two hundred years ago holy man</p>
<p>someone someone considers a guru drops a glove or</p>
<p>does some little</p>
<p>thing or eats a melon</p>
<p>next to some certain place and</p>
<p>throws it down and then his falls are like oh let&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s enshrine</p>
<p>this place where the seed from the</p>
<p>melon our master8</p>
<p>is and then a temple eventually springs up around that</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>india&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>scattered with</p>
<p>shrines and temples and all</p>
<p>these bizarre</p>
<p>constructs that come from</p>
<p>very specific</p>
<p>events in the</p>
<p>cause hinduism isn&rsquo;t just like one religion</p>
<p>one religion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fragmentation of all</p>
<p>these different ideas people who worship brahm and</p>
<p>people who worship vishnu</p>
<p>people who worship shiva</p>
<p>people who worship demigods</p>
<p>david it&rsquo;s all kinds of shit it&rsquo;s not just one thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a fragmentation</p>
<p>of of something they make the coolest art dude</p>
<p>yeah i do they&rsquo;re fucking shiva like this shiva that is</p>
<p>you know someone explain to</p>
<p>me that this is supposed to be the the god of cannabis</p>

<p>thing that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>standing on the bottom yeah that&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>ignorance right and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why he&rsquo;s got a sack that he carries that&rsquo;s his weed</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s his weed</p>
<p>and this all represents fire</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s standing over</p>
<p>ignorance you</p>
<p>would think a</p>
<p>dollar bill you</p>
<p>would think</p>
<p>ignorance would be way bigger</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little baby</p>
<p>ignorance it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>optimistic it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>small ignorance</p>
<p>speaking ignorance can i show you this yeah</p>
<p>yeah what is it</p>
<p>and so what is this</p>
<p>what explain what we&rsquo;re</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s america</p>
<p>this is all what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about man this</p>
<p>should happen to the greeks</p>
<p>we have it to the</p>
<p>romans and happen to everybody</p>
<p>eventually the fucking</p>
<p>tribe gets watered down</p>
<p>to the point where there&rsquo;s so many of these</p>
<p>fuckheads that people want to pay attention to them</p>
<p>and even want to</p>
<p>elect one of</p>
<p>their own to be the king of the</p>
<p>world you know</p>
<p>people like that look at the size</p>
<p>of that audience man there were thousands of people</p>
<p>last time you</p>
<p>had a thousand people for your fucking show</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a long time</p>
<p>joe exactly</p>
<p>this is ridiculous man you need to work that church</p>
<p>angle shit there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>money in that</p>
<p>search son you don&rsquo;t even have to</p>
<p>write good comedy just throw some</p>
<p>jesus in there and hahaha</p>
<p>say gosh and golly</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>swear baldwin</p>
<p>that shit even with</p>
<p>terrence mckinnon</p>
<p>his lectures he</p>
<p>could throw lobs</p>
<p>some softballs and</p>
<p>just kill man</p>
<p>or deepak chope or any time you listen to any of</p>
<p>those guys things america</p>
<p>you have to be a</p>
<p>dummy not to see the game</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s america that&rsquo;s america rah rah</p>
<p>god&rsquo;s gun and government</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with god there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with government there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with having guns but you get all</p>
<p>three of them together</p>
<p>and it creates this</p>
<p>weird fucking hybrid mentality</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s america</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>think too much</p>
<p>you have to think</p>
<p>about the fact you&rsquo;re getting fucked by gangsters</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s but it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the sappiness of it it&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not recognizing what the fuck is really going on</p>
<p>when everybody&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>god guns and government</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all well and good if there was a real bad guy</p>
<p>and if it was a real situation</p>
<p>where we didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong</p>
<p>but when you run</p>
<p>the country&rsquo;s run by</p>
<p>gangsters when you just assume some gangster</p>
<p>shit is going down</p>
<p>dick cheney was the fucking ceo</p>
<p>of haliburton before he gets into office</p>
<p>gets into office is</p>
<p>basically running shit right</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden halburton gets</p>
<p>billion dollars of no</p>
<p>bid contracts to fix up iraq</p>
<p>because we just decide to drop fucking bombs on them</p>
<p>and he profits off of it</p>
<p>he has hella burton stock and</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gangster what the fuck is nobody does anything</p>
<p>i would say in my act</p>
<p>he shot his</p>
<p>friend in his face and his friend apologized</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s as gangster as you get</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gangster shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some al capone shit</p>
<p>these fucking people</p>
<p>started a war and made</p>
<p>money off it</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s america</p>
<p>so think about the idea of it</p>
<p>we got a problem</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna just what</p>
<p>if haliburton</p>
<p>first of all there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something like 90 billion dollars that&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like some insane amount of</p>
<p>money that&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>think about if</p>
<p>haliburton was a one person</p>
<p>if it was one person and they</p>
<p>stole 90 billion dollars</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just do that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the fucking money</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s a gigantic</p>
<p>corporation it&rsquo;s like oh what happened there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>paperwork and who knows</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>if we can find it it&rsquo;s probably around here somewhere</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some fucking straight gangster shit look at</p>
<p>what i like is like</p>
<p>cause we can talk</p>
<p>about it like this and nothing&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>gonna happen to us like no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get us</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be okay but</p>
<p>i like watching when someone</p>
<p>in russia pushes</p>
<p>no here when someone pokes the dragon enough</p>
<p>where it tries to snap like that wikileaks guy oh</p>
<p>yeah you know what i mean when they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to put that rape charge on him yeah the rape charge</p>
<p>and you watch him</p>
<p>he went cause i saw this awesome</p>
<p>lecture with him as he was just</p>
<p>starting to do it and</p>
<p>he had all this life in him and this energy and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like seemed like a hero and then you cut to</p>
<p>four months</p>
<p>later he looks like a</p>
<p>ghost he&rsquo;s tired</p>
<p>beat down because they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>applying the cia pressure</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t be with a girl</p>
<p>if he meets a girl</p>
<p>in the back of his head he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta think</p>
<p>does this girl really like me</p>
<p>right or is this an operative who got sin in</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>shit too that&rsquo;s real well they did it a rape</p>
<p>charge on that guy that happened to coincide with him</p>
<p>releasing the biggest military leak in the united</p>
<p>states history how hilarious is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so transparent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the most</p>
<p>transparent shit ever</p>
<p>unless he really raped somebody</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like nobody believe me</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m such a good guy yeah</p>
<p>going on no he</p>
<p>come on really fuck those</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know that guy but also it</p>
<p>would be weird if he was</p>
<p>like a really good guy in some ways but a douchebag in</p>
<p>other ways well i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a possibility i don&rsquo;t know him that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a better chance that they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>frame it yes much better</p>
<p>chance didn&rsquo;t he send a pdf out that was encrypted</p>
<p>or something something like that and if he vanishes</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>weird happens to him then he&rsquo;s sending the password out</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it</p>
<p>would change much</p>
<p>i think people</p>
<p>would go wow somebody killed him</p>
<p>oh well what&rsquo;s paul abdul doing that</p>
<p>crazy bitch</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s driving</p>
<p>drunk again</p>
<p>i hope people</p>
<p>would find some</p>
<p>new distraction</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t do anything that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>weird about ourselves well the only</p>
<p>way we are gonna do</p>
<p>everything is if we change</p>
<p>and the only way we are</p>
<p>gonna change is if the</p>
<p>introduction of new ideas gets to the people at the top</p>
<p>if the people at the very top of the food</p>
<p>chain that are doing the most fucked up</p>
<p>things in the</p>
<p>world we gotta get them</p>
<p>to have a look at this</p>
<p>we gotta get them to realize</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re creating this gigantic</p>
<p>volcano of shit energy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not necessary you don&rsquo;t have to do it this way</p>
<p>everybody could figure out some way to make this</p>
<p>thing work a lot better take this</p>
<p>right sit down we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna turn the lights out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right keep</p>
<p>about an hour and 20 minutes i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna come back in and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a conversation</p>

<p>the lead in i dream a genie what&rsquo;s that actor&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s gotta know that</p>

<p>that was so</p>
<p>disappointing when they</p>
<p>came out and showed how easy it was to make this</p>
<p>thing yeah but they didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>they did in a lot of the designs</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of designs that are very questionable</p>
<p>i would like to see how they did it because</p>
<p>some of them are incredibly complex they&rsquo;re fractals</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re amazingly</p>
<p>precise and they&rsquo;re huge and they appear so quickly</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not inclined</p>
<p>to believe that all of them are done by the same people</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very possible that some of them are done by some new</p>
<p>crazy technology</p>
<p>that we have maybe in</p>
<p>satellite form i mean</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>a lot of them</p>
<p>appeared in</p>
<p>the past but they were not intricate like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a thing about them from like the 1600s i believe it</p>
<p>might have even been</p>
<p>slightly earlier than that</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a drawing of a devil</p>
<p>with a sickle making a crop circle and a lot</p>
<p>of the crop circle people they look at that as evidence</p>
<p>but there was</p>
<p>never anything like they see</p>
<p>today like they&rsquo;re far more complex like the</p>
<p>mandelbrot set</p>
<p>the fractal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like this infinite beautiful fractal</p>
<p>when they figured it out mathematically on a computer</p>
<p>within like weeks</p>
<p>someone had</p>
<p>drawn it in a crop circle</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s either</p>
<p>alien saying oh you get it or it&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>fucking really funny</p>
<p>government scientists with this</p>
<p>crazy ability to</p>
<p>transform matter or</p>
<p>plants on the ground with this laser beam</p>
<p>they can make a design in the wheat</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>more likely that it&rsquo;s some sort of a weapon</p>
<p>or not even a weapon or</p>
<p>maybe it was something</p>
<p>that was developed as they were developing weapons</p>
<p>and then they realized that you</p>
<p>could make it was such a</p>
<p>powerful pulsating move</p>
<p>you know this beam</p>
<p>that you can make designs in the</p>
<p>grass with it i mean it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>you think of all the shit they have that we didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about for the longest time like</p>
<p>stealth bombers and shit and who knows</p>
<p>the fuck they&rsquo;re working on an area 51</p>
<p>they could have</p>
<p>somebody at the top of the heap</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a local college and all the art students</p>
<p>every year have to do like</p>
<p>three of them per</p>
<p>class and it&rsquo;s like this big school</p>
<p>secret well</p>
<p>those motherfuckers deserve some</p>
<p>money they should be coming out and bragging</p>
<p>about it i mean</p>
<p>the circle makers is a guy</p>
<p>the bunch of guys called the circle makers</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve made a</p>
<p>bunch of them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve shown there they&rsquo;re pretty good i mean</p>
<p>no doubt about it</p>
<p>but the ones that</p>
<p>the other ones that people have not</p>
<p>this is all shit that i&rsquo;ve read on the internet and</p>
<p>watched in documentary so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not exactly sure if it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true rather</p>
<p>but the way they describe these</p>
<p>stalks being bent</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they have</p>
<p>these growth nodes</p>
<p>where it explodes like</p>
<p>almost like it&rsquo;s been microwaved</p>
<p>like it expands out from heat and then blows up</p>
<p>where it bends over</p>
<p>and that these</p>
<p>exist all throughout</p>
<p>these patterns and</p>
<p>those patterns</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>exist like that during</p>
<p>just stomping them down with boards so</p>
<p>it may very well be that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different ways that people have done</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>the one thing i thought</p>
<p>when i was trying</p>
<p>to believe in crop circles is well if there was a</p>
<p>super intelligent thing</p>
<p>sending signals through space</p>
<p>then maybe they&rsquo;d figured out that part of</p>
<p>evolution is that whatever the species was</p>
<p>would learn to plant</p>
<p>crops or something</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re trying to communicate through the food</p>
<p>source you know</p>
<p>stamp the food source so that</p>
<p>totally makes</p>
<p>sense i mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re guaranteeing that people are</p>
<p>gonna see it</p>
<p>especially if</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t really see us</p>
<p>what if their vision and</p>
<p>their need for vision is so entirely different than us</p>
<p>that they literally can&rsquo;t see us</p>
<p>but they know where</p>
<p>plants are and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like not even in this dimension</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re communicating through some sort of a portal</p>
<p>and the way they</p>
<p>can communicate through this portal is by implanting</p>
<p>these designs onto what they know is</p>
<p>going to be food</p>
<p>because they know that oh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve received a certain signal from this area this</p>
<p>indicates that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>plant life and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s grown in</p>
<p>large areas that seem to be uniform</p>
<p>which indicates</p>
<p>that someone is growing it on purpose</p>
<p>so it must be their food</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>leave designs in this food</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>it could be but it also</p>
<p>could be some fucking</p>
<p>dudes with boards</p>
<p>but some of them are amazing though</p>
<p>i believe that some of them could be</p>
<p>some of them are for sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>things like that though like if you</p>
<p>look at any artist doing something and you didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>an artist did that like if you go out in the middle</p>
<p>of a pyramid and some artists worked on you</p>
<p>know overnight with</p>
<p>making this masterpiece and you just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think it</p>
<p>would be like anyone had access to this pyramid</p>
<p>and you just saw it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably</p>
<p>think wow how the fuck was this made you know</p>
<p>to me i look at a lot of</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>and to me it looks like okay this is something like a</p>
<p>bunch of people</p>
<p>plan this shit out and they just</p>
<p>fucking it&rsquo;s like graffiti almost</p>
<p>possible and there&rsquo;s towns that they&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>found in they&rsquo;re like poor towns that</p>
<p>their only income is people</p>
<p>going to see these</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>stuff like that yeah like in england</p>
<p>pop circles that is a good</p>
<p>point right</p>
<p>yeah if you set up like roadside signs and sell</p>
<p>lemonade you get a fucking mint</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>clean it up yeah</p>
<p>that was an</p>
<p>issue that i had</p>
<p>about the whole ufo</p>
<p>experience too</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like the problem i have with believing</p>
<p>ufos is that people are selling books</p>
<p>and people are making money</p>
<p>and when you</p>
<p>start making</p>
<p>money and you&rsquo;re an author</p>
<p>i was making fun of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the guy&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>that wrote communion whitley striber</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>premier guy who&rsquo;s been abducted by</p>
<p>aliens also happens to be a fucking</p>
<p>brilliant fiction writer</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>wrote wolfin</p>
<p>he wrote that werewolf</p>
<p>movie wolfin</p>
<p>which is god one of the fucking coolest werewolf</p>
<p>movies ever</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t really werewolves they were just</p>
<p>super intelligent wolves</p>
<p>and who was the fucking main star in that movie</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t seen that god</p>
<p>damn that movies a good</p>
<p>movie i&rsquo;m buying that shit on itunes</p>
<p>today bitch</p>
<p>to the wolf</p>
<p>and they better have that i bet they don&rsquo;t man</p>
<p>you know itunes is just getting the beatles like now</p>
<p>fucking man that&rsquo;s so old i remember that</p>
<p>thing what is</p>
<p>the guy&rsquo;s name who is the main star that came out</p>
<p>right around when the howling came out didn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>it was even a little like a werewolf wave</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s my shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>fucking subject</p>
<p>would beat to</p>
<p>death on this</p>
<p>you talk about the howling</p>
<p>on this book</p>
<p>no we&rsquo;re obsessed by</p>
<p>werewolves bro</p>
<p>oh werewolves</p>
<p>asked by werewolves no they don&rsquo;t have it of course not</p>
<p>you fucking clowns</p>
<p>have you been</p>
<p>checking amazon lately i&rsquo;ve noticed</p>
<p>every time i buy a cd now i just go to amazon</p>
<p>first because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like itunes there was something</p>
<p>the other day</p>
<p>white buffalo</p>
<p>which is a local la guy that&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>i went on itunes it was like</p>
<p>12 99 then went on amazon</p>
<p>it was 8 99</p>
<p>albert finney</p>
<p>thing tooth</p>
<p>oh this is dvd two thousand two that&rsquo;s not when the</p>
<p>movie came out</p>
<p>bitch that&rsquo;s when the dvd was released</p>
<p>the wolf and whitley</p>
<p>striver paperback</p>
<p>wow that you</p>
<p>still buy a vhs</p>
<p>incredible i wonder when the</p>
<p>movie came out though</p>
<p>i know the dvd came out i own</p>
<p>nineteen eighty one bro i was a</p>
<p>freshman in high</p>
<p>school this</p>
<p>movie was the shit</p>
<p>two day one</p>
<p>click please</p>
<p>give me that shit</p>
<p>i need to watch that movie</p>
<p>dude have you seen the</p>
<p>mandal bulb have you seen the 3d</p>
<p>projections</p>
<p>i have that shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy man the fractal</p>
<p>yeah fractals are insane the idea behind fractals is</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really probably the fact</p>
<p>of the universe the fabric of</p>
<p>everything is that it is infinitely</p>
<p>small and infinitely</p>
<p>large and it goes at no end</p>
<p>to just keep going and going and going</p>
<p>and it never stops there&rsquo;s never a</p>
<p>smallest point ever</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think we can wrap our heads around that</p>
<p>we think that well there should be</p>
<p>you know and you know everything gets</p>
<p>smaller and smaller well there has to be some infinite</p>
<p>small point no no</p>
<p>no it just it&rsquo;s almost like a line</p>
<p>of code like just goes into another line like it is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re connected</p>
<p>like dimension to dimension it just gets infinitely</p>
<p>small and expands out again</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s intense yeah</p>
<p>you wanna hear intense there&rsquo;s a big controversy</p>
<p>right now because</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>obama has a kids book</p>
<p>and in this kids book</p>
<p>he fucking talks about how</p>
<p>great sitting bull is</p>
<p>sitting bull is</p>
<p>he says a medicine man</p>
<p>who healed broken</p>
<p>hearts and broken promises</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it is fine</p>
<p>that we are different</p>
<p>the book whose</p>
<p>royalties go to</p>
<p>helping the children fallen or disabled service members</p>
<p>also says that the lakota chief</p>
<p>spoke out and led his people</p>
<p>against many</p>
<p>policies of the united</p>
<p>states government</p>
<p>he is most famous for his</p>
<p>stunning victory in 1876</p>
<p>over lieutenant</p>
<p>colonel george armstrong cuts custer</p>
<p>in the battle of little bighorn</p>
<p>so basically he&rsquo;s got a fucking</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the president of a nation</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s praising a guy taking a side</p>
<p>on you know</p>
<p>a native american</p>
<p>that killed a</p>
<p>bunch of american citizens</p>
<p>like what is that all</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird choice</p>
<p>because i understand that you</p>
<p>think that war is bad and i</p>
<p>understand that you</p>
<p>think that imperialism and</p>
<p>everything that got us here and created</p>
<p>earth or created</p>
<p>america rather</p>
<p>earth it&rsquo;s your focal</p>
<p>the rest in</p>
<p>front of you</p>
<p>i understand that you</p>
<p>would think that that&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a wrong</p>
<p>thing that happened it&rsquo;s terrible that happened but</p>
<p>you know what a</p>
<p>weird choice</p>
<p>to you know obviously</p>
<p>that we won</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>happened and that&rsquo;s why people are here and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the cities</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re a part of this that won so</p>
<p>i guess what you&rsquo;re saying is we won in a terrible way</p>
<p>and we took over the indians in a terrible way</p>
<p>and thank goodness that they got some licks in</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s give them props</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>just kicked our ass a little</p>
<p>bit and like</p>
<p>bring them back into the fold and say like okay</p>
<p>well this is a man that had a lot of</p>
<p>value to his people</p>
<p>and our people</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t exactly</p>
<p>fucked up but let&rsquo;s put bygones pick them</p>
<p>up bygones and let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about what a badass this dude was i mean they had like</p>
<p>bows and arrows and they were</p>
<p>fresh new divorces you know what i mean</p>
<p>like they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>horses for like a hundred years or so</p>
<p>and they they kicked ass on custard with his guns</p>
<p>you know i mean they had some guns back then too but</p>
<p>you know they they fucking</p>
<p>trapped the american</p>
<p>citizens they fucking</p>
<p>suck them into a trap</p>
<p>well i can see out like a</p>
<p>black president</p>
<p>would be pretty cool</p>
<p>with somebody who but it&rsquo;s an interesting choice right</p>
<p>well i get it though because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like i mean it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago that the united</p>
<p>states government was</p>
<p>enslaving his ancestors</p>
<p>so it totally makes</p>
<p>sense that you idolize it</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t ever say that you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>he never comes out</p>
<p>fully expresses himself he</p>
<p>never comes out and says this is what&rsquo;s important to me</p>
<p>about this i</p>
<p>understand that this man killed american</p>
<p>citizens and i</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t for</p>
<p>battles like this we would</p>
<p>still have problems with indians attacking us and we</p>
<p>could never have the same life that we have now</p>
<p>somebody had to pave the way supposedly to do this</p>
<p>i understand that he</p>
<p>would say that but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gotta in my opinion at</p>
<p>least you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotta kinda explain</p>
<p>where your head&rsquo;s at with all this</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just show</p>
<p>tweedom he&rsquo;s following you</p>
<p>yeah but you can&rsquo;t just say</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>most famous for his</p>
<p>stunning victory in 1876</p>
<p>what you gotta say is</p>
<p>we have to get past all this</p>
<p>stuff and recognize that even though</p>
<p>america was evil</p>
<p>or we did something that we shouldn&rsquo;t have done</p>
<p>or you know we took over</p>
<p>their land and fucked them over and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s all let that shit go</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s not me and it&rsquo;s not you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s our ancestors</p>
<p>we have learned from this and we are</p>
<p>stronger because of this</p>
<p>but what people don&rsquo;t like to hear is lakota</p>
<p>you know that name lakota</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what they call themselves</p>
<p>but you know what the indians</p>
<p>call them sioux</p>
<p>cause sue means enemy</p>
<p>cause the lakotas</p>
<p>would just run around jacking folks</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s what they did</p>
<p>indians did the same</p>
<p>thing that we did they just did it on a shitty smaller</p>
<p>scale the sun ritual you know the sun rich what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it called what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that called it&rsquo;s not the sun it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>what the fuck is that called they put hooks in the</p>
<p>chest yeah from was that movie um</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>what is his name</p>
<p>god sundance it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>sun like the sundance festivals</p>
<p>named after it was</p>
<p>called is it really yeah the sundance and what it is</p>
<p>is when you</p>
<p>go think a man called horse</p>
<p>yeah man called</p>
<p>horse and it was an</p>
<p>initiatory phase</p>
<p>where they would hang themselves</p>
<p>from trees or from something with hooks through</p>
<p>their chests and just hang there with</p>
<p>their skin kind</p>
<p>of being pulled out yeah what was the reason for that</p>
<p>i think it was an</p>
<p>initiation thing i</p>
<p>guess i have no idea i assume it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s something to that i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s something to</p>
<p>initiations i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s something to</p>
<p>grand events like this hodge like</p>
<p>the pilgrimage to mecca i</p>
<p>think there is something to that man</p>
<p>and i think that</p>
<p>might be one of the</p>
<p>reasons why people are fucked up is we don&rsquo;t have very</p>
<p>clearly defined moments</p>
<p>where you have</p>
<p>to get your shit together you are a man now this is it</p>
<p>move on bam you hit the next</p>
<p>stage let&rsquo;s acknowledge the fact altogether that we are</p>
<p>evolving together we have reached this new plateau</p>
<p>father have gone to the mountain</p>
<p>you got to do some shit</p>
<p>put your hands in the</p>
<p>gloves with the hands in the</p>
<p>gloves with the bullet</p>
<p>ants and get fucked up</p>
<p>you know get past your pain figure something</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s what i said</p>
<p>earlier man</p>
<p>about the greeks and the</p>
<p>romans i think people get soft as fuck</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>you dirty dirty bitches</p>
<p>richard harris a man called</p>
<p>horse let me see</p>
<p>while i one</p>
<p>click that shit son</p>
<p>love amazon one</p>
<p>click for movies</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most addictive</p>
<p>thing of all time</p>
<p>i had a professor was really into the lakota</p>
<p>and i asked fascinating i</p>
<p>asked him if he&rsquo;d have you ever done a sun dance</p>
<p>and he was like</p>
<p>that is an inappropriate question oh what a</p>
<p>bitch fuck you i know information&rsquo;s inappropriate</p>
<p>maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t be a fucking</p>
<p>professor do that yeah it was</p>
<p>really kind of</p>
<p>shocking to me that you can&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>me if you done that or like i&rsquo;m supposed to know the</p>
<p>etiquette of the lakota</p>
<p>what forgive me</p>
<p>that i never</p>
<p>learned that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not supposed to ask someone if they did a sundance</p>
<p>what is that you&rsquo;re not supposed to ask that it</p>
<p>no he said that&rsquo;s an inappropriate that&rsquo;s educational</p>
<p>dramas that</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s educational</p>
<p>drama that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>drama you know what it was he didn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>stones for it he didn&rsquo;t want to admit it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is yes</p>
<p>he knows that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little extra</p>
<p>shit yeah well</p>
<p>maybe he wants you to</p>
<p>think that he did it</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>those dudes that</p>
<p>pretends he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>black belt and really he&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>taken karate</p>
<p>a couple of times</p>
<p>my hands are</p>
<p>registered lethal weapons</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>might have been one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>right you just didn&rsquo;t want to let you know</p>
<p>that no of course i didn&rsquo;t do that that&rsquo;s for psychos</p>
<p>he wanted to let you</p>
<p>think maybe this indian kind of</p>
<p>psycho it made me feel like a fucking</p>
<p>asshole though man i was like oh why did i ask him</p>
<p>about it cause he&rsquo;s a douchebag</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a douchebag period if he didn&rsquo;t recognize that</p>
<p>if he honestly got offended</p>
<p>about something that you were</p>
<p>completely and</p>
<p>utterly ignorant about</p>
<p>that means that obviously</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a dummy</p>
<p>is it either a</p>
<p>dummy or a douchebag</p>
<p>you take your pick</p>
<p>you know you can&rsquo;t recognize it people don&rsquo;t recognize</p>
<p>that this is a nutty</p>
<p>thing to talk about</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t recognize that it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>sacred to you</p>
<p>fucking hooks</p>
<p>through your nipples you get suspended through the air</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t ask you that because it&rsquo;s kind of silly</p>
<p>all right inappropriate</p>
<p>inappropriate question</p>
<p>why did you ask why</p>
<p>no i didn&rsquo;t feel like shit</p>
<p>that guy should be fired put your</p>
<p>clothes back on and left didn&rsquo;t you duncan there</p>
<p>should be someone next to him going all right dude</p>
<p>chill the fuck out</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t talk like that that&rsquo;s dumb</p>
<p>you can go back to teaching in</p>
<p>class but we have to let you know</p>
<p>this is real life rules</p>
<p>the idea is you</p>
<p>should be able to ask a professor anything sure</p>
<p>especially i smoked weed with one of my professors</p>
<p>now did you realize i&rsquo;m right before</p>
<p>class and he even had like</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>spray stuff that</p>
<p>so you won&rsquo;t smell like weed</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s smart</p>
<p>smart professor you took a chance with you son</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>professor at my college who was an anthropologist</p>
<p>that studied</p>
<p>psychedelic mushrooms whoa</p>
<p>and he was a</p>
<p>fulbright scholar and he said that</p>
<p>missionaries came to i can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>where it was</p>
<p>maybe it was</p>
<p>south america but the mexico</p>
<p>they came to this</p>
<p>place in mexico with all these</p>
<p>bibles that were</p>
<p>translated into</p>
<p>that were translated</p>
<p>into their language</p>
<p>and no one would</p>
<p>touch the bibles everyone was</p>
<p>avoiding the</p>
<p>bibles and they wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>touch the bibles and</p>
<p>the missionaries were like why aren&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>touching these</p>
<p>bibles the reason is is because they had</p>
<p>translated the</p>
<p>bible into the word of god</p>
<p>which translated which was</p>
<p>these people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>name for mushrooms the word of god</p>
<p>was what they called mushrooms in</p>
<p>their language it</p>
<p>translated into</p>
<p>word of god and so</p>
<p>the reason they didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>touch the bibles</p>
<p>is because if they</p>
<p>ate mushrooms they</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t have sex for like five days before and you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t supposed to eat meat and there was a</p>
<p>purification process and they were looking at the</p>
<p>bible saying oh no we can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>because it means</p>
<p>we have to like we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t gone through the steps that</p>
<p>we do when we eat mushrooms so no sex for five days</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember at the specifics of it</p>
<p>but there was a purification</p>
<p>they had to</p>
<p>undergo before they tripped out</p>
<p>dude i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a place in this</p>
<p>world for ritual</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>we get some sort of comfort</p>
<p>from ritual</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just a ritual of</p>
<p>going to disneyland every year</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something comforting</p>
<p>about it when i was a kid i used to</p>
<p>think that you</p>
<p>know holidays</p>
<p>and shit were fucked holidays who gives a fuck</p>
<p>about christmas</p>
<p>but it was really mostly because my</p>
<p>childhood was</p>
<p>kinda disappointing</p>
<p>you know it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something wrong with rituals like it was rebelling</p>
<p>against something that wasn&rsquo;t fun for me</p>
<p>you know not a</p>
<p>non fun environment growing up</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>for most people</p>
<p>significations like that</p>
<p>where this is you are a man now and</p>
<p>you have reached</p>
<p>a point of wisdom</p>
<p>where especially when they would</p>
<p>actually have to work for it</p>
<p>like say what you want about</p>
<p>someone reaching</p>
<p>go into confirmation</p>
<p>classes to get confirmed as</p>
<p>a christian</p>
<p>or a catholic rather or</p>
<p>what you have to do to</p>
<p>be a man in the jewish religion and read the talmud and</p>
<p>all the shit that ari had to go through</p>
<p>that stuff makes them work</p>
<p>it makes them work toward something</p>
<p>and it makes them at least</p>
<p>believe that at the end of the goal</p>
<p>they have created something there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something different now they&rsquo;ve accomplished something</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve passed into the next thing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably room for that that</p>
<p>might be why we&rsquo;re all fucking lost</p>
<p>you know we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>these like moments of</p>
<p>things happening so</p>
<p>unless you do something difficult</p>
<p>and then learn from it</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t get any growth</p>
<p>you know you just get stagnant like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re designed shitty</p>
<p>well and also what</p>
<p>about that there&rsquo;s like an odd</p>
<p>thing where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not allowed to design new rituals if you&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>by a ritual you have to go by</p>
<p>the catholic ritual or</p>
<p>but why can&rsquo;t you come up</p>
<p>with a new ritual why can&rsquo;t you come up with some new</p>
<p>dangerous because</p>
<p>the the reason why people want to lead people always</p>
<p>is because they want</p>
<p>money and pussy</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>it is that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the conqueror&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ethic that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really what they&rsquo;re looking for conqueror&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ethic yeah so you see like</p>
<p>waco what happens</p>
<p>in waco dudes playing guitar fucking everyone&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got guns everywhere</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>happens that&rsquo;s the reality of beginning religion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s most of the time</p>
<p>the people that want true enlightenment don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna lead they just wanna find</p>
<p>it all they</p>
<p>wanna be comfortable</p>
<p>happy they want everybody to be but they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna be the man</p>
<p>yeah once you</p>
<p>wanna be the man and you&rsquo;re fucking singing songs and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sitting around the campfire talking</p>
<p>about how we can create our own</p>
<p>world shit man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about pussy and</p>
<p>money that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing dude</p>
<p>and it just confuses the fucking message</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s the fucking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a confusing</p>
<p>thing i read this essay by</p>
<p>fuck what&rsquo;s his name</p>
<p>aleister crowley</p>
<p>and he was talking</p>
<p>about the grail and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the paradox of the grail</p>
<p>which is like</p>
<p>the thing that gives you</p>
<p>eternal life but what he was talking</p>
<p>about enlightenment is that</p>
<p>the moment you get it</p>
<p>you can never</p>
<p>enjoy it you you can&rsquo;t want it you can&rsquo;t right</p>
<p>the wanting of the</p>
<p>thing pushes it away</p>
<p>right it only and</p>
<p>by the time you do receive</p>
<p>all the material benefits that it gives you it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter to you anymore</p>
<p>anyway don&rsquo;t you feel like that&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing with comedy</p>
<p>yeah i think that</p>
<p>as if you&rsquo;re looking for comedy if you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>get someone to</p>
<p>laugh it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird paradox</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about the trying it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about just a tuning in</p>
<p>and letting it all happen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same with everything</p>
<p>like that is that&rsquo;s the way to do life right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way to do life outside the ego</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing man</p>
<p>everything as far as comedy goes</p>
<p>everything for me</p>
<p>fucks up when i</p>
<p>start caring</p>
<p>about it in the</p>
<p>wrong way yeah</p>
<p>thinking about it</p>
<p>under the wrong eyes like trying to impress people</p>
<p>trying to you know make something it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>not just just</p>
<p>dishonest dishonest</p>
<p>is the best word</p>
<p>you have something forcing it not in tune</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>comics there&rsquo;s like certain</p>
<p>comic that a friend of mine just worked with recently</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to mention any names</p>
<p>a buddy of mine</p>
<p>he middleed for this guy</p>
<p>and the guy just</p>
<p>ate shit every</p>
<p>night and he</p>
<p>was saying how embarrassing it was this guy</p>
<p>is just his act just</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t connecting it was like it felt artificial</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s what happens to some guys they lose</p>
<p>their connection</p>
<p>with whatever it is that</p>
<p>allows you to create creative</p>
<p>things in the</p>
<p>first place and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden it becomes</p>
<p>something fake and something that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what it is and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using it because it&rsquo;s worked before</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to you anymore</p>
<p>cause you lost the fucking</p>
<p>trail yeah there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trail of the</p>
<p>ants in the spot yeah yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in that fucking spiral and you can&rsquo;t get out</p>
<p>and you can i mean you can do that your</p>
<p>whole life if you don&rsquo;t get slapped back in so</p>
<p>how do you slap someone back in you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right they have to slap themselves in</p>
<p>no i think you</p>
<p>can slap somebody back in but you&rsquo;ve got to be</p>
<p>you they have to really respect</p>
<p>you and they have to want us change too yeah</p>
<p>but it definitely can be</p>
<p>done and there&rsquo;s different versions of it but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>ideally what a friend does</p>
<p>it seems to me that it&rsquo;s all a mathematical pattern</p>
<p>it seems to me that from the time the</p>
<p>greeks were around to the</p>
<p>romans and it goes through</p>
<p>the egyptians and the mayans and</p>
<p>every civilization does this</p>
<p>every civilization gets to a</p>
<p>point where people are just soft and fucking</p>
<p>stupid and shit hits the fan</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>then it starts</p>
<p>again and then we</p>
<p>leave the rotting</p>
<p>husks of the society</p>
<p>left behind us as we</p>
<p>start a new one somewhere else</p>
