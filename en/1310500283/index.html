    <p>I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be an alien.</p>
<p>I would like to know.</p>
<p>Two alien civilizations coexisting on a planet,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that look like exactly?</p>
<p>When you see them and they see you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re assuming they have vision,</p>
<p>they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of assumptions they&rsquo;re making.</p>
<p>What human level intelligence has done is quite different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that we remember states</p>
<p>that the universe has existed in before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that we can imagine ones that have never existed</p>
<p>and we can actually make them come into existence.</p>
<p>So you can travel back in time sometimes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You travel forward in time to travel back.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation</p>
<p>with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.</p>
<p>They have each been on this podcast once before</p>
<p>individually and now for their second time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re here together.</p>
<p>Sarah is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist.</p>
<p>Lee is a chemist and if I may say so,</p>
<p>the real life manifestation of Rick from Rick and Morty.</p>
<p>They both are interested in how life originates</p>
<p>and develops both life here on earth and alien life,</p>
<p>including intelligent alien civilizations</p>
<p>out there in the cosmos.</p>
<p>They are colleagues and friends</p>
<p>who love to explore, disagree and debate</p>
<p>nuanced points about alien life.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re calling this an alien debate.</p>
<p>Very few questions to me are as fascinating</p>
<p>as what do aliens look like?</p>
<p>How do we recognize them?</p>
<p>How do we talk to them?</p>
<p>And how do we make sense of life here on earth</p>
<p>in the context of all possible life forms</p>
<p>that are out there?</p>
<p>Treating these questions with the seriousness</p>
<p>and rigor they deserve is what I hope to do</p>
<p>with this conversation and future ones like it.</p>
<p>Our world is shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>We must first be humble to acknowledge this</p>
<p>and then be bold and diving in</p>
<p>and trying to figure things out anyway.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.</p>
<p>First of all, welcome back Sarah, welcome back Lee.</p>
<p>You guys, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re incredible people.</p>
<p>I should say thank you to Sarah</p>
<p>for wearing really awesome boots.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll probably overlay a picture later on,</p>
<p>but why the hell didn&rsquo;t you dress up, Lee?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>This is me dressed up.</p>
<p>You were saying that you&rsquo;re pink,</p>
<p>that your thing is pink.</p>
<p>My thing is black and white, the simplicity of it.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the pink?</p>
<p>When did the pink, when did it hit you</p>
<p>that pink is your color?</p>
<p>I became pink about, I don&rsquo;t know, actually, maybe 2017.</p>
<p>Did you know me when you first?</p>
<p>I think I met you pre pink.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so about 2017, I think.</p>
<p>I just decided I was boring</p>
<p>and I needed to make a statement</p>
<p>and red was too bright, so I went pink, salmon pink.</p>
<p>Well, I think you were always pink.</p>
<p>You just found yourself in 2017.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an amazing photo of him</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like everybody in their black gown</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just wearing the pink pants.</p>
<p>Oh, that was at the Waggonen University.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally nuts.</p>
<p>100 year anniversary, they got me to give the plenary</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t find that outfit for me,</p>
<p>so they were all wearing these silly hats and these gowns</p>
<p>and there was me dressed up in pink</p>
<p>looking like a complete idiot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re definitely gonna have to find that picture</p>
<p>and overlay it, big full screen, slow motion.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s talk about aliens.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find places we disagree and places we agree,</p>
<p>life, intelligence, consciousness, universe, all of that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a tweet from Neil deGrasse Tyson</p>
<p>stating his skepticism about aliens wanting to visit Earth.</p>
<p>Quote, how egocentric of us to think that space aliens</p>
<p>who have mastered interstellar travel across the galaxy</p>
<p>would give, pardon the French,</p>
<p>would give a shit about humans on Earth.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, would aliens care about visiting Earth,</p>
<p>observing, communicating with humans?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a perspective of aliens, maybe Sarah first.</p>
<p>Are we interesting in the whole spectrum</p>
<p>of life in the universe?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely biased, at least as far as I think right now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the most interesting thing in the universe.</p>
<p>So I would expect based on the intrinsic curiosity</p>
<p>that we have and how much I think that&rsquo;s deeply related</p>
<p>to the physics of what we are,</p>
<p>that other intelligent aliens would want to seek out</p>
<p>examples of the phenomena they are</p>
<p>to understand themselves better.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s kind of a natural thing to want to do.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any kind of judgment</p>
<p>on it being a lesser being or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying you have nothing to learn</p>
<p>by talking to a baby.</p>
<p>You have lots to learn, probably more than you do</p>
<p>talking to somebody that&rsquo;s 90.</p>
<p>So yeah, so I think they absolutely would.</p>
<p>So whatever the phenomena is that is human,</p>
<p>there will be an inkling of the same kind of phenomena</p>
<p>within alien species and they will be seeking that same.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s gotta be some features of us</p>
<p>that are universal.</p>
<p>And I think the ones that are most interesting,</p>
<p>and I hope I live in an interesting universe,</p>
<p>are the ones that are driven by our curiosity</p>
<p>and the fact that our intelligence allows us to do things</p>
<p>that the universe wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do</p>
<p>without things like us existing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna define a lot of terms.</p>
<p>One of them is interesting.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting term to try to define.</p>
<p>Ali, what do you think?</p>
<p>Are humans interesting for aliens?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s take it from our perspective.</p>
<p>We want to go find aliens as a species quite desperately.</p>
<p>So if we put the shoe on the other foot,</p>
<p>of course we&rsquo;re interesting.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m wondering and assuming</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re at the right technological capabilities</p>
<p>to go searching for aliens, then that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So what I mean is,</p>
<p>if there needs to be a massive leap in technology</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>how will aliens prioritize coming to Earth and other places?</p>
<p>But I do think that they would come and find us</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;d want to find out about our culture,</p>
<p>what things are universal.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a chemist.</p>
<p>I would say, well, is the chemistry universal, right?</p>
<p>Are the creatures that we&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>making all this commotion,</p>
<p>are they made of the same stuff?</p>
<p>What does their science look like?</p>
<p>Are they off planet yet?</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s, so I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson</p>
<p>is being slightly pessimistic</p>
<p>and maybe trying to play the tune</p>
<p>that the universe is vast</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not worth them coming here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that,</p>
<p>but I just worry that maybe we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the ability to talk to them.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the universal translator.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the right physics,</p>
<p>but sure, they should come.</p>
<p>We are interesting.</p>
<p>I want to know if they exist.</p>
<p>It would make it easier if they just came.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m going to use your tweets</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s Shakespeare and analyze it.</p>
<p>So Sarah tweeted,</p>
<p>thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.</p>
<p>So how much do you think aliens</p>
<p>are thinking about other aliens, including humans?</p>
<p>So you said, we humans want to visit.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re longing to connect with aliens.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Can you introspect that?</p>
<p>Is that an obvious thing that we should be,</p>
<p>like what are we hoping to understand</p>
<p>by meeting aliens exactly?</p>
<p>Asking as an introvert, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I ask myself this all the time.</p>
<p>Why go out on a Friday night to meet people?</p>
<p>What are you hoping to find?</p>
<p>I think the curiosity, so when I saw Sarah put that tweet,</p>
<p>I think I answered it actually as well,</p>
<p>which was we are thinking about trying to make contact.</p>
<p>So they almost certainly are,</p>
<p>but maybe there&rsquo;s a number of classes.</p>
<p>There are those aliens that have not yet made contact</p>
<p>with other aliens like us.</p>
<p>Those aliens have made contact with just one other alien</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s an anticlimax and slime, right?</p>
<p>And aliens have made contact</p>
<p>with not just one set of intelligent species, but several.</p>
<p>That must be amazing actually.</p>
<p>Literally there are some place in the universe,</p>
<p>there must be one alien civilization.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not make contact with not one,</p>
<p>but two other intelligent civilizations.</p>
<p>So they must be thinking about it.</p>
<p>There must be entire degree courses on aliens,</p>
<p>thinking about aliens and universal cultural norms.</p>
<p>Do you think they will survive the meeting?</p>
<p>And by the way, Lee did respond saying,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all the universe wants.</p>
<p>So Sarah said, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.</p>
<p>Lee said, that&rsquo;s all the universe wants.</p>
<p>And then Sarah responded, cheeky universe we live in.</p>
<p>So cheeky is a cheeky version of the word interesting,</p>
<p>all of which we&rsquo;ll try to define mathematically.</p>
<p>Cheeky might be harder than interesting.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s humor in that too.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a mathematical definition of humor,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll talk about that in a bit.</p>
<p>Oh interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure there is, yeah.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a graduate student alien</p>
<p>looking at multiple alien civilizations,</p>
<p>do you think they survive the encounters?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a tendency to anthropomorphize</p>
<p>a lot of the discussions about alien life,</p>
<p>which is a really big challenge.</p>
<p>So usually when I&rsquo;m trying to think about these problems,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t try to think about us as humans,</p>
<p>but us as an example of phenomenon</p>
<p>that exists in the universe that we have yet to explain.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case</p>
<p>that if I think about the features,</p>
<p>I would argue are most universal about that phenomenon,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s any reason to think</p>
<p>that a first encounter with another lineage</p>
<p>or example of life would be antagonistic.</p>
<p>I think, yeah.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s this kind of assumption,</p>
<p>I mean, going back to Neil deGrasse Tyson&rsquo;s quote,</p>
<p>I mean, it kind of bothers me because there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a physicist,</p>
<p>so I know we have a lot of egos</p>
<p>about how much we can describe the world,</p>
<p>but that there&rsquo;s this like,</p>
<p>because we understand fundamental physics so well,</p>
<p>we understand alien life and we can kind of extrapolate,</p>
<p>and I just think that we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the quest there is really, you know,</p>
<p>really to understand something totally new</p>
<p>about the universe, and that thing just happens to be us.</p>
<p>I agree, I agree.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something else more profound.</p>
<p>I think Neil was just being, again,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just trying to stir the pot.</p>
<p>I would say from a contingency point of view,</p>
<p>I want to know how many ways</p>
<p>does the universe build structures, build memories, right?</p>
<p>And then I want to know if those memories</p>
<p>can interact with each other.</p>
<p>And if you have two different origins of life</p>
<p>and then origins of intelligence,</p>
<p>and then these things become conscious,</p>
<p>surely you want to go and talk to them</p>
<p>and figure out what commonalities you share.</p>
<p>And it might be that we&rsquo;re just unable to conceive</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re going to look like.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just going to be completely different,</p>
<p>you know, infrastructure,</p>
<p>but surely we&rsquo;ll want to go and find out a map.</p>
<p>And surely curiosity is a property</p>
<p>that evolution has made on earth.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t see any reason</p>
<p>that it won&rsquo;t happen elsewhere</p>
<p>because curiosity probably exists</p>
<p>because we want to find innovations in the environment.</p>
<p>We want to use that information to help our technology.</p>
<p>And also curiosity is like planning for the future.</p>
<p>Are they going to fight us?</p>
<p>Are we going to be able to trade with them?</p>
<p>So I think that Neil&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe, you know, I mean, give a shit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, I think that&rsquo;s really down on earth, right?</p>
<p>How would aliens categorize humans, do you think?</p>
<p>How would we?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s put it the other way around.</p>
<p>Slime category.</p>
<p>Maybe, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Maybe we could, the thing is a bit odd, right?</p>
<p>Look at Instagram, Twitter,</p>
<p>all these people taking selfies.</p>
<p>I mean, does the universe</p>
<p>is the ultimate state of consciousness,</p>
<p>thinking beings that take photographs themselves</p>
<p>and upload them to an internet</p>
<p>with other thinking beings looking at each other&rsquo;s photos.</p>
<p>So I think that they will be.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with that?</p>
<p>I did not say there was anything wrong with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s consciousness manifested at scale.</p>
<p>Selfies, Instagram.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the mirror test at scale.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do think that curiosity</p>
<p>is really the driving force</p>
<p>for why we have our technology, right?</p>
<p>If we weren&rsquo;t curious, we wouldn&rsquo;t go out, left the cave.</p>
<p>So I think that,</p>
<p>so I think that Neil&rsquo;s got it completely wrong, in fact.</p>
<p>Actually, of course they&rsquo;d want to come here.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they are coming here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen evidence for that.</p>
<p>I guess we can argue about that, right?</p>
<p>But I think that we want,</p>
<p>I desperately, and I know that Sarah does too,</p>
<p>but I won&rsquo;t speak for you, you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>I desperately want to have missions</p>
<p>to look for life in the solar system right now.</p>
<p>I want to map life over the solar system.</p>
<p>And then I want to understand how we can go</p>
<p>and find life as quickly as possible at the nearest stars,</p>
<p>and also at the same time do it in the lab,</p>
<p>just to compensate, you know?</p>
<p>So, sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, just one more point on this.</p>
<p>If you think about sort of what&rsquo;s driven</p>
<p>the most features of our own evolution as a species,</p>
<p>and try to map that to alien species,</p>
<p>I always think like optimism is what&rsquo;s gonna get us furthest.</p>
<p>And so I think a lot of people always think</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like war and conflict is gonna be the way</p>
<p>that alien species will expand out into the cosmos.</p>
<p>But if you just look at how we&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>and how we talk about it,</p>
<p>so is our future in space is always, you know,</p>
<p>built from narratives of optimism.</p>
<p>And so it seems to me that if intelligence does get out</p>
<p>in the universe, that it&rsquo;s gonna be more optimism</p>
<p>and curiosity driving it than war and conflict,</p>
<p>because those things end up crushing you.</p>
<p>So there might be some selective filter.</p>
<p>Of course, this is me being an optimist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a half full kind of person, but.</p>
<p>Is it obvious that curiosity, not obvious,</p>
<p>but what do you think?</p>
<p>Is curiosity a more powerful force in the universe</p>
<p>than violence and the will to power?</p>
<p>So, because you said you framed curiosity as a way</p>
<p>to also plan on how to avoid violence,</p>
<p>which is an interesting framing of curiosity.</p>
<p>But I could also argue that violence</p>
<p>is a pretty productive way to operate in the world,</p>
<p>which is like, that&rsquo;s one way to protect yourself.</p>
<p>The best defense is offense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not qualified to answer this, but I&rsquo;ll have a go.</p>
<p>I think violence, let&rsquo;s not talk about violence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the summary of this podcast.</p>
<p>I would, yeah, maybe, I would, let&rsquo;s not call it violence,</p>
<p>but I call it erasure.</p>
<p>So if you think about the way evolution works,</p>
<p>or the way, obviously talk about assembly theory,</p>
<p>but I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So if you say you build,</p>
<p>curiosity allows you to open up avenues, new graphs, right?</p>
<p>So new features you can play.</p>
<p>The ability to erase those things allows you to start again</p>
<p>and do some pruning.</p>
<p>So the universe, I think curiosity gets you furthest.</p>
<p>Curiosity gets you rockets that land.</p>
<p>It gets you robots that can make drugs.</p>
<p>It gets you poetry and art and communication.</p>
<p>And then, I often think wouldn&rsquo;t it be great in bureaucracy</p>
<p>to have another world war, not literally a world war now,</p>
<p>please no world war, but the equivalent</p>
<p>so we get remove all the admin bureaucracy, right?</p>
<p>All the admin violence, get rid of it and start again.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because you get layers and you get redundant systems built.</p>
<p>So actually a reset, let&rsquo;s not call it violence,</p>
<p>a reset in some aspects of our culture</p>
<p>and our technology allows us to then build</p>
<p>more important things about the,</p>
<p>because how many cookies do I have to click on?</p>
<p>How many extra clicks do I have in the future of my life</p>
<p>that I could remove and a bit of a reset</p>
<p>would allow us to start again.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s how I suppose our encounter aliens will be.</p>
<p>Maybe they will fight with us and say,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re not as excited by you as we thought.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just get rid of you.</p>
<p>So they might want to reset Earth.</p>
<p>Yeah, why not?</p>
<p>To be like, let&rsquo;s see how the evolution runs again.</p>
<p>This seems like they&rsquo;ve, there&rsquo;s nothing new happening here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re observing for a while.</p>
<p>This is just not, let&rsquo;s keep it more fun.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the fish again.</p>
<p>I like how you equated violence to resetting your cookies.</p>
<p>I suppose that&rsquo;s the kind of violence.</p>
<p>In this modern world where words are violence,</p>
<p>resetting cookies is the kind of violence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where that came from.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s poetic, really.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about life.</p>
<p>What is life?</p>
<p>What is non life?</p>
<p>What is the line between life and non life?</p>
<p>And maybe at any point,</p>
<p>we can pull in ideas of assembly theory.</p>
<p>Like how do we start to try to define life?</p>
<p>And for people listening,</p>
<p>so Sarah identifies as a physicist</p>
<p>and Lee identifies as a chemist.</p>
<p>Of course, they are very interdisciplinary in nature</p>
<p>in general, but so what is life?</p>
<p>Sarah.</p>
<p>I love asking that question</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so absurdly big.</p>
<p>I know, I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my absolute favorite question in the whole universe.</p>
<p>So I think I have three ways of describing it right now.</p>
<p>And I like to say all three of them</p>
<p>because people latch onto different facets of them.</p>
<p>And so the whole idea of what Lee and I are trying to work on</p>
<p>is not to try to define life,</p>
<p>but to try to find a more fundamental theory</p>
<p>that explains what the phenomenon we call life.</p>
<p>And then it should explain certain attributes</p>
<p>and you end up having a really different framing</p>
<p>than the way people usually talk.</p>
<p>So the way I talk about it three different ways.</p>
<p>Life is how information structures matter</p>
<p>across space and time.</p>
<p>Life is, I don&rsquo;t know, this one&rsquo;s from you actually,</p>
<p>simple machines constructing more complex machines.</p>
<p>And the other one is the physics of existence,</p>
<p>so to speak, which is life is the mechanism</p>
<p>the universe has to explore the space of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite.</p>
<p>So can I, yeah, yeah, can I add on to that?</p>
<p>Okay, can you say the physics one again?</p>
<p>Physics of existence.</p>
<p>Yeah, the physics of existence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to call it.</p>
<p>If you think of all the things that could exist,</p>
<p>only certain things do exist.</p>
<p>And I think life is basically the universe&rsquo;s mechanism</p>
<p>of bringing things into physically existing</p>
<p>in the moment now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and what&rsquo;s another one?</p>
<p>So we were debating this the other day.</p>
<p>So if you think about a universe that has nothing in it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of hard to conceive of, right?</p>
<p>Because, and this is where physicists really go wrong.</p>
<p>They think of a universe with nothing in it, they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And you think.</p>
<p>But nonexistence is really hard to think.</p>
<p>Nonexistence, yeah.</p>
<p>And then you think of a universe with everything in it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>And you just have this white blob, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just everything.</p>
<p>But the fact we have discrete stuff in the universe,</p>
<p>Beyonce planets, so you&rsquo;ve got stars, space, planet stuff,</p>
<p>right, the boring stuff, but I would define life</p>
<p>or say that life is where there are architectures,</p>
<p>any architectures, and we should stop fixating</p>
<p>on what is building the architectures to start with.</p>
<p>And the fact that the universe has discrete things</p>
<p>and it is completely mind blowing.</p>
<p>If you think about it for one second,</p>
<p>the fact there&rsquo;s any objects at all,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s, because for me, the object is a proxy</p>
<p>for a machine that built it,</p>
<p>some information being moved around,</p>
<p>actuation, sensing, getting resource,</p>
<p>and building these objects.</p>
<p>So for me, everyone&rsquo;s been obsessing about the machine,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m like, forget the machine, let&rsquo;s see the objects.</p>
<p>And I think in a way that assembly theory,</p>
<p>we realized maybe a few months ago</p>
<p>that assembly theory actually does account for the soul</p>
<p>and the objects, not mystically like say,</p>
<p>Sheldrake&rsquo;s morphic resonance,</p>
<p>or Leibniz&rsquo;s monadology, seeing souls in things.</p>
<p>But when you see an object, and I&rsquo;ve said this before,</p>
<p>but this object is evidence of thought,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a lineage of those objects.</p>
<p>So I think what is fascinating is that,</p>
<p>you put it much more elegantly,</p>
<p>but the barrier between life and non life</p>
<p>is accruing enough memories to then actuate.</p>
<p>So what that means is there are contingency,</p>
<p>there are things that happen in the universe get trapped,</p>
<p>these memories then have a causal effect on the future.</p>
<p>And then when you get those concentrated in a machine,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re actually able in real time,</p>
<p>able to integrate the past, the present with the future,</p>
<p>and do stuff, that&rsquo;s when you are most alive.</p>
<p>You being the machine.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, why is the object,</p>
<p>so one of the ways to define life,</p>
<p>that Sarah said, is simple machines</p>
<p>creating complex machines.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a million questions there.</p>
<p>So how the hell does a simple machine</p>
<p>create a complex machine?</p>
<p>By mutation.</p>
<p>So this is what we were talking about at the beginning,</p>
<p>is you have the minimum replicator, so a molecule.</p>
<p>So this is what I was trying to convince Sarah</p>
<p>of the mechanism get there years ago, I think,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;ve been building on it and saying,</p>
<p>you have a molecule that can copy itself,</p>
<p>but then there has to be some variability,</p>
<p>otherwise it&rsquo;s not gonna get more functional.</p>
<p>So you need to add bits on.</p>
<p>So you have a minimum molecule that can copy itself,</p>
<p>but then it can add bits on,</p>
<p>and that can be copied as well,</p>
<p>and those add ons can give you additional function,</p>
<p>to be able to acquire more stuff to exist.</p>
<p>So existence is weird,</p>
<p>but the fact that there is existence is why there is life,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I realized a few days ago</p>
<p>that there must be, that&rsquo;s why alien life</p>
<p>must be everywhere, because there is existence.</p>
<p>Is there a conservation of cheeky stuff happening?</p>
<p>So how can you keep injecting more complex things?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the machine that creates the object</p>
<p>need to be as or more powerful than the things it creates?</p>
<p>So how can you get complexity from simplicity?</p>
<p>So the way you get complexity from simplicity</p>
<p>is that you, I&rsquo;m just making this up,</p>
<p>but this is kind of my notion,</p>
<p>and you have a large volume of stuff,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re able to get seeds, if you like,</p>
<p>random cues from the environment.</p>
<p>So you just use those objects</p>
<p>to basically write on your tape, ones and zeros, whatever.</p>
<p>And that is necessarily rich, complex, okay?</p>
<p>But it has a low assembliness,</p>
<p>but even though it has a high assembly number,</p>
<p>we can talk about that.</p>
<p>But then when you start to then integrate</p>
<p>that all into a smaller volume, as over time,</p>
<p>and you become more autonomous,</p>
<p>you then make the transition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you think about that.</p>
<p>I think the easiest way to think about it is actually,</p>
<p>which I know is a concept you hate, but I also hate,</p>
<p>which is entropy, but people are more familiar with entropy</p>
<p>than what we talk about in assembly theory.</p>
<p>And also the idea that, like, say physics as we know it</p>
<p>involves objects that don&rsquo;t exist across time,</p>
<p>or as we would say, low memory objects.</p>
<p>So one of the key distinctions that is&hellip;</p>
<p>Low memory objects.</p>
<p>Yeah, so physics is all&hellip;</p>
<p>Physicists are low memory objects.</p>
<p>Low memory objects.</p>
<p>Physicists are creators of low memory objects</p>
<p>or manipulators of low memory objects.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very nice way of putting it.</p>
<p>Okay, sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Sorry to keep interrupting.</p>
<p>No, no, no, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I like it too, it&rsquo;s very funny.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s a good way of phrasing it</p>
<p>because I think this kind of idea we have</p>
<p>in assembly theory is that, you know,</p>
<p>physics as we know it has basically removed time</p>
<p>as being a physical observable of an object.</p>
<p>And the argument I would make is that</p>
<p>when you look at things like water bottles or us,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually things that exist</p>
<p>that have a large extent in time.</p>
<p>So we actually have a physical size and time,</p>
<p>and we measure that with something called</p>
<p>the assembly index in molecules,</p>
<p>but presumably everyone should have sort of a,</p>
<p>do you want to explain what assembly?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s, you know what?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s step back and start at the beginning.</p>
<p>What is assembly theory?</p>
<p>Lee sent me some slides.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big sexy paper coming out probably.</p>
<p>Maybe, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve almost finished it.</p>
<p>Almost, almost finished it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also a summary of science.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost done.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, we&rsquo;re almost done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the history of science.</p>
<p>We are ready to start an interesting discussion</p>
<p>with our peers.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the machine that created the object,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see what the object takes us.</p>
<p>All right, so what is assembly theory?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think the easiest way</p>
<p>for people to understand it is to think about</p>
<p>assembly and molecules,</p>
<p>although the theory is very general.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just apply to molecules.</p>
<p>And this was really Lee&rsquo;s insight,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of funny that I&rsquo;m explaining it, but.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mark you.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, I&rsquo;m ready, I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<p>You have to tell me where I get the check marks minus,</p>
<p>but.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your theory as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>But imagine a molecule,</p>
<p>and then you can break the molecule apart</p>
<p>into elementary building blocks.</p>
<p>They happen to be bonds.</p>
<p>And then you can think of all the ways,</p>
<p>for molecular assembly theory,</p>
<p>you can think of all the ways</p>
<p>of building up the original molecule.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all these paths that you can assemble it.</p>
<p>And the sort of rules of assembly is</p>
<p>you can use pieces that have been generated already.</p>
<p>So it has this kind of recursive property to it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where kind of memory</p>
<p>comes into assembly theory.</p>
<p>And then the assembly index is</p>
<p>the shortest path in that space.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s supposed to be the minimal amount of history</p>
<p>that the universe has to undergo</p>
<p>in order to assemble that particular object.</p>
<p>And the reason that this is significant is</p>
<p>we figured out how to measure that</p>
<p>with a mass spec in the lab.</p>
<p>And we had this conjecture</p>
<p>that if that minimal number of steps</p>
<p>was sufficiently large,</p>
<p>it would indicate that you required a machine</p>
<p>or a system that had information</p>
<p>about how to assemble that specific object</p>
<p>because the combinatorial space of possibilities</p>
<p>is getting exponentially large</p>
<p>as the assembly index is increasing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>so that means there&rsquo;s a sufficiently high assembly index</p>
<p>that if observed in an object</p>
<p>is an indicator that something lifelike created it</p>
<p>or is the object itself lifelike?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>But you might want to make the distinction</p>
<p>that a water bottle is not life,</p>
<p>but it would still be a signature</p>
<p>that you were in that domain of physics</p>
<p>and that I might be alive.</p>
<p>So there will be potentially a lot of arguments</p>
<p>about where the line, at which assembly index</p>
<p>does interesting stuff start to happen.</p>
<p>The point is we can make all the arguments,</p>
<p>but it should be experimentally observable</p>
<p>and Lee can talk more about that part of it.</p>
<p>But the point I want to make about it is</p>
<p>there was always this intuition that I had</p>
<p>that there should be some complexity threshold</p>
<p>in the universe above which you would start to say</p>
<p>whatever physics governs life actually becomes operative.</p>
<p>And I think about it a little bit</p>
<p>like we have Planck&rsquo;s constant,</p>
<p>and we have the fine structure constant.</p>
<p>And then this sort of assembly threshold</p>
<p>is basically another sort of potentially constant of nature.</p>
<p>It might depend on the specific features of the system,</p>
<p>but which we debate about sometimes.</p>
<p>But then when you&rsquo;re past that,</p>
<p>you have to have some other explanation</p>
<p>than the current explanations we have in physics,</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;re in high memory.</p>
<p>The things actually require time for them to exist</p>
<p>and time becomes a physical variable.</p>
<p>The path to the creation of the object is the memory.</p>
<p>So you need to consider that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the point is that&rsquo;s a feature of the object.</p>
<p>So when I think of all the things in this room,</p>
<p>we see the projection of them as a water bottle,</p>
<p>but assembly theory would say that this is a causal graph</p>
<p>of all the ways the universe can create this thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is as an object.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all interacting, a causal graph.</p>
<p>And most of the creativity in the biosphere</p>
<p>is because a lot of the objects that exist now</p>
<p>are huge in their structure across time.</p>
<p>Four billion years of evolution to get to us.</p>
<p>Is it possible to look at me</p>
<p>and infer the history that led to me?</p>
<p>If you, you as an individual might be hard.</p>
<p>You as a representative of a population of objects</p>
<p>that have high assembly</p>
<p>with similar causal history and structure</p>
<p>that you can communicate with, i.e. other humans,</p>
<p>you can infer a lot probably.</p>
<p>Yeah, also with them.</p>
<p>Which we do genomically even.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like,</p>
<p>we have a lot of information in us,</p>
<p>we can reconstruct histories from.</p>
<p>Assembly is saying something slightly deeper.</p>
<p>Yeah, one thing to add.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not just about the object,</p>
<p>but the objects occur</p>
<p>and not just objects with high assembly number,</p>
<p>because you can have random things</p>
<p>that have a high assembly number,</p>
<p>but they must have,</p>
<p>there must be a number of identical copies.</p>
<p>So you know you&rsquo;re getting away from the random,</p>
<p>because you could take a snapshot.</p>
<p>This is why, it&rsquo;s not I hate entropy,</p>
<p>I love entropy when used correctly,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about the problem of entropy,</p>
<p>you have to have a labeler.</p>
<p>And so you can label the beginning and the end,</p>
<p>the start and the finish, you know,</p>
<p>where what you can do in assembly is say,</p>
<p>oh, I have a number of objects in abundance.</p>
<p>They all have these features.</p>
<p>And then you can infer.</p>
<p>And one of the things that we debated a lot,</p>
<p>particularly during lockdown,</p>
<p>because I almost went insane trying to crush the,</p>
<p>produce the assembly equation.</p>
<p>So we came up with the assembly equation.</p>
<p>I had, just imagine this.</p>
<p>So you have a string where,</p>
<p>actually it makes me sick trying to remember it.</p>
<p>It was so, it did my head in for a long time.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I couldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>so if you just have a string of say words,</p>
<p>say, you know, a series of words, series of letters.</p>
<p>So you just have A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, D, D, D.</p>
<p>And you find that object and you just have four A&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>four B&rsquo;s, four C&rsquo;s, four D&rsquo;s together, boom.</p>
<p>Then, and that you measured that.</p>
<p>So you physically measured that string of letters.</p>
<p>Then what you could do is you can infer sub graphs</p>
<p>of maybe the four A&rsquo;s, the four B&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the four C&rsquo;s and the four C&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t see them in the real world.</p>
<p>You just infer them.</p>
<p>And I really got stuck with that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a problem to try and work out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between a long,</p>
<p>you know, a physical object</p>
<p>and this assembly space of the objects</p>
<p>that we realized the best way to put that is infer in time.</p>
<p>So although we can&rsquo;t infer your entire history,</p>
<p>we know at some point the four A&rsquo;s were made,</p>
<p>the four B&rsquo;s was made, the four C&rsquo;s were made,</p>
<p>the four D&rsquo;s were made and they all got added together.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one really interesting thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s come out of the theory,</p>
<p>but the killer when we knew we were going beyond</p>
<p>beyond standard complexity theories,</p>
<p>but incredibly successful is that we realized</p>
<p>we could start to measure these things</p>
<p>for real across domains.</p>
<p>So the assembly index is actually an intrinsic property</p>
<p>of all stuff that you can break into components,</p>
<p>particularly molecules are good</p>
<p>because you can break them up</p>
<p>into smaller molecules, into atoms.</p>
<p>The challenge will be making that more general</p>
<p>across all the domains,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re working on it right now</p>
<p>and I think the theory will do that.</p>
<p>So components, domains,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re talking about basically measuring</p>
<p>the complexity of an object in what,</p>
<p>biology, chemistry, physics,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you mean by domains.</p>
<p>Complexity of tests.</p>
<p>Sociology. Complexity of computers.</p>
<p>Complexity of memes, you know.</p>
<p>Memes? Yep.</p>
<p>What is that, ideas?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so one of the.</p>
<p>Ideas are objects in assembly theory.</p>
<p>Yeah. They are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re physical things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just features of the causal graph.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that I can talk to you right now</p>
<p>is because we&rsquo;re exchanging structure</p>
<p>of our assembly space.</p>
<p>So conversation is the exchanging structures</p>
<p>in assembly space.</p>
<p>What is assembly space?</p>
<p>When I started working on origins of life,</p>
<p>I was writing about something called top down causation,</p>
<p>which a lot of like philosophers are interested in</p>
<p>and people that worry about the mind body problem.</p>
<p>But the whole idea is, you know,</p>
<p>if we have, you know, the microscopic world of physics</p>
<p>is causally complete,</p>
<p>it seems like there&rsquo;s no room for higher level causes</p>
<p>like our thoughts to actually have any impact on the world.</p>
<p>And that didn&rsquo;t, that seems problematic</p>
<p>when you get to studying life and mind</p>
<p>because it does seem that quote unquote,</p>
<p>emergent properties do matter to matter.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this other sort of paradoxical situation</p>
<p>where information looks like it&rsquo;s disembodied.</p>
<p>So we talk about information,</p>
<p>like it can just move from any physical system</p>
<p>to any other physical system.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t require,</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t have to specify anything about the substrate</p>
<p>to talk about information.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also the way we talk about mathematics</p>
<p>is also disembodied, right?</p>
<p>Like the platonic world of forms</p>
<p>and I think all of those things are hinging</p>
<p>that we really don&rsquo;t know how to think about abstractions</p>
<p>as physical things.</p>
<p>And really, I think what assembly theory is pointing to</p>
<p>is what we&rsquo;re missing there is the dimension of time.</p>
<p>And if you actually look at an object</p>
<p>being extended across time,</p>
<p>what we call information and the things that look abstract</p>
<p>are things that are entangled</p>
<p>in the histories of those objects.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re features of the overlapping assembly space.</p>
<p>So they look abstract because they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>part of the current structure,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re part of the structure</p>
<p>if you thought about it as like the philosophical concept</p>
<p>of a hyperobject, an object that&rsquo;s too big in time</p>
<p>for us to actually to resolve.</p>
<p>And so I think information is physical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just physical in time, not in space.</p>
<p>Too hyperobject, too difficult for us to resolve.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re supposed to think about of life</p>
<p>as this thing that stretches through time</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a causation chain that led to that thing.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re trying to measure something</p>
<p>with the assembly index about properties of that.</p>
<p>The assembly index is the ordering,</p>
<p>like you could think of it as like a partial ordering</p>
<p>of all the things that can happen.</p>
<p>So in thermodynamics, we coarse grain things</p>
<p>by temperature and pressure.</p>
<p>In assembly theory, we coarse grain</p>
<p>by the number of copies of an object</p>
<p>and the assembly index, which is basically,</p>
<p>if you think of the space of all possible things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a depth of how far you&rsquo;ve gone into that space</p>
<p>and how much time was required to get there.</p>
<p>In the shortest possible version.</p>
<p>The shortest possible version.</p>
<p>Not average, because can&rsquo;t you just 3D?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna kill me with that question.</p>
<p>Not 3D, can&rsquo;t you always 3D print the thing?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s like stab him in the heart.</p>
<p>No, because I had such a fight.</p>
<p>So Sarah&rsquo;s team and my team are writing this paper</p>
<p>at the moment and.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>I think we kind of share the, at the beginning,</p>
<p>you were like, no, that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing this for a bit.</p>
<p>And then the problem is when you build a theory</p>
<p>and build the intuition,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some certain features, right,</p>
<p>of the theory that almost felt like</p>
<p>I was being religious about saying,</p>
<p>right, you have to do this.</p>
<p>A good assembly theorist does this, does this, does this.</p>
<p>And Sarah&rsquo;s postdoc, Daniel, and my postdoc, Abhishek,</p>
<p>and they were both.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both brilliant.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re brilliant, but they were like,</p>
<p>no, we don&rsquo;t buy that.</p>
<p>And I was like, it is, they were like,</p>
<p>well, Lee, actually, I thought you were the first</p>
<p>to say that, you know, you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t explain it, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t do an experiment that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>And that saved me.</p>
<p>And I said to Abhishek,</p>
<p>Abhishek&rsquo;s my postdoc in Glasgow,</p>
<p>Daniel is Sarah&rsquo;s postdoc in ASU.</p>
<p>I was like, I have the experimental data.</p>
<p>So when I basically take the molecules</p>
<p>and chop them up in the mass spec,</p>
<p>the assembly number is never the average.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the shortest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an intrinsic property.</p>
<p>And then the penny drop for Abhishek said, okay.</p>
<p>So I had these things that we had to believe</p>
<p>to start with or to trust,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;d done the math and it comes out.</p>
<p>And they now have the shortest path, actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up, it explains why the shortest path.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why the shortest path is important, not the average.</p>
<p>The shortest path needs you to identify</p>
<p>when the universe has basically got a memory,</p>
<p>not an average.</p>
<p>So what you want to be able to do is to say,</p>
<p>what is the minimum number of features</p>
<p>that I want to be able to see in the universe?</p>
<p>When I find those features,</p>
<p>I know the universe has had a coherent memory</p>
<p>and is basically alive.</p>
<p>And so that gives you the lower bound.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like, of course there&rsquo;s going to be other paths.</p>
<p>We can be more ridiculous, right?</p>
<p>We can have other parts, but it&rsquo;s just the minimum.</p>
<p>So probabilistically at the beginning,</p>
<p>because assembly theory was built</p>
<p>as a measure for biosignatures, I needed to go there.</p>
<p>And then I realized it was intrinsic.</p>
<p>And then Sarah realized it was intrinsic</p>
<p>and these hyperobjects were coming.</p>
<p>And we were kind of fusing that notions together.</p>
<p>And then the team were like, yeah,</p>
<p>but if I have enough energy and I have enough resources,</p>
<p>I might not take the shortest path.</p>
<p>I might go a bit longer.</p>
<p>I might take a really long path</p>
<p>because it allows me then to do something else.</p>
<p>So what you can do is, let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got two different objects, A and B,</p>
<p>and they both have different shortest paths to get them.</p>
<p>But then if you want to make A and B together,</p>
<p>they will have a compromise.</p>
<p>So in the joint assembly space, that might be an average,</p>
<p>but actually it&rsquo;s the shortest way</p>
<p>you can make both A and B</p>
<p>with a minimum amount of resource in time.</p>
<p>So suddenly you then layer these things up.</p>
<p>And so the average becomes not important,</p>
<p>but as you literally overlap those sets,</p>
<p>you get a new shortest path.</p>
<p>And so what we realized time and time again</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re doing the math,</p>
<p>the shortest path is intrinsic, is fundamental,</p>
<p>and is measurable, which is kind of mind blowing.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re talking about, some basic ingredients,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll talk about that, what those basic ingredients</p>
<p>could be and how many steps, when you say shortest path,</p>
<p>how many steps it takes to turn those basic ingredients</p>
<p>into the final meal.</p>
<p>So how to make a, what&rsquo;s the shortest way to make a pizza?</p>
<p>Or a pie.</p>
<p>An apple pie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And a pizza and a pie together.</p>
<p>Or a scratch.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of ways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the shortest way,</p>
<p>and then you take the full spectrum of ways</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s probably an average duration</p>
<p>for a noob to make an apple pie.</p>
<p>Is the average interesting still?</p>
<p>If you measure the average length of the path</p>
<p>to assemble a thing, does that tell you something</p>
<p>about the way nature usually does it?</p>
<p>Versus something fundamental about the object,</p>
<p>which I think is what you&rsquo;re aiming at</p>
<p>with the assembly index.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, we all have to quantify things.</p>
<p>The minimum path gives you the lower bounds.</p>
<p>You know you&rsquo;re detecting something.</p>
<p>You know you&rsquo;re inferring something.</p>
<p>The average tells you about really how the objects</p>
<p>are existing in the ecosystem or the technology.</p>
<p>And there has to be more paths explored</p>
<p>because then you can happen upon other memories</p>
<p>and then condense them down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making too much sense, but if you look and say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say, I mean, maybe we&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>to alien civilizations later, right?</p>
<p>But I would argue very strongly</p>
<p>that alien civilization A and alien civilization B,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re different assembly spaces.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re kind of gonna be a bit messed up</p>
<p>if they happen to come one another,</p>
<p>only when they find some joint overlap in their technology,</p>
<p>because if aliens come to us and they don&rsquo;t share</p>
<p>any of the causal graph we&rsquo;ve showed,</p>
<p>but hopefully they share the periodic table</p>
<p>and bonds and things,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna have to really think about the language</p>
<p>to talk to us aliens by inferring,</p>
<p>by using assembly theory to infer their language,</p>
<p>their technology, and other bits and bobs.</p>
<p>And the shortest path will help you do that quickly.</p>
<p>All right, so all aliens in this causality graphs</p>
<p>have a common ancestor in the&hellip;</p>
<p>If the building blocks are the same,</p>
<p>which means they live in the same universe as us.</p>
<p>So this is the assumption.</p>
<p>It depends on how far back in time you go, though.</p>
<p>But the universe has all the same building blocks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we have to assume that.</p>
<p>So at least there&rsquo;s not different classes</p>
<p>of causality graphs, right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The universe doesn&rsquo;t just say like,</p>
<p>here you get the red causality graph,</p>
<p>and you get the blue one.</p>
<p>These basic ingredients,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re geographically constrained,</p>
<p>or constrained in space or time, or something like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constrained in time</p>
<p>because only by the virtue of the fact</p>
<p>that you need enough time to have passed</p>
<p>for some things to exist.</p>
<p>So the universe has to be big enough in time</p>
<p>for some things.</p>
<p>So just one point on the shortest path</p>
<p>versus the average path,</p>
<p>which I think we&rsquo;ll get to this,</p>
<p>is you had a nice way of saying it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the minimal compression is the shortest path</p>
<p>for the universe to produce that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also like the first time</p>
<p>in the ordering of events</p>
<p>that you might expect to see that object.</p>
<p>But the average path tells you something</p>
<p>about the actual steps that were realized,</p>
<p>and that becomes an emergent property</p>
<p>of that object&rsquo;s interaction with other objects.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an intrinsic feature of that object.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feature of the interactions with other things.</p>
<p>And so one of the nice features of assembly</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve basically gotten rid of,</p>
<p>you just look at the things that exist,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve gotten rid of the mechanisms</p>
<p>for constructing them in some sense.</p>
<p>Like the machines are not as important</p>
<p>in the current construction of the theory,</p>
<p>although I would like to bridge it</p>
<p>to some ideas about constructors.</p>
<p>But then you can only communicate with things</p>
<p>as Lee was saying,</p>
<p>if you have some overlap in the past history.</p>
<p>So if you had an alien species</p>
<p>that had absolutely no overlap,</p>
<p>then there would be no means of communication.</p>
<p>But as we progress further and further in time</p>
<p>and more things become possible</p>
<p>because the assembly spaces are larger,</p>
<p>because you can have a larger assembly space</p>
<p>in terms of index and also just the size of the space,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s exponentially growing,</p>
<p>then more things can happen in the future.</p>
<p>And the example I like to give is actually</p>
<p>when we made first contact with gravitational waves,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s an alien phenomenon</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been permeating our planet,</p>
<p>not alien in life phenomenon,</p>
<p>but alien like something we had never knew existed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been like there&rsquo;s gravitational waves</p>
<p>rippling through this room right now,</p>
<p>but we had to advance to the level of Einstein</p>
<p>writing down his theory of relativity</p>
<p>and then 100 years of technological development</p>
<p>to even quote unquote see that phenomena.</p>
<p>So the, okay, to see that phenomena,</p>
<p>our causal graph have to start intersecting.</p>
<p>Yeah, we needed the idea to emerge first,</p>
<p>the abstraction, right?</p>
<p>And then we had to build the technology</p>
<p>that could actually observe features of that abstraction.</p>
<p>So the nice promising thing is over time,</p>
<p>the graph can grow so we can start overlapping eventually.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the interesting feature of that graph</p>
<p>is there was an event 1.4 billion years away</p>
<p>of a black hole merger that we detected on our detector.</p>
<p>And now suddenly we&rsquo;re connected</p>
<p>through this communication channel</p>
<p>with this distant event in our universe</p>
<p>that if you think about 1.4 billion years ago,</p>
<p>what was happening on this planet</p>
<p>or even further back in time,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s common physics underlying all of those events,</p>
<p>but even for those two events to communicate.</p>
<p>Now I understand what you were going on about</p>
<p>the other week.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m sorry, this is a really abstract example,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of.</p>
<p>Your causal graphs are now overlapping.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s just say now our causal graphs</p>
<p>are overlapping in the deep past.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>No, I like it, so you made it.</p>
<p>I totally missed it.</p>
<p>Oh, the 1.6 billion.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You made a connection with it.</p>
<p>No, I do like that.</p>
<p>No, no, you can tell me what your epiphany is now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Because I was.</p>
<p>And I should get the jokes before 30 seconds after, so.</p>
<p>Oh, I get it now.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>I was slow.</p>
<p>The joke from two minutes ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slow on the uptake here.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to comprehend</p>
<p>what you were talking about when saying</p>
<p>the channel communicating to the past.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re saying is we were able to infer</p>
<p>what happened 1.4 billion years ago.</p>
<p>We detected the gravity wave.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s amazing that at that time,</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t even, we were just becoming multicellular,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like insane.</p>
<p>And then we progressed from multicellularity</p>
<p>through to technology and built the detector</p>
<p>and then we just extrapolate backwards.</p>
<p>So, although we didn&rsquo;t do anything back to the graph</p>
<p>back in time, we understood this existence</p>
<p>then overlapped going forward.</p>
<p>And that.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because our graphs are larger.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that means that has a consequence.</p>
<p>One of the things I was trying to say is I think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Sarah might be, she can correct me,</p>
<p>information first and I&rsquo;m a object first kind of guy.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s things that get constructed.</p>
<p>There has to be this transition in random constructions.</p>
<p>So when the object that&rsquo;s being constructed by the process</p>
<p>bakes in that memory and those memories then add on</p>
<p>and add on and add on.</p>
<p>So as it becomes more competent and life is about</p>
<p>taking those memories and compressing them,</p>
<p>increasing their autonomy.</p>
<p>And so I think that, like the cell that we have</p>
<p>in biology on earth is our way of doing that,</p>
<p>that really the maximum ability to take memories</p>
<p>and to act on the future.</p>
<p>Oh, I think that&rsquo;s mathematics.</p>
<p>No, mathematics doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>The point is that abstractions do exist.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re real physical things.</p>
<p>We call them abstractions.</p>
<p>But the point about mathematics that I think is,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t disagree that I think you&rsquo;re object first</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m information first, but I think I&rsquo;m only</p>
<p>information first in the sense that I think the thing</p>
<p>that we need to explain is what abstractions are</p>
<p>and what they are as physical things</p>
<p>because of all of human history,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve thought that there were these properties</p>
<p>that are disembodied, exist outside of the universe</p>
<p>and really they do exist in the universe</p>
<p>and we just don&rsquo;t understand what their physics is.</p>
<p>So I think mathematics is a really good example.</p>
<p>We do theoretical physics with math,</p>
<p>but imagine doing physics of math</p>
<p>and then thinking about math as a physical object.</p>
<p>And math is super interesting.</p>
<p>I think this is why we think it describes reality so well</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the most copyable kind of information.</p>
<p>It retains its properties</p>
<p>when you move it between physical media,</p>
<p>which means that it&rsquo;s very deep.</p>
<p>And so it seems to describe the universe really well,</p>
<p>but it probably is because it&rsquo;s information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very deep in our past.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, we invented a way of communicating it</p>
<p>very effectively between us.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t math more fundamental?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the assembly of the graph,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t basically, I sound completely boring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like math, assembly theory invented math, but it did.</p>
<p>It has to be.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what is math exactly?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice simplification,</p>
<p>a simple description of what?</p>
<p>So we have a computer scientist,</p>
<p>a physicist, and a chemist here.</p>
<p>Walking to a bar.</p>
<p>I think the chemist is gonna define math</p>
<p>and you guys can correct me.</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>I would say.</p>
<p>Lay in on us, Lee.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re ready.</p>
<p>I think the ability to label objects</p>
<p>and place them into classes</p>
<p>and then do operations on the objects is what math is.</p>
<p>So on that point,</p>
<p>what does it mean to be object first</p>
<p>versus information first?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between object and information</p>
<p>when you get to that low fundamental level?</p>
<p>Well, I might change my view.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m stuff first, the stuff.</p>
<p>And then when stuff becomes objects,</p>
<p>it has to invent information.</p>
<p>And then the information acts on more stuff</p>
<p>and becomes more objects.</p>
<p>So I think there is a transition to information</p>
<p>that occurs when you go from stuff to objects.</p>
<p>You mean time though, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Information is emergent.</p>
<p>Not emergent.</p>
<p>Information is actionable memories from the universe.</p>
<p>So when memories become actionable, that&rsquo;s information.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always memory, but it&rsquo;s not actionable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s not information.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And actionable is what you can create.</p>
<p>You can use it.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t use it, then it&rsquo;s not information.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t transmit it,</p>
<p>if it doesn&rsquo;t have any causal consequence.</p>
<p>Falls in the forest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Why is that not information?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stuff happening, but it&rsquo;s not causal.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we can.</p>
<p>This is cool.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Happening requires information.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Stuff is always happening.</p>
<p>No, this is where the physicists</p>
<p>and the math petitions get themselves in a loop</p>
<p>because I think the universe, I mean,</p>
<p>I think say Max Tegmark is very playful</p>
<p>and say like the universe is just math.</p>
<p>Well, the universe is just math.</p>
<p>Then we might as well not bother having any conversation</p>
<p>because the conversation already written,</p>
<p>we just might as well go to the future and say,</p>
<p>can you just give us the conversations happened already?</p>
<p>So I think the problem is that math petitions</p>
<p>are so successful at labeling stuff</p>
<p>and so successful understanding the stuff</p>
<p>through those labels,</p>
<p>they forget that actually those labels had to emerge</p>
<p>and that information had to be built on those memories.</p>
<p>So memory in the universe, so constraints, graph,</p>
<p>when they become actionable</p>
<p>and the graph can loop back on itself</p>
<p>or interact with other graphs and they can intersect,</p>
<p>those memories become actionable</p>
<p>and therefore they&rsquo;re information.</p>
<p>And I think you just changed my mind</p>
<p>on something pretty big, but I don&rsquo;t have a pen.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t write, I&rsquo;m gonna write it down later,</p>
<p>but roughly the idea is like you&rsquo;ve got these two graphs</p>
<p>of objects of stuff that you have memories</p>
<p>and then when they intersect</p>
<p>and then they can act on each other,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s maybe the mechanism by which information is then,</p>
<p>so then you can then abstract.</p>
<p>So when one graph can then build another graph and say,</p>
<p>hey, you don&rsquo;t have to go through the nonsense</p>
<p>we had to go through.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s literally the way to do it.</p>
<p>Stuff always comes first,</p>
<p>but then when stuff builds the abstraction,</p>
<p>the abstractions can be then teleported</p>
<p>onto other stuff.</p>
<p>And the abstractions is the looping back power.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Am I making, I don&rsquo;t know, I got stuck.</p>
<p>Yeah, so first, God made stuff.</p>
<p>Then after that, when you start to be able</p>
<p>to form abstractions, that&rsquo;s when the information.</p>
<p>God is the memory the universe can remember.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there&rsquo;s no, wait, did you?</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s gonna be deciphering that statement</p>
<p>hundreds of years from now, what the hell does that mean?</p>
<p>What does the humans mean by this?</p>
<p>Look, don&rsquo;t diss my one liners.</p>
<p>I took me 15 seconds to come up with that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it means.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>Okay, wait, we need to, how do we get onto this?</p>
<p>We were time, causality, mathematics.</p>
<p>So what is mathematics in this picture of stuff,</p>
<p>objects, memory, and information?</p>
<p>What exactly is mathematics?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most efficient labeling scheme</p>
<p>that you can apply to lots of different graphs.</p>
<p>Labeling scheme doesn&rsquo;t make it sound useful.</p>
<p>Can I try?</p>
<p>Yep, sure, please.</p>
<p>Have you rejected my definition of mathematics?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m shocked.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>Go on, sorry.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think we have a problem, right?</p>
<p>Cause we can&rsquo;t not be us,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re stuck in the shells we are</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to observe the world.</p>
<p>And so mathematics looks like it has certain properties.</p>
<p>And I guess the thought experiment I find is useful</p>
<p>is to try to imagine if you were outside of us</p>
<p>looking at us as physical systems using mathematics,</p>
<p>what would be the specific features you associate</p>
<p>to the property of understanding mathematics</p>
<p>and being able to implement it in the universe, right?</p>
<p>And when you do that,</p>
<p>mathematics seems to have some really interesting properties</p>
<p>relative to other kinds of abstraction</p>
<p>we might talk about like language or artistic expression.</p>
<p>One of those properties is the one I mentioned already</p>
<p>that is really easy to copy between physical media.</p>
<p>So if I give you a mathematical statement,</p>
<p>you almost immediately know what I mean.</p>
<p>If I tell you the sky is blue,</p>
<p>you might say, is it gold ball blue?</p>
<p>Is it azure blue?</p>
<p>What color blue do you mean?</p>
<p>And you have a harder time visualizing what I actually mean.</p>
<p>So mathematics carries a lot of meaning with it</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s copied between physical systems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the reason we use it to communicate with computers.</p>
<p>And then the second one is it retains its property</p>
<p>of actually what it can do in the universe when it&rsquo;s copied.</p>
<p>So the example I like to give there</p>
<p>is think about like Newton&rsquo;s law of gravitation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s a compressed regularity</p>
<p>of a bunch of phenomena that we observe in the universe,</p>
<p>but then that information actually is causal in a sense</p>
<p>that it allows us to do things we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do</p>
<p>without that particular knowledge</p>
<p>and that particular abstraction.</p>
<p>And in this case, like launch satellites to space</p>
<p>or send people to Mars or whatever it is.</p>
<p>So if you look at us from the outside and you say,</p>
<p>what is it for physical systems</p>
<p>to invent a thing called mathematics</p>
<p>and then to use and then it to become a physical observable,</p>
<p>mathematics is kind of like</p>
<p>the universally copyable information</p>
<p>that allows new possibility spaces</p>
<p>to be open in the future</p>
<p>because it allows this kind of ability</p>
<p>to map one physical system to another</p>
<p>and actually understand that the general principles.</p>
<p>So is it helping the overlap of causal graphs then</p>
<p>by mapping?</p>
<p>Oh, I think that&rsquo;s the explanation for what it is</p>
<p>in terms of the physical theory of assembly</p>
<p>would be some feature of the structure</p>
<p>of the assembly spaces of causal graphs</p>
<p>and their relationship to each other.</p>
<p>So for example, and I mean, this is things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna have to work out over the next few years.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re in totally uncharted conceptual territory</p>
<p>here, but as is usual, diving off the deep end,</p>
<p>but I would expect that we would be able to come up</p>
<p>with a theory of like, why is it that some physical systems</p>
<p>can communicate with each other?</p>
<p>Like language, language is basically</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re objects extended over time</p>
<p>and some of the history of that assembly space</p>
<p>actually overlaps.</p>
<p>And when we communicate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because we actually have shared structure</p>
<p>in our causal history.</p>
<p>Let me have another quick go at this, right?</p>
<p>So I think we all agree.</p>
<p>So I think we take mathematics for granted</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve gone through this chain, right?</p>
<p>Of, you know, we all share a language now, okay?</p>
<p>And we can, well, we share language,</p>
<p>so we have languages that we can make interoperable.</p>
<p>And so whether you&rsquo;re speaking, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>all the different dialects of Chinese,</p>
<p>all the different dialects of English, French, German,</p>
<p>whatever, you can interconvert them.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about mathematics now</p>
<p>is that everybody on planet Earth, every human being</p>
<p>and computers share that common language.</p>
<p>That language was constructed by a process in time.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m trying to say is assembly invented math</p>
<p>is those, right from the, you know,</p>
<p>mathematics didn&rsquo;t occur, it didn&rsquo;t exist before life.</p>
<p>Abstraction was invented by life, right?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the universe wasn&rsquo;t capable</p>
<p>of mathematical things.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, can we just ask that old famous question,</p>
<p>is math invented or discovered?</p>
<p>So when you say assembly invented, or whatever.</p>
<p>It means it&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>Well, someone might just say assembly</p>
<p>is a mathematical theory, but sorry.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Are we arguing? Exactly.</p>
<p>Are we arguing now?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it sounds like.</p>
<p>Are we discovering mathematics?</p>
<p>No, well, yes and no.</p>
<p>I would say.</p>
<p>And you call mathematics a language</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re developing. I would say that,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that there are some very common</p>
<p>seeds of mathematics in the universe, right?</p>
<p>But actually not the mathematics that we are finding now</p>
<p>is not discovered, it&rsquo;s invented.</p>
<p>And, but even though I think those two terms</p>
<p>are very triggering, and I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re necessarily useful,</p>
<p>because I think that what people do,</p>
<p>the mathematicians that say, oh, mathematics was discovered</p>
<p>because they live in a universe where there is no time</p>
<p>and it just all exists.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is, and I think in the same way</p>
<p>you can create, let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m gonna go and create</p>
<p>and make a piece of art, did I make that piece of art</p>
<p>or did I discover it?</p>
<p>Like inventing the aeroplane.</p>
<p>Did I invent the aeroplane?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stick with the aeroplane.</p>
<p>The aeroplane is a good one.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, did I discover the aeroplane?</p>
<p>Well, in a way, the universe discovered the aeroplane</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just chucked a load of atoms together</p>
<p>and a load of random human beings want to do stuff</p>
<p>and then we discover the aeroplane</p>
<p>in the space of all the possibilities.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing, when the space of possibilities</p>
<p>is so vast, infinite almost, and you&rsquo;re able to actualize</p>
<p>one of those in an object, then you are inventing it.</p>
<p>So in mathematics, because there are infinite number</p>
<p>of theorems, the fact you&rsquo;re actually pulling,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no difference between inventing</p>
<p>a mathematical structure and inventing the aeroplane.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the same thing, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>that now the aeroplane exists in the universe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something weird about the universe.</p>
<p>So I think that the more, this is the thing</p>
<p>that you probably, the more memory required</p>
<p>for the object, the more invented it is.</p>
<p>So when a mathematical theorem needs more bytes</p>
<p>to store it, the more invented it is,</p>
<p>and the less bytes, the more discovered it is.</p>
<p>But everything then is invented.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more or less invented.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The universe has to generate everything as it goes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t there in the beginning.</p>
<p>And the way we&rsquo;re thinking it,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking about the difference</p>
<p>between invented and discovered,</p>
<p>is because we&rsquo;re throwing away all the memory.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you start to think in terms of causality and time,</p>
<p>then those things become the same.</p>
<p>Everything is invented.</p>
<p>And the idea is to make everything intrinsic</p>
<p>to the universe.</p>
<p>So I think one of the features of assembly theory</p>
<p>is we don&rsquo;t wanna have external observers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been this long tradition in physics</p>
<p>of trying to describe the universe from the outside</p>
<p>and not the inside.</p>
<p>And the universe has to generate everything itself</p>
<p>if you do it from the inside.</p>
<p>Assembly theory describes how the universe builds itself.</p>
<p>Did it take you 15 seconds to say that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And to come up with that also?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve thought of that before.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re making fun of me.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not making fun, I&rsquo;m having fun.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s inventing fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not all intimidated.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a causal history to that fun.</p>
<p>You mentioned that there&rsquo;s no way to communicate</p>
<p>with aliens until there&rsquo;s overlap in the causal graph.</p>
<p>Communication includes being able to see them.</p>
<p>And like, what are we, this is the question is,</p>
<p>is communication any kind of detection?</p>
<p>And if so, what do aliens look like</p>
<p>as you get more and more overlap on the causal graph?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re assuming, let&rsquo;s assume that aliens,</p>
<p>so when you see them and they see you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re assuming they have vision,</p>
<p>they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of assumptions they&rsquo;re making.</p>
<p>What detection?</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s step back.</p>
<p>So yes, okay, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So when, in the English language,</p>
<p>when we say the word see, we mean visually,</p>
<p>they show up to a party and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, wow, that&rsquo;s an alien.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s visual, that&rsquo;s 3D, that&rsquo;s, okay.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also assuming scale,</p>
<p>spatial scale of something that&rsquo;s visible to you.</p>
<p>So it can&rsquo;t be microscopic or it can&rsquo;t be so big</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t even realize that&rsquo;s an entity.</p>
<p>Okay, but other kinds of detection too.</p>
<p>I would make it more abstract and go down.</p>
<p>I was thinking this morning about how to rewrite</p>
<p>the Arecibo message in assembly theory</p>
<p>and also to abandon binary.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t think aliens necessarily,</p>
<p>why should they have binary?</p>
<p>Well, they have some basic elements</p>
<p>with which to do information exchange.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make it more fundamental, more universal.</p>
<p>So we need to think about what is the universal way</p>
<p>of making a memory and then we should</p>
<p>reencode Arecibo in that way.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more basic than zeros and ones?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s really difficult to get out</p>
<p>that causal chain because we&rsquo;re so,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s erase the idea of zero for a moment.</p>
<p>It took human beings a long time</p>
<p>to come up with the idea of zero.</p>
<p>Now you got the idea of zero, you can&rsquo;t throw it away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so useful.</p>
<p>To discover the idea of zero.</p>
<p>To discover or invent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it took a long time</p>
<p>so it was invented, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think zero was invented, exactly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a given that aliens know what zero is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a massive assumption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a useful discovery.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying if you break the causal chain</p>
<p>there might be some other more efficient way of representing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I wanna meet him and ask him.</p>
<p>For a shortcut.</p>
<p>But you won&rsquo;t be able to ask him until.</p>
<p>So I interrupted you and I think you&rsquo;re making good point.</p>
<p>I was just gonna say, well look.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Rather than saying.</p>
<p>Please internet, tweet at him for the rude interruptions.</p>
<p>Oh, go ahead, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s change.</p>
<p>How do we, so, oh, I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to be an alien.</p>
<p>I would like to know.</p>
<p>What is the full spectrum of what aliens</p>
<p>might look like to us?</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve laid this all on the table of like,</p>
<p>all right, so there has to be some overlap</p>
<p>in this causal chain that led to them.</p>
<p>What are we looking for?</p>
<p>What do you think we should be looking for?</p>
<p>So you mentioned mass spec.</p>
<p>Measuring certain objects that aliens could create</p>
<p>or are aliens themselves.</p>
<p>We show up to a planet or maybe not a planet.</p>
<p>Or maybe, what the hell is the basic object</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to measure the assembly index of?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s cut ourselves a break.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that they are metabolized.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got an energy source.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re a size that we can recognize.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give ourselves a break.</p>
<p>Because there could be aliens that are so big</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t recognize we&rsquo;re seeing them.</p>
<p>There might be aliens that are so small</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t yet have the ability to,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have microscopes that can see far enough away</p>
<p>that just wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see them.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s a good range?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just make a range.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just be very anthropocentric and say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna look for aliens roughly our size</p>
<p>and technology our size.</p>
<p>Because we know it&rsquo;s possible on Earth, right?</p>
<p>I mean, a reasonable thing to do would be</p>
<p>to find exoplanets that are in the same zone as Earth</p>
<p>in terms of heat and stuff.</p>
<p>And then say, hey, if there&rsquo;s that same kind of gravity,</p>
<p>same kind of stuff, we could reasonably assume</p>
<p>that alien life there might use a similar kind</p>
<p>of physical infrastructure.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>So then your question becomes really relevant.</p>
<p>Say, right, let&rsquo;s use vision, sound, touch.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>So okay, that&rsquo;s really nice.</p>
<p>So that if there&rsquo;s a lot of aliens out there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good likelihood if you match to the planet</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to be in the same spatial</p>
<p>and temporal, operating in the same spatial</p>
<p>and temporal domain as humans.</p>
<p>Okay, within that, what do they look like visually?</p>
<p>What do they sound like?</p>
<p>What do they, oh god, this sounds creepy.</p>
<p>Tastes like, what do they, oh, smell like, smell like.</p>
<p>That sounds like our clubhouse.</p>
<p>We was like, can we have sex with aliens?</p>
<p>Which was basically me saying.</p>
<p>Passionate, passionate love.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t actually about sex.</p>
<p>It was about, is our chemistry compatible, right?</p>
<p>Is there some?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, can we, yeah.</p>
<p>Are they edible too?</p>
<p>They could be very edible.</p>
<p>They could be delicious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I want to see some aliens, right?</p>
<p>Because I think, are there, I think evolution,</p>
<p>I mean, evolution exploits symmetry, right?</p>
<p>Because why generate memory?</p>
<p>Why generate storage, the need for storage space</p>
<p>when you can use symmetry?</p>
<p>So, and symmetry is quite, may be quite effective</p>
<p>in allowing you to mechanically design stuff, right?</p>
<p>So maybe alien, you could be reasonable to assume</p>
<p>that aliens could have, they could be bipedal.</p>
<p>They could be symmetric in the same way.</p>
<p>Might have a couple of eyes or a couple of senses.</p>
<p>We can make them, perhaps there&rsquo;s this whole zoo</p>
<p>of different aliens out there.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll never get to be able to classify</p>
<p>some of the weird aliens we can&rsquo;t interact with</p>
<p>because they have made such weird stuff.</p>
<p>But we are just going to look at,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to find aliens that look most like us.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Because those are the first ones we&rsquo;re likely to see.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s really hard to imagine</p>
<p>what the space of aliens is because the space is huge.</p>
<p>Because, you know, like one of the arguments</p>
<p>that you can make about why life emerges in chemistry</p>
<p>is because chemistry is the first scale</p>
<p>in terms of like, you know,</p>
<p>building up objects from elementary objects.</p>
<p>That the number of possible things that could exist</p>
<p>is larger than the universe can possibly make all at once.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So imagine you have two planets</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re cooking some geochemistry.</p>
<p>You know, our planet invented one kind of biochemistry.</p>
<p>And presumably as you start building up</p>
<p>the complexity of the molecules,</p>
<p>the chances of the overlap in those trajectories,</p>
<p>those causal chains being built up is probably very low.</p>
<p>And it gets lower and lower as it gets further advanced</p>
<p>along its evolutionary path.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to imagine</p>
<p>predicting the technologies that aliens are gonna have.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so, you&rsquo;re looking at basically</p>
<p>planets have kind of convergent chemistry,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some variability.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re looking basically at the outgrowth</p>
<p>into the possibility space for chemistry.</p>
<p>So do you think we would detect the technology,</p>
<p>the objects created by aliens before we detect the aliens?</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re talking about measuring assembly index,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think we would detect the garbage first?</p>
<p>Like at the outskirts of alien civilizations,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t this just gonna be trash?</p>
<p>I think I would come back to Arecibo.</p>
<p>The Arecibo message sent from the Arecibo telescope</p>
<p>built by Drake, I think, and Sagan.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s Arecibo spelled?</p>
<p>A R E C I B O.</p>
<p>Yes, thank you.</p>
<p>And there we go, they&rsquo;ve got that up there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the telescope that sent the message</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So that message was sent where?</p>
<p>It was beamed at a star, a specific star,</p>
<p>and it was sent out many years ago.</p>
<p>And what they did, so this is why I was pushing on binary,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a binary message.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a semi prime length number of characters.</p>
<p>So I think 73 by 23, I think.</p>
<p>And it basically represents human bit proton,</p>
<p>binary, human beings, DNA, male and female.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just wondering if it could be done</p>
<p>not making any,</p>
<p>cause it made assumptions that aliens speak binary.</p>
<p>Why make that assumption?</p>
<p>Why not just assume that if the difference between physics,</p>
<p>chemistry and biology is the amount of memory</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s instead that&rsquo;s recordable by the substrates,</p>
<p>then surely the universal thing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make some sacrilegious statement,</p>
<p>which I think is pretty awesome for people to argue with.</p>
<p>So this is, we&rsquo;re looking at an image</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s the entirety of the message encoded in binary.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a probably interpretation</p>
<p>of different parts of that image.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a person, there&rsquo;s green parts.</p>
<p>It looks like for people just listening,</p>
<p>like a game of Tetris.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s encoding in minimal ways,</p>
<p>a bunch of cool information, probably.</p>
<p>Representing all of us.</p>
<p>So the topic&rsquo;s kind of teaching us how to count</p>
<p>and then it all goes all the way down</p>
<p>teaching you chemistry and then just says,</p>
<p>but it makes so many assumptions.</p>
<p>And I think if we can actually,</p>
<p>so look, I think, I mean, Sarah&rsquo;s much more eloquent</p>
<p>in expressing this, but I&rsquo;ll have a go</p>
<p>and you can correct it if you want,</p>
<p>which is like one of the things that Sarah has had</p>
<p>a profound effect on the way I look at the origin of life.</p>
<p>And this is one of the reasons why we&rsquo;re working together</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t really care about the origin of life.</p>
<p>We wanna make life, make aliens and find aliens.</p>
<p>Make aliens, find aliens.</p>
<p>I think we might have to make aliens in the lab</p>
<p>before we find aliens in the universe, right?</p>
<p>I think that would be a cool way to do it.</p>
<p>So what is it about the universe that creates aliens?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s selection through assembly theory,</p>
<p>creating memories, because when you create memories,</p>
<p>you can then command your domain.</p>
<p>You can basically do stuff.</p>
<p>You can command matter.</p>
<p>So we need to find a way by understanding what life is</p>
<p>of how the minimal way to command matter,</p>
<p>how that would emerge in the universe.</p>
<p>And if we want to communicate,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to necessarily uniformly communicate.</p>
<p>What I would do perhaps if I had,</p>
<p>is I would send out lots of probes away from Earth</p>
<p>that have this magic way of communicating with aliens,</p>
<p>get them quite a far away from Earth, plausibly deniable,</p>
<p>and then send out the message</p>
<p>that would then attract all the aliens,</p>
<p>and then basically work out if they were friend or foe</p>
<p>and how they wanna hang out.</p>
<p>The messages being something has to do with the memories.</p>
<p>Yes, like the assembly version of Arecibo,</p>
<p>so that everyone in the universe</p>
<p>that has been understands what life is.</p>
<p>So aliens need to work out what they are.</p>
<p>Once they&rsquo;ve worked out what they are,</p>
<p>they then can work out how to encode what they are,</p>
<p>and then they can go out and send messages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the universal, the Rosetta Stone</p>
<p>for life in the universe is working out</p>
<p>how the memories are built.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Sarah, you have any, well,</p>
<p>whether you would agree with that.</p>
<p>No, I wanted to raise a different point,</p>
<p>which is about the fact that we can&rsquo;t see the aliens yet</p>
<p>because we haven&rsquo;t gotten the technology.</p>
<p>And presumably we think assembly theory</p>
<p>is the right way of doing it,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that we know how to go</p>
<p>from the kind of data you&rsquo;re describing, Lex,</p>
<p>like visual data or smell</p>
<p>to construct the assembly spaces yet.</p>
<p>And in some ways, I think that the problem</p>
<p>of life detection really is the same problem</p>
<p>at the foundations of AI that we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>how to get machines to see causal graphs,</p>
<p>to see reality in terms of causation.</p>
<p>And so I think assembly and AI</p>
<p>are gonna intersect in interesting ways, hopefully,</p>
<p>but the sort of key point,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been trying to make this argument more recently,</p>
<p>I might write an essay on it,</p>
<p>is people talk about the great filter, right?</p>
<p>And which is, again, this doomsday thing</p>
<p>that people wanna say there&rsquo;s no aliens out there</p>
<p>because something terrible happened to them.</p>
<p>And it matters whether that&rsquo;s in our past or our future</p>
<p>as to the longevity of our species, presumably,</p>
<p>which is why people find it interesting.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s not a physical filter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like things go extinct.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s literally,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the technology to see them.</p>
<p>And you could see that with microscopes.</p>
<p>I mean, we didn&rsquo;t know there were microbes on this table</p>
<p>or tables for thousands of years or telescopes.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so much of the universe we can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>And then basically what we have done as a species</p>
<p>is outsource our physical perceptions to technology,</p>
<p>building microscopes based on our eyes,</p>
<p>and building seismometers based on our sense of feelings,</p>
<p>like feel earthquakes and things.</p>
<p>And AI is basically we&rsquo;re trying to outsource</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s actually happening in our thinking apparatus</p>
<p>into machines now and to technological devices.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s the key technology</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna allow us to see things like us</p>
<p>and see the universe in a totally different way.</p>
<p>But you kind of mentioned the great filter.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a way through technology</p>
<p>to stop being able to see stuff?</p>
<p>So can you take a step backwards?</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>Did you imply that with the great, so like?</p>
<p>Well, no, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a great perceptual filter</p>
<p>in the sense that a example of life evolving on a planet</p>
<p>over billions of years has to acquire</p>
<p>a certain amount of knowledge and technology</p>
<p>to actually recognize the phenomena that it is.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the sense I have is,</p>
<p>I mean, you talk with physicists, engineers in general,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this kind of idea that we have</p>
<p>most of the tools already to hear the signal.</p>
<p>But to me, it feels like we don&rsquo;t have any of the tools</p>
<p>to see the signal.</p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing, yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest, like to hear.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the tools to really hear, to see.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Aliens are everywhere.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t have the, yeah, well, oh, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I mean, I got this in part, actually,</p>
<p>because you were like, you know,</p>
<p>last time I was here, he was like, look at the carpet.</p>
<p>You know, if you had an alien detector</p>
<p>where the carpet be aliens.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think it would be.</p>
<p>But the aliens would nevertheless have a high assembly index</p>
<p>or produce things of high assembly index.</p>
<p>And those things of high assembly index,</p>
<p>you have to have a detector that can recognize</p>
<p>high assembly index in all its forms.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Take data, construct assembly space.</p>
<p>Yeah. Those patterns, basically.</p>
<p>So one way to think about high assembly index</p>
<p>is interesting patterns of basic ingredients.</p>
<p>I can give you an example,</p>
<p>because I mean, in molecules,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about in objects,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also trying to do it in spatial trajectories.</p>
<p>Like, imagine you&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>like, I always get bothered by the fact that, like,</p>
<p>when you look at birds flocking,</p>
<p>you can describe that with like a simple Boyd&rsquo;s model,</p>
<p>or like, you know, people use spin glass</p>
<p>to describe animal behavior.</p>
<p>And those are like really simple physics models.</p>
<p>Yet you&rsquo;re looking at a system that you know has agency</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s intelligence in those birds.</p>
<p>And basically, like, you can&rsquo;t help but think</p>
<p>there must be some statistical signatures</p>
<p>of the fact that they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a group of agents versus, you know, like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you know, the physics example,</p>
<p>maybe like, I don&rsquo;t know, Brownian motion or something.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is actually apply assembly to trajectory data</p>
<p>to try to say there&rsquo;s a minimal amount of causal history</p>
<p>to build up certain trajectories for observed agents</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like an agency detector for behavior.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to do some like Boyd&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or those kinds of things, like artificial,</p>
<p>like cellular automata, play with those ideas</p>
<p>with assembly, with assembly theory?</p>
<p>Have you found any useful, really simple mathematical,</p>
<p>like, simulation tools that allow you</p>
<p>to play with these concepts?</p>
<p>So like one, of course, you&rsquo;re doing mass spec</p>
<p>in this physical space with chemistry,</p>
<p>but it just seems, well, I mean,</p>
<p>computer science person, maybe,</p>
<p>it seems easier to just.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>It seems even sexier in terms of tweeting visual information</p>
<p>on Twitter or Instagram, more importantly,</p>
<p>to play like, here&rsquo;s an organism of a low assembly index</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s an organism of a high assembly index</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s watch them create more and more memories</p>
<p>and more and more complex objects.</p>
<p>And so like, in mathematics,</p>
<p>you get to observe what that looks like</p>
<p>to build up an intuition what assembly index is like.</p>
<p>We are building a toolkit right now.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a really good idea,</p>
<p>but what we&rsquo;ve got to do is I&rsquo;m kind of still obsessed</p>
<p>with the infrastructure required.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons why I was pushing on information</p>
<p>and mathematics when human beings,</p>
<p>when human beings, we take a lot of the infrastructure</p>
<p>for granted.</p>
<p>And I think we have to strip that back a bit</p>
<p>for going forward, but you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I would agree that I think the fact that we exist</p>
<p>in the universe, this is like,</p>
<p>I can see that lots of people would disagree</p>
<p>with the statement, but I don&rsquo;t think Sarah will,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The fact that objects exist,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone on earth will disagree</p>
<p>that objects can exist elsewhere, right?</p>
<p>But they will disagree that life can exist elsewhere.</p>
<p>But what perhaps I&rsquo;m trying to say is that</p>
<p>the acquisition, the universe&rsquo;s ability to acquire memory</p>
<p>is the very first step for building life.</p>
<p>And that must be, that&rsquo;s so easy to happen.</p>
<p>So therefore alien life is everywhere</p>
<p>because all alien life is,</p>
<p>is those memories being compressed and minimalized</p>
<p>and the alien equivalent of the cell working.</p>
<p>So I think that we will build new technologies</p>
<p>to find aliens, but we need to understand what we are first</p>
<p>and how we go from physics to chemistry to biology.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re saying to these two organisms,</p>
<p>different assemblies, there&rsquo;s one you get into biology.</p>
<p>Biology gets more and more weird,</p>
<p>more and more contingent.</p>
<p>Physics is, chemistry is less weird</p>
<p>cause the rules of chemistry are smaller</p>
<p>than the rules of biology.</p>
<p>And then going away to physics where you have a very</p>
<p>nicely tangible number of ways of arranging things.</p>
<p>And I think assembly theory just helps you appreciate that.</p>
<p>And so once we get there,</p>
<p>my dream is that we are just gonna be able to suddenly,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m maybe just being really arrogant here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be arrogant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;ve got this hammer called assembly</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s a nail.</p>
<p>But I think that once we crack it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be able to use assembly theory plus telescopes</p>
<p>to find aliens.</p>
<p>Do you have, Sarah, do you have disagreements with Lee</p>
<p>on the number of aliens that are out there?</p>
<p>I do actually, yeah, well.</p>
<p>And what they look like.</p>
<p>So any of the things we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>is there nuanced, it&rsquo;s always nice to discover wisdom</p>
<p>through nuanced disagreement.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t wholly disagree, but I think,</p>
<p>but I do think I disagree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, there&rsquo;s nuance there.</p>
<p>But Lee made it.</p>
<p>You can disagree.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>It is nuanced, right?</p>
<p>So you made the point earlier that you think,</p>
<p>once we discover what life is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see alien life everywhere.</p>
<p>And I think I agree on some levels in the sense</p>
<p>that I think the physics that governs us is universal.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know how far I would go to say,</p>
<p>to say that we&rsquo;re a likely phenomenon</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t understand all of the features</p>
<p>of the transition at the origin of life,</p>
<p>which we would just say in assembly,</p>
<p>as you go from the no memory physics</p>
<p>to there&rsquo;s like a critical transition</p>
<p>around the assembly index</p>
<p>where assembliness starts to increase.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we call the evolution of the biosphere</p>
<p>and complexification of the biosphere.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a principle of increasing assembliness</p>
<p>where that goes back to what I was saying</p>
<p>at the very beginning about the physics of the possible,</p>
<p>that the universe basically gets in this mode</p>
<p>of trying to make as much possibilities as possible.</p>
<p>Now, how often that transition happens</p>
<p>that you get the kind of cascading effect</p>
<p>that we get in our biosphere, I think we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If we did, we would know the likelihood of life</p>
<p>in the universe.</p>
<p>And a lot of people wanna say life is common,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that we can say that yet</p>
<p>till we have the empirical data,</p>
<p>which I think you would agree with.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s this other kind of thought experiment I have</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t like, but I did have it,</p>
<p>which is if life emerges on one planet</p>
<p>and you get this real high density of things</p>
<p>that can exist on that planet,</p>
<p>is it sort of dominating the density of creation</p>
<p>that the universe can actually generate?</p>
<p>So like if you&rsquo;re thinking about counting entropy, right?</p>
<p>Like the universe has a certain amount of stuff in it.</p>
<p>And then assembly is kind of like an entropic principle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not entropy.</p>
<p>But the idea is that now transformations among stuff</p>
<p>or the actual physical histories of things</p>
<p>now become things that you have to count</p>
<p>as far as saying that these things exist</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re increasing the number of things that exist.</p>
<p>And if you think about that cosmologically,</p>
<p>maybe Earth is sucking up all the life potential</p>
<p>of the whole universe, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that, can you expand that a little bit?</p>
<p>Why can any one geographical region</p>
<p>suck up the creative capacity of the universe?</p>
<p>Just like, I know it&rsquo;s a ridiculous thought.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually agree with it,</p>
<p>but it was just a thought experiment.</p>
<p>I love that you can have thoughts</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t like and don&rsquo;t agree with,</p>
<p>but you have to think through them anyway.</p>
<p>The human mind is fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think these sort of counterfactual</p>
<p>thought experiments are really good</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to build new theories</p>
<p>because you have to think through all the consequences.</p>
<p>And there are people that want to try to account for,</p>
<p>say, the degrees of freedom on our planet</p>
<p>in cosmological inventories of talking about</p>
<p>the entropy of the universe.</p>
<p>And when we&rsquo;re thinking about cosmological</p>
<p>arrow of time and things like that.</p>
<p>Now, I think those are pretty superficial proposals</p>
<p>as they stand now, but assembly would give you</p>
<p>a way of counting it.</p>
<p>And then the question is if there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>maximal capacity of the universe&rsquo;s speed</p>
<p>of generating stuff, which Lee always has this argument</p>
<p>that assembly is about time.</p>
<p>The universe is generating more states.</p>
<p>Really what it&rsquo;s generating is more assembly possibilities.</p>
<p>And then dark energy might be one manifestation of that,</p>
<p>that the universe is accelerating its expansion</p>
<p>because that makes more physical space.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s happening on our planet is it&rsquo;s accelerating</p>
<p>in the expansion of possible things that exist.</p>
<p>And maybe the universe just has a maximal rate</p>
<p>of what it can do to generate things.</p>
<p>And then if there is a maximal rate,</p>
<p>maybe only a certain number of planets</p>
<p>can actually do that.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s a trade off about the pace of growth</p>
<p>on certain planets versus others.</p>
<p>I have a million questions there,</p>
<p>but do you have thoughts on?</p>
<p>Just a quick, yeah, I&rsquo;ll just say something very quick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thought experiment.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s good, I think I get it.</p>
<p>I think I get it.</p>
<p>So what I want to say is when I mean aliens are everywhere,</p>
<p>I mean memories are the prerequisite</p>
<p>for aliens via selection</p>
<p>and then concentration of selection</p>
<p>when selection becomes autonomous.</p>
<p>So what I would love to do is to build,</p>
<p>say a magical telescope that was a memory,</p>
<p>a magical one, or a real one,</p>
<p>that would be a memory detector to see selection.</p>
<p>So you could get to exoplanets and say that exoplanet</p>
<p>looks like there&rsquo;s lots of selection going on there.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s evolution and maybe there&rsquo;s going to be life.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m trying to say is narrow down</p>
<p>the regions of space where you say</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely evidence of memory as high assembly there</p>
<p>or not high assembly, because that would be life,</p>
<p>but where it&rsquo;s capable of happening.</p>
<p>And then that would also help us frame the search for aliens.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how likely it is to make the transition</p>
<p>to cells and all the other things.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But I think that we just need to get more data.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t like the thought experiment</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like the idea</p>
<p>that if the universe has a maximal limit</p>
<p>on the amount it can generate per unit time</p>
<p>that our existence is actually precluding the existence</p>
<p>of other things.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll just say one thing.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s probably true anyway</p>
<p>because of the resource limitations.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like your thought experiment</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, I do like the thought experiment.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re trying to say is like,</p>
<p>there is a chain of events that goes back</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s manifestly culminated with life on Earth.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not saying that life isn&rsquo;t possible elsewhere.</p>
<p>You say that there has been these number of things,</p>
<p>contingent things that have happened</p>
<p>that have allowed life to merge here.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that life can&rsquo;t emerge elsewhere,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying that the intersection of events</p>
<p>may be concentrated here, right?</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Not exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like if you look at,</p>
<p>say the causal graphs are fundamental,</p>
<p>maybe space is an emergent property,</p>
<p>which is consistent with some proposals on quantum gravity,</p>
<p>but also how we talk about things in assembly theory.</p>
<p>Then the universe is causal graphs generating</p>
<p>more structure in causal graphs, right?</p>
<p>So this is how the universe is unfolding.</p>
<p>And maybe there&rsquo;s a cap on the rate of generation.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s only so much stuff</p>
<p>that gets made per update of the universe.</p>
<p>And then if there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff being made</p>
<p>in a particular region that happens</p>
<p>to look the same locally, spatially,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an after effect of the fact</p>
<p>that the whole causal graph is updating.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>I think that that doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it works either,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have a good argument in my mind about.</p>
<p>But I do like the idea of the capacity that universe,</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ve got the number of states.</p>
<p>Yeah, we can come back to it.</p>
<p>Let me ask real quick.</p>
<p>Like why does different like local pockets</p>
<p>of the universe start remembering stuff?</p>
<p>How does memory emerge exactly?</p>
<p>So at the origin of the universe, it was very forgetful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the physicists were happiest.</p>
<p>It was low memory objects,</p>
<p>which is like ultra low memory objects,</p>
<p>which is what the definition of stuff.</p>
<p>Okay, so how does memory emerge?</p>
<p>How does the temporal stickiness of objects emerge?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take a very chemocentric point of view</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t imagine any other way of doing it.</p>
<p>You could think of other ways maybe.</p>
<p>But I would say heterogeneity in matter</p>
<p>is where the memory&hellip;</p>
<p>So you must have enough different ways</p>
<p>of rearranging matter for there to be a memory.</p>
<p>So what that means,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got particles colliding in a box,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just take some elements in a box.</p>
<p>Those elements can combine in a combinatorial set of ways.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a combinatorial explosion</p>
<p>of the number of molecules or minerals or solid objects,</p>
<p>bonds being made.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s such a large number,</p>
<p>the population of different objects that are possible,</p>
<p>this goes back to assembly theory</p>
<p>where assembly theory, there&rsquo;s four types of universes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got basically, and this is what one was up earlier</p>
<p>where one universe where you&rsquo;ve just got</p>
<p>everything is possible.</p>
<p>So you can take all the atoms</p>
<p>and combine them and make everything.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got basically what is the assembly combinatorial</p>
<p>where you basically have to accrue information in steps.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got assembly observed,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve got the object assembly going back.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m trying to say is like,</p>
<p>if you can take atoms and make bonds,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you take a nitrogen atom and add it</p>
<p>to a carbon atom, you find an amino acid,</p>
<p>then you add another carbon atom on</p>
<p>in a particular configuration,</p>
<p>then another one, all different molecules.</p>
<p>They all represent different histories.</p>
<p>So I would say for me right now,</p>
<p>the most simple route into life seems to be</p>
<p>through recording memories and chemistry.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean there can&rsquo;t be other ways</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t be other emergent effects.</p>
<p>But I think if you can make bonds</p>
<p>and lots of different bonds,</p>
<p>and those molecules can have a causal effect on the future.</p>
<p>So imagine a box of atoms,</p>
<p>and then you combine those atoms in some way.</p>
<p>So you make molecule A from load of atoms,</p>
<p>and then molecule A can go back to the box</p>
<p>and influence the box.</p>
<p>Then you make A prime or AB or ABC.</p>
<p>And that process keeps going,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where the memories come from,</p>
<p>is that heterogeneity in the universe from bonding.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s beginning to flourish at the chemistry level.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the physicists have no, like not enough.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like desperately begging</p>
<p>for more freedom and heterogeneous components to play with.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>What do you think about that, Sarah?</p>
<p>I mentioned already, I think it&rsquo;s significant</p>
<p>that whatever physics governs life</p>
<p>emerges actually in chemistry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not relevant at the subatomic scale</p>
<p>or even at the atomic scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in, well, atomic scale because chemistry.</p>
<p>But like when you get into this combinatorial diversity</p>
<p>that you get from combining things on the periodic table,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when selection actually matters</p>
<p>or the fact that some things can exist</p>
<p>and others can&rsquo;t exist actually starts to matter.</p>
<p>So I think of it like you don&rsquo;t study gravity</p>
<p>inside the atomic nucleus.</p>
<p>You study it in terms of large scale structure</p>
<p>of the universe or black holes or things like that.</p>
<p>And whatever we&rsquo;re talking about as physics of information</p>
<p>or physics of assembly becomes relevant</p>
<p>at a certain scale of reality.</p>
<p>And the transition that you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>I would think of as just when you get a sufficient density</p>
<p>in terms of the assembly space</p>
<p>of like the relationship of the overlap</p>
<p>and the assembly space,</p>
<p>which is like a feature of common memory,</p>
<p>there is this transition to assembly dominated physics,</p>
<p>whatever that is.</p>
<p>Oh, like when we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to map out exactly</p>
<p>what that transition looks like.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty sure of some of its features,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t done all of the&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you think if you were there in the early universe,</p>
<p>you would have been able to predict</p>
<p>the emergence of chemistry and biology?</p>
<p>And I ask that because at this stage as humans,</p>
<p>do you think we can possibly predict the length of memory</p>
<p>that might be able to be formed later on</p>
<p>in this pocket of the universe?</p>
<p>Like how complex is, what is the ceiling of assembly?</p>
<p>I think as much time as you have in the past</p>
<p>is how much you can predict in the future.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s actually physical in the system</p>
<p>and you have to have enough time</p>
<p>for features of that structure to exist.</p>
<p>Wait, let me push back on that.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there somewhere in the universe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a shortest path that&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>that stretches all the way to the beginning?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s building some giant monster?</p>
<p>Maybe, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t predict.</p>
<p>The universe has as much memory</p>
<p>as the largest assembly object in the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right.</p>
<p>But so you can&rsquo;t predict.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t predict any deeper than that, no.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So like that, I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>like what intuition do you have about complexity</p>
<p>living in the world that you&rsquo;d have today?</p>
<p>Right, because you just, you can,</p>
<p>I mean I guess how long does it get more fun?</p>
<p>Like isn&rsquo;t there gonna be at some point,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a heat death in the universe,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there going to be a point of the most,</p>
<p>of the highest assembly of object,</p>
<p>with the highest probability being generated?</p>
<p>When is the universe gonna be the most fun,</p>
<p>and can we freeze ourselves and then live then?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And will you know when you&rsquo;re having the most fun</p>
<p>that this is the best time, you&rsquo;re in your prime?</p>
<p>Are you going to do what everyone does,</p>
<p>which is deny that you&rsquo;re in your prime,</p>
<p>and the best years are still ahead of you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What option do you have?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I mean the problem is there&rsquo;s lots of,</p>
<p>lots of really interesting features here.</p>
<p>I just wanna mention one thing that might be,</p>
<p>is I do think assembly theory applies all the way back</p>
<p>to subatomic particles.</p>
<p>And I also think that cosmological selection</p>
<p>might&rsquo;ve been actually, there might&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s a really boring bit,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really important for a cosmologist</p>
<p>that universes have gone through.</p>
<p>Was it Lee Smolin who proposed this?</p>
<p>Maybe that there is this,</p>
<p>that basically a universe evolves,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the wrong constants, we&rsquo;ll start again.</p>
<p>And the most productive constants</p>
<p>where you can allow particles to form in a certain way,</p>
<p>propagate to the next universe, and we go again.</p>
<p>So actually selection goes all the way back,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this cycle of universes.</p>
<p>And now this universe has been selected</p>
<p>because life can occur, and it carries on.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve really butchered that.</p>
<p>There is a much more.</p>
<p>So this is some aspect where through the selection process</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s parameters that are being fine tuned,</p>
<p>and we happen to be living in one</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s some level of fine tuning.</p>
<p>Is there, given that, can you steel man the case</p>
<p>that we humans are alone in the universe?</p>
<p>We are the highest assembly index object in the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can, I guess.</p>
<p>Sad though.</p>
<p>I mean, so from a.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume.</p>
<p>Well, we know.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So let me, so okay, so there is a particular</p>
<p>set of elements on Earth in a particular ratio,</p>
<p>and the right gravitational constant,</p>
<p>and the right viscosity, you know,</p>
<p>of stuff being able to move around,</p>
<p>the right distance from our sun,</p>
<p>right number of events where we have a moon,</p>
<p>the Earth is rotating.</p>
<p>The late heavy bombardment produced a lot of,</p>
<p>brought in the right stuff.</p>
<p>And Mars was cooking up, you know,</p>
<p>the right molecules first.</p>
<p>So it was habitable before Earth.</p>
<p>It was actually doing the combinatorial search.</p>
<p>And before Mars kind of became uninhabitable,</p>
<p>it seeded Earth with the right molecular replicators.</p>
<p>And there was just the right stuff on Earth,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how the miracle of life occurred.</p>
<p>Although I find I&rsquo;m very uncomfortable with that</p>
<p>because actually, because life came so quickly</p>
<p>in the Earth&rsquo;s past.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that life is easy elsewhere.</p>
<p>It just might mean that,</p>
<p>because chemistry is actually not a long term thing.</p>
<p>Chemistry can happen quickly.</p>
<p>So maybe going on with the steel manning of the argument</p>
<p>to say actually, the fact that life emerged quickly</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that life is easy.</p>
<p>It just means that the chemistry was right on Earth,</p>
<p>and Earth is very special.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s no life</p>
<p>anywhere else in the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Sarah mentioned this kind of cascading thing.</p>
<p>So what if that&rsquo;s the reason we&rsquo;re lucky,</p>
<p>is that we got to have a rare cascading of,</p>
<p>like an accelerating cascading effect</p>
<p>in terms of the complexity of things.</p>
<p>So like, maybe most of the universe</p>
<p>is trying to get sticky with the memory,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not able to really form it.</p>
<p>And then we got really lucky in that.</p>
<p>And it has nothing,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a lot of Earth like conditions, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just you really, really have to get lucky on this.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m doing experiments right now.</p>
<p>In fact, experiments that Sarah and I are working on,</p>
<p>because we have some joint funding for this,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re seeing that the universe</p>
<p>can get sticky really quickly.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we&rsquo;re being very anthropocentric,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re using laboratory tools, we&rsquo;re using theory,</p>
<p>but actually, the phenomena of selection,</p>
<p>the process of developing heterogeneity,</p>
<p>we can do in the lab.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just seeing the very first hints of it.</p>
<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if we can start to pin down</p>
<p>a bit more precisely becoming good Bayesianists for this,</p>
<p>for the origin of life and the emergence of life,</p>
<p>to finding out what kind of chemistries</p>
<p>we really need to look for.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m becoming increasingly confident</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be able to do that in the next few years.</p>
<p>Make life in the lab or make some selection in the lab</p>
<p>from inorganic stuff, from sand, from rocks,</p>
<p>from dead stuff, from moon.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to get stuff from the moon,</p>
<p>put it in our origin of life experiment,</p>
<p>and make moon life?</p>
<p>And restrict ourselves to interesting self replicating</p>
<p>stuff that we find on the moon.</p>
<p>Sarah, what do you think about this approach</p>
<p>of engineering life in order to understand life?</p>
<p>So building life in the machine.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I mean, Lee and I are trying right now</p>
<p>to build a vision for a large institute</p>
<p>or experimental program, basically, to do this problem.</p>
<p>But I think of it as like, we need to simulate a planet.</p>
<p>So like the Large Hadron Collider was supposed</p>
<p>to be simulating conditions just after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s built a lot of technology in his lab</p>
<p>to do these kind of selection engines.</p>
<p>But the question you&rsquo;re asking is,</p>
<p>how many experiments do you need to run?</p>
<p>What volume of chemical space do you need to explore</p>
<p>before you actually see an event?</p>
<p>And I like to make an analogy</p>
<p>to one of my favorite particle physics experiments,</p>
<p>which is Super Kamiakande that&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>for the decay of the proton.</p>
<p>So this is something that we predicted theoretically,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve never observed in our universe.</p>
<p>And basically what they&rsquo;re doing is every time</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t see a proton decay event,</p>
<p>they have a longer bound on the lifetime of a proton.</p>
<p>So imagine we built an experiment with the idea in mind</p>
<p>of trying to simulate planetary conditions,</p>
<p>physically simulate.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t simulate origin life in a computer.</p>
<p>You have to do it in an experiment.</p>
<p>Simulate enough planetary conditions</p>
<p>to explore the space of what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>and bound the probability for an origin life event.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not observing it,</p>
<p>you can talk about the probability.</p>
<p>But we, hopefully, life is not exponentially rare</p>
<p>and we would then be able to evolve</p>
<p>in an automated system alien life in the lab.</p>
<p>And if we can do that, then we understand the physics</p>
<p>as well as we understand what we can do</p>
<p>in particle accelerators.</p>
<p>So keep expanding physically the simulation,</p>
<p>the physical simulation, until something happens.</p>
<p>Yeah, or just build a big enough volume</p>
<p>of chemical experiments and evolve them.</p>
<p>So if you say volume, you mean like literally volume?</p>
<p>I mean physical volume in terms of space,</p>
<p>but I actually mean volume in terms</p>
<p>of the combinatorial space of chemistry.</p>
<p>So like.</p>
<p>How do you nicely control the combinatorial exploration,</p>
<p>the search space, such that it&rsquo;s always like</p>
<p>you keep grabbing the low hanging fruit?</p>
<p>Yeah, how do you build a search engine for chemistry?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like for aliens. I think you explained it really well.</p>
<p>We should carry on doing this.</p>
<p>I should pretend the physics, be the physicist,</p>
<p>you be the chemist.</p>
<p>So the way to do it is I will always play a joke.</p>
<p>Cause I like writing grants to ask for money</p>
<p>to do cool stuff.</p>
<p>But years ago I started wanting to build.</p>
<p>So I actually wanted the weather.</p>
<p>So I built this robot in my lab called the computer,</p>
<p>which is this robot you can program to do chemistry.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a pro.</p>
<p>I made a programming language for the computer</p>
<p>and made it operate chemical equipment.</p>
<p>Originally I wrote grants to say,</p>
<p>Hey, I want to make an origin of life system.</p>
<p>And no one would give me any money for this.</p>
<p>They said, what this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Why are you wanting to make, oh, it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>It takes forever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a very good origin of life chemist anyway.</p>
<p>Why would we give you any money?</p>
<p>And so I turned it around and said, can you,</p>
<p>can instead, can you give me money to make robots,</p>
<p>to make molecules are interesting.</p>
<p>And everyone went, yeah, okay, you can do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, so actually the funny thing is the computer</p>
<p>project, which I have in my lab, which is very briefly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just basically, it&rsquo;s like literally an automated</p>
<p>test tube.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve made a programming language for the test tube,</p>
<p>which is cool, has come as literally came from this.</p>
<p>I went to my lab one day.</p>
<p>So I want to make a search engine to get origin of life</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have a planet.</p>
<p>And I thought about doing in a microfluidic format.</p>
<p>So microfluidic is very nano, very small channels</p>
<p>in device where you can basically have all the pipes</p>
<p>lit dump produced by lithography.</p>
<p>And you can have a chamber, maybe say between say 10</p>
<p>and a hundred microns in volume.</p>
<p>And we slot them all together like Lego,</p>
<p>and we can make an origin of life system.</p>
<p>And I could never get it to work.</p>
<p>And I realized I had to make, do chemistry at the kind of</p>
<p>test tube level and what you want to be able to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, it goes back to that tweet in 1981.</p>
<p>1981, the computer, we&rsquo;re looking at a tweet from Lee.</p>
<p>In 1981, the computer was a distant dream in,</p>
<p>oh wow, this is the scientist looking back.</p>
<p>It is the young boy who dreamed.</p>
<p>In 2018, it was realized, spelled in a British way,</p>
<p>realized, which is the wrong way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m starting with Z, but not.</p>
<p>So now there&rsquo;s a system that does the physical</p>
<p>manifestation or whatever the programming language,</p>
<p>the spec tells you to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, well in 1981, I got my first computer, ZX81.</p>
<p>What was the computer?</p>
<p>ZX81.</p>
<p>Sinclair ZX81.</p>
<p>It was, and I got a chemistry set.</p>
<p>And I liked the chemistry set and I liked the computer</p>
<p>and I just wanted to put them together.</p>
<p>I thought, wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if I could just use</p>
<p>the computer to control the chemistry set.</p>
<p>And obviously that was insane.</p>
<p>And I was like, you know, eight years old, right?</p>
<p>Nine years old, going on nine years old.</p>
<p>And then I invented the computer</p>
<p>just because I wanted to build this origin of life grid.</p>
<p>Which is like literally a billion test tubes</p>
<p>connected together in real time and real space,</p>
<p>basically throwing a chemical dice.</p>
<p>Throw dice, throw dice, throw dice.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get lucky.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we, I think Sarah and I</p>
<p>have been thinking very deeply about.</p>
<p>Because, you know, there&rsquo;s more money being spent</p>
<p>on the origin of the gravity</p>
<p>or looking at the Higgs boson than the origin of life, right?</p>
<p>And the origin of life is the, I think the biggest question</p>
<p>or not the biggest question, it is a big question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>It is the biggest question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re okay saying that.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it possible once you figure out the origin of life</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not going to solve,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not actually gonna solve</p>
<p>the question of what is life?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re kind of putting a lot of.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they&rsquo;re the same problem.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re putting, is it possible</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re putting too many,</p>
<p>too much bets into this origin part?</p>
<p>Maybe the origin thing isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there always a turtle underneath the turtle?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a stack of turtles?</p>
<p>Because then if you create it in the lab,</p>
<p>maybe you need some other stuff.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s not think about the origin.</p>
<p>Like in the lab, there&rsquo;s still memory.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So the experiment is already the product of evolution.</p>
<p>Right, in some maybe really deep way,</p>
<p>not an obvious way, in some very deep way.</p>
<p>So maybe the haters are always going to be like,</p>
<p>well, you have to reconstruct the fold.</p>
<p>You have to build a new script.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, the haters are not aware</p>
<p>of that argument.</p>
<p>Well, no, I know, I just.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the one making that argument usually, but yeah.</p>
<p>I just think that if we create life in the lab,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not obvious that you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>to the deep, deep understanding of necessarily,</p>
<p>what is the line between life and non life?</p>
<p>No, I think, so there&rsquo;s so much here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like playing devil.</p>
<p>So much here, but let me play devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>back in a previous conversation, right?</p>
<p>And say, yeah, I will.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got time.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Cellular automata.</p>
<p>Cellular automata, these very, very simple things</p>
<p>where you color squares black or white</p>
<p>and implement rules and play them in time.</p>
<p>And you can get these very, very complex patterns coming out.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s nice rules.</p>
<p>There are Turing complete rules and I would argue</p>
<p>that cellular automata don&rsquo;t really exist on their own.</p>
<p>They have to exist in a computing device.</p>
<p>If that, well, that&rsquo;s computing devices,</p>
<p>a piece of paper and abstraction,</p>
<p>a mathematician drawing a grid or a framework.</p>
<p>Now, so I would argue CAs are beautiful things,</p>
<p>simple, going complex, but the complexity is all borrowed</p>
<p>from the lithography, the numbers.</p>
<p>Right, now let&rsquo;s take that same argument</p>
<p>with the chemistry experiment origin of life.</p>
<p>What you need to be able to do is go,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m inspired to do this,</p>
<p>to go out and look for CAs occur in nature.</p>
<p>You know, let&rsquo;s kind of, let&rsquo;s find some CAs</p>
<p>that just emerge in our universe and.</p>
<p>For people just, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>for people just listening and in general,</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;re looking at is a cellular automata</p>
<p>where again, as Lee described,</p>
<p>there is just binary black or white squares</p>
<p>and they only have local information</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re born and they die.</p>
<p>And you would think nothing interesting would emerge,</p>
<p>but actually what we&rsquo;re looking at is something</p>
<p>that I believe is called glider guns</p>
<p>or a glider gun, which is moving objects</p>
<p>in this multi cell space that look like they&rsquo;re organisms</p>
<p>that have much more information,</p>
<p>that have much more complexity</p>
<p>than the individual building components.</p>
<p>In fact, look like they have a long term memory</p>
<p>while the individual components don&rsquo;t seem like</p>
<p>they have any memory at all, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>The argument here is that has to exist</p>
<p>on all this layer of infrastructure, right?</p>
<p>And though it looks simple.</p>
<p>And then what I would make, the argument I would make</p>
<p>if I were you, say, well, I think CAs are really simple</p>
<p>and everywhere, is say, show me how they emerge</p>
<p>in a substrate.</p>
<p>Now this goes to the origin of life, machine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we want to do the origin of life,</p>
<p>just any origin is good.</p>
<p>So we do, so we literally have our sand shaker,</p>
<p>shake the sand like massive grid of chemistry experiments,</p>
<p>shaking sand, shaking whatever.</p>
<p>And then because we know what we&rsquo;ve put in,</p>
<p>so we know how we&rsquo;ve cheated and the same way with CA,</p>
<p>we know how we&rsquo;ve cheated,</p>
<p>we know the number of operations needed,</p>
<p>we know how big a grid we want to get this.</p>
<p>If we could then say, okay,</p>
<p>how can we generate this recipe in the lab</p>
<p>and make a life form?</p>
<p>What contingency did we need to put in?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re upfront about how we cheated, okay?</p>
<p>Say, oh, you had to shake it, it was a periodic,</p>
<p>planet rotates, it&rsquo;s tried, comes in and out.</p>
<p>So, and then we can start to basically say,</p>
<p>okay, how difficult is it for these features to be found?</p>
<p>And then we can look for extra planets and other features.</p>
<p>So I think Sarah is absolutely right.</p>
<p>We want to explain to people we&rsquo;re cheating.</p>
<p>In fact, we have to cheat.</p>
<p>No one has given, I&rsquo;m good at writing grants,</p>
<p>well, I used to be, I&rsquo;m not very good right now,</p>
<p>I keep getting rejected,</p>
<p>but writing a grant for a planet in 100 million years,</p>
<p>no grant fund there is going to give me that,</p>
<p>but maybe money to make a kind of a grid,</p>
<p>a computer grid, origin of life computer grid.</p>
<p>In physical space.</p>
<p>In physical space, and just do it.</p>
<p>So Sarah said something which is,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t simulate the origin of life in a computer,</p>
<p>so like in simulation, why not?</p>
<p>What are your, you said it very confidently,</p>
<p>so is it possible and why would it be very difficult?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s your intuition there?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very difficult right now</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know the physics,</p>
<p>but if you go based on principles of assembly theory</p>
<p>and you think every molecule is actually</p>
<p>a very large causal graph, not just the molecule,</p>
<p>then you have to simulate all the features</p>
<p>of those causal graphs,</p>
<p>and I think it becomes computationally intractable.</p>
<p>You might as well just build the experiment.</p>
<p>Because you have, in the physical space,</p>
<p>you have all the objects with all the memories.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In the computer, you would have to copy them</p>
<p>or reconstruct them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a beautifully put,</p>
<p>and I would say that lots of people,</p>
<p>you just don&rsquo;t have enough resources.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to actually do the physical experiment</p>
<p>because we are literally,</p>
<p>I would view the physical experiment</p>
<p>almost like a computational experiment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just outsourcing, it&rsquo;s just basically,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just outsourcing all the matrix algebra.</p>
<p>And on your point about the experiment</p>
<p>being also an example of life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you want to design,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like all of us are lineages</p>
<p>of propagating information across time,</p>
<p>and so everything we do becomes part of life</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s part of that causal chain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like you want to try to pinch off</p>
<p>as much as you can of the information</p>
<p>from your causal chain that goes into the experiment,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t pinch off all of it</p>
<p>to move it to a different timeline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always going to be part of your timeline.</p>
<p>But at least if you can control</p>
<p>how much information you put in,</p>
<p>you can try to see how much does that particular trajectory</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve set up start generating its own assembly.</p>
<p>So you know where it starts,</p>
<p>and then you want to try to see it take off on its own</p>
<p>when you try to pinch it off as much as possible.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Quick pause, bathroom break.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We talked about the early days of the universe</p>
<p>when there was just stuff and no memory,</p>
<p>not even causality.</p>
<p>I think Lee at least implied</p>
<p>that causality is immersion somehow.</p>
<p>We could discuss this.</p>
<p>What happened before this all originated?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s outside the universe?</p>
<p>Divided by zero.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s not relevant, not understandable.</p>
<p>Is it useful to even ask the question?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Just because it&rsquo;s so hard?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a question.</p>
<p>If I can&rsquo;t do an experiment or even think of an experiment,</p>
<p>the question doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Well, no, you can&rsquo;t think of a lot of experiments,</p>
<p>no offense.</p>
<p>What I mean is I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Your causality graph is like,</p>
<p>this is what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there is limits to your ability</p>
<p>to construct experiments.</p>
<p>I agree, but I was trying to be facetious</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to make a point</p>
<p>because I think that if there is a causal bottleneck</p>
<p>through which information can&rsquo;t propagate in principle,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s very hard to think of an experiment,</p>
<p>even in principle, even one that&rsquo;s beyond</p>
<p>my mediocre intellect, right?</p>
<p>Which is fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to accept that.</p>
<p>But this is one of the things I actually do think</p>
<p>there was something before the Big Bang</p>
<p>because I would say that I think the Big Bang</p>
<p>just couldn&rsquo;t occur and create time.</p>
<p>Time created the Big Bang.</p>
<p>So there was time before the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There was no space, but there was time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I mean, I&rsquo;m just making that stuff up</p>
<p>just to make all the physicists happy,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you think that would make them happy</p>
<p>because they would be quite upset, actually.</p>
<p>And why would they be upset?</p>
<p>Because they would say that time can&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>before the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this goes back to an argument</p>
<p>that you might not want to have the argument here.</p>
<p>I was talking to Sarah earlier today</p>
<p>about an argument we had about time a long time ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A long time in time.</p>
<p>And what I would, it&rsquo;s like, I think there is this thing</p>
<p>called time or state creation.</p>
<p>The universe is creating states and it&rsquo;s outside of space,</p>
<p>but they create space.</p>
<p>So what I mean is you can imagine there are states</p>
<p>being created all the time.</p>
<p>And there is this thing called time.</p>
<p>Time is a clock, which you can use to measure</p>
<p>when things happen, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t measure something,</p>
<p>that states aren&rsquo;t being created.</p>
<p>And so you might locally refer to the Big Bang</p>
<p>and the Big Bang occurred at some point</p>
<p>when those states were there.</p>
<p>Probably there had to be enough states</p>
<p>for the Big Bang to occur.</p>
<p>And then, but I think that there is something wrong</p>
<p>with our conception of how the universe was created</p>
<p>and the Big Bang because we don&rsquo;t really get time.</p>
<p>Because again, I don&rsquo;t want to become boring</p>
<p>and sound like a broken record, but time is a real thing.</p>
<p>And until I can really explain that more elegantly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna get into more trouble.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re gonna talk about time</p>
<p>because time is a useful measuring device for experiments,</p>
<p>but also time is an ideal, okay.</p>
<p>But let me first ask Sarah, what do you think?</p>
<p>Is it a useful question to ask what happened</p>
<p>before the Big Bang?</p>
<p>Is it a useful question to ask what&rsquo;s outside the universe?</p>
<p>So I would think about it as the Big Bang</p>
<p>is an event that we reconstructed</p>
<p>as probably happening in the past of our universe</p>
<p>based on current observational data.</p>
<p>And so the way I like to think about it</p>
<p>is we exist locally in something called the universe.</p>
<p>So, and going back to like the physics of existence,</p>
<p>we exist locally in the space of all things that could exist</p>
<p>and we can infer certain properties of the structure</p>
<p>of where we exist locally.</p>
<p>And one of the properties that we&rsquo;ve inferred in the past</p>
<p>is that there is a thing we call the Big Bang.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some signatures of our local environment</p>
<p>that indicate that there was a very low information event</p>
<p>that started our universe.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually just an artifact</p>
<p>of the structure of the assembly space</p>
<p>that when you start losing all the memory in the objects,</p>
<p>it looks like what we call a Big Bang.</p>
<p>So I think it makes sense to talk about</p>
<p>where you are locally.</p>
<p>I think it makes sense to talk about</p>
<p>counterfactual possibilities,</p>
<p>what could exist outside the universe</p>
<p>in the sense that they become part of our reasoning</p>
<p>and therefore part of our causal chain</p>
<p>of things that we can do.</p>
<p>So like the multiverse in my mind exists,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t exist as a multiverse</p>
<p>of possible universes.</p>
<p>It exists as an idea in our minds</p>
<p>that allows us to reason about how physics works</p>
<p>and then to do physics differently</p>
<p>because we reason about it that way.</p>
<p>So I always like to recenter it on things exist,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t always exist like we think they exist.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re thinking about things outside the universe,</p>
<p>they absolutely exist because we&rsquo;re thinking about them,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t look like the projections in our minds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re something else.</p>
<p>And something you said just gave an idea</p>
<p>to go back to your question.</p>
<p>If there was, I mean, if something caused the Big Bang,</p>
<p>if there was some memory or some artifact of that,</p>
<p>then of course, to answer your question,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth going back to that</p>
<p>because that would imply there is something</p>
<p>beyond that barrier, that filter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you were saying, I guess, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m agnostic to what exists outside the universe.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>I think the most interesting things for us to be doing</p>
<p>are finding explanations that allow us to do more,</p>
<p>like that optimism.</p>
<p>So I tend to draw the boundary on questions I ask</p>
<p>as being scientific ones because I find</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s where the most creative potential is</p>
<p>to impact the future trajectory</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;re doing on this planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thing about the Big Bang</p>
<p>is basically from our current perspective</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;re able to detect,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the time when things were forgotten.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the time to reset from our limited perspective.</p>
<p>And so the question is, is it useful to ever study</p>
<p>the thing that was forgotten?</p>
<p>Or should we focus just on the memories</p>
<p>that are still there?</p>
<p>Well, the point I was trying to make about the experiment</p>
<p>is I was trying to say both things.</p>
<p>And I think perhaps yes, from the portfolio point of view,</p>
<p>if you could then imagine what was forgotten</p>
<p>and then work forwards,</p>
<p>you will have different consequences.</p>
<p>So then it becomes testable.</p>
<p>So as long as we can find tests,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s definitely worth thinking about.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t like is when physicists say</p>
<p>what happened before the Big Bang</p>
<p>and before, before, before,</p>
<p>without giving me any credible conjecture</p>
<p>about how would we know the difference?</p>
<p>But the way you framed it is quite nice.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what have we forgotten?</p>
<p>Is there room for God in assembly theory?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s God?</p>
<p>I like arguments for a necessary being better than God.</p>
<p>Well, I think I said it earlier.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a necessary being?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a necessary?</p>
<p>Like something that has to exist.</p>
<p>Oh, so you like, I mean, you like the shortest path.</p>
<p>Like does God need?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I mean, well, you can go back to like Thomas Aquinas</p>
<p>and arguments for the existence of God.</p>
<p>But I think most of the interesting theological arguments</p>
<p>are always about whether something has to exist</p>
<p>or there was a first thing that had to exist.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a lot of logical loopholes</p>
<p>in those kind of arguments.</p>
<p>Well, so God here, meaning the machine</p>
<p>that creates, that generates the stuff.</p>
<p>But God, so what I was trying to say earlier is that.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just the universe though?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, well, but there&rsquo;s a difference between,</p>
<p>I sort of imagine like a black box, like a machine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I would be more comfortable calling that God</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a machine.</p>
<p>You go into a room and there&rsquo;s a thing with a button.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t like the great programmer in the sky version.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if it&rsquo;s more kind of like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to think of, if you look at a cellular automata,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s the cells and the rules,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t feel like God</p>
<p>that generates a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s a machine like that does,</p>
<p>that runs the cellular automata and set the rules,</p>
<p>then that feels like God.</p>
<p>That sort of, in terms of terminology.</p>
<p>So I wonder if there&rsquo;s like a machine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required to generate this universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very sort of important for running this in the lab.</p>
<p>So as I said earlier, I think I said this earlier,</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t remember the phrase, but something like,</p>
<p>I mean, does God exist in our universe?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Where does God exist?</p>
<p>God at least exists in abstraction in our minds,</p>
<p>particularly of people who have religious faith</p>
<p>they believe in.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s then take, but you&rsquo;re talking a little bit more</p>
<p>about generics, say, well,</p>
<p>is there a mechanism beyond the universe you&rsquo;re calling God?</p>
<p>I would say God did not exist at the beginning,</p>
<p>but he or she does now.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m saying the mechanism.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t know that he didn&rsquo;t exist in the beginning.</p>
<p>So like this could be us in our minds trying to,</p>
<p>like just listening to gravitational waves,</p>
<p>detecting gravitational waves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s us trying to go back further and further</p>
<p>into our memories to try to understand the machines</p>
<p>that make up, that make up us.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s possible that we&rsquo;re trying to grasp</p>
<p>at possible kind of what kind of machines could create.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a tweet.</p>
<p>If the universe is a computer, then God must have built it</p>
<p>because computers need creators.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>And then Joshe Bach replied,</p>
<p>since there&rsquo;s something rather than nothing,</p>
<p>perhaps existence is the default.</p>
<p>If existence is the default, then many computers exist.</p>
<p>Creator gods are necessary computers,</p>
<p>unnecessarily computers too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very confused by that, but that&rsquo;s an interesting idea</p>
<p>that existence is the default versus nonexistence.</p>
<p>I agree with that, but the rest is not.</p>
<p>And then Lee responds,</p>
<p>perhaps this reasoning is incomplete.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how scientists talk trash each other</p>
<p>on Twitter apparently.</p>
<p>Which part don&rsquo;t you agree with?</p>
<p>When he said if existence is default,</p>
<p>then many computers exist,</p>
<p>this comes back to the inventor and discovery argument.</p>
<p>I would say the universe at the beginning wasn&rsquo;t capable</p>
<p>of computation because there wasn&rsquo;t enough technology,</p>
<p>enough states.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is if God is a mechanism,</p>
<p>so I might actually agree,</p>
<p>but then the thing is lots of people see God</p>
<p>as more than a mechanism.</p>
<p>For me, God could be the causal graph in assembly theory</p>
<p>that creates all the stuff that the memories we know.</p>
<p>And the fact that we can even relate to each other</p>
<p>is because we have the same, we share that heritage.</p>
<p>And why we love each other</p>
<p>or we like to see God in each other</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s just we know we have a shared existence.</p>
<p>So if the God is the mechanism</p>
<p>that created this whole thing,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people see God in a religious sense</p>
<p>as that mechanism also being able to communicate</p>
<p>with the objects it creates.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s just the mechanism,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t be able to communicate with the objects it creates.</p>
<p>It can only create.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t interact with the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s versions of God that create the universe</p>
<p>and then left.</p>
<p>Yeah, like spark.</p>
<p>For some religions.</p>
<p>The first spark, yeah.</p>
<p>But I think I liked your analogy</p>
<p>of the machine and the rules, right?</p>
<p>But I think part of the problem is,</p>
<p>I mean, we have this conception</p>
<p>that we can disentangle the rules</p>
<p>from the physical substrate, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the whole thing about software and hardware</p>
<p>being separate or the way Newton wrote his laws</p>
<p>that there was some,</p>
<p>like they exist outside the universe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not actually a feature of the universe.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to emerge out of the universe itself.</p>
<p>So I think if you merge your two views,</p>
<p>then it gets back to the God is the universe.</p>
<p>And then I think the deeper question</p>
<p>is why does it seem like there&rsquo;s meaning and purpose?</p>
<p>And if I think about the features of the universe</p>
<p>that give it the most meaning and purpose,</p>
<p>those are what we would call</p>
<p>the living components of the universe.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to say God is a physically real thing,</p>
<p>which you were saying</p>
<p>is like an emergent property of our minds,</p>
<p>but I would just say the way the universe</p>
<p>creates meaning and purpose,</p>
<p>there is really a physics there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a illusory thing.</p>
<p>And that is just what the physics of life is.</p>
<p>Is it possible that we&rsquo;ve forgotten</p>
<p>much of the mechanisms that created the universe?</p>
<p>So like, so basically, you know,</p>
<p>whatever, if God is that mechanism,</p>
<p>we just leave parts of that behind.</p>
<p>Well, but the universe is constantly generating itself.</p>
<p>So if God is that mechanism,</p>
<p>it would be that that would still be active today.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, like, I&rsquo;m agnostic,</p>
<p>but if I recall the things I believe in God</p>
<p>in the way that some people talk about God,</p>
<p>I would say that God is, you know,</p>
<p>like in the universe now, it&rsquo;s not an absent thing.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a mislabeling here</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re, I mean, I mean, I&rsquo;m a professional idiot,</p>
<p>actually, but, but, um.</p>
<p>You should put that on your CV.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Professionally, not recreationally or amateur,</p>
<p>but professionally, you&rsquo;re paid for it.</p>
<p>I would say if you were talking about God,</p>
<p>I mean, again, I&rsquo;m way out, way out of my depth here,</p>
<p>and I almost feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I feel quite uncomfortable articulating,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>For me, a lot of people that think of God as a consciousness</p>
<p>and a reasoning entity that actually has causal power,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re, and so you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re saying like gravity could be God</p>
<p>or time could be God.</p>
<p>I mean, I think for me, for my conception of time</p>
<p>is probably as fundamental as God</p>
<p>because it gave rise to human intelligence and consciousness</p>
<p>in which we can have this abstract notion of God.</p>
<p>So I think that you&rsquo;re maybe talking about God</p>
<p>in a very mechanistic, kind of unsophisticated sense,</p>
<p>whereas other people say that God is more sophisticated</p>
<p>and got all this, you know, feelings and love</p>
<p>and, you know, and this abstracting ability.</p>
<p>So is that what, or do you mean that?</p>
<p>Do you mean God as in this conscious entity</p>
<p>that decided to flick the universe into existence?</p>
<p>Well, one of the features that God would have</p>
<p>is the ability to flick the universe into existence.</p>
<p>I, you know, like Windows 95,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if God is Windows 95 or Windows XP</p>
<p>or Windows 10, I don&rsquo;t know the full feature set.</p>
<p>So at the very least, you have to flick the universe</p>
<p>into existence, and then other features might include</p>
<p>ability to interact with that universe in interesting ways,</p>
<p>and then how do you interact with the universe</p>
<p>in interesting ways?</p>
<p>You have to be able to speak the language</p>
<p>of its different components.</p>
<p>So in order to interact with humans,</p>
<p>you have to know how to act humanlike.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, but it seems like</p>
<p>whatever mechanism created the universe</p>
<p>might want to also generate local pockets of mechanisms</p>
<p>that can interact with that.</p>
<p>Like inject.</p>
<p>Like God was lonely?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it could be just a teenager</p>
<p>and another just playing a video game.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>Well, I was gonna say, I mean, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>so this is referring to our origin of life engine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t believe in God,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t wanna be one.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna make a universe and make a life form,</p>
<p>but that may be rude to people who have</p>
<p>dear religious beliefs.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is if we are able to create</p>
<p>an entirely new life form, different chemistry,</p>
<p>different culture, what does it make us?</p>
<p>By that definition, it makes us gods, right?</p>
<p>Well, there is.</p>
<p>I mean, like when you have children,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like one of the magical things of that</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re kind of mini gods.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, from a child&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>parents are gods for quite a while.</p>
<p>And then, I mean, in the positive sense,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a magic to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love robotics,</p>
<p>is you instill life into something,</p>
<p>and that makes you feel godlike in a sort of positive way.</p>
<p>Being a creator is a positive feeling.</p>
<p>Creator, yeah, exactly, on a small scale.</p>
<p>And then God would be a creator</p>
<p>at the largest possible scale, I suppose.</p>
<p>Okay, you mentioned offline the Assembletron.</p>
<p>Assembletron.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an Assembletron?</p>
<p>This is an early idea of something you&rsquo;re thinking about.</p>
<p>So Sarah&rsquo;s team, well, I think Sarah&rsquo;s team</p>
<p>are interested in using AI to understand life.</p>
<p>My team is, and I&rsquo;m wondering if we could apply</p>
<p>the principles of assembly theory,</p>
<p>that is the causal structure that you get</p>
<p>with assembly theory, and hybridize it,</p>
<p>and make a new type of neuron, if you like.</p>
<p>I mean, there are causal neural networks out there,</p>
<p>but they are not quite the architecture</p>
<p>of what I would like.</p>
<p>I would like to associate memory bits with,</p>
<p>basically, I&rsquo;d like to make a,</p>
<p>rather than having an ASIC for neural networks,</p>
<p>I wanna make an ASIC for assembly networks, right?</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>So can you say that again?</p>
<p>Assembly networks.</p>
<p>So what is a thing with an input and an output,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a neural network type of thing,</p>
<p>what does it do exactly?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the input, what&rsquo;s the output?</p>
<p>So in this case, so if you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>a general neural network, I mean,</p>
<p>in general neural network, you can train it</p>
<p>on any sort of data, right, depending on the framework,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s like text, or image data, or whatnot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine, but there&rsquo;s no causal structure</p>
<p>associated with that data.</p>
<p>Now just imagine, rather than, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re gonna classify a difference</p>
<p>between cat and dog, right?</p>
<p>Classic cat and dog neural network.</p>
<p>What about if the system understood the assembly space,</p>
<p>it created the cat and the dog,</p>
<p>and rather than guessing what was happening,</p>
<p>and training on those images,</p>
<p>and not understanding those features,</p>
<p>you almost like, you could imagine doing a,</p>
<p>going back a step and doing, and training,</p>
<p>going back a step and doing the training,</p>
<p>going back a step, back a step, back a step,</p>
<p>and I wonder if that is actually the origin of intelligence,</p>
<p>or how we&rsquo;ll crack intelligence.</p>
<p>Because we need to, because we&rsquo;ll create</p>
<p>the entire graph of events, and be able to kind of</p>
<p>look at cause and effect across those graphs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m explaining it really badly,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a gene of an idea, and I&rsquo;m guessing</p>
<p>very smart, very rich people in AI are already doing this.</p>
<p>Trying to not generate cats and dogs,</p>
<p>but trying to generate things of high assembly index.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think, and also using causal graphs</p>
<p>in neural networks, and machine learning, and deep learning,</p>
<p>maybe building a new architecture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering, is there something</p>
<p>we can get out of assembly theory</p>
<p>that allows us to rebuild current machine learning</p>
<p>architectures to give causation more cheaply?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s what you,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been inventing this for a little while,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re trying to finish the theory paper first</p>
<p>before we do anything else.</p>
<p>Yeah, you also wanna have, say, goal directed behavior</p>
<p>in neural networks, then assembly theory</p>
<p>is a good framework for doing that.</p>
<p>Daniel&rsquo;s been thinking about that a lot.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a really interesting idea</p>
<p>that you can map concepts from how neural networks learn</p>
<p>to thinking about goal directed behavior</p>
<p>as a learning process.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re learning a specific goal.</p>
<p>The universe is learning a goal</p>
<p>when it generates a particular structure,</p>
<p>and that you can map that physical structure</p>
<p>in a neural network.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal?</p>
<p>Well, in a neural network, you&rsquo;re designing the goal.</p>
<p>In biology, I mean, people are not supposed to use</p>
<p>teleological language in biology, which is ridiculous,</p>
<p>but, because goals are real things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just post selected.</p>
<p>So you can talk about goals after the fact.</p>
<p>Once a goal emerges in the universe,</p>
<p>that physical entity has a goal.</p>
<p>But Lee and I came up with a test for,</p>
<p>like a Turing test for goal directed behavior</p>
<p>based on the idea of assembly.</p>
<p>We have to formalize it still,</p>
<p>but I would like to write a paper on it.</p>
<p>But the basic idea is if you had two systems</p>
<p>that were completely equivalent,</p>
<p>you know, like in the instantaneous,</p>
<p>like physical experimental setup.</p>
<p>So Lee has to figure out how to do this.</p>
<p>But there was something that would be different</p>
<p>in their future.</p>
<p>And there was a symmetry breaking you observe</p>
<p>in the present based on that possibility</p>
<p>of that future outcome.</p>
<p>Then you could say that that system</p>
<p>had some representation of some kind of goal in mind</p>
<p>about what it wanted to do in the future.</p>
<p>And I, so goals are interesting</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t exist as instantaneous things.</p>
<p>They exist across time,</p>
<p>which is one of the reasons that assembly theories</p>
<p>may be more naturally able to account</p>
<p>for the existence of goals.</p>
<p>So goals are, they only exist in time,</p>
<p>or they manifest themselves in time</p>
<p>through, you said, symmetry breaking.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like, imagine,</p>
<p>like if representations in your mind are real, right?</p>
<p>And you can imagine future possibilities,</p>
<p>but imagine everything else is physically equivalent.</p>
<p>And the only thing that you actually change</p>
<p>your decision based on is what you model</p>
<p>as being the future outcome.</p>
<p>Then somehow that representation in your mind</p>
<p>of the future outcome becomes causal</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re doing now.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of like retro causal effect,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not actually retro causal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that your assembly space</p>
<p>is actually includes those possibilities</p>
<p>as part of the structure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you&rsquo;re not observing all the features</p>
<p>of the assembly space in the current moment.</p>
<p>Or the possibilities exist, but they don&rsquo;t become a goal</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re realized.</p>
<p>So one of the features of assembly space</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super interesting,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s easier to envision with like Legos, for example,</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re thinking about an assembly space,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t observe the entire assembly space</p>
<p>in any instant in time.</p>
<p>So if you imagine a stack of Legos,</p>
<p>and you wanna look at the assembly space of a stack of Legos,</p>
<p>you have to break the Legos apart,</p>
<p>and then you look at all the possible ways</p>
<p>of building up the original object.</p>
<p>So now you have in your mind</p>
<p>the goal of building that object,</p>
<p>and you have all the possible ways of doing it.</p>
<p>And those are actual physical features of that object,</p>
<p>but that object doesn&rsquo;t always exist.</p>
<p>What exists is the possibility of generating it.</p>
<p>And the possibilities are always infinite.</p>
<p>Well, for that particular object,</p>
<p>like it has a well defined assembly space.</p>
<p>And I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is that object</p>
<p>is the assembly space,</p>
<p>but you actually have to unpack that object across time</p>
<p>to view that feature of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only an observable across time.</p>
<p>The term goal is such a important</p>
<p>and difficult to explain concept, right?</p>
<p>Because what you want is a way is like,</p>
<p>I think only conscious beings can have conscious goals.</p>
<p>Everything else is doing selection.</p>
<p>And but selection does invent goals.</p>
<p>And in a way that the way that biology reinterprets the past</p>
<p>in the present is kind of helped you to understand</p>
<p>there was a goal in the past now, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like goals only exist back in time.</p>
<p>So first of all, only conscious beings</p>
<p>can have conscious goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even gonna touch that one.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Go for it, come on.</p>
<p>The line between conscious goals</p>
<p>and non conscious goals, exactly.</p>
<p>And also maybe just on top of that,</p>
<p>you said a Turing test for goal directed behavior.</p>
<p>What does a Turing test potentially look like?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve got two objects, we were thinking about this.</p>
<p>So we actually got some funding</p>
<p>to work to go on two teams.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to do, and part of this</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m trying to do a bit of theory</p>
<p>and Sarah is teaching me a bit of theory</p>
<p>and Sarah is trying to design experiments</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m teaching experiments.</p>
<p>Cause I think it&rsquo;s really good for us to have that.</p>
<p>So say, when would a, so that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I like this, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re using Dan Dennett essay.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I can explain why we wouldn&rsquo;t want to call it</p>
<p>a Turing test after, but Dan Dennett.</p>
<p>So Dan Dennett wrote this really nice essay</p>
<p>about herding cats and freewill inflation.</p>
<p>The title is so brilliant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the actual title?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the title, yeah.</p>
<p>Herding cats and freewill inflation.</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not, maybe not.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>No, I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve got a, let&rsquo;s imagine you&rsquo;ve got two objects</p>
<p>on a hillside, okay?</p>
<p>And it just happens to be a snowy hill</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just say you see an object</p>
<p>get rolling down the hill.</p>
<p>Or you, and the rock rolls down the hill</p>
<p>but the start goes to the end.</p>
<p>How do you know that object&rsquo;s had a goal?</p>
<p>Now you unveil the object</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s actually a skier.</p>
<p>And the skier starts at the top and goes down the bottom.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Then you look at the rock.</p>
<p>Rock rolls down the hill and goes to the bottom.</p>
<p>How can you tell the difference between the two?</p>
<p>So, and what Dan says is like, well, this is clear.</p>
<p>The skier&rsquo;s in control.</p>
<p>And because they&rsquo;re adjusting the trajectory,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s some updating going on.</p>
<p>Then the only way you could really do that</p>
<p>is if you put the skier back to the top of the hill again,</p>
<p>they would tend to start roughly in the same space</p>
<p>and probably take all that complex set of trajectories</p>
<p>and end up pretty much at the same finish point, right?</p>
<p>With plus or minus a few meters.</p>
<p>Whereas if it was just a random rock</p>
<p>going down to a random trajectory, that wouldn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And so what Sarah and I were kind of doing</p>
<p>when we were writing this grant,</p>
<p>we were like, we need to somehow instantiate the skier</p>
<p>and the rock in an experiment.</p>
<p>And then say, okay, when does the object,</p>
<p>so for an object to have a goal, it has to have an update.</p>
<p>It has to have some sensing and some kind of,</p>
<p>you know, inbuilt actuation to respond to the environment.</p>
<p>And then we just have to iterate on that.</p>
<p>And maybe Sarah, you can then fill in the Turing test part.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I guess the motivation for me</p>
<p>was slightly different.</p>
<p>So I get really frustrated about conversations</p>
<p>about consciousness as most people do.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people are,</p>
<p>which is not necessarily related to free will directly</p>
<p>or to this goal directed behavior.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a whole set of bundled</p>
<p>and related topics here.</p>
<p>But I think for me, I was, you know,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s always interested in explaining</p>
<p>intrinsic experience and quantifying intrinsic experience.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all sorts of problems with that</p>
<p>because you can never actually be another physical system.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to be another physical system.</p>
<p>So I always thought there must be some way</p>
<p>of getting at this problem about</p>
<p>if an agent or an entity is conscious</p>
<p>or at least has internal representations</p>
<p>and those are real physical things,</p>
<p>that it must have causal consequences.</p>
<p>So the way I would ask the question of consciousness</p>
<p>is not, you know, what is it like intrinsically?</p>
<p>But if things have intrinsic experience,</p>
<p>is there any observable difference from the outside</p>
<p>about the kind of causation</p>
<p>that that physical system would enact in?</p>
<p>And for me, the most interesting thing that humans do</p>
<p>is have imagination.</p>
<p>So like we can imagine rockets centuries</p>
<p>before we build them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve become real physical things</p>
<p>because we imagine them.</p>
<p>And people might disentangle that from conscious experience,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of the sort of imagination we do</p>
<p>is actually a conscious process.</p>
<p>So then this becomes a question of</p>
<p>if I were observing systems and I said,</p>
<p>one had an internal representation,</p>
<p>which is slightly different</p>
<p>than a conscious experience, obviously.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m entangling some concepts,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a loose set of thought experiments.</p>
<p>Then how, and I set them up</p>
<p>in a physically equivalent situation.</p>
<p>Would it be the case that</p>
<p>there would be experimental observables associated with it?</p>
<p>And that became the idea of trying to actually</p>
<p>measure for internal representation and conscious.</p>
<p>So Turing basically didn&rsquo;t wanna do that.</p>
<p>You just wanted the machine that could emulate</p>
<p>and trick you into having the behavior,</p>
<p>but never dealt with the internal experience</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t know how to do that.</p>
<p>And I guess I was wondering,</p>
<p>is there a way to set up the experiment</p>
<p>where you could actually test for that?</p>
<p>For imagination that led to the thing.</p>
<p>That there was something internal going on,</p>
<p>some kind of inner world, as people say,</p>
<p>or you could say, it actually is an agent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s making decisions, it has an internal representation.</p>
<p>And whether you say that&rsquo;s experience or not</p>
<p>is a different thing, but at least the feature</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some abstraction it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not obvious from looking at the physical substrates.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to do that kind of thing?</p>
<p>One of the compelling things about the Turing test</p>
<p>is that defining intelligence,</p>
<p>defining any complicated concept</p>
<p>as a thing like observing it from the surface</p>
<p>and not caring about what&rsquo;s going on deep inside</p>
<p>because how do you know?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>So the idea is exactly that.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>the Turing test for goal directedness</p>
<p>is literally take some objects</p>
<p>that clearly don&rsquo;t have any internal representation,</p>
<p>grains of sand blowing on the beach or something,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know, a crab wandering around on the beach</p>
<p>and then generating an experiment</p>
<p>where literally the experiment generates an entity</p>
<p>that literally has no internal representation to sand,</p>
<p>these are oil droplets actually,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve got in mind, a robot that makes oil droplets.</p>
<p>But then what we wanna try and do</p>
<p>is train the oil droplets to be like crabs,</p>
<p>give them an internal representation,</p>
<p>give them the ability to integrate information</p>
<p>from the environment so they remember the past,</p>
<p>are in the present, and can imagine a future.</p>
<p>And in a very limited way, their kind of game engine,</p>
<p>their limited simulation of the world</p>
<p>allows them to then make a decision.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re objects across time.</p>
<p>So then you would run a bunch of crabs</p>
<p>like over and over and over and over?</p>
<p>How many crabs, Lee?</p>
<p>How many, is there, what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>because you have to have a large number of crabs,</p>
<p>what does your theory say, is there a mathematical?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working on it, I mean, this is literally.</p>
<p>Limit, crab limit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally a.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally a.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the herding cats have to do?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s random, wait, what&rsquo;s cats,</p>
<p>in the title by Daniel Dennett,</p>
<p>Herding Cats and the Free Will Inflation.</p>
<p>So, I love this.</p>
<p>What does herding cats mean,</p>
<p>what does free will inflation mean?</p>
<p>So this, I love this essay,</p>
<p>because it explained to me</p>
<p>how I can live in a deterministic universe,</p>
<p>but have, not free will, but have freedom.</p>
<p>And also it helped me explain</p>
<p>that time needed to be a real thing in this universe.</p>
<p>So what basically Dan was saying here is like,</p>
<p>how do you, how do these cats appear</p>
<p>to just do what they want, right?</p>
<p>And if you live in a deterministic universe,</p>
<p>why do the cats do these things?</p>
<p>You know, aren&rsquo;t they just, isn&rsquo;t it all obvious?</p>
<p>And how does free will inflate the universe?</p>
<p>And for me, I mean, probably I love the essay</p>
<p>because my interpretation of the essay</p>
<p>in assembly theory makes complete sense.</p>
<p>Because you need an expanding universe</p>
<p>in assembly theory to create novelty</p>
<p>that you search for,</p>
<p>that then when you find something interesting</p>
<p>and you keep doing it because it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>and it gives you an advantage,</p>
<p>then it appears in the past to be a goal.</p>
<p>So what does, in assembly theory,</p>
<p>the expansion of the universe look like?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>Why does the expansion of the universe</p>
<p>give you more possibilities of novelty and cool stuff?</p>
<p>So for me, I don&rsquo;t think about the universe</p>
<p>in terms of big bang and space.</p>
<p>I think about it in terms of the big memory expansion.</p>
<p>That you have one, you only have the ability</p>
<p>to store one bit of information,</p>
<p>so then you can&rsquo;t do very much.</p>
<p>So what the universe has been doing since forever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been creating more,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been increasing the size of its RAM, okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like one megabyte, two megabyte,</p>
<p>three megabyte, four megabytes, all the way up.</p>
<p>And so the more RAM you have,</p>
<p>the more you can remember about the past,</p>
<p>which allows you to do cooler things in the future.</p>
<p>So if you can remember how to launch a rocket,</p>
<p>then you might be able to imagine how to land a rocket,</p>
<p>and then relaunch, reland, and carry on.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re able to expand the space</p>
<p>and remember the past.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>But not a perfect memory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question,</p>
<p>whether there&rsquo;s some forgetting that happens</p>
<p>that might increase.</p>
<p>Is the expansion of the forgetting, at some point,</p>
<p>accelerate faster than the remembering?</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a very important thing</p>
<p>that probably intelligence does,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna learn in machine learning about,</p>
<p>because you want machine learning right now,</p>
<p>or artificial intelligence right now,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have memory right,</p>
<p>but you want the ability to,</p>
<p>or not for, if you want to get to human like consciousness,</p>
<p>you need to have the ability, I suppose, to remember stuff</p>
<p>and then to selectively forget stuff</p>
<p>so you can re remember it and compress it.</p>
<p>Arguably, the way that we come up with new physical laws.</p>
<p>I think that there is a great deal to be gained</p>
<p>from having the ability to remember things,</p>
<p>but then when you forget them,</p>
<p>you can then have a,</p>
<p>you can basically do the simulation again</p>
<p>and work out if you get to that compressed representation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s in cycles.</p>
<p>So cycles of remembering and forgetting</p>
<p>are probably important,</p>
<p>but there shouldn&rsquo;t be excuse to have a universe</p>
<p>with no memory in it.</p>
<p>The universe is gonna remember that it forgot,</p>
<p>but just not tell you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at this paper</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s talking about a puppet controlling a puppet</p>
<p>controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling</p>
<p>a puppet controlling a puppet,</p>
<p>conceptually easy to understand,</p>
<p>but physically impossible,</p>
<p>as physically impossible as predicting a fair coin toss.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s talking about,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s pictures of puppets controlling puppets.</p>
<p>Let me ask you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few things I wanna ask,</p>
<p>but we brought up time quite a bit.</p>
<p>You guys tweet about time quite a bit.</p>
<p>What is time in all of this?</p>
<p>We kind of mentioned it a bunch.</p>
<p>Is it not important at all in terms of,</p>
<p>is it just a word?</p>
<p>Should we be talking about causality mostly?</p>
<p>Like Sarah, what do you think?</p>
<p>Is, we&rsquo;ve talked about like memories.</p>
<p>Is that the fundamental thing</p>
<p>that we should be thinking about?</p>
<p>And time is just a useful measurement device or something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s different concepts of time, right?</p>
<p>So I think in assembly theory,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the ordering of things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the causal graph part.</p>
<p>And so then the fundamental structure of the universe</p>
<p>is that there is a certain ordering</p>
<p>and certain things can&rsquo;t happen till other things happen.</p>
<p>But usually when we colloquially talk about time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the flow of time.</p>
<p>And I guess Lee and I were actually debating</p>
<p>about this this morning.</p>
<p>So in talking on it, walking on the river here,</p>
<p>which is a very lovely spot for talking about time,</p>
<p>but that when the universe is updating,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s transitioning between things that exist now</p>
<p>and things that exist now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the flow of time.</p>
<p>So you have to separate out those concepts at bare minimum.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also an arrow of time</p>
<p>that people talk about in physics,</p>
<p>which is that time doesn&rsquo;t appear to have a directionality</p>
<p>in fundamental physics, but it does to us, right?</p>
<p>Like we can&rsquo;t go backwards in time.</p>
<p>And usually that would be explained in physics</p>
<p>in terms of, well, there&rsquo;s a cosmological arrow of time,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the thermodynamic arrow of time</p>
<p>of increasing entropy.</p>
<p>But what we would say in assembly theory</p>
<p>is that there is a clear directionality.</p>
<p>The universe only runs in one direction,</p>
<p>which is why some things, it&rsquo;s easy to make,</p>
<p>if the universe runs in one direction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to make processes look reversible.</p>
<p>For example, if they have no memory,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re easy to run forward and backwards,</p>
<p>which is why the laws of physics that we have now</p>
<p>look the way they do, because they involve objects</p>
<p>that have no memory.</p>
<p>But when you get to things like us,</p>
<p>it becomes very clear that the universe</p>
<p>has a directionality associated to it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not reversible at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the no man ever steps in the same river.</p>
<p>I just have to bring that out</p>
<p>because you walked on the river.</p>
<p>No man ever steps in the same river twice</p>
<p>before he&rsquo;s not the same river and he&rsquo;s not the same man.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not reversible, any of the same.</p>
<p>No, but reversibility is an emergent property, right?</p>
<p>So we think of the reversibility laws as being fundamental</p>
<p>and the irreversibility as being emergent.</p>
<p>But I think what we would say from how we think about it,</p>
<p>and it certainly seems to be the case</p>
<p>for our perception of time,</p>
<p>but also what&rsquo;s happening in biological evolution,</p>
<p>you can make things reversible,</p>
<p>but it requires work to do it.</p>
<p>And it requires certain machines</p>
<p>to run it forward and backward.</p>
<p>And Chiara Marletto is working some interesting ideas</p>
<p>on constructor theory related to that,</p>
<p>which is a totally different set of ideas.</p>
<p>You can travel back in time sometimes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t travel actually back in time,</p>
<p>but you could reconstruct things</p>
<p>that have existed in the past.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always moving forward in time,</p>
<p>but you can cycle through.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, I can&hellip;</p>
<p>Can I clarify what you just said?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, go for it.</p>
<p>Quickly, you travel forward in time to travel back.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Thank you, that really clarified it.</p>
<p>What Sarah&rsquo;s saying is you don&rsquo;t go back in time,</p>
<p>you recreate what happened in the past in the future</p>
<p>and inspect it again.</p>
<p>So in that local pocket of time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as if you travel back in time.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>How is that not traveling back in time?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not going back</p>
<p>to your same self back in time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re creating that in the future.</p>
<p>But everything else is the same as it was in the past.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, it&rsquo;s not in registry.</p>
<p>I mean, it goes back to the big question I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I mean, this is something I was trying to look up today</p>
<p>when we first had this discussion</p>
<p>and I was talking to Sarah on Skype and said,</p>
<p>by the way, time is the fundamental thing in the universe.</p>
<p>She almost hung up on me.</p>
<p>Right, but you can even&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, if you wanna make an analogy to computation,</p>
<p>and I think Charles Bennett actually has a paper on this</p>
<p>like about reversible computation</p>
<p>and reversible Turing machines.</p>
<p>In order to make it reversible,</p>
<p>you have to store memory to run the process backwards.</p>
<p>So time is always running forward in that</p>
<p>because you have to write the memory.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t erase the memory.</p>
<p>You can erase the memory,</p>
<p>but the point when you go back to zero, right?</p>
<p>But the whole point is that in order to have a process</p>
<p>that even runs in both directions,</p>
<p>you have to start talking about memory</p>
<p>to store the information to run it backwards.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t really then&hellip;</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have it exactly how it was in the past.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You have extra stuff, extra baggage always.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>A really important thing that I want to say on this,</p>
<p>I think if I try and get it right,</p>
<p>I have to say that if you can think</p>
<p>that the universe is expanding</p>
<p>in terms of the number of boxes</p>
<p>that it has to store states, right?</p>
<p>And this is where the directionality of the universe</p>
<p>comes from, everything comes from.</p>
<p>You could erase what&rsquo;s in those boxes,</p>
<p>but the fact you&rsquo;ve now got so many boxes at time now</p>
<p>in this present, there&rsquo;s more of those boxes</p>
<p>than there were in the past.</p>
<p>See, but the boxes aren&rsquo;t physical boxes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not space or time.</p>
<p>Why is the number of boxes always expanding?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to imagine this</p>
<p>because we live in space.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying, which is I think probably correct,</p>
<p>is that we just, let&rsquo;s just imagine for a second,</p>
<p>there is a nonlocal situation,</p>
<p>but there are these things called states</p>
<p>and that the universe irrespective</p>
<p>of whether you measure anything,</p>
<p>there is a universal, let&rsquo;s call it a clock</p>
<p>or a state creator.</p>
<p>Maybe we can call it, that&rsquo;s why maybe you can call it God,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s call it a state creator</p>
<p>where the universe is expanding</p>
<p>in the number of states it has.</p>
<p>Why are you saying it&rsquo;s expanding though?</p>
<p>Is that obvious that it&rsquo;s expanding?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious because that&rsquo;s where the,</p>
<p>because we, we.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a source of novelty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a source of novelty</p>
<p>and it also explains why the universe is not predictable.</p>
<p>How do you know it&rsquo;s not predictable?</p>
<p>I just like interrupting you.</p>
<p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s fun, because you&rsquo;re struggling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struggling because I&rsquo;m trying to be</p>
<p>as concrete as possible and not sound like I&rsquo;m insane.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious because you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a chemist.</p>
<p>So as a chemist, I grew into the world</p>
<p>understanding irreversibility.</p>
<p>Irreversibility is all I knew.</p>
<p>And when people start telling me</p>
<p>the universe is actually reversible, it&rsquo;s a magic trick.</p>
<p>We can use time to do it.</p>
<p>So what I mean is that the second law</p>
<p>is really the magical.</p>
<p>But why does it need to be magical?</p>
<p>The universe is just asymmetric.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is the universe is asymmetric</p>
<p>in the state production and we can erase those states,</p>
<p>but we just have more computational power.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is that the universe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>deterministic horizon,</p>
<p>this is one of the reasons we can&rsquo;t live in a simulation,</p>
<p>by the way, you can&rsquo;t live in a simulation.</p>
<p>The irreversibility.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so basically every time</p>
<p>you try and simulate the universe,</p>
<p>in this, you know, I live in a simulation,</p>
<p>the universe is expanded in states.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh damn it,</p>
<p>I need to make my computer bigger again.</p>
<p>And every time you try and contain the universe</p>
<p>in the computation,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s got bigger in number of states.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m saying the fact the universe has novelty in it</p>
<p>is going to turn out experimentally to be proof</p>
<p>that time, as I&rsquo;ve labeled it, is fundamental</p>
<p>and exists as a physical thing that creates space.</p>
<p>Okay, so if you can prove that novelty</p>
<p>is always being created,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that it&rsquo;s possible to also then prove</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s always expanding in the state space.</p>
<p>Those are things that have to be proven.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re working on experiments for, yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to, like by looking at the sliver</p>
<p>of reality, show that there&rsquo;s always novelty being generated.</p>
<p>Yeah, because if we go live in a universe</p>
<p>that conventional physicists would live in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big lookup table of stuff and everything exists.</p>
<p>I want to prove that that book doesn&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s continuously being added pages on.</p>
<p>So all I&rsquo;m saying, if the universe is a book,</p>
<p>we started, the universe at the beginning only had no pages</p>
<p>and had one page, another page, another page.</p>
<p>Whereas a physicist would now say all the pages exist</p>
<p>and we could in principle access them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that is fundamentally incorrect.</p>
<p>Do you know what&rsquo;s written in this book?</p>
<p>The free will question.</p>
<p>Is there room for free will in this view</p>
<p>of the universe is generating novelty</p>
<p>and getting greater and greater assembly structures built?</p>
<p>Sarah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Next question.</p>
<p>Why, what&rsquo;s the source of free will in this?</p>
<p>Well, I think it depends on what you mean by free will, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, please, there&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>I think what I&rsquo;m interested in</p>
<p>as far as the phenomena of free will is,</p>
<p>do we have individual autonomy and agency?</p>
<p>And when I do things, is it really me</p>
<p>or is it my atoms that did it?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the part that&rsquo;s interesting to me.</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s also the determinism versus randomness part.</p>
<p>But the way I think about it is like each of us</p>
<p>are like a thread or like an assembly space</p>
<p>through this giant possibility space.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re moving on our own trajectory</p>
<p>through that space and that is defined by our history.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re sort of causally contingent on our past,</p>
<p>but also because of the sort of intersection</p>
<p>of novelty generation, it&rsquo;s not completely predetermined</p>
<p>by the past.</p>
<p>And so then you have the causal control</p>
<p>of the determinism part that you are your causal history</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some determinism from that past,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also room for creativity.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s actually necessary</p>
<p>that something like free will exists</p>
<p>if the universe is gonna be as creative as possible.</p>
<p>Because if I were all intelligent being,</p>
<p>inventing a universe, and I wanted it to have</p>
<p>maximum number of interesting things happen,</p>
<p>again, we should come up with the metric of interesting,</p>
<p>but generating, yes, I know,</p>
<p>generating maximal possibilities,</p>
<p>then I would want the agents to have free will</p>
<p>because it means that they&rsquo;re more individual,</p>
<p>like each entity actually is a different causal force</p>
<p>in the universe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s intrinsic and local property of that system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a greater number of distributed agents?</p>
<p>Like are you always creating more and more individuality?</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>I would say you&rsquo;re creating more causal power, but.</p>
<p>So causal power, the word consciousness,</p>
<p>is the causal power somehow correlated with consciousness?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why I have this conception</p>
<p>of consciousness being related to imagination,</p>
<p>because the more that we can imagine can happen</p>
<p>and the more counterfactual possibilities you have in mind,</p>
<p>the more you can actually implement.</p>
<p>And somehow free will is also at the intersection</p>
<p>of the counterfactual becoming the actual.</p>
<p>So can you elaborate on that a little bit,</p>
<p>that consciousness is imagination?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly how to articulate it,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure people will aim at certain things I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>but I think the language is really imprecise,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not the best way to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting, like what is imagination</p>
<p>and what role does it play in the human experience,</p>
<p>in the experience of any agent?</p>
<p>Yes, I love imagination.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like the most amazing thing we do.</p>
<p>But I guess one way I would think about it is,</p>
<p>we talked about the transition to life</p>
<p>being the universe acquiring memory,</p>
<p>and life does something really interesting.</p>
<p>You just think about biology generally.</p>
<p>It remembers states of the past to adapt</p>
<p>to things that happen in the future.</p>
<p>So the longer life has evolved on this planet,</p>
<p>the deeper that past is, the more memory we have,</p>
<p>the more kinds of organisms and things.</p>
<p>But what human level intelligence has done</p>
<p>is quite different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that we remember states</p>
<p>that the universe has existed in before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that we can imagine ones that have never existed,</p>
<p>and we can actually make them come into existence.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the most unique feature</p>
<p>about the transition to whatever we are</p>
<p>from what life on this planet has been doing</p>
<p>for the last four billion years.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s deeply related to the phenomenon</p>
<p>we call consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was gonna, I mean, just agree with that.</p>
<p>I think that consciousness is the ability</p>
<p>to generate those counterfactuals.</p>
<p>Now, whether you can say, you know,</p>
<p>are there degrees of consciousness?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sorry, panpsychist,</p>
<p>but electrons don&rsquo;t have counterfactuals,</p>
<p>although they do have some kind of,</p>
<p>they are able to search a space and pathways.</p>
<p>But I think that there is a very concrete,</p>
<p>or concrete, there&rsquo;s a very specific property</p>
<p>that humans have, and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s unique to humans.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe dogs can do it, and birds can do it, right?</p>
<p>And where they are basically solving a problem,</p>
<p>because consciousness was invented,</p>
<p>or this abstraction was invented by evolution</p>
<p>for a specific reason.</p>
<p>And so look, one of the reasons why I came to the conclusion</p>
<p>that time was fundamental was actually because</p>
<p>Sarah and I had a completely different.</p>
<p>The most heated debate on Skype chat ever.</p>
<p>No, no, no, we had to, I was like.</p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>No, no, it goes back to the free will thing.</p>
<p>So I think that, although I&rsquo;ve changed my view a bit,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some really interesting physicists</p>
<p>out there who talks about how the measurement problem</p>
<p>in Newtonian space, but I don&rsquo;t want to go there just now,</p>
<p>because I think I&rsquo;ll mess it up.</p>
<p>But briefly, I could not see how the universe,</p>
<p>how we can have free will.</p>
<p>And I mean, this is really boring,</p>
<p>because this is like, this is a well trodden path,</p>
<p>but I mean, not so boring.</p>
<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s kind of, we just want to be precise.</p>
<p>If the universe is deterministic,</p>
<p>how can we have free will, right?</p>
<p>So Sarah&rsquo;s a physicist.</p>
<p>I think she, not believe, can show that most of the laws</p>
<p>we have are deterministic to some degree.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics onto Newtonian stuff.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s Sarah telling me she believes in free will.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, your belief system&rsquo;s broken here, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re demanding free will</p>
<p>in a deterministic universe.</p>
<p>And then I realized that I agreed with her</p>
<p>that I do think that free will is a thing</p>
<p>because we are able to search for novelty.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s where I came to the conclusion</p>
<p>that time, the universe is expanding in terms of novelty.</p>
<p>And it goes back to that Dan Dennett essay</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about, the free will inflation.</p>
<p>Free will, so you have, so the past,</p>
<p>it did not exist in the past.</p>
<p>The past exists in the present.</p>
<p>What I mean is like, you are the, there was no past.</p>
<p>There is only present.</p>
<p>So that means you are the sum total.</p>
<p>Everything that&rsquo;s occurs in the past</p>
<p>is manifestly here in the present.</p>
<p>And then you have this little echo state</p>
<p>in your consciousness because you&rsquo;re able to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to imagine something without actualization.</p>
<p>But the fact you imagine it, that occurs in electrons</p>
<p>and potassium ion flows in your neural network</p>
<p>in your brain.</p>
<p>Maybe consciousness is just the present.</p>
<p>So somehow you imagine that, and then by imagining,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s good, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make a robot to do this thing and program it.</p>
<p>And then you physically then go and do it.</p>
<p>So that then changes the future, sorry.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s imagination?</p>
<p>Does it require the past?</p>
<p>Does it require the future?</p>
<p>Does it require memory?</p>
<p>Does it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p>Does it only exist in the moment?</p>
<p>So imagination is, well, yeah, probably</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an instantaneous readout of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>You can maybe, your subconscious brain</p>
<p>has been generating all the bits for it,</p>
<p>but no, imagination occurs when you,</p>
<p>in your game engine, you remember the past</p>
<p>and you integrate sensory to the present</p>
<p>and you try and work out what you want to do in the future.</p>
<p>And then you go and make that happen.</p>
<p>So the imagination is this, it&rsquo;s like, imagine,</p>
<p>asking what imagination is about, asking what surfing is.</p>
<p>You can see, you can surfboard, surfer, wave coming in.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on that wave and you&rsquo;re surfing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the imagination is.</p>
<p>I think imagination is just accessing things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t the present moment in the present moment.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;m sitting here and I&rsquo;m looking at the table</p>
<p>and I can imagine the river and things or whatever it was.</p>
<p>And so it seems to be that it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s our ability to access things that aren&rsquo;t present.</p>
<p>So conjure up worlds, some of them might be akin</p>
<p>to something that happened to you recently.</p>
<p>Right, but they don&rsquo;t have to be things</p>
<p>that actually happened in your past.</p>
<p>And I think this gets back to assembly theory.</p>
<p>Like the way I would think about imagination</p>
<p>from an assembly theoretic standpoint</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m a giant causal graph and I exist in a present moment</p>
<p>as a particular configuration of Sarah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of, I carry a lot of evolutionary baggage.</p>
<p>I have that whole causal history</p>
<p>and I can access parts of it.</p>
<p>Now, when you talk about getting to something</p>
<p>as complex as us, having as large assembly space as us,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ways of, like, there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>in that causal graph that have ever actually never existed</p>
<p>in the past history of the universe</p>
<p>because like the universe got big enough</p>
<p>to contain the three of us in this room in time,</p>
<p>but not all the features of each one of us individually</p>
<p>have come into existence as physical objects</p>
<p>we would recognize as individual objects.</p>
<p>This goes back to your point</p>
<p>that we actually have to explain</p>
<p>why things actually even look like objects</p>
<p>and aren&rsquo;t just a smear of mass.</p>
<p>And just on the free will and physics thing,</p>
<p>when you were talking, I was, I just wanna bring this up</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s a really interesting viewpoint</p>
<p>that Nicholas Jisen has that, you know,</p>
<p>like we wanna use the laws of physics</p>
<p>and then say you can&rsquo;t have free will.</p>
<p>And his point is you have to have free will</p>
<p>in order to even choose to set up an experiment</p>
<p>to test the laws of physics.</p>
<p>So in some sense, free will should be more fundamental</p>
<p>than physics is because to even do science,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some assumption that the agents have free will.</p>
<p>And I always thought it was really perplexing</p>
<p>that, you know, physics wants to remove agency</p>
<p>because the idea that I could do an experiment here</p>
<p>on this part of earth and then I can move somewhere else</p>
<p>and prepare an identically, you know,</p>
<p>identically prepared experiment, run an experiment again,</p>
<p>seems to imply something about the structure of our universe</p>
<p>that is not encoded in the laws</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re testing in those experiments.</p>
<p>So this kind of dream of physics</p>
<p>that you can do multiple experiments, different locations</p>
<p>and then validate each other,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s an illusion?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying that requires decision making</p>
<p>and free will to be a real thing, I think.</p>
<p>Like I think the fact that we can do science</p>
<p>is not arbitrary.</p>
<p>And I think people, you know,</p>
<p>the standard canon in physics would be,</p>
<p>well, you could trace all of that back</p>
<p>to the initial condition of the universe,</p>
<p>but the whole point of science is</p>
<p>I can imagine doing the experiment and I can do it</p>
<p>and then I can do it again and again and again</p>
<p>all over the planet.</p>
<p>To you, imagination is somehow fundamentally</p>
<p>generative of novelty.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like the universe could have predicted</p>
<p>the things you imagined.</p>
<p>Imagination, so coming back to novelty,</p>
<p>I think novelty can exist outside of imagination,</p>
<p>but it supercharges it, it&rsquo;s another transition, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, I would say,</p>
<p>I mean, this may be a boring statement,</p>
<p>but I would say the fact that, sorry?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, these are hard questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that objects exist</p>
<p>is yet another proof that time is fundamental</p>
<p>and novelty exists, right?</p>
<p>Because I think, again, if you ask a physicist</p>
<p>to write down in their infinite Bible of the universe,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it the Bible, the Mac, you know.</p>
<p>The book.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, the mathematical universe,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re Max Tegmark or Sean Carroll</p>
<p>or Frank Wilczek.</p>
<p>Or Stephen Wolfram, okay?</p>
<p>I like that book.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lots of pretty pictures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting that they cope with the enormity</p>
<p>of the universe by saying,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s all there, mathematics, it all exists, right?</p>
<p>And I would say that that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m excited</p>
<p>about the future of the universe</p>
<p>because although it is somehow dependent upon the past,</p>
<p>it is not constrained just by the past,</p>
<p>which is kind of mad.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what free will is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not constrained by the past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dependent on the past.</p>
<p>This moment, it&rsquo;s not just dependent,</p>
<p>this moment is the past,</p>
<p>and yet it has the capacity</p>
<p>to generate a totally unpredictable future.</p>
<p>I mean, the other thing I would say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super important for human beings, right?</p>
<p>Human beings have actually very little causal control</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>I realized this the other week.</p>
<p>Oh, the immediate future immediately.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so what happened,</p>
<p>so this is what I think it is.</p>
<p>The way, by reinterpreting your past,</p>
<p>I mean, talk about from a kind of cognitive,</p>
<p>psychological cognitive point of view,</p>
<p>by reinterpreting your past in your current mind,</p>
<p>you could actually help you shape your future again.</p>
<p>So you have much more freedom to interpret your past,</p>
<p>to act in the present, to change your future,</p>
<p>than you do to change your future.</p>
<p>It may sound weird, so I&rsquo;m saying to everybody,</p>
<p>imagine your past, think about your past,</p>
<p>reinterpret your past in the nicest way you can,</p>
<p>then imagine what you can do next,</p>
<p>or imagine your past in a more negative way</p>
<p>and what you do next,</p>
<p>and look at those two counterfactuals, they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, Daniel Kahneman talks about this</p>
<p>that most of our life is lived in our memories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, because you can essentially,</p>
<p>in imagination, choose the life you live.</p>
<p>So maybe free will exists in imagination.</p>
<p>Choices are made in your imagination,</p>
<p>and that results in you basically able to control</p>
<p>how the future unrolls, because you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>imagining, like reinterpreting constantly</p>
<p>the things that happen to you.</p>
<p>Exactly, so if you want to increase</p>
<p>your amount of free will, those people that have,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think everyone has equal amounts of agency,</p>
<p>because of our sad constraints,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re happenstance, health, economic,</p>
<p>born in a certain place, right?</p>
<p>But those of us that have the ability to go back</p>
<p>and reinterpret our past and use that to change the future</p>
<p>are the ones that exert most agency in the present,</p>
<p>and I want to achieve higher degrees of agency</p>
<p>and enable everyone else to do that as well,</p>
<p>to have more fun in the universe.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ll hit that peak, the maximum fun point.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s ever gonna be a maximum,</p>
<p>I think the wonderful thing about the future</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s always gonna be more fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, you, I think, again, going back to Twitter,</p>
<p>I think you, Lee, tweeted something</p>
<p>about being a life maximalist,</p>
<p>that you want to maximize the number of life,</p>
<p>the amount of life in the universe, so,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the more general version of that goal,</p>
<p>is to maximize the amount of fun in the universe,</p>
<p>because life is a subset of fun, there are all kinds of,</p>
<p>I suppose they&rsquo;re either correlated or exactly equal,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Anyway, speaking of fun,</p>
<p>let me ask you about alien sightings.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been quite a bit of UFO sightings</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What do you think would be the first time</p>
<p>when humans sight aliens, see aliens,</p>
<p>in a sort of unquestionable way?</p>
<p>This extremely strong and arguable way</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve made contact with aliens.</p>
<p>Sarah, what would it look like?</p>
<p>Obviously, the space of possibilities is huge here,</p>
<p>but if you were to kind of look into the future,</p>
<p>what would that look like?</p>
<p>Would it be inklings of UFOs here and there</p>
<p>that slowly unravel a mystery?</p>
<p>Or would it be like an obvious, overwhelming signal?</p>
<p>So I think we have an obsession</p>
<p>with making contact with events.</p>
<p>So what do I mean by that is,</p>
<p>like people have a UFO sighting, they make contact.</p>
<p>And I always think, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting to me about the UFO narratives right now</p>
<p>is not that I have a disbelief</p>
<p>about what people are experiencing or feeling,</p>
<p>but like the discussion right now</p>
<p>is sort of at the level of modern mythology.</p>
<p>Aliens are our mythos in modern culture.</p>
<p>And when you treat it like that,</p>
<p>then I wanna think about when do things</p>
<p>that we traditionally only regularize through mythology</p>
<p>actually become things that become standard knowledge?</p>
<p>So, you know, like it used to be, you know,</p>
<p>variations in the climate were described</p>
<p>by some kind of gods or something.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>our technology picks up an anomaly</p>
<p>or someone sees something, we say it&rsquo;s aliens.</p>
<p>And I think the real thing is it&rsquo;s not contact with events,</p>
<p>but like first contact is actually contact</p>
<p>with knowledge of the phenomenon or the explanation.</p>
<p>And so this is very subtle and very abstract,</p>
<p>but when does it become something</p>
<p>that we actually understand what it is</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s first contact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Would you make the myth,</p>
<p>would you give credit to the myth,</p>
<p>the mythology as first contact?</p>
<p>Cause you might.</p>
<p>I think, yes.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the rudimentary</p>
<p>that we have some understanding that there&rsquo;s a phenomenon</p>
<p>that we have to understand and regularize.</p>
<p>So I think.</p>
<p>Right, to understand that there is weather.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You have to construct a pathology around that weather.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s controllable.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I see mythology basically as like baby knowledge.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>It could be that, you know,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s lots of alien sight,</p>
<p>so called alien sightings, right?</p>
<p>So there is a number of things you can do.</p>
<p>You could just dismiss them and say they&rsquo;re not true.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of made up.</p>
<p>Or you say, well, there&rsquo;s something interesting here, right?</p>
<p>We keep seeing a commonality, right?</p>
<p>We see the same phenomenon again and again and again.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s this interesting thing</p>
<p>about human imagination.</p>
<p>Even if they are, let&rsquo;s not say made up,</p>
<p>but misappropriated kind of other inputs,</p>
<p>the fact that human consciousness</p>
<p>is capable of imagining a contact with aliens.</p>
<p>Does that not tell us about something</p>
<p>about where we are in our position,</p>
<p>in our culture, in our technology?</p>
<p>It tells us about where in time we are.</p>
<p>Could it be that we&rsquo;re making contact with,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that, so let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take the most miserable version.</p>
<p>There are no aliens in the universe.</p>
<p>Life is only on Earth.</p>
<p>That then, the interpretation of that</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re desperate to kind of understand</p>
<p>why we&rsquo;re the only life in the universe, right?</p>
<p>The other one is the other most extreme</p>
<p>is that aliens are visiting all the time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just not able to capture them coherently,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a big conspiracy and there&rsquo;s Area 51</p>
<p>and there are lizards everywhere and there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m kind of in favor of the idea</p>
<p>that maybe humanity is waking up to the idea</p>
<p>that we aren&rsquo;t alone in the universe</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just running the simulation</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re seeing some evidence.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what life is yet.</p>
<p>We do have some anomalies out there.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t explain everything.</p>
<p>And over time, you know, we will start to unpack that.</p>
<p>One very plausible thing we might do,</p>
<p>which might be boring for the average alien observer</p>
<p>or believes that aliens are,</p>
<p>as in intelligent aliens are visiting Earth,</p>
<p>it could be that we might go to the outer solar system</p>
<p>and find a new type of life</p>
<p>that has completely new chemistry,</p>
<p>bring these cells back to Earth,</p>
<p>where you could say in my hand,</p>
<p>on Earth, here&rsquo;s RNA, DNA, and proteins,</p>
<p>and look, cells self replicate.</p>
<p>From Titan, we got this new set of molecules,</p>
<p>new set of cells, and we feed it stuff and it grows.</p>
<p>That for me, if we were able to do that,</p>
<p>which would be like the most,</p>
<p>that would be my UFO sign.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good test.</p>
<p>So you feed it and it grows.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made, so not until you know how to feed the thing,</p>
<p>it grows somehow.</p>
<p>We can make a comic book, you know,</p>
<p>the tiger that came for tea, the alien that came for tea.</p>
<p>What would you say is between the two of you</p>
<p>is the biggest disagreement about alien life out there?</p>
<p>Is it from the basic framework of thinking about</p>
<p>what is life to maybe what aliens look like</p>
<p>to alien civilizations, to UFO sightings?</p>
<p>What would you think?</p>
<p>So I would say the biggest one is that</p>
<p>the emergence of life does not have to be,</p>
<p>that it can&rsquo;t just happen once on the planet,</p>
<p>that it could be two or more life forms</p>
<p>present on the planet at once.</p>
<p>And I think Sarah doesn&rsquo;t agree with that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s like logically inconsistent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really polite.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s nonsense.</p>
<p>Because you think that, yeah.</p>
<p>So likely is that, so the idea that,</p>
<p>what does it look like?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine two alien civilizations</p>
<p>coexisting on a planet.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that look like exactly?</p>
<p>So I would say, I think I&rsquo;ve got to get around your argument.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s say that on this planet,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just like, there&rsquo;s lots of available chemistry</p>
<p>and one life form gets some emerges based on carbon</p>
<p>and interacts and there&rsquo;s an ecosystem based on carbon.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an orthogonal, and so it&rsquo;s planetary phenomena,</p>
<p>which is what you, I think, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also one that carries on silicon.</p>
<p>And because there&rsquo;s enough energy and there&rsquo;s enough stuff,</p>
<p>that these life forms might not actually</p>
<p>necessarily compete evolutionarily.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they would have to not interact at all</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re going to be co constructing</p>
<p>each other&rsquo;s causal chains.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what you just got me, yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no overlap in terms of their causal chains</p>
<p>or a very limited overlap.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think the only way I can get away with that</p>
<p>is to say, right, life can emerge on a planet underneath.</p>
<p>And, okay.</p>
<p>The lizard people under the crust of the earth.</p>
<p>I think, I think, I think we, let&rsquo;s go to,</p>
<p>I think, but look, as you can see, we disagree.</p>
<p>So, and I think Sarah actually has convinced me</p>
<p>because of the life is a planetary,</p>
<p>the emergence of life is a planetary phenomena.</p>
<p>And actually, because of the way evolution selection works,</p>
<p>then nothing occurs in isolation.</p>
<p>The causal chains interact.</p>
<p>So there is a common, there&rsquo;s a consensus model</p>
<p>for life on the earth.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think you can place aliens from elsewhere</p>
<p>onto the, can&rsquo;t you just place multiple alien civilizations</p>
<p>on one planet?</p>
<p>Right, but I think, so you can take two origin life events</p>
<p>that were independent and co mingle them.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think when you&rsquo;re talking about, when you,</p>
<p>when you look at the interaction of that structure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the same idea as like an experiment</p>
<p>being an example of life, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really abstract and subtle concept.</p>
<p>And I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is life is information</p>
<p>propagating through matter.</p>
<p>So once you start having things interacting,</p>
<p>they in some sense co mingle and they become part</p>
<p>of the same chain.</p>
<p>So the co mingling starts quickly, proceeds,</p>
<p>we proceed to co mingle quickly.</p>
<p>Right, right, so you could say, so the question is then,</p>
<p>the more interesting question is,</p>
<p>are there two distinct origins events?</p>
<p>And I still think that there&rsquo;s reasons that</p>
<p>on a single planet, you would have one origins event</p>
<p>because of the timescales of cycling of geochemistry</p>
<p>on a planet and also the fact that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that the origin of life happens in a pool</p>
<p>and like radiates outward through evolutionary processes.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a multi scale phenomenon happens</p>
<p>at the level of individual molecules interacting,</p>
<p>collections of molecules interacting</p>
<p>and entire planetary scale cycles.</p>
<p>So life as we know it has always been multi scale</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s brilliant examples of individual mutations</p>
<p>at the genome level changing global climate, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a tight coupling between things that happen</p>
<p>at the largest scale, our planetary scale</p>
<p>and the smallest scale that life mediates.</p>
<p>But it still might be difficult within something</p>
<p>you would call as a single alien civilization.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s species and stuff.</p>
<p>And they might not be able to communicate.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re asking about life, not species, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between one living civilization?</p>
<p>This is almost like a category question.</p>
<p>Versus species, because it can be very different.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s like literally islands</p>
<p>that you can evolve different kinds of turtles and stuff.</p>
<p>And they can.</p>
<p>So I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is weird.</p>
<p>If you look at the structure</p>
<p>of two interacting living things, populations,</p>
<p>and you look in their past</p>
<p>and they have independent origins for their causal chain,</p>
<p>then you would say one was alien.</p>
<p>You know, they have different independent origins events.</p>
<p>But if you look at their future</p>
<p>by virtue of the fact they&rsquo;re interacting,</p>
<p>their causal chains have become commingled.</p>
<p>So then in the future, they are not independent.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you would even define them as alien.</p>
<p>So the structure across time is two examples of life</p>
<p>become one example of life</p>
<p>because life is the entire structure across time.</p>
<p>Right, but there could be a lot of variation within.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the question we&rsquo;re all interested in</p>
<p>is how many independent origins</p>
<p>of a complexifying causal chain are there in the universe?</p>
<p>See, but the idea of origin is easy for you to define?</p>
<p>Because like, when the species split</p>
<p>in the evolutionary process,</p>
<p>and you get like a dolphin versus a human</p>
<p>or a Neanderthal versus Homo sapiens, isn&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p>Let me make a distinction here quickly.</p>
<p>So I think, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re saying, I mean, Sarah won that argument</p>
<p>because I think she&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>that once the causal chains interact and going forward,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re talking about a number of things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go all the way back before origin of life.</p>
<p>Origin of life.</p>
<p>On Earth.</p>
<p>Chemistry emerges, so there&rsquo;s all these,</p>
<p>I would say there&rsquo;s probably mechanistically,</p>
<p>the chemistry is desperately trying to find any way</p>
<p>to get replicators.</p>
<p>The ribosome kind of was really rubbish at the beginning</p>
<p>and they just competed, competed, competed,</p>
<p>and you got better and better ribosome.</p>
<p>Suddenly that was a technology.</p>
<p>The ribosome is the technology that, boom,</p>
<p>allowed evolution to start.</p>
<p>So what I was trying to, why I interrupted you,</p>
<p>is say that once evolution has started</p>
<p>using that technology, then you can speciate.</p>
<p>And I was trying to, and I think what Sarah said</p>
<p>was, convinced me of, because I was like, no,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have lots of different chemistry,</p>
<p>shadow biosphere on Earth, and she&rsquo;s like, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You have to have this, you have to get to this</p>
<p>minimum evolutionary machine.</p>
<p>And then when that occurs, speciation occurs.</p>
<p>Exactly what it&rsquo;s like, dolphins, humans,</p>
<p>everything on Earth.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re looking at aliens or alien life,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not gonna be two different types of chemistry</p>
<p>because they compete and interact and cooperate</p>
<p>because the causal chains overlap.</p>
<p>One might kill the other, one might combine with the other,</p>
<p>and then you go on and then you have this average.</p>
<p>And sure, there might be respeciation.</p>
<p>It might have two types of emerging chemistry.</p>
<p>It almost looks like the origin of life on Earth</p>
<p>required two different prelife forms,</p>
<p>the peptide world and the RNA world.</p>
<p>Somehow they got together, and by combining,</p>
<p>you got the ribosome.</p>
<p>And that was the minimum competent entity for evolution.</p>
<p>And would all alien civilizations</p>
<p>have an evolutionary process on a planet?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost the definition of life.</p>
<p>To create all those memories, you have to have something.</p>
<p>Things have to change in time.</p>
<p>But there has to be selection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like an efficient, there&rsquo;s no other way to do it.</p>
<p>No, well, never say never, because soon as I say that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the part that depresses me, though,</p>
<p>going back to the earlier discussion on violence</p>
<p>and things, and I don&rsquo;t know where,</p>
<p>somebody was tweeting about this recently,</p>
<p>but how much death had to die.</p>
<p>Maybe it was you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ah, yeah.</p>
<p>So, yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I guess a lot of murder had to occur.</p>
<p>Right, so selection means things had to be weeded out,</p>
<p>right, so.</p>
<p>Well, we can celebrate that.</p>
<p>Death makes way for a tulip.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, and also one of the most interesting features</p>
<p>of major extinction events in the history of our planet</p>
<p>is how much novelty emerged immediately after, right?</p>
<p>So, and of course, a lot of people make arguments</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t be here if the dinosaurs didn&rsquo;t go extinct.</p>
<p>So, in some ways, we can attribute our existence</p>
<p>to all of that.</p>
<p>But I guess I was just wondering and sort of like,</p>
<p>if I was gonna build a universe myself</p>
<p>in the most optimistic way, would I retain that feature?</p>
<p>But it does seem to be a universe.</p>
<p>I think you have to.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re probably being</p>
<p>over anthropomorphizing.</p>
<p>I remember watching the blue,</p>
<p>I think it was the blue planet,</p>
<p>David Attenborough was showing these seals</p>
<p>and because of climate change,</p>
<p>some seals were falling off a cliff.</p>
<p>And how tragic that was.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m saying my son, that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>Look at those ones down there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve obviously got some kind of mutations,</p>
<p>some and they&rsquo;re not doing that Darth thing.</p>
<p>And so that poor gene will be weeded out.</p>
<p>Of course, at the individual level, it looks tragic.</p>
<p>And of course, as human beings have the ability</p>
<p>to abstract and we empathize,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t wanna cause suffering on other human beings</p>
<p>and we should retain that.</p>
<p>But we shouldn&rsquo;t look back in time</p>
<p>and say, how many butterflies had to die?</p>
<p>I remember making this,</p>
<p>how many, if you think about the caterpillar</p>
<p>become the chrysalis and then the butterfly getting out,</p>
<p>how many, if that suffering, we call it suffering,</p>
<p>if that process of pruning had not occurred,</p>
<p>we have no butterflies.</p>
<p>So none of the butterfly beauty in the world</p>
<p>without all that pruning.</p>
<p>So pruning is required,</p>
<p>but we shouldn&rsquo;t anthropomorphize</p>
<p>and feel sorry for the biological entities,</p>
<p>because that seems to be a backwards way of looking at it.</p>
<p>What we should do is project forward</p>
<p>and maybe think about what values we have across our species</p>
<p>and our ecosystem and our fellow human beings.</p>
<p>You know, now that we know that animals suffer</p>
<p>at some level, think about humane farming.</p>
<p>When we find that plants can, in fact,</p>
<p>are conscious and can think and have pain,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll do humane gardening.</p>
<p>Until that point, we won&rsquo;t do it, right?</p>
<p>I like this.</p>
<p>Famous chemist endorses the majestic nature of murder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the title.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that, but any case.</p>
<p>Well, I just inserted it.</p>
<p>I have a hard time with it, though.</p>
<p>I think the way you put it is kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the reality of, it is beautiful.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s an Instagram account</p>
<p>called natureismetal,</p>
<p>and I keep following it and unfollowing it</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t handle it for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>We evolve together, you die alone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We evolve together, but you die alone.</p>
<p>We live alone, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Gatsby thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We evolve together.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the together?</p>
<p>The together is the murder and the sex, sex and murder.</p>
<p>My romantic vision of it is to try to make me happy, Sarah,</p>
<p>instead of sad Sarah.</p>
<p>I talk in third person when I think very abstractly.</p>
<p>Sorry, is, you know, like this whole,</p>
<p>like certain things can coexist,</p>
<p>so the universe is trying to maximize existence,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some things</p>
<p>that just aren&rsquo;t the most productive trajectory together,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that they don&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>on another timeline or another chain somewhere else.</p>
<p>Like, and maybe you would call that, like,</p>
<p>then some kind of multiverse or things,</p>
<p>but what am I saying?</p>
<p>I think you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I just, you can&rsquo;t go down a level.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just making stuff up.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>It makes me feel better.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Is it logical?</p>
<p>And we need, we need.</p>
<p>No, I know, I know.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you look at bacteria, if you look at virus,</p>
<p>I mean, just the number of organisms that are constantly,</p>
<p>like looking at bacteria, they&rsquo;re just dying nonstop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a slaughter.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Well, and this goes back to the conversation about God.</p>
<p>I mean, like, there&rsquo;s the whole thing about, like,</p>
<p>why is the universe unable to suffering?</p>
<p>Individuals don&rsquo;t exist, right?</p>
<p>Individuals, so for this, I think,</p>
<p>if you think about life as an entity on Earth, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just, let&rsquo;s just go back a second.</p>
<p>I mean, I like to, I&rsquo;ll be ludicrous for a second.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t exist, right?</p>
<p>But you, but the actions you do,</p>
<p>the product of evolution exists, right?</p>
<p>The objects you create exist quantitatively</p>
<p>in the real world.</p>
<p>If you then understand life on Earth or alien life</p>
<p>or any life in the universe as this integrated entity</p>
<p>where you need, you need cells in your body to die.</p>
<p>Otherwise you&rsquo;d just get really big</p>
<p>and you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to walk around, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, you do.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So, so I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the patterns that persist, not the physical things.</p>
<p>And of course, we, you know, we have, we have,</p>
<p>we place immense values on fellow human beings</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m, majestic professor does like</p>
<p>other individual human beings.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re talking in third person too.</p>
<p>I know, it happens, right?</p>
<p>So death, would you say, I mean,</p>
<p>because you said evolution is a fundamental part of life.</p>
<p>So death is a fundamental part of life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It might, right now, it might not be in the future.</p>
<p>We might hack some aspects of death</p>
<p>because, and we&rsquo;ll evolve in different ways.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t there, I think Sarah mentioned</p>
<p>like this life density.</p>
<p>Is it, can&rsquo;t that become a problem?</p>
<p>Like too much, too much bureaucracy,</p>
<p>too much baggage builds up.</p>
<p>Like you need to keep erasing stuff.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s okay that we dissipate.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think of it like, like, I mean.</p>
<p>Dissipate, yes.</p>
<p>No, but I mean, like, like we&rsquo;re so fixated</p>
<p>on ourselves as individuals and agents.</p>
<p>And we were talking about this last night,</p>
<p>actually over dinner, but like,</p>
<p>you know, an individual persists</p>
<p>for a certain amount of time,</p>
<p>but what you want to do,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re really concerned with immortality</p>
<p>is not to live indefinitely as an individual,</p>
<p>but maximize your causal impact.</p>
<p>So like, what are the traces of you that are left?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re still a real, I always think of Einstein,</p>
<p>like for a period of time, he was a real physical thing</p>
<p>we would identify as a human.</p>
<p>And now we just see echoes of that human</p>
<p>in all of the ways that we talk about his,</p>
<p>you know, causal impact are frankly great</p>
<p>is another great example.</p>
<p>How many Easter eggs could you leave in the future?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, I got you.</p>
<p>So I guess the question is,</p>
<p>how much do you want to control the localization</p>
<p>of certain features of say a prop,</p>
<p>a packet of propagating information we might call person</p>
<p>and keep them localized</p>
<p>to one individual physical structure?</p>
<p>Or do you want to, you know,</p>
<p>is there a time when that just becomes a dissipated feature</p>
<p>of the society that it once existed in?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m okay with the dissipated feature</p>
<p>because I just think that makes more room</p>
<p>for more creativity in the future.</p>
<p>So you mentioned engineering life in the lab.</p>
<p>Let me take you to computer science world.</p>
<p>What about robots?</p>
<p>So is it possible to engineer,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re really talking about like engineering life</p>
<p>at the chemistry level,</p>
<p>but do you think it&rsquo;s possible to engineer a life</p>
<p>at the like humanoid level, at the dog level?</p>
<p>Like, or is that, like at which level can we instill</p>
<p>the magic of life into inanimate stuff?</p>
<p>No, I think you could do it at every level.</p>
<p>I just think that we&rsquo;re particularly interested</p>
<p>in chemistry because it&rsquo;s the origin of life transition</p>
<p>that presumably, or at least that&rsquo;s how I feel about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to give you the most interesting</p>
<p>or deepest insights into the physics.</p>
<p>But presumably everything that we do and build</p>
<p>is an example of life.</p>
<p>And the question is just how much do you want to take</p>
<p>from things that we have now and put them into,</p>
<p>like examples of life and copy them into machines?</p>
<p>I saw that there was this tweet again.</p>
<p>I think you were at the Mars conference</p>
<p>and you were hanging out with a humanoid robot.</p>
<p>Yes, that was a fun time.</p>
<p>Making lots of new friends at Mars 2020.</p>
<p>Did you guys color match ahead of time with the robot</p>
<p>or did that accidentally happen?</p>
<p>Accidentally, I went up and I wanted to say hi.</p>
<p>Torpoise, would that be the correct name for the color?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t color coordinate our outfits.</p>
<p>Well, you didn&rsquo;t, maybe the robot did.</p>
<p>The robot probably did, much more stylish.</p>
<p>So for people who are just listening,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a picture of Sarah standing next</p>
<p>to a humanoid robot.</p>
<p>I guess you like them with a small head and perfect vision.</p>
<p>Actually, no, I just.</p>
<p>What did they perfectly, there&rsquo;s a LIDAR.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think I was just deeply interested</p>
<p>because.</p>
<p>What was, sorry to interrupt, was it manual control?</p>
<p>Was it actually stabilizing itself?</p>
<p>Oh no, it was walking around.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>It was pretty impressive.</p>
<p>I mean, actually there&rsquo;s some videos online</p>
<p>of Jeff Bezos walking with one of those</p>
<p>across the lawn nearby there.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t invited.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there you go.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, you look at the walking robot.</p>
<p>Where did the idea for walking come from?</p>
<p>It was invented by evolution, right?</p>
<p>And us as human beings, able to conceptualize and design</p>
<p>and engineer the causal change.</p>
<p>So that robot is evidence of life.</p>
<p>And so I think what&rsquo;s going to happen is there&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>we want to find where the spark comes from mechanistically.</p>
<p>How can you literally go from sand to cells?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first transition that I think,</p>
<p>there are a number of problems we want to do.</p>
<p>Make life in the lab.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Then we want to make life in the lab</p>
<p>and want to suddenly start to make intelligent life</p>
<p>or life that can solve, start to solve abstract problems.</p>
<p>And then we want to make life that is conscious.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>In that order?</p>
<p>I think it has to happen in that order.</p>
<p>Getting towards this artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>I think that artificial general intelligence</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum.</p>
<p>It has to have a causal change</p>
<p>all the way back to Luca, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so the question I think,</p>
<p>I really like the question is to say,</p>
<p>what are we, how is,</p>
<p>how is our pursuit of more and more lifelike?</p>
<p>I know you want to, you like your robots.</p>
<p>You want to project into them.</p>
<p>You want to interact with them.</p>
<p>I think you would want,</p>
<p>if you have a robot dog and the robot dog</p>
<p>does everything expected of a normal dog</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t tell the difference,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really going to ask the question anymore.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a real dog or not,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve got a personality, you&rsquo;re interacting with it.</p>
<p>And so I think what would be interesting</p>
<p>would be to kind of understand</p>
<p>the computational architecture, how that evolves.</p>
<p>Cause you could then, you know,</p>
<p>teleport the personality from one object to the other</p>
<p>and say, right, does it act the same?</p>
<p>And I think that as we go along,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to get better and better</p>
<p>at integrating our consciousness into machines.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you that question just to link on it.</p>
<p>I would, I would call that a living conscious thing</p>
<p>potentially, I as a human allegedly,</p>
<p>but would you, as a person trying to define life,</p>
<p>if you pass the Turing test, are you a life form?</p>
<p>One of the reasons I walked up to the robot</p>
<p>was because I wanted to meet the robot, right?</p>
<p>So I, it felt like I was,</p>
<p>and I abase a lot of my interaction with reality</p>
<p>on emotion and feeling,</p>
<p>but like how do you feel about an interaction?</p>
<p>And I always love your point about like,</p>
<p>is it enough to have that shared experience</p>
<p>with a robot, right?</p>
<p>So walking up to it,</p>
<p>does it feel like you&rsquo;re interacting with a living thing?</p>
<p>And it did to an extent, but in some degrees,</p>
<p>it feels like you&rsquo;re interacting with a baby living thing.</p>
<p>So I think our relationship with technology</p>
<p>and particularly robots we build is really interesting</p>
<p>because basically they exist as objects in our future</p>
<p>in some sense, like we&rsquo;re a much older evolutionary lineage</p>
<p>than robots are, but we&rsquo;re all part of the same causal chain</p>
<p>and presumably, you know, they&rsquo;re kind of in their infancy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re looking at the future of life</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking at them,</p>
<p>but it hasn&rsquo;t really become life in a full manifestation</p>
<p>of whatever it is that they&rsquo;re gonna become.</p>
<p>And, you know, the example of the walking robot</p>
<p>was super interesting, but they also had a dolphin</p>
<p>that they put in the pool at the cocktail party at Mars,</p>
<p>and it looked just like a real dolphin swimming in the pool.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s in this kind of uncanny valley</p>
<p>because, and I was having this conversation</p>
<p>with a gentleman named Mutu who was super perceptive,</p>
<p>but he was basically saying like,</p>
<p>it made him feel really uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And I think.</p>
<p>The dolphin.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think a lot of people would have that response.</p>
<p>And I guess my point about it is it is kind of interesting</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re basically trying to make a thing</p>
<p>that you think is nonliving mimic a living thing.</p>
<p>And so the thought experiment I would wanna run in that case</p>
<p>is imagine we replaced every living thing on earth</p>
<p>with a robot equivalent, like all the dolphins and things.</p>
<p>And in some sense, then you&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>if you think that the robots aren&rsquo;t experiencing reality,</p>
<p>for example, in the way that</p>
<p>a biologically evolved thing would,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically making the philosophical zombie argument</p>
<p>become real and basically building reality into a simulation</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve made everything quote unquote fake</p>
<p>in some sense.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve replaced everything with a physical simulation of it.</p>
<p>So as opposed to being excited by the possibility</p>
<p>of creating something new,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re terrified of humans being replaced.</p>
<p>I was just trying to run like what would be</p>
<p>the absolute thought experiment.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that scenario would actually play out.</p>
<p>I guess what I think is weird for why we feel</p>
<p>this kind of uncanny valley interacting</p>
<p>with something like the robot dolphin</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re looking at an object we know is kind of</p>
<p>in the future in the sense of like</p>
<p>if everything&rsquo;s ordered in time,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s borrowing from a structure</p>
<p>that we have common history with,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically copying in a kind of superficial way</p>
<p>things from one part of the causal chain to another.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a video of&hellip;</p>
<p>Everybody believed it was real.</p>
<p>They look so real.</p>
<p>And obviously the technology was developed for movies, so.</p>
<p>Well, I think we&rsquo;re confusing our emotional response</p>
<p>and understanding the causal chain</p>
<p>of how we got there, right?</p>
<p>Because the philosophical dot zombie argument</p>
<p>thinks about objects just appearing, right,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re facsimile in some way,</p>
<p>whereas there is the causal, the chain of events</p>
<p>that caused the dolphin to be built went for a human being.</p>
<p>Yeah, would a philosophical zombie</p>
<p>still have a high assembly index?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because it can&rsquo;t be, philosophical zombies can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>like Boltzmann brains, just can&rsquo;t appear out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Well, I guess my question would be in that scenario</p>
<p>where you built all the robots</p>
<p>and replaced everything on Earth with robots,</p>
<p>would the biosphere be as creative</p>
<p>under that scenario or not?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Are there quantitative differences</p>
<p>you would notice over time?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not obvious either way, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious right now,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t really, we don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t built into machines how we work.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think, one of the big missing things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re both looking for, right?</p>
<p>This is a robot, it&rsquo;s a cute robot.</p>
<p>But the point, Sarah, is that the biosphere</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be as creative if you did it right now.</p>
<p>No, of course, I think that&rsquo;s why people don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>But in the future, we will be able to solve the problem</p>
<p>of origin of life, intelligence, and consciousness</p>
<p>because they exist in physical substrates.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t understand enough</p>
<p>about the material substrate and the causal chain.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m very confident we will get to an AGI,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t be what people think.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be, solution won&rsquo;t be a, we&rsquo;ll get fooled a lot.</p>
<p>And so GPT3 is getting better at fooling us</p>
<p>and GPT153 might really fool us,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t have the magic we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be a creative,</p>
<p>but it will help us understand the differences between.</p>
<p>Really though, because isn&rsquo;t that what love is, being fooled?</p>
<p>Like what, why are you not giving much value</p>
<p>to the emotional connection with objects,</p>
<p>with robots, with humans?</p>
<p>Emotion is a thing which happens</p>
<p>when your expectation function is dashed</p>
<p>and something else happens, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what emotion is.</p>
<p>Is that what love is too?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You were expecting one thing and something else happened.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true either.</p>
<p>Well, what is it then?</p>
<p>I think, no, emotion, look, I&rsquo;m sorry, emotion is that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no more.</p>
<p>No, I think love is just fulfilling your purpose.</p>
<p>No, but, okay, I mean, look, look.</p>
<p>Like whatever that means.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opposite of what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>I mean, really?</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>I think the happiest is like when you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>All right, all right, all right.</p>
<p>Let me go back.</p>
<p>If you want me to define.</p>
<p>Follow your bliss.</p>
<p>Let me define love quickly.</p>
<p>Okay, go for it.</p>
<p>In terms of assembly space, right?</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be doing this today.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait till Assembly Theory 101 is taught</p>
<p>and the second lecture is Assembly Theory of Love.</p>
<p>No, no, but look, actually, but look, but.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being surprised.</p>
<p>The expectation is being broken.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>No, go for it.</p>
<p>I wanna hear you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an emotional being, but I would say,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s talk, so we&rsquo;ll talk about emotion a bit,</p>
<p>but love is more complex.</p>
<p>Love is a very complex set of emotions together</p>
<p>and logical stuff, but if you&rsquo;ve got this thing,</p>
<p>this person that&rsquo;s on this causal chain</p>
<p>that has this empathy for this other thing,</p>
<p>love is being able to project ahead in your assembly space</p>
<p>and work out what you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>the person you&rsquo;re in love with has a need for</p>
<p>and to do that for them without selflessly, right?</p>
<p>Cause you can project ahead what they&rsquo;re gonna need</p>
<p>and they are there and maybe you can see</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s gonna fall over</p>
<p>and you catch them before they fall over</p>
<p>or maybe you can anticipate that someone&rsquo;s gonna be hungry</p>
<p>and without helping you, you just help them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what love is.</p>
<p>That just sounds like empathy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more complex than that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more complex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about not just empathy, it&rsquo;s understanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about kind of sharing that experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an expression of love though.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s like to feel love.</p>
<p>Like feeling love is like,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re aligned with things</p>
<p>that you feel like are your purpose</p>
<p>or your reason for existing.</p>
<p>So if you have those feelings towards a robot,</p>
<p>why is that robot?</p>
<p>I mean, cause you said like the AGI,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll build an AGI,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ll be a fundamental difference in AGI.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll build it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna emerge from our technology.</p>
<p>I think you guys all argue the same thing.</p>
<p>I just said that GPT,</p>
<p>we do not correctly capture the causal chain that we have.</p>
<p>Within GPT.</p>
<p>Yeah, within AI.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think it captures,</p>
<p>because GPT3 is fundamentally trained</p>
<p>on a corpus of knowledge,</p>
<p>like the internet.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think it gets better and better and better</p>
<p>at capturing the memory of all the&hellip;</p>
<p>It will be better at fooling you.</p>
<p>And at some point you won&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>But when it comes to,</p>
<p>my guess, this is a quick,</p>
<p>this is what I was getting to right before we got,</p>
<p>I got in the love trap.</p>
<p>Love trap, yeah.</p>
<p>It was like Lee Cronin in the love trap.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good fan name.</p>
<p>SAD, okay, SAD, assembly space of SAD.</p>
<p>No, is that, so sure.</p>
<p>But I think there are other features</p>
<p>that allow that we pull on innovation</p>
<p>that allow us to do more than what we just see in GPT3.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re being fooled there.</p>
<p>So I think what I mean is human beings have this ability</p>
<p>to be surprising and creative.</p>
<p>Whereas is it Dali, this thing,</p>
<p>or if you take GPT3 is not gonna create a new verb.</p>
<p>Shakespeare created new verbs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, wow.</p>
<p>And that required Shakespeare to think outside of language</p>
<p>in a different domain.</p>
<p>So I think having that connections across multiple domains</p>
<p>is what you need for AGI.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t know if you need,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s any limitations to GPT</p>
<p>and not being able to be across domain.</p>
<p>The number one problem is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s instantiated in a resource limited substrate</p>
<p>and that we don&rsquo;t, in silicon.</p>
<p>The architectures used for training, for learning</p>
<p>is about fooling, it&rsquo;s not about understanding.</p>
<p>And I think that there is some understanding that we have</p>
<p>that is not yet symbolically representable.</p>
<p>Language, learning language and using language</p>
<p>seems to be fundamentally about fooling, not understanding.</p>
<p>Why do you use language exactly?</p>
<p>I might disagree with that quite fundamentally actually,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure I understand</p>
<p>how I make a coherent argument for that.</p>
<p>But my feeling is that there is comprehension in reality</p>
<p>in our consciousness below language.</p>
<p>And we use those for language,</p>
<p>for all sorts of expressions.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t yet understand that there&rsquo;s a gap.</p>
<p>We will get there, but I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be interesting, it&rsquo;s a bit like saying,</p>
<p>could I facsimile you or Sarah into a new human being?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just say, I could copy all your atoms</p>
<p>and the positions of all your atoms and electrons</p>
<p>into this other person, they would be you.</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite easy to show using assembly theory</p>
<p>because actually the feature space that you have,</p>
<p>that graph, the only way to copy you</p>
<p>is to create you on that graph.</p>
<p>So everything that&rsquo;s happened to you in your past,</p>
<p>we have to have a faithful record for.</p>
<p>If you want another copy of Lex,</p>
<p>you have to do the exact thing.</p>
<p>Want another copy of Sarah, want another copy of Lee.</p>
<p>The exact past has to be replicated.</p>
<p>Let me push back on that a little bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s maybe from an assembly theory perspective,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that difficult</p>
<p>to recreate a version of me, like a clone,</p>
<p>that would make everybody exactly equally as happy.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t care which one.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s two of me and then they get to pick which one</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll kill either one, they&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>As long as they&rsquo;re forced to kill.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what will happen is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we make artificial Lex</p>
<p>and it was like, wow, so cool.</p>
<p>It looks the same interact.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;ll be this battle of like,</p>
<p>right, we&rsquo;re going to tell the difference.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to basically keep nudging Lex</p>
<p>and artificial Lex until we get novelty from one</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll kill the other one.</p>
<p>And I think, thank God.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not, novelty is a fuzzy concept.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole problem of novelty.</p>
<p>So I will define novelty, it&rsquo;s not fuzzy.</p>
<p>Novelty is the ability for you to create architectures</p>
<p>that are, or create an architecture.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve got a corpus of architectures known.</p>
<p>You can write down, you&rsquo;ve got some distance measure.</p>
<p>And then I create a new one and the distance measure</p>
<p>so far away from what you&rsquo;d expected.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no linear algebra going to get there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that is creativity.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know how to do that yet on any level.</p>
<p>Well, I was also thinking about like your argument</p>
<p>about free will, like you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to know</p>
<p>it was, it doesn&rsquo;t work instantaneously.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a micro level thing,</p>
<p>but more a macro level thing over the scale of trajectories</p>
<p>or longer term decisions.</p>
<p>So if you think that the novelty manifests</p>
<p>over those longer timescales,</p>
<p>it might be the two Lexes diverge quite a bit</p>
<p>over certain timescales of their behavior.</p>
<p>But nobody would notice the difference.</p>
<p>They might not.</p>
<p>And the universe, the earth won&rsquo;t notice the difference.</p>
<p>The universe won&rsquo;t notice the difference.</p>
<p>The universe would notice the difference.</p>
<p>No, the universe doesn&rsquo;t know about its novelty</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being generated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point of novelty.</p>
<p>Yeah, but this is what selection is, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like taking nearly equivalent ones</p>
<p>and then deciding like the universe selects, right?</p>
<p>So whatever selection is,</p>
<p>select some things to persist in time.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna select the artificial one</p>
<p>just because it likes that one better.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re mixing up two arguments here.</p>
<p>So look, let&rsquo;s go back a second.</p>
<p>What are you basing this argument on, Lex?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that I kind of don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>cause at least said that it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>Like if you copy every single molecule in a person&rsquo;s body,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to be the same person.</p>
<p>That they won&rsquo;t have the same assembly index.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be the same person.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t, I think copying, you can compress.</p>
<p>Not only do I disagree with that,</p>
<p>I just, I think you can even compress a person down</p>
<p>to some where you can fool the universe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, let me restate it.</p>
<p>It is not possible to copy somebody on,</p>
<p>because you, unless you copy the causal history.</p>
<p>Also, you can&rsquo;t have two identical.</p>
<p>I mean, actually I really like the idea</p>
<p>that everything in the universe is unique.</p>
<p>So even if like there were two Lex&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I know you like that idea</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re human and you think you&rsquo;re unique.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But also I can make a logical argument for it</p>
<p>that even if we could copy all of your molecules</p>
<p>and all their positions, the other you would be there.</p>
<p>And you have a different position in space.</p>
<p>And the other thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re distinguishable.</p>
<p>Yeah, the other thing I was gonna add.</p>
<p>How unique are you?</p>
<p>Just by the position in space really.</p>
<p>Sure, but then how much does that light translation</p>
<p>of Lex sitting there affect the future?</p>
<p>I see, but wait a minute.</p>
<p>Is part of the definition of something being interesting</p>
<p>is how much it affects the future?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But let me come back.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you agree?</p>
<p>Do you disagree?</p>
<p>But let me come back one point quickly</p>
<p>that you were making.</p>
<p>Sure, I think I probably agree, yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two Lex&rsquo;s, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a robot Lex that you just basically,</p>
<p>it is a charade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a facsimile.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just coded to emulate you.</p>
<p>Are you robot Lex?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get that.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s get that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very important point here</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s ducking and diving between this eye.</p>
<p>So if I facsimile you into a robot,</p>
<p>then your robot might be,</p>
<p>would be a representation of you now,</p>
<p>but fundamentally be boring</p>
<p>because you go and have other ideas.</p>
<p>If, however, you built an architecture</p>
<p>that itself is capable of generating novelty,</p>
<p>you would diverge in your causal chain</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d both be equally interesting to interact with.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that mechanism.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m trying to say is we don&rsquo;t yet know that mechanism.</p>
<p>We do not know the mechanism that generates novelty.</p>
<p>And at the moment in our AIs, we are emulating,</p>
<p>we are not generating.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re sneaking up on that?</p>
<p>No, no, there is no ghost in the machine.</p>
<p>And I want there to be one.</p>
<p>I want the same thing you want.</p>
<p>Sorry, I was.</p>
<p>I know you want that as a human</p>
<p>because everything you just said</p>
<p>makes you feel more special.</p>
<p>I want to be, no, no, no, screw my specialness.</p>
<p>I just want to be surprised.</p>
<p>If I.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think a robot can surprise you.</p>
<p>If I, if you can produce an algorithm</p>
<p>instantiated in a robot to surprise me,</p>
<p>I will, I will, I will, I will,</p>
<p>I will have one of those robots, it&rsquo;ll be brilliant.</p>
<p>But they won&rsquo;t, it won&rsquo;t surprise me.</p>
<p>But why, why is it a problem</p>
<p>to think that humans are special?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not the special, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the better than.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because then you start to not recognize</p>
<p>the magic in other life forms</p>
<p>that you either have created or you have observed.</p>
<p>Because I just think there is magic</p>
<p>in legged robots moving about.</p>
<p>And they are full of surprises.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is.</p>
<p>And functionality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a little.</p>
<p>I know why you like cellular automata, right?</p>
<p>But the specialness in your robot</p>
<p>comes from the roboticist that built it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the lineage.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I felt like looking at the standing robot</p>
<p>was I was looking at four billion years of evolution.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right.</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I think I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m happy we&rsquo;re gonna coexist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying you&rsquo;re gonna get more excitement.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something missing</p>
<p>in our understanding of intelligence.</p>
<p>Intelligence isn&rsquo;t just training.</p>
<p>The way the neural network is conceived right now is great</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s lovely and it&rsquo;ll be better</p>
<p>and we will argue forever.</p>
<p>But you want to know, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if I said,</p>
<p>look, I know how to invent an architecture</p>
<p>and I can give it a soul.</p>
<p>And what I mean by a soul is some,</p>
<p>I know for real that there is internal reference.</p>
<p>Soon as I not fake internal reference.</p>
<p>And if we could generate that mechanism</p>
<p>for internal reference, that&rsquo;s why our goal direct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you have to develop a test for goal directness.</p>
<p>Get that goal directness.</p>
<p>You would love that robot more than the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just made to look like it does</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll have more fun with it</p>
<p>because you better generate search, other problems,</p>
<p>get to more novelty.</p>
<p>Hell, you&rsquo;d be able to fall in love with that robot for real,</p>
<p>but not the one that&rsquo;s faking it.</p>
<p>What about fake it till you make it?</p>
<p>Well, I think a lot of people fall in love with fake humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to fall in love with something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s full of novelty, yes.</p>
<p>I could imagine all kinds of robots</p>
<p>that I would want to have a close relationship with.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean like sexual, I mean like intimacy.</p>
<p>But I just don&rsquo;t think that novelty generation</p>
<p>is such a special.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s like mathematical novelty</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s just humans being surprised.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re easily surprised.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine, but that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good definition of novelty?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to be surprised,</p>
<p>but not globally surprised because someone else,</p>
<p>but I really want, I was wondering why I&rsquo;m a scientist.</p>
<p>I really want to be the first to be surprised about something</p>
<p>and the first thing in the universe</p>
<p>to create that novelty</p>
<p>and to know for sure that that novelty</p>
<p>has never occurred anywhere else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real buzz, right?</p>
<p>Is there a way to really know that?</p>
<p>You have to have a really big lookup table.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re never going to be know for sure, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the hard things about being</p>
<p>a scientist searching for this type of novelty.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why mathematics, mathematicians love discovery,</p>
<p>but actually they are creating.</p>
<p>And then when they create a new mathematical structure</p>
<p>that they can then, you can write code to work out</p>
<p>whether that structure exists before that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost why I would love to have been a mathematician</p>
<p>from that regard to invent new math</p>
<p>that really I know pretty much for sure</p>
<p>does not exist anywhere else in the universe</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so contingent.</p>
<p>Right, but this gets into like you said a few times</p>
<p>that I still really don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>how you actually plan to do this,</p>
<p>to build an experiment that detects</p>
<p>how the universe is generating novelty</p>
<p>or that time is the mechanism.</p>
<p>So the problem that we all have,</p>
<p>which I think is what Lex is pushing against</p>
<p>is if I build the experiment,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what you put into it.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t know what, like if you,</p>
<p>unless you can quantify everything you put in,</p>
<p>all of your agency, all the boundary conditions,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know if you somehow biased it in some way.</p>
<p>So is the novelty actually intrinsic to that experiment</p>
<p>or to that robot, or is it something you gave it,</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t realize you gave it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be, it&rsquo;s gonna asymptote towards that, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna know for sure,</p>
<p>but you can start to take out,</p>
<p>you can use good Bayesian approaches</p>
<p>and just keep updating and updating and updating</p>
<p>until you point to one sense of purpose.</p>
<p>So you wanna bound on how much novelty generation</p>
<p>it could be, got it.</p>
<p>So the ability to generate novelty</p>
<p>is correlated with high assembly index,</p>
<p>with assembly index?</p>
<p>Yeah, and yeah.</p>
<p>Cause the space of possibilities is bigger.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>This could be a good, so I have a running joke</p>
<p>of like why Lex is single.</p>
<p>This could be a good part four.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re looking for in a robot partner</p>
<p>is ability to generate novelty.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I suppose you would say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good definition of intelligence too.</p>
<p>Boy, is novelty a fuzzy concept.</p>
<p>Is creativity better?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s all pretty fuzzy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the same.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why aliens haven&rsquo;t come yet</p>
<p>is cause we&rsquo;re not creating enough novelty.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s some kind of a hierarchy</p>
<p>of novelty in the universe.</p>
<p>Well, I think novelty is like things surprise you, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very passive thing,</p>
<p>but I guess what I meant by saying creativity</p>
<p>is I think it&rsquo;s much more active.</p>
<p>Like you think there&rsquo;s like a mechanism</p>
<p>of like the things that exist are generating the creativity.</p>
<p>Novelty seems to be there&rsquo;s some spontaneousness</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s completely decoupled from the things that exist.</p>
<p>No, I understand.</p>
<p>I think creativity is the mechanism</p>
<p>and novelty is the observable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Novelty could just be surprising.</p>
<p>Your model of the world was broken</p>
<p>and not necessarily in a positive way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s surprise.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s three things now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>You got surprise, which is basically,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m surprised all the time</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t read very much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty dumb.</p>
<p>I was like, oh wow, this is,</p>
<p>I often used to invent new scientific, you know, ideas.</p>
<p>And I was really surprised by that.</p>
<p>And then I went and looked in literature properly</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So surprise, that&rsquo;s to the extent</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have full information.</p>
<p>Creativity, the act of pushing on that kind of</p>
<p>on the causal structure and novelty,</p>
<p>which is measuring that degree, right?</p>
<p>So, and I think that&rsquo;s pretty well defined in that regard.</p>
<p>So you want your robot, I mean,</p>
<p>and in the end, this is what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>and in the end, that&rsquo;s why actually the way the internet</p>
<p>and the printing press share some,</p>
<p>I actually think creativity has dropped a bit</p>
<p>since the internet because everyone&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>just regurgitating stuff.</p>
<p>But of course, now it&rsquo;s beginning to accelerate again</p>
<p>cause everyone&rsquo;s using this tool to be creative</p>
<p>and boom, it&rsquo;s exploding.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what happens</p>
<p>when you create these new technologies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really helpful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between novelty and surprise.</p>
<p>Okay, I think I was thinking about surprise.</p>
<p>If you give me a toy that surprises me for a bit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>A robot that surprises me, you know.</p>
<p>An experiment that surprises you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s why I love doing experiments</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah. Surprise is exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Even negative surprise,</p>
<p>like some people love drama in relationships.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, why the hell, why&rsquo;d you do this?</p>
<p>That could be exciting too.</p>
<p>I could imagine companies selling updates</p>
<p>to their companion robots</p>
<p>that just basically generate negative surprise</p>
<p>just to spice things up a bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the push and pull.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the components of love.</p>
<p>As you said, love is a complicated thing.</p>
<p>Oh, beauty.</p>
<p>I wanted to mention this cause you also tweeted,</p>
<p>I think this was Sarah.</p>
<p>No, it might&rsquo;ve been Lee.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>But it was a survey published in Nature</p>
<p>showing that scientists find.</p>
<p>That was me, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&rsquo;s a plot.</p>
<p>This is published in Nature</p>
<p>of what scientists find beautiful in their work</p>
<p>and it separates biologists and physicists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice if you showed the full plot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s simplicity, elegance, hidden order,</p>
<p>inner logic of systems, symmetry, complexity, harmony,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Is there any interesting things that stand out to you?</p>
<p>I think the fact that biologists like complexity</p>
<p>and pleasing colors.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s pleasing colors on there?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Or shapes.</p>
<p>Pleasing colors or shapes.</p>
<p>And then physicists obviously love simplicity</p>
<p>above all else.</p>
<p>Simplicity and elegance.</p>
<p>Simplicity, elegance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They love symmetry.</p>
<p>And then biologists love complexity.</p>
<p>And, well, they just love a little bit less.</p>
<p>They love everything a little bit less,</p>
<p>but complexity a little bit more.</p>
<p>A little bit more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>And pleasing colors or shapes.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a useful,</p>
<p>I forget what your tweet was</p>
<p>that this is missing some of the something.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I think it&rsquo;s because I think about</p>
<p>how explanations become causal to our future.</p>
<p>So I have this whole philosophy</p>
<p>that the theories we build</p>
<p>and the way we describe reality</p>
<p>should have the largest breadth of possibilities</p>
<p>for the future of what we can accomplish.</p>
<p>So in some sense, it&rsquo;s not like Occam&rsquo;s razor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for simplicity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for optimism or the kind of future you can build.</p>
<p>And so I think you have to think this way</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking about life and alien life,</p>
<p>because ultimately we&rsquo;re trying to build,</p>
<p>I mean, science is just basically</p>
<p>our narratives about reality.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re building a narrative</p>
<p>that is what we are as physical systems.</p>
<p>It seems to me it needs to be as positive as possible</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s basically gonna shape</p>
<p>the future trajectory where we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t use that as a heuristic in theory building</p>
<p>because we think theories</p>
<p>are about predicting features of the world,</p>
<p>not causing them.</p>
<p>But if you look at the history of all of the development</p>
<p>of human thought, it&rsquo;s caused the things that happen next.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about looking at the world</p>
<p>and observing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about actually that feedback loop that&rsquo;s missing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not in any of those categories.</p>
<p>What do you think is the most beautiful idea</p>
<p>in the physics of life, in the chemistry of life,</p>
<p>in this, through all your exploration</p>
<p>with assembly theory, what is the thing</p>
<p>that made you step back and say this idea is beautiful</p>
<p>or potentially beautiful?</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s that the universe is a creative place.</p>
<p>I guess I want to think, and whether it&rsquo;s true or not,</p>
<p>is that we are special in some way</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not like an arbitrary added on epiphenomenon</p>
<p>or ad hoc feature of the universe that we exist,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something deep and intrinsic</p>
<p>to the structure of reality.</p>
<p>And to me, the most beautiful ideas that come out of that</p>
<p>is that the reason we exist is for the universe</p>
<p>to generate more things and to think about itself</p>
<p>and use that as a mechanism for creating more stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for me.</p>
<p>So like the life that this, however common it is,</p>
<p>is an intrinsic part, is a fundamental part</p>
<p>of this universe, at least, that we live in.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s always interesting to me</p>
<p>because we have theories of quantum mechanics and gravity</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re supposed to be like</p>
<p>our most fundamental theories right now.</p>
<p>And they describe things like the interaction</p>
<p>of massive bodies or the way that charges accelerate</p>
<p>or all these kind of features.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re these really deep theories</p>
<p>and they tell us a lot about how reality works,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re completely agnostic to our existence.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t help but think that whatever describes us</p>
<p>has to be even deeper than that.</p>
<p>And I think incorporating memory, I guess,</p>
<p>causality, whatever the term you want to use</p>
<p>into the physics view of the world might be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the easiest way to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the cleanest, so here we go again</p>
<p>with the physicist, I&rsquo;m a physicist.</p>
<p>The cleanest, I was gonna say the simplest,</p>
<p>most elegant way of resolving all of the kind of ways</p>
<p>that we have these paradoxes associated with life</p>
<p>when you, it&rsquo;s not that life is not,</p>
<p>current physics is not incompatible with life,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t explain life.</p>
<p>And then you want to know where are the explanatory gaps</p>
<p>and this idea that we have an assembly</p>
<p>that time is fundamental and objects actually</p>
<p>are extended in time and have physical extent in time</p>
<p>is the cleanest way of resolving</p>
<p>a lot of the explanatory gaps.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been, I struggled with assembly theory</p>
<p>for many years, because I could see this gap.</p>
<p>And I think when I first met Sarah</p>
<p>and we realized we were kind of talking</p>
<p>about the same problem, but we were,</p>
<p>we understood another language.</p>
<p>It was quite hilarious actually,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>but I think it sounds right.</p>
<p>So for me, the most beautiful thing about assembly theory</p>
<p>is I realized the assembly theory explains</p>
<p>why the universe, why life is the universe</p>
<p>developing a memory, but not only that poetically,</p>
<p>I could actually go and measure it.</p>
<p>And I was like, holy shit, we would just,</p>
<p>we physically measured this thing,</p>
<p>this abstract thing, and we could measure it.</p>
<p>And not only could we measure it,</p>
<p>but we can then start to quantify the causal consequences.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, I think as a kind of inventing this</p>
<p>together with Sarah and her team, I thought</p>
<p>there was a quite a high chance that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing science, there&rsquo;s such a high probability</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re wrong on this.</p>
<p>And I remember kind of trying to go to hard physicists,</p>
<p>mathematicians, complexity theorists,</p>
<p>and everyone just kind of giving me</p>
<p>such a hard time about it.</p>
<p>And so, this is kind of, you&rsquo;ve just done this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve just done that, you&rsquo;ve just recapitulated</p>
<p>an old theory.</p>
<p>And I was unable, I lacked the language to really explain,</p>
<p>and I had to, it was a real struggle.</p>
<p>So this realization that life, what life does</p>
<p>that physics cannot understand, or chemistry,</p>
<p>is the universe develops a memory</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s causally actionable, and then we can measure it,</p>
<p>but it isn&rsquo;t just a one thing,</p>
<p>there is this intrinsic property</p>
<p>of all the objects in the universe.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve said before, but me holding up this water bottle,</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t any other water bottle,</p>
<p>but it is a sum total of all the water bottles</p>
<p>that have existed, right?</p>
<p>And will likely change the future of water bottles</p>
<p>and for other objects.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this kind of, so for me,</p>
<p>assembly theory explains the soul in stuff.</p>
<p>The monology.</p>
<p>But it is the monology, it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>Sheldrake&rsquo;s morphic resonance,</p>
<p>where we have this kind of wooey thing</p>
<p>permeating the universe, it is the interaction</p>
<p>of objects of other objects.</p>
<p>And some objects have more instantaneous causal power,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s life, living things, and some objects</p>
<p>are the instantaneous output of that causal power,</p>
<p>dead objects, but they&rsquo;re part of the lineage.</p>
<p>And that for me is fascinating and really beautiful.</p>
<p>And I think that even if we&rsquo;re determined</p>
<p>to be totally wrong, I think it will help us,</p>
<p>help hopefully understand what life is</p>
<p>and go into tech life elsewhere and make life in the lab.</p>
<p>How does that make you feel, by the way?</p>
<p>Does it make you feel less special,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re so deeply integrated,</p>
<p>interconnected to the lineage?</p>
<p>I mean, okay, on one level, I just wanted in my life</p>
<p>as a scientist, I wanted to have an interesting idea</p>
<p>just once or an original idea.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like, you know, so I think that was cool</p>
<p>that we had this idea and we were playing with it.</p>
<p>And I think also that I kind of, I mean,</p>
<p>it took me ages to realize that Sarah had also had</p>
<p>the same kind of form, coming towards the same formulation</p>
<p>just from a completely different point because I,</p>
<p>but no, it makes me feel special.</p>
<p>And it also makes me feel connected to the universe.</p>
<p>It also makes me feel not just humble about, you know,</p>
<p>being a living object in the universe,</p>
<p>but the fact that it makes me really optimistic</p>
<p>about what the universe is gonna do in the future</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not just isolated phenomena, we are connected.</p>
<p>I will be able to have, you know, one of my small objectives</p>
<p>in life is to change the future of the universe</p>
<p>in some profound way, just by existing.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s not ambitious at all.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also good because it makes me feel less lonely</p>
<p>because I just realized I&rsquo;m not like,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a unique assembly structure,</p>
<p>but I have so much overlap with the other entities</p>
<p>I interact with that we&rsquo;re not completely individual, right?</p>
<p>And yet your existence does have a huge amount of impact</p>
<p>on how this whole thing unrolls on the future of the world.</p>
<p>As individuals, that&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>But I was gonna say. Local packets of agency.</p>
<p>I think we all have a profound impact on the future,</p>
<p>some more than others, right?</p>
<p>All human beings, all life.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s a privilege</p>
<p>in a way for, you know, to say,</p>
<p>to assert some degree of ego and agency,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m gonna make a computer</p>
<p>or make an origin life machine or we can do this thing.</p>
<p>But actually it&rsquo;s just like, you know,</p>
<p>my life&rsquo;s probably living, if there is a God</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a soul in everything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really laughing at us going,</p>
<p>I fool these guys by giving them ego.</p>
<p>So they strive for this stuff and look what it does</p>
<p>for the assembly space of the universe.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always a possibility</p>
<p>that science can&rsquo;t answer all of it.</p>
<p>So that part&rsquo;s challenging for me.</p>
<p>There might be a limit to this thing.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a bunch of ridiculous questions</p>
<p>and I demand relatively short answers.</p>
<p>Lee, what&rsquo;s the scariest thing you&rsquo;ve ever done?</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s a scary thing that pops to mind?</p>
<p>Giving seminars in front of other scientists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, yeah, that is terrifying.</p>
<p>I could, if I had more time,</p>
<p>I would ask you about the most embarrassing,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll spare you.</p>
<p>What about you Sarah, scariest thing?</p>
<p>Up there, some of the scary things you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Actually the scariest for me was deciding</p>
<p>I wanted to get divorced</p>
<p>because it was like a totally radical like.</p>
<p>Life transformation.</p>
<p>Yeah, because we had been married for a really long time.</p>
<p>And I think it was just so much like,</p>
<p>I realized like so much of my individual agency</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize I had before.</p>
<p>And that was just really like scary, like empowering scary,</p>
<p>but like terrifying.</p>
<p>Like you were living in a kind of one way</p>
<p>for your whole life.</p>
<p>And then you realized your life could be a different way.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a between humans.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the beautiful thing about love</p>
<p>is the connection you have,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also becomes a dependency and breaking that.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a mentor, what&rsquo;s your parents,</p>
<p>your close friends.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like waking up.</p>
<p>Like just there&rsquo;s a different reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was scary.</p>
<p>Reinventing yourself.</p>
<p>Okay, if you could, Lee,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;ll actually we&rsquo;ll alternate.</p>
<p>Sarah, if you could be someone else for a day,</p>
<p>someone alive today,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t met yet, haven&rsquo;t met yet.</p>
<p>Or maybe you could do one who you&rsquo;ve met.</p>
<p>Who would it be?</p>
<p>Kim Kardashian.</p>
<p>No joke.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>I would just like to experience,</p>
<p>like I just, I think she&rsquo;s got such an interesting</p>
<p>and very deep understanding of social reality.</p>
<p>But you also said you have appreciation</p>
<p>of love for fashion.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s actually the same.</p>
<p>Like I just think it&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because we live in a social reality</p>
<p>which is completely artificially constructed.</p>
<p>And some people are really genius about moving through that.</p>
<p>And I think she&rsquo;s particularly good at it.</p>
<p>I wonder if she&rsquo;s good at understanding or if she&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very deeply intrinsic to her.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if she has much.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like surfing a wave.</p>
<p>How much cognitive awareness she has of it</p>
<p>or how strategic it is.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s deeply fascinating.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s the first one that comes to mind.</p>
<p>What about you, Lee?</p>
<p>If you could be somebody for a day.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say Yoshua Bach.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say Kim Kardashian.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it off the table.</p>
<p>Off the table.</p>
<p>No, I was gonna say I would like to be a,</p>
<p>does it have to be here today?</p>
<p>I was gonna say I&rsquo;d like to be the latest arm processor.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I would like to be the latest arm processor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to understand.</p>
<p>I would like to know what it feel like to basically.</p>
<p>You like being objects.</p>
<p>I like being objects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always obsessed with being objects</p>
<p>ever since I was a kid.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best part of being an arm processor for a day?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d like to understand how I access my memory,</p>
<p>what it anticipates coming next in clock cycles.</p>
<p>What about how it feels like?</p>
<p>Yeah, I wanna know how it feels like to be.</p>
<p>To be useful.</p>
<p>Thanks for that.</p>
<p>All right, if, Lee, if everyone on Earth disappeared</p>
<p>and it was just you left, what would your days look like?</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>Nobody else left to impress.</p>
<p>Nobody, no, probably can&rsquo;t really do any real science</p>
<p>at scale.</p>
<p>What would you do with your remaining days?</p>
<p>Get every possible tool I could</p>
<p>and put it in my workshop and just make stuff.</p>
<p>As, so try to make stuff.</p>
<p>Just try and make stuff.</p>
<p>Make companions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty much making companions probably, yeah.</p>
<p>So in the physical space.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about you, Sarah?</p>
<p>What would you, when you&rsquo;re just left alone on Earth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the last person.</p>
<p>Are there animals in this scenario?</p>
<p>No living beings.</p>
<p>No plants?</p>
<p>No plants.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>I was gonna say, I would just,</p>
<p>I would try to walk the entire planet,</p>
<p>at least all the landmass.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So you probably don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s stuff.</p>
<p>You could be searching for plants or other humans</p>
<p>or other animals. And what would I eat?</p>
<p>You just have daily just allotment.</p>
<p>I would just walk all the time, I think.</p>
<p>Of Soylent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>Just walk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just what came to mind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the explorer.</p>
<p>I would just walk.</p>
<p>And I guess I would make a goal of covering</p>
<p>all of the entire Earth.</p>
<p>Because what else are you gonna do with your time?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an item on your bucket list, Sarah,</p>
<p>that you haven&rsquo;t done yet, but you hope to do?</p>
<p>Skydiving.</p>
<p>Travel to space.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s funny with my bucket list?</p>
<p>I only know it was on my bucket list once I check it off.</p>
<p>Once you check it off.</p>
<p>So your bucket list is like a fog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a mystery almost by doing it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s very subconsciously driven.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in your subconscious in there.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re bringing it to the surface.</p>
<p>I think most of the steering of our agency</p>
<p>is in our subconscious anyway,</p>
<p>so I just kind of go with the flow.</p>
<p>But I guess, no, seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I get it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I guess, but I would like to go on a submarine,</p>
<p>like to the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;d be really cool.</p>
<p>To the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>Are you captivated by the mystery of the ocean?</p>
<p>Like how little you know.</p>
<p>I am, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, what about you, Lee?</p>
<p>What item on your bucket list?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a bucket list, but I&rsquo;ve just made one.</p>
<p>I would love to take a computer to the moon or Mars</p>
<p>and make drugs off world.</p>
<p>Be the first chemist to make drugs off world.</p>
<p>The first drug manufacturer in space.</p>
<p>Yeah, why not?</p>
<p>Drugs in space.</p>
<p>Do they have to be somehow like be able to habitate,</p>
<p>like be able to survive on that particular space?</p>
<p>Or like what&rsquo;s the connection between being on Mars</p>
<p>and doing many things?</p>
<p>I just would like to be there.</p>
<p>I would like to take the ability to have command</p>
<p>and control over chemicals programmatically off earth</p>
<p>to somewhere else in the universe.</p>
<p>That just seems like you like difficulty</p>
<p>engineering problems.</p>
<p>Before I die, if I can do that, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Would you travel to space if you could?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to go into space, but not just to be a tourist.</p>
<p>I wanna take scientific experiment in space</p>
<p>and do a thing in space that&rsquo;s never been done before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real possibility.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s no point in listening</p>
<p>things I can&rsquo;t do, yeah.</p>
<p>All right, what small act of kindness</p>
<p>were you once shown that you will never forget?</p>
<p>Small act of kindness, not big.</p>
<p>Somebody was just kind to you.</p>
<p>Somebody did something sweet.</p>
<p>When I was a PhD student, someone helped me out</p>
<p>with just, basically, I needed a computer.</p>
<p>I needed some power, computation power,</p>
<p>and someone took pity on me and helped me.</p>
<p>I was really touched.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>And they were actually quite, they were a disabled scientist</p>
<p>and they had other things to do</p>
<p>rather than help some random PhD student.</p>
<p>Gave me access, taught me a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, when you&rsquo;re a grad student</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re a student, when you&rsquo;re even a student,</p>
<p>the younger it is, the better.</p>
<p>The attention, the support, the love you get</p>
<p>from an older person, a teacher,</p>
<p>something like that is super powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And from the perspective of the teacher,</p>
<p>they might not realize the impact they have,</p>
<p>but that little bit, those few words,</p>
<p>a little bit of help can have a lot of impact.</p>
<p>What about you, Sarah?</p>
<p>Somebody give you a free Starbucks at some point?</p>
<p>I love free Starbucks.</p>
<p>I like it when you&rsquo;re in the line at Starbucks</p>
<p>and somebody buys your coffee in front of you</p>
<p>and then you buy the next one.</p>
<p>I love those, but that&rsquo;s not my example.</p>
<p>Those are great.</p>
<p>It makes me happy.</p>
<p>And now my kids get all excited when we do it,</p>
<p>when we go in, we&rsquo;re the first ones in line doing it.</p>
<p>But I guess I can use a similar example</p>
<p>about just being a student.</p>
<p>So Paul Davies is a very well known theoretical physicist</p>
<p>and he was generous enough with his time</p>
<p>to take me on as a postdoc.</p>
<p>But before I became his postdoc,</p>
<p>he invited me to a workshop</p>
<p>at Arizona State University in the Beyond Center</p>
<p>and took a walk with me around campus</p>
<p>just to talk about ideas after.</p>
<p>And I think there were two things</p>
<p>that were completely generous about that.</p>
<p>One is Paul&rsquo;s philosophy is always interacting</p>
<p>with young people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you interact with a mind in the room.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how well known or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you evaluate the person for the person.</p>
<p>But he also gave me a book,</p>
<p>The Eerie Silence that he had written and he wrote in it,</p>
<p>This is How EE Gets to ET,</p>
<p>which was an antimeric excess,</p>
<p>which I worked on as a PhD student</p>
<p>was the origin of homochirality</p>
<p>all the way up to what the book was about,</p>
<p>which was are we alone in the universe</p>
<p>and is there intelligent life out there?</p>
<p>And it was just so much about the questions I wanted to ask</p>
<p>because it was just everything about,</p>
<p>just it was just really, really kind.</p>
<p>Like that it&rsquo;s okay to ask these questions</p>
<p>and you can actually have strong enough to answer them.</p>
<p>A lot of my career is mostly his encouragement</p>
<p>to ask deep questions.</p>
<p>Like he gave me the space to do it</p>
<p>in ways that a lot of previous mentors had.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve had a good experience with mentors,</p>
<p>but it was like go off the deep end,</p>
<p>ask the hardest questions.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the best gift you can give somebody.</p>
<p>What would you,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re both fascinating minds</p>
<p>and not, I would say, nonstandard in the best possible way.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give to young folks</p>
<p>how to be nonstandard, how to stand out,</p>
<p>novelty, how to generate novelty?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I want on my tombstone.</p>
<p>I have one.</p>
<p>He generated novelty.</p>
<p>No, no, how to.</p>
<p>Oh, how to.</p>
<p>How, how, still.</p>
<p>I just love doing science.</p>
<p>And so when I was younger, I was just,</p>
<p>just wanted to, I mean, I&rsquo;m still not sure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a real scientist, right?</p>
<p>So I want to try.</p>
<p>So my advice for the young people</p>
<p>is just, if you just, if you love asking questions,</p>
<p>then don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask the question,</p>
<p>even if it pisses people off,</p>
<p>because if you piss people off,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably asking the right question.</p>
<p>What I would say though, is don&rsquo;t do what I did,</p>
<p>which is just piss everyone off.</p>
<p>Try and work out how to, you know, I think,</p>
<p>if other people are challenged by your questions,</p>
<p>you will get not only respect,</p>
<p>but people will give you, create space for you,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing something really new.</p>
<p>I really try to create space in my academic career,</p>
<p>with my team, really try and praise them</p>
<p>and push them to do new things.</p>
<p>So my advice is, try to do new things,</p>
<p>get feedback, and the universe will help you.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Because the universe likes novelty.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think so, right?</p>
<p>This one will keep them around.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>What about you, Sarah?</p>
<p>You too like to ask the really out there big questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I have a strong passion for them.</p>
<p>So I think it goes back to the love.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re doing the thing you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing,</p>
<p>you should really love it.</p>
<p>So I always tell people that they should do</p>
<p>the thing they&rsquo;re most passionate about.</p>
<p>But I think a flip side of that is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you become in some way,</p>
<p>like not to sound cheesy,</p>
<p>but like your best version of yourself.</p>
<p>So I guess for me, as I become more successful in my career,</p>
<p>I feel like I can be more myself as an individual.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this, I&rsquo;ve always been following</p>
<p>the questions I&rsquo;m most interested in,</p>
<p>which very early on I was discouraged</p>
<p>from doing by many people</p>
<p>because they thought they were unanswerable questions.</p>
<p>And I always just thought,</p>
<p>well, if no one&rsquo;s even trying to answer them,</p>
<p>of course they&rsquo;re gonna be unanswerable.</p>
<p>And then that was kind of an odd viewpoint.</p>
<p>But the more I found my way in that space,</p>
<p>the more I also made a space for myself as a person,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re basically generating the niche</p>
<p>that you wanna exist in.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s part of it,</p>
<p>is not just to follow your passion,</p>
<p>but also think about like,</p>
<p>who do you wanna be and create that?</p>
<p>Yeah, who am I, who do you wanna be?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, play temporally with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, who am I now?</p>
<p>Who do I wanna be now?</p>
<p>But who do I wanna be in the future?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not decoupled.</p>
<p>Yeah, I always wonder if that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if I become something, am I finding myself</p>
<p>or am I creating myself?</p>
<p>And I think those are somehow the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>I do feel often like I was always meant</p>
<p>to be this kind of thing.</p>
<p>But is that created or discovered?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But basically go towards that direction.</p>
<p>If you were abducted by aliens, Sarah.</p>
<p>Excellent, I&rsquo;m waiting, they can come find me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re on a spaceship.</p>
<p>And then they somehow figured out the language you speak</p>
<p>and ask you, what are you?</p>
<p>What is, explain yourself.</p>
<p>Not you, Sarah, but the species.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Life on Earth, like we don&rsquo;t have time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re busy grad students from another planet.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about human civilization?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about you?</p>
<p>You specifically, too.</p>
<p>They could be very kind of personal, kind of pushy.</p>
<p>And yeah, how would you begin to describe?</p>
<p>Okay, I have one.</p>
<p>Because, you know, obviously I self identify</p>
<p>as a scientist and a physicist,</p>
<p>but intrinsically I feel more like an artist.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re an artist</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re painting yet.</p>
<p>And I guess I feel like that&rsquo;s humanity,</p>
<p>like in some sense, we&rsquo;re creating something</p>
<p>I think is profound and potentially very beautiful</p>
<p>in existence of the universe.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re just so, not night, we&rsquo;re just early.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re early, we&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s with the nuclear weapons?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a question, too.</p>
<p>Like what are you guys, why?</p>
<p>What are we doing with them?</p>
<p>This creativity that you talk, it sounds very nice,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re seem to be.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re making things that are.</p>
<p>Like very destructive and like the rockets,</p>
<p>this seems very aggressive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>This is my blinders on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, it goes back to the whole conversation</p>
<p>about suffering.</p>
<p>I have a hard time regularizing certain aspects</p>
<p>of reality into what I wanna envision.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s obviously problematic.</p>
<p>But nuclear power has also given us a lot of good things.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So both, that&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
<p>Both human beings and the technology we create</p>
<p>has the capacity for evil and the capacity for good.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we can&rsquo;t all be good all the time.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like this huge misnomer</p>
<p>that you need to be liked by everyone universally.</p>
<p>And obviously that&rsquo;s like an ideal,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s physically impossible.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t get a group of people in a room</p>
<p>and have everyone like each other all the time.</p>
<p>So I think that kind of tension is actually really important</p>
<p>that we have different aesthetics, different goals.</p>
<p>And sometimes conflict comes out of that.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, do Yuli and Yoshua Bach</p>
<p>ever say anything nice to each other?</p>
<p>Or is it always conflict?</p>
<p>We never have conflict.</p>
<p>We argue, but I don&rsquo;t think arguments are bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the problem I have,</p>
<p>not problem, I think.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not here to defend himself.</p>
<p>No, I just, I don&rsquo;t necessarily understand the,</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s just talking at such a high level.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a dimwit, so I&rsquo;m like, I spend some,</p>
<p>so I think a lot of our conflict is not conflict.</p>
<p>We actually, we actually have a, I think,</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t speak for Yash,</p>
<p>I have a deep appreciation for him, he&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>But I think I&rsquo;m kind of frustrated and I&rsquo;m trying to,</p>
<p>he thinks the universe is a computer</p>
<p>and I want to turn the universe into a computer.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a small disagreement.</p>
<p>So what would you, how would you defend your life</p>
<p>to an alien when you&rsquo;re being abducted?</p>
<p>Would you focus on the specifics of your life?</p>
<p>No, no, no, I would be, I would try to be</p>
<p>as random as possible and try and confuse them.</p>
<p>Oh, good, good.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>That might be the wiser choice.</p>
<p>The Easter eggs in reality.</p>
<p>No, I mean, if aliens abducted me.</p>
<p>Would you play dumb?</p>
<p>No, no, no, I would try and be as random as possible.</p>
<p>I would try and do something that would surprise</p>
<p>the hell out of them, which I thought,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d probably risk it, they might kill me,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;d probably be funny.</p>
<p>That might, yeah, they might want to study you</p>
<p>for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>My reasoning is, if I wanted to stay alive, okay,</p>
<p>so if the thing is, if I wasn&rsquo;t going back to Earth</p>
<p>and the job was to stay alive, if I could be</p>
<p>as surprising as possible, they&rsquo;d keep me around</p>
<p>like a pet, right?</p>
<p>Petly, on the aliens page book.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d be okay being a pet?</p>
<p>Well, no, but I mean.</p>
<p>The last human that survives would just be</p>
<p>a pet to the aliens.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I mean, I think that might be fun</p>
<p>because then I might get some feedback</p>
<p>from their curiosity, but yeah.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this question.</p>
<p>Given our conversation has a very different meaning,</p>
<p>not a more profound meaning, perhaps,</p>
<p>but would you rather lose all of your old memories</p>
<p>or never be able to make new ones?</p>
<p>I would have to lose all my old memories.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s the novelty.</p>
<p>What about you, Sarah?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the same because I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s about the future experience, right?</p>
<p>And in some sense, like you were saying earlier,</p>
<p>most of our lived experience is actually in our memories.</p>
<p>So if you can&rsquo;t generate new memories,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not alive anymore.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, yeah.</p>
<p>What comforts you on bad days?</p>
<p>When you look at human civilization,</p>
<p>when you look at your own life,</p>
<p>what gives you hope?</p>
<p>What makes you feel good about what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>about life at the small scale of you as a human</p>
<p>and at the big scale of us as a human civilization,</p>
<p>maybe the big scale of the universe?</p>
<p>Children, my kids.</p>
<p>But I also mean that in like a grand sense of like,</p>
<p>not a grand, but like future minds in some sense.</p>
<p>So for me, like the most bleak movie ever,</p>
<p>people worry about apocalyptic things</p>
<p>like AI existential risk and climate change,</p>
<p>which children of men.</p>
<p>The whole premise of the movie was</p>
<p>there can be no children born on the entire planet.</p>
<p>And the youngest person on the planet</p>
<p>is like 18 years old or something.</p>
<p>Like, can you imagine a world without children?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s harrowing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the scariest thing.</p>
<p>So I think what gives me hope is always youth</p>
<p>and the hope of children</p>
<p>and the possibilities of the future they see.</p>
<p>And they grow up in a completely different reality</p>
<p>than adults do.</p>
<p>And I think we have a hard time seeing</p>
<p>what their reality actually looks like.</p>
<p>But I think most of the time it&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, they have dreams, they have imagination,</p>
<p>they have this kind of excitement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool, it&rsquo;s so fun to watch.</p>
<p>And yeah, you feel like you&rsquo;re almost getting in the way</p>
<p>of all that imagination.</p>
<p>What about you, Lee?</p>
<p>What gives you hope?</p>
<p>So when I go back to my eight year old self,</p>
<p>the thing that I dreamed of as my eight year old self</p>
<p>was this world in which technology became programmable</p>
<p>and there was the internet and I&rsquo;d get information</p>
<p>and I would expand my consciousness by just,</p>
<p>you know, getting access to everything that was going on.</p>
<p>And this happened in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I mean, we really do have that.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, there&rsquo;s some bad things.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s TikTok, everyone just, whatever,</p>
<p>all the bad things about social media.</p>
<p>But I think,</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t quite believe my luck being born now.</p>
<p>So amazing.</p>
<p>Being able to program reality in some way.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the thing that I really find fascinating</p>
<p>about human beings is just how ingenious they are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, you know, whether it&rsquo;s from my kids,</p>
<p>my research group, my peers, other companies,</p>
<p>just how ingenious everyone is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m pretty sure humanity has,</p>
<p>or our causal chain in which humanity is a vital part</p>
<p>in the future is gonna have a lot of fun.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just, yeah, it&rsquo;s just mind blowing just to watch.</p>
<p>And, you know, so humans are ingenious</p>
<p>and I hope to help them be more ingenious if I can.</p>
<p>Well, what gives me hope,</p>
<p>what makes me feel good on bad days</p>
<p>is the existence of wild minds like yours,</p>
<p>novelty generators, assembly structures</p>
<p>that generate novelty and do so beautifully</p>
<p>and then tweet about it.</p>
<p>Sarah, I really, really enjoy talking to you.</p>
<p>I enjoy following you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>Sarah Lee, I hope to talk to you many times</p>
<p>in the future, maybe with Yoshua Bach.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just incredible people.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>Really, really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Yeah, brilliant to be here.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.</p>

<p>Now, let me leave you with some words from Arthur C. Clarke.</p>
<p>Two possibilities exist.</p>
<p>Either we are alone in the universe or we are not.</p>
<p>Both are equally terrifying.</p>
<p>And let me, if I may, add to that</p>
<p>by saying that both possibilities, at least to me,</p>
<p>are both terrifying and exciting.</p>
<p>And keeping these two feelings in my heart</p>
<p>is a fun way to explore, to wonder, to think, and to live,</p>
<p>always a little bit on the edge of madness.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next time.</p>
