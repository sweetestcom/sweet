<p>ÔªøVaccines are celebrated
for their part in fighting disease.</p>
<p>But, a growing group of people</p>
<p>seem to believe that they endanger
our health, instead of protecting it.</p>
<p>The Internet is full of stories
about allergic reactions,</p>
<p>the onset of disabilities,</p>
<p>and even death following
vaccination appointments.</p>
<p>And, it&rsquo;s true vaccines can have side effects.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how they work,
and how dangerous they really are.</p>
<p>Your immune system is a
complex army of billions of cells.</p>
<p>Soldiers,</p>
<p>intelligence cells,</p>
<p>and weapons factories.</p>
<p>Every day, you&rsquo;re attacked countless times,</p>
<p>but your immune soldiers alone
usually deal with that,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t even notice.</p>
<p>If an infection becomes serious though,</p>
<p>our intelligence cells gather
intel about the attackers</p>
<p>and activate our weapons factories.</p>
<p>You know the weapon: antibodies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like targeted missiles produced
specifically to combat the invader.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this process takes
several days to complete.</p>
<p>That gives intruders
a lot of time to do damage.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular wisdom,</p>
<p>what doesn&rsquo;t kill you doesn&rsquo;t make you stronger.</p>
<p>Our bodies really don&rsquo;t want
to fight serious wars over and over,</p>
<p>so our immune system came up
with an ingenious way</p>
<p>to get stronger and stronger over time.</p>
<p>If we fight an enemy that is dangerous
enough to trigger our heavy weapons,</p>
<p>our immune system automatically
creates memory cells.</p>
<p>Memory cells remain in our body
for years, in a deep sleep.</p>
<p>They do nothing but remember.</p>
<p>When an enemy attacks for a second time,</p>
<p>the slumbering memory cells awaken,</p>
<p>and order coordinated attacks
and the production of antibodies.</p>
<p>This is so fast and effective,</p>
<p>that many infections you beat once
will never make you sick again.</p>
<p>You might even be immune
against them forever.</p>
<p>Which is also why little kids are constantly ill;</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have enough memory cells yet.</p>
<p>And this beautiful natural mechanism
is what we build on when we use vaccines.</p>
<p>How Vaccines Work</p>
<p>As great as memory cells are,</p>
<p>obtaining them through an infection
is unpleasant and sometimes dangerous.</p>
<p>Vaccines are a way of tricking
our bodies into making memory cells,</p>
<p>and becoming immune to a disease.</p>
<p>They pretend to be a dangerous infection.</p>
<p>One way of doing this is to inject
invaders that can&rsquo;t do harm.</p>
<p>For example, by killing them,
or by ripping them into pieces.</p>
<p>Our immune systems deal with
these kinds of vaccines pretty easily.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s necessary to make
our immune system work harder though,</p>
<p>to produce even more memory cells.</p>
<p>Live vaccines are the real deal.</p>
<p>An enemy that can punch back is
a bigger challenge than a dead one.</p>
<p>But this also sounds like
a sort-of horrible idea.</p>
<p>What if the germs win?</p>
<p>To avoid that, we breed a sort-of
weak cousin of the real germ in the lab.</p>
<p>Just powerful enough to annoy the immune
system, and create enough memory cells.</p>
<p>Okay, so these are the basic
principles of vaccine use.</p>
<p>They provoke a natural reaction in our bodies</p>
<p>that makes us become immune
against very dangerous diseases.</p>
<p>Some, like the flu virus, mutate so often</p>
<p>that we need a new vaccine every year,</p>
<p>but most vaccines protect us
for years, or even a lifetime.</p>
<p>But, there&rsquo;s a catch.</p>
<p>Like everything in life,
vaccines have another side:</p>
<p>Side effects.</p>
<p>What are they, and what happens
if your child develops one?</p>
<p>The Risks of Vaccines</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated to directly compare the side
effects of vaccines with the effects of diseases.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of people are
vaccinated against measles in the West,</p>
<p>but there were only 83,000
cases in Europe in 2018.</p>
<p>So, with numbers that different,
even mild side effects can seem scary</p>
<p>compared to the bad effects of a disease
that we don&rsquo;t see as much anymore.</p>
<p>Before the measles vaccine
became available in 1963,</p>
<p>virtually every single child on Earth
contracted measles at some point.</p>
<p>An estimated 135 million cases in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Every single year.</p>
<p>But are measles really that
dangerous in the year 2019?</p>
<p>With our advanced healthcare
and new technologies,</p>
<p>are they worth the risk of vaccine side effects?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a thought experiment
based on real numbers.</p>
<p>Imagine a developed country
in a parallel world.</p>
<p>It has good healthcare but
people stop vaccinating.</p>
<p>In this scenario, let&rsquo;s say ten
million children caught measles.</p>
<p>What happens?</p>
<p>Nine million eight hundred thousand, or 98%,
will get a high fever and a very unpleasant rash.</p>
<p>Up to 800,000 of them, or 8%,
will suffer from dangerous diarrhea.</p>
<p>700,000, or 7%, will suffer from an ear infection,
which can lead to permanent hearing loss.</p>
<p>600,000 kids, or 6%, will suffer from pneumonia
&ndash; the most dangerous effect of measles.</p>
<p>It, alone, will kill 12,000 children.</p>
<p>Up to 10,000 children, or 0.1%,
will get encephalitis.</p>
<p>2,500 kids, or 0.025%, will contract SSPE,</p>
<p>a disease where the measles
virus lingers in their brain</p>
<p>and kills them a few years later.</p>
<p>Taken together,</p>
<p>around 2.5 million children will suffer from
somewhat serious effects from measles.</p>
<p>And, about 20,000 children
will be killed by measles.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t stop here though.</p>
<p>The kids who beat measles are left with
a severely damaged immune system</p>
<p>that needs a lot of time to regenerate.</p>
<p>Time for other diseases to do further damage.</p>
<p>Aside from that, what&rsquo;s almost guaranteed</p>
<p>is that your kids will have a really
bad time for about two weeks.</p>
<p>Okay, but what about vaccines?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only fair to look at these risks, too.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s repeat our thought experiment.</p>
<p>But, this time, we vaccinate ten
million children with MMR.</p>
<p>What would theoretically happen here?</p>
<p>After being vaccinated,</p>
<p>of our 10 million kids,
around ten percent get a fever.</p>
<p>500,000, or 5%, will get a mild rash.</p>
<p>Up to 100, or 0.001%,</p>
<p>might have a serious allergic reaction
and will have to be treated.</p>
<p>Up to ten boys, or 0.0001%,</p>
<p>might get inflammation of the genitalia.</p>
<p>And up to ten kids in total, or 0.0001%,</p>
<p>might get the most serious
side effect: encephalitis.</p>
<p>So, we vaccinated ten million kids.</p>
<p>In total, around one hundred and twenty had
side effects that were somewhat serious.</p>
<p>Thanks to good medical treatment in developed
regions, almost all of them will be fine.</p>
<p>What about autism?</p>
<p>The connection of autism and vaccines
stems from one source</p>
<p>that has been disproven countless times.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll link to further reading
and videos in the description.</p>
<p>But, in 2019, it&rsquo;s fair to say that
vaccines do not cause autism.</p>
<p>All right, but what about deaths?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to say if even a single one of
our 10 million vaccinated kids would die.</p>
<p>We really did look hard and
talked to a lot of different experts.</p>
<p>If we ignore self-reporting,</p>
<p>we could only come up with a tiny
handful of documented cases</p>
<p>for all the hundreds of millions of children
who received the MMR vaccine since 1971.</p>
<p>Measles are many, many thousands of
times more dangerous for your child</p>
<p>than even the absolute worst
case of vaccine side effects.</p>
<p>You have to search for lethal vaccine side
effects with a huge magnifying glass</p>
<p>and, even then, it&rsquo;s very hard
to find confirmed cases.</p>
<p>While, deaths from measles
are real and easy to find.</p>
<p>In 2017 alone, 110,000 people
died from measles worldwide.</p>
<p>Statistically, today,
300 children will die of measles.</p>
<p>One since this video started.</p>
<p>You can compare vaccines to seatbelts.</p>
<p>Are there weird freak accidents where
someone gets killed by their seatbelt?</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>But, do you personally think it&rsquo;s safer
to not put a seatbelt on your kid?</p>
<p>Wait a second!</p>
<p>What if your kid is actually allergic?</p>
<p>What if none of the things we&rsquo;ve said
applies to your specific situation?</p>
<p>In this case, you need to become the
greatest vaccination promoter of all.</p>
<p>Because if your children can&rsquo;t be vaccinated,
only the collective can protect them.</p>
<p>This is called herd immunity,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the only thing that
can protect your unvaccinated child.</p>
<p>Herd immunity means that enough
people are immune to a disease,</p>
<p>that it can&rsquo;t spread, and dies
before it reaches its victims.</p>
<p>But to accomplish this for measles alone,</p>
<p>95% of the people around you
need to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The problem with the debate about vaccines
is that it&rsquo;s not fought on a level playing field.</p>
<p>While the pro-vaccine side argues
with studies and statistics,</p>
<p>the arguments against them are
usually a wild mixture of gut feeling,</p>
<p>anecdotes, and misinformation.</p>
<p>And feelings are often immune to facts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll not convince anybody
by screaming at them.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t hide from the reality
of what anti-vaccine conspiracies do.</p>
<p>They kill babies too young to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>They kill healthy children that are just unlucky.</p>
<p>They bring serious diseases back
from the verge of extinction.</p>
<p>And, the biggest side effect
of vaccines is fewer dead children.</p>
<p>Vaccines are one of
the most powerful tools we have</p>
<p>to eradicate the monsters that
most of us have already forgotten.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not bring the beasts back!</p>
