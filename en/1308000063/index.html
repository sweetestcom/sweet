    <p>Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Guys, listen,</p>
<p>look at this. It&rsquo;s now it&rsquo;s candle season. Oh god. Look at</p>
<p>the equanimity. This is equanimity. This candle costs</p>
<p>$24, 000. It is an extremely rare Brazilian sandalwood. You</p>
<p>literally have to go into the Amazon and like, you know, you</p>
<p>you basically have to like, I mean, find extinct trees. No,</p>
<p>bro, you gotta you gotta tear out like two acres of</p>
<p>rainforest and then you find this one tree completely, you</p>
<p>know, sacred and then you chop it down. You make this and it</p>
<p>lasts for a full 45 minutes. How do you like that sweater</p>
<p>Karen? Happy New Year. Candle Karen&rsquo;s are going to be</p>
<p>Karen. Candle Karen&rsquo;s are calling it right now. The DMs</p>
<p>are coming. You guys wanna hear about poker last night? Oh,</p>
<p>did you go? So, I go down. I take my eight-hour drive down</p>
<p>south to and I pull in and you know, the security guard</p>
<p>greets me nicely as always. I walk in and I walk towards the</p>
<p>poker room and everyone&rsquo;s in there with the door open like</p>
<p>someone just got shot. Masks on freaking out and Chamath is</p>
<p>inside the house and I wave and he&rsquo;s like, get in here and then</p>
<p>I go in. He&rsquo;s like, oh, who is positive? Max, the dealer</p>
<p>tested positive and everyone been hanging out in the poker</p>
<p>room with no masks on. Uh oh. And so, you know, they&rsquo;re super</p>
<p>spread out. The only the only two people that were exposed to</p>
<p>Max we sent home. Yeah. So, everyone starts freaking out.</p>
<p>It shuts the shuts the poker game down. Chamath kicks</p>
<p>everyone out, sends everyone home, and then he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>alright, let&rsquo;s go have dinner inside. You know, we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not, we&rsquo;re gonna, we open up all the doors. We&rsquo;re gonna kind</p>
<p>of Lysol the room tomorrow. We all go in and have dinner or</p>
<p>you know, Chamath and I go in and have dinner with Matt and</p>
<p>the kids and then Chamath starts thinking, you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay. They were only exposed for a few seconds. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>call Phil back. Okay, let&rsquo;s call back. Let&rsquo;s call Keating</p>
<p>back and then they all come back for dinner and at this</p>
<p>point, it&rsquo;s become like a dinner party and then a couple</p>
<p>of glasses of wine in and then it&rsquo;s like, you know what? The</p>
<p>room&rsquo;s probably safe. I mean, the whole poker night went</p>
<p>through the entire cycle of psychology of COVID. The the</p>
<p>whole pandemic is like, oh my god. Get everyone out. Lock up</p>
<p>and then by the end of the night, it was like, you know</p>
<p>what? Let&rsquo;s go in the room and just play poker and give each</p>
<p>other COVID. They got to acceptance. They got to</p>
<p>acceptance. They went through the whole emotional cycle of</p>
<p>the pandemic in one hour. Does anyone know anyone who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>serious case of Omicron? No. I mean, I know dozens of people</p>
<p>at this point and they all say it was a cold. Yeah. Dozens of</p>
<p>people and that&rsquo;s just for Jake. I was on social media.</p>
<p>Jake, I was on social media giving everyone the update</p>
<p>like, oh, I sneezed today. I&rsquo;m oh, I still tested positive.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like showing his positive test.</p>
<p>But I was doing that as a service. My superfans, my</p>
<p>stans were concerned. It&rsquo;s the only good test result J Cal&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever had. Yeah, exactly. It&rsquo;s the only positive. That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>And it said, we open sourced it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>gone crazy with it. Love you guys. Nice queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Holmes has been found guilty on four counts of fraud</p>
<p>faces 20 years in prison for each guilty count they would be</p>
<p>I understand served concurrently. Most people I hear</p>
<p>speculating four to 10 years and then I think you can get 15%</p>
<p>off for good behavior. Again, I&rsquo;m no expert on that. But</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I read. Guilty counts were two counts of wire</p>
<p>fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud. She</p>
<p>was originally charged with a total of 11 counts of fraud.</p>
<p>Four were guilty for we&rsquo;re not guilty. Three were a split</p>
<p>verdict. The jury said they were unable to come to a unanimous</p>
<p>unanimous verdict on three of the counts after more than 45</p>
<p>hours of deliberation quote from the Wall Street Journal article</p>
<p>juries were persuaded that Miss Holmes conspired to defraud</p>
<p>investors. This outcome could be significant because it means</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of dollars of there are no investors that</p>
<p>there are those investors lost could be taken into consideration</p>
<p>during her sentencing is big numbers. The jury was split</p>
<p>however, on which of the six investors who testified were</p>
<p>defrauded the jurors convicted Miss Holmes on three counts.</p>
<p>These included $100 million from the family office of former</p>
<p>educator, ed education details J. Cal&rsquo;s doing it for the</p>
<p>audience. So anyway, thoughts on the legal technicalities of</p>
<p>the case, counselor sex? Well, we&rsquo;ve talked about this before.</p>
<p>I mean, I think so at the end of the day, she was convicted on</p>
<p>the counts related to deceiving investors. She was not on the</p>
<p>counts related to patients. I think that makes sense in that</p>
<p>her obligations to investors are very clear. Whereas I think</p>
<p>the the patient related duties are I mean, she had them, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit less clear. So I mean, look, it&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always said here. As a founder, you can be as messianic as you</p>
<p>want to be, you can promise, you know, anything about your</p>
<p>vision and what you intended to the future. But what you must</p>
<p>do is be accurate about the current state of your business,</p>
<p>you cannot lie about the deals that you&rsquo;ve made about the</p>
<p>current capabilities of your product. And she was putting,</p>
<p>you know, logos of customers she didn&rsquo;t have in her deck, she</p>
<p>was lying about the military being a customer. So she simply</p>
<p>exactly misrepresented where she was at that time at the at</p>
<p>when these investors invested, and that was the red line she</p>
<p>should not have crossed. And I think in that sense, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pretty simple case. I think, you know, the part of this, again,</p>
<p>you know, the piece of this that&rsquo;s interesting, is not the</p>
<p>case itself, but really the media coverage, because the</p>
<p>media wants to portray this case as an indictment of Silicon</p>
<p>Valley. And the thing you keep hearing over and over again,</p>
<p>none of us were involved.</p>
<p>Well, it just factually, yes, exactly. We weren&rsquo;t involved.</p>
<p>But what you like, so there&rsquo;s not a single person in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley, I think, who put in a single shekel into this thing,</p>
<p>who actually does this as a real job, Tim Draper. Well, he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t put in a little bit money as an angel. And then he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t put a single dollar in after that, I&rsquo;m saying, you</p>
<p>know, you didn&rsquo;t come to social capital or graph ventures, or</p>
<p>to Sequoia, or to TPB, or to Google, to raise money for this</p>
<p>thing. None of that happened. You know, Saks is right, like</p>
<p>the the summary of the Wall Street Journal, Nick, you can</p>
<p>post it, because I put it in the group chat, basically</p>
<p>summarize the fraud. And it&rsquo;s exactly what Saks says she</p>
<p>affixed the logo of specifically, I think it was</p>
<p>Pfizer, that had not validated their own assist technology in</p>
<p>materials she presented to investors. So she&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>like Pfizer said, this is a go. And apparently, that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>true. She gave the false impression that the devices were</p>
<p>used by the US military. That&rsquo;s what got all these military</p>
<p>folks to sign on board and support it. That wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>And then and then she, the biggest coup was that she</p>
<p>signed a deal with Walgreens and Safeway to include its</p>
<p>devices in hundreds of stores. And then many investors saw</p>
<p>these contracts as an endorsement of the technology</p>
<p>and growth potential. But basically, those folks did no</p>
<p>diligence and bought the hype. And so it was just a whole</p>
<p>cycle of this thing that basically fell apart because</p>
<p>the test didn&rsquo;t work. Freeberg. What are your thoughts as our</p>
<p>life science guru? What&rsquo;s most interesting to me is how does</p>
<p>this get to this point? If you&rsquo;re Elizabeth Holmes, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>19 years old, and you start telling your story, and the</p>
<p>more grandiose the story you tell is the better the reaction</p>
<p>you get is, it becomes reinforcing, and the behavior</p>
<p>extends a little bit further and a little bit further. Every</p>
<p>time she told a story about how incredible this tech was, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just one drop, you take one drop, it can measure everything.</p>
<p>When she simplified it and reduced it to that, and it was</p>
<p>such an incredible statement, and she saw the reaction from</p>
<p>people, she&rsquo;s like, wow, that works. Let me repeat it. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like any good salesperson, they figure out what sells, and then</p>
<p>they sell it, and then they repeat. And what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>to me that, you know, you talk about the media, but when she</p>
<p>went out and told her story, and got incredible press coverage,</p>
<p>because she was a young female doing something that was going</p>
<p>to save lives. There was this altruistic Steve Jobs esque</p>
<p>kind of combination here. The media wrote a glowing review of</p>
<p>her. And then she said, wow, look, they said something great.</p>
<p>Let me go do that again. And she got a bigger media piece</p>
<p>written a bigger media piece. And the more she said, the</p>
<p>bigger she said it, the more she claimed she could do, the</p>
<p>bigger the story got, the more coverage she got. And the whole</p>
<p>thing became this kind of reinforcing cycle. And I do</p>
<p>think that the press coverage that she got, as she was</p>
<p>building this business, which helped her raise capital helped</p>
<p>her attract employees helped her get Walgreens and Safeway to</p>
<p>the table, allow her downfall, it allowed her to build the</p>
<p>business. But it&rsquo;s exactly what created the narrative that</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t true. And so the coverage that the press gave her and we</p>
<p>see this every day, you guys all see these top 50 companies.</p>
<p>And we all know, having met a lot of these companies, as you</p>
<p>go down that list, this, this 20 companies are total scam</p>
<p>companies, or fraud, they&rsquo;re not going to work, they&rsquo;re grifters,</p>
<p>all the stuff that you guys might say about the quality of</p>
<p>those businesses. But the press reporter isn&rsquo;t doing diligence,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not a no, you know, it turns out all the diligence was</p>
<p>done after the fact. And then it&rsquo;s like, well, maybe we should</p>
<p>go do some diligence. Oh, wait a second. Because the press</p>
<p>coverage has now created this hype story about who and what</p>
<p>she is. The diligence actually pays off, because you have</p>
<p>something to take apart. If she was just a nobody startup that</p>
<p>raised $30 million, and they&rsquo;re still trying to figure out their</p>
<p>way, there would be no value in any reporter doing diligence on</p>
<p>her and trying to figure out what was actually there. It was</p>
<p>because the story got big, that it gave everyone including John</p>
<p>carry you an incentive. He&rsquo;s the Wall Street Journal reporter</p>
<p>who broke all this and incentive to go in and take this thing</p>
<p>apart. And so it&rsquo;s really unfortunate, and it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>self reinforcing that the press coverage that created the</p>
<p>circumstance here, ultimately also enabled them the press to</p>
<p>take the thing apart, and you know, land land this woman in</p>
<p>jail. And I&rsquo;m not saying she did nothing wrong. But I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>saying that there&rsquo;s a system here. And the system is set up</p>
<p>in such a way that she manipulated the press. Yeah,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let me ask you a question, you freeberg. And then I got a</p>
<p>question for Saxon Shema, her basic premise, that one drop of</p>
<p>blood could get you hundreds of results. Let me just ask you a</p>
<p>question freeberg. At what point would one drop of blood or so a</p>
<p>nanotube be able to at our current technological, you know,</p>
<p>ramp, be able to give us 100 different data points on a</p>
<p>person,</p>
<p>every time you&rsquo;re generating a data point, you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called an assay, which is a measurement of something.</p>
<p>The question is, how much of a molecule are you measuring</p>
<p>against what volume? Is there enough of that molecule in that</p>
<p>volume to give you a statistically good reading. And</p>
<p>that is a function of how precisely you can measure that</p>
<p>thing. So there are there are great advances happening right</p>
<p>now in a domain in life sciences of hardware technology</p>
<p>called microfluidics. This is the manipulation of Pico leader,</p>
<p>you know, very, very small volumes of liquid, and then</p>
<p>being able to run chemical assays using biochemical</p>
<p>techniques, which we now have all these amazing new kind of</p>
<p>tools like CRISPR and other things that would allow us to</p>
<p>get a much more precise measurement with a much smaller</p>
<p>volume than has ever been possible. So we can manipulate</p>
<p>small fluids, we can measure them. So there&rsquo;s nothing today</p>
<p>that would physically say, we cannot do many of the things</p>
<p>that she claimed to have been able to do. But there are</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a stacking of technology assets that need to be done to</p>
<p>make that happen in reality,</p>
<p>take a guess, each of those assets are very different. So</p>
<p>look, you could do it with cholesterol right now, you could</p>
<p>do it with blood sugar right now. But you couldn&rsquo;t do both.</p>
<p>You could, theoretically, you could put them into a device</p>
<p>and do that. No, the reason the reason why lipids work, can you</p>
<p>do 400 things we cannot, we cannot, I&rsquo;ve actually funded</p>
<p>three of these businesses, and I&rsquo;ve poured almost 100 million</p>
<p>dollars of money into it, and they&rsquo;ve all failed. And the</p>
<p>reason is exactly what he said, you can do cholesterol because</p>
<p>lipids are big enough, you know, and so you can basically</p>
<p>build an assay that can pick that off with a drop of blood,</p>
<p>you can do a reasonably good job with pretty large error bars on</p>
<p>sugar. But all of this other stuff where you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>replace like a, you know, a CBC, or these broad, you know,</p>
<p>profile panels that we all get once a year to assess our</p>
<p>health. Today, I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s necessarily within</p>
<p>reach, it&rsquo;s not within technological reach. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not because people aren&rsquo;t, you know, smart enough, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that not enough of this investment is happening. Because</p>
<p>then you go back to this whole idea where the funding cycle</p>
<p>needs to see a big payoff for the capitalists to want to get</p>
<p>involved in this thing. And there really isn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as if, like quest and lab core are printing $400</p>
<p>billion of revenue and profits. And so it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>massive economic incentive to run in. And so even when you</p>
<p>know, we have tried and multiple occasions with completely</p>
<p>different teams of incredible people, every single time we</p>
<p>have failed. So there&rsquo;s a physics law here, that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>not physically possible. She made this claim.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t make it broad. There are things there are</p>
<p>molecules, there are pathogens, there are things you can</p>
<p>absolutely detect small molecules, molecules, you can</p>
<p>you can detect with a drop of blood, you know, magic counting</p>
<p>how many blood cells you have in your whole body, you know,</p>
<p>using an estimate from a single droplet of blood, because you</p>
<p>know, we have these machines called flow cytometry machines</p>
<p>where we sort blood cells. And then it&rsquo;ll tell you how many</p>
<p>red blood cells you have, and how many different kinds of</p>
<p>white blood cells, that&rsquo;s a big part of your annual checkup</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll typically get, you know, you need a good amount of</p>
<p>blood to get an accurate reading on how many blood cells there</p>
<p>are using even just using lasers, and you know, these</p>
<p>sophisticated machines, can you reduce that down to a droplet</p>
<p>physically, probably not right. And so there&rsquo;s some, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>universal to say this is possible, it&rsquo;s not possible,</p>
<p>there are elements that are absolutely possible, some of</p>
<p>which are being done today. And there are some things that are</p>
<p>going to be very hard to pull off.</p>
<p>Got it. And she was making these claims as early as 2003</p>
<p>when it was founded. So we&rsquo;re talking about 19 years ago. And</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re saying here, it&rsquo;s not going to be possible to do</p>
<p>hundreds of these things, maybe in our lifetime, we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about decades from there may need to be some significant</p>
<p>breakthrough. Saks, let me ask you a legal question. I was on a</p>
<p>podcast, and I said to them, why haven&rsquo;t the prosecutors had</p>
<p>Bill Maris, who is a friend of freebergs who helped me get him</p>
<p>on the podcast. He was great. Thank you for that. David, on</p>
<p>this week and startups, very smart guy, very smart guy. And</p>
<p>he came out publicly when he was running Google Ventures. And he</p>
<p>said, we looked at it a couple of times, he&rsquo;s referring to</p>
<p>their nose. But there was so much hand waving, like, look</p>
<p>over here, that we couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. So we just had</p>
<p>someone from our life science investment team go into</p>
<p>Walgreens and take the test. And it wasn&rsquo;t that difficult for</p>
<p>anyone to determine that things may not have been not be what</p>
<p>they seem here. Now, Saks, I was on this podcast, the dropout</p>
<p>which I think is an ABC News one. And I said, why didn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>prosecution bring up, you know, GV, let&rsquo;s assume Sequoia and</p>
<p>recent and, you know, the 20 top firms in the valley, who said</p>
<p>no, and they all said no, because she wouldn&rsquo;t show them</p>
<p>due diligence. And I asked them, why didn&rsquo;t the prosecutors</p>
<p>bring up those 20 firms and compel them to testify about why</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t invest to give the counter example. And she said,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Wouldn&rsquo;t that have been a much better strategy to</p>
<p>say, here are the credible people who didn&rsquo;t invest?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I see the relevance of that, because Elizabeth</p>
<p>Holmes crime was not promising something that she couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ultimately deliver on. It&rsquo;s okay to fail in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>One of the best things about Silicon Valley is that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>punish failure. Her mistake was making misrepresentations to</p>
<p>the people who did invest.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If anything, actually, what Elizabeth Holmes maybe should</p>
<p>have done was call up some of those firms. And they could</p>
<p>have said how easy it was for them to figure out that they</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t have invested. Maybe that would have been a way to</p>
<p>kind of muddy the waters on her side.</p>
<p>I was thinking that they would have said, hey, she wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>show us the technology. And when we did our independent</p>
<p>diligence, she wouldn&rsquo;t let us diligence we did outside back</p>
<p>door diligence. It failed.</p>
<p>There were red flags all over this thing we had talked about</p>
<p>in our poker games way before this thing went off the rails.</p>
<p>The fact that there were no major VC firms involved who</p>
<p>had expertise in biotech who could do the diligence.</p>
<p>It was all sort of, it was basically family office money</p>
<p>of people who weren&rsquo;t in Silicon Valley, writing big</p>
<p>checks, whether it was Rupert Murdoch or the DeVos family or</p>
<p>what have you. There were just red flags coming off this</p>
<p>thing, which is why Silicon Valley was not by and large</p>
<p>duped by it. The people who were duped by it were the people</p>
<p>that Elizabeth Holmes was able to sell the patina of Silicon</p>
<p>Valley to, and the media, because the media, what we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen over and over again is they don&rsquo;t fact check stories</p>
<p>when they fit their priors. The prior here is that, you know,</p>
<p>what the media want to believe is that the next Steve Jobs is</p>
<p>going to be a woman. And so when Elizabeth Holmes served that</p>
<p>up to them wearing the black turtleneck, it was too good a</p>
<p>story for them to fact check too heavily. And so they ran with</p>
<p>it in the same way, in the same way that, you know, the</p>
<p>ivermectin hoax that Rolling Stone ran with was too good a</p>
<p>story to be fact checked, because they want to believe</p>
<p>that the MAGA people in Oklahoma were eating horse paste.</p>
<p>I mean, no, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s 100 better examples of just I</p>
<p>mean, just to be generic sacks of other startups that we all</p>
<p>know are total nonsense, and total nonsense. There&rsquo;s like up</p>
<p>about them. There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a fraud in biotech going on right</p>
<p>now that a David and I, David and I saw up front. I mean, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, this stuff is crazy. It&rsquo;s really, really great.</p>
<p>So look, I mean, I think the moral of the story for</p>
<p>entrepreneurs, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a couple of takeaways</p>
<p>here. Number one, you got to be really clear with the present</p>
<p>state of your business. It&rsquo;s okay to talk about your grand</p>
<p>vision of what you&rsquo;re going to do in the future. But you cannot</p>
<p>be inaccurate in any way with respect to your current numbers</p>
<p>and partnerships, and deals and current capabilities. I think</p>
<p>number two, I think, when you start working with the media in</p>
<p>this way to promote your company, you&rsquo;re playing with</p>
<p>fire. Because the media really has two kinds of stories, they</p>
<p>build up and they tear down. And when they&rsquo;re done building you</p>
<p>up, they&rsquo;re going to tear you down, because that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>story left to write. So if you&rsquo;re gonna go court the media</p>
<p>in that way to try and get publicity, you better be really</p>
<p>careful how you do it. And you better be really accurate. And</p>
<p>you better not give them cause to later regret pumping you up</p>
<p>because they will tear you down even harder if you do that.</p>
<p>I think I think the more important danger that I just</p>
<p>like to speak generally to for a second is to not let other</p>
<p>people do your thinking for you. The investors that came</p>
<p>into this business came in under the assumption that this</p>
<p>was a real business, because the press had written about it.</p>
<p>And the press wrote about it because the general had joined</p>
<p>the board. And the general joined the board because his</p>
<p>buddy, George Schultz said, Hey, you should meet this lady.</p>
<p>And the whole thing ended up becoming this roundabout, where</p>
<p>no one actually did any original thinking and no one</p>
<p>did any actual diligence. And the whole thing ended up being</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, you know, now you&rsquo;re talking about actually how</p>
<p>Silicon Valley works. So that&rsquo;s fucking bullshit. Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think these dopes run around thinking of Sequoia</p>
<p>benchmark, social capital, craft, invest, I&rsquo;m just plowing</p>
<p>the money. And of course, they do. They don&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>social proof, they assume that we&rsquo;ve done our job.</p>
<p>You think they&rsquo;re doing principal diligence, these guys</p>
<p>like the Silicon Valley ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is also how the Bernie Madoff scandal, you know, got</p>
<p>so far ahead of itself. No one actually went in and did the</p>
<p>of those. Everyone assumed that because someone else has is in</p>
<p>this thing, and because someone else is involved, or someone</p>
<p>else, something nice has been written about it or said about</p>
<p>it, it&rsquo;s worth backing and like the lack of original thinking</p>
<p>and business and life in general, I think is, you know,</p>
<p>one of the biggest, you know, risks that each of us takes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really important to learn how to think</p>
<p>for yourself. I have deep respect for early stage</p>
<p>investors, because they have to get in and make some critical</p>
<p>decisions. Some people make those decisions about the team,</p>
<p>right, the psychology of the co founders. Sometimes it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>the end market. And sometimes it&rsquo;s about a deep analysis of</p>
<p>the traction. But you have to honestly, let&rsquo;s be honest, there</p>
<p>is a valley of funding between the Series A and maybe the D or</p>
<p>the E, where I really think a lot of folks just look for</p>
<p>signaling value based on who the Series A investors were.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure they making but I&rsquo;m not sure that those family</p>
<p>offices were any worse or any better. Like, maybe the DeVos</p>
<p>family looked at Rupert Murdoch and said, he&rsquo;s smart. So I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly what happened. That&rsquo;s so different</p>
<p>than all the Series B and C firms and say, Oh, benchmarks in</p>
<p>admin. Totally. It&rsquo;s the exact same thing. Totally. I literally</p>
<p>had a situation and I think I brought it up in a previous</p>
<p>episode where I was working on a deal. It wasn&rsquo;t like a major</p>
<p>check for us. It was, you know, a six figure check. And they</p>
<p>said, none of the other firms are asking for diligence. Why</p>
<p>should we give it to you? And I was like, how much are they</p>
<p>crazy? And they were putting in more money than I they were</p>
<p>putting seven figures in crazy. And I said, when you ask for</p>
<p>diligence, now that some of these founders look at you,</p>
<p>like, how dare you? Yeah, exactly. They will know in this</p>
<p>case, they were insulted. And they said, we&rsquo;re not giving you</p>
<p>diligence. And they and we walked away. It&rsquo;s like visiting</p>
<p>the house. Yeah, like buy it without this company that Dave</p>
<p>and I called called, you know, well, David was calling it</p>
<p>Theranos 2.0. But this couldn&rsquo;t even explain gross revenue. They</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t, they didn&rsquo;t, it was like gross revenue, asterisks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, if there&rsquo;s one metric on a P&amp;L that can never</p>
<p>have an asterisk ever, the top line, the top line, gross</p>
<p>revenue, the money that came into your bank account, how many</p>
<p>checks came in, I get EBITDA, I get gap, I get it. Okay. But</p>
<p>gross revenue, asterisks. What are we talking about? Open the</p>
<p>register and count the money. And so I just remember asking</p>
<p>the simple question, like, um, can you just take the asterisks</p>
<p>away and just this is a company that two of you were looking at</p>
<p>together. You and I have talked about many times. Oh, really?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Theranos 2.0. Sir, that&rsquo;s what this guy and I and I</p>
<p>learned a lot about Delaware law. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys</p>
<p>have talked about this company. Yeah, well, you in the text,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m shorting. Yeah, we&rsquo;ll tell you in a minute.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll tell you. All right. Yeah, you know what it is. But</p>
<p>anyway, I&rsquo;ve been getting a big lesson here about Delaware law.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called a section 220. Have any of you</p>
<p>ever had to file one of these? It worked out really well. Sorry,</p>
<p>go ahead.</p>
<p>Any of you aware of what a section 220 is or heard of this</p>
<p>before? Basically, in a Delaware corporation, if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>shareholder of any size, not just like a board member with 10%,</p>
<p>or whatever, if you feel there&rsquo;s malfeasance going on, you can</p>
<p>file this 220 in Delaware. And according to this, a great</p>
<p>Scandinavians article on this, the the Delaware courts are</p>
<p>taking it very seriously that if there&rsquo;s any accusation of any</p>
<p>kind of malfeasance, especially financial, any shareholder, even</p>
<p>tiny can get all of the books. And in detail, not board minutes</p>
<p>not top level P&amp;L, like detailed financials. And so for people</p>
<p>who are running companies, and if you&rsquo;re involved in private</p>
<p>companies, too, or this is in private companies, look up</p>
<p>section 220 of the Delaware general corporate law, I</p>
<p>remember at Facebook is because we had these vagaries of having</p>
<p>to control shareholder count, or stuff like that. And</p>
<p>information rights. Yes, we actually kept the financials on</p>
<p>a physical computer that was not connected to the internet. So</p>
<p>the people that wanted it, had to come to our office. And then</p>
<p>we remember them in like a windowless room without their</p>
<p>phone or something. Is that I think that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>they avoided people filing 220 requests. And so just something</p>
<p>for people to be aware of on both sides of the table, that if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re shenanigans going on a company founders think, well, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to give any information to my shareholders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true. And it&rsquo;s not true. Whatever you have an</p>
<p>information rights, whatever your lawyers wrote, is not above</p>
<p>section 220 in Delaware. So just keep that in mind. I got a case</p>
<p>like that right now going on, where founder won&rsquo;t give you</p>
<p>information. Well, it&rsquo;s not the founder, but there&rsquo;s a company</p>
<p>that just sold and they won&rsquo;t tell the shareholders like the</p>
<p>terms of the deal. What? Yeah. How&rsquo;s that possible? Good</p>
<p>question. But it&rsquo;s it just reeks of fraud. I&rsquo;m not going to say</p>
<p>the name yet, because I&rsquo;m hoping that they&rsquo;re going to start</p>
<p>acting in a more kosher way. But it&rsquo;s the most egregious thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever seen. All you have to do is talk to your attorney at</p>
<p>Wilson Fenwick, or whatever one of the cohort of</p>
<p>management of the company. They&rsquo;ve engaged in a sale, the</p>
<p>salesman publicly announced we have reason to believe it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the hundreds of millions, and they won&rsquo;t tell anybody the</p>
<p>terms. Yeah, file a 220 file 220. And you know what, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>public. So then the crazy thing about these 220 is is it used to</p>
<p>be that all of the information had to be private yet to sign</p>
<p>like non disclosures, whatever. And now, in certain</p>
<p>circumstances, I think it&rsquo;s in the best interest of all</p>
<p>shareholders, the 220 information can be public. And</p>
<p>so that is just like a sniper shot to anybody who is doing</p>
<p>any kind of shenanigans. We had a company in the same situation</p>
<p>who wouldn&rsquo;t tell us about a sale. And then I have a call</p>
<p>with the board because I own 7% of the company. This is years</p>
<p>ago. And I said, Can you explain to me what happened here?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re like, yeah, well, we&rsquo;re doing the sale and</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah. And it turned out the bankers were taking 40%</p>
<p>of the sale, whatever. And I was like, Okay, well, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to approve this. And you need my approval. Let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about how we can make this work, because we have outside funding</p>
<p>that the company&rsquo;s turning down to do a sale that everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>losing their money on doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. And they said,</p>
<p>Well, we can&rsquo;t really do that, because we&rsquo;ve already sent the</p>
<p>eight employees over to the new company that&rsquo;s buying it. I was</p>
<p>like, What do you mean, like, we ran out of money to pay them.</p>
<p>So they all moved over to the payroll of the new company. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like, you haven&rsquo;t closed the transaction yet. Well, it was</p>
<p>crazy. Like, there&rsquo;s some weird stuff that happens to private</p>
<p>companies. Yeah, this stuff is always at the peak of when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a correction, right? I mean, this may be a good segue</p>
<p>to talk about what&rsquo;s going on. It&rsquo;s a great segue. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that level of grift happens right before. You know,</p>
<p>basically, we have to rewrite valuations, you know, because</p>
<p>of entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs just take so much. Well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a small, small percentage of them, but they</p>
<p>just take so much leeway in pushing the boundary. And, and</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s other board members who are acting their own</p>
<p>interest. But I solved this problem really easy. I called</p>
<p>the CEO of the public company that was buying them and</p>
<p>explained the situation. He&rsquo;s like, talk to my CFO, a friend</p>
<p>of the pod, whatever. And they said, How do we solve this with</p>
<p>you? I said, Well, this is how much money I have in this, the</p>
<p>value of your company, how would you like me to be an advisor to</p>
<p>your company for the same amount of that value in shares?</p>
<p>Oh, so you grifted? So no, that&rsquo;s great. So basically, you</p>
<p>got bamboozled. And so you bamboozled everybody else by</p>
<p>letting them use my leverage. And then they said, Okay, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make you an advisor. Then I took the advisor shares. And I wrote</p>
<p>a letter and pledged them to my investors. And my investors are</p>
<p>now three x their original investment. And I said, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>letting it go. I&rsquo;m not signing the paper until I get the 250k</p>
<p>that my investors put in period. And then they did it. And now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m up. But let&rsquo;s segue. crazy market pullback, the great</p>
<p>write down has occurred charts from altimeter. Our friend</p>
<p>Brett Gerson, and I assume show a major regression to the mean</p>
<p>for tech stocks as index median enterprise value next 12 months</p>
<p>expected revenue, yada, yada. This includes people like Adobe</p>
<p>data dog, Shopify, Twilio workday. And as you can see</p>
<p>here on the chart, which will pull up, sacks, explain to us</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening here. Well, it&rsquo;s a major regression to the</p>
<p>mean on value on public company valuations in both sass, but</p>
<p>also more generally, the high growth stocks have corrected</p>
<p>more than the indices. So that would imply that there might be</p>
<p>more correction to come against the indexes. I think the growth</p>
<p>stocks have already taken the bulk of the hit. But what</p>
<p>triggered it this week is I predicted and you guys had</p>
<p>similar predictions on just a few weeks ago, that this would</p>
<p>be the 2022 be the year of the correction. And it really began</p>
<p>in November, you had the Fed, you had Fed governors make some</p>
<p>hawkish statements about the about inflation, not being</p>
<p>transitory about the need to raise rates. Then we had the, the</p>
<p>Fed Open Market Committee meeting, this was in, I think,</p>
<p>around December 15. And they announced what they were going</p>
<p>to do on rates. And now this week, the minutes of that</p>
<p>meeting were released. And it basically, it said something</p>
<p>that was completely different than what they announced to us</p>
<p>three weeks ago. And so the market basically just seized up</p>
<p>and went into convulsions. And specifically, what they said,</p>
<p>you know, in mid December was that they were going to taper</p>
<p>faster, they were going to end Q1, sorry, they&rsquo;re going to end</p>
<p>QE at the end of Q1 instead of Q2. And then we&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>quarter point rate hikes in Q2, Q3, Q4. That was the plan for</p>
<ol start="2022">
<li>And then there was additional guidance that they</li>
</ol>
<p>were expecting three more quarter point rate hikes in</p>
<ol start="2023">
<li>And two in 2024. So that was sort of the three year plan</li>
</ol>
<p>that was laid out. Then we find out from these minutes, and I</p>
<p>guess these minutes weren&rsquo;t leaked or anything, they</p>
<p>published them after like a three week revise and extend</p>
<p>remarks type period. But what we find out is that they&rsquo;re what</p>
<p>they were talking about was having a rate hike as soon as</p>
<p>Q1. And not just ending QE, but actually shedding assets, which</p>
<p>is like the opposite of QE. So instead of basically going out</p>
<p>there and creating money, shrinking the balance, yeah,</p>
<p>shrinking their balance sheet. So instead of going out and</p>
<p>buying bonds, they&rsquo;re going to sell their bonds, which will</p>
<p>reduce the money supply. So look, if that was their view</p>
<p>three weeks ago, why didn&rsquo;t they announce it? I mean, my</p>
<p>problem with this is it makes the Fed look like they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what they&rsquo;re doing. Because they announced something just</p>
<p>three, three and a half weeks ago, that&rsquo;s completely at odds</p>
<p>with the statement they just put out. So either something</p>
<p>changed in the last three weeks, and there&rsquo;s been no data, or</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Just so you know, they have a little bit of a track record of</p>
<p>this. So in 2018, it looked like there was going to be</p>
<p>inflation. And Powell tried to get ahead of it. And he raised</p>
<p>rates and the the market completely collapsed. And they</p>
<p>were looking, I think, at Chinese data at the time. And</p>
<p>it looked like you know, China was turning, you know, going</p>
<p>crazy, then China completely turned over. It was a complete</p>
<p>head fake, the economy wasn&rsquo;t rip roaring, inflation didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist. And they basically just curtailed a lot of investment</p>
<p>and destroyed a bunch of value. So this time around, I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very sensitive to not correcting too quickly. But then</p>
<p>the opposite thing happened, which is they probably waited a</p>
<p>little too long. And now, you know, we&rsquo;re correcting too</p>
<p>slowly too late into the cycle. And we&rsquo;re just sort of</p>
<p>digesting that reality. And so I think that, you know, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably to be honest with you, like, actually, like, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>puked it all out, for the most part, in my opinion, you have</p>
<p>to remember, right? Like, the big difference between now and</p>
<p>even 10, and frankly, more importantly, 2030 4050 years</p>
<p>ago, is how many computers are involved that trade, how much</p>
<p>passive money is involved that owns assets, and how much of</p>
<p>this stuff is sitting on the sidelines still in money market</p>
<p>accounts and munis. So if you look at those markets, there is</p>
<p>a ton trillions of dollars waiting to find a home. And</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve now done, and Brad&rsquo;s charts show this is, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>basically chopped the head off of all of these fast growing</p>
<p>growth multiple, the underlying companies have not changed once</p>
<p>until, right, these companies are still growing by crazy</p>
<p>amounts, like snowflake is still an incredible business.</p>
<p>Unbelievable. But the multiple that one was willing to pay has</p>
<p>been there is has been very much rerated, as is a bunch of</p>
<p>other companies. So let me ask you a question. If we&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>from these 5060 70 multiples time sales, and now it goes back</p>
<p>down to 20. Is that dare I say a buy signal? Well, all those</p>
<p>trillions of dollars start moving back in because who wants</p>
<p>to be in a money market? I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know. And I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really call these things. But one really smart person that I</p>
<p>talked to this week, you know, he actually liquidated</p>
<p>everything in October, and November.</p>
<p>And, you know, and I don&rsquo;t know, we talked about this on the</p>
<p>pod. But you know, I was feeling so much tension at the end of</p>
<p>last year, I actually, when I look back on q4, it was probably</p>
<p>the most difficult quarter of my professional life. And just</p>
<p>trying to manage risk. And I exited a ton of positions, all</p>
<p>my pipes, you know, my third party pipes, I basically sold</p>
<p>off except for one, you know, I generated some liquidity and</p>
<p>other places as well. And I was glad that I did that. In part,</p>
<p>because I saw, you know, what he was doing, and in part, because</p>
<p>you know, Jeff and Ilan were selling. And I thought, I mean,</p>
<p>this is just this is crazy to sit on the sidelines and, you</p>
<p>know, be the bag holder here. Going into q1, I talked to the</p>
<p>same guys. And what he said to me, which I think is very smart</p>
<p>is, you have to really look at the first and second derivative</p>
<p>of the 10 year bond. Because when that stops moving, like the</p>
<p>10 year bond is this beautiful barometer of the collective</p>
<p>wisdom of every single investor in the world, about what they</p>
<p>think about long term growth and inflation. And it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>important market. You know, we&rsquo;ve talked many times look at</p>
<p>the 10 year break, even if you want to understand where</p>
<p>inflation is going, we started to talk about that seven months</p>
<p>ago. And if you look at that, the rate of change, so the</p>
<p>volatility in the 10 year yield is slowing way down. And if that</p>
<p>continues to hold, that means that people are really saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a small amount of real inflation, a reasonable amount</p>
<p>of transitory inflation, and we&rsquo;re about to kind of wash most</p>
<p>of it through the system with, you know, 100 basis points of</p>
<p>rate hikes. And if that&rsquo;s the case, then you may see a quick</p>
<p>pullback, you know, in q1, and we&rsquo;re back to the races again,</p>
<p>because of all this other money that&rsquo;s going to say, I got to</p>
<p>get back in. And if you look at all these corrections, in the</p>
<p>world of computer traded algorithms, and ETFs and passive</p>
<p>money, and it&rsquo;s all the snapbacks are so fast, you</p>
<p>correct 20%. And then you whip it back and you go. So I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. I mean, that&rsquo;s one view based on the past. But when you</p>
<p>have these big swings, remember, it&rsquo;s not that every</p>
<p>issue moves perfectly in sync with every other issue. So there</p>
<p>are these call it over adjustments that happen within a</p>
<p>cohort. So within a group of companies, some of them will</p>
<p>trade down much farther than others, the multiple will</p>
<p>compress much further than others. And there&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>opportunities within as there is in any market that&rsquo;s moving</p>
<p>quickly to find businesses that now are prices mature, non</p>
<p>growth value businesses, and they&rsquo;re profitable and growing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of those out there now. And that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the case a month ago.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a single thing in the last quarter has changed in</p>
<p>the underlying fundamentals of the majority of businesses that</p>
<p>are public. And I actually think for the most part, nothing has</p>
<p>really materially changed for the majority of private</p>
<p>companies. All that&rsquo;s changed is what you&rsquo;re willing to pay in</p>
<p>the future for it. And the one thing that hasn&rsquo;t changed is</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re willing to pay in the future for the private</p>
<p>businesses. So the real question, you know, for sacks,</p>
<p>and, you know, for the active investors in the private</p>
<p>markets, which I don&rsquo;t know what to think about is, will the</p>
<p>haircut that we&rsquo;ve all taken in the public markets, spill into</p>
<p>the privates, and it&rsquo;s starting, it&rsquo;s starting, it feels to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about what&rsquo;s going to happen with new emerging</p>
<p>growth companies. But I mean, you guys correct me if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wrong. But there are hundreds of companies that have raised</p>
<p>billions of dollars at valuations that if they look in</p>
<p>the public markets, now, they are never actually going to</p>
<p>achieve if they were to go public in the next three, four</p>
<p>or five years based on their projections.</p>
<p>So to your point, so what I&rsquo;m saying, yeah, there are 900</p>
<p>unicorns right now, 900. And so once you get to look, it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing to be a $200 million company and sell to Microsoft or</p>
<p>whatever. But when you&rsquo;re a billion dollar company, there</p>
<p>are very few buyers.</p>
<p>I just want to point out, there&rsquo;s a huge disincentive for</p>
<p>an investor or a shareholder of VC or private equity firm to</p>
<p>take a big write down on a company like that. And so there</p>
<p>is always this push to what do we do next? And it creates this</p>
<p>certain certainly I can tell you, yeah, I&rsquo;d love your point</p>
<p>of view, but you&rsquo;re this really like unhealthy tension. Because</p>
<p>to take a write down on 900 unicorns is going to cause a</p>
<p>write down of hundreds of billions of dollars across all</p>
<p>VC portfolios in aggregate, because they&rsquo;re not going to end</p>
<p>up going public.</p>
<p>Well, sorry, just to finish your thought, because the end</p>
<p>market is only to go public. There are very few exits. Yeah,</p>
<p>there are no and not billions of dollars, because you have to</p>
<p>think one or two sidelines. Okay. You know, even if you look</p>
<p>at like visa, nobody&rsquo;s allowed to buy these companies. I have</p>
<p>an example that I can tell you, I don&rsquo;t know, mid tier, maybe.</p>
<p>But my point is, when you have 900 companies with a billion</p>
<p>dollars in plus, they have to go public, they have to go</p>
<p>public. And so you can&rsquo;t go public into a valuation</p>
<p>framework that values you at 30 to 40% less of your last</p>
<p>private mark, right? Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t work. You did have to</p>
<p>use tomorrow. So this is an important question, because</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that going to be the case that all these VCs with the</p>
<p>2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 vintage are going to end up</p>
<p>having their day log up these great marked books right now,</p>
<p>you know, the books are all marked to three x, you know,</p>
<p>multiple on invested capital, and now they&rsquo;re going to end up</p>
<p>having these liquidity events that are going to come in at</p>
<p>shockingly low valuations. And there&rsquo;s going to be this great</p>
<p>rewrite down and retrenchment. I can tell you, there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>of examples. One is the athletic yesterday, which had raised</p>
<p>money at 500 million just two years ago, just sold for about</p>
<p>500 million to the New York Times. And those investors</p>
<p>basically put money in, and they got their money back. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a push. So I think you&rsquo;re gonna see a lot of these. No, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>agreeing with you. Yes, I&rsquo;m going to give you the examples.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also your acquisition by a tier comp</p>
<p>acquirer. And so there&rsquo;ll be plenty of those that occur. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a lot of pushes, I think is my prediction of those</p>
<p>900 unicorns. And then for a lot of these SAS companies, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying you&rsquo;re you think that a bunch of them are going to sell</p>
<p>for under a billion dollars, and the VCs because they have</p>
<p>preference, they&rsquo;re going to get their money, correct, correct.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be a lot of these pushes where I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what is it in blackjack, David, when you&rsquo;re playing those</p>
<p>three hands, and you get a push, like, and it&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna live to fight another hand. Now, which we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>sacks do a number of times. And then for the SAS is where sacks</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in your position, because we saw in SAS, all of a</p>
<p>sudden, the private market 30 4050 6070 times top line. And</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s gone back down to 2030 40. So those companies now</p>
<p>basically have three the public markets have but I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>the private market has happened already. Everybody&rsquo;s pausing</p>
<p>and so for the people who raised that 50 x, congratulations, you</p>
<p>did the right thing. If you have enough money to fill in that</p>
<p>valuation, congratulations, though, I mean, it seems like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying it is pretty tough position now. Yeah, you</p>
<p>know, you just raised money at a billion dollar valuation with</p>
<p>10 million of revenue. You&rsquo;re like, let&rsquo;s say let&rsquo;s say, I</p>
<p>mean, like, what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do in</p>
<p>your next round? Because you&rsquo;re burning 100 million a year now,</p>
<p>or 40 million or whatever it is you&rsquo;re burning.</p>
<p>Almost all the companies I&rsquo;ve seen in this exact situation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about have that 20 million, they got a billion,</p>
<p>they raised 100 million or 200 million. And they&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>now saying, Okay, we got to make this last until we can catch up</p>
<p>to that valuation and get to 50 to 75 million. So I think you I</p>
<p>would take that deal as a founder and as an investor,</p>
<p>because it takes out the downside. And now you just have</p>
<p>to worry about catching up to the valuation and you have four</p>
<p>years of runway. They&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>know. Those companies do not those those companies absolutely</p>
<p>do not have four years of runway, I will bet dollars to</p>
<p>doughnuts, they have two years or less. And most of these</p>
<p>companies have 18 months, which means they got to be raising in</p>
<p>six to nine. No, correct. They&rsquo;re changing. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>changing their spend. And they&rsquo;re changing their spend.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not firing anybody. You&rsquo;re not hearing about layoffs</p>
<p>at startups. Okay. All right. You&rsquo;re not hearing about it. But</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re changing their forward looking growth plans.</p>
<p>What are you seeing, sex? I&rsquo;m telling you what I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>
<p>What do you think? I think that the trickle down effect is</p>
<p>inevitable, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s fully kicked in yet. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to take a few high profile deals to land at, say, 50 times</p>
<p>ARR instead of 100 times ARR in order for everybody to know that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a new valuation level. So if you look at the</p>
<p>altimeter chart on set public SAS multiples, let&rsquo;s see, I mean,</p>
<p>Nick can pull it up. It basically it&rsquo;s the SAS index, it</p>
<p>shows median expected value to next 12 months revenue. And</p>
<p>during this sort of late 2020, early 21 period, it got as high</p>
<p>as about 15 times the historical average. Yeah. Well, for next</p>
<p>12 months or revenue, which is sort of that kind of makes</p>
<p>sense. So historically, it&rsquo;s around eight, right? So</p>
<p>basically, all the valuation levels doubled. And now they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>come down to about 10 times. So you could say that if it fully</p>
<p>reverts to the mean, we still got like another negative 20% to</p>
<p>go. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s going to happen. I mean, I think there</p>
<p>has been a greater recognition that SAS businesses are some of</p>
<p>the best businesses to own, right? It&rsquo;s they are subscription</p>
<p>software businesses, great gross margins, they just keep</p>
<p>compounding. So maybe it will stabilize at 10 times. But I</p>
<p>think what we can say with 2020 hindsight is that the record</p>
<p>price levels we got to the public markets in 2021 were sort</p>
<p>of unusual and unique, and probably the result of this</p>
<p>incredibly expansionary fiscal and monetary policy was coming</p>
<p>out of Washington. Now, has it trickled down to the again, VC</p>
<p>markets yet? I mean, the way that that has to happen is that</p>
<p>the latest stage investors, the crossover investors who invest</p>
<p>in both public markets and private markets, they have to</p>
<p>to pay, they have to start paying less for the latest stage</p>
<p>growth companies. And then, you know, all the downstream VCs are</p>
<p>going to start paying less as well. Because, you know, if you</p>
<p>know, the markups are lower, you have to take that into account.</p>
<p>So, look, all of this is underway right now. I mean, I</p>
<p>gave a Bloomberg interview in December, and I think I went on</p>
<p>Maria Baromo show around that time as well. And I kind of</p>
<p>warned that all this was coming. And yeah, we&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>midst of a giant rewriting, because we&rsquo;re realizing that so</p>
<p>much of the peak values we are seeing in 2020 and 21 were the</p>
<p>result of artificial liquidity. And it&rsquo;s what you guys</p>
<p>predicted, you know, it&rsquo;s one of our big, you know, I guess my</p>
<p>big prediction for business losers this year were asset</p>
<p>classes that were highly dependent on liquidity, you</p>
<p>guys predicted crypto would be one of those clearly, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taken a massive hit. I mean, have you seen how much the</p>
<p>crypto markets are off just in the last week? So it&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>for them being uncorrelated. No, it&rsquo;s highly correlated. Look,</p>
<p>the coin is going to be uncorrelated. So the markets are</p>
<p>like a sponge for liquidity. And the more liquidity there is</p>
<p>out there, the more money can flow into a more speculative</p>
<p>asset class. But look, my objection to this, I mean, is</p>
<p>that if you look at the Fed&rsquo;s actions, I mean, I think</p>
<p>Chamath is right that they waited way too long to react.</p>
<p>And during the crisis, they overreacted. I mean, they</p>
<p>pumped what I mean, we on a previous pod, we showed the</p>
<p>assets between underreaction and overreact. Yes, exactly. And</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re I think they&rsquo;re in overreacting again. I actually</p>
<p>think they nailed it in mid December, they nailed it by</p>
<p>giving us business certainty around what the new rate</p>
<p>environment was going to be. And just three weeks later, in</p>
<p>the minutes to that very meeting, they completely</p>
<p>undermine the certainty or the, the greater level of certainty</p>
<p>and predict the predictability that they had provided markets,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve now introduced massive uncertainty. So it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unbelievable. It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re pilots and like, they stalled</p>
<p>the plane. And then they&rsquo;re like, Oh, let&rsquo;s pull back. Well,</p>
<p>no, there&rsquo;s more, they&rsquo;re kind of pulling out the manual and</p>
<p>learning in real time. Yeah. And it&rsquo;s like, you need to just</p>
<p>point the nose down a bit and add a little bit of speed. So</p>
<p>you get some lift, like it&rsquo;s really as tragic that the</p>
<p>performance of our government at every level over since COVID</p>
<p>at the last, you know, since 2020. I mean, it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>abysmal. I mean, first, you have the self inflicted wound of</p>
<p>lockdowns. I mean, the economy is going to take a hit no</p>
<p>matter what, because highly at risk people would have stayed</p>
<p>home and reduce their economic activity. But instead of just</p>
<p>protecting the at risk people, we had to lock down the entire</p>
<p>economy, we padlocked Elon&rsquo;s factories, and on and on. So we</p>
<p>basically shut down the whole economy for no reason. And</p>
<p>states like California kept it going way longer than they had</p>
<p>to. So then the government just prints, like 5-6 trillion and</p>
<p>the Fed doubles the size of its balance sheet. And then now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re abruptly getting off drugs. I mean, look, they put us</p>
<p>on drugs, and now they&rsquo;re going cold turkey. And so I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually like a much greater risk now of the economy</p>
<p>going to recession this year, because of the Fed&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>reaction this week. I mean, they had they had the Goldilocks</p>
<p>scenario down about three weeks ago, and I think they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to take the thing now, or there&rsquo;s a much greater risk of</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Best advice for founders, private companies in this</p>
<p>turmoil. What&rsquo;s your best advice, fam? You&rsquo;re a founder,</p>
<p>you got, I don&rsquo;t know, 18 months of runway right now, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going into this, you know, slush, and you want to know what</p>
<p>should I do? What should I do?</p>
<p>I think Paul Graham&rsquo;s advice makes the most sense here, you</p>
<p>need to focus on being default alive.</p>
<p>Define what that is, just for people.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, you know, Paul Graham wrote this great essay, as part</p>
<p>of what he&rsquo;s a founder of Y Combinator. And, you know, he</p>
<p>has this very simple, you know, framework of looking at</p>
<p>companies, which is your default debt or your default</p>
<p>alive. And when you&rsquo;re losing money, as a company, and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning enormous amounts of cash, your default debt. Now,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re growing fast enough, default debt is a great</p>
<p>strategy for value creation. But at some point, everybody</p>
<p>around you will expect you to be default alive. And what that</p>
<p>means is that the cost of what you do, are less than the</p>
<p>revenues you bring in when the result or profits. And even</p>
<p>then, that&rsquo;s not good enough. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw, but</p>
<p>you know, if you look inside of big tech, I was shocked to find</p>
<p>out that, you know, for example, you know, companies like</p>
<p>Microsoft, specifically, and Apple, you know, these guys</p>
<p>traded huge forward multiples, right, for enormous</p>
<p>profitability. But companies like Facebook and Google for</p>
<p>the same level of profitability, you know, trade almost a third</p>
<p>less in terms of multiple. So even when you&rsquo;re that good,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not good enough to be default alive. That&rsquo;s how hard</p>
<p>this game is over very long periods of time. And so when you</p>
<p>have a moment to really understand how to be default</p>
<p>alive, and you don&rsquo;t take it, I think it&rsquo;s a huge disservice</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t do enough of that kind of coaching that</p>
<p>really inflicts that kind of discipline and expectation</p>
<p>setting. I remember I have a large climate investment, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually the single largest investment I&rsquo;ve ever done. And</p>
<p>so I sweat the details pretty significantly. And you know, I</p>
<p>was with the team in in November, December, for board</p>
<p>meeting and setting up 2022. And my whole thing was, guys,</p>
<p>you have to get default alive, you have to get contribution</p>
<p>margins to be in a certain band, you were we are going to</p>
<p>target this level of free cash flow generation this year. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no ifs, ands or buts about it. And what&rsquo;s great is</p>
<p>the entire team embraced it more marching towards that. But</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t, and they&rsquo;re like, No, we&rsquo;re just going to</p>
<p>grow at all costs again. Oh, my God, I would be freaking out</p>
<p>right now. free bird. What do you have to add to that as</p>
<p>advice to founders who have not been through this before I</p>
<p>built my business, my Climate Corp. We raised around in</p>
<p>November of 2007, we raised 12 and a half million dollars, and</p>
<p>then the financial crisis hit in 2008. And I&rsquo;d say 2 things</p>
<p>were really important. Number one was just keep building. So</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re building a great business, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what</p>
<p>the market perturbations are, you know, the market will value</p>
<p>you at what they&rsquo;re going to value you at. And if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>good business, there&rsquo;s going to be money available to you. The</p>
<p>second piece of advice is one that I know has been said over</p>
<p>and over again. But you know, never raise it a valuation</p>
<p>beyond, you know, what you&rsquo;re reasonably going to be able to</p>
<p>kind of deliver returns on at some point in the future,</p>
<p>because otherwise, those nasty dynamics emerge. You know, you</p>
<p>could raise money at some crazy high valuation, that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>always the best thing to do, because then the expectation of</p>
<p>the investors coming in at that valuation, or they want to make</p>
<p>three times that money, or four times that money, and it pushes</p>
<p>you to do something unhealthy, like bend more than you</p>
<p>otherwise would stretch for a bigger outcome, and put your</p>
<p>entire company at risk. So you know, two things to me have</p>
<p>always been just stay focused on building your business, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let you know, kind of market conditions drive your decision</p>
<p>making. And second,</p>
<p>define what, for you is the best practice of staying focused on</p>
<p>your business, because that is a very general term. What is</p>
<p>Freeberg, if you&rsquo;re going to say the top three things of</p>
<p>focused on your business, tactically means,</p>
<p>I have a simple rubric for value creation in a business,</p>
<p>you know, number one is, can you make a product? Number two is,</p>
<p>do people want to buy your product? Number three is, can</p>
<p>you make a positive gross margin selling that product to those</p>
<p>people? Number four is, can you make a return on the marketing</p>
<p>dollars you have to spend to generate that growth profit?</p>
<p>Meaning, you know, can LTV exceed CAC? And number five is,</p>
<p>can you scale the amount of money you deploy to grow your</p>
<p>business, such that as you grow, the return goes up, not</p>
<p>down? If those are the five kind of things you can accomplish in</p>
<p>that order, you can build the next Google. And so and then the</p>
<p>sixth thing is, can you be a platform, which is meaning,</p>
<p>meaning, can you transition to being a multi product company</p>
<p>that gets leverage out of the user base or the technology that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve built? And so you know, if you can think of revenue</p>
<p>streams, multiple revenue streams using the same customer</p>
<p>base or multiple products, or you know, whatever. And so if</p>
<p>you can achieve those six things, in that order, every</p>
<p>step of the way, every increment you can make across that</p>
<p>spectrum drives significant value as a business. Ultimately,</p>
<p>what the multiple on your business will be is purely going</p>
<p>to be a function of what else is going on in the world, things</p>
<p>that you cannot control. And so if you&rsquo;re driving your decisions</p>
<p>about building your business using that first rubric, good</p>
<p>for you, you&rsquo;re going to succeed, you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>money available to you. Awesome. If you&rsquo;re driving your</p>
<p>decisions based on what the market is telling you to do and</p>
<p>what the market is saying is available to you and money and</p>
<p>all that sort of stuff. You know, you&rsquo;re setting yourself</p>
<p>up to basically be, you know, are you also saying to be</p>
<p>independent of valuation? Yeah, I&rsquo;m always of the opinion that</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t raise money beyond your into evaluation that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not comfortable saying in different market conditions,</p>
<p>or what have you, I can return multiple. I don&rsquo;t think any</p>
<p>founder has ever, you know, most of these founders were not</p>
<p>around in 2000. And they were 2008 or two, but even 2008 was</p>
<p>less important in my mind, because it was it was it was</p>
<p>fast. And again, we had government stimulus. So you</p>
<p>know, like, I think 2008 was an aberrational moment. I was I was</p>
<p>in the middle, you know, inside of Facebook when and I was like,</p>
<p>what the hell is going on here, the government&rsquo;s going to step</p>
<p>in. And, you know, with tarp printing a trillion dollars,</p>
<p>whatever it was, it didn&rsquo;t affect you guys. It didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>affect us at all. Yeah, but you were the most powerful company</p>
<p>or not at that time in 2008. Well, you&rsquo;re not a lot of cash,</p>
<p>right? No, no, but we were here&rsquo;s the thing with that</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t realize with Facebook, Google was profitable</p>
<p>from day one to Yep, we were always default alive. I want</p>
<p>every single person listening to this to understand this. Okay,</p>
<p>we sold poker ads for party poker in big banner ads on</p>
<p>Facebook, and we made money. You got the bag, you got your</p>
<p>independent were profitable. Okay, so I don&rsquo;t buy this</p>
<p>argument. That argument of unprofitable growth is a</p>
<p>vestige of fund dynamics and VCs who want to raise larger and</p>
<p>larger funds to blind their pockets with fees. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>function of what I mentioned before, which is if you can</p>
<p>think about the context of a portfolio of those bets, it</p>
<p>makes sense. But if you think about your business, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make sense. In 2000. That didn&rsquo;t make sense. You could not run</p>
<p>an unprofitable growth business, the money would not have been</p>
<p>there, right. And the real reason is that was a market</p>
<p>check, meaning you had people reallocating capital, because</p>
<p>risk rates were different, you know, you could put money at 6%</p>
<p>in us 10 year bonds. Now, obviously, you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>today. So maybe this cycle is just the new normal. And so,</p>
<p>you know, maybe you can always be default debt and be able to</p>
<p>raise money because the incentives exist. But I wonder</p>
<p>when that stops. And so I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Google was an incredibly cash efficient business. I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve raised under 50 million as a private company that</p>
<p>never used any of it. Because Google, the first the first</p>
<p>thing Google did is they did a massive search syndication deal</p>
<p>with AOL that paid them hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>And that funded the business. If you can sell ahead of your</p>
<p>customers in terms of delivering the service or the product to</p>
<p>them, you&rsquo;ve got the most beautiful business in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the definition of bootstrapping Google, even</p>
<p>though they raise venture capital, effectively bootstrap</p>
<p>the business by getting customers to prepay getting</p>
<p>people to prepay for cars. I wrote this in my annual letter</p>
<p>like two years ago, but Facebook, Google, Apple,</p>
<p>Microsoft, and Amazon raised collectively less than $250</p>
<p>million. Yeah, I mean, what? Yeah, so I mean, I agree with</p>
<p>what a lot of what you guys have said. I mean, so I agree with</p>
<p>Freeberg that recessions or downturns are actually great</p>
<p>times to build startups, because innovation doesn&rsquo;t stop. And</p>
<p>you know, so PayPal was predominantly built after the</p>
<p>dot com crash. Yammer was prominently built after the</p>
<p>2008 sort of great recession. So it&rsquo;s absolutely doable. And</p>
<p>some things actually get easier in a downturn. There&rsquo;s like way</p>
<p>fewer startups getting funded. And so like talent gets easier</p>
<p>to recruit. So, you know, things loosen up in, you know, in</p>
<p>terms of the company building side. The only thing that</p>
<p>really gets harder in a downturn is fundraising, right? This is</p>
<p>and by the way, I think it&rsquo;s a good practice for founders not</p>
<p>to care what happens in the public markets, the NASDAQ</p>
<p>early stage founders, right? Because the only time that</p>
<p>really touches you is when you need to access the capital</p>
<p>markets, right? And then you will be subject to the</p>
<p>downstream impact on VCs of what&rsquo;s happening in the market.</p>
<p>So, so the only thing that really gets harder is</p>
<p>fundraising. And this is where I think Tomas advice comes in. I,</p>
<p>I personally think that trying to achieve default alive status</p>
<p>is too high a bar. I mean, it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing if you can do</p>
<p>it. I mean, Facebook did it, Google did it, the very best</p>
<p>companies did it. But I know very few SaaS companies that</p>
<p>could continue to grow if they had to be cash flow positive, I</p>
<p>mean, at an early stage. So the metric I use is burden</p>
<p>multiple. I wrote a blog about this once. It&rsquo;s basically just</p>
<p>how much are you burning for every dollar of net new AR you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>adding. So in other words, like if you&rsquo;re burning a million</p>
<p>dollars, you know, over whatever period of time, a month,</p>
<p>quarter, year to add a million dollars of net new AR, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually pretty good. So a bundle of like one or less is</p>
<p>amazing. I&rsquo;d say even up to two is good. So in other words,</p>
<p>like if a SaaS company can say add 10 million of net new AR in</p>
<p>a year and burn 20, I think VCs will fund that all day long,</p>
<p>even in a recession to your payback. Yes. But when you start</p>
<p>getting to burn multiples of three, four, five, six and up,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when like VCs are going to wait a second. Yeah, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>that growth is right. You&rsquo;re not efficient, just efficient, but</p>
<p>it starts to raise questions about your product market fit</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re effectively spending too much money to grow.</p>
<p>So like, why is a growth that hard, right? Like market pull?</p>
<p>Yeah, no more. Yeah, exactly. No market pull. I think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good way of putting it. So I do think you have to show like in</p>
<p>a downturn or in choppy waters, you have to sharpen the pencil,</p>
<p>get more efficient about your burn, look at your burn</p>
<p>multiple. And then I think, you know, if you have the</p>
<p>opportunity to top off your war chest, like that&rsquo;s smart, you</p>
<p>know, and don&rsquo;t wait too long. And be frugal. I mean, God, the</p>
<p>amount of like, crazy spending I&rsquo;m seeing in some startups and</p>
<p>unnecessary spending if you&rsquo;re spending something and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going into product, it&rsquo;s not going into marketing. You know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going into sales. And it&rsquo;s not, you know, just you</p>
<p>really have to ask yourself, why am I spending money on going to</p>
<p>this conference going to that conference on this office space,</p>
<p>like really be frugal. I know that it&rsquo;s when you have all this</p>
<p>money sloshing around, you&rsquo;re looking for things to spend it</p>
<p>on, but stay focused. Yeah, I mean, don&rsquo;t spend 7500 on that</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;ve got tons of cash laying around. And we will be</p>
<p>getting back to the people who applied, we&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>through and somebody is going to approve you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add one other thing to this, which is you&rsquo;re right that</p>
<p>like most founders have never even seen a downturn, because</p>
<p>the last big one was a great recession of 2008 2009. So many</p>
<p>founders were even around back then the most the most read the</p>
<p>real one was 2000. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It froze, I would say it froze to that 2008 was what, like 12</p>
<p>to 18 months of choppiness. And I would say a lot of companies</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t raise money had to do down rounds had to do multiple</p>
<p>liquidation preferences. It was gnarly on some cap tables during</p>
<p>that period. And if you don&rsquo;t know what multiple liquidation</p>
<p>preferences are, as I understand, but there was no</p>
<p>real market check. The market check was really in 2000. And</p>
<p>you saw it was a multi year slog. It was a bloodbath. You</p>
<p>had to be vaporized. Yes, people you had to be default alive.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah. But I would say a third of the</p>
<p>startups went away in 2008. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re running into</p>
<p>that again. So you know, let&rsquo;s not create a sequoia graveyard</p>
<p>kind of story. But you could. Nobody knows the point.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a probability of getting your business funded,</p>
<p>right. And that&rsquo;s kind of lower. It&rsquo;s not like, but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing what I what&rsquo;s shocking to me. It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand why people think you can grow infinitely forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not true. Even the best businesses in the world</p>
<p>after 15 or 20 years are barely growing at 20%. People forecast</p>
<p>Facebook and Google. Those are the two best businesses in the</p>
<p>world. But it isn&rsquo;t a question of what kind of growth feces</p>
<p>are willing to finance. No, what I&rsquo;m saying is, if you know</p>
<p>that your terminal growth rate, if you are one of the best</p>
<p>companies ever created ever is 20% in 20 years, it doesn&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>a genius to do a line of best fit between now where you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>100% in 20. And realize that at some point, if you don&rsquo;t figure</p>
<p>out how to make money by selling what you&rsquo;re selling,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who will be smart enough after enough</p>
<p>historical data has come through the transom, or come</p>
<p>over the past to realize that these things are not that</p>
<p>fundable. And this is what&rsquo;s shocking to me. It&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>data is hiding in plain sight for anybody to look at. It</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make sense unless you believe that those those growth</p>
<p>rates of 40 5060% are sustainable for 30 years or 40</p>
<p>years, we&rsquo;ve seen zero examples. And you have to look</p>
<p>at these canaries in the coal mine. Because if if the best</p>
<p>companies in the world can&rsquo;t do it, you&rsquo;re you have to really</p>
<p>scratch your head here or ignore it, whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine. Just wing it. Yeah, it&rsquo;ll work out. Don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about it. Don&rsquo;t worry. Just add like around it&rsquo;s fine. One of</p>
<p>those features will work and save the day. There&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>magical feature. Did you see Andreessen announced that they</p>
<p>raised $9 billion or something today across incredible</p>
<p>congratulations. They&rsquo;re building a Colossus. Yeah, I</p>
<p>mean, there&rsquo;s gonna Silicon Valley in terms of capital is</p>
<p>um, you know, seeing kind of power returns itself, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a few firms that are going to, you know,</p>
<p>control 80% of the capital should go public. Andresen</p>
<p>Tiger, Tiger Global, you know, whatever happens. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if Tiger should I mean, there&rsquo;s a few that&rsquo;s a market. But I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just saying like, if you look at the aggregate capital that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being deployed into private markets right now, in probably</p>
<p>two years, 80% of it&rsquo;s going to come from three firms or four</p>
<p>firms. The problem is if you&rsquo;re running that much money, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>insane to not take your GP public because it&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>way like no, you&rsquo;re not really generating carry at that point</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re generating a market beta return. So you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do okay. But when you&rsquo;re sitting on 2030 40 billion of imputed</p>
<p>wealth by being the owner of the GP of Tiger or Andreessen,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be insane to not go public, I think the odds are</p>
<p>going to be pretty high that Andreessen will go public,</p>
<p>right? I mean, they&rsquo;re certainly setting themselves up to be a</p>
<p>lot more than just a capital allocator, right? It&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>happened. Well,</p>
<p>TPG just thought to go public, they&rsquo;re going out, KKR&rsquo;s public,</p>
<p>Apollo&rsquo;s public, I&rsquo;m talking about Venture though.</p>
<p>No, but I mean, like Venture&rsquo;s never scaled up to the point</p>
<p>that private equity has until now. And now that they have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely, it&rsquo;s very likely that you&rsquo;ll see Andreessen</p>
<p>be the first, I don&rsquo;t know them, you know, very well, but</p>
<p>Sachs, you were gonna say something?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I think it&rsquo;s a super interesting point, because</p>
<p>if you talk to the previous generation of VCs, what they</p>
<p>will tell you who retired, right, is when you ask them,</p>
<p>well, did you get anything for your partnership share in the</p>
<p>firm, not just in a fund, but in the firm, they&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>no, they basically just gave it away to the next generation</p>
<p>of partners, even though they built the firm. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because of what, historically, the belief on the part of VCs</p>
<p>was that there was no value to VC firms, other than just</p>
<p>their interest in each particular fund. But you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right, like if they do achieve a much greater level of scale,</p>
<p>and they can go public, then there is actually value in the</p>
<p>firm itself.</p>
<p>If you look at the terminal valuation of Blackstone as</p>
<p>indexed to AUM, you know, once you pass a couple hundred</p>
<p>billion of AUM, you can trade toward 0.1, 0.2 times. And so,</p>
<p>you know, if you have 50 billion of AUM, there&rsquo;s $10 billion</p>
<p>market cap there. And if you, you know, if you&rsquo;re Andreessen</p>
<p>or Horowitz, I mean, that&rsquo;s $5 billion that just appeared out</p>
<p>of nowhere, why would you not do it?</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s a little bit like Goldman Sachs, they always said</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re a partnership, we&rsquo;re never going to IPO because</p>
<p>And then they did.</p>
<p>And then they did. And same thing with did CAA do it too?</p>
<p>No, I guess.</p>
<p>No, what happened with CAA was Ovitz sold his position to go to</p>
<p>Disney, so there would be a conflict, but he could have kept</p>
<p>it and the like residuals they were getting from projects</p>
<p>they packaged were incredible.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t the RE manual one?</p>
<p>It did, Endeavor did.</p>
<p>Endeavor.</p>
<p>How are they trading? I haven&rsquo;t even looked at Endeavor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>But let me tell you, like, it&rsquo;s actually, but think about if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not like the current, like partner owners of the firm,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re like on a partnership track there and you&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>your way up to partner.</p>
<p>Like by the time you get to partner, it&rsquo;s going to be a very</p>
<p>different economic equation, because instead of getting your</p>
<p>one over n share of the pie, when you eventually become</p>
<p>partner with n being the number of partners or some version of</p>
<p>that, now the company is owned by the public and the public or</p>
<p>the board of directors is determining your salary.</p>
<p>And maybe you get a salary and bonus and some, you know,</p>
<p>essentially options or equity participation, but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be a true owner anymore because the firm is gonna be</p>
<p>owned by the public.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>What if we take each of our businesses, put them together</p>
<p>and then take them public as all in capital?</p>
<p>Then we get the bank.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good, I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We got the startup studio.</p>
<p>We got the accelerator.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even agree on a conference.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re recombining.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even agree on the flowers at a conference.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t agree on the decor and food for our one day event in</p>
<p>Miami.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the amount of work you guys want to do is</p>
<p>slagging me in a slot and a chat.</p>
<p>No, what we want is someone to do the work.</p>
<p>We want to hire a professional.</p>
<p>I have been doing conferences for 25 years.</p>
<p>Stop saying my people.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>And you know what&rsquo;s gonna&hellip;</p>
<p>Thank you for tuning in.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s gonna happen?</p>
<p>You launch Yammer at my conference and I put the fix in</p>
<p>for you to win.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was a beautiful conference, but for all in</p>
<p>summit, is it just the case that we want people to show up and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a stage and people talking on stage in this</p>
<p>whole conference, or do we want to create a more magical</p>
<p>experience, a la Davos or a Sun Valley or something like that?</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in to episode 62 of the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you at the All In Summit.</p>
<p>And if you want to do us a favor, please go ahead and</p>
<p>subscribe and rate us on Apple.</p>

<p>He emailed us and his team and then I cc&rsquo;d him on the email.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it would he be good for what do you think about</p>
<p>having him in Mr. Beast?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s super, super, super.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my idea for a trio him, Mr. Beast.</p>
<p>And then one other person to do a media trio.</p>
<p>Future of media.</p>
<p>What is your what is your assignment?</p>
<p>What is your idea?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even know the third person.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m putting it out there asking for a suggestion for</p>
<p>Mr. Beast.</p>
<p>This is our conference impresario.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Well, those are two great guests on the stage at the same time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure out who besides Jekyll is going to produce the conference.</p>
<p>OK, you guys are unbelievably.</p>
<p>Bye bye.</p>
<p>Insufferable.</p>
<p>Bye bye.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Satterthwaite.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, West.</p>
<p>Ice Queen of Kinwan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avatars will meet me.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Wet your feet.</p>
<p>Wet your feet.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
