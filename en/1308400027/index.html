    <p>Hi friends, I did it. I&rsquo;m in Houston. I fucking moved. I actually</p>
<p>Full-blown ass did the shit. I ran away and I made it and I&rsquo;m safe and I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>Happy I fucking did this. I hope I don&rsquo;t sound echoey because my closet is fucking</p>
<p>Huge and I&rsquo;m not trying to sound like a pretentious asshole, but like y&rsquo;all my closet is massive</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t make no fucking sense. It&rsquo;s about as big as the damn living room</p>
<p>As you can hear a cat came with me, but let me start off let me fill you in</p>
<p>Let me fill you in real quick. So I got the apartment that I wanted</p>
<p>Yeah, cats happy about it</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s gone fucking like</p>
<p>Good with that</p>
<p>But everything else has gone fucking wrong like every little thing that can go wrong has gone fucking wrong</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been here for</p>
<p>Six days now still don&rsquo;t have fucking Wi-Fi</p>
<p>They tried to set it up and the wiring in my wall is bad</p>
<p>So they have to send a technician out from the apartment complex to repair the wiring in the wall run new wiring</p>
<p>Then the AT&amp;T guy has to come back out and set up my Wi-Fi and I&rsquo;m just like motherfucker</p>
<p>Because I have to use AT&amp;T. I can&rsquo;t use nobody else. Like there&rsquo;s some contract with the apartment, whatever</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the beginning of my fucking struggles. If you&rsquo;ve been following me on Instagram, I&rsquo;ve vented on my story about everything going wrong</p>
<p>I just want to do a fucking live so bad on tik-tok and just like</p>
<p>Shoot my shit and like share as much as I can, you know, like I&rsquo;d like to provide value</p>
<p>I like to be of use and it&rsquo;s like I can&rsquo;t do that because my service is not strong enough and then my neighbors Wi-Fi</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t reach to my apartment. So like I can&rsquo;t even use her shit. Her name is Amanda. She&rsquo;s real sweet. She&rsquo;s cute</p>
<p>But yeah, everyone&rsquo;s been saying it&rsquo;s a mercury retrograde and I kind of like don&rsquo;t believe in that shit</p>
<p>But I kind of do now I&rsquo;m like yeah now I&rsquo;m like there is no other explanation</p>
<p>Like I thought I got hexed and y&rsquo;all know that I swore off like witchcraft and all that type shit</p>
<p>So I like pulled my box of witchy shit out. Yeah, I brought it with me. Of course I did</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t bring no furniture</p>
<p>I brought clothes and cat and I had something just told me to bring my little box of like my witchy supplies and I sure as</p>
<p>Fuck did and I needed them already. Like I had to test if I had been hexed. I have not been hexed</p>
<p>So it must just be the fucking stars being out of alignment</p>
<p>Mr. Mercury registry great because the amount of shit that&rsquo;s gone wrong is like</p>
<p>Unparalleled and I&rsquo;m not kidding. Shut the fuck up cat, please. Oh</p>
<p>My god, like I don&rsquo;t know how to I don&rsquo;t want to lock her away like outside of the closet, you know</p>
<p>Cuz I&rsquo;d feel bad like she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s struggling with like adjusting like she&rsquo;s adjusting</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s like being a little fucking weird and she&rsquo;s being a little needy</p>
<p>I am all over the place with this podcast, but I do have some points</p>
<p>I want to make I&rsquo;ve had some pretty big realizations moving so far</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna do a full podcast episode next week on</p>
<p>Inspiration I think and like self-discipline kind of I&rsquo;m gonna kind of touch on that</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s gonna be next week&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>But for this week&rsquo;s episode, I want to talk about like some realizations</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had and just some fucking shit</p>
<p>So I want to start off with the one that I had around finding furniture</p>
<p>And if you listen to last week&rsquo;s episode, you know the hassle with the goddamn fucking couch</p>
<p>Actually had someone reach out to me and said to call corporate like restoration hardware corporate and see if they could honor it and</p>
<p>Give me the couch at the price that they had it advertised and I had a little hope like I had a little hope again</p>
<p>And I was like fuck it. I&rsquo;ll call them but I only was gonna call them because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to find other couches and I just don&rsquo;t fuck with any of them</p>
<p>So I was like, alright, let me just go get the one. I know that I want</p>
<p>Let me just try I call corporate like one of the fucking Karen&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m like, hi</p>
<p>so everybody at the other store keeps dicking me around and I need some help like I need to figure out like I</p>
<p>Need someone higher up to step in and like give me some guidance and help me with the situation</p>
<p>Basically, they told me to go fuck myself and they said no the price is what it is</p>
<p>So the couch is not happening. The cloud couch is not mine. It will never be mine. It&rsquo;s fine. What the fuck ever? Okay</p>
<p>So this sent me on a fucking hunt to go find new furniture and I needed three things when I moved in</p>
<p>So I bought a mattress in a box so that I could put it in my car and move it</p>
<p>I got that I threw it on the floor. I&rsquo;m doing great with that</p>
<p>I needed a desk and a chair because I had awareness appointments and like coaching calls set up and scheduled for</p>
<p>Thursday when I moved in on Monday, so I had three days to go find all my shit</p>
<p>Which was I thought was plenty of time. No</p>
<p>So I ordered my desk before I even left Pensacola</p>
<p>To make sure that I would get here on time and it wasn&rsquo;t a cheap desk. It was like 650 bucks</p>
<p>It was the adjustable one like a tall one that goes like standing and sitting from Wayfair. It was white. It was pretty</p>
<p>It was simple and it came with the fucking crack up the middle. So</p>
<p>My desk was fucked</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any more desks that I liked running around to all the furniture stores and none of them could be delivered that quick</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t find a fucking chair that I liked on marketplace</p>
<p>Like I was like, I&rsquo;m not paying like 300 bucks for an office chair eat my ass</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go find one on marketplace for like 80 bucks 100 bucks, whatever it is and</p>
<p>The ones on marketplace are just not it like for what I just caught a bad timing I guess</p>
<p>With like I&rsquo;m not finding shit on marketplace</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not finding a fuck thing and if I do it&rsquo;s like four hours away</p>
<p>I go to Goodwill and I buy the chair that I&rsquo;m sitting in right now as I&rsquo;m recording this</p>
<p>And it was 15 bucks and it was it&rsquo;s fucking great</p>
<p>I actually like it a lot like I got it just to get myself by but I actually really like this chair</p>
<p>There was two of them and I wish I bought the other one too because they&rsquo;re in like really good condition</p>
<p>Whatever besides the point I needed three fucking things</p>
<p>My strain of luck has been very bad, but my whole point about finding furniture is I needed three fucking things</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t find the three fucking things to save my life</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve gone into a lot of stores and I&rsquo;ve looked at a lot of shit and I&rsquo;m someone that I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>Things that I don&rsquo;t love like if I don&rsquo;t love something I&rsquo;m not buying it</p>
<p>I will not fucking have it in my home if I don&rsquo;t love it and that poses an issue because</p>
<p>My taste is very specific</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very like picky in particular with what I like and don&rsquo;t like so it&rsquo;s a little bit hard to find shit that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>Willing to buy and I went to like a lot of fucking furniture places. I went to Ikea which was fun</p>
<p>I went to Ashley furniture. I went to like the little ratchet like</p>
<p>Furniture for less places gallery furniture. I went to all like the cheap furniture places</p>
<p>cheap ish places and also like the</p>
<p>Upper there kind of places not a restoration hardware</p>
<p>But like I went to all ranges of furniture stores</p>
<p>And I could not find a motherfucking thing that I liked and I was just like goddamn</p>
<p>but my whole realization around all this shit Leo get to the fucking point is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for something special like I need things that are very specific and very particular and are fucking good</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t typically like what everybody else likes. I don&rsquo;t like anything in Ikea</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the shit that other people like I don&rsquo;t have normal taste</p>
<p>But I kept going</p>
<p>Where normal people go and I kept going to places that have the furniture for people with normal taste</p>
<p>And I kept getting frustrated because I&rsquo;m like why the fuck can&rsquo;t I find anything?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m looking in the wrong fucking place</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not gonna find special in normal places and then that unraveled a full fucking realization about everything</p>
<p>About people about furniture about places about literally that realization just like cracked my brain open and I went to town like it</p>
<p>I was just like whoa</p>
<p>Like all the things I started to realize</p>
<p>About that like you can&rsquo;t find special in normal places</p>
<p>And if you keep trying to look for special things in normal places, you&rsquo;re only ever gonna find normal</p>
<p>So what I have to do is look at what&rsquo;s in my control and that is where I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>So if I want special I got to go try and find places where there are special things like I love antique shops</p>
<p>I love Goodwill because it has like antique II type shit if you can find like things in good condition</p>
<p>but I really really love antique shops because they have the shit that I&rsquo;m looking for and I love just going around and</p>
<p>Looking in antique shops like I&rsquo;m someone that can appreciate the life of something</p>
<p>so like I see a piece of furniture or I see something and</p>
<p>I think about like who had it before and like the situation that this was like used because I bought some shot glasses from</p>
<p>Goodwill and they were like fancy schmancy fucking like with a stem like they look like a champagne glass</p>
<p>But they were shot glasses like they had like a little stem on them and I was like, oh my god</p>
<p>This is so fucking cute</p>
<p>But like I just wonder like the party that those were used that I don&rsquo;t even know if they are shot glasses</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just running my mouth, but I&rsquo;m gonna use them as shot glasses. I got three. That&rsquo;s all they had</p>
<p>But I just wonder like oh, what was the story behind that&rsquo;s like I try to picture like oh</p>
<p>What did it look like when these glasses were in use like in their prime, you know?</p>
<p>Like I just love thinking about shit like that. I love things with like a little past a little history</p>
<p>I love things that don&rsquo;t fit the era of now because</p>
<p>There is no fucking vibe of like the</p>
<p>2020s like it&rsquo;s fucking gross. I like shit from the 90s and the 80s and like</p>
<p>Early 2000s, you know, like I just I like things with a little story. I like things with a little life before me</p>
<p>Just not people. I don&rsquo;t want nobody I date to fucking have no life before me</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to have dated nobody before me</p>
<p>But my furniture and my cups can have a life before me. That&rsquo;s it. Let&rsquo;s get clear on that</p>
<p>But yeah</p>
<p>That also like rocked my shit about like finding a partner or like dating or like trying to find friends</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t look for special people in normal places</p>
<p>You can find people anywhere but your chances of finding them are very low like me finding someone that&rsquo;s actually worth the fuck on tinder</p>
<p>Not happening, you know</p>
<p>So just put yourself in the places where you can find what you&rsquo;re looking for be strategic and like if you&rsquo;re gonna put your effort</p>
<p>Into trying to find something make sure you&rsquo;re putting your effort looking into places</p>
<p>That have a higher chance of you getting what you want</p>
<p>Okay, so my next realization is just like my personal thing and I&rsquo;m gonna kind of vent for a second</p>
<p>so when I&rsquo;m down and life or like I&rsquo;m just down and I&rsquo;m sad or whatever I</p>
<p>Find people on social media and I kind of like attach myself to them and I will stalk their shit like every day</p>
<p>I just look forward to their videos and I&rsquo;m so happy and I consume everything they put out just because I&rsquo;m so like obsessed</p>
<p>With them and I look at them as like my new friend and when I&rsquo;m like lonely, I&rsquo;ll put on their podcast</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put on their videos. I&rsquo;ll do whatever just like have them talking in the background</p>
<p>So like I don&rsquo;t feel alone, you know, but I do this a lot with people but something that I fucking hate</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m in like a low point and this person I find is also in like a low point</p>
<p>and then they get a bunch of followers and they get a bunch of money and they move away and they like start over and</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like doing great now because I&rsquo;m still like sad or in the same spot that I was in and like you just left bitch</p>
<p>Like what like I feel kind of like left behind when that happens</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s kind of weird</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if anyone relates but people have said that my podcast is like their comfort thing and I know exactly what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like to be on the opposite side and</p>
<p>Need someone for comfort. So like it makes me really happy that I am not for people</p>
<p>But I just wanted to reassure you that I have not changed. I&rsquo;m not rich</p>
<p>I have not moved away and leveled up like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>Doing okay. I just want to reassure you. I&rsquo;m very much still the exact same person. I have not left you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never gonna leave you and I hope you don&rsquo;t feel like anything&rsquo;s changed except my surroundings</p>
<p>Like I genuinely hope you still feel connected to me because when people that I follow at these times</p>
<p>Like when they move and like do things different</p>
<p>I feel like they change so much and not in like a good way because I feel like they&rsquo;re not relatable anymore</p>
<p>Like I just don&rsquo;t relate to them because they&rsquo;re not in the place that I was and we all have to change we all have</p>
<p>To grow but I just want you all to know like no matter what I grow into</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still always gonna be the same person at heart. So you&rsquo;re safe to feel like</p>
<p>attached to me and come along for the ride like you are never gonna lose me like who I am at the core is who</p>
<p>I am at the core and that&rsquo;s never gonna change and</p>
<p>That leads me into my next realization bitch is there is no rules for life</p>
<p>There literally is you can do whatever you want at any moment</p>
<p>I just got up and ran the fuck away and nobody stopped me. Nothing stopped me</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m totally okay to do that. I&rsquo;m totally okay to change my life at any fucking second</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally allowed to do anything</p>
<p>I want if I</p>
<p>Wake up and I want to go to a fucking sex shop</p>
<p>I can if I want to go completely run away again and move away again</p>
<p>I can actually I just signed this fucking lease, but I can&rsquo;t break it and leave so I can move</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>But my point is like there&rsquo;s no rules for life. There&rsquo;s no structure until you add it</p>
<p>So like when you think about like going to school when you were younger, that&rsquo;s the first time you were really like</p>
<p>Shown structure and how things are supposed to go and you were given rules</p>
<p>You were given expectations of like this is what your life is supposed to look like</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you wake up you go to school you this you that whatever</p>
<p>but that kind of like sticks with you until you break that mental mold and</p>
<p>When I was living with my dad I</p>
<p>Was on this weird routine of like my day</p>
<p>Ended when he got home from work</p>
<p>So it was an unspoken fucking thing</p>
<p>Like when I was younger, it was like have your ass home when I get home and it was just like an understood thing</p>
<p>But it never stopped because I never stopped it in my own brain</p>
<p>Like I just knew at five o&rsquo;clock every day when he got home my day ended</p>
<p>So when he left at 8 a.m</p>
<p>I would wake up and start my day and I would be so rushed and I would be so like flustered trying to get everything</p>
<p>done</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because I knew my day like air quote ended at 5 and what I mean by ended is like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the house now and if he needs something I have to be there like he would just ask me for random ass shit</p>
<p>And like I would have to be there to help him because he doesn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>Understand like the computer. He doesn&rsquo;t understand Wi-Fi</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t understand most shit like cooking like I&rsquo;d have to like basically help take care of him, you know</p>
<p>Like but I&rsquo;d have to be there at the drop of a hat</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;d be fine for a couple hours and would all of a sudden need something and like I would have to go</p>
<p>Help him that never ended that never stopped</p>
<p>so like I looked at my day as like my day ends at 5 when he gets home because it&rsquo;s like then I</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t sit down and just focus on anything like I have to be there and like be willing to jump up and help him if</p>
<p>He needs something cuz he&rsquo;s not the type to sit around and like wait if he asks you to help him</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like get the fuck up now and do it and I&rsquo;m living in your house rent-free</p>
<p>So I can at least give you that, you know</p>
<p>But that fucked me because I didn&rsquo;t want to record my podcast when I was at home</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to do coaching calls when I was at home</p>
<p>So like I just had to live my life very like structured and like set in that time</p>
<p>But after moving out my day doesn&rsquo;t fucking end. I can literally do whatever I want whenever I want and that freedom</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain to you. Like I literally live alone</p>
<p>I can do whatever that I&rsquo;ve walked around naked every fucking day just because I can with the blinds fucking open cuz I don&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>A fuck if my neighbors see me look at my dick. I don&rsquo;t care. I literally don&rsquo;t give a shit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just having so much fun and I feel so fucking free and I know I just made it seem like I</p>
<p>Was really like structured and like my parents were strict and all that but like living with my dad</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t like not allowed to leave</p>
<p>I just knew like I want to try and be there for him if I have to be you know</p>
<p>I mean like I would still go out and do shit if I wanted to go do shit at night</p>
<p>but what I meant was like my life inside the house ended like at 5 so like my</p>
<p>Day stopped and I had to like be there to take care of him if I wanted privacy if I wanted to go work</p>
<p>On editing shit on my computer. I had to go to a coffee shop because he&rsquo;d fucking need something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to jump up and quit what I&rsquo;m doing. I don&rsquo;t have that structure anymore. I don&rsquo;t have shit</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have guilt. I don&rsquo;t have nothing worrying about anybody else. I literally worry about me</p>
<p>I can do whatever I want whenever I want and I keep saying that because I&rsquo;m just so fucking like</p>
<p>Shocked by it. Like I&rsquo;m so happy about it. And I&rsquo;m just like what the fuck literally</p>
<p>I can leave something on the counter and it doesn&rsquo;t move. It doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere</p>
<p>I can leave my shit wherever I want to leave it and not have that</p>
<p>Thing in the back of my head of like oh fuck is that gonna be thrown away when I get back?</p>
<p>Is that gonna be moved?</p>
<p>Like all my shit just stays where I leave it</p>
<p>Because my dad was bad about that</p>
<p>He would throw shit away if he didn&rsquo;t know what it was or like he would just move shit and I&rsquo;m like don&rsquo;t fucking touch</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>but yeah, like there&rsquo;s so much freedom that comes with living on your own and like moving out and it&rsquo;s like the realization cracked of</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re free and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what life to like even living with my dad like you&rsquo;re so free. You just convince yourself. You&rsquo;re not you convince yourself</p>
<p>You have to be</p>
<p>Structured and you have to do things a certain way like so like when I was in school</p>
<p>I was very like structured around my bedtime. So like I knew I couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>Things if I had school the next day, like I couldn&rsquo;t stay out late. I couldn&rsquo;t do XYZ. Like I just had to be very</p>
<p>Proper to make sure like I was good to go to school the next day and that never left me</p>
<p>Like other people go out and get fucked up on a Sunday and they&rsquo;re hungover on Monday</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been fucked up on a Sunday</p>
<p>Like at night because I know I have like work or school the next day like what like I&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>Do that shit, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>like I just I had that around myself for so long and I was so shocked when people didn&rsquo;t have like</p>
<p>Boundaries basically set up for their self like they were just free and they felt free to do whatever they want whenever they wanted</p>
<p>And like they didn&rsquo;t care that they had work or school the next day like they wanted to go get fucked up and have fun</p>
<p>but like me on Sunday night if I have a call in the morning like if I have a fucking a</p>
<p>Coaching call in the morning on Monday morning. I don&rsquo;t do shit Sunday night. Like I&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the house and I&rsquo;m ready to like go to bed at 8 p.m</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t go to bed at 8 p.m</p>
<p>But my point is like I&rsquo;m not out doing anything like my day ends and I&rsquo;m ready to like</p>
<p>Schedule the next day, you know</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>like I just</p>
<p>locked myself into that because I had done it so long from like being in school and then I did it in nursing school and</p>
<p>I did it when I was nursing. I want to make sure I&rsquo;m able to function the next day</p>
<p>So I make sure like I don&rsquo;t do anything but that kind of like fucks me because when I have coaching calls</p>
<p>In the middle of the week, it&rsquo;s like I feel so anxious for the next day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my god, like I need to like go to bed. I need to like have everything ready</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like girl at 7 p.m. You&rsquo;re fine, you know, but that was my whole point</p>
<p>you put like these restraints on yourself or at least I do and I have for so long of</p>
<p>Like you have to do this you have to do that and it&rsquo;s like actually you don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t actually have to like I&rsquo;m choosing to because I want to be like energized and well rested for my calls the next day</p>
<p>So I behave accordingly so I can ensure that&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>But like that&rsquo;s just me in my own head like that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing to myself and I&rsquo;m choosing to do it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to do that. But that was a really big realization</p>
<p>I went to the gas station the other night and there was these guys sitting on the curb and they had a little speaker and</p>
<p>They were just playing music and they were just sitting there</p>
<p>Chilling on a Thursday night just playing music at the gas station at like midnight and they were just fucking</p>
<p>Chilling and relaxing and just enjoying life and that I fucking love. I wish I</p>
<p>Could do that, but my brain would not let me like I have so much I need to do to get like moved in and</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much I want to do for like my businesses and my coaching site and my social media</p>
<p>Like I want to change everything. I want to amp it up and like put a lot of energy into it</p>
<p>and I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let myself like rest and like kind of chill or take it easy because I want</p>
<p>To make these fucking changes like it won&rsquo;t get out of my head</p>
<p>Because I need to like up this shit so I can make an income to like consistently pay my bills because right now I&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>fingers crossed praying</p>
<p>This shit works out but like I know it&rsquo;s in my control and I&rsquo;m gonna do what it takes to make it work out</p>
<p>But like just looking at the guys on the road</p>
<p>Like they were homeless guys and they were just chilling with their little speaker and like</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a job to get to in the morning</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re truly free like they&rsquo;re just chilling at the fucking gas station enjoying the music and just enjoying themselves</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t the annoying almost people that like come up and hassle you they literally were just sitting there</p>
<p>Enjoying their fucking self having a good time and I admired their ability to do that so much and I was just like wow</p>
<p>Like it that&rsquo;s another thing that triggered this realization was like they don&rsquo;t have to do anything tomorrow</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t have to go to work. They don&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>Anything they don&rsquo;t want to do they have nothing they have to go to they have nothing scheduled and they&rsquo;re fully free</p>
<p>Like their day is literally whatever they want it to be, you know, like I know they have certain restraints</p>
<p>I get it. I understand that there&rsquo;s like certain things you can&rsquo;t do if you&rsquo;re homeless, but</p>
<p>There are certain things you don&rsquo;t have to do that make sense</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain things there&rsquo;s certain stresses you don&rsquo;t have if you&rsquo;re homeless</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go work a job to pay bills</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do a lot of things like that pressure is gone off them</p>
<p>and I just admired them for a second because I was like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking nice like them just getting to fully relax and just</p>
<p>be oh</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a skill I need to build that&rsquo;s a skill I need to work on but like I can&rsquo;t do it when there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>I want to achieve because I have this weird sense of like</p>
<p>Leo what if you die and you don&rsquo;t get to like offer as much value to the world as you wanted to before you die</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not letting myself sit down until</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got myself</p>
<p>Somewhat stable and I think that&rsquo;s fair. But yeah</p>
<p>That was my realization around that. So my last one and</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s kind of fucking</p>
<p>Weird so hang with me. I&rsquo;m gonna do my best to explain it. The unknown is good</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s so scared of the unknown and everybody&rsquo;s so fearful about the unknown</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like no one&rsquo;s really scared of the unknown</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re scared of what you project into it and I get that like you&rsquo;re scared of what you think is in the dark</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not actually scared of the dark. You&rsquo;re scared of what you think could possibly be in there</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re scared a little monster that you&rsquo;re thinking is like in the corner looking at you. Someone&rsquo;s about to touch you</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s like what you think is in the dark is why you&rsquo;re scared of the dark</p>
<p>So what you think is in the unknown is why you&rsquo;re scared of the unknown. The unknown is not actually bad. It&rsquo;s just uncertainty</p>
<p>Humans don&rsquo;t do well with that and I know that but my version of like the unknown is good is</p>
<p>If I knew</p>
<p>What it was gonna take to get me to where I am now if someone had laid it out in front of me. I</p>
<p>Would have been like fuck. No, I&rsquo;m not doing that. Fuck that shit</p>
<p>You know like when you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re about to face</p>
<p>Before you start walking down a path</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better because if you knew what was gonna happen</p>
<p>You probably wouldn&rsquo;t walk down it anyway</p>
<p>Like for me to move out if I knew it was gonna be this much of a fucking headache</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would have stopped but I definitely think I would have hesitated and I would have been a lot less</p>
<p>Optimistic because I would have been like, okay. This shit is just gonna go wrong</p>
<p>Consistently and I&rsquo;m gonna freak the fuck out mentally for a bit and it&rsquo;s gonna be a big fucking adjustment</p>
<p>Like I if I knew that was all gonna happen and every little fucking</p>
<p>Micro-detail was just gonna fuck up and every little thing that could go wrong was gonna in fact go wrong</p>
<p>I would have definitely hesitated and I would have definitely looked at this situation as like a drag instead of like, oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited because I just didn&rsquo;t know what was coming, you know</p>
<p>Same thing with my app like if I knew I can 100% say this if I knew</p>
<p>What I was gonna go through with starting my app positive focus I would not have started it</p>
<p>I absolutely would not have started it because it&rsquo;s still one of my biggest disappointments like I put</p>
<p>20 fucking grand into that goddamn thing and it&rsquo;s not even bringing in like four or five hundred bucks a month</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like not even that it&rsquo;s not even that it&rsquo;s not even bringing in shit. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>The amount of headache I&rsquo;ve gone through and the things that I&rsquo;ve like had to deal with with it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even like oh</p>
<p>You learned so much Leo</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I just look at it like it&rsquo;s fucking headache cuz I&rsquo;m good at seeing situations like oh, I learned this from it</p>
<p>I can take this away, but</p>
<p>With my app. It&rsquo;s just been fucking</p>
<p>Little inconveniences and little headaches out the ass and it&rsquo;s just been disappointment after disappointment</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just so like god damn. There was a lot of realizations. I had around it and trying to grow it that</p>
<p>Shifted my mindset a lot, which I&rsquo;m grateful for but I can fucking learn that shit somewhere goddamn else</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t need to fucking go through what I went through with that like I still I&rsquo;m in the phase where I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so hopeless around it. You know like I&rsquo;m just like alright. I guess I&rsquo;m gonna try advertising again</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m gonna try talking about it more, but I&rsquo;m just like fuck like I&rsquo;m just so beat up and exhausted with that one</p>
<p>That if I could go back</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing that I would say like if I could tell what was gonna happen</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it because I started it in a place where I felt so hopeless</p>
<p>And I felt like I needed something to save me, and I thought it was gonna save me and it did it</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean by disappointment after disappointment like it&rsquo;s that app like well like I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>But now that I have done it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;m kind of happy that I have done it because I know what&rsquo;s gonna go in the future</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying given where I was at the time and what I was hoping for I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it</p>
<p>But now that I&rsquo;ve done it, and I am where I am now. I&rsquo;m like okay. I&rsquo;m kind of happy I did it, but</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s see what happens going forward with it like I&rsquo;m still a little hopeful</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be honest like there&rsquo;s a tiny sliver of like hope that it could like</p>
<p>Turn into something, but I don&rsquo;t think it will be quick</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it will be like fast, and that&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>Where I mean, I don&rsquo;t think I would have done it, and that&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m having to live with</p>
<p>But does that make sense like if you could have like a play-by-play of</p>
<p>what was about to happen for whatever experience you are about to like embark on would you still do it and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m like no like if I knew what I was gonna have to go through with so many things</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would have done them like if I knew what was actually gonna happen</p>
<p>I think it would have stopped me</p>
<p>I think I would have been like no I could think of a better way and then tried something different</p>
<p>But that this is the road. I meant to go down so I my new appreciation for the unknown. It&rsquo;s like thank God</p>
<p>Thank fucking God. There&rsquo;s the unknown because a lot of shit would have stopped me</p>
<p>And I would not have made it as far as I have and I have not I would not have done as many things as</p>
<p>I have done had I known the disappointment that was gonna fucking come from them</p>
<p>You know like I learned a lot sure, but I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s uncertainty now</p>
<p>Because it makes me a lot more willing to do the shit that it takes</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>Make something succeed like with social media if I knew it was gonna be so much of a fucking headache like</p>
<p>God damn like I don&rsquo;t think I would have been ready for it</p>
<p>But if I would have been looking at the big picture of like these are all the things that are gonna happen</p>
<p>And this is where you&rsquo;re gonna be for the next year and a half. I would have been like god damn</p>
<p>But the fact that I just blindly went into it which I had to there is no certainty</p>
<p>I just blindly had to go into it, and I just faced each problem as they came up in front of me</p>
<p>I was able to keep going that&rsquo;s really it because I didn&rsquo;t see the big picture</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see that the little inconveniences were gonna keep going so every time I faced one</p>
<p>I just like faced it and kept moving faced it and kept moving</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t in the back of my head like oh</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna do all this for the next year and a half and you&rsquo;re only gonna get this far</p>
<p>You know like that&rsquo;s my thing</p>
<p>I would be discouraged if I had to see everything I was gonna face at the beginning</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my big realization around that and why I no longer want like predictability and certainty</p>
<p>I do at some extent like I do want to be able to predict certain things like good things</p>
<p>I want to be able to predict certain outcomes</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to know about everything that&rsquo;s gonna happen on the way there because I&rsquo;d rather just face it when it happens instead of</p>
<p>Know it all to begin with cuz grab would fucking not do it. That would avoid that shit like the plague</p>
<p>So yes, those are my realizations friends so far</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a couple more, but I just don&rsquo;t feel like getting into it like I&rsquo;m really just like what the fuck ever</p>
<p>If you like this podcast, I just have one request and it&rsquo;s that you go leave me a five-star rating</p>
<p>Thank you so much</p>
<p>If you want to keep up with me all of my social media will be linked in the description of this podcast</p>
<p>Also, if you are interested in one-on-one coaching with me, I have now created an application process</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s no longer just free to schedule. I&rsquo;m doing applications now to keep up with the demand because it just got too high</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m screening people</p>
<p>Basically to see who&rsquo;s a good fit and who&rsquo;s not because I want to work with action takers</p>
<p>I want to work with people that are serious about transforming their life because the shit that I say y&rsquo;all know</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for and where I specialize is with the people that have been looking for answers</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t find and the people that have been trying shit, and it&rsquo;s just not working</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the person that those people can go to</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in that I will put the link to the application in the description box also</p>
<p>And I want to make it very clear that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already got what it takes</p>
<p>To get through what you&rsquo;re dealing with or to improve your life or to reach your goals</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll help you see that and it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot easier when you got me in your corner because that&rsquo;s exactly how I</p>
<p>Want it to feel I wanted to feel like you have someone that has your back and like I&rsquo;m in your corner because that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>It is like I&rsquo;m there for you, and I&rsquo;m there to do shit with you</p>
<p>But anyways, thank you so much for listening. Please stay safe and take care of yourself, and I will talk to you next Sunday</p>
