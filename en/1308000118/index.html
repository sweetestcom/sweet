    <p>Saks, the United States is maybe not going to send weapons to</p>
<p>Ukraine indefinitely. And they&rsquo;re asking them to sit down</p>
<p>and negotiate something that people on the left started to do</p>
<p>and got a got smashed for something you&rsquo;ve been pushing</p>
<p>for. So I guess mini victory lap for you, Saks. What&rsquo;s the end</p>
<p>game here?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;ve been talking common sense about this</p>
<p>for months to saying that we need to be open to diplomacy</p>
<p>because total defeat for Russia also means a good a maximum risk</p>
<p>of nuclear war. I mean, these things go hand in hand. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the paradox of this war is that if Russia faces the prospect of</p>
<p>a total defeat, that&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re most likely to escalate</p>
<p>this conflict into something much, much worse. So therefore,</p>
<p>we need to be open to diplomacy. But it was good to hear</p>
<p>administration officials over the past week say things that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying for months, and that I&rsquo;ve been accused of being</p>
<p>like a Putin sympathizer for. So apparently, there&rsquo;s a bunch of</p>
<p>Putin sympathizers in the administration. And just to read</p>
<p>you some of these remarks, actually, I want to play like a</p>
<p>fun game with you guys, instead of just Oh, really? Yeah, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just mentioning these quotes. I want to get a game called Millie</p>
<p>or Saks. So I want you guys to guess, okay, whether it was</p>
<p>General Millie, who said the quote, or whether I said the</p>
<p>quote, okay, does that sound like a fair, fair game? Yes.</p>
<p>Fair game. Let&rsquo;s put some game show music here.</p>
<p>Millie or Saks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna read you like four or five quotes. And you guys are</p>
<p>gonna say whether it was Millie or Saks who said it</p>
<p>first quote, who said it? General Millie, or Saks?</p>
<p>One of the lessons that should have been learned from World War</p>
<p>One is that European powers refusal to negotiate compounded</p>
<p>the human suffering and led to millions more dead. Millie or</p>
<p>Saks?</p>
<p>Saks. I&rsquo;m going Saks. I&rsquo;m going Saks. It&rsquo;s a very historic</p>
<p>Millie said, Oh, next one. Next one. Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Okay. A regional war turned into the First World War because all</p>
<p>parties made maximalist demands and assumed others were bluffing</p>
<p>it can happen again. Saks. Millie or Saks?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going Saks because of bluffing. You said bluffing that</p>
<p>bluffing is a word that you would use.</p>
<p>All right. That was Saks.</p>
<p>That was Saks. Maximalist. Yes. Okay.</p>
<p>The general would never say maximalist.</p>
<p>Yes. He would never say bluffing. Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>Where there&rsquo;s an opportunity to negotiate when peace can be</p>
<p>achieved. Seize it.</p>
<p>Millie. Millie or Saks?</p>
<p>Millie. Millie. It&rsquo;s very pithy. It&rsquo;s pithy like Millie.</p>
<p>All right. That was Millie.</p>
<p>Yes. I&rsquo;m two and one. Two and one. Me and you. Two for one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deeply irresponsible not to try for diplomacy when the</p>
<p>stakes are so high.</p>
<p>Saks. Saks. That&rsquo;s an emotional statement. I go Millie.</p>
<p>It was Saks.</p>
<p>It was Saks. Damn it. Two and two. Three and one for Chamath.</p>
<p>There has to be a mutual recognition that military</p>
<p>victory is probably in the true sense of the word may not be</p>
<p>achievable through military means and therefore you need to</p>
<p>turn to other means.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Millie. It&rsquo;s a word salad. I go Millie word salad.</p>
<p>Hold on. Hold on. It&rsquo;s a Millie word salad. It&rsquo;s too too</p>
<p>convoluted for Saks.</p>
<p>Saks.</p>
<p>I go Millie. I go Millie.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Millie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Millie.</p>
<p>Yeah. Word salad Millie. That&rsquo;s it. I caught up. Now I&rsquo;m three</p>
<p>and two. Tied with Chamath.</p>
<p>Last one.</p>
<p>Last one. Okay.</p>
<p>It must be our objective now to help achieve a ceasefire and</p>
<p>negotiated peace rather than protract the conflict.</p>
<p>Hmm. Wow. It&rsquo;s so formal.</p>
<p>Millie.</p>
<p>So formal. It feels like somebody said that on the steps</p>
<p>of like a building outside. It&rsquo;s very formal. It&rsquo;s well spoken.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crisp. Can we hear it one more time? May we hear it one</p>
<p>more time?</p>
<p>It must be our objective now to help achieve a ceasefire and</p>
<p>negotiated peace rather than protract the conflict.</p>
<p>Millie. It&rsquo;s a little too formal for a podcast. But in a tweet,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t be so it could be a sex tweet, but I&rsquo;m thinking so</p>
<p>pocket. I gotta go Millie. I gotta go Millie.</p>
<p>Saks.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell Millie from Saks is what we&rsquo;ve learned. What a</p>
<p>great game. Right now we&rsquo;re gonna play the next game. This</p>
<p>is called Bernie Madoff or SP. Bernie Madoff or SP.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, welcome to the all in pod. With us again,</p>
<p>the dictator in a beautiful purple sweater, sweater, Karen,</p>
<p>man, it&rsquo;s the fall season. So I want you to notice the inside</p>
<p>the inside of this is suede. Oh, very nice. Very nice. So</p>
<p>multiple animals killed for your pleasure. Yeah. All right.</p>
<p>What animal do they kill to make suede? Is that like a type of</p>
<p>leather? Or what is that?</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s an endangered one. Actually, that version of suede</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s wearing is from a white rhino. So they just take</p>
<p>the hide and they throw everything else away. Oh my</p>
<p>god. So</p>
<p>can we take this out of the show? These are ivory buttons.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s baby seal fur around the</p>
<p>how many baby seals were killed to make your outfit?</p>
<p>Right. Also with us is the Sultan of Science, David</p>
<p>Friberg racing from the airport. How was that JetBlue</p>
<p>mint? I heard you upgraded to mint. No comment.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t want to talk about the $1200 upgrade you did</p>
<p>to your JetBlue ticket.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to talk about JetBlue mint. Why? Are you</p>
<p>embarrassed to fly commercial? What did you eat?</p>
<p>Are you embarrassed to fly J Cal?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the president. I&rsquo;m like, hold on mint coming through. And</p>
<p>then I start spreading out.</p>
<p>I think J Cal class is like the seat by the bathroom.</p>
<p>In the back.</p>
<p>Hey, do you think you save 150 bucks each way? What is is</p>
<p>JetBlue mint the name of like JetBlue mint is their first</p>
<p>class. Coast to coast. It is so delightful.</p>
<p>What is that JetBlue mint?</p>
<p>They just have figured out a way to make like sleeper seats, you</p>
<p>know, that are very nice. And upgraded service where they they</p>
<p>put like a little wall between you and everybody else. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like having a private plane if you didn&rsquo;t and sax is</p>
<p>here. The whole crew is here. Basically, we&rsquo;ll have a surprise</p>
<p>bestie guestie jumping in in the middle of this. I&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>tell you who will</p>
<p>because nothing&rsquo;s going on this way. Nothing is going on this</p>
<p>week. I mean, there&rsquo;s so much to talk about. Let&rsquo;s just start</p>
<p>with the elections.</p>
<p>And then we have to start with my mayor culpa.</p>
<p>Usually this is like throwing red meat to sacks. But I mean,</p>
<p>at this point, alright, so DeSantis won by double digits in</p>
<p>Florida, he got a huge amount of the vote, but all the Trump</p>
<p>high profile Trump back candidates seem to have lost Dr.</p>
<p>Oz, Dan Cox, just, it was a shellacking, I guess, or the red</p>
<p>wave became like a puddle, or like an eyedropper or something.</p>
<p>But some of the Trump back candidates did win some of the</p>
<p>Peter Thiel collection, JD Vance one. So I guess that&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>win for</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t a Trump candidate, though, because if you remember</p>
<p>when Trump went to stump for JD Vance, he forgot his name.</p>
<p>Wrong. So, so</p>
<p>on your side, you don&rsquo;t need friends.</p>
<p>Anybody that Trump actually cared about turned out to be</p>
<p>just a complete dud and lost. And everybody that kind of, you</p>
<p>know, had to keep him somewhat around just so that he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>throw bombs actually did decently. But I mean, Trump is</p>
<p>just a weight on the neck of the Republican Party. And it&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>to just get rid of him.</p>
<p>Saks, what happened to your red wave?</p>
<p>Yeah, listen, I got this wrong. I think there&rsquo;s a few reasons</p>
<p>for it. So I think when you get an election wrong, you have to</p>
<p>admit it and figure out what you&rsquo;ve what you what your</p>
<p>mistake was. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re not going to improve. I mean,</p>
<p>number one, I was looking at, you know, the RCP polling this</p>
<p>real clear politics where they take an average of all the</p>
<p>different polls, they were adding a factor to it, they were</p>
<p>showing, by the way, plus three or plus four in the Senate for</p>
<p>Republicans, but they were adding a factor to it based on</p>
<p>the underweighting that the pollsters did in the last</p>
<p>election cycle. And it turns out that the pollsters I think did a</p>
<p>pretty decent job correcting their polls. And so the RCP</p>
<p>overweight turned out to be just basically completely wrong. The</p>
<p>other thing that I got wrong was I was looking at the</p>
<p>fundamentals. I mean, three quarters of Americans think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on the wrong track. And we&rsquo;re in a recession. So based</p>
<p>on that, you would think that this would be a great year for</p>
<p>Republicans. And in fact, the out of power party usually wins</p>
<p>in a midterm and Biden&rsquo;s popularity is at historic lows</p>
<p>of like 41 42%. So everything was teed up for the Republicans.</p>
<p>So what went wrong, I think a couple of things. Number one,</p>
<p>two days before the election, Trump basically comes out and</p>
<p>pre announces that he&rsquo;s running. Oh, yeah. You know, this</p>
<p>basically plays into the narrative that Biden has</p>
<p>already created that this is a, this is not a referendum on</p>
<p>Biden, it&rsquo;s a referendum on democracy. And basically, Trump</p>
<p>made it into a choice election, who do you like better Biden or</p>
<p>Trump. And the fact of the matter is, if you look at the</p>
<p>exit polling, as unpopular as Biden is, Trump is even more</p>
<p>unpopular. So that did absolutely nothing to help the</p>
<p>Republicans. And I think it really hurt them at the margins.</p>
<p>The other thing that turned out, I think the other big thing that</p>
<p>helped Democrats was Dobbs. And I never thought that it wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be a factor. But if you looked at the polling before the</p>
<p>election, 15% of likely voters said that it was their number</p>
<p>one issue. If you looked at exit polling, after the election, it</p>
<p>was 28%. So Dobbs turned out to be twice as significant as what</p>
<p>the early polling was showing. And if you remember, Jason, go</p>
<p>back to the episode we did on abortion. I said the shrewd play</p>
<p>for Republicans here was the Roberts compromise. What did</p>
<p>Roberts want to do, he basically was going to allow the 15 week</p>
<p>restriction on abortion, but not have the headline of Roe v.</p>
<p>Wade overturned. And that basically is what to Santa&rsquo;s</p>
<p>implemented in Florida, he basically restricted abortion</p>
<p>after 15 weeks. It&rsquo;s the purple state compromise. It&rsquo;s where I</p>
<p>think the purple states and where most of the country is</p>
<p>going to end up. And the sooner Republicans get their heads</p>
<p>wrapped around that fact that better, they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>long term.</p>
<p>Yes, you one question there, sex, who stacked the Supreme</p>
<p>Court deliberately to turn over Roe v. Wade?</p>
<p>Listen, I mean, there, this was a long term priority of</p>
<p>Republicans. That&rsquo;s not a question.</p>
<p>Well, no, I mean, we do have to recognize that Trump said he</p>
<p>would do that. He did it. So this is doubly Trump&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>Every party nominates justices that align with their values and</p>
<p>it cycles.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s going Trump said he would specifically do it in</p>
<p>order to know, but the president doesn&rsquo;t choose who dies in the</p>
<p>Supreme Court and when? Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s also more complicated than that. Because what this</p>
<p>Dobbs decision did is throw the issue back to the states. And</p>
<p>the fact of the matter is that now it&rsquo;s up to each of these</p>
<p>states to determine where they&rsquo;re going to come out on</p>
<p>this issue. So if you look at there were ballot initiatives in</p>
<p>red states like Kansas, and like Kentucky, Kentucky, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying is there are pro life ballot</p>
<p>initiatives in red states that lost. And so you can see all</p>
<p>over the country that the Republicans tried to go too far,</p>
<p>or they do try to go too far when they try to impose a total</p>
<p>ban. Yeah, but it seems to be popular. Is this what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>is the purple state compromise. It&rsquo;s what DeSantis did in</p>
<p>Florida. It seems like most of the country we talked about this</p>
<p>on that episode. Yeah, most of the countries in the messy</p>
<p>middle, they want abortion to be safe, legal, rare and early.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re willing to support it in say, the first 15 weeks. But</p>
<p>then after that, there needs to be some restrictions that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying most of the country supports that. Now, it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>the case that Democrats, though, are staking out a</p>
<p>pretty extreme position, too, because most of the Democrats</p>
<p>were taking the position that abortion should be legal up into</p>
<p>the ninth month, which is not even that&rsquo;s more radical than</p>
<p>even row, row said that you can restrict it after 23 weeks. So</p>
<p>you know, what we said on that podcast, Jason was the party</p>
<p>that gets the middle first on this issue is the one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to do well, just this issue. Yeah. And I think yes, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s true on this. And I think it&rsquo;s true on other things.</p>
<p>So look, I think the Republicans can correct you&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>easily. If they listen to folks like DeSantis and young Ken and</p>
<p>Kemp, people who understand that they have there&rsquo;s a compromise</p>
<p>here. And the ones who basically insist on pushing a total ban</p>
<p>are going to go down in flames.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of things I think that are worth looking at</p>
<p>now that we have all the exit polling and the results. The</p>
<p>Democrats strategy of helping to promote these extremist MAGA</p>
<p>candidates in the primaries turned out to be a huge winning</p>
<p>strategy, because every single one that they helped put up</p>
<p>against the Democrat, the Democrats won. But number two,</p>
<p>so what that shows is the extreme right cannot field a</p>
<p>winning candidate. But on the other side, all of these extreme</p>
<p>left leaning Democrats also did not do very well either. And so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re back to David, what you said, which is we have been</p>
<p>saying for a while, the winning strategy is that messy middle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the moderate person that kind of like tax to the center.</p>
<p>And this is what you see everywhere around the country,</p>
<p>all of the battle ballot initiatives, every time you had</p>
<p>an extremist ballot initiative, whether it was a complete ban on</p>
<p>abortion in a red state, or whether it was a tax, the rich</p>
<p>policy in a blue state, they failed. And so I think the</p>
<p>message that you have to take away is the extreme left doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work. The extreme right doesn&rsquo;t work. Right. If you look at, for</p>
<p>example, like Kathy Hochul almost lost in New in New York</p>
<p>State, because of who because of like AOC and all of that</p>
<p>extremist progressive rank and file of that party. So people</p>
<p>need to really understand and look at the data on the ground.</p>
<p>If you want to win in 24, you got to be in the middle and you</p>
<p>got to clean up all of this extremist rhetoric.</p>
<p>Freeberg. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>I think the Georgia Senate runoff race that we had in the</p>
<p>2020 election cost the US $10 trillion. And I think it because</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ll remember, that was the race that when the Democrats</p>
<p>won, tipped the power in Senate to the Democrats, and all this</p>
<p>legislation for the last two years was passed, including a</p>
<p>lot of the fiscal stimulus and spending that very likely may</p>
<p>have faced significantly more opposition than could have been</p>
<p>faced, where the Democrats have the White House, and the Senate</p>
<p>and the House. And so that single seat, and the loss of</p>
<p>that seat in the runoff to the Democrat Party, I think ended up</p>
<p>allowing a lot of loose behavior over the last two years, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to cost this country for a very long time. And in part,</p>
<p>perhaps we could argue a lot of the inflationary pressure, and</p>
<p>now the debt load, the US debt load increasing by $10 trillion</p>
<p>in the last two years since that election, by the way. And so I</p>
<p>think one of the most important things that perhaps people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cognizantly recognize, but feel in some way, is that having a</p>
<p>balance of power is really important in this country. And</p>
<p>so to some degree, while there may be issues that folks can</p>
<p>argue about disagree about, there may be candidates that are</p>
<p>vile to us, I think ultimately, folks are recognizing the</p>
<p>benefit and the value and having a good legislative debate and a</p>
<p>good check and balance in this country. And so I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of what Saks is saying that ties into that kind of</p>
<p>emotional conditioning that&rsquo;s probably underway.</p>
<p>Okay, Saks, Trump said he was going to announce he went after</p>
<p>to Santa&rsquo;s called him to sanctimonious. Obviously, the</p>
<p>Trump endorsements here didn&rsquo;t help. Roe v. Wade didn&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>the situation. What is going to happen here? Is the Republican</p>
<p>Party finally going to cut ties? Because they want to start</p>
<p>winning? Or is Trump going to just announce next week and</p>
<p>cause massive chaos? What&rsquo;s going to happen in the</p>
<p>Republican Party in the coming weeks? Because we&rsquo;re 14 months</p>
<p>away from Iowa, right? I mean, this is so now the next issue,</p>
<p>the question comes down to do Republicans want to start</p>
<p>winning elections? Yes or no. And Freeberg brought up the</p>
<p>right point in the last election cycle. He&rsquo;s right that the</p>
<p>reason why we got $10 trillion of unnecessary spending is</p>
<p>because of that Georgia runoff seat, we&rsquo;re about to have</p>
<p>another one where Purdue won that seat on election night. And</p>
<p>then Warnock won in the runoff. Why did things go against</p>
<p>Purdue? Because Trump had a six week hissy fit. After the</p>
<p>election, the Georgia runoff happened on January 5, and then</p>
<p>all culminated in the ride on January 6. So the fact of the</p>
<p>matter is, Trump has been having this extended hissy fit and</p>
<p>living in denial since the loss in 2020. And as a result of</p>
<p>that, we lost the Georgia runoff, I think we did worse</p>
<p>than we had to in this midterm, I think we&rsquo;re going to lose the</p>
<p>Georgia runoff again, if Trump continues with these antics. And</p>
<p>so it really comes down to Republicans, do you want to win?</p>
<p>And look, I know that there&rsquo;s call it 40% of the country</p>
<p>passionately loves Trump. But here&rsquo;s the problem. He&rsquo;s capped</p>
<p>at 40%. Independents and moderates centrists will not</p>
<p>give the guy another look. And so you cannot win a major</p>
<p>national election in this country with 40% of the vote, no</p>
<p>matter how passionate that 40% is, you know what 40% is 40% is</p>
<p>Charlie Crist, the guy who distances beat who wiped out in</p>
<p>Florida, that was a 6040 election. That is what a 40% of</p>
<p>the electorate looks like. landslide. It&rsquo;s a landslide.</p>
<p>Exactly. So the bottom line is that who your messenger is in</p>
<p>politics is incredibly important. And Trump just gives</p>
<p>his enemies way too much to work with. Now, if he weren&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>Republican, it might be different. Take Fetterman, for</p>
<p>example, okay, this guy, Fetterman, okay, he&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>portrayed as this man of the people, he&rsquo;s got the goatee and</p>
<p>the, the tattoos and the hoodie or whatever. Who is he really,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a trust fund kid who never had a job until his mid 40s. But</p>
<p>the press completely gives him a pass on that they would never do</p>
<p>that for Republican and federal were Republican, the press would</p>
<p>expose them in two seconds. Now, that&rsquo;s a complaint. But the fact</p>
<p>of the matter is Republicans have to accept it. These are the</p>
<p>rules of the game. If you&rsquo;re a Republican candidate for office,</p>
<p>you have to be perfect. You have to be focused, you have to</p>
<p>be disciplined, you have to be to Santa&rsquo;s, you cannot give your</p>
<p>opponents something unnecessary to work with every fight to</p>
<p>Santa&rsquo;s picks has been a smart fight that he&rsquo;s won. And same</p>
<p>thing with Glenn Youngkin as well. He doesn&rsquo;t give his</p>
<p>opponents things to work with. And unless Republicans realize</p>
<p>that these are the kinds of candidates we need to nominate</p>
<p>in this media environment, we&rsquo;re going to keep losing elections.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jamal, any final thoughts here? As we wrap up election, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to DC next week doing the rounds high five and slapping.</p>
<p>Yeah, just to finish the thought one other quote from New</p>
<p>Hampshire Governor Kristen Nuno, who&rsquo;s kind of a, he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>Republican who&rsquo;s been in spas with Trump. He said, Listen, the</p>
<p>message of this election is first fix crazy, then fix</p>
<p>policy. If you&rsquo;re coming across like you&rsquo;re crazy, their voters</p>
<p>will reject you. Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t stand for</p>
<p>principle. Ron DeSantis says that Florida is where woke goes</p>
<p>to die. He says we will fight woke in the boardrooms will</p>
<p>fight in the classrooms. This is certainly not a liberal</p>
<p>position. These are pretty conservative positions he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking, but he does it in a calculated disciplined way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this right now. He is a winning candidate. And the scale</p>
<p>of Reagan, if the Democrats also don&rsquo;t figure out how to clean up</p>
<p>their act, because the other message that&rsquo;s so interesting</p>
<p>that I took away is the legislative agenda that works is</p>
<p>actually what Biden has always believed. The problem is that</p>
<p>Biden seems to get distracted or confused or hijacked by the left</p>
<p>wing of his party. And they introduced all these unbelievably</p>
<p>crazy iterations of progressive policy that just are not</p>
<p>popular, even in blue states, just look at the number of bills</p>
<p>that fail. So he also has to fix what he&rsquo;s doing, by the way,</p>
<p>because he doesn&rsquo;t think that could fail the US judge in</p>
<p>Texas. I&rsquo;m not sure you can tell me if this is legit or, or</p>
<p>not.</p>
<p>No, they stayed that what we should talk about that in the</p>
<p>context of the economy, actually,</p>
<p>that was predictable. That was predictable that the college</p>
<p>loans are thrown out is completely unconstitutional for</p>
<p>a president to spend half a trillion dollars without</p>
<p>Congress&rsquo;s approval capital on Jamal&rsquo;s point here to Santa&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one Miami Dade County, which went for Hillary by 30 points.</p>
<p>Okay. He showed that a competent executive a an energetic youthful</p>
<p>operator who actually runs the state well, okay, can win over</p>
<p>moderates and independents and Democrats. Now he&rsquo;s a winner that</p>
<p>these are the types of candidates Republicans are. Yeah,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a winner. He&rsquo;s a winner. We got a we got a call breaking in</p>
<p>here. We have a special bestie guest. You know, it&rsquo;s been a big</p>
<p>news week. It&rsquo;s not just the elections, FTX, crypto exchange</p>
<p>went belly up. And we thought, well, let&rsquo;s bring somebody in</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s super credible in crypto. And that&rsquo;s friend of the pod.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s credible because he&rsquo;s wearing a tie. Yeah. Hey, Brian</p>
<p>Armstrong. How are you doing, Brian Armstrong? You look</p>
<p>fantastic. What are you testifying today? I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>great. It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not Moncler. And it&rsquo;s not Laura</p>
<p>Piana. You know, normally, I just I just wear the black t</p>
<p>shirt and the hoodie. But you know, when times like this, I</p>
<p>got to go talk to media policymakers, regulators, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a good time to, you know, spruce up the image. This</p>
<p>is a week to break out the tie. Yeah. Hey, listen, men&rsquo;s</p>
<p>warehouse. It never looked better. You look great. Thank</p>
<p>you. I see a red tie and I think fiscally responsible.</p>
<p>I guess Brian just to kick it off. FTX in spectacular fashion</p>
<p>blew up this week. And it&rsquo;s pretty gnarly. You run an</p>
<p>exchange as well. What&rsquo;s your take on what happened with FTX?</p>
<p>And then what is your position in terms of making sure your</p>
<p>customers understand that Coinbase is not going to have a</p>
<p>similar fate to all the other exchanges that seem to be</p>
<p>blowing up every couple of months? Yeah. Well, first of</p>
<p>all, I mean, I think we were all shocked that somebody like Sam</p>
<p>who seemingly is so smart and and capable ended up in this</p>
<p>really the situation where he appears to have done something</p>
<p>quite unethical and illegal. So you know, my job right now this</p>
<p>week has been to go out there and just help people understand</p>
<p>that Coinbase is not like that we&rsquo;ve been pursuing a different</p>
<p>strategy for the last 10 years. We&rsquo;re a public company, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re regulated, our financial statements are audited, they can</p>
<p>show that, you know, customer funds are segregated, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>backed one to one, we&rsquo;re not investing customer assets</p>
<p>without their explicit direction. And so that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>the first step is just to make sure people understand that. But</p>
<p>then after that, we need to kind of think about how we go forward</p>
<p>as an industry here and both take a long term perspective,</p>
<p>make sure the good companies in the space aren&rsquo;t allowing one or</p>
<p>two bad actors to kind of mess it up for everybody else. And it</p>
<p>feeds into the whole regulatory story too, because companies</p>
<p>like Coinbase are already regulated, but we&rsquo;re regulated</p>
<p>like a traditional financial service business. But we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have clarity about the crypto specific regulations, like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a commodity, what&rsquo;s the security, and that lack of</p>
<p>regulatory clarity, I believe, has pushed a lot of this</p>
<p>business offshore to these less regulated exchanges. That&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>of what caused the blow up today. They were based in the</p>
<p>Bahamas, you know, and they just there&rsquo;s not sophisticated</p>
<p>financial regulators overseeing what they were doing.</p>
<p>Brian, there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack. But maybe we can just take a</p>
<p>step back and for the uninitiated, or for the person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s only been just following this very superficially, can you</p>
<p>just, in a nutshell, explain what happened?</p>
<p>Yeah, so my understanding is, and again, this is from people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to, and I spoke with Sam and CVC briefly during this,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t get details from them. I got it from other</p>
<p>people. You spoke to them this week. Yeah, I mean, this was all</p>
<p>going down. I mean, I spoke to Sam about, you know, he was</p>
<p>trying to raise emergency financing and things like that.</p>
<p>And I spoke to CZ about why he was considering buying the</p>
<p>asset. I thought it was a bad idea.</p>
<p>But my understanding of what happened at this point, and</p>
<p>again, I don&rsquo;t have all the facts. This is just my</p>
<p>understanding is that, you know, FTX was in a position where they</p>
<p>had this market maker Alameda that was investing in risky</p>
<p>things. And that&rsquo;s fine, like market makers, hedge funds,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re designed to take more risk. It appears at this point</p>
<p>that back during the last shakeup in the crypto industry</p>
<p>where you know, Terra Luna and Voyager and Celsius and three</p>
<p>arrows went under, it appears that Alameda took a big loss at</p>
<p>that time as well. They may have even been underwater. And</p>
<p>instead of just saying, Hey, you know, this hedge funds gonna</p>
<p>blow up to which would have been unfortunate people would, you</p>
<p>know, Sam would have lost money. It&rsquo;s embarrassing, but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>illegal for a hedge fund to blow up. It happens with some</p>
<p>regularity. Instead of just letting it blow up. It seems</p>
<p>like at this point, he took customer funds,</p>
<p>but you have to explain he also he owns both. That&rsquo;s for the</p>
<p>people that may not understand that. Right. So it&rsquo;s a related</p>
<p>party. He owns his own exchange called FTX. And he owns his own</p>
<p>hedge fund called Alameda,</p>
<p>which operates inside of FTX, as well as in other places, right.</p>
<p>But again, Alameda seems to have blown up. Sorry, Brian, back to</p>
<p>you. Yeah, so it seems that they had this solvency issue. And</p>
<p>instead of just letting it blow up, Sam basically said, Hey, we</p>
<p>have a bunch of customer assets over here at FTX, or he somehow</p>
<p>basically made a loan from FTX into Alameda to try to prop it</p>
<p>up. I don&rsquo;t know why he did that. I mean, that that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>moment in my mind where he crossed the line into probably</p>
<p>committing fraud. And I think he probably lied to users lied to</p>
<p>investors. And he went around and tried to bail out these</p>
<p>different companies like like Voyager and BlockFi and to sort</p>
<p>of prop up this thing. And maybe he thought he could trade his</p>
<p>way out of it or something. I&rsquo;m not sure. But that seems to be</p>
<p>where the mistake was made.</p>
<p>Brian, can I ask one question, which I which I think will help</p>
<p>frame the contagion risk set of questions that everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>having. When people have an asset, we all talk about</p>
<p>customer deposits and customer assets held at these exchanges.</p>
<p>But those assets and those deposits are very often some</p>
<p>form of coin, I have some amount of Bitcoin, some amount of</p>
<p>ether, some amount of something else. Is it the case that there</p>
<p>is an assumption of total asset value that&rsquo;s held in a in a</p>
<p>portfolio of coins that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily match the individual</p>
<p>users accounts. And then when one coin goes down in value</p>
<p>nominally to dollars, that the whole value of the portfolio</p>
<p>goes down, and now you can&rsquo;t actually make the customers</p>
<p>whole. So in the statements that have been made by these guys and</p>
<p>other exchanges, that we have enough liquidity to cover</p>
<p>customers accounts, that the assumption might be we have</p>
<p>enough liquidity, if you assume the current market price for a</p>
<p>whole bunch of different coins. But then if one coin tanks, the</p>
<p>total liquidity tanks, and they don&rsquo;t actually have it matched</p>
<p>up correctly, because now the customer account value didn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>down as much as the exchange of the total asset value. Does that</p>
<p>make sense? And is that part of the contagion risk that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on here is that they&rsquo;re not matched truly between customer</p>
<p>accounts, and the exchanges, you know, holding of coins, so not</p>
<p>exactly. Okay, so if you&rsquo;re a regulated financial service</p>
<p>business, that&rsquo;s but you&rsquo;re not a bank, you know, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>regulated as a trust company, a money transmitter, etc. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>required to hold customer assets, one for one, and</p>
<p>denominated in the the asset. So in other words, if you say the</p>
<p>customer has one Bitcoin, you have to hold one Bitcoin, if</p>
<p>they say they have $100, you have to hold $100. And so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the case with Coinbase, you don&rsquo;t have to take our word for</p>
<p>it, by the way, you can look at our audited public financial</p>
<p>statements as a public company, with an independent, you know,</p>
<p>big four accounting firm who went to go verify all of that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what various custodians and exchanges, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they all should be doing. If, by the way, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>regulated as a bank, you can actually go invest some of</p>
<p>those, but there&rsquo;s very strict regulation around that and</p>
<p>capital requirements and whatnot, and we&rsquo;re not a bank.</p>
<p>So we hold one to one. Now, if you&rsquo;re an investment fund, or a</p>
<p>hedge fund, or something like that, then you can try to take</p>
<p>positions in different coins and different assets, and they could</p>
<p>go up and they could go down, you know, you may you may lose</p>
<p>your investors money, but there&rsquo;s no such thing as the</p>
<p>customer assets being involved in that there needs to be clear</p>
<p>segregation of those customer funds. And from from what an</p>
<p>investment fund would be or corporate funds. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they got in trouble. They basically co mingled customer</p>
<p>funds with their hedge fund.</p>
<p>Classic. Can you explain the contagion, by the way, just so</p>
<p>we can, because everyone&rsquo;s been talking about the contagion and</p>
<p>understanding what&rsquo;s next. So that&rsquo;s what I just want to Yeah,</p>
<p>because I think people are gonna be asking that a lot this</p>
<p>weekend.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I do think there&rsquo;s, there is some contagion risk</p>
<p>here. I think there&rsquo;s other firms that had, first of all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s firms that had money just sitting in FTX. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>now going through bankruptcy court. So that&rsquo;s been bad. I</p>
<p>mean, multi coin came out publicly and said that they had</p>
<p>10% of their portfolio sorted on FTX. There&rsquo;s other firms that</p>
<p>Alameda may have had loans with. And those firms are probably</p>
<p>struggling. I, you know, I don&rsquo;t want to say who, but we have</p>
<p>received a couple of inbound calls from other people trying</p>
<p>to get emergency financing. There&rsquo;s people who may have just</p>
<p>totally different from FTX and Alameda, they may have just had</p>
<p>their own portfolio that they took margin or leverage on to</p>
<p>buy crypto. And now as the prices have come down a little</p>
<p>bit, they&rsquo;re getting stopped out. So that&rsquo;s all been very</p>
<p>challenging. And I, again, just for the sake of clarity, I</p>
<p>should say that Coinbase did not have any material exposure to</p>
<p>Alameda, FTX or FTT token.</p>
<p>Can we just talk about this issue of customer deposits,</p>
<p>because this is really the crux of the issue from a legal</p>
<p>standpoint, right? I mean, I remember when I was doing PayPal</p>
<p>like 22 years ago, and the company was like six months away</p>
<p>from running out of money. I remember the lawyers told us</p>
<p>really clearly, you cannot use customer deposits to fund the</p>
<p>operating expenses of your business. In other words, if</p>
<p>this business ends up going bankrupt, you&rsquo;ll still have all</p>
<p>the customer money there and they&rsquo;ll be able to get it back.</p>
<p>And you know, it was really clear, like, hey, if you use</p>
<p>customer funds to pay for the burn of the business to operate</p>
<p>the business, that is a do not pass go go directly to jail type</p>
<p>offense. And so like, that&rsquo;s really the heart of this. Now, I</p>
<p>read in some articles covering this, that the way it worked, is</p>
<p>that Alameda had a bunch of these FTT, or these FTX FTF</p>
<p>calls FTT. And they basically use that as like a marker as</p>
<p>collateral. So they basically borrowed, what is it like 6</p>
<p>billion of customer funds from FTX, and then they use their own</p>
<p>token to then as collateral. So stop it. Yeah, exactly. And then</p>
<p>what happened is apparently like CZ got wind of this. And he</p>
<p>owned a whole bunch of these tokens. And he signaled that he</p>
<p>was going to dump it and the price basically went down. And</p>
<p>so now all of a sudden, the collateral for the customer</p>
<p>loans was insufficient. And then there was a run on the bank. And</p>
<p>by the way, this has happened. This happens in the public</p>
<p>markets a lot as well. So like when you see heavily shorted</p>
<p>names, or when you know that certain hedge funds are on the</p>
<p>brink, other hedge funds will go in and essentially force a</p>
<p>margin call and a stop out because then it&rsquo;s what causes</p>
<p>all of these runs. And if you look actually inside a GameStop,</p>
<p>the reason why you got all this gamification in the GameStock</p>
<p>equity and a bunch of these other names was in part because</p>
<p>of this dynamic folks that are highly levered, folks that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the right matching of risk. And what happens is they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>solvent, but a liquid. And then if you run the instrument into</p>
<p>the ground, they both become insolvent and illiquid all at</p>
<p>the same time. And the whole thing explodes. So Brian, the</p>
<p>question is, now that we know what happened, which is all of</p>
<p>these crazy inner party related transactions, and, you know, all</p>
<p>of this stuff seems very illegal. There was a bankruptcy</p>
<p>filing today. And up until today, it seemed like this issue</p>
<p>was really about FTX International and Alameda and it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t touch FTX us, which for a lot, a long time tried to</p>
<p>position itself as, you know, well run and regulated as coin</p>
<p>based to be, you know, they tried to say that. But now, if</p>
<p>you look inside the Wall Street Journal, all the articles say</p>
<p>that this is actually FTX group. So the whole thing seems to be</p>
<p>imperiled. Can you just help us explain that? Because there now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of us people that were following the rules</p>
<p>thinking that this thing was matched one to one that may be</p>
<p>also affected? Yeah. So look, I don&rsquo;t know who inside FTX is and</p>
<p>its orbit of companies actually knew that the fraud had been</p>
<p>taking place. I, it would not surprise me. I have no idea, to</p>
<p>be honest, but it would not surprise me if FTX us people and</p>
<p>employees had no idea that this was happening. I&rsquo;m imagining if</p>
<p>Sam was doing when he when he started doing this, he probably</p>
<p>wanted to keep it to a very small group. Otherwise, this is</p>
<p>the kind of thing that leaks and the whole thing blows up. Now</p>
<p>that being said, I don&rsquo;t necessarily think FTX us is</p>
<p>worth anything as a business right now because of the brand</p>
<p>being so tainted. And there probably was not great</p>
<p>separation of these entities in the sense of, you know, like,</p>
<p>did they have truly separate boards and beneficial owners and</p>
<p>governance and it Sam seems to have, you know, it appears that</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t FTX didn&rsquo;t really have a CFO or maybe even like a</p>
<p>real board or anything like that. And so it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>we found on Reddit, there was an article that appeared that said</p>
<p>that the head of compliance at FTX was also the head of</p>
<p>compliance at a poker site called ultimate bet, which in</p>
<p>the 2010s, did this exact thing, apparently some version of this</p>
<p>where they went in and they looked at whole cards of poker</p>
<p>players. And then a few employees inside the business</p>
<p>would basically play against these folks knowing what the</p>
<p>whole cards were, ran this cheat stole millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Somehow, that person found a way to be head of compliance at</p>
<p>FTX. Yeah, 10 years later, which is incredible. But back to this</p>
<p>question. So, so now what happens now is you have the</p>
<p>international business, and the US business and Alameda research</p>
<p>all rolled up into this one frozen entity, right? With now</p>
<p>regulators having to so do you know what happens in a process</p>
<p>like this? Like, is it that the the DOJ and the SEC get</p>
<p>priority? Or is there some international monetary like who</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s who unwinds all of this? How do people get their money</p>
<p>back, if at all?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m not an expert at this. But my high level</p>
<p>understanding is that the bankruptcy courts will</p>
<p>essentially, and I believe they filed bankruptcy in the US,</p>
<p>which is an interesting thing. I didn&rsquo;t know why they did that</p>
<p>versus Bahamas. But anyway, the bankruptcy court will basically</p>
<p>go through and try to find any assets of value. So I mean, they</p>
<p>must they still have some tokens and value, they have a venture</p>
<p>portfolio, they, you know, I think Sam owns 9% of Robin Hood,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s various things that they may own. And then they&rsquo;ll kind</p>
<p>of auction those off to various bidders on distressed assets,</p>
<p>and then try to distribute those funds to the customers. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know the exact process beyond that, though.</p>
<p>I mean, if you remember, the Madoff wind down took many</p>
<p>years. And for years, he was trying to find assets, and then</p>
<p>he found a market sold them. There&rsquo;s this the trustee, I</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s still active. And then, you know, it&rsquo;s tried to</p>
<p>redistribute the funds, obviously, so many more</p>
<p>customers here than there was with Madoff. But it can be a</p>
<p>very long and winding process to identify all the assets, then</p>
<p>run the market sale process on them, then figure out who gets</p>
<p>what first, and then distribute.</p>
<p>There was an interesting thing that Larry Summers did, I think</p>
<p>for Bloomberg, where he was asked whether this was Lehman or</p>
<p>Enron. And he said, it seems more like an Enron than it is a</p>
<p>Lehman. And Brian, I&rsquo;m just curious how you think about it.</p>
<p>Like, is this sort of a fraud perpetuated by a group of</p>
<p>executives to essentially take advantage of a situation? Or do</p>
<p>you think that this is more like a Lehman situation, which is a</p>
<p>well run business, I guess that just, you know, got caught in a</p>
<p>liquidity trap?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s my guess is it&rsquo;s a little more like Enron in the</p>
<p>sense that I mean, yes, they were over levered and that kind</p>
<p>of thing. But the minute that they moved customer funds in</p>
<p>some way, shape or form, to backstop the hedge fund that</p>
<p>that was, in my mind, fraud. And, you know, that&rsquo;s more like</p>
<p>Enron.</p>
<p>Do you think now that we have to open the gates on regulation,</p>
<p>like the whole point of crypto in some ways was, you know, trust</p>
<p>nobody. And, you know, decentralization is the key. But</p>
<p>here, what we see is a lot of people were tricked into</p>
<p>trusting FTX and having their deposits there. And it was a</p>
<p>centralized exchange, which caused all these problems. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it almost violates the principles of what the whole</p>
<p>product market fit was supposed to be. So what what should sort</p>
<p>of the observer expect? And what do you expect as a business in</p>
<p>terms of how governments now react to all of this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s really important to distinguish between</p>
<p>the centralized players in crypto, which are custodians,</p>
<p>exchanges, etc. Coinbase has a big business there. And the</p>
<p>decentralized players, which are, you know, self custodial</p>
<p>wallets, DeFi protocols, web three, that whole world. So the</p>
<p>centralized players should be regulated. And today, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>regulated already, like, like kind of traditional financial</p>
<p>service businesses, but they don&rsquo;t have the regulation clear</p>
<p>when it comes to the crypto aspects. So for instance, in the</p>
<p>US, we actually don&rsquo;t still have clarity about what is a</p>
<p>commodity, what&rsquo;s the security should, which one should CFTC</p>
<p>regulator versus SEC, that kind of thing. And that lack of</p>
<p>regulatory clarity, and frankly, the the climate of regulation by</p>
<p>enforcement, the negative rhetoric from, you know, chair</p>
<p>Gensler, in particular, has created this sort of chilling</p>
<p>effect in the US that has pushed a lot of that centralized</p>
<p>actors activity offshore. In fact, 95% of the trading volume</p>
<p>in crypto is now outside the United States. And it&rsquo;s come</p>
<p>down a lot since the beginning of this year, even. Now, the</p>
<p>decentralized players, self custodial wallets, DeFi web</p>
<p>three, this is where crypto really has an opportunity to</p>
<p>make a more fair and free and transparent system because you</p>
<p>can go look at any smart contract to see exactly what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s doing. Anybody can audit the code. If you have a self</p>
<p>custodial wallet, you can just trust yourself, you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to trust any other intermediary out there. And that&rsquo;s where you</p>
<p>get true decentralization. And I think that&rsquo;s actually now those</p>
<p>areas still have a couple of their own challenges. You know,</p>
<p>sometimes people will lose their password or their phone, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll lose their own money. So if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re trusting</p>
<p>yourself, you still have the you have trust, you know, that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do that piece correctly. But there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>good things we can do there around making social recovery</p>
<p>mechanisms and NPC wallets and things like that.</p>
<p>We remember just a couple of months ago, Gary Gensler started</p>
<p>saying, Hey, these things are all securities. And you went and</p>
<p>visit the SEC a couple years ago, or you try to they wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>meet with you. You were very public, you did a tweetstorm. We</p>
<p>talked about this on my other pod, that, hey, like, we want to</p>
<p>meet, we want to talk about that. Now, we&rsquo;re still in a</p>
<p>position where the SEC is position is these are all</p>
<p>securities, which means the anything that&rsquo;s trading, it</p>
<p>would have to be limited to accredited investors, etc. What</p>
<p>should the United States do here? And how close are we to</p>
<p>getting clarity? Because I know you&rsquo;re trying to talk to the SEC</p>
<p>directly about can we just get some clarity here? Can people</p>
<p>buy these tokens or not? What is the status of are they tokens?</p>
<p>Are they securities? Or are they not here in the United States?</p>
<p>Yeah. So luckily, since then, we have had a lot of productive</p>
<p>dialogue with both the SEC and the CFTC and Treasury and all</p>
<p>kinds of people in Congress. And I do think the US is making some</p>
<p>steps in the right direction. There was actually there was a</p>
<p>bill going through Congress recently called the DC CPA, or</p>
<p>the staff now Bozeman bill, although it&rsquo;s having some</p>
<p>challenges now, frankly, due to this FTX blow up, because SPF</p>
<p>was one of the people sort of pushing that bill forward. But</p>
<p>regardless of that, the sort of system that we should have is</p>
<p>there should be a clear designation between what is a</p>
<p>crypto commodity, and that can be regulated by the CFTC. And</p>
<p>what is a crypto security? Now, this is one of those legal, by</p>
<p>the way, what is also a stable coin and artwork and other</p>
<p>things that are not any of those things. The challenge lies</p>
<p>in that there&rsquo;s kind of a fuzzy line between what is a commodity</p>
<p>and what is a security. And a lot of this law is based around</p>
<p>the Howie test, which says a security is an investment in a</p>
<p>common enterprise with an expectation of profit. And so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a point based system. And in the absence of</p>
<p>really getting a clear list between the CFTC and the SEC or</p>
<p>in this turf battle, I would love it if you know, they could</p>
<p>basically put out a list, get their heads together and put out</p>
<p>a list, hey, CFTC is going to do these SEC is going to do these a</p>
<p>bunch maybe are in the middle, let&rsquo;s let the courts figure that</p>
<p>out or whatever. But that just hasn&rsquo;t happened. And it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a missed opportunity in the US.</p>
<p>So if the Howie test is not perfect, given the dynamic</p>
<p>nature of cryptocurrencies and all the innovation, if Brian</p>
<p>Armstrong was going to say, Hey, this is in the best interest of</p>
<p>Americans, balancing, you know, some amount of security and</p>
<p>safety for people making bets on this currency, and allowing</p>
<p>innovation, what would you say is the best definition, the best</p>
<p>way for us to regulate crypto coins, putting NFTs aside,</p>
<p>putting downside just specifically,</p>
<p>actually, hold on, hold on, let me just tweak your question.</p>
<p>Sure, build on it, because we because we should switch to SPF</p>
<p>as well and just talk about the person. But to me, it seems the</p>
<p>whole issue if you come back, like what is the first string</p>
<p>that you pulled that unraveled the sweater was the fact that</p>
<p>these tokens were created out of thin air, they had no meaningful</p>
<p>value, somebody prescribed a value and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>everybody else in the economy all of a sudden said, Yeah, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>take that as collateral. Look, you cannot do that in the</p>
<p>regular world. I can&rsquo;t call JP Morgan and say, I&rsquo;ve invented</p>
<p>this thing. It&rsquo;s called a share in XYZ. And I&rsquo;d like you to</p>
<p>margin loan, you know, give me a loan against it. So Brian,</p>
<p>explain like there&rsquo;s a ton of these tokens that have been</p>
<p>engineered, right? And there&rsquo;s been a ton of these tokens that</p>
<p>have been sold. So what should people do that own these things</p>
<p>thinking that there was going to be some safety or value or, you</p>
<p>know, like, how do you think about all of these tokens that</p>
<p>are that that could be as basically as as fragile and</p>
<p>shitty and worthless as FTT?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, there there is this concept of like an exchange</p>
<p>token. And there&rsquo;s a couple other firms out there that have</p>
<p>them. And that&rsquo;s something we haven&rsquo;t done. And I do. I think</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right. Like, the actual utility of those things</p>
<p>is a little questionable. And so if someone&rsquo;s going to sort of</p>
<p>mark those up on a low supply, and then a low float, and then</p>
<p>somehow leverage that, that that&rsquo;s going to get yourself</p>
<p>into trouble. But look, I don&rsquo;t want to throw out the entire</p>
<p>concept of people creating tokens, I think there&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>a lot of good stuff there. And it comes down to this idea of if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to raise money for your company, and a token through</p>
<p>a token, that&rsquo;s fine, that should be a security. And there</p>
<p>should be a regulated way to do that in the US, like go register</p>
<p>it with the SEC, you know, let it trade on broker dealers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been wanting to do for a long time.</p>
<p>And the SEC is taking their time getting there. They don&rsquo;t, you</p>
<p>know, Gensler, to be honest, he doesn&rsquo;t seem that excited about</p>
<p>the idea of this whole industry existing. And so anyway, but it</p>
<p>should it should exist, and it should be happening in a</p>
<p>regulated way. So if people want to issue a token that&rsquo;s raising</p>
<p>money for a company, let&rsquo;s regulate it as a security. If</p>
<p>they want to issue a token that&rsquo;s truly on a decentralized</p>
<p>protocol, or has some other purpose, like voting in a DAO,</p>
<p>or rewards or something like that, then that&rsquo;s probably not a</p>
<p>security. And let&rsquo;s be honest about that and allow those</p>
<p>things to trade in a different environment, a different</p>
<p>regulator under the CFTC,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re probably running out of time with you, because you said</p>
<p>you had a hard stop. So let&rsquo;s ask the million dollar question,</p>
<p>tell us about SPF. Like, what&rsquo;s, who is this character? When did</p>
<p>you first suspect? Yeah, what&rsquo;s your read on the psychology that</p>
<p>this wasn&rsquo;t legit? Do you think that it was his altruistic</p>
<p>intent, that allowed himself to convince himself to do this? Or</p>
<p>do you think this was like malicious the whole way? Or</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your sense of the guy?</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m speculating here. I mean, I&rsquo;ve spent time with</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met him a bunch of times. And I have to say, I did not see</p>
<p>this coming. Like he, he appeared to me to be a very</p>
<p>bright, credible, competent person, perhaps a bit young,</p>
<p>perhaps, you know, a bit reckless at times, but not</p>
<p>unethical and not not committing fraud. I definitely did not see</p>
<p>that. You know, if I look back to see, were there any warning</p>
<p>signs that I should have thought twice about it? You know, one of</p>
<p>the things I noticed was that in 2021, you know, Coinbase had a</p>
<p>good year, we did 7 billion in revenue for a billion of</p>
<p>positive EBITDA, we went, we became public as a company. At</p>
<p>that time, FTX did about 1 billion in revenue. And I knew</p>
<p>how much money we had for our venture budget, and just like,</p>
<p>different investments we wanted to make. And I knew their</p>
<p>revenue. And I had to scratch my head a bunch of times. And I was</p>
<p>like, where is this guy getting all this liquidity? Because he</p>
<p>was like buying 9% of Robin Hood, he was putting like a</p>
<p>billion dollars into this, he was donating to all these</p>
<p>politicians. And I was like, I it did not make sense to me</p>
<p>where he was getting all this cash, people would just kept</p>
<p>telling me, oh, his market maker Alameda is just printing cash.</p>
<p>I guess like, okay, I guess, you know, it seems like a conflict</p>
<p>of interest to own an exchange to market maker. That&rsquo;s why we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done it. But more power to him, I guess. And so I was</p>
<p>surprised I didn&rsquo;t speak up. I cannot I can&rsquo;t explain the</p>
<p>psychology of it at this point, whether he&rsquo;s a pathological</p>
<p>liar, or if he&rsquo;s started off good, and somehow under the</p>
<p>pressure of this whole thing went bad. But the minute you can</p>
<p>you can go watch the interviews, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s lying to people</p>
<p>about why he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s, you know, a bailing out Voyager and</p>
<p>BlockFi. And he&rsquo;s, and he knew at that time that most likely he</p>
<p>knew at that at that time that they were not solvent Alameda</p>
<p>was not solvent. And so that&rsquo;s where he crossed a major line in</p>
<p>my book.</p>
<p>And we see it time and time again, Elizabeth Holmes, Bernie</p>
<p>Madoff. I mean, once the lie gets too big, you can&rsquo;t get out</p>
<p>of it anymore. If that&rsquo;s the case, really incredible.</p>
<p>And the most important thing at this point, Brian is that the</p>
<p>United States makes a decision on do we want to be in crypto?</p>
<p>Do we want to have a say in this and create a regulatory framework</p>
<p>that entrepreneurs like yourself can deal with that is the most</p>
<p>important thing to happen in the next year. But you&rsquo;re saying the</p>
<p>SEC is not motivated. I guess why are they not motivated?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just CYA one. Oh, they&rsquo;re motivated. Now. This is</p>
<p>a political issue now. So they but let&rsquo;s hear Brian&rsquo;s answer</p>
<p>here. What do you find out who did SPF give all this money to</p>
<p>because he was touted as one of the future biggest donors, the</p>
<p>Democratic Party, Democratic Party wants signals. So if you</p>
<p>want signals, I would say there was a pretty big signals here.</p>
<p>Number one, he says going to donate $1 billion Democratic</p>
<p>Party. And he kept touting this like effective altruism,</p>
<p>whatever the saving the world stuff. Now, why do you need to</p>
<p>do that? Unless your reputation laundering and trying to buy</p>
<p>political protection? Okay, you don&rsquo;t think that was a little</p>
<p>bit of a signal?</p>
<p>Right here. I&rsquo;ll tell you, I&rsquo;ll tell you an even more explicit</p>
<p>signal. We he pitched us in that $17 billion round. And I did a</p>
<p>zoom with him. And after the zoom, I&rsquo;m like, this doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make much sense. But I&rsquo;ll have my team do some work. We did</p>
<p>some work. And we sent him a two page deck. And we said, here</p>
<p>are our recommendations for taking the next step. One was</p>
<p>the formation of a board. The second was the creation of dual</p>
<p>class stock. The third was some reps and warranties around</p>
<p>affiliated transactions and related party transactions. And</p>
<p>the person that worked there, called us back and literally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not kidding, you said, go fuck yourself, was</p>
<p>quote, unquote, the response to us. We&rsquo;re like, okay. So that</p>
<p>was the easy decision. But message receives message</p>
<p>received. But I still thought, okay, I&rsquo;ll just put that in the</p>
<p>bucket of these guys are unbelievably arrogant and smug.</p>
<p>But Brian, I thought what you thought, which is, maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve printed, they&rsquo;ve created some moneymaking machine</p>
<p>in the Bahamas. And so they have that level of confidence. You</p>
<p>know, I, but then to see this thing to the extent of which is</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re only scratching the surface, guys, you know, that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to find out stuff every day.</p>
<p>The postmortem is gonna be crazy. But Brian, to the</p>
<p>question I asked before about the SEC, and what should happen,</p>
<p>you said, I want to pick up on what you said, which is the SEC</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem motivated. Why is the SEC in your mind not</p>
<p>motivated?</p>
<p>Well, I think you&rsquo;re right that I hope that they use this as a</p>
<p>moment to come together and help, you know, local companies</p>
<p>in the US being built here to end up in a better place. And I</p>
<p>do believe, you know, David, I think said, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s right, it</p>
<p>is a political issue. At this point, there&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>major impetus to get the clarity here in the US and</p>
<p>hopefully to help build the companies here in the US that</p>
<p>are going to serve the rest of the world, and in every major</p>
<p>financial hub. So we&rsquo;re committed to building that</p>
<p>together with all the regulators around the world. And crypto is</p>
<p>here to stay. This is a temporary setback. But I&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>to keep building and make this thing happen.</p>
<p>All right, we really appreciate you taking the time.</p>
<p>Thanks. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, story after story here about, you know, SPF was going</p>
<p>to create this billion dollar philanthropy to, you know, save</p>
<p>the world improve humanities, long term prospects, number two</p>
<p>donor to the entire Democratic Party, and on and on and on. And</p>
<p>like, quite frankly, what this shows is you want to know what</p>
<p>effective altruism means. It means that you steal other</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s money, while bragging about saving the world while</p>
<p>taking a big chunk for yourself. That&rsquo;s what it means.</p>
<p>There was a research paper in 2011. And this research team</p>
<p>looked at drug addicts and drug abusers 4000 people. And they</p>
<p>found that the biggest addicts had the highest intelligence,</p>
<p>that you were twice as likely to become an abuser and addict. If</p>
<p>you were any kind of intelligent quintile quintile that they were</p>
<p>measuring. And someone explained this to me at the time, that the</p>
<p>smarter you are, the more you can convince yourself that when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing bad things, you&rsquo;re actually doing good things. Even</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing bad things to yourself or bad things to other</p>
<p>people that you really may actually care about, you can</p>
<p>convince yourself that there&rsquo;s some reason to keep doing it. He</p>
<p>seems like a brilliant guy. I think that to some extent, he</p>
<p>may actually, I don&rsquo;t know the guy, but he may actually believe</p>
<p>that the, you know, the ends did justify the means and he thought</p>
<p>that he was doing good for the world. And this was something</p>
<p>that had to be done in some way. And oh, it just got a little bit</p>
<p>away from me. But it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>I think the problem is bigger than FTX. And I&rsquo;ll say the</p>
<p>uncomfortable part out loud, and nobody needs to necessarily</p>
<p>comment if you don&rsquo;t want to. But there were an enormous</p>
<p>number of venture firms that hawk their their way into just</p>
<p>completely doing zero work here. I mean, and the the tip of the</p>
<p>spear is this thing? Well, who&rsquo;s the guy that works at</p>
<p>founders on bulgar bull jars? zebul jar zebul?</p>
<p>Delhi? Thank you. Yeah, that tweet that he had where he</p>
<p>basically took the snapshot of the Sequoia transcript was one</p>
<p>of the funniest things that I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I mean, this was a</p>
<p>$215 million decision. And Sequoia documented it and put it</p>
<p>on their own website. And I think that&rsquo;s an example of</p>
<p>something that was happening, which is people just look the</p>
<p>other way and didn&rsquo;t even want to do the layer of work.</p>
<p>Come on, let me just string together a couple of things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about over the past few episodes. And I think you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>agree with this point. But generally speaking, there seems</p>
<p>to be a very heavy lack of governance in investing given</p>
<p>the amount of capital and the velocity of capital in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley, particularly in private markets of late. And a lot of</p>
<p>the stuff that&rsquo;s been talked about, where last week, we</p>
<p>talked about super voting shares, and the founder does</p>
<p>whatever they want. And there&rsquo;s no governance. And there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>board. And there&rsquo;s no oversight. And particularly with this FDX</p>
<p>situation, where clearly there wasn&rsquo;t a board that was, you</p>
<p>know, getting the necessary information that had the</p>
<p>necessary influence that had the necessary controls, the meta</p>
<p>conversation, but all of these threads tie together the concept</p>
<p>that maybe there&rsquo;s not a lot of governance and not a lot of</p>
<p>diligence going on. And the amount of money that&rsquo;s flowed</p>
<p>into Silicon Valley has allowed a lot of this Lucy. I&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>either. I agree with you. Let&rsquo;s thank Brian Armstrong for</p>
<p>joining us. And it was very busy day. And what a great,</p>
<p>candid, insightful.</p>
<p>Thank you. And an insightful finisher that month.</p>
<p>I just want to say the second uncomfortable thing out loud,</p>
<p>which is there was a lot of venture firms in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>in this period of both not doing any work or diligence who also</p>
<p>took the extra step and actually created classes and would teach</p>
<p>teams how to create these tokens. Okay, and those</p>
<p>artifacts, those video links and artifacts are sometimes on</p>
<p>their website, they&rsquo;re still on YouTube, they&rsquo;re inside of</p>
<p>Twitter. And what these folks would do, and we talked about</p>
<p>this, the game that they played was they would get a team, they</p>
<p>would create a token, they would also buy equity at some crazy</p>
<p>valuation, the equity was locked up, but the tokens were not. And</p>
<p>then they would put them on an exchange and sell them to</p>
<p>unsuspecting people, and they would be able to dump these</p>
<p>tokens. And if you look inside of that trend, what you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to see, and Brian just mentioned this, those were the sale of</p>
<p>securities, except it was done in a completely unregulated way.</p>
<p>So if the SEC is really and the DOJ is really going to take this</p>
<p>FTT token issue seriously, and what happened to FTX, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to start to look at a bunch of other tokens, and token</p>
<p>sales, and you&rsquo;re going to end up looking at some very well</p>
<p>known venture firms inside of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>This is going to be super gnarly. And we talked about it</p>
<p>before on this pod, there are people who knew better. So you</p>
<p>get a bunch of kids who are living in the Bahamas in a</p>
<p>house, and they&rsquo;re, you know, winging this thing, that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>level of responsibility, and they&rsquo;ll go to jail. But when we</p>
<p>talk about venture capitals, capital allocators who&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>at it for decades, to Chamath&rsquo;s point, and they&rsquo;re teaching</p>
<p>people how to do this, and they&rsquo;re hiring attorneys and</p>
<p>creating offshore, Panama, you know, BVI, whatever places to</p>
<p>put these coins, and then teaching people how to do it,</p>
<p>and then flipping them, potentially, this is we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>peeling back the onion on this, I have a feeling that this is</p>
<p>going to be the turning point and all that</p>
<p>token guys, let&rsquo;s be honest, is not the only token that has been</p>
<p>engineered by Silicon Valley venture firms. And it is also</p>
<p>not the only token that&rsquo;s gone to zero that was engineered by</p>
<p>Silicon Valley venture firms.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, who knows engineered by but yeah, Jason</p>
<p>to at the very least,</p>
<p>Jason, Jason, there&rsquo;s videos today on some of the most well</p>
<p>known venture firm sites on how to do this.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, I&rsquo;m gonna have to see those. Yeah, so they&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>your point Chamath is they&rsquo;re instructing people on how to do</p>
<p>this. And that is our ability. It&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they it&rsquo;s what they did.</p>
<p>Can I ask your guys a point of view on just one big</p>
<p>macro philosophical question? I&rsquo;m obviously not big in the</p>
<p>crypto world and haven&rsquo;t been but so much of the positioning</p>
<p>has been that these networks get decentralized through the</p>
<p>cryptographic verification systems that obviously enable</p>
<p>you know, them to operate effectively and truthfully and</p>
<p>correctly and without centralized control or</p>
<p>manipulation. But ultimately, while these networks themselves</p>
<p>may be decentralized, the user&rsquo;s point of access often ends up</p>
<p>being centralized as a point on the network. And it is that</p>
<p>point on the network that accrues the same level of</p>
<p>influence, power control and value as what we saw in the</p>
<p>prior centralized network model. You know, we had biology on last</p>
<p>year. And you know, I tried to get to this point with him, we</p>
<p>had to cut the thing cut the conversation short. But I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>still not heard from anyone. And I&rsquo;ve spoken with Brian separately</p>
<p>about this point. And the concept I use is like, look,</p>
<p>media, if you put all the YouTube videos on a</p>
<p>decentralized network, and anyone can access them, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re distributed everywhere, you still need to have a really</p>
<p>good application. And whoever makes the best application is</p>
<p>going to get all the usage. And then all the users will use that</p>
<p>application. And that becomes effectively the point of control</p>
<p>and influence and value once again. And so it seems to me</p>
<p>like in this case, the exchange was being used as a centralized</p>
<p>wallet, certainly you can do that, you know, exchange through</p>
<p>the exchange. But But mechanistically, these guys were</p>
<p>storing their coins, their cryptocurrency inside of FT x&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wallets. And so FT x had control over their assets. And so the</p>
<p>network centralized. And so does the decentralized model? It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>question I&rsquo;d love to just ask you guys in your point of view</p>
<p>on does this decentralized model actually ever manifest where</p>
<p>everyone has their own wallet? And I know there&rsquo;s all these new</p>
<p>protocols and these distributed wallets and defy things, but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know enough. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Better, but</p>
<p>this points out to me, just you basically recreate an exchange</p>
<p>without a regulator. And of course, someone ripped you off</p>
<p>and blew up like I mean, how&rsquo;s it any different than what we</p>
<p>had in version 1.0? And is there really a model where</p>
<p>decentralized works are ultimately because of the</p>
<p>network effects and the and the economy? Okay, answer. Yeah, we</p>
<p>got the question.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I haven&rsquo;t I have I don&rsquo;t know the answer to free</p>
<p>bird question because I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know this space well</p>
<p>enough. I mean, you know, I, my, my biggest purchase ever</p>
<p>was Bitcoin in 2011. You know, I&rsquo;ve bought a bunch of these</p>
<p>tokens that have massively depreciated in value. I think</p>
<p>lots of investors have, you know, I kind of fell into it as</p>
<p>well. Like I thought, wow, this is incredible. I get to buy</p>
<p>these tokens, they do all of this cool stuff, they represent</p>
<p>all this value. And my experience has been the opposite</p>
<p>of that. I&rsquo;ve lost a lot of money in these things. And so</p>
<p>you know, I really hope that regulators, not just obviously,</p>
<p>I hope that regulators do their do the best they can to get</p>
<p>investors money back in FTX. But I really also hope they figure</p>
<p>out all these other tokens as well, because you can just rank</p>
<p>them in terms of market cap, start at the top and work your</p>
<p>way down. And you will see that these were unregulated</p>
<p>securities, Jason that were manufactured and sold by our</p>
<p>brethren,</p>
<p>people who understand the law around accredited investors and</p>
<p>this stuff very well. Yeah, they understand it implicitly.</p>
<p>Yeah. Do you guys think crypto investing is dead? Or what do</p>
<p>you think? How do you think people think about that risk</p>
<p>profile now inside of</p>
<p>I think investing in the tokens is going to end investing in the</p>
<p>corporation is going to begin and any of the tokens are going</p>
<p>to be super regulated building on what you said Chamath about</p>
<p>the ultimate bet. Is it possible that Alameda the trading hedge</p>
<p>fund was looking at the FTX data, which they had insights</p>
<p>into. And essentially, that&rsquo;s the same as seeing the whole</p>
<p>cards and the ultimate bet. And so they&rsquo;re making their trades</p>
<p>based on what they see the consumers are making their</p>
<p>trades, front running their trades or otherwise, that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>illegal. You know, Citadel does this in the regulated market.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what payment for order flow is. It&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>ability to front run retail volume. And so, you know, in</p>
<p>dark pools, that is legal by the law in the United States. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what allows Citadel and, you know, I think Jane Street</p>
<p>and Susquehanna, you know, all these folks basically run these</p>
<p>dark pool exchanges for regulated securities, like</p>
<p>options and bonds and, and stocks. And they get this order</p>
<p>flow, and they front run it by a millisecond, and they just take</p>
<p>small big, but they can&rsquo;t print the FTT tokens and otherwise</p>
<p>manipulate the market to the level that I think SPL could, I</p>
<p>just think that there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s these really strict</p>
<p>walls and segregation, as you heard Brian talk about, when you</p>
<p>have those businesses in these regulated markets, the problem</p>
<p>here is that this is totally wild west, unregulated, wild,</p>
<p>wild west. So who knows what&rsquo;s going on really?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re pushing the business sacks off of the shores of the</p>
<p>United States, as he said, 95% of this happened offshore. What</p>
<p>do you think should happen regulatory wise sacks in terms</p>
<p>of America and competitiveness? Or do we not to be need to be</p>
<p>competitive in this?</p>
<p>No, I think we should be. I mean, what if what if crypto and</p>
<p>defy is the future of finance? I mean, it&rsquo;s an important</p>
<p>technology that I think we should enable through some sort</p>
<p>of constructive regulatory framework. I think, I think the</p>
<p>regulators should listen to Brian and help come up with a</p>
<p>appropriate framework. But to be clear, look, what Sam did is way</p>
<p>worse than people going on an exchange and speculating. I</p>
<p>mean, look, I think that people who speculated in the buying and</p>
<p>selling these tokens, they&rsquo;re, they were using it like a</p>
<p>casino. Okay, like, that&rsquo;s different than a customer</p>
<p>putting their money on FTX and having their money get stolen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big difference. So I think there&rsquo;s levels here. Now,</p>
<p>Jamal, to your point about who&rsquo;s minting these tokens, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right, maybe that&rsquo;s like another category. But I do think</p>
<p>that the reason why this is on a different level is because it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t Sam&rsquo;s money to give away.</p>
<p>There is such an easy solution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just I agree with you on that point. But I think don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>underplay when there&rsquo;s an organized process to create an</p>
<p>illegal security with special rules for them. That allows the</p>
<p>liquidity for one class of asset and not liquidity for</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. So that&rsquo;s a separate bucket. I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same as what Sam did. And I don&rsquo;t think I agree. I</p>
<p>agree. No, I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>grift, that&rsquo;s something that needs to be looked at. And we</p>
<p>need a constructive regulatory framework for that.</p>
<p>There is such a simple silver bullet for all of this, which is</p>
<p>these things need to be there needs to be proper governance,</p>
<p>people have to have skin in the game insurance, people signing</p>
<p>off on the taxes boards, not onshore here in the United</p>
<p>States. And then we need to have and I&rsquo;ll keep saying this, a way</p>
<p>for Americans to become sophisticated investors, only 6%</p>
<p>of this country fall into the qualified purchaser and</p>
<p>accredited if you want to trade in these things, or you want to</p>
<p>trade in NFTs or private companies, we should have a</p>
<p>driver&rsquo;s license like test a firearm. I are on the sophisticated</p>
<p>test and the problem opt into it with an education.</p>
<p>The problem is when you have guys like this, it sets that</p>
<p>desire back by a decade, if not more. Okay, because it sucks. I</p>
<p>agree. Because every single frustrating every single person</p>
<p>inside of Washington right now, who&rsquo;s anywhere near this from a</p>
<p>regulatory perspective, or a policy perspective is meeting on</p>
<p>Monday morning. And the meeting topic is how do we defend the</p>
<p>mom and pop folks that lost money here? Yes, the only thing</p>
<p>so we took this out of you know, because I remember I remember I</p>
<p>texted into the group chat, hey, guys, what what what do we</p>
<p>think the legal ramifications are that drive prosecution, and</p>
<p>one of our friends said legal ramifications. These are</p>
<p>political ramifications. Yeah, which means that this is going</p>
<p>to go to the utmost level, and it&rsquo;s going to have the most</p>
<p>scrutiny. And they&rsquo;re going to act really quickly. It is going</p>
<p>to drop a hammer instead of having a path to accreditation.</p>
<p>I agree with you, they&rsquo;re going to drop the hammer, because</p>
<p>their constituents, some grandma and grandpa or some people put</p>
<p>their college education to some lost everything. We just need</p>
<p>a test. Let people prove they&rsquo;re sophisticated and let</p>
<p>them participate. Well, first and only if they get a license,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t you been a proponent for letting people invest in</p>
<p>startups that are just moms and pops and democratizing access?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only allowed to do that with accredited investors. I would</p>
<p>like there to be a test and I actually teach a course Angel</p>
<p>University six times a year for charity. I do it for charity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a four hour course where you learn about diversification</p>
<p>you learn about the asset class you learn about 70 80% go to</p>
<p>zero, we teach you about the power law, I try to teach people</p>
<p>about this stuff, so that they can participate intelligently,</p>
<p>it would it would be the equivalent freeberg. And thank</p>
<p>you for asking the question. The it would be equivalent if we had</p>
<p>a poker test and to play in the world series of poker, you had</p>
<p>to go to a five hour seminar, and you had to take a practical</p>
<p>test. And you had to say, you know, a flush beats a straight</p>
<p>and you had to just prove that you had some level of knowledge</p>
<p>of how to play the game. It&rsquo;s such an obvious path to removing</p>
<p>these problems while staying competitive as a country. And</p>
<p>instead, we&rsquo;re letting people do this offshore like CZ with no</p>
<p>rules, or whatever rules he chooses. It&rsquo;s just infuriating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so stupid. Our politicians in Washington are so can I just</p>
<p>say something? I think the challenge is there&rsquo;s always a</p>
<p>spectrum of understanding. And you&rsquo;ll always end up seeing the</p>
<p>people on the wrong end of the spectrum getting taken advantage</p>
<p>of there&rsquo;s this notion of adverse selection. distributions</p>
<p>are not equal. People will end up, you know, kind of opting in</p>
<p>to spend money on things, or making investments that they</p>
<p>think are good investments, but they&rsquo;re actually getting taken</p>
<p>advantage of, because they&rsquo;re not savvy enough, or they miss an</p>
<p>important angle or important perspective about the person or</p>
<p>the thing that they&rsquo;re giving their money to. And there will</p>
<p>always be some number of those. And the way that regulation has</p>
<p>worked historically, is not by first saying, hey, let&rsquo;s figure</p>
<p>out the right way to create a framework for operating. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that some sort of people got advantaged. That story then</p>
<p>becomes the regulatory framework. And that story has</p>
<p>repeated itself for 500 years across capital markets,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about a multi layered thing here, we want to</p>
<p>see crypto have a framework, we want it to blossom here in the</p>
<p>United States. And then there&rsquo;s multiple level of people who are</p>
<p>causing chaos in this ecosystem in this very promising</p>
<p>technology with their goddamn grifts, whether it&rsquo;s VCs,</p>
<p>grifting, or SPF, or incompetence, we just need to</p>
<p>clean this framework up. If people sometimes people I</p>
<p>understand in DC listen to this podcast, if they&rsquo;re listening,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s essential that America be competitive here, it&rsquo;s essential</p>
<p>that everybody participate in risk capital and get educated.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s clean it up and make a framework that allows all</p>
<p>Americans to participate, and educates them, and then stops</p>
<p>these grifters from doing stupid things. If people were educated,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first step. And it&rsquo;s the best talk about the economy.</p>
<p>Sure, you want to talk about Facebook with 11,000, you want</p>
<p>to talk about the market popping at the beginning of October.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think what we basically said, kind of generally speaking</p>
<p>is markets up, right markets went from nibbling to being</p>
<p>constructively positive and basically being positioned long.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s this really interesting setup. We have a bunch of very</p>
<p>positive news that I think we all have to process. First</p>
<p>positive news was that inflation ticked down. Now, here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you, there&rsquo;s a caveat here, I talked to a bunch of</p>
<p>pretty smart sharps on Wall Street. And oh, two things.</p>
<p>Number one is they all gave credit to David Sachs. And they</p>
<p>said Sachs is totally right, double dip recession is coming.</p>
<p>But then they said, tell Sachs, that we think that these are the</p>
<p>sharps, we think that there&rsquo;s a double hump in inflation coming,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s coming down to come back up. And there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of reporting vagaries that may cause that. So keep that in</p>
<p>the back of your mind. But positive news. Number one is</p>
<p>inflation ticking down. Number two, Jason, we talked about</p>
<p>this, a federal judge basically stayed Biden&rsquo;s attempt at giving</p>
<p>student loan relief. Now, that would have been a $500 billion</p>
<p>transfer payment from the government into the hands of</p>
<p>individuals. It is deflationary to not put give that money to</p>
<p>people, it&rsquo;s effectively taking stimulus away from folks. Number</p>
<p>three, it looks like we&rsquo;re headed towards a split</p>
<p>government, which means that we are not probably going to see</p>
<p>any more stimulus over the next two years. Number four, Ukraine</p>
<p>wins in Curzon. I hope I&rsquo;m pronouncing that right. Number</p>
<p>five, the United States announced yesterday through the</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal, that they had essentially said no to</p>
<p>Ukraine&rsquo;s request for advanced drones. And they said to Ukraine,</p>
<p>essentially, you need to go and negotiate an endgame here. And</p>
<p>number six, China has started to relax as COVID policies and G is</p>
<p>pivoting to economy first. So if you took all the way, take</p>
<p>seven, don&rsquo;t forget seven, Facebook, which would not take</p>
<p>the medicine, they refuse Brad Gerson&rsquo;s letter, cut 11,000</p>
<p>people 48 hours ago. I don&rsquo;t think Facebook matters that</p>
<p>much, to be honest. Well, but it matters that big tech is and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking matters to us. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter to the</p>
<p>economy, to be completely honest. I think it does if</p>
<p>people are going to start cutting jobs, but okay, keep</p>
<p>going. My point point is, these seven things are macro level</p>
<p>things that affect everybody. Yep. And I think if you take them</p>
<p>together, what it says is that, wow, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>potential for a lot of great positive developments over the</p>
<p>next six or nine months. And I don&rsquo;t think that that was</p>
<p>adequately priced in the market. But here&rsquo;s the problem. And this</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve been rallying. The problem is that</p>
<p>most of this rallying has been because of a bunch of short</p>
<p>covering by folks that who are pretty pessimistic and negative</p>
<p>after the last few inflation prints. So this is not really</p>
<p>net new buying that we saw over the last couple days. So you</p>
<p>take it all together, I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s still going to probably</p>
<p>trend up a little bit. But then again, you know, we talked about</p>
<p>this, Jason, when the VIX gets into the low 20s, or the high</p>
<p>teens, that&rsquo;s probably the short term top, and then it turns</p>
<p>around. And unfortunately, we&rsquo;re the low 20s, high teens. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of my thought on things right now.</p>
<p>Okay, freeberg, any thoughts on the inflation print?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think there&rsquo;s two things, one of which I&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>credit to a guy named Carl Chu. I hope I pronounced Carl&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>right. He&rsquo;s from William Blair, he puts out these excellent</p>
<p>research reports. And we used one of his graphics a few weeks</p>
<p>ago. So I put it up here. And basically, he showed that with</p>
<p>the the NASDAQ move that we saw this week, so you can see this</p>
<p>here, he basically tracked the move in the 10 year Treasury</p>
<p>against the one day move in the NASDAQ. And he said that it</p>
<p>really indicates a unique sentiment shift, whereas in</p>
<p>other times, you&rsquo;ve seen big moves in the NASDAQ that weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really seeing significant moves in in the Treasury rate at the</p>
<p>same on the same trading day. And that this is such an</p>
<p>outlier, what happened this week, the only other time that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen anything like it was when the Bank of England issue</p>
<p>happened back at the end of September, in the last, you</p>
<p>know, 20 times that we&rsquo;ve seen this big of a move in the NASDAQ</p>
<p>in a single day. And so we saw 31 basis point move in 10 year</p>
<p>Treasuries in a single day, the same time that we saw what a</p>
<p>seven point move in the NASDAQ. So he said, because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>normally see the bond market and the equity market trade in this</p>
<p>way together, it really speaks to a big shift in sentiment. Now,</p>
<p>at the same time, what is that shift in sentiment, that there</p>
<p>is going to be less of a driver for the Fed to raise interest</p>
<p>rates at this point, because it seems like the inflation print</p>
<p>indicates that inflation is coming under control faster than</p>
<p>what folks had otherwise anticipated. And so there may</p>
<p>not be as many rate hikes as quickly as folks were</p>
<p>anticipating, which will, you know, benefit, benefit equities</p>
<p>and the bond market traded that that with that perspective as</p>
<p>well. Now the counter narrative, which I just put a tweet by a</p>
<p>guy who I&rsquo;ve never heard of before. But someone shared this</p>
<p>with me. His name is Gordon Johnson. And he said, the CPI</p>
<p>surprise may actually be due to a technical print that within</p>
<p>the CPI, one of the biggest indicators is health insurance</p>
<p>cost. And, you know, the health insurance cost plunged by 4%</p>
<p>October to September, but healthcare costs didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually magically collapse, there was just an accounting</p>
<p>difference in how they&rsquo;re shifting how they&rsquo;re accounting</p>
<p>for healthcare costs that took place during the month. And if</p>
<p>you did not, if you assume that that was flat, month over month,</p>
<p>you would end up actually with a 6.7% year over year print, which</p>
<p>was higher than expected. So there is a counter narrative</p>
<p>going on in the market. I don&rsquo;t know how significant this guy</p>
<p>is, or how much of a voice he has. But I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>out of the woods yet. But some folks are saying that the market</p>
<p>is saying, we&rsquo;re feeling a lot better. But there are still</p>
<p>analysts that are indicating that maybe there is still risk</p>
<p>to be had ahead of us.</p>
<p>I think the sharps tend to be on that second, second perspective.</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;ll say this week, I heard five and a half</p>
<p>points, even after that print. So it is where we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get to, I think consensus we have here is, is that we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the end game now, maybe what two quarters, three quarters, four</p>
<p>quarters of choppiness. Chamath, what would your gut tell you if</p>
<p>you I&rsquo;ve been telling all of our startups that you need to</p>
<p>plan to have money through the first quarter of 2025? You must?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely must. And the way that I have cash, okay, the</p>
<p>way that I framed that out to them is nine. Yeah, eight or nine</p>
<p>quarters of cash. Ideally, nine. And the reason is that we have</p>
<p>all of this positive news in the offing. But But the but the</p>
<p>problem is, again, there is still a lot of risk to the</p>
<p>downside, we haven&rsquo;t seen David&rsquo;s second, you know, dip in</p>
<p>the recession, right. So that double dip is going to be</p>
<p>expensive. And again, the sharps think that inflation will come</p>
<p>back at some point in the next six months. That will keep the</p>
<p>feds foot on the gas. Maybe it&rsquo;s two or three more 50 basis point</p>
<p>hikes. The point is, Jason, you could be at five and a half.</p>
<p>Again, we said this last week, we&rsquo;re going to get to a point</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably higher than what people expect. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably around five and a half. And we&rsquo;ll stay there longer than</p>
<p>people want. That&rsquo;s probably through the middle part of 24.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t prepare for that worst case scenario, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing yourself a disservice. I think the market can start to</p>
<p>rebound in the second half of 24. But if you&rsquo;re a company, you</p>
<p>need to balance and plan for the first quarter of 25. Because,</p>
<p>you know, again, most venture investors are going to want to</p>
<p>see six months of data on the ground that things are better</p>
<p>before their sentiment changes. Yeah. And we&rsquo;re just starting to</p>
<p>see the drawdowns. We&rsquo;re just starting to see the impacts in</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s portfolios. That will drive behavior change. I mean,</p>
<p>this SPF thing is the tip of the iceberg in terms of the money at</p>
<p>risk. You know, I went in, by the way, I did it in analysis, I</p>
<p>shared it in the group chat. Hopefully, we can show this up.</p>
<p>Brad has a little chart, Nick, maybe you can throw up the, the</p>
<p>historic drawdowns. So for people that care about early</p>
<p>stage technology, since 2018, through 2021. And including an</p>
<p>estimate for 2022, we have injected $1 trillion into</p>
<p>venture capital. And if you look at historically, how money has</p>
<p>been lost in periods like this, and you layer that into 2018 to</p>
<p>now, what it basically tells you is about $500 billion of</p>
<p>that trillion from 1819 2021 and 22 is going to be destroyed. We</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t even started to see that yet, right. And then if you</p>
<p>factor in another 100 billion or so from older vintages, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about a 600 or 700 billion dollar destruction of</p>
<p>paid in capital. So there&rsquo;s still for all the good news,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a bunch of these unfortunate pieces of bad news</p>
<p>that have to work its way through the system.</p>
<p>Yeah. And for people who are looking at the chart right now,</p>
<p>and you can see the charts on Spotify, or if you search for</p>
<p>all in on YouTube, we have a video version there. You just</p>
<p>take a look at 1997, the peak TV pi was, you know, seven and a</p>
<p>half x seven and a half times, you know, cash on cash money.</p>
<p>And what actually got realized was five x, right. So what paper</p>
<p>said and what got distributed were two different things.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, what I&rsquo;m seeing in the startup world Chamath is</p>
<p>people are taking the medicine and a lot of people are shutting</p>
<p>their companies down. They&rsquo;re giving up on raising money, and</p>
<p>then asking me which portfolio company can I get a job at</p>
<p>because I on my personal balance sheet have been, you know,</p>
<p>taking a 5k draw a month and I have two kids, I need a job, can</p>
<p>you get me a job at Amazon or another portfolio company. And a</p>
<p>lot of acquirers have started to happen. And so what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is the consolidation of talent, people who would be a great</p>
<p>number three or four person, but maybe they weren&rsquo;t suited to be</p>
<p>the number one person are now consolidating into startups. With</p>
<p>these layoffs at meta and other corporations, we&rsquo;re starting to</p>
<p>see very talented people who had peak comp of 300 700k a year are</p>
<p>going to go to startups or smaller companies. And that is</p>
<p>also positive, more consolidation of talent,</p>
<p>stronger companies.</p>
<p>Did you guys hear the story yesterday that, Nick, if you</p>
<p>could just be about the name, told about his friend, his</p>
<p>friend basically makes $140,000 working for a tech startup, and</p>
<p>then also makes $280,000 working for meta. And so and he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>working at both of those companies virtually, for the</p>
<p>last two years, the guy makes 400 $450,000 a year, and nobody</p>
<p>knows. And he says he works about 2022 hours a week,</p>
<p>on both combined. So the 80 hours and remember, when we</p>
<p>started in startups in the late 90s, and into the turn of the</p>
<p>century. The number of hours that was expected at a startup</p>
<p>was what sacks when you were at 60 hours a week, I would say 60</p>
<p>60 day I was expecting a baseline. Yeah, 60 baseline.</p>
<p>Yeah. Baseline 10 hours a day plus come in on the weekend for</p>
<p>a couple hours. Yes. Yeah, for sure. Easily. He probably more</p>
<p>early days of Facebook, our executive management meetings</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t start till 9pm.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, this is, I think, Ilan is going to be a trailblazer</p>
<p>in a lot of ways on this Twitter thing. You know, first,</p>
<p>he did the big headcount reduction, but then he also just</p>
<p>this past week, everyone needs to come to the office. And if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t come to the office, you don&rsquo;t come to the office,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a good excuse. If you&rsquo;re an exceptional performer, and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a good reason, they don&rsquo;t have to, but the baseline</p>
<p>is everyone comes to the office.</p>
<p>By the way, just to put this point into focus, Nick, can you</p>
<p>just throw up this chart for these guys to see because I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just ridiculous. So this is basically what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with, which is like, if you look at and these are just a</p>
<p>couple of examples, but this is Meta, Amazon, Snowflake, Datadog</p>
<p>versus Gilead, Raytheon, and Exxon. What is the point of</p>
<p>this? The point of this is just to show you that we have had a</p>
<p>massive rotation away from our industry is the point, right?</p>
<p>Where normally, the things that we would work on were just so</p>
<p>well received by so many different kinds of investors</p>
<p>that unfortunately, just isn&rsquo;t the case anymore. And I think it</p>
<p>just goes to show you that the reason why this is happening is</p>
<p>because people are hedging their bets about how long the</p>
<p>economic pain lasts. That&rsquo;s why, you know, they&rsquo;d rather be long</p>
<p>healthcare stocks, you know, industrial defense companies,</p>
<p>and oil companies, because at the end of the day, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>banking on oil and war, and sickness, you know, versus</p>
<p>social media and e commerce, and SaaS software. And if we look at</p>
<p>this chart, just no matter how good by the way, this is not an</p>
<p>indictment on these companies go watch the prediction episode</p>
<p>from last year. I think that was your prediction episode.</p>
<p>Yeah, we you and I nailed it on crypto. We both said crypto was</p>
<p>going to crater these four horsemen here data dog meta</p>
<p>Amazon snowflake down 23 to 27%. And then the Gilead Raytheon</p>
<p>Exxon cohort, eight to 28%. Up. I think Chamath what this says</p>
<p>also is, we don&rsquo;t think your management style and how you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running these businesses is appropriate for this moment in</p>
<p>time, please consider some austerity measures and some</p>
<p>thoughtfulness in how you treat shareholders. These are well, I</p>
<p>mean, it&rsquo;s just watching the number, you know, how people are</p>
<p>running companies. I think we took it too far in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley, we took it too far, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a cow, I know that I know it&rsquo;s sort of a pet issue of ours,</p>
<p>because we have to deal with some incredible hubris and</p>
<p>arrogance sometimes on the boards of these companies,</p>
<p>because folks don&rsquo;t want to listen to reasonable advice, and</p>
<p>we come off as wet blankets. But that chart, to be honest, is</p>
<p>is because of what we explained last week, which is the when</p>
<p>rates go up, the value of $1 that you earn today is just</p>
<p>meaningly, meaningfully more worthwhile than $1 that you may</p>
<p>earn even two or three years in the future. That&rsquo;s why that</p>
<p>chart looks the way that it does. And if you believe that</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s forecast of a double dip recession is accurate, which</p>
<p>again, most of the sharps do. And then you also layer in this</p>
<p>idea that inflation could come back, you have to be really</p>
<p>defensively positioned, you know, you can&rsquo;t take a lot of</p>
<p>risk, which is why startups have to expect that if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>dynamic, and $600 billion is going to get destroyed in</p>
<p>venture capital portfolios, how open our VC is going to be for</p>
<p>business, they&rsquo;re probably not going to be that open. And so</p>
<p>you have to plan, I think, for the middle for the early part of</p>
<p>25.</p>
<p>If Amazon and how do you get incremental dollars in these</p>
<p>tech companies, Amazon does a riff, some austerity measures,</p>
<p>they raise prices a little bit if they can, you know, maybe you</p>
<p>see more incremental dollars coming today. And maybe that</p>
<p>incentivizes people look what happened. We were at $89 for</p>
<p>Facebook shares last week tomorrow. When he made the riff</p>
<p>107, he went up like 15 $20. What does that tell you?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it tells you that a lot of people were short</p>
<p>going into that, and they were probably cut off side a little</p>
<p>bit by the magnitude of it. I think that that&rsquo;s good. The the</p>
<p>issue that a lot of these companies have, even in the face</p>
<p>of riffs is that you have to reset expectations now on</p>
<p>earnings. And if you do that, the problem is that when you</p>
<p>flow that through to what people think the S&amp;P will look like in</p>
<p>a year, there&rsquo;s some real issues. So this is not free, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s really hard treading. And I just I would I would just</p>
<p>encourage people, it feels wonderful to have a few days of</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s like a respite in the middle of a huge storm, right?</p>
<p>It feels like we&rsquo;ve been getting whipsawed back and forth, and it</p>
<p>the sun came out, and the wind came out, I would just really</p>
<p>encourage people in this moment to reset your energy, which I</p>
<p>think is good. But you got to go back into that office, and you</p>
<p>got to find the money and the wherewithal, I think to last</p>
<p>through 24. If possible, it&rsquo;s grind time, Facebook, by the</p>
<p>way, 27 months, 27, at least two years, two years, it 24 months.</p>
<p>Yeah. Eight quarters is the new six quarters. And by the way,</p>
<p>you know, the thing that employees need to do now in this</p>
<p>moment is to hold the management teams of your companies</p>
<p>accountable, because in those q&amp;a is, hopefully, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>just glad handing talking about bullshit, you actually go and</p>
<p>ask the question, how much money do we have? What decisions</p>
<p>are you going to make to get this company to be, you know, in</p>
<p>a position to survive? That is really what&rsquo;s at stake here for</p>
<p>the venture capital industry is just survival of as many of</p>
<p>these companies as possible. Through these next two years,</p>
<p>the conversation has to shift from like culture and features</p>
<p>to like the bottom line, and grinding it out and just proving</p>
<p>it to Wall Street and to the investment community that your</p>
<p>business is worthy of investment. As you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>the dollars today matter. All right. It&rsquo;s been a crazy week.</p>
<p>Thank you to David Friedberg for showing up. Unfortunately, no</p>
<p>time for science corner. apologies to the Friedberg</p>
<p>stands who are many and we&rsquo;ll see you in the YouTube comments</p>
<p>for the dictator himself to my poly hoppity with just a</p>
<p>wonderful sweater going into the strong November strong showing</p>
<p>for November with that purple sweater. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mauve or purple, whatever you got going there looks</p>
<p>wonderful. Thank you for team Montclair. Sasso himself. David</p>
<p>sacks people don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying when you say</p>
<p>that Jason. Oh, they know you&rsquo;re an asshole. They they&rsquo;re no,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying. They don&rsquo;t know. They don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re adding the SAS to it. Yes. So David also is a great</p>
<p>executive in software as a service in addition to being an</p>
<p>asshole. So you put the two together and you get fast. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just joking. David&rsquo;s a wonderful person. People are really</p>
<p>excited that you and I are friends again. It&rsquo;s an amazing</p>
<p>moment. That was your chance to make a joke. So actually missed</p>
<p>it. Throw it up there for you. I threw up the softball for you</p>
<p>to say you&rsquo;re not right. We&rsquo;ll see you all next time. Bye bye.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride. Rain Man David.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>it. Love you.</p>
<p>What your winners ride. What your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a piss in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this like</p>
<p>sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be.</p>
<p>We need to get Merchies.</p>
