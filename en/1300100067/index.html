<p>isn&rsquo;t like when someone overtakes a government yeah</p>
<p>so why are we saying coop</p>
<p>i was thinking chicken coop</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think chicken coop</p>
<p>spell that way brother no you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>going double double o&rsquo;s double o says how sparks i</p>
<p>agree with them yeah you know they are the ones that</p>
<p>after nine eleven had that controversial</p>
<p>album with the two twin</p>
<p>towers i think that were exploding on</p>
<p>remember that the cd</p>
<p>damn i don&rsquo;t remember that at all but i just</p>
<p>i just get attention yeah</p>
<p>that would reinforce the coup</p>
<p>concept as a name as opposed to i remember</p>
<p>when biggie did the original blow up like the world</p>
<p>trade and people are like whoa</p>
<p>what the fuck did you</p>
<p>say and that&rsquo;s only when a few people had died right</p>
<p>no a bold move coo</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking over</p>
<p>folks that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>i mean i guess that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>those are the kind of</p>
<p>things you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna say when you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>break through the den of a</p>
<p>saturated market</p>
<p>yeah before</p>
<p>we get into any controversial subjects we must</p>
<p>thank our sponsor the</p>
<p>flashlight we are sponsored by</p>
<p>a masturbation tool mr</p>
<p>sparks i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever used one</p>
<p>of these things i</p>
<p>have not used it but i&rsquo;m familiar with the concept</p>
<p>you have touched one</p>
<p>you touched</p>
<p>it these are all virgins and</p>
<p>except for fingers</p>
<p>put your finger inside of it no no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fascinating product man it works very well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very effective that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not uh</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a blue color</p>
<p>novelty item</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for the necrophiliac how</p>
<p>about the double clogliac</p>
<p>in you right</p>
<p>has anybody really ever turned blue</p>
<p>huh i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they ever hit that</p>
<p>stage that color i</p>
<p>guess someone hit</p>
<p>hypothermia</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re high</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>alien right now</p>
<p>or they really are an</p>
<p>alien or you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>body and it</p>
<p>would be full do you</p>
<p>think a body in a</p>
<p>river looks like that probably it&rsquo;s like blue greens</p>
<p>veiny bloated</p>
<p>the bloated</p>
<p>flashlight i don&rsquo;t know and if we look at</p>
<p>silence of the lambs is our reference</p>
<p>point for the body</p>
<p>found in the woods she was</p>
<p>relatively pinkish her</p>
<p>fingertips and feet were</p>
<p>or bluish but i</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>never closed up on the how many</p>
<p>dudes get inspired by</p>
<p>those movies to become serial</p>
<p>killers like how many people just want to be someone</p>
<p>special so they go that guy got caught but i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go out there and do that well a lot of them</p>
<p>a lot of them are to</p>
<p>i guess don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>the ability to</p>
<p>see it through because serial killer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a commitment</p>
<p>most people do the</p>
<p>yeah sorry i don&rsquo;t know how to shut it</p>
<p>right leave it</p>
<p>open it does it</p>
<p>spoil or something</p>
<p>dude my flashlight went bad</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>but a lot of guys what they&rsquo;ll do is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll get inspired by that do the workplace violence</p>
<p>thing go up and</p>
<p>shoot a girlfriend</p>
<p>shoot up their office</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where those guys come from</p>
<p>and then they end up</p>
<p>shooting themselves because it&rsquo;s nothing like they</p>
<p>expected is that why they do it or do they</p>
<p>plan on shooting themselves in the first place</p>
<p>some some say they do or whatever they&rsquo;re gonna commit</p>
<p>suicide by cop or whatever but a lot of them</p>
<p>go down because they&rsquo;re looking at the dead people and</p>
<p>going this is nothing like a</p>
<p>movie this is nothing like a video game</p>
<p>nothing like i thought and then they</p>
<p>they just can&rsquo;t take yeah they have this</p>
<p>cause the guys who survived trying to kill themselves</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>said jesus christ</p>
<p>how fucking it just</p>
<p>shows the broad spectrum</p>
<p>of human thinking and behavior</p>
<p>oh yeah people are</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fascinating</p>
<p>know when you just you know just you meet someone</p>
<p>and you just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t jive with this guy this guy&rsquo;s broken</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>wacky or whatever and you like god</p>
<p>i could have just met the coolest person in the</p>
<p>world instead i met the douchiest person in the</p>
<p>world just random</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s someone</p>
<p>like in the</p>
<p>other world</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s running the game controller that runs that</p>
<p>particular body in this environment</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as if he handed the controller to his friend and</p>
<p>would just try the game for a while</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>even a second ago</p>
<p>there was a guy who knew how to</p>
<p>run it was like okay i&rsquo;m living a glyph i&rsquo;ve got a guy</p>
<p>going he&rsquo;s pretty interesting</p>
<p>and then he hands it to his friend who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never played the game before and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>keep running into the wall</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of people that just keep running into the walls</p>
<p>totally you&rsquo;ll run</p>
<p>into people that i&rsquo;ve met people in my life that easily</p>
<p>could have been shooters</p>
<p>they easily</p>
<p>could have you know they&rsquo;re just oh yeah one</p>
<p>tragedy away one ass kicking away one</p>
<p>life ass kicking you lose your job lose your house</p>
<p>you know lose i was one in high</p>
<p>school i wasn&rsquo;t that far off really yeah for real</p>
<p>yeah for real</p>
<p>what was it</p>
<p>about balloon</p>
<p>huh no no it was it was</p>
<p>i came from the country like stickville</p>
<p>you know like kentucky and i</p>
<p>moved to chicago in the</p>
<p>first year i was there</p>
<p>i was pretty fucking</p>
<p>miserable because i was such an outcast and it was so</p>
<p>like it was a</p>
<p>super rich school is</p>
<p>i went from a</p>
<p>school that had a hundred</p>
<p>forty people</p>
<p>in my class to</p>
<p>fourteen hundred in my class like</p>
<p>and i had a</p>
<p>southern accent fucking</p>
<p>peach fuzz mustache</p>
<p>and we were</p>
<p>broke and i</p>
<p>lived in a guest</p>
<p>house up the</p>
<p>street and all</p>
<p>these kids were</p>
<p>like rolling in mercedes and that kind of</p>
<p>stuff and i had</p>
<p>that kind of</p>
<p>outsider like</p>
<p>anger about it and then</p>
<p>what solved it was</p>
<p>was the fact that</p>
<p>two girls approached me</p>
<p>at a party at the same time</p>
<p>and it occurred to me that it</p>
<p>there was a fork in the road here i</p>
<p>could go violent</p>
<p>hell or i could get laid and this was the choice and</p>
<p>i went with getting laid</p>
<p>wow so your response to just being</p>
<p>outcast you wanted to get violent with them</p>
<p>yeah well certain ones of them i mean i got in a</p>
<p>bunch of fights the</p>
<p>first like like</p>
<p>three months i was there almost got</p>
<p>kicked the fuck is that</p>
<p>about people that you</p>
<p>know new people can&rsquo;t come around they just immediately</p>
<p>sense the weakness and want to</p>
<p>start fucking with yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some people that just do that</p>
<p>right i had the same situation in my life</p>
<p>where i moved around a lot we moved from</p>
<p>time i was seven</p>
<p>we moved to new jersey</p>
<p>or to from new jersey to san francisco</p>
<p>lived in san francisco</p>
<p>until i was 11</p>
<p>and then 11</p>
<p>to 13 lived in florida</p>
<p>and then 13 to 24</p>
<p>lived in boston</p>
<p>right so it was the same sort of</p>
<p>thing it was like you</p>
<p>never really get settled right</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>right when you develop some friends and</p>
<p>start you know having like a little</p>
<p>base of people</p>
<p>you hang out with and it seems like life is normal</p>
<p>for kids that&rsquo;s fucking huge man</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have friends you don&rsquo;t have a life like</p>
<p>totally adults</p>
<p>think that they can just fucking take your kids and</p>
<p>snatch them out of some</p>
<p>place and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna hurt them to just</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna get used to</p>
<p>kansas right</p>
<p>you know and then they get douched on in</p>
<p>school and they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have any friends anymore meanwhile</p>
<p>they had the coolest friends</p>
<p>ever back home and wherever the fuck they&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a traumatic fucking</p>
<p>thing for yeah i</p>
<p>think as an</p>
<p>adult you just kind of</p>
<p>you do take some</p>
<p>level of friendship for</p>
<p>granted because you</p>
<p>start recognizing the</p>
<p>world as a relatively big</p>
<p>place in a positive sense</p>
<p>and that there are people to hang out with</p>
<p>everywhere you go</p>
<p>and you overlay that thought form on a new</p>
<p>brain it doesn&rsquo;t quite</p>
<p>land as well the</p>
<p>issue is i think that well you know</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s just a hurdle</p>
<p>and you got over it and</p>
<p>i got over it and most kids do get over it in fact it</p>
<p>could be argued that the best way to make an</p>
<p>interesting person is to put them through a fucked up</p>
<p>childhood absolutely</p>
<p>because pretty much everybody that i</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s interesting all of my friends had fucked up</p>
<p>childhoods i don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>normal friends were</p>
<p>they talk about</p>
<p>their childhood it was just</p>
<p>like my dad was always there for me took me to fucking</p>
<p>wrestling practice</p>
<p>every day and my mom always</p>
<p>baked cakes</p>
<p>none of that nobody i don&rsquo;t hear any of that shit</p>
<p>and most of the ones i do meet are relatively miserable</p>
<p>and i spend</p>
<p>a good deal of my time</p>
<p>entertaining a lot of them</p>
<p>and do you think that they&rsquo;re normal too</p>
<p>no i think they&rsquo;re just different in a different way</p>
<p>i think they sublimate</p>
<p>we need directions</p>
<p>for life god damn it we need a fucking</p>
<p>guide this is</p>
<p>ridiculous that we get</p>
<p>stuck into the most complicated puzzle any</p>
<p>living organism that we can comprehend</p>
<p>can go through the idea of</p>
<p>evolving as a</p>
<p>human being and becoming</p>
<p>a productive</p>
<p>member society getting your emotions in</p>
<p>order getting</p>
<p>your energy in</p>
<p>order getting your life in</p>
<p>order your friendships in order</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking uber complicated</p>
<p>here and we don&rsquo;t even have a guidebook</p>
<p>well but the</p>
<p>guidebook would be</p>
<p>wrong at the crucial</p>
<p>point is the problem and by the way we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried to set up</p>
<p>guidebooks that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>their religion</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s what but</p>
<p>would there be a way</p>
<p>to have a guidebook just for clarity of thinking</p>
<p>just objective clarity of</p>
<p>thinking and letting people</p>
<p>understand i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>giant percentage of what the problem with</p>
<p>human beings is</p>
<p>is that even if they find the answer</p>
<p>if the answer</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t jive</p>
<p>with their life</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not willing to accept it</p>
<p>they get angry</p>
<p>about whatever it is</p>
<p>everything has to bottleneck through</p>
<p>their their past</p>
<p>people just have</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>rigid ideas in</p>
<p>their head and once</p>
<p>those ideas</p>
<p>are challenged and then it becomes a battle for</p>
<p>their soul you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>you know they disagree</p>
<p>about an issue and i&rsquo;m not totally attached to it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had great conversations with people that are</p>
<p>super really</p>
<p>super appreciate</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re not attached to their idea</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re not like arguing</p>
<p>in a real personal way when it&rsquo;s like you know you</p>
<p>look when they&rsquo;re in not insecure</p>
<p>about it yeah they just have an idea</p>
<p>about things that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>human beings ever</p>
<p>evolved but the problem is</p>
<p>life is a big dick contest</p>
<p>and everyone wants</p>
<p>their idea to be the best idea</p>
<p>so they try to be forced</p>
<p>to be right than happy</p>
<p>yeah exactly yeah</p>
<p>exactly and the people who are always trying to be</p>
<p>right are never happy no</p>
<p>coincidentally</p>
<p>yeah always the most miserable</p>
<p>thing is the only</p>
<p>sense they have the most miserable people</p>
<p>the most who</p>
<p>always want to be</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>and even places</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>right like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>comic that i know</p>
<p>that would always criticize people&rsquo;s acts</p>
<p>and tell them like what are you doing this for man you</p>
<p>could do better than this and the guy liked his act</p>
<p>but his act is like</p>
<p>super juvenile</p>
<p>uh huh like that kind of shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what are you saying what you like</p>
<p>right you want everyone to like what you like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous it&rsquo;s absurd</p>
<p>you know for an extreme example it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things when i</p>
<p>laugh at people who go</p>
<p>off on nickelback or something like that or even carrot</p>
<p>top where you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>they literally go</p>
<p>with a bunch of</p>
<p>corporate assholes</p>
<p>who just sell</p>
<p>their shit you go wait a</p>
<p>minute what</p>
<p>elvis costello song</p>
<p>should they be doing in a coffee</p>
<p>house to make you</p>
<p>happy because</p>
<p>they exist even at balance</p>
<p>to help what you like</p>
<p>exist to some degree</p>
<p>and you need to</p>
<p>leave that shit</p>
<p>alone if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t resonate with you</p>
<p>knock who cares</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>successful is what it is it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>successful and it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>smooth and it&rsquo;s too packaged</p>
<p>what it is is they&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a good pop band</p>
<p>right but i mean it&rsquo;s like i met that nickelback</p>
<p>guy too it was they were doing a</p>
<p>thing yeah man recently</p>

<p>women these little girls are</p>
<p>fascinated by what this kid can do</p>
<p>and the difference between them and him</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a chasm between like a rat and a god</p>
<p>you know look at</p>
<p>these girls</p>
<p>in the audience they&rsquo;re staring at this kid now wait</p>
<p>wait till you hear this</p>

<p>background though listen to this kid&rsquo;s voice</p>
<p>got her hand on her yep</p>
<p>she starts playing with her hair</p>
<p>yep and her hand goes away and she</p>
<p>starts looking around the room</p>
<p>is everyone else</p>
<p>reacting this listen</p>
<p>to this fucking kid&rsquo;s</p>
<p>voice listen to this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never been that good at anything in my life and i</p>
<p>never will joe never listen</p>

<p>really joe never</p>
<p>never listen to this song</p>
<p>alone joe listen</p>
<p>dude listen to this kid&rsquo;s</p>
<p>voice this motherfucker&rsquo;s nailing this</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like 11</p>
<p>oh i get it</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s in front of a</p>
<p>talent contest nobody even knows he&rsquo;s doing this</p>
<p>this motherfucker is connecting to gaia right now</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a little kid</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s figured out how to do this</p>
<p>you know why he hasn&rsquo;t gotten any</p>
<p>pussy yet no one&rsquo;s broken his heart no one&rsquo;s taking his</p>
<p>money he&rsquo;s never had to work for</p>
<p>for food he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not getting in his own way is what it is exactly</p>
<p>listen to this</p>
<p>motherfucker i</p>
<p>think he needs to</p>
<p>check his ego though what</p>
<p>the girl who had her hand on her face was just riveting</p>
<p>that bitch is hypnotized she&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>every guy who fucks her for the rest of her life</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gonna be thinking</p>
<p>about this kid singing in the background</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gonna try to facebook him when she&rsquo;s 40 and</p>
<p>she has kids and divorced</p>
<p>totally she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never gonna forget this kid</p>
<p>ever and he</p>
<p>and his partner will be living happily in michigan</p>
<p>uh could be i wonder if this room</p>
<p>smells or might just john mayer this motherfucker yeah</p>
<p>i wonder if this room</p>
<p>smells the same at the end of this song as</p>
<p>when it started i</p>
<p>think it smells the same as a fish store no</p>
<p>it couldn&rsquo;t possibly their children</p>
<p>those little bitches are breeding man we got</p>
<p>hormones in the beef that&rsquo;s not what eggs smell</p>
<p>listen every one of those little fucks can get pregnant</p>
<p>if they were going</p>
<p>if they were banging they&rsquo;d have kids at all the kids</p>
<p>gorillas in the mist</p>
<p>yeah we are gorillas in the here&rsquo;s a thing to this is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a purity of emotion that he&rsquo;s connecting to</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the same as what&rsquo;s happening in that song</p>
<p>yeah what is fascinating it&rsquo;s his own</p>
<p>your raw fears as a kid your raw disconnection</p>
<p>that has nothing to do with the content</p>
<p>lyrics nothing just fits</p>
<p>right i mean he&rsquo;s singing about paparazzis</p>
<p>and cigarettes and you know</p>
<p>that shows you</p>
<p>about music man that</p>
<p>it really is like all art a window into purity</p>
<p>a window into</p>
<p>purity of expression it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>if you even know the words to what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>no well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s the resonant part yeah there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>sound freak</p>
<p>thing but when you hear words that nail it too then it</p>
<p>brings it another</p>
<p>level oh yeah</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s like the perfect lyric</p>
<p>along with the perfect music</p>
<p>music is such a trip man yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been rehearsal last</p>
<p>night for like</p>
<p>three and a half hours</p>
<p>and we were working on some</p>
<p>stuff and we were adding</p>
<p>songs to the lineup and</p>
<p>stuff that i hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>with my former bandmates</p>
<p>had never been able to</p>
<p>sort of get the vibe of</p>
<p>came really</p>
<p>naturally with these guys</p>
<p>and so it was like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing there</p>
<p>after the song going</p>
<p>oh that was</p>
<p>and your band is called zero one</p>
<p>right the word zero and the number one yeah</p>
<p>yeah but but</p>
<p>if you leave me alone</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing else to do if i don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>place to go or whatever what i do is</p>
<p>write music</p>
<p>and i can sit</p>
<p>with a guitar and</p>
<p>start writing</p>
<p>stuff and so the</p>
<p>and i and i</p>
<p>i feel like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>at a certain point</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;ve written songs that actually matter to me</p>
<p>and once you get to that</p>
<p>point you get that you get</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s spooky almost because you don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>you feel removed from yourself it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>great stand up when you do a show and</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching yourself from behind</p>
<p>like your body is acting out the</p>
<p>parts you&rsquo;re totally committed to what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>but part of you is like</p>
<p>your ego is not there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is and your real</p>
<p>spirit is like 10 feet you feel</p>
<p>like behind</p>
<p>you i always say that you feel like you&rsquo;re a passenger</p>
<p>yes you don&rsquo;t really feel like you&rsquo;re driving you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a passenger and i</p>
<p>guess you have your hand on the</p>
<p>brakes in case shit goes terribly</p>
<p>wrong totally</p>
<p>but you have maintenance</p>
<p>stuff to do yeah</p>
<p>yeah yeah but a lot of the times you know</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re just in the perfect groove yeah</p>
<p>everybody says the same</p>
<p>thing too you know i mean it&rsquo;s interesting it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a mechanic that happens</p>
<p>naturally i think</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s any kind of art like that and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the beauty is</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s singing</p>
<p>has nothing to do with what&rsquo;s in the words of that song</p>
<p>or what the intention</p>
<p>of the original artist was or any of it it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that those notes in that order</p>

<p>music he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>seven year old who does</p>
<p>this whatever</p>

<p>i can make a</p>
<p>monkey do it i can really take a kid</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a six year old</p>

<p>piss smelling cat house</p>
<p>yellow haired</p>
<p>girl wondering what</p>

<p>how do i get good yeah</p>
<p>how do i get good at this comedy</p>
<p>thing i got</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>weird moments</p>
<p>moments where i feel it all comes together</p>
<p>and i listen to this guy</p>
<p>sing this and i&rsquo;m like man this guy is not trying to be</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not trying to be anything</p>
<p>other than what he is</p>
<p>man i wish i was beautiful</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s dancing my god</p>
<p>tell him to stop</p>
<p>no this is a good fucking song dude</p>
<p>and that guy&rsquo;s in the groove man</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s singing this he&rsquo;s having fun he&rsquo;s relaxed</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not worried they mean it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my issue with any music</p>
<p>as long as you mean it i don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sincere dude this guy&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s in the groove</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in the groove</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>thinking that like man</p>
<p>if i could just get as relaxed as that fucking guy is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like 90 of it</p>
<p>getting to who the fuck you really are</p>
<p>you know ready set action fucking scammer and what huh</p>
<p>lights on you</p>
<p>microphone whoa is this even real life</p>
<p>right you like that little kid coming</p>
<p>back from the dentist it&rsquo;s all fucked up on drugs</p>
<p>90 of it is getting to what this guy&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>right now that&rsquo;s 10 000</p>
<p>hours man a lot of a lot of these guys</p>
<p>especially at this</p>
<p>to thinking to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the</p>
<p>hours 10 000</p>
<p>hours is the mastery number</p>
<p>you know but it&rsquo;s not just that there&rsquo;s 10 000</p>
<p>hours of open</p>
<p>micros that suck</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t get over the hump man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a time</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s a thing no i</p>
<p>agree but in his case</p>
<p>getting to a</p>
<p>level of good</p>
<p>getting to a</p>
<p>skill level</p>
<p>and then playing</p>
<p>probably at 15 years old they were probably</p>
<p>musically as good as they are now</p>
<p>physically like</p>
<p>you know as far as quality of play really yeah</p>
<p>are you a big</p>
<p>county crows fan you know no</p>
<p>but i mean like</p>
<p>the guys guys</p>
<p>in the black rose were like that a lot of</p>
<p>these bands</p>
<p>started out when they were 15 in high</p>
<p>school bands by the time this shit comes out they&rsquo;re 25</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been playing for 10 years</p>
<p>from high school bands to</p>
<p>legit playing through college always in bands doing it</p>
<p>again and again and</p>
<p>again fucking up getting better</p>
<p>and then at the end of it they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>i was as good a player</p>
<p>10 years ago as i am</p>
<p>right now but now i know what why i&rsquo;m playing the notes</p>
<p>as opposed to how to play them or</p>
<p>where you just know yourself more you know with</p>
<p>time as time goes on you just know what notes are you</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>resonates with you</p>
<p>you know to 90</p>
<p>of what it all</p>
<p>is is finding out what the fuck you do up there</p>
<p>every band starts off</p>
<p>almost diametrically opposed to</p>
<p>where they end up in a lot of cases and a lot of people</p>
<p>call it selling out or like look at the police</p>
<p>police is a</p>
<p>great example they&rsquo;re beginning</p>
<p>basically a punk band</p>
<p>and then by the time they hit</p>
<p>what was legit</p>
<p>who the police are as</p>
<p>artists everybody likes it it&rsquo;s very commercial and yet</p>
<p>still acceptable as genuine art</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost diametrically opposed to where they</p>
<p>started out sort of</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about that with some bands but i always attributed to</p>
<p>success fucking up</p>
<p>their motivation</p>
<p>i always say that</p>
<p>but sometimes someone has that pain</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have that pain anymore you</p>
<p>know when you have that struggle that the desire to be</p>
<p>loved the exceptional desire to be</p>
<p>loved i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where most music art anything really comes from right</p>
<p>and when you get rich and you&rsquo;re just banging all</p>
<p>these hot bitches</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>start singing uptown girl</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where it comes from</p>
<p>you know what i mean that&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>billy joel he&rsquo;s my perfect example</p>
<p>if you go and listen to old billy joel</p>
<p>even it&rsquo;s a guy singing in the</p>
<p>piano and that</p>
<p>might not be for you and i totally get</p>
<p>that but if</p>
<p>but just listen to what this guy&rsquo;s doing man</p>
<p>this is like real shit i</p>
<p>agree you know like the ballad of</p>
<p>billy the kid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a powerful fucking song captain jack</p>
<p>dude captain jack will get you high tonight</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great fucking song</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a beautiful song</p>
<p>about a dude who&rsquo;s in pain you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about a dude</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to figure out life that&rsquo;s a real song</p>
<p>you go from that to</p>
<p>uptown girl</p>
<p>right what happened</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think you were the master you tapped into the fucking</p>
<p>greek beyond</p>
<p>disconnect from</p>
<p>their pain it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist anymore different drugs you know well</p>
<p>i just had a</p>
<p>brain probably</p>
<p>yeah i think probably</p>
<p>anti white persons as</p>
<p>cocaine versus</p>
<p>cocaine alcohol</p>
<p>alcohol is an</p>
<p>earthbound drug</p>
<p>and thickens your</p>
<p>earthbound experience and</p>
<p>hallucinogenics and cocaine</p>
<p>are resonant</p>
<p>drugs that get you out of your body now you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>straight edge yeah you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>total straight edge</p>
<p>now this has been from</p>
<p>and if people don&rsquo;t know what that means</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s no drinking no drugs no nothing yeah coffee</p>
<p>on rare occasion but no not really that&rsquo;s as</p>
<p>strong as it gets yeah</p>
<p>and what is the rational</p>
<p>rationale for this it&rsquo;s a lot of reasons</p>
<p>it started out as</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m part native and</p>
<p>scottish it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a good idea to get go down that road alcohol lies</p>
<p>my family you know you go that road you keep walking it</p>
<p>yeah until you know it&rsquo;s natural and</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people lose</p>
<p>your family yeah</p>
<p>and not just my</p>
<p>direct family but</p>
<p>ancestral roots and it was</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i always joke it&rsquo;s kind of like the</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t drink the same reason</p>
<p>like a lot of jews don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drive german cars there&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>bit of like it was used as a weapon so fuck you right</p>
<p>the other reason is is i</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t want the</p>
<p>plant to become the</p>
<p>fertilizer and to</p>
<p>for me i wanted to find out who i was without</p>
<p>added elements or</p>
<p>added magnifying</p>
<p>glasses from the outside i wanted it to be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to me drugs represented sort of like</p>
<p>a trampoline that</p>
<p>allows you to see the top of the mountain</p>
<p>but if you want to get there you</p>
<p>still have to eventually get off the</p>
<p>trampoline and do the work</p>
<p>meditatively or focus</p>
<p>find yourself</p>
<p>you can see yourself on drugs i have no question</p>
<p>that there are people</p>
<p>especially higher</p>
<p>order drugs like pot and and</p>
<p>and and mushrooms and</p>
<p>those kind of like more organic drugs that</p>
<p>you know i think you can see the</p>
<p>essence of who you are and even the</p>
<p>essence of the universe through</p>
<p>those things i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>doubt that for a second</p>
<p>but you got</p>
<p>to come back and it&rsquo;s not your win necessarily</p>
<p>and i think you you</p>
<p>in your life</p>
<p>your your existence deserves</p>
<p>the respect of walking there yourself getting to that</p>
<p>space so that you can see it and say i own this space</p>
<p>as opposed to</p>
<p>somebody handed it to me that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>interesting way of looking at it here&rsquo;s a story</p>
<p>um a buddha</p>
<p>buddha ran into this monk</p>
<p>this monk was</p>
<p>walking to the town</p>
<p>and the monks at the buddha</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve practiced</p>
<p>a city of levitation</p>
<p>and i can now walk on</p>
<p>water i&rsquo;ve worked on this for the last 40 years</p>
<p>and the buddha looks at the monks and says</p>
<p>but the fairy&rsquo;s only a nickel</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an old terrence mckenna joke by the way sure sure</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an old</p>
<p>story that he used to</p>
<p>tell that&rsquo;s a true</p>
<p>story that the ideas</p>
<p>the idea behind it is</p>
<p>you can get there way quicker</p>
<p>i agree but</p>
<p>in this case the</p>
<p>ferry has rubber bands attached to the end of it that</p>
<p>bring you back</p>
<p>and and you can&rsquo;t stay</p>
<p>yeah but there&rsquo;s an element</p>
<p>something from it i thought without</p>
<p>personal experience</p>
<p>without you having the personal experience</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s i have</p>
<p>babies and i&rsquo;ve done mushrooms and i always tell people</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;ve done either one don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about sure because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the the</p>
<p>the experience of mushrooms is so much</p>
<p>more alien than you could ever</p>
<p>possibly imagine</p>
<p>and so the idea that you</p>
<p>could somehow</p>
<p>or another look at it from the outside and say well i</p>
<p>think it allows</p>
<p>you from the outside i don&rsquo;t know but i don&rsquo;t view</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t view it you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never done it i know</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m saying you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never not done it now yes i have i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lived a huge part of my life without doing it</p>
<p>but not as you now</p>
<p>but i did you are</p>
<p>until i was in my 30s okay but</p>
<p>still there is an element of</p>
<p>you are now you plus mushrooms</p>
<p>for the rest of your life</p>
<p>and for the</p>
<p>rest of your</p>
<p>experiential life</p>
<p>and the rest of your</p>
<p>how you see the</p>
<p>world and i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying that&rsquo;s a plus or a</p>
<p>minus insofar as the</p>
<p>worth of your life by any stretch but</p>
<p>i have made a choice</p>
<p>to be me as me</p>
<p>with no plus or mind i totally</p>
<p>see what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying and respect your choice</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is you</p>
<p>also talk anybody out</p>
<p>of it you are also you plus vitamins you are also you i</p>
<p>grace protein you plus</p>
<p>water and i</p>
<p>think we look at this idea of this drug</p>
<p>mm hmm especially</p>
<p>psychedelic drugs</p>
<p>right we look at the</p>
<p>idea as some sort of escape or some sort of forbidden</p>
<p>fruit or some sort of thing</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re supposed to be respected</p>
<p>i think if you</p>
<p>experience them and</p>
<p>understand what they&rsquo;re really about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot different than</p>
<p>it looks like from the outside</p>
<p>i can see the</p>
<p>ability in your</p>
<p>desire to get there on your own</p>
<p>right to use</p>
<p>meditation and</p>
<p>clear headed</p>
<p>thinking you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>obviously thought a lot you&rsquo;re very bright guy</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cool to have you on the show but why</p>
<p>thank you there&rsquo;s a big difference between that and a</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experience a</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experience so insanely infinitely humbling</p>
<p>i would not i</p>
<p>would not disagree with you on that fact</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>how come you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>unwilling to</p>
<p>allow them because i</p>
<p>think there is something insanely humbling</p>
<p>about seeking the purity</p>
<p>of my own essence</p>
<p>through no external</p>
<p>device other than my own concentration</p>
<p>and that has</p>
<p>worth to me</p>
<p>that insofar</p>
<p>as my life choices and my life directions</p>
<p>which is just as</p>
<p>valid as doing it</p>
<p>and i would</p>
<p>never dissuade someone to or from</p>
<p>the choice to do it or not do it</p>
<p>this has been</p>
<p>a direct choice i have made of my life</p>
<p>to see who i am</p>
<p>through my own</p>
<p>brain because</p>
<p>ultimately what what they do is</p>
<p>not alter your</p>
<p>brain chemistry but</p>
<p>ultimately release it</p>
<p>and i think that release is</p>
<p>still available to you without it now</p>
<p>people may disagree</p>
<p>with me on that and they&rsquo;re welcome too</p>
<p>but i have if</p>
<p>you can get</p>
<p>the mushrooms on your own good fucking lot that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of conceptually</p>
<p>yeah well you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t found out</p>
<p>who you are</p>
<p>right so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>searching for yourself you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>searching for to find out who you are you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t found that yet to</p>
<p>queue up the who</p>
<p>right now who are you</p>
<p>throw that shit on you want to put some real</p>
<p>music on for</p>
<p>brian to that shit up</p>
<p>show that shit on youtube</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s get something for the</p>
<p>youngsters so people won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand the purity of</p>
<p>expression who what</p>
<p>the who are you</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>huh yeah how dare you</p>
<p>use two hands of type this is important i</p>
<p>never listen to the who what</p>
<p>oh i&rsquo;ve actually</p>
<p>sung with roger</p>
<p>dalton dude</p>
<p>there was a concert this is all</p>
<p>legend by the way</p>
<p>there was a concert that they did</p>
<p>that the whose</p>
<p>performance was so badass that the rolling</p>
<p>stones didn&rsquo;t want the</p>
<p>video of it released</p>
<p>the who blew them off the</p>
<p>stage i know this song</p>
<p>how do you not know this song</p>
<p>cause it was on the</p>
<p>radio you would have to be</p>
<p>from another</p>
<p>fucking planet if you didn&rsquo;t know this song yeah</p>
<p>you have to be something</p>
<p>wrong with you</p>
<p>if you smoke two hits of the</p>
<p>stuff that i</p>
<p>smoke and you did</p>
<p>and you hear this</p>
<p>bro they didn&rsquo;t have the internet back then okay</p>
<p>this is during black and white tvs motherfucker</p>
<p>yeah this is the real shit</p>
<p>this is a lot like a studio video it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>they just got it right man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dan madonna</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s who he looks just like my friend</p>
<p>pete townsend</p>
<p>once impaled</p>
<p>his own hand on his whammy bar doing that big</p>
<p>really yeah hand flair</p>
<p>his whammy bar gets</p>
<p>stuck in the up position</p>
<p>oh my god holy shit yeah</p>
<p>that must be terrifying for a guitarist well it&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>right hand i mean he&rsquo;d manage</p>
<p>but your left hand i mean i</p>
<p>broke my ring finger on my</p>
<p>fretting hand</p>
<p>just one of the scariest</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>ever happened to me because of my ring finger</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your bending finger it&rsquo;s the root of all your</p>
<p>chords wow and</p>
<p>i made a decision when it happened</p>
<p>cause it has</p>
<p>three screws in it now</p>
<p>whoa i made a decision that it</p>
<p>would make me a better guitar player</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know how at the time</p>
<p>but i made that decision i remember</p>
<p>jangle reinhart who played with two fingers and</p>
<p>tony ayomi who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the tips on his fingers and i&rsquo;m like if</p>
<p>those fuckers can find their way</p>
<p>to being that</p>
<p>important guitar wise i can find my way back from this</p>
<p>huh and i ended up doing all the solos on my</p>
<p>first record with this broken finger</p>
<p>my old boxing</p>
<p>coach joe lake he got his finger bitten off in a</p>
<p>street fight</p>
<p>so he had his toe removed his</p>
<p>second toe not the big one the</p>
<p>second toe sure and permanently curved</p>
<p>like this so that he</p>
<p>could throw a</p>
<p>right hook he had a tremendous</p>
<p>right hook wow</p>
<p>so where his</p>
<p>index finger is</p>
<p>he has a toe</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s permanently curved</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>know they couldn&rsquo;t just you</p>
<p>know have it move</p>
<p>like normal</p>
<p>they just kind of had to</p>
<p>make this meaty hook thing</p>
<p>where his finger used to be</p>
<p>and he had it permanently like this so he</p>
<p>could keep punching</p>
<p>when i first got the finger</p>
<p>fixed they told me it would</p>
<p>never bend past there</p>
<p>it would always be stuck</p>
<p>kind of that as far as</p>
<p>it would go and i</p>
<p>have full articulation in it because i did acupuncture</p>
<p>oh that was the trick</p>
<p>acupuncture</p>
<p>did it yep hmm</p>
<p>it gave me full flexibility in it</p>
<p>my friend paul</p>
<p>broke his he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>broke his window he&rsquo;s closing his window</p>
<p>and the window shattered and his hand went through the</p>
<p>glass and it</p>
<p>severed the tendons on the last</p>
<p>three fingers of his hand</p>
<p>jesus and he went through a</p>
<p>bunch of operations but they couldn&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>right he just kept it stayed bent</p>
<p>yeah no matter what he did</p>
<p>so his last</p>
<p>three fingers were</p>
<p>basically constantly</p>
<p>closed yeah my friend andy had that same thing</p>
<p>where his ring</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a guitar player too his</p>
<p>pinky on that</p>
<p>finger is just</p>
<p>constantly like that and you</p>
<p>never notice when you&rsquo;re talking because</p>
<p>a lot of times</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s playing you&rsquo;re like oh he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how he plays it&rsquo;s pretty fascinating the</p>
<p>innovation they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>right now with artificial limbs and</p>
<p>totally artificial</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>that yeah that&rsquo;s really exponentially</p>
<p>exploding you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fascinating the concept of an</p>
<p>artificial body is only like a few decades away totally</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s really really pretty fucking</p>
<p>scary times you know</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>i mean not scary</p>
<p>bizer just exciting you</p>
<p>should say yeah</p>
<p>like whoa the fuck is happening yeah totally</p>
<p>well we can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>picture it which is kind of amazing we are literally</p>
<p>pre cell phone</p>
<p>humans about</p>
<p>like bionic</p>
<p>technology and</p>
<p>stuff and i&rsquo;m for it i&rsquo;m a big fan of</p>
<p>the longevity i&rsquo;m a big fan of</p>
<p>the you know the</p>
<p>harvard longevity projects</p>
<p>thousand year lifespan</p>
<p>concept and</p>
<p>yeah like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really working yeah but people have to die okay</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a problem with that</p>
<p>nobody wants to</p>
<p>start over from scratch as a baby</p>
<p>again but you</p>
<p>might have to okay</p>
<p>cause the deal is we can&rsquo;t go on forever there&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>fucking many of us well everybody lives forever this</p>
<p>is how we get off planet</p>
<p>this is how we get off planet</p>
<p>because you need</p>
<p>1000 your lifespan</p>
<p>otherwise you can&rsquo;t get to the next galaxy</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>essentially why really</p>
<p>what you really believe that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>yeah that if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get a</p>
<p>spaceship to leave the</p>
<p>earth and go to andromeda</p>
<p>or the next big star</p>
<p>that has livable planets next to it of which they</p>
<p>found 47 in the last year</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to have a lifespan at</p>
<p>least exceeding 250 years</p>
<p>and the ironic part my cousin and i always talk</p>
<p>about this is that</p>
<p>if you have a ship</p>
<p>leaves right now</p>
<p>headed to andromeda with people who can live to be</p>
<p>250 years old</p>
<p>by the time they get halfway there</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have doubled the</p>
<p>technology and</p>
<p>doubled our lifespan to the</p>
<p>point where we will actually meet them there</p>
<p>and the question will always</p>
<p>be do you stop and pick them up or do you just plan to</p>
<p>party when they arrive</p>
<p>the trip but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the nature of how</p>
<p>technology goes they said the</p>
<p>first person to live to be</p>
<p>250 is alive right now</p>
<p>and probably 15 years old</p>
<p>well you know here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other issue though what if there&rsquo;s another form of</p>
<p>space travel that we&rsquo;re just not aware of</p>
<p>i think this idea of</p>
<p>shooting rockets through</p>
<p>space is just i</p>
<p>think this is old</p>
<p>school man i</p>
<p>agree sundial i</p>
<p>agree well at</p>
<p>that point age</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter because you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>referentially in time</p>
<p>in space time you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still gonna</p>
<p>matter your biological</p>
<p>system can only stay</p>
<p>alive for a certain amount of</p>
<p>cycles you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be an end to it a certain amount of</p>
<p>heart beats it has on the meter</p>
<p>sure but you</p>
<p>might be able to generate</p>
<p>another one with your own stem cells or own and move</p>
<p>into it there&rsquo;s all kinds of yeah that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing you might be able to generate</p>
<p>countless copies of yourself</p>
<p>just to say we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve just decided to</p>
<p>paint them in other</p>
<p>ways i mean the concept of a soulmate</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between that and somebody you</p>
<p>share a soul with</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a one being with two</p>
<p>bodies you&rsquo;ve obviously</p>
<p>never been divorced</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know what the fuck you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge difference</p>
<p>at me when that</p>
<p>bitch is trying to get your</p>
<p>money they had nothing to do with souls you guys</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t connected anymore all</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>soulmates split up well no</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>all bitterness aside</p>
<p>earned no doubt earned</p>
<p>the concept is kind of like</p>
<p>in a fish tank if you look through</p>
<p>if you stuck</p>
<p>your fingers into a fish tank to the fish it sees</p>
<p>five different cylinders</p>
<p>that are not attached but if you keep pushing your hand</p>
<p>and you realize that they&rsquo;re all from the same thing</p>
<p>and so on a</p>
<p>three dimensional</p>
<p>world you could actually have one</p>
<p>that had several different expressions in this 3d</p>
<p>world and we only experienced them as kind of like</p>
<p>those cylinders</p>
<p>and once we see past that then we can see that actually</p>
<p>one soul may live you</p>
<p>may be one of 15 different versions of you in this life</p>
<p>right now there may be</p>
<p>a chinese peasant version of you and</p>
<p>a rich russian</p>
<p>version of you and</p>
<p>running around</p>
<p>learning all your lessons at once</p>
<p>hmm because time</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>and you chose in each time it&rsquo;s like when you play a</p>
<p>video game the</p>
<p>first time you play one</p>
<p>level but then</p>
<p>later on you get several games and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing one you&rsquo;re doing call of duty on one</p>
<p>thing and you go back to it</p>
<p>later but you want to play this new game for a while</p>
<p>and eventually you get a higher</p>
<p>order sort of</p>
<p>thinking with that</p>
<p>stuff when you</p>
<p>initially started out with</p>
<p>just this i</p>
<p>think we grow and evolve like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>serious speculation though</p>
<p>of course it is</p>
<p>speculating that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of yous running around living alternate lives</p>
<p>yeah mm hmm</p>
<p>you know i think more likely</p>
<p>more likely that the</p>
<p>whole concept of all of us</p>
<p>the whole concept of you and i and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>horseshit it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>trick it&rsquo;s like cubicles</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re all working on a little cubicle and</p>
<p>eventually is</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>something something whether it&rsquo;s a technological</p>
<p>achievement whether it&rsquo;s another advance in evolution</p>
<p>some new new</p>
<p>ability that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna detect</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have rather</p>
<p>okay i would call that</p>
<p>graduation i</p>
<p>think this is</p>
<p>i think this universe i</p>
<p>think we overreact</p>
<p>to the earth i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re too impressed and</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>earth is like</p>
<p>third to fifth</p>
<p>grade in the universal growth</p>
<p>scape of things</p>
<p>and i think we come here as</p>
<p>third graders</p>
<p>and ultimately and</p>
<p>leave as fifth graders</p>
<p>but what we</p>
<p>think is impressed by the</p>
<p>earth though</p>
<p>i mean we&rsquo;re overwhelmed by the</p>
<p>experience that we have here and</p>
<p>we think it&rsquo;s the be all end all and that this is</p>
<p>where all the</p>
<p>evolution will happen for your soul and your</p>
<p>spirit that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not another</p>
<p>place beyond this</p>
<p>that might be</p>
<p>at a higher resonance whether it&rsquo;s another galaxy or</p>
<p>another dimension if you want to use</p>
<p>earth type terms</p>
<p>or you just remove yourself and go</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s earth ends up being a</p>
<p>movie you watched</p>
<p>for several lifetimes</p>
<p>that you learned and you were</p>
<p>entertained by</p>
<p>but has nothing to do with your actual</p>
<p>existence you just gain information from it</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the evolution of humankind</p>
<p>once it sort of happens</p>
<p>the purpose of this</p>
<p>place sort of ends it&rsquo;s like you know you</p>
<p>leave college you don&rsquo;t evolve college</p>
<p>what do you mean by the purpose of this</p>
<p>place being</p>
<p>civilization not the</p>
<p>earth itself no no as</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>i mean the earth itself are our</p>
<p>expression in the</p>
<p>earth plane so you</p>
<p>think our future is somewhere else do you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s in another galaxy in a</p>
<p>dimension i mean i</p>
<p>think those are earth</p>
<p>based terms</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t even wrap our head around because we come here</p>
<p>i think intentionally</p>
<p>limiting our</p>
<p>experiential life we come</p>
<p>intentionally</p>
<p>we come here to limit</p>
<p>the same way that</p>
<p>when you go see a movie</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about the rest of the</p>
<p>world outside the</p>
<p>movie you think</p>
<p>about you sit you commit</p>
<p>to sitting in the dark in a theater with your ass in a</p>
<p>chair and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>total limitation of who you are</p>
<p>as a human being you</p>
<p>could run and jump and sing and play guitar and</p>
<p>fight and do all the shit</p>
<p>but you say no</p>
<p>right now what i</p>
<p>wanna do is</p>
<p>experience this so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna shut all that stuff out</p>
<p>cause if i did it i&rsquo;d be a toddler in a fucking</p>
<p>movie theater</p>
<p>irritating everyone which is</p>
<p>why we kill</p>
<p>those people why jesus</p>
<p>is basically like the one running around</p>
<p>going you can</p>
<p>laugh and dance and sing</p>
<p>here and we&rsquo;re like shut the fuck up we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>watch the movie</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m here to learn this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an element of and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s value to</p>
<p>those people coming in</p>
<p>going you guys do realize this is just a</p>
<p>movie okay so calm down</p>
<p>those guys are helpful</p>
<p>but to a certain</p>
<p>point they interrupt the</p>
<p>movie so we tend to go fuck off</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m saying is this earth</p>
<p>this space this i mean it</p>
<p>might just be it</p>
<p>might be the entire universe the entire span</p>
<p>of the human</p>
<p>existence from</p>
<p>cell you know</p>
<p>single cell life form to when we</p>
<p>colonize other planets</p>
<p>might be us</p>
<p>going through middle</p>
<p>school as spirits</p>
<p>and when we</p>
<p>graduate from that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that the</p>
<p>earth becomes</p>
<p>like oh we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;ve reached this</p>
<p>point we reach a</p>
<p>point and then we pop out and it</p>
<p>starts from scratch and a</p>
<p>cycle for new</p>
<p>spirits to grow into that</p>
<p>thing you know each each round</p>
<p>and then so we</p>
<p>leave and go</p>
<p>somewhere else yeah that&rsquo;s the idea or that or if</p>
<p>there is you know somewhere is</p>
<p>again and uh</p>
<p>a spatial concept</p>
<p>right so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>we might go</p>
<p>someone else</p>
<p>frequency we</p>
<p>might go somewhere else</p>
<p>someone else</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>conceptually</p>
<p>i think what</p>
<p>we do is when we get to exaggerate too caught up in the</p>
<p>earth plane</p>
<p>existence we go</p>
<p>the whole human race has to</p>
<p>reach a pinnacle belief</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an armageddon</p>
<p>thought form</p>
<p>in a positive or negative</p>
<p>sense we have to evolve to a point well</p>
<p>maybe we do as</p>
<p>individuals or as an</p>
<p>expression of a soul here</p>
<p>and then we just stop that</p>
<p>expression and go someplace else because we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned what this</p>
<p>place has to teach us</p>
<p>the same way</p>
<p>you enter middle</p>
<p>school you don&rsquo;t change middle school</p>
<p>by the time you</p>
<p>leave you just get to eighth</p>
<p>grade and go</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need middle</p>
<p>school anymore i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ready for high</p>
<p>school and that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t devalue middle</p>
<p>school it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still important</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gravely important</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to your social factor it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to</p>
<p>the learning that&rsquo;s in between</p>
<p>rudimentary and advanced</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got a point</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>whole point and if you go</p>
<p>life begins and end in middle</p>
<p>school and if we don&rsquo;t all these</p>
<p>get all these</p>
<p>sixth graders together we</p>
<p>gotta fucking win this</p>
<p>or you know</p>
<p>right so all the high</p>
<p>schools do you propose</p>
<p>not concentrating on the present</p>
<p>what do you do no no i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what your goal is and that&rsquo;s how you grow</p>
<p>to just live in the present yeah</p>
<p>and own that</p>
<p>self and just</p>
<p>so not not be attached to the idea of the earth</p>
<p>not be attached to the idea of this</p>
<p>existence yeah just kind of go through it</p>
<p>well no i mean you</p>
<p>enjoy it while you&rsquo;re here you have to have i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m believe in</p>
<p>seizing it this is all speculation right</p>
<p>course it is obviously it&rsquo;s supposed to be some</p>
<p>if i knew it i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have to be here i know but what i was</p>
<p>gonna say is it&rsquo;s interesting how the same</p>
<p>speculative</p>
<p>speculative ideas</p>
<p>keep coming</p>
<p>back and forth from like ancient eastern mysticism</p>
<p>to the idea of</p>
<p>reincarnation to</p>
<p>the idea of</p>
<p>you know the kaliuga</p>
<p>the ages of the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like all</p>
<p>these different philosophies throughout history</p>
<p>have all come</p>
<p>upon the same ideas over and over and over again</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they just</p>
<p>get to a certain</p>
<p>point where enough people are thinking</p>
<p>where they put enough</p>
<p>shit written down</p>
<p>so that enough people can</p>
<p>learn from the past shit</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>pile up like to the top of this pyramid of</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>and they all come to like</p>
<p>these same sort of</p>
<p>conclusions yeah i</p>
<p>think well i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re two sort of sets there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the mechanical sets most religious</p>
<p>sects have sort of an</p>
<p>esoteric teaching tradition</p>
<p>which is the</p>
<p>higher order you&rsquo;re only allowed to know these</p>
<p>secrets once you get</p>
<p>to a certain</p>
<p>point which we all</p>
<p>understand it&rsquo;s the gated community of</p>
<p>of spirituality you get it you got</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s controlled you got</p>
<p>well you do</p>
<p>have to do some work though yeah it is but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the idea behind it is</p>
<p>wrong you know</p>
<p>whenever you get people in a position of</p>
<p>power that are just holding back information that i</p>
<p>agree but i also think</p>
<p>there may be some value in</p>
<p>going you know your</p>
<p>resonant body isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ready to take this yet</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not just</p>
<p>gonna hand it over to you</p>
<p>gotta earn it</p>
<p>well i think</p>
<p>yeah well there&rsquo;s something to that for your own</p>
<p>for your own good</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>you know developing discipline</p>
<p>and learning how to</p>
<p>appreciate intelligence and</p>
<p>appreciate what exactly</p>
<p>yeah and i think that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>essence of where it</p>
<p>starts now now</p>
<p>human power grab later</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that all that being said</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>sort of the</p>
<p>esoteric traditions that you&rsquo;ll find in any</p>
<p>in any kind of higher</p>
<p>order thinking</p>
<p>come from a</p>
<p>level of discipline</p>
<p>and the idea of discipline</p>
<p>which is okay</p>
<p>because eventually you go why am i here what</p>
<p>am i actually attempting to do here on a cellular soul</p>
<p>level well also discipline i think is</p>
<p>maintenance</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a maintenance</p>
<p>sort of a strategy that you can run</p>
<p>on your body</p>
<p>and keeping your body in a</p>
<p>state where it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fuck with you</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give you</p>
<p>unnecessary information</p>
<p>and stays flat and</p>
<p>clean keeps it</p>
<p>focused in the present</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand hard work and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand like physical</p>
<p>limitations if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never pushed your endurance and broken yourself</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna know how your body responds</p>
<p>and how much of totally what you do in life is mental</p>
<p>how much of what you do in life is</p>
<p>about your attitude and maintaining a certain</p>
<p>point of focus and a certain way of</p>
<p>thinking and a certain resonance</p>
<p>of thinking</p>
<p>while that&rsquo;s developed to discipline</p>
<p>i agree get really good at something and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard you work hard at it what is the gym</p>
<p>but manufactured adversity</p>
<p>you create an adverse situation that was not there</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>these heavy</p>
<p>things do not need to be lifted off the ground</p>
<p>right now but in the future i may</p>
<p>have to deal with that and in the past i have and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>aware of those moments</p>
<p>where i was at the edge of my</p>
<p>experience and i need to</p>
<p>beyond that for me to be</p>
<p>happy and grow</p>
<p>so i specifically take time to</p>
<p>focus in this moment take</p>
<p>a potential adversity and past adversity</p>
<p>and focus it in this moment go i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go to the</p>
<p>gym and lift more weight than i&rsquo;ve ever lifted before</p>
<p>so that if it if my body is called to do such a thing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m able to do it comfortably</p>
<p>so that i can</p>
<p>focus on the higher</p>
<p>order element of it</p>
<p>so that the next time i lift</p>
<p>250 pounds i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going fuck 250</p>
<p>pounds i&rsquo;m lifting</p>
<p>250 pounds and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>focusing on my breath</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m focusing on my growth or my strength</p>
<p>or the amount of times i can do it as opposed to</p>
<p>everything is hard the first time</p>
<p>um so we set up</p>
<p>these situations</p>
<p>where we are</p>
<p>intentionally creating an adverse</p>
<p>experience there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to go to the gym</p>
<p>and work out</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to eat better</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to do you go all</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>quell my own</p>
<p>sense i&rsquo;m gonna discipline</p>
<p>my own relaxation reflex</p>
<p>because i want to accomplish something hmm</p>
<p>and i think the</p>
<p>earth is very similar i</p>
<p>think spirits create</p>
<p>manufactured adversity</p>
<p>we create this</p>
<p>space which is hard to get through</p>
<p>that has its challenges</p>
<p>and sometimes</p>
<p>we make it through and sometimes we fail and we go back</p>
<p>again and again</p>
<p>until we get past</p>
<p>these lessons</p>
<p>and then we become a higher resonant</p>
<p>being and we move to another level of</p>
<p>growth that may not be in</p>
<p>space time for</p>
<p>example is this something you&rsquo;re attached to um</p>
<p>no so no you</p>
<p>know i&rsquo;m saying i mean i&rsquo;m like are you convinced</p>
<p>this is how it goes</p>
<p>this how life goes down feels</p>
<p>right feels right yeah</p>
<p>sometimes to me it feels like the</p>
<p>whole thing is really a mathematical</p>
<p>equation and that well math is a language</p>
<p>the entire existence</p>
<p>of of the universe</p>
<p>everything that</p>
<p>every little</p>
<p>thing is happening and</p>
<p>every little</p>
<p>action that happens on</p>
<p>earth animals eating animals</p>
<p>water pollution</p>
<p>farms emotions</p>
<p>sex drugs rock and roll all of it together</p>
<p>each moment in each thing are</p>
<p>a part of a gigantic intangible algorithm</p>
<p>and that everything that has ever happened to you and</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever happened to anyone that you&rsquo;ll ever meet</p>
<p>and anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever happened that&rsquo;s all connected together all of it</p>
<p>is all moving</p>
<p>the human race towards one direction</p>
<p>much like a caterpillar</p>
<p>becomes a butterfly and isn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>aware what the</p>
<p>fuck it&rsquo;s doing it gets inside the cocoon sure</p>
<p>that everything we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is moving us into some new direction</p>
<p>everything from</p>
<p>the beginning to now is moving us into some i mean</p>
<p>if you look at what people are really concentrating on</p>
<p>right now the highest</p>
<p>levels of science</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the heart of matter oh yeah i mean the</p>
<p>large edges of the universe yeah</p>
<p>i mean yeah the edges of the universe the</p>
<p>heart of matter</p>
<p>the creation of artificial</p>
<p>black holes the idea of time travel</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really getting into the meat of</p>
<p>things sure but</p>
<p>in many ways</p>
<p>early human</p>
<p>societies thought they were getting to the meat of</p>
<p>things and it just became a new blossoming</p>
<p>level became a new</p>
<p>grade as it were</p>
<p>in that school you know</p>
<p>early societies</p>
<p>right but early societies if they were constantly</p>
<p>searching for new</p>
<p>things and constantly trying to</p>
<p>innovate and constantly trying to</p>
<p>come up with the next new invention</p>
<p>which they always were</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building towards something</p>
<p>this thirst for</p>
<p>innovation at a certain</p>
<p>point in time it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t become a matter of</p>
<p>what makes your life easier</p>
<p>innovation becomes</p>
<p>a matter what else can we do can we do this</p>
<p>and it becomes almost like a life of its own</p>
<p>instead of you creating</p>
<p>things to help people</p>
<p>getting interested and fascinated</p>
<p>about these various</p>
<p>things people say well that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>everything gets made and how</p>
<p>we have all</p>
<p>these advances in science and</p>
<p>medicine and</p>
<p>we can help people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all because of science</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t criticize science like</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s criticizing anything i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>absolutely not criticizing it but i just</p>
<p>looking at it objectively like this idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re constantly trying to come up with the newest</p>
<p>greatest thing</p>
<p>and this idea</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re trying to constantly get to the heart of</p>
<p>everything the</p>
<p>heart of matter</p>
<p>the milliseconds</p>
<p>after the big bang</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna stop that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna keep going</p>
<p>you know the interesting</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>big bang theory was that they</p>
<p>wrecking they</p>
<p>i think was like two weeks ago</p>
<p>they came up with this new postulate</p>
<p>that seems to be</p>
<p>mathematically sound that</p>
<p>the big bang was not the beginning of anything but a</p>
<p>another wave in a</p>
<p>series of similar actions</p>
<p>and that it there was no</p>
<p>first beginning</p>
<p>yeah that there were many</p>
<p>beginnings and it comes in tides and what we are is</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>were plankton</p>
<p>who think that</p>
<p>every wave is our</p>
<p>whole life right</p>
<p>and thinking that oh this waves</p>
<p>began when it crested</p>
<p>and dies when it hits the shore</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that same water is reused</p>
<p>again and again in an infinite</p>
<p>series of waves and that</p>
<p>those plankton live and die in that period</p>
<p>until they evolve past a</p>
<p>point where they can either</p>
<p>crawl up on</p>
<p>shore or go out to sea</p>
<p>and then their</p>
<p>experience becomes longer</p>
<p>now my experience on the shore is</p>
<p>waves come and hit me</p>
<p>every four and i have a lifespan</p>
<p>where five waves hit me</p>
<p>or i&rsquo;m out in the sea and</p>
<p>i live five cycles</p>
<p>you know and then i get</p>
<p>more advanced and more advanced</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m moving inland and i</p>
<p>never experienced the</p>
<p>flow of the sea anymore i have to go back to the sea</p>
<p>to recognize there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cycle at all</p>
<p>cause i live</p>
<p>in land and now it&rsquo;s weather patterns that are</p>
<p>months and months long and</p>
<p>then years and then you know as you grow into that span</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>right now we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re then</p>
<p>again and again</p>
<p>and we think and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s millennia for us</p>
<p>but in terms of what life could be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that hmm</p>
<p>i think our biological</p>
<p>need to stay</p>
<p>alive our instincts to survive our instincts to</p>
<p>think that we</p>
<p>are special and we are important we do matter</p>
<p>cause we didn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>and if you do look at yourself in the</p>
<p>great picture of</p>
<p>things you go god this is all meaningless this is</p>
<p>pointless know this is</p>
<p>this is no need</p>
<p>for me to even be paying attention here yeah</p>
<p>no you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the idea being that you know we are</p>
<p>this biological entity that does need to stay</p>
<p>alive but we are</p>
<p>aware of how</p>
<p>ridiculous that all is</p>
<p>all at the same time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very conflicting</p>
<p>existence plus</p>
<p>we have this hardware</p>
<p>that is basically the same shit we were</p>
<p>using when we were throwing</p>
<p>sticks at woolly mammoths</p>
<p>i mean basically that was 11 000 years ago</p>
<p>we had the same hardware</p>
<p>then as we have now that&rsquo;s true but we were using</p>
<p>greater and</p>
<p>greater percentages of it</p>
<p>what do you mean by that</p>
<p>brain pan we</p>
<p>still use you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at six percent of the</p>
<p>human brain you&rsquo;re looking at cro magnon man using</p>
<p>about three</p>
<p>yeah but it&rsquo;s not all</p>
<p>right because you know cro magnon man</p>
<p>neanderthal rather had a larger</p>
<p>brain than we did</p>
<p>yeah and it was dumber than we are</p>
<p>right but cows have a bigger</p>
<p>brain than we do too and with it</p>
<p>yeah fortunately</p>
<p>though they don&rsquo;t sure but intellectually it&rsquo;s not what</p>
<p>you have in the</p>
<p>brain pan area it&rsquo;s how much of it you</p>
<p>use and to what coordination</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>synaptic firing between different areas that</p>
<p>court that make it happen</p>
<p>right but that</p>
<p>whole you only use 6</p>
<p>of your brain</p>
<p>thing i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s potential</p>
<p>essentially</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s science i</p>
<p>think what that</p>
<p>is is a misunderstanding of what the brain does</p>
<p>i mean we don&rsquo;t really know we&rsquo;re just sort of</p>
<p>guessing like</p>
<p>there was some fucking</p>
<p>a post that i put up is a</p>
<p>study on conservatives</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain area of conservative</p>
<p>brains that deals with fear</p>
<p>that is larger</p>
<p>than on their</p>
<p>liberal counterpoints</p>
<p>which is fascinating</p>
<p>so i put this</p>
<p>of course a fucking</p>
<p>hundred thousand dudes</p>
<p>you are so fucking dumb</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re goddamn liberal</p>
<p>this is reactive</p>
<p>fearfully this</p>
<p>one dude sent me like 15</p>
<p>tweets in a row</p>
<p>by the way i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>more of a republican than i am a democrat i</p>
<p>would vote for</p>
<p>ron paul in a heartbeat</p>
<p>for president i believe in that guy</p>
<p>well he is i mean he</p>
<p>might not be but he is he&rsquo;s an old</p>
<p>school republican</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>legit conservative</p>
<p>okay definitely</p>
<p>the fucking guy</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even believe in</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s a creationist</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a legit conservative</p>
<p>but yet i support him</p>
<p>i support that guy and his ideas more than i do most</p>
<p>liberals who want to just</p>
<p>throw money at</p>
<p>things you know i</p>
<p>think you look at it you know it from</p>
<p>just a natural perspective of</p>
<p>evolution like</p>
<p>the the issue isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>throwing money at things</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s not money just</p>
<p>attention yeah</p>
<p>money is just and</p>
<p>dis affected attention basically</p>
<p>what we used to do</p>
<p>is keep grandma at home</p>
<p>and give her our attention in person</p>
<p>now there is a way i can give her my attention</p>
<p>without having to be there at the time</p>
<p>so i can pay for her to be in a home</p>
<p>where other people are paid to give her attention</p>
<p>meaning feed her</p>
<p>cloth her wash her</p>
<p>provide all this</p>
<p>thing and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>money is our way of</p>
<p>going look i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t give you my genuine emotional attention</p>
<p>i have gathered a</p>
<p>pile of attention</p>
<p>and i can give</p>
<p>you some of it in this way but i can&rsquo;t do it from here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not practical</p>
<p>and i have people in my life that actually</p>
<p>deserve that at a higher</p>
<p>level my actual personal attention</p>
<p>money is just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an intermediary it has no</p>
<p>worth accept ideas</p>
<p>and and and</p>
<p>it well i mean does mean</p>
<p>it does a lot of</p>
<p>things i know but it does</p>
<p>it it does whatever you want it to do because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where you put your attention</p>
<p>right but what i</p>
<p>think what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about though is</p>
<p>taxes we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is you</p>
<p>know democrats</p>
<p>versus republicans that they believe that the</p>
<p>democrats want to</p>
<p>throw more money at</p>
<p>sure also where do you</p>
<p>think your attention needs to go the real</p>
<p>issue is not that the real</p>
<p>issue is not</p>
<p>where they throw in the</p>
<p>money the real</p>
<p>issue is where are you getting</p>
<p>money from the real</p>
<p>issue is who the fuck</p>
<p>is financing your campaigns who</p>
<p>are you really be holding to once you get into office</p>
<p>are you really acting for the individual</p>
<p>cause you know you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re not really</p>
<p>the united corporations of america is what it is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what it is on the corporation yeah</p>
<p>this distraction of</p>
<p>tax cuts and this and that and</p>
<p>the real issue is</p>
<p>if we weren&rsquo;t involved in</p>
<p>these gigantic wars and we just instead</p>
<p>spent the same amount of</p>
<p>money fixing up the ghettos</p>
<p>jesus fucking</p>
<p>christ we could fix</p>
<p>everything in this country</p>
<p>we would have no problems none</p>
<p>we would have zero</p>
<p>crime if you went you</p>
<p>could take the trillions of dollars we</p>
<p>spent on this war</p>
<p>and just create social programs</p>
<p>where you hire</p>
<p>people who are like experienced counselors</p>
<p>who are really educated</p>
<p>and pay them a good salary so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a nice job and help them with kids</p>
<p>that are fatherless</p>
<p>and develop community after</p>
<p>school programs that&rsquo;s not fucking rockets</p>
<p>going to afghanistan</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way cheaper than that totally</p>
<p>all this can be done</p>
<p>all this can be done if you wanted to really fix the</p>
<p>world that&rsquo;s the way to do it i totally agree</p>
<p>and their tax cuts you&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s not what it all is</p>
<p>where you put it</p>
<p>and we need a totally new way of looking at the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>we need to look at the</p>
<p>whole thing as</p>
<p>we really are</p>
<p>all the same thing</p>
<p>and just because that guy is over there</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not connected to you interestingly enough</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way the vast</p>
<p>majority of the world is</p>
<p>going thought form wise and</p>
<p>the the ruling</p>
<p>elite and who have been in</p>
<p>power for quite some time</p>
<p>are dealing with that fact and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>happy about it but if you look at</p>
<p>even statistical</p>
<p>trends in life</p>
<p>expectancy and family size</p>
<p>which used to be the big fear that</p>
<p>you know first</p>
<p>world nations</p>
<p>long life small families</p>
<p>third world nation</p>
<p>short life big families this</p>
<p>used to be the and that was the big fear here comes the</p>
<p>march of the poor people</p>
<p>this is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen statistically</p>
<p>over the since the 1970s</p>
<p>its you can even watch the</p>
<p>graph there&rsquo;s a guy on uh ted</p>
<p>conference who</p>
<p>show who does an animated</p>
<p>graph of of</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s going and it used to be exactly that</p>
<p>india china</p>
<p>the southeast asia</p>
<p>in general africa</p>
<p>it was all this like low lifespan way down here</p>
<p>and and lots of kids</p>
<p>and then over here in the west</p>
<p>very few two kids or less</p>
<p>and long life fans and everybody is</p>
<p>marching this direction</p>
<p>hmm everybody</p>
<p>worldwide africa</p>
<p>india china</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going smaller families</p>
<p>longer lives</p>
<p>and this is and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unquestionable it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shocking to look at how fast</p>
<p>because as much as the</p>
<p>population bloomed</p>
<p>we look at those</p>
<p>graphs and go holy shit look at all the new people</p>
<p>the shift back</p>
<p>the other direction is really impressive</p>
<p>hmm nature&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>motherfucker dude yep you know the the the complex</p>
<p>structure of all the</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on behind the scenes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fascinating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll tell you how to be we were talking</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>about the the concept of a tax sperm or</p>
<p>when we did the show yeah</p>
<p>right blocking</p>
<p>sperm they also have the ones that run interference</p>
<p>and fighting</p>
<p>sperm there&rsquo;s so much shit</p>
<p>going on behind the scenes</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just running</p>
<p>around living our lives as if we&rsquo;re in control like</p>
<p>you are in control of like the eyeballs you got the</p>
<p>steering wheel behind the eyeballs</p>
<p>all the shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on down there</p>
<p>you literally you can move</p>
<p>it you have no idea what the fuck is happening inside</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a clue well your</p>
<p>worlds and nations</p>
<p>your consciousness is probably</p>
<p>a mild percentage of your</p>
<p>existence of your actual</p>
<p>soul existence your metaphysical existence</p>
<p>because it couldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t have it all here at once</p>
<p>or it would just be overwhelming you</p>
<p>would just blast</p>
<p>light out of</p>
<p>every cell or something because</p>
<p>everything would be so alive</p>
<p>and so full of consciousness at the same time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a trip to</p>
<p>think that you contain a</p>
<p>bunch of different life forms inside your body</p>
<p>like bacterias and</p>
<p>you need them to stay alive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just nuts in and of itself totally</p>
<p>whole ecosystems inside your body</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like when people get like</p>
<p>i want to be</p>
<p>commuted i want to be food for maggots and like</p>
<p>dude do you realize how many</p>
<p>living things are eating your skin cells</p>
<p>right now and if they didn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>would suffocate</p>
<p>yeah what you&rsquo;re doing is just being a</p>
<p>greedy fuck</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to play you know like you have to</p>
<p>leave so you unplug the</p>
<p>atari and you take it with you</p>
<p>right exactly</p>
<p>yeah let it melt into the ground</p>
<p>let the bacteria</p>
<p>eat it that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re here for exactly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a system</p>
<p>no we got a</p>
<p>wrap it in a steel box</p>
<p>half the time</p>
<p>those habits came because we didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>when people were dead we thought comas and accidents</p>
<p>that stillness was</p>
<p>death so we would</p>
<p>bury people who were</p>
<p>still alive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the bells and</p>
<p>cemeteries come from they used to have a bell</p>
<p>in a cemetery</p>
<p>oh jeez it literally was tied to your</p>
<p>string to your finger</p>
<p>through a tube that went down the ground</p>
<p>and if you rang</p>
<p>if you were</p>
<p>alive in the castle they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>fucking come out and dig your ass up crazy</p>
<p>but the reason we</p>
<p>built harder and harder caskets is because</p>
<p>we were terrible at telling who was dead oh my god</p>
<p>they still fuck up</p>
<p>every now and</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s some internet</p>
<p>story of someone</p>
<p>who thought some old lady was dead and she pops back</p>
<p>out and ask</p>
<p>for spaghetti a ton of fun</p>
<p>mortality man that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>motherfucker that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s afraid of that&rsquo;s what no one wants to talk</p>
<p>about the inevitable end of the trip</p>
<p>mm hmm right</p>
<p>a motherfucker dude</p>
<p>yeah but doesn&rsquo;t it make</p>
<p>you know all the rest of it a lot more</p>
<p>tasty it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gas if you can really</p>
<p>intellectualize it if you</p>
<p>could really</p>
<p>wrap your head around it but most of us can&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i can</p>
<p>no i pretend to be able to wrap my head around</p>
<p>it but the end really it&rsquo;s when it comes we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>gonna be white</p>
<p>knuckle and shit in our pants</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no doubt</p>
<p>about it man you know no i&rsquo;ve seen like i</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen some people go through the</p>
<p>the transition as it were</p>
<p>if you want</p>
<p>to call it that and i&rsquo;ve seen people die and i&rsquo;ve like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not always that experience you always hear that</p>
<p>story about sam kennison remember when sam died</p>
<p>he was laying there and he</p>
<p>those why he was saying why</p>
<p>now why now he was looking at somebody in the distance</p>
<p>and he said why now and then he finally went</p>
<p>oh i see okay yeah well</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>about dmt right</p>
<p>sure the brain</p>
<p>releasing it</p>
<p>and upon them</p>
<p>theoretically</p>
<p>releasing it at</p>
<p>great moments of</p>
<p>great stress or</p>
<p>at the moment of</p>
<p>human death</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason why</p>
<p>that would be an</p>
<p>evolutionary change that</p>
<p>would be a consciousness choice</p>
<p>but it would not be an</p>
<p>evolutionary change</p>
<p>because nobody lives past that point</p>
<p>so the idea is that that&rsquo;s a gateway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a chemical gateway into the next state</p>
<p>that helps you kick the body away and move on and the</p>
<p>thing about the dmt</p>
<p>experience is they talk</p>
<p>to you they talk to you a lot they say all kinds of</p>
<p>crazy shit to you</p>
<p>and they say</p>
<p>things to you in a language</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t really hear</p>
<p>you you just know</p>
<p>exactly what the words are the words like appear in</p>
<p>front of your face and you know they&rsquo;re saying it right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>trippy but it&rsquo;s the type of</p>
<p>thing that you say well if a guy you know was</p>
<p>dying and as he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dying starts talking well that guy&rsquo;s tripping</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that is</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>and then the question comes up is it real</p>
<p>or is it just is he on drugs</p>
<p>you know is it all just nonsense and is the idea of</p>
<p>snow is it just sexy</p>
<p>you know the idea of</p>
<p>on a purely</p>
<p>biological level</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason</p>
<p>for that to</p>
<p>exist because again</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s made</p>
<p>what exists nobody mates</p>
<p>after that point</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no service to the actual life form</p>
<p>to let it go</p>
<p>peacefully if anything the opposite is true</p>
<p>if a life form at the end of its life if</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>about biology</p>
<p>what you would do is</p>
<p>flip out you</p>
<p>would be like chris</p>
<p>in blade runner you just kind of</p>
<p>wiggle and freak out because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all that matters is get back to life</p>
<p>biologically</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only way you</p>
<p>would live to mate again</p>
<p>and pass on that</p>
<p>trait to anyone else</p>
<p>but if you have</p>
<p>an end of life</p>
<p>experience that softens the</p>
<p>experience and</p>
<p>brings you someplace</p>
<p>else that&rsquo;s a chemical expression</p>
<p>which by the way is just energy and information</p>
<p>that comes from consciousness anyways you create</p>
<p>through your you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no root</p>
<p>to consciousness there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t find it and cut it out of the</p>
<p>brain doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>right you can cut the</p>
<p>expression out of the</p>
<p>brain the ability to express it like movement and</p>
<p>speech but you can&rsquo;t take the</p>
<p>thing itself away</p>
<p>look under petri</p>
<p>dish and say this is</p>
<p>where thought is well you know the idea of it being non</p>
<p>local you know it&rsquo;s like a deep prox</p>
<p>chopra right</p>
<p>idea he&rsquo;s always pimping</p>
<p>the idea of i shouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>pimping he&rsquo;s a nice guy</p>
<p>the idea that you know</p>
<p>that consciousness is like something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>out there outside of it and your body is sort of a</p>
<p>vessel for it</p>
<p>and just holds to cut it loose</p>
<p>comfortably because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going from a totally different it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>coming out of surgery</p>
<p>where they give you painkillers</p>
<p>they would need to</p>
<p>or you would flip out</p>
<p>there there&rsquo;s something on the</p>
<p>other side going look we got it he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be in so much pain coming out of this</p>
<p>experience into the new</p>
<p>experience of being healed and different</p>
<p>um we got it there&rsquo;s got to be a</p>
<p>transition between the two</p>
<p>so they give you pain</p>
<p>medication when you&rsquo;re coming out of</p>
<p>anesthesia will know</p>
<p>at the beginning like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re back a lot of people</p>
<p>after they&rsquo;re waking up they&rsquo;ll get them</p>
<p>right on pain</p>
<p>medications</p>
<p>essentially so that when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>waking up they&rsquo;re not in horrible pain oh okay so um</p>
<p>in essence that&rsquo;s what the dmt</p>
<p>would serve</p>
<p>if you were looking at it from a consciousness</p>
<p>standpoint is that you&rsquo;re moving from the</p>
<p>earth plane to a non</p>
<p>earth plane</p>
<p>right or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just getting fucked up on drugs as a nice little</p>
<p>treat here you go life&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>go for a ride</p>
<p>well last trip</p>
<p>exactly but why</p>
<p>would you treat yourself why not that your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s got some leftover shit just look at this dude&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dying give him a give him a shot see but it</p>
<p>would do the opposite well</p>
<p>a lot of people when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dying they get hard ons too</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true there&rsquo;s some there&rsquo;s some sort of a disease</p>
<p>like where as guys are</p>
<p>dying god damn it what is it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>where men as they&rsquo;re dying</p>
<p>regularly get erections</p>
<p>right before death</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s dying of</p>
<p>i believe some sort of poison perhaps</p>
<p>fuck me i hate not knowing this shit</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>familiar with this</p>
<p>but it happens</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost like your body&rsquo;s like one last chance</p>
<p>right blow a nut</p>
<p>like your body knows</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over your body&rsquo;s like dealing with an overwhelming</p>
<p>you know number of</p>
<p>things shutting down</p>
<p>liver shutting down boss</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re losing the</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re losing the central nervous</p>
<p>system pressure</p>
<p>should fire up the dick</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go out in a</p>
<p>blaze of glory</p>
<p>right you know your body just fucking</p>
<p>every beverage fucking sperm</p>
<p>get in the balls</p>
<p>right get in the balls</p>
<p>boys find somebody</p>
<p>as the moment of</p>
<p>death your dick</p>
<p>as hard as a crowbar just hoping some whore</p>
<p>spots it and just dives on it real</p>
<p>quick right</p>
<p>i bet it&rsquo;s happened somewhere</p>
<p>along the line it&rsquo;s probably been an effective</p>
<p>strategy it</p>
<p>might have been</p>
<p>you know part of the sex</p>
<p>rights of you know</p>
<p>higher tradition but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of whores out there if there&rsquo;s a hard dick in</p>
<p>front of them they&rsquo;ll just hop on it</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>themselves there&rsquo;s a lot of girls who like that</p>
<p>especially thousands and thousands of years ago</p>
<p>back when they didn&rsquo;t even have written language</p>
<p>yeah of course it just dive on dick so it really like</p>
<p>it made them</p>
<p>horse then well it just horse</p>
<p>they just are</p>
<p>no they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re just diving on dicks</p>
<p>they might not even know that guy they might be</p>
<p>nurses they</p>
<p>might be just</p>
<p>in the room</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>getting paid what you mean is sluts</p>
<p>yeah and sluts</p>
<p>eliminates some</p>
<p>that as a concept eliminates the choice on the</p>
<p>woman&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s somehow broken and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t derive</p>
<p>pleasure from</p>
<p>it or whatever it makes by the way very male</p>
<p>fascinating</p>
<p>concept but</p>
<p>in spain they</p>
<p>force prostitutes to</p>
<p>start wearing yellow</p>
<p>reflector vests</p>
<p>because too many of them were getting hit by cars</p>
<p>because you know they hang out in the</p>
<p>street thinking</p>
<p>ahead picking</p>
<p>things up that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>cause prostitution is</p>
<p>legal in spain</p>
<p>yeah they force</p>
<p>these chicks</p>
<p>to make them sick</p>
<p>looking for a good in</p>
<p>a reflector vest in a helmet</p>
<p>god damn you imagine getting a blowjob</p>
<p>from a chick with a</p>
<p>reflector vest on</p>
<p>you fuck is</p>
<p>wrong slow for the cone zone you</p>
<p>just sitting there as the cars</p>
<p>drive by and the</p>
<p>lights from</p>
<p>their headlights</p>
<p>flash off that</p>
<p>reflector vest</p>
<p>you start wondering</p>
<p>about your choices</p>
<p>her bad breath blowjob</p>
<p>stinking up your fucking car you like</p>
<p>how many loads does she have fermenting in her</p>
<p>mouth right now</p>
<p>wonder how many crossing</p>
<p>guards get mistaken for hookers out there a lot</p>
<p>yeah they better wear some low</p>
<p>shoes crossing</p>
<p>guards you know they used to try to be all sexy</p>
<p>and shit you can&rsquo;t pull that off and your heels are out</p>
<p>no clear hands for</p>
<p>crossing guards</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m glad we settled all this</p>
<p>which is the good part</p>
<p>yeah we fucking locked it all down dude</p>
<p>it was a lot of confusion when we</p>
<p>started this podcast i</p>
<p>think a lot of it has been</p>
<p>cleared up a lot of apprehension</p>
<p>a lot of concern nervousness</p>
<p>yeah man about yeah</p>
<p>you know whether or not</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re here for any</p>
<p>particular reason yeah it&rsquo;s you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an interesting</p>
<p>thing to talk</p>
<p>about and speculate but</p>
<p>ultimately the most important thing is</p>
<p>the quality of the</p>
<p>experience while you&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>you know have fun</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re here i</p>
<p>agree that&rsquo;s because it can be fun</p>
<p>that is the one</p>
<p>thing that you can control</p>
<p>that here can be fun if you surround yourself with cool</p>
<p>people if you surround yourself with positive people</p>
<p>you do what you&rsquo;re supposed to be</p>
<p>doing in life you know find a path that makes you feel</p>
<p>happy you can</p>
<p>ultimately you can have this can be a good goddamn time</p>
<p>absolutely that&rsquo;s why we need</p>
<p>directions you know we need like someone needs to like</p>
<p>help people</p>
<p>okay figure out from the</p>
<p>write it out dude like the georgia</p>
<p>stones those</p>
<p>those fucking so</p>
<p>you ever seen</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>they call it the georgia</p>
<p>stonehenge but</p>
<p>the georgia wisdom</p>
<p>stones or something like that and</p>
<p>it was in the 1970s</p>
<p>somebody had it constructed in 12 different languages</p>
<p>in case of an</p>
<p>apocalypse there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these gigantic</p>
<p>stone tablets with</p>
<p>all these different directions on how to</p>
<p>live georgia</p>
<p>guide stones i believe it is oh nice</p>
<p>right pull that shit up so you</p>
<p>can georgia</p>
<p>yeah yeah in the</p>
<p>state of georgia or the country of georgia</p>
<p>state in america some guy who is a</p>
<p>thing they don&rsquo;t know if he was</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know exactly who he is because uh apparently</p>
<p>it was anonymous georgia</p>
<p>guidestones</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>and and it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know keep humanity to</p>
<p>under five hundred million people</p>
<p>worldwide that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>one of the principles</p>
<p>sure which is a good one you know</p>
<p>which is what an agoraphobic</p>
<p>millionaire who</p>
<p>would make a</p>
<p>bunch of guidestones</p>
<p>would write</p>
<p>true but you know</p>
<p>there is a certain amount of</p>
<p>resources and a certain amount of people and when the</p>
<p>people go over the resources it&rsquo;s really not i would</p>
<p>say get off planet then</p>
<p>no yeah but</p>
<p>that seems way harder than you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that seems like</p>
<p>super super</p>
<p>difficult there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>micro meteors</p>
<p>out there there&rsquo;s 900</p>
<p>000 near earth</p>
<p>objects just between mars and jupiter right</p>
<p>and any one of them will just</p>
<p>fuck you up</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out there flying around in a big</p>
<p>ship we used to live at the bases</p>
<p>of volcanoes</p>
<p>cause it was warm</p>
<p>like still do in hawaii</p>
<p>i know but we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>you know what i mean as insofar</p>
<p>as culture we come a long way in that regard we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of shit on this planet that can fucking kill you</p>
<p>randomly and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still outnumbering</p>
<p>everything i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>quicker to protect yourself and safer</p>
<p>and more likely</p>
<p>to protect yourself</p>
<p>from the shit that can fuck you up here</p>
<p>except for the big ones like asteroid impacts</p>
<p>except for one of the</p>
<p>things you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna run into</p>
<p>life expansion that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna outweigh the space</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like saying look</p>
<p>the ocean is fucking dangerous our boats are little</p>
<p>brown things</p>
<p>with paddles</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no fucking way we&rsquo;re getting from hawaii</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s lots of pineapple and</p>
<p>everything is fine as long as we</p>
<p>have our little</p>
<p>march to the top of the volcano and dump off</p>
<p>the useless people</p>
<p>every once in a while or</p>
<p>a minor plague wipes out a decent number of us on a</p>
<p>cycle we don&rsquo;t need to head to the</p>
<p>other continents we don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to express ourselves and find out what the rest of the</p>
<p>earth is like we have</p>
<p>98 of this world is unexplored in a lot of ways</p>
<p>especially in the oceans</p>
<p>like we have no idea even here what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on and</p>
<p>had we had that island</p>
<p>mentality then</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t be the expressions that we are now and i</p>
<p>think the same</p>
<p>thing applies</p>
<p>earth you know</p>
<p>the this island</p>
<p>earth concept you know why not</p>
<p>man i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>gonna be fucking flying through the galaxy</p>
<p>landed on new planets</p>
<p>just starting up a new</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>i mean think</p>
<p>about how much</p>
<p>of a variation in temperature we get on this planet</p>
<p>just a little bare</p>
<p>one between winter and summer</p>
<p>and i was in</p>
<p>winnipeg and</p>
<p>stand up up there</p>
<p>and whenever i&rsquo;m in canada i always ask</p>
<p>people like hey how cold does it get here in the winter</p>
<p>and the guy said fifty</p>
<p>fucking degrees</p>
<p>below zero right</p>
<p>fifty yeah like</p>
<p>just the idea that that can happen</p>
<p>on this planet and the same planet</p>
<p>where in la at seventy</p>
<p>what is it in january</p>
<p>seventy yeah what is it in february</p>
<p>seventy right it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>seventy go to hawaii eighty</p>
<p>what is it in</p>
<p>march eighty</p>
<p>right what&rsquo;s it in july</p>
<p>eighty sure</p>
<p>winnipeg minus</p>
<p>50 and people have been living there</p>
<p>for centuries</p>
<p>yeah i played in a theater</p>
<p>that was like a couple hundred that&rsquo;s what i mean</p>
<p>but go back to</p>
<p>human beings pre clothing</p>
<p>and the winter comes</p>
<p>wipes everybody the fuck out well they never</p>
<p>go there they</p>
<p>lived in africa</p>
<p>pre clothing</p>
<p>almost nobody ever really really was anywhere else</p>
<p>right well we</p>
<p>spread it and we</p>
<p>spread out a lot of people try and die</p>
<p>they never get outside of the box</p>
<p>we reached the</p>
<p>limit of our physical</p>
<p>experience what we</p>
<p>could actually</p>
<p>survive we got</p>
<p>and we made</p>
<p>clothing now we have these like</p>
<p>reflective astronaut</p>
<p>material that people can</p>
<p>walk around in almost</p>
<p>loose like jackets in almost that kind of weather and</p>
<p>be as warm as anybody wearing 16 animal pelts were</p>
<p>you know 300 years ago did you see that they</p>
<p>found a new</p>
<p>human evidence of the oldest</p>
<p>human being 140 000 years old i think</p>
<p>no no the one in israel is more than that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 400 000 year old</p>
<p>right homo sapien or yeah the</p>
<p>teeth yeah yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating shit man they really don&rsquo;t even know how</p>
<p>long we&rsquo;ve been around</p>
<p>the really the hard part</p>
<p>about it is when people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy to make a fossil</p>
<p>like things have to go</p>
<p>wrong to make a fossil you have to get caught in</p>
<p>a landslide totally like most of the time when you die</p>
<p>things eat you</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a wrap there&rsquo;s no bones left like</p>
<p>when we find dinosaurs or we find any fossilized</p>
<p>animals it&rsquo;s because they died in some unusual</p>
<p>big thing that</p>
<p>sealed them in</p>
<p>right when you think</p>
<p>about the mass of the earth</p>
<p>and all the areas of</p>
<p>levels and levels of</p>
<p>layers of dirt</p>
<p>and how many</p>
<p>things might be</p>
<p>under there that we&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>aware of exactly</p>
<p>probably a bunch of species that we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t discovered yet no question</p>
<p>including different</p>
<p>different animals different</p>
<p>hominids you know they</p>
<p>found that new type of</p>
<p>human being recently</p>
<p>they believed there were several different branches of</p>
<p>human brains</p>
<p>that interbred</p>
<p>but they were totally different species</p>
<p>yeah well they</p>
<p>got the concept of</p>
<p>modern man mating with neanderthals</p>
<p>and the interesting</p>
<p>thing was the male</p>
<p>modern humans</p>
<p>fucked neanderthal women</p>
<p>neanderthal men did not fuck</p>
<p>modern women wow</p>
<p>because it was a decision that it was like</p>
<p>literally guys will fuck</p>
<p>whoever and the</p>
<p>women are like no fucking way i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna let that asshole fuck me and that was that was</p>
<p>that was hilarious yeah that was</p>
<p>they just like</p>
<p>if you look at the dna strands</p>

<p>right well the interesting</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ve always said that time</p>
<p>travel is totally fucking possible if you just</p>
<p>drive the right direction</p>
<p>because literally</p>
<p>you can drive into new york city</p>
<p>and be in the future</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>and then you can</p>
<p>drive to west virginia in the mountains and be</p>
<p>150 years in the fucking past man or in a</p>
<p>totally different reality like i&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>said that the</p>
<p>apocalypse is here it just hasn&rsquo;t reached your door yet</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of spots in the</p>
<p>world really comes and</p>
<p>goes a little</p>
<p>flare in afghanistan tell me the</p>
<p>apocalypse isn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>right tell me it&rsquo;s not there</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a fucking soldier in afghanistan right now</p>
<p>tell me it&rsquo;s not there</p>
<p>tell me it&rsquo;s not there if you&rsquo;re in iraq</p>
<p>that place hasn&rsquo;t changed in</p>
<p>exactly a thousand years</p>
<p>still the apocalypse</p>
<p>if you had to live there</p>
<p>right now the</p>
<p>apocalypse could you imagine if</p>
<p>you were out in the</p>
<p>we were riding a goat through the fucking the mountains</p>
<p>armageddon apocalypse</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>apocalypse is when things</p>
<p>shall be revealed it</p>
<p>literally means</p>
<p>a vision really</p>
<p>i thought it was like the end no the</p>
<p>word it armageddons the end in</p>
<p>apocalypse armageddon</p>
<p>comes forward armageddon</p>
<p>which is a mountain in israel where</p>
<p>the israeli</p>
<p>soldiers will</p>
<p>stage the final battle to take back</p>
<p>the mosque that&rsquo;s there and rebuild the temple of the</p>
<p>mount hell sparks dropping knowledge bitches</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about all this i had no idea i always</p>
<p>equated armageddon and</p>
<p>apocalypse to be basically the same</p>
<p>thing just this nonsensical idea that one is</p>
<p>gonna end one&rsquo;s the happy ones the dark but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>which ones are dark they don&rsquo;t armageddon</p>
<p>armageddon is the battle that&rsquo;s the battle</p>
<p>which the apocalypse is when is</p>
<p>after the four horsemen ride and god reveals himself</p>
<p>or horseman do you know that unicorns are in the bible</p>
<p>really i know</p>
<p>king james bible unicorns wow</p>
<p>somebody put that on the rogan board today too</p>
<p>yeah what the fuck</p>
<p>man yeah for real well that&rsquo;s not weird what</p>
<p>compared to the rest of the weird shit that&rsquo;s in there</p>
<p>it is i agree but it&rsquo;s whenever this new</p>
<p>weird shit it&rsquo;s so contrast</p>
<p>dude regular reality giants fucking women you know</p>
<p>the nephilim and like seriously</p>
<p>angel wars like the</p>
<p>angel wars i mean</p>
<p>so i was talking</p>
<p>about that that stupid show that i watch all the time</p>
<p>ancient aliens</p>
<p>oh yeah where they&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>totally proposing all</p>
<p>these nutty concerts it&rsquo;s all from zachariah</p>
<p>sitchinsworth a lot of it yeah</p>
<p>yeah 12th planet and all that stuff</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s all fascinating stuff</p>
<p>27 and what is it a 2500 year elliptical</p>
<p>orbit of a planet that comes back into</p>
<p>range actually it&rsquo;s 3 000 3</p>
<p>500 years yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s come and it&rsquo;s close</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s within flying distance</p>
<p>right now the idea is</p>
<p>ridiculous i mean the idea that they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have spotted it</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>if something&rsquo;s gonna be here in</p>
<p>2012 believe me</p>
<p>folks the fucking</p>
<p>thing is gonna be</p>
<p>giant in the sky and headed our way a billion</p>
<p>miles an hour not happening something bigger than</p>
<p>earth are you kidding me</p>
<p>that close but</p>
<p>look we know for sure that</p>
<p>planets collide</p>
<p>we know galaxies collide we know that there was two</p>
<p>models of the</p>
<p>earth there&rsquo;s earth one and</p>
<p>earth two and</p>
<p>earth one didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a moon and we got hit by something</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not the</p>
<p>planet sized</p>
<p>right you know in this</p>
<p>chunk of us</p>
<p>spun in the sky and became the moon ocean</p>
<p>the ocean actually is the gap</p>
<p>where it used to be that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so gigantic</p>
<p>you ever heard the hollow moon theory</p>
<p>yeah the moon rings when</p>
<p>they land things on it yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>other reasons why they rang it like a bell</p>
<p>they bombed the surface for water</p>
<p>hmm was that you know was i guess</p>
<p>the idea that it&rsquo;s artificial</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>could you imagine if it was</p>
<p>you know if we</p>
<p>found out that it was a</p>
<p>goddamn satellite that they put there and just</p>
<p>cover it with dirt they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stupid they won&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>just watch us</p>
<p>totally we&rsquo;re a fucking ant farm</p>
<p>right now we&rsquo;re the biggest reality show ever</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we are</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the universe&rsquo;s reality</p>
<p>show fucking</p>
<p>every day where the</p>
<p>kardashians of the universe alien</p>
<p>sit down and lounges and</p>
<p>drink cappuccinos and laugh</p>
<p>their dicks off at us</p>
<p>dancing around on television</p>
<p>have you seen</p>
<p>family jewels that kiss</p>
<p>gene simmons i love</p>
<p>gene simmons and gene simmons came to my show so</p>
<p>i will not say anything bad</p>
<p>about it i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a i&rsquo;ve been a kiss fan since</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re five years old me too</p>
<p>all right so what now</p>
<p>this show is obviously fake</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really try</p>
<p>to hide it father</p>
<p>knows his father</p>
<p>knows his best</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>boy cheaper</p>
<p>production value yeah</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that buggy because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one of those</p>
<p>weird in between kind of shows that i</p>
<p>i keep on thinking that it&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>sold because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not real because what&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>is personality what i&rsquo;m really seeing is personality</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t give a shit if the circumstance is real</p>
<p>and most times circumstances are too fucking boring to</p>
<p>watch so setting something up ultimately</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between that and taking a comedian</p>
<p>who you watch on</p>
<p>stage who&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>funny either off the</p>
<p>cuff or in written material</p>
<p>and going let&rsquo;s create a fake family for him</p>
<p>based on the characters he created</p>
<p>and watch him</p>
<p>react to things that are already</p>
<p>set up it&rsquo;s even more embarrassing when you write a</p>
<p>script for it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no variable</p>
<p>at all i guess it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tricking yourself into</p>
<p>reminding yourself</p>
<p>to take it like that i</p>
<p>guess when i</p>
<p>watch it i just</p>
<p>boggles my mind like</p>
<p>i need to i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>those shows i find them boring i watched</p>
<p>married to rock the</p>
<p>other day i watched</p>
<p>celebrity rehab</p>
<p>which is fascinating to me because no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>famous right</p>
<p>i mean eric</p>
<p>roberts is the most</p>
<p>famous one nobody gets nobody gets rehab</p>
<p>everybody ends up</p>
<p>fucked up again</p>
<p>you know they maybe they</p>
<p>help him a little bit you know like i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>total anti dr drew guy a lot of people</p>
<p>say what he does is unethical that you&rsquo;re not supposed</p>
<p>to take people and put him in the public eye and</p>
<p>make them a part of a reality show</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through such a serious</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s their choice</p>
<p>yeah i understand that but</p>
<p>what people are saying is it&rsquo;s unethical because the</p>
<p>the the pressure of the cameras and the</p>
<p>weirdness of the</p>
<p>whole experience is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not and sit in the</p>
<p>wrong direction</p>
<p>yeah in the</p>
<p>wrong direction exactly i totally</p>
<p>agree and i&rsquo;m not a fan and</p>
<p>of drew no and</p>
<p>for a long time i was like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a bigger drug pusher than</p>
<p>a lot of the people that he does because on loveline</p>
<p>on and on and</p>
<p>on it was just what meds are you on have you</p>
<p>checked your dosage you need to get medicated</p>
<p>and it was just</p>
<p>pharmaceuticals and somehow that makes it okay</p>
<p>with a lot of the</p>
<p>pharmaceutical drugs been tested on fewer</p>
<p>humans than</p>
<p>illicit drugs</p>
<p>with less positive effects</p>
<p>so i mean like i said i don&rsquo;t do either i don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>pharmaceutical drugs either</p>
<p>i think what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to do when he&rsquo;s trying to get people on drugs</p>
<p>is he figures by the time they&rsquo;re calling his show</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>on the edge of suicide</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying to prevent them from</p>
<p>dying so what he&rsquo;s trying to do is get them</p>
<p>happy for a bit and then hopefully they can</p>
<p>make it but i</p>
<p>think a lot of them just sounded</p>
<p>you know grumpy or wanted to call in and exaggerate</p>
<p>their problems in</p>
<p>front of everybody and then you know and then his his</p>
<p>his end result is</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s keep this person</p>
<p>medicated or whatever where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s part of the</p>
<p>adhd revolution</p>
<p>and medicating</p>
<p>creativity out of people and</p>
<p>going everything that&rsquo;s different about you</p>
<p>instead of exploring it</p>
<p>you should hide from it and</p>
<p>cover it up and you know there&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>movement in that direction i&rsquo;m not a fan and i think</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it hides behind that to some degree</p>
<p>yeah i know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about but i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>also had friends that have had some severe</p>
<p>depression and were suicidal</p>
<p>and then got on some</p>
<p>stuff like zoloft or what have you</p>
<p>well butchern one dude got on and it</p>
<p>turned his life around because he all of a</p>
<p>sudden got happier and he</p>
<p>moved his life in a more</p>
<p>happy direction</p>
<p>and he got more positive</p>
<p>about what he</p>
<p>wanted to do with his life and his relationship and</p>
<p>then who got on it and it caught it</p>
<p>okay i understand</p>
<p>but and then</p>
<p>he weaned himself off</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>happy guy very</p>
<p>stable and he was</p>
<p>stuck in a bad cycle</p>
<p>and that does happen to some people</p>
<p>i can be effective</p>
<p>in getting you out of a bad</p>
<p>cycle i totally</p>
<p>agree i think there are people who</p>
<p>drink their way through a problem too and come out the</p>
<p>other side argue with the same result but nobody</p>
<p>would ever cop to the fact that it was</p>
<p>whiskey that got him through</p>
<p>but you know there&rsquo;s tons of country songs about that</p>
<p>that i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>the strength</p>
<p>of the depression but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the strength</p>
<p>of the human</p>
<p>spirit i think i</p>
<p>think a lot of ways</p>
<p>he found his way through it</p>
<p>other people though take those</p>
<p>exact same drugs and it</p>
<p>cranks up the suicidal reflex that they</p>
<p>never had and they end up killing themselves and i</p>
<p>think you know well it&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>touch and go i mean</p>
<p>you really mean that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why they go</p>
<p>like i have a friend who&rsquo;s on some stuff</p>
<p>right now and he was on some</p>
<p>one thing it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work and then they put him on some</p>
<p>other stuff</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you man he&rsquo;s a lot nicer</p>
<p>now that he&rsquo;s on it i like him</p>
<p>yeah i like him better now that he&rsquo;s on it</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s happier</p>
<p>now that he&rsquo;s on it he had some sort of</p>
<p>legitimate issue right</p>
<p>there was some</p>
<p>stuff that i have</p>
<p>i have problems with and one is that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exercise and he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t eat healthy</p>
<p>and if he did</p>
<p>those things first</p>
<p>it probably</p>
<p>would take care of a lot of it for me</p>
<p>dude i cannot</p>
<p>i cannot go without exercising</p>
<p>right i have real problems yeah</p>
<p>i am not the same person</p>
<p>my trigger is way</p>
<p>quicker i get</p>
<p>upset about</p>
<p>things that are nonsensical</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason for me to</p>
<p>even let them</p>
<p>into my head</p>
<p>and i will get into a murderous rage</p>
<p>about them chimpanzee</p>
<p>instincts that need to get out you know</p>
<p>with this old hardware</p>
<p>you gotta work this shit because it builds up</p>
<p>hormones and it</p>
<p>builds up all this</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>fight or flight shit is all inside</p>
<p>you have to express it somehow</p>
<p>our bodies are designed</p>
<p>for 30 years of fucking with willy mammoths you know</p>
<p>i mean we have to really wrap our heads around that</p>
<p>and instead we&rsquo;re sitting at laptops and</p>
<p>telling fuck you to your ex wife on facebook</p>
<p>which is not a real</p>
<p>expression of it</p>
<p>and it bottles it up even more as a matter of</p>
<p>fact you create</p>
<p>those hormones without the genuine</p>
<p>expression of how to get them out</p>
<p>i do forms every day i do</p>
<p>some form of martial arts</p>
<p>every single day</p>
<p>i do yoga when i get up in the morning</p>
<p>do really every day yeah and</p>
<p>for me it&rsquo;s that same</p>
<p>mentality i always</p>
<p>say i&rsquo;m gonna do that</p>
<p>then i wind up jerking off and go back to sleep</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you do kung fu</p>
<p>or somebody get</p>
<p>up take my yoga</p>
<p>class and just</p>
<p>beat off take a nap</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another way of unifying your soul with your body</p>
<p>and what yoga means that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what the word means</p>
<p>i agree with you that all martial</p>
<p>arts are really sort of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a is described</p>
<p>taekwondo as a moving meditation</p>
<p>so when you&rsquo;re totally into it when it&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like all the</p>
<p>aggression has been</p>
<p>drained out of you and you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>peace and you&rsquo;re so friendly and happy</p>
<p>and from the tips of your fingers to your toes</p>
<p>your brain is connected to all</p>
<p>those parts evenly</p>
<p>as opposed to</p>
<p>most of us walk around with a dead left arm</p>
<p>most of us walk around with a dead right foot</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re sitting around and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>your tension&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to where you need it i use my</p>
<p>right hand a lot i use that</p>
<p>and if you looked</p>
<p>at it just objectively if you ever just looked at</p>
<p>the arm you don&rsquo;t use that</p>
<p>often you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>think it was dead or palsied because you</p>
<p>your tension is</p>
<p>so gone in his arms</p>
<p>right now see</p>
<p>what i mean</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s fascinating to me when i get guys that are</p>
<p>brand new that come into</p>
<p>martial arts class</p>
<p>when they come to</p>
<p>jiu jitsu and you see them trying to move</p>
<p>their body they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never really had to move</p>
<p>their body in any strange way</p>
<p>and here they are</p>
<p>30 looking for some new</p>
<p>hobby to exercise with so they take a jiu jitsu</p>
<p>class and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like robots man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they can&rsquo;t do it that</p>
<p>signal does not get to</p>
<p>their feet the same way</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so strange and</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it just as amazing</p>
<p>watching them get to the</p>
<p>point where they can</p>
<p>yeah it doesn&rsquo;t take as long as</p>
<p>you think but it is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like oh</p>
<p>your brain is</p>
<p>now attached to that part of your body in a way it</p>
<p>never was like</p>
<p>half of you was on autopilot</p>
<p>for most of your life i&rsquo;ve seen dudes go from being</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the beautiful</p>
<p>things about</p>
<p>jiu jitsu is that a lot of the people that practice</p>
<p>jiu jitsu are very</p>
<p>smart people</p>
<p>think of jiu</p>
<p>jitsu and they</p>
<p>think of wrestling and</p>
<p>think of really</p>
<p>strong early</p>
<p>meathead type men</p>
<p>but most of the guys who</p>
<p>jiu jitsu are like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like computer nerds</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like really</p>
<p>smart people who figured out what a crazy</p>
<p>thing this is</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s all really</p>
<p>about leverage and position and technique</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>understand the</p>
<p>variables of the</p>
<p>human body and the</p>
<p>human body&rsquo;s moving in a certain direction you</p>
<p>counter that movement and</p>
<p>apply your own pressure</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s really like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really like this incredibly complex</p>
<p>game of how to</p>
<p>submit a body</p>
<p>how to stop a body</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how</p>
<p>much intelligence is behind something like that</p>
<p>everyone would benefit</p>
<p>every single person out there</p>
<p>would benefit</p>
<p>from some sort of a martial i</p>
<p>agree i agree i think</p>
<p>first of all i</p>
<p>think tai chi</p>
<p>should be taught in</p>
<p>schools like either yang</p>
<p>style or something</p>
<p>as a way of centering yourself before</p>
<p>classes began</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a big fan</p>
<p>do that in business and in</p>
<p>schools because</p>
<p>your brain your body are not fidgeting separately</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in line</p>
<p>what do they do in</p>
<p>school do they like have a</p>
<p>tai chi half hour or something they</p>
<p>kind of do like a morning</p>
<p>calisthenics</p>
<p>thing but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>largely tai chi</p>
<p>movement that</p>
<p>would be such a good move for schools</p>
<p>if schools had some</p>
<p>happy moment</p>
<p>where everybody met in like an auditorium</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>first thing everybody did yep was say they were</p>
<p>thankful to be there and then go through some</p>
<p>some fucking</p>
<p>thing you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically what they do in</p>
<p>china which is why they&rsquo;re eating our lunch</p>
<p>but also because they&rsquo;re willing to work for rice</p>
<p>okay they want to work and live in fucking dorms</p>
<p>that was that</p>
<p>place that everyone&rsquo;s jumping off the roof</p>
<p>brian foxton</p>
<p>yeah foxton</p>
<p>apparently though the</p>
<p>percentage of people that commit suicide in that place</p>
<p>is a smaller relatively</p>
<p>to the percentage of people that commit suicide overall</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that this corporation is so huge</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got a half a million workers yeah</p>
<p>wrap your head around that</p>
<p>right wrap your head around a half</p>
<p>how you shown</p>
<p>up how do you govern</p>
<p>12 billion people</p>
<p>in one place god damn</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>cut off the internet that&rsquo;s what you have to do</p>
<p>right cut off then you start</p>
<p>right then you</p>
<p>start looking at</p>
<p>their decisions</p>
<p>going i&rsquo;m kind of with you</p>
<p>cut off the</p>
<p>internet and and and make them scared of fire gods</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>gotta nobody</p>
<p>scared of fire gods</p>
<p>fucking aliens they&rsquo;re flying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re flying around around i i</p>
<p>i i spent a</p>
<p>decent amount</p>
<p>of time in china and in taiwan</p>
<p>really they</p>
<p>speak chinese</p>
<p>and so i how did you</p>
<p>learn chinese</p>
<p>my kung fu instructor</p>
<p>is from beijing</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s older so out of respect for him i started</p>
<p>learning get</p>
<p>out of here and</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s sweet</p>
<p>what kind of chinese</p>
<p>mandarin do you</p>
<p>write it or doi</p>
<p>yeah a decent amount wow i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like a six year old kid i can talk really</p>
<p>well say something really cool in chinese like say</p>
<p>you are listening to the joe rogan</p>
<p>experience with joe rogan and</p>
<p>brian redband</p>
<p>can you say that in chinese yeah ni&rsquo;sienza i tinged the</p>
<p>joe rogan experience</p>
<p>i guess with joe rogan and brian</p>
<p>yeah wow yeah i mean it&rsquo;s it you have a new commercial</p>
<p>brand yeah totally</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m looking forward to how long did it take to</p>
<p>learn chinese on the back</p>
<p>i well i mean i&rsquo;m constantly</p>
<p>evolving and</p>
<p>learning more but</p>
<p>about two years before i</p>
<p>was able to hold down a conversation did you go rosetta</p>
<p>stone or did you take classes no</p>
<p>books and cds mostly</p>
<p>and then does rosetta</p>
<p>stone work that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great the new one is awesome</p>
<p>i bought rosetta</p>
<p>stone when i</p>
<p>first started</p>
<p>learning it was the original</p>
<p>like american governmental</p>
<p>system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where rosetta</p>
<p>stone come from it&rsquo;s the old</p>
<p>governmental</p>
<p>ambassador ship</p>
<p>they started developing</p>
<p>what do you mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it comes from</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the origins</p>
<p>of the program it&rsquo;s kind of like a</p>
<p>department of defense kind of thing</p>
<p>where we get</p>
<p>technology from</p>
<p>there so they just figured out the best way to</p>
<p>teach a land</p>
<p>quickly to ambassador</p>
<p>ships and to and for businessmen</p>
<p>and it was all aimed at that and so all like</p>
<p>every early chinese book like when i was</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>learn chinese in the late 90s</p>
<p>all of them were</p>
<p>i work for the american silk company</p>
<p>i am trying</p>
<p>to buy this</p>
<p>where is the restaurant</p>
<p>what time do you get off work</p>
<p>would you like to come back to my hotel room</p>
<p>all of it is trying to fuck the</p>
<p>locals or fuck the locals</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true and now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much better now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s smoothed down people are</p>
<p>learning because they want to learn</p>
<p>and most people</p>
<p>think chinese is hard because they have to</p>
<p>learn it for business i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>transferred over there</p>
<p>so fuck this is awful</p>
<p>but if you love anything it comes that much</p>
<p>quicker so yeah</p>
<p>so if you was just fascinated yeah</p>
<p>did you ever do</p>
<p>stand up in chinese</p>
<p>um i oh i can i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing the goal is i&rsquo;m working on doing a special there</p>
<p>holy shit later this year</p>
<p>later in chinese</p>
<p>stand up august</p>
<p>first of all they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna kill you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna die they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna shoot you</p>
<p>whenever you would tank</p>
<p>right no that&rsquo;s what i hear they like me</p>
<p>but i hear the government probably would</p>
<p>you know no i mean</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t better not talk</p>
<p>about some controversial shit i</p>
<p>guess i mean chinese</p>
<p>stand up you better keep it clean son</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>have you been there have you been to china no</p>
<p>never been to</p>
<p>china it&rsquo;s never been to any</p>
<p>asian country really no wow</p>
<p>i know i need to</p>
<p>i wanted to go to</p>
<p>tokyo this year for the</p>
<p>k1 grand prix</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>traveling too much sure couldn&rsquo;t do it i was</p>
<p>just go to taiwan</p>
<p>which i think was</p>
<p>working the same way</p>
<p>taiwan is like</p>
<p>the amsterdam of china and</p>
<p>you know like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very open society it&rsquo;s very chinese and culturally</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>democracy and like</p>
<p>their rules are as loose as</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually more open than the united</p>
<p>states really</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s and they&rsquo;re technologically</p>
<p>super advanced they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know taiwan</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;ve bullet</p>
<p>trains and wi fi</p>
<p>cities and shit like that</p>
<p>taiwan has a lot they play pool</p>
<p>i have an addiction to pool</p>
<p>yeah bad and in</p>
<p>taiwan pool is huge it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a national sport</p>
<p>i guess so they pay</p>
<p>people to play for the</p>
<p>taiwanese national team it&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>place i&rsquo;ve been there a</p>
<p>bunch of times and i&rsquo;m a huge fan</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>precursor to</p>
<p>going to china</p>
<p>when you go there</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t as</p>
<p>under the veil as they act and that</p>
<p>the communist regime in</p>
<p>china is holding on like</p>
<p>white knuckle</p>
<p>to this bull of</p>
<p>well of just freedom freedom</p>
<p>of all sorts like they can&rsquo;t wrap</p>
<p>their head around</p>
<p>all they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing it pretty well</p>
<p>is just trying to keep everybody from fracturing and</p>
<p>exploding are they</p>
<p>still locking people up</p>
<p>blocking dissidents</p>
<p>up yeah but a lot of the dissidents they do like</p>
<p>the fallen dafa</p>
<p>and that kind of</p>
<p>stuff there</p>
<p>half of us here</p>
<p>would go i kind of sure</p>
<p>should the point you</p>
<p>guys the guy douchey</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re locking up douchey guys</p>
<p>sometimes they&rsquo;re you know</p>
<p>about the guy and i ran</p>
<p>their dissident is our unabomber</p>
<p>to some degree</p>
<p>some guy writes a</p>
<p>bunch of papers and blow some</p>
<p>places up and</p>
<p>we lock them up and you know that kind of idea like</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>connection to</p>
<p>their society now i&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not letting</p>
<p>them off the hook at all they totally do act</p>
<p>in a horribly authoritative way</p>
<p>but you get it once you</p>
<p>spend time over there why</p>
<p>and then the you know and you&rsquo;ve got what do you get</p>
<p>they just have to</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s too many people</p>
<p>yeah on occasion they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna get to a certain</p>
<p>amount of people you can&rsquo;t really govern that many no</p>
<p>exactly that&rsquo;s what i mean when there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>point two billion people in your country</p>
<p>i you kind of get it i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>supposed to be like</p>
<p>fifty thousand</p>
<p>that the matter you</p>
<p>can only i think</p>
<p>you can only maintain 14 000 in your consciousness</p>
<p>of human beings over the course of your lifetime</p>
<p>14 that way i know you can only keep</p>
<p>150 names yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thing called</p>
<p>dunbar&rsquo;s number it&rsquo;s 150</p>
<p>yeah although there are people who have a higher number</p>
<p>than others that&rsquo;s an average yeah</p>
<p>hard drives pro</p>
<p>we have bullshit</p>
<p>iphone ones some people have</p>
<p>bigger and better</p>
<p>ones and interestingly enough and you deal with this</p>
<p>we gonna say oh i was just</p>
<p>gonna say yeah</p>
<p>like speak in</p>
<p>spell or what</p>
<p>simon says remember it was</p>
<p>like red blue</p>
<p>like if you do it like you have this one number and</p>
<p>every time it</p>
<p>hits that number it just turns off for me at</p>
<p>least and like you can&rsquo;t go past it yeah you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go past that</p>
<p>number capacity</p>
<p>hard drive space interestingly enough like</p>
<p>people i think was jack</p>
<p>nicholson who said</p>
<p>he was reading on statistics and he was saying</p>
<p>the average</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>in modern society</p>
<p>and western society meets over the course of</p>
<p>their whole life</p>
<p>9 000 people</p>
<p>from deep connections to</p>
<p>how are you oh hi i&rsquo;m tim end of conversation</p>
<p>to waving at a bus</p>
<p>guide 9 000 people your whole life</p>
<p>the average even moderate society tv</p>
<p>like social celebrity</p>
<p>like a tv weatherman</p>
<p>can meet up to sixteen thousand people a year</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a national celebrity of any level</p>
<p>you can meet</p>
<p>thirty six thousand people a year</p>
<p>and half of</p>
<p>those people you actually connect with you spend</p>
<p>legit time with them and you know this</p>
<p>you stand after a show if you do meet and</p>
<p>greets or if you meet fans beforehand or whatever</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>more of a conversation with them sometimes in that</p>
<p>30 seconds to two minutes</p>
<p>than they&rsquo;ve had with anybody in</p>
<p>their circle in a while</p>
<p>right you know it&rsquo;s like that guy in judicial</p>
<p>class who hasn&rsquo;t used his feet in a long time they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t used</p>
<p>their conversational</p>
<p>skills with a stranger</p>
<p>and expressed themselves</p>
<p>in any deep way to somebody that they&rsquo;re impressed by</p>
<p>in ever and so you actually have a deeper</p>
<p>connection with and</p>
<p>spend more time with and are connected to more</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>than anybody in the history of the planet</p>
<p>has ever had like from</p>
<p>mayan priests to pharaohs</p>
<p>they never came in contact with as many people</p>
<p>and had direct contact with them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re freaking me out man then just an average</p>
<p>then you do</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve always wondered that</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>run into so many people that i can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so unfortunate so</p>
<p>frustrating and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that i wanted not a person not a person not</p>
<p>like man i&rsquo;m just more important than you bro i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember you it&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t have the room there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>room in my brain</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have any room yeah</p>
<p>and i can&rsquo;t maintain</p>
<p>where you are at all times like a</p>
<p>tracking device in my</p>
<p>and eventually you&rsquo;ll come back if you hang out for a</p>
<p>second yeah you&rsquo;ll come back we&rsquo;ll be there yeah</p>
<p>and is it your name that&rsquo;s important or that we connect</p>
<p>you can get a lot of people as</p>
<p>their name you don&rsquo;t even know my name bro</p>

<p>eddie bravo gotten a</p>
<p>thing with this dude</p>

<p>the idea of the pursuit of alcohol</p>
<p>going out and getting</p>
<p>drunk and the pursuit</p>
<p>of sex at the same time getting to know people and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know anybody when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drunk you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know them they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know you who the fuck is anybody what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>pussy get in there right</p>
<p>and then what</p>
<p>like done and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the amazing</p>
<p>thing is it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>you can make a person that way</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason</p>
<p>why your dick is supposed to be soft when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drunk when you can&rsquo;t get it up because you&rsquo;re drunk</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>every that doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>on your body</p>
<p>that law does not work on me when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>drunk i am harder</p>
<p>than i&rsquo;ve ever been in my life it&rsquo;s like opposite for</p>
<p>that every one time</p>
<p>somebody says i&rsquo;m like what that&rsquo;s not a real thing</p>
<p>you know why</p>
<p>because you have retard genes</p>
<p>and your your retard genes they want to</p>
<p>be want to propagate in the worst</p>
<p>situation possible</p>
<p>like how drunk is he he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>drunk how big of a mistake is he making</p>
<p>a really big mistake okay</p>
<p>i want every</p>
<p>sperm in the hatch</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going in</p>
<p>look at her</p>
<p>yeah this kid will be dumb</p>
<p>and ugly yeah she</p>
<p>stinks her feet stink</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in an alley</p>
<p>this shit even be happened</p>
<p>let him think he&rsquo;s got the condom on let him</p>
<p>think he put it on</p>
<p>person blump</p>
<p>take care of me teach me everything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re here to make</p>
<p>robots you&rsquo;re here to make garbage men</p>
<p>do you hear far from</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sweet that&rsquo;s probably right</p>
<p>probably real</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the spirit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>my body does not want me producing loads when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>drunk when i&rsquo;m if i&rsquo;m drunk i just</p>
<p>my dick does not wanna work</p>
<p>does not want and i listen to who you chose</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even who you choose your dick knows you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thinking straight</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s what i mean what are you doing</p>
<p>stupid where are you do you even know where you are</p>

<p>all because this dude</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>admit that a dude blew him</p>
<p>right he would have had one of the best stories</p>
<p>ever ever right if you&rsquo;re at parties and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking mike tell us</p>
<p>about that fucking dude who blew you yeah okay give me</p>
<p>another beer yeah</p>
<p>right totally</p>
<p>everybody sit down</p>
<p>all right this is how</p>
<p>horny i was</p>
<p>totally and you know it&rsquo;d be halfway to the</p>
<p>story and i was kind of like god is this a dude</p>
<p>right yeah fuck i don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>should i come i&rsquo;m like i</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>too late fuck</p>
<p>right and then i realized it was a</p>
<p>i mean come on man it</p>
<p>would be a fantastic story dude</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that guy died</p>
<p>over something that when you go to</p>
<p>phuket thailand</p>
<p>they print t shirts</p>
<p>that have a soldier</p>
<p>making out with a</p>
<p>chick going and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s looking down and she&rsquo;s looking down</p>
<p>and over his head there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a thought bubble that says uh oh</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got a huge boner and so does she</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the joke it&rsquo;s so consistent</p>
<p>they print t</p>
<p>shirts about it</p>
<p>and what happens in thailand did dudes just get</p>
<p>drunk and say fuck it i&rsquo;ll let this</p>
<p>guy blow me</p>
<p>yeah the kitois there</p>
<p>which are the lady boys who look so much like women</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t see it coming no pun intended</p>
<p>that they did it just becomes</p>
<p>these guys get</p>
<p>drunk and then they just pounce on you</p>
<p>because the real</p>
<p>women work in the in the</p>
<p>bars and guys go in and you go i want number 52</p>
<p>and you pay to take her out of the bar</p>
<p>and you take her someplace and fuck her</p>
<p>damn so how many what percentage of</p>
<p>women and prostitutes in thailand</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that much bigger</p>
<p>than any other country i just think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a section from there</p>
<p>yeah they were</p>
<p>never conquered by</p>
<p>the british or the french so they don&rsquo;t have the same</p>
<p>sexual mores that we have so they&rsquo;re not as hung up</p>
<p>about it in that regard so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not you</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely a</p>
<p>dark side to it no question but it&rsquo;s different than we</p>
<p>experience it over here like with our sex</p>
<p>trade and our kind of</p>
<p>bottom feeder</p>
<p>mentality with it but the</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>thing is that</p>
<p>the ones that are in the bars you see a hot</p>
<p>chick in a bar</p>
<p>just hanging out</p>
<p>on in these like outdoor</p>
<p>kind of you know</p>
<p>jimmy buffety</p>
<p>looking bars</p>
<p>where people are buying margaritas getting fucked up</p>
<p>watching kickboxing then</p>
<p>these are all</p>
<p>these girls are all dudes</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>and guys pick them up and there that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super confusing</p>
<p>everything else</p>
<p>sounds awesome</p>
<p>about thailand</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m like margaritas kickboxing outside</p>
<p>great weather awesome</p>
<p>i need to go yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty awesome</p>
<p>guys blowing you hmm</p>
<p>well i mean as long as you keep your wits</p>
<p>about you you have a</p>
<p>buddy who keeps his wits</p>
<p>about him you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be fine what parts of thailand have you been to</p>
<p>bangkok and phuket</p>
<p>i want to go to phuket</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a place that you can train at</p>
<p>tiger muay thai</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah bling it</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>apparently there&rsquo;s a nice resort that&rsquo;s really close by</p>
<p>i thought about</p>
<p>going there for a few days it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great what does phuket like it&rsquo;s a it</p>
<p>reminds me of hawaii it&rsquo;s like a hawaii</p>
<p>beach community</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like very</p>
<p>modern very</p>
<p>no but touristy</p>
<p>yeah that section of it is it safe</p>
<p>for kids and shit</p>
<p>would you bring little kids over there yes in</p>
<p>that resort</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna stay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>place i stayed</p>
<p>that um yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>total like community it&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>um yeah there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>worries i wouldn&rsquo;t take them to cambodia</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;d get</p>
<p>eaten right</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s just that the kids in cambodia</p>
<p>no they do not it but in between</p>
<p>just for the record but in</p>
<p>be sure in betweens people</p>
<p>cambodians you know you look on a map</p>
<p>and you see a border</p>
<p>and it looks really fucking clean</p>
<p>you go okay this is</p>
<p>where this country ends this is</p>
<p>where this country</p>
<p>begins okay you get to the edge of thailand cambodia</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the case blurry</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very blurry for like 15</p>
<p>miles so cambodia</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re dangerous</p>
<p>there no cambodia</p>
<p>is nice thailand&rsquo;s nice</p>
<p>in between the two of them</p>
<p>the gray area yeah there are</p>
<p>these cities</p>
<p>that yeah have no law</p>
<p>governing them either way</p>
<p>wow and they&rsquo;re really fucked up</p>
<p>and if you walk through there with a backpack on your</p>
<p>real you can fucking feel it man it&rsquo;s like a tarantino</p>
<p>movie waiting to happen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>this is fucked</p>
<p>up and hikers go through there all the time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>american werewolf in london like just</p>
<p>stay on the path and keep walking you&rsquo;ll be in</p>
<p>there buddy</p>
<p>yeah don&rsquo;t go into the</p>
<p>saloons don&rsquo;t do any of that shit just</p>
<p>stay on the fucking road</p>
<p>god damn that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary fuck that i wrote</p>
<p>about that once i wrote</p>
<p>i had an idea that i</p>
<p>wrote about a gray area in between</p>
<p>states yeah</p>
<p>that it would be like</p>
<p>a las vegas extreme</p>
<p>in every state because our</p>
<p>states are all governed by</p>
<p>their own separate rules and</p>
<p>you know remember</p>
<p>in utah used to be that you had to buy</p>
<p>alcohol in one section and mixers in another section</p>
<p>you had to show your id when you bought them</p>
<p>even in bars it was like really tricky</p>
<p>but you go to</p>
<p>vegas you could buy you know jack daniel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shots at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>out of a slurping</p>
<p>dispenser on the</p>
<p>street i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>so almost like an extreme version of that in between</p>
<p>every state</p>
<p>where there was a mile long area</p>
<p>where it was a gray area</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>governed by very simple laws like no murder no theft no</p>
<p>does it but</p>
<p>everything else do whatever the fuck you</p>
<p>gotta do to help live in one of</p>
<p>those towns</p>
<p>well he sort</p>
<p>of does but he lives in a kind of a boring place man</p>
<p>he lives in</p>
<p>bisbee it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he always complains that it&rsquo;s like an artist community</p>
<p>but no one&rsquo;s got a fucking</p>
<p>sense of humor</p>
<p>know and stanhope is a</p>
<p>savage drunk yes</p>
<p>a psychopath</p>
<p>right you know i&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>laughing about</p>
<p>a bunch of shit that</p>
<p>these don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>bead wearing douchebag hippies</p>
<p>are staring at</p>
<p>but i think yeah</p>
<p>but i think near him like</p>
<p>south him that&rsquo;s where it</p>
<p>starts to get a little</p>
<p>are we in a state</p>
<p>still he&rsquo;s seven</p>
<p>miles away from the mexican border yeah</p>
<p>that dude who got his head cut off like</p>
<p>he and his girlfriend went out into the</p>
<p>river or whatever or</p>
<p>out into the lake</p>
<p>and they crossed the part of the lake that&rsquo;s mexico</p>
<p>and they fucking got attacked and they cut his</p>
<p>head off and mailed it back to them or whatever like</p>
<p>fuck man mmm</p>
<p>yeah but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re better with borders than almost anybody in the</p>
<p>world we fucking know man we have a real issue</p>
<p>you know and the</p>
<p>issue is not afghanistan it&rsquo;s not iraq the</p>
<p>issue is we are connected to a third</p>
<p>world country</p>
<p>in the middle of one of the biggest drug wars this</p>
<p>world has ever</p>
<p>known dude people don&rsquo;t even realize how</p>
<p>big the fucking situation is and how it&rsquo;s fucked it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy yeah the amount of people</p>
<p>that have died just this year i mean it&rsquo;s staggering</p>
<p>with tens of thousands of</p>
<p>people dying</p>
<p>over there the only</p>
<p>growth industry</p>
<p>in mexico is kidnapping</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>scary stuff man and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why i didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to move to san diego</p>
<p>college courses</p>
<p>well those little kids that are getting caught that are</p>
<p>you know on cell</p>
<p>phones they have</p>
<p>their cell phones showing torture</p>
<p>on these little kids that are</p>
<p>murderers for the drug cartels 12 years old murderers</p>
<p>cutting people up and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s our own</p>
<p>sierra leone</p>
<p>i mean ultimately this is</p>
<p>stuff that happens</p>
<p>everywhere by the way</p>
<p>not too different from</p>
<p>early european</p>
<p>stuff we just</p>
<p>you know think of ourselves as past it now</p>
<p>well the problem the real true</p>
<p>issue with mexico is that there&rsquo;s no natural</p>
<p>gas there and there&rsquo;s no oil there there&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>natural resources</p>
<p>to warrant us taking</p>
<p>troops over there and</p>
<p>you know stabilizing the area</p>
<p>i mean nobody wants to</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>admit nobody wants</p>
<p>to say that yeah nobody wants to say</p>
<p>about drug yeah well by the way the drug</p>
<p>money we&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>money from those drugs totally</p>
<p>guaranteed 100</p>
<p>without that</p>
<p>500 million</p>
<p>the economy</p>
<p>would have collapsed</p>
<p>even further</p>
<p>than it went this how frustrating it</p>
<p>is because you&rsquo;re a rational person how frustrating</p>
<p>is it when you talk to regular people</p>
<p>you know your average person you have a cocktail</p>
<p>party or whatever and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sitting down with some guy who&rsquo;s an architect</p>
<p>and you get into the conversation of</p>
<p>where drugs come from</p>
<p>and people are so fucking naive and when you tell them</p>
<p>that you know there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence that the cia</p>
<p>brings drugs in this country</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll look at you like you are some</p>
<p>fucking nut</p>
<p>and you could tell them about</p>
<p>all these different cases</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s been proven true you can show</p>
<p>reference you know michael rupert books and</p>
<p>you can reference</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>whole the case with</p>
<p>barry seals and me in arkansas</p>
<p>and all that shit that went down</p>
<p>about the cia plane that</p>
<p>crashed recently they had been at guantanamo bay on at</p>
<p>least two separate occasions</p>
<p>crashed in mexico with four</p>
<p>tons of cocaine inside of it</p>
<p>like what the fuck</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another form of currency that they use</p>
<p>its off the books</p>
<p>currency essentially i mean they have to run</p>
<p>their own money laundering</p>
<p>because the shit they&rsquo;re doing is so far down the</p>
<p>rabbit hole</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t actually take the cash itself</p>
<p>the cash itself is too much of a marker</p>
<p>the numbers on it would</p>
<p>trace back to the government too much so they</p>
<p>literally have</p>
<p>it would be better to</p>
<p>sell it for drugs like get drugs and change that money</p>
<p>using drugs and then resell that drug</p>
<p>for another currency</p>
<p>to hide what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on better</p>
<p>that the american people thought</p>
<p>our tax dollars were buying</p>
<p>cocaine than what we&rsquo;re actually doing with it hmm</p>
<p>yeah well i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>they know that that&rsquo;s a way to make</p>
<p>money and they know that it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>exist forever and you know</p>
<p>why not just</p>
<p>people need absolutely</p>
<p>they find a way to justify that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna use it for you know the</p>
<p>the sand in</p>
<p>east is and the cons yeah you</p>
<p>know during</p>
<p>that extreme that was when they were accused of selling</p>
<p>crack in the ghettos yeah</p>
<p>and using that</p>
<p>money to fund foreign wars i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>ridiculous but what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>crazy is when</p>
<p>you have a conversation with someone and you</p>
<p>bring that up</p>
<p>if you have a conversation with like you know</p>
<p>just some normal person in your neighborhood</p>
<p>right somehow know that subject comes up</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re alone now</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>looney dude</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re that</p>
<p>crazy guy who believes that cia</p>
<p>is selling drugs</p>
<p>right but at a certain</p>
<p>point i i think ultimately</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had a lot of conversations</p>
<p>where more and more people are like well yeah i mean</p>
<p>that happened in the</p>
<p>eighties or that happens on occasion or</p>
<p>you know guys go</p>
<p>rogue and do</p>
<p>stuff and blah blah blah but that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s not the norm</p>
<p>or whatever and like no this is pretty much the</p>
<p>price of doing business and you know</p>
<p>and when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>literally competing with other</p>
<p>giant governments who are doing exactly the same</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;re not getting a real accurate</p>
<p>sense of the landscape</p>
<p>kids aren&rsquo;t being forced to read</p>
<p>confessions of an economic hitman</p>
<p>in high school</p>
<p>they should be you</p>
<p>should be forced to</p>
<p>watch a bunch of different documentaries</p>
<p>on what we do with</p>
<p>money in other</p>
<p>countries and how we</p>
<p>get their resources and how we</p>
<p>give them loans that can</p>
<p>ever possibly pay back the</p>
<p>whole idea is that we&rsquo;re trying to help them but really</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re trying to do is get them attached to debt</p>
<p>and once we get them to dent your</p>
<p>servitude yeah</p>
<p>but the pharaohs did</p>
<p>ultimately you know</p>
<p>that was the difference between the slavery</p>
<p>during the pharaohs time was the idea that you would</p>
<p>intentionally</p>
<p>indenture yourself for a time</p>
<p>and then over that time like</p>
<p>this illusion of the</p>
<p>second you know like how the sex trade runs</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give you 20 000 we&rsquo;ll get you the</p>
<p>states and you work it off with your vagina</p>
<p>and then eventually you&rsquo;ll be free but then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never free yeah they</p>
<p>keep moving the goal post</p>
<p>sure the pharaohs</p>
<p>did that that&rsquo;s why everybody got pissed and split</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s how they do</p>
<p>it in the middle east when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>giant buildings in dubai</p>
<p>and bring these</p>
<p>poor fucks in from</p>
<p>india and these</p>
<p>third world chinese</p>
<p>when when i was in beijing they</p>
<p>were they were ripping up the</p>
<p>hutongs in preparation</p>
<p>which are these</p>
<p>essentially</p>
<p>these like mud walled ghettos in the center of</p>
<p>the city right in</p>
<p>front of the forbidden city and</p>
<p>what used to be the</p>
<p>emperor&rsquo;s garden</p>
<p>are these like</p>
<p>low walled houses with nine families using one</p>
<p>hole as a toilet and the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>it would be like as if</p>
<p>central park was was a tent city</p>
<p>imagine that</p>
<p>and then eventually that tent city turned into</p>
<p>you know literally just mud encrusted</p>
<p>bricks that</p>
<p>they made themselves and a hole that they shit in yeah</p>
<p>over in the middle of</p>
<p>their house yeah well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a drain</p>
<p>you know and it</p>
<p>drains out into the</p>
<p>street it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>awful so you just</p>
<p>hang your ass over the hole and just drop it in there</p>
<p>basically anybody fall in there</p>
<p>every now and then i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>what are they</p>
<p>drowning and shit</p>
<p>what was that</p>
<p>movie that recently came out that</p>
<p>the guy kid fell in it was like a kid</p>
<p>movie had to jump in there to hide no</p>
<p>what was that movie</p>
<p>you jumped in the toilet to hide</p>
<p>yeah kid movie only</p>
<p>all the indians</p>
<p>indian kids</p>
<p>slumdog millionaire i</p>
<p>never saw that</p>
<p>was that good i never saw that oh yeah</p>
<p>lady hawk actually that you know that</p>
<p>matthew broderick rector howard</p>
<p>movie with the alan parsons project</p>
<p>weird score</p>
<p>wow i never saw that either it&rsquo;s at you know 80s</p>
<p>movie but the</p>
<p>matthew brodrick</p>
<p>plays his character felipe the</p>
<p>mouse who&rsquo;s a contortionist and he&rsquo;s a thief</p>
<p>and he escapes</p>
<p>from the dungeons of aquila</p>
<p>which nobody has ever escaped for</p>
<p>by basically</p>
<p>cracking his</p>
<p>bones and sliding his way through oh wow it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>but through this sewer</p>
<p>i know there was a dude</p>
<p>named lee murray</p>
<p>that was a he&rsquo;s a bank heist</p>
<p>guy from england</p>
<p>who was trying to get out of his cage by</p>
<p>starving himself</p>
<p>so small that he</p>
<p>could slip through the bars</p>
<p>like he was</p>
<p>starving himself yeah to try to get</p>
<p>skinny enough to slip through</p>
<p>his cage well</p>
<p>and as you would do</p>
<p>after a while</p>
<p>yeah but that&rsquo;s retarded you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna do how don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think the bars are too</p>
<p>small for you to do that</p>
<p>well eventually what they do is they make sure you like</p>
<p>make sure your</p>
<p>skull and your hips can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>through yeah come on man you ain&rsquo;t getting through yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that</p>
<p>yeah desperate man</p>
<p>where were we</p>
<p>anyways yeah</p>
<p>that we really went like</p>
<p>sideways i blame the lady hawk</p>
<p>reference and that was</p>
<p>really totally weird</p>
<p>but in the hutongs</p>
<p>in china basically</p>
<p>to live in beijing</p>
<p>to live in the big city you had to</p>
<p>have a card</p>
<p>that says you live there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like as if new york said look</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too many fucking</p>
<p>people in new york yes everybody wants to live here</p>
<p>but since we don&rsquo;t charge</p>
<p>for rent anymore it&rsquo;s a communist society we got to</p>
<p>have a hierarchy of some sort you either have to have</p>
<p>lived here a</p>
<p>long time or you got to give something up to so</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t pay any rent at all no</p>
<p>well you can</p>
<p>outsiders do and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>system but essentially you can get a better</p>
<p>place by paying</p>
<p>but essentially your</p>
<p>basic level</p>
<p>stuff is there so what they</p>
<p>would do is</p>
<p>they would go</p>
<p>to these little towns which were</p>
<p>piece of shit towns that they were having the communist</p>
<p>party was having to maintain they have to run</p>
<p>water out to</p>
<p>these dipshit towns that have nothing to offer</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just out there and they had to provide</p>
<p>for them they go into the town they go all right</p>
<p>everybody out</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re taking all the wiring back and the</p>
<p>plumbing back and we&rsquo;re taking all the concrete and</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to pulverize this</p>
<p>whole city and this</p>
<p>whole town&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to live in a high rise in beijing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>build yourself</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re gonna give you the construction for two years</p>
<p>the best workers here are</p>
<p>gonna go into the city</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna work on this tower</p>
<p>and then by the time the</p>
<p>towers finished everybody moves into it and we&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>pulverize the whole city</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as if we went to fairfield</p>
<p>california or some small town</p>
<p>where the industry has left so what&rsquo;s the hook</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s there is none</p>
<p>other than you don&rsquo;t get to have your old town</p>
<p>in your nice little village</p>
<p>so they actually do build this</p>
<p>place and they actually do live in yep</p>
<p>okay okay so it&rsquo;s not the same as</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening no but no</p>
<p>but yeah no they actually pay off eventually but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the good version of it or whatever in dubai they just</p>
<p>in dubai it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>cause they stopped paying</p>
<p>and the fucking workers just</p>
<p>started walking home</p>
<p>they just all packed</p>
<p>their shit and</p>
<p>started walking to the edge of town that</p>
<p>whole place is so</p>
<p>crazy that they were</p>
<p>they were so yeah</p>
<p>yeah they were bawling</p>
<p>at such a high</p>
<p>level and then</p>
<p>it just kind of all came</p>
<p>crashing down well</p>
<p>based on it&rsquo;s a resource</p>
<p>based economy a</p>
<p>limited resource</p>
<p>based economy and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eventually that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to go</p>
<p>dry no matter if it&rsquo;s now or 50 years from now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re banking your whole</p>
<p>worth on oil</p>
<p>these fuckers are</p>
<p>going to be hocking rugs like they were in the 50s</p>
<p>sooner than they know it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be a creepy period</p>
<p>for them well they also have debtors</p>
<p>prison so you can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>in debt you can&rsquo;t just go bankrupt over there they</p>
<p>just lock you up in jail</p>
<p>right so a lot of people they parked</p>
<p>their mercedes</p>
<p>at the airport got on a flight and just left</p>
<p>everything behind totally</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wanna be in</p>
<p>jail fuck you and your country take care exactly a lot</p>
<p>of people were living there like</p>
<p>michael jackson was living there</p>
<p>i mean it got to be this you</p>
<p>know really the idea of this enchanted paradise place</p>
<p>where millionaires and just</p>
<p>sounds like nuts</p>
<p>it sounds like las</p>
<p>vegas run by</p>
<p>southern baptists</p>
<p>yeah the whole</p>
<p>thing is really fascinating</p>
<p>religious police like i got him called on me yeah</p>
<p>during my show</p>
<p>during your show yeah in dubai yeah</p>
<p>i was i was</p>
<p>i was doing a show with john lovett&rsquo;s</p>
<p>of all people</p>
<p>i guess and</p>
<p>he i was i did the</p>
<p>first 45 he did the</p>
<p>second 45 and i</p>
<p>introduced him in between show</p>
<p>that you know our shows and i come out in this and</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m up on</p>
<p>stage and i&rsquo;d gone up to the top of the burj</p>
<p>khalifa the</p>
<p>tower the tallest</p>
<p>building in the</p>
<p>world i&rsquo;ve now been in</p>
<p>four of the tallest</p>
<p>structures in the world</p>
<p>school whatever blah blah blah what&rsquo;s that feel like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty odd</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>it looks like it&rsquo;s the same view you get in</p>
<p>a landing airplane you know when you&rsquo;re flying into lax</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re over</p>
<p>what would be pasadena and all that shit and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re that high in the air that&rsquo;s what it looks like i</p>
<p>would just start shitting and pissing about</p>
<p>crazy i pass out</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all dirt it&rsquo;s terrible and</p>
<p>i even said like i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s great you guys built a</p>
<p>tower that high</p>
<p>dirt looks its best from</p>
<p>about 3 000 feet you know what i mean</p>
<p>dirt up close sucks but</p>
<p>all this dirt so</p>
<p>great to see</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>planted any</p>
<p>fucking trees it&rsquo;s all construction it looks like shit</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>like the biggest observation deck</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even face the</p>
<p>water the caspian</p>
<p>sea because they wanted to impress people with</p>
<p>what the city looks like so they put the observation</p>
<p>deck on the inside well the city hasn&rsquo;t been built yet</p>
<p>so bullshit anyway so i go up to the top of it</p>
<p>it was originally called the burj dubai</p>
<p>based on the city</p>
<p>the is she khalifa the</p>
<p>the president of the</p>
<p>uae gave them ten billion dollars to finish the</p>
<p>tower ten billion</p>
<p>dollars to finish it</p>
<p>cause it didn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna and so</p>
<p>on opening day</p>
<p>they decided you know what fuck this we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna name it burj</p>
<p>khalifa after him</p>
<p>like this impulse thing</p>
<p>but you go up in it i was one of the</p>
<p>first 200 people to go up in it you know and</p>
<p>and i go up in the gift shop all has shit that says</p>
<p>birds do buy on it and it&rsquo;s the same bullshit gift shop</p>
<p>crap you&rsquo;d find at the sears tower</p>
<p>or in disneyland</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking golf</p>
<p>shirts and and pocket</p>
<p>knives and bottle openers and they all have</p>
<p>birth you have little</p>
<p>paper weights</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>water in it and you can shake it</p>
<p>no comes on the little</p>
<p>towers no snake</p>
<p>sandstorm maybe one</p>
<p>right but they</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s stupid like</p>
<p>and but it all</p>
<p>still said birds dubai on it i&rsquo;m like this</p>
<p>motherfucker gives you ten billion dollars</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t replace the bullshit printed</p>
<p>t shirts in</p>
<p>twenty four hours</p>
<p>what you say this yes</p>
<p>so i basically what i said on stage was</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty rude to monsieur khalifa i think</p>
<p>that you you know that you did this or whatever</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m not paying for my</p>
<p>hotel room but when i call room service they say</p>
<p>they say yes mr</p>
<p>sparks they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t say the guy who was in the room before me</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>and i was actually trying</p>
<p>to say something differential respectful to the guy</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>well it was the fact that i said</p>
<p>monsieur khalifa</p>
<p>instead of shake khalifa</p>
<p>that drove this one guy</p>
<p>crazy and he</p>
<p>stood up in the back like</p>
<p>eight tables back and people were</p>
<p>laughing so i didn&rsquo;t see this happen</p>
<p>he was back in the dark he</p>
<p>said and he</p>
<p>storms out of the fucking place</p>
<p>whoa so i walk off</p>
<p>stage i finished my set it was a</p>
<p>great set actually i had a</p>
<p>great time and there was</p>
<p>these like 40 000</p>
<p>tables you know</p>
<p>every round</p>
<p>tables in the</p>
<p>front full of</p>
<p>shakes and these guys</p>
<p>and women in</p>
<p>their hijabs and burkas and the</p>
<p>whole deal and then</p>
<p>their business partners from the west so all you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s really weird</p>
<p>so i go off stage</p>
<p>and promoters there and he goes uh yeah uh</p>
<p>you said something</p>
<p>that offended one of the</p>
<p>shakes who was here and so he</p>
<p>called the cid</p>
<p>the religious police and they&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take you</p>
<p>into custody we&rsquo;ll try to yeah this is fucked up wow</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll try and mitigate it</p>
<p>as much as we can</p>
<p>but the fine</p>
<p>could be as much as 25 000</p>
<p>and three days in jail</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll try and talk them down and it</p>
<p>might not be a</p>
<p>big deal because we&rsquo;re not even sure what he was upset</p>
<p>about yet and we&rsquo;ll try to talk to them</p>
<p>but can you go out and</p>
<p>check this out</p>
<p>can you go out and introduce john</p>
<p>and then come back and we&rsquo;ll deal with it</p>
<p>so i walk out on stage</p>
<p>and i go up on</p>
<p>stage and i introduce john</p>
<p>and as i&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>stage introducing him i see them come down the</p>
<p>aisle i see the religious police</p>
<p>these there are</p>
<p>three of them</p>
<p>in these white</p>
<p>shirts with a little</p>
<p>belts across</p>
<p>their chest and little</p>
<p>stick holsters and</p>
<p>stuff and they&rsquo;re walking down the</p>
<p>aisle towards backstage</p>
<p>and they go backstage</p>
<p>and i introduce john and instead of going</p>
<p>backstage i walk straight off the</p>
<p>stage and walk</p>
<p>right out to the lobby</p>
<p>where they had a</p>
<p>table set up for me to sell shit and sign</p>
<p>things whereas</p>
<p>where i had intended to go in the</p>
<p>first place right</p>
<p>but i walked</p>
<p>i just instead of</p>
<p>going backstage i went straight out</p>
<p>front i&rsquo;m like they&rsquo;ll find me out there they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna find me they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna find me but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go out there and do that shit first</p>
<p>you had to sell your</p>
<p>merch yeah right</p>
<p>so i go outside</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m taking and a bunch of t</p>
<p>shirts and shit out there totally</p>
<p>and dvds and it took</p>
<p>pictures and blah blah</p>
<p>and i had a</p>
<p>bunch of people</p>
<p>come out because john is jewish i&rsquo;m not jewish and they</p>
<p>definitely have issues</p>
<p>with jews there so a lot of them came saw me and didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stick around to</p>
<p>watch the jew</p>
<p>right assholes</p>
<p>anyway so they come out</p>
<p>and these guys are back there for 10 fucking minutes</p>
<p>before they realize</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not coming back right</p>
<p>and so they turn around and come out to the office and</p>
<p>right when they walk out i&rsquo;m getting a</p>
<p>picture with a</p>
<p>shake and his wife</p>
<p>like this like you were in fucking wisconsin</p>
<p>arm around both of them big</p>
<p>stupid grin</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re smiling he&rsquo;s got his fucking</p>
<p>son classic sunglasses</p>
<p>white shawl the</p>
<p>whole deal is</p>
<p>white burka</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even see her fucking this is it</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m just a big</p>
<p>smiley picture i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming she&rsquo;s smiling and</p>
<p>um and they come out and they go</p>
<p>oh if he had said anything offensive</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>would be they</p>
<p>would not take a</p>
<p>picture with him this shaker here and his wife</p>
<p>would not be taking</p>
<p>pictures if he said anything were saying they&rsquo;d saw it</p>
<p>they watch so they</p>
<p>basically said</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t offend anybody because if he did they</p>
<p>would be mad too</p>
<p>and so they went to the</p>
<p>shake who was</p>
<p>standing by the doorway i didn&rsquo;t know who it was but</p>
<p>apparently he was</p>
<p>standing and they walked over with</p>
<p>their arms crossed what did he say what was it</p>
<p>and he goes</p>
<p>well it wasn&rsquo;t what he said</p>
<p>i just thought that</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>might get offended he</p>
<p>started backtracking on what he said oh</p>
<p>so they stuck around and</p>
<p>watch john show for</p>
<p>about ten minutes</p>
<p>to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t doing anything on toward and i</p>
<p>think they ended up finding him</p>
<p>twenty five thousand dollars</p>
<p>find john twenty</p>
<p>five thousand for mentioning</p>
<p>his judaism too much</p>
<p>what yeah fuck that</p>
<p>yeah don&rsquo;t ever go there here&rsquo;s the other yeah</p>
<p>dude oh my god</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so crazy</p>
<p>cause there</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t anything else i mean he does this</p>
<p>thing bob saget is gay the song he does which</p>
<p>might have been it</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re mentioning homosexuality is</p>
<p>worse than mentioning</p>
<p>judaism there i</p>
<p>think almost</p>
<p>they conflate the two but it&rsquo;s psychopath</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy behavior</p>
<p>imagine if fred phelps&rsquo;s family ran vegas</p>

<p>there&rsquo;s a different tone between that and dubai</p>
<p>i refuse to fly in</p>
<p>dubai for that reason i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to fly in there dude</p>
<p>and plus i knew</p>
<p>what they did with their</p>
<p>labor how they got</p>
<p>these people from</p>
<p>world countries they promised them an extreme amount of</p>
<p>money and then when they get there they take</p>
<p>their passports away and give them a fraction of</p>
<p>their money</p>
<p>right they live in squalor</p>
<p>conditions like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to be connected totally</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t want to feel that</p>
<p>yeah well at this</p>
<p>point it was already kind of on its</p>
<p>downward arc and i was just curious as shit to see like</p>
<p>where everything because it was</p>
<p>literally like cranes</p>
<p>it was something</p>
<p>stupid like</p>
<p>twenty two percent of the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s cranes</p>
<p>were in dubai</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>giant yeah those</p>
<p>cranes that they used to build the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s tallest building</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>stupid yeah</p>
<p>stupid yeah</p>
<p>and by the way</p>
<p>burj khalifa the tallest</p>
<p>building in the</p>
<p>world they decided they want the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s biggest mall as well</p>
<p>so they bailed it at the base</p>
<p>okay the base of the biggest</p>
<p>building has the biggest mall in the</p>
<p>world okay and</p>
<p>they decided to use bigger than the mall of america yes</p>
<p>they took by the way</p>
<p>the way they did it was we</p>
<p>need to get our</p>
<p>pride back people</p>
<p>they decided to take the design for the mall of america</p>
<p>and duplicate it</p>
<p>so they can</p>
<p>double it that&rsquo;s what they did</p>
<p>those cunts exactly</p>
<p>and you know what it is</p>
<p>the mall of america is</p>
<p>basically round</p>
<p>it is ovular</p>
<p>so there are these two</p>
<p>giant balls at the base of the burj</p>
<p>khalifa it is the biggest dumbest</p>
<p>phallus you have ever seen in your life</p>
<p>so fucking obvious see that&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>attractive thing you said all</p>
<p>night i want to go to that mall</p>
<p>right now right</p>
<p>by the way the</p>
<p>way you go into the top</p>
<p>is through the mall you</p>
<p>start in one</p>
<p>of the balls and you go through this writing</p>
<p>thing how is there food court</p>
<p>is it good it&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>is it good do they have cinnabon</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s just insane</p>
<p>no cinnabon</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>well i mean</p>
<p>they have they better have starbucks and cinnabon</p>
<p>yeah well i</p>
<p>guess yeah technically they do have starbucks</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know remember singing</p>
<p>but they had like</p>
<p>they had candied</p>
<p>dates with caramelized</p>
<p>almonds inside them</p>
<p>wrapped in like a leaf of vanilla</p>
<p>frosting or something</p>
<p>and box just rose and rose</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>fucking amazing i brought</p>
<p>boxes of them back to everybody that was the</p>
<p>thing middle east</p>
<p>is quite a trip man</p>
<p>one thing i wanted to get into</p>
<p>with you before we wrap this</p>
<p>thing up it&rsquo;s 35 30</p>
<p>jeez i&rsquo;ve read i&rsquo;ve seen a lot of shit one</p>
<p>thing that i saw that really brought my</p>
<p>attention to you</p>
<p>was you got interviewed at the airport about 9 11</p>
<p>right and it was</p>
<p>pretty fascinating because</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>groups of people usually that</p>
<p>you know when it comes to 9 11</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this people that say well you know</p>
<p>obviously you know</p>
<p>the government makes mistakes but you know this</p>
<p>was this was we were attacked by</p>
<p>you know some</p>
<p>some you know</p>
<p>terrorist organization there&rsquo;s a reason why we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>these places over</p>
<p>overseas and we&rsquo;re there to</p>
<p>make sure that we can have freedom here and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>group of people that think</p>
<p>hey something</p>
<p>happened here this is an inside job there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of people there&rsquo;s a lot of facts that don&rsquo;t jive</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of information that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t jive</p>
<p>but a lot of</p>
<p>those people are</p>
<p>crazy yes and a lot of those in</p>
<p>those you know 9 11</p>
<p>truthers like you listen</p>
<p>to them and there&rsquo;s you know you know the expression</p>
<p>the term confirmation bias</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re looking for information that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna confirm</p>
<p>your suspicions instead of</p>
<p>just be compulsive</p>
<p>religion is</p>
<p>based on that yeah</p>
<p>9 11 is the biggest</p>
<p>thing for that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a crazy</p>
<p>thing sure but one</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>to me proven</p>
<p>that even i don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>happened on 9 11 i don&rsquo;t know if there was government</p>
<p>complicity i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you know the</p>
<p>statements of</p>
<p>you know wolfsburg and rumsfeld</p>
<p>and dick cheney</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how many of</p>
<p>those are accurate and how many of those</p>
<p>we need a new</p>
<p>pearl harbor</p>
<p>and you know i don&rsquo;t know how much of that is real</p>
<p>but i do know that if they did do it</p>
<p>they could pull it off</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m paying attention to the way people are</p>
<p>reacting to some people that</p>
<p>refuse to think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that the government</p>
<p>would ever be involved in anything shady at all</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a giant group of</p>
<p>you know lover to</p>
<p>leave it there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>giant gods guns and government</p>
<p>right group in this country yeah</p>
<p>you could pull off almost</p>
<p>everything you can</p>
<p>count on it you can</p>
<p>literally bank on there</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re gonna read</p>
<p>stuff yes exactly the</p>
<p>sarah palin</p>
<p>book signing</p>
<p>people you know they&rsquo;re waiting in line you know you</p>
<p>could trick them with fucking</p>
<p>anything three card</p>
<p>money you know you can get and if you</p>
<p>scare them it&rsquo;s even better because that fear part of</p>
<p>their brain will trigger</p>
<p>and they will</p>
<p>everything will dovetail</p>
<p>bottleneck through that</p>
<p>and next thing you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking beer</p>
<p>watching fucking red dawn</p>
<p>screaming wolverine</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re ready yeah</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think happened on 9 11 what is your feeling i think</p>
<p>well i think</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a big believer in that you know</p>
<p>most of the time the official</p>
<p>story is horseshit</p>
<p>especially on big</p>
<p>scale things like that i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good combination of cya</p>
<p>an intentional</p>
<p>push that mixed at the</p>
<p>right time robert</p>
<p>anton wilson said</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a there are</p>
<p>groups that run the</p>
<p>world there&rsquo;s not more they&rsquo;re not just one</p>
<p>group that runs the whole</p>
<p>world there&rsquo;s several that are trying all the time</p>
<p>and they fuck</p>
<p>up like anybody else they have shit sons who do</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do their job</p>
<p>right and ruin the family fortune for a decade and</p>
<p>have to come back</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t believe in this perfect</p>
<p>world order</p>
<p>bohemian grove</p>
<p>bilderberg group</p>
<p>thing where they get</p>
<p>everything they</p>
<p>want there&rsquo;s nothing we can do and blah blah</p>
<p>you know they like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where i</p>
<p>bury from the alex</p>
<p>jones kind of</p>
<p>their perfect</p>
<p>monster it doesn&rsquo;t work that way everybody is</p>
<p>and i think a lot of times</p>
<p>they do know</p>
<p>the rice dog fire and</p>
<p>those kind of</p>
<p>things false flag operations work very well</p>
<p>building one yourself</p>
<p>is very difficult</p>
<p>letting one</p>
<p>happen when you know it&rsquo;s already coming by looking the</p>
<p>other way like some people argue with</p>
<p>pearl harbor was we knew it was coming but we also</p>
<p>knew that was the impetus to get in there and we had a</p>
<p>bunch it you know</p>
<p>well we pulled out american warships yeah</p>
<p>we pulled out warships because we knew that it was</p>
<p>gonna be hit me in the actual</p>
<p>there was history channel documentaries</p>
<p>that have aired recently that have gone</p>
<p>as far as saying that we were</p>
<p>aware of the attack</p>
<p>and allowed it to happen so that we&rsquo;d be brought into</p>
<p>world war two</p>
<p>much like i think</p>
<p>comedy plus</p>
<p>you know tragedy</p>
<p>or time plus</p>
<p>tragedy equals comedy</p>
<p>you know people can make comedy out of</p>
<p>something as long as it&rsquo;s far enough in the distance i</p>
<p>think a lot of us can also accept things</p>
<p>the further they&rsquo;re in the distance</p>
<p>right like world war two or golf a</p>
<p>tonkin exactly</p>
<p>once you go oh yeah well sure there was the</p>
<p>right to talk</p>
<p>about the golf of</p>
<p>tonkin incident yeah</p>
<p>yeah pearl harbor probably had some i always</p>
<p>but this just happened</p>
<p>yeah and we want to believe in our own</p>
<p>we want to believe that this is a</p>
<p>different time</p>
<p>unfoolable because</p>
<p>this is and</p>
<p>those people were</p>
<p>idiots we on the</p>
<p>other hand i couldn&rsquo;t get fooled like that</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>i think like the</p>
<p>like the recession</p>
<p>i think the recession was</p>
<p>something that</p>
<p>could happen at any time</p>
<p>because our financial</p>
<p>system in this country is a</p>
<p>house of cards as it is in most</p>
<p>countries around the world it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>based on what the chinese call</p>
<p>fong p which means fart air</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it</p>
<p>smells and you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there but it has no substance at all it would not</p>
<p>you know fart air is there</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t rest</p>
<p>the economy yeah but you can&rsquo;t rest your cup on</p>
<p>it as it were they describe the economy that way fun p</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing and so</p>
<p>we know that</p>
<p>at any given time you</p>
<p>could you could</p>
<p>crush this you</p>
<p>could and you</p>
<p>could bring</p>
<p>down because it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>based on gold anymore</p>
<p>right money</p>
<p>based on that</p>
<p>even even money</p>
<p>based on gold is a resource</p>
<p>that people have to agree has</p>
<p>worth right</p>
<p>which is even i</p>
<p>think ridiculous</p>
<p>less flexible than</p>
<p>creativity you know</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worth as a human being</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t eat gold once i need it but i know</p>
<p>you guys can figure out how to farm well the really</p>
<p>crazy thing</p>
<p>about gold is the</p>
<p>zechariah sitchin</p>
<p>definition of why we&rsquo;re attached to it because</p>
<p>we were told</p>
<p>that we were genetically programmed to dig it up</p>
<p>along with diamonds and other well</p>
<p>gold no the reason we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>go for gold is he</p>
<p>wrote this in the 12th planet is</p>
<p>a book that came out in the 1970s</p>
<p>that the ancient sumerians</p>
<p>when they were</p>
<p>were being raised by the</p>
<p>anunnaki the idea that the</p>
<p>anunnaki came from this</p>
<p>other planet</p>
<p>these aliens and they intradicted</p>
<p>their dna into</p>
<p>human dna to</p>
<p>teach them to mine for gold</p>
<p>and the reason</p>
<p>why they wanted them to mine for gold is they needed to</p>
<p>suspend gold particles</p>
<p>in their atmosphere to protect themselves because</p>
<p>in their quest for</p>
<p>technology much like us they destroyed</p>
<p>their environment</p>
<p>and they needed it puffed around here</p>
<p>temporarily like</p>
<p>in part a particulate form</p>
<p>which yeah and that&rsquo;s just conductivity work</p>
<p>sense yeah well they didn&rsquo;t figure that out</p>
<p>until like 2000</p>
<p>it was like they had some sort of a symposium on</p>
<p>climate change</p>
<p>and they were trying to figure out ways to</p>
<p>protect us if we lost</p>
<p>a good percentage of</p>
<p>our environment and one of the ways was to suspend</p>
<p>gold dust or</p>
<p>reflected particles in the</p>
<p>atmosphere to reflect the</p>
<p>other thing is</p>
<p>paint your fucking roof white</p>
<p>if every house</p>
<p>in america had a</p>
<p>white roof instead of a</p>
<p>black roof it</p>
<p>would reflect as much</p>
<p>light as the</p>
<p>polar ice caps</p>
<p>would and what</p>
<p>would that do for us</p>
<p>it would reflect the heat</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>ultimately the ice does it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t specifically cool</p>
<p>the planet in that regard it reflects the light back</p>
<p>instead of absorbing it</p>
<p>and the absorbative heat once</p>
<p>the ice is gone the darkness of the rock itself pulls</p>
<p>the heat in</p>
<p>whereas the sunlight</p>
<p>reflects it back</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>white reflects it back so one of the big like</p>
<p>green tech things that they&rsquo;re trying to push is</p>
<p>white roofs or</p>
<p>light colored roofs huh but what</p>
<p>about solar</p>
<p>well solar absorbs but and uses it for another source</p>
<p>but in so far as rooftops you know</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t being used for that like sand does the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>you would have to make a choice yeah well</p>
<p>not necessarily environment or free electricity you</p>
<p>get as much as you&rsquo;d want and then</p>
<p>every other portion will be</p>
<p>white eventually we will have</p>
<p>reflective solar</p>
<p>panels we&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>like the light bounces off the</p>
<p>black silicone and then</p>
<p>which is a relatively new</p>
<p>molecule that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>well i say we but you know</p>
<p>human beings will be used we stand up</p>
<p>comics yeah</p>
<p>totally come up with new</p>
<p>the inside of it will be</p>
<p>will bounce the</p>
<p>white back into it and then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll look white</p>
<p>to the outside viewer but certain uv will get through</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always wanted to get off the grid</p>
<p>i really need to do it it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why</p>
<p>good i moved to</p>
<p>colorado for a bit</p>
<p>to get off the grid you</p>
<p>could totally do it here</p>
<p>you can totally do it here you get enough sunlight your</p>
<p>yeah do work like a charm but the</p>
<p>but insofar is</p>
<p>uh you know</p>
<p>the the concept of you</p>
<p>know getting</p>
<p>back to kind of nine eleven and the idea of was it</p>
<p>you know manufactured or was it</p>
<p>you know we were attacked or whatever i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a case for both at the same time</p>
<p>that there were people</p>
<p>in the government who saw opportunity in letting one</p>
<p>slide through</p>
<p>and maybe they didn&rsquo;t realize how big it would be</p>
<p>maybe they didn&rsquo;t realize that it</p>
<p>would be as big as 9 11 that it would be</p>
<p>maybe another</p>
<p>yeah but if they were gonna let</p>
<p>planes slam in the ideas that&rsquo;s what i mean as they do</p>
<p>stood down and let</p>
<p>this happen</p>
<p>but they had been</p>
<p>they had been warned</p>
<p>about people hijacking</p>
<p>planes and slamming</p>
<p>buildings in advanced i</p>
<p>agree but maybe they thought they could</p>
<p>maybe again</p>
<p>maybe how many</p>
<p>people have</p>
<p>to be complicit</p>
<p>how many people have to be complicit is it a</p>
<p>small number and everyone else just follows</p>
<p>orders it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>small number and everybody else has to</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re falling the</p>
<p>right orders and their</p>
<p>compartmentalize sure it&rsquo;s like the arguments</p>
<p>against chemtrails</p>
<p>you know if you look at chemtrails and you go okay</p>
<p>maybe here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you have to do here&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>tough decision you&rsquo;re in government</p>
<p>somebody comes</p>
<p>to you and goes look there&rsquo;s unequivocable science</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re fucking up the atmosphere</p>
<p>and if we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>start having more reflective</p>
<p>clouds in the sky</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re dead especially over big cities</p>
<p>so what we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>start doing is we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to start seeding the</p>
<p>clouds with barium</p>
<p>and aluminum</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>bring back the cloud</p>
<p>cover over our</p>
<p>major cities</p>
<p>so we bounce back some of the</p>
<p>pollution and we bounce back the</p>
<p>light the other direction</p>
<p>and we have to do this</p>
<p>otherwise 40</p>
<p>of the american populace</p>
<p>will die why not tell people</p>
<p>about this because</p>
<p>by doing it 12</p>
<p>are going to die barium and aluminum</p>
<p>will kill a certain number of the week</p>
<p>among us let&rsquo;s say this is a bad so you believe</p>
<p>that all those</p>
<p>things in the sky</p>
<p>those lines are all no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just saying i&rsquo;m using this</p>
<p>as an example</p>
<p>do you believe that though what do you believe</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>i do think there&rsquo;s weather manipulation</p>
<p>going on there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely weather</p>
<p>manipulation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>for it&rsquo;s been documented it is</p>
<p>you know in georgia if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain forms you have to fill out you know and</p>
<p>yeah i forget what the</p>
<p>exact subject is</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a government form and one of the</p>
<p>things has to deal with weather manipulation</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a standard totally</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve already shown that it can be</p>
<p>done totally in the 70s the government decided we were</p>
<p>gonna be on the cutting edge of it</p>
<p>american government decided we were</p>
<p>gonna be on the cutting edge of it and by the way</p>
<p>at that same moment the chinese went oh yeah us too</p>
<p>and just immediately started</p>
<p>leapfrogging</p>
<p>ahead of us in the technology</p>
<p>but the point is</p>
<p>the 9 11 part comes in</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got these</p>
<p>planes flying over you&rsquo;ve got soldiers</p>
<p>going up every day</p>
<p>and they know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dropping barium and aluminum into the</p>
<p>atmosphere and they know it&rsquo;s a bit of a</p>
<p>secret thing</p>
<p>and they know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for the betterment of management well</p>
<p>where do you</p>
<p>get this information though how do you know</p>
<p>that no i&rsquo;m just i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>using this example whether it&rsquo;s true or not</p>
<p>is amazing as</p>
<p>a maybe as a</p>
<p>maybe so theory</p>
<p>yeah this is</p>
<p>where the 9 11 part kind of</p>
<p>where it kind of</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s parody in the argument whether or not it was</p>
<p>an external or an internal threat</p>
<p>or who needed to</p>
<p>stand down who needed to be</p>
<p>on the game</p>
<p>in the game and outside the game</p>
<p>okay so you&rsquo;ve got every day</p>
<p>you got soldiers you come up to him and you go look</p>
<p>we have this new plan</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s necessary to save lots of lives you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fix the atmosphere</p>
<p>you guys are on</p>
<p>the tell the soldiers this well no you got this</p>
<p>front line thing</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>dumping shit behind your</p>
<p>plane you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna do it</p>
<p>every day without some sort of an answer</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>go to you look this is what we&rsquo;re doing and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna notice the difference</p>
<p>every day you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna drive home from your job at the base</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna look up there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be cloud</p>
<p>cover that wasn&rsquo;t there before</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re part of</p>
<p>that mission it&rsquo;s very important part of that mission</p>
<p>and you guys are okay how does this not get out though</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think this</p>
<p>would get out</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;d be some dude that</p>
<p>would be his fucking</p>
<p>voice would be altered on some</p>
<p>television show well i</p>
<p>think there are</p>
<p>guys like me that what i was doing was</p>
<p>going to save the environment</p>
<p>but i think it&rsquo;d be well that&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think they picked</p>
<p>their guys very well</p>
<p>yeah and you know so how</p>
<p>often do you</p>
<p>think this is happening that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spraying shit</p>
<p>in this guy</p>
<p>i mean if you look</p>
<p>at the crisscross patterns in the air over los angeles</p>
<p>three times a week okay</p>
<p>but do you know though that that&rsquo;s been proven</p>
<p>that turbine engines interact with</p>
<p>monster in the</p>
<p>app i&rsquo;m not even arguing no no i&rsquo;m not arguing whether</p>
<p>they actually create clouds</p>
<p>i mean it actually a moisture</p>
<p>and when it gets spun</p>
<p>the contrail</p>
<p>designs of the</p>
<p>chemtrails don&rsquo;t but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s dependent</p>
<p>scientifically</p>
<p>dependent on the amount of moisture that&rsquo;s in the air</p>
<p>i agree that</p>
<p>you can collect</p>
<p>that moisture and make it do certain</p>
<p>things and that&rsquo;s what weather manipulation is</p>
<p>right but these planes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not even</p>
<p>arguing whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s valley</p>
<p>leaving these trails</p>
<p>is so substantial</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re including commercial aircraft</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>would never crisscross commercial aircraft</p>
<p>in the atmosphere you</p>
<p>would never</p>
<p>create perpendicular lines</p>
<p>in the same</p>
<p>atmospheric</p>
<p>level commercial</p>
<p>planes and by the way</p>
<p>near cities they don&rsquo;t fly at that height</p>
<p>the the the the</p>
<p>trails that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing that that are effectively what</p>
<p>would be called chemtrails</p>
<p>are are higher</p>
<p>than planes fly when they</p>
<p>enter los angeles</p>
<p>atmosphere to land or take off</p>
<p>and they do not reach</p>
<p>those altitudes</p>
<p>until they are well outside that</p>
<p>area when you say crisscross okay</p>
<p>in a checkerboard</p>
<p>flight patterns</p>
<p>have you really</p>
<p>studied these yes you</p>
<p>would know what</p>
<p>happens ever crisscross</p>
<p>planes in the air at that</p>
<p>altitude but why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you and people are coming from different</p>
<p>directions they all go the same way no they</p>
<p>all bank around they go in circular format like this</p>
<p>but they and and on two</p>
<p>levels if that&rsquo;s why you have</p>
<p>the east and west or</p>
<p>north and south</p>
<p>landing strips</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>circle people around in a specific pattern</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>that seems to be something that</p>
<p>should be discussed like</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t that in</p>
<p>lax burbank has to go that way it can&rsquo;t circle around</p>
<p>that much it&rsquo;s not that far away you know so that</p>
<p>those burbank airports</p>
<p>yeah and then you have john</p>
<p>wayne in orange</p>
<p>counties coming up this way i</p>
<p>agree there&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>so much so they</p>
<p>get into gulf</p>
<p>streams like a road and they have</p>
<p>and they have</p>
<p>they have like what</p>
<p>would be like sort of cul</p>
<p>de sac looking</p>
<p>turns that the</p>
<p>planes go through and you&rsquo;ve been in them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>in holding patterns they go around and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>circular and they go back around to a specific landing</p>
<p>strip but they</p>
<p>never crisscross</p>
<p>is there a point</p>
<p>where they really do</p>
<p>a real audit of the actual patterns over la this is a</p>
<p>tough yeah but you can&rsquo;t just say that i</p>
<p>think you have</p>
<p>no i mean online you can actually see the airplane</p>
<p>yeah but you</p>
<p>patterns but you can see</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re supposed to go exactly or</p>
<p>where they do go</p>
<p>where they do go</p>
<p>what about cargo</p>
<p>planes and a</p>
<p>bunch of other different kinds yeah</p>
<p>well they all use the same path point</p>
<p>technically they</p>
<p>should yeah because you don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>would never</p>
<p>you would never have a</p>
<p>plane criss</p>
<p>cross another the</p>
<p>point is i&rsquo;m not arguing for or</p>
<p>against chemtrails i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>using it as an example okay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m using this example let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>based on a hypothesis</p>
<p>you have soldiers who are told</p>
<p>every day you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing something to help the environment</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re flying up</p>
<p>every day and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dropping this</p>
<p>barium and aluminum into the</p>
<p>atmosphere because this helps us create</p>
<p>cloud cover and this is the</p>
<p>whole point</p>
<p>and you go okay good all</p>
<p>right as a soldier i&rsquo;m on board</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>and then one day</p>
<p>somebody switches the canisters</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t tell anybody else</p>
<p>and you dump</p>
<p>pesticide or a poison or lithium</p>
<p>on the public</p>
<p>lithium and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and you know i&rsquo;m not saying this happens i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>saying that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the conspiracy</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to involve you at all</p>
<p>you will do exactly what you&rsquo;re told because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been doing something that you perceive as good</p>
<p>like every plane that went</p>
<p>north to do a war game</p>
<p>to practice</p>
<p>against russia</p>
<p>as if it was necessary</p>
<p>none of those guys were bad guys</p>
<p>they were just following the</p>
<p>order that was</p>
<p>given them and then eventually that gets to a</p>
<p>smaller and</p>
<p>smaller portion of the group</p>
<p>that are on</p>
<p>a need to know basis and they just kind of offer</p>
<p>orders and we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>this is the day we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do a big nato exercise okay</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s this different from any</p>
<p>other day we do a big nato exercise</p>
<p>well on this one</p>
<p>other shit is happening</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not privy to that</p>
<p>point you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still a good guy that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>so many good guys can be involved in something</p>
<p>nefarious without them actually being involved in it</p>
<p>you know specifically</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have any inclination or any information</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where people&rsquo;s fears i</p>
<p>think of chemtrails come from</p>
<p>is the idea</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s true or not is that they&rsquo;re afraid someday</p>
<p>dick cheney and his buddies</p>
<p>have said yeah we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>decide to switch the barrels</p>
<p>you know and people</p>
<p>think that this is</p>
<p>completely outside the realm of possibility and</p>
<p>absolutely wack o ness and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>crazy but operation</p>
<p>northwoods is the one</p>
<p>thing that always rings in my head and if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>aware of it go read</p>
<p>about it online because</p>
<p>it was a document that was</p>
<p>drafted by the joint chiefs of</p>
<p>staff signed</p>
<p>by the joint chiefs of</p>
<p>staff so they were down with this proposal</p>
<p>and it was vetoed ultimately</p>
<p>and it was in 1962 and the idea was that they were</p>
<p>going to attack american</p>
<p>civilians they were</p>
<p>gonna attack guantanamo bay they were</p>
<p>gonna blow up jet</p>
<p>liners and save</p>
<p>their way to cuba</p>
<p>on their way to cuba</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>gonna blame it on cuba and we were</p>
<p>gonna go to war with cuba</p>
<p>to do this exactly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing and</p>
<p>those guys a lot of</p>
<p>those guys by the way</p>
<p>still work in the military</p>
<p>absolutely and have by the way</p>
<p>risen in rank</p>
<p>since then and by the way we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never arrested and by the way</p>
<p>everything where you don&rsquo;t have a massive fucking</p>
<p>culling of all</p>
<p>these corrupt people and government</p>
<p>everything evolves</p>
<p>including corruption</p>
<p>and if corruption</p>
<p>existed in the 1800s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still around</p>
<p>today and if it</p>
<p>existed in 1962 and no one went to jail for it well</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>track the lineage exactly who hired who so</p>
<p>these people hired the next</p>
<p>generation and they</p>
<p>trained them and then it&rsquo;s all the same thing then</p>
<p>the chemtrails argument is</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m basically</p>
<p>using is an example of how you</p>
<p>could create a 9 11</p>
<p>kind of circumstance almost any level</p>
<p>just good people</p>
<p>would be involved</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even know and don&rsquo;t even aren&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>aware of it because they&rsquo;re doing something that they</p>
<p>think is helping</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say i don&rsquo;t know if i</p>
<p>agree with you</p>
<p>about the chemtrails</p>
<p>thing i think</p>
<p>i need to look into it and find out what the deal is</p>
<p>with the weather patterns and i just don&rsquo;t know how it</p>
<p>could be so prevalent</p>
<p>it just seems</p>
<p>silly to me</p>
<p>it seems like you</p>
<p>would have too much fluid</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have too many you know it</p>
<p>would be too obvious too many</p>
<p>people would be talking</p>
<p>about it again</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t do it during the day i</p>
<p>have no why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t they do</p>
<p>it at night</p>
<p>well the idea is hey</p>
<p>maybe clouds only last a certain amount of time</p>
<p>or you needed to do it</p>
<p>during sunlight</p>
<p>hours but the</p>
<p>point is either way i</p>
<p>agree with you</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s possible that it</p>
<p>could happen and i have no dog in that</p>
<p>race at all</p>
<p>i was using it as a pure example of</p>
<p>where you could get soldiers</p>
<p>as a direct example</p>
<p>to do exactly what they&rsquo;re told in a positive</p>
<p>sense on a secret level</p>
<p>where they know</p>
<p>they shouldn&rsquo;t tell anybody because they know</p>
<p>consequentially</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing something good but not everybody</p>
<p>would get it</p>
<p>and a level of</p>
<p>secret that&rsquo;s actually important and then</p>
<p>flip the game</p>
<p>where it could be something very negative</p>
<p>do you ever feel</p>
<p>frustrated that when you talk</p>
<p>about any of</p>
<p>these weird subjects you get</p>
<p>labeled as like a nut you get</p>
<p>labeled as like a loose</p>
<p>thinker or wacko</p>
<p>cause if you</p>
<p>start talking</p>
<p>about like tower 7 what happened with tower 7</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a loon man you get</p>
<p>boxed into this category of conspiracy theorist</p>
<p>which automatically</p>
<p>makes it very easy to dismiss you but i also</p>
<p>think that as a comedian</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s our job to not give a shit what</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>think and say stuff that</p>
<p>other people don&rsquo;t feel the freedom to say</p>
<p>whether or not we get rid of fuel</p>
<p>left at or with</p>
<p>is almost immaterial</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>we owe it to ourselves as comedians</p>
<p>specifically as the</p>
<p>philosophy that goes with comedy</p>
<p>to cut angles as you&rsquo;d say in</p>
<p>jiu jitsu to go instead of taking a</p>
<p>force directly on let me look at it from this</p>
<p>angle this angle this</p>
<p>angle and this angle</p>
<p>whereas other people only have</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll only look at the</p>
<p>tiger by its teeth and its nose</p>
<p>and know that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary and know that they don&rsquo;t wanna fuck</p>
<p>with it i think one thing that comics or any public</p>
<p>speaker that</p>
<p>has an interesting point of view does</p>
<p>is they offer a different path</p>
<p>for the person to start thinking right then</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>will listen to you and say you know what this</p>
<p>house parks guy is making a lot of fucking sense</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>maybe i&rsquo;m not 100</p>
<p>agreeing with him but i</p>
<p>see that this guy has really thought this out</p>
<p>and maybe i</p>
<p>should consider his ideas and</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not even about this</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re not looking at 9 11 you can give</p>
<p>a rat&rsquo;s ass whether it was fake or real whether it was</p>
<p>staged or an actual attack</p>
<p>and it has no real bearing on your life personally</p>
<p>but you might come</p>
<p>in touch with</p>
<p>a situation in your own social circle or in your job</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>this sounds like bullshit</p>
<p>to me and you</p>
<p>might be more apt</p>
<p>to look a little deeper and at the sides of it than you</p>
<p>would have beforehand</p>
<p>if you just get used to the idea</p>
<p>toe the line you know</p>
<p>i hear the official</p>
<p>story 9 11 i&rsquo;m for it</p>
<p>i hear the official story</p>
<p>pearl harbor i&rsquo;m for it</p>
<p>i hear the official</p>
<p>story of how</p>
<p>jesus was born</p>
<p>lived and died i&rsquo;m for it and</p>
<p>then you come up</p>
<p>against something</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t fit</p>
<p>right and you willing</p>
<p>to step back</p>
<p>and look at it objectively and say this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t jive with my consciousness exactly you have the</p>
<p>skill built</p>
<p>through critical</p>
<p>thinking to look at</p>
<p>again you could</p>
<p>you could do all the thinking</p>
<p>about building</p>
<p>seven you can do all the</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>you know whether or not they wanted the</p>
<p>tsa situation set up and all that kind of bullshit</p>
<p>um beforehand or like</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>like the like</p>
<p>that conservatives</p>
<p>groups had this you know</p>
<p>bilderberg idea that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna craft</p>
<p>human consciousness and put lithium in the</p>
<p>water and all that</p>
<p>alex joan shit</p>
<p>you can believe that</p>
<p>stuff you can</p>
<p>explore it without</p>
<p>going there and staying there</p>
<p>in the same way that you can sort of arguably take dmt</p>
<p>and not stay</p>
<p>in that brain stem</p>
<p>yeah you could you can get</p>
<p>trapped into that the</p>
<p>world is conspiracy you can get</p>
<p>trapped right</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not necessary the</p>
<p>whole point is</p>
<p>be aware yeah be</p>
<p>aware and don&rsquo;t just buy the</p>
<p>straight line you know like one of my wikileaks yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right i said it</p>
<p>you know i fucking conversation go on forever</p>
<p>i know but it&rsquo;s over i know it&rsquo;s</p>
