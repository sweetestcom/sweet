    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing nicotine.</p>
<p>Nicotine is one of the most commonly consumed substances</p>
<p>on the entire planet.</p>
<p>There are literally billions of people</p>
<p>that ingest nicotine on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Most of those people consume nicotine via smoking</p>
<p>and in particular, smoking tobacco.</p>
<p>Tobacco contains nicotine,</p>
<p>and it contains a bunch of other things as well,</p>
<p>which we will talk about.</p>
<p>And the burning of tobacco liberates nicotine</p>
<p>and makes it accessible to the various cells</p>
<p>and tissues of the body.</p>
<p>But of course, there are other sources of nicotine as well.</p>
<p>Some people consume nicotine through dip,</p>
<p>that is placing tobacco on the inside of the lip</p>
<p>or in the cheek.</p>
<p>Some people consume nicotine via snuff,</p>
<p>which is literally the shoving of tobacco leaves</p>
<p>up the nostrils and allowing the tobacco</p>
<p>to access the nervous system and other areas of the body</p>
<p>by permeating into the mucosal membranes,</p>
<p>as is the lining, the soft lining of the nasal passages.</p>
<p>And of course, there are nicotine patches, nicotine gum,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nicotine in pill form,</p>
<p>there are toothpicks dipped in nicotine, et cetera.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to separate our discussion of nicotine</p>
<p>from a discussion of smoking and vaping</p>
<p>and the other forms of delivery for nicotine.</p>
<p>We will be talking about smoking and vaping</p>
<p>in other routes of nicotine administration,</p>
<p>both for sake of highlighting their detriments to health</p>
<p>and believe it or not, in certain cases,</p>
<p>keep in mind, very specific certain cases,</p>
<p>the possible health benefits of delivering nicotine</p>
<p>through specific modalities.</p>
<p>Turns out those modalities do not include</p>
<p>smoking cigarettes or vaping.</p>
<p>And we are going to pay particular attention</p>
<p>to vaping today because vaping use is on the rise,</p>
<p>in particular in young people and vaping use</p>
<p>and the fact that most tobacco that&rsquo;s consumed</p>
<p>through vaping includes quite amount of nicotine</p>
<p>has created a scenario where nicotine,</p>
<p>because of its ability to change certain chemicals</p>
<p>in the brain can actually lead to addiction</p>
<p>for a number of other substances related to vaping</p>
<p>and vaping associated behaviors.</p>
<p>If all of that seems like a lot to get your arms</p>
<p>and your mind around right here at the outset, don&rsquo;t worry,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll walk you through this.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you have a background</p>
<p>in biology or not, I promise that you&rsquo;ll come through</p>
<p>at the end of this episode with a deep understanding</p>
<p>of how nicotine works in the brain and body,</p>
<p>some of its benefits, some of its potential drawbacks,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have clear optics as to why smoking and vaping</p>
<p>and other forms of nicotine delivery have the effects</p>
<p>that they do on your biology and psychology.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, I just want to highlight</p>
<p>a key takeaway from a previous episode,</p>
<p>which is our episode on focus,</p>
<p>and in fact was a toolkit for focus.</p>
<p>So during the toolkit for focus episode,</p>
<p>we talked about a large number of behavioral,</p>
<p>pharmacologic, and other interventions that you can use</p>
<p>to increase your level of concentration and focus</p>
<p>for whatever purpose, cognitive endeavors,</p>
<p>learning languages, focusing in school, on work, et cetera,</p>
<p>or physical pursuits.</p>
<p>Now, one of the key takeaways is that there are really</p>
<p>two key protocols that I believe everyone should understand</p>
<p>and know about and why they work,</p>
<p>because they are so effective,</p>
<p>and also because they dovetail nicely</p>
<p>with some of the information</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about today,</p>
<p>which will explain why nicotine is so effective</p>
<p>in increasing focus.</p>
<p>And these two protocols are as follows.</p>
<p>Data based on studies done in Wendy Suzuki&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at New York University,</p>
<p>of course, Wendy was a guest on this podcast,</p>
<p>so you can check out that episode if you like,</p>
<p>but studies done in her laboratory point to the fact</p>
<p>that a daily, very brief, in fact,</p>
<p>only 13 minute meditation can vastly increase focus</p>
<p>and focus ability,</p>
<p>not just immediately after the meditation practice,</p>
<p>but at all other times as well.</p>
<p>So again, this is a meditation practice done daily</p>
<p>for just 13 minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple meditation practice</p>
<p>where one sits or lies down, closes your eyes,</p>
<p>and directs your attention to a place</p>
<p>just between your two eyes and right above it,</p>
<p>so on your forehead, but just inside of that.</p>
<p>And please understand that your brain</p>
<p>does not have sensory receptors,</p>
<p>so unlike focusing on your fingertips</p>
<p>and the sensations there, if you focus on your brain,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t actually sense anything in your brain</p>
<p>except your thoughts.</p>
<p>So the idea then is that you continually</p>
<p>bring your focus back to that location</p>
<p>just about an inch behind your forehead over and over again,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the refocusing of your attention</p>
<p>to that location after it drifts</p>
<p>that succeeds in increasing your focus ability,</p>
<p>again, not just during the meditation and afterward,</p>
<p>but at other times as well.</p>
<p>So this 13-minute-a-day meditation</p>
<p>is exceedingly simple and exceedingly effective.</p>
<p>It should be performed every day,</p>
<p>but if you miss a day, just go back to doing it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t despair too much,</p>
<p>and you will see these positive effects save the data,</p>
<p>also increase effects on mood</p>
<p>and other positive aspects of mental health and performance.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first tool in protocol.</p>
<p>The second tool in protocol relates to the general,</p>
<p>what I call the arrow model of focus.</p>
<p>This was a model that I created in order to simplify</p>
<p>the vast amounts of data on focus and concentration</p>
<p>and how they are created</p>
<p>by the various chemical systems within your brain.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to hear a lot about these chemical systems,</p>
<p>again, today in the context of nicotine,</p>
<p>and they are as follows.</p>
<p>You can think about focus on any goal or any endeavor</p>
<p>as an arrow.</p>
<p>So just imagine an arrow,</p>
<p>which has an arrow head and a shaft,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll add a third component to it in a moment.</p>
<p>The head of the arrow,</p>
<p>meaning the direction of your focus,</p>
<p>is largely set by acetylcholine,</p>
<p>which is a chemical in the brain.</p>
<p>The shaft of the arrow is set by a chemical</p>
<p>called adrenaline, also called epinephrine.</p>
<p>Those are the same thing.</p>
<p>In the brain, typically, it&rsquo;s referred to as epinephrine,</p>
<p>and in the body, it&rsquo;s more commonly referred to</p>
<p>as adrenaline, but those are the same neurochemical.</p>
<p>Epinephrine slash adrenaline</p>
<p>represents the shaft of the arrow,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s providing the energy for which to focus.</p>
<p>And then we can put behind that arrow a little propeller</p>
<p>or a motor, if you like.</p>
<p>And the propeller or motor in the context</p>
<p>of this neurochemistry model</p>
<p>is dopamine, which provides ongoing motivation.</p>
<p>It pushes that arrow forward continually</p>
<p>as you strive to focus on a particular thing.</p>
<p>This particular arrow model,</p>
<p>that is your ability to increase your focus,</p>
<p>can be enhanced, therefore,</p>
<p>by increasing acetylcholine, epinephrine,</p>
<p>and dopamine simultaneously.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of different ways to do that,</p>
<p>but one of the more effective ways to do that</p>
<p>via supplement protocols is so-called alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>Alpha-GPC, taken in 300 milligram form,</p>
<p>10 to 30 minutes before a bout of cognitive work</p>
<p>or a bout of physical work,</p>
<p>will increase your focus by way of increasing acetylcholine</p>
<p>and to some extent, increasing epinephrine as well.</p>
<p>The dopamine increase will have to be achieved</p>
<p>either through cognitive processing,</p>
<p>that is telling yourself you&rsquo;re doing a good job</p>
<p>and moving forward because thoughts really do impact</p>
<p>your levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>or some other sort of pro-dopamine</p>
<p>or dopamine increasing protocol,</p>
<p>also discussed in the toolkit for focus</p>
<p>and our episode on dopamine for motivation and drive.</p>
<p>So the key thing here to understand</p>
<p>is that the 13 minute a day meditation</p>
<p>is a very effective way to increase focus capacity.</p>
<p>And then in the short term,</p>
<p>if you want to provide a boost now and again to focus,</p>
<p>300 milligrams of alpha-GPC can be very effective.</p>
<p>There are various sources for that,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll link to one of them in the show note captions.</p>
<p>By no means am I saying that you need to take alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>a number of people will certainly opt not to,</p>
<p>and a number of people might be saying,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ve heard that alpha-GPC can increase focus</p>
<p>by way of increasing acetylcholine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>or epinephrine, but it can also increase TMAO,</p>
<p>which is a kind of a negative marker of cardiac health</p>
<p>and cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>For that reason, I and many others will take 600 milligrams</p>
<p>of a garlic capsule, which can offset that TMAO increase.</p>
<p>It remains uncertain as to how much alpha-GPC</p>
<p>one needs to take before increasing TMAO levels</p>
<p>to a point where it&rsquo;s of concern</p>
<p>that you would even need to take the garlic capsule.</p>
<p>But I just mention it in any case</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a pretty simple fix.</p>
<p>Garlic has other health benefits too, of course.</p>
<p>And for most people, 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC</p>
<p>taken every once in a while.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t encourage people to take alpha-GPC</p>
<p>every time they want to focus.</p>
<p>I always emphasize behavioral tools first,</p>
<p>then focusing on nutritional tools,</p>
<p>and on occasion using supplement-based tools</p>
<p>to encourage increased levels of focus.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&rsquo;s a number</p>
<p>of different prescription compounds</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re working with a board-certified physician,</p>
<p>they could prescribe you</p>
<p>if you need additional tools for focus,</p>
<p>things like Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil,</p>
<p>armodafinil, Vyvanse, et cetera.</p>
<p>For many people are going to be important</p>
<p>and maybe even necessary for people with ADHD, et cetera.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a category into itself.</p>
<p>And as I always say, I&rsquo;m not a physician,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor, so I profess many things.</p>
<p>And today, I just wanted to pass along</p>
<p>or redirect your attention to that episode on focus</p>
<p>and highlight those two tools,</p>
<p>the 13-minute-a-day meditation and 300-milligram alpha-GPC</p>
<p>for increasing focus capacity and for acutely,</p>
<p>that is temporarily giving an additional boost</p>
<p>for a bout of focus.</p>
<p>And of course, if you choose not to use those protocols,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s perfectly fine too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly no obligation.</p>
<p>They are simply available to you</p>
<p>should you choose to try them.</p>
<p>And if nothing else, you now have in mind</p>
<p>the neurochemistry of acetylcholine,</p>
<p>epinephrine-slash-adrenaline, and dopamine,</p>
<p>and that will really set the stage for understanding</p>
<p>just how effective and why nicotine is so effective</p>
<p>at increasing focus, motivation,</p>
<p>and even, as you&rsquo;ll soon hear,</p>
<p>working memory and cognitive capacity.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic</p>
<p>and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about nicotine</p>
<p>and how nicotine impacts our brains, our bodies,</p>
<p>our mental performance, our mental health,</p>
<p>our physical performance, and our physical health.</p>
<p>And once again, I want to remind everybody</p>
<p>that we really need to separate out</p>
<p>a discussion about nicotine</p>
<p>from the discussion about the delivery device for nicotine.</p>
<p>In other words, when we&rsquo;re talking about nicotine,</p>
<p>we are not necessarily talking about smoking,</p>
<p>although we might be.</p>
<p>There are things associated with smoking and with vaping</p>
<p>and other means of getting nicotine into our system</p>
<p>that have their own effects,</p>
<p>both negative and in some cases, positive.</p>
<p>Indeed, later we will talk about</p>
<p>how you can actually use nicotine</p>
<p>to get over smoking addiction.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t come as a surprise to many people,</p>
<p>but what perhaps will come as a surprise</p>
<p>is the fact that many people actually use</p>
<p>nicotine-like substances or nicotine itself</p>
<p>in order to relieve nicotine addiction.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about that and what that looks like</p>
<p>and offer various protocols for you later in the episode.</p>
<p>I also want to mention here at the outset</p>
<p>that I have a longstanding interest in nicotine.</p>
<p>In fact, early in my scientific career,</p>
<p>I did research on nicotine</p>
<p>and its role in brain development.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had a longstanding interest in neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s ability to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>And so experiments that have been done by close colleagues</p>
<p>and friends of mine have really emphasized the fact</p>
<p>that acetylcholine, and in particular,</p>
<p>when acetylcholine activates</p>
<p>so-called nicotinic receptors,</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;ll learn more about in a little bit,</p>
<p>that can actually serve as a gateway or a trigger</p>
<p>for directed rewiring of the brain.</p>
<p>So this is fascinating.</p>
<p>We think of nicotine as something that we take,</p>
<p>but actually we have receptors,</p>
<p>that is locations in the brain to which nicotine binds</p>
<p>and can exert its effects.</p>
<p>And those receptors did not come about</p>
<p>because of the existence of tobacco</p>
<p>or the existence of vaping pens</p>
<p>or because of the existence of anything in the outside world.</p>
<p>The fact that there are nicotinic receptors</p>
<p>in our brain and body tells you that acetylcholine</p>
<p>and nicotine themselves have very important roles</p>
<p>in normal brain and body function.</p>
<p>So much so that I often like to point to an anecdote</p>
<p>of a very well-known Nobel prize winning neuroscientist.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t reveal who they are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not a faculty member at Stanford,</p>
<p>but many neuroscientists know of this person</p>
<p>and many people in the outside world know of this person.</p>
<p>And they are also well-known for their love of nicotine.</p>
<p>I once sat in this person&rsquo;s office and he,</p>
<p>I will reveal that as a he,</p>
<p>consumed no fewer than three pieces of nicotine gum</p>
<p>during that relatively short conversation</p>
<p>of about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>And that was surprising to me.</p>
<p>And I asked him why he was taking so much nicotine</p>
<p>through nicotine gum.</p>
<p>And he replied that for years he had been a chronic smoker,</p>
<p>which on the one hand had greatly impaired</p>
<p>his cardiovascular health and his fitness,</p>
<p>no surprise there.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk a little bit more</p>
<p>about what the underlying reasons are.</p>
<p>But most everyone, if not everyone knows</p>
<p>that smoking cigarettes or smoking in general</p>
<p>really impairs lung health.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just simply no question about it.</p>
<p>There are some more or less unhealthy ways to smoke,</p>
<p>but the quite honest message is that smoking of any kind</p>
<p>is going to disrupt lung endothelial function,</p>
<p>lung function, blood vessels, and so forth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to make it harder to breathe with vigor,</p>
<p>take deep breaths, deliver oxygen to tissues, et cetera.</p>
<p>That said, he also pointed out</p>
<p>that the data on nicotine specifically</p>
<p>are pointing to the fact that nicotine can be,</p>
<p>protective against certain forms of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>And that is why he continued to chew</p>
<p>nicotine-containing gum.</p>
<p>And he swore by the focus-enhancing</p>
<p>and motivation-enhancing effects</p>
<p>of nicotine-containing gum.</p>
<p>Now, that is not a call to arms for you</p>
<p>to run out and start chewing</p>
<p>or consuming nicotine-containing products.</p>
<p>We will talk about those products later in the episode,</p>
<p>some of their potential advantages,</p>
<p>some of their potential disadvantages.</p>
<p>Now, I share this anecdote</p>
<p>because it nicely separates nicotine</p>
<p>from the delivery device through which nicotine arrives.</p>
<p>Now, I haven&rsquo;t talked to this individual in a few years</p>
<p>to see whether or not the nicotine is working</p>
<p>to stave off any kind of Alzheimer&rsquo;s or neurodegenerative</p>
<p>or cognitive impairment that would come with age.</p>
<p>This gentleman is getting up in the years</p>
<p>and seems quite sharp nonetheless,</p>
<p>but then again, was always exceedingly sharp.</p>
<p>The point is, nicotine is a substance</p>
<p>that can both promote cognitive function</p>
<p>and under some conditions, if taken to inappropriate</p>
<p>or I should say to extreme dosages,</p>
<p>can also impair cognitive function.</p>
<p>So today we really need to have a nuanced conversation</p>
<p>about nicotine, one that includes some of the benefits,</p>
<p>some of the drawbacks, in particular for children,</p>
<p>certainly for people that are pregnant,</p>
<p>for people that have addictive tendencies,</p>
<p>and for people that have depression</p>
<p>and any other kind of mood disorders.</p>
<p>What I will tell you soon is that nicotine</p>
<p>can be very powerful as a mood modulator.</p>
<p>And many people who have tried to quit nicotine,</p>
<p>mainly through the form of smoking,</p>
<p>will find that their mood can drop substantially.</p>
<p>So nicotine does a lot of things in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d like to begin by talking about</p>
<p>what exactly nicotine is</p>
<p>and how it impacts your brain and body.</p>
<p>So what is nicotine and where is it found?</p>
<p>Now, obviously nicotine is found in the tobacco plant,</p>
<p>but nicotine is also found in nightshades,</p>
<p>that is tomatoes, eggplants, and sweet peppers.</p>
<p>Although the concentrations of nicotine</p>
<p>in tomatoes, eggplants, and sweet peppers</p>
<p>is vastly lower than it is in the tobacco plant.</p>
<p>You actually can also find nicotine in potatoes.</p>
<p>Now, why is nicotine present in potatoes and tomatoes</p>
<p>and in the tobacco plant at all?</p>
<p>Well, nicotine is a plant alkaloid.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into alkaloids a little bit later,</p>
<p>but it is thought that these alkaloids evolved in plants</p>
<p>as a way to prevent insects from eating them.</p>
<p>And without going into a lot of insect biology,</p>
<p>the reason or the rationale behind this explanation</p>
<p>is that nicotine is not only a substance in tobacco</p>
<p>that people use or in the various medications</p>
<p>that people use, but it&rsquo;s also used as a pesticide</p>
<p>because it can dramatically disrupt</p>
<p>the nervous system of insects.</p>
<p>It can render them infertile,</p>
<p>which is not to say that it renders humans infertile,</p>
<p>I want to say again,</p>
<p>it is not the case that nicotine renders humans infertile,</p>
<p>but it can make certain insects infertile.</p>
<p>It can actually disrupt their motor function</p>
<p>and their brain function.</p>
<p>And the reasons that it has such different effects</p>
<p>on insects, in other words,</p>
<p>it can kill them or prevent them from reproducing,</p>
<p>and therefore explains why plants probably evolved</p>
<p>to have this plant alkaloid, nicotine.</p>
<p>In humans, because of the differences in receptors</p>
<p>for nicotine, where they&rsquo;re located</p>
<p>in the types of receptors,</p>
<p>the effects of nicotine on humans is quite a bit different.</p>
<p>And again, it does not cause infertility in humans.</p>
<p>Although I will talk a little bit later</p>
<p>about some double-blind peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>conducted in humans that indicate that for instance,</p>
<p>nicotine can reduce penile girth,</p>
<p>that is the girth of the penis,</p>
<p>and can lead to certain forms of sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>And those changes are largely downstream of changes</p>
<p>in blood flow and endothelial cell function.</p>
<p>Endothelial cells are the cells that make up blood vessels</p>
<p>and other vascular type tissues within the brain and body.</p>
<p>So nicotine is found in these plants.</p>
<p>And what we can know for sure is that at some point</p>
<p>in human evolution, somebody or some group of people,</p>
<p>either, and here I&rsquo;m completely guessing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a just so story,</p>
<p>but someone or some group must have inhaled the smoke</p>
<p>from the tobacco plant,</p>
<p>or put the dried leaves of the tobacco plant</p>
<p>against some mucosal tissue,</p>
<p>any of the different mucosal linings of their body</p>
<p>by which substances can pass through, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Any of the mucosal soft lining tissues of the body</p>
<p>will allow certain substances,</p>
<p>not all certain substances to pass in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people can put tobacco in their mouth</p>
<p>and a certain amount of nicotine</p>
<p>makes it into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>put tobacco up their nose,</p>
<p>certain amount of nicotine gets into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard of people putting tobacco</p>
<p>in other orifices of their body containing mucosal tissue.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certainly not suggesting people do that,</p>
<p>but you get the idea and how nicotine</p>
<p>gets from these plants,</p>
<p>these dried leaves into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Burning tobacco leads to a heat induced change</p>
<p>in the availability of nicotine.</p>
<p>And this is why smoking tobacco or vaping tobacco</p>
<p>simply by heating it up allows the nicotine to be liberated</p>
<p>and go into the bloodstream</p>
<p>simply by inhaling it into the lungs.</p>
<p>We will get back to smoking of various kinds later,</p>
<p>but right now let&rsquo;s just keep our attention</p>
<p>on how nicotine is pulled from these plants</p>
<p>and into the human body.</p>
<p>Now, whether by inhalation or whether or not</p>
<p>by placing in contact with the mucosal tissue of the mouth</p>
<p>or other mucosal containing orifice of the body,</p>
<p>the nicotine then gets into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>And once it&rsquo;s in the bloodstream,</p>
<p>it only exerts its effects</p>
<p>because it binds to certain so-called nicotinic receptors.</p>
<p>Okay, so the nicotinic receptors</p>
<p>are of the acetylcholinergic variety.</p>
<p>I know this is a lot to think about and a lot to hear</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t heard about this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually quite simple.</p>
<p>Anyone can understand this.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is a molecule, a chemical that is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And when it binds to receptors,</p>
<p>that is a little parking spots on cells,</p>
<p>it changes the way those cells behave.</p>
<p>Those cells can increase their activity</p>
<p>and release other chemicals.</p>
<p>They can become electrically active.</p>
<p>They can do any number of different things.</p>
<p>When we ingest nicotine, it gets into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>And eventually some of that will get into the brain</p>
<p>and some of it gets into the body.</p>
<p>And in both of the brain and body,</p>
<p>there are these so-called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.</p>
<p>Now the so-called family, and indeed they are a family,</p>
<p>and this is how we refer to groups of receptors</p>
<p>of related design and genetic background, just like humans.</p>
<p>You have a family of these acetylcholine receptors</p>
<p>that are of the nicotinic variety.</p>
<p>So, you know, maybe on one street in your neighborhood,</p>
<p>you know the Jones&rsquo;s, on another street,</p>
<p>you know the Chow&rsquo;s, on another street.</p>
<p>Well, in your body,</p>
<p>you have the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,</p>
<p>and then you have the so-called</p>
<p>muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s really simple.</p>
<p>Nicotine only binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors</p>
<p>and there are a bunch of different ones</p>
<p>on a bunch of different tissues.</p>
<p>And the differences in those receptors</p>
<p>dictate what sorts of effects</p>
<p>the nicotine will have on those tissues.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what those effects are.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s do that by dividing the effects of nicotine</p>
<p>into effects on the brain.</p>
<p>So everything from the neck up and on the body,</p>
<p>the so-called central nervous system and the periphery.</p>
<p>Although I want to point out that your spinal cord</p>
<p>is part of the central nervous system.</p>
<p>So in fairness to the reality,</p>
<p>your brain and spinal cord are all central nervous system.</p>
<p>Everything else is considered the periphery.</p>
<p>Now there are a lot of different</p>
<p>nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,</p>
<p>but for those of you that want to know,</p>
<p>you aficionados, or if you&rsquo;re ultra curious about this,</p>
<p>the main effects of nicotine in the brain</p>
<p>are mediated by nicotine binding</p>
<p>to the so-called alpha-4 beta-2 receptor.</p>
<p>Alpha-4 beta-2 receptor.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t care about receptor subtypes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to come up later when we discuss</p>
<p>why nicotine suppresses appetite.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the major reasons</p>
<p>why people don&rsquo;t want to quit smoking,</p>
<p>or they quit smoking or another form of ingesting nicotine,</p>
<p>and then they relapse, they go back to smoking</p>
<p>or ingesting nicotine in some other way,</p>
<p>is because indeed nicotine will increase metabolism</p>
<p>and reduce hunger in large part by binding</p>
<p>to this alpha-4 beta-2 receptor</p>
<p>in a particular area of the brain.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to return to that in a little bit,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;ve ever heard that nicotine kills the appetite,</p>
<p>indeed it does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the behavior of smoking itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because you always have a cigarette in your mouth</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not eating more food,</p>
<p>although I suppose that might be a minor effect.</p>
<p>There are direct effects of nicotine on both appetite,</p>
<p>that is it reduces appetite,</p>
<p>and direct effects on metabolism,</p>
<p>that is it increases metabolism through its effects</p>
<p>on some other areas of the brain and body</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment.</p>
<p>And within the brain,</p>
<p>nicotine binds to this alpha-4 beta-2 receptor</p>
<p>in various locations in the brain.</p>
<p>And there are three and maybe a fourth</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about neurochemical effects of nicotine</p>
<p>after you ingest it.</p>
<p>First things first,</p>
<p>when you ingest nicotine by smoking nicotine</p>
<p>containing tobacco,</p>
<p>or if you place tobacco in contact with the mucosal lining</p>
<p>of the nasal passages of the mouth,</p>
<p>it takes about two to 15 minutes</p>
<p>for that nicotine to enter the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Smoking hits the bloodstream faster,</p>
<p>vaping even faster, I should mention,</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p>and placing tobacco directly in contact</p>
<p>with the mucosal lining is going to be the slowest.</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>nicotine gets into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>and then because nicotine can pass</p>
<p>through the so-called blood-brain barrier, the BBB,</p>
<p>which is basically a fence around the brain,</p>
<p>because it can pass through the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to have very rapid effects on the brain</p>
<p>in these four major categories</p>
<p>of neurochemicals and neural circuits.</p>
<p>The first of those categories,</p>
<p>and this is a very important one,</p>
<p>this is one that was brought up in the episode</p>
<p>on dopamine motivation and drive,</p>
<p>and I think not just all scientists,</p>
<p>but all human beings should know that within their brain,</p>
<p>they have what is called the mesolimbic reward pathway.</p>
<p>The mesolimbic reward pathway,</p>
<p>if you just want to call it the dopamine reward pathway,</p>
<p>is, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>a set of connections between a brain area</p>
<p>called the ventral tegmental area.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to remember the names of these things,</p>
<p>of course, but if you want to, that&rsquo;s fine too.</p>
<p>The ventral tegmental area, or VTA,</p>
<p>connects to another area called the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>Nicotine triggers the release of dopamine</p>
<p>from the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>This is what gives nicotine its rewarding properties.</p>
<p>It increases motivation.</p>
<p>It tends to give a not-so-subtle,</p>
<p>but very transient increase in feelings of wellbeing</p>
<p>and alertness and motivation,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because of the increase in dopamine</p>
<p>caused by nicotine directly within the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>Nicotine also triggers the release of certain neurochemicals</p>
<p>from the ventral tegmental area itself,</p>
<p>and those impinge on nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>and increase dopamine levels further.</p>
<p>This is what makes the rewarding properties,</p>
<p>or sometimes referred to as the reinforcing properties</p>
<p>of nicotine, so powerful.</p>
<p>This is why so many billions of people</p>
<p>ingest nicotine in one form or another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why nicotine is so hard to quit,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a potent increase in dopamine</p>
<p>from multiple neural circuit pathways</p>
<p>within this mesolimbic reward circuitry.</p>
<p>Now, within the mesolimbic reward circuitry,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an interesting feature.</p>
<p>There are accelerators that essentially</p>
<p>push out more dopamine, get more dopamine released,</p>
<p>and there are breaks of the so-called GABAergic variety.</p>
<p>GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know too much about it</p>
<p>to just understand that nicotine both increases dopamine,</p>
<p>but also decreases the activity of GABA,</p>
<p>and so this is like pushing on the accelerator for dopamine,</p>
<p>but also removing the break.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a two-pronged effect of nicotine</p>
<p>on reinforcement reward dopamine-related pathways,</p>
<p>the feel-good motivation pathways,</p>
<p>and that is an increase in dopamine</p>
<p>and a decrease in GABA,</p>
<p>and again, that&rsquo;s all mediated</p>
<p>through this mesolimbic reward pathway</p>
<p>involving the ventral tegmental area</p>
<p>and the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>So if you can conceptualize even just 5%</p>
<p>of what I just told you,</p>
<p>or even if you can just remember nicotine increases dopamine</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why it feels so good,</p>
<p>it makes you want more of it,</p>
<p>you will have everything you need to know in mind</p>
<p>in order to understand both why nicotine</p>
<p>is so highly used and indeed abused,</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s so hard to quit,</p>
<p>and that will point to avenues</p>
<p>as to how to quit or reduce intake,</p>
<p>and it also points to how nicotine can actually be used</p>
<p>in an antidepressant way, should you choose,</p>
<p>and we will talk about what the various criteria are</p>
<p>for choosing that,</p>
<p>but just understand nicotine increases motivation,</p>
<p>it decreases negative feelings of mood,</p>
<p>it increases positive feelings of mood and motivation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health,</p>
<p>our gut is very important,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health,</p>
<p>and those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>

<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>The second major effect that nicotine has in the brain</p>
<p>is that it increases acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator that exists in you and me,</p>
<p>it is released from multiple sites in the brain,</p>
<p>and the two major sites are the nucleus basalis,</p>
<p>so these are a collection of neurons</p>
<p>in the front and base of your brain,</p>
<p>and from some brainstem areas,</p>
<p>and there are a bunch of different ones</p>
<p>back there in your brainstem,</p>
<p>which is indeed in the back, that release acetylcholine.</p>
<p>That include the locus coeruleus as kind of a minor site,</p>
<p>the pedunculopontine nucleus,</p>
<p>there are a bunch of these different areas,</p>
<p>the parabigeminal nucleus,</p>
<p>there are a bunch of these things back there,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to go into all the names,</p>
<p>but just understand that there are little pockets</p>
<p>of neurons, nerve cells, located in the front and the back</p>
<p>and some extent in the middle of your brain,</p>
<p>but really in the front and the back of your brain</p>
<p>that can serve two major roles, here they are.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis</p>
<p>leads to a sort of spotlighting or highlighting</p>
<p>a particular neural circuits in the brain,</p>
<p>what do I mean by this?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re working on a puzzle,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a cognitive puzzle,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re doing a word puzzle,</p>
<p>or nowadays I&rsquo;ve heard of this wordle thing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on Twitter and people are always posting</p>
<p>their wordle thing, I have no idea what it is,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s some sort of puzzle,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s like a crossword puzzle,</p>
<p>and here if I&rsquo;m wrong, I don&rsquo;t know, educate me,</p>
<p>tell me what wordle is somebody, put it in the comments</p>
<p>and tell me if I should play it or not.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal, when acetylcholine is released</p>
<p>from nucleus basalis, the neurons are there</p>
<p>in the base of the brain, but they extend axons,</p>
<p>which are like little wires elsewhere in the brain,</p>
<p>and when acetylcholine is released,</p>
<p>it tends to be released at particular locations</p>
<p>in the brain that are associated with whatever activity</p>
<p>we happen to be doing, so if I&rsquo;m doing wordle,</p>
<p>here I&rsquo;m talking about it as if I&rsquo;ve ever done it,</p>
<p>doing a crossword puzzle or wordle,</p>
<p>well, the neurons that were involved</p>
<p>in trying to figure out the solution to that wordle</p>
<p>or crossword puzzle are active,</p>
<p>and then acetylcholine is released from the little wires,</p>
<p>the little endings of these cells in nucleus basalis,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden those neural circuits get a boost,</p>
<p>they become more active, and believe it or not,</p>
<p>our ability to perform that crossword puzzle</p>
<p>or at least focus on that wordle or crossword puzzle</p>
<p>gets enhanced, it literally increases,</p>
<p>our attention for that and not anything else is enhanced,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s literally like</p>
<p>a neurochemical attentional spotlight,</p>
<p>nicotine increases acetylcholine,</p>
<p>and thereby focus and concentration and mental performance,</p>
<p>not by changing the neural circuits</p>
<p>that are activated per se,</p>
<p>but rather by making more acetylcholine available</p>
<p>at those release sites,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s as if the spotlighter got more intense,</p>
<p>the highlighter is more intense than it would be otherwise,</p>
<p>and I should also mention</p>
<p>because of the so-called pharmacokinetics,</p>
<p>the time course in which nicotine has its effects,</p>
<p>which are pretty short-lived,</p>
<p>talk about those in a moment,</p>
<p>this enhancement in cognitive performance and attention,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be very transient,</p>
<p>probably on the order of about 30, maybe 45 minutes,</p>
<p>the half-life of nicotine,</p>
<p>depending on how it&rsquo;s ingested</p>
<p>and whether or not you have food in the gut</p>
<p>and what else is in the bloodstream, et cetera,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be anywhere from one to two hours,</p>
<p>but typically the effects of nicotine</p>
<p>will come on in about two to 15 minutes,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>and then will last anywhere from about 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>This is why in the old days,</p>
<p>and still to some extent in certain areas of the world,</p>
<p>but less so in the United States</p>
<p>and certainly in Europe as well,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t see quite as many people smoking cigarettes</p>
<p>for reasons we can discuss later,</p>
<p>but you would see these chain smokers</p>
<p>who are trying to maintain constant levels of nicotine</p>
<p>in their brain and bloodstream.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that nicotine has this one to two hour half-life,</p>
<p>but they could sense, no doubt,</p>
<p>the cognitive and the physical effects of nicotine,</p>
<p>including this cognitive enhancement effect</p>
<p>and highlighting of neural circuits effect,</p>
<p>and they would notice, they would smoke a cigarette,</p>
<p>and then for the next five to 45 minutes</p>
<p>have heightened focus,</p>
<p>and then it would start to drop off,</p>
<p>so they smoke another cigarette.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to maintain a constant level of nicotine</p>
<p>for whatever activities they needed to perform.</p>
<p>Obviously, chain smoking,</p>
<p>because of the terrible effects of smoking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about those terrible effects,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of them before,</p>
<p>cancer, depletion of just about every organ and body tissue</p>
<p>to the point that it can actually be measured</p>
<p>how many years of your life you&rsquo;re peeling off</p>
<p>in terms of lifespan and healthspan by smoking.</p>
<p>Well, the terrible effects of smoking are indisputable,</p>
<p>but the positive effects of nicotine on this circuitry,</p>
<p>part of the reason why people would chain smoke</p>
<p>in the first place,</p>
<p>rather than get one big peak of concentration and focus</p>
<p>and then just let it disappear after 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Okay, so what we have is a scenario</p>
<p>where dopamine is going up in the mesolimbic pathway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why smoking or ingesting nicotine in any other way</p>
<p>feels good and makes us feel motivated.</p>
<p>And then the increase in acetylcholine,</p>
<p>especially from nucleus basalis in the front of the brain</p>
<p>is the reason why it can increase our ability</p>
<p>to focus on particular types of endeavors,</p>
<p>particular mental work that we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>or maybe even particular physical work.</p>
<p>Although I should mention anytime</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pairing the words nicotine and physical work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious that because of the ways</p>
<p>that smoking impairs lung function,</p>
<p>those two things really run counter to one another.</p>
<p>In other words, if you are thinking about ingesting nicotine</p>
<p>through smoking or vaping</p>
<p>in order to improve physical performance,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a terrible idea.</p>
<p>The logic isn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>and the health detriments are certainly there.</p>
<p>The third neurochemical pathway that&rsquo;s strongly activated</p>
<p>when nicotine is brought into the central nervous system,</p>
<p>into the brain,</p>
<p>is epinephrine or in particular norepinephrine,</p>
<p>which is related to epinephrine.</p>
<p>Now, earlier I said epinephrine is the same as adrenaline.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still true.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine is closely related to epinephrine.</p>
<p>And for today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Although I realize as I say that,</p>
<p>that the medical students and some biology students</p>
<p>are probably going to have a minor seizure</p>
<p>when I lump norepinephrine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do that to be too much of a lumper.</p>
<p>You know, in science, we talk about lumpers and splitters.</p>
<p>Lumpers are people that like to oversimplify a little bit.</p>
<p>Splitters are people that really like to detail.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a lot of splitters on social media</p>
<p>from time to time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, wait, you know,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t mention the alpha two beta six receptor subunit.</p>
<p>Okay, look, I get it.</p>
<p>And I am all for having splitters in the room,</p>
<p>but for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>and for ease of digestibility of some of this,</p>
<p>just want to point out that norepinephrine, epinephrine,</p>
<p>and adrenaline, I&rsquo;m going to treat as a common pool</p>
<p>of similar, in fact, very similar molecules</p>
<p>that all have the same net effect,</p>
<p>at least in the context of this discussion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s to increase levels of alertness,</p>
<p>energy, and arousal.</p>
<p>And the way that nicotine accomplishes those increases</p>
<p>in alertness and arousal and energy within the brain</p>
<p>is by triggering the release of norepinephrine</p>
<p>from a little cluster of neurons in the back of the brain</p>
<p>called locus coeruleus, tiny cluster of neurons</p>
<p>that offers up, or I should say has,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re always there, from birth,</p>
<p>has these little wires, these axons,</p>
<p>that extend many, many places in the brain,</p>
<p>not every place, but virtually every place,</p>
<p>and can sprinkler the brain with norepinephrine</p>
<p>and essentially serve as a wake-up signal,</p>
<p>elevating levels of energy.</p>
<p>And when that combines with the acetylcholine</p>
<p>from nucleus basalis, which causes</p>
<p>attentional spotlighting increases</p>
<p>in concentration and focus,</p>
<p>and with the feel-good properties of dopamine</p>
<p>and the motivating properties of dopamine</p>
<p>released from the mesolimbic reward pathway,</p>
<p>now you can start to get a picture of why nicotine</p>
<p>is such a powerful molecule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making people feel motivated and good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making people feel focused,</p>
<p>and it makes people feel alert</p>
<p>when they would otherwise feel a little bit sleepy.</p>
<p>So this is a really powerful compound.</p>
<p>In fact, going back to our earlier discussion</p>
<p>about focus and some tools for focus,</p>
<p>and I encourage you, if you&rsquo;re interested,</p>
<p>to please check out the episode on focus.</p>
<p>There are a number of different tools</p>
<p>and protocols there to increase focus,</p>
<p>but here we&rsquo;re talking about one molecule, nicotine,</p>
<p>found in plants like tomatoes and potatoes</p>
<p>and the tobacco plant, and it can be synthesized</p>
<p>in a laboratory and ingested through a patch</p>
<p>or a gum or even a pill or a toothpick dipped in nicotine.</p>
<p>One molecule that can trigger activation</p>
<p>of all the circuits for focus and motivation</p>
<p>in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>That is remarkable.</p>
<p>That is absolutely remarkable.</p>
<p>And here we haven&rsquo;t even touched</p>
<p>on some of the psychological components of focus, right?</p>
<p>Whether or not we&rsquo;re interested in something,</p>
<p>whether or not we&rsquo;re excited about it or not.</p>
<p>This is a very, very powerful system.</p>
<p>So powerful, in fact,</p>
<p>that I think we can really place nicotine right up there</p>
<p>at the top, right next to caffeine</p>
<p>as the molecule that has fundamentally changed</p>
<p>human evolution, human consciousness, and human experience.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s never ingested nicotine,</p>
<p>this absolutely has to be true</p>
<p>because you have these nicotinic receptors,</p>
<p>which is to say that acetylcholine that&rsquo;s naturally released</p>
<p>without any external trigger within your brain and body,</p>
<p>or I should say without any trigger</p>
<p>from nicotine in particular,</p>
<p>is binding these nicotinic acetylcholine receptors</p>
<p>and is creating these effects in your brain and body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just absolutely staggering.</p>
<p>Now, earlier I mentioned the appetite suppressing</p>
<p>and indeed metabolism increasing effects of nicotine.</p>
<p>And while that&rsquo;s a fairly niche component</p>
<p>of what nicotine does, I mean, it&rsquo;s an important one,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the major reason</p>
<p>why most people consume nicotine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a moment and talk about that now</p>
<p>because we are in the brain</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about the effects of nicotine in the brain.</p>
<p>And so it seems to me the appropriate time</p>
<p>to talk about this.</p>
<p>Now we can have this conversation</p>
<p>about nicotine and appetite and metabolism</p>
<p>in a very simple and straightforward way.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the biology of metabolism</p>
<p>and appetite and how those things are mediated</p>
<p>by neural components,</p>
<p>so not just stuff like your liver, et cetera,</p>
<p>we have episodes on that,</p>
<p>but really the neural components of hunger and appetite.</p>
<p>I encourage you to check out our episode</p>
<p>on hunger and appetite.</p>
<p>But in that episode, we had a discussion</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;ll just briefly summarize now</p>
<p>that you have a collection of neurons</p>
<p>that sits right above the roof of your mouth or so</p>
<p>called the hypothalamus, hypo means below</p>
<p>and thalamus is right above it, hypothalamus.</p>
<p>So the small collection of neurons in the hypothalamus</p>
<p>do a number of different things related to sex behavior,</p>
<p>aggression, mediating the temperature of your body,</p>
<p>et cetera, but also appetite and suppressing appetite.</p>
<p>And within the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a compact collection of these little neurons</p>
<p>which are referred to as the POMC, P-O-M-C neurons.</p>
<p>And the name comes from the fact</p>
<p>that they express certain peptides</p>
<p>and we won&rsquo;t get into that now,</p>
<p>but the POMC neurons have a very profound impact</p>
<p>on whether or not you feel hungry</p>
<p>or whether or not you do not feel hungry,</p>
<p>whether or not your appetite is suppressed.</p>
<p>It turns out that when nicotine gets into the bloodstream</p>
<p>and then into the brain,</p>
<p>some of that nicotine binds to nicotinic</p>
<p>alpha four beta two containing nicotinic receptors.</p>
<p>Again, these subunits are receptors,</p>
<p>but basically the nicotine binds</p>
<p>to one of those parking spots, parks there.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, these POMC, P-O-M-C neurons</p>
<p>increase their electrical activity and appetite is suppressed</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because the POMC neurons have outputs</p>
<p>to various areas of the brain and body</p>
<p>controlling everything from how full we feel</p>
<p>to whether or not our blood sugar goes up or down,</p>
<p>which can impact our hunger.</p>
<p>And believe it or not, whether or not we have a tendency</p>
<p>to want to move the jaw of our mouth in order to chew food.</p>
<p>Yes, believe it or not,</p>
<p>the neural circuitry associated with appetite</p>
<p>and suppression of appetite actually dictates</p>
<p>whether or not you prefer to, or I should say,</p>
<p>are more biased or less biased to moving your mouth,</p>
<p>that is chewing, right?</p>
<p>Which makes perfect sense when you hear it, right?</p>
<p>One way to suppress appetite is to sew the jaw shut neurally</p>
<p>or at least make it less likely to open your mouth</p>
<p>and put food in it.</p>
<p>Actually, that reminds me of a story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just interrupt myself to tell a brief story</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a famous Nobel laureate</p>
<p>who won the Nobel prize for something</p>
<p>totally distant from appetite,</p>
<p>but once turned to a friend of mine at a meeting and said,</p>
<p>you know, I discovered the biological mechanism</p>
<p>for losing weight.</p>
<p>And my friend said, well, of course it&rsquo;s a, you know,</p>
<p>ingest fewer calories than you burn, right?</p>
<p>Calories in, calories out,</p>
<p>fundamental rule of thermodynamics</p>
<p>and basically the fundamental rule of weight loss,</p>
<p>weight gain, or weight maintenance.</p>
<p>And he said, no, it&rsquo;s actually the gene that controls</p>
<p>whether or not you open your mouth.</p>
<p>Now he was making a very nerdy joke.</p>
<p>So if you didn&rsquo;t register that as a joke,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about as funny as neuroscience or biology jokes get.</p>
<p>There are a couple of funnier ones,</p>
<p>but that one&rsquo;s kind of considered on the funnier side.</p>
<p>So this is why we&rsquo;re not considered comedians.</p>
<p>But the point of the matter is that whether or not you crave</p>
<p>or desire or impulsively want to put things in your mouth</p>
<p>and chew it will actually dictate how many calories</p>
<p>that you eat.</p>
<p>And so I find it remarkable and indeed important to know</p>
<p>that these POMC neurons are actually inhibiting the opening</p>
<p>and the movement of the mouth for chewing.</p>
<p>So when we smoke or when we ingest nicotine</p>
<p>in any other way, you activate these POMC neurons,</p>
<p>you suppress appetite, but in part,</p>
<p>you do that by actually limiting the impulse to chew.</p>
<p>Incredible, at least to me.</p>
<p>Now, in addition to limiting appetite</p>
<p>by changing one&rsquo;s desire to ingest food and chew it</p>
<p>and actual craving of food</p>
<p>by regulation of blood sugar, et cetera,</p>
<p>there do seem to be some quite direct effects</p>
<p>of nicotine on metabolism.</p>
<p>And the effects on metabolism aren&rsquo;t enormous.</p>
<p>These are increases in metabolism that are about 2%</p>
<p>up to about 5%.</p>
<p>But I want to emphasize that those are transient increases</p>
<p>in metabolism.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, people that quit smoking often find</p>
<p>that their appetite goes up.</p>
<p>They sometimes gain weight.</p>
<p>They sometimes do not,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not they offset that increase</p>
<p>in appetite with increased physical exercise</p>
<p>or with decreased food intake and other ways.</p>
<p>But there does seem to be this direct effect</p>
<p>of ingesting nicotine on metabolism,</p>
<p>which I find is interesting</p>
<p>because if you look in the literature,</p>
<p>one of the reasons why people are reluctant</p>
<p>to quit ingesting nicotine,</p>
<p>if, for instance, they want to quit</p>
<p>using the delivery device to nicotine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s causing such problems for their health,</p>
<p>like smoking or vaping,</p>
<p>or whether or not they find themselves,</p>
<p>quote unquote, addicted to</p>
<p>or have the habit of ingesting nicotine,</p>
<p>in part that&rsquo;s likely due to be the dopamine effects, right?</p>
<p>Because dopamine is highly reinforcing and rewarding.</p>
<p>It feels good, so people want to do more of it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also that for many people,</p>
<p>and here the data really point to the fact</p>
<p>that a lot of the younger female smokers</p>
<p>or younger female vapors,</p>
<p>or when I say that, of course, I mean,</p>
<p>younger females that vape,</p>
<p>are doing that because they like</p>
<p>the appetite suppressing effects,</p>
<p>which of course opens up an entire conversation</p>
<p>about the sociology of body imagery, et cetera,</p>
<p>a topic for a future podcast.</p>
<p>Okay, so nicotine has certain effects on the brain</p>
<p>by virtue of the fact that nicotine binds</p>
<p>these nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,</p>
<p>and those receptors are found on some,</p>
<p>but not all neural circuits within the brain.</p>
<p>And we talked about some of them already,</p>
<p>mesolimbic, the POMC neurons, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, when we ingest nicotine,</p>
<p>it goes from the bloodstream</p>
<p>to all the tissues and organs of the body.</p>
<p>How does it do that?</p>
<p>Amazing, it can pass to everything, the brain, the body.</p>
<p>It does that because nicotine is fat soluble.</p>
<p>And now when anytime people hear the word fat,</p>
<p>they tend to think about body fat, subcutaneous fat,</p>
<p>or maybe they think about dietary fat.</p>
<p>What I mean by fat soluble in the context</p>
<p>of nicotine being fat soluble</p>
<p>is that the cells of your body have an outer layer,</p>
<p>so-called outer membrane,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s made up of lipid, of fat,</p>
<p>very particular types of lipids in fact.</p>
<p>Nicotine has this remarkable ability</p>
<p>to move through that fatty tissue.</p>
<p>Not all molecules have that ability, but nicotine does.</p>
<p>So it can move relatively freely through the brain and body</p>
<p>and relatively freely from outside of cells,</p>
<p>extracellular space to intracellular space.</p>
<p>So it can get into cells, it can do that with the brain,</p>
<p>we talked about those effects,</p>
<p>and it can do that within the body.</p>
<p>Now, anytime we&rsquo;re talking about the body,</p>
<p>we could be talking about any number of things,</p>
<p>but today I&rsquo;m going to refer to the periphery and the body</p>
<p>in more or less the same way,</p>
<p>but keep in mind in the back of your head, pun intended,</p>
<p>you have your brain, your eyes, and the spinal cord,</p>
<p>and those three things make up your central nervous system,</p>
<p>the peripheral nervous system, and the periphery,</p>
<p>which is the rest of your body,</p>
<p>that contain your organs and so forth</p>
<p>outside of the nervous system,</p>
<p>things like your liver and your stomach, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to talk about now</p>
<p>because nicotine has profound effects</p>
<p>on the organs of the body that are separate from,</p>
<p>but that occur in parallel at the same time</p>
<p>as the effects of nicotine on the brain.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what some of those effects are.</p>
<p>When nicotine makes it into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>again, within two to 15 minutes of ingesting it,</p>
<p>depending on the delivery device,</p>
<p>your heart rate will increase,</p>
<p>blood pressure will increase,</p>
<p>and the contractibility of the heart tissue</p>
<p>will actually increase.</p>
<p>So what that essentially speaks to</p>
<p>is an increase in so-called sympathetic tone.</p>
<p>And when I say that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean an increase in sympathy for others</p>
<p>of the emotional sort.</p>
<p>What I mean is an increase in the sympathetic activity</p>
<p>of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>which is a real mouthful and mindful of ideas,</p>
<p>but all you need to know is that it&rsquo;s a generalized system</p>
<p>that increases levels of alertness and physical readiness.</p>
<p>So it makes you ready for action,</p>
<p>makes you ready for thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s balanced by a whole other system</p>
<p>called the parasympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>which is basically the so-called rest and digest system,</p>
<p>which is a system of neurons and organs, et cetera,</p>
<p>that put your body and your brain into a state</p>
<p>of not being able to think clearly,</p>
<p>to digest and to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Okay, so nicotine increases heart rate,</p>
<p>blood pressure, and contractibility of the heart.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to cause more blood flow in theory,</p>
<p>although it also tends to constrict blood vessels</p>
<p>in many locations in the body.</p>
<p>This explains the decrease in penile girth effect</p>
<p>of nicotine, in particular,</p>
<p>nicotine ingested by smoking or vaping.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, smoking and vaping reduces penis size</p>
<p>and also will have damaging effects</p>
<p>on the blood lining endothelial tissue.</p>
<p>So over time, it actually is impairing blood&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to get to the penis chronically,</p>
<p>as well as to other organs of the body.</p>
<p>But when people ingest nicotine acutely,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say they do that by Nicorette patch</p>
<p>or by toothpick dipped in nicotine,</p>
<p>it will have some of these same effects.</p>
<p>But when not smoking tobacco,</p>
<p>when bringing nicotine into the bloodstream</p>
<p>through other mechanisms,</p>
<p>many, if not all of the disruption</p>
<p>of the endothelial cell function can be bypassed.</p>
<p>But the effects on penile girth,</p>
<p>the effects on reducing blood flow to various tissues</p>
<p>is still present during the effects of nicotine,</p>
<p>which as I mentioned, last about one to two hours.</p>
<p>The half-life is about one to two hours,</p>
<p>depending on a number of factors.</p>
<p>Not interesting for today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>So when nicotine gets into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s making us more alert.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s preparing our body for readiness.</p>
<p>The heart is pumping harder.</p>
<p>Epinephrine, that is adrenaline,</p>
<p>is released from the adrenal glands,</p>
<p>which ride atop our kidneys.</p>
<p>So everything is pointed toward creating more readiness</p>
<p>to move, more readiness to think.</p>
<p>And again, this is happening in parallel</p>
<p>with all the effects of neurochemistry</p>
<p>that are happening with the brain</p>
<p>that we talked about a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about nicotine</p>
<p>is that while it causes this global increase in readiness</p>
<p>and alertness and attention and mood, et cetera,</p>
<p>it also has the effect of somewhat relaxing skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>Now that might seem counterintuitive</p>
<p>to those of you out there that already know</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m about to tell the rest of you</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t know it previously,</p>
<p>that your muscles are able to contract</p>
<p>because of the effects of acetylcholine</p>
<p>released from neurons in your spinal cord</p>
<p>that spit out acetylcholine onto the muscle</p>
<p>and bind to what?</p>
<p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.</p>
<p>Put into plain English,</p>
<p>nicotinic receptors are also the ways</p>
<p>in which your muscles can get activated.</p>
<p>So therefore, why would it be that increasing nicotine</p>
<p>would cause relaxation of the muscles?</p>
<p>And that has to do with some of the neural circuits</p>
<p>that are upstream of the muscles,</p>
<p>and it has to do with a little bit</p>
<p>of how the autonomic nervous system is arranged</p>
<p>in terms of which receptors go where.</p>
<p>A topic and kind of rabbit hole of conversation</p>
<p>far too deep for right now,</p>
<p>at least in the context of this already</p>
<p>somewhat detailed discussion of the effects of nicotine.</p>
<p>But if we were to zoom out</p>
<p>and just think about the effects of nicotine,</p>
<p>we now have a very clear picture.</p>
<p>Reward pathways are turned on,</p>
<p>attention is turned on, alertness is turned on.</p>
<p>You feel better than you felt a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>Your blood pressure is up.</p>
<p>Your heart rate is up.</p>
<p>Your preparedness for thinking is elevated as well.</p>
<p>And yet your body is somewhat relaxed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting state of mind and body.</p>
<p>Interesting because it&rsquo;s somewhat ideal for cognitive work.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to sit down and work on a book,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to sit down</p>
<p>and try and figure out a hard math problem,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to write a letter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been really challenging for you to write,</p>
<p>or maybe that you&rsquo;re really excited to write,</p>
<p>but that you&rsquo;ve been, you know,</p>
<p>slow to get out the door for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m talking about my own habits of procrastination.</p>
<p>Well, that state of being very alert,</p>
<p>but your body being relaxed,</p>
<p>is almost if not the optimal state</p>
<p>for getting mental work done.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re feeling agitated in your body</p>
<p>and you want to physically move your body,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to do cognitive work,</p>
<p>at least the sorts of cognitive work that involve</p>
<p>typing or writing or these sorts of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the exact opposite of the optimal state</p>
<p>for physical performance,</p>
<p>which is one of, yes, also alertness.</p>
<p>Yes, also motivation and elevated mood.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all wonderful stuff to have in mind, literally,</p>
<p>when you are exercising or competing in sport</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>But under those conditions,</p>
<p>you really also want to have a fast reaction time,</p>
<p>a low latency for muscle activation</p>
<p>so that you can make coordinated muscle movements</p>
<p>in the ways that you need to,</p>
<p>which is of course what&rsquo;s required of physical endeavors.</p>
<p>That tells us a few things.</p>
<p>First of all, it tells us that nicotine</p>
<p>is going to be generally a bad idea</p>
<p>for a pre-workout tool</p>
<p>or for enhancing physical performance.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s apt to be, and in fact is,</p>
<p>an excellent tool for enhancing cognitive ability.</p>
<p>And of course, that triggers my mind</p>
<p>to return to the anecdote</p>
<p>about my Nobel Prize winning colleague</p>
<p>who ingests nicotine by way of nicotine-containing gum</p>
<p>in order to increase levels of cognitive focus,</p>
<p>certainly not for going out and playing sport.</p>
<p>In fact, despite the fact that he is very, very tall,</p>
<p>he often points to himself</p>
<p>in an appropriately funny way</p>
<p>that despite being on the basketball team</p>
<p>of his high school,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably the worst player that ever existed</p>
<p>and they only positioned him there because of his height.</p>
<p>And I guess his head was designed</p>
<p>to prevent balls from entering the basket.</p>
<p>In any event, nicotine does seem to be very good</p>
<p>at enhancing cognitive function, at least in the short term,</p>
<p>which is not to say that it isn&rsquo;t without its side effects,</p>
<p>which we will talk about.</p>
<p>And again, those are side effects</p>
<p>that are independent of smoking or vaping</p>
<p>or other forms of ingesting nicotine.</p>
<p>For instance, dipping or chewing tobacco</p>
<p>is known to cause a 50-fold, yes, five zero,</p>
<p>50-fold increase in mouth cancers, things like leukoplakia,</p>
<p>and just generally is terrible for your health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to break it to you,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re dipping or you&rsquo;re using snuff</p>
<p>or things of that sort,</p>
<p>you know, certainly I&rsquo;m not going to tell people what to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my role in life,</p>
<p>but you are dramatically increasing the probability</p>
<p>of an oral cancer or of a mucosal lining cancer</p>
<p>of some sort.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that smoking and vaping</p>
<p>are bad for your health.</p>
<p>These other forms of delivery for nicotine</p>
<p>can be bad for your health as well.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not ingesting nicotine</p>
<p>by way of nicotine-containing gum or patch</p>
<p>or toothpick or other method is dangerous,</p>
<p>for other reasons, is a discussion that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Right now, it appears that provided the dosages</p>
<p>are kept reasonable,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about what reasonable means a little later,</p>
<p>and the frequency is kept relatively low,</p>
<p>so not relying on these things constantly,</p>
<p>there may in fact be some benefit</p>
<p>to ingesting nicotine from time to time,</p>
<p>provided that you are not still developing your brain.</p>
<p>Now, in reality,</p>
<p>neuroplasticity goes on throughout the lifetime.</p>
<p>Your life is actually one long developmental arc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like development occurs and then stops,</p>
<p>but certainly for people before puberty, during puberty,</p>
<p>and probably for the next 15 to 20 years after puberty,</p>
<p>avoiding nicotine is probably a good idea.</p>
<p>Now, of course, development is your entire life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like development starts and then ends,</p>
<p>but certainly for people that are 25 years old or younger,</p>
<p>ingesting nicotine as a way to enhance cognitive function</p>
<p>is probably not the best idea.</p>
<p>And certainly, please, for those of you</p>
<p>that are 15 years old or younger,</p>
<p>ingesting nicotine in any form,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s prescribed by your doctor</p>
<p>for a very specific clinical reason,</p>
<p>to me seems just like a terrible idea</p>
<p>based on all the data that I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is it&rsquo;s going to create a scenario</p>
<p>of nicotine dependence in order to achieve</p>
<p>heightened levels of mood and alertness, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re effectively talking about</p>
<p>is an addiction for nicotine directly,</p>
<p>not necessarily the delivery device method</p>
<p>like smoking or vaping,</p>
<p>although it could pull that in as an addictive</p>
<p>or habit-forming behavior as well.</p>
<p>But you want to let your neural circuits develop</p>
<p>to the point where, again,</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s a clinical need for a prescribed drug</p>
<p>from a licensed physician or psychiatrist, et cetera,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not relying on chemical enhancement</p>
<p>of these circuits.</p>
<p>For people who are 25 years or older,</p>
<p>and again, that&rsquo;s not a strict cutoff,</p>
<p>but roughly 25 years or older.</p>
<p>But for those of you that are thinking about</p>
<p>using nicotine to enhance cognitive function as adults</p>
<p>and your brain development is slowing down, right?</p>
<p>It never ceases, but it&rsquo;s slowing down</p>
<p>or has slowed down to the point where we would say</p>
<p>developmental plasticity is largely over</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re now operating in the context</p>
<p>of adult neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Well, in that case, there may be instances</p>
<p>in which increasing acetylcholine, dopamine, et cetera,</p>
<p>by way of nicotine ingestion might be a good idea,</p>
<p>but certainly not by smoking, vaping,</p>
<p>or by direct contact of tobacco</p>
<p>to the mucosal lining tissue of the mouth or nose,</p>
<p>so-called dipping or snuffing.</p>
<p>For the last 20 minutes or so,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about the biology of nicotine</p>
<p>specifically, how it impacts the brain,</p>
<p>how it impacts the body, why it feels so good,</p>
<p>why it can enhance focus.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve largely set aside smoking, vaping,</p>
<p>dipping tobacco, and snuffing,</p>
<p>and the negative effects that those all have</p>
<p>on mental and physical health.</p>
<p>Working down from the top of the head</p>
<p>to the bottom of the feet,</p>
<p>we can say that smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing</p>
<p>negatively impact every organ and tissue system</p>
<p>and cell of the body by virtue of the fact</p>
<p>that they all damage the endothelial cells.</p>
<p>Again, the endothelial cells are the cells</p>
<p>that make up the vasculature, which delivers blood</p>
<p>and other nutrients to all the cells and organs</p>
<p>and tissues of the body.</p>
<p>And those endothelial cells are strongly</p>
<p>and negatively impacted by all of the practices</p>
<p>that I just described.</p>
<p>Now, the way that that happens varies a little bit</p>
<p>from each one to the next.</p>
<p>For instance, it has been estimated</p>
<p>that cigarettes contain anywhere</p>
<p>from 4,000 to 7,000 toxins.</p>
<p>Now, the word toxins is a real buzzword these days.</p>
<p>You hear about detoxes and toxins,</p>
<p>but more specifically,</p>
<p>we know that it contains carcinogens.</p>
<p>These are cancer-promoting compounds.</p>
<p>For instance, we know that the tar in cigarettes,</p>
<p>even low-tar cigarettes,</p>
<p>as well as the ammonia within cigarettes,</p>
<p>as well as the formaldehyde contained within cigarettes,</p>
<p>as well as the carbon dioxide that&rsquo;s generated</p>
<p>from smoking those cigarettes are all carcinogens.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide also has the negative effect</p>
<p>of depleting the amount of oxygen that&rsquo;s delivered</p>
<p>to any and all of our tissues</p>
<p>by way of the impact of carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>binding hemoglobin and preventing hemoglobin</p>
<p>from delivering oxygen to the tissues of the body.</p>
<p>So while there may be 4,000 or 4,500 or 7,000 toxins,</p>
<p>depending on which cigarette,</p>
<p>which papers they happen to be rolled in,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re filtered or non-filtered,</p>
<p>the type of tobacco, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>there are a tremendous number of toxins</p>
<p>and there are some very potent carcinogens</p>
<p>within that long list of toxins.</p>
<p>Again, ammonia, tar, formaldehyde, and carbon dioxide</p>
<p>being the most potent of those carcinogens.</p>
<p>Now, the fact that there are carcinogens in cigarettes</p>
<p>sometimes leads cigarette smokers,</p>
<p>and particularly the cigarette smokers</p>
<p>that have the hardest time quitting</p>
<p>or that enjoy their cigarettes the most,</p>
<p>from saying, well, listen, everything is a carcinogen</p>
<p>or everything kills you.</p>
<p>Well, certainly that&rsquo;s not a true statement.</p>
<p>And while there are other carcinogens in the environment,</p>
<p>so environmental hazards like solvents,</p>
<p>and even if you work in a laboratory, for instance,</p>
<p>we use in the laboratory DNA intercalating dyes.</p>
<p>These are literally dyes that allow us</p>
<p>to see the DNA structure of cells</p>
<p>and see the proteins they make and see the RNAs they make.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very important to wear gloves</p>
<p>when you work with those things,</p>
<p>because as the name suggests, they intercalate,</p>
<p>they actually get in between the strands of DNA</p>
<p>and separate them.</p>
<p>They are mutagens, they mutate DNA.</p>
<p>They are often carcinogens as well.</p>
<p>So we have them in our laboratory,</p>
<p>but we take certain precautions</p>
<p>to not have them negatively impact our health,</p>
<p>safety protocols, and so on.</p>
<p>We hear that there are carcinogens in car exhaust</p>
<p>and bus exhaust and in all sorts of things like pesticides,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all true.</p>
<p>So in the argument of probabilities, one would say,</p>
<p>well, if there are all these other carcinogens</p>
<p>in the environment, why would you compound</p>
<p>their carcinogenic effect by smoking or vaping</p>
<p>or dipping or snuffing?</p>
<p>But that usually doesn&rsquo;t get people to quit smoking</p>
<p>or doing those things</p>
<p>because of the powerful reinforcing effects</p>
<p>of nicotine itself.</p>
<p>So again, nicotine is the reinforcing element</p>
<p>by way of triggering that dopamine reinforcement pathway,</p>
<p>the mesolimbic reward pathway.</p>
<p>And of course, there are all the other additional effects</p>
<p>of increased focus, such as increased ability</p>
<p>to pay attention to work or to others</p>
<p>that lead to other rewards.</p>
<p>And so then it becomes a situation of compounding rewards.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not really about the cigarette,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the nicotine,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not really about the nicotine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the dopamine that the nicotine evokes.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s not really about the dopamine</p>
<p>that the nicotine evokes directly per se,</p>
<p>but also about all the positive effects</p>
<p>that that increased dopamine results in.</p>
<p>So we can easily circle back to the negative effects</p>
<p>of smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing,</p>
<p>and say the endothelial cells are disrupted.</p>
<p>The endothelial cells are involved in delivery of blood</p>
<p>and other nutrients to every tissue of the body,</p>
<p>and smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing</p>
<p>contain carcinogens, which are cancer-promoting.</p>
<p>And because the epidemiological studies are out there,</p>
<p>we can actually arrive at some very clear numbers</p>
<p>as to how much life one will lose</p>
<p>from ingesting nicotine by way of those</p>
<p>four delivery devices,</p>
<p>or I should say any one of those four delivery devices.</p>
<p>Although I should also mention that many people</p>
<p>who are vaping are also smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>This is becoming increasingly common.</p>
<p>A lot of people are using vaping in one context</p>
<p>and cigarettes in another,</p>
<p>dipping in one context, vaping in another.</p>
<p>But even for those that only smoke, or only vapor,</p>
<p>only dip, or only snuff,</p>
<p>the negative effects are dramatic and calculable.</p>
<p>So it is thought that for every pack of cigarettes</p>
<p>consumed per day, so you could average that out</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a two-a-day cigarette smoker,</p>
<p>or a pack-a-day cigarette smoker, or two-pack-a-day,</p>
<p>for every pack of cigarettes smoked per day,</p>
<p>we can reliably estimate a 14-year reduction in lifespan.</p>
<p>So cigarettes are literally peeling years off your life.</p>
<p>Now, because of the way that the brain works</p>
<p>and the way that human beings anticipate the future</p>
<p>and can be grounded both in the present and the future,</p>
<p>or the present and the past,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just how the mind works, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we can think about the future,</p>
<p>but also realize where we are in time and space today.</p>
<p>Because of that, many people will say,</p>
<p>well, I enjoy cigarettes, or I enjoy vaping,</p>
<p>and so at least while I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;m enjoying it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the dopamine system</p>
<p>is not very good at understanding opportunity costs.</p>
<p>That is, what we would be doing in those 14 years</p>
<p>and what we would be enjoying,</p>
<p>and the enrichment that we would get</p>
<p>if we were to live into those 14 years.</p>
<p>So at some level, the smoker, the vapor,</p>
<p>is being rational when they say, yeah, but I enjoy this.</p>
<p>And so the years lost, I can&rsquo;t really register that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to register what you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;ve never had, right?</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can also point to the statistic</p>
<p>that there is this 50-fold increase in mouth cancers</p>
<p>from dipping, and there are nasal cancers as well</p>
<p>that are greatly increased by snuffing,</p>
<p>and from smoking, and now we know,</p>
<p>based on data from vaping,</p>
<p>that the endothelial cell damage</p>
<p>and the direct effects of damage to the lungs from tars,</p>
<p>and even if people are vaping,</p>
<p>which tends to have lower tars than do cigarettes,</p>
<p>even for people that are vaping,</p>
<p>greatly increased probability of stroke,</p>
<p>of peripheral vascular disease,</p>
<p>so this is peripheral pain, because remember,</p>
<p>blood is delivering not just blood, but other nutrients,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clearing things out from tissues,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s an accumulation of literally toxins and debris</p>
<p>that cells generate all the time, which is healthy,</p>
<p>but then normally is cleared away by the endothelial cells</p>
<p>and by other cell types of the immune system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all increased in people</p>
<p>that engage in these nicotine delivery device behaviors.</p>
<p>Rates of heart attack, rates of stroke,</p>
<p>rates of cognitive decline are all increased.</p>
<p>Now, you might say cognitive decline,</p>
<p>I thought that nicotine increases the likelihood</p>
<p>that we can maintain healthy neuronal function</p>
<p>and cognitive capacity,</p>
<p>it might even increase cognitive capacity in a potent way</p>
<p>in the short term, and indeed it does.</p>
<p>However, cigarette smoking and vaping</p>
<p>are now known to dramatically decrease cognitive function,</p>
<p>because one of the key things about the brain</p>
<p>is that it is the most metabolically demanding organ,</p>
<p>which means it consumes a lot of glucose,</p>
<p>or even if you&rsquo;re ketogenic, you need ketones,</p>
<p>you need nutrients getting to the neurons</p>
<p>and other cell types of the brain and nervous system</p>
<p>in order for it to function properly,</p>
<p>and when you disrupt the vasculature</p>
<p>through this endothelial cell dysfunction,</p>
<p>you get things like interstitial,</p>
<p>which just means in the spaces between dysfunction,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just beating up</p>
<p>the endothelial cells themselves,</p>
<p>but the spaces between the cells is being disrupted,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of debris that accumulates there,</p>
<p>and as a consequence,</p>
<p>the brain just simply will not function as well.</p>
<p>So you start getting short-term memory lapses,</p>
<p>you start getting working memory lapses,</p>
<p>working memory is the sort of memory</p>
<p>if someone tells you their seven-digit phone number,</p>
<p>typically nowadays people just share their info,</p>
<p>but seven-digit phone number or a sequence of numbers</p>
<p>or an address and your inability to remember that,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re walking back to the kitchen sink</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t remember what you were trying to remember</p>
<p>just a short moment ago, that&rsquo;s working memory,</p>
<p>working memory suffers, long-term memory,</p>
<p>projective or interrogate memories into the future,</p>
<p>how can you remember things in the future</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t occurred yet?</p>
<p>Well, this is more of a memory for future plans</p>
<p>or ideas and planning for things that are to come.</p>
<p>So what we can very reliably say</p>
<p>is that currently more than 1 billion, billion,</p>
<p>more than 1 billion people consume tobacco</p>
<p>in order to get their nicotine,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really the reinforcing element</p>
<p>within tobacco, more than 1 billion people</p>
<p>consume tobacco in the form of cigarettes every day.</p>
<p>A growing number of people,</p>
<p>more than half a billion people now are starting to vape.</p>
<p>The estimates range from 200 million to 500 million,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of debate about this</p>
<p>because a lot of people are hybrid smokers and vapors,</p>
<p>meaning they do one or both,</p>
<p>depending on time of day and location,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before.</p>
<p>But now you start to see how you can get to the number</p>
<p>that billions of people are consuming tobacco,</p>
<p>because of course you also have your people</p>
<p>that are dipping and your people that are snuffing.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>you have people that are engaging</p>
<p>in multiple of these behaviors.</p>
<p>So billions of people on planet earth,</p>
<p>anywhere from 1 8th to a quarter of human beings,</p>
<p>incredible, right?</p>
<p>Anywhere from 1 8th to a quarter of human beings</p>
<p>are consuming tobacco in one form or another</p>
<p>in order to get their nicotine one way or another.</p>
<p>And as a consequence are peeling years off their life,</p>
<p>dramatically increasing the probability of cancer,</p>
<p>stroke, heart attack, peripheral neuropathies,</p>
<p>brain dysfunction, meaning cognitive dysfunction,</p>
<p>memory impairment, sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>There are a number of studies that have looked at</p>
<p>increases in cortisol and while minor,</p>
<p>those increases do exist,</p>
<p>decreases in growth hormone and while minor,</p>
<p>those decreases exist.</p>
<p>But even setting aside the negative impact on endocrine,</p>
<p>on hormone factors,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, very clear that smoking, vaping,</p>
<p>dipping and snuffing are among the worst things</p>
<p>that we can do for our health, right?</p>
<p>They are among the leading causes of preventable death</p>
<p>and debilitating life conditions,</p>
<p>which may lead you to the question as to why in the world</p>
<p>would people do this?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out most of them don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>In the best surveys that one can find of,</p>
<p>if you could quit smoking, if you could quit vaping,</p>
<p>would you?</p>
<p>What you find is that at least for cigarette smokers,</p>
<p>70%, seven zero want to quit.</p>
<p>They would love to quit</p>
<p>and yet they find that to be exceedingly difficult.</p>
<p>And the reason they find it to be exceedingly difficult</p>
<p>is because of all the brain neurochemistry</p>
<p>that we talked about before.</p>
<p>The reason I spent close to 20 minutes</p>
<p>talking about dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway,</p>
<p>acetylcholine and nucleus basalis</p>
<p>and epinephrine and the relaxation of muscles</p>
<p>in the periphery and the increase in readiness</p>
<p>in the body and brain is that all of those combined</p>
<p>to make nicotine one of the most powerful</p>
<p>and potent cognitive enhancers.</p>
<p>And to some extent, physical enhancer,</p>
<p>although, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>the total number of physical exercise</p>
<p>or physical sport promoting effects of nicotine</p>
<p>is very, very small, if not zero.</p>
<p>There are certain conditions under which</p>
<p>one might imagine using nicotine</p>
<p>specifically for cognitive enhancement</p>
<p>where performance of complex motor skills</p>
<p>would sort of outweigh the negative effects</p>
<p>on the neuromuscular system,</p>
<p>our ability to generate coordinated movements.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually an excellent study</p>
<p>looking at the effects of nicotine,</p>
<p>not by smoking delivery,</p>
<p>but by a different delivery mechanism</p>
<p>in which they looked at performance of hitters in baseball.</p>
<p>The experiment was kind of an interesting one,</p>
<p>even though these were fairly skilled baseball players,</p>
<p>what they had them do is hit a ball off a tee.</p>
<p>As I recall growing up,</p>
<p>and admittedly, I didn&rsquo;t play much baseball,</p>
<p>but you start off on tee ball and then you would go,</p>
<p>I think it was to pitching machine.</p>
<p>Then they would use actual pitchers who throw the ball.</p>
<p>But in this case,</p>
<p>it was a couple of different baseball related tasks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d have people hit the ball off a tee,</p>
<p>but they had to direct that hit</p>
<p>toward a ball atop another tee.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fairly precise targeting that&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>in order to knock that ball off the other tee.</p>
<p>So this is an activity that involves not just motor output,</p>
<p>but coordinated motor output,</p>
<p>and not just coordinated motor output,</p>
<p>but directed coordinated output that requires some,</p>
<p>as we would say, top-down processing, right?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing that can be done reflexively.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing where the forebrain,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex in particular,</p>
<p>has to be heavily involved in order to suppress</p>
<p>certain actions and then create other actions.</p>
<p>So the basic takeaway of the study is that nicotine</p>
<p>delivered by way of nicotine gum,</p>
<p>not by smoking, dipping, or snuffing,</p>
<p>was able to increase cognitive performance and motor output.</p>
<p>So a rare circumstance where a specific set of demands</p>
<p>that involve both cognitive engagement</p>
<p>and physical engagement showed a slight,</p>
<p>but significant improvement.</p>
<p>But again, in most cases,</p>
<p>nicotine is just simply not going to improve</p>
<p>physical output if it&rsquo;s delivered through a smoked cigarette,</p>
<p>through vaping, through dipping, or through snuffing.</p>
<p>So if all these behaviors are terrible</p>
<p>for essentially every aspect of our health, frankly,</p>
<p>I mean, when you look at the literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible for pregnant women.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible for kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible for older people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible for younger people.</p>
<p>I mean, you really cannot find a scenario</p>
<p>in which smoking, vaping, dipping, or snuffing</p>
<p>are good for us.</p>
<p>And yet people like the effects on the brain</p>
<p>and they feel quite addicted to them.</p>
<p>Even if they say they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>most of those people would be unwilling to give up</p>
<p>their practice of nicotine delivery</p>
<p>for more than a few hours.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at the effects of withdrawal,</p>
<p>and we are going to talk about what withdrawal</p>
<p>of nicotine looks like,</p>
<p>what you find is that as soon as four hours</p>
<p>after the last ingestion of nicotine</p>
<p>by way of cigarette or vaping or dipping or snuffing,</p>
<p>what people start to experience is some agitation,</p>
<p>craving for nicotine, of course.</p>
<p>And while craving is kind of a vague concept,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a very specific biological mechanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the drop in dopamine that&rsquo;s starting to occur</p>
<p>so much so that there&rsquo;s a drop in dopamine below baseline.</p>
<p>That is the increase in dopamine</p>
<p>that would normally be experienced</p>
<p>from smoking, vaping, dipping, or snuffing</p>
<p>is now not happening.</p>
<p>And in fact, the levels of dopamine are dropping below</p>
<p>where they would have been</p>
<p>even without performing that behavior.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what craving is.</p>
<p>And withdrawal is an increased sense of that craving</p>
<p>as well as a lot of negative stuff like stomach aches</p>
<p>or nausea or irritability</p>
<p>and often collections of all of those.</p>
<p>So because these nicotine delivery approaches</p>
<p>are so terrible for our health,</p>
<p>and also because as many as 70% of people who smoke</p>
<p>would like to quit, but either feel they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve tried and failed repeatedly often,</p>
<p>or because it&rsquo;s just too scary,</p>
<p>meaning the reinforcing properties are too strong</p>
<p>and therefore they can&rsquo;t imagine living without them,</p>
<p>or the withdrawal effects are too strong</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t imagine living with those,</p>
<p>well then, is there hope for quitting smoking,</p>
<p>vaping, snuffing, or dipping?</p>
<p>And the short answer fortunately is yes.</p>
<p>There are excellent ways to do that.</p>
<p>And some of them are single event treatments.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about those shortly.</p>
<p>But before we do that,</p>
<p>I want to highlight one very brief point,</p>
<p>which is that nicotine is not the cause of cancer.</p>
<p>Nicotine is not the carcinogen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the other things in tobacco</p>
<p>or associated with the nicotine delivery device</p>
<p>that are causing cancer.</p>
<p>And I should mention the other negative impacts</p>
<p>on our health in particular</p>
<p>by way of disrupted endothelial blood vessel function.</p>
<p>Now that leads us to this issue of vaping,</p>
<p>because as many of you know,</p>
<p>and probably are thinking</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve been delivering this information,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t vape tobacco.</p>
<p>The way that vaping pens are designed</p>
<p>is that it includes some liquid, it involves heat,</p>
<p>and it does not involve the burning off of tobacco.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a constant updating</p>
<p>of the engineering of these vape pens</p>
<p>so that they can be very low heat.</p>
<p>In some cases, they use even non-heating approaches</p>
<p>to vaporize the nicotine</p>
<p>and allow it to enter the bloodstream very quickly.</p>
<p>I must say in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>vaping resembles crack cocaine.</p>
<p>The reason why vaping and crack cocaine are so similar</p>
<p>is the speed of entry of nicotine into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an episode about cocaine,</p>
<p>but I just want to very briefly touch</p>
<p>on some of the delivery routes for cocaine</p>
<p>because they parallel a lot of the delivery routes</p>
<p>for nicotine, and we can learn a lot</p>
<p>about drug pharmacokinetics and dopamine</p>
<p>if we look at the parallels between cocaine and nicotine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll preface this by saying cocaine is a terrible drug.</p>
<p>It is actually a Schedule II drug in the United States,</p>
<p>which means that it has a very, very limited</p>
<p>yet still present medical application,</p>
<p>mainly as an anesthetic in certain laboratory</p>
<p>and hospital conditions.</p>
<p>But aside from that, it&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>that cocaine is one of the most debilitating drugs</p>
<p>that humans can use because of the way</p>
<p>that it impacts the dopamine system.</p>
<p>And it basically creates a loop whereby the only thing</p>
<p>that can really trigger dopamine release is cocaine.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve said before, the way that I define addiction</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a progressive narrowing of the things</p>
<p>that bring people pleasure.</p>
<p>Cocaine certainly falls into the category</p>
<p>of addictive drugs, strongly addictive drugs.</p>
<p>And in fact, it has the additionally pernicious feature</p>
<p>that after using cocaine for some period of time,</p>
<p>the amount of dopamine that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>becomes progressively lower and lower and lower</p>
<p>so that people can never get back to a state</p>
<p>in which dopamine release is ever as great</p>
<p>as it was the first time they did cocaine</p>
<p>or prior to doing cocaine.</p>
<p>Now, with a long period of no cocaine use whatsoever</p>
<p>and protecting the dopamine system</p>
<p>in a number of different ways,</p>
<p>people can often, not always,</p>
<p>but often recover their dopamine system,</p>
<p>if not completely, then near completely.</p>
<p>So by all means, if you have a problem with cocaine,</p>
<p>quit, find a way to quit, get treatment,</p>
<p>get over that one way or another.</p>
<p>We have an episode with an expert guest,</p>
<p>Dr. Ana Lemke, who&rsquo;s a physician</p>
<p>and the chief of the Stanford School of Medicine</p>
<p>Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a world expert in dopamine and addictive substances</p>
<p>and addictions of all kinds.</p>
<p>You can find that episode at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s filled with information about</p>
<p>how to get over different types of addictions,</p>
<p>including cocaine addiction.</p>
<p>Also check out her absolutely phenomenal</p>
<p>and indeed important book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dopamine Nation,&rdquo; which touches on some of this as well.</p>
<p>And in the show note captions for the episode</p>
<p>where Dr. Lemke was my guest,</p>
<p>you can also find some additional resources</p>
<p>related to that.</p>
<p>So cocaine is terrible, that needs to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>It should be avoided,</p>
<p>and you should find a way to quit it</p>
<p>if you are currently using.</p>
<p>With that said, the delivery mechanism for cocaine</p>
<p>strongly parallels the delivery mechanisms for nicotine.</p>
<p>That is people will snort cocaine,</p>
<p>which is a lot like snuffing or dipping.</p>
<p>That is when people snort cocaine,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bringing cocaine into proximity</p>
<p>or into contact really with the mucosal lining</p>
<p>of the nasal passages,</p>
<p>which then allows the psychoactive substances</p>
<p>to permeate into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Very seldom do people eat it,</p>
<p>although that does happen from time to time.</p>
<p>People will inject it then as so-called mainlining,</p>
<p>which is a very rapid entry into the bloodstream</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s direct application to the bloodstream</p>
<p>by way of injection.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s crack cocaine,</p>
<p>which is essentially like a vaporizing of the cocaine</p>
<p>from a so-called cocaine rock.</p>
<p>That somewhat resembles vaping of nicotine.</p>
<p>So while the vape pen involves a liquid</p>
<p>that sold a cartridge that contains nicotine</p>
<p>and often other flavors as well, flavorings, I should say,</p>
<p>both crack cocaine and vaping cause very rapid increases</p>
<p>in the relative substances that are psychoactive.</p>
<p>In the case of cocaine, that would be cocaine</p>
<p>and the increase in dopamine in the brain and body,</p>
<p>I should mention.</p>
<p>And in the case of vaping,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very rapid increase in blood concentrations</p>
<p>of nicotine, much faster than occur with cigarette smoking</p>
<p>or other modes of nicotine delivery.</p>
<p>So that speed of onset turns out to be a critical parameter</p>
<p>because the speed of onset of nicotine</p>
<p>is going to also determine the speed of release of dopamine</p>
<p>in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area,</p>
<p>that mesolimbic reward pathway.</p>
<p>And with the mesolimbic reward pathway,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about the peak,</p>
<p>meaning the maximal amount of dopamine that&rsquo;s released,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the time course, how steep the curve is,</p>
<p>how quickly that dopamine increases</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to determine how reinforcing,</p>
<p>how habit forming,</p>
<p>and indeed how addictive a particular substance is.</p>
<p>So one of the major important differences</p>
<p>between vaping and cigarette smoking</p>
<p>is that the onset of dopamine release from vaping is faster.</p>
<p>And even a subtle increase in the rate</p>
<p>at which dopamine increases in the mesolimbic reward pathway</p>
<p>can make a given amount of nicotine</p>
<p>much more habit forming and addictive.</p>
<p>This probably explains the fact that many, many more people</p>
<p>in particular, young people, age 25 and younger</p>
<p>are vaping at phenomenal rates now.</p>
<p>People are starting to vape in just about everywhere.</p>
<p>You see this in restaurants, you see it on the street.</p>
<p>Indeed, you even see it in the classroom.</p>
<p>You know, this has actually become sort of sport of sorts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not something I encourage.</p>
<p>In fact, when I learned about this from a college student,</p>
<p>new college student,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s telling me that many college students</p>
<p>are actually bringing vape pens into the classroom.</p>
<p>I think this is also happening in high schools</p>
<p>and even junior high schools.</p>
<p>This is a really concerning practice.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m not trying to come across as the, you know,</p>
<p>the anti-vaping crusader, but I must say,</p>
<p>given the negative effects on one&rsquo;s health in the longterm,</p>
<p>but also given these exceedingly powerful reward properties</p>
<p>of nicotine entering the bloodstream quickly</p>
<p>and dopamine being released very quickly</p>
<p>from the mesolimbic reward pathway,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re seeing out there makes total sense.</p>
<p>Young people&rsquo;s brains are essentially getting wired</p>
<p>to the expectation that dopamine is going to be increased</p>
<p>dramatically and quickly under their control,</p>
<p>except it&rsquo;s under their control</p>
<p>only in a very narrow set of circumstances.</p>
<p>Recall the definition of addiction,</p>
<p>a progressive narrowing of the things</p>
<p>that bring you pleasure.</p>
<p>We can change that statement to also say</p>
<p>a progressive narrowing and specific kinetics,</p>
<p>that is specific time course</p>
<p>of the things that bring you pleasure.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a bit of a nerdier statement</p>
<p>than a progressive narrowing of the things</p>
<p>that bring you pleasure.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re going to see in the next few years,</p>
<p>I believe, is an entire generation of young people</p>
<p>for which a very large percentage of them</p>
<p>are going to be seeking out a pattern or feeling,</p>
<p>because to the person taking it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not looking at their dopamine levels</p>
<p>rising in their blood.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re experiencing this as an increase in focus,</p>
<p>an increase in alertness,</p>
<p>an increase in mood and wellbeing that is very rapid,</p>
<p>very dramatic, and that simply cannot be recreated</p>
<p>by any other substance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very concerning scenario.</p>
<p>Concerning because that mesolimbic reward pathway</p>
<p>is the only pathway, the only pathway,</p>
<p>by which you can achieve the rewarding properties</p>
<p>of any kind of endeavor.</p>
<p>Not just vaping, of course.</p>
<p>It is the way in which people achieve satisfaction</p>
<p>from reaching a relationship goal or an athletic goal</p>
<p>or an educational goal,</p>
<p>any kind of goal or sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>And so it comes as no surprise</p>
<p>that vaping is strongly associated</p>
<p>with increased levels of depression,</p>
<p>especially when vaping use drops off.</p>
<p>Why would that be?</p>
<p>If people are getting so much more dopamine</p>
<p>so much more quickly from vaping,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t they be feeling better?</p>
<p>That brings us back to the critical,</p>
<p>and I should say defining feature</p>
<p>of the dopamine reward pathway for motivation and wellbeing,</p>
<p>which is that initially a given substance will cause,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say an eight out of 10, again, arbitrary units,</p>
<p>but eight out of 10 increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>But with repeated use, what ends up happening</p>
<p>is that even at similar or higher levels of ingestion,</p>
<p>so not just one inhalation a minute,</p>
<p>but maybe two inhalations a minute</p>
<p>or inhalation every 30 seconds,</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s level four out of 10 activation of dopamine</p>
<p>and then three and then two,</p>
<p>and eventually it drops below baseline.</p>
<p>Now the whole system can be recovered by abstinence</p>
<p>from nicotine consumption,</p>
<p>but the dopamine system is applied to everything,</p>
<p>all sense of wellbeing, all sense of motivation.</p>
<p>So during the period in which one is abstaining</p>
<p>from nicotine and vaping in particular,</p>
<p>people do not feel good.</p>
<p>They feel miserable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called withdrawal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with a bunch of psychological</p>
<p>and physiological symptoms that all lead back</p>
<p>to trying to get to the same levels of dopamine release</p>
<p>in the same patterns that were experienced</p>
<p>when one initially started vaping.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not trying to paint a dark picture here,</p>
<p>but frankly, the picture is very dark.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very concerned about a practice of ingesting something</p>
<p>that powerfully modulates the dopamine system</p>
<p>with the sorts of kinetics that one sees</p>
<p>from ingestion of crack cocaine in young people</p>
<p>that has all these other negative health effects</p>
<p>that in the short term is very powerfully rewarding,</p>
<p>increased focus, wellbeing, et cetera.</p>
<p>But that over a very brief period of time</p>
<p>leads to a state in which</p>
<p>the entire dopamine reward system is impaired</p>
<p>and can become permanently impaired</p>
<p>unless one intervenes in a very deliberate way.</p>
<p>So people are directly controlling the rate of dopamine</p>
<p>and the frequency of dopamine release</p>
<p>by the duration and frequency of inhalations</p>
<p>off the vape pen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an incredible thing</p>
<p>because what it does is it sets up</p>
<p>the mesolimbic reward pathway for an expectation</p>
<p>that dopamine will be delivered on that schedule.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the things that makes vaping in particular</p>
<p>so hard to quit.</p>
<p>Vaping is actually harder to quit</p>
<p>than cigarette smoking for most people.</p>
<p>Does that mean that cigarette smoking</p>
<p>is fairly easy to quit for most people?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>70% of people who smoke cigarettes</p>
<p>report that they would like to quit</p>
<p>if they thought they could.</p>
<p>The success rate of quitting smoking</p>
<p>when people try to go just cold turkey,</p>
<p>just quit with no assistance whatsoever,</p>
<p>they might tell their family and friends,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m quitting, that&rsquo;s it, is exceedingly low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 5%.</p>
<p>So 5% of the people that say, that&rsquo;s it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not smoking again, despite cancer diagnosis,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not smoking again,</p>
<p>despite the fear of the negative health effects,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to ever smoke again,</p>
<p>despite the financial cost, the health cost.</p>
<p>I mean, I could list off a huge number of things</p>
<p>that it does that are negative,</p>
<p>but you already know these or you&rsquo;ve heard them.</p>
<p>It makes your skin worse.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, it lowers libido, it disrupts hormones,</p>
<p>it disrupts vascular function, brain function.</p>
<p>It does all these terrible things.</p>
<p>And yet most people who try and quit simply can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And of the 5% that succeed in quitting,</p>
<p>a full 65% of them relapse within a year.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a very depressing picture,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not to say that people cannot quit.</p>
<p>In fact, they can.</p>
<p>There are a couple of methods</p>
<p>that have been shown to help people quit.</p>
<p>Some are behavioral and some are pharmacologic.</p>
<p>I just want to touch on the behavioral ones first,</p>
<p>because it turns out that there&rsquo;s a quite powerful method</p>
<p>for quitting nicotine ingestion by way of cigarette smoking,</p>
<p>which also carries over to vaping.</p>
<p>This is beautiful work that&rsquo;s been done by my colleague,</p>
<p>in fact, close collaborator,</p>
<p>although I was not involved in the research</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m about to describe, at Stanford.</p>
<p>And his name is Dr. David Spiegel.</p>
<p>He is our Associate Chair of Psychiatry.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>and he is a world expert, if not the world expert,</p>
<p>in the clinical applications of hypnosis.</p>
<p>Now, when I say hypnosis,</p>
<p>a lot of people think stage hypnosis,</p>
<p>which is the hypnotist trying to get people</p>
<p>to do certain things and say certain things,</p>
<p>not necessarily against their will,</p>
<p>because they actually have to agree,</p>
<p>but the hypnotist is dictating</p>
<p>what the person thinks, says, and does.</p>
<p>Clinical hypnosis is vastly different from that.</p>
<p>Clinical hypnosis is where the person, the patient,</p>
<p>actually directs their own brain changes</p>
<p>toward a specific emotional or behavioral goal.</p>
<p>Work from Dr. David Spiegel&rsquo;s laboratory, done in 1993,</p>
<p>but that now has been repeated many, many times,</p>
<p>has carried over into some more modern studies,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll provide links to those studies</p>
<p>in the show note caption so that you can access them.</p>
<p>Those studies have shown that using a specific form</p>
<p>of hypnosis, people can achieve complete</p>
<p>and total cessation of cigarette smoking,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no reason to believe this doesn&rsquo;t also carry</p>
<p>over to vaping, through one single hypnosis session.</p>
<p>And the success rates are incredibly high</p>
<p>when one considers that normally</p>
<p>it would be only a 5% success rate.</p>
<p>The success rate with this particular hypnosis</p>
<p>developed at Stanford School of Medicine</p>
<p>by Dr. David Spiegel is 23% of people</p>
<p>who do this hypnosis one time succeed in quitting smoking.</p>
<p>Now, in the old days, which actually wasn&rsquo;t that long ago,</p>
<p>before the advent of smartphones</p>
<p>and before the internet took off</p>
<p>to the extent that it has now,</p>
<p>this was done by having someone come into the clinic</p>
<p>and Dr. Spiegel himself or one of his colleagues</p>
<p>would take somebody through the hypnosis.</p>
<p>Nowadays, you can access this hypnosis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful app that was developed</p>
<p>by Dr. David Spiegel and others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this app a few times on the podcast before</p>
<p>because there are hypnosis scripts within the app</p>
<p>for enhancing sleep, for improving ability of fall asleep</p>
<p>if you wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>for focus and a number of other behavioral</p>
<p>and emotional changes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a function in the Reveri app</p>
<p>for smoking cessation, which exactly parallels</p>
<p>the sort of in-laboratory and in-clinic approaches</p>
<p>that Dr. Spiegel would use</p>
<p>were you to show up at his clinic or his laboratory.</p>
<p>And since that&rsquo;s not possible</p>
<p>for the large number of people out there,</p>
<p>if you or somebody else is trying to quit smoking</p>
<p>or vaping or dipping or snuffing for that matter,</p>
<p>I strongly encourage you to check out the Reveri app.</p>
<p>You can find it easily by going to reveri.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available in various formats.</p>
<p>Some of it is available free, some of it is behind a paywall</p>
<p>but given the tremendously negative impact of smoking,</p>
<p>vaping, dipping and snuffing,</p>
<p>the hypnosis for smoking cessation that Reveri has</p>
<p>seems at least to me as a very powerful</p>
<p>and worthwhile resource.</p>
<p>So please check that out if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to quit ingesting nicotine</p>
<p>by any of the four methods that I just described.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are other methods</p>
<p>that people have used to successfully quit smoking</p>
<p>or vaping or other forms of nicotine delivery.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually an excellent review on this topic.</p>
<p>So before diving into a few of the specifics</p>
<p>about some of the pharmacology of using nicotine itself</p>
<p>to quit smoking or nicotine itself to quit vaping</p>
<p>or the use of various things, even SSRIs, antidepressants</p>
<p>to quit smoking or vaping,</p>
<p>I just want to point you to a review article</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;d like to get a complete survey</p>
<p>of all the options that are available,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an excellent review on this.</p>
<p>It was published just a couple of years ago in 2020.</p>
<p>And the title of the article is</p>
<p>Pharmacologic Approach to Smoking Cessation,</p>
<p>an updated review for daily clinical practice.</p>
<p>And even though this is mainly focused on smoking cessation,</p>
<p>it carries over quite nicely to vaping.</p>
<p>And it details a number of statistics,</p>
<p>the fact that every year 700,000 or more people die</p>
<p>because of smoking related diseases.</p>
<p>So there again, you have the negative health effects</p>
<p>that younger people are smoking,</p>
<p>that women are smoking more nowadays.</p>
<p>And that even though you see less smoking</p>
<p>typically in the US and Canada,</p>
<p>and even in Northern Europe, some places,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still many, many people are smoking</p>
<p>who would like to quit.</p>
<p>But that 75% of people,</p>
<p>at least according to this review earlier,</p>
<p>I said 70%, but estimates are as high as 75% of people</p>
<p>who try to quit smoking relapse within the first week.</p>
<p>The first week, they just go right back to it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how powerfully reinforcing the nicotine is.</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s the nicotine in the cigarette</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s powerfully reinforcing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the oral habit, the motor habit.</p>
<p>There is this thing about density</p>
<p>of sensory receptors in the lips.</p>
<p>People like bringing things to their lips,</p>
<p>food, cigarettes, other lips in some cases, et cetera.</p>
<p>There is a reinforcement pathway related to that</p>
<p>for sort of obvious adaptive reasons.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, there is a reinforcement</p>
<p>both from the behavior and from the dopamine released</p>
<p>from the nicotine itself.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>from the positive reinforcement</p>
<p>that comes from increased focus,</p>
<p>the money that you make through work</p>
<p>or your attentional ability</p>
<p>or the fact that you&rsquo;re alert and people feel you present,</p>
<p>all of that funnels back into positive reinforcement,</p>
<p>behavioral reinforcement,</p>
<p>and then what we would call addiction.</p>
<p>So this review covers all of that</p>
<p>and then steps beautifully</p>
<p>through nicotine replacement therapy and various compounds,</p>
<p>several of which I&rsquo;m going to talk about now,</p>
<p>which have been shown to increase that number</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier of only 5% of people</p>
<p>who try to quit with no other support,</p>
<p>pharmacologic or hypnosis or otherwise,</p>
<p>just say, that&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m not going to smoke again</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not going to vape again.</p>
<p>Only 5% of people succeed in doing that.</p>
<p>And even among those, many end up relapsing later.</p>
<p>There are a couple of pharmacologic approaches.</p>
<p>One of the main ones that&rsquo;s received a lot of attention</p>
<p>in recent years is bupripurone,</p>
<p>sometimes referred to by its commercial name, Wellbutrin.</p>
<p>Now, bupripurone is a compound</p>
<p>that increases the release of dopamine</p>
<p>and to a lesser extent, epinephrine</p>
<p>and some other neurochemicals as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used for the treatment of depression</p>
<p>and for smoking cessation.</p>
<p>Now, I want to point out again, I&rsquo;m not a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not telling you to take bupripurone,</p>
<p>aka Wellbutrin, but I&rsquo;m going to give you a little bit</p>
<p>of the contour of what&rsquo;s typically done</p>
<p>in terms of bupripurone administration</p>
<p>to help people get relief from some of the withdrawal</p>
<p>symptoms of trying to quit smoking or vaping</p>
<p>or other forms of nicotine ingestion.</p>
<p>Typically, bupripurone is taken</p>
<p>in 300 milligram per day doses divided</p>
<p>into two dosages of 150 milligrams each,</p>
<p>or sometimes there&rsquo;s a slow release formula.</p>
<p>The dosages will vary from person to person.</p>
<p>Want to really emphasize that there is an increased</p>
<p>seizure risk with bupripurone.</p>
<p>It only occurs in a small fraction of the population,</p>
<p>but nonetheless is a real concern</p>
<p>for those members of the population.</p>
<p>So for those of you with seizure risk,</p>
<p>whether you know it or not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be a valid concern</p>
<p>in terms of potential side effects.</p>
<p>The other thing about bupripurone</p>
<p>is that it has to be used with caution</p>
<p>in patients that have liver disease or renal disease</p>
<p>that can impact the amount that anyone can take.</p>
<p>Meaning sometimes people have to take a much lower dose</p>
<p>if they have renal disease or liver disease,</p>
<p>and sometimes they can&rsquo;t take it at all.</p>
<p>Sometimes if people are taking benzodiazepines</p>
<p>for whatever reason, or other sedatives,</p>
<p>there are contraindications there.</p>
<p>So bupripurone isn&rsquo;t a, you know,</p>
<p>kind of one size fits all or magic bullet</p>
<p>for quitting smoking.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, for people that can take it safely,</p>
<p>and again, this is a prescription drug,</p>
<p>a board certified psychiatrist or other physician</p>
<p>is going to have to prescribe it for you</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s appropriate for you.</p>
<p>And it moves that number of 5% success rate</p>
<p>to about what one sees with the clinical hypnosis</p>
<p>to about 20% of people will successfully</p>
<p>overcome their nicotine,</p>
<p>or I should say their smoking or vaping addiction.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s important to ask why this would work, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not as if bupripurone</p>
<p>is increasing nicotine per se.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s doing is it&rsquo;s tapping</p>
<p>on that mesolimbic reward pathway,</p>
<p>increasing dopamine, or at least allowing dopamine levels</p>
<p>to say substantially elevated enough</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t experience some of the drop in dopamine</p>
<p>that leads to the withdrawal symptoms,</p>
<p>the lessening of mood, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no coincidence that bupripurone</p>
<p>is also an antidepressant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common antidepressant for people</p>
<p>that experience negative side effects</p>
<p>with the so-called SSRIs,</p>
<p>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</p>
<p>that prevent them from taking those things</p>
<p>like lessened libido or appetite,</p>
<p>or in some cases increased appetite,</p>
<p>or any number of other side effects that some people,</p>
<p>not all, but some people experience with SSRIs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be prescribed Welbutrin,</p>
<p>bupripurone is the generic name.</p>
<p>So Welbutrin being the commercial name,</p>
<p>again, bupripurone is what they&rsquo;ll be prescribed instead.</p>
<p>With the caveats of seizure risk,</p>
<p>renal disease, liver disease, et cetera,</p>
<p>the outcomes with Welbutrin for smoking cessation</p>
<p>are pretty good.</p>
<p>I mean, if you think about an increase from 5% to 20%,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty dramatic.</p>
<p>And yet I also want to refer back to the incredible success</p>
<p>of the clinical hypnosis approach.</p>
<p>Again, you can find that at reverie.com.</p>
<p>The clinical hypnosis approach has a success rate of 23%.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very closely aligned with,</p>
<p>if not exceeding the success rate with bupripurone.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other pharmacologic approaches</p>
<p>to quitting smoking or vaping.</p>
<p>All of them generally circle back to increasing dopamine</p>
<p>and or norepinephrine in order to offset</p>
<p>some of the withdrawal symptoms of smoking cessation</p>
<p>or vaping cessation.</p>
<p>A very common approach for people to try and quit smoking</p>
<p>or vaping is to use nicotine itself to try and prevent</p>
<p>people from seeking nicotine through a cigarette</p>
<p>or a vape pen.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is people using a nicotine patch</p>
<p>or nicotine gum or other nicotine delivery device</p>
<p>that is not cigarettes and not vaping</p>
<p>in order to maintain levels of nicotine in their bloodstream,</p>
<p>which of course means maintain levels of nicotine</p>
<p>in their brain and body to the same extent that they would</p>
<p>if they were smoking or vaping,</p>
<p>maybe even gradually taking down the total amount</p>
<p>of nicotine in their brain and body by reducing the number</p>
<p>or size of nicotine gum pieces that they ingest each day</p>
<p>or keeping the patch on for a shorter amount of time</p>
<p>or getting a lower dose patch that releases less nicotine</p>
<p>total or over time.</p>
<p>All of those approaches have been shown to be</p>
<p>reasonably successful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get to the numbers in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but reasonably successful in allowing people to quit</p>
<p>smoking or vaping.</p>
<p>Again, most of the data is on cigarette smoking</p>
<p>because vaping is a relatively new phenomenon,</p>
<p>although quite troublingly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very rapidly increasing behavior,</p>
<p>especially in the young population.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m kind of lumping these two things together</p>
<p>because I think very soon we are going to need</p>
<p>an all-out campaign for how to counter vaping addiction.</p>
<p>So what do we know about smoking sensation</p>
<p>using nicotine itself?</p>
<p>Is the patch best?</p>
<p>Is nicotine gum best?</p>
<p>It turns out that a combination of approaches is best.</p>
<p>So somewhat surprising,</p>
<p>but it was very clear from the literature</p>
<p>that I was able to find that using nicotine patches</p>
<p>for some period of time and then switching to a gum</p>
<p>and then perhaps switching to a nasal spray,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be the most effective.</p>
<p>Then the question is how long to continue each of those</p>
<p>and whether or not to overlap them.</p>
<p>It seems as if doing one for about a week</p>
<p>and then switching to another for about a week</p>
<p>and then switching to another is one rational</p>
<p>and reasonable approach that many people</p>
<p>have used successfully.</p>
<p>Why would that be?</p>
<p>Well, it all has to do with the different rates</p>
<p>of absorption of nicotine into the bloodstream</p>
<p>and then the downstream consequences of that</p>
<p>on the dopamine, acetylcholine, epinephrine</p>
<p>and other systems of the brain and body.</p>
<p>And while there hasn&rsquo;t been an extremely detailed study</p>
<p>of the exact kinetics of how the nasal sprays</p>
<p>versus the transdermal patches</p>
<p>versus the gums, et cetera, work,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a logical structure to it</p>
<p>that will immediately make sense to you.</p>
<p>First of all, the transdermal patches</p>
<p>provide a fairly steady state dopamine release</p>
<p>across the day.</p>
<p>And oftentimes people are wearing them at night as well.</p>
<p>This is relevant because if people are ingesting nicotine</p>
<p>by way of smoking and vaping,</p>
<p>hopefully they&rsquo;re not waking up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>just to smoke or vapor.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, some people do that.</p>
<p>But of course, while people are asleep,</p>
<p>they are not smoking or vaping.</p>
<p>They always tell you,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fall asleep with a cigarette in your mouth.</p>
<p>You burn the whole house down.</p>
<p>But exceedingly rare to have people</p>
<p>who are smoking in their sleep.</p>
<p>So people wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and because the half-life of nicotine</p>
<p>from smoking or vaping is very short,</p>
<p>anywhere from one to two hours,</p>
<p>they are essentially in a state of withdrawal</p>
<p>at the point where they wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>How can I say that?</p>
<p>Well, remember, withdrawal sets in about four hours</p>
<p>after the last ingestion of nicotine by cigarette</p>
<p>or by inhalation from the vape pen.</p>
<p>So people are waking up in nicotine withdrawal</p>
<p>and then immediately going into the behavior</p>
<p>of ingesting nicotine or very soon after waking</p>
<p>for most people.</p>
<p>So nicotine patch is going to be very effective</p>
<p>for a week or so.</p>
<p>Again, talk to your physician</p>
<p>about the best approach for this,</p>
<p>but then switching to a nasal spray</p>
<p>or switching to nicotine gum for about a week,</p>
<p>which is going to change the kinetics</p>
<p>of that nicotine absorption to the bloodstream</p>
<p>and change the release of dopamine</p>
<p>and other neurochemicals within the brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to keep the system intentionally off balance</p>
<p>so that it never comes to expect one single pattern</p>
<p>or amplitude of dopamine release.</p>
<p>And that is a very powerful way for a,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call it a quitting method to work</p>
<p>because as I&rsquo;ve always said,</p>
<p>the most powerful schedule of dopamine</p>
<p>is going to be this random intermittent reward.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s used in the casinos</p>
<p>in order to take your money.</p>
<p>And generally they do on average,</p>
<p>they take your money more than you take theirs</p>
<p>and they take more of it, not just more often</p>
<p>because they use this random intermittent schedule.</p>
<p>The random intermittent schedule</p>
<p>is one in which you don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>when the peaks in dopamine are going to arrive.</p>
<p>And so there isn&rsquo;t this expectation and craving.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden when dopamine is released,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extremely high.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they get you to continue playing</p>
<p>even though basically you&rsquo;re losing money</p>
<p>and your dopamine is dropping.</p>
<p>They elevate it every once in a while.</p>
<p>Nicotine replacement can be used in a similar way,</p>
<p>but in a benevolent way in order to help you get over</p>
<p>smoking or vaping by keeping the total amounts</p>
<p>of dopamine variable around the clock.</p>
<p>And by changing the amount of dopamine that&rsquo;s released,</p>
<p>it seems to help people behaviorally and psychologically</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t come to expect</p>
<p>having a particular amount of dopamine</p>
<p>in their brain and blood at any given time.</p>
<p>And this is an important point</p>
<p>because it brings us to this notion of homeostasis.</p>
<p>Homeostasis is this tendency for biological systems</p>
<p>to try and reach equilibrium.</p>
<p>What goes up goes down, et cetera,</p>
<p>and to some extent to the same degree.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll talk about this right now</p>
<p>in the context of nicotine use, withdrawal,</p>
<p>and then the period in which people</p>
<p>no longer crave nicotine.</p>
<p>So you can imagine that if we were to measure</p>
<p>your heart rate, your blood pressure,</p>
<p>and your overall levels of alertness and wellbeing and mood,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just give that some value.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it runs from zero to 10, again, arbitrary units.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just take all those physiological measures</p>
<p>and the subjective measure of your mood</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s measure it four times an hour across the day,</p>
<p>across the waking hours.</p>
<p>What we would find is a line that would kind of</p>
<p>squiggle a bit, maybe a nice text comes in</p>
<p>that you really like, maybe you get a not so good news</p>
<p>and your kind of autonomic arousal is all over the place.</p>
<p>But on average, it&rsquo;s kind of a squiggly line</p>
<p>where it increases in the morning</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s typically when body temperature</p>
<p>and autonomic arousal increase.</p>
<p>And then towards the afternoon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to come sloping down.</p>
<p>And then right before sleep, there&rsquo;ll be an increase again.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;ve ever felt that,</p>
<p>you kind of run around a lot before sleep</p>
<p>and then it goes down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the typical contour of autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>mood, et cetera, across the day.</p>
<p>Removing, of course, life events</p>
<p>and things like psychiatric illness</p>
<p>and, you know, depression and et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the typical arc of that.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s superimpose on whatever that contour is for you,</p>
<p>nicotine.</p>
<p>So get a little bolus, as we say,</p>
<p>a little bit of nicotine from smoking a cigarette</p>
<p>or from taking an inhalation on a vape pen.</p>
<p>What ends up happening</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s an increase in blood pressure,</p>
<p>increase in heart rate, increase in mood,</p>
<p>increase in alertness,</p>
<p>all the things we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Over time, the body starts to adjust</p>
<p>so that the baseline</p>
<p>upon which that nicotine-induced increase</p>
<p>in arousal would occur is actually reduced, right?</p>
<p>Why would that be?</p>
<p>Well, the body and the brain,</p>
<p>your physiology seeks homeostasis.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s a big increase</p>
<p>in all those things like blood pressure and mood, et cetera,</p>
<p>typically your baseline will drop a little bit</p>
<p>to compensate for that over time,</p>
<p>after a couple of days or even weeks of ingesting nicotine.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you wake up,</p>
<p>you typically take an inhalation off your vape</p>
<p>or you have a cigarette around nine or 10 a.m.</p>
<p>You do that daily.</p>
<p>You get used to a certain level of mood and alertness</p>
<p>and wellbeing for that time of day.</p>
<p>And then if you smoke again in the afternoon,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you also get accustomed</p>
<p>to a certain level of mood and alertness</p>
<p>and wellbeing for that time of day.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;ll vary depending on life events,</p>
<p>but your system sort of gets used to it</p>
<p>and your baseline will drop to compensate</p>
<p>for those peaks so that the peaks aren&rsquo;t quite as high</p>
<p>as they were when you first started using nicotine.</p>
<p>Now you decide to quit.</p>
<p>So now what we&rsquo;re talking about is transitioning</p>
<p>from the consumption to what we&rsquo;re going to call</p>
<p>the withdrawal phase.</p>
<p>Now what happens is you say, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going cold turkey.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s only a 5% success rate,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to just go cold turkey.</p>
<p>Or somebody will say, no, I&rsquo;m going to use the Reverie app.</p>
<p>Or somebody says, no, I&rsquo;m going to use bupropion</p>
<p>or another method or nicotine patch</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>Well, setting aside the nicotine patch</p>
<p>or the nicotine delivery device and only focusing</p>
<p>on approaches for getting through withdrawal</p>
<p>that have no direct effects on nicotine.</p>
<p>Okay, so not using the nicotine patch,</p>
<p>but say the hypnosis or bupropion,</p>
<p>which can increase dopamine,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t increase nicotine directly.</p>
<p>What happens?</p>
<p>The day that you quit, that homeostatic mechanism</p>
<p>in your brain and body that sets your level of mood</p>
<p>and arousal, et cetera, does not know</p>
<p>and hasn&rsquo;t adjusted to the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not bringing in nicotine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not having that cigarette.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not having that inhalation on the vape pen.</p>
<p>So what ends up happening is that baseline,</p>
<p>which has been adjusted down to offset the increases</p>
<p>in mood and alertness, et cetera,</p>
<p>when you smoke or vape is lower than it normally would be.</p>
<p>So that 9 a.m. cigarette time or vape inhalation time</p>
<p>no longer feels above baseline.</p>
<p>It actually feels below baseline</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;re seeing is the lower amplitude</p>
<p>of arousal that was there to offset the increase</p>
<p>you were getting from vaping or smoking.</p>
<p>And then in the afternoon,</p>
<p>if normally you have a kind of phase of your afternoon</p>
<p>you really enjoy, you go outside,</p>
<p>you have a vape or a cigarette,</p>
<p>you normally are feeling relaxed or you go out at night,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d like to vape and you say,</p>
<p>nope, I&rsquo;m not going to do that anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel much, much worse</p>
<p>than you would have had you never started smoking or vaping.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not much help to anyone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s already started smoking or vaping,</p>
<p>but I say this because it&rsquo;s very important to understand</p>
<p>that the reason why relapse rates are so high</p>
<p>within the first week,</p>
<p>75% of people relapse within one week</p>
<p>and overall failure rates are 95%</p>
<p>is because people don&rsquo;t expect to feel even worse</p>
<p>than they did prior to ever smoking or vaping.</p>
<p>So that first week is absolutely critical.</p>
<p>And the beauty of understanding this is that</p>
<p>if you can get through that first week,</p>
<p>either by sheer grit or by finding other methods</p>
<p>to increase dopamine, healthy methods, I would hope.</p>
<p>And certainly cold showers, ice baths</p>
<p>have been shown to do that, by the way.</p>
<p>And this was described in Dr. Anna Lemke&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>Dopamine Nation.</p>
<p>Cold showers can increase dopamine exercise,</p>
<p>positive social interactions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that people will need to use</p>
<p>other healthy methods to offset that reduction in dopamine</p>
<p>if ever they stand to get through that first week.</p>
<p>And again, if you can get through that first week,</p>
<p>chances are quite a bit higher</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll be able to maintain the cessation</p>
<p>of smoking or vaping.</p>
<p>And of course, hypnosis, things like bupreparone</p>
<p>can also assist in that.</p>
<p>Bupreparone by way of increasing dopamine pharmacologically,</p>
<p>hypnosis through changes in neural circuitry</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t completely understood,</p>
<p>but seem to involve a remapping</p>
<p>of some of the so-called default networks</p>
<p>and some of the networks that are involved</p>
<p>in kind of understanding of your own internal state.</p>
<p>This stuff gets a little bit complicated.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to return to this in an upcoming episode</p>
<p>of the Hubern Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>But there are indeed legitimate changes in neural circuitry</p>
<p>caused by clinical hypnosis that can at least partially</p>
<p>explain why it is so effective in helping treat</p>
<p>or allow people to stop smoking and vaping.</p>
<p>So for those of you out there that either hear</p>
<p>or are saying yourselves, I just can&rsquo;t seem to quit</p>
<p>smoking or vaping or dipping or snuffing,</p>
<p>hopefully an understanding of how that homeostasis process</p>
<p>works and the time course of nicotine,</p>
<p>depending on the delivery device,</p>
<p>hopefully understanding that will allow you</p>
<p>to develop a protocol.</p>
<p>Maybe it involves hypnosis.</p>
<p>Maybe it involves just understanding that</p>
<p>the typical times in which you ingested nicotine</p>
<p>through any of the different approaches</p>
<p>of bringing it into your system</p>
<p>are going to be particularly hard,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t just mean particularly hard.</p>
<p>I mean, particularly hard,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to need to do something specific</p>
<p>to offset that decrease in overall autonomic arousal</p>
<p>and dopamine, et cetera.</p>
<p>Hopefully an understanding of that will allow you</p>
<p>to get through that first week.</p>
<p>And if you can make it past that first week,</p>
<p>you stand a very good chance of never going back.</p>
<p>However, I did consult with Dr. David Spiegel</p>
<p>in anticipation of this episode,</p>
<p>regardless of the method that you used to quit smoking</p>
<p>or vaping, snuffing, or dipping.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good evidence that a routine,</p>
<p>maybe once a month or even once a week hypnosis</p>
<p>type approach to replenish</p>
<p>or even enhance the neural circuits</p>
<p>that are allowing you to stay away from nicotine</p>
<p>is going to be a very good idea.</p>
<p>And given that it&rsquo;s a purely behavioral intervention,</p>
<p>I can see no reason as to why</p>
<p>people wouldn&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>Go in and reinforce, tighten the bolts on that circuitry</p>
<p>that are allowing you to not feel the impulse to smoke,</p>
<p>not feel the impulse to vape.</p>
<p>And just a very brief mention,</p>
<p>there is a vast literature on the fact that</p>
<p>when people have quit smoking or vaping</p>
<p>or other form of consuming nicotine,</p>
<p>that when they consume alcohol,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a much higher probability of relapse.</p>
<p>There are interactions between alcohol and nicotine</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll cover in future episodes.</p>
<p>But for those of you that want to quit,</p>
<p>I want to assure you,</p>
<p>despite the fact that 95% of people fail</p>
<p>with the appropriate tools.</p>
<p>And I like to think with an additional understanding</p>
<p>of the underlying biology and psychology</p>
<p>and what you can expect and when to really dig your heels</p>
<p>and when to reinforce your system with more dopamine</p>
<p>through any of the number of the different protocols</p>
<p>and tools that we&rsquo;ve offered here</p>
<p>and that you can find elsewhere</p>
<p>in other episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>I have a high degree of confidence</p>
<p>that you can quit smoking or vaping, dipping or snuffing.</p>
<p>So today, typical of frankly all episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve covered a lot about the biology of a particular system.</p>
<p>We talked about the biology of nicotine in particular.</p>
<p>We talked about vaping and smoking, dipping and snuffing</p>
<p>and the negative health consequences associated with those.</p>
<p>I want to reemphasize that nicotine</p>
<p>is not what causes cancer.</p>
<p>It is the delivery device that causes cancer</p>
<p>and the other negative health effects.</p>
<p>That is not to say that people should be ingesting nicotine</p>
<p>through any different methods simply to get</p>
<p>a cognitive boost.</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances</p>
<p>where that might be appropriate for the occasional workout,</p>
<p>certainly not for physical exercise,</p>
<p>given what we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>But of course, there are more and more approaches</p>
<p>to increasing not just nicotine, but acetylcholine generally</p>
<p>in order to achieve cognitive enhancement</p>
<p>or physical enhancement,</p>
<p>or I should say physical performance enhancement.</p>
<p>Some of those we talked about earlier, such as alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>In any event, nicotine, it should now be clear,</p>
<p>is an immensely powerful substance,</p>
<p>one of the most commonly ingested substances</p>
<p>on the face of the earth and has been for a very long time.</p>
<p>And now that you understand the underlying biology</p>
<p>and the way in which it changes your psychology</p>
<p>and physiology, that should come as no surprise.</p>

<p>During today&rsquo;s episode and on various previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast, we talk about supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like enhancing sleep,</p>
<p>hormone function, focus, and so on.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast is partnered</p>
<p>with Momentus Supplements, spelled Momentus, O-U-S.</p>
<p>You can find those supplements</p>
<p>at livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already subscribed</p>
<p>to the Huberman Lab podcast neural network newsletter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a monthly newsletter.</p>
<p>We provide summaries of different podcasts</p>
<p>and we provide summaries of specific tools</p>
<p>that you can use to enhance sleep, for instance,</p>
<p>or enhance dopamine.</p>
<p>We talk about deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>deliberate heat exposure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to sign up for,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s completely zero cost.</p>
<p>Go to hubermanlab.com, go to the menu, click on newsletter,</p>
<p>provide us your email.</p>
<p>We do not share it with anybody else.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll receive that monthly newsletter.</p>
<p>And there you can also find PDFs of previous newsletters</p>
<p>that you can immediate download</p>
<p>without even having to sign up.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following us on social media,</p>
<p>we are Huberman Lab on Twitter,</p>
<p>Huberman Lab on Instagram, and Huberman Lab on Facebook.</p>
<p>And at all of those locations,</p>
<p>I describe science and science-related tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>much of which is distinct from the content</p>
<p>covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>So once again, I&rsquo;d like to thank you for joining me today</p>
<p>for a discussion about the biology</p>
<p>and psychological effects of nicotine,</p>
<p>this incredibly powerful substance.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
