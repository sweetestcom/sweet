    <p>Our card this week is Jennifer Wilson, the Nine of Diamonds from Kansas.</p>
<p>In 2002, 29-year-old Jennifer vanished without a trace</p>
<p>after getting into a heated argument with her living girlfriend.</p>
<p>For over two decades, Jennifer&rsquo;s disappearance has puzzled the community.</p>
<p>Because even though investigators think they know who&rsquo;s responsible,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve struggled to come up with the answers</p>
<p>to the two remaining questions in her case.</p>
<p>What happened, and where is Jennifer?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was just after 6 p.m. on March 29, 2004,</p>
<p>when the Sedgwick County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office got a call from a distressed mother.</p>
<p>Her name was Paulette Mattingly,</p>
<p>and she said that her daughter was missing.</p>
<p>Paulette said she hadn&rsquo;t seen or heard from her daughter Jennifer in 18 months.</p>
<p>Now, Jennifer was a full-on adult.</p>
<p>In fact, her 31st birthday was just days away.</p>
<p>And Paulette said that even though they lived in the same county,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t really communicate a ton.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like the two of them had a strained relationship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that life was busy,</p>
<p>and on top of that,</p>
<p>they worked conflicting shifts.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t unusual for them to go months without talking.</p>
<p>But over a year,</p>
<p>Paulette thought that was a bit much.</p>
<p>And there was something else adding to her worry.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t get a hold of Brenda.</p>
<p>And I called her, and she would never return my calls.</p>
<p>Brenda Leonard was Jennifer&rsquo;s longtime girlfriend.</p>
<p>Paulette told the deputy this was strange</p>
<p>because she and Brenda used to be in pretty regular contact.</p>
<p>They actually started keeping in touch</p>
<p>around the time that Paulette last saw her daughter.</p>
<p>It all started in September of 2002,</p>
<p>when Brenda showed up at Paulette&rsquo;s house in tears.</p>
<p>Brenda came over,</p>
<p>and she told me, crying,</p>
<p>that she had an argument with Jennifer,</p>
<p>and Jennifer and her, they got really upset.</p>
<p>And so she just left in the car for a while.</p>
<p>And when she came back, Jennifer was gone.</p>
<p>Well, I could understand them getting mad enough</p>
<p>to just want to get away from each other for a while.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>I believed everything Brenda told me.</p>
<p>She cried and carried on and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And then she would come back a couple of days later</p>
<p>and see if I&rsquo;d heard from Jennifer.</p>
<p>Well, I hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Brenda also mentioned that Jennifer had left behind</p>
<p>her beloved German shepherd named Sadie,</p>
<p>and Paulette knew how much that dog meant to her daughter.</p>
<p>There was no way she would abandon Sadie forever,</p>
<p>no matter how mad she was at Brenda.</p>
<p>So at the time, Paulette thought for sure</p>
<p>Jennifer would just pop back up again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>
<p>But Jennifer didn&rsquo;t pop back up.</p>
<p>Over the coming months,</p>
<p>Brenda would check in with Paulette</p>
<p>to see if she&rsquo;d heard from Jennifer,</p>
<p>and Paulette would check in with Brenda,</p>
<p>but neither of them ever did hear from her.</p>
<p>Brenda would also go over to Paulette&rsquo;s place</p>
<p>just to cry and talk about how much she missed Jennifer.</p>
<p>But as time went on,</p>
<p>Brenda&rsquo;s communication with Paulette grew less frequent.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d call for big things,</p>
<p>like to tell Paulette that Jennifer&rsquo;s dog, Sadie,</p>
<p>had been hit by a car and died.</p>
<p>But by August 2003,</p>
<p>Brenda&rsquo;s communication had stopped altogether.</p>
<p>Paulette said she grew worried.</p>
<p>So that fall, as sort of a last ditch effort,</p>
<p>she tried to contact Brenda</p>
<p>the only other way she could think of.</p>
<p>And so I called where she worked,</p>
<p>and they said, oh, she doesn&rsquo;t work here anymore.</p>
<p>I go, oh, and she didn&rsquo;t even tell me.</p>
<p>Paulette waited a few more months</p>
<p>hoping that Brenda would reach back out.</p>
<p>But by mid-March 2004, she was tired of waiting.</p>
<p>So she contacted a mutual friend of Brenda and Jennifer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>to see if she had heard anything</p>
<p>from either of them recently.</p>
<p>And what this woman said made Paulette&rsquo;s stomach drop.</p>
<p>The friend said that Brenda had been telling people</p>
<p>that Jennifer wasn&rsquo;t missing,</p>
<p>and that Paulette had actually told her</p>
<p>Jennifer moved to Kansas City.</p>
<p>Understandably, this gives Paulette a very bad feeling,</p>
<p>one that she couldn&rsquo;t shake.</p>
<p>So about a week later,</p>
<p>she decided that it was time to contact police.</p>
<p>Paulette told the deputy</p>
<p>that she knew something wasn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>And authorities had a bad feeling too.</p>
<p>And because they were already 18 months behind the ball,</p>
<p>they wasted no time jumping into a full-scale investigation.</p>
<p>And naturally, the first item on their checklist</p>
<p>was to find Brenda, which actually proved to be a challenge.</p>
<p>She was no longer living at the home</p>
<p>that she and Jennifer had once shared.</p>
<p>And she was no longer working at the then Angels nightclub</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;d been a bouncer for a long time.</p>
<p>It kind of seemed like she just dropped off</p>
<p>the face of the earth.</p>
<p>But investigators didn&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<p>As they were looking into Brenda, they got an idea.</p>
<p>She does dialysis.</p>
<p>She was doing it three times a week.</p>
<p>And I knew where she got her dialysis.</p>
<p>And they were there waiting for her when she came in for it.</p>
<p>Investigators got Brenda to agree to an interview.</p>
<p>And she came down to the station to answer their questions.</p>
<p>She told investigators that she and Jennifer</p>
<p>had gotten into a fight back in September, 2002.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t clarify what they were arguing about,</p>
<p>but Brenda said that she left the house</p>
<p>and drove around in Jennifer&rsquo;s car for a bit</p>
<p>just to cool off.</p>
<p>And when she came back, Jennifer was just gone.</p>
<p>Now Jennifer&rsquo;s stuff was all there,</p>
<p>like her clothing and again, her dog.</p>
<p>But Jennifer herself had vanished</p>
<p>and then just never returned.</p>
<p>Brenda made it seem like after that,</p>
<p>she just kind of continued on with life as normal.</p>
<p>Well, almost normal.</p>
<p>During the five hour long interview,</p>
<p>investigators somehow got it out of Brenda</p>
<p>that she had stolen Jennifer&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>She was actually using her social security number</p>
<p>to work at a new job</p>
<p>and get Jennifer&rsquo;s social security checks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like she knew Jennifer wouldn&rsquo;t be using</p>
<p>her social security number herself</p>
<p>or collecting her own checks.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&rsquo;t a big enough red flag on its own,</p>
<p>Brenda also got caught in a lie.</p>
<p>She told me that one thing had happened to Jennifer&rsquo;s dog</p>
<p>and she told the sheriff&rsquo;s department</p>
<p>a totally different thing.</p>
<p>And I had, the only reason that we know that that was a lie</p>
<p>is because one of them is a lie, one of them may be true.</p>
<p>Even on top of the social security thing,</p>
<p>this lie wasn&rsquo;t enough for police to prove</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;d done something to Jennifer</p>
<p>or even knew more than she was letting on.</p>
<p>But it certainly added to their suspicion</p>
<p>because if she was lying about that,</p>
<p>what else was she lying about?</p>
<p>Well, it was gonna be hard to find out.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s investigator Jeremy Knoll</p>
<p>with the Sedgwick County Sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Somebody knocked at the door during the interview</p>
<p>and the detective had to step out.</p>
<p>And when he came back in to continue the interview,</p>
<p>she basically said, I wanna talk to my attorney.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna talk to you anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, she didn&rsquo;t have to talk with police.</p>
<p>She had the right to remain silent</p>
<p>and the right to an attorney,</p>
<p>but her sudden refusal to cooperate left investigators</p>
<p>wondering why she stopped talking</p>
<p>and what she wasn&rsquo;t telling them.</p>
<p>I was told after they&rsquo;d talked to Brenda</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t believe she left on her own</p>
<p>and they thought something bad had happened.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t wanna believe it was that she was dead.</p>
<p>I did not wanna believe that.</p>
<p>Paulette thought there was a chance</p>
<p>Jennifer was still out there alive.</p>
<p>In fact, she had an idea of where she might be.</p>
<p>You see, Paulette had adopted Jennifer when she was a baby.</p>
<p>And for the past several years,</p>
<p>Jennifer had wanted to seek out and meet her birth family.</p>
<p>Paulette was always supportive of this,</p>
<p>but they had trouble tracking down her biological parents.</p>
<p>So Paulette thought maybe Jennifer had suddenly found them</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where she had disappeared to.</p>
<p>Maybe she was with her birth family, wherever they were.</p>
<p>So I did look for them.</p>
<p>And if I had known how easy it was,</p>
<p>I would have done it way sooner.</p>
<p>All I had to do, I knew her last name,</p>
<p>I knew the town where she was born,</p>
<p>and I looked online and I got the names and addresses</p>
<p>of everybody that lived in that little town</p>
<p>that had that last name.</p>
<p>And I wrote, I sent a letter to every one of them,</p>
<p>telling them what I was looking for and why.</p>
<p>And within four days,</p>
<p>I had three people call me all in one day,</p>
<p>her father, her grandmother, and her aunt.</p>
<p>Sadly though, Jennifer&rsquo;s birth family</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t seen or heard from her either.</p>
<p>Like Paulette, the sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>was also coming up empty with their investigation.</p>
<p>They had searched the house</p>
<p>Brenda and Jennifer lived in back in 2002,</p>
<p>but found nothing of value there.</p>
<p>I think it hurt us really a lot too</p>
<p>that we were so far behind the ball on this cold case</p>
<p>because when it was reported to us,</p>
<p>I think there had already been two other occupants</p>
<p>that had lived in that home.</p>
<p>So whatever evidence may have been there</p>
<p>was completely gone at the time that we actually got this.</p>
<p>With or without physical evidence though,</p>
<p>detectives were convinced something had happened to Jennifer</p>
<p>and that she didn&rsquo;t just up and leave on her own.</p>
<p>Police spent the following months</p>
<p>tracking down and interviewing people</p>
<p>who knew Jennifer and Brenda.</p>
<p>They wanted to know what their relationship was like</p>
<p>and what Brenda had been telling other people</p>
<p>about Jennifer&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>There were a couple of old acquaintances of theirs</p>
<p>that worked at the Angels at the time</p>
<p>that Jennifer and Brenda both worked there.</p>
<p>These acquaintances told detectives</p>
<p>they remembered the day Jennifer disappeared well</p>
<p>because there was an argument between her and Brenda</p>
<p>leading up to her disappearance that started at work.</p>
<p>Their fight was so loud and so disruptive</p>
<p>that both were sent home.</p>
<p>Now, nobody could recall exactly what day that was,</p>
<p>but they said after that,</p>
<p>Jennifer stopped coming into work.</p>
<p>Some of them said, you know,</p>
<p>that they found it odd that Jennifer just wasn&rsquo;t showing up</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;d ask Brenda,</p>
<p>hey, where&rsquo;s Jennifer?</p>
<p>And Brenda would say the same thing.</p>
<p>We had a fight, I came back home, Jennifer&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Jennifer&rsquo;s friends said she would have never left that dog.</p>
<p>She would have never left that dog at that house.</p>
<p>The fact that Jennifer left Sadie behind</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t the only thing making coworkers</p>
<p>and friends suspicious.</p>
<p>You see, over the years,</p>
<p>Brenda had sort of developed a reputation.</p>
<p>People would say that Brenda was very rough</p>
<p>around the edges, very gruff, tough.</p>
<p>I mean, she was a bouncer at the Gentleman&rsquo;s Club.</p>
<p>They said that she wore like combat boots all the time</p>
<p>and you just knew you didn&rsquo;t fuck with Brenda.</p>
<p>Friends also said Brenda was a jealous person</p>
<p>with serious anger issues.</p>
<p>One of her former partners had even filed a PFA,</p>
<p>or Protection From Abuse, against Brenda at one point.</p>
<p>After learning all of this,</p>
<p>police were more confident than ever</p>
<p>that Brenda was lying about what happened with Jennifer.</p>
<p>So by the time fall of 2005 rolled around,</p>
<p>investigators were ready to talk to Brenda again.</p>
<p>They asked her to sit down for a polygraph,</p>
<p>but this was right around the time</p>
<p>that Brenda was being prosecuted</p>
<p>for illegally using Jennifer&rsquo;s social security number.</p>
<p>So by this point, she had lawyered up.</p>
<p>And her lawyer, in no uncertain terms,</p>
<p>told investigators his client wasn&rsquo;t willing to play ball.</p>
<p>After that, the investigation slowed to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>Investigators didn&rsquo;t have a shred of physical evidence</p>
<p>and the one person they were confident held the answers</p>
<p>to their questions refused to talk.</p>
<p>Over the coming months and years,</p>
<p>police returned to Brenda and Jennifer&rsquo;s old property</p>
<p>a few times with cadaver dogs, but nothing turned up</p>
<p>and the case remained pretty much motionless.</p>
<p>In June, 2013, more than a decade</p>
<p>after Paulette had last seen Jennifer,</p>
<p>Paulette had her daughter legally declared dead.</p>
<p>She told the Wichita Eagle</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t a decision she took lightly</p>
<p>because she was initially so hopeful</p>
<p>that Jennifer was out there somewhere.</p>
<p>But as the years passed with no sign of her,</p>
<p>she knew the likelihood of that was dwindling</p>
<p>and she was forced to accept the fact</p>
<p>that her daughter was never coming home.</p>
<p>Paulette missed so much about Jennifer,</p>
<p>the way she would randomly write her letters</p>
<p>or love on any animal that she found</p>
<p>or light up a room with one of her jokes or pranks.</p>
<p>Paulette would often think back</p>
<p>to one of her favorite memories of an elaborate prank</p>
<p>that Jennifer pulled on her friends back in high school.</p>
<p>Jennifer was setting up a deal to have people,</p>
<p>she was interviewing them,</p>
<p>but when she played it back, she played different questions</p>
<p>and so she was getting them to answer one way,</p>
<p>which would make sense,</p>
<p>but then when she put in her own voices later,</p>
<p>it made them look really stupid.</p>
<p>So those are the kind of things</p>
<p>she would do with her friends, you know, laughing,</p>
<p>but they had a great time that night.</p>
<p>They set up all sorts of little gimmicks</p>
<p>where they would catch each other in a embarrassing,</p>
<p>hopefully embarrassing.</p>
<p>It was memories like that Paulette clung to</p>
<p>as the investigation fizzled</p>
<p>and she began to lose hope that she&rsquo;d ever know</p>
<p>what happened to her daughter.</p>
<p>But then in 2014, the Sedgwick County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>dove headfirst into a cold case initiative.</p>
<p>They dusted off Jennifer&rsquo;s file and poured over it</p>
<p>with fresh eyes,</p>
<p>seeing if there was any more that they could do</p>
<p>or if there was anything missed</p>
<p>in the initial investigation.</p>
<p>And they decided, yes, there still was plenty they could do.</p>
<p>I mean, for starters, no one from their team</p>
<p>had even spoken to Brenda in 10 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long time for a guilty conscience</p>
<p>to eat away at someone.</p>
<p>So in 2016, they tracked her down</p>
<p>and went to have an informal conversation with her.</p>
<p>Two of our detectives went to the house</p>
<p>and just kind of talked to her.</p>
<p>You know, hey, we wanted to talk to you about Jennifer.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t there very long.</p>
<p>One of the detectives used the word</p>
<p>s*** or crap or something.</p>
<p>And she said, oh, I&rsquo;m offended by your language, get out.</p>
<p>After being kicked out by Brenda,</p>
<p>investigators knew that they were gonna have a hard time</p>
<p>getting her to talk anymore.</p>
<p>So they started to shake the tree a bit.</p>
<p>So we started interviewing a bunch of her close friends.</p>
<p>And what was really interesting about that</p>
<p>was most of her close friends had heard of Jennifer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d heard the name,</p>
<p>but each group of friends was told a different story</p>
<p>about where Jennifer was.</p>
<p>That A, she disappeared.</p>
<p>B, Brenda said, I saw her up in Kansas City a few years ago.</p>
<p>Another story was that, oh yeah,</p>
<p>I just talked to her a few years ago.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s up in Northeast Kansas somewhere.</p>
<p>Other friends said Brenda told them</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d talked to Jennifer pretty recently.</p>
<p>It was clear that she was telling different people</p>
<p>different things.</p>
<p>While it was certainly helpful to learn about Brenda&rsquo;s lies,</p>
<p>they already knew she was a liar.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t helping.</p>
<p>But when one door closes, a window opens,</p>
<p>or maybe you pry open the door, whatever you need to do.</p>
<p>Either way, there was someone close to Brenda</p>
<p>that they really hadn&rsquo;t talked to before now.</p>
<p>And they thought that person</p>
<p>might have some important info.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Brenda&rsquo;s nephew, who we&rsquo;re gonna call Dominic.</p>
<p>Detectives knew that Brenda was super close to Dominic.</p>
<p>They knew Brenda and Jennifer</p>
<p>had practically raised Dominic&rsquo;s stepson.</p>
<p>So if Brenda had actually done something to Jennifer,</p>
<p>Dominic had to know something,</p>
<p>or maybe he even had a hand in helping her.</p>
<p>Investigators started trying to track him down,</p>
<p>but that proved to be much harder a task than they thought.</p>
<p>At one point, they were sure that they&rsquo;d found him</p>
<p>in a prison in Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>I mean, the inmate at the prison</p>
<p>had the same name and same birthdate as Dominic,</p>
<p>so investigators flew out to interview him.</p>
<p>But when they started talking to this guy,</p>
<p>they realized this wasn&rsquo;t the Dominic</p>
<p>that they were looking for.</p>
<p>The inmate was from Texas,</p>
<p>said he&rsquo;d never been anywhere but Texas,</p>
<p>and his entire criminal history was in Texas.</p>
<p>He clearly wasn&rsquo;t Brenda&rsquo;s nephew.</p>
<p>It took a bit more sleuthing,</p>
<p>but eventually detectives did find the right Dominic.</p>
<p>We started actually doing some surveillance on him,</p>
<p>just watching him.</p>
<p>We eventually asked him to come in for an interview</p>
<p>because we started to gather some information about him.</p>
<p>So we called him in for an interview a couple of times.</p>
<p>And each time, he was just a little standoffish.</p>
<p>You could tell he was being deceptive</p>
<p>in some of his questions.</p>
<p>So we did what&rsquo;s called a geographic polygraph.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never heard of it until this.</p>
<p>So what we did was a polygraphist from the KBI came down,</p>
<p>and we set up the interview room</p>
<p>with the polygraphist at his table and his machine.</p>
<p>And on the wall was a big map of the property.</p>
<p>And the property was sectioned off</p>
<p>into, I think, five different sections.</p>
<p>And just, you know, I&rsquo;m not gonna put words in his mouth,</p>
<p>but to summarize what he did was basically he said,</p>
<p>you know, okay, did something happen</p>
<p>to Jennifer in Quadrant A?</p>
<p>Did anything happen to Jennifer in Quadrant B?</p>
<p>You know, did you have anything to do</p>
<p>with Jennifer&rsquo;s disappearance in Quadrant A?</p>
<p>And, you know, questions like that.</p>
<p>We have a picture of the map</p>
<p>that the Kansas Bureau of Investigation</p>
<p>used in this interview.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the blog post for this episode.</p>
<p>You can find that at thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>To give you a bit of context,</p>
<p>the property Jennifer and Brenda lived at in 2002 was massive.</p>
<p>There was a house, a barn, a big fenced-in pasture,</p>
<p>and this huge field.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re talking five acres in total.</p>
<p>Although Dominic claimed to know nothing</p>
<p>about something happening to Jennifer on that property,</p>
<p>the polygraph indicated deception</p>
<p>on Dominic&rsquo;s response to Quadrant B.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the quadrant of the map with the barn in it.</p>
<p>So armed with a failed polygraph,</p>
<p>detectives swooped in and began questioning him,</p>
<p>but he wouldn&rsquo;t break</p>
<p>and he wouldn&rsquo;t admit to knowing anything.</p>
<p>And because police had nothing to hold him on,</p>
<p>they had to let him go once the interview was done.</p>
<p>Detectives did later go and search that area</p>
<p>of the property with cadaver dogs,</p>
<p>but Investigator Knoll said that they didn&rsquo;t find anything.</p>
<p>After that, there was another lull in the investigation.</p>
<p>But this time, the standstill would only last two years</p>
<p>because in 2018,</p>
<p>the Cedric County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office got a call.</p>
<p>So we had somebody come forward and say,</p>
<p>hey, got information on this cold case,</p>
<p>and the information seemed very credible.</p>
<p>Making the tip even more credible</p>
<p>was the fact that the story this tipster told</p>
<p>was one investigators had heard before.</p>
<p>One of the stories that came out was</p>
<p>they believed that Jennifer may have been buried</p>
<p>below the deck, the back deck of the house.</p>
<p>And that was just a hunch that people had.</p>
<p>But as we heard that hunch,</p>
<p>then we heard other people saying,</p>
<p>oh yeah, I remember, you know,</p>
<p>the deck was being worked on on the back of the house.</p>
<p>Okay, well, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Why were they working on the deck?</p>
<p>Well, it was just old and falling apart.</p>
<p>And there were a bunch of boards</p>
<p>just pulled out of the middle of the deck.</p>
<p>I remember that.</p>
<p>And I remember a pile of new lumber sitting on the side.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think Brenda&rsquo;s nephew came over</p>
<p>and helped her rebuild the deck.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s all interesting little pieces of information.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when a gentleman came forward</p>
<p>and he said, hey, I&rsquo;ve got this information</p>
<p>that I heard it directly from this person</p>
<p>who said he helped bury a body under this deck.</p>
<p>So it was good info.</p>
<p>Investigator Knoll wouldn&rsquo;t say for sure</p>
<p>if the person this guy implicated was Dominic,</p>
<p>but he did confirm the person the guy named was,</p>
<p>quote, closely related to the suspect.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the back deck of the house</p>
<p>was in a different quadrant of the map</p>
<p>than the area where Dominic showed deception</p>
<p>during the polygraph in 2016.</p>
<p>But at this point, investigators had heard the deck story</p>
<p>from so many different people,</p>
<p>they figured there had to be some validity to it.</p>
<p>And I keep thinking, who&rsquo;s to say they&rsquo;re both not true?</p>
<p>Maybe something happened in quadrant B,</p>
<p>but then her body was hidden</p>
<p>in whatever quadrant the deck was in.</p>
<p>Or option C, polygraphs don&rsquo;t mean much.</p>
<p>Either way, detectives got a search warrant for the house</p>
<p>and they got the homeowners permission</p>
<p>to do a thorough search</p>
<p>that involved completely destroying the deck.</p>
<p>Once they demolished it, they dug and they dug.</p>
<p>But after about six feet of digging, investigators gave up.</p>
<p>They found nothing.</p>
<p>We asked investigator Noel why they called it quits</p>
<p>after digging that far,</p>
<p>and he said that they figured there was no chance</p>
<p>Brenda or Brenda plus another person</p>
<p>would have dug more than six feet,</p>
<p>especially under a deck to bury a body.</p>
<p>Even though they didn&rsquo;t find anything by digging that day,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t leave the property empty-handed.</p>
<p>It was in this search</p>
<p>where they removed the back sliding glass door</p>
<p>from the home.</p>
<p>They found traces of what they believed to be blood</p>
<p>on the bottom of the door.</p>
<p>Investigators collected what they could of the substance,</p>
<p>sent it off for testing,</p>
<p>and waited for the results with their fingers crossed.</p>
<p>If they could prove it was Jennifer&rsquo;s blood,</p>
<p>that would be huge for the investigation.</p>
<p>I mean, it would be the icing on the cake</p>
<p>for a case against Brenda.</p>
<p>It took months to get the results back,</p>
<p>and when they did, it wasn&rsquo;t what anyone was hoping for.</p>
<p>The lab said that the sample was too small.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t even find a partial DNA profile,</p>
<p>let alone a full one,</p>
<p>which meant that it couldn&rsquo;t be matched to Jennifer.</p>
<p>In fact, the sample was so small</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t even 100% prove it was blood.</p>
<p>With the dead-end deck tip</p>
<p>and some disappointing lab results in the rearview mirror,</p>
<p>investigators decided to look</p>
<p>into another potential lead uncovered</p>
<p>during their rounds of interviews.</p>
<p>And this one was another story</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;d heard repeated a few times.</p>
<p>So in all these interviews,</p>
<p>we heard it in two or three different interviews</p>
<p>that, oh, we heard Jennifer&rsquo;s body was taken to a pig farm</p>
<p>and then, you know, devoured by the pigs at the farm.</p>
<p>And then in one of those interviews,</p>
<p>somebody talked about this pig farm</p>
<p>because I guess it was kind of a party area.</p>
<p>And they would go back here and just drink,</p>
<p>you know, bonfire, whatever, just have a good time.</p>
<p>Investigators looked into the pig farm,</p>
<p>which, from Brenda and Jennifer&rsquo;s old home,</p>
<p>was about 27 miles away.</p>
<p>And this farm was pretty expansive.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re talking something like 20 acres.</p>
<p>So they knew it would be a massive,</p>
<p>all-hands-on-deck search to scour the entire property.</p>
<p>Still, they felt strongly enough</p>
<p>that Jennifer&rsquo;s body might be there</p>
<p>that they wanted to give it a go.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t get beyond the planning process.</p>
<p>When we talked with folks that have the cadaver dogs</p>
<p>about going out here, they said no.</p>
<p>They either couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t run the dogs</p>
<p>at this old pig farm</p>
<p>because, basically, they&rsquo;re just gonna alert</p>
<p>to the entire place.</p>
<p>Yeah, the cadaver dogs would just alert to the entire place.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because of the years of pig feces,</p>
<p>dead pigs, X, Y, and Z.</p>
<p>They were also concerned about just whatever hazards</p>
<p>may be out there for their dogs.</p>
<p>And then, you know, talking with some people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that pigs would devour bones and all.</p>
<p>There would be, if you put a body in there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be gone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna eat every bit of it.</p>
<p>Without cadaver dogs,</p>
<p>searching the property would have been virtually impossible.</p>
<p>So investigators were back to square one</p>
<p>with their once long list of potential leads now dwindling.</p>
<p>What wasn&rsquo;t dwindling was detectives&rsquo; suspicion</p>
<p>that Brenda was involved in Jennifer&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>So they decided to have a chat</p>
<p>with the district attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>It was kind of just an informal conversation</p>
<p>is what we ended up having,</p>
<p>where a bodiless homicide,</p>
<p>trying to prosecute that is very difficult,</p>
<p>I think, in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>And I was the one,</p>
<p>I was really screaming from the rooftops, you know,</p>
<p>that look at all the circumstantial we have.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s all circumstantial, but good Lord,</p>
<p>how much more circumstantial can you throw together?</p>
<p>Throw this in front of a jury and let them hag it out,</p>
<p>you know, let them look at it and see what they think.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I know that probable cause and, you know, people&rsquo;s freedoms,</p>
<p>and I take that very seriously.</p>
<p>The conclusion the DA&rsquo;s office came to</p>
<p>was that there wasn&rsquo;t enough evidence yet to prosecute.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d need either a body or more circumstantial evidence</p>
<p>to have a strong case.</p>
<p>And I get it.</p>
<p>I understand where they&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>You know, trying to prosecute a bodiless homicide</p>
<p>is very difficult for them.</p>
<p>While the sheriff&rsquo;s office started looking for fresh ways</p>
<p>to uncover new evidence,</p>
<p>Paulette was also trying out new avenues</p>
<p>to get justice for her daughter.</p>
<p>In 2019, she began talking with a psychic.</p>
<p>The psychic told Paulette</p>
<p>that she knew where Jennifer&rsquo;s body was buried.</p>
<p>She said it was in a field,</p>
<p>somewhere you could look west and see the sunset,</p>
<p>somewhere close to a fence and near some trees.</p>
<p>Everything the psychic described matched the area</p>
<p>Paulette had long suspected her daughter was hidden,</p>
<p>that big open field behind Brenda and Jennifer&rsquo;s old house.</p>
<p>The psychic actually asked to visit the field,</p>
<p>so Paulette took her there.</p>
<p>And she had these rods for like,</p>
<p>you put in your itch for water,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve seen some of that,</p>
<p>and the rods are inside of a little tube.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not touching the rods with her hands.</p>
<p>And the wind was blowing horribly as it does in Kansas.</p>
<p>And it was blowing, let&rsquo;s see,</p>
<p>it was blowing towards the north, I guess,</p>
<p>out of the south.</p>
<p>And it was blowing the rods all the time,</p>
<p>they kept blowing that direction.</p>
<p>And she was walking, and when she hit this one spot,</p>
<p>those things started swinging and they stopped,</p>
<p>dead stopped and would not move.</p>
<p>And so we marked that area.</p>
<p>Paulette told investigators about the psychic&rsquo;s revelation,</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t long before detectives went back out</p>
<p>to the property to dig.</p>
<p>To everyone&rsquo;s disappointment, though,</p>
<p>they once again didn&rsquo;t find anything.</p>
<p>But Paulette still believes that her daughter</p>
<p>is out there in the field,</p>
<p>because even though they did lots of digging that day,</p>
<p>she said that they didn&rsquo;t dig in the exact spot</p>
<p>that the psychic marked.</p>
<p>She has helped other people find bodies.</p>
<p>So I know that, you know,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got some kind of skills and talents in that.</p>
<p>And so I keep thinking, you know,</p>
<p>maybe that is where she&rsquo;s buried.</p>
<p>Since that search in 2019,</p>
<p>there has been little public movement in Jennifer&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean law enforcement or Paulette</p>
<p>have stopped pushing for closure.</p>
<p>People talk about closure,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something I have not had the kind of closure</p>
<p>that you have when you go to a funeral.</p>
<p>And that has been hard to deal with,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t care,</p>
<p>because they never responded that way</p>
<p>like they would have at a funeral.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just because nobody really knew for sure when.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t even care about the justice anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>What I really want is being able to find her remains</p>
<p>and put them out in Western Kansas in the cemetery</p>
<p>where my grandparents are buried,</p>
<p>where my aunts and uncles are buried,</p>
<p>and where I&rsquo;m going to be buried right next to her.</p>
<p>That would be closure.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve thought about that a lot.</p>
<p>Paulette also thinks a lot about</p>
<p>what her daughter would be like now, 20 years later.</p>
<p>I miss her.</p>
<p>I miss her now that I&rsquo;m older,</p>
<p>that I feel like, you know,</p>
<p>our relationship would be so much different now.</p>
<p>She would be 49, yeah, 49.</p>
<p>So, yeah, we would have a totally different</p>
<p>kind of relationship now.</p>
<p>My daughter was not meant to die at 29 years old.</p>
<p>So, you just,</p>
<p>sometimes I just have to pull over and stop the car</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m driving.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m driving down</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s close to where she used to live,</p>
<p>or I have a memory of us being there</p>
<p>and doing something fun.</p>
<p>Then I have to stop.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office has far from given up hope</p>
<p>for solving Jennifer&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>In fact, investigator Knoll said</p>
<p>that they recently got a promising tip.</p>
<p>Now, he wouldn&rsquo;t elaborate on what that tip was</p>
<p>because he said they need to look into it more,</p>
<p>but he seemed excited about it.</p>
<p>Knoll also said that he doesn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>prosecuting a bodiless homicide is out of the question.</p>
<p>If the circumstantial evidence continues piling up,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t shy away from it.</p>
<p>He also said trying to talk to Brenda again</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t out of the question either.</p>
<p>They think she&rsquo;s living in Georgia now</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna try talking with her again sometime soon.</p>
<p>So, whether that recent tip leads to something</p>
<p>or they push to prosecute</p>
<p>with the pile of circumstantial evidence</p>
<p>that they already have,</p>
<p>the sheriff&rsquo;s office has a good feeling</p>
<p>that justice isn&rsquo;t too far out of their reach for this case.</p>
<p>We asked investigator Knoll</p>
<p>what he thinks truly happened to Jennifer</p>
<p>in September of 2002.</p>
<p>I think they had a fight, they had an argument.</p>
<p>Brenda is an overbearing, very powerful person physically.</p>
<p>Jennifer is not.</p>
<p>I think that they had an argument</p>
<p>and somehow Brenda killed her.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s up for debate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Brenda buried her herself,</p>
<p>asked for help to bury Jennifer,</p>
<p>took her somewhere else and buried her.</p>
<p>I think it was purposeful.</p>
<p>I believe that Brenda&rsquo;s jealous of a lot of things.</p>
<p>And I think that she&rsquo;s just jealous</p>
<p>of Jennifer being pretty, popular.</p>
<p>Other people liked her.</p>
<p>And I bet you that that was the motivator</p>
<p>for Brenda to kill her is, you know, argument,</p>
<p>something about some jealousy going on.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think at all that it was accidental.</p>
<p>I think if it was accidental,</p>
<p>we would have known that 20 years ago maybe.</p>
<p>I think completely intentionally she killed her.</p>
<p>I think the pig farm thing,</p>
<p>absolutely it&rsquo;s a viable thing, absolutely.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t see that as much as I see</p>
<p>Brenda burying her somewhere on that property.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I see more.</p>
<p>Especially, I mean, that&rsquo;s a rural area for the most part,</p>
<p>especially at dark, at dusk.</p>
<p>I mean, she could have drug her out into that pasture</p>
<p>and buried her and nobody been the wiser.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s my personal opinion.</p>
<p>Paulette told our reporting team</p>
<p>that she hopes this podcast falls on the right ears</p>
<p>because she knows people out there</p>
<p>hold the answers to what happened to her daughter.</p>
<p>Answers to the questions</p>
<p>that have led to countless sleepless nights.</p>
<p>The questions that she spent over two decades</p>
<p>trying to figure out.</p>
<p>So I just feel like there&rsquo;s somebody out there</p>
<p>that knows something they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that what they know is that important.</p>
<p>So any little tip is worth going</p>
<p>and talking to the sheriff&rsquo;s department.</p>
<p>And yeah, this wouldn&rsquo;t get emotional</p>
<p>because they think somebody knows something</p>
<p>and they need to help us.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s not let something slip,</p>
<p>that she said something that she knows more.</p>
<p>You know, somebody knows something too.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s other people that know things</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t realize that that clue plus another clue</p>
<p>put together might be just what</p>
<p>the sheriff&rsquo;s department needs</p>
<p>to find out where Jennifer&rsquo;s buried.</p>
<p>And another thing about this whole thing too</p>
<p>is that I prayed to God immediately</p>
<p>when I heard a lot of this.</p>
<p>I said, don&rsquo;t let me be angry.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never been angry at Brenda.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to see her.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to talk to her, but I don&rsquo;t feel any anger.</p>
<p>And I think that God blessed me with that prayer</p>
<p>because, you know, I grieve,</p>
<p>but I said, don&rsquo;t let me be angry</p>
<p>because I know that anger just eats me up.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t hurt Brenda.</p>
<p>And whoever did it, I&rsquo;m not angry at them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
<p>It happened.</p>
<p>Just let me have her back.</p>
<p>You know, let me know where she is.</p>
<p>Paulette and the rest of Jennifer&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>have waited over 20 years for answers.</p>
<p>Answers that maybe someone listening</p>
<p>to this podcast can provide.</p>
<p>If you know anything about the disappearance</p>
<p>of Jennifer Wilson between 2002 and 2004,</p>
<p>or if Brenda Leonard has ever talked to you</p>
<p>about Jennifer&rsquo;s disappearance,</p>
<p>please call the Sedgwick County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>at 316-660-3799.</p>
<p>Or you can email.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to put that email in our show notes.</p>
<p>Jennifer was in her late twenties when she went missing.</p>
<p>She was a white woman, about 5'7 and 115 pounds.</p>
<p>She had blue eyes and long, curly brown hair.</p>
<p>She wore contacts, had a broken front tooth</p>
<p>that was repaired, and had scars on her waistline</p>
<p>and under her chin.</p>
<p>She normally wore baseball caps and sweatshirts.</p>
<p>If Jennifer&rsquo;s still alive, she&rsquo;d be 49 years old today,</p>
<p>and she would possibly be going by the name Sydney.</p>
