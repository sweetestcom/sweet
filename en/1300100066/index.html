<p>why do people don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about masturbation and sex</p>
<p>like my mom</p>
<p>never talks</p>
<p>about madison you</p>
<p>know why because people have</p>
<p>to work when you have to work you have to work with</p>
<p>women and when you have to work with</p>
<p>women you&rsquo;re not supposed to be talking</p>
<p>about beating off in</p>
<p>front of someone&rsquo;s wife or someone&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>mom or whatever</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t talk like that you can&rsquo;t talk like you</p>
<p>would talk right here</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re working with a</p>
<p>bunch of people it&rsquo;s offensive well we live</p>
<p>in a different reality i mean as a comedian it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a complete league i go home</p>
<p>minnesota where i&rsquo;m from and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>completely warped i&rsquo;m like making like</p>

<p>i know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrible we live in such a</p>
<p>harsh world</p>
<p>i know but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also that most</p>
<p>people are so programmed to like you know try to be</p>
<p>polite and correct and not talk like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>the more you get used</p>
<p>to it the more it becomes normal it&rsquo;s our normal our</p>
<p>our offensive is when you know you go to someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and no one will swear</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like what kind of</p>
<p>weird conversations are we</p>
<p>gonna have i can&rsquo;t even say shit</p>
<p>if i say shit you gonna</p>
<p>freak out like we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get anything</p>
<p>done and it&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t have to talk about like</p>
<p>aids diarrhea or something</p>
<p>all the time you know what i mean but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if some people want to talk</p>
<p>about that they</p>
<p>should be able to</p>
<p>and they should</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s blood in diarrhea occasionally and</p>
<p>blood carries aids you can get aids diarrhea</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s informative</p>
<p>and immature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>worst ways to get diarrhea ever</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d you get it</p>
<p>oh no the worst ways to get aids ever rather</p>

<p>other day you can get aids from a tanning bed if</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s on your period</p>
<p>and then you sit down on that</p>
<p>blood and then</p>
<p>put what and you have an open</p>
<p>wound in your asshole yeah like a hemorrhoid and your</p>

<p>stuck in there</p>
<p>are squished</p>
<p>together like indian</p>
<p>style yeah is that does that work though i wonder</p>

<p>it works it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>28 days later</p>
<p>where if you</p>
<p>bleed on someone&rsquo;s eyeball</p>
<p>they fucking turn into aids</p>
<p>monkey zombie</p>
<p>or whatever the fuck</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s hard it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be hard to get aids it seems to be harder to get</p>
<p>there has to be a lot of depression</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy that you know it came</p>
<p>out i remember when it came out it was like the early</p>
<p>1980s it was a big</p>
<p>big public story</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>thinking oh my god like this is so</p>
<p>crazy eventually everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fuck everyone</p>
<p>and give everyone aids</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t stop people from fucking and</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s some disease that kills people when you fuck</p>

<p>world as we know it yeah no it&rsquo;s not</p>

<p>sudden it didn&rsquo;t happen that way</p>

<p>out i remember i was driving i was in revere</p>
<p>okay i was leaving the gym i was in my car with my</p>
<p>girlfriend and we were listening to the</p>
<p>radio and they were talking</p>
<p>about how magic johnson was like making some sort of a</p>
<p>press conference</p>
<p>to announce that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got aids that he&rsquo;s hiv positive</p>
<p>we were like holy shit</p>
<p>magic johnson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna die whoa</p>
<p>that was reality</p>
<p>i thought everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be dead we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be fucked</p>
<p>because now obviously men are getting it from</p>
<p>women and women are getting it from men</p>

<p>yeah he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>plump and like looks</p>
<p>vital he&rsquo;s killing it healthy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>strong skin</p>
<p>there was that one person that was the</p>
<p>first person that longs</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s not sagging and</p>
<p>everything he&rsquo;s not turning</p>
<p>into an old person</p>
<p>he looks like</p>
<p>firm and elastic he looks a lot he looks a fucking</p>
<p>weird shit with aids dude</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got awesome aids some yeah</p>
<p>did you hear that dope</p>
<p>did you hear</p>
<p>about that first guy that just got cured yeah</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stem cells yeah</p>
<p>fucking time well you know there&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>school of thought that it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>hiv and aids aren&rsquo;t real</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it and i&rsquo;m not even</p>
<p>gonna get into it but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy named dr</p>
<p>peter duesberg</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a biologist out of the</p>
<p>university of</p>
<p>california berkeley</p>
<p>and he says there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>connection between hiv and aids</p>
<p>he said that aids what aids is when people are jacked</p>
<p>he says it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of things he said it</p>
<p>could be drug use and a lot of people it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>lot of it&rsquo;s crystal meth and poppers and amyl nitrate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>other undiagnosed</p>
<p>things and what it is is just</p>
<p>crushing your</p>
<p>t cell count and</p>
<p>what he says</p>
<p>is that the reason why people test positive for hiv</p>
<p>is that hiv is a very weak</p>
<p>virus and it can only</p>
<p>exist in the</p>
<p>system of someone who&rsquo;s already been compromised</p>
<p>so instead of</p>
<p>you know that hiv</p>
<p>causes aids what he says is a symptom of the fact your</p>
<p>systems is jacked</p>
<p>right and the gay community like</p>
<p>they do a lot of crystal meth and poppers and shit yeah</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve heard as well</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t you know i don&rsquo;t pretend</p>
<p>that that makes</p>
<p>sense though it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense that the scientists</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have figured out that</p>
<p>hiv doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cause a huge</p>
<p>but do you really</p>
<p>think that they</p>
<p>would be that kind of a</p>
<p>cover up like</p>
<p>that mass of a</p>
<p>scale where</p>
<p>every scientist</p>
<p>that kind of studies it goes oh yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>they connected yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big yeah</p>
<p>i just bet it&rsquo;s a complicated</p>
<p>motherfucking</p>
<p>virus all i</p>
<p>know we just got</p>
<p>super lucky</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t got that shit</p>
<p>i got tasty loads i don&rsquo;t got it yet</p>
<p>okay oh okay i don&rsquo;t got it yet shit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll get it tonight</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>how about people that go looking for it man how</p>
<p>about bug chasers</p>
<p>oh god that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>scary thing man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that are on purpose</p>
<p>getting hiv</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on purpose letting dude</p>
<p>shoot loads into them they need</p>
<p>to do that is there a documentary on that i put that</p>
<p>would be an interesting documentary</p>
<p>yeah you should you</p>
<p>should super</p>
<p>that should be your next project with no pants</p>
<p>now that the austin videos out</p>
<p>and everybody if you go to</p>
<p>my youtube page</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s joe rogan</p>
<p>dot any t is my youtube page and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a new video</p>
<p>it says good</p>
<p>times in austin or something like that but brian just</p>
<p>just completed it it&rsquo;s a fucking masterpiece the</p>
<p>thing spectacular</p>
<p>a little austin</p>
<p>yeah a little austin and it&rsquo;s got the joey</p>
<p>diaz incident</p>
<p>on the alex</p>
<p>jones show which was the</p>
<p>greatest thing i&rsquo;ve ever seen on my time here on earth</p>
<p>it was fuck ufos landing</p>
<p>fuck all that i just</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>mean ufos are</p>
<p>gonna be that funny</p>
<p>you know that was better than anything i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>i never seen a</p>
<p>movie that made me</p>
<p>laugh that hard</p>
<p>i never seen anything that made me</p>
<p>laugh that hard that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never laughed harder in my life</p>
<p>one time i came close</p>
<p>brian callan</p>
<p>we were all</p>
<p>stoned in a</p>
<p>hotel room with</p>
<p>brian callan</p>
<p>was doing his jiu jitsu</p>
<p>gay rapist bit</p>
<p>he does this</p>
<p>portuguese accent like this</p>
<p>heavy brazilian accent we talks</p>
<p>about you know like</p>
<p>taking guys down and</p>
<p>mounting them and then</p>
<p>raping it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know dude that</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>on paper yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s hilarious i can</p>
<p>one of the funny you know</p>
<p>count i can already</p>
<p>visualize yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s brilliant the bit is brilliant</p>
<p>that was those</p>
<p>those are close</p>
<p>those are close</p>
<p>but i think joey diaz is</p>
<p>gonna take the cake because that was on</p>
<p>on the radio in front of</p>
<p>probably a million listeners people</p>
<p>watching it on the internet from now</p>
<p>until you know who knows when</p>
<p>the videos are everywhere</p>
<p>and it was goddamn hilarious and was</p>
<p>live he just totally hijacked that dude show to hijack</p>
<p>it but my favorite part</p>
<p>about it is like</p>
<p>the story is hilarious on its own</p>
<p>but then in that</p>
<p>context of hijacking a live show and telling it angrily</p>
<p>made it like another</p>
<p>level of funny dude but it</p>
<p>started out hilarious just</p>
<p>queue up his rant</p>
<p>on the alex</p>
<p>jones show queue up that part and play for people yeah</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy about the</p>
<p>whole video too is it starts off</p>
<p>with you saying the word retard on the</p>
<p>radio and how</p>
<p>they had to censor that</p>
<p>you know and then it goes to the extreme</p>
<p>of joey diaz</p>
<p>saying fucking fan</p>
<p>i told you after i stopped saying i said i was</p>
<p>gonna stop saying faggot</p>
<p>a guy emailed me and</p>
<p>asked me to stop saying</p>
<p>cocksucker as well and i&rsquo;m like okay we are getting</p>
<p>crazy yeah come on like we&rsquo;re getting crazy</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say retard look</p>
<p>retarded is been a way that we describe people that are</p>
<p>idiots forever</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>offensive you know what&rsquo;s offensive</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s offensive that you</p>
<p>think that some sort of</p>
<p>a word is gonna make any sort</p>
<p>of a difference yeah i know that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s offensive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous look</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m shitting on little kids that have</p>
<p>down syndrome children</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cruel and horrible that&rsquo;s not a nice</p>
<p>thing to do but right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about someone being a retard</p>
<p>you know what the fuck we&rsquo;re saying yeah no</p>
<p>people are fucking</p>
<p>stupid like what are you supposed to say you supposed</p>
<p>to say idiot and</p>
<p>idiots okay</p>
<p>yeah because then</p>
<p>i mean you could dissect</p>
<p>every fucking</p>
<p>well you know retard</p>
<p>originally was the</p>
<p>i think the medical</p>
<p>designation for it was</p>
<p>mongoloid idiot</p>
<p>that was like the way they used to describe him</p>
<p>so i mean that was</p>
<p>like that was like the real nomenclature you know and</p>
<p>retarded sounds way better than mongooid</p>
<p>idiot yeah could you imagine</p>
<p>what the fuck man mongooid is a funny word</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>whole midget</p>
<p>thing too though the</p>
<p>midget thing&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird cause you grew up</p>
<p>just calling a midget</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s little people yeah that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s why i call</p>
<p>midgets retards</p>
<p>i target midgets</p>
<p>and i call midgets faggots</p>
<p>retarded people faggots i just switch it up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the move man that&rsquo;s all you gotta</p>
<p>do alright here&rsquo;s the joey diaz audio</p>
<p>this is alex jones studio</p>
<p>oh this is just</p>
<p>the part of me describing it well it goes</p>

<p>music video with sandler</p>
<p>like ten years ago and joey</p>
<p>we used his ball sack in the video</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a song about shaving your pubic hair</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a clip of joey&rsquo;s balls like</p>

<p>fuck i just i trim my bush for some sure my best</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t remember i&rsquo;m so brand</p>
<p>i trimmed my bush or some shit</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t whatever does anybody ever say that at work</p>
<p>i had to film that</p>
<p>fat man on the toilet series</p>
<p>which was joey</p>
<p>diaz fat and naked on a toilet</p>
<p>and the whole idea was</p>
<p>gonna be made for cell phones where</p>
<p>we filmed him on the toilet giving advice like traffic</p>
<p>horoscope weather news and</p>
<p>stuff like that and i had to be in this little</p>
<p>bathroom with like a</p>
<p>video recorder</p>
<p>by myself it was a hot</p>
<p>la day and it was just him fucking</p>
<p>naked and he would</p>
<p>stand be like oh</p>
<p>just balls hanging everywhere</p>
<p>and it was like</p>
<p>humid in the bathroom and he would just</p>
<p>start ranting</p>
<p>about shit yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing written</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>and i remember it was at this</p>
<p>in this pool house of</p>
<p>a friend of</p>
<p>one of the guys</p>
<p>that worked on fear factor something like that</p>
<p>david herwoods yeah and</p>
<p>like his girl</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know no i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>he was the director of</p>
<p>something like that yeah</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>wife came in and was like i brought you guys</p>
<p>lemonade i&rsquo;m like this is fucking creepy</p>
<p>this is like</p>
<p>one of my first years</p>
<p>out in la and i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m doing porn this is how i</p>
<p>start doing corn</p>
<p>right i have some</p>
<p>lemonade but</p>
<p>does all cost did</p>
<p>joey take a shit</p>
<p>no he just sat there the</p>
<p>whole time oh</p>
<p>god if he did and then i</p>
<p>started giving like props</p>
<p>joey diaz doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll throw up he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fit</p>
<p>on toilets correctly</p>
<p>yeah so he leaves these</p>
<p>these survivors</p>
<p>that have like</p>
<p>crashed the ship and then</p>
<p>crawling up onto the beach the best feature</p>
<p>drive joey shits</p>
<p>he leaves you in the bathroom all the time especially</p>
<p>in the humidity they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>climbing up and trying to escape like crabs in a bucket</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>totally in the water like half submerged the</p>
<p>mirror was fog man i wrote i love you on it and</p>
<p>stuff like that because it was so</p>
<p>humid from his balls in there and the greatest part</p>
<p>the greatest part is</p>
<p>he stood up and his balls were hanging at least</p>
<p>12 inches or something like that and i kept on throwing</p>
<p>toilet paper rolls trying to hit it like a carnival</p>
<p>and at the very end i fucking hit it</p>
<p>oh my god it&rsquo;s in the video it&rsquo;s called joey diaz</p>
<p>fat man on the toilet or something like that on</p>
<p>his balls his balls</p>
<p>like they literally look like rocks in an old</p>
<p>ladies videos</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ridiculous</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ridiculous i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen balls so big in my life</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t even make sense</p>
<p>which brings me up to a very important point</p>
<p>check this out</p>
<p>my next door well i won&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>some people that i know</p>
<p>nice nice say</p>
<p>people that i</p>
<p>know they&rsquo;re very nice people this this gay couple they</p>
<p>they had a kid and they they</p>
<p>impregnated a woman</p>
<p>with their loads</p>
<p>and the way they did it was they put</p>
<p>their loads together</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>mixed it up so no way</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>squirted in it was just</p>
<p>a low grace</p>
<p>fall it was like and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re off</p>
<p>and it was just like hopefully it&rsquo;s my fucking shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>about that i mean it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>about that because it&rsquo;s kind of weird like</p>
<p>they really did they didn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>adopt a baby they created a baby with</p>
<p>their own genetics like they have a couple</p>
<p>somehow or another</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>figure out eventually whose baby it really is you know</p>
<p>especially if they get in</p>
<p>fights or something like that</p>
<p>the idea is</p>
<p>that somehow or another</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna figure out</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>these loads in there and it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna just have a race but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna have a race they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna murder each other</p>
<p>like a big percentage of the loads that you shoot</p>
<p>are just murderous</p>
<p>sperm killers</p>
<p>all they want to do is go kill</p>
<p>other sperm</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sent out there</p>
<p>to make sure</p>
<p>that the sperm that&rsquo;s already in the cooter</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get to the eggs</p>
<p>and so they attack</p>
<p>and they go</p>
<p>smash it and the more</p>
<p>promiscuous the women are</p>
<p>the more your body produces</p>
<p>more of these</p>
<p>crazy killer sperm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why ball size</p>
<p>is directly proportional</p>
<p>to female sluts in the community</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why gorillas have little balls</p>
<p>gorillas have little balls because female gorillas are</p>
<p>chill they&rsquo;re not whores</p>
<p>chimpanzees have</p>
<p>giant balls</p>
<p>because female chimps are fucking whores</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re whores they just want chimp dick all over town</p>
<p>and so these chimps have to force</p>
<p>those killer loads in there</p>
<p>so that their genetics can move on to attack the loads</p>
<p>so these guys</p>
<p>in creating this baby they really launched this sperm</p>
<p>fucking genocide</p>
<p>campaign where they just attacked each</p>
<p>other in a dish oh my god you know there&rsquo;s no harmony</p>
<p>in that there&rsquo;s no harmony in that you know</p>
<p>they should have like a</p>
<p>like see through</p>
<p>flashlights and then</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s all fuck</p>
<p>it and then i&rsquo;ll be like an ant farm will just</p>
<p>watch all the shit go down all the</p>
<p>fighting the</p>
<p>sperm fight well i wonder if you could</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so true right</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know wow if you were like you know like you had</p>
<p>a box and you can only well you don&rsquo;t want to see each</p>
<p>other while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shooting loads</p>
<p>but if you you had like something like</p>
<p>they had side</p>
<p>of the room</p>
<p>bluetooth like video</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a hole in the wall and the</p>
<p>flashlight is attached to the hole in the wall</p>
<p>right and you&rsquo;re in one room</p>
<p>fucking it and your friends in another room fucking it</p>
<p>and it falls into the center and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>catch tray and then it mixes them all together</p>
<p>under some super</p>
<p>powerful microscope and we</p>
<p>watch sperm wars</p>
<p>sperm wars if you imagine that</p>
<p>would be like let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>pitch let&rsquo;s just</p>

<p>for a show you could have a show</p>
<p>where you took celebrities</p>
<p>and you you shot their loads you know they do this you</p>
<p>know they don&rsquo;t have to actually do it</p>
<p>you know you just pretend they&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>and then you animate what&rsquo;s going on with their loads</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;d be sweet</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>dwayne the rock johnson</p>
<p>versus brock</p>
<p>lesnar get their loads together and battle it out</p>
<p>you could have like fucking daniel day lewis</p>
<p>versus fucking jeremy irons</p>

<p>jeremy clarkson who&rsquo;s the main host guy and</p>
<p>all three of the guys that are host</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all english</p>
<p>and because they&rsquo;re english because they have</p>

<p>gonna attract the wrong</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too much shiny and</p>
<p>these guys go oh i want that</p>

<p>diamond turtleneck and just be walking around and</p>
<p>cane sequence</p>
<p>no well the dumber the</p>
<p>environment</p>
<p>you know the more more diamonds you will use</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>your pretend</p>
<p>time by the way is fucking hilarious you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>have you seen his new show and kind of</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m guilty of not seeing it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>nick swartzen is attached it has my unequivocable</p>
<p>seal of approval</p>
<p>i love you notwithstanding i&rsquo;m sure i</p>
<p>would love it so filled</p>
<p>and fucked up</p>
<p>people either</p>
<p>love it or they hate it</p>
<p>i have people come up to the</p>
<p>fucking that</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>total correct</p>
<p>thing yeah that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think i love the cat in the</p>
<p>wheelchair that&rsquo;s one of my favorite favorites some</p>
<p>critic goes your show i have a</p>
<p>sketch up for people who don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already done but</p>
<p>at a critic goes</p>
<p>uh yeah i watch the next words</p>
<p>and show it&rsquo;s just the same old shit we&rsquo;ve seen before</p>
<p>literally my show is a</p>
<p>cat in a wheelchair that does cocaine like</p>
<p>yeah what a broken record that theme is</p>
<p>a cat in a fucking</p>
<p>wheelchair that does coke yeah</p>
<p>god been there done that</p>
<p>we have a huge problem</p>
<p>with really really mediocre people that are criticizing</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>really mediocre</p>
<p>writers really mean oh my god</p>
<p>this day and</p>
<p>age is fucking</p>
<p>crazy because</p>
<p>anybody can be a critic yeah i have to and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fucking retarded yeah</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>snarky enough and if you&rsquo;re shitty enough</p>
<p>about people</p>
<p>you know you can get really popular</p>
<p>a lot of these websites</p>
<p>they just keep at it</p>
<p>every day and they&rsquo;re shitty</p>
<p>and douchey to people and they get a lot of hits yeah</p>
<p>and so then everybody</p>
<p>starts thinking well that&rsquo;s all i</p>
<p>need to do to be a critic i just need to be a douchebag</p>
<p>and so critics equal</p>
<p>you just try to find</p>
<p>a way to shit on things</p>
<p>you know and your actual</p>
<p>assessment of what you like or don&rsquo;t like there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>real substance to any of it</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re a fucking moron</p>
<p>if you had anything to</p>
<p>contribute you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be a goddamn critic in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>who the hell</p>
<p>would want to be a critic if you&rsquo;re a creative person</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing to be an appreciator of art</p>
<p>and that appreciation leads you to be a critic</p>
<p>like i think like</p>
<p>roger ebert</p>
<p>i think that guy</p>
<p>truly appreciates the art of filmmaking i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s critics like that that are artists that like</p>
<p>he actually</p>
<p>appreciates what he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s like a really important meaningful</p>
<p>thing to him</p>
<p>but then on the flip side</p>
<p>i get annoyed by critics who like</p>
<p>will see movies that i do</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>roger ebert in</p>
<p>particular but guys who are like</p>
<p>highfalutin critics and they&rsquo;ll be like</p>
<p>yeah i saw bench warmers this is garbage it&rsquo;s like well</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not fucking for you you know what i mean like if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a big critic like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t review a</p>
<p>movie that you&rsquo;re obviously gonna find</p>
<p>flaws in the plot of like</p>
<p>what the fuck you know people that</p>
<p>are looking</p>
<p>silly movies they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to a fucking hot dog store</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking for some insane</p>
<p>seven course french dinner</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get it</p>
<p>stupid that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a hot dog and hot dogs are cool too you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get it dude</p>
<p>you know people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand man</p>
<p>yeah you go to fucking taco bell you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get fucking</p>
<p>salmon sashimi</p>
<p>it is what it is</p>
<p>smoke a joint go see</p>
<p>a giggle done</p>
<p>done laugh so done done</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s all you</p>
<p>gotta do and it&rsquo;s mostly</p>
<p>for kids so what the fuck&rsquo;s your problem man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about little league baseball you fucking</p>
<p>piece of shit</p>
<p>you motherfucker you</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>i got this theory</p>
<p>about critics though and</p>
<p>about all this</p>
<p>negativity on the internet</p>
<p>on the internet i think in some ways it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>because i think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>getting a little bit of snake venom</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>you know you get a little bit</p>
<p>here a little bit there and eventually become immune to</p>
<p>snake venom</p>
<p>whereas a lot of people who&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never experienced anything like criticism</p>
<p>on the internet from anonymous people just being</p>
<p>completely shitty</p>
<p>about you it&rsquo;s gnarly</p>
<p>gnarly and for a lot of people that have</p>
<p>never experienced it it&rsquo;s like a jolt for</p>
<p>their system</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;ve seen i&rsquo;ve met people that have gone through</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;ve got like some internet fame</p>
<p>or had some</p>
<p>things happen to them and you can tell</p>
<p>like when people have been shit on you can tell</p>
<p>when like a lot of</p>
<p>people have attacked them with hate mail it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>jolts their personality</p>
<p>yeah so a little</p>
<p>bit here and there from douchebags here and there</p>
<p>you just got to realize</p>
<p>eventually you come to this sort of a recognition that</p>
<p>the reason why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>communicating like that is not really necessarily</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really they responded that way to your product</p>
<p>a lot of the reason why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>communicating them that way is because they&rsquo;re a mess</p>
<p>right a mess is a</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>that creative they&rsquo;re not that special they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>angry all the time</p>
<p>their relationships probably don&rsquo;t work out very well</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re filled with</p>
<p>angst they don&rsquo;t know how to become</p>
<p>great they want something more than what they are</p>
<p>they want to be</p>
<p>treated as special even though they don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>actually do the work to become special they&rsquo;re cunts</p>
<p>right well it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>with stan it&rsquo;s like inevitable that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get fucking haters yeah</p>
<p>cause i can</p>
<p>stand up it&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>great show every you know like</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s when i</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>stand up and you get to that</p>
<p>thing where it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fucking bomb eventually have to</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>so i always tell people who wanted to</p>
<p>stand up like</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna it&rsquo;s fucking hard as shit and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fucking it&rsquo;s not fun yeah it&rsquo;s the hardest part</p>
<p>the hardest part is not doing well</p>
<p>this this like</p>
<p>when you do</p>
<p>joey diaz as a bass he said</p>
<p>stand up is the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the hardest easiest</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;ll ever do</p>
<p>right the hardest easiest</p>
<p>thing cause when it&rsquo;s easy it&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s hard it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>when you say</p>
<p>when you get like this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>awful it&rsquo;s brutal</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had that happen i&rsquo;ve had that happen</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve eaten shit several times in my life</p>
<p>where i was like</p>
<p>i felt like</p>
<p>like as low as a dog</p>
<p>dying it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>right there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awful dude i mean the</p>
<p>first time i got food off stage</p>
<p>i was like shell</p>
<p>shocked like my hands were shaking like</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t go on</p>
<p>stage for like a week dude in new york</p>
<p>it was fucking awful</p>
<p>yeah it can get you</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s scary and then</p>
<p>once you but you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing that</p>
<p>stand up like that negative</p>
<p>stand up is so painful it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>like if you wanted to look at it like as a</p>
<p>psychological</p>
<p>study it&rsquo;s a really intriguing topic</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on is</p>
<p>you are requiring so much attention</p>
<p>you are asking for so much energy and so much</p>
<p>focus on you</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>standing on a</p>
<p>stage with an amplified</p>
<p>voice and a spotlight on you</p>
<p>and this is like a big brash step to take</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re eating it out there and people paid</p>
<p>money to see you talk</p>
<p>the anger swells</p>
<p>up inside them they want you to know like this is not</p>
<p>entertaining yeah</p>
<p>you fuck you find</p>
<p>you feel those feelings you are failing at your job</p>
<p>you were given</p>
<p>a job and you&rsquo;re making everybody feel like shit to</p>
<p>bring us joy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing the fucking opposite</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re angry</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re fucking turning into a mob</p>
<p>yes and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fucking</p>
<p>fist you when he comes in</p>
<p>exact opposite man</p>
<p>have you ever seen a guy say something like</p>
<p>super offensive like</p>
<p>sometimes comics will say something</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re just trying to do is just trying to</p>
<p>come up with something funny and</p>
<p>a lot of it comes out</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;ve really thought about it</p>
<p>and a lot of</p>
<p>comics will</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll try to be like</p>
<p>super controversial</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll say like insulting shit</p>
<p>but just like the kramer nigger thing</p>
<p>like that like</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing</p>
<p>he fucked up he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>idiot obviously but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what was he</p>
<p>doing he was just taking chances he was just</p>
<p>seeing what&rsquo;s in the cylinders pulling</p>
<p>triggers he didn&rsquo;t know what he</p>
<p>was he had bullets and blanks</p>
<p>what do i got here i got a rocket i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>fucking panicking and</p>
<p>dying up here</p>
<p>and people were yelling at him that you suck you ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>funny look we have a nigger</p>
<p>well and then he&rsquo;s committed to it he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna go with this this is my new sketch</p>
<p>that by the way for people who wanted to stand up</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t push that</p>
<p>panic button</p>
<p>if you ever fucking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the wrong button the</p>
<p>one that kramer push was</p>
<p>right on one</p>
<p>run off stage</p>
<p>every other button</p>
<p>is right yeah</p>
<p>literally take a shit on the</p>
<p>stage pull your pants down</p>
<p>take a shit</p>
<p>throw it at someone like a fucking monkey</p>
<p>fucking not</p>
<p>do not drop</p>
<p>a fucking n</p>
<p>bomb on stage</p>
<p>oh yeah you</p>
<p>gotta be real careful with that one god and it was</p>
<p>funny cause then kramer</p>
<p>tried to do it with kramer mannerisms</p>
<p>where it was just like i don&rsquo;t know kramer</p>
<p>not working</p>
<p>he was doing a lot of</p>
<p>weird shit on</p>
<p>stage it was really strange</p>
<p>he was coming to the comedy</p>
<p>store a lot</p>
<p>and it was real weird</p>
<p>cause he didn&rsquo;t really like talk to anybody you know</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>kind of odd you know how he&rsquo;s hanging out and he</p>
<p>would do like</p>
<p>these weird</p>
<p>like pratt falls and sketches and</p>
<p>stuff on stage it was very strange i got into a</p>
<p>fight with him</p>
<p>did you really yeah about what</p>
<p>i want the improv one</p>
<p>night and i walked</p>
<p>in the showroom and it was like a pretty full crowd</p>
<p>and he was on</p>
<p>stage this is a week before</p>
<p>fucking and</p>
<p>extravaganza</p>
<p>happened so he&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>stage and he&rsquo;s melting</p>
<p>down melting the fuck like</p>
<p>talking about the war there was no jokes</p>
<p>and he just was like getting like dark and the</p>
<p>crowd was like</p>
<p>super uncomfortable</p>

<p>flashing the light</p>
<p>and he looks at the</p>
<p>light he looks over at the</p>
<p>booth he looks at me</p>
<p>and i just kept</p>
<p>flashing the</p>
<p>light and he fucking got off and we</p>
<p>after after a</p>
<p>minute and i</p>
<p>grabbed the mc</p>
<p>and i go bring me on</p>
<p>after him i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna go on</p>
<p>but i go bring me on</p>
<p>and they were like okay</p>

<p>stage he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>who the fuck give me the</p>
<p>light i go i gave you the fucking</p>
<p>light and i went on</p>
<p>stage and did a fucking half hour so the</p>
<p>crowd had a fucking good show you know what i mean like</p>

<p>and then a week</p>
<p>later he got</p>

<p>i saw him that</p>
<p>night that he went</p>
<p>to the end i don&rsquo;t know dude</p>
<p>you thought he was gacked up on something</p>
<p>you saw him at the comedy</p>
<p>store right</p>
<p>what happened is he went to the comedy</p>
<p>store first</p>
<p>before he went to the</p>
<p>laugh factory</p>
<p>and he brought this</p>
<p>friend of his and they were just</p>
<p>acting really</p>
<p>fucked up and then he went on</p>
<p>stage ate shit</p>
<p>and i was like telling</p>
<p>you i called you yeah i said something like dude</p>
<p>kramer michael richards was just here man you</p>
<p>should see he was fucked up and all this</p>
<p>other crap yeah you said he had a meltdown and then</p>
<p>brent ernst</p>
<p>drove from the</p>
<p>laugh factor the</p>
<p>comic store need to told the whole</p>
<p>story to everybody wow</p>
<p>and everybody was like well we thought that was</p>
<p>gonna be the end of it though we had no idea there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a video of it</p>
<p>he goes dude you know brenner it&rsquo;s goes in this fucking</p>
<p>whole story</p>
<p>about it like he&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>stage dropping the end bomb</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m freaking the fuck out he&rsquo;s calling</p>
<p>these guys not just</p>
<p>dropping him a</p>
<p>calling these guys</p>
<p>going look here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there are niggers</p>
<p>yeah pointing it was like whoa</p>
<p>and we were all</p>
<p>we were all</p>
<p>super baked too so it seems so surreal</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t seem real at all when you hear a</p>
<p>story like that you&rsquo;re like what kramer said this</p>
<p>kramer so the way</p>
<p>uhf is one of my favorite</p>
<p>movies yeah me too me too</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s jan</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t give a</p>
<p>shout out to uhf</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird when</p>
<p>those guys go from</p>
<p>being on a sitcom to not being on a sitcom anymore</p>
<p>and then trying to do</p>
<p>stand up which is</p>
<p>you go from this</p>
<p>world where</p>
<p>the fake producer laugh</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re doing a sitcom and you do</p>
<p>like run throughs</p>
<p>everyone laughs at</p>
<p>their own jokes so you&rsquo;re like mike</p>
<p>what kind of a can is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like everyone</p>
<p>laughs in the</p>
<p>background cause the producers want the network to</p>
<p>think that what you&rsquo;re saying is so hilarious</p>
<p>i guess it&rsquo;s so bad sometimes like when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing reshoots that it&rsquo;s actually distracting</p>
<p>like when you have to reshoot a</p>
<p>scene or something didn&rsquo;t work right</p>
<p>and so when they reshoot a</p>
<p>scene like they don&rsquo;t have an audience sometimes we</p>
<p>would do it like on</p>
<p>these radio till like two o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>and so you would do it and then you&rsquo;d hear</p>
<p>this gross fake</p>
<p>laugh from the producers are from the</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>so they go from that</p>
<p>world where like everybody laughs at</p>
<p>everything you say would you like another bagel mr</p>
<p>magic land yeah he&rsquo;s just living in this fucking</p>
<p>world where</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a goddamn king</p>
<p>you know you show up on the set and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a parking spot with your name on it</p>
<p>and everybody</p>
<p>stumbles over themselves to get you coffee and</p>
<p>would you like a</p>
<p>magazine what can we do for you sir i just</p>
<p>i just say it&rsquo;s so disrespectful you</p>
<p>know it was so disrespectful because it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>as a psychological yeah</p>
<p>yeah no no no</p>
<p>i hear you i just hate it when people do that shit</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i mean even like myself i took a year off from</p>
<p>stand up because i didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a new act that you know that i was</p>
<p>that i really was</p>
<p>happy with i&rsquo;m working on it</p>
<p>right now but it&rsquo;s like i</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t say that for</p>
<p>sixteen years i you know and i was like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna take time off</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>ready so for</p>
<p>motherfuckers to go on</p>
<p>stage and be like</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>famous i&rsquo;ll just go up and just</p>
<p>stand there and fucking yeah</p>
<p>i try to win it&rsquo;s like fuck you dude i</p>
<p>totally totally completely</p>
<p>agree with you and totally side with your</p>
<p>you know decision to like to pump the</p>
<p>crowd up and everything</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m looking at is a crazy</p>
<p>person i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s as simple as like here&rsquo;s a guy who</p>
<p>you know he just you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>like lack of attention like they need that fill that</p>
<p>void of like yeah he&rsquo;s broken i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a pathology there</p>
<p>i think with</p>
<p>quite a few actors there&rsquo;s a pathology and</p>
<p>the solution to this pathology</p>
<p>is attention massive massive doses of attention</p>
<p>i think a lot of people that are</p>
<p>famous are crazy</p>
<p>and the way to become</p>
<p>recognize the</p>
<p>way to get what they&rsquo;re looking for is just to be</p>
<p>extraordinary it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>right so look i am special</p>
<p>so whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>acting whether it&rsquo;s singing or whatever it is</p>
<p>they start out with a pathology</p>
<p>they start out with</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got a fucking</p>
<p>psychological disorder</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some wiring that&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s a huge percentage of people that are</p>
<p>famous right i</p>
<p>agree and i mean that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>brings on the drug</p>
<p>it so you know</p>
<p>which i don&rsquo;t partake</p>
<p>in never i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very prominent in the community i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard it too</p>
<p>i find it did you hear</p>
<p>about that it&rsquo;s not necessary</p>
<p>i smelled it</p>
<p>before yeah</p>
<p>which part the</p>
<p>hey did you</p>
<p>do you have any time to do</p>
<p>stand up right now</p>

<p>stuff on the fly or i&rsquo;ll just keep adding</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ll go up on</p>
<p>stage with a premise and then work it out</p>
<p>and then just find more</p>
<p>stuff in that premise you know do you</p>
<p>keep your whole act in your head or</p>
<p>do you have</p>
<p>things written</p>
<p>down i always</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s why i get so mad when people connect pot</p>
<p>with any of</p>
<p>those other drugs</p>
<p>because pot does the</p>
<p>exact it&rsquo;s so different</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t connect</p>
<p>it makes you</p>
<p>super paranoid you don&rsquo;t start</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s the exact opposite</p>
<p>it gets you</p>
<p>paranoid and makes you humble and it makes you</p>
<p>not wanna do all</p>
<p>those other drugs</p>
<p>cause you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna fucking die cause</p>
<p>you wanna hug your mom</p>
<p>cause you forgot to tell your lover</p>

<p>if i had to be sober for a year i</p>
<p>could you know what i mean it&rsquo;s not like i</p>
<p>would fucking</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the bottom line you are not</p>
<p>gonna live forever even if you eat fucking sprouts</p>
<p>everywhere literally</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna live forever it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>and booze is fun</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>partying with a</p>
<p>bunch of friends</p>
<p>and you do a few shots and everybody gets lifted</p>
<p>and you all</p>
<p>start laughing your fucking</p>
<p>asses off as long</p>
<p>as you with good</p>
<p>drunks yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not with people that</p>
<p>become assholes when they get drunk</p>
<p>which by the way there&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>study that just came out</p>
<p>today where</p>
<p>they linked a gene that was my</p>
<p>elbow oh jesus</p>
<p>no i didn&rsquo;t even flinch</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a hard man</p>
<p>anyway there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>study that came out that said that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a gene that they&rsquo;ve isolated that causes</p>
<p>violent behavior</p>
<p>in some men when they drink</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s actually a gene</p>
<p>oh really yeah like they</p>
<p>think that like you know</p>
<p>what dude we have friends you know we know people that</p>
<p>drink and just</p>
<p>become a totally different person right</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re saying like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason for this like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like certain people have certain genetics that</p>
<p>make them respond a certain way</p>

<p>sense booze is not for everybody</p>
<p>but nothing&rsquo;s for everybody</p>

<p>to hang out with</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just always around douchebags are always around</p>
<p>negative energy and it&rsquo;s so hard to have a good time</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so fucking</p>
<p>lucky man yeah it&rsquo;s usually like</p>
<p>i mean back in ohio and</p>
<p>stuff like that most of your friends</p>
<p>came from where you worked</p>
<p>and so like you were like i</p>
<p>would work at</p>
<p>a lot of restaurants so all my friends were like</p>
<p>other waiters and just people that needed a job and</p>
<p>go through so many friends so fast it was more like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dating</p>
<p>friends you know i know you</p>
<p>would like hang out with them and shit and go out with</p>
<p>after work and then some</p>

<p>crazy or something bad happens if</p>
<p>they steal the vcr from you</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>yeah you see people who are banging each</p>

<p>people working together waitresses and waiters are</p>
<p>always trying to see who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna hook up and</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s hilarious you know</p>
<p>so many people man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in unfortunate</p>
<p>situations where they can&rsquo;t find enough cool people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tricky</p>
<p>absolutely we got to</p>
<p>start a call</p>
<p>brian thinking</p>
<p>about this lately</p>
<p>and what kind of cult do you want</p>
<p>to reprogram people</p>
<p>isolation tanks</p>

<p>cause joey diaz always want to smoke weed in the car</p>
<p>yeah like dude we&rsquo;re gonna get pulled over we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>texas in the car</p>
<p>inks like weed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s california weed and they can</p>
<p>smell the difference it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy how you forget that like in ohio that was a</p>
<p>scary thing driving with weed or buying weed</p>
<p>and stuff i remember always being</p>
<p>a paranoia don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do it you can go to jail yeah now i go to</p>
<p>back home ohio and i&rsquo;m just like hey here&rsquo;s some weed</p>
<p>you have to join here</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that man they&rsquo;ll lock you up</p>
<p>they locked up willie nelson bro yeah</p>
<p>stop and think</p>
<p>about that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird when you</p>
<p>watch cops too like i was</p>
<p>watching cops the</p>
<p>other day and</p>
<p>it was police cops of</p>
<p>texas or whatever that show is called like female</p>
<p>dallas female cop</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a show it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like cops but with</p>
<p>these dallas female girls it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>real housewives</p>
<p>of atlanta mixed with cops</p>
<p>but anyways it&rsquo;s real though supposedly</p>
<p>and they were shaking down somebody</p>
<p>for having a little</p>
<p>bit of weed</p>
<p>do you understand you are driving with marijuana sir</p>
<p>200 like making it seem like it was this insane</p>
<p>drug you know and i was just wait a</p>
<p>second this is just weed</p>
<p>he had a little bit of weed</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird to me that</p>
<p>you know in most states</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they</p>
<p>treat weed that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re yelled upon</p>
<p>from the police officers and</p>
<p>stuff and out here well</p>
<p>we not always out</p>
<p>here man there&rsquo;s some dopey cops out here too i mean</p>
<p>most cops are really cool but there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like everybody else you know one douchebag</p>
<p>cop makes everybody</p>
<p>think cops are douchebags</p>
<p>cops aren&rsquo;t all douchebags most cops that i know</p>
<p>from i know him from</p>
<p>jiu jitsu and i know him from martial arts they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking nice guys man because the most that i know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a job man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to do the best they can at this fucking</p>
<p>crazy job but</p>
<p>every now and then</p>
<p>you run into a twat</p>
<p>and my friend</p>
<p>got pulled over</p>
<p>what happened was he</p>
<p>was in his car and</p>
<p>somehow or another someone saw like like</p>
<p>he like he had</p>
<p>a joint in his hand or something and the cop</p>
<p>like he didn&rsquo;t realize there was cops there and the cop</p>
<p>flashed him</p>
<p>and he was just putting it back into his car</p>
<p>and the cops said you know you know and</p>
<p>why do you have marijuana when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>operating a car and he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m not even smoking</p>
<p>it before i get in the car and they handcuffed him</p>
<p>the chick was yelling at him</p>
<p>well he turns out he was a medical marijuana patient</p>
<p>so it was really like his little</p>
<p>medicine i mean if you want to</p>
<p>pay attention to</p>
<p>state laws which the cops are supposed to do</p>
<p>right but this</p>
<p>chick was berating him and yelling at him</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like this is so</p>
<p>gross because i was</p>
<p>watching it because it was</p>
<p>right outside of jujutsu class</p>
<p>was when we were at the old legends and we would</p>
<p>leave there was like this</p>
<p>alleyway and you</p>
<p>would go down the</p>
<p>alleyway everybody</p>
<p>would walk towards</p>
<p>where the cars were parked</p>
<p>and there was a cop car there and i</p>
<p>guess this kid didn&rsquo;t see the cop car</p>
<p>but it was like listen is the way this</p>
<p>woman was talking</p>
<p>to him as if he had done something to her you know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what the law is</p>
<p>apparently you don&rsquo;t know what the law is</p>
<p>do you read what it says on this</p>
<p>piece of paper says do not operate</p>
<p>heavy machinery</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like in his face and shit and he&rsquo;s handcuffed</p>
<p>and it was so gross</p>
<p>i was like what are you talking</p>
<p>about first of all the guy&rsquo;s not high he</p>
<p>just told you he&rsquo;s getting he just got out of the gym</p>
<p>okay so he&rsquo;s got a joint in his hand</p>
<p>like what are you doing</p>
<p>like what exactly</p>
<p>and by the way</p>
<p>you can drive high</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>a lot of studies on it i don&rsquo;t recommend it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s for everybody</p>
<p>because a lot of people get fucking paranoid as</p>
<p>shit when they&rsquo;re driving</p>
<p>or when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stoned rather</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t concentrate</p>
<p>on anything and they see in</p>
<p>tunnel vision and they&rsquo;ll miss peripheral</p>
<p>shit i mean</p>
<p>maybe not the best</p>
<p>thing for everybody but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like driving</p>
<p>drunk you know</p>
<p>drunk is completely</p>
<p>awful i mean sometimes when you think</p>
<p>about how horrible like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m the worst</p>
<p>once in a while i&rsquo;ll let myself slip</p>
<p>where it gets to a point</p>
<p>where i do a shot i shouldn&rsquo;t have done or i had an</p>
<p>extra drink that i shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>catch myself</p>
<p>going man why</p>
<p>why am i you know</p>
<p>i have to drive now what the fuck</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>usually i try to find food</p>
<p>like on the way like you</p>
<p>know stop somewhere to eat</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>those times you know</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just like man i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna drive home i try this and</p>
<p>then the next day you&rsquo;re like why the fuck did i do</p>
<p>drive yourself to a diner don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat that&rsquo;s what i usually do take a cab to a diner</p>
<p>go fuel up i&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>often i&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s very very rare but</p>
<p>scary shit man</p>
<p>cause people who kill people in</p>
<p>drunk driving accidents and people</p>
<p>who get away with it are really doing the same thing</p>
<p>right just one person fucks up</p>
<p>and you know happens to be in the wrong</p>
<p>place at the</p>
<p>wrong time and the</p>
<p>other person just gets</p>
<p>lucky and doesn&rsquo;t hit anything on the way home</p>
<p>but a lot of that is just</p>
<p>just dumb luck man</p>
<p>scary shit man the idea that you can get that anywhere</p>
<p>i mean you can go to cvs and</p>
<p>drink enough alcohol to die that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy that it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy man cvs even sells</p>
<p>beer and it&rsquo;s like has the best deals on beer they sell</p>
<p>whiskey some</p>
<p>liquor and beer at cvs it seems like</p>
<p>cvs is supposed to help you yeah</p>
<p>and it makes no</p>
<p>sense that i</p>
<p>never would have thought that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy that the pharmacy</p>
<p>yeah yeah it&rsquo;s supposed to be like a hospital almost</p>
<p>you know with gum</p>
<p>right if you want anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make you feel better if you&rsquo;re sick</p>
<p>right dude i got some theraphilith theraflu</p>
<p>when i went to montreal</p>
<p>i got the flu when i came back i was i was fucking</p>
<p>wrecked for like</p>
<p>a full two days i was wrecked</p>
<p>where i was like</p>
<p>cold sweats</p>
<p>and shivers</p>
<p>like i was freezing i was</p>
<p>sweating like my</p>
<p>whole body was</p>
<p>sweating and i was shaking</p>
<p>and i was freezing and i was wearing</p>
<p>clothes to bed i was wearing</p>
<p>pants and jackets and hoods</p>
<p>terrible feeling</p>
<p>right terrible feeling</p>
<p>i drank some</p>
<p>theraflu boom</p>
<p>knocked it out of the park i mean</p>
<p>knocked it out of the park no chills</p>
<p>slept like a</p>
<p>baby really i don&rsquo;t know how much of it is a</p>
<p>theraflu and how much of it is my immune</p>
<p>system i eat really healthy my immune</p>
<p>system bounces back pretty quick</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>but i think it&rsquo;s the theraflu</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>theraflu just kind of masked</p>
<p>the feeling</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>same shit in there that you make meth out of</p>
<p>yep you can make meth out of theraflu</p>
<p>dude i know</p>
<p>mrs rogan had a sign for it</p>
<p>when she went and bought it for me</p>
<p>you have to show your id</p>
<p>really if dashash</p>
<p>buy only three</p>
<p>boxes of theraflu</p>
<p>you gotta show</p>
<p>your id and sign for that shit i didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s dope</p>
<p>theraflu is the shit i like that</p>
<p>shit i don&rsquo;t even know what it is and there&rsquo;s no way i</p>
<p>could even pronounce it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from like</p>
<p>germany or something</p>
<p>like that it&rsquo;s like a really long name like petrol oh</p>
<p>yeah you know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about and it&rsquo;s like you take ten of</p>
<p>these boy ron</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s acillial</p>
<p>sub in the yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like little</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>cash sugar beads</p>
<p>feels like i</p>
<p>think it might be bullshit</p>
<p>i did it once it worked it seemed like it</p>
<p>but again but then</p>
<p>again you don&rsquo;t know is</p>
<p>it working or is it</p>
<p>already sent me something the other day</p>
<p>that said that</p>
<p>some insane amount of people</p>
<p>that they give</p>
<p>that they give placebos to</p>
<p>the placebo effect</p>
<p>works even if you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s a placebo</p>
<p>apparently really i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how that works</p>
<p>but what ari</p>
<p>said was that they told people that they were</p>
<p>gonna give them a placebo</p>
<p>and even just telling them that they were</p>
<p>gonna give them a placebo</p>
<p>made them heal up</p>
<p>quicker than</p>
<p>people that they didn&rsquo;t tell well it&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>cause they didn&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>placebo means that it</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>something like skin cell</p>
<p>man they gave him some</p>
<p>placebo man</p>
<p>that that shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or legit you know</p>
<p>maybe they just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what it was i don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re saying is</p>
<p>well everyone is</p>
<p>aware of the placebo effect in medicine</p>
<p>where a person believes in</p>
<p>sugar pills he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taken is a real</p>
<p>medicine and sees improvement in symptoms</p>
<p>is it possible to experience the placebo</p>
<p>effect even if you know the</p>
<p>medicine isn&rsquo;t real according to one new study</p>
<p>and close one i don&rsquo;t know what that means</p>
<p>the answer is yes so it&rsquo;s interesting eighty</p>
<p>p eighty people they did it with</p>
<p>and it showed more people got better with the perceiver</p>
<p>the fuck knows</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing man that your brains got this</p>
<p>ability to heal itself that you can&rsquo;t really tap into</p>
<p>but if it thinks that you&rsquo;re getting some</p>
<p>medicine then it just fixes it</p>
<p>right what the fuck is that</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>your belief is so fucking</p>
<p>strong it&rsquo;s so important to believe in things man</p>
<p>so important</p>
<p>in a weird way</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a zone when you believe in</p>
<p>things and you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really like you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re confident and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tuned into him</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>power to that</p>
<p>and you know you</p>
<p>experience that man</p>
<p>experience that in</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>and experiencing that when you&rsquo;re playing pool</p>
<p>you experience</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t experience that in pool</p>
<p>but just because you don&rsquo;t get that good at it</p>
<p>when you get really good at pool</p>
<p>you experience</p>
<p>the zones where you believe in yourself</p>
<p>and the ball just you believe everything</p>
<p>everything goes well</p>
<p>but if you if you have</p>
<p>um a negative thought at all like you</p>
<p>could be aiming at the ball the perfect way you could</p>
<p>queue up you know your you got a good bridge your your</p>
<p>relaxing the way you&rsquo;re gripping it</p>
<p>everything you</p>
<p>strokes in line but if</p>
<p>right before you</p>
<p>shoot it you</p>
<p>start thinking i hope i don&rsquo;t miss this</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll miss it like</p>
<p>eight times out of ten</p>
<p>you know sometimes it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>bobble its way</p>
<p>in but you really were supposed to miss it</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing man it&rsquo;s like when you believe</p>
<p>it goes in it&rsquo;s so strange</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work if you don&rsquo;t know how to play</p>
<p>but once you</p>
<p>learn how to play</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one of the most important</p>
<p>things is that</p>
<p>not have a negative thought before you pull the</p>
<p>trigger before you shoot</p>
<p>they say that&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing with archery as well</p>
<p>you know that you have</p>
<p>to kind of like have this belief in what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t even if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>everything the</p>
<p>right way if you don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna hit it won&rsquo;t hit</p>
<p>do they still do archery and like elementary</p>
<p>school i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they try</p>
<p>these kids were posing</p>
<p>arrows isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>weird i was</p>
<p>thinking that the</p>
<p>other day i was like no i remember in elementary</p>
<p>school like</p>
<p>fifth grade</p>
<p>having arrows and bows and we had like these</p>
<p>like courses</p>
<p>that you go through and try to kind of like you</p>
<p>know a shooting</p>
<p>range where you&rsquo;d walk</p>
<p>through and just do archery</p>
<p>everywhere i remember</p>
<p>thinking like one time i</p>
<p>shot it straight up in the air i remember</p>
<p>how dumb that was because i didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think it out</p>
<p>my friends got famous</p>
<p>dude that shit</p>
<p>super dangerous yeah</p>
<p>when i was 12 i was in the boy scouts</p>
<p>and i went on a camp</p>
<p>i went to like a camp for two weeks</p>
<p>then we were</p>
<p>shooting guns man</p>
<p>we were shooting guns and you</p>
<p>would hear ricochets</p>
<p>like we were i was in the archery course and</p>
<p>this is one of the reasons why i decided to just quit</p>
<p>everything and go fishing</p>
<p>the whole time i was there all i did was go fishing</p>
<p>every day i quit everything</p>
<p>i was like fuck you</p>
<p>crazy assholes</p>
<p>because we were all</p>
<p>shooting archery and i heard</p>
<p>i was like what the fuck is that</p>
<p>and then someone one of the kids goes that&rsquo;s a ricochet</p>
<p>what do you mean i</p>
<p>ricochet someone just</p>
<p>shot and it probably hit a rock or something</p>
<p>get the fuck</p>
<p>out of here man we almost just got hit by a bullet</p>
<p>okay what is</p>
<p>going on here</p>
<p>and it was only a 22</p>
<p>so if it did hit you in a</p>
<p>ricochet it probably just</p>
<p>but it could hit your eye</p>
<p>you could get fucked up</p>
<p>so i was like</p>
<p>these crazy assholes i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna go fishing</p>
<p>every day so i</p>
<p>avoided all the</p>
<p>activities i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do anything i just went fishing</p>
<p>we would all get in line like</p>
<p>everybody get in line i just disappear into the woods</p>
<p>somebody could easily raped and killed me man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like no one was</p>
<p>watching us</p>
<p>for two weeks i was</p>
<p>alone in the woods of new hampshire</p>
<p>no one was watching anybody</p>
<p>these fucking counselors</p>
<p>who knows what kind of creepy shit they were into right</p>
<p>they always</p>
<p>had a few boys that they really liked the most</p>
<p>they hung out with them</p>
<p>and then everybody else</p>
<p>was just kind of like free like little wild animals</p>
<p>little 12 year olds with no cell</p>
<p>phones there&rsquo;s not even a</p>
<p>phone out there</p>
<p>period my parents had no way to contact me</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re out there</p>
<p>alone in the woods</p>
<p>with a bunch of fucking</p>
<p>street kids</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all kids from jamaica</p>
<p>plane which is like this really shitty area of boston</p>
<p>and so they were all like</p>
<p>fucking doing deviant shit the middle of the night like</p>
<p>taking kids out to the woods and</p>
<p>tying them to</p>
<p>their bed and leaving them in the woods and</p>
<p>covering them with</p>
<p>toothpaste while they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sleeping it was</p>
<p>like it was fucking creepy it was like being in like</p>
<p>like a juvenile detention center in the woods</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>weird google that i did the</p>
<p>other day that i was</p>
<p>googling to see what time</p>
<p>kmart was open to and somehow i ended up</p>
<p>on this website about this</p>
<p>kmart that&rsquo;s by my</p>
<p>house that a suspect</p>
<p>tried to murder</p>
<p>two police officers and shot two police officers</p>
<p>at kmart in burbank</p>
<p>which is like</p>
<p>who has violence there</p>
<p>but so anyways</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>i was so stoned i decided just</p>
<p>cause that was back in july and i</p>
<p>started to try to read up</p>
<p>and if you go online and read about this</p>
<p>just google</p>
<p>kmart shooting murder or police officer or whatever</p>
<p>it starts off</p>
<p>saying how this guy was like shoplifting and then</p>
<p>some security guards</p>
<p>were there trying to hold this guy down and then he</p>
<p>pulls out the office</p>
<p>grabs the officer&rsquo;s gun</p>
<p>while being handcuffed or something like that</p>
<p>but anyways what&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>about this is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s message</p>
<p>boards where the wife of this guy</p>
<p>is saying this is all bullshit this is</p>
<p>my husband&rsquo;s</p>
<p>none of this happened or something</p>
<p>weird i can&rsquo;t remember what it was but i was really big</p>
<p>but he has two kids</p>
<p>but have you noticed this</p>
<p>story never</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s no news</p>
<p>about it like he was supposed to go to</p>
<p>trial and stuff and now there&rsquo;s like this guy</p>
<p>just got vanished from like the news and from public</p>
<p>records and</p>
<p>stuff like well did you research it</p>
<p>i researched it for</p>
<p>about 10 15 minutes on google which</p>
<p>was you know</p>
<p>what does that mean</p>
<p>you type in there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no story it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean the guy vanish yeah</p>
<p>but its system is</p>
<p>bogged down</p>
<p>so many other cases if you&rsquo;re that</p>
<p>bored just start doing a little digging on this guy and</p>
<p>start going to some of</p>
<p>these message</p>
<p>boards that come up on google and it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>weird because</p>
<p>like the wife is involved with all</p>
<p>these message</p>
<p>boards and stuff really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of crazy</p>
<p>yeah that is kind of</p>
<p>crazy here&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>crazy thing</p>
<p>did you hear</p>
<p>about this guy</p>
<p>who got busted for hacking into his wife&rsquo;s email</p>
<p>apparently this dude</p>
<p>is married to his</p>
<p>chick and she&rsquo;s only thirty</p>
<p>three and she&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>married three times already</p>
<p>so you know this</p>
<p>bitch is crazy</p>
<p>right right and</p>
<p>apparently she was taking</p>
<p>their daughter</p>
<p>over to her ex husband&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house so she was</p>
<p>banging her</p>
<p>second husband</p>
<p>and taking his</p>
<p>daughter over to her</p>
<p>second husband&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and the</p>
<p>second husband used to beat the shit out of her</p>
<p>apparently so this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>his daughter</p>
<p>might be in danger</p>
<p>this guy beats the shit out of his wife</p>
<p>so he hacks into her</p>
<p>email to find out all this information</p>
<p>what does that mean i don&rsquo;t know i think</p>
<p>somehow or another he got her password</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hacking into it i mean it</p>
<p>might have been as simple as she left the shit on</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>on you know her google</p>
<p>password we</p>
<p>just let the monitor on</p>
<p>yeah who knows</p>
<p>what the fuck what the fuck really happened</p>
<p>right hacking</p>
<p>but anyway she gets into this and finds out</p>
<p>or he gets into this rather and finds out that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cheating so he</p>
<p>tries to get her</p>
<p>you know tries to get</p>
<p>child support</p>
<p>tries to get</p>
<p>custody rather</p>
<p>and she sues him for</p>
<p>attacking or hacking into her</p>
<p>email and this</p>
<p>motherfucker is</p>
<p>going to jail</p>
<p>wow yeah he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to jail for some violation of some sort of a law</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know exactly what the law is but it</p>
<p>has to be the gayest</p>
<p>sounding law ever it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>megan&rsquo;s law i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what the law yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i mean what is the law</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i mean if someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>emails there and you know if you find out</p>
<p>their password</p>
<p>you know and you find</p>
<p>out that they&rsquo;re doing some shit that&rsquo;s not cool yeah</p>
<p>especially when like</p>
<p>what is this like what&rsquo;s this hacking part because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s retarded if your</p>
<p>girlfriend uses</p>
<p>your laptop and she stays logged in and then you just</p>
<p>turn on your computer and go hey</p>
<p>her email&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there yeah</p>
<p>apparently is that</p>
<p>considered hacking</p>
<p>yeah right apparently</p>
<p>the prosecutors relied on</p>
<p>a michigan statute</p>
<p>that was previously used to prosecute</p>
<p>people who committed</p>
<p>identity theft or they</p>
<p>stole trade secrets</p>
<p>what is that like typewriter</p>
<p>ribbon you know like</p>
<p>no no no identity theft</p>
<p>online you know</p>
<p>the law was created to stop</p>
<p>identity theft online</p>
<p>right and so when they did that</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>entered into</p>
<p>this case they used that law</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s like disingenuous</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on this is a</p>
<p>married couple</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t someone</p>
<p>stealing someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>identity this is</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shitty it seems like that</p>
<p>would be a law that is like oh you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>married well sorry</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed to own this person if you really want to</p>
<p>how is reading an</p>
<p>email different</p>
<p>from reading a letter that&rsquo;s left around</p>
<p>right or a text message</p>
<p>right like if you find a box of letters on</p>
<p>your wife&rsquo;s bed and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know going to</p>
<p>visit some guy</p>
<p>at prison and sucking his dick and i like you like wow</p>
<p>abraham lincoln have to deal with this shit</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>especially like call it</p>
<p>identity theft</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t call it</p>
<p>identity theft if someone finds your diary</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s why people</p>
<p>wrote it in cursive so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like you know to confuse people and like hide</p>
<p>it he&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t want you to read my letters i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna make it hard for you to read</p>
<p>no brian they</p>
<p>wrote it in cursive because it&rsquo;s easier to</p>
<p>write cursive than it is to make each</p>
<p>individual letter see as they flow together</p>
<p>at the same</p>
<p>time i went</p>
<p>ahead did that open mic the</p>
<p>other day and</p>
<p>had to read the list of comics</p>
<p>to come up and</p>
<p>a few of them</p>
<p>still used cursive and it just</p>
<p>boggled my mind of like wait you&rsquo;re a straight male</p>
<p>right why don&rsquo;t you just</p>
<p>write some shit in aramaic</p>
<p>just put a bunch of</p>
<p>penises and draw your picture</p>
<p>yeah what is up with cursive</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>change my caps i use all</p>
<p>i use all uppercase</p>
<p>upper and lowercase what am i doing if i&rsquo;m writing you</p>
<p>something if i need to be</p>
<p>expressive in</p>
<p>something that i</p>
<p>write you know it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be a little letter</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m writing</p>
<p>something down if i&rsquo;m writing something down</p>
<p>99 9 of the time it&rsquo;s either for me or</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m filling out a custom</p>
<p>swarm because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m landing in canada or something like that</p>
<p>i just use all</p>
<p>capitals you know what the fuck i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>we should mention</p>
<p>that our podcast was picked in the top 10 of itunes</p>
<p>itunes chose like</p>
<p>top 10 audio podcast for</p>
<p>2010 and we&rsquo;re in there</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>gotta figure out something to do with this that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>profitable brian</p>
<p>you gotta figure out how to make</p>
<p>money with this podcast this</p>
<p>is ridiculous</p>
<p>right we gotta figure we</p>
<p>gotta figure out how to turn this into some sort of a</p>
<p>television show</p>
<p>well you know like companies like the c2o</p>
<p>water yeah c2o</p>
<p>water sent us a</p>
<p>bunch of water</p>
<p>free coconut</p>
<p>water thank you very much</p>
<p>and apparently</p>
<p>the other company yeah amy and</p>
<p>brian just contact me the other day</p>
<p>and they were like oh we want to send you some and</p>
<p>so now there</p>
<p>might be a coconut</p>
<p>water battle</p>
<p>are we should have like a</p>
<p>taste test live and like</p>
<p>both awesome</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>both awesome i buy both of them all the time coconut</p>
<p>water so good for you man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it tastes so good too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not too</p>
<p>sweet it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking soda</p>
<p>it feels super healthy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s naturally isotonic it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>naturally good at rehydrating you i have a coconut</p>
<p>water question</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been buying</p>
<p>these other kinds like zinko</p>
<p>that they have at the grocery</p>
<p>store it&rsquo;s like a milk carton</p>
<p>right coconut</p>
<p>water right</p>
<p>and the other day i passed out with it in bed</p>
<p>and then the next day</p>
<p>i looked at him like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d probably just</p>
<p>throw it in the refrigerator has the word</p>
<p>water in it</p>
<p>is that something that</p>
<p>you can leave out</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s not like a milk</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>water well i assume</p>
<p>that it could go bad because</p>
<p>ants find it</p>
<p>well i mean if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sealed all the time and they go</p>
<p>crazy oh it&rsquo;s sealed and we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>ants you have</p>
<p>ants in your house</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never seen an ant at my</p>
<p>house ever really yeah</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s cause the</p>
<p>roaches eat them all</p>
<p>i live in the woods man i got rats ants</p>
<p>deer i have deer in my yard all the time your</p>
<p>ants here though are like documentary style ants</p>
<p>though that you have like</p>
<p>gay parade ants</p>
<p>yeah well no mile march</p>
<p>this house is surrounded by land you know</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not a lot of shit out there for them</p>
<p>to eat and so when they find that they can get inside</p>
<p>and get to the</p>
<p>motherload in the garbage bill you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either</p>
<p>garbage pail or a</p>
<p>plate that&rsquo;s left around</p>
<p>these motherfuckers one</p>
<p>scout will find it</p>
<p>that would be cool if</p>
<p>ants had like really big</p>
<p>ants like it</p>
<p>would be like a</p>
<p>bunch of ants and then like a huge like</p>
<p>you know boss battle ant that</p>
<p>would like walk with the</p>
<p>ants are so terrifying man i was</p>
<p>watching this documentary on</p>
<p>the harpy eagle somebody put it up on online</p>
<p>you see that that</p>
<p>monkey eating eagle</p>
<p>dude if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen this you</p>
<p>gotta look it you</p>
<p>gotta look it up online</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t find it at all is on my twitter</p>
<p>from probably from yesterday you&rsquo;ll find it just i</p>
<p>tweet a lot unfortunately</p>
<p>that one was late</p>
<p>too i remember</p>
<p>when you posted it at four in the morning i was</p>
<p>watching yeah yeah my</p>
<p>friend that was with him was like that joe is</p>
<p>watching documentaries on my</p>
<p>animals at 4 30am</p>
<p>dude all i do this is what i do</p>
<p>i stay up i read with my</p>
<p>daughter when she goes to bed she goes to bed at</p>
<p>like you know whatever so when she goes to bed i read</p>
<p>her little stories and then i</p>
<p>start writing so once everybody&rsquo;s asleep</p>
<p>because mrs rogan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>asleep everyone&rsquo;s asleep then there&rsquo;s no there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>noise the dogs are fed the dogs are inside sleeping</p>
<p>then i can write</p>
<p>so i write from like</p>
<p>usually from like 10pm is when i really get cracking</p>
<p>till like two in the morning i</p>
<p>start getting</p>
<p>tired right</p>
<p>you know so i bang out two</p>
<p>hours you know four hours</p>
<p>and then just chill out</p>
<p>that midnight shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great i just need it seems like i</p>
<p>the only problem is is that i find myself</p>
<p>going to the same</p>
<p>seven websites ten websites over and over and</p>
<p>over and over</p>
<p>again you gotta be careful</p>
<p>about that you</p>
<p>gotta be careful</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna write</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i love that program i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about on the show before</p>
<p>right room right room it&rsquo;s the best because it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>allow you to access the message</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get to look at the</p>
<p>browser you know</p>
<p>look at the</p>
<p>status bar you don&rsquo;t look down at your task bar</p>
<p>where all your</p>
<p>programs are you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>start fucking around and see what kind of</p>
<p>movies do i have on this</p>
<p>hard drive oh this is a cool documentary i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen this before</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just distract yourself with something you gotta</p>
<p>force yourself to just write</p>
<p>and once i do i love it</p>
<p>such a weird</p>
<p>thing about that</p>
<p>about getting work done like that</p>
<p>like once when i write</p>
<p>like when i</p>
<p>get something really that done that i that i really</p>
<p>enjoy that i</p>
<p>wrote i feel so satisfied it feels like so like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i feel</p>
<p>energized i feel like i&rsquo;m positive i feel good</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so hard to just</p>
<p>commit to to working hard</p>
<p>it is right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to commit</p>
<p>to sitting down and working</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s so many distractions there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>things you could do</p>
<p>what the worst is</p>
<p>especially like</p>
<p>video editing</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;ll get to parts</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>rendering it&rsquo;ll say something like 30 minutes you know</p>
<p>so you have to sit there for 30 minutes and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to just sit there and stare at the 30</p>
<p>minute sign you&rsquo;re gonna look</p>
<p>on the internet or</p>
<p>what is and then you get</p>
<p>trapped in that what is like the baddest</p>
<p>motherfucker rendering computer available is it like</p>
<p>some sort of a</p>
<p>crazy pc with like multiple</p>
<p>processors but</p>
<p>they all use</p>
<p>pretty much they all use the same</p>
<p>chips honestly</p>
<p>like if you went balls</p>
<p>crazy you&rsquo;d want to get</p>
<p>in my opinion this is what i would do</p>
<p>is get one of the</p>
<p>towers from mac</p>
<p>and get the</p>
<p>they have like</p>
<p>you know the quadruple process or whatever it is</p>
<p>and they have it now you can have like 32 gigs of ram</p>
<p>and but the biggest</p>
<p>thing the thing that i</p>
<p>think would help the most</p>
<p>is getting an</p>
<p>ssd card hard drive</p>
<p>for your operating</p>
<p>system for your programs for</p>
<p>everything because</p>
<p>it that&rsquo;s the biggest</p>
<p>thing that i&rsquo;ve noticed with crashing</p>
<p>and just time consuming is the right</p>
<p>read write on the hard</p>
<p>drives and how slow regular hard</p>
<p>drives is compared</p>
<p>to compared to the</p>
<p>ssd hard drive</p>
<p>ssd what brian&rsquo;s talking about</p>
<p>solid state hard</p>
<p>drives which is</p>
<p>basically very similar to when you get a</p>
<p>flash drive like a usb</p>
<p>drive you stick it in and you just</p>
<p>record that&rsquo;s like a little mini hard</p>
<p>drive right</p>
<p>and the little ones now are way bigger than the</p>
<p>first hard drives that i had totally i mean i got a 32</p>
<p>gigabyte one it&rsquo;s a little tiny</p>
<p>thing it sticks in as 32 gigs right</p>
<p>my first hard</p>
<p>drive was only four gigs yeah if i</p>
<p>could do like that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing i have the</p>
<p>problem the biggest problem with mine is just the hard</p>
<p>drive how much hard</p>
<p>drive space</p>
<p>in how fast the rendering is and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing you need to battle is rendering yeah</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quicker to access off a</p>
<p>solid state</p>
<p>drive as well oh yeah so</p>
<p>what you want though is you</p>
<p>want your applications running on it and you want like</p>
<p>have enough room to have what projects and</p>
<p>videos you&rsquo;re running off you want to run all off you</p>
<p>understand the</p>
<p>technology behind</p>
<p>solid state as opposed to regular hard</p>
<p>drives do you know</p>
<p>which one well there&rsquo;s no there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>you know moving parts at all it&rsquo;s how they do it</p>
<p>then what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on there</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem in</p>
<p>magic yeah man i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super dragon tears and</p>
<p>super crazy</p>
<p>magic this one is totally</p>
<p>silent this one</p>
<p>is solid state</p>
<p>hard drive one</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so silent and</p>
<p>everything pulls up instantly it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>you know the read times as far as</p>
<p>my old hard</p>
<p>drive used to have to boot up and you</p>
<p>would hear like this little spin</p>
<p>going on and then</p>
<p>the program</p>
<p>would run like</p>
<p>my really old i have an old old macbook</p>
<p>really old it&rsquo;s fat like a fucking when you</p>
<p>close it it&rsquo;s like an old book</p>
<p>right and you pop that</p>
<p>bitch open and when you turn on you hear things</p>
<p>spinning and</p>
<p>clicking and</p>
<p>chunking and</p>
<p>sucks that&rsquo;s what this laptop does</p>
<p>and the little</p>
<p>old goofy looking</p>
<p>you know like ancient cartoon looking apple</p>
<p>logo pops up yeah</p>
<p>yeah so the the the biggest one that</p>
<p>apple offers is a 12 core</p>
<p>12 core see that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>processors that&rsquo;s retarded i wonder if you can</p>
<p>if you select it</p>
<p>i wonder if you can like jack it up even</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all for</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all for just like rendering</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m sure you</p>
<p>can jack it up</p>
<p>like you know it sucks though is like the machine i use</p>
<p>i used to have a 20</p>
<p>20 inch monitor as my main monitor</p>
<p>which is pretty small</p>
<p>and then it</p>
<p>would have like this big monitor for editing</p>
<p>videos for timeline</p>
<p>as a 30 inch monitor</p>
<p>so i just replaced the 20 inch monitor the</p>
<p>other day with this view sonic</p>
<p>and so now i have a</p>
<p>27 inch and a 30 inch</p>
<p>but for some</p>
<p>reason that&rsquo;s too much hd display for my mac</p>
<p>so now my cursor just goes so slow now across the</p>
<p>screens it&rsquo;s like the graphics card can&rsquo;t handle it</p>
<p>it sucks well i went with</p>
<p>everything that you</p>
<p>could possibly get</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>twelve thousand six hundred</p>
<p>and ninety nine dollars</p>
<p>yo that&rsquo;s what the hard drive</p>
<p>how big of a hard</p>
<p>drive is that that is well that&rsquo;s not even with</p>
<p>everything because i</p>
<p>would go with 30 gigs of memory</p>
<p>32 gigs of memory</p>
<p>is another thousand dollars now we&rsquo;re up to 16</p>
<p>000 dollars you can get that memory</p>
<p>cheaper don&rsquo;t ever buy memory from</p>
<p>well if you just wanted to get the big</p>
<p>party rolling but they do the hard</p>
<p>drives that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all with five hundred and</p>
<p>twelve solid</p>
<p>state five hundred twelve</p>
<p>five hundred</p>
<p>twelve twelve gigs and i got four of them</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know that they went up that high that was that</p>
<p>money man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sweet that you can get like</p>
<p>you can go and get a computer for fucking</p>
<p>500 bucks or you can get this goddamn</p>
<p>thing for 16 000</p>
<p>if you wanted to make your own that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>about windows</p>
<p>though if you wanted to make your own computer that was</p>
<p>equal in performance to this computer</p>
<p>you could probably do it for a tiny fraction of that</p>
<p>money not really i mean</p>
<p>cause i mean</p>
<p>really i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely gonna be</p>
<p>cheaper like</p>
<p>if the smart</p>
<p>thing to do is not to buy</p>
<p>your ssd drives from apple</p>
<p>you pretty much</p>
<p>wanted to go to a</p>
<p>store like fry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>electronics</p>
<p>and pick up a case and pick up hard</p>
<p>drives and a</p>
<p>motherboard and</p>
<p>everything and put together your own computer</p>
<p>and make it</p>
<p>to this kind of specifications how much do you</p>
<p>think it would cost</p>
<p>if you had a guess it would be</p>
<p>eight thousand it would be</p>
<p>pretty it would be pretty</p>
<p>close no it actually would be pretty close because</p>
<p>the fastest processor is</p>
<p>still gonna be really expensive the fastest</p>
<p>i mean that much ram it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>gonna be pretty</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be that much difference</p>
<p>i think they priced out a macbook pro</p>
<p>on someone like</p>
<p>ant nan tech or something like that they priced it out</p>
<p>as with the same</p>
<p>version of windows</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t that far off it was like</p>
<p>90 it was pretty</p>
<p>close actually</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a macbook pro this is like a high</p>
<p>level tower</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all right</p>
<p>what you would do is you</p>
<p>would just get the bare bones processor</p>
<p>whatever highest processes you want don&rsquo;t get any</p>
<p>as less ram as possible through</p>
<p>as less hard drive</p>
<p>space as possible from them</p>
<p>want to probably maybe even</p>
<p>see what the graphics card option is go for the</p>
<p>basic graphics card option and then</p>
<p>buy all this shit</p>
<p>separately right but</p>
<p>this is maxed out though</p>
<p>this is maxed out</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about maxed out if you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know the best hard</p>
<p>drives right the</p>
<p>best operating</p>
<p>with best video card</p>
<p>any any like</p>
<p>alienware or anything like that if you</p>
<p>start maxing out different</p>
<p>things though like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get you on ram</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like when you buy something and they give you</p>
<p>extras and they just i</p>
<p>know i totally know what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>about ordering from big companies but</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is if you wanted to do it on your own</p>
<p>right if you wanted to go to your own</p>
<p>no i do actually</p>
<p>i have no idea</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t built a computer</p>
<p>in six years it is kind of</p>
<p>crazy though that you know</p>
<p>i mean the big percentage of the</p>
<p>population in the country</p>
<p>and the world rather uses windows</p>
<p>right oh yeah</p>
<p>yeah i mean it&rsquo;s something like 70 or 80 percent</p>
<p>everybody that uses computers has windows</p>
<p>right but meanwhile</p>
<p>they get viruses</p>
<p>yeah have you ever</p>
<p>heard of anybody getting a</p>
<p>virus when you have an apple no</p>
<p>i know they exist cunt</p>
<p>bag pain in the ass are</p>
<p>viruses right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the biggest fucking pain in the ass ever i mean</p>
<p>i have had so many people on the message board</p>
<p>say you know when they&rsquo;re scared of</p>
<p>clicking a link like i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>clicking that i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>clicking that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never looked at something and said i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>clicking that</p>
<p>right cause i&rsquo;m not worried</p>
<p>about losing my</p>
<p>shit well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the best</p>
<p>things about</p>
<p>apples and i&rsquo;m sure everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna start</p>
<p>screaming there are</p>
<p>viruses they have invented them</p>
<p>my favorite</p>
<p>thing also is that see with pcs i used to</p>
<p>build pcs most of my life i would be</p>
<p>this graphics card this</p>
<p>motherboard this memory this hard</p>
<p>drive this and that</p>
<p>the problem is that windows has to</p>
<p>be able to work on all</p>
<p>these variations of hard drives and</p>
<p>different kinds of graphics cards</p>
<p>it has to be</p>
<p>super programmed</p>
<p>for all these different</p>
<p>combos with apple</p>
<p>apple programs</p>
<p>exactly for the hardware it uses there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a thousand different</p>
<p>graphics cards that go into a</p>
<p>the motherboard that that works in the</p>
<p>apple you know so</p>
<p>they got an</p>
<p>apple motherboard or what they call a</p>
<p>logic board</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s more expensive</p>
<p>i totally know what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>they give you less choices and</p>
<p>because of that they</p>
<p>build it on themselves so it&rsquo;s more fine tuned</p>
<p>as an operating</p>
<p>system on top of it because of the hardware</p>
<p>it is apple hardware it is</p>
<p>what it is but there&rsquo;s something pretty dope</p>
<p>about being able to</p>
<p>go i used to love making my own computers i&rsquo;ve done it</p>
<p>at least twice</p>
<p>where i went and got the whole deal</p>
<p>motherboard case put it all together spent</p>
<p>god who knows how many hours</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re actually finally</p>
<p>online with some computer that you made yourself</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty dope yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something fucking cool oh</p>
<p>dude it was like a rector set style yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something badass</p>
<p>about the fact nowadays it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>cheap that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to do that anymore though i know but it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something fun to it</p>
<p>is there something</p>
<p>super satisfying</p>
<p>like duncan has one of my computers</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>super satisfying i put that shit together</p>
<p>i installed the operating</p>
<p>system you know i</p>
<p>tweaked the registry</p>
<p>and i went into the bios remember the what is it the</p>
<p>not the things</p>
<p>about spacers</p>
<p>what are those</p>
<p>things fucking</p>
<p>fuses or what are</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>stuff to put out</p>
<p>those were the</p>
<p>worst because that it was like oh you have to</p>
<p>you know tweezers to pull yeah</p>
<p>and it had to be different</p>
<p>combos like</p>
<p>oh that was</p>
<p>annoying yeah there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>annoying shit</p>
<p>about making computers</p>
<p>like the show</p>
<p>going to bios and having to change the</p>
<p>frequency down or the ram cache</p>
<p>size if you have a different kind of graphics card</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like so many</p>
<p>annoying little</p>
<p>well how about dudes who</p>
<p>would go into their</p>
<p>bios and overclock their</p>
<p>motherboard</p>
<p>just slight</p>
<p>tweaking like dudes</p>
<p>would buy celeron processors and tweak them</p>
<p>so that they performed like an intel</p>
<p>like a pentium processor</p>
<p>remember when celerins</p>
<p>first came out and that was like that diet coke of</p>
<p>computers yeah this</p>
<p>was like there was</p>
<p>something missing but dudes</p>
<p>would overclock the shit out of them and play</p>
<p>quake with them</p>
<p>cause it was like</p>
<p>super cheap</p>
<p>there was even</p>
<p>a few companies online that</p>
<p>would overclock shit for you</p>
<p>so they would</p>
<p>build it for you like</p>
<p>super jacked like some</p>
<p>super jacked</p>
<p>giant heatsink on it fans blowing all over it</p>
<p>meanwhile they got this poor little</p>
<p>poor little</p>
<p>processor going</p>
<p>just everything&rsquo;s like jack to the max like much higher</p>
<p>than it&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>yeah yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the whole</p>
<p>thing is interesting how</p>
<p>quickly it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>evolved from</p>
<p>when i first got my</p>
<p>first computer it was a pentium to 400</p>
<p>so was four hundred megahertz man</p>
<p>three eighty six for life</p>
<p>three eighty six</p>
<p>three eighty six</p>
<p>which how many megahertz is that</p>
<p>three eighty six</p>
<p>is it three hundred</p>
<p>eighty six yeah then it goes up to four eighty six was</p>
<p>my upgrade i was like oh my god i got four eighty six</p>
<p>wow so amazing</p>
<p>well i remember</p>
<p>when when i</p>
<p>first got it</p>
<p>was like the top of the line it was a micron</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>first pc that i got</p>
<p>and i remember thinking</p>
<p>you know like wow look at all this</p>
<p>power and all this</p>
<p>space and all this</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>close to what your</p>
<p>phone does right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>yeah my phone has</p>
<p>thirty two gigs of</p>
<p>space on it my</p>
<p>first hard drive had four</p>
<p>thirty two gigs and my first</p>
<p>first computer was</p>
<p>four hundred megahertz</p>
<p>this is a thousand</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s in your pocket and it&rsquo;s thin as you know</p>
<p>like a notebook</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing yeah</p>
<p>we live in strange ass times man</p>
<p>we really do you know</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>this guy in jail for this hacking his wife&rsquo;s fucking</p>

<p>we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about it i&rsquo;ve gone to jail</p>
<p>crazy and if i had</p>
<p>cell phones back then you know i</p>
<p>would have been fucking recording that shit you</p>
<p>would have been free you&rsquo;d be a free man i&rsquo;d be a free</p>
<p>man well i mean i was free already but it just took me</p>
<p>money and a year and a half of</p>
<p>court isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>crazy one nutty</p>
<p>bitch blows one</p>
<p>fuse one day and it affects you for</p>
<p>you know a percentage of your life</p>
<p>a year and a half it&rsquo;s like 10</p>
<p>000 dollars to 12 000 dollars and i fucking made like</p>
<p>40 dollars a day think</p>
<p>about that if you live the perfect life</p>
<p>and you lived a long long healthy life one year</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one percent of your life</p>
<p>you had to give up one percent</p>
<p>of your life dealing with this</p>
<p>chicks bullshit yeah my fucking job</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even let me take off time anymore</p>
<p>for the court</p>
<p>like i had to go to</p>
<p>court like every</p>
<p>couple weeks</p>
<p>you know it seemed like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>might be exaggerating a little bit i</p>
<p>think i went to</p>
<p>court like 12 to 14 times and i remember</p>
<p>having to always call off work and they got the</p>
<p>point where we can&rsquo;t give you any more</p>
<p>fucking time you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to replace you</p>
<p>and i actually had to like find people that work for me</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>right all for just some nutty broad</p>
<p>yeah and nothing happened</p>
<p>just craziness</p>
<p>just made up fantasy she actually didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>pick up the charges she just said that she got in a</p>
<p>fight with her</p>
<p>boyfriend and she kicked i kicked her out of the</p>
<p>house and that the city</p>
<p>picked up the charges because like</p>
<p>the oj simpson law</p>
<p>something like that oj cost you dude fucking oj</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>if you lived a healthy life you&rsquo;d be a hundred right a</p>
<p>great life a</p>
<p>great long life you hear</p>
<p>about a guy die he was a hundred you go wow that guy</p>
<p>lived a good life that&rsquo;s a long life</p>
<p>one percent</p>
<p>of a hundred is a year all right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s craziness</p>
<p>dude you gave up 1</p>
<p>of your life you know</p>
<p>and then she&rsquo;s trying to add me on facebook like</p>
<p>a year and a</p>
<p>half ago and i&rsquo;m like are you fucking kidding me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious what are you</p>
<p>gonna do like</p>
<p>take pictures if i poke you</p>
<p>did she ever apologize</p>
<p>did she said she oh no</p>
<p>the day that the court</p>
<p>dropped the charges and</p>
<p>everything like that they were like you know</p>
<p>dropped all the charges</p>
<p>she wrote me or she called me</p>
<p>and i have it on my voicemail i had it on my voicemail</p>
<p>back in the day or answer machine back in the day</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>sorry about</p>

<p>i kicked her out of my</p>
<p>house i was like fuck you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>breaking my</p>
<p>house you left her in the street</p>
<p>i just shut her</p>
<p>i just pushed her out the</p>
<p>front door shut</p>
<p>the door no it was</p>
<p>no it was like so how&rsquo;d you</p>
<p>expect her to get home</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>she was breaking shit in my</p>
<p>house i was like fuck her you</p>
<p>get the fuck out of my house</p>
<p>you know she was</p>
<p>going crazy so you</p>
<p>should have called the cops at that</p>
<p>point and then you said i</p>
<p>should have i</p>
<p>should have this girl was</p>
<p>smashing my shit i want her out of here i</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>but to me i was so pissed off that i just went upstairs</p>
<p>and just went to bed</p>
<p>cause it was like</p>
<p>2 a m or something like that</p>
<p>so she called the cops and what did she tell the cops</p>
<p>she said that my boyfriend</p>
<p>and i got in an argument he pushed me out of the</p>
<p>house and then wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drive me home</p>
<p>and the officer was like what do you mean push</p>
<p>cause i actually did she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t leave my</p>
<p>house i opened the</p>
<p>front door and i pushed her out</p>
<p>not like fall on the grounds</p>
<p>you know or anything like</p>
<p>that it was more like get on this side of the door all</p>
<p>right door shut</p>
<p>you know type push and</p>
<p>and the officers like oh he pushed you he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t drive you home and so they</p>
<p>unlawful restraint</p>
<p>they got you</p>
<p>think she blew</p>
<p>one of the cops</p>
<p>no but it was a girl cop</p>
<p>but what was</p>
<p>crazy is that</p>
<p>when the beginning of the</p>
<p>court case i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>said this part</p>
<p>when i went to</p>
<p>court case they</p>
<p>made you go to an</p>
<p>anger therapist</p>
<p>like a court appointed</p>
<p>anger therapist</p>
<p>where they just ask you questions to see if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>crazy or not</p>
<p>or angry it was a</p>
<p>psychologist</p>
<p>psychologist</p>
<p>and halfway through</p>
<p>that guy goes i&rsquo;m sorry i am</p>
<p>going to have to stop i actually know the</p>
<p>other person that you did this with i went to high</p>
<p>school with her</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m going to have to have my assistant take on</p>
<p>the rest of this interview and so</p>
<p>the guy i&rsquo;m like wait that&rsquo;s not fair</p>
<p>this guy went to high</p>
<p>school with her</p>
<p>and said this</p>
<p>other guy walks in and sits down and goes because</p>
<p>we continued it</p>
<p>we leave and then yeah they told the</p>
<p>court like oh yeah he&rsquo;s crazy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>angry he&rsquo;s mad and blah blah</p>
<p>blah and so then i had to get a lawyer just to like</p>
<p>tell the judge like that&rsquo;s not fair</p>
<p>that the person with the high</p>
<p>school with her that come on give me a</p>
<p>break he got</p>
<p>off of it though and then he brought in his friend</p>
<p>yeah yeah but did he</p>
<p>brief his friend on what</p>
<p>yeah absolutely</p>
<p>so you think that he&rsquo;s like go</p>
<p>after this douchebag</p>
<p>well absolutely</p>
<p>if you worked as a</p>
<p>psychiatrist and your</p>
<p>buddy from high</p>
<p>school came</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>on your side of your</p>
<p>buddy of your</p>
<p>group that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>especially if you were in love with her</p>
<p>right and especially</p>
<p>anyways so we had to like</p>
<p>go to court like</p>
<p>three times</p>
<p>and then like just to get the</p>
<p>judge to say</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s bullshit yeah we&rsquo;ll give you another</p>
<p>psychiatrist to go to</p>
<p>of course i went to the other</p>
<p>psychiatrist and they&rsquo;re like oh yeah he&rsquo;s fine he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely normal then they</p>
<p>dropped off so</p>
<p>they actually said that there was something</p>
<p>wrong with you</p>
<p>the first person</p>
<p>was like what they</p>
<p>say they said that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>angry i could see that he will revolt in</p>
<p>anger that guy</p>
<p>should be fired</p>
<p>i know i know this</p>
<p>but this is also like what 10 years ago what&rsquo;s his name</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>10 years ago how do you not have that burn in your</p>
<p>brain it was actually more intense</p>
<p>i was 19 i would be making videos</p>
<p>about that guy</p>
<p>every day now</p>
<p>if i get you locked in a cage yeah now</p>
<p>if i knew it for some high</p>
<p>school pussy that&rsquo;s what it was</p>
<p>high school</p>
