<blockquote>
<p>Welcome, everybody. Mr. President, Mr. Provost, Madam Secretary, college deans,</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>colleagues, friends, families, move all, members of the class of 2023.</p>
<p>Welcome to this day and congratulations. [Cheers and Applause]</p>
<p>I call on the University Chaplain. &raquo; SHARON KUGLER: With deep</p>
<p>gratitude to the Quinnipiac ople for this land on ich stand, my beloved Yale Family, I</p>
<p>invite you to join me in the spirit of prayer. Almighty and loving God, you are</p>
<p>the One who gives us this day and all our days, in the majesty of this life moment, we, your</p>
<p>beloved children of different colors, creeds, generations, stories and tongues are gathered</p>
<p>in this place as one human family united in jubilant celebration.</p>
<p>We are filled with gratitude for our families, friends, teachers and guides.</p>
<p>Their arms have sheltered us, their shoulders have boosted us, and today their hearts soar for</p>
<p>us. Eternal God, it is you who calls us to our full humanity.</p>
<p>As we celebrate our accomplishments, we are humbled and overwhelmed by what lies</p>
<p>ahead. We live in a world fraught with heartache and our time at Yale</p>
<p>uncertainty, discovery and reconnection.</p>
<p>Steady us so that we may find ways to caress the beauty of your creation and let our souls</p>
<p>know true delight as we awaken to the wonder and mystery of our own unfolding lives.</p>
<p>Through the unity of mind and spirit, hold us ever close as we seek to leaven your world wisely</p>
<p>in the steadfast pursuit of your light and your truth. For this we say, Amen.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Om. That which pervades earth, sky, and heaven, which is worthy of</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>worship, that has no beginning, that which is the light of wisdom and truth, let us</p>
<p>meditate on the radiance of that divinity. May that brilliance help inspire</p>
<p>and illuminate our minds. That One which represents water, light, and is the quintessence</p>
<p>in all things. May that almighty spirit pervading the earth, atmosphere,</p>
<p>and heaven bless us with enlightenment. &raquo; Send forth Your light and</p>
<p>Your truth, they will lead me, they will bring me to Your holy mountain, to Your</p>
<p>dwelling-place, that I may come to the altar of God, God, my delight, my joy, that I may</p>
<p>praise You with thharp O God, my God. &raquo; You are the light of the</p>
<p>world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid.</p>
<p>No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it</p>
<p>gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light ine fore others, so that</p>
<p>they may see your good works and give glory to your God in heaven.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>God is the Light of the heavens and earth. The likeness of His light is</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>that of a niche, in which there is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass.</p>
<p>The glass is, as it were, a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive tree</p>
<p>neither  theast nor of the West, whose oil seems to glow even though no fire has touched</p>
<p>it. Light upon Light! God guides whom He wills to His</p>
<p>light. God makes parables for humanity, and God has knowledge of</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ Joyful, joyful, we adore thee, God of glory, Lord of love ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Hearts unfold like flowers</p>
<p>before thee, opening to the sun above ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Melt the clouds of sin and</p>
<p>sadness, drive the dark of doubt away ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Giver of immortal gladness,</p>
<p>fill us with the light of day ‚ô™ ‚ô™ All thy works with joy surround thee, earth and heaven</p>
<p>reflect thy rays ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Stars and angels sing around thee, center of unbroken</p>
<p>praise ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow,</p>
<p>flashing sea ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Chanting bird and flowing fountain, call us to rejoice in</p>
<p>thee ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Mortals, join the mighty chorus which the morning stars</p>
<p>began ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Love divine is reigning o&rsquo;er us, binding all within its</p>
<p>span ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Ever singing, march we onward, Vick victors in the midst of</p>
<p>strife ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Joyful music leads us sun ward in the triumph song of life ‚ô™</p>

<p>DEAN LEWIS: Graduates, parents, friends, President Salovey, Chaplain</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Kugler, ancolleagues on the faculty and staff, on this occasion, Baccalaureate, it is</p>
<p>customary for the President to deliver an address and for the Dean of Yale College to offer a</p>
<p>reading. Although this is only my first year as dean, I&rsquo;ve been teaching</p>
<p>at Yale for a quarter of a century, and I find the opportunity to watch the class</p>
<p>of 2023 over the past few years. Most of you came here in 2019 and experienced the pandemic as</p>
<p>a disruption to your first year and sophomore year. hers arrived elier a too</p>
<p>some time off from your studies. Only recently have we had the opportunity to reestablish many</p>
<p>Yale traditions in person. It has been a challenging time to be a college student, but you</p>
<p>have overcome obstacles and have thrived here at Yale. I am reminded of some lines from</p>
<p>one of my favorite bands, the Grateful Dead. Sometimes the light&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>shining on me, Other times I can barely see. Lately it occurs to me What a</p>
<p>long, strange trip it&rsquo;s been. [Cheers and Applause] I wasn&rsquo;t going to sing it,</p>
<p>Peter. But even though the last four or five years have been a</p>
<p>remarkable journey, I am delighted to see you all set out on an even longer and perhaps</p>
<p>stranger journey ahead, and I have no doubt that you will thrive in the world beyond the</p>
<p>college gates. So I have chosen a poem about a journey for today&rsquo;readg.</p>
<p>Constantine Cavafy, a modern Greek poet born in Alexandria, Egypt, often rewrote stories</p>
<p>from the ancient world. In his poem Ithaka, he addresses a person setting out on a</p>
<p>journey. Although the addressee is not named, it seems to be Homer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Odysseus, one of the most famous Travelers in literature, who is setting out on a journey to his</p>
<p>home on the Greek island of Ithaka. But as Cavafy addresses his</p>
<p>traveler, I think each of you can imagine that he is speaking directly to you in this</p>
<p>transla. Ithaka. As you set out for Ithaka Hope</p>
<p>your road is a long one, Full of adventure, full of discovery. Laistrygonians, Cyclops, Angry</p>
<p>Poseidon &ndash; don&rsquo;t be afraid of them: You&rsquo;ll never find things like</p>
<p>that on your way As long as you keep your thoughts raised high, As long as a rare excitement</p>
<p>Stirs your spirit and your body. Laistrygonia, Cyclops, Wild Poseidon &ndash; you won&rsquo;t encounter</p>
<p>them Unless you bring them along inside your soul, Unless your soul sets them up in front of</p>
<p>you. Hope your road is a long one. May there be many summer</p>
<p>mornings when, With what pleasure, what joy, You enter harbors you&rsquo;re seeing for the</p>
<p>first time, May you stop at Phoenician trading stations To buy fine things, Mother-of-pearl</p>
<p>and coral, amber and ebony, Sensual perfume of every kind &ndash; As many sensual perfumes as you</p>
<p>can, And may you visit many Egyptian cities To learn and go on learning from their scholars.</p>
<p>Keep Ithaka always in your mind. Arriving there is what you&rsquo;re destined for.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t hurry the journey at all. Better if it lasts for years, So</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re old by the time you reach the island, Wealthy with all you&rsquo;ve gained on the way, Not</p>
<p>expecting Ithaka to make you rich. Ithaka gave you the marvelous</p>
<p>journey. Without her you wouldn&rsquo;t have set out.</p>
<p>She hanothg left to givu now. And if you find her poor, Ithaka</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t have fooled you. Wise as you will have become, so full of experience, You&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>understood by then what these Ithakas mean. Graduates of the class of 2023,</p>
<p>I wish you success and self-discovery on the journey ahead of you.</p>
<p>Thank you, and congratulations! [Applause]</p>
<p>‚ô™ Alleluia ‚ô™</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>PRESIDENT SALOVEY: Graduates of the class of 2023, family members, and friends, it gives</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>me great pleasure to welcome you and to offer you a few words this morning.</p>
<p>First, there is a wonderful Yale tradition that I would like to honor right now.</p>
<p>May I ask all the families and friends here today to rise and recognize the outstanding &ndash; and</p>
<p>graduating &ndash; members of the class of 2023. [Cheers and Applause]</p>
<p>And now, may I ask the class of 2023 to consider all those who have supported your arrival at</p>
<p>this milestone, and to please rise and recognize them. [Cheers and Applause]</p>
<p>That concludes the aerobic exercise portion of our program. Today, as we assemble at an</p>
<p>inflection point in your lives &ndash; between &ldquo;the shortest, gladdest years of life&rdquo; and</p>
<p>exciting new chapters that lie beyondhem &ndash; I want  discu the importance of community</p>
<p>engagement here in New Haven and in your future. Raise your hand if you</p>
<p>participated in a service organization on campus or in the local community during your time</p>
<p>at Yale. That&rsquo;s a lot of hands. It&rsquo;s a lot of hands, but I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>surprised,ecause I know that nearly all of you have immersed yourselves in the work</p>
<p>of civic betterment in one form or another over the past four years.</p>
<p>Despite the rigors of your studies, you have promoted literacy with New Haven Reads,</p>
<p>brought the basics of computer science to public school classrooms through Code Haven,</p>
<p>and tutored immigrants for whom English is not a first language as Bridges ESL volunteers.</p>
<p>You have likewise helped to alleviate housing and food insecurity through the Yale</p>
<p>Hunger and Homelessness Action Projec suprted your student neighbors as Walden peer</p>
<p>counselors, and engaged in remedial climate action with the Urban Resources Initiative.</p>
<p>Even on the heels of final exams last week, many of you volunteered in Yale Day of</p>
<p>Service activities. You have, collectively, pursued unfinished work in our</p>
<p>society &ndash; and affirmed what Coretta Scott King observed on this campus in 1969, that</p>
<p>&ldquo;students want to start today on the world of tomorrow.&rdquo; Although not necessarily learned</p>
<p>in the classroom, this spirit of service is every bit part of what makes a Yale education</p>
<p>distinctive. And in all, we estimate that you and your classmates contributed</p>
<p>a remarkable 150,000 hours each year you were here to community-based causes.</p>
<p>Rather than reflect on how your work in this community will reverberate long after you exit</p>
<p>Phelps Gate, though, I want to implore you to replicate it no matter where you go next.</p>
<p>For several years now, even before the Covid-19 pandemic, this country has seen a decline</p>
<p>in social capital and the value we derive from positive connections among people.</p>
<p>litil scientist Robert Putnam diagnosed this decay through something that used to</p>
<p>be pretty common in my time as a teenager in Buffalo, New York &ndash; bowling leagues.</p>
<p>Putnam, an eminent Yale alumnus, observed that more Americans are bowling, but fewer in organized</p>
<p>leagues. So, he used the vivid metaphor of &ldquo;bowling alone&rdquo; to represent</p>
<p>the breakdown of traditional social networks in contemporary society.</p>
<p>As a touchstone of his thesis, Putnam pointed to a reduction in membership among organizations</p>
<p>like PTAs, the Red Cross, and Lions Clubs from mid-20th century peaks.</p>
<p>He found, in short, that we are &ldquo;dropping out in droves &hellip; from organized community life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the two decades since &ldquo;Bowling Alone&rdquo;&rsquo;s publication,</p>
<p>depicted a sharp decrease in community involvement. The hours donated annually by</p>
<p>volunteers, for example, halved between the start of the century and your first year at Yale.</p>
<p>And the national volunteering rate dropped an additional 7 percentage points by the time</p>
<p>you were a junior. So, what happens when social ties weaken?</p>
<p>Certainly, something is lost in our communities. We also retreat into ourselves.</p>
<p>We become isolated. And we feel lonely. Surveys indicate the alarming</p>
<p>prevalence of these feelings. 60% of Americans, including a full 75% of younger people like</p>
<p>yourselves, now struggle with loneliness. Some weeks ago, this frayed</p>
<p>social fabric compelled U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, also a Yale alumnus, to declare</p>
<p>a loneliness epidemic in America. The ramifications for our health</p>
<p>and wellbeing are wide-ranging, he says, but an antidote is within reach.</p>
<p>As Dr. Murthy remarked last semester at Yale, community service activities &ldquo;connect [us]</p>
<p>with somebody deeply on something that matters &hellip;  but also reaffirm to us that we have</p>
<p>value to bring to the world. And they help [to] rebuild that esteem which gets shredded when</p>
<p>we are lonely.&rdquo; Of course, service activities are as salutary for society as</p>
<p>they are for ourselves. Social capital can contribute to positive outcomes in education,</p>
<p>children&rsquo;s welfare, the safety of our neighborhoods, economic prosperity, and even democracy</p>
<p>itself. Our civic and social lives form the mortar of American</p>
<p>society &ndash; and a pillar of public health. We must, therefore, redouble our</p>
<p>resolve to rescue them. In doing so, we should be mindful of a distinction</p>
<p>articulated by philosopher John Dewey, on whom Yale bestowed an honorary degree in 1951.</p>
<p>Many social reformers, he lamented, however noble their intentions, have failed to meet</p>
<p>their ambitions &ldquo;because they were committed to doing good for rather than with others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, for our part, we aspire to make Yale the most civically engaged university by</p>
<p>strengthening the ties that bind us to our host city, New Haven. Like most of you, I arrived in</p>
<p>New Haven as a visitor. I remember my first days at Yale as an entering graduate student</p>
<p>in 1981, blown away by the beauty of the stone ildings and by the tastiness of the</p>
<p>local pizza. Over the next four decades, I discovered that New Haven is a</p>
<p>fascinating and vibrant community in which to live. The Elm City quickly became my</p>
<p>and Marta&rsquo;s home, and an integral part of our identities. Your time here may well be</p>
<p>shorter than ours, although I urge you to consider adding your talents to the rich mix of what</p>
<p>makes this a great place to work anlive. But whether you remain in New</p>
<p>Haven or not after graduation, we all experience a distinct bond between Yale and our home</p>
<p>city. And the depth of that relationship was reflected most</p>
<p>recently by the historic pledge to extend our lead as the institution that makes the</p>
<p>largest annual voluntary financial contribution of any U.S. college or university to</p>
<p>its home city. [Applause] But a university&rsquo;s</p>
<p>responsibility to its host city goes beyond financial contributions &ndash; what Dewey</p>
<p>might have deemed &ldquo;worthwhile ends.&rdquo; It should be intellectual.</p>
<p>It should be innovative. And it should be human. It should be with as well as</p>
<p>for. The metaphor of the ivory tower walled off from its</p>
<p>surroundings &ndash; and, at Yale, protected by moats and gates &ndash; is no longer apt.</p>
<p>What is real, instead, is a social contract in which we willingly and readily obligate</p>
<p>ourselves to the welfare of one another. So, our task &ndash; even as we</p>
<p>increase our voluntary payments &ndash; is to reinforce our culture of engagement.</p>
<p>Alum such exemplify this ideal. A native of Cleveland, Ohio,</p>
<p>1983 graduate of Yale College, and, as with about 20% of you, the first in her family to</p>
<p>attend college, Patricia has dedicated her career to helping young people in our community.</p>
<p>For over a decade, she has led New Haven Promise, a Yale-funded scholarship and career</p>
<p>development ogram that is one of our most treasured collaborations.</p>
<p>Patricia&rsquo;s inspired work delivers the dream of college for scores of young people who</p>
<p>otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be able to afford it. Importantly, the Promise program</p>
<p>encourages college students to return to New Haven following graduation just as she did.</p>
<p>The results have been superb. By the end of this decade, we expect to have welcomed back</p>
<p>thounds of Promiselumni o will accelerate the renaissance well under way in our city</p>
<p>alongside many other Yale initiatives, such as the recently established Pennington</p>
<p>Fellowship and the Center for Inclusive Growth. And soon we also look forward to</p>
<p>joining the Mayor&rsquo;s recently announced tutoring program for New Haven schoolchildren.</p>
<p>It is heartening to consider these extraordinary community partnerships that alumni like</p>
<p>Patricia unleash &ndash; and, as Yale&rsquo;s newest graduates, you can soon enrich.</p>
<p>Before we say farewell, I wish to hearken back to when we first met.</p>
<p>You may recall that four years ago, I penned an open letter to welcome the class of 2023.</p>
<p>In it, I asked you to consider a series of questions, among them, why are we here?</p>
<p>Why is Yale here? What is our purpose? Of course, improving the world</p>
<p>through research and education is Yale&rsquo;s mission. The crises that surround us &ndash;</p>
<p>pressing in nature and often planetary in scale &ndash; compel the class of 2023 to mobilize its</p>
<p>unique gifts for a world in need. And the liberal education you</p>
<p>have acquired at Yale has prepared you well to do so. Look closely, though, and you</p>
<p>will see that in a pithy mission statement dedicated to articulating our university&rsquo;s</p>
<p>entire purpose, Yale puts equal emphasis on where we hope to achieve it.</p>
<p>Indeed, as we devote ourselves to improving the world, we retain our focus on the</p>
<p>&ldquo;interdependent community&rdquo; in which this work is advanced, ever attuned to our immediate</p>
<p>social surroundings. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor said to Yale Day of Service</p>
<p>participants some years ago, our tradition of civic work &ldquo;is expressed in many ways,</p>
<p>including in City Halls, in Statehouses, in Congress, in the cabinet &ndash; and yes, even on the</p>
<p>Supreme Court. But this tradition of service,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is also</p>
<p>powerfully expressed daily by countless Yale graduates fired by spirit of generosity.</p>
<p>By relief workers amidst disasters. Mentors in urban schools.</p>
<p>Volunteers in parks, libraries, and museums, and in so many other roles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think, for instance, of a former student of mine, Caroline Tanbee Smith, whose love for</p>
<p>this city was catalyzed by her President&rsquo;s Public Service Fellowship.</p>
<p>Caroline stayed in New Haven after graduating from Yale College.</p>
<p>And in 2017, she co-founded a nonprofit community accelerator dedicated to making</p>
<p>entrepreneurship more accessible, particularly for low-income community members,</p>
<p>women, and people of color, helping them to create new jobs and generate millions of dollars</p>
<p>in revenue for this region. &ldquo;Those efforts, your efforts,&rdquo; Justice Sotomayor said, &ldquo;may not</p>
<p>suly make a difference.&rdquo; most Indeed, your efforts as students engaged in service showcase why</p>
<p>the &ldquo;where&rdquo; of Yale&rsquo;s mission statement matters. Your efforts show that the</p>
<p>transformative is within reach. That there is marvelous grandeur in the constellation of</p>
<p>seemingly small acts of service with and for each other that together constitute a thriving</p>
<p>civic life on this campus. The sum of your contributions has brought immense pride to</p>
<p>Yale, and an equal measure of progress to our community. Here you have heeded Bob Dylan</p>
<p>and &ldquo;strapped yourself to a tree with roots,&rdquo; and nourished them. Of course, we hope some of you</p>
<p>will consider his next refrain, also &ndash; &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t going nowhere&rdquo; &ndash; and join us right</p>
<p>here in New Haven. But for those of you who will soon disperse around the</p>
<p>globe &ndash; also a fine outcome &ndash; we hope, too, that you will reprise what you have done here.</p>
<p>We hope that you will be known as much for your curiosity of mind as your generosity of</p>
<p>spirit. We hope that wherever it is upon life&rsquo;s sea you sail, you will</p>
<p>arrive there not only as proud alumni of this university but as emissaries of its ethos, ready,</p>
<p>once again, to raise your hand and engage. Congratulations, class of 2023!</p>
