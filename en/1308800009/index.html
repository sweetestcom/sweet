    <p>In 2016, Kristen was all grown up and a mom of her own when she decided to take her mom&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cold case into her own hands.</p>
<p>It got to a point about seven years ago where I was like, okay, I want to do this.</p>
<p>I was sitting at home with little kids and I just started reaching out like, hey, is</p>
<p>there anything new, anything going on?</p>
<p>Who can I talk to?</p>
<p>And a lot of them were, no, there&rsquo;s nothing new, there&rsquo;s nothing I can tell you because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything type of thing.</p>
<p>She was asking all those questions over the phone and via email from hundreds of miles</p>
<p>away, so it&rsquo;s not like she could just march down to the prosecutor&rsquo;s office and demand</p>
<p>answers.</p>
<p>You see, it had been decades since Kristen or any of her immediate family members had</p>
<p>lived in Indiana.</p>
<p>Back in 1989, five years after Darlene&rsquo;s murder, Ron got a new job opportunity with the door</p>
<p>manufacturing company.</p>
<p>So the Holst family moved away from Argus and not just out of town, to a whole different</p>
<p>state.</p>
<p>This is episode eight.</p>
<p>It all goes through one guy.</p>
<p>By then, Ron and his wife, Chris, had also added a son to the family.</p>
<p>So Marie, Melissa, and Kristen had a new baby brother, tons of changes for their family</p>
<p>in just five years.</p>
<p>So the girls were a bit hesitant about leaving Argus.</p>
<p>It was the only place they&rsquo;d ever called home, even though it was a constant reminder of</p>
<p>their family&rsquo;s biggest tragedy.</p>
<p>I was not excited because I was leaving all my friends and all of our family was there.</p>
<p>I was not excited.</p>
<p>And the South is so different from the North.</p>
<p>The only part I was looking forward to moving down here is because I got my own room.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re going to get you your own room.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, that works.</p>
<p>From 1984 to 1989, the family was defined by what happened to Darlene and the failed</p>
<p>investigation into finding her killer.</p>
<p>The move wasn&rsquo;t exactly intended to be a fresh start for them, but in many ways it was.</p>
<p>They settled in and all of a sudden no one at school knew the horrible thing that had</p>
<p>happened to their family.</p>
<p>Of course, they would visit family members back in Argus every so often.</p>
<p>I mean, we would try and go back twice a year, but then they got fewer and further between</p>
<p>after that.</p>
<p>But we would go back for a long time.</p>
<p>But it got to the point where they sort of dreaded going back there.</p>
<p>They figured if a huge breakthrough ever came in Darlene&rsquo;s case, someone would let them</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>But in the 30 plus years since, no one ever called.</p>
<p>So when Kristen started making calls about her mom&rsquo;s case back in 2016, she was frustrated</p>
<p>to learn that nothing had been done in years.</p>
<p>She found out the case file was essentially sitting on a shelf in Marshall County Prosecutor</p>
<p>Nelson Chipman&rsquo;s office in Plymouth, Indiana.</p>
<p>So I reached out to Nelson and he talked to me because he remembered about mom&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>He said he had her picture up in his office still, but that there was nothing new going</p>
<p>on with it.</p>
<p>Of course, Kristen&rsquo;s next question was, well, how do we change that?</p>
<p>She pushed and pushed, call after call, but she felt like she was getting nowhere.</p>
<p>Kristen even arranged an in-person meeting with Prosecutor Chipman, and he basically</p>
<p>dismissed her, saying that what&rsquo;s been done has been done and there&rsquo;s not much else he</p>
<p>can do.</p>
<p>I said, you guys, the case files are just sitting there collecting dust.</p>
<p>And he leaned across his desk, he goes, you don&rsquo;t think I know that?</p>
<p>I was like, well, obviously nothing is going to get done when it&rsquo;s just sitting there.</p>
<p>You know, have a fresh pair of eyes look at it, something, you know, do the touch DNA</p>
<p>testing.</p>
<p>After that meeting I had with him, when I left, I got up and left his office in tears.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t, we haven&rsquo;t spoken since then.</p>
<p>Kristen left that meeting not knowing if anything would even happen.</p>
<p>And Marie knew how hard Kristen had worked for years by that point, trying to get some</p>
<p>movement in their mom&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>So being the big sister she is, Marie called Prosecutor Chipman.</p>
<p>I said, you know, you don&rsquo;t understand what it&rsquo;s like, because you don&rsquo;t have this in</p>
<p>your life.</p>
<p>And I said, you need to be a little more gentler with her, because you are coming off rude,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got to understand where she&rsquo;s coming from.</p>
<p>And I just think he&rsquo;s lost that sense, that touch of things, because it&rsquo;s not his personal</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>And I get that, but you still don&rsquo;t need to talk that way, a little more kinder.</p>
<p>There were no apologies or mending fences.</p>
<p>Instead, Nelson assigned someone in his office to act as a liaison between Kristen and himself.</p>
<p>But maybe something about what Marie said tugged at his heartstrings.</p>
<p>Or maybe Kristen&rsquo;s persistence paid off.</p>
<p>Either way, Kristen was shocked, surprised, encouraged.</p>
<p>All the emotions when in 2019, Prosecutor Chipman was in the local news talking about</p>
<p>how they were planning to use new DNA technology to try and solve Darlene&rsquo;s case once and for</p>
<p>all.</p>
<p>Detectives are not giving up.</p>
<p>Right now, they are starting over with fresh eyes, once again tracking down persons of</p>
<p>interest and conducting interviews.</p>
<p>Chipman also says they&rsquo;re choosing new pieces of evidence to send to the Indiana State Police</p>
<p>Crime Lab.</p>
<p>Kristen was hopeful.</p>
<p>She could feel answers just around the corner.</p>
<p>But around the same time, that liaison that Nelson had appointed, Kelly, who&rsquo;d been keeping</p>
<p>Kristen in the loop on stuff that was going on in the case, she left Nelson&rsquo;s office for</p>
<p>a different job.</p>
<p>She still tried to keep up to date on the investigation in order to text Kristen updates,</p>
<p>but new information was scarce after that.</p>
<p>It took some time.</p>
<p>I mean, so much so that Kristen thought the ball had been dropped yet again.</p>
<p>But at some point, she heard that they had gotten some kind of DNA off some piece of</p>
<p>evidence, but the details were fuzzy.</p>
<p>Now, she knew nothing was going to happen overnight.</p>
<p>But months were going by.</p>
<p>And then years.</p>
<p>February 2021 was when I came across that 2018 news story.</p>
<p>I had stumbled across Darlene&rsquo;s story and become a little obsessed, as I&rsquo;ve been known</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>But there was just nothing, a big void where I expected answers were sure to be.</p>
<p>Now, normally, I&rsquo;d set my Google alerts and wait for something to pop, but I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what it was about this one.</p>
<p>Instead, I found Kristen on Facebook and sent her a DM.</p>
<p>And that message put us on a wild journey that I could have never imagined.</p>
<p>After my message to Kristen, we hopped on a phone call and she got me up to speed with</p>
<p>everything she&rsquo;d been doing since 2016, which included not just pushing the prosecutor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>office, but doing some sleuthing of her own, creating maps, connecting important events</p>
<p>through newspaper archives.</p>
<p>But she said that she was stuck.</p>
<p>What needed to happen was DNA testing, which brought us full circle to the reason for me</p>
<p>reaching out.</p>
<p>My big question was, well, what the hell happened after that article in 2019?</p>
<p>And she said she had no idea.</p>
<p>She explained to me the falling out that she had with Prosecutor Nelson, and by 2021,</p>
<p>his liaison no longer worked in his office.</p>
<p>Her only lifeline of communication was gone.</p>
<p>So really, she had no idea exactly what evidence they had or what was happening with it.</p>
<p>I worked with a lot of good people in law enforcement, and I&rsquo;ve worked with a lot of</p>
<p>families.</p>
<p>And this kind of rift that happens is something that I&rsquo;ll never fully understand, but it happens.</p>
<p>I knew there was no fixing it by the time we came in, but maybe there could be a bridge.</p>
<p>Maybe we could be that bridge, is what I was hoping.</p>
<p>When I asked Kristen if she wanted our help, I&rsquo;ll be honest, she wasn&rsquo;t jumping.</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, she wasn&rsquo;t against it, but I think over the years, she learned</p>
<p>to keep her hopes tempered.</p>
<p>So instead, she gave me a resounding, at this point, it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>We dipped our toes in slowly.</p>
<p>Chitman sent us everything she had, and we tried wrapping our heads around the case,</p>
<p>one little piece of the puzzle at a time.</p>
<p>By 2022, I had assigned our reporter, Emily, to start digging into Darlene&rsquo;s case full-time.</p>
<p>And like any good reporter, she knows that you gotta get to the source.</p>
<p>And the source in this case is prosecutor Nelson Chitman.</p>
<p>So she started there.</p>
<p>It took several phone calls to Chitman&rsquo;s office before he even called her back.</p>
<p>And when we asked for a sit-down interview with him, this is what he said.</p>
<p>Foreign, says the guy who had gone on local TV saying he was reopening the case.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s changed between then and now that makes you not want to do another interview?</p>
<p>I mean, isn&rsquo;t it always worth trying?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it always worth trying just to get some new publicity out there in case it does spark</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s memory?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re listening, right?</p>
<p>Even if Nelson doesn&rsquo;t think anything will come of this, he&rsquo;s the gatekeeper.</p>
<p>And I know this because we also tried getting interviews with the Indiana State Police and</p>
<p>the Marshall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, even the state crime lab.</p>
<p>And they all say that we have to talk to Nelson, that he is in charge of the case.</p>
<p>And I just have to preface this by saying it&rsquo;s unusual for a prosecutor to be the gatekeeper</p>
<p>of a case that has never even been close to an arrest.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a detective and his office doesn&rsquo;t have detectives.</p>
<p>But when we asked him why he had it, he said that he just inherited it from the prosecutor</p>
<p>before him.</p>
<p>Like at some point, Darlene&rsquo;s case went from the jurisdiction of the Marshall County Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office to the Indiana State Police and then the Marshall County Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>But no one really has a logical explanation for why that happened or any real plans to</p>
<p>transfer it again.</p>
<p>But Emily is nothing if not persistent.</p>
<p>Let me just pop by your office and we can have a conversation, she said.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, he agreed.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be worth our time either way.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>OK, thanks, Nelson.</p>
<p>I will&hellip;</p>
<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll buy it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll buy it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it for granted.</p>
<p>Emily traveled to Plymouth, Indiana for that meeting.</p>
<p>And the first thing Nelson did was take her to see the photo of Darlene that he keeps</p>
<p>on the wall in his office.</p>
<p>What has made you want to keep that up on your wall?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a reminder of what we&rsquo;re here for.</p>
<p>Our big goal for that first meeting with Nelson, which was in September 2022, was to see what</p>
<p>results, if any, they had gotten from the new DNA testing they allegedly tried around</p>
<p>2018 or 2019.</p>
<p>And keep in mind, Nelson talks in circles and sometimes the details are fuzzy or he</p>
<p>says he can&rsquo;t answer a question.</p>
<p>But about a half an hour into the interview, he started to open up a bit.</p>
<p>And he said, OK, yes.</p>
<p>After Kristen and I had our disagreement, I sent off a piece of evidence for MVAC testing</p>
<p>and the results were exciting, but, quote, not a slam dunk.</p>
<p>So it sounds like you got something partial.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it identifies a male.</p>
<p>An unknown male?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t have a standard to go with.</p>
<p>If we had a standard, you&rsquo;d be here taking pictures of a perp walk or something, right?</p>
<p>A partial profile isn&rsquo;t enough to put in CODIS, but it is enough to do direct comparison</p>
<p>tests.</p>
<p>Do you have DNA swabs for the suspects in the case?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t talk about that.</p>
<p>So Nelson wouldn&rsquo;t say if they were in the process of doing any direct comparisons with</p>
<p>suspects or persons of interest, but he was sort of willing to theorize about what he</p>
<p>thinks happened to Darlene.</p>
<p>And his theories, even decades after the crime, are very similar to what Sergeant Dave</p>
<p>Yokelet was theorizing back in the 80s, though they&rsquo;re still in touch today, so that&rsquo;s likely</p>
<p>where the theory came from.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one person.</p>
<p>I think it was sex-driven.</p>
<p>You would think that the person would have the tendency of have done something like that</p>
<p>before and would have done something like that after.</p>
<p>You would think, amateur, I&rsquo;m an amateur.</p>
<p>That paradigm, that way of perspective for me has proven useful through the years of</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m going to go in a courtroom, those people in there, in the jury box, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>know less than, and I need to convince them.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m going to convince them, I need to be convinced.</p>
<p>Do you think it was someone who has really strong local ties, who&rsquo;s lived here, who lived</p>
<p>here at the time and sounds like still might be in the area?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to let up, are you?</p>
<p>When we asked Nelson to explain how he managed to have a falling out with a victim&rsquo;s daughter,</p>
<p>he said that when she first reached out, he was really open with her about investigative</p>
<p>information, and that he was getting criticized by certain people, quote-unquote, on his side,</p>
<p>for being too open.</p>
<p>And then everything came to a head when they met in person.</p>
<p>Nelson even accused Kristen of lying about her grandfather&rsquo;s funeral in order to come</p>
<p>to Indiana to meet with him.</p>
<p>It was a bad scene, and she was very emotional.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d come up here.</p>
<p>She said she came up here for a family funeral, but she couldn&rsquo;t tell me where it was or whatever</p>
<p>was going on.</p>
<p>I think it was just an excuse to get here, which is fine, you know, I could feel for</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>It was very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>For the record, I don&rsquo;t think it matters why Kristen was in Indiana.</p>
<p>I mean, she has a right to meet with authorities in charge of solving her mom&rsquo;s case anytime</p>
<p>she wants.</p>
<p>But just in case anyone&rsquo;s wondering, her grandpa did, in fact, die.</p>
<p>We found the obituary, complete with funeral service information.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I don&rsquo;t blame them for wanting answers.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And I felt bad.</p>
<p>You know, I hate for it to have ended like that.</p>
<p>And I sure as hell hate, like, if in 14 months, 16 months, whatever it is, 18 months, and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gone, you know, I sure hope whoever takes over, if it was just gonna be Tammy that they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>take over with as much passion.</p>
<p>Passion.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Chipman is saying that he hopes whoever takes over his job will have as much</p>
<p>passion as him when it comes to trying to solve Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>But this guy talks a lot about retirement.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been in the role for a decade, and when Emily met with him in September 2022, he was</p>
<p>in the middle of running for reelection, and he ran unopposed, so he won the bid for Marshall</p>
<p>County prosecutor in November 2022.</p>
<p>But he says he&rsquo;ll be retired by 2024.</p>
<p>He also talks a lot about how busy his office is, and how huge their workload is, and how</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a dedicated investigator working on Darlene&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Do you wish you had, like, a full-time cold case investigator looking at both of these</p>
<p>cases?</p>
<p>Um, I couldn&rsquo;t justify that.</p>
<p>If it was supplied, yeah, it would be great, but, um, you know, just two cases.</p>
<p>We had three, but everybody seems to think pretty well that the suspect on the third</p>
<p>one is deceased.</p>
<p>So apparently, in Nelson&rsquo;s opinion, two unsolved murders isn&rsquo;t enough to justify a dedicated</p>
<p>homicide investigator.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, passion without action ain&rsquo;t gonna cut it.</p>
<p>So Emily and I decided, we&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll investigate Darlene&rsquo;s case, and we&rsquo;ll start from scratch.</p>
<p>What we didn&rsquo;t realize in the fall of 2022, after that first meeting with Nelson, was</p>
<p>just how much more there was to uncover.</p>
<p>Part of that meant staying on Nelson&rsquo;s good side, because the guy&rsquo;s a talker.</p>
<p>You can tell he wants to talk and be a part of this.</p>
<p>And to his credit, he gave us time, a lot more than we expected.</p>
<p>So Emily thought, why not ask for just a little more?</p>
<p>She asked if he would take her out to the crime scene.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you want to go that way, I can lead you that way.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Nelson escorted Emily himself, past Darlene&rsquo;s house and the patch of woods where her body</p>
<p>was found.</p>
<p>And along the way, he opened up more about his real theory of Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And it gave us a really great place to start our investigation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in episode 9.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go for a ride.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
