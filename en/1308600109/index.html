    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Recently, the Huberman Lab hosted a live event</p>
<p>at the Beacon Theater in New York City.</p>
<p>The event was entitled The Brain-Body Contract,</p>
<p>and it consisted of a lecture</p>
<p>followed by a question and answer session with the audience.</p>
<p>We wanted to make the recorded version</p>
<p>of that question and answer session available to everybody,</p>
<p>regardless of who could attend.</p>
<p>So what follows is the question and answer period</p>
<p>from the Brain-Body Contract live Huberman Lab event.</p>
<p>Want to be sure to thank the sponsors from that event.</p>
<p>They were 8Sleep, which makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with heating and cooling capacity.</p>
<p>I started sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>about eight months ago,</p>
<p>and it has completely transformed my sleep.</p>
<p>I sleep so much deeper.</p>
<p>I wake up far less during the middle of the night,</p>
<p>if at all,</p>
<p>and I wake up feeling far better than I ever have,</p>
<p>even after the same amount of sleep.</p>
<p>In fact, I love my 8Sleep so much that when I travel,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m quite bothered that Airbnbs and hotels</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have 8Sleep mattress covers on them,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve even shipped my 8Sleep mattress cover out</p>
<p>to meet me in the location that I arrived to</p>
<p>so that I get the best possible sleep.</p>
<p>If you want to try 8Sleep,</p>
<p>you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to save up to $400 off their Sleep Fit Holiday Bundle,</p>
<p>which includes their new Pod 3 cover.</p>
<p>8Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada,</p>
<p>United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s 8sleep.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to also thank our supplement partner, Momentus.</p>
<p>They make the very highest quality supplements.</p>
<p>They ship internationally,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve formulated supplements</p>
<p>as single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that match what is discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in any of those supplements,</p>
<p>please go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now without further ado,</p>
<p>the question and answer session</p>
<p>from the live event held at the Beacon Theater</p>
<p>in New York City.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said before that stress can be good for us,</p>
<p>but how do we know when it&rsquo;s too much?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>And I should preface that by saying</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some incredible work</p>
<p>that was done by a colleague of mine, Dr. Aaliyah Crum.</p>
<p>Aaliyah is how she goes by, Dr. Aaliyah Crum,</p>
<p>who is a, she was a Division I athlete.</p>
<p>She has a, she&rsquo;s a tenured professor</p>
<p>of psychology at Stanford.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a licensed clinical psychologist.</p>
<p>Like every once in a while, I look around at my colleagues.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my goodness, you know, who are these people?</p>
<p>Very humbling place to be.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s made some important discoveries,</p>
<p>and I wanna just highlight one,</p>
<p>which is this notion of mindset.</p>
<p>And no, these are not placebo effects,</p>
<p>but let me just tell you, when you think about stress,</p>
<p>how you think about stress is really important.</p>
<p>First of all, you can&rsquo;t lie to yourself,</p>
<p>but if, for instance, you watch a one or three minute video,</p>
<p>as she&rsquo;s given subjects in her lab about stress,</p>
<p>and it tells you all the terrible things</p>
<p>that stress does to your immune system and sleep,</p>
<p>then you experience those things,</p>
<p>increases in blood pressure, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, if you watch a one to three minute video</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also true about the fact</p>
<p>that stress can sharpen your decision making</p>
<p>for certain kinds of things,</p>
<p>actually can accentuate your immune system.</p>
<p>I wish someone would help me</p>
<p>get this narrative right out there.</p>
<p>Stress does not deplete your immune system</p>
<p>unless it goes on a long, long time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about what long means in a moment.</p>
<p>Why would it?</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>If you had to fast and move with family</p>
<p>or weather a storm of any kind, emotional or physical,</p>
<p>and you got sick, that wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually after you&rsquo;re stressed.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been go, go, go,</p>
<p>or taking care of a loved one,</p>
<p>or studying, or working hard,</p>
<p>and then you finally go on vacation, you rest,</p>
<p>you arrive and you get sick,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because your immune system shut down, it stopped.</p>
<p>Your immune system is mobilized by that alertness side</p>
<p>of your autonomic nervous system, but you do need sleep.</p>
<p>You do need sleep,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually, we think, the slowing of circulation,</p>
<p>and this is why it&rsquo;s probably not a good idea to exercise</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re already sick, and if you&rsquo;re veering towards sick,</p>
<p>probably limit the intensity of any kind of interaction</p>
<p>as best you can and just still yourself.</p>
<p>Well, Ali&rsquo;s lab has clearly shown us over and over again</p>
<p>that what we know, our knowledge base,</p>
<p>really does shape the physiology over those outcomes.</p>
<p>Now you know that stress is both bad and good,</p>
<p>so which one is it?</p>
<p>Does it average to nothing?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It turns out that you can bias this</p>
<p>in one direction or the other,</p>
<p>depending on which information</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re listening to more often.</p>
<p>I think this is really important.</p>
<p>I still am trying to get my head and my mind</p>
<p>around what&rsquo;s happened over the last few years</p>
<p>and where it&rsquo;s placed us.</p>
<p>Like, where did it land us?</p>
<p>Are we more resilient now, or are we just really beat up?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know, but I think how we interpret</p>
<p>the last few years is gonna make a big difference</p>
<p>in terms of how it impacts us.</p>
<p>How do we know if we are&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks, yeah.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re missing out there, I think,</p>
<p>is a narrative from somebody that people listen to,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying that person should be me.</p>
<p>In fact, it shouldn&rsquo;t be me,</p>
<p>but somebody that can help us frame</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s just happened to us, much like a good&hellip;</p>
<p>I think that the world needs a good therapist, basically.</p>
<p>Needs a very good therapist.</p>
<p>So I would call short-term stress,</p>
<p>which is very beneficial for us,</p>
<p>is the kind of stress that happens</p>
<p>on the order of a day, two, or three days.</p>
<p>Not a problem, even if you feel torn apart,</p>
<p>provided you can get rest afterwards.</p>
<p>Long-term stress is the kind of stress</p>
<p>that really starts to impede your sleep-wake cycle,</p>
<p>make your dreams more stressful and more like nightmares,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not going away.</p>
<p>And I can promise you that for those of you</p>
<p>that have challenges with accumulation of stress</p>
<p>from the past that&rsquo;s now compounded</p>
<p>by what&rsquo;s happening now, et cetera,</p>
<p>that the solution does seem to be</p>
<p>to get yourself into a supported environment of some kind</p>
<p>that will allow you to go through a full catharsis.</p>
<p>Again, it doesn&rsquo;t have to require psychedelics.</p>
<p>That can take you through the full ride</p>
<p>of autonomic intensity catharsis of some sort,</p>
<p>and then relaxation.</p>
<p>That does seem to be what snaps people out</p>
<p>of what we would call longer-term stress</p>
<p>and historical stress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even the question of whether or not</p>
<p>focusing directly on the trauma</p>
<p>and the story is so critical.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>Obviously, that&rsquo;s something that should be done</p>
<p>with a clinician.</p>
<p>But stress that impedes your sleep</p>
<p>for three nights or more,</p>
<p>that shifts the pattern of dreams to more anxious dreams,</p>
<p>that is more long-term stress.</p>
<p>And for that, you need to take it seriously.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the kind of thing where</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t take it seriously,</p>
<p>it can start degrading things like your immune system,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>And I would say that under those conditions,</p>
<p>use sleep as a good marker.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some clinicians in the room.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the questions that is used as a diagnostic</p>
<p>for whether or not people are depressed</p>
<p>or anxiously depressed</p>
<p>is whether or not they&rsquo;re sleeping well or not.</p>
<p>Right, again, language is not very good</p>
<p>at parsing what&rsquo;s going on inside.</p>
<p>We have to look to behaviors</p>
<p>and regularity of sleep, wake cycles, et cetera.</p>
<p>Hopefully, that was at least a partial answer.</p>
<p>I tried to be accurate, but if I were exhaustive,</p>
<p>I might actually cure insomnia someday with these podcasts,</p>
<p>the if nothing else.</p>
<p>How has hypnosis been impacting my life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in hypnosis now.</p>
<p>No, I actually spent most of the afternoon in hypnosis.</p>
<p>Before I do these, I spend a good hour in hypnosis.</p>
<p>Again, self-directed hypnosis, gosh, it&rsquo;s so unfortunate.</p>
<p>I keep talking to David Spiegel about this.</p>
<p>Again, his dad was one of the originators of hypnosis</p>
<p>as a valid psychiatric treatment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even the idea that things like EMDR,</p>
<p>the scanning of eyes back and forth</p>
<p>while reporting a narrative,</p>
<p>may actually be capturing some of the elements of hypnosis.</p>
<p>Again, and this is why, at least for me,</p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity to come together tonight</p>
<p>to talk about principles.</p>
<p>I would hope that after tonight,</p>
<p>you could look at any practice,</p>
<p>anything, any compound, any breathing exercise,</p>
<p>and just be able to frame up which continuum,</p>
<p>where on the continuum, what&rsquo;s it really designed to do,</p>
<p>move you up towards alertness or down towards calm.</p>
<p>And in fact, because I can&rsquo;t help myself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you, for all the breathing stuff,</p>
<p>it can be made very simple.</p>
<p>If your exhales are longer and more vigorous</p>
<p>than your inhales, you&rsquo;re gonna get calmed down.</p>
<p>If your inhales are longer and more vigorous</p>
<p>than your exhales, you&rsquo;re going to become more alert.</p>
<p>And if you hold your breath,</p>
<p>just eventually just start breathing again.</p>
<p>The physiology maps perfectly to that.</p>
<p>That maps perfectly to the physiology.</p>
<p>And if you, for instance, you do box breathing,</p>
<p>inhale, hold, exhale, hold, and this kind of thing,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re gonna stay right where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be on an even plane, more or less.</p>
<p>Okay, so that sort of hopefully captures</p>
<p>all of breath work in one sentence.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll answer the question you were asking me.</p>
<p>Hypnosis, it&rsquo;s impacted my life in a couple of ways.</p>
<p>One way is more from a practical, scientific way,</p>
<p>which is that my laboratory works on vision</p>
<p>and we work on stress.</p>
<p>And in some ways, those might seem divorced,</p>
<p>although now with the cuttlefish</p>
<p>and the fact that your eyes narrow their field of view</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re stressed, et cetera,</p>
<p>it should become obvious why that is.</p>
<p>But hypnosis also takes advantage</p>
<p>of this really weird kind of cool feature,</p>
<p>which is, and it&rsquo;s always weird</p>
<p>when you do a group exercise,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t really see you all that well.</p>
<p>I certainly can&rsquo;t see your eyes well enough to know this.</p>
<p>But David Spiegel, there&rsquo;s actually something in the,</p>
<p>this is a valid thing called the Spiegel eye roll test,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not the teenage eye roll,</p>
<p>that when you look up with, while not moving your head,</p>
<p>when you look up, you actually are engaging circuits</p>
<p>in your brainstem that are involved in generating alertness.</p>
<p>And when you look down and your eyes close,</p>
<p>the opposite is true.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re engaging circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that are taking you into a calmer state.</p>
<p>Now, wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if all you had to do</p>
<p>was look down and you&rsquo;d be calm and look up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be alert?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t quite work that way.</p>
<p>But to induce hypnosis, what they do is</p>
<p>they have people look up and then while looking up,</p>
<p>close their eyes, which is actually kind of hard to do.</p>
<p>Some people can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Their eyes roll forward, hence the Spiegel eye roll test.</p>
<p>Some people, their eyes get, you see the whites</p>
<p>of their eyes and it looks really spooky,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking up while their eyes close.</p>
<p>Those people are very prone to hypnosis.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, hypnosis is a state of deep relaxation</p>
<p>with alertness and focus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a contextual narrowing, excuse me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like being in early stage sleep,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why stage hypnosis works</p>
<p>with people telling people to do certain things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re under the control of the hypnotist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that they forget what&rsquo;s around them.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because their mind is focused internally</p>
<p>and on the dialogue with the hypnotist</p>
<p>and is not paying attention to context.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a narrowing of context.</p>
<p>But hypnosis for me has been very useful</p>
<p>because A, it validated the relationship</p>
<p>between vision and states of mind.</p>
<p>It also checks off this box again,</p>
<p>which is that to access neuroplasticity, what do you need?</p>
<p>You need focus, plus you need a state of deep relaxation.</p>
<p>Usually first focus, then sleep or non-sleep, deep rest.</p>
<p>But Spiegel and his daddy figured out,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re way smarter than I am,</p>
<p>that you can get people into that perfect state</p>
<p>of neuroplasticity by combining them both in real time</p>
<p>through this atypical thing we call hypnosis.</p>
<p>So I do a daily or maybe every other day hypnosis</p>
<p>script that&rsquo;s about, it&rsquo;s self-directed hypnosis script</p>
<p>of about five to 15 minutes, usually trying to get myself</p>
<p>to be less pissed off about something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m really pissed off about, frankly.</p>
<p>I imagine the stuff I&rsquo;m really pissed off about</p>
<p>in the screen on the left side.</p>
<p>I think about all the things that make me feel good</p>
<p>and then I keep thinking about how angry I am.</p>
<p>This is really how it goes.</p>
<p>And then over time, I&rsquo;ve noticed, hmm, well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re coupling that bodily state of calm</p>
<p>to the anger thing.</p>
<p>This is all very hard to do in talk therapy.</p>
<p>No disrespect to talk therapy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tremendous advantage to talk therapy</p>
<p>that I myself have benefited from it.</p>
<p>Although, according to certain people in my life,</p>
<p>not enough.</p>
<p>But hypnosis works because it&rsquo;s capturing</p>
<p>neuroplasticity processes.</p>
<p>Thank you for that question.</p>
<p>What are the most effective protocols</p>
<p>for boosting the microbiome?</p>
<p>Oh, well, here I&rsquo;m very fortunate</p>
<p>because my upstairs neighbor at Stanford</p>
<p>is the great Justin Sonnenberg</p>
<p>and he and his wife Erica run this amazing lab</p>
<p>defining all the principles of the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And they have a really cool idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s serious about this,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t help but chuckle when I think</p>
<p>that this might actually be true.</p>
<p>We all know, and this is definitely true,</p>
<p>that we all carry around trillions of little micro bacteria,</p>
<p>not just in our gut that goes from one end</p>
<p>of our throat to the other, any mucosal lining,</p>
<p>eyes, genitalia, nose.</p>
<p>We have microbiomes in our nose, et cetera.</p>
<p>This is why we&rsquo;re heading into the winter months,</p>
<p>being a nasal breather.</p>
<p>That sounds like crazy new agey stuff, be a nasal breather.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a book written by Paul Ehrlich</p>
<p>and Sandra Kahn at Stanford with a forward</p>
<p>by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky, the book Jaws.</p>
<p>So these are some heavy hitters.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very good evidence that people</p>
<p>who mouth breathe are making themselves</p>
<p>more prone to illness.</p>
<p>When nasal breathing, because of the microbiome,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a better filter for germs.</p>
<p>So this winter, and always really,</p>
<p>try and be a nasal breather all the time.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to do that,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not into the mouth taping thing,</p>
<p>which people do, is to try and do some of your exercise</p>
<p>with just nasal breathing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take a little while to get used to,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not good at the nasal breathing thing</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m always talking.</p>
<p>The microbiome is all over us, and in us it&rsquo;s on our skin.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually exchanging it when we meet</p>
<p>and we shake hands.</p>
<p>Do you know what happens usually in the first 10, 15 seconds?</p>
<p>Data from Noam Sobel&rsquo;s lab at the Weissman</p>
<p>has shown that we wipe our eyes.</p>
<p>We wipe other people&rsquo;s molecules on us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really good at that.</p>
<p>Just watch these interactions.</p>
<p>Now everyone&rsquo;s gonna be doing the germ-free handshake.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna be fist bump.</p>
<p>But there is this idea that maybe we are the house cats.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re not just transporting all these microbiota</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s good for us.</p>
<p>What if we&rsquo;re just the vehicles</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re running the planet,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, oh, we&rsquo;re running out of some stuff.</p>
<p>We should figure out somebody to take us to Mars,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll take over Mars.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s all them.</p>
<p>And Justin was the one that told me that.</p>
<p>I was like, that&rsquo;s kind of eerie if you think about it,</p>
<p>but there might be these other intelligences</p>
<p>that are hijacking us, and that&rsquo;s kind of scary</p>
<p>because we like to think that we&rsquo;re in charge,</p>
<p>and who knows.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s good for your microbiome,</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s good for them, that is?</p>
<p>Well, prebiotic fiber seems to be very important,</p>
<p>but the studies of fiber,</p>
<p>at least as it relates to the microbiome,</p>
<p>are somewhat controversial.</p>
<p>There was a study done on humans at Stanford</p>
<p>by Chris Gardner and Justin Sonnenberg</p>
<p>that showed that people who eat one to four,</p>
<p>they sort of, you have to ramp up,</p>
<p>servings of low-sugar fermented foods.</p>
<p>This would be your kimchi, your natto, your sauerkrauts,</p>
<p>your kefirs, your kombuchas, et cetera,</p>
<p>per day develop a very robust microbiome,</p>
<p>and fiber did not do that.</p>
<p>In fact, fiber increased the so-called inflammatome,</p>
<p>which is the markers for inflammation,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that fiber is bad.</p>
<p>Fiber actually is, getting enough fiber</p>
<p>is correlated with a number of other things that are great,</p>
<p>like reduced cardiovascular disease, for instance,</p>
<p>cancers of the colon, for instance.</p>
<p>So fiber and gut microbiota, prebiotics, probiotics,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably only necessary if you have a dysbiosis,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been taking antibiotics,</p>
<p>or if for some reason you&rsquo;re depleted of the microbiome.</p>
<p>One of the great ways to deplete your microbiome</p>
<p>is to just eat highly processed foods,</p>
<p>but hopefully most people aren&rsquo;t doing that.</p>
<p>So prebiotic fiber and these low-sugar fermented foods,</p>
<p>and then someone always says beer, right?</p>
<p>Someone always, yes, yes, beer will support your microbiome,</p>
<p>but it might do other things too.</p>
<p>So in general, low-alcohol, low-sugar fermented foods.</p>
<p>Reduce the number of inflammatory markers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very, very clear from the Sonnenberg data.</p>
<p>And then there are other ways, of course.</p>
<p>The microbiome actually interacts with temperature,</p>
<p>so the cold exposure thing</p>
<p>is actually good for your microbiome,</p>
<p>but, and I wanna really emphasize this,</p>
<p>if you hear about studies that such and such improve,</p>
<p>such and such, keep in mind that anything</p>
<p>that improves your sleep, your microbiome,</p>
<p>or your social interactions</p>
<p>will improve basically everything else.</p>
<p>And those are what we call modulating, excuse me, effects,</p>
<p>not mediating effects.</p>
<p>This is really important,</p>
<p>and we teach first-year graduate students</p>
<p>and medical students about this.</p>
<p>Like, for instance, if there were a fire alarm</p>
<p>pulled right now, God forbid,</p>
<p>it would modulate all of your attention,</p>
<p>but would you say that fire alarms mediate attention?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not directly in the line of mechanism,</p>
<p>but it can adjust an existing mechanism.</p>
<p>So great sleep is great for everything,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t control it directly.</p>
<p>And so things like getting great sleep,</p>
<p>keeping your microbiome healthy,</p>
<p>getting enough sunlight, et cetera,</p>
<p>they provide a kind of buoyancy</p>
<p>to all the organs and systems of your body,</p>
<p>but they aren&rsquo;t necessarily the thing that cures ADHD.</p>
<p>But of course, if you have ADHD or issues with focus,</p>
<p>getting enough sleep will help.</p>
<p>Does, is nutrition the way to cure your ADHD?</p>
<p>No, but if you improve your gut microbiome,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that your neurotransmitter systems</p>
<p>will improve, limiting sugar will help, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s reason to think that great sleep,</p>
<p>solid nutrition, microbiome, social interactions, exercise,</p>
<p>those are kind of the big five.</p>
<p>There are others too, of course.</p>
<p>With those, you set a good buoyancy</p>
<p>to all the other systems.</p>
<p>And then we get into the things</p>
<p>of how to directly increase focus</p>
<p>or modulate dopamine and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I realize some people are afraid of dogs.</p>
<p>We actually have a dog stimulus in our fear lab.</p>
<p>We get people that are terrified of dogs.</p>
<p>We hired this dog trainer guy who has these pit bulls</p>
<p>that will attack you while you&rsquo;re in VR.</p>
<p>By the end, people are a little more comfortable</p>
<p>with dogs in general.</p>
<p>For you and me, if you&rsquo;re not afraid of dogs,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not terribly terrifying,</p>
<p>but if you are, even the thought of that</p>
<p>can be pretty terrifying.</p>
<p>A couple of things people have thought about,</p>
<p>the eye contact thing.</p>
<p>They make eye contact.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re big on eye contact.</p>
<p>Humans too.</p>
<p>Eye contact is meaningful in terms of oxytocin release.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all real.</p>
<p>Those data are, the more and more data</p>
<p>that come out from better studies,</p>
<p>eye contact is a big deal.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also that just the dogs are always game</p>
<p>to show up exactly where you wanna meet them,</p>
<p>and they always show up in their most loving</p>
<p>possible state for them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty simple equation if you get it right,</p>
<p>and they need proper care, but.</p>
<p>I mean, Costello was unique because the bulldog also,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna get me going on dog breeds,</p>
<p>but the bulldog also looks disappointed all the time.</p>
<p>And then you do something it likes,</p>
<p>and then it looks delighted,</p>
<p>and pretty soon you&rsquo;re working for their approval.</p>
<p>And we were like the odd couple, me and him.</p>
<p>And I realize he&rsquo;s got me trained really, really well</p>
<p>to do my best to please him and delight him,</p>
<p>which delighted me, and there I was on the hook.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one reason.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s also another reason which is super nerdy,</p>
<p>which is this C-tactile fiber thing,</p>
<p>which is you have these little nerve endings in your skin,</p>
<p>and we know, of course, that oxytocin is released</p>
<p>from parent and child.</p>
<p>We know this from neuroimaging, et cetera.</p>
<p>We know oxytocin is released from romantic interact,</p>
<p>non-sexual romantic touch.</p>
<p>One of the things that is very powerful</p>
<p>for the release of oxytocin, very powerful,</p>
<p>is non-sexual grooming touch among members of a species,</p>
<p>or even across species.</p>
<p>Those pictures of monkeys picking around in each other,</p>
<p>or people who insist on popping things on one another,</p>
<p>or people who go to the hairdresser or the barber,</p>
<p>and they touch, it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be massage,</p>
<p>massive oxytocin release.</p>
<p>Those data don&rsquo;t get as much play</p>
<p>as all the data on oxytocin and love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the love hormone,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically a neurochemical signaling system</p>
<p>for this interaction feels good,</p>
<p>and is very much of the present.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an important distinction</p>
<p>to make more broadly, is that dopamine is really about</p>
<p>the pursuit of all things beyond the confines of our skin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get that thing, I want that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all about anticipation,</p>
<p>and when you have some distance between yourself</p>
<p>and the thing that you think will deliver</p>
<p>whatever it is you want, usually pleasure,</p>
<p>in some form or another, or excitement,</p>
<p>whatever your pleasure is, or combined,</p>
<p>then you actually have to mobilize,</p>
<p>and dopamine is the precursor to adrenaline.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Adrenaline is made from dopamine, it gets you into motion.</p>
<p>Then you have the reward systems that are more about</p>
<p>what you have from your skin surface inward.</p>
<p>So this is gentle touch, holding hands,</p>
<p>and indeed, stroking your dog probably does that for you.</p>
<p>It activates these C-fibers, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>in your skin, which feed right into these serotonin</p>
<p>and oxytocin systems of the brain.</p>
<p>Sounds a little pop psychology-ish, but it&rsquo;s a real thing,</p>
<p>and it exists in essentially all mammalian species.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of us just like dogs,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll let us just pet them all day.</p>
<p>Some people like to be touched a little bit more or less,</p>
<p>even when they trust, this is all consensual,</p>
<p>age-appropriate, context-appropriate,</p>
<p>in this case, species-appropriate.</p>
<p>Those are the conditions, very important.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I had to, I don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>my sister&rsquo;s in the audience, I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>she decided to do this in the first place,</p>
<p>but I loved having my face kind of like pet like that.</p>
<p>I still like it, but don&rsquo;t try it,</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s the only one, she can&rsquo;t do it anymore even.</p>
<p>So we all have these things that feel good,</p>
<p>and I think it feels good,</p>
<p>because it releases these chemicals.</p>
<p>And these are ancient systems, ancient, ancient systems</p>
<p>that we all have, and I think dogs let us do that,</p>
<p>and cats toy with us with this one,</p>
<p>because there are those cats that let you pet them,</p>
<p>but most of the time, they&rsquo;re doing it to you,</p>
<p>and then they withdraw.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know many dogs that do that.</p>
<p>So I think people, I&rsquo;m gonna answer the question finally,</p>
<p>I think dogs, we love them so much</p>
<p>because they let us pet them as much as we want.</p>
<p>And cats play this very diabolical game</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot more like human relationships.</p>
<p>How can night owls best function</p>
<p>in a society made for mourning birds?</p>
<p>Can you change your chronotype,</p>
<p>or do us night owls just have to suffer?</p>
<p>Okay, well, as a former night owl,</p>
<p>I used to work long hours in the lab.</p>
<p>I still work long hours, but less in the lab,</p>
<p>just so happens, that&rsquo;s the way the career goes.</p>
<p>I put tinfoil on the windows, I would lock the doors,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d blast the music, and I would stay there</p>
<p>over the holidays until I had to go home</p>
<p>just for the holiday events, and my clock would drift.</p>
<p>So I became a night owl, and then my clock would flip,</p>
<p>and everyone was gone, your mind gets really tweaked</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not interacting with anybody.</p>
<p>By the way, seeing faces in the morning,</p>
<p>and seeing faces at some point during the day,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re ready to face the day,</p>
<p>very important for mental health.</p>
<p>This is something I wish more people knew about.</p>
<p>It also, and here I&rsquo;m not trying to evoke</p>
<p>any kind of sentimentality, but when you think about people</p>
<p>who just are clearly not doing well,</p>
<p>whether or not they have shelter or not,</p>
<p>how often do we actually make direct eye contact nowadays?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very often.</p>
<p>So eye contact is important, but I&rsquo;ve also shifted</p>
<p>to being a morning person, and so here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>If you are a true night owl,</p>
<p>that means that your circadian clock,</p>
<p>meaning the genes that control the area of your brain</p>
<p>and your hypothalamus that controls sleep cycles,</p>
<p>is fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Very unlikely you&rsquo;ll become a morning person</p>
<p>without being a kind of angry morning person.</p>
<p>So you can use that argument, and you can cite me.</p>
<p>However, as we get older, it is true</p>
<p>that the amount of slow-wave sleep to REM sleep</p>
<p>tends to change, and we can do better</p>
<p>on shorter bouts of sleep, mostly because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting less rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>and even if we try, we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Those people would probably be better off</p>
<p>sticking to a limited amount of sleep at night,</p>
<p>and then getting a short nap.</p>
<p>The rule with naps is nap if you want to,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t if you don&rsquo;t want, but not if it interferes</p>
<p>with your nighttime sleep, and if you can&rsquo;t nap,</p>
<p>do some sort of non-sleep deep rest, or NSDR,</p>
<p>as I refer to it, non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>So you can probably shift your clock</p>
<p>by anywhere from two to eight hours,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s true for jet lag as well.</p>
<p>Light is going to be the best way,</p>
<p>but if you really want to shift,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to stack the big three or four.</p>
<p>Light, so get light when you want to be awake.</p>
<p>Temperature, you have to increase</p>
<p>your body temperature to wake up.</p>
<p>You have to decrease body temperature to go to sleep.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, if you get into an ice bath or cold shower,</p>
<p>you get very, very cold, but then what happens?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like putting an ice pack on the thermostat.</p>
<p>Your body temperature goes up.</p>
<p>Remember, thermogenesis, that&rsquo;s the warming</p>
<p>of the body in response to cold.</p>
<p>Of course, if you stay in a long time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get crispy cold, you&rsquo;ll turn into a popsicle.</p>
<p>But the idea is that if you take a cold shower</p>
<p>and you get some bright light and you get some exercise</p>
<p>and you drink some caffeine, you can train your system</p>
<p>to expect that at a certain time of day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll want to go to sleep a little bit earlier</p>
<p>or much earlier and you&rsquo;ll want to wake up</p>
<p>when you stack those things.</p>
<p>But that also means not taking caffeine and cold showers</p>
<p>and doing exercise late at night,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s gonna take some work.</p>
<p>But those are the big four.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be light is the most powerful way to shift.</p>
<p>More light, awake.</p>
<p>Less light, asleep.</p>
<p>Temperature increase, awake.</p>
<p>Temperature decrease, asleep.</p>
<p>Food is the other one.</p>
<p>Eating, you can force yourself to eat breakfast</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not a breakfast eater.</p>
<p>This works when you travel too,</p>
<p>just get onto the local meal schedule</p>
<p>because you have a clock system in your gut,</p>
<p>believe it or not.</p>
<p>You want to synchronize that with your brain.</p>
<p>And then activity, getting some sort of exercise.</p>
<p>But it takes a little bit of work, but you can do it.</p>
<p>You can definitely do it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re nocturnal, that&rsquo;s weird,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s because of your work,</p>
<p>in which case there are tools for shift work</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve put out there on the podcast.</p>
<p>Your podcast has been a wild success.</p>
<p>How do you see it growing over the next few years?</p>
<p>Honestly, I try and live in the tunnel</p>
<p>of lack of understanding and awareness</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening with all this.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>Lex suggested we do the podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a true story, doing it.</p>
<p>I still really do feel very much like I did</p>
<p>when I was a little kid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna keep trying to learn and share.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for people to share the tools.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want credit for them.</p>
<p>If people credit us, great.</p>
<p>But if you think about it, most of what we talk about</p>
<p>are not things that you buy.</p>
<p>These are tools that, again, work the first time,</p>
<p>every time.</p>
<p>I always say behavioral tools first,</p>
<p>then nutrition, supplementation,</p>
<p>and then for some people, prescription drugs</p>
<p>or some of these more experimental drugs make sense.</p>
<p>For some people, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>For instance, I don&rsquo;t think kids</p>
<p>should be doing psychedelics.</p>
<p>I mean, childhood is enough of a psychedelic experience</p>
<p>in and of itself.</p>
<p>But I had an amazing clinician.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually a triple board certified psychiatrist,</p>
<p>neurologist at Stanford, Nolan Williams, on the podcast.</p>
<p>And he talked about even the use of Ibogaine and MDMA,</p>
<p>even in some younger populations,</p>
<p>but again, with therapeutic oversight.</p>
<p>It blew my mind.</p>
<p>I also didn&rsquo;t know this, that MDMA, I thought, was toxic.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t just take it off the street,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re interested in clinical trials,</p>
<p>there are great clinical trials happening through maps</p>
<p>and you can look at Nolan&rsquo;s website as well.</p>
<p>Most of the knowledge about the effects of MDMA</p>
<p>is from the LDS community</p>
<p>because they volunteered for these studies</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not on the banned substance list.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of knowledge</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t use other substances</p>
<p>like alcohol and marijuana and cocaine.</p>
<p>So much of what we know about the effects of MDMA</p>
<p>on the body and brain is from that community,</p>
<p>other communities too as well.</p>
<p>So what are we gonna do with the podcast?</p>
<p>Well, every Monday, I&rsquo;m gonna keep putting out episodes</p>
<p>until they put me in that grave with the thing.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a labor of love and it&rsquo;s a lot of fun</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just always trying to make them better, clearer.</p>
<p>Somehow they&rsquo;re not getting shorter.</p>
<p>I always tell Rob, this one&rsquo;s gonna be 90 minutes</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, yeah, I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it.</p>
<p>I think for me, one thing that it has brought</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really wonderful is the opportunity</p>
<p>to learn from people in other domains</p>
<p>that are far better at putting information</p>
<p>and things into the world.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been, I hope he doesn&rsquo;t mind me saying this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become really good friends with Rick Rubin</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been really helpful to me.</p>
<p>He has an amazing book on creativity coming out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a plug for the book,</p>
<p>although I guess I just kind of accidentally did it.</p>
<p>But Rick, of course, has produced and created</p>
<p>all this amazing music, everything from Run DMC,</p>
<p>BC Boys, Slayer, Johnny Cash, everything, just amazing.</p>
<p>And one of the things that he&rsquo;s been impressing on me</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s very important to stay focused</p>
<p>on the process of what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and to really not get into too much of what that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>how that&rsquo;s landing.</p>
<p>So I do like to hear when things are not clear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really helpful to me.</p>
<p>I do like to hear suggestions about great people</p>
<p>to bring on the podcast.</p>
<p>I love criticism, most of the time.</p>
<p>I try my best, it&rsquo;s hard sometimes,</p>
<p>but I really try and just absorb it for what it is.</p>
<p>But I love that aspect of interacting in this,</p>
<p>even though this is fairly unidirectional.</p>
<p>Hopefully there&rsquo;ll be more opportunities</p>
<p>for kind of dialoguing and learning what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>My real hope is that practitioners</p>
<p>will start to incorporate things.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s not about me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gleaning from fields and the work</p>
<p>and discoveries of other people</p>
<p>and trying to thread across fields.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I see the podcast going,</p>
<p>just more of the same, more of the same, more of the same,</p>
<p>but a lot more and more topics as best we can,</p>
<p>lots of guests.</p>
<p>And we actually have an episode with Rick coming out</p>
<p>at some point about creativity,</p>
<p>which I think is one of the more interesting aspects</p>
<p>of our being.</p>
<p>So you watch for that.</p>
<p>What is a stress inoculation protocol</p>
<p>for the workplace anxiety?</p>
<p>Speaking, does the principle of staying calm</p>
<p>under high adrenaline states?</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>I think if you were to pick some sort of practice</p>
<p>that you could do privately and safely,</p>
<p>again, how cold should you make the water?</p>
<p>Cold enough that it&rsquo;s really uncomfortable</p>
<p>and you really, really wanna get out,</p>
<p>but you can safely stay in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we never say 40 degrees,</p>
<p>because you can kill yourself with cold water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard to do.</p>
<p>You have to get really, really cold</p>
<p>before you kill yourself.</p>
<p>And open bodies of water aren&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>Actually, I told my friend Samer Hattar,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the director of Chronobiology Unit</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Mental Health.</p>
<p>He came on the podcast, got him really excited.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s great about all the stuff on light and sleep,</p>
<p>taught me a lot of that over the years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good friends.</p>
<p>I told him about the cold water thing</p>
<p>and he got into some river in Bethesda</p>
<p>and almost drowned.</p>
<p>And Samer, now he has this story</p>
<p>about how he almost drowned and what he was,</p>
<p>and he thought about a paper he wanted to write</p>
<p>while he was almost drowning.</p>
<p>So just be careful, open bodies of water,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But I think you can quickly see within about a week or so</p>
<p>of doing some sort of deliberate adrenaline release.</p>
<p>It could be cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>25 hyperventilated breaths with a short breath hold repeat</p>
<p>done two or three times.</p>
<p>We have good data to support that in the lab.</p>
<p>You see massive shifts in people&rsquo;s baseline level.</p>
<p>You become a little bit more like Costello.</p>
<p>You really do.</p>
<p>And the way to think about it is</p>
<p>if you are more on a seesaw than on the continuum,</p>
<p>you get better at loosening that hinge</p>
<p>and controlling that hinge.</p>
<p>Or you can imagine kind of moving up and down that seesaw</p>
<p>a little bit more easily.</p>
<p>And then of course you have to place yourself</p>
<p>into the environment.</p>
<p>You have to test yourself in that environment.</p>
<p>And some people will do Toastmasters and things like that</p>
<p>and it can work.</p>
<p>My way, I don&rsquo;t know if it works for everybody,</p>
<p>but my way is just start talking, don&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t feel the stress.</p>
<p>What do you think will be the next hot topic,</p>
<p>new trend in the field of neuroscience behavioral therapies?</p>
<p>Ooh, I like that.</p>
<p>Because I have a lot of opinions about that.</p>
<p>First of all, I do not think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be brain machine interface.</p>
<p>My good friend, Eddie Chang,</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ve known since we were nine,</p>
<p>he came on the podcast.</p>
<p>He works on epilepsy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the chair of neurosurgery.</p>
<p>We had a bird club when we were kids.</p>
<p>Had two members.</p>
<p>You had to know the names of all the talking birds.</p>
<p>And then you had to know which one was the best talker</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the myna bird.</p>
<p>And of course no one wanted to join.</p>
<p>No one even took the test.</p>
<p>But he became a neurosurgeon</p>
<p>and does brain machine interface.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing truly incredible work</p>
<p>getting people with locked-in syndrome</p>
<p>to speak through a device implanted under the skull.</p>
<p>They just think what they wanna say.</p>
<p>These are people who haven&rsquo;t moved</p>
<p>or shared a word with anybody</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re now communicating.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>And that he has also realized</p>
<p>that facial expression is a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to see on a screen</p>
<p>what somebody in a chair or a hospital bed is thinking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>But facial expression is such a rich part of this.</p>
<p>So this is a really good use of AI.</p>
<p>He has now created very realistic</p>
<p>iPad images of that person&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re actually speaking the words.</p>
<p>And people form a deep relationship</p>
<p>to the person who&rsquo;s right next to their avatar.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a positive use, I think, of avatars.</p>
<p>And Eddie&rsquo;s doing amazing work.</p>
<p>That kind of work, a brain machine interface,</p>
<p>neural link, et cetera,</p>
<p>I think is going to be very useful</p>
<p>and popular in the realm of therapeutics</p>
<p>for Parkinson&rsquo;s, movement disorders,</p>
<p>epilepsy, locked-in syndrome, et cetera.</p>
<p>I think we are many, many, many decades</p>
<p>from chip implantation into the brain</p>
<p>for things like enhancing memory.</p>
<p>And frankly, I wouldn&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>Not because I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna enhance my memory,</p>
<p>but because of what I said earlier,</p>
<p>is that the nervous system</p>
<p>has a certain amount of real estate,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to make that real estate very lopsided.</p>
<p>And so I think we&rsquo;re going to see something very different</p>
<p>in the next 10, 20 years.</p>
<p>And I hope, hope, hope this carries over</p>
<p>to younger populations.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going to hopefully start learning</p>
<p>about our nervous system and what it can do.</p>
<p>And the fact that we have these pre-existing circuits in us</p>
<p>that we can learn to leverage</p>
<p>that work first time, every time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m strongly biased in my answer,</p>
<p>but I think that it still remains an open question,</p>
<p>for instance, whether or not people could require less,</p>
<p>perhaps, or no medication for certain things.</p>
<p>And I say certain things,</p>
<p>because for conditions like schizophrenia,</p>
<p>bipolar in particular, medication,</p>
<p>OCD has proved very effective.</p>
<p>But then there are a whole other set of conditions</p>
<p>like depression and anxiety,</p>
<p>for which behavioral tools really work,</p>
<p>but most people just don&rsquo;t even know they exist.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my hope.</p>
<p>And again, I love the therapeutic community</p>
<p>could try and expand their toolkit.</p>
<p>I also think we&rsquo;re starting to see a blurring of the lines</p>
<p>between different fields of psychology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s no longer psychoanalytic versus cognitive behavioral</p>
<p>versus dialectic versus EMDR versus hypnosis,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s all going to be governed</p>
<p>by some central principles.</p>
<p>All those camps, it&rsquo;s just silly, frankly,</p>
<p>it makes sense academically why those came to be.</p>
<p>But in neuroscience, we had the same thing.</p>
<p>You used to have to pick.</p>
<p>It was like a John Hughes film from the 80s.</p>
<p>Are you going to be a jock or a punker or a popular kid?</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not like that.</p>
<p>And half this audience is looking at me like,</p>
<p>what are you talking about?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly the point,</p>
<p>which is I&rsquo;ll never forget.</p>
<p>I grew up in the skateboard thing.</p>
<p>First time I saw someone wearing skateboarding shoes,</p>
<p>I was like, damn, they skateboard.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, no,</p>
<p>people are just wearing this stuff, right?</p>
<p>So what you started to realize is all blended together,</p>
<p>which is great.</p>
<p>And in the field of neuroscience, you used to have to pick.</p>
<p>Are you an anatomist or a physiologist?</p>
<p>Are you into neural computation?</p>
<p>Now your lab has to do it all,</p>
<p>or you collaborate with people.</p>
<p>Those divisions have really melted</p>
<p>because people are interested in questions</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re interested in answers.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t get me started,</p>
<p>but the careerism of the requirement</p>
<p>for everyone to have their own independent laboratory</p>
<p>and say, this is my mission,</p>
<p>that is one of the worst things about science</p>
<p>because everything we know says that collaboration,</p>
<p>collaboration, collaboration leads to faster progress.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna take on the whole academic system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been very good to me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to see a blurring of the boundaries.</p>
<p>It used to be that labs weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>here I&rsquo;m really guilty, Huberman Lab,</p>
<p>but it used to be that labs were named</p>
<p>after the problem they worked on.</p>
<p>Vision lab, stress lab, happiness lab.</p>
<p>I like that quite a bit more,</p>
<p>but I screwed up and called this whole thing</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab.</p>
<p>You had a number,</p>
<p>you have had a number of performance nutrition</p>
<p>and fitness experts on your show.</p>
<p>What changes have you made to your fitness protocol</p>
<p>including nutrition?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m an omnivore,</p>
<p>so I like those things they call carbohydrates.</p>
<p>And I eat them in moderation.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never really been too extreme about any of this</p>
<p>or the fasting thing,</p>
<p>although I do kind of just,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very hungry in the morning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also because I like to eat a lot at night.</p>
<p>I wake up not that hungry.</p>
<p>So what have I changed?</p>
<p>Well, in terms of the fitness stuff,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve definitely started to incorporate</p>
<p>more nasal breathing when I do cardiovascular work</p>
<p>because it has eliminated any sleep apnea I had.</p>
<p>And sleep apnea is very, very bad, very, very bad.</p>
<p>You know, I wish I could say snoring was no big deal,</p>
<p>but we know based on work at the Stanford Sleep Lab,</p>
<p>Penn Sleep Lab, other sleep labs</p>
<p>that people who have sleep apnea</p>
<p>are really in for trouble for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>So you want to learn to be a nasal breather.</p>
<p>And some people will tape their mouth shut</p>
<p>with medical tape when they go to sleep.</p>
<p>Other people will just start doing cardiovascular work,</p>
<p>keeping their mouth closed.</p>
<p>And that requires that you not go too intensely,</p>
<p>but it does create a dilation of the nasal passages.</p>
<p>Those sinuses can dilate.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve definitely done that.</p>
<p>And at the end of training,</p>
<p>I try and do a one minute or three minute decompress,</p>
<p>not immediately look at my phone</p>
<p>and learn to shift from high intensity kind of thinking</p>
<p>to lower intensity thinking and shift throughout the day.</p>
<p>Task switching I think is gonna be a big area of science</p>
<p>and neuroscience in general.</p>
<p>We still don&rsquo;t know how to task switch well,</p>
<p>how to shift the mind from focus to defocus and back again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but by the way, this is I think a rich opportunity</p>
<p>for people to develop tools.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know a lot about that.</p>
<p>We got too caught up on consciousness flow and free will.</p>
<p>And that stuff is great.</p>
<p>But I like, as you can tell, I like tools.</p>
<p>I like physiology.</p>
<p>I like the things that work in my lifetime</p>
<p>and that we can figure out and agree upon in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m told that this final question,</p>
<p>when they put the clock up here earlier too,</p>
<p>they said that we&rsquo;re gonna run it for 60 minutes.</p>
<p>My first question was, where&rsquo;s the snooze button?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna keep going,</p>
<p>but I think they&rsquo;re gonna hold me to it.</p>
<p>I know people, this is New York after all.</p>
<p>There are other fun things to do.</p>
<p>For things that take a long time,</p>
<p>career, pursuing a degree,</p>
<p>is there a right way to know that we&rsquo;re on the right path?</p>
<p>Is there a way to know we&rsquo;re on the right path?</p>
<p>Thank you for that question.</p>
<p>I get asked this a lot.</p>
<p>And gosh, there&rsquo;s so much information out there.</p>
<p>So much information about this.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t yet have a gauge</p>
<p>of whether or not we&rsquo;re in too much stress or not,</p>
<p>but there is one tool that&rsquo;s used</p>
<p>in the free diving community and in other communities</p>
<p>that you can use as a kind of thermometer</p>
<p>of how well you&rsquo;re functioning.</p>
<p>And some of you may know it already,</p>
<p>and if you do, forgive me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this carbon dioxide tolerance test.</p>
<p>So why am I answering this question this way?</p>
<p>Well, I like to start with actionable tools.</p>
<p>If for instance, you were to just take three or four breaths</p>
<p>and then take a big deep breath</p>
<p>and then do a very slow controlled exhale,</p>
<p>could be through your nose or through your mouth,</p>
<p>ideally through your nose,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to make that exhale as long as possible</p>
<p>until your lungs are empty and you time that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the carbon dioxide discard rate</p>
<p>or discard rate or the exhale discard rate.</p>
<p>And it tells you how well you&rsquo;re controlling your diaphragm</p>
<p>using something called the phrenic nerve.</p>
<p>It also tells you how well you&rsquo;re managing carbon dioxide</p>
<p>and how well you&rsquo;re managing stress.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re very stressed,</p>
<p>that number will be very, very short.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about how long</p>
<p>you can sit with lungs empty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about an honest appraisal</p>
<p>of how long you can control that exhale for.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s anywhere from zero to 20 seconds,</p>
<p>your stress level is high.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s from 20 to 40 seconds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s moderate and longer than 40 seconds</p>
<p>means you have good control</p>
<p>over your carbon dioxide system more or less.</p>
<p>Now these are averages and guess what?</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with fitness.</p>
<p>And also it has nothing to do with you per se,</p>
<p>because if you do this when you first wake up</p>
<p>after a good night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a long discard rate.</p>
<p>If you do this after running,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a short discard rate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not out of breath.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not managing the system very well.</p>
<p>So you can touch into this every once in a while</p>
<p>as sort of a blood pressure reading type thing.</p>
<p>This is very back of the envelope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it works well enough</p>
<p>that alongside things like resting heart rate,</p>
<p>heart rate variability, et cetera,</p>
<p>you can get a window into how well you&rsquo;re managing stress.</p>
<p>Why am I answering this question this way?</p>
<p>Well, this is something I recommend</p>
<p>doing every once in a while,</p>
<p>especially if you are in a period of a career</p>
<p>or any kind of pursuit</p>
<p>where you are feeling like you&rsquo;re grinding.</p>
<p>I think once your carbon dioxide discard rate</p>
<p>starts to really get shorter and shorter,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having trouble sleeping,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time to focus on reestablishing</p>
<p>that buoyancy to your nervous system</p>
<p>because then and only then can you make good judgments</p>
<p>about whether or not you&rsquo;re in the right trajectory for you.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of the larger psychological themes,</p>
<p>are you doing something that brings you meaning or not?</p>
<p>That gets into some complicated territory.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very good at assigning meaning retrospectively</p>
<p>and saying, well, that was a good experience</p>
<p>because we had it and we learned from it, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I think most people would like to avoid things</p>
<p>that they can only look back on</p>
<p>and say it was useful because I learned something from it.</p>
<p>And for that, I&rsquo;ll just give the default,</p>
<p>but I think, at least to me, accurate answer,</p>
<p>which is the more often that you can tap into that feeling</p>
<p>of excitement and delight in your work,</p>
<p>even if from small things or from surprising things</p>
<p>or from the social interactions</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re able to glean from that work,</p>
<p>the longer and better you&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to pursue that line of work.</p>
<p>For me, in graduate school, I was very isolated.</p>
<p>I worked alone in the lab.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because of the tinfoil I put on the walls</p>
<p>or the windows.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>In fact, my graduate advisor&rsquo;s one complaint</p>
<p>was that I seemed unfriendly.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t unfriendly, I was just busy.</p>
<p>But I got to be very good friends with the janitorial staff</p>
<p>because they were the only one around</p>
<p>at the time I was working, were a few other people.</p>
<p>And those small interactions actually became</p>
<p>very significant to me and became sources of brief,</p>
<p>but to me, at least at the time,</p>
<p>meaningful social exchange.</p>
<p>And of course, eventually I made friends</p>
<p>and had relationships of other kinds</p>
<p>and things that were healthy as well.</p>
<p>But I think learning to tap into this love</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re doing is sometimes hard,</p>
<p>but you have to look for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an active process.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll default to the work and the podcast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming with Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>And a lot of what he talks about in terms of creativity</p>
<p>is about accessing what he and others have talked about</p>
<p>as the source.</p>
<p>If that is an abstract, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>
<p>But the source is this ability to see yourself</p>
<p>as more of a portal for getting certain things done</p>
<p>in the world than being so careerist</p>
<p>and focused on whether or not outcomes</p>
<p>are really matching what you need.</p>
<p>It involves some mental flexibility</p>
<p>and is, of course, okay to pivot back and forth.</p>
<p>But we can only access this feeling of delight and joy</p>
<p>and this feeling that we&rsquo;re somehow connected</p>
<p>to some larger theme, aka meaning,</p>
<p>I think, when we are able to be calm enough</p>
<p>and not so focused.</p>
<p>But in order to get anything done,</p>
<p>we have to be hyper-focused.</p>
<p>And that brings me back to the basic principle</p>
<p>of today&rsquo;s whole discussion,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s not about landing yourself</p>
<p>in a state of focus, motivation, and drive,</p>
<p>or in a state of deep sleep, certainly not in a coma.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about being able to move up and down</p>
<p>the various continuums that allow you to access focus</p>
<p>and real gas pedal down to the floor</p>
<p>kind of thinking and action,</p>
<p>but then also deliberately back off,</p>
<p>transition to periods of rest.</p>
<p>And the real key is for you to feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re in the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>If we know anything from the last 100 plus years</p>
<p>of psychology and neuroscience literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that if an animal or a person feels</p>
<p>that they are in control of the physiological process</p>
<p>within them, and they know they can get themselves out</p>
<p>some way, somehow, at some point,</p>
<p>and back into a state that they want somehow,</p>
<p>some way, at some point,</p>
<p>well then, all the language around meaning</p>
<p>and happiness and delight starts to emerge.</p>
<p>So learn to move along those continuums,</p>
<p>learn to do it deliberately,</p>
<p>and I wish you the very best of luck in it.</p>
<p>I know it works.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>

<p>And grateful to our sponsors, of course.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And to all of you for your time.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a lot to do in this city</p>
<p>and I hope everyone enjoys it.</p>
<p>And of course, I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
