    <p>Hello, dear listener. I&rsquo;m Megan, host of this series. And before we get into the show,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a minute to tell you about our sponsor, FIRE, the Foundation for Individual</p>
<p>Rights and Expression. We live in a moment when free speech, the bedrock of our democracy</p>
<p>and of all free societies, is often viewed as suspect, where many argue that the right</p>
<p>to free speech is too dangerous, and that even listening to ideological opponents is</p>
<p>morally wrong. Many people just don&rsquo;t see a problem with using the law, corporate power,</p>
<p>and even extraordinary social pressure to censor viewpoints they disagree with. But</p>
<p>many of us feel the costs of all this in our everyday lives. We feel it when we self-censor,</p>
<p>afraid to say what we really think, sometimes even in private conversations with friends</p>
<p>or loved ones. We feel it when we opt out of a growing number of public discussions,</p>
<p>afraid of the potential cost to our jobs and even our relationships. FIRE shares a mission</p>
<p>with this show, to remind us why a culture of free speech and open dialogue matters.</p>
<p>And regardless of how loud the calls for censorship are, FIRE&rsquo;s defense of that culture is unshakable</p>
<p>and invaluable. And if you want to remember why we choose freedom, even for people we</p>
<p>strenuously disagree with, you can learn more about FIRE&rsquo;s incredible work at thefire.org.</p>
<p>And now, on to the show.</p>
<p>If you find yourself, as I did, in Edinburgh, Scotland,</p>
<p>and you walk west from Lawn Market, up a cobblestone street to Castle Hill,</p>
<p>there, in the shadow of an ancient castle, on most days, you&rsquo;ll find a tour guide wearing a black, pointy witch&rsquo;s hat.</p>
<p>Now, aren&rsquo;t we so lucky? We live in a time where we&rsquo;re free to say the word witch,</p>
<p>to even be witch, if we so wish. Others throughout the ages were not so lucky, as you will find out.</p>
<p>The tourists gather around her, forming a little half-moon, as they pull out their phones and cameras</p>
<p>to take pictures of a small stone monument.</p>
<p>Now, here we&rsquo;ve got the Witches&rsquo; Well. This is a little monument put up in order to honour</p>
<p>all of those people who were executed as witches.</p>
<p>The Witches&rsquo; Well commemorates an especially deadly series of witch hunts,</p>
<p>and is dedicated to those who were put to death, many in this very place, centuries ago.</p>
<p>They were tied to stakes, they were strangled, and then they were burnt as witches.</p>
<p>Throughout Scotland, more than 4,000 people were accused of being witches,</p>
<p>and more than half of them were executed.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exact numbers, because in some accounts it just says,</p>
<p>Sundry Witches, not even dignifying them with a name.</p>
<p>These sorts of witch trials have occurred throughout human history and around the world,</p>
<p>where someone, most often a woman, was accused by her community, by her neighbours,</p>
<p>sometimes by her own husband or children, of being a witch,</p>
<p>which left her with a terrible decision.</p>
<p>She could confess and beg for mercy from the authorities,</p>
<p>which, in some cases, spared her life.</p>
<p>But in others, only confirmed her guilt, and led to her execution.</p>
<p>Or, she could stand firm through her interrogation,</p>
<p>and often torture, and say to the crowd,</p>
<p>I am not what you say I am.</p>
<p>Though this was often seen as a prideful lack of repentance,</p>
<p>which could also lead to her execution.</p>
<p>Regardless of her choice, she was a witch.</p>
<p>Regardless of her choice, one feature of many of these witch hunts</p>
<p>was that the very accusation itself was ultimately her condemnation.</p>
<p>Hi, Megan.</p>
<p>Hi, Stacey. Thank you so much for speaking with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to join you.</p>
<p>This is Stacey Schiff, Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer</p>
<p>and author of The Witches, Salem, 1692.</p>
<p>Stacey, you published this book in 2016,</p>
<p>and I just wonder, was there something specific that made you want to</p>
<p>research and write this book about witch trials at this specific moment in time?</p>
<p>There just seemed to me to be so many obvious and not so obvious parallels</p>
<p>between that moment and basically what we do today on social media.</p>
<p>And I think what I was most struck by was the sense that</p>
<p>oral culture and social media were very similar,</p>
<p>and the ability to slander someone,</p>
<p>to just really decimate someone&rsquo;s reputation very easily,</p>
<p>was something that was a constant between 1692</p>
<p>and the world in which we were then living when I started writing.</p>
<p>In America, the witch trials that occurred in Salem, Massachusetts</p>
<p>are by far the most infamous.</p>
<p>It was there that a zealous group of fundamentalists, the Puritans,</p>
<p>turned on one another,</p>
<p>and in the span of months, accused over 200 people of witchcraft.</p>
<p>And as Stacey writes in her book,</p>
<p>one of the forces behind this panic</p>
<p>was an almost paranoid sense of constant danger.</p>
<p>One can&rsquo;t overstate how important was the concept of watchfulness.</p>
<p>You were meant to be always watchful, always vigilant,</p>
<p>not only for the sake of your soul,</p>
<p>but obviously in the Massachusetts incarnation,</p>
<p>for the sake of your safety.</p>
<p>The Puritans believed that evil was lurking all around them,</p>
<p>constantly tempting them with sinfulness that could damn their souls.</p>
<p>But also, because they were living on the edge of this new colony,</p>
<p>in a land whose native people were hostile to their presence,</p>
<p>they were also living constantly on guard</p>
<p>against a real threat of physical danger.</p>
<p>But there was always a sense that you were under assault,</p>
<p>or that you were likely to be infiltrated,</p>
<p>or that the enemy was just beyond your means.</p>
<p>So there is this constant sense of being on the watchtowers.</p>
<p>And needless to say, when you&rsquo;re watching for something,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re watching vigilantly for something,</p>
<p>you often see something.</p>
<p>But Stacy&rsquo;s book makes clear</p>
<p>just how different the people of Salem were</p>
<p>from the image of the ignorant, pitchfork-wielding mob.</p>
<p>In fact, they could be obsessive about reading and legal theory.</p>
<p>And the witch trial judges themselves were well-educated men,</p>
<p>a number of them at Harvard.</p>
<p>I think one of the oddities about New England in the 17th century</p>
<p>and the question of witchcraft</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re talking about one of the most literate communities</p>
<p>in the history of the world,</p>
<p>possibly the most literate community</p>
<p>in the history of the world until that time.</p>
<p>It was imperative that everyone pray,</p>
<p>and in order to pray, one had to read.</p>
<p>So the literacy rate was tremendously high.</p>
<p>Moreover, the people who were the witchcraft experts that year,</p>
<p>which is largely, to say, the clergy,</p>
<p>are all of them immensely erudite people,</p>
<p>who have read everything that was to be read</p>
<p>on the subject of witchcraft.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a funny paradox in the sense that you have</p>
<p>the members of the community who are invested most</p>
<p>in this, what we would today call, delusion.</p>
<p>Those individuals are, in fact, the best-read,</p>
<p>most highly-educated members of the community.</p>
<p>And what role did courts and laws</p>
<p>and the concept of justice play in this society?</p>
<p>Justice is central to Puritanism.</p>
<p>The court records from the early years of New England</p>
<p>were incredibly comprehensive,</p>
<p>and you see that even in the absence of lawyers,</p>
<p>because there were no lawyers yet at this point</p>
<p>in Massachusetts history,</p>
<p>you have a very, very law-loving, court-loving society.</p>
<p>And because they were so literate and so litigious,</p>
<p>Stacey Schiff, in researching her book,</p>
<p>was able to read their letters, their journals,</p>
<p>their court records, and gain a deeper insight</p>
<p>into how they understood themselves.</p>
<p>In your best judgment, what do you think</p>
<p>is the most gracious understanding</p>
<p>of what they thought they were up to</p>
<p>when they prosecuted these witches?</p>
<p>I think that what we tend to forget</p>
<p>is how strongly the belief in witchcraft</p>
<p>really penetrates this community,</p>
<p>and how thoroughly, and I think profoundly,</p>
<p>everyone involved believed that he was doing something</p>
<p>that was good for the community.</p>
<p>We have some indication that they were unclear</p>
<p>about how to prosecute witchcraft,</p>
<p>and they will at times, one justice in particular,</p>
<p>they at times will appeal to the ministry</p>
<p>to ask what kind of evidence they can rely upon</p>
<p>in the courtroom, and how a witchcraft diagnosis</p>
<p>could and should be made.</p>
<p>And obviously, there were people here</p>
<p>who must have trumped up charges,</p>
<p>but for the most part,</p>
<p>all of the judicial techniques</p>
<p>that should have been followed were followed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fascinating, again,</p>
<p>because when we think about witch trials,</p>
<p>looking back, we assume, I mean,</p>
<p>the idea that they would be strenuously adhering</p>
<p>to the rules of evidence and things</p>
<p>that they had in place at the time,</p>
<p>that they were really trying to do the right thing,</p>
<p>in other words, that&rsquo;s not the image that we get.</p>
<p>No, but you can see them grappling,</p>
<p>you can see them grappling with their consciences,</p>
<p>and you can see them grappling with the testimony.</p>
<p>I mean, Arthur Miller actually makes</p>
<p>an interesting point when he&rsquo;s talking about the crucible,</p>
<p>and he talks about something which is so true</p>
<p>of that year in Salem, which is that you,</p>
<p>in the course of these kinds of prosecutions,</p>
<p>you can take on the characteristics</p>
<p>of the thing that you abhor.</p>
<p>You become the thing that you most fear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the scariest part of all this, right?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>You could have people who are, again,</p>
<p>very smart, very well-educated,</p>
<p>very dedicated to the idea of justice,</p>
<p>to the idea that they want to do the right thing,</p>
<p>and to be searching themselves so deeply</p>
<p>for what the right answer is and how they should behave,</p>
<p>and to still come to this kind of horrifying conclusion</p>
<p>where you have 19 people hanged,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a terrifying thing to realize</p>
<p>about what it means to be human.</p>
<p>After you have done all of your homework,</p>
<p>asked all of the authorities for their help,</p>
<p>and essentially scoured your soul,</p>
<p>and you still can make that kind of colossal error.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was so ill-equipped for what happened to me.</p>
<p>I was living in a state of real tension</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t express to many people.</p>
<p>So, looking back, would you say that</p>
<p>the Christian parents were maybe part of a moral panic?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. It&rsquo;s a scary world out there.</p>
<p>People can make mistakes. People can do bad things.</p>
<p>In fact, show me the human being who hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trashing someone, but you feel like you&rsquo;re crusading.</p>
<p>I believe absolutely that there is something</p>
<p>dangerous about this movement.</p>
<p>Someone like her, she really is just truly at the heart.</p>
<p>Bigoted, hiding in this sheep&rsquo;s costume,</p>
<p>pretending that she is an ally.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to have your views challenged.</p>
<p>Completely. I&rsquo;m looking at this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking, am I missing something?</p>
<p>Just the opposite of everything that she wrote into those books.</p>
<p>I have a lot of hope for her.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a part of me that still cares what she thinks, you know?</p>
<p>Chapter 7. What if you&rsquo;re wrong?</p>
<p>Months after my first visit,</p>
<p>my producers and I went back to Scotland,</p>
<p>back to Rowling&rsquo;s home,</p>
<p>back to her drawing room</p>
<p>with her color-coordinated books</p>
<p>to have one more conversation with her for this series.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask her some of the questions from her critics</p>
<p>and to help me understand how she,</p>
<p>someone who has devoted so much of her life&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>to exploring human nature,</p>
<p>grapples with the fact</p>
<p>that she might be wrong.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gathered here today.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>To record round two.</p>
<p>Sounds good. Okay.</p>
<p>What do you think is the crux of the difference</p>
<p>between what you believe and what your critics say you believe?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I mean, the crux, there&rsquo;s an abyss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been accused.</p>
<p>I have to laugh because the hyperbole is so extreme.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told I wish for the genocide of trans people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told, well, you want them to die.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want them to exist.</p>
<p>And that, I think, is where we become&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even infuriated.</p>
<p>Sometimes you feel a little despair.</p>
<p>You think, well, maybe we need the storm to break</p>
<p>and for people to say,</p>
<p>but wait a moment, we do need to ask questions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen thousands of percent increase</p>
<p>in young women trying to escape their physical bodies.</p>
<p>Should we not be asking why that&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>I think the idea is that you have become,</p>
<p>for a lot of people, you know, the word is problematic,</p>
<p>that you might think of yourself as raising these valid concerns,</p>
<p>but they will criticize either the way you&rsquo;ve gone about it</p>
<p>or the timing of it or the language you&rsquo;ve used,</p>
<p>and much more.</p>
<p>But before we get into some specifics,</p>
<p>I did just want to ask, at this point,</p>
<p>how does it feel that there is this gulf</p>
<p>between how you see yourself</p>
<p>and how many other people now see you?</p>
<p>This will sound like an indirect answer,</p>
<p>but I promise you it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If I think about the people I most admire,</p>
<p>actually, even the writers I most admire,</p>
<p>when it mattered, they stood up.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t sit at home and, you know,</p>
<p>worry about their royalties</p>
<p>or worry about their public image greatly.</p>
<p>Not that I seek to be controversial.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s as embarrassing as seeking to be some sort of perfect.</p>
<p>I never wanted to be famous.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re very invested in that,</p>
<p>then, of course, this is going to destroy you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say this in any self-aggrandizing way,</p>
<p>but I think it could have destroyed some people.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re very invested,</p>
<p>what has happened to me in the last few years,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no hope that you will come out of it</p>
<p>with your mental health intact</p>
<p>or that you wouldn&rsquo;t be, you know,</p>
<p>offering fulsome apologies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned. I&rsquo;ve done better.</p>
<p>Whether you mean it or not, you know that.</p>
<p>But no, I have learned.</p>
<p>I did my learning before I spoke.</p>
<p>Everyone can do better.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t set out to cause pain,</p>
<p>but I see pain being caused</p>
<p>and I think damage being caused to women and girls,</p>
<p>and I just can&rsquo;t sit here and not speak.</p>
<p>One of your critics is a trans woman named Natalie Wynn,</p>
<p>who goes by the name ContraPoints on YouTube,</p>
<p>and she made a long video essay critiquing your views</p>
<p>on trans issues.</p>
<p>And in it, she goes through how she understands bigotry,</p>
<p>which she breaks down into two categories,</p>
<p>direct bigotry and indirect bigotry.</p>
<p>Direct bigotry is the sort of thing that my family does,</p>
<p>being openly contemptuous and using slurs</p>
<p>and demonizing people, marginalizing people openly.</p>
<p>And indirect bigotry is things like</p>
<p>people are just asking questions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just concerned.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re engaging in debate.</p>
<p>Activists have gone too far.</p>
<p>Political correctness, cancel culture.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s the idea that there are bad actors</p>
<p>who can hide behind virtues or less extreme rhetoric,</p>
<p>but who are still undermining people&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>I see this constantly,</p>
<p>and the most frequent example of that</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re pretending to be concerned about children.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the children.</p>
<p>They really hate trans people.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re saying that indirect bigotry</p>
<p>is asking questions where you believe</p>
<p>significant harm is done, if you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>indirect bigotry is standing up for women&rsquo;s rights,</p>
<p>then you know what? Guilty as charged.</p>
<p>I think it is a very bad faith argument to say that people</p>
<p>who are asking questions are being indirect bigots</p>
<p>because, you know, that itself, in my view,</p>
<p>is a very bad faith position.</p>
<p>Do you think that some people do use those kinds of,</p>
<p>like, I guess I&rsquo;m thinking here of, like, actual people</p>
<p>that most people would recognize as bigots?</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone in the world,</p>
<p>bar literal psychopaths and clear terrible predators,</p>
<p>are concerned about harm to children, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a very common human trait.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a human trait to want to protect the vulnerable.</p>
<p>And children are very vulnerable.</p>
<p>The trouble is, you see,</p>
<p>one may use concern about children</p>
<p>to justify other actions.</p>
<p>You know, QAnon felt that children</p>
<p>were being trafficked and raped.</p>
<p>One may be concerned about children and be correct.</p>
<p>People around Jimmy Savile,</p>
<p>the UK&rsquo;s most famous predator,</p>
<p>believed children were being harmed,</p>
<p>but his celebrity and his ability to raise money</p>
<p>for charity was such that nobody wanted to look into that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s as simple as saying people are using it.</p>
<p>Some people may genuinely believe children are being harmed</p>
<p>and also genuinely not want anyone to be trans.</p>
<p>That is not my position.</p>
<p>You have said that you respect trans people.</p>
<p>You said that you would march with them,</p>
<p>that you think the transition is right for some people.</p>
<p>But you also say that there&rsquo;s a real difference</p>
<p>between biological women and trans women,</p>
<p>and a meaningful distinction between the two</p>
<p>in their experiences.</p>
<p>And I think some of your critics point to that and say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially making trans women second-class women.</p>
<p>You know, like, you&rsquo;re almost women.</p>
<p>Despite all of their efforts to live in the world as women,</p>
<p>as what feels right and authentic to them,</p>
<p>you are essentially saying, I&rsquo;ll treat you as a woman.</p>
<p>You are an honorary woman.</p>
<p>But this distinction that you are emphasizing,</p>
<p>the biological distinction that you see as being so important,</p>
<p>it can feel hurtful to them.</p>
<p>Like, they are, you know, almost a thing, but not quite.</p>
<p>Like, something is being held back.</p>
<p>Can you understand the pain that that could cause?</p>
<p>Yes, is the short answer. Yes, I can understand that hurt.</p>
<p>The thing is, women are the only group, to my knowledge,</p>
<p>that are being asked to embrace members of their oppressor class</p>
<p>unquestioningly, with no caveat.</p>
<p>Now, on an individual basis,</p>
<p>and I think many people new to this argument</p>
<p>would see it on that level,</p>
<p>because many people of my generation particularly</p>
<p>think that we&rsquo;re talking about old-school transsexuals,</p>
<p>sex reassignment, because of profound gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>And I feel 100% compassion for such people,</p>
<p>and I would absolutely respect their pronouns,</p>
<p>always have, always will,</p>
<p>and would want, as I say them, to have comfortable, easy lives.</p>
<p>This movement, though, is pressing for something different,</p>
<p>very different.</p>
<p>This movement has argued, continues to argue,</p>
<p>that a man may have had no surgery whatsoever,</p>
<p>that he feels himself to be a woman,</p>
<p>the door of every woman&rsquo;s bathroom, changing room,</p>
<p>rape centre should be open to him.</p>
<p>And I say no. I&rsquo;m afraid I say no.</p>
<p>And we are in a cultural moment where that individual&rsquo;s hurt</p>
<p>is being prioritised over the hurt of women</p>
<p>whose rights and boundaries are under sustained assault.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s interesting to ask why</p>
<p>the pain of one group is being prioritised</p>
<p>over the pain of other groups.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe a simpler way to ask it is that,</p>
<p>is there a way in your mind to respect both pains,</p>
<p>even though at some point obviously there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a moment where action or decision has to be made?</p>
<p>I do believe that there is a way forward</p>
<p>in which women and girls retain their existing rights,</p>
<p>and trans people are properly protected.</p>
<p>There is a way, absolutely a way, to respect both points,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;re currently unfortunately at a place</p>
<p>where that is very difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>I believe feminists have tried very hard</p>
<p>to have this discussion.</p>
<p>How do we ensure everyone&rsquo;s rights and safety?</p>
<p>Where does fairness lie?</p>
<p>For example, in issues like sport,</p>
<p>this one that&rsquo;s getting a lot of publicity at the moment,</p>
<p>feminists are asking for certain spaces,</p>
<p>rape shelters would be a very obvious example,</p>
<p>to remain female only, or to have separate provision</p>
<p>for both groups, because I don&rsquo;t know a single feminist</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge that trans people also, of course,</p>
<p>are victims of sexual violence.</p>
<p>But at the moment, there seems to be a very</p>
<p>black and white view on the other side of the argument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything or nothing.</p>
<p>When it comes to the bathroom question,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve heard from a lot of people that essentially</p>
<p>the risks just don&rsquo;t seem very high to them.</p>
<p>Many of them can understand why males and females</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be housed in the same prison cells,</p>
<p>but when it comes to bathrooms, there already aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>guards at the door and nobody&rsquo;s checking before we go in,</p>
<p>and essentially a bad actor would come in regardless</p>
<p>I agree quite strongly on that. There is a social taboo.</p>
<p>There has been until very recently, historically,</p>
<p>there has been a social taboo, so that if my husband</p>
<p>decided that he wanted to use the ladies&rsquo; bathroom,</p>
<p>the women inside would feel confident in challenging</p>
<p>his right to be there, and I think,</p>
<p>in my view, most decent men watching</p>
<p>a man walking into the ladies&rsquo; bathroom</p>
<p>might well challenge him too. That is now being eroded.</p>
<p>So, we have statistics on this.</p>
<p>The Sunday Times issued a freedom of</p>
<p>information request from the government.</p>
<p>88% of sexual assaults happen in unisex spaces.</p>
<p>The Sunday Times data Rowling is referencing</p>
<p>specifically addressed reported sexual assaults,</p>
<p>harassment, and voyeurism in changing rooms</p>
<p>at sports centers and swimming pools,</p>
<p>and compared the rates of incidents that occurred</p>
<p>in women&rsquo;s unisex changing rooms.</p>
<p>We have had multiple instances in this country</p>
<p>and in America, because I went and looked,</p>
<p>because I was thinking, well, does this happen?</p>
<p>And it happens. Voyeurism, sexual assault.</p>
<p>The men, particularly,</p>
<p>arguing that this isn&rsquo;t a risk,</p>
<p>alarm me, candidly. Are they naive?</p>
<p>Do they not know what their fellow men do?</p>
<p>There are a lot of critics who say you</p>
<p>and your comments are giving fuel to the right.</p>
<p>Well, my answer would be, I think you&rsquo;re giving</p>
<p>fuel to the right. This is why many</p>
<p>left-wing feminists in particular are sitting</p>
<p>with their head in their hands.</p>
<p>The right has wanted for years and years and years</p>
<p>to, not all of the right, but certainly</p>
<p>the further right and the religious right,</p>
<p>wanted to castigate the lesbian and gay</p>
<p>and bisexual movement as inherently degenerate</p>
<p>and part of the left&rsquo;s broader degeneracy.</p>
<p>When you defend the placing of</p>
<p>rapists in cells with women, you are</p>
<p>handing the right a perfect opportunity</p>
<p>to say, you see, we told you the moral</p>
<p>degeneracy that would result if you say homosexual</p>
<p>relationships are okay. And I think for many</p>
<p>feminists, we are despairing of the fact</p>
<p>that people are, in our view,</p>
<p>colluding with a deeply misogynist movement</p>
<p>which is benefiting, politically speaking,</p>
<p>the far right.</p>
<p>And I worry very deeply</p>
<p>that as the left becomes increasingly</p>
<p>puritanical and authoritarian and</p>
<p>judgmental, we are pushing swathes</p>
<p>of people towards not just the right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pushing them to the alt-right. That&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>scares me, that particularly young men,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re being told everything in the world is their fault</p>
<p>and they have no right to a voice and they are</p>
<p>everything that is wrong with society,</p>
<p>it is unfortunately a human reaction</p>
<p>to go to the place where you will be embraced.</p>
<p>If the only place where you can make a joke or</p>
<p>be accepted is a place that is full of</p>
<p>poisonous ideas, then you&rsquo;re likely to go there,</p>
<p>particularly when you&rsquo;re young. So I think</p>
<p>that the left is making a tremendous mistake</p>
<p>in espousing this kind of,</p>
<p>in my view, quasi-religious, incredibly</p>
<p>witch-hunting behaviour because there will be people</p>
<p>who will just feel, when they&rsquo;ve been shamed and abused</p>
<p>and feel it was unfair, where are they going to go?</p>
<p>That worries me very deeply. In my lifetime</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen such a shift on the left</p>
<p>and I still would define myself as of the left</p>
<p>but I was born in the 60s</p>
<p>when transgression really was the preserve of the left</p>
<p>when challenging authority and making the dark</p>
<p>joke and breaking societal norms was very much</p>
<p>the preserve of the left. I&rsquo;ve lived</p>
<p>to see the left become incredibly</p>
<p>puritanical and rigid and</p>
<p>watching the alt-right, and this is a new phenomenon,</p>
<p>the alt-right is not the conservative right, with whom</p>
<p>I disagree on many, many things, but I&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing the growth of something very much</p>
<p>facilitated by the internet that alarms</p>
<p>and disturbs me and it worries me that the left are</p>
<p>absolutely playing into that demographic&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>You wrote a book, many books, where</p>
<p>young children have a lot of autonomy and</p>
<p>make very adult decisions and</p>
<p>some of them come with really great risks and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like sneaking off into a dungeon or</p>
<p>running away to fight the most powerful wizard who has ever existed</p>
<p>and some of your critics wonder if there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>contradictory in saying that young people</p>
<p>are not old enough to know who they are</p>
<p>to make this decision about</p>
<p>whether to medically transition.</p>
<p>Those are fantasy books and the point of fantasy is</p>
<p>that we are allowed to explore in imagination</p>
<p>things that frighten us, challenge us,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re allowed to escape into a world that&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>but then we can come back, we can close the book, we can think about</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve read, we can think about what it means to make irreversible decisions.</p>
<p>By contrast, we are dealing</p>
<p>with the real world here. We&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with children, in my view,</p>
<p>being persuaded</p>
<p>that a solution for</p>
<p>all distress is lifelong medicalisation.</p>
<p>That is real world harm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no closing the book and walking away, there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>playing with this, experimenting with this</p>
<p>and not suffering harm,</p>
<p>in my view. Now, people will say</p>
<p>perhaps that you&rsquo;ve already said</p>
<p>that for some people this will be the answer and I will say</p>
<p>yes, for persistent gender dysphoria</p>
<p>I believe, I certainly hope</p>
<p>that for adults who have found no other way to resolve their gender dysphoria</p>
<p>transition may be the answer. I want to see those people protected,</p>
<p>I want their rights protected,</p>
<p>I wish them lives full of joy and fulfilment</p>
<p>but when we&rsquo;re talking about children, I think that is</p>
<p>a very different question.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;ve said that you&rsquo;ve been immersing yourself in a lot of reading,</p>
<p>memoirs and philosophy and academic literature</p>
<p>all around this subject and</p>
<p>I know that one thing that&rsquo;s made this conversation about</p>
<p>minors medically transitioning so</p>
<p>contentious is that because it&rsquo;s quite new</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t a lot of authoritative studies</p>
<p>and so with the studies that are out there, the assertion is that</p>
<p>people on all sides are cherry picking</p>
<p>to fit their arguments. What evidence are you seeing</p>
<p>that makes you think that you are right to be worried?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet found a study</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t found that the majority of young people,</p>
<p>children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria</p>
<p>will grow out of it.</p>
<p>Now, I haven&rsquo;t found a single study</p>
<p>that contradicts that and I have gone looking.</p>
<p>The majority of children will, if allowed to go through adolescence,</p>
<p>many of them will grow up to,</p>
<p>not all, but many will grow up to be gay and</p>
<p>their gender dysphoria will resolve.</p>
<p>Why then, if that&rsquo;s the evidence,</p>
<p>are we immediately putting</p>
<p>children onto an affirmative path?</p>
<p>Can we follow the science?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s activism and</p>
<p>all activism isn&rsquo;t equal.</p>
<p>I genuinely think that we are watching one of the worst</p>
<p>medical scandals in a century</p>
<p>and I believe that those who should have known better,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m talking here not, God knows, about</p>
<p>trans people, gender dysphoric people, distressed young people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not talking about them, I am talking about</p>
<p>medics and those who have cheered</p>
<p>this on unquestioningly, creating a climate in which</p>
<p>many people trying to raise red flags</p>
<p>have been intimidated and silenced.</p>
<p>And I would ask proponents of gender identity ideology</p>
<p>who are so militant, who are so determined</p>
<p>on no debate, I would ask them, what if you are wrong?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>honestly, hallelujah.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m wrong, great.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t being harmed.</p>
<p>But if you are wrong, you have cheered on,</p>
<p>you have created a climate, quite a threatening climate,</p>
<p>in which whistleblowers and</p>
<p>young people themselves are being intimidated</p>
<p>out of raising concerns.</p>
<p>I think it was in 2018, Professor Carl Hennigan,</p>
<p>who is of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine,</p>
<p>and he spoke up publicly and he said,</p>
<p>we are watching an unregulated live experiment</p>
<p>on children. He was instantly</p>
<p>condemned as a transphobe by, I think,</p>
<p>the Oxford University&rsquo;s LGBT society.</p>
<p>So when you say that people aren&rsquo;t being harmed</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re wrong, you mean physically?</p>
<p>Because your critics say that you are harming people</p>
<p>with your words and with the ideas that you are promoting.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I received an email</p>
<p>right after I spoke out in which</p>
<p>a left-wing man I know emailed me and he said</p>
<p>a trans man had been killed</p>
<p>in Germany. And he said</p>
<p>to me, your rhetoric</p>
<p>contributes to an environment in which police are less likely</p>
<p>to investigate that crime.</p>
<p>Now, join the dots for me.</p>
<p>What I had said at that point is,</p>
<p>there used to be a word for people who menstruate.</p>
<p>Is he genuinely arguing</p>
<p>that by saying women menstruate,</p>
<p>police investigating murder</p>
<p>will say, well, better wrap up the investigation.</p>
<p>These hyperbolic</p>
<p>accusations are thrown at anyone who</p>
<p>challenges this ideology. Your words</p>
<p>will cause people to kill themselves. Your words</p>
<p>will stop police investigation.</p>
<p>Your words will cause men to be violent</p>
<p>trans women. Blaming women</p>
<p>for the violence of men is a hallmark</p>
<p>of something that is not normally seen as progressive.</p>
<p>That is misogyny writ large.</p>
<p>To go back to your concern</p>
<p>about the left feeding a backlash that might</p>
<p>help the far right, there has been a real</p>
<p>and rapid loss of public trust in institutions</p>
<p>of all kinds over the past few years.</p>
<p>And it sounds like this experience you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>is causing you yourself to have doubts about</p>
<p>the trustworthiness of some of our institutions</p>
<p>in this moment. Completely. And I think that this is</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve seen this play out in the last decade, this</p>
<p>undermining of experts. You know, the experts</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be trusted. The media can&rsquo;t be trusted. Governments can&rsquo;t be trusted.</p>
<p>And I would be lying if I didn&rsquo;t say that I have</p>
<p>lost faith in certain institutions. I have</p>
<p>lost a degree of faith in what is</p>
<p>obviously the industry I know best, the publishing industry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been shocked by the positions that</p>
<p>publishing has taken. I am</p>
<p>pleased and proud to say that my publisher has</p>
<p>taken, my editor in fact,</p>
<p>has taken a robust position on freedom of speech.</p>
<p>And I was relieved that he took that position,</p>
<p>not for my sake, but it was a declaration on freedom of speech</p>
<p>that I think publishing, if publishers stand</p>
<p>for nothing else, they should stand for plurality of views.</p>
<p>And the other institutions that I have</p>
<p>definitely lost faith in are educational institutions</p>
<p>who I think have taken a very dogmatic</p>
<p>position on this and are shutting down debate,</p>
<p>freedom of thought and freedom of expression. And I,</p>
<p>if we cannot look to those institutions to protect those very</p>
<p>precious things, we are in trouble. And I am</p>
<p>afraid I think we are currently in trouble.</p>
<p>Well, one of the concerns you voiced is around</p>
<p>language and institutions using phrases</p>
<p>like birthing people or cervix havers</p>
<p>or people who menstruate. And</p>
<p>some of your critics just don&rsquo;t see a problem with this.</p>
<p>They see it as just making language more</p>
<p>inclusive. So for instance, in the world of journalism,</p>
<p>the Associated Press released a new style guide</p>
<p>explaining that when referring to transgender people,</p>
<p>phrases like is a woman are more</p>
<p>to the point than identifies as a woman.</p>
<p>Can you make the case to the skeptic,</p>
<p>why is this an issue for you?</p>
<p>That from the Associated Press is hugely</p>
<p>powerful. They&rsquo;ve edged from identifies</p>
<p>as a woman. So a man identifies as a woman, which I think</p>
<p>we all understand what that means, into is a woman.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely the creep that I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about. We are using language</p>
<p>to make accurate definition</p>
<p>of sex difference unspeakable.</p>
<p>When I read news stories,</p>
<p>woman convicted of exposing her penis</p>
<p>on the street. Now I&rsquo;m laughing, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not actually that funny. I hear myself saying the words and that</p>
<p>seems so absurd to me. But there is now a journalistic</p>
<p>convention that no matter the crime,</p>
<p>woman convicted of raping small boy. These are</p>
<p>real news stories. I see that</p>
<p>as political language.</p>
<p>I see that as an ideological.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it to be factual. There&rsquo;s a body</p>
<p>of feminists who would say these are not our crimes. These are</p>
<p>not women&rsquo;s crimes. And I would say something else.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe you can accurately analyze sexual violence</p>
<p>or violence when committed by males. And we know that</p>
<p>98 to 99% of sexual violence is committed</p>
<p>by men. Women are</p>
<p>form 88% of victims of sexual violence.</p>
<p>How can we record accurate data?</p>
<p>How can we analyze this phenomenon without being</p>
<p>able to accurately talk about</p>
<p>who is the perpetrator and who is the victim?</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is that by changing the language there</p>
<p>to focus, especially around sex crimes,</p>
<p>to focus on gender rather than sex,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re obscuring an important fact, which is that</p>
<p>biology actually is implicated there.</p>
<p>Exactly that.</p>
<p>One of the things that your critics say often is some version of</p>
<p>I wish she would listen. Why isn&rsquo;t she listening to us?</p>
<p>They think that nobody</p>
<p>could possibly disagree with them if they heard</p>
<p>what they were saying. And I truly</p>
<p>believe that the notion that I have listened and I have read</p>
<p>and I have learned and I&rsquo;ve looked at the theory and I&rsquo;ve looked</p>
<p>at personal accounts and still disagree is</p>
<p>simply anathema. So what you&rsquo;re saying is they think</p>
<p>they want you to listen when really they want you to agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that is exactly what I think.</p>
<p>And then the other extremely common question that comes up</p>
<p>and it comes off almost like a plea</p>
<p>is just why? Why are you doing this?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you just let people be who they are</p>
<p>and support them the way that you do for these outsider characters in your book?</p>
<p>If one of those people is listening right now,</p>
<p>how would you talk to them? What would you say to them?</p>
<p>Can you speak to them?</p>
<p>I would say to them, you as a human being,</p>
<p>the self that you are, I have the utmost</p>
<p>respect for you. I want you protected. I want you safe.</p>
<p>I would treat you with respect, always.</p>
<p>And I would say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried that you</p>
<p>yourself may have got caught up</p>
<p>in something that may ultimately harm you.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m asking some questions because I think</p>
<p>some vulnerable groups are being harmed</p>
<p>and that includes the gay community,</p>
<p>that includes vulnerable women</p>
<p>and it includes vulnerable youth.</p>
<p>Now, if you identify as trans,</p>
<p>if that is an answer for you,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m with you 100%.</p>
<p>But we are seeing mounting evidence that this is not</p>
<p>the answer for everyone and that we may be living</p>
<p>through a cultural moment that we will look back on,</p>
<p>not with pride, but with puzzlement</p>
<p>that we let it happen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>

<p>I am a person who can be pretty obsessive</p>
<p>about my health.</p>
<p>My routine typically includes things like</p>
<p>10,000 steps a day and smoothies and strength workouts</p>
<p>and, yes, I am even one of those people</p>
<p>who forces myself to take cold showers</p>
<p>even when I&rsquo;m not feeling well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a person who is obsessed with my health</p>
<p>and I am one of those people who forces myself</p>
<p>to take cold showers even in the winter.</p>
<p>But a lot of that flew out the window</p>
<p>when I had a baby six months ago</p>
<p>and I especially struggled to make sure</p>
<p>that I was getting good nutrition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was so excited to add AG1</p>
<p>from Athletic Greens to my routine.</p>

<p>and it&rsquo;s so much easier than swallowing a bunch of pills</p>
<p>which is what I did for years and came to completely dread.</p>
<p>AG1 is different and it makes me feel grateful</p>
<p>that even during the most chaotic times in my life</p>
<p>I can do this small, powerful thing</p>
<p>to help me cover my nutritional bases every day.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really interested in the question of discernment.</p>
<p>I think of this scene from one of your books,</p>
<p>it was Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,</p>
<p>and Hermione, the hero, and Professor Umbridge,</p>
<p>who is clearly in the wrong, have this showdown in class.</p>
<p>Hermione says in a moment of defiance</p>
<p>that she disagrees with something in her textbook,</p>
<p>and Umbridge berates her, like,</p>
<p>who are you to disagree with this expert</p>
<p>who wrote this textbook, and punishes her?</p>
<p>Now to anyone reading this, it is so frustrating and unjust,</p>
<p>but I venture to say that no one thinks they are the Umbridge.</p>
<p>No one ever thinks that. No one ever thinks they&rsquo;re Umbridge.</p>
<p>And some people see you as the Umbridge.</p>
<p>You have these younger critics online,</p>
<p>and they see Hermione as standing up to an older person</p>
<p>with power, and they see themselves</p>
<p>as standing up to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I understand because they&rsquo;ve told me</p>
<p>very explicitly why they have that interpretation.</p>
<p>How do you know if you are a Hermione or an Umbridge?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re having a lot of fun doing it,</p>
<p>and getting a huge sense of self-satisfaction out of it,</p>
<p>then I do believe you maybe want to stop and think,</p>
<p>am I getting a huge ego rush out of this?</p>
<p>That would be a good question to ask yourself.</p>
<p>You know, is this giving me pleasure?</p>
<p>Because I can say from my heart,</p>
<p>none of this has given me pleasure.</p>
<p>It has given me anxiety.</p>
<p>It has made me at times feel vulnerable.</p>
<p>So although I don&rsquo;t regret anything,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had concerns for my family&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>Some of the threats have not been too amusing to me.</p>
<p>There has been fallout in my life inevitably.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t regret standing up,</p>
<p>but it certainly hasn&rsquo;t given me pleasure on any level.</p>
<p>You know, one of the key moments for me,</p>
<p>so you say, you talk about righteousness.</p>
<p>There was an incident in 2019, I believe, in which&hellip;</p>
<p>Here, Rowling mentioned the incident</p>
<p>that we spoke about in Chapter 4,</p>
<p>where in a nearby Scottish town,</p>
<p>a 10-year-old girl was sexually assaulted</p>
<p>by an 18-year-old trans woman in a public bathroom.</p>
<p>Some of the discourse I saw after that incident</p>
<p>really took me aback,</p>
<p>because one of the first things I saw was,</p>
<p>the TERFs love it when something like this happens.</p>
<p>Now, what thought process has led you to believe</p>
<p>that the TERFs, this demonised, evil group&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, they just hate trans people.</p>
<p>They want them all dead. We all know this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who they are.</p>
<p>What leads you to believe</p>
<p>that we want 10-year-old children escape rape</p>
<p>by a hair&rsquo;s whisker?</p>
<p>How has your black-and-white thinking evolved</p>
<p>to the point where you think that feminists like me</p>
<p>actively are gleeful when women are raped or attacked?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great. We can use this to bash trans women with.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen that discourse,</p>
<p>and I think if you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not just irrational.</p>
<p>That is such a bad faith position.</p>
<p>At no point do you stop and say to yourself,</p>
<p>there may be some nuance here.</p>
<p>Is this all moving pieces on a chessboard for you?</p>
<p>Is it all a game?</p>
<p>Does real-world hurt and harm not count at all?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one other question that I had about discernment.</p>
<p>So how do you know if you&rsquo;re fighting for something</p>
<p>that is truly righteous</p>
<p>or just something that appears to be righteous?</p>
<p>How do you know that the courage to call out an injustice</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t actually just a call to join an unjust mob?</p>
<p>So coming from Westboro,</p>
<p>where I believed so strongly that I was doing the right thing,</p>
<p>and then to leave and come to believe</p>
<p>that it was so destructive and harmful,</p>
<p>I had this moment in time,</p>
<p>and it lasted for many months,</p>
<p>where I was like, how can I ever trust my own mind again?</p>
<p>Because I was so certain.</p>
<p>And so I was looking for some kind of solid footing.</p>
<p>What leg do I have to stand on?</p>
<p>How can I trust my mind?</p>
<p>How do I not make the same mistake again and again going forward?</p>
<p>And so I basically came up with this list of questions</p>
<p>that kind of grew over time,</p>
<p>and a few of them you&rsquo;ve alluded to already.</p>
<p>So these are the questions that I asked myself to see.</p>
<p>Am I starting to go down a bad path?</p>
<p>So the first question is,</p>
<p>are you capable of entertaining real doubt about your beliefs,</p>
<p>or are you operating from a position of certainty?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that that&rsquo;s key.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s when we are most certain,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re getting that rush of adrenaline that says,</p>
<p>God, I&rsquo;m a good person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when we should most question ourselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you need to stop and ask yourself a question.</p>
<p>And the second point is, can you articulate the evidence</p>
<p>that you would need to see in order to change your position,</p>
<p>or is your perspective unfalsifiable?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve discussed this already,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s such a good question</p>
<p>because I asked myself that question on this issue.</p>
<p>What would I need to see?</p>
<p>And I could articulate what I would need to see</p>
<p>to move me from my position, my thought-out position.</p>
<p>Can you articulate your opponent&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>in a way that they recognize, or are you strawmanning?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s excellent,</p>
<p>and I genuinely believe I could articulate my opponent&rsquo;s position</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve read their books,</p>
<p>and I think people need to read these things.</p>
<p>They need to understand what is being argued.</p>
<p>The fourth one was, are you attacking ideas</p>
<p>or attacking the people who hold them?</p>
<p>Always the ideas.</p>
<p>Are you willing to cut off close relationships</p>
<p>with people who disagree with you,</p>
<p>particularly over relatively small points of contention?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>A difference of belief is nothing to me,</p>
<p>but I can imagine myself no longer wishing to have a relationship</p>
<p>with a person who behaved in certain ways towards me or towards others</p>
<p>because I do strongly believe it&rsquo;s watch what people are doing,</p>
<p>not what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>So certain behaviors would probably be a deal-breaker for me,</p>
<p>and that would include demonizing others for small transgressions.</p>
<p>That would be a revelation to me</p>
<p>that that person wasn&rsquo;t who I thought they were probably.</p>
<p>And then the last one was,</p>
<p>are you willing to use extraordinary means</p>
<p>against people who disagree with you?</p>
<p>And by that I mean things like forcing people out of their jobs or homes,</p>
<p>violence or threats of violence,</p>
<p>or things like what my family and I did celebrating misfortune and tragedy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but that question has actually made me quite emotional</p>
<p>that you say that to me because I sit opposite you and I like you so much</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re such a humane and reasonable person,</p>
<p>and to hear you describing those behaviors is&hellip;</p>
<p>I can really understand why you had your long dark night of the soul.</p>
<p>One thing that you said to me earlier in our discussion really stuck with me.</p>
<p>You said to me that not long before you left,</p>
<p>you said to someone, an interviewer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all in, and you told me,</p>
<p>I believed that I had questioned myself and I was fine with everything,</p>
<p>but you said you hadn&rsquo;t gone deep enough.</p>
<p>Trust and obey, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d never actually taken apart</p>
<p>the most fundamental three words of your belief system.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d never challenged those.</p>
<p>Can you talk about that? Because that really interests me.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I grew up in a family of lawyers, right?</p>
<p>So my mom is one of 13, and I think 11 of the 13 went to law school.</p>
<p>They were very, very smart, very analytical, very logical people,</p>
<p>which I think surprised a lot of people to learn</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easy to assume that these are just kind of rednecks</p>
<p>with backwards beliefs or something,</p>
<p>and specifically with unexamined beliefs.</p>
<p>These are just their personal prejudices,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re living them out in the world,</p>
<p>when in fact my grandfather was a well-known,</p>
<p>award-winning civil rights attorney.</p>
<p>He was somebody who had reason to believe</p>
<p>that he was on the right side of things on a lot of things,</p>
<p>and we were constantly looking around at what other people believed</p>
<p>and other understandings of the Bible</p>
<p>and then going back to the Word, right?</p>
<p>Going back to the King James Version of the Bible</p>
<p>and trying to show and memorizing chapter and verse</p>
<p>why everybody else was wrong, all the evidence.</p>
<p>So it was a constant process of examination, asking these questions.</p>
<p>But I realized before I left</p>
<p>that there were two fundamental premises of our ideology</p>
<p>that I never questioned.</p>
<p>I never truly questioned the idea that the Bible</p>
<p>was the literal, infallible Word of God</p>
<p>and that Westboro&rsquo;s understanding of it was the right one</p>
<p>because, again, it was all laid out there for me.</p>
<p>And as many questions as I asked, from those two premises,</p>
<p>essentially everything else basically fell into place.</p>
<p>There were a few small contradictions</p>
<p>that outsiders were able to find on Twitter,</p>
<p>and I do wonder if not for some internal contradiction,</p>
<p>relatively small points,</p>
<p>if that had never revealed themselves to me,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;d never revealed themselves to me,</p>
<p>then I would have just accepted.</p>
<p>I would never have thought to question those two basic premises.</p>
<p>That actually is one of the reasons that I came up with this list</p>
<p>because if I asked myself all these hard questions,</p>
<p>what I imagined, I really thought I was digging in deep.</p>
<p>It was really terrifying to realize</p>
<p>even when you&rsquo;re really trying,</p>
<p>even when it&rsquo;s an earnest attempt,</p>
<p>and all of your intellect,</p>
<p>and, again, I&rsquo;m surrounded by people</p>
<p>who are all incredibly intelligent and well-intentioned.</p>
<p>I know those people.</p>
<p>We would do anything for each other.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just the idea that such people</p>
<p>could still get to a place that was so wrong</p>
<p>and so harmful and so destructive,</p>
<p>it helps me, I guess, now</p>
<p>feel a lot of understanding and grace for people</p>
<p>even when they&rsquo;re doing harmful things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that question about,</p>
<p>are you talking ideas or the people who hold them?</p>
<p>That is very, it&rsquo;s huge to me</p>
<p>because of the way that people were able to understand</p>
<p>that even though I was doing horrible things,</p>
<p>I was trying to do the right thing,</p>
<p>and that was something that they could tap into.</p>
<p>And so this is, for me,</p>
<p>even though it can be kind of scary</p>
<p>to see what people are capable of</p>
<p>even when they&rsquo;re trying to do the right thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a hopeful thing because that desire to do good</p>
<p>is something that you can tap into,</p>
<p>which is why the desire to shut down debate and conversation</p>
<p>is so alarming to me</p>
<p>because that is the only thing</p>
<p>that can ultimately change hearts and minds.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I think, the only real tool we have</p>
<p>outside of actual force and violence to make change.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Every crowd, every mob is made up of individuals,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s reaching the individuals</p>
<p>and not allowing this to become mob on mob</p>
<p>that will change things for the best.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re to have any hope,</p>
<p>and your story obviously is one of redemption,</p>
<p>and I love everything that you say</p>
<p>about the good in your family.</p>
<p>I truly do.</p>
<p>Okay, very last question.</p>
<p>Why have you been willing to talk to me?</p>
<p>What do you hope this does?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been willing to talk to you specifically</p>
<p>because you wrote me that incredible letter</p>
<p>and because I think I&rsquo;ve had a hundred people at least say,</p>
<p>explain yourself, explain yourself,</p>
<p>but I felt that you and I could have a conversation</p>
<p>that interested me.</p>
<p>And in terms of what I hope this does,</p>
<p>I suppose I hope people enjoy the podcast, honestly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean this in any arrogant way,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean this in any self-pitying way,</p>
<p>but I feel that I&rsquo;ve said what I&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>and maybe when the mist clears,</p>
<p>some people will understand better.</p>
<p>Some will always hate me for what I&rsquo;ve said.</p>
<p>I accept that.</p>
<p>I know I won&rsquo;t ever regret having stood up on this issue, ever.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the price you pay.</p>
<p>If you want to be universally and eternally beloved,</p>
<p>then you must curate your image</p>
<p>in a way that I&rsquo;m simply not prepared to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in the business of doing that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not taking a long bet here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking, oh, I think this cultural moment will pass</p>
<p>and therefore I will be vindicated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the future holds.</p>
<p>I only know that I would have betrayed myself,</p>
<p>and I passionately believe I would have betrayed</p>
<p>a lot of women and girls if I had not stood up on this issue.</p>
<p>There are more important things in this world than being popular,</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s more important to me to be right.</p>
<p>It means it&rsquo;s more important to me to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Jo Rowling, thank you so much for speaking with me.</p>
