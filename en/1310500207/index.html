    <p>The following is a conversation with Anya Fernald,</p>
<p>cofounder of Belcampo Farms,</p>
<p>that was founded with the purpose to create meat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good for people, the planet, and the animals,</p>
<p>specifically treating their animals as ethically as possible.</p>
<p>In this, she sought to revolutionize the meat industry</p>
<p>from the inside out.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also a scholar and practitioner</p>
<p>of regenerative agriculture,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s a chef who has appeared many times</p>
<p>as a judge on Iron Chef.</p>
<p>Plus, she has one of my favorite food related Instagrams.</p>
<p>On top of that, she&rsquo;s also a longtime friend</p>
<p>of Andrew Huberman, which is how we first got connected.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Gala Games, Athletic Greens, Four Sigmatic,</p>
<p>and Fundrise.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I got the chance to visit</p>
<p>and spend a few days with Anya</p>
<p>at Belcampo Farms in Northern California.</p>
<p>I met many animals there, from cows to pigs,</p>
<p>and saw the amazing land on which they grazed.</p>
<p>I butchered meat, I watched Anya cook many amazing meals,</p>
<p>I ate raw meat and cooked meat,</p>
<p>and spent long hours at the bonfire talking with friends</p>
<p>and listening to the sounds of nature.</p>
<p>I hiked, swam in a cold mountain lake,</p>
<p>and slept in a tent underneath the stars.</p>
<p>It was an amazing eye opening experience,</p>
<p>especially in my first ever visit to a slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>The term slaughterhouse is haunting in itself.</p>
<p>The animals I met lived a great life,</p>
<p>but in the end, they were slaughtered,</p>
<p>in the most ethical way possible,</p>
<p>but slaughtered nevertheless.</p>
<p>Seeing animals with whom just the day before</p>
<p>I made a connection be converted to meat</p>
<p>that I then consumed was deeply honest to me.</p>
<p>This ethical farm, Belcampo,</p>
<p>represents less than 1% of animals raised</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>The rest is factory farmed.</p>
<p>I could not escape the thought</p>
<p>of the 40 to 50 billion animals worldwide</p>
<p>raised in terrible conditions on these factory farms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life thinking about</p>
<p>and being in contact with human suffering,</p>
<p>but the landscape of suffering</p>
<p>in the minds of conscious beings</p>
<p>is much larger than humans.</p>
<p>I must admit that I still am haunted</p>
<p>by human suffering more than animal suffering.</p>
<p>Perhaps I will one day see the wrong</p>
<p>in me drawing such a line.</p>
<p>Either way, the visit to Belcampo Farms</p>
<p>made me realize that I have not thought deeply enough</p>
<p>about the ethics of my choices</p>
<p>and the choices of human civilization</p>
<p>with respect to animals.</p>
<p>And more importantly, I have not thought</p>
<p>or learned enough about large scale solutions</p>
<p>to alleviate animal suffering.</p>
<p>Belcampo is paving the way on this</p>
<p>and is the reason I wanted to show my support</p>
<p>for their and Anya&rsquo;s efforts in regenerative farming</p>
<p>and ethical treatment of animals.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Anya Fernald.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re watching the video version of this</p>
<p>and are asking yourself why we&rsquo;re in nature right now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually a beautiful mountain in the background.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an incredible vast landscape.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a farm.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sitting behind a table and nevertheless,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wearing a suit and tie amidst nature.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at the beautiful Belcampo Farms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about that,</p>
<p>this incredible place you have here,</p>
<p>but you cooked some meat yesterday.</p>
<p>It tasted delicious.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love to talk about just the science</p>
<p>and art of cooking first.</p>
<p>You as a chef, when you think of cooking,</p>
<p>is it a science or is it an art?</p>
<p>Art and service together, probably.</p>
<p>Art to me because it&rsquo;s about creating something of beauty</p>
<p>and being responsive and creating something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s expression of creativity and love.</p>
<p>Cooking also has a very strong element of service</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t mean necessarily service to another person,</p>
<p>but like service to health, wellness, environment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an element of supporting through food</p>
<p>in how I approach cooking.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s bigger than just like how the ingredients</p>
<p>come together to form a taste.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the whole pipeline.</p>
<p>Like the fact that there&rsquo;s a lot of work</p>
<p>that went into bringing the ingredients together</p>
<p>and then giving you the ability to make the meal</p>
<p>and then who gets to consume the meal and the whole thing.</p>
<p>And you see that as service as opposed to just the taste.</p>
<p>Yeah, I also think of food as one of the key ways</p>
<p>that we interact with our environment, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the part of our environment</p>
<p>that goes inside us most visibly, right?</p>
<p>Of course, we interact with our environment.</p>
<p>We could have skin creams that have certain things in them</p>
<p>or our clothes can then be absorbed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things in the air.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s our water and there&rsquo;s food, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how we&rsquo;re engaging in the world.</p>
<p>Physiologically, it&rsquo;s the most significant way</p>
<p>we engage in our environment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re extracting resources, calories, energy</p>
<p>from the environment in various ways</p>
<p>in order to preserve our bodies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also so many feedback loops</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think we know the beginning of</p>
<p>that our bodies are picking up on around nutrients,</p>
<p>available nutrients, immune response.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s deep levels of sensory evaluation</p>
<p>that lead to health and alertness and wellness.</p>
<p>You hear about this a lot with babies that, you know,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a risk of an infection</p>
<p>that a mom&rsquo;s breast milk will help the baby</p>
<p>develop a resistance, like there&rsquo;s this way</p>
<p>that our bodies can tune into health</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t extrapolate from that in any specific way,</p>
<p>but think about that as an example of the many ways</p>
<p>in which our bodies are reading available nutrients and food</p>
<p>to signal other aspects of wellness and health.</p>
<p>That said, the final product of cooking is,</p>
<p>when done well, is really delicious.</p>
<p>And what we ate yesterday was really delicious.</p>
<p>So that aspect of it, bringing the ingredients together</p>
<p>in a way that tastes delicious,</p>
<p>do you see that as a science or art?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the art of it.</p>
<p>I mean, the art is like creating temptation</p>
<p>and indulgence and giving people pause,</p>
<p>you know, like creating experience that&rsquo;s like so sensual.</p>
<p>And like, I love that about when I make something</p>
<p>really simple and beautiful and delicious</p>
<p>the way that, like there&rsquo;s that moment of silence</p>
<p>at the table.</p>
<p>And that to me is the moment of art, like appreciation.</p>
<p>What about the buildup?</p>
<p>I mean, we got to watch you make the stuff over a fire.</p>
<p>So the calmness of the air, I mean, that&rsquo;s an experience.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t often get to see that experience of the preparation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the anticipation, like you said.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the most delicious part of a meal</p>
<p>is the anticipation of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m glad you bring up</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an element that with eating so many</p>
<p>of our meals, like out of a bag and you know,</p>
<p>the instance where you start to eat the meals</p>
<p>when the delivery shows up and you might smell something</p>
<p>when you open the bag, right?</p>
<p>And no judgment on that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I do too, right?</p>
<p>But that does take away a whole element</p>
<p>of surprise and delight.</p>
<p>And also I think of your body&rsquo;s ability to prepare for it.</p>
<p>You know, you think about our most common memories</p>
<p>of childhood for those of us who grew up in homes</p>
<p>with parents who cooked is smell of things cooking.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the eating of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the smell of things cooking.</p>
<p>So why is that so memorable?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an anticipatory piece of food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you remember about your experiences of food</p>
<p>is the moment of like sweet anticipation</p>
<p>of this great sensual experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be really gratifying on these emotional</p>
<p>and physical levels.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re also resonating on those memories</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s an experience of food</p>
<p>where the sensuality of it is kind of extended.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a long kind of arc of buildup</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re eating it and it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re enjoying it and your body feels good.</p>
<p>So all those pieces together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a much more memorable experience</p>
<p>than just grabbing the cookie out of a bag, right?</p>
<p>So look at our own and just revisit in your mind</p>
<p>like the memories of food, the most compelling ones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the smell and then the experience</p>
<p>and then sometimes how one felt, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the people involved with the smell.</p>
<p>So like somehow it&rsquo;s all tied in together</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s family or people close to you</p>
<p>or even if it&rsquo;s just chefs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the personality of the human</p>
<p>involved in making the food</p>
<p>that kind of sticks with you in the memory.</p>
<p>And for me, I recently did a 72 hour fast</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a kind of sadness after you eat</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>I think the most delicious part was the,</p>
<p>I went to the grocery store and just actually walking around</p>
<p>and looking at food with like everything looked delicious.</p>
<p>Even like the crappiest stuff looked delicious</p>
<p>and I missed that.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed that anticipation</p>
<p>and then I picked out the meal.</p>
<p>I went home and I cooked it</p>
<p>and the whole thing took, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe two, three hours, like the whole process.</p>
<p>And that was the most delicious part</p>
<p>and the first taste of course.</p>
<p>And then after it was over, there&rsquo;s a bit of a sadness</p>
<p>because the part I remember is the buildup, the anticipation</p>
<p>and then once you eat, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>We kind of focus on the destination</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the whole journey.</p>
<p>The whole like, even if you go to a restaurant,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the conversations leading up to the meal</p>
<p>and the first taste of the meal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the joy is.</p>
<p>And if you get to watch the making of that meal,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the smell, the visual,</p>
<p>how the ingredients come together</p>
<p>and especially as we were looking over the fire,</p>
<p>like watching it, the fire play with the raw meat</p>
<p>and over time bring out the colors, bring out the,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like you can visually associate the flavor,</p>
<p>you know, how it becomes a little bit burnt on the outside,</p>
<p>you know, it has a crispiness to it,</p>
<p>it starts to gain that crispiness</p>
<p>and immediately your past memories</p>
<p>of the delicious crispiness of various foods you&rsquo;ve eaten</p>
<p>are somehow mapped into your,</p>
<p>immediately you start to taste it visually.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, yeah, that experience is magical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, and of course, maybe it&rsquo;s the Russian thing</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m almost like saddened when it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>I think fasting is gaining in popularity</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re having to relearn the importance</p>
<p>of being hungry in anticipation and delight.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We have such a fear of hunger</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really functional in evolution, right?</p>
<p>But we have this deep fear of hunger</p>
<p>and part of the great American experience has been</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have to be afraid of hunger at all</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s food everywhere and it&rsquo;s really cheap.</p>
<p>In all that abundance, we&rsquo;ve lost this edge of hunger</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t let ourselves get hungry.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one thing that I learned</p>
<p>in part of my journey as a cook and chef has been,</p>
<p>you know, moving abroad was the first time</p>
<p>when I lived out of the US,</p>
<p>was the first time that I regularly experienced hunger</p>
<p>because the time between meals was really long</p>
<p>and that was just what everybody did.</p>
<p>And so I was hungry for two hours before lunch.</p>
<p>And that was the first time in my life</p>
<p>that there hadn&rsquo;t just been readily available snacks.</p>
<p>So I wonder if the intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and part of the popularity around it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s all these amazing metabolic things</p>
<p>that are happening, but also people might also feel better</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re really anticipating and enjoying food.</p>
<p>And then if you look at the feelings of fullness,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really interesting thing that happens</p>
<p>when you cook and your sense of fullness,</p>
<p>which is if you cook and you&rsquo;re hungry,</p>
<p>the experience of being around the food,</p>
<p>smelling it, touching it, sampling it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll take your hunger down by 40%.</p>
<p>And this is my own observation.</p>
<p>But as, I mean, we&rsquo;ve all had the experience</p>
<p>of cooking Thanksgiving and the cook</p>
<p>never kind of wants to eat that much Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an extreme experience.</p>
<p>But when you really dive in and you&rsquo;re cooking</p>
<p>for a few hours and you&rsquo;re smelling</p>
<p>and smelling and smelling,</p>
<p>it totally changes your threshold of satiety and fullness</p>
<p>because of other sensory things that are happening.</p>
<p>And for those of us looking to maintain weight</p>
<p>and something to consider in this is that cooking</p>
<p>is also part of what your appetite,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re hungry, what are you hungry for, right?</p>
<p>So we tend to think about calories, but when you&rsquo;re hungry,</p>
<p>you might also be hungrier for a wider range of things.</p>
<p>And it might be smells, it might be stopping.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other elements and that&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>I think as a cook, that it&rsquo;s powerful to explore</p>
<p>and be with and observe how your hunger changes</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re cooking.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask the romantic question.</p>
<p>When did you first fall in love with cooking?</p>
<p>Me falling in love with cooking</p>
<p>was about solving a problem in my family.</p>
<p>And it had to do with my mom feeling very anxious</p>
<p>about cooking and overwhelmed frequently</p>
<p>when it came to meals.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m naturally very good at juggling a lot of things.</p>
<p>And it was just something I could dive in and help</p>
<p>and help my dad, who I&rsquo;m very, very close to.</p>
<p>So it was a very functional role where I would see</p>
<p>this kind of crescendo of anxiety around meal times</p>
<p>as a kid and would be able to dive in and solve things.</p>
<p>And I also loved women who cooked.</p>
<p>Like my father&rsquo;s mother was a great cook.</p>
<p>She was, I remember her telling me as a kid,</p>
<p>I was asking her about church and why she went to church.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, I mostly go to church</p>
<p>because I get to cook for the potlucks.</p>
<p>And so there was an openness around that,</p>
<p>but she just loved to cook for people</p>
<p>and there was this real tenderness</p>
<p>and expression of that love.</p>
<p>So seeing women in my life who had this real tenderness</p>
<p>and love that they shared through food</p>
<p>and then also being able in my own home</p>
<p>to kind of pitch in and add value</p>
<p>and help my mom and dad was really powerful for me.</p>
<p>Cause I felt like I had a superpower.</p>
<p>I felt like, oh man, I just made this stressful thing</p>
<p>go away.</p>
<p>That was huge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment on,</p>
<p>especially for me growing up in Russia,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably true in a lot of cultures,</p>
<p>maybe every culture.</p>
<p>That food, and especially like in a family,</p>
<p>the mother that cooks is the source of love</p>
<p>and like ties the family together.</p>
<p>It creates events where everyone comes together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the only chances of togetherness.</p>
<p>The thing that bonds a family is like dinner</p>
<p>or food, eating together.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that.</p>
<p>It ties up with like dieting and so on.</p>
<p>When I was on stricter diets,</p>
<p>especially competing and cutting weight and stuff,</p>
<p>it felt like I was almost like losing opportunity</p>
<p>to connect with friends and family.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like cultures,</p>
<p>we cannot fully experience love and family without eating.</p>
<p>And on the flip side of that,</p>
<p>eating enables us to experience love and family.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough one.</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s lots of layers around kind of gender roles</p>
<p>and families changing and things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say I agree around the alienation</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done carnivore diet</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve tried some of these extreme protocols.</p>
<p>And I too, I suffered from loneliness.</p>
<p>It was like doing carnivore</p>
<p>and not being able to eat what my kids ate</p>
<p>and talk about it at the same time.</p>
<p>Those pieces are real.</p>
<p>And I wonder with all of these diets,</p>
<p>if that structure is actually helping</p>
<p>or just taking away from people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of sensual understanding.</p>
<p>But I think that there&rsquo;s some rigor</p>
<p>around that that helps people discover</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good for them by eliminating</p>
<p>and then growing towards more intuitive food</p>
<p>is a good evolution from that base.</p>
<p>I love to cook for people.</p>
<p>I love to pay attention to their way of being</p>
<p>and read what they&rsquo;d like to eat.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s my purest way of love.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s for everybody in my life.</p>
<p>I actually love to cook for people I love.</p>
<p>I would struggle to be putting out food all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like something for me, it&rsquo;s a real act of caretaking.</p>
<p>So I definitely have that in my makeup.</p>
<p>And I definitely notice in times of real stress,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the piece that drops off.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, if I&rsquo;m unable to care for myself,</p>
<p>I have a hard time cooking.</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s very emotional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very connected to love.</p>
<p>And individualistic.</p>
<p>So like focused on the particular individual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a journey of understanding</p>
<p>what that person is excited about</p>
<p>in the landscape of flavors.</p>
<p>Like figuring that person out, what they like,</p>
<p>what they love to eat.</p>
<p>Yeah, I see cooking from, I mostly cook for myself.</p>
<p>So I see that as almost, this is gonna be like</p>
<p>the worst term, but like an act of self love.</p>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<p>This is gonna be clipped out.</p>
<p>But that like, it&rsquo;s almost an exploration</p>
<p>of like what brings me joy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s surprising, because I usually don&rsquo;t share,</p>
<p>because the things that bring me joy</p>
<p>are the simplest ingredients.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m one of those people,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can psychoanalyze me,</p>
<p>because you also like basic ingredients.</p>
<p>I like a single ingredient to ingredients,</p>
<p>because I feel like I can deeply appreciate</p>
<p>the particular ingredient then.</p>
<p>I get easily distracted.</p>
<p>You know, people who are really good listening to music,</p>
<p>they can hear a piece of music,</p>
<p>and in their mind, extract the different layers,</p>
<p>and enjoy different layers at a time.</p>
<p>Like the bass, the drums, the different layering</p>
<p>of the piano, the beats, and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it means to truly enjoy music,</p>
<p>to listen to a piece over and over.</p>
<p>Like almost like as a scholar.</p>
<p>In that same way for food, I just can&rsquo;t do more</p>
<p>than like three, because then it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>I have to give in to the chaos of it, I guess.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s just a basic ingredient,</p>
<p>like just meat, or just a vegetable, like basic grilled</p>
<p>without sauces, without any of that,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve discovered is what brings me a lot of joy.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s boring to a lot of people.</p>
<p>So I usually have to be kind of private about that joy.</p>
<p>So, but that&rsquo;s mine, so yeah, I figured that out.</p>
<p>I guess as a chef, you have to figure that out</p>
<p>about everybody that you care for.</p>
<p>Well, also for you, you&rsquo;re very interested in things,</p>
<p>and interested in things being done well</p>
<p>and appreciating them.</p>
<p>So the single ingredient also allows you to control</p>
<p>for perfection in cooking that,</p>
<p>which is probably really appealing to you.</p>
<p>And I think sometimes I see people also in the beginning</p>
<p>of their journey of culinary trying to do too many things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s another piece too, that you&rsquo;ll notice,</p>
<p>if you recall last night, I grilled us a salad,</p>
<p>and then I did all those pieces separately.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something in general to be really attentive of</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re building flavor,</p>
<p>to make sure you pay attention to every piece separately.</p>
<p>The idea that you can, okay,</p>
<p>with a soup or something or a stew, there&rsquo;s workarounds,</p>
<p>but like to make a great dish</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got four or five vegetables in it,</p>
<p>cook them all separately to their optimal deliciousness</p>
<p>and then combine them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another way to approach that,</p>
<p>is that you may also be able to look</p>
<p>at the different ingredients separately</p>
<p>and still have that sense of understanding of it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s too often that we&rsquo;re layering together</p>
<p>like four or five things and then cooking them all at once</p>
<p>and then surprise that it&rsquo;s not delicious.</p>
<p>Cause you can&rsquo;t really optimize on multiple variables</p>
<p>at the same time for peak awesomeness.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually, the number one way you see this</p>
<p>is roasting a whole chicken, which is a really difficult,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the simplest dish, but it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>because you have the breast meat, which is bigger chunks.</p>
<p>They cook faster.</p>
<p>You have the thighs and drums,</p>
<p>which are smaller and they cook slower.</p>
<p>To optimize that and pay attention to it</p>
<p>and do it all right,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually solving for different outcomes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one example, but oftentimes food</p>
<p>is less delicious with multiple ingredients at the start</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not able to pay attention</p>
<p>to how each one needs to end up.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a way to parse that apart</p>
<p>and achieve a better outcome.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a documentary about, yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an obsession that that particular,</p>
<p>first of all, set of humans,</p>
<p>but also the particular cuisine</p>
<p>that focused on the basics of the ingredients.</p>
<p>What do you think of that kind of trying to achieve mastery</p>
<p>through repeating the making of the same meal</p>
<p>over and over and over for like decades?</p>
<p>Like, do you find beauty in that journey towards mastery</p>
<p>or do you think it should be always an exploration</p>
<p>to where you&rsquo;re always trying things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always kind of injecting new flavors,</p>
<p>new experiences, all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>I think you have to decide on a palette.</p>
<p>You know, if we&rsquo;re talking about an art,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s equivalent to saying, am I a sculptor or a painter?</p>
<p>That, the sushi lexicon thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very, very narrow, small canvas</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re painting on.</p>
<p>And that is a beautiful road, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beauty and a perfection to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I mean, there&rsquo;s many things culturally</p>
<p>around that that you could extrapolate</p>
<p>for specifically for Japan.</p>
<p>But I encourage people on the journey in food</p>
<p>to choose like kind of a language</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re working within.</p>
<p>And if you wanna step out of that occasionally</p>
<p>and have one or two dishes,</p>
<p>but if you wanna get mastery with food,</p>
<p>you probably aren&rsquo;t gonna be able to get more than say,</p>
<p>20 ingredients that you use regularly</p>
<p>that you really understand.</p>
<p>And so we often see, you know, I see the American pantry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got tons of sauces and tons of spices</p>
<p>and tons of spice blends.</p>
<p>And then really people only use just a couple of things.</p>
<p>And the idea that you can sort of splash out</p>
<p>and do Korean one night and then tacos the next night,</p>
<p>you can absolutely, but to get in a regular cadence</p>
<p>of specific ingredients,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably gonna get more mastery with that sooner.</p>
<p>And I think as much as you can do</p>
<p>to get an understanding of the basics around salt and acid</p>
<p>and understand your palette,</p>
<p>like for me, it&rsquo;s lemon and usually sherry vinegar, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my acid palette.</p>
<p>And my fat palates, you know, suet and butter, olive oil.</p>
<p>So you can sort of choose your language,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re painting with,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t splash out and say, do I use sesame oil?</p>
<p>Yeah, every once in a while,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not part of my base palette, right?</p>
<p>Can you say again what your fat palette is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be butter, suet and olive oil.</p>
<p>And olive oil, so not, why olive oil?</p>
<p>Is it your roots in Italy?</p>
<p>I like the flavor for finish</p>
<p>because of the bitterness that it adds.</p>
<p>So I like the bitter and acid contrast on meat</p>
<p>and vegetables, which is mostly what I eat.</p>
<p>And so I love that way that the bitterness</p>
<p>and astringency complements</p>
<p>and allows the flavors to come out.</p>
<p>What do you think about coconut oil?</p>
<p>I recently discovered that there&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sweetness or there&rsquo;s something to it</p>
<p>that I really enjoy, maybe because it&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good with heat.</p>
<p>And I really love it for some reason.</p>
<p>As a chef, do you ever try it?</p>
<p>What do you think about it?</p>
<p>I like it in coffee.</p>
<p>I like it as a treat a little bit.</p>
<p>I find the flavor a little bit challenging in foods.</p>
<p>I also find that it&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>on the quality of that ingredient.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve found often that I buy a high quality coconut oil</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s rancidity in it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t totally know why.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just the cold chain</p>
<p>and how that product&rsquo;s packaged.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had some issues with product quality in that.</p>
<p>But for me, it&rsquo;s a little bit too much sweetness</p>
<p>in my foods, but then again,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t cook in like a Southeast Asian palette.</p>
<p>I try to not have much sweetness in my foods in general.</p>
<p>So I, just because of the palette that I like to cook with.</p>
<p>So for me, coconut&rsquo;s got a little bit too much</p>
<p>of those high notes and earthiness,</p>
<p>which is a nice combination, but it&rsquo;s more like a treat.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is almost like a treat.</p>
<p>It has a flavor of its own that almost stands on its own.</p>
<p>Like I could probably just eat coconut.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the only oil I could enjoy by itself.</p>
<p>It sounds weird to say,</p>
<p>but it feels like fat is often a thing</p>
<p>that enriches the flavor of something else.</p>
<p>Coconut can almost stand on its own.</p>
<p>You might also be responding to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex flavor.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also, there&rsquo;s an analogous,</p>
<p>you know, if you look at butter, for example,</p>
<p>a lot of the butter that we eat in the US</p>
<p>is just sweet cream butter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not cultured.</p>
<p>If you explore like a cultured fermented butter,</p>
<p>maybe a grass milk, grass fed and finished butter,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get a ton more complexity.</p>
<p>And so you may also just be responding</p>
<p>to having fats with more flavor,</p>
<p>which is the journey in the US</p>
<p>has been towards refined foods that are very neutral.</p>
<p>And then you have to combine more of them</p>
<p>to make things taste like things.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re coming from a background</p>
<p>of using mostly just generic butter</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say canola oil to cook with,</p>
<p>those are very neutral oils.</p>
<p>So you can also take some of your favorite fats</p>
<p>and look for versions of them that are more flavorful.</p>
<p>I mean, I love olive oil as a treat in a spoon.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Like a good California extra virgin olive oil.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just like have it as,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll eat a piece of butter as a treat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, or butter with salt on it.</p>
<p>Like good fats can, all of them can be,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re minimally processed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fabulous and it&rsquo;s so delicious, right?</p>
<p>But there are things that you have to like look for</p>
<p>a version of them that&rsquo;s got that full palette of flavor.</p>
<p>Well, for me also the flavors are inextricably tied</p>
<p>to the memories I&rsquo;ve had with those flavors.</p>
<p>So for better or worse,</p>
<p>back when I used to eat a lot of ice cream,</p>
<p>I for some reason had a lot of pleasant experience</p>
<p>with coconut ice cream.</p>
<p>So that particular flavor just permeates</p>
<p>throughout my life now.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m stuck with it for better or worse</p>
<p>as a flavor that brings up pleasant memories.</p>
<p>And as I have a few such flavors,</p>
<p>I have such relationship with all kinds of meat too.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just so many pleasant memories and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re almost tasting the memories.</p>
<p>And that there&rsquo;s no way to separate the flavor</p>
<p>from the memories, I suppose.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a powerful thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite meal to cook?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll roast a couple of chickens</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll poach them, like I&rsquo;ll boil them</p>
<p>and let it cool down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let them cool down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pull all the meat off, put the bones back into the pot</p>
<p>and then cook that for like three or four hours</p>
<p>and then add in like shiitake mushrooms</p>
<p>and all the chicken meat.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll throw in a bottle of white wine</p>
<p>into the stock as well, a bunch of thyme and garlic.</p>
<p>And I love it because it&rsquo;s the way the house smells.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very laborious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s soothing for me to spend time picking apart meat</p>
<p>and chopping things up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a lot of manuality around it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say from a personal, like, I mean,</p>
<p>I love grilling a steak and doing those things as well,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about making a stock from scratch</p>
<p>and the way it smells, the way I feel,</p>
<p>the time it takes, the kind of checking in on it</p>
<p>that I really, really love.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many things I love to make</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t even love to eat.</p>
<p>I think you see this a lot in like baking and bakers,</p>
<p>people who bake a ton and they love the process of it,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t eat that many baked goods.</p>
<p>So anything for me that&rsquo;s really like enjoyable</p>
<p>is typically things like making cinnamon buns.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t eat very many cinnamon buns,</p>
<p>but I love making them because it takes all the sort</p>
<p>of like futzing around and taking your time and watching it</p>
<p>and the way it smells, the way the house smells.</p>
<p>All of that stuff is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like almost like a meditative exercise for me.</p>
<p>Is there a science, is there an art to cooking meat well</p>
<p>and the different kinds of meats?</p>
<p>Is there something you can convert it towards</p>
<p>in to say ideas, how to bring out the best of it</p>
<p>out of what particular meat,</p>
<p>whatever steak we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>whatever beef we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Is there something that can be said?</p>
<p>The basic approach to cooking any type of meat</p>
<p>beyond the artistry of it is pretty scientific.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what type of muscle is it in the animal</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the surface area to volume ratio?</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s look at those two questions.</p>
<p>So the first piece is what&rsquo;s the type of muscle</p>
<p>in the animal?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the functionality?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to know that to evaluate it,</p>
<p>but you need to understand, is it a tender muscle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not used very frequently in the animal?</p>
<p>Or is it a big load bearing muscle</p>
<p>that gets a lot of action, like the cheek, right?</p>
<p>Or the shin or those pieces?</p>
<p>The muscles like those along the spinal cord</p>
<p>that make up rib eyes and New York steaks and things,</p>
<p>those aren&rsquo;t very exercised.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re right next to the spinal cord.</p>
<p>Spinal cord&rsquo;s doing most of the work there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of like stabilizing muscles</p>
<p>around this big functional piece of skeletal structure</p>
<p>in the animal.</p>
<p>Other muscles, like the ones around the diaphragm</p>
<p>with the flat iron steaks and skirt steaks and things,</p>
<p>those are really functional muscles</p>
<p>that are doing a ton and moving.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re moving a lot, what happens?</p>
<p>Well, functionally, they&rsquo;ve got lots of muscle sheaths</p>
<p>because muscles that move frequently</p>
<p>have to do a lot of like complex contraction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s, in the cheek, for example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s tons of visible fiber</p>
<p>of like collagenous connective tissue.</p>
<p>That connective tissue is everything in how the meat cooks</p>
<p>because connective tissue doesn&rsquo;t respond to high heat</p>
<p>with becoming more tender.</p>
<p>Muscles do, right?</p>
<p>They can get a sear on them.</p>
<p>You can cut them and eat them.</p>
<p>The collagenous tissue will glom up and get really tough.</p>
<p>So you either have to liquefy it</p>
<p>with really low, slow heat with moisture, right?</p>
<p>Or you have to barely cook it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the major piece.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the question of like,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you just throw a brisket on the grill?</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the fat.</p>
<p>You can cut the fat out.</p>
<p>The reason you&rsquo;re not gonna throw a brisket on the grill</p>
<p>and cook it hot and fast</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s got too much collagenous connective tissue in it.</p>
<p>Those are these giant muscles that have all this collagen</p>
<p>and these fibers and tendons in them effectively.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re never gonna be able to just cook that up</p>
<p>hot and fast.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first piece.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, where&rsquo;s this muscle in the architecture</p>
<p>of the animal?</p>
<p>And then what does that mean for what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in the muscle?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually more important than fat content.</p>
<p>We get really kind of,</p>
<p>we pay a lot of attention to fat content in muscles.</p>
<p>You can make a steak tender</p>
<p>if it doesn&rsquo;t have a ton of fat in it.</p>
<p>It actually has more to do if there&rsquo;s collagenous</p>
<p>and connective tissue in it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I never even thought about that.</p>
<p>I just, I thought it kind of universal.</p>
<p>I mean, it adds to the texture of the meat,</p>
<p>the chewiness of the meat.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s also adds to how the meat is cooked.</p>
<p>How heat, how it reacts to heat,</p>
<p>how the entirety of the meat reacts to heat.</p>
<p>And the fat is not as important to that as the collagen.</p>
<p>The fat will make the flavor more delicious, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;ll add unctuousness and mouthfeel</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But all the connective tissue in meat</p>
<p>and in some of the cuts,</p>
<p>like that we ate at a skirt steak last night,</p>
<p>you could see a web of that collagen sheath on the outside.</p>
<p>On a ribeye, that same collagen sheath is this big.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one.</p>
<p>It goes around the outside, okay?</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s just that muscle, there&rsquo;s one large muscle fiber.</p>
<p>So that specific, it&rsquo;s a myelin sheath, right?</p>
<p>That material needs moisture</p>
<p>and low and slow heat to become tender.</p>
<p>The other side of that is that when it becomes tender,</p>
<p>it liquefies and it adds all this beautiful</p>
<p>gelatinous consistency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what bone broth is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why like a slow cooked pork shoulder is so delicious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s full of all that fat.</p>
<p>That fat&rsquo;s also great.</p>
<p>But a lot of that mouthfeel comes from that really</p>
<p>beautiful dissolved collagen.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re looking at like,</p>
<p>how do I understand how I&rsquo;m gonna cook a piece of meat?</p>
<p>That first fork in the road is,</p>
<p>how is this gonna respond to heat?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the appropriate cooking technique?</p>
<p>Then the second piece is that surface area to volume ratio.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s important because the heat is gonna impact</p>
<p>the meat through the surfaces of the meat</p>
<p>that are in contact with the heat.</p>
<p>So if I have a steak that&rsquo;s three inches thick,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna cook it extremely differently from a steak</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a half inch thick or three quarters of an inch thick.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the major, and that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>If I have a piece of pork shoulder that&rsquo;s cut into cubes</p>
<p>versus having a whole pork shoulder,</p>
<p>that surface area to volume ratio,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna totally change how I cook it.</p>
<p>And same things like pot roast and a beef stew</p>
<p>would be the same cut of meat, right?</p>
<p>But how I cook them is gonna change</p>
<p>based on the surface area to volume.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve gotta let moisture and heat</p>
<p>work its way into the center of the meat.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna be determined by the amount of surface</p>
<p>of the meat that&rsquo;s in contact with whatever cooking liquid</p>
<p>or heat you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>Is there different sources of heat to play with?</p>
<p>Like a big flame versus a small,</p>
<p>or maybe even like almost no flame,</p>
<p>like over coals, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Is there some science to the source of heat</p>
<p>in how it plays with the meat?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s indirect heat and direct heat.</p>
<p>And that really is mostly about temperature</p>
<p>in more than actual, I mean, smoke is important as well</p>
<p>that can permeate, but really the smoke</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go into the center of most cuts that you barbecue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll come in like the smoke ring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a maximum like half an inch on the outside,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit deeper on a really long, slow cook.</p>
<p>So they, but the smoke, that does create a ton of flavor</p>
<p>on the surface of the meat.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, so the indirect allows you to have</p>
<p>smoke contacting it and then a very,</p>
<p>very low and slow heat.</p>
<p>And what that does is indirect heat will be low</p>
<p>and slow enough that the center of the meat will get warm</p>
<p>at the same time as the exterior of the meat.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll all cook equally and all get equally tender.</p>
<p>If you go very hot and fast,</p>
<p>you risk the interior of the meat not getting right.</p>
<p>You kind of create a shell on the, on it.</p>
<p>And you slow down the interior of the meat,</p>
<p>which you actually want to do with something</p>
<p>like a steak where you want to keep it rare on the inside.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really indirect versus direct.</p>
<p>Then once you get into direct heat, right,</p>
<p>look at in that category, there&rsquo;s wood, charcoal, gas,</p>
<p>right, that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>And those are meaningfully different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re meaningfully different.</p>
<p>Charcoal and wood, that&rsquo;s more of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more poetry and wood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit more flavor,</p>
<p>not functionally very different,</p>
<p>but gas versus charcoal wood is very different.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the actual scent of the,</p>
<p>of the cook, right, the scent of the flavor.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I think an evenness of heat distribution</p>
<p>that comes off of charcoal that&rsquo;s different from gas,</p>
<p>because no matter how awesome your gas grill is,</p>
<p>you do have hotter and cooler spots.</p>
<p>So gas grills are typically,</p>
<p>you can kind of control for that</p>
<p>if you just are going really hot and fast,</p>
<p>which is why gas grills are fine</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just like throwing that steak on,</p>
<p>get a hard sear on it, those burgers put a crust on it.</p>
<p>Gas is fabulous for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing things that do better</p>
<p>with a low and slow cook,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say a whole tenderloin or chicken thigh,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be a little bit less elegant on gas</p>
<p>than on charcoal versus wood.</p>
<p>So when you have more,</p>
<p>more kind of nuance in the low, slow cook</p>
<p>over the natural fuels.</p>
<p>Talking about like smoke and flame and charcoal versus gas,</p>
<p>it also adds to the experience and the smell</p>
<p>and the whole thing of the cooking,</p>
<p>like versus just like the taste it creates.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain experience too,</p>
<p>like when there&rsquo;s a bit of smoke,</p>
<p>maybe I don&rsquo;t know what the chemistry of it is,</p>
<p>but I feel like with smoke,</p>
<p>the smell is distributed more effectively.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a smell and a visual aspect to the experience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s almost enriched with a bit of smoke</p>
<p>or like an open flame.</p>
<p>Like if you can see the flame, there&rsquo;s magic to that.</p>
<p>And it goes to the experience piece</p>
<p>that we were talking about before.</p>
<p>We were talking exactly about that,</p>
<p>like the nuance and the beauty of like that long, slow cook</p>
<p>and your house smelling like something.</p>
<p>Why do people freak out about barbecue?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you go in and it smells bomb.</p>
<p>It smells so good.</p>
<p>It smells like heaven, right?</p>
<p>It smells fatty and delicious and the smells everywhere</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s smelling the same smell.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like this collective experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I mean, I think that&rsquo;s why barbecue</p>
<p>is so sticky for people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like so yummy</p>
<p>and you get this huge like anticipatory thing about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, cause it smells incredible.</p>
<p>What was that incredible grill that we used yesterday?</p>
<p>What is that about?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called a Sea Island Forge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wood fire grill that&rsquo;s inspired</p>
<p>by like a South American style of cooking.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s big.</p>
<p>It has also the things with the crank.</p>
<p>It allows you to control the distance from the flame.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really key with the wood fire.</p>
<p>So when we evolved from cooking over wood to charcoal,</p>
<p>right, when that became more popular,</p>
<p>the reason that we did that is that allowed us</p>
<p>to skip the whole part of making our own charcoal, right?</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re cooking over wood,</p>
<p>all you&rsquo;re doing is making your own charcoal.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t ever cook over wood with the red fire.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t like throw a steak on</p>
<p>when the flames are orange and leaping up</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just gonna get, you know,</p>
<p>carbons like char all over your meat.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, when you&rsquo;re cooking over wood,</p>
<p>you first cook down the wood,</p>
<p>you create the coal base, the natural coal base,</p>
<p>and then you cook over that.</p>
<p>So you saw yesterday, I built my fire,</p>
<p>I let it burn down, added some fresh wood</p>
<p>so I could reinforce my coals with new coals coming in.</p>
<p>But then I was actually cooking over the embers.</p>
<p>You shorten that cycle with charcoal, it&rsquo;s more efficient.</p>
<p>But what you lose is that whole cycle of, you know,</p>
<p>that really beautiful experience of smelling.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re cooking on a Traeger,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get awesome smoke smell.</p>
<p>You know, like there&rsquo;s plenty of ways to do this.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t always have to be wood fire.</p>
<p>And I love all the different ways, right?</p>
<p>But I really like the experience of the campfire.</p>
<p>And I love that kind of just like sitting by it,</p>
<p>building it, having to take the time.</p>
<p>I like building the fire, going inside,</p>
<p>preparing all my meats, bringing them out, cooking them.</p>
<p>That whole experience start to finish</p>
<p>is really just like something that it&rsquo;s my favorite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my favorite way to spend time, you know?</p>
<p>So I think, and why is that?</p>
<p>Is the food that different than cooking it</p>
<p>in a more conventional grill?</p>
<p>Probably not, you know, like in a pure experience.</p>
<p>But I think the actual experience is super memorable</p>
<p>because you are outside, you are still in your role.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re enjoying this, you know, you&rsquo;re just taking in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re watching, you&rsquo;re anticipating.</p>
<p>I love that whole experience.</p>
<p>Does the origin of the meat itself make a difference?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re here at Belcampo Farms</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll, maybe you could talk about what your vision,</p>
<p>your dream is in terms of like food,</p>
<p>in terms of where food comes from,</p>
<p>where meat comes from, but food broadly,</p>
<p>and how that affects the entirety of the culinary journey.</p>
<p>On the question of where does it come from</p>
<p>and does that matter, I&rsquo;d say the way that meat is raised</p>
<p>is massively important for flavor and for how it cooks.</p>
<p>I think most cooks who try cooking grass fed</p>
<p>versus corn fed, that&rsquo;s the first moment</p>
<p>where they realize that, right?</p>
<p>Where corn fed meat cooks much more slowly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got bigger veins of fat that slow the heat transfer</p>
<p>throughout the muscle of the animal,</p>
<p>compared to grass fed, which is leaner,</p>
<p>heat moves through it more quickly,</p>
<p>those steaks will cook much, much faster.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s very kind of technical reasons why,</p>
<p>how meat is raised that we&rsquo;re aware of.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s other things that I&rsquo;ve noticed,</p>
<p>like that slower growing poultry</p>
<p>has a very, very different musculature and fiber to it</p>
<p>than fast growing poultry, that&rsquo;s confinement animals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it has to do with the way</p>
<p>that the muscles are built.</p>
<p>They tend to be finer and thinner and more tender</p>
<p>and a little bit more susceptible to heat.</p>
<p>So the character of the meat&rsquo;s radically different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also much more flavorful</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s grown more naturally.</p>
<p>And I think some of the reliance in the US</p>
<p>on like sugary sauces and lots of salts</p>
<p>and flavors and things like that&rsquo;s actually based</p>
<p>on having the broadly available meat out there</p>
<p>is pretty low on flavor.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re adding in a lot to compensate for that.</p>
<p>So to your point of like enjoying things very simply</p>
<p>and with like salt and nothing else,</p>
<p>like the more flavorful that product is,</p>
<p>I think the more people will find that enjoyable.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s paint a vision.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re a visionary.</p>
<p>You have a vision to have basically meat in every store</p>
<p>that comes from a farm like Belcampo</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically doing regenerative farming.</p>
<p>How do we get there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a network of smaller producers</p>
<p>working together with shared values.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true that there&rsquo;s a limit on regenerative farming</p>
<p>in that it requires more human knowledge.</p>
<p>So regenerative farming is more difficult to scale</p>
<p>in a single operation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be really challenging to have a regenerative farm</p>
<p>that was like 200,000 acres</p>
<p>because of the amount of manpower needed to pay attention.</p>
<p>Can you first, and I apologize to interrupt,</p>
<p>but can you say what is regenerative farming?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re looking at scaling regenerative farming,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a traditional system of agriculture.</p>
<p>Regenerative farming is how we used to farm.</p>
<p>We used to farm with an eye towards the longterm.</p>
<p>You might be on the Friedman farm thinking about your heirs</p>
<p>five generations from now farming that same land.</p>
<p>Are you gonna leave that land nutritionally empty?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a longterm thinking.</p>
<p>Also in traditional ag, you don&rsquo;t have inputs.</p>
<p>That are very convenient. You can put some chicken manure on,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t spray or dump something that massively</p>
<p>increases the growing potential of the land.</p>
<p>That was not available until the past 60 years.</p>
<p>So regenerative agriculture is an approach to farming</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re increasing soil fertility through your farming.</p>
<p>You increase soil fertility by feeding the soil.</p>
<p>You feed the soil through carbon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why regenerative farming is better</p>
<p>for the environment.</p>
<p>It sequesters carbon and puts carbon into the soil.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Plants need carbon and put it into the soil</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re going through growth.</p>
<p>So if you have a beautiful field of grass</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just waving in the wind,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re gonna get the most</p>
<p>of the carbon that&rsquo;s going into the soil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not sequestering as much carbon</p>
<p>as plants that have been damaged and are regrowing.</p>
<p>Plants that have been damaged and are regrowing</p>
<p>are repairing and they&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>by drawing down carbon as one of the nutrients</p>
<p>that feeds them.</p>
<p>To damage the plants effectively,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing with regenerative grazing.</p>
<p>So the cows or, you know, lambs or whatever out there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eating and taking the grass down</p>
<p>and that then cause a regrowth cycle</p>
<p>that sequesters carbon.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a limit to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an edge,</p>
<p>because if those plants are so damaged</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t regrow,</p>
<p>then it turns into a dirt patch</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t sequester any carbon.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>How do you find that balance?</p>
<p>That has to do with like the frequency</p>
<p>and the scale of the grazing essentially?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so you have to find the right balance</p>
<p>and that connects to both the grass.</p>
<p>I mean, is the ultimately the focus here</p>
<p>is on the life cycle of whatever is grazing,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s cows or lambs or so on?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the scalability question.</p>
<p>So all that stuff that I just talked about,</p>
<p>like think about all the actions that that requires.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s out there looking and paying attention</p>
<p>and understanding how far the grass is,</p>
<p>remembering what happened in that field last year.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge human intelligence need</p>
<p>and human kind of availability of attention.</p>
<p>Now, industrial farming has done a great job</p>
<p>at de skilling agriculture.</p>
<p>Industrial farming has taken agriculture</p>
<p>from being art science to being entry level employment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the limiting factor on regen</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I think&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a human intelligence piece.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I gotta ask,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you think about this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I mentioned to you offline</p>
<p>that I spent a bit of time with some robots</p>
<p>and Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>to use artificial intelligence to help?</p>
<p>So data collection,</p>
<p>so automating some of the things that makes humans special,</p>
<p>make some of that decision,</p>
<p>some of that memory that&rsquo;s then utilized,</p>
<p>converges to knowledge to make decisions</p>
<p>about the crops and so on.</p>
<p>Is there a way AI can help?</p>
<p>Do you think?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I mean, that would be incredible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the ingredients</p>
<p>that could help with the regenerative farming.</p>
<p>A number of discrete decision points</p>
<p>that could completely be automated as well</p>
<p>in order to supplement and work with somebody,</p>
<p>like a farmer in managing it,</p>
<p>about the performance on land.</p>
<p>And a bit of that&rsquo;s being done right now</p>
<p>with some aerial mapping,</p>
<p>but that type of AI would be huge in this.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s estimates that if the damage</p>
<p>and underutilized rangeland in the world</p>
<p>was converted to regenerative agriculture</p>
<p>somewhere between like 20 and 40% of the world&rsquo;s carbon</p>
<p>could be sequestered.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge potential.</p>
<p>The problem is cultural.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve like lost the generational thread of knowledge</p>
<p>about how to do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of been two generations</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t farmed this way.</p>
<p>Also the science around it is limited</p>
<p>by the scale and longevity.</p>
<p>So the data collection around regenerative farming</p>
<p>is also limited by the fact it&rsquo;s kind of piecemeal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s small operations that are doing it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re learning and developing as they go,</p>
<p>and they haven&rsquo;t been documenting it</p>
<p>and doing it for too long.</p>
<p>Is the ethical treatment of animals</p>
<p>a part of regenerative farming?</p>
<p>So in the way you do things at Belcampo,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge part.</p>
<p>Is that necessarily part of the life cycle?</p>
<p>So like the things that you&rsquo;re trying to measure</p>
<p>is like the way, like not damaging the land too much,</p>
<p>make sure that the sort of the land</p>
<p>is constantly healthy and is producing,</p>
<p>and then the grazing process,</p>
<p>and also the carbon piece,</p>
<p>the fact that it&rsquo;s a carbon neutral or something like that.</p>
<p>I mean, are all of those pieces of the regenerative farming</p>
<p>or is this an extra part to your vision</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re thinking about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all implicit and regenerative.</p>
<p>I call it out separately because we are certified humane,</p>
<p>which is another layer of welfare</p>
<p>that has to do with density and a couple other things.</p>
<p>But regenerative, I mean, think about it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a cow and you&rsquo;re in a regenerative operation</p>
<p>where the whole life cycle of the pasture</p>
<p>means that you only eat the top six inches of the grass,</p>
<p>and then when there&rsquo;s whatever, a couple inches left,</p>
<p>then that field is left dormant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a better experience, right?</p>
<p>So just think about it kind of functionally that way.</p>
<p>Well, grazing period is a better experience, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s done in,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the grass fed piece, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other piece with certified organics, amazing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of certifications</p>
<p>that grass fed and finished is also great,</p>
<p>but there are workarounds for those.</p>
<p>You can have certified organic feedlots.</p>
<p>You can have grass fed and finished,</p>
<p>which is an animal fed a grass seed pellet.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t things that we do here, right?</p>
<p>And regenerative captures that.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s like anything,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re isolating these very specific certifications,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have a holistic approach.</p>
<p>Regenerative though, unfortunately, isn&rsquo;t certified yet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten USDA approval to use that word</p>
<p>based on our carbon sequestration data,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a regulated term.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the mix right now</p>
<p>is to figure out how to document it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not totally clear what it means</p>
<p>like for pigs and chickens, which are omnivores.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear for ruminants,</p>
<p>which are animals that have a rumen that eat grass.</p>
<p>For omnivores, which is like what we are,</p>
<p>they eat primarily grain in farming operations,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a little bit more complex.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a moving landscape,</p>
<p>but regenerative as a word is the better definition</p>
<p>of the whole life cycle approach</p>
<p>of letting animals and nature work together.</p>
<p>Is it true that it&rsquo;s possible to have a farm</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t produce, sort of is carbon neutral?</p>
<p>We have been third party verified</p>
<p>to be carbon impact negative.</p>
<p>So Belcampo&rsquo;s 25,000 acres and the animals here,</p>
<p>all of the carbon, including from our shipping</p>
<p>on our mail order is all offset</p>
<p>by the amount of grazing that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Also that encompasses our partner farms.</p>
<p>We buy a number of live animals in from other partner farms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their impacts also incorporated in that.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And second of all, is that possible to scale?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s complex to scale,</p>
<p>but I mean, we&rsquo;re putting people on the moon</p>
<p>and you have a robotic dog.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s less about scale, that&rsquo;s more about innovation.</p>
<p>So like in many ways what Belcampo has done</p>
<p>is innovative at a small scale.</p>
<p>The question is whether that innovation can be scaled.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I feel like we in the industry need more help.</p>
<p>You know, the AI piece, the intelligence,</p>
<p>the thinking about ways to do things differently</p>
<p>is where we need more support.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s been a, you know,</p>
<p>a kind of a swing in the past couple of years</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like meat&rsquo;s a mess, it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s ditch meat and opt for these hyper process,</p>
<p>you know, plant based solutions.</p>
<p>And I am saying there&rsquo;s a way to make meat</p>
<p>a part of the solution.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna mean eating less of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna mean paying more for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna mean that the farming systems</p>
<p>are more complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the easiest path,</p>
<p>but I think in the long term it&rsquo;s the better path.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also better for human health.</p>
<p>Can you comment on the certified humane piece?</p>
<p>So how do you run a farm?</p>
<p>Like what does it mean to raise an animal</p>
<p>from the beginning of its life to the end of its life</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s ethical, that&rsquo;s humane?</p>
<p>I think the first piece you need to just be comfortable with</p>
<p>is that making an animal into meat, you know,</p>
<p>is something that you&rsquo;re comfortable with.</p>
<p>Cause I think that&rsquo;s the biggest question, right?</p>
<p>And so certified humane actually goes all the way through</p>
<p>the death of the animal,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s killed and handled at processing.</p>
<p>So I put that out there just to say,</p>
<p>well, this is all about producing an animal to die for meat.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not necessarily,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something people struggle with with the word humane.</p>
<p>And I understand that.</p>
<p>Like I have space and empathy for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated decision.</p>
<p>And when you have to be comfortable with at the outset</p>
<p>to say, this is an animal that&rsquo;s gonna die to feed me.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we should pause on that</p>
<p>cause I actually just the two days ago read a paper</p>
<p>that argued that, you know,</p>
<p>the killing of an animal period cannot be humane.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>And so, and that&rsquo;s an argument just like you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>we could make, but if we now on the table kind of</p>
<p>take as a starting point, the idea that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to kill an animal for food in an ethical way,</p>
<p>if we take that as a starting point.</p>
<p>So we won&rsquo;t argue about that.</p>
<p>It is worth arguing about it elsewhere.</p>
<p>And it probably will.</p>
<p>I will probably talk to a few vegan folks</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about the vegan diet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by it as well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m torn in the whole thing.</p>
<p>But if we just take that as a starting point,</p>
<p>what then is an ethical humane way to treat an animal?</p>
<p>I look at ethical humane animal treatment</p>
<p>as the major phases of life.</p>
<p>So conception, birth and mothering,</p>
<p>diet, those are kind of the major touch points of life.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re looking at is evolutionary approach,</p>
<p>which means is the animal eating</p>
<p>what it evolved to eat primarily?</p>
<p>Is the animal primarily outdoors,</p>
<p>which is how all animals evolved,</p>
<p>given when the climate&rsquo;s appropriate for it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain times when you can&rsquo;t have animals</p>
<p>fully outdoors, like here on our ranch,</p>
<p>we have had issues with cold weather and things.</p>
<p>But so if you have appropriate weather conditions,</p>
<p>does the animal outdoors?</p>
<p>Is the animal able to nurture and engage with its young?</p>
<p>Those are the kind of key touch points,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really the birth of it.</p>
<p>Let me start this one from the scratch.</p>
<p>Okay, so when I&rsquo;m looking at,</p>
<p>or when I consider what&rsquo;s humane,</p>
<p>setting aside the death part,</p>
<p>I look at the evolutionary diet,</p>
<p>access to the outdoors,</p>
<p>and ideally spending the majority of its life outdoors,</p>
<p>low density, so animals spread out,</p>
<p>and engagement with young, social interactions,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all kind of simplistic.</p>
<p>Social interaction is a cool one.</p>
<p>I mean, I also read an article that like,</p>
<p>cows, for example, have social, like they have friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, that piece with the young,</p>
<p>social interaction with young,</p>
<p>social interaction with each other,</p>
<p>that at a basic level,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that interaction is not as rich as humans,</p>
<p>but that piece seems to be part of the humane picture.</p>
<p>And you said also, just a quick comment,</p>
<p>evolutionary diet, meaning the diet</p>
<p>that they were evolved to have.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty simple.</p>
<p>You can look at the physiology of the animal</p>
<p>and figure that out.</p>
<p>So ruminant species are lamb, goats, and beef,</p>
<p>and they have five stomachs.</p>
<p>They evolved eating really low calorie, high fiber foods.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve got all the stomachs.</p>
<p>They need a lot of processing.</p>
<p>You or I were to eat grass, we die in a week, right?</p>
<p>Our physiology can&rsquo;t handle it.</p>
<p>Cows were built and evolved to eat this very low calorie,</p>
<p>very high fiber, very low density food.</p>
<p>And they walk around slowly,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re moving constantly and they&rsquo;re eating it.</p>
<p>When we put them on a corn fed diet,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the opposite of their evolutionary diet</p>
<p>and their systems really struggle with it.</p>
<p>Now, pigs and chickens are different.</p>
<p>Pigs and chickens are omnivores</p>
<p>and pigs will happily eat chickens, for example.</p>
<p>Our pigs on the farm will hunt and kill rattlesnakes</p>
<p>and eat them.</p>
<p>They enjoy all of it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re omnivores.</p>
<p>So that you often see,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen people try to raise like a grass fed chicken</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I mean, they need a higher, omnivores eat everything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re what&rsquo;s called monogastric.</p>
<p>They got one stomach</p>
<p>and that one stomach needs higher density nutrients.</p>
<p>So in the case of chicken,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re to do, look back in American history</p>
<p>and in the 1950s, it took,</p>
<p>commercial chickens took like 54 weeks</p>
<p>to come to full weight.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s two and a half weeks in confinement farming</p>
<p>on our systems, it&rsquo;s like eight to 10 weeks typically.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very,</p>
<p>you have to give them some amount of nutrient density,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s the idea that no grain,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a misinformation</p>
<p>for any type of commercial operation,</p>
<p>free range, regenerative, pastured, everything,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to have a grain feed to get any type of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually, I think for the case of chickens,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re in a place with like tons of natural seeds</p>
<p>and grubs and worms and stuff to eat,</p>
<p>really challenging for the chicken.</p>
<p>So you gotta give them some high density,</p>
<p>high calorie food different from that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the evolutionary diet is a really key thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fundamental thing for health.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also interesting</p>
<p>because the evolutionary diet ties to human health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at the nutritional analysis</p>
<p>on all of our products and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the evolutionary diet is for the case of beef and lamb</p>
<p>gets their omega three to six ratios,</p>
<p>the same as wild game.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like beef is really radically different</p>
<p>from elk, a ruminant species, right?</p>
<p>If you feed beef an evolutionary diet,</p>
<p>their nutritional profile is the same as wild meat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wild ruminant.</p>
<p>I got a chance to witness Neuralink,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with that company,</p>
<p>the brain computer interfaces.</p>
<p>And they have, I got a chance to see in person</p>
<p>just a bunch of pigs who had Neuralink chips implanted</p>
<p>and taken out.</p>
<p>Those pigs are so happy with life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve never seen a happier animal.</p>
<p>I mean, cause they get to eat,</p>
<p>cause you were mentioning sort of diets and stuff.</p>
<p>Pigs seem to love a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re easily made to be happy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment on your thoughts</p>
<p>of exploring the capacity of the pig mind</p>
<p>through some of this testing with Neuralink,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s exciting to you,</p>
<p>whether maybe on the humane side,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit concerning,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s something to be said on sort of like,</p>
<p>yeah, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s even the ethical side,</p>
<p>but just because of your connection to meat</p>
<p>and to nature and understanding these living beings.</p>
<p>Well, pigs are incredibly intelligent.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not surprised that they&rsquo;re a subject matter</p>
<p>for Neuralink.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re smarter than dogs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re empathetic and emotional.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll go look at our pigs afterwards and see,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re kind of like joyful and exuberant</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in good health.</p>
<p>And so that makes sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested and open.</p>
<p>I feel that the kind of bleeding edge agriculture movement</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m on the edge of in some ways,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a larger operator,</p>
<p>but we as a movement have to get into the game.</p>
<p>We have to move forward in a way that allows us to scale</p>
<p>if we wanna be viable.</p>
<p>So I think there has to be openness to how that can happen.</p>
<p>And I also think there needs to be more thoughtful</p>
<p>and noisy data about how regenerative ranching</p>
<p>can sequester carbon.</p>
<p>I mean, thousands of American ranches</p>
<p>are selling carbon credits right now.</p>
<p>The data is that valid.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not selling carbon credits from like grassland</p>
<p>that just got a fence around it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re selling carbon credits for verified data</p>
<p>from animals assisting in carbon sequestration, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s got to be a way to get the tech community involved</p>
<p>in ways to help regenerative agriculture scale.</p>
<p>In different creative ways.</p>
<p>And actually, that&rsquo;d be interesting</p>
<p>if like Neuralink somehow has,</p>
<p>and especially because Elon Musk is involved</p>
<p>and Kimball Musk has his whole effort and appreciation</p>
<p>of regenerative agriculture</p>
<p>that I wonder if Neuralink has a role to play,</p>
<p>like exploring the neurobiology of the animal,</p>
<p>if that somehow will create innovations</p>
<p>that lead to improved scaling of regenerative agriculture.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be interesting.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying you should be open</p>
<p>to all those possibilities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I don&rsquo;t know the landscape to know what.</p>
<p>But my sense is that it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>And our farming operation to scale,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been incredibly complex and challenging.</p>
<p>We now work with partner farms.</p>
<p>I see their operations, they&rsquo;re incredibly complex.</p>
<p>You know, it just seems like there&rsquo;s got to be a way</p>
<p>to make some of these things simpler and easier</p>
<p>to share information.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that answer is.</p>
<p>You know what would be cool</p>
<p>is if we can understand deeper ways</p>
<p>to measure the happiness of an animal.</p>
<p>Because then we can optimize,</p>
<p>like certified humane could be literally</p>
<p>an optimization problem.</p>
<p>Just make sure, as opposed to kind of using our,</p>
<p>projecting our own human values,</p>
<p>actually measuring what the animal is happy doing.</p>
<p>That could be, so understanding the pig brain</p>
<p>might help us understand pig happiness</p>
<p>and reframe what it means for a happy animal.</p>
<p>And then maybe it&rsquo;s a lot easier to make a happy animal,</p>
<p>to make the animal happy than we think.</p>
<p>And it might have to do with a variety of delicious food</p>
<p>in the case of the pig.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say about grass fed meat?</p>
<p>Is it all, just out of my own sort of curiosity,</p>
<p>whenever people say sort of grass fed meat</p>
<p>is better for you,</p>
<p>are all grass fed meat made the same?</p>
<p>Is there different like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the word organic.</p>
<p>Is there a lot of variety within that?</p>
<p>Like the way Belcampo does it,</p>
<p>will the others do it?</p>
<p>Just more color if you could add to this whole word</p>
<p>and what it means.</p>
<p>Grass fed beef has been on grass its entire life.</p>
<p>And you wanna look for the words 100% grass fed</p>
<p>or grass fed and finished.</p>
<p>Now, the challenge with feeding beef grass its whole life</p>
<p>is that it gains weight more slowly.</p>
<p>Although beef didn&rsquo;t evolve,</p>
<p>eating corn and things, it can eat them.</p>
<p>And in eating them, it gains weight more rapidly</p>
<p>and has like a version of like an inflammatory response.</p>
<p>If you actually look inside the rumen of the animal</p>
<p>inside the stomach,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like black and shiny inside compared to grass fed</p>
<p>animals like greens, smells like compost.</p>
<p>So the animals themselves, their whole physiology</p>
<p>is damaged by that food,</p>
<p>but they also gain weight really quickly</p>
<p>and they put on a lot of fats.</p>
<p>Like if you or me were to eat a bunch of processed food</p>
<p>compared to eating a bunch of greens,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same impact, you&rsquo;re gonna blow up.</p>
<p>So the problem for grass fed</p>
<p>is getting the animals to gain weight.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting a ton of exercise,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eating really clean, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re super chill.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s different from the animals that are kept still</p>
<p>eating really nutrient dense foods</p>
<p>and under a ton of stress, which is a confinement animal.</p>
<p>So are all grass fed meats created the same?</p>
<p>The diet, yeah, nutritional profile broadly,</p>
<p>but the length of time that the animal lives</p>
<p>is extremely important for the flavor of the meat.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking our beef to 24 to 26 months,</p>
<p>conventional is around 18 months.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m always looking,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re evaluating grass fed animals,</p>
<p>you wanna get animals that are typically</p>
<p>allowed to live for longer</p>
<p>because their flavor is gonna be better,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a bit more fat</p>
<p>and their omega ratios also vary very differently.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen omega ratios,</p>
<p>in our firm everywhere from one to three to one to one,</p>
<p>ideal is one to one game is typically one to one</p>
<p>or one to two omega three to sixes.</p>
<p>But in operations where you don&rsquo;t have year round grass,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more complicated, you know, you&rsquo;re feeding hay</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get that three to six ratio.</p>
<p>Omega threes come from green grass,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the fat in greens.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re scarce and costly, right?</p>
<p>So you can have grass fed and finished animals</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have that perfect ratio</p>
<p>because maybe they&rsquo;re in a climate or for whatever reasons,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had to do it too, during the droughts do hay finishing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not optimal, it changes the ratio a bit.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a little bit of variance within it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say though, the variance is a little bit higher</p>
<p>the variance within grass fed is still small</p>
<p>compared to the variance between conventional</p>
<p>and grass fed, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s definitely things to look for within it,</p>
<p>but the real difference is between those two.</p>
<p>Also thing to notice is that it&rsquo;s not a verified word, okay?</p>
<p>So grass fed means animals that have been on grass</p>
<p>at some point in their life.</p>
<p>The way the cattle industry is in the US,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s segmentation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s cow calf operations,</p>
<p>then those calves get sold to stocker operations</p>
<p>which raised animals in their teens basically,</p>
<p>and then those get sold to feed lots.</p>
<p>And so those three phases,</p>
<p>that first phase of the cow calf is always on grass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mother cows and mom cows are amazing.</p>
<p>They can thrive on anything</p>
<p>and still put all their nutrients into their baby</p>
<p>and their babies will be healthy.</p>
<p>So you never are putting mother cows</p>
<p>on really premium pasture.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s usually just kind of like okay pasture,</p>
<p>dirty lot, if you ever see kind of like,</p>
<p>scrubly lots with lots of cows and calves on,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a cow calf operation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also a loophole, unfortunately,</p>
<p>where people use the term grass fed,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually referring to animals</p>
<p>that at some point in their life had grass,</p>
<p>but that might be pretty far in the rear view mirror.</p>
<p>So you need to look at that grass fed and finished</p>
<p>or grass fed 100%.</p>
<p>That ratio of omega three to sixes,</p>
<p>it changes in like a week on grain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s radically different.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s the same thing for you and me.</p>
<p>You can eat clean for a month,</p>
<p>you eat junk for three days, you&rsquo;re garbage, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you can just like coast on that, right?</p>
<p>We know what that&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Same thing for animals, our physiology changes.</p>
<p>Food&rsquo;s the number one way we interact with our environment.</p>
<p>And our body changes really rapidly and dramatically.</p>
<p>So we know Belcampo and just the way</p>
<p>sort of this regenerative farming approach of Belcampo</p>
<p>and the sort of high humane is good for the land,</p>
<p>is good for the animal.</p>
<p>Can you comment on ways it&rsquo;s good for the human</p>
<p>that eats the meat?</p>
<p>Is this meat better for you?</p>
<p>Yes, and this is where they kind of focus on the joy</p>
<p>and animals doing yoga and all this sort of like</p>
<p>cynical stuff about this type of agriculture.</p>
<p>So just like set that aside,</p>
<p>it really is better for your health.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a better fat ratio, it&rsquo;s less inflammatory,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got higher protein, it&rsquo;s just better product.</p>
<p>In the case of beef, it&rsquo;s lower in fat</p>
<p>and that fat has a better quality and it&rsquo;s higher</p>
<p>in poultry and pork, it&rsquo;s also higher in protein.</p>
<p>So all the nutritionals are better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got higher density of vitamins,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got higher density of minerals.</p>
<p>And none of this stuff is radically different than,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like the product is black and white,</p>
<p>but every metric meaningfully is better</p>
<p>in the right direction across the board.</p>
<p>So why wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>I hesitate to take anecdotal evidence</p>
<p>as like final scientific conclusions,</p>
<p>but it does seem I&rsquo;ve eaten quite a bit</p>
<p>of belcampo meat, for example,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just my body seems to respond,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s less bothered by it.</p>
<p>Meaning like less inflamed, I just feel better.</p>
<p>Because I mostly eat a meat diet</p>
<p>and it does seem to be a little bit of a difference</p>
<p>what kind of meat I eat, where it comes from.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s my own psychology also.</p>
<p>I mean, there is an aspect to like,</p>
<p>when you know that the meat came from a good place</p>
<p>and all the ways we&rsquo;ve defined good,</p>
<p>you feel better about it.</p>
<p>And that has an effect, like decreased stress.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge believer in that,</p>
<p>like outside of just nutrition,</p>
<p>how you feel about the whole experience is a huge impact.</p>
<p>But it does feel like the meat itself</p>
<p>is actually just leading to less inflammation for me</p>
<p>or like less, like the bloated feeling</p>
<p>and all those negative effects that could come with meat</p>
<p>versus like certain other ground beef that I eat,</p>
<p>like store bought chicken breast or steak,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>My body&rsquo;s a little bit more,</p>
<p>works a little bit harder to process that food,</p>
<p>it feels like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s science to that,</p>
<p>but sort of anecdotally, that seems to be the case.</p>
<p>Omega sixes are a big part of that,</p>
<p>for in the case of the beef.</p>
<p>You eat a lot of beef, you love beef.</p>
<p>And so in a conventional beef product,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a one to 30 ratio of omega threes to sixes.</p>
<p>And sometimes one to 20, one to 30,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the wrong direction.</p>
<p>In our beef, it&rsquo;s as low as one to one.</p>
<p>So that and the omega sixes are what&rsquo;s part of inflammation.</p>
<p>Now, the magic in animals</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re incredibly efficient processors.</p>
<p>And in the same way that the body can process</p>
<p>and take out tons of things that are toxic</p>
<p>out of the environment,</p>
<p>I mean, animals bodies can do that too.</p>
<p>So the beauty of meat is that it can be pretty clean.</p>
<p>Things like Roundup and stuff don&rsquo;t end up in the meat.</p>
<p>When we have antibiotics in our meat,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not worried about getting like tetracycline</p>
<p>from the chicken breast.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re worried about</p>
<p>is the workers getting tetracycline,</p>
<p>the chicken growing faster than it should,</p>
<p>the meat being chewier and not as high quality.</p>
<p>But the actual antibiotics don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the animals great at filtering that, right?</p>
<p>They get that out.</p>
<p>So you have to think about meat not as like contamination</p>
<p>of like, oh, there&rsquo;s gonna be some of that garbage</p>
<p>they used in the farming in my meat,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the more subtle things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fat ratio, it&rsquo;s the protein density.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also just, I think in my experience,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just more complex flavor</p>
<p>and things that taste more complex.</p>
<p>This is, science backs this up, they fill you up faster.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re looking to limit,</p>
<p>to eat for fullness and, but not eat as many calories,</p>
<p>more complex foods are the way to do that.</p>
<p>And that hit, you hit your satiety,</p>
<p>help you hit that satiety.</p>
<p>So things like, I mean, all the key amino acids</p>
<p>that help you feel full, mostly from meat, right?</p>
<p>So those are, that&rsquo;s part of it, like it,</p>
<p>but all meats have those.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s other kind of micronutrients</p>
<p>and things around that complex flavor</p>
<p>that help you feel full faster.</p>
<p>Forgive me for this question,</p>
<p>but it is kind of an interesting one</p>
<p>that people are curious about.</p>
<p>What does it feel like to be a,</p>
<p>or what does it take to be a woman CEO of a meat company?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re no longer CEO of Belcampo,</p>
<p>but you did, you ran, you cofounded Belcampo,</p>
<p>you ran it for many, many years.</p>
<p>Is there something that you could say</p>
<p>in terms of challenges associated with that?</p>
<p>And how did you personally overcome it?</p>
<p>So to be a female running a meat and livestock operation,</p>
<p>it felt very alone, a lot, you know, for a long time.</p>
<p>I felt very, like everybody waiting for me to fail</p>
<p>or watching and assuming that I was like,</p>
<p>just good at marketing or whatever else.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s taken me a while to not internalize that.</p>
<p>I think the only reason I&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>is we have our own supply chain in Slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>And I think had I really been playing</p>
<p>in the broader meat industry,</p>
<p>it would have been a shorter journey.</p>
<p>You know, it would have been very hard</p>
<p>to make it even get to this phase.</p>
<p>But I do, you know, I think the mission is my life&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>The mission of cleaner ingredients that tastes so amazing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do too much to them.</p>
<p>You know, I like creating food</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in support of good health.</p>
<p>And then secondary to that, it&rsquo;s the environment,</p>
<p>but I want healthy food to be a joy to eat, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, creating innovation in the space</p>
<p>for this company has been about building a brand</p>
<p>that people understand and is transparent</p>
<p>and that people believe in in an industry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s broadly perceived of as pretty corrupt.</p>
<p>So those are things I feel enormously proud of.</p>
<p>So you focused on the mission and the pushback,</p>
<p>all the mess of the industry.</p>
<p>You try not to internalize it,</p>
<p>trying not to let it affect you and focus on the mission.</p>
<p>You know, and it&rsquo;s in the joy of it</p>
<p>and the part where it&rsquo;s gotten fun for me</p>
<p>has been returning to what I love about it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve only had the privilege</p>
<p>of doing that pretty recently.</p>
<p>So I think for me personally, you know, starting,</p>
<p>I host these events on the farm called Meat Camps,</p>
<p>where I cook and teach people to cook</p>
<p>and, you know, taste and talk about flavor</p>
<p>and all the like sensual aspects of it that are my fire.</p>
<p>Like, thank goodness I did that stuff</p>
<p>because otherwise it was just such a beating.</p>
<p>You know, so there were parts of it</p>
<p>where I got to feed my fire.</p>
<p>And then now in the, you know, the past year,</p>
<p>since resigning, I&rsquo;ve been, I do all the recipe development.</p>
<p>I shoot all the content.</p>
<p>I, you know, taste product.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m developing all of our new products.</p>
<p>I launched our meatballs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just about to launch our chicken meatballs,</p>
<p>doing a high protein bone broth.</p>
<p>Like those are, that&rsquo;s why I did this</p>
<p>was to be able to build this great product</p>
<p>that I could build on.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of at that place now,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s taken a lot longer.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, looking at the landscape</p>
<p>of what to do in food, this is definitely,</p>
<p>we tackled the most complicated problem.</p>
<p>That I can imagine, you know, I did it like</p>
<p>in the most old fashioned way, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been super complex.</p>
<p>And then I also look at it and I&rsquo;m like, yeah,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been messy and it&rsquo;s gonna continue to be hard,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m proud of having tackled the hard problems.</p>
<p>So the hard problem here is not</p>
<p>in the space of technologies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the space of bringing something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve done for a long, long time in our human history</p>
<p>and scaling it in the face</p>
<p>of all the other economic pressures.</p>
<p>Like doing so successfully,</p>
<p>also communicating to the rest of the world</p>
<p>that this is a powerful solution.</p>
<p>So inspiring the rest of the world that regenerative farming,</p>
<p>like running a company in this kind of way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s humane for animals, good for the land,</p>
<p>good for people, even if it costs,</p>
<p>like if there&rsquo;s an increased cost to the meat,</p>
<p>even if that, if you have a broader vision</p>
<p>that means eating less meat overall,</p>
<p>that that is like inspiring the world</p>
<p>that this is a future we want.</p>
<p>And just taking that on and getting that done.</p>
<p>Got a chance to eat a little bit of cheese,</p>
<p>which is a good opportunity</p>
<p>to talk about your experience in Italy.</p>
<p>You spent some time, or as south of Europe,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it was Italy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I lived in Italy, but.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s cheese involved, right?</p>
<p>Like what did you take away from that experience,</p>
<p>both as a chef and as a human being?</p>
<p>I moved to Europe right after my early 20s</p>
<p>and I worked as a cheese maker.</p>
<p>And I lived in really small rural farms</p>
<p>in the countryside.</p>
<p>And I got up early and milked animals, made cheese.</p>
<p>And I got to live in a traditional agricultural society</p>
<p>and learn how they ate.</p>
<p>So it shaped me as a cook</p>
<p>because it was a chance to have incredible ingredients,</p>
<p>learn how to cook very simple food.</p>
<p>I had been immersed in thought</p>
<p>that I wanted to be like a chefy chef, right?</p>
<p>Because I love food and I love cooking</p>
<p>and I was just drawn to that world.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t like the experience</p>
<p>of that sort of like fancy food experience</p>
<p>is not what is exciting for me about it.</p>
<p>So I loved working in that environment</p>
<p>because I got to eat lunches and dinners</p>
<p>and everything with the farm that I lived in.</p>
<p>The farm that I lived on</p>
<p>and just very traditional, simple way to eat.</p>
<p>The other piece of it is I went to high school in the 90s,</p>
<p>child of like the low fat generation, right?</p>
<p>And it was just really liberating and amazing</p>
<p>to eat tons of super fatty foods</p>
<p>and olive oil all over the place</p>
<p>and bleak slabs of bread and salami</p>
<p>and being this like vibrant health,</p>
<p>like be leaner, you know, happy, no skin stuff,</p>
<p>you know, stop getting split ends.</p>
<p>Like I stopped having flaky nails,</p>
<p>like just stuff that had bothered me my whole life,</p>
<p>including like just moodiness.</p>
<p>And that all just changed.</p>
<p>And granted, I was also like living on a farm in Italy</p>
<p>and getting up with the sunlight.</p>
<p>And like there were lots of great aspects of my life as well</p>
<p>that happened in that time.</p>
<p>But I was just immersed in this diet</p>
<p>that I realized like, man, this is so simple.</p>
<p>And I also loved that I had like, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have dinner and it was just like some ricotta cheese</p>
<p>with some olive oil, some bread</p>
<p>and like a bowl of fava beans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s dinner.</p>
<p>And it kind of broke down my assumptions too</p>
<p>about like dinner always has to be this, you know,</p>
<p>a protein and a vegetable and, you know,</p>
<p>being more fluid and more seasonal was exciting for me.</p>
<p>So I just learned kind of a lot about paying attention</p>
<p>to food, simple preparation</p>
<p>and the vibrancy of health that I personally experienced</p>
<p>kind of made me double down on that.</p>
<p>Our mutual friend, Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>mentioned something offline to me</p>
<p>about something involving the mob.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Is there something you could share or is this,</p>
<p>or are people going to hurt if you share this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s far enough in the rear view mirror.</p>
<p>I mean, I was hired by this group in Sicily on,</p>
<p>and this is, you know, I was all of like 21 years old</p>
<p>and to get a permit to work there,</p>
<p>you have to show that you have a competency</p>
<p>that nobody else in Italy has.</p>
<p>And that competency for Anya Fernald at the time</p>
<p>was cheese expert.</p>
<p>So it was like, stupid American girl being like,</p>
<p>going to the consulate.</p>
<p>So I already knew that it was like,</p>
<p>there was something wobbly about this organization,</p>
<p>but I wanted to work for them.</p>
<p>And my boss from that time did end up in federal prison</p>
<p>for corruption many years later, embezzlement primarily.</p>
<p>But, so I was definitely in an environment</p>
<p>that was answering to multiple masters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice way to put it.</p>
<p>It was, I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better way</p>
<p>to kind of get with life and understand</p>
<p>how things happen in the world though.</p>
<p>You know, of learning as somebody who tends</p>
<p>to be super direct and not very subtle,</p>
<p>it was amazing to be in this world</p>
<p>where like everybody communicates in multiple levels.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re going to lunch with my boss,</p>
<p>with somebody we&rsquo;re gonna do a business deal with</p>
<p>and by the, they ordered a glass of wine</p>
<p>and with that order communicated like, disappointment.</p>
<p>Because that, the father of the person</p>
<p>who had made that wine had offended that other guys.</p>
<p>I like that level of stuff, like nothing happened directly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what are we talking about afterwards?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what happened that lunch?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, I just, you know,</p>
<p>I told him this by ordering that, whatever.</p>
<p>You know, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So understand that there&rsquo;s different ways of communicating.</p>
<p>But it was also, you know, it was interesting to see.</p>
<p>And I think I, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of the struggle</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve lived again and again in my life.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, what we were doing in that operation</p>
<p>was there&rsquo;s a very traditional cheese</p>
<p>called the Raguzano cheese in Southeastern Sicily</p>
<p>where I lived, Ragusa.</p>
<p>And it was about scaling that operation.</p>
<p>So it was European Union money</p>
<p>that my boss was also unfortunately using for other things.</p>
<p>But fundamentally it was to take that,</p>
<p>this type of very small scale cheese,</p>
<p>get them exported, help them scale.</p>
<p>And we did it.</p>
<p>And it was really challenging.</p>
<p>And I learned a lot about the safety issues</p>
<p>and collaboration issues</p>
<p>and creating groups of farmers for scale.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of been doing the same thing again and again.</p>
<p>But Sicily, it, you know,</p>
<p>it was also just the first place</p>
<p>where I would regularly forage for food.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, like there I&rsquo;d go to friends houses</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d like go out and pick nettles</p>
<p>or go out and pick wild asparagus.</p>
<p>So every season there were stuff that you&rsquo;d be gathering.</p>
<p>And that was just part of how you lived.</p>
<p>And it was part of your health.</p>
<p>So that was, I just learned a ton in that time</p>
<p>about like simple eating and really that healthy food,</p>
<p>the simpler it is, the better, right?</p>
<p>Like this sort of sense that healthy food</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t in a tiny package, granola bar,</p>
<p>lots of labels, lots of powders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the more simple, essential,</p>
<p>closer to the land can actually lead to optimal health.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve learned to appreciate the simplicity of food,</p>
<p>the beauty within the simplicity.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because it was the first time</p>
<p>that I had amazing food quality.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Cause in the, where I grew up,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t that food quality.</p>
<p>Like I had some stuff from my garden and things</p>
<p>that were great, but that&rsquo;s the kind of place</p>
<p>where when artichokes in season,</p>
<p>all of a sudden there&rsquo;s guys selling artichokes</p>
<p>on their bicycles in the street</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just fresh picked and you&rsquo;d get that one thing</p>
<p>or the torpedo onions or they like,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a seasonality and celebration of things</p>
<p>in their peak moment.</p>
<p>And you would just have that one thing.</p>
<p>And that was the first time I&rsquo;d ever eaten in that way.</p>
<p>You were a judge several times on Iron Chef.</p>
<p>How do you judge a good meal, like what your own,</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s, like what rating system is good?</p>
<p>I mean, I go on experience and think about how many</p>
<p>of your like most memorable, fantastic meals</p>
<p>are like three star Michelin meals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about the experience, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about that slow down, who are you with?</p>
<p>And some of our best meals are like the most simple things.</p>
<p>So Iron Chef, those were fun experiences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of sous vide though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of sauces.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of powders.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of like magic food.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not, I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>to watch it as science, but I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if those are my most memorable meals.</p>
<p>So the experience is how you judge a good meal.</p>
<p>For you personally, if you were a judge</p>
<p>of the entirety of the human experience</p>
<p>in terms of the culinary journey,</p>
<p>that would be like the people you&rsquo;re eating with,</p>
<p>the environment, like how you feel,</p>
<p>the journey, the building up to that meal, the whole thing.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t separate it out.</p>
<p>When I was learning as an apprentice cheese maker in Greece,</p>
<p>one of the best meals of my life</p>
<p>is like a bowl of cold sheep milk yogurt</p>
<p>with like a crust of cold fat on top.</p>
<p>So like the way that these fatty,</p>
<p>sheep milk can have double the percentage</p>
<p>of fat than cow milk.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s the yogurt and then there&rsquo;s this crust</p>
<p>of fat and then they pour the fresh honey over the top</p>
<p>and you just eat like this bowl of probably top five meals</p>
<p>of my life, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the simplicity, it&rsquo;s just the best thing.</p>
<p>And it was the fact that it&rsquo;s in Terracotta</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d had this amazing day</p>
<p>and all of these things come together,</p>
<p>but I still remember that feeling.</p>
<p>And I think most of us have those like really great</p>
<p>sensual memories of food and they&rsquo;re not about necessarily</p>
<p>that one fancy over the top restaurant or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about the cold context of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Maybe you can help me with something.</p>
<p>So I think Offline said that we&rsquo;re both introverts a bit,</p>
<p>but I certainly find joy in repetition.</p>
<p>So I kind of hide away as an introvert</p>
<p>and eat the same thing over and over and over again.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I had this conversation</p>
<p>with Tyler Cohen, who&rsquo;s an economist,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also a food critic.</p>
<p>He writes these incredible posts about different foods.</p>
<p>And we had this conversation about</p>
<p>what his last meal would be.</p>
<p>If he had to choose, like what is the best meal</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s ever eaten that he would want to eat?</p>
<p>And he had a good answer about it.</p>
<p>It had to do with experience, I think.</p>
<p>For him, it was a particular Mexican restaurant</p>
<p>and it had in Mexico because of the ingredients,</p>
<p>because of the experience, because of the work it took</p>
<p>to get there and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But it also made me realize, like when I was going home</p>
<p>after that conversation, that I couldn&rsquo;t answer</p>
<p>that question myself, like what is the best meal</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever eaten?</p>
<p>Because I really haven&rsquo;t experienced much.</p>
<p>And so it almost was like a challenge to myself.</p>
<p>Like I feel like I should journey out a little bit more</p>
<p>in this life and try stuff.</p>
<p>And to try to see like what is the best meal</p>
<p>for me in the world?</p>
<p>You know, like both the experience and the taste, right?</p>
<p>So I was kind of wondering, first I&rsquo;d love to ask you</p>
<p>like what your last meal would be</p>
<p>or what is the greatest meal you&rsquo;ve ever eaten?</p>
<p>But also, and you&rsquo;re still very young,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s still more experiences to be had, right?</p>
<p>And for me, like how do you go about finding</p>
<p>the best meal in the world?</p>
<p>Is there a device you could give essentially?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that sense of anticipation, right?</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s the best meal, I&rsquo;d say for you,</p>
<p>it would need to be on the heels of something</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;d pushed yourself with a fast</p>
<p>or with an athletic event, right?</p>
<p>Or something like you would be coming into it</p>
<p>with a sense of anticipation because of deprivation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be hungry for it in a bigger sense of the word,</p>
<p>like hungry for deep nutrition on your soul level</p>
<p>as well as your belly.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say that you&rsquo;d have to think about it</p>
<p>as a phase of things, like multiple things.</p>
<p>And then I also think, you love meat, you love cheese.</p>
<p>You have to have some things that come together, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s gotta be some specific elements</p>
<p>of just your favorite flavors in that.</p>
<p>But there could be flavors yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole other thing because I just emotionally</p>
<p>and physically feel good on meat,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean like maybe like a rice based dish,</p>
<p>like sushi or something like that,</p>
<p>or Indian cuisine where it&rsquo;s like sauces</p>
<p>and the breads and whatever.</p>
<p>I love that stuff too.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking about like a meal is an experience</p>
<p>that could be like a one night stand,</p>
<p>but with a piece of food, right?</p>
<p>It could be a totally different</p>
<p>than what actually makes you feel good</p>
<p>when you eat it every day.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Completely, completely analogous.</p>
<p>I get that.</p>
<p>I mean, you also though, there&rsquo;s elements of comfort</p>
<p>and love and those different pieces for you.</p>
<p>But I think you gotta look at like,</p>
<p>where would you go somewhere?</p>
<p>Like would you go to a place where you could hike in Japan</p>
<p>and then end up in a little place where you eat something?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I would think you were gonna have</p>
<p>that magic moment.</p>
<p>Maybe someplace you go to Mongolia</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a really extreme environment</p>
<p>for three or four days,</p>
<p>and then you come back and you&rsquo;re in a farm</p>
<p>and you get something on the table that&rsquo;s a surprise</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re hungry.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s gonna be the moment where you&rsquo;re gonna explode</p>
<p>in the instance of like the culinary level</p>
<p>for Alexa levels up, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the journey for you.</p>
<p>But it has to be, I think from understanding you,</p>
<p>like a combination of that pushing yourself anticipation</p>
<p>and something about the, exactly, and the environment.</p>
<p>Well, I definitely, definitely,</p>
<p>like some fasting is part of a great meal for me.</p>
<p>So like 24 hours is like the minimum.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more sensitive to the richness of any experience</p>
<p>for me when I fast 24 hours.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a requirement.</p>
<p>For a good meal is 24 hour fast, I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like you&rsquo;re able to taste,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it&rsquo;s psychological,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re able to disassemble the various flavors</p>
<p>in a meal as simple as like even a chicken breast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of flavors going on.</p>
<p>Because like when you cook a chicken breast,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like the outside, the inside.</p>
<p>I mean, the volume of the meat tastes different</p>
<p>as you eat like the different fibers.</p>
<p>And you can like tell all those differences as you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re fasting, and you can appreciate that.</p>
<p>And of course, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>part of the journey is important.</p>
<p>It makes me think like whether restaurants</p>
<p>is the right place to explore or what.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m envisioning it on a farm for you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m envisioning it in a place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like really into ag and food.</p>
<p>You know, like even a place like Romania.</p>
<p>You know, like they have incredible farms, right?</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s not gonna get any like fancy restaurants there,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re probably gonna have some amazing little cheeses</p>
<p>and cured meats, and you might go to some, you know,</p>
<p>have some experience and end up in a place</p>
<p>with like four things on the plate</p>
<p>and each of them blows your mind.</p>
<p>You know, like, or Japan is another place like that.</p>
<p>I think Vietnam, Laos, like, I mean, those are countries</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like these incredible niche ingredients</p>
<p>and this essentialism around food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s in Russia with Putin.</p>
<p>That might be the best meal in the world.</p>
<p>With him on the farm.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;d be, it&rsquo;s hard to reproduce that.</p>
<p>If that is in fact a good meal, it&rsquo;d be, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to get them out to the farm,</p>
<p>but maybe one time they&rsquo;d be the best meal.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>For me, like it&rsquo;s the ingredients that I associate</p>
<p>with like indulgence, like be fresh bread</p>
<p>with like my favorite cultured butter on it,</p>
<p>be food of my childhood.</p>
<p>I grew up in Oregon.</p>
<p>We always had salmon and I smoked salmon or salmon eggs,</p>
<p>like really good salmon eggs.</p>
<p>I love cheese.</p>
<p>I love goat cheese.</p>
<p>I love all kinds of cheese.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be cheese.</p>
<p>I love meat, obviously.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m imagining it&rsquo;s sort of like an abundance</p>
<p>of like 10 things I love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a dish.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like all the yummy things.</p>
<p>All of your indulgences on the same plate, yeah.</p>
<p>And there isn&rsquo;t like, for me, there&rsquo;s not like a big cake</p>
<p>or something super like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like really yummy things that I love,</p>
<p>like really fresh, crusty, delicious bread that&rsquo;s warm</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got a bunch of butter on it</p>
<p>and I can put some salt on it and eat a big slab of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>And so meat to you is not like one of those indulgences?</p>
<p>Oh, definitely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d definitely be steak there too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just imagining not like there isn&rsquo;t a specific dish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like eight or 10 things, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fresh bread.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something like fishy, yummy,</p>
<p>probably be really good fresh berries too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be a steak or a pork chop</p>
<p>or something like meaty and delicious and savory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be some cheese,</p>
<p>just a bunch of different things that I love to eat</p>
<p>that like all kind of check boxes for me</p>
<p>is probably what would make me happiest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of variety.</p>
<p>I like the focus when you can just,</p>
<p>this is all you have,</p>
<p>the scarcity of just this is the one ingredient</p>
<p>and really appreciating it or maybe one thing,</p>
<p>like one full complex flavor, whatever the heck that is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the distraction,</p>
<p>the serial dating nature of having a bunch of things</p>
<p>on a plate is, yeah,</p>
<p>for some reason that prevents me</p>
<p>from fully enjoying any one of them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that is.</p>
<p>The more healthy way to do it is the variety.</p>
<p>Your way is the healthier way to do it.</p>
<p>Is alcohol involved?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t drink very much.</p>
<p>I like red wine, but I just don&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>I love red wine with good food.</p>
<p>I also cofounded a rum business that&rsquo;s an organic rum,</p>
<p>so I love that product,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not, for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m more interested in the food, I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>Is there some connection between your chef life,</p>
<p>cooking and music?</p>
<p>Does this music have a role in the experience?</p>
<p>I love artistic expression,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s always had a role in my life</p>
<p>in the same way I love to paint and draw</p>
<p>and all the different things.</p>
<p>I was a professional musician when I lived in Sicily,</p>
<p>by definition, technicality,</p>
<p>because I played in the municipal band.</p>
<p>So I would march around the town with all the funerals.</p>
<p>I get like 50 euro every time I&rsquo;d march in a funeral</p>
<p>playing my oboe, so it&rsquo;s given me,</p>
<p>I like that because I like to,</p>
<p>like you were talking about going to farms,</p>
<p>like what I quested for was experience and connection,</p>
<p>in places where I could learn things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been the through line of my learning journey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned things and sought knowledge</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t get in any conventional learning environment,</p>
<p>and so what are the tools that let me do that?</p>
<p>It was like being adaptable and comfortable</p>
<p>in different cultures,</p>
<p>but also having common ground points</p>
<p>that allow you to connect with people,</p>
<p>so music&rsquo;s one of those things.</p>
<p>So I love music, but I also,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any number of enjoy of food,</p>
<p>being able to pitch in and help in the kitchen,</p>
<p>you know, like cards,</p>
<p>like those are when you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>getting into like farming communities and stuff,</p>
<p>that stuff really helps, right?</p>
<p>So I basically have cultivated tools</p>
<p>that let me drop into places where I can learn,</p>
<p>and so those are all kind of a piece.</p>
<p>Those are just tools to get in there.</p>
<p>That said, we did listen to Justin Bieber earlier today.</p>
<p>I need to get more into him.</p>
<p>I need to understand the full complexity of the Biebs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to achieve what hunting stands for,</p>
<p>but at a much larger scale,</p>
<p>which is what kind of Belcampo stands for,</p>
<p>but what are your thoughts on hunting as a source of meat?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, 100% pro hunting.</p>
<p>I think the reason that hunting flips the switch</p>
<p>for so many people is because it&rsquo;s the first thing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had clean meat in their lives.</p>
<p>Okay, so I think that the hunter&rsquo;s journey,</p>
<p>when people get so turned on by hunting,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like, oh my God, I&rsquo;m never going back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s great if you&rsquo;ve got access to that,</p>
<p>or if you know the guy who&rsquo;ll give you the backstrap,</p>
<p>awesome, but that&rsquo;s not achievable for most of us,</p>
<p>and I do think that talking to hunters</p>
<p>about their experiences, what they love about it,</p>
<p>many of them are just outdoors,</p>
<p>and I say that because most of them are men,</p>
<p>but most of them love the outdoors aspect of it</p>
<p>and being out in the wild,</p>
<p>but a lot of them, it&rsquo;s because of how they feel</p>
<p>when they eat the meat, and it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>I mean, 99% of meat in America is made a very specific way,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in a way that is pretty inflammatory,</p>
<p>not incredibly delicious, and when you&rsquo;re on that extreme,</p>
<p>and then you toggle to having</p>
<p>this totally different style of product,</p>
<p>it feels radically different in your body,</p>
<p>so of course you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;ll never go back.</p>
<p>So when I talk about us being on that spectrum,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, it&rsquo;s, hunted meat&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, I can never on any commercial operation</p>
<p>create the variety of the biodiversity of species</p>
<p>that an elk gets when it&rsquo;s wandering around of its own,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no way you can do that on a farm,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s always gonna be that extra five or 10%</p>
<p>that those wild animals are gonna have,</p>
<p>and those wild animals also fast for longer,</p>
<p>so they go through periods of starvation,</p>
<p>and that creates an even slower growth for musculature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna create even more unique flavor</p>
<p>and characteristics, so that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s that extra</p>
<p>in the hunted meat, but you can come a lot closer</p>
<p>with regenerative traditional farming</p>
<p>to that flavor and health</p>
<p>than with any other type of farming I know,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s where I see it on the spectrum.</p>
<p>I love that people are getting excited about game,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s better for your health,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got all the same characteristics</p>
<p>as regenerative farmed meat,</p>
<p>and it gets people turned on to simple, delicious food.</p>
<p>You know, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to cover food</p>
<p>with sauce that&rsquo;s got corn syrup and soy,</p>
<p>a bunch of junk in it to make it palatable.</p>
<p>If you gotta put sauce on your food,</p>
<p>you need to look at your ingredients.</p>
<p>You need to revisit what you&rsquo;re starting from,</p>
<p>because if you have to put a bunch of things</p>
<p>to mask flavor onto anything you&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to basically fool your palate</p>
<p>into doing what&rsquo;s not best for your body.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to tell our palates,</p>
<p>like, just make it through this plate</p>
<p>so you can get the calories in,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re masking the fact</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t actually find it very appetizing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re kind of teaching ourselves</p>
<p>to overcome our instinct with food.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re saying, here&rsquo;s this kind of bland base substrate,</p>
<p>not very interesting, I&rsquo;m not like sparking to it.</p>
<p>Awesome, put sugar and salt on it.</p>
<p>This up the hyperprocess flavor profile.</p>
<p>Great, done.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re sparked to it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very short road,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s, I think, a lot of the health problems</p>
<p>we have now is because we&rsquo;re masking flavors</p>
<p>and basically trying to get ourselves</p>
<p>to move down this path of the same way</p>
<p>we behave around all hyperprocess foods.</p>
<p>And that gets us into a mess with our health.</p>
<p>So if we can get things like game</p>
<p>where people love the flavor out of the gate,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s natural, simple, mentally processed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a win.</p>
<p>Yeah, it reverses that hyperprocessing trend</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re on as a human species.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the promise of regenerative farming,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the promise of hunting.</p>
<p>Obviously, the former can be scaled,</p>
<p>the hunting, I think, cannot be scaled, right?</p>
<p>But in many ways, the hunting inspires the world</p>
<p>that this is the right way to eat.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that naturally leads to then</p>
<p>the humane farming, regenerative farming idea,</p>
<p>which is this idea that hunting represents.</p>
<p>How do you scale that?</p>
<p>Well, if you look at, we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>people use this sort of marketing language</p>
<p>of happy cows or that kind of thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about the happiest animals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wild animals, right?</p>
<p>So if you wonder why these practices are good,</p>
<p>talk to hunters.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about animals that have lived</p>
<p>in their evolutionary capacity, right?</p>
<p>Who have played their role in the ecosystem,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve lived their meaning of life, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very powerfully different kind of role</p>
<p>than livestock production.</p>
<p>So I think if we can make our livestock production</p>
<p>as similar to wild as possible,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re a lot of steps closer.</p>
<p>So you said the animals are happiest in the wild</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where they find meaning.</p>
<p>What about us, the human animal?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning for us, do you think?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve monitored the life cycle of a lot of living beings.</p>
<p>You ever look in the mirror and think like,</p>
<p>why the hell are we humans here?</p>
<p>I mean, thriving, reducing suffering, creating goodness.</p>
<p>I mean, those are the things I see in animals behavior.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mostly interested in reducing suffering</p>
<p>and nurturing, right?</p>
<p>Those are the things that I think evolutionarily.</p>
<p>And we humans are just clever</p>
<p>and we wanna be able to try to do that</p>
<p>at a bigger and bigger scale.</p>
<p>As much as possible, reduce the suffering in the world.</p>
<p>And somehow that alleviates us of our own suffering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Russian thing, life is suffering</p>
<p>and somehow helping others alleviates it</p>
<p>and come up with creative solutions to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost consciousness is the thing</p>
<p>that led to suffering, but it also led</p>
<p>to the desire to alleviate the suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feedback loop.</p>
<p>Consciousness creates suffering</p>
<p>and the desire to alleviate it.</p>
<p>Is there yet a pretty nonlinear life?</p>
<p>Your parents were professors.</p>
<p>You have done a lot of sort of incredible things</p>
<p>that many would say kind of like,</p>
<p>how the hell are you gonna get this done?</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give to young people today,</p>
<p>like high school, college, about how to do,</p>
<p>how to live a similarly nonlinear crazy life</p>
<p>and accomplish, be as successful as you have been</p>
<p>about whether it&rsquo;s just their career or life in general?</p>
<p>The greatest gifts I&rsquo;ve been given</p>
<p>have come from pursuing curiosity.</p>
<p>Just trying to understand the thing you&rsquo;re curious about</p>
<p>and allowing yourself to be curious about it</p>
<p>and just going with it.</p>
<p>And also pursuing things that are like deeply joyful for me.</p>
<p>Not what society wants, but you just personally,</p>
<p>just on your own, you&rsquo;re happy that you did it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that in the times</p>
<p>when I strayed from that, my life has been harder.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fundamentally, what are we on earth to do?</p>
<p>To live and thrive.</p>
<p>And so pursuing things that are curious</p>
<p>and satisfying and interesting and joyful</p>
<p>and allow me to grow.</p>
<p>So I made a number of choices to do things</p>
<p>that were more complicated and not considered cool</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>Although now it&rsquo;s cool to work on farms.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t when I started my career in animal agriculture.</p>
<p>And it was like, but just deeply interesting to me.</p>
<p>And I felt like there was just lots to learn.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s been the path for me</p>
<p>is like going for something that&rsquo;s curious and hard</p>
<p>and sticking with it and being open to it.</p>
<p>And growing elements that give me joy through that.</p>
<p>So I also, for people who are starting out</p>
<p>in their careers and want to do something different too,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, get out of your comfort.</p>
<p>Go to a place that you&rsquo;ve got something to learn from</p>
<p>and let it teach you that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll get beat up.</p>
<p>Like I got beat up by that experience.</p>
<p>Like it was really hard.</p>
<p>I laugh about now working in Sicily for,</p>
<p>and the funny experiences I had there, but it was hard.</p>
<p>I was lonely and cried a lot.</p>
<p>It was stressful.</p>
<p>It was like, it was hard.</p>
<p>It was really hard.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re inside of it,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s going to turn out.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s going to turn out well.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, why didn&rsquo;t I get a job doing something</p>
<p>that all my friends are doing?</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t speak the language yet.</p>
<p>I had to learn foreign language and learn how to function.</p>
<p>And it was very lonely and very challenging,</p>
<p>but then that&rsquo;s where my resilience started to grow.</p>
<p>So the things I learned, they helped me grow.</p>
<p>So the things I learned there ended up just being</p>
<p>about resilience and understanding the language</p>
<p>of subtlety in meaning.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s carried me through my life.</p>
<p>But it was a curiosity about cheese making</p>
<p>and about like just living in a village that was there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wouldn&rsquo;t it be amazing</p>
<p>to just live in a really rural village.</p>
<p>And you just went with it.</p>
<p>And I just like, this seems incredible</p>
<p>and have a place where you can,</p>
<p>the people seem interesting, the food seems good.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just like try this and see what I can learn.</p>
<p>And that like putting yourself out of your comfort zone</p>
<p>in a place where you have a chance to learn</p>
<p>and grow is the secret.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s, you grow through discomfort.</p>
<p>People think that you grow when you get</p>
<p>into this environment where everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like kind of sailing along,</p>
<p>but like growth actually comes through pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like growth comes from being cut down</p>
<p>and beat down and having to regrow and double down.</p>
<p>And so that kind of opportunity,</p>
<p>you have to seek it out.</p>
<p>You have to put yourself in the line of fire a bit.</p>
<p>If the situation sucks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sign that you might be doing something right</p>
<p>in the sense that you&rsquo;re on the path</p>
<p>at the end of which you&rsquo;ll be a better person</p>
<p>if you allow yourself to grow in that way.</p>
<p>Like as opposed to resisting it,</p>
<p>just going along with the journey and persevering.</p>
<p>And that ended us up in this incredible place.</p>
<p>This whole conversation, I&rsquo;ll probably overlay a video.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at a gorgeous mountain</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an incredible farm.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for a meal yesterday.</p>
<p>That was incredible.</p>
<p>The cheese, the fish eggs,</p>
<p>just everything about this place.</p>
<p>Looking up, you can see the stars.</p>
<p>The stars at night are beautiful</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a peacefulness to it.</p>
<p>I had a pretty hard week actually,</p>
<p>just emotionally in many ways.</p>
<p>And just coming here, it&rsquo;s immediately,</p>
<p>so much of it is lifted.</p>
<p>So I really deeply appreciate Anya</p>
<p>that you would invite me here</p>
<p>and that you have this conversation.</p>
<p>This was really awesome.</p>
<p>So thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Anya Fernald and thank you to Gala Games,</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, Four Sigmatic and Fundrise.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu.</p>
<p>Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next time.</p>
